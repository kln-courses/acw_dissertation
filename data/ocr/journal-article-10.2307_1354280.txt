Spanos The disclosure of being as such is simultaneously and intrinsically the concealing of being as a whole. In the simultaneity of disclosure and concealing errancy holds sway. Errancy and the concealing of what is con- cealed belongs to the primordial essence of truth. Martin Heidegger, "On the Essence of Truth" ... There is no center, but always decenterings, series that register the halting passage from presence to ab- sence, from excess to deficiency. The circle must be abandoned as a faulty principle of return. Michel Foucault, "Theatrum Philosophicum" n May 1978, after three years of preparatory work by a task force of administrators and faculty (and inordinate encouragement by the media), the Harvard University Faculty of Arts and Sciences adopted a "Core Curriculum" to replace the existing General Education Pro- gram (established in the mid-1940's), the purposes of which had been 7</page><page sequence="2">8 William V. Spanos "eroded" by the "proliferation of courses" during the 1960's. As if waiting for such a definitive signal from a privileged institutional authority, a large number of colleges and universities in the United States immediately followed suit. This reformative process, supported by and supporting the broad "Back to Basics" movement sponsored by the Reagan presidency, continues to gather momentum.2 The following essay attempts to show that the recuperation by the Harvard faculty of a Core Curriculum from what traditional human-. ists have come to call "the overoptioned curriculum" represents a symptomatic nostalgia for, if not a reactionary effort to restore, the "common body of humanistic knowledge" whose authority was called radically into question by the student protest movement during the Vietnam War, drawing attention to the compliance, if not complicity, of higher education in America with the industrial/military/political establishment's ethnocentric war against the people of Vietnam. By way of a destructive analysis of the synecdochic example of the Har- vard "Report on the Core Curriculum" this essay tries to show that humanism is a logocentrism that precipitates a binary logic - Being/ time, Identity/difference, Order/chaos, etc. - in which the first term is 1. Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Harvard University, Report on the Core Curriculum (February 15, 1978), 1. 2. See, for example, WilliamJ. Bennett, "To Reclaim a Legacy: Report on Human- ities in Education," The Chronicle of Higher Edl(a tion, Vol. XXIX, 11 (November 28, 1984), 16-21. As the title itself suggests, this It port, written by the chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities and "based on the findings of the endow- ment's Study Group on the State of Lea rning in the Humanities in Higher Education," restates the humanistic rationale and the recuperative programmatic recommen- dations of the "Harvard Core Curriculum Report" in even more overtly prescriptive terms: ".. . .the humanities can contribute to an informed sense of community by enabling us to learn about and become participants in a common culture, share- holders in our civilization. But our goal should be more thanjust a common culture - even television and the comics can give us that. We should, instead, want all students to know a common culture rooted in civilization's lasting vision, its highest shared ideals and aspirations, and its heritage" ( 17 . Devoid of reference to the insistent and at least arguable postmodern critique of the d( ourse of humanism - or, rather, interpreting it as "a collective loss of nerve and faith on the part of both faculty and academic administrators during the late 1960s and early 1970s," which "was undeniably de- structive of the curriculum" (19), the "Report" makes amply clear that "civilization" here and throughout the text means "American" or at least "Western and Humanistic Civilization." The fact that the "Report" was commissioned by the National Endow- ment for the Humanities and that its chairman/author was appointed Secretary of Education by President Reagan shortly after its publication January 10, 1985) suggests the political affiliations of the massive institutional effort to recuperate the Core Curriculum, that is, to "reclaim a legacy."</page><page sequence="3">Modern Humanist Education not simply privileged over the second, but is endowed with the author- ity and power to colonize the latter or to relegate it, in Thomas Pyn- chon's resonant term, to preterition. Far from being a mode of dis- interested inquiry, humanism is discovered by such an analysis to be a naturalized version of the supernatural Logos. Inscribed by the anthro- pological telos, its discourse is governed by a center elsewhere, beyond the reach of freeplay, from which inscrutable vantage point its panop- tic I (eye) can spatialize and enframe, reify and comprehend ("take hold of," "grasp," "manage") the be-ing - the difference - that being-as-temporality disseminates. Put in a different but fundamen- tally related way to suggest that the humanistic discourse takes place at other, more "practical," sites on the continuum of being, humanism comes to be understood as an intellectual legitimation of the dominant economic, social, and political power structures, which reproduces the world in its own image, i.e., assimilates and circumscribes the Other to the central proper self of Capitalistic Man. It comes, in short, to be recognized as an ideology that transforms the vital forces of difference in all its specific manifestations - from consciousness through gender and class to nature itself- into a docile but useful and efficient instrument of hegemonic power. Governed by the economy of this binary logic or, what is the same thing, this panoptic geometry of the centered circle (which constitutes the condition of possibility of this logic), the history of humanistic education since the Renaissance has been, therefore, a re-collective history undertaken in the name of presuppositionless inquiry. It has been a history of subtle and imperceptible coercion, dif- ferentiating de-differentiation, colonization, and pacification of the threatening Other precipitated by the recurrent historical ruptures that dis-integrate and multiply the existing "common [singular] body of humanistic knowledge" (what, in the rhetoric of pedagogy, are usually called "knowledge explosions"). As such, this history has been one of complicity with socio-political power. To invoke three of the most prominent voices of the post-humanist counter-memory - voices that will be heard in my text - the history of humanistic education has enacted totalizing recuperative strategies which reflect, however uneven the development, the structural im- peratives of metaphysics as defined by Martin Heidegger andJacques Derrida and of panopticism as defined by Michel Foucault. I am refer- ring in part to the images informing these modes of thought: the ideal circle, which, though it does not exist in time, is nevertheless under- 9</page><page sequence="4">10 William V Spanos stood as the structural model for interpreting and shaping the tem- poral world; and the Panopticon of the Age of the Enlightenment, the very real centered circle, which is nevertheless simultaneously an ideal or generalizable model, polyvalent in its mundane applications. I am also and primarily referring to the continuum between their essential orientations towards phenomena and the consequences of these ori- entations for knowledge. In the first instance, that over-looking or oversight and forgetting which, according to Heidegger's and Derrida's de-struction or deconstruction of the onto-theo-logical tradition, con- stitute the essential epistemological limitations of a perception ofphysis - the difference that time disseminates- from after or above it (tele- ologically/spatially): The concept of centered structure is in fact the concept of a play based on a fundamental ground, a play constituted on the basis of a findamental immobility and a reassuring certitude which itself is beyond the reach of play. And on the basis of this certitude anxiety [in the face of dispersal] can be mastered, for anxiety is invariably the result of a certain mode of being implicated in the game, of being caught by the game, of being as it were at stake in the game from the outset. And again on the basis of what we call the center (and which, because it can be either inside or outside, can also indifferently be called the origin or end, archeortelos), repetitions, substitutions, transfor- mations, and permutations are always taken from a history of meaning [sens] - that is, in a word, a history - whose origin may always be reawakened or whose end may always be antic- ipated in the form of presence.3 In the second instance, that super-vision or sur-veillance of difference, which according to Foucault's genealogy of modern power, becomes a micro-technology of regulation in and in behalf of the formation of the disciplinary society: 3.

The fact that it should have given rise, even in our own time, to so many variations, projected or realized, is evidence of the imaginary intensity that it has possessed for almost two hundred years. But the Panopticon must not be understood as a dream building: it is a diagram of a mechanism of power reduced to its ideal form; its functioning, abstracted from any obstacle, resistance or fric- tion, must be represented as a pure architectural and optical system: it is in fact a figure of political technology that may and must be detached from any specific use. It is polyvalent in its applications; it serves to reform prison- ers, but also to treat patients, to instruct schoolchildren, to con- fine the insane, to supervise workers, to put beggars and idlers to work. It is a type of location of bodies in space, of distribu- tion of individuals in relation to one another, of hierarchical organization, of disposition of centres and channels of power, of definition of the instruments and modes of intervention of power, which can be implemented in hospitals, workshops, schools, prisons. Whenever one is dealing with a multiplicity of individuals on whom a task or a particular form of behavior must be imposed, the panoptic schema may be used.4 The following essay is intended to contribute to the writing of this unwritten disciplinary history by doing "hermeneutic violence," as it were, to the humanistic educational discourses that have given the- oretical and practical shape to the "liberal arts" curricula of the Anglo- American institutions of higher learning in the modern period. More specifically, Part I will undertake a "destruction" of the educational discourses of three exemplary humanists, Matthew Arnold, Irving 4.

Alan Sheridan (New York: Pantheon Books, 1977),from which I have quoted, the title loses the crucial relationship between visual perception and power, and this diverts attention from the affiliation between the metaphysical tradition (and the educational institutions to which it has given rise) and recent historical socio-political technologies of power: i.e., Foucault's kinship with Heidegger, Derrida, and even Sartre. 11</page><page sequence="6">12 William V.

This assemblage is not as incongruous or arbitrary as it may seem at first glance. For each, as I will show, has had a continu- ing and significant, if not immediately visible, impact not only on the idea and practice of liberal education at Harvard University in this cen- tury, up to and through its adoption of the Core Curriculum of 1978, but, more important, on Harvard itself, on the idea and practice of cul- ture in the bourgeois/capitalistic Anglo-American world at large. It will be the purpose of Part II of this essay to make this continuity and its synecdochal implications visible by interrogating the Harvard Core Curriculum and the history of its adoption in the context of Arnold's, Babbitt's, and Richards's discourses. I To do the same thing over and over again is not only boredom: it is to be controlled by rather than to control what you do. Heraclitus Interpreted in terms of the prescriptive binary oppositions of meta- physics, Michel Foucault's analysis of panopticism as a "Benthamite physics of power"5 might all too easily be taken to constitute an in- terrogation of spatial perception restricted exclusively to scientific positivism. Such an interpretation would thus provide "poetic" humanists - humanists professing litterae humaniores, i.e., the "humanities" - with an unjustifiable justification for their idealistic alternative to the question of knowledge and learning. It is, of course, true that Bentham's utilitarian panoptic schema is the culturally domi- nant manifestation of the metaphysical will to power over being in our historical conjuncture. But as Heidegger's destruction of the onto- theo-logical tradition suggests, idealistic and empirical, subjective and objective modes of inquiry are both teleological modes that spatialize time. Panopticism, that is, is endemic not only to modern positivistic education, but also to the modern humanistic substitute for positiv- ism.

It was, by and large, the success ofJohn Stuart Mill's and, above all, Matthew Arnold's sustained effort to recuperate the "Classical" tradition in the face of the seductive challenge of a revisionary utilitarian curriculum based on "objective science" and sponsored by such politically liberal heirs ofJeremy Bentham and the elder Mill as T.H. Huxley and Her- bert Spencer6 that assured a fundamental and privileged place for the "humanities" in higher, especially undergraduate, education in Eng- land and America.

What I am suggesting is, perhaps, best expressed by Francis Bacon, an admired forebear not simply of mod- ern scientific but also poetic humanists: "The End of Our Founda- tion," his spokesman in The New Atlantis says, "is the knowledge of Causes and secret motions of things; and the enlarging of the bounds of Humane Empire, to the effecting of all things possible."9 Behind the innocent rhetoric of liberation - of disinterested in- quiry, of sweetness and light - that these humanistic philosophers of education and pedagogues would implement against the mechanical abstractions of empirical science is, as we shall bear witness again and again, the privileged, authorizing, and coercive image (eidos, Bildung) of metaphysics that also informs the Panopticon of the positivistJeremy Bentham: the centered circle or, to appropriate the presiding and influ- ential ontological metaphor of T.S. Eliot's late metaphysical poetry, "the still point in the turning world." Though ostensiblyjustifying the liberal arts against the reifying consequences of an emergent "scientific education," each of these humanists, no less than their scientific coun- terparts, understands the knowledge context in terms of the binary logic of metaphysics: the One/many; Presence/absence; Identity/ difference; Eternity (Universality)/time; Permanence/ephemerality; Objectivity/subjectivity; Truth/error and its consequent binary ethical metaphorics: Light/darkness; Heath/sickness; Stability/volatility; Purpose/drift; Growth/decay; Apollo/Dionysus: in short, Culture or anarchy. For all their romantic warnings against abstraction, they understand the real danger to be the (Dionysiac) dispersal and pro- liferation of"classical" (Apollonian) knowledge - the e-mergence of difference - activated by the definitive rupture of the Tradition - the decentering of the logos in the modern world. Assuming, like Plato or Aquinas or Hegel, a disruptive violence against an authorizing Origin - a "fall" from one kind of Eternity or another into time - they per- ceive the ensuing diaspora as a fundamentally negative condition- the remediable cause of anxiety and perplexity. They thus insistently prescribe the restoration of a "holistic," i.e., integral, harmonious, balanced, closed, inclusive, total, and reassuring domain of knowl- edge grounded in what Derrida has called "a philosophy of presence" 9.

Spanos - a prelapsarian or universal and timeless norm or center. This hid- den center is the sedimented word of Man, i.e., the Humanistic Tradi- tion, which, of course, is the naturalized supplement of the super- natural Tradition of the Word of God. This, in effect, without aware- ness of the ironies, is the point that informs M.H. Abrams's influential celebration of the humanistic literary tradition, Natural Supernatural- ism: Much of what distinguishes writers I call "Romantic" derives from the fact that they undertook, whatever their religious creed or lack of creed, to save the traditional concepts, schemes, and values which had been based on the relation of the Creator to his creature and creation, but to reformulate them within the prevailing two-term system of subject and object, ego and non-ego, the human mind or consciousness and its transac- tions with nature. Despite their displacement from a super- natural to a natural frame of reference, however, the ancient problems, terminology, and ways of thinking about human nature and history survived, as the implicit distinctions and categories through which even radically secular writers saw themselves and their world, and as the presuppositions and forms of their thinking about the condition, the milieu, the essential values and aspirations, and the history and destiny of the individual and of mankind.'? Thus, like positivistic science, humanistic education, despite its appeal to the disinterested "play of mind," assumes a pre-ordained Norm immune to the assaults of temporal process and becomes essentially re-formist and disciplinary. "The concept of centered structure," we recall, "is in fact the concept of a play based on a fundamental ground, a play constituted on the basis of a fundamental immobility and a reassuring certitude, which itself is beyond the reach of play." 10.

Not here, O Apollo, Are haunts fit for thee, Matthew Arnold, "Callicles' Song," Empedocles on Etna In his celebrated essay, "The Function of Criticism at the Present Time," Matthew Arnold affirms "disinterestedness" as the measure "for [English criticism's] course, in order to avail itself of the field now opening to it, and to produce fruit for the future": The rule may be summed up in one word, - disinterestedness. And how is criticism to show disinterestedness? By keeping aloof from what is called the "practical view of things;" by resolutely following the law of its own nature, which is to be a free play of the mind on all subjects which it touches. By steadily refusing to lend itself to any of those ulterior, political, practical considerations about ideas, which plenty of people will be sure to attach to them, which perhaps ought often to be attached to them, which in this country at any rate are certain to be attached to them quite sufficiently, but which criticism has really nothing to do with. Its business is, as I have said, simply to know the best that is known and thought in the world, and by in its turn making this known, to create a current of true and fresh ideas." In thus giving privileged status to "disinterestedness" in the pursuit of knowledge in the human sciences - impartiality towards, detachment and distantiation from, the immediate historical context - Arnold established the central and inviolable tenet of modern humanistic inquiry and educational theory and practice. More than any of the other "values" he reiterated over and over again in his prose, this one 11.

Leavis, and I.A. Richards - indeed, as the founder of Modern Humanism as an institution. A destructive reading of his discourse, especially of Culture and Anarchy (1869), discloses that Arnold's appeal to the disinterested play of consciousness against the partiality of "in- terested" inquiry and his apotheosis of "Culture" against "anarchy" (whether literary or socio-political) conceal, in fact, the perennial nos- talgia for a lost Origin: the center beyond the reach of freeplay and the circle it precipitates to enframe and stabilize the volatile "objects" under scrutiny and to master the anxiety they activate. Given his commitment to the binary logic of the Western metaphysi- cal tradition, Arnold's confrontation in Culture and Anarchy with an "epoch of expansion"12 - the dislocating intellectual, cultural, social, and political irruptions of the industrialized nineteenth century - takes the inevitable form of re-collection and re-action. He interprets the disintegration of theological doctrine and sanctions, socio-political hierarchies, and classical humanistic educational goals in the face of the proliferation of scientific, anthropological, geological, and thus Bibli- cal knowledge; the increasing demand for electoral reforms, educa- tional opportunities, and a more equitable distribution of wealth; and the emergence of modern languages and their literatures, as essentially negative phenomena, as manifestations of decadence. For all his rhet- orical references to " 'a revolution by due course of law' " that "we are on our way to" (CA, 135-36), these constitute, for him, symptoms of an incipient, if not yet actualized, catastrophe - a fall from a concen- trated state, an original ideal unity ("Hellenism") grounded in the absolute Origin (arche), into an apparently ungrounded and immis- cible pluralism, an unbalanced anarchy, the multiple and expansive one-sided interestedness of which threatens the very well-being of Western man, both individually and collectively. It is a precipitous momentum to which even the institutions of learning contribute their energies: And even the institutions, which should develop these ["cul- ture, and the harmonious perfection of our whole being, and 12.

Just as the free churches of Mr. Beecher or Brother Noyes, with their provincialism and want of centrality, make more Hebraisers in religion, and not perfect men, so the university of Mr. Ezra Cornell, a really noble monument of his munificence, yet seems to rest on a misconception of what cul- ture truly is, and to be calculated to produce miners, or engi- neers, or architects, not sweetness and light (CA, 244-45) Indeed, so inscribed is the mystified paradigm of the centered circle in Arnold's consciousness that it precludes any intuition of the possibility that the explosion of knowledge in nineteenth-century England and the ensuing cultural/political dispersal may have been in large part the ontological consequence of the perennial recuperative humanistic effort to circumscribe, contain, and comprehend the expansive play of difference in being, language, culture, and society within its orbit. To put it another way, Arnold's problematic blinds him to the possibility that interest, properly understood - de-colonized, as it were - is the authentic agent of the freeplay of mind, the dialectical process that, interesse ("in the midst"), always makes a difference in the world. Thus, beginning with the metaphysical binary interpretation of the open and disconcerting ambiguities, the mystery of being-in-the- world - "Culture [or] Anarchy," civility or barbarism, sanity or mad- ness, light or darkness, and, perhaps, West or East - Arnold meets the challenge of proliferation by substituting a "new" (which is, in fact, an older) center for the divine Logos which the intellectual and political his- tory of his century had de-centered and rendered untenable. Without ever pausing to interrogate the fundamental ideological assumptions of the old broken instrument (onto-theology) or the ideological sources of his commitment to "disinterested" inquiry - the imperative "to see life steadily and to see it whole"'s - he insistently reaffirms the 13. This phrase, which recurs again and again in Irving Babbitt's and I.A. Richards's discourse is, of course, from Matthew Arnold's poem "To a Friend," cele- brating (his Apollonian version of) Sophocles's tragic vision: "But be his/ My special thanks, whose even-balanced soul/ From first youth tested up to extreme old age/ Business could not make dull, nor passions wild;/ Who saw life steadily, and saw it whole;/ The mellow glory of the Attic stage,/ Singer of sweet Colonus, and its child" 19</page><page sequence="14">20 William V. Spanos abiding "touchstones" of the logocentric humanistic mind - "the best that has been thought and said in the world [by which, as the omis- sion of reference to any other makes clear, he means the Western world]" (CA, 233).14 This recentering, this restoration of a common body of knowledge grounded on the anthropomorphic logos, is, according to Arnold, the one thing necessary (CA, 123) (porro unum est necessarium, CA, 176-91) for recuperating from the "social disintegra- tion" and anarchic darkness of"doing as one likes" (CA, 115-36) the totalized and totalizing harmony of culture and the repose - the "aerial ease, clearness, and radiancy" of the "sweetness and light" (CA, 167) - it promises its highly serious possessors. But the site of this recuperative activity that would reduce the du- plicitous or ludic possibilities of decenteredness to an authorizing Unus, is not, as it is usually understood to be, restricted simply to the site of cultureper se. For this "one thing necessary," this enlightening and saving normative discipline, is discovered to be "the principle of authority" that, however unevenly developed, necessarily and simul- taneously extends into and comprehends knowledge at all the sites on the continuum of being, from being itself to language, culture, and socio-politics. "Culture" as right reason becomes the principle of authority for the recuperation of the "Establishments" (CA, 238), disin- tegrating under the hammers of the emergent class-consciousness of the proletariat (the "other" in its socio-political manifestation), which reflect the "main stream of national life" (CA, 249) and which alone are capable of producing truly cultured human beings, who, in turn, alone can renew their vitality and authority: Now, if culture, which simply means trying to perfect one- self, and one's mind as part of oneself, brings us light, and if (Poetical Works, ed. L.B. Tinker and H.F. Lowry [London: Oxford University Pressl. 2). Since it has become by this time a cliche of humanistic discourse and pedagogy, one of the purposes of this essay will be to interrogate the usage of Arnold's mystified formula in order to disclose its figural and ideological origins that habituation and sedimenta- tion have concealed. 14. Although much could be said about Arnold's ethnocentric humanism at this point, I postpone comment until my discussion of I.A. Richards. For history made Richards far more aware of European cultural provincialism and thus compelled him to "open up" the Arnoldian canon to accommodate the best that has been thought and said in other than Western nations.</page><page sequence="15">Modern Humanist Education light shows us that there is nothing so very blessed in merely doing as one likes, . . that the really blessed thing is to like what right reason ordains, and tofollow her authority, then we have got a practical benefit out of culture. [This is in response to the positivist charge that Arnold's "culture" was a dilettante's eva- sion of the socio-political imperatives of the human world.] We have got a much wanted principle, a principle ofauthority, to counteract the tendency to anarchy which seems to be threatening us. But how to organize this authority, or to what hands to entrust the wielding of it? (CA, 123; my emphasis) And the too-assured (because logically "necessary") answer Arnold gives to these questions provoked by the threatening darkness of class conflict - an answer whose tautological argument is invariably over- looked in the selective mnemonic process of those sympathetic hu- manist commentators who identify Arnold with disinterested inquiry - is "to rise above the idea of class to the idea of the whole community, the State" (CA, 134). In a democracy of"ordinary selves" which "do not carry us beyond the ideas and wishes of the class to which we happen to belong," we are "separate, personal, at war" (CA, 134). In contrast to the anarchic mul- tiplicity and darkness of such a partial or de-centered orientation, Arnold's "State," "so familiar on the Continent and to antiquity" (CA, 117), derives from the "best self," i.e., the "proper," cultured self, through which "we are united, impersonal, at harmony": We are in no peril from giving authority to this, because it is the truest friend we all of us can have; and when anarchy is a danger to us, to this authoritywe may turn with sure trust. Well, and this is the very self which culture, or the study of perfec- tion, seeks to develop in us; at the expense of our old un- transformed self, taking pleasure only in doing what it likes or is used to do, and exposing us to the risk of clashing with every one else who is doing the same! So that our poor culture, which is flouted as so unpractical, leads us to the very ideas capable of meeting the great want of our present embarrassed times! We want an authority, and we find nothing but jealous classes, checks, and a deadlock; culture suggests the idea of the State. We find no basis for a firm State-power in our ordinary selves; cul- ture suggests one to us in our best self. (CA, 134-35) 21</page><page sequence="16">22 William V Spanos Arnold's use of the first person plural pronoun in this passage indeed, in his discourse at large - ostensibly refers to every individual member of the human community ("we all of us"). But close attention to the particular contexts of this usage reveals that, in fact, it refers to no one in particular. The "we" as "our best self" is the supra-historical abstract standard or representational model (arche and telos) that Ar- nold "derives" from the texts privileged by the Western (humanistic) Tradition and would impose, by way of "the State," as the measure of human practice in the volatile historical world of late nineteenth- century England. To put it another way, attention to the referential slides in Arnold's use of the inclusive first person plural pronoun dis- closes, in fact, a magisterial We, speaking to and in behalf of the mem- bers of the culturally and socio-politically dominant classes threatened by the emergent class consciousness and newly discovered desires of those whom the privileged have traditionally repressed: the "Popu- lace," as Arnold contemptuously calls them: But that vast portion, lastly, of the working class which, raw and half-developed, has long lain half-hidden amidst its poverty and squalor, and is now issuing from its hiding-place to assert an Englishman's heaven-born privilege of doing as he likes, and is beginning to perplex us by marching where it likes, meeting where it likes, bawling what it likes, breaking what it likes, - to this vast residuum we may with great propriety give the name of Populace. (CA, 143) The "we," in other words, which simultaneously speaks in the interest of the privileged minority and "for" the "vast residuum" of the weak is, in fact, a "we" which differentiates itself from the "other" in order to contain and pacify "them." As the "organ of our collective best self, our national right reason" (CA, 136), Arnold's "State" thus becomes the dominant culture's teleologically justified agency of forcing the imper- fect "ordinary" (real) selves of the Barbarians, Philistines, and Pop- ulace towards their actualization and fulfillment in the (hierarchical) "best self and of punishing those who fail or resist": the state, Arnold writes, is "the nation in its collective and corporate character, entrust- ed with stringent powers for the general advantage, and controlling individual wills in the name of an interest wider than that of indi- viduals" (CA, 117). For all his seductive rhetoric about the sweetness and light of the State as our best self, this, finally, is what Arnold means</page><page sequence="17">Modern Humanist Education by his reiterated assertion that "the State" is "our [true] centre of light and authority" (CA, 134).'5 As the innocent rhetoric that insistently equates light and authority (power) over the "Other" suggests, Arnold's sedimented language thus betrays its alleged disinterestedness to conceal a center elsewhere - the "paramount authority of a commanding best self, or right reason" (CA, 147; my emphasis) - which, from that distanced vantage point, is both immured and immune to the freeplay of criticism and actively determinative in the disposition, distribution, and hierarchization of everything in time and space that it surveys. It is no accident that one of the most reiterated maxims in Arnold's sententious prose is "Semper aliquid certi propenum": "Always some certain end must be kept in view." And since this center of light and authority, this disinterested "best self;" is "the State," his discourse also suggests that such a state is, finally, the re-collective or panoptic, and thus disciplinary, state. It is the state that actualizes in history the metaphysical consciousness, which, in assuming the End to be ontologically prior to process, Iden- tity to difference,justifies the coercion of anything that threatens to an- archize the arche, de-center the center. There is, then, no room in the viciously circular (metaphysical or speculative) space of Arnold's prob- lematic for linguistic, cultural, and socio-political questions - ques- tions related to the second term of the binary opposition of his epis- temology, literary and cultural criticism, and politics which his prob- lematic colonizes by placing them in the larger design of "our best self"'6 - that would disrupt its still movement. 15. Arnold makes this equation twelve times in the chapter of Culture and Anarchy entitled "Doing as One Likes." 16. I am appropriating the term "problematic" from Louis Althusser, For Marx, tr. Ben Brewster (London: New Left Books, 1977). See, especially, "On the Young Marx," 66 ff. In Althusser's discourse, "problematic" refers to the unconsciously prescribed limits of the kind of questions that an ideologically determined mode of inquiry can ask and thus the answers it can get. As an obvious example of the blindness of Arnold's "Classical" (or "Spatial") problematic I refer the reader not simply to his exclusion from the canon of that improvisatory romantic poetry which he can only perceive as debilitatingly partial in its inability to convey a "total-impression," but also to his ruth- less excision of"Empedocles on Aetna" from his collected poems for not resolving its negative partialities into an enjoyable and consoling whole. See "Preface," Poetical Works, xvii-xxx. What I have been saying about Arnold's problematic - specifically, about the binary oppositions of his metaphysically ordained humanism - is put as follows by Michel Foucault in "Revolutionary Action: 'Until Now'" (an interview), 23</page><page sequence="18">24 William V. Spanos Arnold's State, in other words, is not simply a state of mind, a mental model for the ordering of consciousness, of philosophical and literary discourse, of culture, as we have been led to think by his humanistic progeny's tendency to fix Arnold's discourse at the site of "Culture." It is also and simultaneously a political state. To be specific, it is, as the naturalized supernatural metaphorics of his discourse suggest, an idealization of the "main stream of the national life" of nineteenth- century England: i.e., the liberal middle class/capitalistic allotrope of the original ontological state, the circular geometry of which is designed to annul and domesticate the force of difference, above all at this his- torical conjuncture, the class consciousness of the working class and, when that proves impossible, to repress its overt disruptive manifes- tations unflinchingly in the name of the rule of "right reason," the anthropological supplement of the Anglican Logos. Like the ideal "author" of a "classical" text written for a later nineteenth-century theater, "the State" is authorized by its non-existent (ideal) model, the best self, to do violence to whatever deviates from or threatens to subvert or deconstruct its re-presentative end - its teleologically ordained progress towards/return to "perfection" - even if such gestures of confrontation are undertaken in the name of fundamental human rights. This becomes grimly manifest in the "Conclusion" of Culture and Anarchy, which, because it brings to explicit resolution the binary opposite metaphorics of circle/panopticism/power invaribly overlooked in canonical accounts of Arnold's Humanism, needs quoting at length: For we have seen how much of our disorders and perplex- ities is due to the disbelief, among the classes and combina- tions of men, Barbarian or Philistine, which have hitherto gov- erned our society, in right reason, in a paramount best self; to the Language, Counter-Memory, Practice: "By humanism I mean the totality of discourse through which Western man is told: 'Even though you don't exercise power, you can still be a ruler. Better yet, the more you deny yourself the exercise of power, the more you submit to those in power, then the more this increases your sovereignty,' Human- ism invented a whole series of subjected sovereignties: the soul (ruling the body, but subjected to God), consciousness (sovereign in a context ofjudgment, but subjected to the necessities of truth), the individual (a titular control of personal rights subjected to the laws of nature and society), basic freedom (sovereign within, but accepting the demands of an outside world and 'aligned with destiny'). In short, humanism is everything in Western civilization that restricts the desirefor power.. ."

But for us, - who believe in right reason, in the duty and possibility of extricating and elevating our best self, in the progress of humanity towards perfection, - for us the frame- work of society, that theatre on which this august drama has to unroll itself, is sacred; and whoever administers it, and how- ever we may seek to remove them from their tenure ofadminis- tration, yet, while they administer, we steadily and with undi- vided heart support them in repressing anarchy and disorder; because without order there can be no society, and without society there can be no human perfection. (CA, 222-23) What we discover in Arnold's privileged principle of "disinterested inquiry" is not the promised "sweetness and light," but the gall and darkness (for the unprivileged) it would alleviate in the name of the recuperation of"Culture," the naturalized supernatural state or earth- ly paradise of the nostalgic humanistic consciousness. We discover "disinterestedness" to be an instrument of repression (his own word) not simply of something as philosophically abstract as ontological errancy, but also as politically concrete as social protest in behalf of the right to vote: And this opinion of the intolerableness of anarchy we can never forsake, however our Liberal friends may think a little rioting, and what they call popular demonstrations, useful sometimes to their own interests and to the interests of the valuable practical operations they have in hand, and however they may preach the right of an Englishman to be left to do as far as possible what he likes, and the duty of his government to indulge him and connive as much as possible and abstain from all harshness of repression. And even when they artfully show us operations which are undoubtedly precious, such as the abolition of the slave-trade, and ask us if, for their sake, foolish and obstinate governments may not wholesomely be fright- ened by a little disturbance, the good design in view and the 25</page><page sequence="20">26 William V.

(CA, 223; my emphasis)'7 17. Arnold is alluding generally to the massive worker's rallies organized inJuly 1866 by the Reform League (under the radical leadership of Edmond Beales, Charles Bradlaugh, and Lt. Col. Lothian Sheffield Dickson) in behalf of Electoral Reform. The central event to which Arnold refers is what he calls the "Hyde Park riots." OnJuly 23, 1866, the Reform League organized a massive protest demonstration to be held at Hyde Park, which was prohibited by the Commissioner of Police, Sir Richard Mayne, under the instructions of the Home Secretary, Spencer Walpole, and the Conservative cabinet. Determined to hold their meeting, the workers defied the prohibition, broke down the iron railings, and entered the Park. Although the government called out troops, an engagement did not occur and the demonstration took place. When Arnold's editors explained his "topical allusions" (as they are usually called in the "Notes" to their editions of his texts), events such as this one, for all their ostensible factuality, are invariably interpreted from Arnold's point of view. This is pervasive, for example, in the "Critical and Explanatory Notes" to The Complete Prose Works of Matthew Arnold, edited by R. H. Super. There is, of course, no way to verify this charge in a footnote, but its validity can be suggested by pointing to Super's insistent, however naive, use of Arnold's pejorative rhetoric in his "factual" account of the events referred to above: "The Reform League organized a monster meeting for Hyde Park onJuly 23, 1866 .. ." (384-85); "At one point two companies of the Guards were called out, but the soldiers did not come into actual conflict with the people. Rioting was resumed the next day [there is an incredible - and eloquent - gap between those two casually articulated sentences] and windows in the Athenaeum Club, of which Arnold was a member, were broken. .." (385); "Edmond Beale (1808-81) was president of the Reform League during its short and prosperous life (1865-69) and organizer of the monster rallies on behalf of reform in July, 1866" (420). For a significantly different representation of these same events ofJuly 1866, see Raymond Williams, "A Hundred Years of Culture and Anarchy," Problems in Materialism and Culture: Selected Essays ((Lon- don: New Left Books, 1980), 3-10. What Arnold and his "disinterested" editors call "monster rallies," for example, Williams refers to as in terms of an effort "to establish the right of free assembly (4). This question of"Explanatory Notes" to historical texts which traditional scholars have taken naively for granted becomes, in the context of an emergent neo-materialist literary criticism, an enormously important issue for scholarship, one that needs intensive interrogation. For it is precisely in the historical allusions relegated to dubiously factual footnotes by traditional humanistic scholars who worry about the contamination of the Universality of their texts by the density of particular history - what I would call their occasion - that we discover the worldliness of the text and its cultural and socio-political affiliations.</page><page sequence="21">Modern Humanist Education In the concluding pages of Culture and Anarchy, where he returns specifically to the theme of education, Arnold assumes in the rhetoric of the "detached" majesterial "We" an assurance which must certainly have its source in what Foucault would call the panoptic gaze: Every one is now boasting of what he has done to educate men's minds and to give things the course they are taking. Mr. Disraeli educates, Mr. Bright educates, Mr. Beales educates. We, indeed, pretend to educate no one, for we are still engaged in trying to clear and educate ourselves. But we are sure that the endeavour to reach, through culture, the firm intelligible law of things, we are sure that the detaching ourselves from our stock notions and habits, that a more free play of conscious- ness, an increased desire for sweetness and light, and all the bent which we call Hellenising, is the master-impulse even now of the life of our nation and of humanity, - somewhat obscurely perhaps for this actual moment, but decisively and certainly for the immediate future; and that those who work for this are the sovereign educators. (CA, 229; my emphasis) Understood in terms of the logocentrism that authorizes the panoptic geometry of the centered circle, Arnold's dream of restoring the Hel- lenistic spirit to modem educational theory and practice turns out not simply to be inadequate to the challenge of the Benthamism of T.H. Huxley and Theodore Spencer - of Science and capitalism and the liberal socio-political superstructure which these sanction, energize, and elaborate. Finally, his poetic humanism turns out to be com- plicitous with them, and not simply in the sense of inculcating an aloof quietism. To adapt Foucault's Nietzschean critique of power in the disciplinary society of the post-Enlightenment to the context of Culture and Anarchy, in which the "sacred" and "sovereign" State is made the luminous and'illuminating fixed center, the unmoved mover, of the cultural circle, Arnold's humanistic educational project does not rep- resent an alternative to scientific positivism. It constitutes, rather, a replication on a different register of the Enlightenment's transforma- tion of metaphysical oversight into a calculative panopticism. Despite its humane pretensions, it becomes, in fact, a mechanism of super- vision, domination, and mastery - of re-formation - grounded in an anthropological Norm established in the image of the dominant bourgeois/capitalistic culture: the "proper self." It becomes, in other 27</page><page sequence="22">28 William V. Spanos words, a polyvalent optics - an Apollonianism, as it were - designed to assimilate or de-differentiate and pacify what, in the certainty of his binary logic, Arnold takes to be errant, deviant, eccentric, "mon- strous," not simply at the ontological site but all along the continuum of being, especially at the sites of culture and socio-politics. As Edward W. Said puts it: Even as an ideal for Arnold, culture must be seen as much for what it is not and for what it triumphs over when it is conse- crated by the State as for what it positively is. This means that culture is a system of discriminations and evaluations ... for a particular class in the State able to identify with it; and it also means that culture is a system of exclusions legislated from above but enacted throughout its polity, by which such things as anarchy, disorder, irrationality, inferiority, bad taste, and immorality are identified, then deposited outside the culture and kept there by the power of the State and its institutions. For if it is true that culture is, on the one hand, a positive doctrine of the best that is thought and known, it is also on the other a dif- ferentially negative doctrine of all that is not best. If with Michel Foucault we have learned to see culture as an insti- tutionalized process by which what is considered appropriate to it is kept appropriate, we have also seen Foucault demon- strating how certain alterities, certain Others, have been kept silent, outside or - in the case of his study of penal discipline and sexual repression - domesticated for use inside the culture. 8 Committed with such sovereign certitude to his enlightening pro- blematic, it was inevitable that Arnold should have failed to see that his insistent prescription to "see life steadily and to see itwhole" as a "cure" '9 18. Edward W. Said, "Introduction: Secular Criticism," The World, the Text, and the Critic (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1983), 11. 19. In line with the central terms ofArnold's binary metaphorics, the word "cure" and its synonyms recur insistently in his texts, designating him as pharmakos and his "disinterested inquiry" as the remedy for the disease of partiality and the threat of anarchy. For example, "But now to evince the disinterestedness which culture teaches us. We have seen the narrowness generated in Puritanism by its hole-in-the-corner organization, and we propose to cure it by bringing Puritanism more into contact with the main current of national life. Here we are fully at one with the Dean of West- minster; and, indeed, he and we were trained in the same school to mark the narrow- ness of Puritanism, and to wish to cure it" (CA, 245).</page><page sequence="23">Modern Humanist Education for the threat of anarchy was, in fact, grounded on the assumption that "life" was informed by apresence that transformed high seriousness into an undeviating will to power and inquiry into a panoptic or spatializing economy, the function of which was to in-clude and reduce the infinite play of difference within and to the comprehensive circle of Identity. To put it another way, it was inevitable that his humanistic insight should blind him to the fact that "disinterestedness" - "the freeplay of consciousness" - was in Derrida's words, a"play ... constituted on a fundamental immobility and a reassuring certitude which itself is beyond the reach of play," and that, therefore, such a"master-impulse even now of the life of our nation and of humanity" could only legitimate, indeed, reinforce, the hegemonic aspirations of the English (and European) middle class and exacerbate the social and political disruptions at home and abroad he was trying to remedy. Despite the different reality to which contemporaries or near contemporaries like Dickens, Dostoevsky, and Melville, to say nothing about the Young Hegelians, Kierkegaard, or Marx and Engels, or Nietzsche, were bear- ing witness, Arnold's Apollonian "vision" precluded awareness not simply of the repressive praxis authorized by the imperative of high seriousness. It also precluded the possibility that the "confusion" and "perplexity" he said he saw everywhere - in language, culture, soci- ety, government - were, in fact, the retaliation of an alienated being (the "Other") against the enlightened logic of reification, against the anthropomorphic Western eye's will to power over its energies: in short, of a repressed Dionysus against the privileged Apollo, the god of high seriousness. III The true Greek ... put his final emphasis, as befitted a child of Apollo, not on intoxication but on the law of measure and sob- riety - on preserving the integrity of his mind, to render literally the Greek word for the virtue that he perhaps prized most [EwparuprT]. One must indeed remember that alongside the Apollonian element in Greek life is the orgiastic or Dyonisiac [sic] element. But when Euripides sides imaginatively with the frenzy of Dionysus, as he does in his "Bacchae," though osten- sibly preaching moderation, we may affirm that he is falling 29</page><page sequence="24">30 William V. Spanos from what is best in the spirit of Hellas and revealing a kinship with the votaries of the god Whirl. Irving Babbitt, Rousseau and Romanticism To invoke an example closer to the American context, the centered circle also informs the discourse on higher education of Irving Babbitt, the Professor of French Literature who, in the first decades of the cen- tury, attempted to transplant Matthew Arnold's recuperative archival message into the Harvard garden which the "Rousseauistic" presi- dent, Charles William Eliot, had allowed to go to seed by introducing the elective system. Like Arnold in Culture and Anarchy, Babbitt in Litera- ture and the American College (1908) interprets the "present" on the anal- ogy of the fall of a previous "golden age," especially classical Greece and the Renaissance, into a proliferating anarchy. The contemporary situation, according to Babbitt, is the result of a deracination of a prior fixed center - an "ideal" and static state of organic unity and balanced sanity - into a degenerative or decadent kinesis. Greece, for example, "having lost its traditional standards through the growth of intellectual skepticism, fell into a dangerous and excessive mobility of mind be- cause of its failure to develop new standards that would unify its life and impose a discipline upon the individual."20 Similarly, the modern age comes "at the end of an era of expansion" (LAC, 219) characterized by intellectual and political deviance whose exorbitance threatens to unleash a material and emotional barbarism that will overwhelm the circle of thepolis. Under the impetus of the "scientific naturalism and humanitarianism" (LA C, 35) of Francis Bacon and, above all, the "sen- timental naturalism" (LAC, 35) ofJean-Jacques Rousseau, whose anti- classical "eccentricity" (LAC, 228) instigated "the most powerful insur- rection the world has ever seen against every kind of authority" (LAC, 184), the present age has fallen out of orbit.2' "Now, as then [he is refer- ring to the Renaissance]," Babbitt observes in a rhetoric that recalls but goes beyond Arnold's "soft" authority, "there is a riot of so-called 20.

It is this critique of scientific and emotional humanitarian naturalism - the humanitarian and sentimental impulses - that affiliates Babbitt's "New Humanism" with the "anti-humanist" humanism ofT.E. Hulme, Wyndham Lewis, T.S. Eliot, and, ultimately, the New Critics, especially Allen Tate and Cleanth Brooks. See especially, T.E.

In the name of this originality art is becoming more and more centrifugal and eccentric. As the result of our loss of standards,... we are inbreeding personal and national peculiarities and getting farther and farther away from what is universally human" (LA C, 219-20 and 230; my emphasis). This eccentricity, it is important to emphasize, is not simply a matter of idiosyncratic behavior. For Babbitt, the mean- ing of this key word resonates back and forth from the spatial figure - the geo-metry, as it were - informing its etymology. What he literally visualizes when he uses the word is an action that takes place outside the circumference of a circle, the border of an enclosure. This is implicit everywhere in Literature and the American College, but it is most explicitly stated in Rousseau and Romanticism (1909): ... the Rousseauist tends... to repudiate the very idea of an ethical centre along with the special forms in which it had got itself embedded. Every attempt, whether humanistic or reli- gious, to set up some such centre, to oppose a unifying and centralizing principle to expansive impulse, seems to him arbitrary and artificial. He does not discriminate between the ethical norm or centre that a Sophocles grasps intuitively and the centrality that the pseudo classicist hopes to achieve by mechanical imitation. He argues from his underlying assump- tion that the principle of variation is alone vital, that one's genius and originality are in pretty direct ratio to one's eccen- tricity in the literal meaning of the word; and he is therefore ready to affirm his singularity or difference in the face of whatever happens to be established.22 This proliferation of new knowledge and consequent differentiation of personal and cultural characteristics - this expansive de-centering, as it were - has its ultimate historical source, according to Babbitt, in the triumph of the Moderns in the querelle des anciens et modernes. In a way that recalls Arnold and, as we shall see, remarkably anticipates I.A. Richards, Babbitt attributes the dangerous "centrifugal" or "expan- sive" momentum which is taking us "farther and farther away from what is universally human"23 to the Romanticists' development of the 22. Irving Babbitt, Rousseau and Romanticism (New York: Meridian Books, 1955), 54-55. 23. Arnold uses the metaphor of expansion in an ambiguous way, implying at times the movement away from the center towards anarchy, and, at others, a process 31</page><page sequence="26">32 William V. Spanos historical method, "which has proven so powerful a solvent of both Christian and classical dogma" (LAC, 185; my emphasis). In discover- ing the strange and virtually immiscible languages and culture of the Far East, their inordinate "study of origins" has become the "means of undermining the classical orthodoxy" and its archivalized (and ethno- centric) rules of discourse and thus has precipitated cultural an- archy. Both The revelation of remote times and countries that were plainly cultivated, and yet in a way so strangely different from our own, had in it a potent suggestion of the new doctrine of relativity; it taught men to see - "Beyond their passion's widest range Far regions of eternal change." It helped him to feel that there was no standard of taste, as the classicists maintained, but a multiplicity of standards, each one justified by the special circumstances of its age and environ- ment. (LAC, 190-91) Assuming (his version of) the Greek standard and its binary meta- physical structure to be unquestionably natural and right, Babbitt, like Arnold (though more dogmatically) would thus return to "classical Greece" and its luminous idea of human being. For, as he says in Rousseau and Romanticism, "in the life of no other people perhaps does what is universal in man shine forth more clearly from what is only local and relative." For Babbitt, that is, the one needful thing in a world threatened by anarchy is the recuperation of Apollonian man: that rep- resentative (central) Man purged of and "set above the local and rela- tive" and thus capable of"detect[ing] this abiding element through all the flux of circumstance; in Platonic language, [of seeing] the One in the Many." Though Babbitt appeals to Aristotle in his interpretation of "Greece," it is, of course, the authority of Matthew Arnold's Victorian that includes and accommodates wider and wider areas of knowledge as the circum- ference of the centered circle expands. Babbitt, on the other hand, invariably under- stands this metaphor, which pervades his discourse, as the second (negative) term of a binary opposition in which the privileged first is concentration, an inward movement which, as the etymology suggests, intensifies the power and authority of the center over the circumference. This metaphorical opposition is, of course, an extension of Bab- bitt's insistent polarization of the "concentric" and "eccentric" and of "measure" and "measurelessness."</page><page sequence="27">Modern Humanist Education (English Middle Class and, as I will suggest, Imperialist) Aristotle that he is really invoking. Babbitt, that is, recalls Arnold's distinction be- tween the interested and erratic "ordinary self" and the "disinterested" center of light and authority, the "best self ": the polyvalent rule of pro- priety proper to the proper self. Like all the great Greeks Aristotle recognizes that man is the creature of two laws: he has an ordinary or natural self of impulse and desire and a human self that is known practically as a power of control over impulse and desire. If man is to become human he must not let impulse and desire run wild, but must oppose to everything excessive in his ordinary self, whether in thought or deed or emotion, the law of measure. This insistence on restraint and proportion is rightly taken to be of the essence not merely of the Greek spirit but of the classi- cal spirit in general. The norm or standard that is to set bounds to the ordinary self is got at by different types of classicists in different ways and described variously: for example, as the human law, or the better self, or reason ... or nature.24 Finally, this Victorian/Greek standard of the "best self" informs Bab- bitt's definition of humanism in Literature and the American College: We may perhaps venture to sum up the results of our search for a definition of humanism. We have seen that the humanist, as we know him historically, moved between an extreme of sym- pathy and an extreme of discipline and selection, and became humane in proportion as he mediated between these ex- tremes. To state this truth more generally, the true mark of excellence in a man ... is his power to harmonize in himself 24. Rousseau and Romanticism, 26-27. That Babbitt has Arnold in mind in these passages is made clear in his essay review of Stuart Pratt Sherman's Matthew Arnold: How to Know Him in The Nation, Vol. 105 (1917), 117-21. What he says about Aristotle in Rousseau and Romanticism he also - in virtually the same words - says here about Arnold: "But man, Arnold insisted, is the creature of two laws. In addition to his ordinary self of passing impulse and desires he has a permanent self that is felt in its relation to his ordinary self as a power of control.

By his ability thus to unite in himself opposite qualities man shows his humanity, his superiority of essence over other animlas. (LAC, 22) As the military metaphor suggests, what this achieved equilibrium of qualities means in practice is the hierarchization of Western binary logic, in which "selection" and "discipline" colonize and pacify "sym- pathy" or any other "impulse" or "desire" that threatens order. The "Classical" humanism Babbitt would have higher education inculcate in the young, in other words, is a recollected ethnocentric humanism purged not only of its later "humanitarian" accretions, but also, if more discreetly, of the new, "solvent" knowledge of remote times and nations: precisely those "others" (as opposed to "Us") pre- cipitated by the "historical method" (if not by the dynamics of tem- porality) and now precipitating the disruptive "mobility of mind," the "multiplicity of standards," and the de-viant and ec-centric intellectual and socio-political behavior that characterizes the Modern Age and threatens the well-being of humanity at large. Unlike Arnold, Babbitt expresses unusual interest in the question of East-West relations, hav- ing studied Sanskrit and Pali at Harvard and the Sorbonne and trans- lated the Buddhist Dhammapada from the Pali.25 Indeed, in a late text such as "Buddha and the Occident" (1927), he even criticizes Western imperialism and its assumption of cultural superiority over the East.26 But Babbitt's essential project vis-a-vis the Orient is from the beginning "classical." His purpose, that is, is to counter the Romantic poets' and philosophers' tendency to read the newly discovered artifacts of Orien- tal culture as furtherjustification for their commitment to the local, the strange, the exotic (i.e., to multiplicity and thus to the relativity of stan- dards) by accommodating Oriental thought and art, especially their will to transcend the temporal and local occasion, to his version of classical Greek humanism. Thus, for example, his insistent interpreta- tion of Buddha's dhamma as "human law, as one may render it, in con- tradiction to the law of physical nature";27 his preference for the early 25.

Like the texts of so many nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Western students of the Orient - Lane, Renan, Massignon, Gibb, for example - his is what Edward W. Said terms "Orientalist." Given Babbitt's insistent invocation of"rule," "standard," "norm" - the human "law of Measure" - it is no accident that he should privilege "representative human nature," which, in turn, precipitates an opposed rhetoric of otherness culminating in the "monstrous": Having decided what is normal either for man or some par- ticular class of men the classicist takes this normal "nature" for his model and proceeds to imitate it. Whatever accords with the model he has thus set up he pronounces natural or prob- able, whatever on the other hand departs too far from what he conceives to be the normal type or the normal sequence of cause and effect he holds to be "improbable" and unnatural, or even, if it attains extreme abnormality, "monstrous."30 This all-encompassing term, which we have also encountered in Ar- nold's discourse (it is basic to the discursive practice of the Enlighten- ment, according to Foucault) not only suggests the humanist's anxiety in the face of difference, but also, as the etymology of the word implies, his ultimate commitment to a self-leveling and homogenizing process that reduces the self to a "visible invisibility" in order to neutralize its susceptibility to violence from without. In Heidegger's term, Babbitt's representational humanism ends in the production of"public man": Das Man.3s 28. "Buddha and the Occident," 228. 29.

Spanos According to Babbitt, it was, of course, the "ordinary self," the "spontaneous play of impulse and temperament,"32 authorized by Rousseau and the cult of Romantic Genius, that precipitated the crisis of modern man. Thus to achieve balance and sanity, the humanistic "best self," Babbitt, like Arnold, calls for a reinstitution of the principle of disinterestedness. Within this balance and sanity, however, Identity is ontologically prior to and thus constitutes the condition of pos- sibility for difference, the One for the many; thus Babbitt's principle of impartiality is, like Arnold's, an interested disinterest: the supra- historical measure of "man as measure," introduced by the post- Socratic (metaphysical) Greeks and developed by the Romans, but having, for Babbitt, Christian theo-logical overtones: Man is a creature who is foredoomed to one-sidedness, yet who becomes humane only in proportion as he triumphs over this fatality of his nature, only as he arrives at that measure which comes from tempering his virtues, each by its opposite. The aim, as Matthew Arnold has said in the most admirable of his phrases, is to see life steadily and see it whole. (LAC, 23) Grounded in an unmoving center which simultaneously shapes what it encounters in the world and immune to the assaults of history (the critical difference that time disseminates), Babbitt's measure thus authorizes, indeed, demands, "the sense of form and proportion," "fastidious selection," "restraint," and, above all, "discipline." (This rhetoric of methodological power pervades Babbitt's reiterated invo- cations of measure). It is this centered, disciplinary standard, in fact, that constitutes the means and end of Culture: The very heart of the classical message, one cannot repeat too often, is that one should aim first of all not to be original, but to be human, and that to be human one needs to look up to a sound model and imitate it. The imposition ofform and proportion upon one's expansive impulses which resultsfrom this process of imitation is, in the true sense of that much abused word, culture.

In general, education should represent the conservative and unifying element in our national life. The college especially must maintain humane standards, if it is to have any reason at all for existing as some- thing distinct from university and preparatory school. Its func- tion is not, as is so often assumed, merely to help its students to self-expression, but even more to help them to become hu- mane. In the words of Cardinal Newman, the college is "the great ordinary means to a great but ordinary end"; this end is to supply principles of taste and judgment and train in sanity and centrality of view; to give background and perspective, and inspire, if not the spirit of conformity, at least a proper respect for the past experience of the world. (LAC, 240-41) The parallel, not only with Arnold's classical humanism, but also with Bentham's enlightenment-utilitarianism should by now be obvious. However "humane" the humanistic rhetoric that invests it, Babbitt's one needful thing in the face of a rampant Rousseauism is, finally, a totalitarian ideology: a panoptic instrumental measure based on an absolute origin which allows life to be seen steadily and seen whole. (One should not overlook the binary metaphysics of Sobriety/inebriation and its integral affiliation with that of Space/time in this Arnoldian for- mula.) As such it justifies the coercive circumscription and re-for- mation of the intemperate "natural" impulse of the "ordinary self " to deviate, the difference that characterizes the Other (which Babbitt's binary logic compels him to interpret as the fatal Adamic "one-sid- edness" of human beings), for the sake of saving Man from the fallen state of dispersal (into particular men and women): For most practical purposes, the law of measure is the supreme law of life, because it bounds and includes all other laws.... 37</page><page sequence="32">38 William V. Spanos Greece is perhaps the most humane of countries, because it not only formulated clearly the law of measure ("nothing too much"), but also perceived the avenging nemesis that over- takes every form of insolent excess (#{PPL) or violation of this law. (LAC, 24; my emphasis)34 As in Arnold's discourse, moreover, Babbitt's measure is informed by an ideology that is not limited to the cultural site, but extends into and affects every other site on the continuum of being, not the least, as we shall see, the sites of gender and of socio-politics. Given his undeviating commitment to the centrality and cir- cumscribing inclusiveness of the "law of measure," it was inevitable that Babbitt should interpret President Charles Eliot's anti-patriarchal and anti-archival introduction and encouragement of the "elective sys- tem" at Harvard (the immediate educational context of Babbitt's belated and rear-guard recuperative project in Literature and the Ameri- can College) as essentially "Rousseauistic." In Babbitt's eyes, Eliot's gen- erous, if finally too naive, accommodational opening up of the closed undergraduate curriculum to historical differences precipitated by an "era of [intellectual and socio-political] expansion" simply carries the disintegrative effects of a certain avant-garde painting and fiction into the domain ofpaideia: ... President Eliot speaks as a pure Rousseauist in a passage like the following: "A well-instructed youth of eighteen can select for himself a better course of study than any college 34. Since Babbitt, like Arnold, makes much of "high seriousness," which he puts insistently in terms of sobriety, it is worth pointing to the possible relationship in his mind, if not in the actual etymology, between "Hubris (tBPtL), that"insolent excess" that violates the law of measure, and "inebriation," that "wantoning of the imagina- tion" (Rousseau and Romanticism, 52), which is the consequence of devotion to "the god Whirl:" " 'Whirl is King,' cried Aristophanes, 'having driven out Zeus.' The modern sophist is even more a votary of the god Whirl than the Greek, for he has added to the mobility of an intellect that has no support in either tradition or insight the mobility of feeling .... Even more significant than the cult of vertigo is the closely allied cult of intoxication, 'Man being reasonable,' says Byron, with true Rousseauistic logic, 'must therefore get drunk. The best of life is but intoxication.' The subrational and impulsive self of the man who has got drunk is not only released from the surveillance of reason in any sense of the word, but his imagination is at the same time set free from the limitations of the real." (Rousseau and Romanticism, 147). Babbitt, in fact, virtually makes this connection between Spatial Perception and Sobriety, on the one hand, and tem- poral experience and inebriation, on the other, in Rousseau and Romanticism (167). See footnote 35 below, where the passage is quoted.</page><page sequence="33">Modern Humanist Education faculty, or any wise man who does not know him.... Every youth of eighteen is an infinitely complex organization, the duplicate of which neither does nor ever will exist." There is then no general norm, no law for man, as the humanist be- lieved, with reference to which the individual should select; he should make his selection entirely with reference to his own temperament and its (supposedly) unique requirements. The wisdom of all the ages is to be as naught compared with the inclination of a sophomore. Any check that is put on this inclination is an unjustifiable constraint, not to say an intoler- able tyranny. Now inasmuch as the opinions of even a "well- instructed youth of eighteen" about himself and his own ap- titudes are likely to shift and veer this way and that according to the impressions of the moment, we may, perhaps, designate the system that would make these opinions all-important, "educational impressionism." This inordinate exaltation of the individual sense as compared with the general or common sense of mankind scarcely ante-dates Rousseau. (LAC, 47- 48) Nor was it accidental that, against this infected and contagious "educational impressionism" which fed the decadent "centrifugal and eccentric" impulse of modern (Rousseauistic) man and exacerbated the breakdown of traditional hierarchical structures, Babbitt, like Arnold, should invoke the "healing Hellenic spirit" and reaffirm the study of the "classics" - a canonical core curriculum, as it were - which embody "the seasoned and matured experience of a multitude of men, extending over a considerable time, as to the studies they actually found helpful and formative" (LAC, 82). Given his "law of measure," it was inevitable that Babbitt should privilege literary texts that represent (and re-produce) the "proper" essence of(Western) Man to himself and should endorse a teleological history of literature that excluded, as inessential to or disruptive of this essence, the interested and relevant expression (occasioned by repressed desire) of the dif- ferences that time disseminates: "When books like the Greek and Latin classics have survived for centuries after the languages in which they are written are dead, the presumption is that these books themselves are not dead, but rather very much alive - that they are less related than most other books to what is ephemeral and more related to what is permanent in human nature. By innumerable experiments the 39</page><page sequence="34">40 William V. Spanos world slowly winnows out the more essential from the less essential, and so gradually builds up standards ofjudgment" (LAC, 82-83). These standards are, of course, archival standards - "rules of discursive for- mation," as Foucault would call them - which are alone capable of stemming the ("feminine") floodtide of the Rousseauistic dispersion. That is, in establishing the exclusive/inclusive "law of measure in the matters of the mind" (LAC, 137), the classics (that "golden chain of masterpieces which link together into a single tradition the more per- manent experiences of the race; books which so agree in essentials that they seem, as Emerson puts it, to be works ofone all-seeinggentleman" [LA C, 244; my emphasis] )35 inculcate, above all, "sanity and centrality of view" (LAC, 240) - a standard that both heals spiritual illness and facilitates the recuperation of the "manly" "assimilative powers of the mind" (LAC, 212; my emphasis). A study of this "core" or "canon" of classics then assures the reproduction and perpetuation of a cir- cumscribed, inclusive, unified, and hierarchical culture at the apex of which an elite cadre presides. It is not enough, according to Babbitt, to stigmatize American education simply "as 'receptive'... 'passive' or 'feminine' " as one German critic does. For this is "to overlook that humane endeavor which it is the special purpose of the college to foster. - that effort of reflection, virile above all others, to coordinate the scat- tered elements of knowledge, and relate them not only to the intellect but to the will and character; that subtle alchemy by which mere learn- ing is transmuted into culture" (LAC, 101). Ultimately and predictably, in reaffirming the core of classics and 35. It is interesting, because symptomatic, to note that Babbitt uses the same metaphor from Emerson over ten years later in Rousseau and Romanticism, p. 143. Bab- bitt, that is, is so committed from the beginning to the concentric end, that the process of his scholarship, criticism, and teaching precludes explorative inquiry in favor of what Pierre Macherey calls the "Normative fallacy" of confirmation according to which "the work shoulld be other than it is; its only reality is its relationship to the model which was the very condition of its elaboration. The work can be corrected and effectively modified by continuous comparison with the model which has an indepen- dent, a priori existence .... Hypothetically, the work is preceded. The unfolding of its text is mere fiction. The work can only advance towards an identity already fixed in the model. Whatever the chosen route, it will always be possible to imagine one shorter and better. Any reading, any detour is legitimate. The critical reading is the more direct, and because it is guided by anticipations of the model, it can move faster than the narrative . .. The literal narrative is irrelevant because it serves only to hide a se- cret and can be cast aside once this secret is revealed" (A Theory of Literary Production, 17- 18).</page><page sequence="35">Modern Humanist Education the assimilative powers of the mind it nourishes, Babbitt recuperates the "virile" meta-physical/patriarchal cultural Memory, which per- ceives the differential temporal process of human experience and his- tory (including literary prodlction) from after or above and thus is enabled to see or to supervise being all at once: "to see life steadily and see it whole!"36 In other words, Babbitt's Memory is the masterful - and "forgetful" - archival or recollective or monumental Memory of the dominant culture. Despite the substitutions of one center for another and the insistent interrogation of its authority by "marginal" writers like Euripides (whom Babbitt repeatedly derogates), Rabelais, Sterne, and the Brontes and thinkers like Heraclitus, Rousseau, Kier- kegaard and Nietzsche, this Memory supervises and determines in- quiry, poetry, interpretation, and pedagogy throughout the history of the West to Babbitt's present - from Plato through Aquinas to More, Descartes, Hegel, and Bentham; from Virgil through Dante to Balzac and T.S. Eliot; from Cicero through Castiglione and Elyot to Newman and Arnold. Finally, it represents be-ing and brings a (temporally) dis- seminated presence to stand in the (still) form of a treasured monu- ment: In short, the practical way of promoting humanism is to work for a revival of the almost lost art of reading. As a general rule, the humane man will be the one who has a memory richly stored with what is best in literature, with the sound sense per- fectly expressed that is found only in the masters. Conversely, the decline of humanism and the growth of Rousseauism has been marked by a steady decay in the higher uses of the mem- ory. For the Greeks the Muses were not the daughters of Inspiration or of Genius, as they would be for a modern, but the daughters of Memory. (LAC, 244)37 36.

The [Romanticl aesthete is plainly moving in an opposite direction; he is becomin:g more and more openly a votary of the god Whirl." 37. The influence of Babbitt's overview of the Western literary tradition as a con- tinuous whole authorized and presided over by a single, unified, and self-present "humanistic mind" on his recalcitrant pupil, T.S. Eliot, is readily recognizable, despite its greater sophistication and depth of vision, in the latter's famous and influential definition of the historical sense: ". .. the historical sense compels a man to write not merely with his generation in his bones, but with a feeling that the whole of the litera- ture of Europe from Homer and within it the whole of the literature of his own country 41</page><page sequence="36">42 William V. Spanos What the monumentalized classics ultimately teach, what the centered "humane endeavor" they instill in the student reproduces, is the supervisory and forgetful or repressive recollection of metaphysics, variously identified by the post-modern countermemory as a circulus vitiosis (Heidegger);38 "a play ... constituted on the basis of a fun- damental immobility and a reassuring certitude, which itself is beyond the reach of play" (Derrida); a paradigm of "Resemblance" (Fou- cault);39 a problematic of "expressive causality" (Althusser).40 They reproduce, that is, the panoptic will to power, which, in as-similating the "scattered elements of knowledge," not only coerces, levels, and ho- mogenizes the hetogeneity, the differences, of things-as-they-are (physis) into the shape of the same (homo), the dis-similarities of be-ing into the similarity of Being, multiplicity into the One (the total simul), time into simultaneity (space), but also simulates (re-presents and thus falsifies and alienates) the duplicity, the dis-simulation, that is, the "es- sence" of the errant and ludic truth of man's and woman's dispersed occasion, the truth, in Heidegger's term, notas correspondence, but as a-letheia. This will to power - this "mystery management," in Geoffrey Hartman's phrase - informing Babbitt's panoptic "assimilative schol- arship" explains the alienating violence he does to the literature he addresses, not only to those "eccentric" or "deviant" texts of Euri- pides, Rousseau, Wordsworth, Chateaubriand, or Baudelaire that he would exclude from the canon of humanistic "masterpieces," but also to those "centric" and "viant" classics of Plato, Aristotle, Sophocles, Montaigne, Burke, and Goethe, that he would reaffirm in behalf of the New Humanism.

As R.P. Blackmur puts it, in comparing Babbitt to WilliamJames ("a name chosen because it stood for the experimental, the ambiguous, the possible, all of which Babbitt detested"): He taught not by sympathy or persuasion or personality, by stretching the student's mind, but by force. He limited mind whereJames stretched it.... It was as if he taught music, and taught it magnificently, but only in the written score.... The figure is not as forced as it may sound: For what did he teach - what in all the enormous mass of literature that he read did he praise - but those great dead writers whose works we know precisely only as scores, with an imperfect clue to the notation even there, and which we cannot play at all. These are the writers whose ideas have survived and can be dealt with as formulas, as abstractions of the middle way, but whose poetry, what happened when their ideas got into drama, or got lodged in actuality, we must through ignorance for the most part let go by the board, unless in ourselves, in our own imaginations, in the literature of our own time, we can see the poetry refreshed. Sophocles is nothing without his violence; Antigone a mere mechanical fanatic without her folly; Creon an ineffectual rant- ing without his stupidity; Ismene a mere vapor without her double charge of fear and love. In short, the whole Greek drama is nothing but exemplary if we do not ourselves supply the violence, the folly, the stupidity, the mixture of fear and love. Babbitt was not only content with the exemplary, he in- sisted on its dominance at the expense of every other interest That is why he never seemed inside his examples.41 As in the case of Matthew Arnold, though far more overtly and forcefully - imperialistically, as it were - this inhumane and alienat- ing will to power, this impulse to discipline beginnings from the end, is enacted, however unevenly, at every site on the continuum of being, 41.

Spanos whatever the particular site Babbitt chooses to focus, by his utterly exemplary, exhausted, insistently graceless, tendentious, and judg- mental discourse. Its operation in Literature and the American College is not limited to the sites of literature, culture, and education; it also extends into the areas of gender and socio-politics, however marginal these apparently are to his main concern. One finds this will to power in Babbitt's peripheral attribution of the historical decline of the authority in college curricula of classical lan- guages and literatures to the emergence of a wide female readership (which he associates with the opening of institutions of higher learning to the utilitarian and opportunistic "multitude") that prefers modern (romantic) novels to Sophocles and Aeschylus or Plato and Aristotle: Modern languages ... have had little to do but succeed. They have benefited by their utilitarian appeal, and in the case of one's mother tongue by their appeal to sentiment. They have benefited by the constantly increasing influence of women in literature and education. As a substitute for Greek and Latin, they have attracted the vast multitude which in its choice of studies follows more or less consciously the line of least resis- tance.

These, after all, are within reach of the freeplay of criticism. It is, rather, as in the case of a number of passages quoted above from Literature and the American College, the phallocentrism that is inscribed in, yet hidden behind, Babbitt's "disinterested" inquiry. I mean the equation, as- sumed to be natural everywhere in his texts, of the feminine sensibility to the ec-centric and expansive impulse (the "Rousseauism"), that, he believes, threatens to overwhelm Western civilization and, converse- ly, of the "masculine" or "virile" principle to the classical spirit, the recuperation of which would save Western civilization: ... [Rousseau's] general readiness to subordinate his ethical self to his sensibility is indubitable. Hence the absence in his personality and writing of the note of masculinity. There is indeed much in his make-up that reminds one less of a man than of a high-strung impressionable woman. Woman, most observers would agree, is more natural in Rousseau's sense,</page><page sequence="39">Modern Humanist Education that is, more temperamental, than man. One should indeed always temper these perilous comparisons of the sexes with the remark of La Fontaine that in this matter he knew a great many men who were women. Now to be temperamental is to be extreme, and it is in this sense perhaps that the female of the species may be said to be "fiercer than the male." Rousseau's failure to find "any intermediary term between everything and nothing" would seem to be a feminine rather than a masculine trait. Decorum in the case of women, even more perhaps than in the case of men, tends to be a mere conformity to what is established rather than the immediate perception of a law of measure and proportion that sets bounds to the expansive desires.42 As my epigraph for this section from Rousseau and Romanticism bears witness, Babbitt's subliminal rhetoric never lets readers forget that the inebriated devotees of Dionysus ("the god ofWhirl," who would usurp the authority of"sober" and "virile" Apollo) were the Bacchae. In- deed, it would not be an exaggeration to say that the phallocentric Male/female oposition constitutes the metaphorical configuration that comprehends and includes all the other pairs of his logocentric bi- nary logic. It should be obvious at this juncture that Babbitt's "virile" - in- deed, "virulent" - cultural discourse, however invested by the rhe- toric of liberality, betrays, like Arnold's (as well as Locke's and Mill's) classical liberalism, its affiliation with an essentially reactionary socio- politics. Like the American college, which, in the name of (Classical) Man, must inculcate the concentric disciplinary measure in its fallen - natural and expansive - students, so the State, governed by the "sav- ing remnant" in the name of the transcendental "best self," must purge the multitude of "natural" and "ordinary" selves of their nat- uralness and ordinariness. What is only implicit in Literature and the American College because of its peripheral thematic status becomes explicit in Democracy and Leadership (1924), a text written, not incidental- ly, in the aftermath of the Russian Revolution: The view that inspired our Constitution [as opposed to the Declaration of Independence] ... has much in common with 42. Rousseau and Romanticism, 130. 45</page><page sequence="40">46 William V. Spanos that of Burke. If the first of these political philosophies [that man has certain abstract rights] is properly associated withJef- ferson, the second has its distinguished representative in Washington. TheJeffersonian liberal has his faith in the good- ness of the natural man, and so tends to overlook the need of a veto power either in the individual or in the State. The liberals of whom I have taken Washington to be the type are less expan- sive in their attitude towards the natural man.Just as man has a higher selfthat acts restrictively on his ordinary self, so, they hold, the State should have a higher or permanent self, appropriately embodied in insti- tutions, that should set bounds to its ordinary selfas expressed by thepop- ular will at any particular moment. The contrast that I am es- tablishing is, of course, that between a constitutional and a direct democracy. There is an opposition of first principles be- tween those who maintain that the popular will should prevail, but only after it has been purified of what is merely impulsive and ephemeral, and those who maintain that this will should prevail immediately and unrestrictedly.43 Like Arnold, Babbitt invokes Edmund Burke in his apotheosis of the state as the embodiment of the "best self." But unlike Arnold's political discourse, on which Burke's concluding deconstruction of his critique of the French Revolution in "Thoughts on French Affairs" (December 1791) made a powerful and in a sense redemptive impact,44 Babbitt's, as the rhetoric of purification in this passage and elsewhere in his texts suggests, is so absolutely centered that it cannot allow any disruptive gesture to challenge it. Thus emptied out of ontological content, as Heidegger might say of his language, Babbitt's "virile" humanistic dis- course, for all its justified criticism of "standardized mediocrity of American Democracy," becomes in its pursuit of totalization in the face of the "Red Scare" the absolutely inclusive circle, an instrument - a technology, as it were - of something like totalitarian power: 43.

Cir- cumstances may arise when we may esteem ourselves for- tunate if we get the American equivalent of a Mussolini; he may be needed to save us from the American equivalent of a Lenin. Such an emergency is not to be anticipated, however, unless we drift even further than we have thus far from the principles that underlie our unionist tradition. The maintenance of this tradi- tion is indissolubly bound up with maintenance of stan- dards.45 Commenting on precisely this passage from Democracy and Leadership, R.P. Blackmur writes: One reflects how magnificently the notion of humility might have been modified by the notion of a free conscience as a refuge ["from the encroachments of the omnipotent state"], and likewise how the notion of humility (which in Babbitt consists partly in looking up in order to be safe in looking down, and partly in strenuous meditation) could have enriched the func- tion of the free conscience. Instead, Babbitt uses both to strike down the Civil Religion of Rousseau as sentimental and utili- tarian and in general a mere vanity of intellect. We can add for him, then, what he did not see, that as he did not possess grace neither did he possess the refuge of a free conscience, whether Christian or its equivalent. It seems almost superfluous to say that had he possessed either he could not have said that "Cir- cumstances may arise when we may esteem ourselves for- tunate if we get the American equivalent of a Mussolini; he may be needed to save us from the American equivalent of a Lenin." That the remark was made in 1923 eases its folly but 45. Democracy and Leadership, 311-12. 47</page><page sequence="42">48 William V. Spanos does not reduce either its arrogance, its extravagance, or its failure to understand American history which it implies. Even in 1923 the castor oil cure for political opposition was no more humanistic than it was humanitarian, and castor oil, street fighting, murder and sabotage of spirit, made up the features of fascist decorum. The point is, that Babbitt was willing to enslave his con- science in fact, to make it a prison rather than a refuge for individual liberty, at the dictation of a merely intellectual order.46 In thus exposing Babbitt's reactionary -I am tempted to say "Roman" - antipathy for democratic politics, Blackmur again bears witness to the exemplary will to power, the "lust for order" that in "contaminat- ing his mind"47 also contaminated his discourse from one end of the spectrum of being to the other. Unfortunately, though characteris- tically, Blackmur's purpose is not to interrogate humanism, but to dis- sociate an authentic (liberal) humanism from Babbitt's "castor oil cure for political opposition," a humanism which, unlike Babbitt's, would be a "refuge from the encroachments of the omnipotent state." Thus despite its "exposure" of the aggressive anti-democratic politics Bab- bitt was blind to, Blackmur's critique, insofar as it focuses on Babbitt's private conscience or "proper self," is itself blinded by its enabling problematic to the (semi-)autonomous, and hidden, power of human- istic discourse at large. More specifically, he "[does] not see" what a destructive criticism of Babbitt's humanism brings down into the dialogic arena of freeplay: the invisible "center elsewhere" that is simultaneously inside and outside all humanistic discourses and thus renders them - even those which constitute a "refuge for individual liberty" - in some degree or other, either positively or negatively, complicitous with a hegemonic politics of coercion. It is not simply that Blackmur's humanism as "refuge from the encroachments of the omnipotent state" leaves the "material interests"48 46. "Humanism and the Symbolic Imagination," 156-57. 47. "Humanism and the Symbolic Imagination," 154. 48.

However inadvertently, Blackmur's "refuge" is, finally, like Father Mapple's pulpit or Linnaeus's desk or Bildad's Protestant/Capitalist whaling office in Moby-Dick, an "impregnable" and "self-containing strong-hold - a lofty Ehrensbreitstein," im- mune from the disruptive freeplay of criticism, a commanding invis- ible wall behind which a "center elsewhere" does its coercive worldly work.49 Blackmur's influential critique of Herman Melville, which, more than anything else perhaps, set the attitude of a whole generation of literary critics towards his "errant art," bears witness to this. For, paradoxically, it is precisely Babbitt's structural model, if not the politics itjustifies, that Blackmur brings to bear in his harshly negative judgment of Moby-Dick and Pierre and the place of their author in the American tradition: The dramatic form of a novel is what holds it together, makes it move, gives it a center and establishes a direction ... we may think of different ways in which things go together in a given work, and strangely, the labor of abstraction and violation will be seen to deepen our intimacy with the substance of the work and, more valuable, to heighten our sense of how that substance is controlled. The sense of control is perhaps the highestform of apprehension; it is under- standing without immersion. The question we have here to ask then is how did Melville go about controlling his two novels, Moby-Dick and Pierre? The general, strictly true... answer would be: haphazardly - that is, through an attitude which varied from the arrogance of extreme carelessness to the humility of complete attention. It is not that he attended only to what seriously interested him,forhe was as careless of what he thought important as ofwhat he thought trivial, but,that apparently he had not sure rule as to what required management and what would take care of itself. His rule was vagary where consequential necessities did not determine otherwise.50 49. Herman Melville, Moby-Dick ed.

Blackmur may seem to be a digression, especially if one considers him, as I do, the most open, explorative, and intensely generous, the most post-Modern of the New Critics. If, however, it is remembered that my topic is hu- manism, not Irving Babbitt, per se, the significance of my thematiza- tion of the blindness of Blackmur's insight will become immediately apparent. It is, I suggest, the characteristic attribution to personal con- viction of the reactionary resonances of certain forms of humanism that allows "liberal humanists" to exclude an Irving Babbitt or a Paul Elmer More from their company without at the same time precipitat- ing self-interrogation of the assumptions inscribed in their own human- istic discourse. It is also their certain refusal to undertake such an interrogation of the rules of humanistic discursive practice that goes far to explain the perennially, and in the end futilely, recurrent effort to impose the Apollonian measure of restraint - "the inner check," as Babbitt and More call it - in "eras of expansion," in the face of the "disintegrating influence at work in modern life" (LAC, 239) and of the "eccentric and centrifugal scholarship" spawned and nurtured by "elective systems." This, in large part, accounts for the recent effort in and around Harvard University and elsewhere to rehabilitate Babbitt's reputation.51 This project, in other words, constitutes an overdeter- mined symptom of a renewed Apollonianism at the present historical conjuncture: not only of the reactionary response by leading human- ists of the literary establishment like M.H. Abrams, Wayne Booth, Denis Donaghue, and WalterJackson Bate to deconstruction, "critical theory," and that emergence of other areas of inquiry they mis- leadingly call "specialism," but also, more broadly, of the studied dis- regard by the authors of the "Harvard Core Curriculum Rep -'" (and the multitude of humanist teachers and administrators chey have encouraged) of the persuasive demystification of "disin :.rested" in- quiry by the post-structuralist counter-memory, to say nothing about the historical events of the Vietnam decade, above all, the student movement culminating in the "events of May 1968." 51.

I cannot emphasize too much the utter absence of irony in Richards' quotation. Helen Vendler, "I.A. Richards at Harvard" To bring the argument chronologically and genealogically closer to the Harvard Core Curriculum and to suggest the insistently sup- plementary continuity of the Apollonian ideal of modern humanistic liberal education, one need only recall the educational philosophy (and practice) of I.A. Richards. For Richards, it will be remembered, was not simply instrumental, with E.M.W. Tillyard, M.D. Forbes, and others, in effecting the "revolution" in English studies at Cambridge in the 1920's. He was also one of the principle influences (one of a com- mittee of eleven) in the shaping of the General Education Program at Harvard in the late 1940's to accommodate the knowledge explosion set off by World War II to liberal education; this was the Program, according to the "Core Curriculum Report," which was "eroded" by the "proliferation of courses" during the 1960's, the period of student protest against American aggression in Vietnam.52 However different and more attractive its surface, it is, as the following destruction of 52.

Spanos Speculative Instruments (1955) will disclose, an updated variation of the panoptic model of Arnold's and Babbitt's classical humanism that informs both Richards's understanding of language and poetics, on the one hand, and his analogous idea of the University and pedagogi- cal practice, on the other.53 Like Arnold's and Babbitt's, Richards's discourse, too, despite its avowed departure from Arnold's substitution of poetry for the Chris- tian religion as agency of human salvation, is an Apollonian discourse. It is fundamentally motivated, that is, by his anxiety in the face of the "promiscuous" dissemination of knowledge occasioned by an era of uncontrolled expansion, if not by a fall from a prior Golden Age. As he 53. In his essay, "A Free, Varied and Unwasteful Life: I.A. Richards's Speculative Instrument," Intellectuals at War: Genealogies and Intellectuals (New York: Columbia University Press, 1985), Paul Bove offers a parallel reading of Richards's literary criticism which persuasively discloses the integral (synoptic) relationship between Richards's understanding of the disciplinary reading of poetry (especially as it is articulated in Principles of Literary Criticism [1929] and in Practical Criticism [1931]) and university education in general. These two texts, it should not be forgotten, were the most influential in the production of the new theoretically questionable - if still actively and widely practiced - New Critical method of "close" or "intrinsic" reading and in the establishment of this rigorous disciplinary spatial hermeneutics as the method, not simply of literary study, but of encounter with virtually all semiotic sys- tems in the Anglo-American academy. "What is clear," Bove writes, "is that I.A. Richards and a great deal of Anglo-American academic criticism practiced after him as a discipline, that is, as an accumulative, cooperative project for the production of knowledge, the exercise of power, and the creation of careers, emerge with a degree of self-consciousness from this nineteenth century problematic [the orientation that authorizes literary criticism to "resist, master and control the mysterious multiplicity of language's inflationary proliferation"] and furthermore that it attempts to rebalance the disorderly functions of language, to reestablish a linguistic unity through and in an academic critical discipline which, somewhat belatedly, affiliates itself with and at the same time tries to master the other positive disciplines such as economics, psychology, medicine, and anthropology. To balance the complex machine of language Richards initiates a realignment of elements of critical method and rhetoric to deny the exis- tence of literature as a special sphere of language apart from all others because he urgently senses the inflation and differentiation of languages and language study as a threat to a balanced, sane, and healthy civilization." This homologous relationship between Richards's understanding of the discipline of literary interpretation and of university education is a decisive one which the compartmentalization of the con- tinuum of knowledge into disciplines has caused literary critics interested only in Richards's poetics to overlook. For, as Bove suggests, it points to the interest that ultimately informs the important, more or less universally required, introductory courses in "Literary Analysis" (i.e., close reading) that, in the name of objectivity, con- tinues to shape the interpretive mind set and judgmental norms of undergraduates, not only in literary study but in other "disciplines" as well.</page><page sequence="47">Modern Humanist Education warns in "The Future of the Humanities in General Education," exposure to the knowledge explosion constitutes a momentous threat to the balanced and healthy civilization: Minds have become more exposed than ever before. (If any point de- serves italics, this does.) And this exposure too is undergoing explosive increase. Mental and moral communications, within each culture and between cultures, have suddenly expanded beyond anyone's power to foresee the consequences. The agencies at work - with one exception - hardly need more than mention. They are mass education, with its stress on ver- bal or nominal literacy, motion pictures, radio, television, modern advertising, and - here is the exception - modern scholarship. These are the new forces which already expose every urbanized mind to a range and variety and promiscuity of contacts unparalleled in history .... There will at least be no doubt that this new mental exposure makes immense changes necessary in our conceptions of what the humanities have to do and how they can do it.(SI, 58-59).54 Like Arnold and Babbitt, Richards thus returns nostalgically - and filially - in his "initiatory" discourse to Plato's logocentric and hier- archical disciplinary model in The Republic. For only such a return to the "origin" of Western education is capable of recuperating the "disin- terested" ability to "see life steadily and see it whole,"55 and thus of sav- ing the ordered, balanced, comprehensive, and healthy society - the in-clusive society, impervious to irony and to the freeplay of criticism - from the futility and anarchy precipitated by the modern dispersal of a common body of traditional knowledge. Richards's "inclusive" society, in other words, is the socio-political analogue of the "disin- terested" and "inclusive" poem he and his New Critical heirs privi- 54. I.A. Richards, Speculative Instruments (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1955), hereafter cited as SI. The essays collected in this volume were written between 1940 and 1955, i.e., during the period of Richards's involvement in the development of the General Education Program at Harvard. Elsewhere in this essay, Richards refers to this dispersal of knowledge as "an illimitable proliferation ... of facts, comments, opinions, and mere phrases, too extensive and diverse to form, in any mind not of a rare order, any coherent, much less any directing or confirming, view of essential human purpose," 60. It needs to be said that Richards does not deny such a "directing or confirming view," only that the ordinary person cannot see it. 55.

Spanos leged over its interested "exclusive" binary opposite: There are two ways in which impulses may be organised: by exclusion and by inclusion, by synthesis and by elimina- tion .... The structures of these two kinds of experiences are dif- ferent, and the difference is not one of subject but of the relations inter se of the several impulses active in the experi- ence. A poem of the first group is built out of sets of impulses which run parallel, which have the same direction. In a poem of the second group the most obvious feature is the extraor- dinarily [sic] heterogeneity of the distinguishable impulses. But they are more than heterogeneous, they are opposed. They are such that in ordinary, nonpoetic, non-imaginative experience, one or other set would be suppressed to give as it might appear freer development to the others. The difference comes out clearly if we consider how com- paratively unstable poems of the first kind are. They will not bear an ironical contemplation .... Irony in this sense con- sists in the bringing in of the opposite, the complementary impulses; that is why poetry which is exposed to it is not of the highest order, and why irony itself is so constantly a charac- teristic of poetry which is. (my emphasis) 56 56. I.A. Richards, Principles of Literary Criticism, 249-50. The influence of Richards's definition on the New Critics can be seen in Cleanth Brooks's adoption of the distinc- tion between the exclusive and inclusive poem in Modem Poetry and The Tradition (New York: Oxford University Press, 1965), 41-47. The structure of balanced inclusion con- stitutes Richards's (and, however unevenly developed, the New Critics') ideal model for psyche, poem, culture, socius, state, etc. All these sites are implied in some degree or other in any particular one of his texts whether such a text is centrally about psychol- ogy, the principles of literary criticism, the pedagogy of literary interpretation, the idea of the university, culture, or national or international politics. Further, Richards's account of the ideal poem (and society) is an up-dating of Arnold's "disinterestedness," his Apollonian commitment against intellectual provin- cialism to seeing life steadily and seeing it whole. This becomes evident in the pages following his definition of the two kinds of poetry: "The equilibrium of opposed impulses, which we suspect to be the ground-plan of the most valuable aesthetic re- sponses, brings into play far more of our personality than is possible in experiences of a more defined emotion. We cease to be orientated in one definite direction; more facets of the mind are exposed and, what is the same thing, more aspects of things are able to affect us. To respond, not through one narrow channel of interest, but simultaneously and coherently through many, is to be disinterested in the only sense of the word which</page><page sequence="49">Modern Humanist Education 55 Given the privileged status of the visual metaphor informing Rich- ards's appropriation of Arnold's remedial prescription, it should come as no surprise that he insistently calls Plato's authorizing struc- tural model a "blue print" or, alternatively, an "organization chart": an instrument that, as Foucault reminds us, in miniaturizing and locat- ing vastness and multiplicity, became essential to the efficient practical operations of the new physics of the Enlightenment: The first of the great operations of discipline is... the con- stitution of 'tableaux vivants,' which transform the confused, useless or dangerous multitudes into ordered multiplicities. The drawing up of 'tables' was one of the great problems of the scientific, political and economic technology of the eighteenth century: ... these [botanical and zoological, economic, mili- tary, and medical systems of classification and organization] concerns us here. A state of mind which is not disinterested is one which sees things only from one standpoint or under one aspect. At the same time since more of our per- sonality is engaged the independence and individuality of other things becomes greater. We seem to see 'all round' them, to see them as they really are; we see them apart from any one particular interest which they may have for us. Of course without some interest, we should not see them at all, but the less any one particular interest is indispensable, the more detached our attitude becomes. And to say that we are imper- sonal is merely a curious way of saying that our personality is more completely involved" (251-52 [Richards's emphasis]). The seductive paradox informing this passage is dis- arming. But the crucial qualification, which Richards characteristically subordinates ("Of course without interest we should not see them at all") is an aporia that de- constructs the authority of the paradoxical definitions of"disinterestedness" and "im- personality." That is to say, it is the colonized voice of interest seeking its own articu- ation inside the rigid confines of the binary opposition between an absolutely positive disinterest and an absolutely negative (narrow provincial, exclusive, i.e., Hebraistic) engagement. Far from exonerating disinterestedness of its complicity with the will to power, Richards's definition bears witness against itself to his affiliation not only with Matthew Arnold's authoritarian discourse but also with the philosophers of the Enlightenment (including Bentham), who, according to Gadamer, reduced "interest" toprejudice and thus institutionalized this binary opposition between disinterested and interested or committed inquiry. It has been Gadamer's hermeneutic project (follow- ing Heidegger) to rehabilitate or de-colonize prejudice, i.e., as the interest which activates inquiry and, in turn, which is always already undermined and transformed by the disclosures of that inquiry. See Hans-Georg Gadamer, Truth and Method, tr., ed. by Garret Barden andJ. Cumming (New York: The Seabury Press, 1973): "The overcom- ing of all prejudice, this global demand of the enlightenment, will prove to be itself a prejudice, the removal of which opens the way to an appropriate understanding of our finitude, which dominates not only our humanity, but also our historical conscious- ness" (244).</page><page sequence="50">56 William V. Spanos were all twin operations in which the two elements - distribution and analysis, supervision and intelligibility - are inextricably bound up. In the eighteenth century, the table was both a technique of power and a procedure of knowledge. It was a question of organizing the multiple, of providing oneself with an instrument to cover it and to master it; it was a question of imposing upon it an 'order.'57 His visual/spatial metaphor betrays the degree to which Richards understands the educational institution as a technology of production based on the Benthamite panoptic schema: the disciplinary ideology of supervision that, in perceiving an always potentially anarchic, waste- ful, and disruptive multiplicity of individuals all-at-once, is enabled to spatialize, place, hierarchize, and regularize (correct or reform) them in the light of the teleological whole. It can (mass)produce a collectivity of individuals - "docile bodies," as Foucault would put it - who ultimately (willingly) exist in order to serve the ends of the State.58 Thus in "The Idea of a University," a speech delivered at Harvard in 1953, Richards interprets Plato's Republic as an inquiry into " 'What is Justice?' " which "comes down actually to an inquiry into 'What would a just man be?' and 'How could we produce him?' " (SI, 107). In re- sponse to these tautologically related questions (which pre-suppose each other's answer) vis-a-vis the achievement of thepolis, The Republic, according to Richards, lays out together an account of thejust man ["one with all his or her bits and parts and talents and abilities in their right place, doing their work and not getting in the way"] and an account of thejust society, an organization chart for man and for society: on the ground that we can hardly have a truly just man without a just society to produce him or a just society without just men to guide and guard it. (SI, 107; my emphasis, except for the first) Then, in an operation intended to bring Plato's polis "up to date," Richards substitutes "sane man" for "just man": It may freshen this up if we use 'sane' along with 'just.'

See especially the chapter entitled "Docile Bodies," Discipline and Punish, 135- 69.</page><page sequence="51">Modern Humanist Education man is a sane man - nothing out of order or unbalanced about him. Similarly, ajust society is one in which no faction, no pressure group, no self-interested power-seeker, can push the rest of the citizens around. In a just society all serve, not their aggrandizement, but the commonwealth. (SI, 107-108; my empha- sis) In this substitution or amplification, Richards's discourse further be- trays its affiliation with that strategy archivally inscribed by the En- lightenment, according to Foucault, in order to secure and legitimate the authority of the bourgeois capitalist version of civilized society: its definition of insanity as that which, point by point, sanity or normality is not; its in-clusion by binary ex-clusion and separation of the mad/ unjust man from the sane/just socius.59 Richards reduces Plato's more complex understanding of men and women to the familiar, simplistic, and thus manageable binary struc- ture which assumes all logo-centered thought and practice to be health- ful (formative or re-formative and balancing) and all de-centered thought and practice to be harmful (de-forming and unbalancing) to human "being," both in its individual and social capacities. In so doing, the belated son is enabled like his Harvard predecessor, Irving Babbitt, to justify a dynastic and "re-formist" or "recuperative" con- cept of education and political economy on the assumption that, however errant, the human will is "correctable" (curable) and on the "Normative" standard (of sanity/justice) as the agency of correction. Commending the breakthrough (by way of "Basic English") in the efficiency of teaching illiterates and non-Western peoples to read an alphabetic script, Richards writes in "Responsibilities in the Teaching of English," "if parallel improvements were worked out in the order- ing of higher level materials we could then develop what man so urgently needs: a common purposejointly understood. And this is the only remedy powerful enough to protect him from his suicidal forces - a multiplication of his intelligence and a reformation of his will through an operative knowledge of what he can be and should be" (SI, 93-94; my emphasis).60 59.

Spanos It is worth noting the by now familiar, urgent assertion of "the one needful thing" - the identical model as normative standard - in the face of potential social chaos. More important, however, is Richards's concomitant mystification of the metaphysical binary antitheses be- tween Order and chaos, Culture and anarchy, which, in the rhetoric of his literary and educational discourses, always assumes the form of the "Sanity/insanity" opposition. This mystification enables him to re- cuperate from rampant individualism or multiplicity a hierarchical, dynastic, and hegemonic educational structure characterized by the "remedial" Teacher/disciple relationship and to imply a homologous hierarchical and dynastic socio-political structure characterized by the Guardians/guarded (if not precisely the Master/slave) relationship, in which the therapeutic (disciplinary) instrument is the Norm or Stan- dard or Measure of Sanity/Justice. The end of this remedial correc- tional process, we recall, is the production of the just/sane man or woman, who, in his own words, is "one with all his or her bits and parts and talents and abilities in their right place, doing their work and not getting in the way." What Paul Bove says about Richards's "principles" and "practice" of literary criticism applies as well to his principles and practice of pedagogy at large: Richards' "Principles" and "Practice" of criticism not only make man as reader available for analysis as a means and object of discipline, but, by pursuing a balanced harmony of experience in perception and communication, they normalize individuals through comparison ... and they do this paradox- ically by creating different individuals precisely through com- parison and isolation. That is to say, this technique produces multiple individuals among whom discipline allows us to dis- criminate so that teachers and students can struggle for iden- tity in sameness. This identity is produced by the practical effect of the authority which judges "sane" and "normal" from "insane" and "unselfconscious" responses, but identity is pro- duced even more fundamentally by the praxis which incor- porates all the individuals within one modality of organization whole character to, mutualities among men and within communities, the study of language, even in the most elementary stages, has to be a dependent of that highest generic taping which may be called ethics. It is concerned - endlessly - with stan- dards and validity. It must be as normative through and through as, for example, the study of medicine" (Richards's emphasis).</page><page sequence="53">Modern Humanist Education and one set of criteria forjudgment .... Foucault, writing of the classical period's educational method for punishing the "shameful class" in French schools, offers a comment which I think both adequately represents the nature of Richards' achievement and suggests another aspect of his genealogy: "The perpetual penalty that traverses all points and supervises every instant in the disciplinary institutions compares, dif- ferentiates, hierarchizes, homogenizes, excludes. In short, it normalizes."61 It is, of course, "the University" - the repository of the "Norma- tive," "the best that has been thought and said in the world," the "Tradition" or "Core," "the Humanistic Measure," as itwere - which Richards decrees "the supreme organ in such a society for producing men and women able andfit to guard it: to guard it from foreign enemies (insane states) and still more from its bosom enemies, self-promoting powerseekers" (SI, 108; my emphasis). (According to the syntactical momentum of Richards's rhetoric, the dissymmetrical analogy con- ceals another, more fundamental enemy of the state: the deviant.) And the "recipe" the University must follow to achieve this pre-ordained end is predictably the following: Take the cream of the school crop, the hand-picked short-list, the most talented, liveliest, young men and women, the cou- rageous, untiring learners, and give them a long and all- important course. A course in what? Here is the course de- scription: "They will take the arts and sciences they have been educated in at school and put them into connection, in a com- prehensive synoptic view of their relations with one another and with what truly is." (Republic, 537) (SI, 108) This "comprehensive synoptic view," or, as Richards puts it in an essay proferring a more technical definition, this "over-all view," which is both grounded in and transmitted by an intellectual elite produced and reproduced by the University, is "inescapably NORMATIVE" (SI, 124).62 It conceives of a hermeneutic circle in which Being is onto- 61.

Spanos logically prior to temporality, Form to process, End to means, the Pan- optic Eye to all the other senses.63 In so doing, this methodologized version of Arnold's generalization about seeing life steadily and seeing it whole becomes a powerful instrument for effecting what Richards calls, echoing Francis Bacon, "this greatest instauration" (SI, 94): the "reformation of the [individual] will" and the analogous recuperation of the "healthy," the "sane," the "balanced," and the "just" State: "A Synoptic View therefore - truly Universal Study - would have more than police functions; it should be advisor-general and therapist as well" (SI, 124). Everywhere in his discourse on educational theory (as in his dis- course on poetics), Richards insistently emphasizes the inculcation of this steadying "comprehensive synoptic view" that simultaneously foresees ends, polices deviance, and cures psychological and social imbalance as the most important function of the modern University. This, according to Richards (in a rhetoric reminiscent of Arnold's and Babbitt's), is because the belated institutions of higher learning found- ed on Plato's synoptic model have not, in historical practice, pursued the integrating or assimilating imperatives of such an authoritative center: Very likely Plato's Academy (even in his lifetime as its Director) sought almost anything rather than the synoptic view. It is argu- able that his Socrates (of whom we know so little apart from Plato), that model he set up of the ideal University teacher, has in fact only taught people how to trip one another up and catch one another out rather than how to understand one another and use that understanding co-operatively to the common 63. For Richards's account of his understanding of the hermeneutic circle, see his discussion of"Circular and Feedback Mechanisms" in "Towards a More Synoptic View," 118 ff. A comparison with Heidegger's phenomenological understanding of hermeneutic circularity in which the inquirer "leap[s] into the 'circle,' primordially and wholly," i. e., acknowledges temporality as the agency of disclosure (Being and Time, 63), reveals the degree to which Richards's "feed-forward" mechanism is in fact essen- tially metaphysical and viciously circular. See also my essay, "Heidegger, Kierkegaard, and the Hermaneutic Circle: Towards a Postmodern Theory of Interpretation as Dis- closure," boundary 2, Vol. IV, 2 (Winter 1976), 455-88. Indeed, such a comparison reveals the degree to which Richards's "mechanism" is what Heidegger would call a cybernetic instrument, i.e., an instrument drained of its ontological content (Martin Heidegger, "The End of Philosophy and the Task of Thinking," On Time and Being, tr. Joan Stambaugh [New York: Harper Colophon Books, 1972] 59-60.</page><page sequence="55">Modern Humanist Education advantage. It is to be feared that the Platonic dialogues and their progeny have spread chiefly the strategy and tactics of intellectual combat. While the original aim may have been to teach people not to fight but to comprehend (SI, 109). Richards thus categorically dismisses as inevitably activating intellec- tual warfare precisely what, given the contemporary demystification of the binary logic of metaphysics, now appears to the postmodern counter-memory to be the most suggestively valuable possibility in Plato's discourse: an originative thinking or, more specifically, a her- meneutics of understanding as antagonistic dialogue, which is "ground- ed" on and emerges from the acknowledged uncertainty of the de- centered occasion of human "being." The oxymoron I am invoking is, of course, Mikhail Bakhtin's. But I am referring to a broader context: to the "horizonal" (de-structive/pro-jective) hermeneutics broadly, if unevenly, articulated by such post-Humanist thinkers as Nietzsche, Heidegger, Gadamer, Merleau-Ponty, Ricoeur, and Derrida, and, on different registers, Gramsci, Adorno, Althusser, Foucault, Jameson, Said, and Freire. To adapt Heidegger's formulation to my purposes, it is a dialectical hermeneutics of "Repetition" (Wiederholen) informed, not by a hidden and viciously circular will to power, but by Gelassenheit, that care or deference to the be-ing of being which is always already unrelenting in its exposure of the repressive center elsewhere that mas- querades as disinterested or objective inquiry - inquiry without pre- supposition - and at the same time lets the play of difference be, that is, have its own say. As I have said elsewhere, it is a negatively capable hermeneutics, the measure of which is not a super-natural (prov- idential) and super-visory standard grounded in the Seminal Word, but an improvisatory measure grounded in the inquirer's mortal occasion.64 64. I derive the phrase from Robert Creeley ("Poetry is the measure of its occa- sion") and intend it to de-colonize the meaning alienated by the privileged first term of the opposition between "Universal and occasional." The retrived meaning is sug- gested by its etymology: immediately from the Latin occasus, "the setting of the sun" and, ultimately, from the ablative form ofcadere (as in de casibus illustnium virorum), "to fall," "to perish," "to die." It is also intended to evoke other colonized cognates such as "case" (as in"being-in-the-world is our case"); "accidental," "incidental," "cadence," and, not least, "Occident," from occidere ("to go down," "to set"), a correlate of cadere and occasus. For Heidegger's version of this occasional measure, see especially ". .. Poetically Man Dwells..." (221-22). For my amplification of Heidegger's ver- 61</page><page sequence="56">62 William V. Spanos Instead, Richards restates a rigorous (and rigid) methodological theory of understanding and a correlative educational philosophy based on Matthew Arnold's notion of the "best self" and committed, therefore, to the "comprehensive synoptic view." Analogous to the meta-physical and spatializing poetics of the New Criticism he helped to found as an academic discipline, the "synopticism" of Richards's "best self " assumes Truth ("what truly is") to be ultimately integral and timeless and thus capable of being comprehended ("grasped," "taken hold of " - colonized) by the disinterested (distanced) synoptic eye.65 It thus demands a reading that begins from the end (in both senses of the word) - and re-collective or retro-spective hermeneutics that reifies and de-differentiates and thus alienates precisely what it seeks to name and domesticate. This, despite the assurances of the benign authority of the "disinterested best self," is the consequence of Rich- ards's Arnoldian (and Romanizing) effort to recuperate the speculative philosopher Plato from the dialogic materialist, Socrates: We would have authority: an authority which would have behind itall that man knows in all his modes of knowing and all that he would will to become through all his quests for being. It would be an authority which could wholly be respected and accepted, because it would represent the whole man, not any party or pressure group among his interests. All authority derives from the consent of those who acknowledge it. (Any other government rests on coercion merely, not authority. The fears are a faction only in our minds.) The authority which Plato's synoptic view would try to give us could gain our com- plete consent, could be wholly persuasive, because it would unify us. (SI, 112) Understood in these assimilative terms, Richards's "comprehensive synoptic view" becomes what might be called an "aestheticization of convention," and thus another historical supplement of the panoptic sion, see "Postmodern Literature and the Hermeneutic Crisis," Union Seminary Quar- terly Review, Vol. XXXIV (Winter 1979), 127-28. 65. Like Hegel, Richards gives inordinate value to the word "comprehend" pre- cisely because of its etymological connotations (cor +prehendre, "to understand by seiz- ing or grasping all [at once]"). Behind this valorization, as I have noted, is the concept of the hermeneutic circle in which Being is ontologically prior to temporality. See, for example, "Towards a Theory of Comprehension," SI, 17-38.</page><page sequence="57">Moder Humanist Education 63 perspective privileged in the West since Plato, or, more accurately, his Roman interpreters, posited the Memory as the instrument of recover- ing the prelapsarian (i.e., pre-historical) realm of Forms,66 which, in coercing difference into Identity, words into the Word, at nroX a t into the One, a proliferating knowledge into a represented and com- prehended synoptic picture, reaffirms the will to power over being. Richards's "University" thus becomes, like Arnold's and Babbitt's, another "speculative instrument" for the fulfillment of Western man's perennial metaphysical dream of bringing Order into the "chaos" ofcon- flicfing knowledges. As so many contemporary philosophers, poets, and scientists have borne witness, this imperialistic dream has been responsible in large part for what Husserl called "the crisis of Euro- pean man." For all his commitment to the "wholeness," the "humane- ness," the "freedom," of homo humanus against the institutional machin- ery that would abstract, mechanize, and utilize him or her, Richards's "educated man" continues to be what Charles Olson, follov ing Keats, calls the "Man of Power."67 66. See, expecially, Plato, Phaedrus and Letters, VII and VIII, tr. Walter Hamilton (Hammondsworth, England: Penguin Books, 1973), 55: ". .. it takes a man to under- stand by the use of universals, and to collect out of the multiplicity of sense-impressions a unity arrived at by a process of reason. Such a process is simply the recollection of the things which our soul once perceived .... That is why it is right that the soul of the philosopher alone should regain its wings; for it is always dwelling in memory as best it may upon those things which a god owes his divinity to dwelling upon. It is only by the right use of such aids to recollection, which form a continued initiation into the perfect mystic vision that a man can become perfect in the true sense of the word." 67. I borrow this term from Charles Olson's adaptation of Keats's critique of the "Egotistical Sublime" or "proper self" privileged by the Western humanistic con- sciousness (especially Wordsworth's): ". .. one can dub the period 1750 to 1945 THE AGE OF POWER. And thus get another light on why Keats was on target in trying to extricate another sort of'Man' from the MAN OF POWER - what you will recall he called Wordsworth and Milton in literature and otherwise called those who have a 'proper self' the 'Egotistical Sublime.'" Against this he posed the man "who has ... not any individuality, any determined 'Character,' his man of Negative Capability, or the Man of Achievement" (The Special View of History, ed. Ann Charters [Berkeley: Oyez, 1970], 41). See also Paul Bov6, "A Free, Varied, and Unwasteful Life": "While Richards and his progeny, legitimates and bastards alike, have consistently represent- ed themselves as opposed to the division of labour, the fragmentation of man and knowledge, and the dominance of Will over Reason - that multi-faceted experience of an event of which Coleridge speaks so eloquently - and the threat to treedom trom totalitarianism in politics and ideas, their very procedures, we discover, being no more than a part of the larger disciplinary configuration they so deplore, only naively extend the power of this configuration."</page><page sequence="58">64 William V. Spanos Nor do I intend the meaning of my reference to Richards's "im- perialism" to be limited to his ontological and educational colonial- ism. For like the discourse of Matthew Arnold and Irving Babbitt or, say, Sainte-Beuve and Ernest Renan, whom both admired, Richards's rhetoric of assimilation addresses not only the general dissolution of the Classical/Christian culture - the "imperial Virgil/Dante con- tinuum that T.S. Eliot was trying to rehabilitate68 - but also and simultaneously the historical dissolution, in the decades of World Wars I and II, of Western (essentially British) economic, social, and political hegemony over the Other worlds. (In this concern, one should not forget, he was broadly at one with such writers as the Conrad ot 68. See Frank Kermode, The Classic: Literary Image of Pernnanence and Change (Cam- bridge: Harvard University Press, 1983), 15-80. Originally published by Faber and Faber, 1975. Ostensibly a critique of T.S. Eliot's "imperialistic" or "Virgilian" under- standing of the classic and the tradition (the Eternal or "essential") in favor of a "provincial" (the temporal and transient or "dispositional") understanding, Kermode as humanist, will not, unfortunately, deny the validity of the idea of the Classic. Thus, despite his effort to escape, he remains loyal to the Identity or Telos that his forbears, Arnold, Babbitt, and Richards, invoke more overtly in their interpretations of literary history. Despite his acknowledgement of the temporality of the historical process, Ker- mode, that is, continues to give ontological priority to Being/Form/Logos/Presence in interpreting it. Thus remaining caught in the hermeneutic circle by colonizing tem- porality within the traditional binary structure, he reinstates a hermeneutics of accom- modation in the act of trying to displace it and recuperates (if in a naturalized form) an imperialistic view of the classic in the act of trying to call it into question: "It can be argued ... that to require the classic to speak to us directly in our time, rather than to demand of ourselves the effort to speak to the classic in its time, is an instance of what Eliot calls 'overestimation of the importance of our own time' and of ourselves. Yet the fact is inescapable that a much humbler tradition than Eliot's [clearly the "humanis- tic"] - working through time, across generations - is the proximate cause of there being any classics - old books which people still read - at all. And this means that over and overagain in time those old books are accommodated to the sense [common? - if not, what?] of readers whose language and culture is different. Here we deal in dispositions, not essences. The paradox - that there is an identity but that it changes - is made more difficult by the certainty that it can in some measure be redeemed from change, by an effort of interpretation rather than simple accommodation, the establishment of'rele- vance.' It seems that on a just view of the matter the books we call classics possess intrinsic qualities that endure, but possess also an openness to accommodation which keeps them alive under endlessly varing dispositions" (43-44; my emphasis). Further, Kermode's discussion of the "imperialism" of the "Classic" understood in terms of the tradition to which Eliot belongs and which he would recuperate is virtually devoid of material history - the dense historical conjunctures that precipitate the "Classic" and the socio-political implications of its canonization. For Kermode, this "imperialism" is essentially a literary matter. I will return to Eliot's "Roman" understanding of the "Classic" later in the essay.</page><page sequence="59">Modern Humanist Education Heart of Darkness and Nostromo, the Lawrence of Seven Pillars of Wisdom, the Forster of A Passage to India, the Orwell of Burmese Days, and the Cary of Mr. Johnson, to name but a few of the British humanists who anxiously address this recalcitrantly contradictory problem.) Thus his ontological logocentrism manifests itself in an ethnocentrism as well, a methodological Anglo-Americanism that constructs Other cultures in its own discursive image and thus augments rather than disarms the Western will to power, bent, according to Heidegger, on the complete "Europeanization of the earth and man."69 Richards's "speculative instrument" betrays its complicity with that archival "Orientalism" which, as Edward W. Said has shown, in "naturalizing" the historically constructed, textualized, and produced cultural dominance of the "West" over the "East," has authorized and, indeed, legitimated in an increasingly systematic if also discreet way, especially since the En- lightenment, the hegemonic cultural/economic/political purposes in- forming Western discourse and political praxis. Referring to Renan's philological approach to the Orient, Said writes: To be able to sustain a vision that incorporates and holds together life and quasi-living creatures (Indo-European, Euro- pean culture) as well as quasi-monstrous, parallel inorganic phenomena (Semitic, Oriental culture) is precisely the achieve- ment of the European scientist in the laboratory [read "Panop- ticon"]. He constructs, and the very act of construction is a sign of imperial power over recalcitrant phenomena, as well as a confirmation of the dominating culture and its "naturaliza- tion." Indeed, it is not too much to say that Renan's philologi- cal laboratory is the actual locale of his European ethnocen- trism but what needs emphasis here is that the philological laboratory has no existence outside the discourse, the writing by which it is constantly produced and experienced. Thus even the culture he calls organic and alive - Europe's - is also a 69. Martin Heidegger, "A Dialogue on Language," On the Way to Language, tr. Peter D. Hertz (San Francisco: Harper &amp; Row, 1982) 15. This, it is worth emphasizing, is a reiterated motif in Heidegger's late writing on technology and the "Age ot the World Picture." See, for example, "The End of Philosophy": "The End of Philosophy proves to be the triumph of the manipulable arrangement of a scientific-technological world and of the social order proper to this world.

Spanos creature being created in the laboratory and by philology.70 Unlike Renan, Richards lived, studied, and taught for some years in the Orient (specifically, China), but this should not mislead one into concluding that the images of the non-Western cultures he refers to derive from these cultures' own actuality. On the contrary, Richards's "Oriental" discourse has its point of departure in his anxiety over the fate of the West or Western culture. He attributes the proliferation of "knowledges" that threatens the measured stability of contemporary Occidental civilization to the invasion of"monstrous" and radically alien cultures, languages, and rhetorics. The familiar (and familial) rhetoric of the "We" in the following representative passage, which does not allow the "they" to speak for themselves, should not be overlooked: Possibly, even probably, the difficulties of readingjustly are increasing. Within a well-defined tradition the items and the patterns they enter are fewer and clearer than amid the frothy emulsion of hitherto immiscible cultures in which to-day we live and move and aspire to win some being. Our novel acquaint- anceship with the untraditional past and with oddities of thought and feelingfrom other cultures is unrhythming, it may be, the heart ofour men- tal and moral security. (SI, 101; my emphasis) Thus one of the most urgent tasks of the Western synoptic University - and this remedial recommendation recurs everywhere in Rich- ards's writing - is to develop an efficient instrument for teaching the English language. For, like Renan's philology, the sane "clarity" of English will not only neutralize by domesticating the "oddities of thought and feeling [the echo of Arnold is worth noting] from other cultures" that ominously threaten to unrhythm "Us"; but, further sanitized by Ogden's and Richards's "Basic English," it will also cor- rect, i.e., "normalize," the apparently "monstrous" moral values, the cacophonouis or exorbitant measure, in terms of the Western model and thus include them within the Western "orbit" or uKxKa?.

But the unexamined rhetoric of his archival discourse, like that of Arnold, Babbitt, Renan, and so many other early and late human- ists, betrays its subsuming ethnocentrism: ... two-thirds of us on this planet are, at the time of writing, analphabetics. Of the 2,200,000,000 people now breathing, some 1,500,000,000 either cannot read at all or read some non-alphabetic script. This is not time or place in which to argue the merits of the invention of alphabetic writing. Suffice it that if there is to be any truly world-wide communication be- tween peoples within a foreseeable future, it will be in some language which is alphabetic. It could be within our lifetime and through English. (SI, 93) A great deal of corrosive history intervenes between the historical con- juncture which gives rise to this characteristic statement by I.A. Rich- ards and that of Thomas Babington Macauley's famous "Minute of 1835" arguing for an English education for Indians: I have no knowledge of either Sanskrit or Arabic. But I have done what I could to form a correct estimate of their value. I have read translations of the most celebrated Arabic and San- skrit works. I have conversed, both here and at home, with men distinguished by their proficiency in the Eastern tongues. I am quite ready to take the oriental learning at the valuation of the orientalists themselves. I have never found one among them who could deny that a single shelf of a good European library was worth the whole native literature of India and Arabia. The intrinsic superiority of the Western literature is indeed fully admitted by those members of the committee who support the oriental plan of education .... It is, I believe, no exaggeration to say that all the historical information which has been collect- ed in the Sanskrit language is less valuable than what may be found in the paltry abridgements used at preparatory schools in England. In every branch of physical or moral philosophy, the relative position of the two nations is nearly the same.71 71. Quoted in Edward W. Said, "Secular Criticism," 12.

Spanos Macaulay's Orientalist discourse is articulated "from a position of power where he could translate his opinions into the decision to make an entire subcontinent of natives submit to studyirng in a language not their own."72 Richards's takes place in a different context of imperialis- tic divestment and ethnic emergence and is thus compelled to accom- modate its logos to the transformed historical situation. But as his insistence on the remedial power of English makes clear, he does aim at accommodation, a re-centering on a different, more discreet register of the Occidental authority de-centered by the emergence of ethnic consciousness and the overthrow of overt colonial rule. If"We" cannot govern "them" as colonies, we can at least "influence" them - culti- vate, domesticate, and reap their threatening, "unrhythming" energies - by establishing English as the "auxiliary world language,"73 by, that is, controlling the informational order. It does not seem to occur to Richards that the emergent Third World nations may not want to work out their fates in and with English nor, more important, that to a Chinese or an Indian or an Arab, in the middle of the twentieth cen- tury, English as a discursive practice is simultaneously an instrument 72.

For a characteristic example of this kind of accommodation, see Edward W. Said's analysis of the 1925 recommendations vis-a-vis the emergent "Orient" of the distinguished French Orien- talist, Sylvain Levi (Orientalism, 248-50). In a brief reference to Mencius on the Mind: Experiments in Multiple Definition (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1932), however, Said curiously finds Richards's discourse a gratifying exception to this characteristic Orientalist accommodation of the emergent "East:" My point is that the metamorphosis of a relatively innocuous philological subspeciality into a capacity for managing political movements, administer- ing colonies, making nearly apocalyptic statements representing the White Man's difficult civilizing mission - all this is something at work within a pur- portedly liberal culture, one full of concern for its vaunted norms of catho- licity, plurality, and open-mindedness. In fact, what took place was the opposite of liberal: the hardening of doctrine and meaning, imparted by "science," into "truth." For if such truth reserved for itself the right to judge the Orient as immutably Oriental in ways I have indicated, the liberality was no more than a form of oppression and mentalistic prejudice. The extent of such illiberality has not - and is not - often recognized from within the culture .... It is heartening, nevertheless, that such illiber- ality has occasionally been challenged [as in Richards's Men- cius] ....

It is, indeed, ironic that the distinguished author of the (still) influen- tial Practical Criticism, who, in the name of a more "just" mode of read- ing, insistently exposes the "doctrinal adhesions" and the "stock responses" that contaminate his Cambridge students' protocols, should be so impervious to the panoptic rhetoric and the ethnocentric will to power inscribed in his "efficient" Benthamite speculative instrument. As the final sentence of the encomium I have quoted as epigraph to this section itself betrays, Richards's Apollonian discourse reveals "just how abstract his grasp of the historical event he is describ- ing is"75 or, to put it another way,just how trapped this master of irony remains in the philological tradition that the counter-memory has ex- posed not simply as a socially constituted construct but also as a coer- cive disciplinary network: Having become a dense and consistent historical reality, lan- guage forms the locus of tradition, of the unspoken habits of thought, of what lies hidden in a people's mind; it accumulates an ineluctable memory which does not even know itself as memory. Expressing their thoughts in words of which they are not the masters, enclosing them in verbal forms whose histori- cal dimensions they are unaware of, men believe that their speech is their servant and do not realize that they are submit- ting to its demands. The grammatical arrangements of a lan- guage are the apriori of what can be expressed in it. The truth of discourse is caught in the trap of philology.76 There is, as Foucault and others have reminded us, no more secure prison than the prisonhouse of humanistic language, a prisonhouse assumed by its inmates to be a space of freedom, in which the incar- cerated are the unknowingly willing bearers of their own (and others) incarceration. 74.

Spanos V What we have witnessed by way of the foregoing destruction of the educational discourses of these three exemplary modern humanists whose texts span the period between the emergence of a proletarian class consciousness in late Victorian England through the inter- nationalization of planetary life in the period of world War II is, I sug- gest, a continuous paradigm of discreet and subtle coercion informing the alleged disinterestedness of their modes of inquiry, a paradigm capable of accommodating the ideological and socio-political disper- sions of any particular historical crisis to its absorptive center. For each, of course, this paradigm - the centered circle - which can be traced back through the Renaissance to its origins in the humanism of the Roman Republic and ultimately to Plato (i.e., the late Greeks), is, as it was for their predecessors, the symbolic structure of Perfection - of Beauty, as it were. But, as I have suggested, it is also and simultaneously (as it was more overtly for the models of their predecessors) the sym- bolical structure and polyvalent agency of Power, capable of defusing by circumscribing, disciplining, and subjecting the disruptive energies of the "Other" - of difference - precipitated by historical crisis. We can catch a glimpse of this continuing relationship between Per- fection and Power in the West if, for example, we extend Michel Foucault's genealogy ofJeremy Bentham's utilitarian Panopticon (and the disciplinary society envisioned by the Enlightenment) back to those circular cities idealized by the humanist Utopians of the Renais- sance such as Campanella (1568-1639) and diagrammed for construc- tion by such humanist architect/engineers as Alberti (1404-1472), Filarete (1400-1469), Martini (1439-1502), Giocondo (1435-1515), and Cataneo (?-1519). For it turns out that these ideal humanistic cities modelled on the geometry of the circle became, inevitably and increas- ingly in practice from the Renaissance to the Age of Enlightenment, the ideal fortress. There is, in short, a direct line from Campanella's utopian City of the Sun to New Brisach, the circular fortress city in Alsace designed by Vauban for Louis XIV. This translation of the Uto- pian discourses of the Renaissance humanists into an instrumentality of socio-political power was made possible not simply because the cen- tered circularity of the ideal city was intrinsically amenable to a com- plex technological system of circumferential fortification against the threat of external attack. More important, as Filarete's Sforzinda, the ideal circular city he designed for his patron, Francesco Sforza, the</page><page sequence="65">Modern Humanist Education tyrant of Milan, makes clear, it was also because the austere circular economy of Beauty lent itself to the achievement of a radialized, com- partmentalized, and hierarchized space within the bounding wall, a space, which, however comely, provided for easy "cultivation," i.e., supervision and regimentation as well as aesthetic refinement. The City Beautiful, that is, provided the perfect geometry for the organization of physical space not simply to insure the bodily well-being of its in- habitants, but, by extension, their spiritual "health" as well. This spa- tial and spatializing economy of Beauty, in other words, guaranteed the disciplinary transformation of potentially disruptive human be- ings into good citizens: efficient, docile, and dependable defenders against the threatening foes within as well as without. The circular City Beautiful is intrinsically the City Powerful.77 However effaced in and by their rhetorics of "deliverance," this relationship between the idealized circle and practical power, con- stituted and sanctioned by the discourse of humanism in the Renais- sance, remained the unacknowledged basis of Arnold's, Babbitt's, and Richards's educational projects. For all their appeal to the "liberal arts," it was, I submit, this hidden ideological agenda - this com- plicity between the panoptic view afforded by the centered circle and disciplinary practice - that underlay and enabled Arnold's advocacy of"Culture," Babbitt's advocacy of the "Classical Measure," and Rich- 77. I have written about this history at somewhat greater length in "Postmoder Literature and Its Occasion: Retrieving the Preterite Middle," Repetitions: Essays on the Postmodern Occasion.

(New York: The Free Press, 1964-1972) and, especially, NormanJ.Johnson, Cities in the Round (Seattle: Univ. of Washington Press, 1983). As Michel Foucault's genealogical researches make clear, it is all too typical of"disinterested" humanist scholars like Gutkind andJohnson to be blinded by the insight of their essentially aesthetic problematic to the will to power informing the circular city; i.e., to the absolute, if unevenly developed, relationship between the Occidental concept/image of beauty and concrete historical power. Thus, for example, Johnson insistenty interprets the actual military/disciplinary use to which from the beginning and increasingly thereafter it was put (of which he is very much aware) as a tragic violation of the archetypal dream (foregrounded by Renais- sance Humanists), in which the circular city becomes the earthly manifestation of the Cosmic Beauty, rather than reading it as what all the evidence (even in his own text) clearly implies: the historically specific fulfillment of the potential power that theorists of the circular city, Utopian as well as practicing architects and engineers, recognized in this totalizing geometry of beauty from the beginning.
