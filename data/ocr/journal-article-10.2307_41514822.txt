Stephen R. Kellert School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, Yale University and Miriam 0. Westervelt U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service Washington, D.C. This paper identifies some of the social, behavioral, and demographic factors that other research has suggested have demonstrated affects on young people's perceptions of the natural world. This review is by no means comprehensive and inadvertently some important studies have been omitted. We have, nevertheless, attempted to review a wide range of relevant investigations with some very useful results emerging. The focus of most research in this field has not been wildlife but attitudes toward other environmental issues, such as air and water pollution, over-population, recycling, and land use. Attitudes toward these issues seem to be influenced by sociodemographic characteristics such as age, ethnic background, sex, area of residence, scholastic ability, socioeconomic status, parental occupation, knowledge of the natural world, active participation in nature-oriented activities, and a variety of cultural agents including books, television, school, family and friends. Relatively few efforts have considered the development of young people's attitudes toward wildlife. The few findings that are available seem to indicate an association between young people's attitudes toward animals and age, ethnic background, sex, area of residence, knowledge of animals, symbolic perceptions of animals, participation in animal-related activities, instruction in animal-related courses, television, parents and movies. Unfortunately, it is difficult to arrive at a comprehensive understanding of how these different variables influence young and growing children's perceptions of animals because of the variations in the size and characteristics of sample popultaions in these studies, their use of widely varying methodologies, and the diversity of research focus. INFLUENCES ON ATTITUDES TOWARD ANIMALS Age Insufficient data exists on the development of attitudes toward wildlife from childhood, because most research has focused on high school students or very young children. Systematic investigations of a wide age range have been carried out by Badaracco (1973) and Johnson (1974). When Badaracco examined grades one through twelve for preference in aspects of the natural environment, reptiles and insects dropped significantly in preference among older children. Age was also a crucial variable in Johnson's study on attitudes toward wolves. Children under ten years of age were the most negative toward the wolf, and views of people over thirty most closely resembled those of the under ten age group. LaHart (1974), Pomerantz (1977), and Sanders (1974) have provided scattered, though valuable data on the attitudes toward wildlife among eighth graders, nonconsumptive users (those who observed, photographed, or fed wildlife) were more knowledgeable about animals than were consumptive users (those who fished or hunted wildlife) , although the study by Pomerantz seemed to suggest the opposite. Pomerantz reported that a majority of seventh through twelfth grade students valued aesthetic more than utilitarian qualities of wildlife, were anxious to learn about wildlife, took part in wide variety of animal-related activities, and did not differ in terms of anthropomorphic feelings towards animals. Regarding concern for animal welfare problems, eighth graders appeared to care more than twelfth gradents (Sanders , 1974) . A more extensive understanding of how environmental attitudes develop in children has been reported by pyai (1975). In her attempt to identify an age group when environmental education might be most influential, she relied on political socialization literature, building on the notion of critical developmental periods in life. She chose to study seventh grade students because, according to the political socialization literature, most political learning occurs at the pre-high school level (Hess, 1967) , political interest peaks in the seventh or eighth grades and becomes firmly established around that time (Easton, 1970), and political attitudes about "community" remain fairly constant from age fourteen to high school (Adelson, 1966) . In terms of attitudes toward the environment and animals, evidence exists to support Dyar's (1975) notion of a critical period around the junior high school years. An increase in the stability of environmental attitudes as children grow older has been reported by Horvat (1974) , who found that environmental orientations of eighth graders were more stable and internally consistent than those of fifth graders. Giles (1959) reported the most dramatic increases in conversation knowledge scores occurred between grades seven and nine and concluded: "Conservation can be most efficiently and effectively taught in grades seven, eighth, and nine. If one grade is to be considered, grade seven appears to present the greates opportunities (p. 497)." Concerning attitudes toward wildlife, LaHart (1978) reported: "Attitudes toward consumptive and nonconsumptive uses of wildlife appear to be well formed by the time young people reach eighth grade. This implies 8 Children's Environments Quarterly</page><page sequence="2">that programs designed to increase tolerance toward consumptive uses of wildlife should probably be directed at younger children (p. 74)." Pomerantz (1977) , however, found no significant differences between seventh through twelfth graders on the basis of interest in learning about wildlife, anthropomorphic feelings toward animals, and participation in a majority of wildlife-oriented activities. A speculative and theoretical model of how these attitudes develop over the course of one's lifetime has been proposed by Morris (1965). According to Morris1 theory, there are seven ages of animal reactivity which progress from the "Infantile" Phase, when big animals represent parent substitutes, to the "Senile" Phase when there is an intense interest in species struggling for survival. Between childhood and young adulthood, children pass through the "Infantile" Phase (between ages four and eight) and the "Infantile-Parental" Phase (between ages nine and fourteen) , when children begin to react more strongly to smaller animals which are symbolic of infant figures. The "Objective Pre-Adult" Phase follows, when bug hunting, microscopes, and aquaria are the subjects of animal interest; and, when the young adult phase arrives, interest in animals is typically supplanted by a concentration on human relations. Although this theory is highly speculative, the research efforts previously described support the basis of Morris1 model; that is, there seems to be progressive chronological stages in the development of children's attitudes toward the natural environment. Sex Most research suggests young females tend to express greater anti-hunting sentiment than do young males (pomerantz, 1977; Rohlfing, 1980; Shaw, 1974). Female children also appear to be more sympathetic toward animals (Baird, 1982), more concerned about animal welfare problems (Sanders, 1974) , and more anthropomorphic and aesthetically oriented to animals (Pomerantz, 1977). A difference between sexes on specific animal preferences was one of Badaracco's (1973) most striking results. Mammals and birds were popular with both sexes, but girls in grades 1-12 consistently ranked fish, reptiles, and biting and stinging invertebrates much lower than did boys. Morris (1965) also found that boys and girls between four and ten years of age dislike spiders equally as much, but as they approached their teens, there was a dramatic increase in the girls1 and not the boys 1 negative attitudes toward spiders. Area of Residence In our study of adult attitudes towards animals (Kellert, 19 ), persons raised in rural areas expressed stronger utilitarian sentiments toward animals, while those raised in cities of at least one million people were more likely to be moralistic. Pomerantz (1977) provides some supporting evidence for this effect in children. As population size increased in her study of seventh through twelfth graders, a decrease occurred in the number of hunters, and an increase in opposition to hunting. Sanders (1974), however, reported that inner city children expressed the least concern for animal welfare problems, and children from the suburbs expressed the most concern. Ethnic Background In a variety of resource-related recreational activities (e.g., camping, hiking, hunting), except for fishing, participation by young urban blacks was "noticeably absent" according to Washington (1976) , and understanding of wildlife was gained primarily from television shows. Additionally, knowledge of wildlife and the environment has been consistently found to be lower among young blacks than whites (Giles, 1959; LaHart, 1978), and Hovat (1974) reported a lack of concern for environmental problems in urban black students. One reason, according to Washington, why "wildlife is little more than a vestigial component in the lives of many urban blacks (Washington, 1976, p. 15) is the lack of opportunity for meaningful wildlife-related experiences during childhood. Knowledge of Animals According to LaHart (1978), a relationship exists between what young people know and feel about wildlife, but the association is not a particularly strong one. Knowledgeable eighth graders were more likely to recognize the importance of lower forms of animal life and preserving endangered species, to have greater tolerance for predators, and to oppose the outlawing of hunting. As previously reported, LaHart also found that eighth graders who engaged in nonconsumptive wildlife activities were more knowledgeable about animals than consumptive users. Pomerantz (1977), however, reported the opposite effect. Among the secondary school students she studied, more hunters than nonhunters had high knowledge scores, and more nonhunters had high knowledge scores than antihunters. LaHart (1978) obtained some interesting results on attitudes not related to knowledge. For instance, both high and low knowledge groups responded similarly to questions about the emotional capacities of animals and the health conditions of wild animals compared to pets. La Hart concluded that despite varying levels of knowledge about wildlife, young people maintain anthrpomorphic attitudes and have little understanding of the laws of natural selection. Several investigators have demonstrated that males were more knowledgeable about animals than females (Kress, 1975; Pomerantz, 1977; Shaw, 1961), and that whites, children with parents who have a college education (LaHart, 1978), and rural children (Pomerantz, 1977) receive comparatively higher scores on knowledge of animals tests. Vol. 1, No. 3 (Fall), 1984 S</page><page sequence="3">Symbolic Perceptions of Animals When familiar symbols (e.g., black and white line drawings of a squirrel, deer and coyote) were used to convey aspects of natural history to first through twelfth grade students, mammals were the most popular category, birds second, and fish third (Badaracco, 1973). Reptiles, harmless invertebrates, amphibians, and biting and stinging invertebrates were very unpopular but young children seemed to have more of an affinity for these creatures than did older children. Snakes were liked the least of all creatures by more than 25% of the children from four to fourteen years old who were studied by Morris (1965). The greatest snake hatred occurred at age six. Children under ten also had the most negative perdeptions of wolves, which were regarded as dangerous, bad, destroyers of moose and deer populations, and as having no value (Johnson, 1974). Morris (1966) identified twenty anthropomorphic characteristics to account for the popularity of animals like the panda, one of which was size. In childhood, he suggests, large-sized animals are preferred because they "fit the role of the omnipotent parent," whereas older children are more attracted to smaller animals, like pets, because they fulfill the role of infant figures. Participation in Animal-oriented Activities LaHart found that "animal activities impact attitudes as much as knowledge and this supports encouraging wildlife-oriented activities like camping, bi r dwatching , and hunting and fishing as a means of educating young people" (pp. 73-74). Similar results were obtained by Baird (1982) who reported, "If one were to try to change attitudes, education without an experiential component might not be very effective" (p. 12) . Pomerantz (1977) found young hunters were more active than young non-hunters and antihunters in a wide variety of wildlife- oriented activities. Males outnumberd females in hunting, fishing, and catching insects, and more females than males went horseback riding and visited zoos. Differences were also found between rural and urban children, and with those from rural areas participating in more animal-related activities. George (1967) maintains that membership in conservation clubs and nature camp experiences are strongly associated with conservation attitude change in high school students. Concerning domestic animals, owning a pet appears to exert a positive influence on animal welfare concerns among high school students (1974), to have therapeutic effects on emotionally disturbed children. Activities that seem to be helpful to high school students in scoring well on wildlife knowledge tests include biology courses, general science courses, fishing, hunting, trapping and camping (Giles, 1959; Shaw, 1961; Cauley &amp; Groves, 1974; Pomerantz, 1977. Other Influences "Teacher's opinions play a role in the socialization of children's attitudes, even though evidence of the amount of such attitude transmission is neither readily available nor precise" (Hess, 1967). Information is available, however, on the effects of teachers' instruction methods, television, parents, and movies. Direct instruction methods, in which children examined the anatomical and behavioral characteristics of live spiders and snakes, promoted positive attitudes toward these animals in 9 - 12 year olds (Kress, 1975). Indirect instruction methods, such as slides, movies, and lectures about the anatomy and behaviors of spiders and snakes, did not have as profound an influence. Also, the positive attitudes achieved through the direct instruction method generalized to other species of spiders and snakes and were stablel up to six months after instruction. Television also appears to have a significant affect on how wildlife attitudes are developed. Pomerantz (1976) found that 87% of secondary school children felt that television influenced their interest in wildlife. According to Washington (1976), black students who live in metropolitan areas consider wildlife TV programs to be the most important factor contributing to their appreciation of wildlife. La Hart (1978) also determined that watching wildlife programs was more important to wildlife knowledge than hunting or fishing. Finally, parents and movies were chosen as major influences on attitudes toward wildlife by 75% of the children in Pomerantz's (1976) study. Bibliography Adelson, J., &amp; O'Neill, R. (1966).
