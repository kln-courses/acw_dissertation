<plain_text><page sequence="1">Orwell and Empire: Rnti-Communism and the Globalization of Literature Andrem . Rubin For decades, George Orwell's blue quarto notebook, filled with the names of one hundred and thirty-five "crypto-communists and fel low travelers," languished, mostly unexamined, in the George Orwell Archives in London, attracting only passing interest from the few scholars granted permission by Orwell's estate to examine the materi al. In his 1980 biography of Orwell, Bernard Crick, for example, made only a brief allusion to the list, writing that Orwell worried about "communist infiltration . . . and kept a notebook of suspects."1 Many of those listed, Crick said, "are plausible as possible underground or front members, but a few seem far-fetched and unlikely."2 A decade later, Orwell's authorized biographer Michael Shelden speculated that Orwell was "engaged in a continuous exercise of determining who was sincere and who was not." The notebook was "primarily to satisfy [Orwell's] own curiosity," Shelden wrote.3 The notebook included the names of those whom Orwell sus pected of having affiliations with the Communist Party, or sympathies with the very idea of "communism."4 Among them, he mentioned poets such as Stephen Spender, whom he described as a "sentimental [com munist] sympathizer," "very unreliable," and "easily influenced."5 George Bernard Shaw was, he wrote, "no sort of tie-up, but reliably pro Russian on all major issues."6 The historian A. J. P. Taylor was "anti American"; Isaac Deutcher was "a sympathizer"; Richard Crossman was a "political climber" and "too dishonest to be an outright f[ellow] traveler]"; J. B. Priestley was "a strong sympathizer," "very anti-USA," and "makes huge sums of money in the USSR."7 The Scottish poet Hugh McDiarmid was "probably reliably pro-Russian" and "very anti English." C. Day Lewis was "not completely reliable" and the Irish playwright, Sean O'Casey, was "very stupid."8 Orwell's notebook of "crypto-communists and fellow-travel ers" inscribed "communism" in the form of various threats to the homogeneity of English culture. He observed, for example, that the Alif 28 (2008) 75</page><page sequence="2">historian Isaac Deutcher was a "Polish Jew"; that Ian Mikardo, a columnist at the Tribune, was "silly" and "Jewish"; that the writer Cedric Dover was "Eurasian"; that Paul Robeson was a "US Negro" and "very anti-white"; that the MP Konni Zilliacus was "Finnish" and "Jewish"; that the biologist J. D. Bernal was "Irish"; that Louis Adamic was "Jugo-Slav" and "very anti-British"; that Vera Dean was "Russian"; and that the French intellectual E. Mounier, author of La Pens?e de Charles P?guy (1931) was "slimy "9Indeed, Orwell once wrote to his friend Dwight McDonald that he could "smell" a crypto-communist.10 Irish and Scottish writers, such as Sean O'Casey, Liam O'Flaherty, and Hugh McDiarmid, were recast and refashioned as communist threats: "I think we should pay more attention to the small but violent separatist movements which exist within our own island," Orwell wrote in 1946; "They may look very unimportant now, but, after all, the Communist Manifesto was once an obscure document, and the Nazi party had only six members when Hitler joined it."11 From the one hundred and thirty-five names in the notebook, Orwell drew up a more limited list of thirty-five, which he sent to the Information Research Department (IRD) on May 2, 1949.12 "It isn't very sensational and I don't suppose it will tell your friends anything they don't know," he wrote the IRD; "At the same time it isn't a bad idea to have the people who are probably unreliable listed."13 This list?whose contents, it should be stressed, we can only infer from Orwell's annotations in his notebook (the list in the IRD's possession remains classified as a state secret by the British governments included the historian E. H. Carr, the economist G. D. H. Cole, the Dean of Canterbury Hewlett-Johnson, the New Statesman's Martin Kingsley, P. M. S. Blackett, W. P. and Zelda Coates, the journalist Walter Duranty, the pundit and MP Tom Driberg, the writer Cedric Dover, the Picture Posfs Tom Hopkinson, the MP Lester Hutchinson, the News-Chronicle's Stefan Litauer, the Observer's Iris Morley, John Macmurray (author of The Clue to History), the poet Nicholas Moore, the novelist Liam O'Flaherty, the News-Chronicle's Ralph Parker, the MP D. N. Pritt, the Pan-African Federation's George Padmore, Beaverbook Press's Peter Smollet, the Navy commander Edgar P. Young, the writer Konni Zilliacus, as well as seven other individuals whose identities still remain a state secret. Of these seven figures whose identities are unknown, Orwell is even reported to have listed the name of his tax inspector.15 76 Alif 28 (2008)</page><page sequence="3">The idea that threats and menaces to cultural and political author ity were precisely those that were concealed only to be later revealed as a knowledge and power over that secret was at the center of the princi ple and expression of "ciypto-communism" itself. Indeed, Orwell's list produced what was public knowledge about various writers' commu nist affiliations in the form of a secret. George Bernard Shaw, for exam ple, whom Orwell describes as consistently pro-Soviet16 had visited Moscow in July 1931 on the occasion of his seventy-fifth birthday, returning as an ardent supporter of the Soviet Union: "The society which has established itself and is being worked out in Russia is a Fabian society," Shaw wrote.17 In his Prefaces, Shaw sought to justify the elimination of Russian peasantry. "Peasants will not do," Shaw said, arguing that Stalin's political purges of the 1930s were a way of "weeding the garden."18 The lawyer D. N. Pritt, whom Orwell wrote "was almost certainly an underground member," was on record as hav ing been "completely satisfied that the accused [in the Moscow trials] were fairly and judicially treated."19 Yet, Orwell ignored the complexity of the communist movement of the 1930s.20 Several of those whom he listed were not members of the Communist Party. George Padmore, for example, had, in fact, been expelled from the Communist Party in 1933.21 Moreover, Paul Robeson was at no point a party member, and when he offered to join the Party's ranks in 1953, the Communist Party flatly rejected his application.22 In fact, Orwell's list may have contributed to the State's surveillance of several of those whom he listed. Robeson was deemed by the Home Office to be a "nuisance," and, from 1949 onward, his movements throughout England were monitored and closely followed by the Home Office.23 J. D. Bernal, the Economist editor J. G. Crowther,24 and nov elist Louis Golding were also refused visas to attend the Cultural and Scientific Conference for World Peace at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York a month later, May 25,1949 25 The list also settled old literary scores. Peter Smollet, whom Orwell accurately surmised was a Soviet agent, had, as an official in the Ministry of Information, most likely exerted pressure on the pub lisher Jonathan Cape to reject Animal Farm on the grounds that it would jeopardize Britain's cordial relations with the Soviet Union dur ing the war; Martin Kingsley, the editor of The New Statesman, whom Orwell suitably describes as a "decayed liberal," had rejected Orwell's "Spilling the Spanish Beans," an essay he wrote shortly after returning from Barcelona in 1937; Konni Zilliacus, the MP from Gateshead, had Alif 2S (2008) 77</page><page sequence="4">tussled with Orwell in the pages of Humphrey Slater's Polemic; and Sean O'Casey had refused to endorse Orwell's first novel, A Clergyman's Daughter, because he took umbrage at the novel's jejune, brazen, and unoriginal appropriation of Joyce's Nighttown chapter in Ulysses.26 From British Colonialism to Anti-Communism The result of Orwell's collaboration with the IRD was that Orwell's works became immensely important to, and even helped to structure, Britain's endeavors abroad, where the IRD recast the interests of the Foreign Office to conform to the dictates of American hegemony and anti communism in particular. Refashioning Britain's relationship to its colonies and former colonies in terms of various communist threats enabled Britain to both reassert its waning imperial power through the dis course of anti-communism, and ensure American support for its authority in countries such as Cyprus, Egypt, Greece, Iran, Kenya, Malaya, and Indonesia, where the IRD was later instrumental in overthrowing the gov ernment of Sukarno in 1965.27 "It seems very dangerous to pretend that the troubles in Malaya are not caused by Communism but only by a kind of local banditry," the IRD's Adam Watson explained: As we saw in Greece, where the Greek government were for long anxious to describe the Communists only as ban dits, international public opinion in the United States . . . and elsewhere is inclined to the line that when wholesale military operations are required to suppress mere internal unrest, it is in some way due to bad government. This is especially so in a colony; and instead of receiving sym pathy and support from American public opinion in our praiseworthy struggle to combat the well-known interna tional Communist menace, we shall merely be regarded as a bad colonial power coping with rebellions.28 In Iran, for example, the British government inferred that "the Americans were more likely to work with [the British] if it [the US government] saw the problem [in Iran] as one of containing commu nism rather than restoring the position of . . . [the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company]," wrote one official.29 One of the key governmental institutions that were part of this process of refiguring and refashioning threats to the colonial order, in 78 Alif2S (2008)</page><page sequence="5">the form of communist menaces was the Information Research Department (IRD), a then-covert branch of the British Foreign Office established after the Second World War. Founded by Clement Atlee's government in January 1948, "to devise the means to combat Communist propaganda," the IRD was largely created to respond to anti-colonial challenges to British imperial authority in the emerging postcolonial world?in countries such as Burma, Indonesia, India, and elsewhere. Of particular concern to the IRD were "Soviet activities throughout South East Asia."30 The IRD's "Outline of Communist Strategy in Southeast Asia" posited that "the rapid advance of the Chinese Communist southwards has greatly increased the direct threat to South East Asia during the last year."31 Southeast Asia, the report continued, "presented and . . . still presents a classic example of a potentially revolutionary situation: politically dislocated." The report described Soviet leaders as unable to distinguish between the "inter ests of international communism and the interests of the Soviet Union."32 It cited the communist "infiltration" of the trade union movement in Malaya, in Burma, in Indonesia, and in the Philippines. While many of these fears resituated British colonial interests in concert with the emerging exigencies of American postwar hege mony, the idea that communism posed a threat and menace was prin cipally founded on a set of American domestic anxieties about race and immigration, on the one hand, and the reconsolidation of the identity of the West, on the other. In 1947, the US Attorney General issued a report on immigration that claimed that over ninety percent of "American [communist] party militants were either foreign born, first generation native born, or married to foreign stock"; whereas roughly ten percent of the militants, the report found, "were of native stock, married to those [of] native stock."33 Domestic racial anxieties reflexively articulated putative threats and menaces abroad. As George Kennan, who later became US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, wrote in his "Long Telegram," Russians were predisposed to "Oriental secrecy and conspiracy."34 In an anonymous essay pub lished in July 1947 in Foreign Affairs, Kennan remarked that the Soviet Union exhibited a "brand of fanaticism, unmodified by any of the Anglo-Saxon's traditions of compromise." 35 There was, in fact, little historical or real material evidence to substantiate the widely held claim that the Soviet Union posed a real threat to American or British existence. As Anders Stephanson has observed, the Comintern had been dissolved in 1943; Stalin had with Alif2S (2008) 79</page><page sequence="6">held aid from the Greek rebels; Western involvement in Italy's 1948 election had raised no protest from Moscow; there was no more Soviet resistance to Franco in Spain after 1939; and "the revolutionary excep tions, Yugoslavia and Greece, were mainly products of local circum stance."36 Stalin's politics, in other words, was far more about the extraordinarily repressive consolidation of power within the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe than the extension of that repression into nations or colonies outside of the region.37 Indeed, the very idea of "communism" respatialized and refig ured the political and cultural articulation of Western authority in the aftermath of the Second World War. "Anti-communism" became the new "civilizing mission" after the war; it was the "substitute for ... [an] earlier imperialism."38 It was as much of an effort to both conceal the internal forms of racial oppression in the United States, as it was to define the West?in the form of democracy and freedom?against total itarianism. To that end, in 1947, US President Harry Truman issued a National Security Council directive (NSC-4) that called for "... coordi nating the implementation of all information measures designed to influ ence attitudes in foreign countries in a direction favorable to the attain ment of US objective."39 A later directive, NSC-68, stressed the need to affirm "the moral and material strength of the free world" through vari ous forms of cultural and informational initiatives.40 The British gov ernment issued similar pronouncements. In 1947, Britain's Foreign Minister, Ernest Bevin, informed his cabinet: "We cannot hope success fully to repel Communism only by disparaging it on material grounds. [We must] add a positive appeal to Christian and Democratic principles, remembering the strength of Christian sentiment in Europe. We must put forward a rival ideology."41 Part of the process of producing these threats entailed dissemi nating texts addressed to, and, therefore, constitutive of, those putative menaces.42 As Frances Stonor Saunders elaborates in her book Who Paid the Piper?^ institutions such as Britain's IRD and the United States' International Congress for Cultural Freedom funded numerous magazines, institutes, exhibitions, concerts, radio stations, and aca demic and intellectual conferences around the world in an effort to fight the Cold War by cultural means. Financially and covertly assist ed by of the Central Intelligence Agency,44 the Congress for Cultural Freedom translated works like Albert Camus's The Truth about the Nagy Affair45 and Czeslaw Milosz's The Captive Mind into English. The philosopher Hannah Arendt received assistance from the British 80 Alif 78 (2008)</page><page sequence="7">branch of the Congress for Cultural Freedom when researching her book The Origins of Totalitarianism.^ Literary organs, such as the Partisan Review, were financially aided by the State Department.47 The Congress for Cultural Freedom funded performances of the Boston Symphony in Paris. It produced Virgil Thompson's adaptation of Gertrude Stein's Four Saints in Three Acts', it sent African American musicians like Leontyne Price, Dizzy Gillespie, and Marian Anderson on tour throughout Western and Eastern Europe to stymie criticism of American racism.48 William Faulkner was avidly promot ed by the State Department to ensure that he would receive the Nobel Prize in Literature, as a cultural ambassador.49 Approximately two hundred million dollars were spent annually to purchase the cultural and political support of intellectuals and artists to produce a specific relation to culture.50 The Congress's efforts were reinforced by those of the IRD. Under the cover of publishers including Oxford University Press, Penguin, Allen Lane, and Fredrick Warburg,51 the IRD disseminated works by a dominant group of English intellectuals. It published Bertrand Russell's Why Communism Must Fail, disseminated essays by figures such as Richard Crossman, a Labor MP who edited the famous collection of anti-communist essays, The God that Failed; Harold Laski, author of Faith, Reason, and Civilization; and Ruth Fischer, the author of Stalin and German Communism.52 As Tom Braden, a CIA officer who later became a television celebrity, observed, "The Cold War was and is a war fought with ideas instead of bombs."53 Translatio Auctoritatis54 Initiatives like these structured Orwell's involvement with Britain's IRD, which, in April 1949, asked Orwell to identify writers and publishers who could assist the British government in its anticom munist propaganda campaign mostly in Southeast Asia. The IRD's report about their meeting with Orwell was entitled "Communist Strategy in South East Asia."55 Annotated by a member of the British Secret Intelligence Service named Lieutenant Colonel Leslie Sheridan, the IRD's memorandum recounted the substance of its conversation with Orwell; "I discussed some aspects of our work with him in great confidence," the IRD's Celia Kirwan wrote. She informed Orwell of the IRD's efforts to "expose" the "Soviet repression of the arts"56 and to further British colonial and postcolonial aims in Southeast Asia; "Orwell was delighted to learn of them. ... He expressed his whole AliflS (2008) 81</page><page sequence="8">hearted and enthusiastic approval of our aims."57 They discussed a book-publishing project, for which Orwell recommended his former publisher Victor Gollancz, who had brought out his The Road to Wigan Pier. Orwell also suggested several other writers for the IRD to hire: D'Arcy Gille, the Manchester Guardian's Paris correspondent, the biologist C. D. Darlington, and the historian Franz Borkenau, author of The Spanish Cockpit.58 Orwell's collaboration with the State was reproduced in the form of a relationship between the state and his works.59 In Iran, for example, the Foreign Office's Central Office of Information, anxious about the Soviet Union's activity in Azerbaijan, provided funds to Ali Javahir Kalam, the editor of the Tehran magazine Floor, to translate and publish Orwell's Animal Farm in Farsi (Inqilab-i hayavanat: girdavardah, "The Revolution of the Animals").60 In India, it financed Janamanci Ramakrsna's Telugu translation of Animal Farm, Pasuvula divanam: uhakalpitamaina peddakatha ("Animal Farm: A Fairy Tale"); in Kerala, a state in southwest India, it published and dis tributed a Malayalam translation by Em. Pi. Rosi (Animal pham: oru palankatha).6^ In Athens, it published a Greek translation;62 in Indochina, it published a Vietnamese one;63 and in Bandung, Indonesia, Animal Farm was published as Negara Binatang.64 On April 4, 1949, Ernest Main of the Information Department of the British embassy in Cairo wrote to the head of the IRD, Ralph Murray, that the embassy's staff was "very enthusiastic about the idea of an Arabic translation of Animal Farm."65 "It is generally agreed that [Animal Farm] would have excellent propaganda value and wide popular appeal in the Middle East," Rodwick Parkes, an information counselor at the British embassy in Cairo, wrote to the IRD's Ralph Murray.66 With the assistance of the US Information Exchange (the predecessor of the US Information Agency), the IRD found, for a translator, Abbas Hafez, an editor of the Arab News Agency in Cairo who had translated Winston Churchill's speeches as well as his War Memoirs into Arabic.67 The book was pub lished by the Al-Ma'arif Publishing House, a major Egyptian publisher that had the ability to distribute throughout the Middle East?in Beirut, Baghdad, Khartoum, Mecca, Bahrain, Aden, and throughout North Africa.68 Illustrated by a young Armenian artist, the Arabic translation was to "contain no references to the Information Department of the Embassy or the United States Information Exchange."69 If the dissemination of Orwell reinscribed the process by which both the United States and Britain methodically and laboriously con 82 AliflS (2008)</page><page sequence="9">structed its authority in the "Third World"?itself a Cold War con cept70?they did so by adapting and rewriting Orwell's work to con form to local cultural conditions: "With a skillful story-teller one should have thought that [Animal Farm] could be made into a very effective piece of propaganda down to a village-audience level," an official wrote about a cartoon version of Animal Farm.71 In Malaya, the site of Britain's longest colonial conflict after the Second World War (1948-1960), there was an effort to make a less "English" production of Animal Farm. In Egypt as well, where British authority faced mounting anti-colonial challenges to King Farouk, the IRD viewed Animal Farm as particularly "relevant" to conditions there. Reducing the Arabic lan guage to Islam, Ernest Main wrote Ralph Murray, the head of the IRD, that translating Animal Farm "is particularly good for Arabic in view of the fact that both pigs and dogs are unclean animals to Moslems."72 Shifting the emphasis away from the representations of Soviet commu nism and Western capitalism, the IRD illustrated the work, portraying the fictional character Napoleon not only as communist, but as an Englishman, thus conflating anti-communism with anti-colonialism.73 This process of dissemination involved the IRD's arranging for and financing cartoon strips of Animal Farm, featuring about ninety panels that were to run daily over a three-month period in local papers in dozens of countries, and in dozens of languages. The IRD purchased the rights to these in Borneo and Malaya, and published translations of the cartoon strip in New Delhi, Rangoon, Eritrea, Bangkok, Saigon, Caracas, Lima, Mexico City, Karachi, Ankara, Cyprus, Bogot?, Reykjavik, Rio de Janeiro, Singapore, Colombo, Ceylon, Benghazi, and Montevideo.74 The British diplomatic post in Singapore, "consid erably interested in the project," translated these strips into Chinese, Vietnamese, Malay, and French for distribution throughout Southeast Asia.75 In Mexico City, it was published in La Prensa; in New Delhi, in the Times of India; in Burma, in The Nation and Bamakkhit; and in Colombo, it was translated into Tamil and Sinhalese.76 While the encoded meaning of the various adaptations could not be controlled and had multiple valences in different cultural con texts, the works, nevertheless, produced communism as a threat through the very process of its distribution. In memorandum after memorandum, the IRD expressed a noticeable concern that while Animal Farm did not necessarily achieve its intentions of constituting anti-communist colonial subjects, it would, nevertheless, produce "communist reactions" from those who resisted its "Western" mean Alif2S (2008) 83</page><page sequence="10">ing. In Ankara, Bangkok, Montevideo, and Rangoon, the IRD asked its officers to monitor whether or not the work aroused any "resent ment among Communists," the better to be able to identify them as possible subversive subjects.77 While for the British the possibility of misreading was an occa sion to produce other adaptations of other works that conformed and adhered more closely to the semiotics of local and indigenous cul tures,78 the United States, on the other hand, employed Orwell's work as a means of controlling and extending its political, economic, and, to a lesser extent, cultural authority through the very process of the trans mission of Orwell's work. For example, in postwar Japan?which was under US Military Occupation from 1946 to 1952 as part of the Potsdam Accords?the American-dominated Supreme Command Allied Powers (SCAP) was faced with a vibrant and growing labor movement, which by February 1947 had posed a formidable resistance to the new terms of American economic development and investment there. As Misao Miyoshi writes: Assisted by the intensifying food and employment crisis throughout 1946 and spear-headed by Korean and non Japanese residents, unions were organized on an immense scale and prepared a united front for a general strike in February 1947_Although it began with SCAP's blessing and ended with SCAP's alarmed intervention, still it was as close as Japan ever came to worker's revolution.79 To produce this working-class movement as a threat, the SCAP's civilian division adapted Animal Farm in the popular form of a kamishibai, hanging scrolls composed of thirty-three large and colorful, cartoon-like panels that narrated a condensed and marked ly revised version of Orwell's satire. Composed by the United States Army's Civil Information and Education branch, the kamishibai were distributed to dozens of corporations, factories, government offices, and over forty labor unions, including the Hitachi Electric Workers Union, the Gumma-ken Teachers Union, the Takasaki National Railway Worker's Union, among others.80 Displayed prominently in the reconstructed factories, they were not only intended to democratize the labor movement,81 but also to present Japanese and Korean workers with a significantly altered and abbreviated adaptation of Orwell's fable. The pigs were repre 84 Alif2S (2008)</page><page sequence="11">sented as the object of even human admiration: "We are troubled by the animals of lower classes similar to you human beings struggling with labor problems," Napoleon declares.82 The kamishibai were far from effective in that they racialized the workers as animals, and rendered their relations to the means of production more transparent. Still, they served many functions aside from their role as anti-communist propaganda. The transmission itself became a means through which the occupying powers and its labor authorities could control, assess, and monitor the activities and tendencies of what was mostly a Korean and non-Japanese labor movement.83 In a report on "Reactions over the Showing of Animal Farm" an official wrote: The theme of the play was expressed in animal terms. This, from the standpoint of the workers, is very unpleasant because workers were represented by animals such as sheep, horses and pigs. It is hard to understand why labor officials showed such a picture. . . . [Some workers] thought it meant [they] must get rid of [the] labor bosses.84 As one historian has written, "C. I. &amp; E. encouraged conservative moves toward control in the moral sphere as the deepening Cold War set SCAP on its notorious 'Reverse Course' in favor of personalities and policies grounded in the old prewar, anti-communist authoritarianism."85 These publication campaigns structured, and further consolidat ed, Orwell's relationship to the State. As the IRD's Adam Watson wrote, they were a means of keeping Orwell "in the picture."86 During the summer of 1949, though debilitated physically by tuberculosis, Orwell devoted a considerable amount of his remaining energies arranging other similar agreements and projects with the IRD and the US government. He communicated with the IRD on numerous occa sions, not only about the Russian translation of Animal Farm, but about other initiatives involving the dissemination of Nineteen Eighty Four?which had been published to widespread acclaim only two months after he met with them in June 1949?as well. In August, he put together a list of the various translations of Animal Farm that had been completed, and then submitted it the IRD to enable them to pur sue similar projects with his more recent work: "I enclose three copies of the Telugu translation of Animal Farm," Orwell wrote Leonard Moore in a letter about the IRD's plans for a similar translation of AliflS (2008) 85</page><page sequence="12">Nineteen Eighty-Four Rights to the Burmese, Chinese, Danish, Dutch, French, German, Finnish, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Indonesian, Latvian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish, and Swedish translations were arranged and produced by the State.88 The IRD, for example, bought rights for the Burmese edition and, through the Orient Publishing Company in Hong Kong, arranged for an illus trated Chinese edition as well.89 Orwell was certainly aware of the dubious political uses to which Animal Farm could be put. In 1946, a Portuguese publisher in Lisbon, Livraria Popular de Francisco Franco, published a translation by Almirante Alberto Apr? entitled O Porco Triunfante (The Triumphant Pigs) 90 Shocked by the possibility that the pub lisher was tied to Franco's government, Orwell was apparently willing to overlook publishing in Salazar's Portugal, but certainly not with a press that had direct ties to a government that he had personally fought against. Orwell wrote to his agent Leonard Moore on November 9, 1945: I could not consider letting . . . [Livraria Popular de Francisco Franco] have the book if they have any con nection with Spanish fascists. ... It could do me a great deal of harm in this country if it got out, as it would. I know of course that Portugal itself has a semifascist regime and censorship of books must be pretty strict there, but it is a different matter to be definitely used as propaganda by Franco's lot.91 Moreover, a Dutch newspaper that had serialized Animal Farm had political ties to a reactionary and right-wing organization. As Orwell wrote to Moore: As to the Dutch publication of Animal Farm, I enclose a rather alarming letter from the publishers, which you might perhaps deal with. I am sure I don't know what arrangements we made about serialization, but if any thing irregular is happening, do please try and put a stop to it. As to the paper which is serialising it being "reac tionary," I don't know that we can help that. Obviously a book of that type is liable to be made use of by Conservatives, Catholics, etc.92 86 AliflS (2008)</page><page sequence="13">Orwell showed less self-possession and independence when it came to the British and American governments' sponsorship of his work. Of particular concern to Orwell was the distribution of Ihor Szewczenko's Ukrainian translation of Animal Farm (Kolhosp Tvaryn), most of the copies of which?to Orwell's consternation?never reached their intended destination in the Soviet Union. Five thousand of them had been seized en route by the American Military Government in Munich and turned over to officials of the Russian Repatriation Commission, who were undoubtedly grateful for the Americans' vigi lance.93 Nevertheless, the IRD rekindled Orwell's hopes of publishing and circulating Animal Farm in the Soviet Union; "I am trying to pull a wire at the Foreign Office to see if they will subscribe a bit," Orwell wrote Moore in July, describing his effort to get the IRD to arrange the translation, publication, and distribution of Animal Farm?** On June 24,1949, the IRD assisted Orwell on behalf of Possev, a small Russian exile journal that circulated within the Soviet-run refugee camps in Germany (and later became a prominent outlet for Russian Christian Democrats ?migr?s)?5 The editors of Possev had wanted to bring out Animal Farm in a Russian translation by Gleb Struve.96 Possev's editor Vladimir Gorachek wrote Orwell: It seems desirable to publish Animal Farm in book form and to issue it through the channels that we have in Berlin, Vienna, and other towns of the Soviet Occupation zones, whence, as has been proved in practice, Russian literature percolates into the ranks of the occupation army and through it into the USSR. We ask you please to not think that this letter has been sent to you with any merce nary motives, but exclusively in the interests of the cause of combating Bolshevism, which the cause of your book serves so brilliantly.97 By legitimizing the circulation of Orwell's work in Possev, the IRD, in effect, restructured Orwell's relationships to other publications subvented by the government. On July 18, the IRD's Celia Kirwan wrote Jack Brimmel, an official in the IRD that, "If Animal Farm does get through to the USSR as Possev claims it would, I am sure it would be most effective and eagerly sought after."98 In a letter to Orwell, the IRD confirmed that Possev was "reliable" and not pro-Czarist White Russians, and helped to arrange distribution of Animal Farm through AliflZ (2008) 87</page><page sequence="14">a variety of outlets, including the US Army magazine, Der Monat. On July 20, Orwell wrote Moore: "It occurs to me that the American army magazine Der Monat. . . might be a convenient way of financing the Russian translation of Animal Farm?'99 On July 28, 1949, Orwell wrote Moore: I have heard from the F[oreign] Offfice], who of course won't help to finance the Russian translation of Animal Farm. . . . We can use them [Possev] for help to distrib ute a Russian edition of Animal Farm, or at least for print ing it. Would you arrange with [Melvin] Lasky of Der Monat to hold over some Deutchmarks in case they are needed for this purpose?100 On September 21, Orwell wrote Melvin Lasky directly: "A Russian Displaced] P[ersons] paper in Limburg called Possev has recently serialized Animal Farm in a Russian translation, and are now printing an edition in book form. I told Moore to ask you to pay the required amount directly to the Possev people."101 His relationship with the IRD developed into a set of transat lantic arrangements with the Voice of America, the US Information Agency, the State Department, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the US Army of Occupation in Germany. On November 4, 1949, an IRD official informed the director of the Voice of America, Charles Thayer, that it was already in the process of translating Nineteen Eighty-Four into Italian, French, Swedish, Dutch, Danish, German, Spanish, Norwegian, Polish, Ukrainian, Portuguese, Persian, Telugu, Japanese, Hebrew, Bengali, and Gujerati.102 In Japan, the US Military High Command oversaw the transfer of royalties from Keisuke Nagashima's Japanese translation of Animal Farm (Dobutsu nojo) to the British embassy. US Colonel E. C.

In addition, the State Department purchased foreign translation rights to Nineteen Eighty Four in Tamil, Malayalam, Kanarese, Telugu, Urdu, Icelandic and Bengali.105 Korean, German, and Polish translations were soon issued, and other editions distributed to any US embassy that wanted them.106 Acheson advised the American Embassy in London to ensure that the Livraria de Francisco Franco?the same publisher with which Orwell had shown some concern?as well as a Vietnamese publisher, keep Animal Farm in print.107 In addition, US government officials exerted their authority and pressured American and British publishers to arrange for the distribu tion of Nineteen Eighty-Four in countries such as India. "I had a visit from a somewhat vague individual from Washington," Orwell's pub lisher, Fredrick Warburg, wrote Allen Lane; "He is concerned with the distribution of certain books of alleged propaganda value throughout the world, and the one title which he mentioned was Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, and the one territory in which he seemed to be particu larly interested was India."108 If there had been some concern that Animal Farm was not suit able to the uneven and different cultural and political conditions out side of Europe, in Czechoslovakia, American officials saw the work as highly applicable to the political conditions there. On May 11, 1951, Richard Gordon, a Vice Consular in the US Embassy in Prague, wrote the Department of State that Animal Farm had, in fact, addressed more than anti-communism, in that it registered pressures from the country side on the m?tropole?precisely conditions that had, according to Gordon, obtained in Czechoslovakia: Orwell's use of a farm as the setting for his anti Communist satire is particularly appropriate to the Czechoslovak reader. The economic-social structure of Czechoslovakia is evenly balanced as between agriculture and industry, but almost every citizen has close ties to the countryside and the farm, i.e., with his own farm, the farm of his parents on which he grew up, or the farm of his grandparents which he used to visit. An anti-Communist story based on farm life is likely to appeal to more Czechoslovaks than a book with an industrial or metro / /28 (2008) 89</page><page sequence="16">politan setting_The Czechoslovak people should read ily identify themselves with the decent animals of Animal Farm, and should easily appreciate the parallels between their own story and that of Animal Farm.109 Global Systems of Literature and Reproduction As a result of these transatlantic agreements and accommodations, official adaptations of Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-Four became immensely important to the process of constituting Soviet threats on a con certed and methodically organized scale. Founded in June 1948 by the US National Security Council, the Office of Special Projects (OSP), a division that was overseen variously by the Department of State as well as the Central Intelligence Agency, was charged with the task of developing the means and content of what had come to be known as 'psychological war fare,' the intention of which was to expose the 'vicious activities of the USSR.' Among the OSP's first, and perhaps most elaborate, cultural ini tiatives was its involvement in the production, rewriting, and distribution of the 1955 feature-length animation of Orwell's Animal Farm. Produced by Louis de Rochemont?a Hollywood executive who had directed one of the first documentary films of the 1930s, The March of Time?OrweWs satire was widely acclaimed in official circles as politically and culturally rele vant to furthering the aims of the cultural Cold War. "It seems to us that it would not be difficult to concoct a script embodying local touches which might provide an alternative means of making people aware of this ... very effective piece of political satire," the IRD wrote of Animal Farm to its posts in Baghdad, Jakarta, Cairo, Rangoon, Asmara, and Teheran.110 The film was directed and animated by John Halas, a Hungarian exile, and Joy Batchelor, a graduate of the London School of Art, who were ideally suited for the work. Though they would go on to direct pop ular American television programs, such as "The Lone Ranger" (1966), "The Jackson Five" (1971), "The Osmond Brothers" (1972), and "The Addams Family" (1973), as well as several corporate films for oil com panies like ESSO, Royal Dutch Shell, and British Petroleum,111 the two artists had had considerable experience working for Britain's Central Office of Information during the Second World War. They produced more than one hundred films during the war, mostly documentary ani mations, including the Dustbin Parade (1941), a navy recruitment film, Filling the Gap (1941), an exhortation to boost domestic agricultural pro duction, and Abuys Pointed Well (1942), a wartime propaganda anima tion that was aimed at audiences in Egypt, Palestine, Iran, and Iraq. 90 Alif 2S (2008)</page><page sequence="17">As Britain's first commercial, feature-length animated cartoon, Halas and Batchelor's Animal Farm (1955) was revised to conform to the ideologically and methodically elaborated structures of the Cold War. Reviewing the conclusion of the Halas-Batchelor script,112 the Office of Special Projects found it "confusing" and "nebulous,"113 and, under pressure from the producer de Rochemont,114 shifted Orwell's critique of capitalist and communist exploitation to focus on, and emphasize exclusively, the brutality of communist repression. As part of its efforts to disseminate Orwell's work, both the British and US governments pursued what amounted to a global cam paign. Fearing that the dictates of the market would give this censored animation little exposure, the IRD intended to "show the film in all our colonies on as wide a scale as possible."115 Indonesia, Burma, Siam, India, Ceylon, Pakistan, and Indochina116 "presented an ideal audi ence for Orwell's warning."117 To complement the dissemination of the film, the IRD saturated the colonies with cartoon strips to which it bought rights in Cyprus, Tanganyika, Kenya, Uganda, North and South Rhodesia, Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast, Nigeria, Trinidad, Jamaica, Fiji, British Guiana and Honduras.118 In the US, the govern ment, through organizations such as the American Congress for Cultural Freedom, made a concerted effort to insure that Animal Farm reached the widest possible audience, particularly among the working classes. The CIA's American Committee for Cultural Freedom, for example, distributed discount tickets to the film to the Long Island branch of the United Auto Workers union, and scolded the manage ment of New York's Paris Theatre for failing to promote the film's "anti-communist message": If for no other reason than in respect for George Orwell's memory, would you not agree that the public ought to know that this is a great anti-totalitarian film? The neglect of this factor in the promotion for the film is not quite understandable to us, especially in view of public concern about the threat of Soviet totalitarianism, and we wonder if there is any special reason why Orwell's vigorous indictment of our enemy should not be described as such.119 It arranged for editorials in New York newspapers in order to affirm its revised, anti-communist, message.120 AliflS (2008) 91</page><page sequence="18">The very process by which Orwell's own work was disseminated, produced, distributed, adapted, rewritten, and made visible developed out a relationship between the State and a set of practices in which he active ly participated.121 On April 22, 1949, Orwell's US publisher Eugene Reynal, the vice president of Harcourt and Brace, wrote the FBI director J. Edgar Hoover "to [help] call [Nineteen Eighty-Four] to the attention of the American public and thus, perhaps, helping to halt totalitarianism.... If you have an opportunity to read this book and are willing to give us a statement, we will make every effort to bring it to the widest possible audi ence," Reynal wrote.122 While Hoover was unwilling "to lend his endorsement to a commercial publication," the US Department of Justice did, however, monitor the magazine and newspaper reviews of Animal Farm as a way of identifying the sources of political dissent in the US. Even Yale University's George Orwell Forum had been the focus of a 1960 FBI investigation, which, in the end, found that the symposiums posed no real threat to the rhythms of college life at Yale.123 As I have been trying to adduce, Orwell's participation and col laboration with the IRD helped to establish and even consolidate the social, political, and cultural processes and relations by which his own writings were translated, adapted, and, above all, disseminated. Never before in the history of literature had works like Orwell's Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-Four been so rapidly translated, serialized, adapt ed, and distributed in ways that fundamentally reshaped what Pascale Casanova has called in her remarkable book, The World Republic of Letters, "the world literary space." For Casanova, such a space is defined by the processes of legitimation, consecration, and authoriza tion. She argues that there the is a kind of brokerage and even trade bal ance that is presided over by the often overlooked, but fundamental, role of translators in mediating the entire category of literary value or liter ariness?in sum, creating internationally recognizable figures at a recent history initiates the globalization of literature in ways we are only now beginning to acknowledge and take into critical account.124 Orwell and his oeuvre emerge as part of a process through which British colonialism was rearticulated through the institutions and discourse of anti-communism. Yet, what needs to be stressed is not necessarily only the question of anti-communist values or their various adaptations, but more importantly, the power and the exercise of its transmission along entirely re-territorialized lines. "Whatever the relationship of the work to its initial audience," John Guillory observes, the writing has other relations to other works as well: 92 / /28 (2008)</page><page sequence="19">It is precisely this failure to make such a distinction that is the premise upon which "tradition" rests and serves as an ideology?one that obfuscates not only the vast set of rela tions that exist, but the function of it is as something of a value. If canonical works do not all by themselves repro duce cultural values, it is significant?even integral?to the real social process that they are thought to do so. The real social process is the reproduction not of values, but of social relations. These relations consist of much more than a relation [between the] text and [the] reader.125 The enlarged relationship between Orwell's works and his audience, which entailed various modes through which his work was dissemi nated, was not about the reproduction of "values"?the "value" of "capitalist democracy" versus the "value" of "communism," but rather, as Guillory suggests, a reproduction of social relationships that appear as the reproduction of "values." Activities through which Orwell's works were processed, circulated, and globalized, essentially consolidated a postcolonial order by rearticulating British colonialism through the discourse and institution of American anti-communism. The effect of these endeavors to disseminate "cultural values" in the ceaseless war between "totalitarianism" and "democracy" was to rein force and reproduce existing social relationships against ongoing anti colonial and emancipatory challenges to it. Notes 1 Bernard Crick, George Orwell: A Life (London: Penguin, 1980), 556. Written after Orwell's experience in the Spanish Civil War, both Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-Four are imaginative accounts of the failure of both the Spanish and Bolshevik revolutions to achieve the ideals which Orwell shared, but saw corrupted in their actuality. Animal Farm is an allegory of the betrayal of the original ideals and aims of the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917. The characters are, with a few exceptions, farm ani mals with anthropomorphic qualities, each of which retains attributes that refer them to a historical figure. Old Major (an amalgam of Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin) encourages the animals to resist Farmer Jones (Tsar Nicolas II), who forces them to toil and live in harsh conditions in Manor Farm. Upon Major's death, the pigs, lead by Napoleon (Joseph Stalin) and Snowball (Leon Trotsky), organize a revolution against Jones. They take AliflS (2008) 93</page><page sequence="20">control of the farm, establish a commune in the name of Major's ideas of "animalism," and rename the farm "Animal Farm." Like Leon Trotsky, however, Snowball is killed by Napoleon and declared a counter-revolu tionary. Protected by the fierce dogs they have trained (who represent the NKVD, later the KGB), Napoleon and the other pigs eventually seize con trol of Animal Farm for themselves on the grounds that some animals are "more equal than others." Napoleon, who has taken to dressing in Jones's "Sunday clothes" and lives, unlike the other animals, in luxury in Jones's farmhouse, renames the land "Manor Farm," and forms an alliance with Farmer Pilkington, who once fought against the animals after their revo lution. In the end, the animals can no longer distinguish the pigs from the humans. Old Major's (i. e. Marx's) dreams are betrayed. In contrast, Nineteen Eighty-Four reduces power to one singular polit ical tendency. More than any other work of twentieth-century fiction, it supplies the general and prevailing image of totalitarianism in Western Europe and the United States. Set in the future in London?which is part of the vast and oppressive empire known as Oceania, constantly at war with either Eastasia or Eurasia?Nineteen Eighty-Four recounts the pro gressive disillusionment and the ultimate, mental and physical, destruc tion of Winston Smith. An outer Party clerk in the Records Department of the Ministry of Truth, Smith spends most of his workday reconstructing and rewriting historical events for The Times, in order to ensure that the past conforms with the political exigencies of the present?one ruled sin gularly and arbitrarily by an ominous figure called Big Brother. Subjected to forms of absolute social control, supervision, and administration, Winston lives, like the other subjects of Airstrip One (London), in a des olate and ruined world. The Party (of which there is only one) observes everything, from the slightest physical gesture to the merest expression of human sexuality. Through various forms of surveillance (such as the "Thought-Police," the "two-way telescreens," and the vigilant youth groups), the power of Big Brother is most significantly embodied in the Party's effort to devise an official language called "Newspeak"?one that will erase from the English language words such as "freedom," "truth," and "justice," presumably making such enlightened concepts collectively unknowable. Yet, Smith, privy to these activities as a clerk in the Ministry of Truth, resists these homogenizing conformities imposed upon him, and defies the Party. He dares to keep a diary. He violates the sexual codes imposed by the regime, and has a love affair with another party member, Julia, with whom he conspires to overthrow Big Brother. He shares his hopes with an inner Party member, whom he mistakes as sympathetic to 94 AliflS (2008)</page><page sequence="21">his ideas of resistance. O'Brien, the inner Party member, administers Winton's detention and torture, subjecting Smith to forms of violence he could have never imagined. Whatever elements of human dignity Winston had are stripped of him; he is, in the end, reduced to a lifeless and ghost ly figure of bare life?"the last man of Europe," as Orwell had hoped to title the work we now know as Nineteen Eighty-Four. 2 Crick, George Orwell: A Life, 638. 3 Michael Shelden, George Orwell: The Authorized Biography (NY: Harper Collins, 1991), 429. 4 The identities of thirty-six of them remain concealed by the British Foreign Office. 5 George Orwell, The Complete Works of George Orwell, ed.
