<plain_text><page sequence="1">Explanation and Reconstruction in Cultural Evolution By Charles J. Erasmus Interest in cultural evolution is still much alive in American anthro- pology, but this sub-field has never been vitally concerned with modern development problems of directed culture change. In fact, cultural evo- lution as a field of study seems to be moving ever closer to ethnohistory and prehistory. As an anthropologist both sympathetic to the evolutio- nary point of view and active in the field of directed culture change, I have long been puzzled by this separation of interests. Explaining that separation and evaluating its implications for anthropology are the tasks of this essay. To accomplish my objectives I shall critically com- pare recent contributions to the field of cultural evolution under two headings - studies of adaptation and studies of progress. Since these categories resemble Sahlins' (1960) distinction between specific and general evolution, I shall begin by indicating how my position differs from Sahlins' Organic Evolution and Sociocultural Development George Gaylord Simpson's The Meaning of Evolution is now twenty years old, but its statements on the differences between progress and evolution and between organic evolution and cultural development are as valid today as when the book was first published. I do not share Sahlins' (1960: 39) opinion that Simpson is confused and unable "to rise above" a phylogenetic perspective. If there is confusion anywhere, it is Sahlins'. According to Simpson (1949: 243, 261 - 262, 285 - 286) progress is not an essential feature of the evolution of organic life. It "has occurred within it but is not of its essence. Aside from the broad tendency for the expansion of life, which is also inconstant, there is no sense in which it can be said that evolution is progress". Nevertheless, Simpson con- cludes that a majority of the objective criteria of progress "show that man is among the highest products of evolution and a balance of them warrants the conclusion that man is, on the whole but not in every single respect, the pinnacle so far of evolutionary progress". The fact</page><page sequence="2">Eplanation and Reconstruction in Cultural Evolution 21 that man is the only species making this claim is part of the evidence supporting it. Certainly there is no reason why one should not review the history of life according to some criterion of progress as long as one realizes that this is a descriptive or evaluative task rather than an explanatory one. To pick those branches of the tree of life which lead to man and make these the chosen line of progressive development is perfectly justifiable as a heuristic, descriptive or evaluative device. But to use it as an explanation for man's appearance would be finalistic and a return to vitalism. It would make man the product of goal-directed forces rather than the result of "non-predictive determinism" (Simpson 1950: 267). Goal direction as explanation in organic evolution is ille- gitimate teleology. In explaining cultural development, goal direction or goal intention are legitimate explanatory factors. While strictly anthropomorphic in an organic context, they are anthropomorphous in a cultural one. This is not to say that goal intention is ever a sufficient part of cultural explanation; but it is the necessary part that makes cultural develop- ment qualitatively different from organic evolution. Simpson (1949: 288 - 289) recognizes this fact when he refers to cultural development as "the new evolution" and warns that the "difference in kind" between this and "organic evolution" makes the two analogous, not equivalent. "In organic evolution new factors arise as mutations without volition and without any fixed equivalence to needs or desires ... In the new evolution new factors arise as elements in consciousness ... in rela- tionship to needs and desires of individuals and ... to the individual's perception and judgments of the needs and desires of a social group." This important qualitative difference between cultural development and organic evolution is erased by Leslie White's disciples in their contention that organic evolution and cultural evolution are homologous rather than simply analogous processes (Harding, Kaplan, Sahlins and Service 1960: 9). Sahlins' (1960: 29, 30) division of evolution into "spe- cific" and "general" aspects with equivalent applications to biology and culture adds only confusion, not clarity, to the problems of under- standing development. Sahlins sees the "objectives of general evolu- tionary research" as the "explanation of the successive transformations of culture through its several stages of overall progress". These objec- tives lie in a different direction from those of specific evolutionary research which are concerned with "adaptive modification". But if the study of progress offers homologous explanatory procedures for both biology and culture they must either involve an illegitimate teleology in the biological sphere, or they must lack the teleologica! quality legi-</page><page sequence="3">22 Charles J. Erasmus tímate to them in the cultural. The latter would seem to be the case and conforms to this "school's" antagonism to psychological "reductio- nism". It does not matter whether or not anthropologists continue to use the phrase "cultural evolution" as long as they do not confuse it with bio- logical evolution. I prefer to restrict "evolution" to the organic realm and use "development" for the new evolution. I also prefer to keep "progress" and "development" conceptually distinct. Reviewing past developments in the light of desirable expectations for the future, we can find progress in some and decadence, vested interest, inconsistency or redundancy in others. Concern with progress can also be viewed as a legitimate teleological component of much of modern development. As development takes place, it leads to réévaluations of past goals that may affect future developments. I shall return to this point later. Adaptation As the following examples show, studies of adaptation may be re- stricted to an historically continuous geographical area (a single cultu- ral "genus"), or they may compare widely separated cases. In either event they are concerned with relatively concrete models; the cases for which the model holds are specified and discussed. Since the number of societies involved tends to be limited by geographic circumstances (historical continuity of area or similarity of environment), there is an attempt to exhaust the total population of cases. Some adaptive models however may be based on only one or two societies without being clearly committed to any larger class. In such instances the suggestion of wider applicability may be present without any attempt to delineate class boundaries. The concreteness of most adaptation studies leads to a concern with explanation. However, when the case material has not been collected by the model-maker or when he has collected "oral history" from a few informants, the explanation is largely in terms of situational factors. There may be underlying assumptions of psychological drives or goal intentions, but these tend to be avoided in favor of system-maintenance or social survival implications. Although he advocates "general" evolutionary studies, Sahlins' major contributions are highly "specific". As such they are excellent examples of the more explanatory quality of adaptive studies when compared to the descriptive and critical emphases that characterize most studies of progress. In his study of social stratification in Polynesia, Sahlins (1958: 248) is concerned with a single geographic area within which he</page><page sequence="4">Eplanation and Reconstruction in Cultural Evolution 23 views the various island cultures as "historically related". In fact these "historically related groups" in their "environmentally diverse areas" are "members of a single cultural genus which has undergone . . . 'adap- tive radiation'". But even this specific study illustrates the important difference between cultural development and organic evolution. For the "adaptive radiation" of this "cultural genus" does not simply provide a history of unique speciations as Sahlins portrays it. The adaptive radiation leads to such parallel results on different islands that they can be grouped into a series of four classes representing four orders of complexity which may or may not be sequential; he designates these Group I, IIA, IIB and III. Moving from category I to category III, he shows how some island environments have favored a more intensive and productive exploitation of resources which in turn has favored greater development of economic redistribution, stratification, and cen- tralized control of production. Sahlins' study emphasizes covariation between environment and stra- tification with technology as an intermediate variable. He is not at- tempting to give a sufficient explanation for cultural variation in Poly- nesia. Rather, he indicates by correlation one of the most determining factors in that variation - differences in the physical environment. He does not employ goal intention or such psychological tendencies as prestige motivation or a drive for power to move his human actors to greater cultural development. He does not even employ survival advant- age in the context of competitive warfare to achieve that end. The end is given him by the "cultural genus" with which he starts, and diffusion and migration thus suffice to activate "radiation". This explains why "For example, ceremonial sanctification of chieftainship in Pukapuka and Tokalau was more elaborate than the economic and social role of the chief warranted. This can be interpreted as a survival of practices of stratification in a relatively nonadaptive domain of culture, ideology, as these islands were settled from high islands where stratification was probably greater" (Sahlins 1958: 250). Unlike Sahlins, Julian Steward does not base his classes ("culture types") on cases selected from the same culture area. Such comparisons would render classificatory "uniformities" (among historically inter- dependent cases) rather than true cross-cultural "regularities" (among historically independent cases) (Steward 1955: 88). Although Steward's explanations of his "types" are largely oriented toward the limitations of the physical environment, it would seem that Sahlins' procedure establishes a better control for judging environmental limitations. Given the same cultural "genus" spreading among a diversity of ecological niches, one can observe how much of the total complex can be sustained under different environmental circumstances. Although Sahlins (1960:</page><page sequence="5">24 Charles J. Erasmus 43 - 44) regards Steward as following a specific evolutionary approach rather than the "general" kind he advocates, his own major comparative effort in evolutionary analysis is much more "specific" than what Julian Steward normally attempts. The "eras" of Steward's (1955: 178 - 209) "trial formulation of the development of early civilizations" represent his major attempt to deli- neate sequential classes. While these are not dominance levels in the sense of Elman Service's bands and tribes or Morton Fried's egalitarian and rank societies, they are broadly comparative. But as in all Steward's classes or types, comparisons are fixed on a concrete group of cases. His "eras" pertain to five "cradles of civilization" - Mesopotamia, Egypt, China, Meso-America and Northern Peru, all in "arid or semi- arid" environments. Similarly, Steward's "patrilineal band" and "com- posite hunting band" are "culture types" that apply to specific cases. These types are at roughly the same "level of sociocultural integration", are not necessarily sequential, and do not represent levels of dominance. Steward's interest in his types or classes has always been strongly explanatory: "Causal interrelationship of types must be established in sequential or synchronic terms, or both" (1955: 181). His concrete model of sequential causal interrelationships in early civilizations is limited to those cases occurring within a particular kind of environment favoring the development of irrigation. The latter leads to increasing producti- vity, specialization, population pressures, competition among states and between social classes within states. Neither goal intention nor psycho- logical tendencies receives much attention in his scheme, which is de- voted principally to the relevant situational factors. The goal intentions leading to irrigation developments - the pursuit of wealth and the exploitation of one class by another - are left implicit. Much the same is true of his synchronic types. The patrilineal band is a concrete model based on a range of documented cases. The essential or "core" features of his model are again "determined within exceedingly narrow limits by the cultural ecology - by the interaction of technology and environ- ment" (Steward 1955: 134 - 136). He employs one "cultural-psycholo- gical fact, which cannot be explained by local adaptation", the tendency for kinsmen in intimate association "to extend incest taboos from the biological family to the extended family thus requiring group exoga- my". And goal intention is implied in explaining the patrilineality of the band: "the male wishes to remain in country he knows." In collaboration with R. F. Murphy, Steward (1956: 353) proposes an acculturation model that applies under certain circumstances to "tap- pers, trappers, and no doubt other collectors". This model is concretely based on two groups - the Mundurucú and the Northeastern Algon-</page><page sequence="6">Eplanation and Reconstruction in Cultural Evolution 25 kians - although further comparisons are made to indicate that it can be applied to a wider range of cases. Adaptation in this model involves both a particular physical environment and a particular form of socio- cultural integration with "the larger nation". Because the Mundurucú were observed personally by Murphy, they provide the bulk of the case material. The first hand nature of the case material seems to lead to more explicit use of goal intention as an explanatory ingredient than in Steward's other models. Resource conservation through one-man exploitation of limited territories results from the incentive to main- tain resource productivity. Moreover the natives' demand and need for manufactured goods is an expanding incentive for barter arrangements with particular merchants. The latter conserve their exploitative ad- vantage over the natives by "a gentleman's agreement" not to interfere with each others' debtor-trader relationships; this keeps the relation- ships particular and exploitative rather than competitive and open (Murphy and Steward 1956: 347). The tapper-trapper model could easily be restated in the vocabulary of decision-making theory. Like the tapper-trapper model, Marshall Sahlins' (1961: 324) concrete model of the segmentary lineage as "an organization of predatory ex- pansion" is also based on two cases but it involves two significant dif- ferences from the Steward approach. First, Sahlins links his "specific" evolutionary analysis to a larger "general progressive aspect of evo- lution" and second, he does not rely on goal-intention forms of expla- nation. As in all the previous cases except the "Tappers", this is a study based on secondary sources. His adaptive model is a specific form of tribal sociocultural organization and applies only to situations where a "neolithic mode of production" and the segmented social organization of tribal society prevail (Sahlins 1961: 325 - 326). Moreover it develops only in a tribe intruding "into an already occupied habitat"; for if the environment is open, only the normal segmentation process would occur. The segmentary lineage is a special tribal system which develops only "in competition between societies of the tribal level" (Sahlins 1961: 342). And just as it would not have any special adaptive advantage in an open environment, it would have none in a competitive environ- ment against bands or chiefdoms. Against bands it would be a super- fluous advantage and against chiefdoms it would be ineffective. Situa- tional factors and adaptive survival value are the principal explanatory considerations of the model. But the general dominance levels of bands, tribes, and chiefdoms are used to clarify the situational factors. In doing so the proposed type is positioned within a larger developmental spectrum. Steward never ties in to any general levels of dominance. The sequential classes of his early civilizations are too concrete, too peculiar to the limited universe of cases for which they were devised,</page><page sequence="7">26 Charles J. Erasmus to have wider applicability. Similarly his tapper-trapper model is one of many kinds of adaptation that can occur in the transition of native- ness to "nationness". One wonders why one searches for one type rather than another and what one is to do with the types after finding them. Whether or not levels of dominance may actually be misleading or simply descriptive rather than explanatory, they provide a heuristic sense of order and well being about the over-all objectives of typo- logizing. When adaptive models are based upon a single case they may be considered representative of a larger range of cases not yet explored. In other instances they are models only for a particular group or region. Vayda's (1961) two models of "warlike expansion" are based on the Maoris and the Ibans but pertain to other unspecified members of a common class - swidden agriculturists. Both models employ goal- intention components but the Maori model comes closest to approximat- ing a strategy. In it, fighting to obtain lands covered by secondary growth and then clearing the secondary growth is considered less costly than clearing virgin land. In the second model "incentives of material profit and social prestige" lead young men into a kind of "pioneering" warfare by which new land is "learned about" and other tribes driven from it (Vayda 1961: 351-353). Wayne Suttles (1960) and Louise Sweet (1965) offer similar explana- tory models for potlatching and camel raiding respectively. Both are concerned with a single culture and a specific adaptation. Both explain in the vocabulary of system-maintenance functionalism. Both exclude goal intention and psychological tendencies from their explicit schemes in which they emphasize only situational and social survival factors. Both make historical reconstructions based on oral tradition and pre- vious accounts. The credibility of the older of the two studies has al- ready been greatly reduced in a recent "reexamination of the Southern Kwakiutl Potlatch" (Drucker and Heizer 1967: 137 - 150). According to Suttles (1960: 303 - 304) the "most important function" of the potlatch is to be found "in the redistribution of wealth" by which "the community that has converted its surplus food into wealth and now has a surplus of wealth gets rid of its wealth by giving it away at a potlatch". Since the environment is characterized by "spatial and temporal variation and fluctuation in the variability of resources", food is exchanged for non-comestible forms of wealth in a process that equalizes food consumption among communities for the enhanced survival value of all. Since wealth tends to gravitate to the communities with better resources, these redistribute the wealth through the pot- latch thereby "restoring purchasing power" to the rest and acquiring</page><page sequence="8">Eplanation and Reconstruction in Cultural Evolution 27 status for themselves. The principle objection of Drucker and Heizer (1967: 143, 145) is that adjacent villages suffered the same scarcities while more remote communities were hostile. They believe "Suttles' informants may have oversystematized their descriptions" and regard contradictory information obtained by Barnett twenty years earlier more reliable. Sweet (1965: 1148 - 1149) makes clear that her interviewing on raiding customs was very limited. Most of her data is from historical sources and these include no "participant observation study of a camel breeding Bedouin tribe". Essentially her argument is that the Bedouin sociocultural system depended for its survival on diversified herds of camels. But "localized fluctuations of necessary pasturages and water resources" resulted in periodic local reductions. Reciprocal camel raid- ing according to a system of rules and etiquette that minimized damage and loss of life maintained a circulation of camels that in turn insured Bedouin survival in a position of ecological dominance. Sweet (1965: 1142, 1143 - 1146) does not entertain goal-intentions in her explanation. With reference to the initiation of raids she says, "One might infer a 'felt shortage' of camels . . . but this does not fit with the evidence for reciprocal raiding as a continuously employed mechanism of intertribal exchange of camels. For raiding is a continuous practice . . . and not a simple, direct customary response to particular and temporary economic fluctuations - losses through drought, disease or other factors ... It is an institutionalized, regular activity". It is a "system-sustaining me- chanism" for "redistribution" that tends to compensate for the fluc- tuations without being a goal-intended response. It is a mechanism that has had survival value for Bedouins given the peculiar situational factors of the "bedouin niche". Tight systemic analyses based on one case have an air of concreteness that may be misleading. When reconstructed from the oral history of a few informants, they can too readily depend on a selection of facts biased toward the investigator's theoretical expectations. Such a study may be nothing more than an erroneous illustration of a model impli- citly analytic. Progress Studies of progress are usually much less concrete than adaptive studies, for they tend to be concerned with sequential classes far more extensive than the case material on which they are based. For this reason the authors themselves may regard their sequential classes as pilot attempts requiring more ethnohistorical verification (Fried 1967: 174, 206, 224; Service 1962: 182).</page><page sequence="9">28 Charles J. Erasmus Although studies of progress may involve some social or professional criticism, they are primarily descriptive. The explanation of sequential classes is clearly secondary to the task of describing their content. But because that content is illustrative rather than exhaustive or statistical, the breadth of the categories results in sketchy criteria. This lack of precision in defining categories in turn results in sketchy explanations. Since situational factors understandably become less important than in adaptive studies, explanations frequently become little more than pro- nouncements of survival value. V. Gordon Childe's (1936) well known description of human progress, written during the depression of the 1930's, is unusual in several re- spects when compared to more recent efforts. It comes much closer to being a work of social criticism; it does not give as much emphasis to stages or levels of dominance, and it is more concrete in its historical reporting. Convinced that "impersonal" history can "still justify a belief in progress", Childe (1936: 9) measures the success of the human species by the increase of its members. Although his two "revolutions" - neo- lithic and urban - mark important epochs along his historical continu- um, he does not attempt to characterize sequential classes based on inter-cultural comparisons. His panoramic report on the prehistory of Europe and the Near East is tied concretely to the specific times and places important for his story. Progress in Childe's terms is not concerned with survival value con- tests among different human cultures and societies. The human species adapts to nature by expanding its food supply and with it is numbers, leisure and knowledge. Without building any unifying explanatory theory, he embellishes his report with casual explanatory sketches as does any good historian. Attention is paid to ecology, for example, when he relates the development of the state to "the need for extensive public works to drain and irrigate the land" on "large alluvial plains and riverside flatlands" (1936: 115). But his most common form of ex- planatory embellishment, much of which is implicit, is that of goal intention. We read that "most probably the first tools served a multi- tude of purposes" (1936: 46); "Intelligent exploitation of an eminently favorable environment enabled the Aurignacian hunters to multiply beyond all former inhabitants" (1936: 53); "Magdalenian art was ... practical in its aim and designed to ensure a supply of those animals on which the tribe depended for its food" (1936: 56); "food-production, even in its simplest form, provides an opportunity and a motive for the accu- mulation of a surplus" which "ultimately . . . may constitute a basis for rudimentary trade" (1936: 71). And, of course, goal-intended behavior has its unanticipated consequences as well: "The desire for gold, stones, and shells on account of magic properties supposedly resident in them</page><page sequence="10">Eplanation and Reconstruction in Cultural Evolution 29 had important practical consequences. It was a potent factor in breaking down the economic isolation of peasant communities" (1936: 94). The goal-intended machinations of self-interest are most apparent when Childe (1936: 182 - 183) concludes his book with a consideration of factors retarding progress. Exploitation of the masses by the ruling class in the incipient state societies results in subservience to supersti- tion. Early inventions began as labor-saving devices, but the new rulers with their "almost unlimited reserves of labor" had "few incentives to encourage invention". And thus we see another form of embellishment common to descriptions of progress. Although Childe (1936: 187) finds it "childish to ask why man did not progress straight from the squalor of a 'pre-class' society to the glories of a classless paradise", he has thereby converted his panoramic description of progress into a veiled social criticism, obvious enough in the midst of an economic depression. Leslie White's criterion of progress has been a technological energy- capture which neither he nor his disciples have ever fully succeeded in operationalizing. His original article on the subject in the American Anthropologist (1943) is a fascinating mixture of explanation, profes- sional criticism and a brief description of progress on his terms. Accept- ing only the energy factor in White's equation while holding motivation and habitat constant, as he suggests, the explanatory quality of his po- sition becomes very finalistic. It is not necessary to do this, however, because White reduces the vitalistic implications of his argument when he asks "why" questions at two points in his paper: why culture in general evolves and why more specifically "agricultural arts" did not advance between 2000 BC and 1800 AD (1943: 339, 347). In the first case man is endowed with a psychological constant, "the biological urge to live, the power to invent and to discover, the ability to select and use the better of two tools or ways of doing something". But "whatever may have been the intentions and motives (if any) of the inventors or discoverers of the bow and arrow, the wheel, the furnace and forge, the steam engine, the microscope, etc., the fact remains that these things have been seized upon by mankind and employed to make life more secure, comfortable, pleasant and permanent. So we may disregard the psychological circumstances under which new cultural devices were brought into being" (White 1943: 339 - 340). In the second case advancement ceased "for lack of incentive", and here White (1943: 348) echoes Childe. "No incentive to progress came from the ruling class in the ancient civilizations . . . What they appropriated from their sub- jects they consumed or wasted. To obtain more wealth the ruling class merely increased taxes, rents, or other levies upon the producers of wealth. This was easier, quicker, and surer than increasing the efficiency</page><page sequence="11">30 Charles J. Erasmus of production and thereby augmenting the total product. On the other hand, there was no incentive to progress among the masses - if they produced more by increasing efficiency it would only mean more for the tax-gatherers of the ruling class." When White is dealing with the machinations of social class his line of reasoning approaches what is now labeled "game theory" or "decision-making theory". In this context he is less inclined to "disregard the psychological circumstances". However, White's predilection for social criticism has always been overshadowed by his commitment to professional criticism. His oppo- sition to psychological reductionism has never allowed him to develop an explanatory framework compatable with an interest in social action. Although he has been active professionally in attempting to influence his colleagues, the inconsistency between this behavior and his views on explanation has apparently never bothered him. Sahlins (1960: 20 - 21) has endeavored to formalize a modified version of White's criterion of progress through his concept of "general evolu- tion". Instead of the efficiency with which energy is harnessed, sheer quantity or "thermodynamic achievement" becomes his modified crite- rion. Although Sahlins does not succeed in operationalizing its measure- ment, he justifies its use by quoting an authoritative folk-saying: "A man's reach should exceed his grasp." And by assuming what he fails to demonstrate, he equates "level of integration" with thermodynamic achievement because it is easier to measure. The essay is admittedly an advocation of "the grand-movement perspective" (1960: 44) and as such is professional criticism in the White tradition. One of the broadest of recent anthropological schemes of cultural evolution and certainly the one which pays the most attention to pro- blems of explanation is Elman Service's (1962: 5) study of primitive social organization. His three progressive stages - bands, tribes and chiefdoms - represent "general evolution" in their "perspective", but "movement from one stage to another ... is viewed in terms of specific advance". In other words these three stages as descriptive categories are "general", but when it comes to explaining beginnings and transitions, "specific" evolution is required. However, it is difficult to make the explanations any more specific than the categories themselves. Patri- local bands, for example, "occupy extremely variable kinds of habitats", but in general they are composed of hunters and gatherers with fewer controls over nature than peoples at higher levels of culture. Thus the demographic character of the population is such that reciprocal band exogamy with virilocal residence provides an effective adaptation "to the superorganic environment rather than to food-getting alone"; it provides grater survival value in "offense-defense situations" (Service</page><page sequence="12">Eplanation and Reconstruction in Cultural Evolution 31 1962: 72, 75). This competitive "superorganic" struggle for existence among groups is also used to explain tribes and chiefdoms (1962: 112, 147). Such general pronouncements of survival value are not very "specific". Combining goal intention with natural selection, Service (1962: 43 - 46) makes a useful distinction between short-term and long-term re- sults. The former gratify individual self-interests and the latter have adaptive advantage. Short-term results are most likely to have selective advantage if they have long-term results. While he does not work this theory out in detail, he illustrates it with the origins of band exogamy and the prohibition of incest. Reciprocal giving of females satisfies short-term desires while providing long-term adaptive advantage through band alliances. Anticipating the loss of their females through exchange leads the male members of the band to reduce the pain of future separation by denying themselves sexual use of the commodity to be exported. Such explanations live up to Service's (1962: 10) promise to provide conjecture, but conjecture of this kind is again extremely general. In attempting to delineate major dominance levels for his first two sequential classes, Service is concerned with many cases that do not fit his types. These he categorizes as "composite bands" and "composite tribes" and claims contamination for these cases through contact with civilization. He admits that disqualifying exceptions on these grounds requires many more "ethnohistorical studies" to supplement his own "preliminary" work, which was concentrated mainly at the band level (Service 1962: 182). Since the "general dominance" value of his sequen- tial classes depends on the accuracy and completeness of the ethno- historical analyses of all the many exceptions, it clearly rests on histo- riography of the most "specific" kind. Morton Fried's (1960: 719 - 720, 725, 729) essay on the evolution of the state employs four sequential classes: the egalitarian society, the rank society, the stratified society, and the state. In explaining the processes of transition from one level to another, Fried specifically excludes "psychological explanations", e. g., a "universal human drive for power". His explanatory framework depends mainly upon adaptive survival value. But the survival value of more complex forms of social organization is strictly a long term phenomenon that does not depend upon "rational cognition ... by the culture carriers". It may have "the effect of diversifying subsistence . . . and . . . providing insurance against food failures", or it may "have considerable value in the maintenance of systems of defense, given the presence of extensive warfare". In the case of the state, the pristine form emerged under particular ecological</page><page sequence="13">32 Charles J. Erasmus circumstances "demanding irrigation or flood control", and the secon- dary form "is pushed by one means or another toward a higher form of organization by an external power which has already been raised to statehood". In other words the majority of states form as an adaptive measure of social self-defense. When it comes to stipulating situational factors in his explanation, Fried remains as imprecise as Service. In the recent book-length expansion of his earlier paper, Fried (1967) has not significantly altered nor expanded his explanatory framework. The book adds more descriptive content on the sequential classes and devotes considerable attention to professional criticism in their defense. But compared with the earlier and briefer statement, concern with ex- planation loses ground relative to descriptive elaboration. Progress in Adaptation A recent study of progress by sociologist Gerhard Lenski (1966) con- trasts sharply with the work done by anthropologists. Primarily inter- ested in social stratification, Lenski is very much concerned with the psychological needs and goal intentions that motivate his human actors. Although he employs sequential classes - hunters and gatherers, horti- culturists, agrarian societies, and industrial societies - his purpose is not to establish and describe levels of dominance. His categories are simply to help him find "systematic covariation" between technological development and the distribution of power and privilege. His chief interest is in the present, not the past. Earlier levels provide the histo- rical background to dramatize his ideas on problems of social esteem, political influence and the distribution of wealth. Whereas Service and Fried focus predominantly on their earliest levels and have less to say as they approach the modern state, Lenski devotes six times as much space to industrial society as to hunters and gatherers. Throughout his book Lenski is very much concerned with social stratification, mobility and distributive justice. The social criticism implicit in his work develops much more fully the themes hinted at by Childe and White, themes almost totally ignored by Service, Fried and Sahlins. The latter are much more concerned with reconstructing such relationships as bifurcate-merging kinship terminology and the patrilocal band (Service 1962: 76), "law" and the rank society (Fried 1967: 144) or kinship systems at different levels of stratification in aboriginal Polynesia (Sahlins 1958: 139 - 246). Occupational diversifica- tion and the decentralization of authority, property ownership and power, and industrialization and equality of income distribution are the kinds of relationships that interest Lenski (1966: 308, 313, 336).

Given the reconstructive emphasis of anthropological interests in cultural development, it is easy to understand why anthropologists shy away from goal intention in their explanations. Even in adaptive stu- dies, as we have seen, only those writers drawing inferences from their own field observations are inclined to use them. Unless one has perso- nally collected verbal expressions of attitudes, expectations and inten- tions, it may seem less fruitful to invent them than to look for relevant situational factors. This is a tendency that is likely to be even more true of studies of progress which concentrate on the distant past. Only when one is dealing primarily with the viable and testable present is it easier and perhaps more justifiable to project reductionistic explana- tions back into prehistory for heuristic purposes. It is now easier to understand why anthropological studies of pro- gress tend to be descriptive and anti-reductionistic. Their reconstructive emphasis leads them away from those very recent periods of human history when goal intention and social planning have become extremely important. Today, ideas of progress are leading governments to direct vast experiments in social change. Organizing seven hundred million Chinese into collective farms or instituting land reforms among the rural populations of Latin American countries are kinds of change that had no equal in the neolithic and paleolithic. The idea of progress is only about three hundred years old (Bury 1932: 109), but today it has become a significant part of the adaptive process. It is this dynamic and explanatory quality of progress which is so lacking in the evolu- tionary studies of contemporary anthropologists. And without it studies of "general" evolution are likely to remain primarily descriptive recon- structions. Such widespread neolithic customs as exchange labor and corporate land tenure can be thought of simply as "adaptive systems". But farm collectives and land redistribution programs are the results of delibe- rate social planning; they are "prescriptive systems". But prescriptive systems never work out exactly as intended. They invariably accomo- date to various unforeseen circumstances, and in the process of such accomodation they become what might be called "adaptive prescriptive systems". In China the extreme form of collectivization attempted between 1958 and 1959 could not be maintained even by force. The scolding and beating of peasants by cadres or the practice of denying them food as 3 Sociologus 19, 1</page><page sequence="15">34 Charles J. Erasmus a means of punishment only provoked retaliation. Peasants engaged in work slow-downs, harvest riots, slaughter of livestock, attacks on ca- dres, strikes, and armed revolts (Cheng 1961: 5; Jan 1966: 458 - 459, 466 - 468). Since 1960, work units have been reduced in size and the practice of assigning family garden plots has been reestablished (Walker 1965: 16). In Mexico, where farm collectives were always in the minority among land reform ejidos, members of collectives were prone to compare their situation unfavorably with that of the private sector. Those collec- tives that have not been abandoned have been drastically modified. Even division of farm land into small parcels with redistribution to thousands of land reform beneficiaries has had unanticipated conse- quences. Reconsolidation of holdings under more expert farm manage- ment has occurred by both legal and extra-legal means (Erasmus 1967). In the study of adaptive prescriptive systems the intentions of plan- ners and their subjects are open to direct investigation and appraisal. The effects of progressive ideologies become the subject of a new order of evolutionary study peculiar to the post-industrial phase of the "new evolution". It seems very questionable to me, however, whether anthro- pology is destined to play any significant role in this kind of develop- ment study. What we normally think of as interdisciplinary boundaries may also be regarded as cost barriers in terms of learning time. Each specialty develops its own body of data and the techniques of study most appro- priate to that data. The data of American anthropology has been largely the sociocultural behavior of preliterate peoples as evidenced directly by contemporary primitives and peasants or as reconstructed from cultural artifacts and historical documents. However, primitive peoples have all but disappeared, and peasants are rapidly transforming into proletariats everywhere. Moreover the anthropologist never de- veloped any special techniques for the study of living peoples. Each generation of anthropologists has gone off to the field with the same sink-or-swim attitude as the previous generation. To a large degree this procedure was compatable with the highly descriptive purpose of field work - to record how a typical community among a given people or in a given area spent a typical year. Major field problems often included mastery of an unrecorded, non-Indo-European language and coping with an unfamiliar or difficult environment. Today the pro- blems of field work are becoming very much what sociologists in parti- cular have long been used to and for which they have already developed a considerable cost barrier of research techniques and research pro- blems. Performing as a cross-national sociologist, political scientist, or economist, the anthropologist is now at a competitive disadvantage.</page><page sequence="16">Eplanation and Reconstruction in Cultural Evolution 35 The outlook for anthropology is quite different, however, in the direction of ethnohistory, and my definition of ethnohistory is much broader than most. By ethnohistory I mean simply the study of preli- terate peoples via both prehistory and ethnography. But as I see it, ethnography is now largely an historical science which involves the comparative analysis of previously published ethnographic materials. The "ethnographic present" is a stylistic device sometimes deliberately employed to make ethnology seem more timely or less historical than it has now become. Priceless though they are, our ethnographies are simply historical documents. However, the area of ethnohistory as I have defined it has very definite academic cost barriers. Archaeologists in particular have deve- loped a complex set of techniques and methods that set them quite apart from other historians. Although the techniques for evaluating and com- paring ethnographies is still in its infancy, the mastery of source ma- terials which such studies entail require a considerable investment of time. Even traditional historians are not likely to engage in either of these two branches of ethnohistory without virtually becoming anthro- pologists themselves. As I see it, then, anthropology as ethnohistory has a secure future, for it has adapted to a special research niche in which it has no competitors. It has developed valid techniques for exploiting this niche which provide a secure academic cost barrier. The ethnohistorical bias of anthropology has important implications for evolutionary forms of explanation. One recent writer (Meehan 1968: 31) has defined explanation "as an instrument that will tell us how or why an event occurs in the empirical world, thereby making it possible in principle to control that event". I like the qualification "in principle" which allows explanation to be something other than prediction. While an explanation may have control in view, it can be advanced long be- fore testing or confirmation have given it any predictive validity. But the explanations of historical reconstruction do not involve a concern with control. To explain, for example, why the ancient Maya abandoned their ceremonial centers, we must adequately reconstruct the cultural situation. We are really concerned with "what" rather than with "why". Our major problem is to improve an inadequate description, not to gain control over social actions. However, when we study adaptive prescrip- tive systems such as an agrarian reform our descriptive task is one of recording rather than reconstructing. In fact, contemporary data are usually so abundant that recording is selective. We collect what we need to answer questions usually oriented toward possibilities of self- correction. Control "in principle" is very much a part of the picture. And because it is, the relevance of opinions and goals is far more imme- diate than in reconstruction. 3*</page><page sequence="17">36 Charles J. Erasmus It is now easier to understand why anthropological studies of evolu- tion are more concerned with the description of progress rather than its evaluation and explanation. Descriptions of progress can provide sequential classes useful for coordinating archaeology and comparative ethnography in problems of reconstruction (see also Erasmus 1968). Adaptive studies, although far more explanatory in their intent, are equally divorced from problems of control. The Tapper-Trapper com- parison was one instance where the contemporaneity of part of the data led to something very close to a control type of explanation. It implied that any primitive groups falling into this type might be similarly exploited, and it thus provided a basis for avoidance of similar si- tuations in the future. But such information is of little help in a world where primitives are rapidly disappearing. For control-value, the type would have to be expanded to include other socially exploitative si- tuations. But with such expansion the value of the Mundurucú-Algon- kian data would become primarily literary and heuristic. At this point it is appropriate to ask what controls "in principle" are implied by my explanation of the drift of evolutionary studies in an- thropology. One control would be to change the profession. But for whom do we want to change it? Even were it possible, it would be foolish to alter the goals of established professionals performing impor- tant and satisfying research. This leaves the students. But I find it easier to persuade bright students to change to a discipline more in harmony with their interests than to adapt anthropology to theirs. Conclusions 1. Anthropological studies of cultural evolution or development may be divided into studies of adaptation and studies of progress. The for- mer tend to use more concrete models than the latter and tend to be more explanatory. Studies of progress tend to be descriptive. 2. Explanations in anthropological studies of cultural evolution rely heavily on situational factors viewed as enhancing group survival. Goal- intention explanations are seldom employed unless the writer is basing his model in part on behavior personally observed and not simply on documents and oral history. Studies which are highly "systemic" in their explanatory analyses achieve a high degree of internal consistency by employing limited and unreliable case material. 3. In its use of documents, ethnographic comparisons, and recording of oral history, the anthropological study of cultural development is predominantly reconstructive or ethnohistorical. It lacks the attitudinal data that facilitate goal-intention explanations. As a corollary of this situation anthropologists engaged in such studies defensively reject such</page><page sequence="18">Eplanation and Reconstruction in Cultural Evolution 37 explanations as reductionistic. For sociologists, who normally deal with attitudinal data and can afford to view historical reconstruction simply as a background for understanding modern problems, goal intention becomes an important explanatory factor and social criticism an im- portant research goal. Thus, the sociological study of development is likely to involve the kind of self-evaluation which makes "progress" an explanatory, cognitive component of cultural development. 4. The reconstructive or ethnohistorical flavor of most anthropological studies of cultural development is likely to continue. The research situation as altered by recent cultural developments has left the anthro- pologist at a competitive disadvantage compared with social sciences that are more problem - and method - conscious in their study of living populations. The academic cost barriers of the anthropological profession have developed mainly in the area of ethnohistory (defined here as prehistory and comparative ethnography), the area in which the future of the profession is most secure. 5. Ironically the study of the "new" evolution, or cultural develop- ment, seems more likely to progress outside of anthropology. Within anthropology it provides a means of integrating ethnography and ar- chaeology for historical reconstruction. Bibliography Bury, J.

Synopsis Erklärung und Rekonstruktion in kulturrevolutionistischen Forschungen Ethnologische Arbeiten zur kulturellen Evolution - bzw. besser: Entwick- lung - lassen sich in solche über „Anpassung" und solche über „Fortschritt" einteilen. Erstere sind konkreter und tendieren mehr zu Erklärungen, letztere mehr zu Beschreibungen. Die Erklärungen beziehen sich in erster Linie auf Situationsfaktoren, unter dem Blickwinkel einer Steigerung der Überlebens- chancen einer jew. Gruppe. Absichten bzw. Ziele von Menschen spielen dabei höchstens gelegentlich eine Rolle. Alle ethnologischen Studien über kulturelle Entwicklung sind vorwiegend rekonstruktiven bzw. ethnohistorischen Cha- rakters. Ein Rückgriff auf psychische Faktoren wird als „reduktionis tisch" abgelehnt, im Unterschied zu soziologischen Studien mit ähnlicher Zielset- zung, in denen „Fortschritt" als eine erklärende, kognitive Komponente kul- tureller Entwicklung verwendet wird. Die rezente globale kulturelle Ent- wicklung ändert die Forschungssituation immer mehr zuungunsten des re- konstruktiv-ethnohistorischen Ansatzes der Ethnologie. Gleichwohl dürfte er hier vorherrschend bleiben, allein wegen der hierauf abgestellten ethnologi- schen akademischen Ausbildung, die zeitlich und kostenmäßig keine Erweite- rung in Richtung der auf andere Probleme und Methoden ausgerichteten sozialwissenschaftlichen Ausbildung erlaubt. Auch dürfte die Zukunft der Ethnologie so am gesichertsten sein, da keine andere Wissenschaft sich der von ihr bearbeiteten Probleme annimmt.</page></plain_text>
