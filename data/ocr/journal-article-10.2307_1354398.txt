<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE COWBOY BUSINESSMAN AND "THE COURSE OF EMPIRE" OWEN WISTER'S THE VIRGINIAN Jane Kuenz In Paul Verhoven's 1987 film Robocop, the plot follows the growth to self-consciousness of the reluctant cyborg Murphy. A police officer all but killed in the line of duty, Murphy has been reengineered as a prototypical supercop and put to work making the world safe for big business. The film charts Murphy's growing resis- tance to this fate, a resistance not just to being turned into a machine increasingly incapable of distinguishing a past, genuine self from the one created for him by his managers, but to being turned into an interchangeable and unquestioning functionary in the corporate police state that dominates the world of the film's present. That the company sees Murphy's transformation to useful machine as a suc- cess is clear when his presumably more benign and discriminating talents-represented by his anthropomorphic shape-are juxtaposed with those of an earlier, more animal-like model that had gone berserk during its professional debut, killing, in rather dramatic fash- ion, one of the corporate yuppies we've watched worm his way to the top. Robocop is an ugly and off-putting movie, but as one in a cen- tury's long line of foreign directors who have abandoned their home countries for Hollywood, Verhoven proves in the course of the film that he knows his new domestic audience well: in a world of random and extreme violence, Murphy's heroic if incomplete claims to humanity and individualism-those qualities mitigating his complete appropriation into the corporate state-are represented visually in the film when he twirls the high-tech six-gun at his hip.

Though this "type" made his mature literary debut in Owen Wister's 1902 bestseller, The Virginian, his status as popular culture icon is more a function of his translation from Wister's novel into the twentieth- century formula western. The Virginian is not a genre or pulp novel.1 It is not a great novel, but Wister's tale of the Virginia cowboy in 1880s Wyoming is distinctly different from both the dime westerns that preceded it and the formula westerns that would soon follow in print and film.2 This includes not only Zane Grey's early Riders of the Purple Sage (published a scant decade later, yet already exhibiting most of the traits of the "classic" western, e.g., Shane), but also a dramatic version of The Virginian that appeared on stage only a year after the novel, yet already so different from it as to suggest that Wis- ter's story had clearly crossed over into the realm of popular fantasy. Perhaps more to the point, although it is consistently given credit for popularizing and cementing modern conceptions of the Ameri- can West and the cowboy hero who animates it, The Virginian has the distinction of not actually exemplifying many of those values it is supposed to be codifying for one of the twentieth century's most popular and persistent cultural forms. How and why this happens, that is, why some parts of a text become integral to subsequent pop- ular forms while others do not, has been one of the more fruitful questions organizing the study of what Adorno and Horkheimer call "the culture industry." Given the continuing influence of the western formula, it is interesting to note that what gets muted in Wister's story in the process of its transformation to mass culture form are precisely those things that make it such an accurate register of social contradictions at the end of the nineteenth century, of the efforts of men like Wister to negotiate them, and of the contradictions that might continue to trouble the cowboy's contemporary audience. The big shift from The Virginian to subsequent tales of life on the range is a shift in genre. The Virginian is, as Wister announces in the book's preface, a "colonial romance" (ix), a self-conscious political allegory about the state of the nation. The westerns that follow it are just that, "westerns": a formulaic collection of plots and characters in</page><page sequence="3">100 l JANE KUENZ which a heroic outsider, often an outlaw or gunfighter, traverses a symbolic landscape of cow towns and sagebrush, saying things like "It was a hard land, and it bred hard men to hard ways" (Louis L'Amour, quoted in Tompkins, 11). This outsider interacts with other "hard men" according to an unspecified yet universally understood code of male behavior that reaches its literary apotheosis in Heming- way and that regulates such things as when to talk, when to shoot, and when to say nothing at all.3 Though he is apparently hostile to encroachments from the East in the form of women, children, and a life in relation to houses rather than horses, events usually compel the western hero to aid and abet through his violence the very things that are slowly, but surely, signaling the end of "the west" as he knows it. Thus, we learn that, while you can't stop the progress of civilization, civilization itself needs to adopt western forms of action in order to ensure its success. Not all westerns are exactly the same, but their broad popular appeal is often credited to the freedom and cultural autonomy the hero seems to enjoy as a result of his apparent repudiation of forms of work dominant in the East and geared solely toward productivity and accumulation. These are both seen as antithetical to the cow- boy's spare life on the range and in the saddle. This West appears to serve as a kind of national safety valve, a place Frederic Remington found not yet "cluttered up with office buildings" (quoted in G. White, 59), where people go to avoid the alienating and exploitative working conditions shaping up back East as a result of the broad-scale eco- nomic changes that transformed this country in the second half of the nineteenth century: rapid industrialization and urbanization exacer- bated by large numbers of immigrants and the northern migration of African Americans, the development of new technologies, and the concentration of capital in ever fewer hands.4 Though it gestures in the same general direction, The Virginian tells quite a different tale. In Wister's story, the unnamed cowboy, known variously as "the Virginian," "the southerner," and "the giant," charts a steady course up the ladder of what Theodore Roosevelt called the nation's "primitive industry," cattle ranching, and into the heart of Molly Wood, the schoolteacher from back East, "that little Vermont person" as Henry James termed her, and, in the formula western, the person who embodies the culture and other edifying</page><page sequence="4">THE COWBOY BUSINESSMAN AND "THE COURSE OF EMPIRE" I 101 virtues of true womanhood that are progressively changing the West into something rather more like the world it tried to leave behind. Rather than looming on the horizon in silence, the Virginian spends much of the novel horseback riding and talking with Molly, playing cards, reading and discussing Shakespeare and other soon-to-be canonical figures, debating whether or not Elizabeth I would have made a good poker player, and generally cutting up with his cowboy friends and the Eastern narrator he learns to accept. His big shoot- out scene with the book's villain, Trampas, is barely discussed and is actually overshadowed by their earlier lying match, which the narra- tor spends three chapters describing. Although much of the book concentrates on depicting forms of play, we are told the Virginian takes his work seriously, has been saving money where he can, and has already bought a piece of land rich in coal and near where the railroad will eventually pass. The only real work we see him do, how- ever, is to ride a train home after taking cattle to market and to lynch his best friend, Steve, in the service of his employer, Judge Henry, who promptly makes him a partner and, in so doing, secures the Vir- ginian's future as "an important man, with a strong grip on many various enterprises" (316). Probably the biggest difference between Wister's novel and the formula western it spawned is its attempts to justify an antidemo- cratic vision of the nation governed by those few whose natural superiority is a function of breeding and inheritance. In the formula western, the hero is independent and self-sufficient, a natural leader in spite of his solitary existence, and generally successful at what he attempts in part because his talents are able to develop in a place as yet untainted by the preconceived notions about class, status, and merit that have corrupted life in the East. In juxtaposing the Virgin- ian's accomplishments with the failures of other cowboys, however, Wister suggests not just that success is the result of native skill and acumen, but that one is either born with these gifts or not and that no amount of effort can ever make up for the lack of them. For example, one of the cowboys on Judge Henry's ranch fails not because he lacks the will or effort to succeed, but because a series of mistakes proves he is just not good enough and never will be. "There was," says our tenderfoot narrator, "not a line of badness in [Shorty's] face; yet also there was not a line of strength; no promise in eye, or nose, or chin;</page><page sequence="5">102 | JANE KUENZ the whole thing melted to a stubby featureless mediocrity. It was a countenance like thousands" (169). The Virginian himself certainly succeeds-he rises from cowboy to ranch owner-but his success is credited not just to hard work and careful planning, but to the fact that other people recognize and understand that he is a superior person. The source of this superiority is discussed at length in Wister's essay "The Course of Empire," in which he claims that medieval knights and modern cowboys are "nothing but the same Saxon [in] different environments" (39). Wister later published this essay in an 1895 Harper's Monthly as "The Evolution of the Cow-Puncher," where the substitution of "Cow-Puncher" for "Empire" in the title suggests a link between the cowboy's adventures in the West and the imperi- alist adventures represented in the essay as an English lord's spirited call of the wild in Australia, Canada, and India. Moreover, contrary to the "evolution" of its title, "The Evolution of the Cow-Puncher" endorses no such thing: put him up on his horse, and the Anglo- Saxon's "modern guise [would fall] away and [show] once again the medieval man. It was no new type, no product of the frontier, but just the original kernel of the nut with the shell broken" (43). Rather than a "hard man" "bred to hard ways" by the "hard land" he lives in, Wister's cowboy is, quite explicitly, a pure racial type, the hardy Anglo-Saxon whose superiority reasserts itself periodically through- out history, essentially unchanged. This modern Saxon cowboy is positioned in Wister's essay against the twin terrors of moderniza- tion, both images of dangerous or degrading mixtures either of races-the "mongrel hordes" turning our "citizenship to a hybrid farce"-clearly a reference to immigration and northern migration- or a mix of classes-a nation "degraded" by being, as he says, "half pawn shop" and "half broker" (37). The Virginian is thus seen in con- tradistinction to other lesser men by virtue of racial purity and class identity understood as a function of race. He is as different from the lesser Shorty as he is from the "alien vermin" of New York. The novel develops these themes by staging a series of debates between the Virginian and Molly comparing the relative merits of what Wister calls "quality" and "equality." These debates come down definitively on the side of a "true aristocracy" composed of "quality" folks like Molly and the Virginian and dedicated to the</page><page sequence="6">THE COWBOY BUSINESSMAN AND "THE COURSE OF EMPIRE" 103 belief that democracy should concern itself less with making sure everyone is equal than with creating conditions that guarantee supe- rior people will always rise, as the Anglo-Saxon inevitably will, to their appointed place. "True democracy and true aristocracy are one and the same thing," says the narrator (91). The novel's romantic plot line is designed specifically to bring Molly around to the conclusion that her Eastern ideas about "equality," including women's equality, are ill considered and inadequate for life in both the new country and the new century. Rather than produce the "consensus" that ends the classic formula western, The Virginian instead suggests that all the things Molly is supposed to bring to the West are either not worth keeping or have already been improved upon by him: in the course of their courtship he proves himself to be more gracious and well- mannered, a better writer, even a better literary critic-George Eliot talks too much, he says, and Browning's a "smarty." Worse, Brown- ing is someone with whom Molly only imagines an affinity because her "good Revolutionary blood" has been watered down by the "pale decadence of New England" (87, 218-19). Her "pale New England decadence" suggests Molly's role in the novel may have less to do with reconciling East and West than with reuniting North and South. In fact, if there is any national psycho- drama being played out in The Virginian, it is the one in which the sentimental but sturdy New England girl learns to put aside her silly qualms about "equality" in order to make up with her stubborn but principled Southern boyfriend after the Civil War and in a place curiously empty of the very people whose interests might be said to have been intimately involved in their courtship. The Virginian thus participates in a larger national project of reunification and reconcil- iation after the Civil War that in many ways forged "unity" by gloss- ing over continued tensions or by simply ignoring anyone who might complicate that picture.5 Although Wister describes a Wyoming train station as a kind of cultural crossroads with Native Americans hawk- ing "painted bows and arrows and shiny horns," "cheap foreigners" (Chinese and Italian) building the railroads, cowboys returning from the market, and tourists arriving from the East (113-15), one would not know from reading The Virginian that at any one time between 25 and 35 percent of cowboys were black men who had migrated from the South before or after emancipation.6</page><page sequence="7">104 | JANE KUENZ The media construction of Theodore Roosevelt's Rough Riders is a similar case in point. Although Native Americans were prominent among its ranks, media reports of Roosevelt's volunteer troops as an all-white collection of Eastern swells and Western cowboys leading the charge up San Juan Hill presented a coordinated image of unity compounded by the press's compulsion to insist that all the cowboys were real gentlemen and all the Eastern swells were real men. More- over, the link between the cowboy on the range and the Englishman in Australia that Wister forged in "The Course of Empire" is precisely the connection made in media descriptions of the Rough Riders in Cuba. Of course, Theodore Roosevelt did not charge San Juan Hill; instead, he and his men participated in the taking of nearby Kettle Hill where they also did not lead the charge but assisted two other regular cavalry units composed of career soldiers who took the brunt of the fire, suffered the greatest casualties, and who were, not inci- dentally, all black. These men, members of the Ninth and Tenth Cav- alries, were never pictured in the photos, paintings, and sketches that document the heroic efforts of Roosevelt and the Rough Riders; indeed, at least one New York paper quickly relegated them to the status of followers, men who were "inspired by the example of the Rough Riders" at the Hill rather than the ones who led them up it (quoted in G. White, 166). It is no secret that the West jointly concocted by people like Wis- ter, Roosevelt, and Remington is a cultural construction of the most obvious kind. Like Buffalo Bill Cody, Wister knew quite well that he was creating the cowboy and his milieu after the fact and in the realm of myth. My point is not that Wister or the press failed to accurately represent the West and the Rough Riders, but that the representation they made contributed to a broader construction of consensus and reconciliation in the years after the Civil War in which, as Eric Sund- quist puts it, the North and South "fed imitatively on each other's racist inclinations" (230) and which used the West as an essentially empty "playground" for that purpose.7 The irony of black troops bearing the white man's burden up San Juan Hill was not lost on the black press: while supporters of the Spanish American War empha- sized the role of the United States as a liberator of enslaved people (Gossett, 317), African-American editorialists read the U.S. campaign</page><page sequence="8">THE COWBOY BUSINESSMAN AND "THE COURSE OF EMPIRE" I 105 in Cuba as an attempt to squelch an Afro-Cuban uprising, to remove the black leaders who had assumed power after it, and to Jim Crow the country as soon as possible (Foner and Winchester, 143-81). As with the Rough Riders, Wister's vision of national reconcilia- tion similarly glosses over differences between Molly and the Virgin- ian in region and class by actually uniting them in an image of their common heritage at a moment prior to the Civil War and, more to the point, prior to the massive influx of immigrants at the end of the cen- tury whose presence encouraged a number of "real Americans" to begin announcing the length of their native-born ancestry. Moreover, by conceiving of his novel as a "colonial romance," Wister con- tributes to the vogue in historical romances popular in postrecon- struction and turn-of-the-century America that were also dedicated to identifying an authentic and heroic American past and one's roots in it.8 As it turns out, both Molly and the Virginian are equally well connected; in fact, their marriage at the end of the book is described by the narrator as less of a union of opposites than as a reunion of similar types, both chips off the Saxon block that built the country: she is the direct descendent of revolutionary hero Molly Stark, and he, after all, is the Virginian, not the Alabamian, a man whose rise to the top of the ranching world is shown to be one inevitable result of his direct if distant lineage to the nation's founding fathers whose spirit he shares. At the same time, this "recognition" of their common ancestry is also a recognition that the South's version of this ances- try's legacy in the present-in the person of the Virginian-is the more accurate and desirable one. As we are told at the novel's con- clusion, unlike the Civil War, here "it was she who renounced,... and he who had his way" (312).9 Molly's renunciation of her feminist and egalitarian ideals is pointed out in the novel at great length and with some relish. She has, after all, though Wister doesn't say so, probably come to Wyoming in the first place because it had widely advertised itself as the "equality state" and had included a suffrage clause in its proposed constitution in a joint attempt to attract more women and drum up attention for its campaign for statehood.10 What is less obvious in the book is the extent to which Molly and the Virginian's conversations, and indeed the novel's entire discourse about "quality," echo a broader cultural</page><page sequence="9">106 | JANE KUENZ discussion about masculinity, work, and race at the turn of the cen- tury. The attention to Shorty's uninspiring facial features and to the fact that he is a "featureless mediocrity" already hints at the dual and sometimes contradictory nature of this talk: Shorty has both bad features and no features at all. While the former description invokes a history of scientific racial classification as seen in works like Mor- ton's 1838 Crania Americana with its confidence that facial contours reveal character and aptitude, the focus on Shorty's "featureless- ness," the lack of distinguishing traits that gives him "a countenance like thousands," points to growing concerns about mass production in a modern industrial economy and the standardization of identity and culture many feared it would create and which life in the West was thought to avoid.1 Among middle-class white men in particular, the changes in the social and economic organization of the United States brought on by post-Civil War growth posed special challenges as traditional notions of masculine identity grounded in an ethic of individualism and self-production confronted an economy where that ethic no longer had a sure place. While the culture at large continued to sing the praises of the self-made man, he who was a product of his own free labor, the emerging corporate world was steadily making his success both less likely and irrelevant. In 1800, 80 percent of the men in the United States were farmers. By 1880, that percentage was reduced to 50 percent. Between that time and 1910, self-employment of any kind dropped to 37 percent as small-scale competitive capital- ism effectively disappeared as a viable option for many people. Rather than working for themselves, middle-class young men entered either low-level clerical and management jobs at which they had little chance of ever being promoted beyond the level of self- maintenance, or, like Wister, they entered professional fields for which they had little aptitude and less interest. In addition, a cycle of depressions from the mid-1870s until the end of the century and a flurry of labor strikes-thirty-seven thousand between 1881 and 1905 involving seven million workers-led to thousands of bankruptcies, several hundred utopian novels, and a growing sense of both the pre- cariousness of modern life and the expendability of the men working in it.'2 As Thorstein Veblen predicted in 1899, in the place of mean- ingful, self-defining work, a growing consumer culture encouraged</page><page sequence="10">THE COWBOY BUSINESSMAN AND "THE COURSE OF EMPIRE" | 107 middle-class men to join women in conspicuously consuming and displaying both goods and leisure as a means of establishing an iden- tity no longer available to them through work alone, even if it meant that that identity was essentially like everyone else's. In its attempt to cash in on this problem and counteract the ominous return in popu- larity of beards and mustaches, the Gillette Company pushed its new product by claiming the home razor is typical of the American spirit. It is used by capitalists, professional men, businessmen-by men of action all over the country-three million of them. Its use starts habits of energy-of initiative. And men who do for themselves are men who think for themselves. Be master of your own time. Buy a Gillette and use it. (Quoted in Kimmel, 123) That Gillette's prospective customers might be tempted by the prospect of starting "habits of energy" is one sign of the epidemic of "nervousness" among middle-class white men, and the correspond- ing culture-wide concern that, as Basil Ransom laments in The Bos- tonians (1886), "the masculine tone is passing out of the world." Though it may look to us like a sign of wholesale resistance to the kind of life people were increasingly expected to lead at the end of the century, this sudden attack of nerves among men and women- hysteria is the feminine form-was widely understood at the time to be a racial disease, the direct result of too much "civilization," a term used throughout the period to signify a complex of interchangeable national, cultural, and racial traits. As Gail Bederman has recently argued, civilization itself was seen as an evolutionary process of re- finement in which "Anglo-Saxons" could not stop themselves from creating things like the advanced industrial and corporate economy that would eventually harm them. One danger this refinement posed was spelled out in 1894 by James Weir in his Century essay, "The Methods of the Rioting Strikers as Evidence of Degeneration": "The rich become effeminate, weak, and immoral," he writes, "and the lower classes, taking advantage of this moral lassitude, and led on by their savage inclinations, undertake strikes, mobs, boycotts, and riots" (quoted in Kimmel, 105). The belief that the responsibilities and benefits of "civilization" cursed men to an ever more effete and languid existence, leading to</page><page sequence="11">108 I JANE KUENZ strikes and anarchy by working-class "savages," made late nineteenth- century America a high moment in the precious bodily fluids tradi- tion embodied almost entirely in the figure of Theodore Roosevelt standing in the woods with a gun. Roosevelt's campaign to revirilize men by promoting "strenuousness" in personal and national life, either through hunting trips in Wyoming or foreign intervention in Cuba, gave us, among other things, the "Muscular Christianity" movement with its beefy Jesus.l3 This newly masculine Jesus was promptly co-opted both by the Ku Klux Klan in its domestic war to protect our racial heritage and by Roosevelt's own admirers who believed his successful attempt to assert the superiority of "Anglo- Saxons" over "European decadence" in Cuba and the Philippines proved the future president was, as one biographer put it, "the Jesus Christ of our day." What the Klan apparently understood is that efforts like Roosevelt's to put manliness back into men took a histor- ically specific form since part of the "manliness" with which men like Jesus were being reinvested was really a version of whiteness that otherwise went by the name of "Anglo-Saxon."14 It did so in part so as not to be confused with the excessive and dangerous "masculin- ity" that was supposed to adhere to black men. Weir's characteriza- tion of all those striking laborers as "savages," moreover, suggests that this white "manliness" is being articulated at the same time as an attribute of class since the "men" under scrutiny were largely middle- and upper-class and the kind of "manliness" they lacked was really a form of class domination. Don't miss the clue that the strik- ing working class is really a kind of racial other; at about the same time, the preferred racist term for the Native American population shifts from "savages" to "lower orders" as the new cause for con- tempt becomes the Native American's purported reluctance to work (Trachtenberg, 34). That Weir's rhetoric echoes justifications made for the need for U.S. intervention in places like Cuba and the Philip- pines suggests again that working-class and nonwhite citizens and potential subjects are being constructed discursively in terms of each other. If the growing interest after the Civil War in distinguishing regional identities like the West can be seen as one form of resistance to the kind of standardization of culture and identity associated with modernization, then the irony is that this concern about encroaching</page><page sequence="12">THE COWBOY BUSINESSMAN AND "THE COURSE OF EMPIRE" | 109 sameness appears at the moment when greater numbers and kinds of people are either entering the United States for the first time or are moving to places like Northern urban centers where they might actually encounter each other. In other words, the fear that everyone was becoming more alike appears at the time we were actually becoming more different. Meanwhile, his time in the woods and among the ranks of the Rough Riders has made the Anglo-Saxon uniquely qualified to run other parts of the world and uniquely able to resist the emasculating effects of modern work in his own. Fully developed by virtue of his time in the West or on the imperial front, he is, says Roosevelt in The Rough Riders, "in no danger whatever either of suffering from the unhealthy suppression of personal will, or of finding his faculties of self-help numbed by becoming a cog in a gigantic and smooth-running machine" (quoted in G. White, 165). For Wister, these "faculties" are best exhibited in fraternities like the one he joined at Harvard and to which no real cowboy could ever gain access: the "rough and tumble, straight out of the eighteenth century" life he enjoyed at school, writes Wister, "knit sophomores, juniors, seniors, graduates, into a Harvard texture, closer than any modern mechanism or rotarian methods can compass. Its day belongs not to these wholesale times of mass production" (quoted in Westbrook, 320). Advocating imperialist adventures as an antidote to diminished manhood was an especially potent solution in America at a time when, as Frederick Jackson Turner announced in 1893, all "the fron- tier opportunities are gone." Turner argued not just that the frontier had closed, but that in its life it had been a kind of ongoing event organizing and linking different people and historical periods in the evolutionary development of our "composite nationality." Thus, rather than some strained quasi-oedipal relation with European culture and history-a belief popular throughout the nineteenth century-it is the frontier through which American identity has been constituted. Unfortunately, following the frontier has obliterated it and, in the process, forced a national identity crisis. Not just the frontier, but the "frontier opportunities" were gone, and as goes the frontier, so goes the possibility of writing off "failures in one area" by "taking up" in another. Short of a frontier or a Cuba, average guys had to make do with "the West," the recuperative possibilities of</page><page sequence="13">110 I JANE KUENZ which were widely advertised and confirmed by popular accounts like Roosevelt's 1891 Ranch Life and the Hunting Trail. Thus, with Roosevelt in the background preaching the benefits of a "strenuous life," what used to be known as "the frontier" makes a new appear- ance on the national scene as simply "the outdoors," while cattle ranches that had failed in the depressions of the 1880s reopen as themed health spas for nervous Eastern dudes on the mend.l5 Wister, of course, was one such nervous dude when in 1885, at the age of twenty-five and in the company of several maiden ladies- friends of his mother's-he made the first of what would be fifteen trips to the West on the advice of his physician, the now infamous Dr. S. Wier Mitchell, whose "rest cure" was memorialized in Charlotte Perkins Gilman's "The Yellow Wallpaper." Like the treatment pre- scribed in that story, Mitchell's diagnosis of and prescription for Wis- ter's neuralgia was highly gendered. In response to the young man's inability to finish law school and his obvious reluctance to begin the banking job planned for him by his Philadelphia family-Wister wanted to study music'6-Mitchell advises not the confinement and inactivity his rest cure advocated for middle-class white women, but just the opposite: physical exertion untainted by manual labor and a little free time in big sky country. As the rest cure was intended to teach women the standards of middle-class feminine behavior-that is, to enjoy the confinement of the private sphere at the very moment they were being shoved definitively into it-so, too, is their time in the West supposed to reconcile young men like Wister to the gen- dered requirements of the modern businessman, in his case, to the loss of music and a life in banking.17 Turner didn't have to go so far, though apparently he still required the props: Kimmel reports that he kept a tent assembled in his back yard for those nights when he needed to get away (398 n. 19). It's easy to make light of some of this, but the kind of emptiness and terror these cultural and economic conditions actually posed for men at the end of the nineteenth cen- tury, and which led many of them west in flight from them, are more dramatically illustrated in places like Theodore Dreiser's Sister Carrie, where the "success" of the salesman Drouet appears to be a function of his clothes and where managers like Hurstwood are forced to con- front their own powerlessness in a world that appears, and in fact is, alien, indifferent, and violent.</page><page sequence="14">THE COWBOY BUSINESSMAN AND "THE COURSE OF EMPIRE" 111 "Alien, indifferent, and violent," of course, describes the classic western landscape, and it is in this parallel universe that Wister's cowboy emerges for the first time not as the bit player he was in the dime westerns, but as a full-fledged romantic and cultural hero-the figure of fully achieved manhood implicit in the broader cultural dis- courses about both labor unrest and alienating work conditions and explicit in the imperialist exploits of that strange mix of cowboys and frat boys that composed Roosevelt's Rough Riders. As the Rough Riders did for Roosevelt, Wister's construction of "the west" allowed for the articulation of a manly identity through participation in dis- tinct forms of industry and consumption, specifically cattle farming and tourism. He links, in the figure of the Virginian, the cowboy who has resisted the emasculating conditions of the East and the busi- nessman who succeeds because he is able to manipulate them. As part of its narrative of national reconciliation, The Virginian premises this second vision of "unity" on a similar denial or blurring of differ- ences, this time in class, and on its assertion that it is ranchers, not cowboys, who are the true heroes of the West. For example, the tempering of Molly's egalitarian ideals in proof of the Virginian's superior ones is more problematic in the context of the lynching of Steve that takes place at the center of the book. Horri- fied that her intended has participated in the vigilante execution of his former best friend, Molly debates the legitimacy of frontier jus- tice with Judge Henry who has been sent in to calm her. Claiming she sees no difference in "principle," Molly compares Steve's execution for cattle rustling to lynchings in the "semi-barbarous" South. The judge counters that the South lynches only people the law is going to punish anyway-which isn't true, of course-while "in Wyoming," he says, "the law has been letting our cattle-thieves go for two years" (273) in direct denial of the will of the people. Thus, when "ordinary people" lynch a cattle thief, Judge Henry reasons, they "only take back [the authority] they once gave" their leaders (273). Not only does this sophistry sound very much like the frequent assertion among lynching apologists that the mob was a semiofficial arm of local justice, but the condescension shown Molly in this instance by both Judge Henry and the narrator echoes a parallel attempt among lynching's sympathizers to paint antilynching arguments as the silly concerns of "sentimental" women. In his supposed expose, The</page><page sequence="15">112 | JANE KUENZ Truth about Lynching, in which we learn that all lynchings are justi- fied, Winfield H. Collins bemoans the likelihood that when the law finally gets some "crafty scoundrel" in jail, "he will be flooded with letters of consolation and sympathy" from women like Molly (59).18 Judge Henry's argument convinces Molly, however, who simply stares in silence at the logic of it all, as she did after hearing Brown- ing criticized, and eventually forgets all about her concerns in the joy of newly married bliss. Like the call for a more virile Jesus, this second "renunciation" again suggests an image of post-Civil War reconciliation premised on putting down the sentimental woman whose concerns for the equality, safety, and freedom of black people dominated much of nineteenth-century political rhetoric, especially women from New England like Harriet Beecher Stowe.19 Consistent with the contradic- tory characterization of Shorty's face and the culture's parallel con- struction of working-class and nonwhite citizens as versions of each other, the focus of Molly's sympathy elides African Americans and cowboys like Steve in opposition to Southern white mobs and West- ern ranchers like Judge Henry. "Cowboys like Steve" is the crucial phrase here. Rather than the Virginian who kills him and who is honored in the book's title, it is Steve who represents real cowboys in the novel, which is clear when class is foregrounded in the analysis of Judge Henry's exchange with Molly. "Cowboy," after all, is a job title, not a state of being, and the "freedom" that was associated with the cowboy's West depended fundamentally on not seeing the work the cowboy did or not seeing the cowboy as a worker at all. Although the Virginian insinuates to the unknowing Eastern narrator that cattle thieves prey on ranchers' stock because they refuse to work, it was just as likely they stole in order to get by during the seasonal unemployment they experienced under ranchers like Judge Henry who saw their men as a cheap and expendable labor force. Popular conception likes to wax poetic about the idyllic days with the boys in the bunkhouse-Wister compared them to his fraternity days at Harvard-but cowboys were preferred young and unmarried precisely because they were less expensive to maintain in group bunk housing. Hired to brand and castrate stock in the spring, graze them in the summer, and drive them to market in the fall, cowboys were let go in the winter and rehired the following</page><page sequence="16">THE COWBOY BUSINESSMAN AND "THE COURSE OF EMPIRE" J 113 spring.20 The novel shadows yet obscures this cycle by having its nar- rator conveniently return home to the East for annual visits during the winters of unemployment. Because barbed wire eventually made even branding unnecessary, its introduction led to large-scale firings and chronic full unemployment in the late 1880s and 1890s. As Baron Walter Von Richthofen forthrightly puts it in his appeal to European investors, Cattle-Raising on the Plains of North America (1885), these new fences will allow ranchers "to dispense with some of the herders" (83). Those fired "herders" fortunate enough to land a job with the Pinkerton Detective Agency might find themselves, as the Virginian does, pitted against their former friends (Almendinger, 5-8). Furthermore, parties did not always agree about what consti- tuted "rustling" at a moment in Western history when determining the ownership of land and the cattle on it was the subject of heated dispute and when law and traditions were rapidly changing in response to the consolidation of ranching as the industry Roosevelt predicted it would be. The most immediate unnamed backdrop for Wister's novel is the Johnson County War of 1892. This was a dispute between cattle barons represented by the Wyoming Stock Growers Association and smaller ranchers and homesteaders who began set- tling in the area in increasing numbers. It was exacerbated by the decision of the Stock Growers Association to pay hired guns from Texas to lynch any cattle rustlers they found. This included burning one man alive in his cabin. On the surface, the dispute was about cat- tle theft; in fact, it was about land ownership. Large ranchers who came in after the Homestead Act and swallowed up huge areas of land had for years grazed cattle on open prairies.21 Smaller home- steaders not only didn't care about protecting ranchers' claims to patches of ground they had always used but did not actually own, they also openly sympathized, as Judge Henry tells Molly, with the cowboys caught stealing cattle, often from their own employers. What the homesteaders perhaps understood is that these actions had only recently come to be considered a form of stealing. Wister's narrator observes that the word "rustler" was not in any dictionary, and current translations of it were inconsistent: it might be "applied in a complimentary way to people who were alive and pushing," or it could mean a cattle thief or just a horse. The narrator circumvents the obvious contradictions in this range of meanings by saying "the word</page><page sequence="17">114 | JANE KUENZ ran a sort of progress in the cattle country, gathering new meanings as it went" (163-64). What he means by this is that certain common practices and traditions, including those relating to cattle branding and ownership, were systematically redefined in the wake of the con- solidation of large ranches. Von Richthofen references this recent his- tory when he assures future investors that, though earlier law and convention allowed anyone who found unbranded calves and their mothers to claim them, this was no longer the case: now cowboys cannot "neglect their owners' herds in order to accumulate in this manner herds for themselves" because new rules punished the brand- ing of mavericks as theft.22 Instead, calves that were not or could not be claimed became the property not of individual cowboys, but of the Cattle Growers Association of the district in which they were found, and were sold to the highest bidder in order to help offset Association expenses (Von Richthofen, 33-34). Indeed, the Texas Panhandle Cat- tlemen's Association did just that when it responded to an 1883 strike for higher wages and better food (the cowboys wanted more vegetables) by simply changing what had been accepted practices: cowboys were no longer permitted to keep their own brand and run a few head of cattle and stock horses on their employer's ranch (Dary, 302-3; Porter, 512-13). Though he advises them to "buy a lot of land in a good spot" just in case (83), Von Richthofen waxes to his readers about the new harmony these changes have produced in the West: "In union lies strength, as was manifested in this case, since the resolutions adopted by the associations became state law through the influence of the members. As there is among stockmen no competi- tion,... there is no business jealousy, and all work hand in hand for their common interests and for the interest of each individual" (36). In other words, the "we" Judge Henry repeatedly invokes in his argument to Molly is not the "ordinary citizens" he claims they are, but the "we" of cattle barons like himself who have considerable interest in seeing the West won in their own way. "Ordinary citizens" were more likely the homesteaders trying to settle on the same land large ranchers had always used without ever bothering actually to claim. In fact, these people were letting cattle thieves off in court because they sympathized with the cowboys' plight and were battling the cattle barons themselves who, finally, were the chief dispensers and beneficiaries of vigilante justice, as Judge Henry's honorary title</page><page sequence="18">THE COWBOY BUSINESSMAN AND "THE COURSE OF EMPIRE" | 115 suggests. Molly's analogy to Southern lynching, then, is quite accu- rate: at the root of both is fear of economic competition and a will- ingness to use force in order to avoid it. Though he invokes their name and links their welfare to his own, Judge Henry actually dis- misses "ordinary citizens" as merely some faceless and ineffectual "law." This move is then symbolically blessed in the novel when the clergyman who greets the Virginian before his final shoot-out with Trampas reconciles himself to the necessity of violence by a similar logic: "He knew that Trampas was an evil in the country, and that the Virginian was a good. He knew that the cattle thieves-the rustlers- were gaining in numbers and audacity; that they led many weak young fellows to ruin; that they elected their men to office, and con- trolled juries; that they were a staring menace to Wyoming" (294). Shane, we should remember, sided with the homesteaders; the Virginian stays with the ranchers. Though he does this with some regret, smarting at Trampas's slur that he has "been running too much with aristocrats" (114) and grieving at the loss of Steve, the Vir- ginian nevertheless concurs with the judgment of his superiors: "I would do it all over again.... The whole thing just the same. [Steve] knowed the customs of the country, and he played the game. No call to blame me for the customs of the country. You leave other folks' cat- tle alone, or you take the consequences, and it was all known to Steve from the start" (258). Finally, it is the ranchers with whom the Virgin- ian identifies and to whose position he aspires, for, finally, much of the Virginian's success and fame is due to an ability, perhaps learned from Judge Henry, to distinguish himself from and subsequently exercise control over potentially unruly cowboys like Shorty, Tram- pas, and Steve.23 Besides his already noted inadequacies, Shorty is shown to be wanting because of his confused alliance with Trampas, the book's villain, but is also its only clear labor agitator. At stake in the three-chapter lying contest between Trampas and the Virginian is the fate of Judge Henry's hired men over whom the Virginian has been recently appointed foreman. Though Trampas has convinced the men to strike out on their own and take their chances in the gold mines rather than return to Judge Henry's ranch, the Virginian's abil- ity to humiliate Trampas with his tall tale about profitable "frog ranching" in California with 40 percent profits-a parody of the exaggerated promotions made to naive Easterners eager for quick</page><page sequence="19">116 | JANE KUENZ and easy money-convinces the cowboys not to bolt, but to follow the Virginian back to Judge Henry's ranch and the less ambitious future they can look forward to there.24 Later, encouraged by Trampas to ask for a raise we are told he doesn't deserve and is consequently refused, Shorty leaves Judge Henry's employ and is subsequently, again seemingly as a consequence, found dead on the side of the trail (168). Shorty's mistake is the same one Steve makes, and it is the same mistake of those striking savages back East: all want to get "rich quick and be [big men] in the territory" (249). Steve, of course, doesn't survive the book either, since the Virginian refuses to "take the Judge's wages and give him the wink" (258), while the Virginian himself finishes the novel a really big man, someone who, says our narrator in an especially telling moment of gender anxiety-cum- bravado, is "able to give his wife all and more than she asked for or desired" (316). While the classic western typically ends with the hero's depar- ture from the town he has just saved, The Virginian instead docu- ments his incorporation into and eventual dominance over the social and economic body of Medicine Bow, Wyoming. His lynching of Steve, promotion to foreman, and marriage to Molly all cast the Vir- ginian as a rising entrepreneur, a man who "knows his business" (2), as we're told when he first appears in the novel, all of which raise sus- picions about the actual desirability of the cowboy's life and the world that the book seems otherwise to romanticize and praise. As Judge Henry's conversation with Molly makes clear, however, it becomes progressively easier in The Virginian to see cowboys as con- tented and unquestioning "boys" or simply not to see them at all, as Wister does not when, later, he compliments the cowboy in terms sufficiently generic and absurd to make clear his own class and cul- tural presumptions: the cowboy is, he writes, "the manly, simple, humorous, American type which I hold to be the best and bravest we possess and our hope in the future. They work hard, they play hard, and they don't go on strikes" (Owen Wister Out West, 246). In 1911, William Dean Howells tried to comfort Edith Wharton after the publication of her less than upbeat Ethan Frome by saying that "what the American public always wants is tragedy with a happy ending" (quoted in Hart, 208). This is, I think, precisely what</page><page sequence="20">THE COWBOY BUSINESSMAN AND "THE COURSE OF EMPIRE" | 117 works like The Virginian and Robocop offer. Though Wister calls it a "playground for young men" (41) and though his novel ends with the quintessential happy ending, The Virginian's version of the West is not an alternative to, but a mirror image of the world of capital expansion and land grabs, labor wars, fluctuating markets, and big business it was invented in part to escape. Wister's letters and diaries repeatedly register his ambivalence about this fact: "Every man, woman, and cowboy I see comes from the East," he writes, "thank goodness" (Vorpahl, 29). He notes that polo and croquet have become popular pastimes among a certain set in Wyoming, that it is possible to visit and "find people who know all about New Bedford and Milton and to see a photograph of the Honorable Pierpont Morgan in a rack on the wall" (quoted in Gressley, West, 28-29). He laments "the exhaust- ing of the virgin pastures, the coming of the wire fence, and Mr. Armour of Chicago, who set the price of beef to suit himself" and chronicles the inevitable transformation of the country as it "[makes] room for Cheyennes and Chicagos, and ultimately inland New Yorks -everything reduced to the same prairie-like level or utilitarian civ- ilization. Branans and Beeches [families of Wyoming] will give way to Tweeds and Jay Goulds-and the ticker will replace the rifle" (Gressley, West, 38). Yet through all this he continues in the belief that the West will cure the rest of the nation of "that unparalleled com- pound of new hotels, electric lights, and invincible ignorance which has given us the Populist" (Vorpahl, 289). Perhaps his ambivalence is personal. Like other chroniclers of the West, Wister wrote about the growth of one of the area's industries, ranching, while actively contributing to the development of its other, tourism. Partly this was due to the success of his novel. Like Helen Hunt Jackson's Ramona, The Virginian helped create a market for more of the kind of class tourism he practiced and, indeed, despite its overt efforts to glorify the cowboy's individualism and the region's authenticity, the novel presents both as having already been packaged and appropriately themed for tourist consumption.25 Con- sider, for example, "Colonel Cyrus Jones' eating 'palace"' with its over- done menu of "improbable dishes ... salamis, canapes, supremes,- all perfectly spelt and absolutely transparent" (93) and Colonel Cyrus himself, not the original, who "met a Cheyenne telegraph pole</page><page sequence="21">118 I JANE KUENZ in seventy-four," but any one of a number of copies selected from unemployed cowboys, "fixed up like the Colonel used to be," and kept on display with the live bear that greets customers as they enter the restaurant (104). As already noted, Native Americans turn up on cue at the train station to sell trinkets and generally play themselves for gawking Easterners, but the same is true of the cowboys, includ- ing the Virginian, who appear frequently in scenes in which they per- form for an assembled, usually Eastern, audience that has come west specifically to see them do so. This is the case the first time the narra- tor sees the Virginian, also from a train window, as he succeeds in roping and breaking a pony no other man can. "We were six hours late," writes the narrator, "and starving for entertainment" (1). A similar scene occurs later as crowds gather around to hear the com- petitive bragging and tall tales of Trampas and the Virginian: As the stories begin, one man says "Oh, I must call my wife! ... This is what I came west for." "That's worth my trip" remarks another. Yet another man tells his wife that "this beats the geysers or anything we're likely to find in the Yellowstone," to which she responds, "Then I wish we had gone to Bar Harbor as usual" (123-24). Her answer makes clear, in case anyone still had doubts, that the West was already for many people a kind of theme park and alternative tourist destination for Easterners and that the cowboy was a type whose general outline and qualities they already knew and fully expected to see reproduced for them. It is worth noting that so many of these tourist moments take place around trains. The train figures prominently in The Virginian and its public importance will be underscored during World War I, but its role in providing the arena and opportunity for these tourist encounters will soon be taken over by the car. It was a common con- vention in early road maps of the West to outline paths taken by early pioneers so that motorists might theoretically encounter the same scenes settlers and scouts had passed (R. White, 54). In the 1920s, fed- eral regulation of trains hindered their competition with the automo- bile, which traveled on public roads and did not have to endure the delays and rate increases of the railroads. By the postwar era, in fact, the West led the nation in car ownership and road building, while the railroads-"which had seemed so powerful in 1900-were already in</page><page sequence="22">THE COWBOY BUSINESSMAN AND "THE COURSE OF EMPIRE" I 119 decline" (Malone and Etulain, 40-42). Perhaps this fact will temper somewhat the novel's otherwise glorious prediction for the Virgin- ian's future in Wyoming: that piece of land he owns with the railway running through it may not be so prosperous in the long run as the Virginian finds that despite his efforts to work within the rules of the industrial West, he can still end up, as Shorty and Steve did, on track to nowhere. This is not the ending most people want to read, but neither do they care for the one Wister wrote in which the Virginian is success- fully and willingly incorporated into hegemonic structures of every conceivable type. Rather than an elegy for a lost moment of "free- dom" on a frontier tied to a history of discovery and conquest, The Virginian takes this fate as given and goes on to narrate a lesson about modern life in postfrontier America that forces a happy ending out of the tragedy of its own failed hopes. If the cowboy genre begins in a crisis of identity for the country, especially for its white men, then this western represents a literary solution to the problems of author- ing a narrative for the twentieth century. Naturalism may scientifi- cally record the symptoms, but it is the western that has become one enduring form for their representation by creating a fantasy to explain the most troubling issues of the then recent past while also negotiating a possible future for the country that even the disenfran- chised might believe in, even though it is a future that leaves them out. While The Virginian provides Wister opportunities for represent- ing and acting on anxieties about his own identity in his transforma- tion from Eastern dandy to Western "man," it might also be seen as Wister's own version of Murphy's repeated, unthinking request in Robocop to "Lower your weapons!" Like the unsuspecting board members who have created Murphy only to see him return at the end to destroy them just as his earlier prototype had done, or like the Virginian who may discover too late that all his plans simply do not matter to a larger economic system, the reader must acknowledge Wister's world as their own creation-a world of technology out of control, of imperialism and profit. In its collective appropriation of the cowboy as a savior figure, the country attempts to right the wrong of an earlier version of itself by producing a second model that is, unfortunately, just as bad as the first.</page><page sequence="23">120 | JANE KUENZ Notes 1. Wister did not set out to write a book that would become one of mass culture's most profitable vehicles. His own literary ambitions were more local and patrician: an Anglophile pleased to be mistaken for an Englishman, especially by the English, Wister wrote The Virginian in part to present to Eastern readers the people and places he had observed during fifteen years of travels in the West and in part to secure the broader popular audience his editors at Harper's Monthly said he needed before they would publish the more serious historical work he wanted to write. As late as 1870, fewer than 3 percent of new books dealt with the West (Hart, 141); this had clearly changed by the time Wister began working on The Virginian. After being told he needed to cultivate a larger readership, specifically by depicting, in the words of his editor at Harper &amp; Brothers, "certain features of Western life which are now rapidly disappearing with the progress of civiliza- tion" (quoted in Payne, 138), Wister writes that his next "duty is to hunt material of adventure more voraciously" (Owen Wister Out West, 168). This "hunt" appar- ently paid off: The Virginian sold 100,000 copies in its first three months, 300,000 by 1903, and stayed on bestseller lists for all of 1902 and the first five months of 1903. There were thirty-four printings in its first edition, fourteen in the first eight months. In his 1930 biography, Wister gloats that the novel is still selling over thirty thousand copies a year (Roosevelt, 106). Over two million copies had been sold as of 1990. In addition, The Virginian has been the basis for three films and a television series in the 1960s and might reasonably be said to be at the root of all forms of the popular western that followed it in print, film, and radio and television broadcasts. John Cawelti's estimation of Wister's contribution to the development of the modern western as a popular genre is the general one: "Surely no twentieth-century American needs to have the Western's importance as a cultural form demonstrated to him.... The modern Western apparently began with Owen Wister's novel The Virginian" (quoted in Whipp, 250). Statistics cited in Whipp (250), Hart (207), and Cobb (24). 2. With their emphasis on action and incident over plot, the dime west- erns, like those in the Deadwood Dick series, were closer to their antebellum pre- cursors (such as Cooper's Leatherstocking tales, Robert Montgomery Bird's Nick of the Woods, and the Crockett Almanac), which were also popular for their "action rather than their fidelity to details of western life" (Baym, 117) and, in the case of the Crockett Almanac, for the humor and exaggerated tales that would reappear in the fiction of Mark Twain and Bret Hart. While it would be a mistake to see Wis- ter's cowboy as merely another manifestation of Natty Bumpo acting out a his- torical confrontation between old world and new on the frontier, Cawelti argues that Wister not only transformed the western genre, but gave back to it a thematic seriousness and complexity it had lost since Cooper: The Virginian "synthesized a number of important trends into the archetypal form of adventure" (215-17). For other accounts of the western's and the cowboy's continuing presence in Ameri- can culture, see Aquila's Wanted Dead or Alive and Savage's The Cowboy Hero.</page><page sequence="24">THE COWBOY BUSINESSMAN AND "THE COURSE OF EMPIRE" | 121 3. According to Whipp, Hemingway visited Wister in Shell, Wyoming, in 1928, in part to discuss A Farewell to Arms, which Hemingway was then writing. Three years later, Hemingway wired Wister when he first learned that Gary Cooper would star in Farewell as he had in The Virginian in 1929. Of Wister, Hemingway wrote, "He does, personally, seem to belong to the same generation as we do" (quoted in Whipp, 253). This is an intriguing comment about a man otherwise routinely grouped with an earlier generation of realists and local color writers, especially Howells and James, with whom he was friends. In 1905, for example, at Mark Twain's seventieth birthday dinner, Wister was seated at the head table with Howells, Mary E. Wilkins Freeman, George Ade, and Julian Hawthorne. This is not surprising since, despite his claim to be writing a romance, Wister's own writing on the West was routinely praised for its intense realism: though Roosevelt critiqued the violent early Harper's Monthly version of the "Balaam and Pedro" chapter as offensively realistic, Wister was awarded the Roosevelt Medal in 1929 for contributing to history. Similarly, the New York Her- ald Tribune praised him for recording "for all time the character and atmosphere" of the West in the last quarter of the nineteenth century. Criticizing Howells as someone who always kept "one timid eye on Mrs. Grundy," Wister self- consciously heightened the documentary quality of The Virginian by including profanity (though he marked it with dashes) alongside scenes of nude bathing, lynching, implied illicit sex, and animal abuse, while at the same time noting accurately the number of buildings in Medicine Bow (29) and writing down for the first time in print the lyrics of the cowboy song "Git Along Little Doggies." Echoing Howell's observation that a historian is "a kind of inferior realist" (31), Wister reasons in the preface that "any narrative which presents faithfully a day and a generation is of necessity historical; and this one presents Wyoming between 1874 and 1890" (ix). 4. This is the era that saw the creation of both the Department of Labor and a number of broad-scale labor unions, such as the Socialist Labor Party, the Knights of Labor, and the American Federation of Labor, that instituted new immigration laws designed to cut down on the influx of foreign labor and that produced the Haymarket riot and the Pullman strike led by Eugene Debs and opposed by President Cleveland with the help of federal troops (Hart, 158-59; Trachtenberg, 80; and Bederman, 244). 5. See Janet Gabler-Hover's discussion of this "reconciliation theme" as it was developed at Century magazine. 6. Durham and Jones estimate that there were five thousand black cowboys. Though this figure is disputed by Savage (Blacks in the West), Porter also claims that of the thirty-five thousand men who worked herds, 63 percent were white, 25 percent black, and 12 percent Mexican (495). According to him, most outfits for handling cattle had at least one black cowboy, and one outfit was all black (511-12). Although he claims that wage discrimination against black cowboys was not pronounced or evident, Porter also notes that African Americans were so good at breaking in horses that people thought there must be a natural affinity</page><page sequence="25">122 | JANE KUENZ between them (501). For more on the black West, see Katz's Black West and Rice's The Negro in Texas. 7. Henry Nash Smith's definition of the West as "the vacant continent beyond the frontier" (4) suggests that this image of the region as an empty space to be filled up, whether with office buildings or anything else, is a long-standing one. 8. Heightened by the Spanish American War and centennial celebrations, the demand for historical romances encompassed both the active reconstruction of Southern and slave history found in the new plantation fiction of people like Joel Chandler Harris as well as the idyllic portraits of Spanish ranches tended by pious Native American and Mexican people found in Helen Hunt Jackson's Ramona. As did the historical romance generally, both the Southern and Western versions sentimentalized a simpler time in American history while advancing an explicit political agenda (Hart, 202-3). 9. Noting also that Wister "loads the history of the Western story with political allegory," Whipp concludes that "The Virginian brings the culture, education, and literature from the Northeast, in the person of Molly Wood, and the strength, insight, and courage from the Southeast, in the person of the Virgin- ian, and joins them in marriage, leaving them to look forward to success in an industrial age" (250-51). What's worth noting here is not just the way the South has been redefined as the nation's source of "strength, insight, and courage," but also how Wister's formulation reverses the more typical antebel- lum and reconstruction gender paradigm in which a masculine, industrial North courts a genteel, if embattled, feminine South in a way that implicitly accepts racist representations of black men and the sentimentalizing of the Old South after the war. 10. Lee Clark Mitchell argues that "The Virginian offered a mute resolution to the crisis over women's suffrage developing at the turn of the century" (73). Western historians have traditionally argued that the willingness to extend the vote to women in western states should not be equated with particularly enlight- ened ideas about either women's roles in civic life or women's equality in general. Instead, women's vote was secured precisely so she could vote like a woman and thus spread her domestic and civilizing influence across the environs. More recently this interpretation has been challenged by critics arguing that women's suffrage groups were more active and vocal about their public lives outside the private sphere, that Western women's relation to true woman ideology is more conflicted and complex than that of their Eastern sisters, and that the notion of separate spheres may have little or no application in the West at all. See Jameson, "Women as Workers," and Myers, Westering Women. 11. Remington believed that the worst aspect of modern war, as represented in the Cuba engagement, was not the loss of life, but the loss of identity in a huge, impersonal, machine-made environment. 12. For statistics and discussions of the history of this period, see Beder- man, 12; Hofstadter, 218; Trachtenberg, 80-83; and Kimmel, 82.</page><page sequence="26">THE COWBOY BUSINESSMAN AND "THE COURSE OF EMPIRE" | 123 13. See Kimmel's discussion of the muscular Christianity movement in rela- tion to progressive politics and masculinity (175-81). For another history of American masculinity see Rotundo. 14. Roosevelt's own views on race are complex and sometimes contradic- tory. At some points he warns against the "race suicide" of middle-class whites and refuses to acknowledge collective political efforts on the part of African Americans. Elsewhere, he abhors mob action and condemns lynching, though often in terms that only confused issues even more: by holding blacks more responsible for policing criminals or by repeating the assumption that lynching resulted from assaults on white women. See Dyer's extended treatment of Roosevelt and race. 15. The first dude ranch opened in Dakota territory in 1881; more like it would appear in the next decade in Utah, Colorado, California, and Wyoming, Wister's favorite site (Malone and Etulain, 42). 16. Wister pursued music throughout his life: as a young man, his grand- mother, Fanny Kemble, sent him to Paris to study with her friend Franz Liszt; later he was asked to be librettist for an opera by Antonin Dvorak on Hiawatha; and in 1924, he wrote a satiric opera called Watch Your Thirst. Music even informs Wister's way of seeing the West; in one journal entry during an early visit to Wyoming, he compares the scenery to that of northern Spain and says a night- time scene recalls a moment in The Walkire (Vorpahl, 29). In fact, he passed time on the train ride west by finishing an opera about the legendary fatal meeting of Cortes and Montezuma, a theme that perhaps suggests his sensibilities and sympathies too neatly. 17. See Barbara Will's discussion of "The Nervous Origins of the American West" for a more extensive examination of Wister in relation to Mitchell's ideas about "the value of the West for nervous men" and the need to "[articulate] a new and urgent literary vision of masculine potency and conquest in the face of per- ceived cultural 'effeminacy"' (294). 18. Much of the effectiveness of Ida B. Wells's campaign against lynching may be a function of her successful manipulation of the rhetoric of race, gender, and culture that together constituted, though in obviously varying ways, much of the discourse about lynching in the United States. Rather than reproduce the sen- timental argument, for example, Gail Bederman argues that Wells "subversively manipulated dominant middle-class ideas about race, manhood, and civilization in order to force white Americans to address lynching" (46). She did this by changing her own tactics: initially inclined to hint broadly that the "truth" about lynching was that interracial relations between black men and white women were in fact consensual, Wells later chided white men for not being manly enough to stop lynching and used her public speeches and meetings in Great Britain to humiliate her countrymen into action under the banner of both gender and national pride. See Bederman's second chapter, "The White Man's Civilization on Trial: Ida B. Wells, Representations of Lynching, and Northern Middle-Class Manhood."</page><page sequence="27">124 | JANE KUENZ 19. In this, The Virginian is very much like future westerns whose complic- ity in the put-down of women and women's political concerns is general and long-lived. It is not by accident that Sam Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch opens with a violent shoot-out in the middle of a Temperance Union march. Similarly, on bestseller lists and in the national consciousness, The Virginian rivaled and even- tually displaced Charles Sheldon's 1896 In His Steps, a classic of social gospel fic- tion in which individuals, local communities, and entire nations are transformed by following the model of a feminine Jesus made famous by people like Harriet Beecher Stowe and against which the muscular Christianity movement actively defined itself. Likewise, the model of heroic individualism and action offered by The Virginian and endorsed by the western generally opposes much of nineteenth- century domestic, religious, and political culture. In His Steps did not go gently, however; it was one of the four most popular plays when The Virginian was staged along with Rip Van Winkle, Ten Nights in a Bar Room, and The Count of Monte Cristo (Cobb, 121 n. 11). See Tompkins for a discussion of the western's departure from the sentimental tradition. 20. Dary discusses the early disillusionment of cowboys, some of whom initially pursued jobs because they had romantic notions of what the work would entail. He estimates that only one-third of hired cowboys participated in more than one drive and that most left within days of being hired (276). One ranch employing 901 cowboys between 1885 and 1900 could retain only 3 percent of its workers for even five seasons, and 64 percent of workers stayed for only one. Observing that "why cowboys moved on is anyone's guess," Dary effectively sidesteps the point of his own research by romanticizing the cowboy again: he dismisses what appears to be a combination of job dissatisfaction and cyclical unemployment by characterizing the cowboy's movement as "wanderlust" (296). For other discussions of cowboy labor and work conditions, including histories of the cowboy, see Brown and Felton; Schlebecker; Ward; and Weston. 21. In Age of Reform, Richard Hofstadter argues that the Homestead Act and subsequent land speculation were a boon for speculators and capitalist forces that "translated cheap or free land into stimulus for ... discontent." They did this by driving immigrants to remote areas and creating "speculator's deserts" of absen- tee landlords who knew little and cared less about the local population and who didn't pay taxes (54-55). Hoping to convince foreign investors that it is safe to invest in a business "in which the owner sees his property only once or twice a year" (31), Von Richthofen is forthright about the future its author predicts for the region: "Great cattle corporations-with means sufficient for all the wants for the business and operated by men of great ability, who have studied this industry, and can manage the same in a business-like manner-are rapidly falling upon untaken lands fit for good ranges, and will soon change this Western cattle- raising into a monopoly, as are railroads now in the East" (99). 22. Though praised in Edward Everett Dale's introduction to Cattle Raising on the Plains of North America as the man who "helped to create the cattle boom of</page><page sequence="28">THE COWBOY BUSINESSMAN AND "THE COURSE OF EMPIRE" | 125 the eighties" (xiv), Von Richthofen was not alone in his attempts to interest Eng- lish and European investors in the U.S. beef industry. As he reports in his preface, his book follows a report prepared by a British Member of Parliament sent in 1880 to study ranching and report on its viability (xiv). England certainly had reasons to be interested: by 1881, 110 million pounds of refrigerated beef was exported to the island largely because it was less expensive than native beef (Dary, 262). Roo- sevelt also encouraged foreign interest by insisting that ranching methods "were all adaptations of European techniques and methods of organization" with "high standards of efficiency and utility being applied on a large scale" (Vorpahl, 277). Von Richthofen's own development plans included two-story "milk houses," with dairy cows installed on the first floor and tuberculosis patients on sleeping porches on the second (where they could spend their days resting and drinking milk), and a hotel, bathhouse, and casino in Denver (xi-xii). 23. In placing the Virginian with ranchers, Wister reaffirms his own experi- ence. Among the models for Judge Henry, besides other Harvard graduates, was Major Frank Wolcott, leader of the cattle barons in the Johnson County War, and Wister's host on one of his trips west (Westbrook, 323). 24. Gressley discusses the collapse of the cattle market in 1886 and subse- quent efforts by ranchers to attract Eastern money by predicting profits from 45 to 156 percent on investments in cattle (Bankers, 39-61). 25. Ramona produced its own spinoffs that were in turn designed to gener- ate even more interest in the area in which Jackson's novel takes place. Postcards of the countryside and of "Ramona" at her wedding were sent by the local Cham- ber of Commerce to real estate dealers back East with the hope of encouraging tourism and permanent relocations. In an early example of postmodern simula- tion, the novel's popularity is also credited with starting a vogue in the restora- tion of Spanish missions and mission architecture, in part so that visiting tourists would actually see the sites they had read about in the book.
