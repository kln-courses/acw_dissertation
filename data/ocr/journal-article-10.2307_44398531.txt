<plain_text><page sequence="1">SACRED ALTARS, SACRED STREETS: THE SCULPTURE OF PENITENTIAL CONFRATERNITIES IN EARLY MODERN SEVILLE Susan Verdi Webster Abstract Over the course of the Early Modern period, Spanish penitential confraternities commissioned large polychrome wood sculptures for their public processions during Holy Week. The special requirements of these processions led to the development of a unique sculptural genre. In the street, not only must the image "read" over a substantial distance and from multiple viewpoints, but it must also be highly charged with expression in order to elicit an emotional response from the audience. The sculpture must not simply represent: it must at once invoke, evoke, and provoke. This paper explores the twofold dynamic that occurred between patron and artist, and between image and audience, in order to determine how these works were created and how they functioned within the ritual context of the penitential pro-cession. Artistic contracts and contemporary chronicles document particular attention to the physical form and detail of the images and to their ability to move the viewer to devotion. The relationship between form and ritual context is thus significantly revealed. "...[S]culpture has existence, and painting has appearance" (Pacheco [1638] 1956:4s).1 For more than four centuries the sculptures of Spanish Holy Week processions have been the objects of tremendous popular devotion. Carried out of the sacred spaces of the Church amidst rows of hooded penitents, these images traverse the streets of cities and towns in lavish processions that profoundly affect and transform the experience of the spectator (fig. 1). While the public procession of sacred objects has enjoyed a long and varied tradition, the development of the Holy Week processional image in mid-sixteenth-century Spain represents a unique innovation in the history of Western sculpture, one that significantly extends the frontiers of the medium. This new type of sculpture was unprecedented not only because its patronage was confined exclusively to a single group, the penitential confraternities, but also because it was expressly commissioned and designed for its role as a processional image. As the foci of penitential processions, these sculpted images embodied rich and complex layers of meaning: from spiritual and secular to aesthetic and emotional.</page><page sequence="2">160 o ** o e Í: ^«T3 o e &lt;D Í: O ^ 00(5 « 45 S "&gt;á v em35 o ç vo ja c •- o c- titfi « 2 S . j- titfi « 2 S . sS ^ "° »« S •3 ^ &lt;« »« C ,2 S g ||S sjś sti« 2cS&gt;"o aP 8 o c S 2 *.3 •'n».

To an outsider's eye, this sculpted Jesus might appear to be little more than a mannequin, a work at best of folk, not high, art. While the head, hands, and feet of the image are rendered with great expressiveness and virtuosity, other parts of it are strangely unfinished and blocked-in. The figure bears disconcerting jagged holes and a protruding metal rod in one side of its chest, and the tubular forms of the arms reveal crudely fashioned mechanical articulations. Yet the artist who created this work around 1615, Juan Martínez Montañés, was dubbed "el Diós de la Madera" ["the god of wood"] by his contemporaries, and remains one of the most acclaimed and beloved sculptors in Spanish history (Hernández Díaz 1987:29). It is recounted that even the artist himself, upon seeing it in the streets of Seville, cried out that it was impossible that he could have created such an expressive and devout image (Palomino 1987:106). Indeed, contemporary accounts confirm that Jesús de la Pasión, among many other processional sculptures, evoked varied responses from its audience. Could this sculpture, or others like it, elicit profound praise and admiration, be considered the physical embodiment of spiritual perfection, and be an effigy of divine protection? Could it be the object of devout prayers and petitions, causing onlookers to fall to their knees amidst weeping and cries of sorrow? Could such an image serve as a model to be emulated by an entire community, and as an emblem of status for some? And could it inspire countless songs, poems and panegyrics over the course of more than three and a half centuries? The emotional responses of the sculptor Martínez Montañés, and of other viewers, illustrate the central point of processional sculpture, for it is the context that both transforms and completes the object. Only within the performance structure of the procession does the sculpted image become fully realized. A more complete understanding of such sculpture thus depends upon our seeing it within the context for which it was created: the yearly ritual of atonement known as the Holy Week or Easter procession. In this study, processions are considered ritual acts in which participants move through space in a symbolic manner (Grimes 1976:58). More specifically, the penitential processions of Holy Week can be defined as so many "cultural performances" (Geertz 1973:112-15) that simultaneously reflect and reinforce a distinct "world design" whose key element is intense emotion.^ The diverse images that will be discussed here achieve their full potential only within a ritual setting specifically structured to provoke and heighten the emotional response of the spectator. This study investigates the multivalent nature of these images, the art and science of creating them, and the ways in which they functioned within the context of the Holy Week processions. Each year penitential confraternities in towns all across Spain commemorate the passion of Christ in lavish public processions as they</page><page sequence="5">WEBSTER: SACRED ALTARS, SACRED STREETS 163 have for nearly five centuries. Though some regional differences have always existed, and certain changes and innovations have occurred over the years, their basic form and ideology remain fairly constant. The processions and images investigated in this study are drawn from the diocese and city of Seville. Their characteristics may only in a general way be seen as representative of such manifestations throughout the peninsula. Nevertheless, significant continuities between modern practice and sixteenth-century records suggest that we may better understand historical practice through contemporary observations. The Holy Week processions re-enact the Passion of Christ as a public ritual expiation of sins. The processions involve virtually all segments of the community; however, their organization and performance structure are solely the work of the local penitential confraternities. The confraternities are groups of laypeople of varied social rank and profession, unified in their devotion to a particular aspect or moment of the passion (Moreno 1985:23ff. 56). Especially the Early Modern period in these brotherhoods were generally autonomous organizations neither instituted nor directly controlled by church or state (Palomero Páramo 1987:31-2). Unlike the earlier devotional barrio-based confraternities, membership in penitential groups was generally city wide and vertically open (open to all social classes) (Sánchez Herrero 1988:73-5). The confraternities assumed all costs and responsibility for the processions. They commissioned and adorned their own sculpture as well as the platforms on which the images were carried. They also organized and enacted their respective processions along distinct, individual routes. The earliest recorded instances of formally organized processions during Holy Week in Spain are associated with the penitential confraternities of the Vera Cruz during the late fourteenth century (Sánchez Herrero 1988:52-3). Clad in like robes, these groups generally held flagellant processions on the eve of Maundy Thursday from their chapel of origin to a series of churches, wayside crosses, and hermitages, carrying a small crucifix (Sánchez Herrero 1988:54). By the mid-sixteenth century, burgeoning numbers of newer penitential groups organized in imitation of the Vera Cruz filled the streets of many Spanish cities with files of hooded penitents on Maundy Thursday and Good Friday (Sánchez Herrero 1988:52). In their processions, most brotherhoods carried one or more small sculptures, generally made from pasteboard and cloth, that represented their penitential advocation (Palomero Páramo 1987:64). During the latter half of the sixteenth century many penitential groups began to commission larger and more durable wooden sculptures from well-known local artists (Palomero Páramo 1987:65). Unlike other types of confraternities the penitential brotherhoods of the Early Modern period employed a highly distinctive and</page><page sequence="6">164 JOURNAL OF RITUAL STUDIES: 6(1) (WINTER 1992) evocative form of dress for their processions: long robes belted at the waist and peaked hoods with small eye-holes (Martin Macias 1986:28- 31). Individual confraternities were distinguished either by the colors of their garments or by the group insignia painted or embroidered on the chest area. Their penitential clothing clearly divested them of their worldly status and identity, rendering them all equal before God. These garments also served to set them apart from the audience, establishing a group or communal identity. The penitential procession may be seen as a rite of passage in which the participants, through their identical garments and acts of penance, separated themselves from the social order and entered the realm of the spiritual (Van Gennep 1960:174-5). Following Turner (1974:166ff.), the processions might thus be viewed as a liminal experience in which social conflicts and status were temporarily suspended or occluded. The processions thus fostered a sense of communitas within each group; however, as will be shown below, their effects on the community at large were not always as benignly transformative nor as socially stabilizing as Turner might have us believe. The penitential confraternities advocated a literal form of the imitatio Christi. In reenacting the way of the cross, some participated as flagellants and some carried heavy crosses, chains, or crowns of thorns, while others lit the way with torches or long candles. All but the aged and infirm marched in bare feet. The hooded robes of the penitents significantly contributed to the emotional charge of the procession. The masking of their faces and bodies removed all traces of individuality and social status, creating figures that were both enigmatic and psychologically disturbing. This effacement also freed them to adopt new and singularly penitential personae, exemplified in their acts of humility and self-mortification. Unlike the members of other types of confraternities, who simply displayed themselves and their images to the public, the penitential brotherhoods literally embodied the spirit of their images (Schneider 1986:139-40). While the donning of penitential garb did not make them physically resemble Christ, it stripped them of their individuality and clothed them solely in the penitential spirit of Christ. In striking contrast were the opulently adorned, extremely lifelike sculptures that the confraternities carried through the streets. Every aspect of these life-size, polychrome wood sculptures was calculated to heighten their animate appearance. They were given glass eyes and tears, wigs of real hair, moveable limbs, and extremely natural poly- chrome in flesh tones. Elaborate clothing and adornments completed their mimetic effect. One of the primary functions of these images was to engage and provoke the viewer. They may be among the most illusionistic sculptures ever made. The agony of the suffering Christ or the sorrow of the Virgin are brought vividly to life. Indeed, the</page><page sequence="7">WEBSTER: SACRED ALTARS, SACRED STREETS 165 sculpted images were the actual foci of the processions as they moved out of the chapels and, with a human gait, into the real space-time experience of the spectators. In the course of the procession a striking and dramatic paradox occurred between the figures of the penitents and their sculpted images. Through their hooded costumes and communal actions, the penitents were divested of their individualizing human characteristics. In contrast their accompanying sculptures translated the divine into a highly human, highly physical idiom. The penitents became theomorphic; they embodied the penitential spirit of Christ. Conversely, the sculpted images became fully anthropomorphic; they embodied the human aspect of the Passion. The procession was structured by an inversion of the normal order. It was a "transformance" (Schechner 1977:71) in which the interpénétration of earthly and spiritual spheres became immanent. For the audience, the dramatic tension created by this visual paradox or inversion must have evoked a profound psychological resonance. The sixteenth-century Rule Book of the Sevillian Confraternity of Jesús Nazareno y Santa Cruz en Jerusalén testifies to some of the ways in which these groups perceived the role of images in their processions. In the second chapter, the confraternity avows that, for the greater glory of God, they go out in procession on Good Friday accompanying an image which represents to us the steps to our health, bearing with all veneration a most Holy Christ carrying the Cross... and at the end of the procession we carry an image of Our Lady the Most Holy Virgin so that carrying Jesus Christ as captain before our eyes, and our backs protected by his divine mother, we will be free of the demon in this procession (Mateo Alemán 1578:7r-v).3 This statement reveals, among other things, three major ideas regarding the role of processional images: they serve as models for spiritual health, as objects of veneration and devotion, and as divine protectors from evil. By the seventeenth century most Sevillian confraternities possessed images of both the Virgin and Christ (Romero Mensaque 1986:117). Extant documents of commission between artists and confraternities offer abundant information regarding the construction of these sculptures. Primarily pragmatic in nature, the contracts specify such aspects as materials, size, iconography, physical detail, and mechanical devices. Qualities of economy, durability, stability, and weight figure as maxims among confraternity contracts, alongside other less easily quantifiable issues of physical perfection, expressiveness, devoutness, and beauty. For example, in 1601 a confraternity in the town of Lora</page><page sequence="8">166 JOURNAL OF RITUAL STUDIES: 6(1) (WINTER 1992) commissioned an image of the resurrected Christ from the sculptor Pedro de la Cueva, specifying that it be "...made from pine, the body hollow, of human size, with very strong and new bolts so that although it will be carried in procession, it will not fall" (López Martínez 1928:9-10). Issues of economy, stability, and versatility also figured in a contract of 1621 between a confraternity in the town of La Rambla and the sculptor Juan de Mesa for an image of Christ carrying the cross. The confraternity required that "...the body be made from pine, with the head, hands and feet made from cedar, with moveable arms...." It was to be equipped with bolts to attach the sculpture to its platform and to fasten the cross that the image carried to its body (Muro Orejón 1932:81- 82). Since this sculpture would later be dressed in a tunic, only the visible parts were to be made from the more durable, more expensive wood. Moveable arms facilitated both the dressing of the image and the affixing of the cross that it was to carry. During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, sculptures with articulated limbs were often commissioned specifically so that they could be transformed to perform a variety of roles within a narrative context. The moveable arms of the nazarenos, or images of Christ carrying the Cross, could be lowered and crossed in front of the image, transforming it into a cautivo, or captive, for use on different ritual occasions (Palomero Páramo 1987:65). Similarly articulated images of the Virgin allowed them a wider range of expressive gestures, depending on their ritual context. Another characteristic type of articulated sculpture was the image of Christ employed in the "descent" ceremony. Carried in procession to the front of the confraternity's chapel, the crucified Christ would then be taken down from the cross and placed in the lap of the Virgin. This poignant scene of the pietà remained for several hours until the Christ was removed, stretched out in a sepulchre or glass coffin, and solemnly processed again through the streets (Sánchez Gordillo 1982:164-7). Processional sculpture possesses a unique kinesthetic character that allows it dramatic entrance into the realm of human experience. It has the ability to move both physically (through its articulated limbs) and spatially (through the streets of the city). Furthermore, the incorporation of sculpture within a processional context acts to change one of its most fundamental aspects: its sense of time.^ No longer the static, eternal images of altars and retablos, their temporal state is extended so that they merge with the actual space-time experience of the spectators. The mimetic realism and extended temporality of such sculpture frequently provoked strong emotional responses from the audience. The Sevillian Abbot Sánchez Gordillo, writing of a descent ceremony he observed in the late sixteenth century, describes the profound effect that this ritual exerted over its audience:</page><page sequence="9">WEBSTER: SACRED ALTARS, SACRED STREETS 167 ...At the appointed hour, the people met to see the spectacle, the view of the scene from afar struck them with notable reverence and devotion and even from close up it was a very lifelike representation and produced a kind of fear and respect in those who saw it and they became very devout and were moved to sorrow... (Sánchez Gordillo 1982:164).^ Eyewitness accounts describing the affective qualities of processional sculpture also stress its power to provoke tears and cause onlookers to fall to their knees in prayer. The link between the verisimilitude of the images and their emotional impact is repeatedly demonstrated in such reports. For example, an early historian of Seville, Diego Ortiz de Zúñiga, describes an image carried in procession by a local confraternity in 1677, stating, "...They went out at the break of day on Good Friday, bearing the Lord carrying the Cross, represented so alive that it made the hair stand on end and inflamed even the most tepid and insensitive heart with devotion and piety" (Palomero Páramo 1987:62).^ Virtually all contracts request of sculptors that the image be "fashioned and finished in all perfection," and many ask that it be a very devout, humble, or sad image and one that "moves the viewer to devotion." These qualities are infrequently elaborated upon, but may be understood through the many demands for glass eyes and tears, hairpieces, and other highly mimetic elements. The subsequent clothing and adornment of the images undertaken by the confraternities also contributed significantly to their emotional impact and persuasiveness. Most processional sculptures, male and female alike, were attired in real garments. While the tradition of dressing sculpture has a long history, the processional images were intended from their very inception to be clothed. This particular destiny strongly influenced the form of the sculpture. For example, in 1629 a Sevillian confraternity commissioned an image of the Virgin from the sculptor Alonso Alvarez, specifying that it be made " ...to be dressed, the size of a human, with articulated arms, fleshtones painted in oils, with glass tears..." (Bago y Quintanilla 1932:69). The bodies of female images were often little more than rudimentarily formed torsos attached to a conical armature that served to support the garments in which they would later be dressed. Crafted to be clothed, their bodies could be made of lightweight, inexpensive materials, with only the head, hands, and occasionally the feet carved in detail, and any mechanical articulations could be concealed. A late seventeenth-century sculpture of the Magdalena (fig. 3) illustrates the typical manner in which these images were constructed. The mimetic effect of the Magdalena is further enhanced by bending one beam of the supporting armature outward to give the illusion of a protruding knee.</page><page sequence="10">168 JOURNAL OF RITUAL STUDIES: 6(1) (WINTER 1992) Figure 3.

Thus, the limbs of the sculpture Jesús de la Pasión (see fig. 1) are fully rendered, though only detailed where they would extend beyond the covering of a long tunic. The desire to reveal Christ's bare and often battered feet, as an aspect of his penitential role, dictated the form of the images of Christ. Subsidiary male figures, such as Simon of Cyrene or Nicodemus, while always depicted wearing shoes, were otherwise constructed in a similar fashion. Clothing these statues in real garments and adorning them with precious jewelery clearly heightened their persuasive qualities. Indeed, the affective power that such tactics could exert over an audience was widely recognized by contemporary authors. Writing in Seville in 1556, the extremely popular theologian Saint John of Avila succinctly stated the theory, "When they want to take out an image to make people weep, they dress it in mourning and decorate it with all manner of things that provoke sorrow..." (Avila [1556] 1963:264). Typically, sixteenth-century images of the Virgin were dressed in mourning clothes. Indeed, they were attired in the very same type of clothes worn by the viudas [widows] of the time. In the 1540's a processional Virgin in Madrid was said to have been attired in such garments, given to her by the Queen's head chambermaid in imitation of her own widow's clothes (Pellicer [1804] 1975:46). Yet over the course of the Baroque period a wealth of other adornments frequently was added to this somber attire. Most common were the jeweled sword hilts that pierced the breast of the Virgin, symbolic of her pain and sorrow. The tiaras, lace handkerchiefs, embroidered veils, ruffles and flounces, necklaces, and jeweled rosaries, among the many other elements that enlivened the forms of the images, were the treasured gifts of numerous confraternity members, (fig. 4). Through the making and commissioning of garments for their images the confraternities were able to personalize the sculptures to their liking. The titular sculptures of individual confraternities thus became the crystallized symbols of communal identity. Displayed in public processions, the sculptures projected the image of how each group wanted to be seen. During the Baroque period, most vestments were made of velvet, silk, and brocade. Many were opulently embroidered and adorned with pearls, ivory, or semi-precious stones (Martin Macias 1986:38). The splendour of the garments made a statement about the material, as well as the spiritual, wealth of the confraternity. The confraternity itself clearly did as much to create the image and affect audience perception of it as the sculptor who carved it. The process by which these sculptures were made into ritual objects was thus twofold: their initial production by the sculptor was followed by their performance as staged and costumed by the confraternity.</page><page sequence="13">WEBSTER: SACRED ALTARS, SACRED STREETS 171 Just as the embellishment of the sculptures grew increasingly opulent over the course of the Baroque period, there was a corresponding elaboration in the decoration of the platforms and in the number of subsidiary figures. Platforms with multiple figures, called pasos de misterio, were first developed in the late sixteenth century but gained great popularity over the course of the seventeenth century. These were dramatic tableaux that incorporated a number of interrelated characters placed within a convincing stage set and equipped with all the appropriate properties. A famous sixteenth-century Sevillian paso de misterio figures in one of the earliest such contracts known and provides a fascinating example of the forethought that went into the commissioning of such tableaux. In 1578 the Sevillian Confraternity of La Sagrada Oración en el Huerto y Nuestra Señora del Rosario commissioned the noted sculptor Geronimo Hernández to execute a complete scene of the agony in the garden for their procession on Maundy Thursday (see fig. 1). The scene was to include a Christ, an angel, and three sleeping apostles, ...with their different postures made very natural [they must have] their feet and hands uncovered and must be the stature of a man and very well devised as a group... [and] each figure must be executed completely in the round so that they can be installed and removed and be seen from all sides... [and their] bodies made of wooden armatures that are very strong and nailed... (López Martínez 1929:230-1)7 The artist was also required to make the garden landscape. In this contract, narrative accuracy, convincing naturalism, and clear visibility were paramount. The powerful visual impact of this paso can be gauged by the fact that soon thereafter other confraternities followed suit, commissioning even more complex and grandiose scenes of their own. Some of these included life-size wooden horses, a complete scene of the sentencing of Jesus, and the entire cast of the last supper, requiring legions of brothers to carry them through the streets. The materialistic and competitive spirit was certainly not absent from these groups who marched so penitently in expiation of their sins. In fact, the confraternities were periodically accused of spending excessive amounts in preparation for their processions. In 1592 the Vicar General of Seville, Licenciado Bernardino, condemned the great sums of money spent by the confraternities, avowing that "the brothers make it a case of honor to bring out more and better images and platforms, so that they have to pawn their belongings, and they spend excessive and exorbitant amounts... leaving many lost and destitute (Autos de reducción 1592).®</page><page sequence="14">172 JOURNAL OF RITUAL STUDIES: 6(1) (WINTER 1992) By the seventeenth century, more than twenty Sevillian penitential confraternities held their respective processions in the streets of the city (Sanchez Herrero 1 988:84 Ai), establishing their own ritual control of geographical space. While the very movement of the processions and their holy images through the streets functioned as a sanctification of that space, it may be understood simultaneously as a form of symbolic conquest. The procession becomes a literal "taking of place," in which the area occupied and delineated by a given confraternity becomes, for a time, symbolically theirs.^ Rivalry among penitential confraternities was, and still is, extremely strong. Confrontations among them were frequent. In 1592 Juan Garcia de Rivera, a resident of Seville, testified to a clash between two confraternities. Converging on the same street during the processions of Maundy Thursday, each group refused to cede the right of way to the other. Garcia recounts that there was a very great uproar and scandal, and there were many blows given with the staffs that they carried and with the whips of the flagellants, to such an extent that they toppled a crucified Christ carried by one of the confraternities and continued to fight on top of it... and there was a huge chaos and scandal which finally toppled the other images that they carried ("Autos de reducción" 1592).™ The possessive attitude towards processional space is reflected in the functional breakdown of the ritual in the face of a confrontation by a similar group. The repeated instances of public conflict between confraternities in the late sixteenth century suggest that the penitential processions also functioned as an arena for power and prestige negotiations in which each group sought to enhance and promote its social standing. That such disturbances were common occurrences during the late sixteenth and seventeenth centuries is evidenced in numerous denunciations of the penitential brotherhoods by both civic and religious authorities ("Autos de reducción"1592). These authorities made specific reference to the many "anomalous and anarchical situations," the "great inconveniences, brawls and scandals," and "the indecency with which they participate in penitential acts..." (Esquivias Franco 1980:13,19). One means by which religious authorities attempted to control the confraternities with their edicts of 1623 was to require all groups to pass through the cathedral during their penitential processions, thus orienting them to the symbolic center, where they could be "reviewed" by both ecclesiastical and civil authorities. Such authorities also tried to control and instill order among the confraternities by granting legal</page><page sequence="15">WEBSTER: SACRED ALTARS, SACRED STREETS 173 precedence in processional confrontations to the older of the brotherhoods (Esquivias Franco 1980:13). This last edict resulted in still more conflict and confusion, as many groups claimed greater antiquity in the face of confrontation, while others struggled to locate old manuscripts and rule books and ultimately emerged with falsified documents and hired testimonies. The ever-changing order of the processions documented during subsequent years testifies to the continued struggle of each group to regain its status and dominance within the city. The scandalous encounters between the confraternities reached such an extreme that in 1623 ecclesiastical authorities finally attempted to exert stringent control over them by reducing their numbers, forcing many groups to merge into a few larger organizations (Esquivias Franco 1980:1 7ff.). Significantly, the edict did not affect the corporate lives of the confraternities, for it allowed them to continue their individual activities in their respective chapels. The reduction laws only attempted to control the processions of Holy Week. Far from fostering a temporary ambience of peacefulness and stability or a sense of communitas, such frequent skirmishes in the course of penitential processions often had the opposite effect, creating deeper rifts and disruptions on other social levels. For the penitential brotherhoods, allegiances were evidently group-specific, not citywide. The reduction edict of 1623 ultimately failed in its effort to merge the confraternities. Many of these groups simply ignored the orders, and by 1626 the dutifully "reduced" confraternities had again established their processional independence. One of the major problems with the reduction involved the titular sculptures of the brotherhoods. Which images would be carried in procession? In what order? And where would they be kept (see Esquivias Franco 1980:18)? The sculpted images clearly represented the most important public symbols of group identity. Subsumed within a larger, more eclectic processional grouping, the sculptures could no longer play this integral role. The confraternities were clearly not immune to human passions. Issues of competition, status, and power played prominent roles in their processions. Alongside the transmission of spiritual and emotional sensations, the sculpted images also conveyed these more mundane messages to their audience. Clearly, the splendour of their adornment bespoke the material wealth of the confraternity, as did their superior workmanship. These sculptures were often commissioned from among the most important artists of the time. The brotherhoods contracted with the same sculptors who worked under the patronage of the archbishop, the religious orders, and the nobility to produce devotional images for permanent display in churches and chapels. Confraternity contracts often stipulated that the image must be done "by the hand of the master alone and by no other." The artistic quality of the sculptures</page><page sequence="16">174 JOURNAL OF RITUAL STUDIES: 6(1) (WINTER 1992) acted to enhance the status of the group within the community while simultaneously promoting their spiritual standing. The dual dimensions of spiritual and material power interpenetrate at the heart of these images. The highly personalized and continuing passion for these sculptures is well illustrated by a saeta (a sung poem) that would have been vocalized during the course of the procession. This saeta was written in admiration of the sixteenth-century titular image of a Sevillian penitential confraternity, the Virgin of the Macarena: The Virgin who is in heaven will not have a face of sorrow but she will surely have your face Virgin of the Macarena (Gutiérrez 1986:192)11 For the contemporary beholder these statues were no longer representations of generalized religious symbols but actual presentations of individual personae. A distinctively human identity was transmitted from the holy images through their ritual processions, to the hearts of the devout, then back to the originating entity, the Virgin or Christ. The potency of this type of sculpture lies not solely in its beauty as an aesthetic object, though many are marvellously rendered with particular features emphasized to evoke strong responses. Their richness and power are fully attained only through the ritual context in which they function. Worldly and divine, material and spiritual, these images combine both Christian and human passions, which are communicated to their audience. Their very multivalence is what has made them some of the most popular and enduring sculpture created in Spain. NOTES ^ln Spanish: "...[L]a escultura tiene el ser y la pintura el parecer."
