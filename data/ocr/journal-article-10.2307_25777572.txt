<plain_text><page sequence="1">SAMUEL SANDLER LESMIAN'S POETRY ANALYZED Rochelle Heller Stone, Bolestaw Lesmian: The Poet and His Poetry. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1976. Pp. xi, 364. Mrs. Stone has made an important effort designed at acquainting the English speaking reader with Boleslaw Lesmian's poetry and his conceptions of poetic language, expounded in his theoretical and critical pronouncements as well as derived from his poetic work. In the past quarter of a century Lesmian's work has come to be better known and studied than ever. Stone's book includes an extensive presentation of Lesmian's motifs, themes, and poetic imagery. She pays much attention to Lesmian's use of the single word. For Lesmian's poetic magic begins right there; his language already contains the magical core of poetry. No other Polish poet has worked more consistently on this assumption ? which brings him close to some basic concepts of Mallarme. The latter's famous proclamations that every word is a magical formula would be fully endorsed by LeSmian. Stone has presented a lucid survey of the main traits of Lesmian's use of words, of his already famous manner of transforming them, of recovering their original meaning and flavor, and by them, of achieving insuperable directness and concrete ness. The author has made a diligent attempt at translating Lesmian's poetry which is cited profusely in her study. She believes that even in a prose rendition "some of the magic of his creative process" (p. x) can pass through. She makes an honest attempt to preserve Lesmian's ideas and imagery, but at the price of sacrificing meter and rhyme. She agrees that meter and rhyme are of greatest import but "unfortunately, inimitable aspects of his poetics" (p. x). This reduces greatly the insight into "the magic" of Lesmian's "creative process" and into his poetic work for readers who do not know Polish. Stone is not to blame for the fact that Lesmian's poetry is extremely difficult to translate. Certainly she would not wish to judge his poetical capacity on this basis. He resists and sometimes makes impossible any attempt to be translated even literally. For example, in the poem "Matysek," there are two lines rather cleverly rendered into English by Stone: "Little Matthew played in the forest on a fir-wood fiddle ? / And he won, he won ? the tears of a dead maiden"/ (p. 235). The beginning of the second line goes in Polish: "I wygral i wygral" which indeed does mean, "And he won, he won," but at the same time it means "he has played and played" until the dead maiden burst into tears. The other meaning creates a different atmosphere, opens other vistas of interpretation, but ? most importantly ? it reveals a fundamental feature of Lesmian's poetic art, of his use of the richness and potential of each single word to derive from itself poetic images, metaphors, symbols. Lesmian thus makes the rendering of fragments of his poetry even in prose a strenuous task, with which Stone struggles as effectively as possible, though here and there some corrections would be in order. The core of Lesmian's esthetics and poetics as well as their philosophical back 53</page><page sequence="2">54 The Polish Review ground are presented by Stone in a distinct and convincing way. One of the best parts of the book is by far the deliberations on Lesmian's perception of Bergson's philosophy. This is the more important because Bergson's philosophy has had the most lasting impact on Lesmian's Weltanschauung and on his esthetics and poetic conceptions. Perhaps the fact that one cannot treat Lesmian merely as a disciple engrossed in Bergson's teaching deserves more emphasis. Lesmian bore to some extent the prescience and intuitions of twentieth-century philosophical trends yet to come. The formulated aim of the study is to present Lesmian's esthetics and his "immanent poetics" as implied from his poetry. This "immanent poetics" ? we are told ? "can serve as a testimony of his esthetics even if he had never written any philosophical essays" (p. 168). Fortunately he did, and they are, indeed, largely consonant with his esthetic and poetical tenets. At the same time the convergence of these tenets and ideas with Lesmian's poetry is also extremely striking. It might be said that it is relatively easy to read his esthetics and poetics in his poetic work. Stone maintains that Lesmian was a theoretician in spite of himself, but what she actually proves is just the opposite. To be sure, Lesmian detested and rejected programs, the rigidity of any doctrine of poetry. However, theoretical pronounce ments, including ideas and ideals of poetry, he delivered deliberately and abun dantly until his last days. Stone puts Lesmian's concept of rhythm, formulated as well as exercised in his poetry, at the center of his poetics. The poet himself has devoted a great deal of writing to this subject. It was also indicated correctly that the concept of rhythm as perceived by Lesmian is the core of his symbolism. The parts of the dissertation devoted to Lesmian's principle of rhythm as essential to all poetry, to the rhythm's artistic and revelatory character, seem well done. The parts of Stone's book concerned with Lesmian's uses of paradox, of the absurd and the grotesque, as well as with the type of humor found in his poems are highly illuminating. Perhaps one could wish that somewhat more attention had been paid to the relationship of these poetic structures with Lesmian's philosophical views, to his perception of man's position in the universe, of life and death, of man's relation to nature, of the relationship of these forms with his anxiety of existence and, finally, to his notions of creativity. Moreover, such attention certainly would deepen our understanding of Lesmian's propensity to anthropomorphism. Also lucidly presented are the most characteristic genres of Lesmian's poetry, the poetic fairy tale, the ballad, the grotesque representation of reality and the particular flavor of myth, of legend, of nature and the world apart, pervading Lesmian's poems, and their creation of a magical and fantastic world existing apart yet side by side with everyday, usually base, reality. Stone also corroborates Lesmian's handling of folklore in his formulated poetics and in his poetic practice. She indicates that it is one of the most important problems of his poetry. She shows convincingly that it is difficult to see these connections as utilizations of "folk stylization." She observes that Lesmian "incor porates folkloristic themes, motifs, and concepts into his own poetic system" (p. 233). Less accurate is the claim that Lesmian's originality is expressed in the fact that he "introduced folkloric elements into poetry that was philosophical in charac ter" (p. 289). Lesmian's immediate predecessor in this area was Maria Konopnicka;</page><page sequence="3">Lesmian's Poetry Analyzed_55 several times he paid tribute to her poetic work, praised its merits, and defined his approach to folklore in contrast to hers. Lesmian deliberately transformed folk loristic elements in his poetry and made them vehicles for his philosophical problems. He transformed them at will to serve and express his visions and ideas. These folkloric elements were never used in their original shape and context. This practice sets Lesmian apart from the widespread cult of primitive peasant culture in the Polish as well as in the Russian literature of his time. In its crude and primitive form folklore was to Lesmian of no more use than a dictionary, i.e., as raw material. Its elements are not introduced into Lesmian's poetry, they are recreated or even created de novo. That does not go against the grain of Stone's deliberation; rather, it brings home ? also ? the chief idea of Lesmian's notion of poetry as an act of creation, of bringing about what did not exist before. Stone reassures us that it is not her purpose "to rehabilitate the great poet; this has been done admirably by his first monographer, Jacek Trznadel" (p. 3). How ever, her rhetoric of zeal and admiration on the one hand, and her vindictive treatment of Lesmian's alleged and real detractors and persecutors on the other, leaves a stubborn impression that the process of "rehabilitation" is still going on, despite the disclaimer. One wonders why a book published in 1976 omits mention of Pankowski's French study on Lesmian (1967) that has done for the foreign reader what Trznadel did for the Polish. But apart from this, the numerous references Stone makes to studies of Lesmian by Jastrun, Milosz, Przybos, Blohski, Sandauer, Glowinski, Karpowicz, Slawiriski, Kwiatkowska, and many others make it self evident that there is no more need for "rehabilitation." The obstinacy with which Stone advances this is regrettably stuffed with preconceptions and misrepresenta tions. Let it be remembered that in Lesmian's last years recognition of his poetry did take place; it found expression in quite a few critical pronouncements and, institutionally, in Lesmian's being named in 1933 to membership in the exclusive and prestigious Polish Academy of Literature. It was a conspicuous sign of the acclaim of Lesmian's work, not the other way around. Outstanding literary critics, like Irzykowski and Ortwin, were enthusiastic about Lqka (1920), which marked a turning point in Lesmian's poetic work. But the majority of critics castigated the poet for his decadence and poetic impotence. The two dominant poetic movements in Poland considered him either a ghost of the past or an inspired poetic crank, admired and deserving of having his hand kissed but not worthy of mention as a potential influence and inspiration. These same poets of the "Skamander" and of the Vanguard expressed admiration for him publicly only long after he was dead. Only then did Lesmian cease being for some a representative of "Young Poland," from which it was necessary to dissociate oneself programmatically as much as possible, especially because it was impossible to do so in the area of poetic practice; for others the voicing of opposition came out of necessity for programmatic defiance in poetic spontaneity, and a need to enhance their own achievements in the modernization of the language of poetry. For the latter Lesmian has been a terrible example of poetical traditionalism, and one even wonders that he was not hit with such rudeness and cruelty as were aimed at others of his generation (Kasprowicz, Miriam, Tetmajer) who were dubbed representatives of poetic decadence, con servatism, or "organ grinding." For Stone, however, this picture of failure to realize the dimensions of Lesmian's</page><page sequence="4">56 The Polish Review poetry, of inability to perceive its greatness, does not suffice. She takes her sus picions in strange and dubious directions. "This neglect," states Stone, "was apparently intentional, for a hatred of everything Russian must have been com bined, in Legmian's case with deep-rooted anti-Semitism" (p. 3). These are not intimations but insinuations, heaped on each other. It would be foolish and even vicious to deny that anti-Semitic sentiments, as pronounced as they were, and anti Semitic manifestations and actions, had no impact on someone as sensitive and vulnerable as Lesmian. In spite of his full identification with what we may call Polishness (his Jewish parents converted to Roman Catholicism), Lesmian cer tainly was exposed to anti-Semitism. Now and then the anti-Semitic offenses did hit or seemed to Lesmian to hit him personally. In all certainty it must have been painful for Lesmian to read the vile accusations of a fascist scribbler that he, Lesmian, was corrupting the language with his Jewishness. It must have been poignant to learn that his daughter's boyfriend declined to marry her because of her father's Jewish origins. Such experiences (and who can know them all?) must have affected Lesmian's life, and they should not be disregarded when discussing his poetic work (though one can hardly indicate any oblique connection). To deny them off-hand, however, would be a risky step. Information on this issue is imprecise, scarce, second-hand, often grossly exaggerated, and some of it mani festly untrue. However, Stone overstates the case on the one hand and is highly uncritical in dealing with this information, on the other. Just the linking of anti Semitism with critical neglect of Lesmian's poetry calls for an amount of precon ceptions and assumptions which is dazzling and breathtaking, and the process of obscuring the problem does not stop here. Stone proclaims (and it is her original invention) that Lesmian was harassed as a poet throughout his life. To Polish hatred of all that is Russian and to anti Semitism one has to add professional jealousy as another reason for Lesmian's neglect (p. 22). The villains are of various sorts, but their actions started, a little bit surprisingly, with Stanislaw Brzozowski who, if anybody, represented in Polish literature "the Russian flood" and, for most nationalists, "Jewish influence," if not open servitude to the Jewish cause. But Stone says: "The year 1904 was a decisive one in Lesmian's life, for it marked the beginning of the protracted literary campaign against him" (p. 7). For this campaign Stone can summon only two critics, whose voices sound relatively mild, that of Brzozowski (compare his judgments of any other "Young Poland" poet) and that of Avanti (this pseudonym barely concealing the not very well-known Jewish leftist writer and journalist Grzegorz Glass, brought up in Russia in the atmosphere of admiration for Polish and Russian culture, visibly influenced by the Russian radicals). It may be worth noting that Brzozowski as well as Glass criticized Lesmian's alleged estheticism and escapism marginally; the main target of both critics were some leading poets and periodicals of that time; Miriam-Przesmycki, the Chimera, etc. Stone obviously wants to hold on to the notion of the critics'guilt for being unwilling or incapable of alloting to Lesmian the literary position he deserved and which he ultimately acquired in Polish literary history. The failures of criticism, to be sure, had much to do with the discrepancy between Lesmian's genuine poetic stature and his reputa tion until his death in 1937. But even if we grant this, there is still much exaggeration as to the scope of "guilt" and neglect of criticism. LeSmian was indeed conspicu</page><page sequence="5">Lesmian's Poetry Analyzed_57 ously absent from most of the traditional surveys of Polish literature. Great and outstanding scholars sometimes revealed a shocking lack of sensitivity when it came to Lesmian's poetry (e.g., Bruckner, Kridl, Krzyzanowski). One can hardly over look the significance of that phenomenon. More than anything else it is telling, however, how chroniclers of established values often fell short of recognizing novelty, including that of Lesmian's poetry. More credit should be given to the first critical intimation of Lesmian's work. Instead one finds harsh overstatements or omissions. Stone's contentions that Lesmian "was completely unknown to the Polish intelligentsia" (p. 2) is an example of her frequent exaggerations. Nor is it accurate to claim that "his poetry was curiously absent from anthologies" (p. 1). Having at hand only four, published between 1903 and 1931, of the time when Lesmian's poetry was certainly most disregarded, I found selections of his poems in all of them (Staff 1903, Mirski, Slonski, and Galinski 1931). In Galihski's anthology Lesmian's poetry opens ? in 1931 ? "the tableau of modern Polish poetic creativity in the period 1918-1930." The three poems presented there are considered Lesmian's masterpieces of erotic poetry. As for criticism one more claim seems in order, since it reflects to some extent on the whole image of Lesmian literary fortune. In 1934 a prolific literary critic, Kazimierz Czachowski, published the first volumes of his bulky (3 vol.) history of Polish literature of the period 1884-1934, which was then and remains even today the most exhaustive survey of Polish letters of that time. The author was a diligent rather than an inventive critic, a popularizer of established opinions rather than a chronicler of individual critical experience. Czachowski's book is rightly considered a mirror of current literary opinions. And one will be surprised to find that they coincide ? in quite a few important matters ? with our contemporary evaluations of Lesmian's poetry. To be sure, Czachowski's remarks on Lesmian's philosophical tenets are hopelessly perfunc tory and perplexing. This however did not prevent Czachowski from pronouncing Lesmian, along with Staff, the most outstanding Polish poet. Czachowski indicates that Lesmian was the first in his generation and was a long way ahead of others due "to his unusual concreteness of poetic vision and imagery" (II, 64). The author has singled out the traits of mastery of Lesmian's poetry, its plasticity, concealed energy, and sensuality. Lesmian's greatness is not endangered by the small quantity of his poems. The quality of every single poem recompenses in abundance his meager output: "Almost each poem of Lesmian is fully mature, perfect, and unique" (II, 66). His merits ? said Czachowski, or rather the current critical opinions ? are the more significant because of the inspirational effect which Lesmian's poetry exerted on various poets and poetical movements, no matter how adverse they might be to each other. "In various ways Lesmian's poetry influenced simultaneously Tuwim and the poets of the "Skamander," Zegadtowicz and his satellites ("Czartak"), and even those Vanguard poets who strive to break with tradition. On the whole it is Lesmian, who after Staff, has among all predecessors of contemporary poetry exerted the most remarkable influence on its development" (II, 66). Czachowski, otherwise so circumspect in his evaluations, pronounced them here with ease. This tells much about Lesmian's reputation in the last years of his life. It was only the postwar decade of growing Stalinization of standards in literature in Poland that brought about the neglect of Lesmian's work, as it did for many other values of human genius and dignity.</page><page sequence="6">58 The Polish Review At one point Czachowski dwelled on the character of Lesmian's metaphor, interestingly described by Stone. Czachowski was also struck by the originality of Lesmian's metaphor; he points to its novelty and expressive intensity. Czachowski concluded: "Lesmian's metaphor which he exploited already in his prewar poems, is in its kind akin to this of the Russian poetical school of the "imaginists"; the use of this metaphor will spread only in the postwar era" (II, 66). This Polish and Russian convergence was disclosed without the slightest reproach. Lesmian's Russian "connections" were considered then and later as enriching, and no cause what soever for neglect. This brings us to the threshold of the main contentions which Stone's book generates. "The total disregard for Lesmian's ties with Russian literature and culture," claims Stone, "vital to his formative years, the lack of interest in his poetic creed and in his biography made it impossible for the majority of critics to under stand his work" (p. 3). I am afraid that the majority of critics was never able to understand Lesmian's work. What puzzles rather is the fact that a half-dozen Polish literary critics, who may have also totally disregarded all this, were able to under stand Lesmian's work: Irzykowski, Ortwin, Szczerbowski, Fryde, Napierski, Cza chowski, Jastrun, to mention only the authors of the most important early critical pronouncements. The autonomous strength of Lesmian's poetry, its quality, proved for many to be quite noticeable. There is no doubt that Lesmian's ties with Russian literature, culture, and people were, indeed, neglected; little attention was paid to them as a source of inspiration, though strangely enough Lesmian himself more than once pointed to them. Such ties were not something unusual in Lesmian's generation. Dozens of Polish writers had some connection with foreign backgrounds: Russian, Austrian, German, even French, often producing successful attempts at writing literary works in foreign languages. To mention only a few: Przybyszewski, Rittner, Kasprowicz, the Brzozowskis, Lieder, Feldman. In this regard Lesmian's attempt at writing Russian poetry was apparently not so excep tional. Stone presents a cluster of misconceptions betraying a rather poor knowledge of the Polish literary scene and its relationship to Russian literature. First of all, Lesmian belonged to a cosmopolitan literary generation open to inspiration from everywhere ? Scandinavia, Germany, France, and, of course, Russia. This genera tion was historically the first in all of Poland's history to relish overtly Russian literature, theater, music, and folklore. The same is true for the subsequent genera tion which gave Poland unmatched translations of the greatest prose writers and poets of Russia, from Pushkin and Gogol to Yesenin and Mayakovsky. It is with amazement that one reads about this "hatred of everything Russian" remembering at the same time that twentieth-century Russian poetry actually inspired contem porary poetic movements and groups in independent Poland, no matter how opposed they were to each other. References to the Russian background of Lesmian's biography and works are in Stone's book numerous, some revealing and of moment, others of less significance, a number manifestly inaccurate or erroneous. The overall failure of dealing with these problems rests clearly with false and wrong preconceptions. Let me recall one statement: "It was, no doubt, from Russian literature that he (Lesmian) drew his first impressions, for he obtained his primary, high-school, and university educa</page><page sequence="7">Lesmian's Poetry Analyzed_ 59 tion in Kiev" (p. 38). I, for one, nurture some doubts. It seems to me that these first impressions, by logic and consequence of circumstances, came from Polish litera ture; Lesmian's awareness of his Polish nationality was, as far as we know, never in question. There is no doubt that he grew up bilingual (at least), that he grew up at the crossroads of Russian and Polish culture, but one thing must be clearly dis cerned, the framework of all these processes and of individual evolutions, was, in Lesmian's case, Polish culture. There are in Lesmian's work more and less noticeable influences of the Russian literary past, close ties with its presence, probably the closest any Polish poet of this period ever came to. Traces of these influences and connections can be found in Lesmian's own references to many aspects of Russian culture and literature; more interesting are certainly those discernible in his poetic work. Some of these prob lems have already been discussed by Polish literary critics in the last twenty years. The disputed issues range from some stylistic manners and imagery to Lesmian's Weltanschauung and to his formulated concepts of poetry. There were, moreover, areas of Russian culture and literature, which were intimately familiar to Lesmian. The strongest point could be made here for his familiarity with Russian (and Ukrainian) folklore, folk poetry. However Stone carries too far her claims for Lesmian's deep understanding of Russian literature, culture, and thought. His remarks, for instance, on Tolstoy, and particularly on Balmont make one prone to think just the opposite. To consider, around 1910, Konstantin Balmont "the most interesting phenomenon in Russian literature" (these are Lesmian's words) does not bespeak that familiarity. Stone is ever eager to indicate Lesmian's familiarity with Russian culture and its influence on him. It does not always sound plausible and more than once we are confronted with a display of evidence and reasoning which constitutes a challenge to our critical sense. Commenting, for instance, on Les mian's rather outworn commonplace complaint of the impossibility of expressing spiritual life in words, a complaint the Polish Neo-Romantics used to repeat incessantly after the Romantics, Stone is quick to attribute it to Tiutchev's influence (p. 152). The same goes for Lesmian's pantheism, and it does not bother Stone very much that Lesmian himself pointed clearly to Spinoza. Now and then we read assertions like this: "Some aspects of Gogol's art are of considerable significance in Lesmian's creative evolution. However this topic requires a separate study" (p. 60). "Considerable significance in Lesmian's creative evolution" ? arouses the reader's attention. In vain, however, are all expectations of any argument, any evidence. Elsewhere one can wrack one's brain in vain guessing why Lesmian's poem "Dab" (Oak), comprising most profound implications for his metaphysics and for his notions of nature and poetry, makes him "at once a follower of Gogol and fore runner of such poets as Mayakovsky" (p. 204). It also seems that Stone attributes to Lesmian's Russian poems, written in 1905, much more merit than they deserve. She finds them expressing in a more mature way his poetic creed, while in his Polish poetry he was, then, still groping for direction (p. 151). And one can hardly wonder that the conclusion would be that "it was perhaps easier for the poet to crystallize his ideas in Russian than in Polish" (p. 151). What strikes one, however, in reading these poems is that they are almost entirely lacking the inventiveness, singularity, and uniqueness of Lesmian's poetic language. Instead, he does express smoothly his poetic creed, but, quite conspicu</page><page sequence="8">60 The Polish Review ously, in a conventional manner, borrowing heavily from the Russian Symbolist store of images and metaphors accessible then to any poetaster. On this basis Lesmian did not exhibit any significant novelty of poetic expression. The language of these poems is by any critical standards blatantly conventional. It was not in his Russian exercises that Lesmian tried to create a new poetic idiom of his own. As for the crystallization of his ideas, Lesmian was then, at least as distant from this in his Russian as in his Polish poems. But in the latter he tried, in the former he displayed an unusual skill of adaptation rather than of inventiveness and of poetic quest. Even Lesmian's famous use of neologisms, which he also introduced in his Russian poems, as he did in his Polish poems, reveals a significant difference. The novelty, uniqueness and, at the same time, the imposing organic suitability of Lesmian's neologism in his Polish poetry have certainly no match in his Russian poems. Oddly enough the neologisms which appear in the latter are, as was convincingly argued by an excellent translator and expert of Russian poetry, Seweryn Pollak, rather polonisms than neologisms. There are probably more important and arguable statements referring to the Russian background of the Polish poet, but the following seem particularly telling of unyielding attempts at scoring points. Stone points to undeniable examples of influence on Lesmian of Russian poetry's use of language, particularly, perhaps, of folk poetry. The Russian origins of some idioms, of whole poetic patterns, are preserved in Lesmian's writing, though even in this regard he had predecessors in Polish poetry beginning with the greatest: Mickiewicz and Slowacki. But Stone has overstated to an extreme the case of the range of their real use and influence by including arguments which betray a much better knowledge of Russian than Polish. The following examples will probably suffice, though they are only a few of a good many others. Thus, as definite traces of Russian, Stone is quick to deem, for instance, Lesmian's use of the dialectism of verbs in the first person plural of the present tense: Bedziem, mozem, kladziem sie, odbierzem, stoim, pqjdziem, etc. just because it is identical with the normal first person plural of Russian verbs. True enough, but what about the universality of this form in almost all Polish dialects, in the language of the peasantry, in folklore? What about the fact that it is an old Polish literary form going back to the very beginning of Polish poetry and pre served in the most lasting way? It would come as news to the eighteenth-century author of the Polish national anthem to learn that the lines Przejdziem Wisle, przejdziem Warte Bedziem Polakami, bear definite traces of Russian. Another case in point. Stone cited a line in Lesmian: "Wszyscy na kon juz siedli_"To this is added an elaborate explanation that the use of the preposition na (on) with the Acc. Nom. of an animate noun with a verb of motion is rather a synthetical feature in Russian. From this stems a subtle hint that "this Polish archaism is used normally in modern Russian" (p. 228). Again, it is true, yet one should still keep in mind that this "Polish archaism" is preserved as a popular idiom in common as well as in literary usage. The phrase "siqsc na kon"and analogical idioms bear upon the Polish speaker no associations with Russian whatsoever. Stone sees also possible folklorist Russian influence in Lesmian's use of some compound adjectives, though she loyally warns that "some of these are also Polish</page><page sequence="9">Lesmian's Poetry Analyzed 61 archaisms." This is not a matter of single distinctions. One has to remember that it goes back to the beginnings of Polish poetry, even to medieval poetry, and it was reinforced by sixteenth- and eighteenth-century classical influence and was later abundantly used by Slowacki, much admired by Lesmian, though nobody would guess this from Stone's dissertation. In addition, this use underwent an obtrusive survival among poets of Lesmian's generation. Stone is not alone in maintaining that Lesmian was the only consistent Symbolist in Polish literature. Such opinion has its strong points. No Polish poet reveals as much awareness of the intricacies of Symbolist poetry as Lesmian in his critical and esthetic pronouncements and in his poetic works. Lesmian is considered therefore as "the only writer to emerge from the Young Poland phase with a coherent program for Symbolist poetry" (p. x). At least one other poet, Lesmian's friend and a lifelong protector, Zenon Przesmycki-Miriam, though himself rather a Parnas sist, presented in his essays, several years before his younger friend came of age, a "coherent program for Symbolist poetry." There is another consequence of that fashion of treating Lesmian as the sole poet and theoretician who "represents true Symbolism in Poland" (p. 180). It does not seem right to discard Wyspianski. Lesmian himself was less exclusive and has written with admiration on Wyspian ski's Symbolist art. (Although no one would guess it from Stone's study.) Wyspian ski and a score of poets, prose writers, and literary critics have their place in the Symbolist experience of Polish literature. Symbolism had there, as elsewhere, many mansions, and this is the only way of judiciously approaching its problems. At one point it is even fairly stated (p. 82): "Springing from various literary sources, Symbolism, at the turn of the twentieth century, represented various trends as well as a change of values." Oddly enough the comprehensive concept of Symbolism is soon forgotten. No sooner does Stone go on to the business of a rather vague presentation of the specific and limited perception of Symbolism in Polish litera ture than she states that "there was [in Polish literature] a lack of understanding of Symbolism in general on the part of both the proponents and the detractors of Young Poland. . . . Under close scrutiny the apparent influence of French Symbolism in Young Poland is only hypothetical" (p. 15). It is hard to accept such an ignorance of Symbolism on the part of Antoni Lange, Lesmian's cousin, from whose abundant critical writings he probably learned more about Symbolism than from anybody else, something Stone would not, probably, be anxious to admit. The same objection goes for Lesmian's friend Miriam, for Ignacy Matuszewski, Jan Lorentowicz, and a dozen other writers, notable poets, and novelists. The elimina tion of Symbolism from the Polish literary background, in spite of the presence of the works of Kasprowicz, Staff, Micinski, and Berent, is not without advantages when one is advancing a concept of the Russian origins of Lesmian's Symbolism. Stone has devoted a lengthy chapter to describing the connections and simi larities of Lesmian's formulated poetics and of his poetic work to the poetic ideas of some of the poets of the so-called second generation of Russian Symbolists. No doubt there is here some remarkable convergence and much indicates that Les mian's poetic views and practice might have been affected to some extent by the ideas propounded by some poets of this generation, particularly by Bely and Ivanov. It was not sheer coincidence that brought Ivanov and Lesmian to proclaim the main task of poetry to be the restoration of the mythical perception of life. The</page><page sequence="10">62 The Polish Review recognized role of Bely and the acclaim of his theoretical writing was probably also not without effect on Lesmian's critical and theoretical pronouncements. But it seems to me that these connections and similarities between Lesmian and Bely and Ivanov are, again, overstated to excess, as is the case with the whole presentation of Lesmian's Russian background. We are prompted to accept, with strikingly little evidence, Lesmian's ties with the second generation of Russian Symbolism, as well as his familiarity with it, notably with Bely, never even mentioned by Lesmian, and with Ivanov. Lesmian praised and recommended Ivanov's article on Nietzsche, "an article of a certain Russian Ivanov" ("artykul jednego Rosjanina Iwanowa," Utwory rozproszone, p. 304). It is hard to say that this fashion of informing betrays ? as we are asked to believe ? a note of familiarity. The description of affinities and similarities between Lesmian and the Russian Symbolists is centered on Bely and Ivanov as "the most representative of the Russian poets and theoreti cians of the second generation" (p. 147). One realizes an obstinate reluctance to admitting striking differences and contrarities which are not of less importance than the existing affinities and similarities. Some things are even considered common features of all three poets, though they are not. Bely's concept of nature as a source of symbols still has to be reconciled with Lesmian's notion of the symbol as an act of imagination. Ivanov's disregard for folklore contrasts sharply with Lesmian's praising it as a source of poetic inspiration. Mysticism, and even occultism are foreign to Lesmian, while they are not to the Russian poets. Stone ascribes to all three poets ? Lesmian, Bely, and Ivanov ? the conviction that life's reality passes as a dream, that only art represents true reality and the essence of life (p. 181). But this clearly distorts Lesmian's views, his attachment to reality and his ideal of life as a creative activity. Another question begging for attention is the striking fact that between Les mian's theoretical tenets and concepts and his poetic work there exists an accord, going as far as the possibility of detecting in it his formulated poetics. Lesmian, in his critical writings and theoretical pronouncements, treated in an expository way, as far as possible, the issues of his poetic practice. In brief, the theoretician and critic merely complement here the practitioner. That is not the case with the two Russian poets brought into comparison, both of whom reveal a profound discrepancy between their poetic theory and concepts and their poetic work. In the case of Ivanov and Bely we are dealing with outspoken leaders of poetical groups. They seem at all times to be in a state of transition, in critical search for formulae that will encompass a whole Weltanschauung, ideological solutions for their country, for basic precepts, and for standards of critical judgment of poetry. In the thicket of their theoretical and critical writing it was possible to find nourishment for different poetic theories and concepts, often of significant historical importance. Their writing was able to inspire extreme adversaries. Mystics and anti-mystics, realists and idealists, universalists and narrow-minded nationalists (the mysticism of the Russian soil!), and eventually Symbolists and anti-Symbolists. Mandelstam has had good reason to maintain that "Ivanov contributed very much to the rise of the theory of Acmeism." Stone notices significant similarities in the ideas and concepts of Lesmian on the one hand and of Bely and Ivanov on the other. However, rarely is the question raised as to whether these similarities do not correspond altogether with other</page><page sequence="11">Lesmian's Poetry Analyzed 63 Symbolist trends in Europe. This deserves much more attention. The Polish poet and his Russian peers had common preceptors and inspirations. Their common theoretical and poetic store accounts for many affinities. Quite a bit of what is shared by Ivanov, Bely, and Lesmian should be traced back to Nietzsche, French Symbolism, Bergson (e.g., concepts of poetry, art, nature, poetic intuition, musi cality, and rhythm). In spite of all these objections, Stone's drawing attention to Lesmian's plausible connections with the whole atmosphere created by Symbolism in Russia, and particularly by its second generation there, seems a right track to take in attempting to enrich the background of Lesmian's literary biography and of his work. But her conclusions are carried much too far; she maintains: "One can justifiably contend that Lesmian was in almost complete accord with the second generation of Russian Symbolists" (p. 175). The word "almost" here is terribly spacious. In some cases it includes some very discordant qualities: contradictory tenets of philosophy, esthetics, and poetics, not to mention poetic practice. Therein exists that kind of abyss between Lesmian on the one hand and Ivanov and Bely on the other that does not even permit of attempts at bridging it. The riddle of Lesmian's specific position in literary history will probably not be resolved along the lines formulated by Stone. As much as a Symbolist Lesmian seems to be opposed to the Symbolist fashion; ultimately he was opposed to all doctrines, fashions, and canons which restrain the free flow of poetic imagination and the means of expression. This attitude transpires clearly from Lesmian's quite early utterances about poetry. He felt disillusioned with all poetic programs and longed for a kind of anticonceptual poetry, for poetry nurtured by vital impulses of nature and concrete reality, for poetry grasping the tangible, the sensual. One of his later, more mature pronouncements was turned against the Symbolist fashion and manner employed by his friend Staff: "Even such words as the sun, love, heart, body, muscles sound in his mouth like melodious allegories.. "(Szkice Literackie (Literary Essays), p. 333). One could say, besides, that Lesmian was not the only Symbolist who feared that poetic mannerism and fashion produce dangerous rifts between poetry and sensibility, between poetic expression and the perception of nature and all reality. This and other similar statements disclose rather an attitude which would fit to some extent with the poetics and concepts of some Acmeists (Gorodetzki, Gumilov, Akhmatova, Mandelstam, Zenkevich, Narbut). Pan kowski, noticing some affinities, even suggested that future inquiries and docu mentary discoveries might bring to light now unknown connections of Lesmian with the Acmeists. As things stand now ? and what matters most ? is that Lesmian's poetic path also led beyond this version of Symbolism as represented by Bely and Ivanov, and, what is no less important, beyond Symbolism altogether. Overstatements combined with obvious misconceptions have obfuscated even the better parts of Stone's book. Those interested in Lesmian's poetic work should nonetheless not miss these merits.</page></plain_text>
