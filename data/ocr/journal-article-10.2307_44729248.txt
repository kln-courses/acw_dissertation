D'Aulerio, and Gary R. Whitman ARCCA Inc. ABSTRACT Actual automobile crash scenarios include "wheels-first" landings after the vehicle leaves the road surface and becomes momentarily airborne. These events generate a vertical acceleration vector in a headward direction (+Gz) along the occupant's spinal axis. In this scenario, the vehicle occupant could be in contact with the seat bottom or seat back cushions, or displaced several inches off both the bottom and/or back cushions depending on the effectiveness of the restraint configuration and the dynamics of the vehicle's motion. Military ejection seat researchers have shown that occupant response to +Gz acceleration loading is amplified as a function of the spring-mass damping characteristics of the total system (i.e., the occupant and seat/restraint/cushion subsystems). This amplification phenomenon, commonly known as "dynamic overshoot", has the propensity to vary widely depending on the built-in controls within a given seat bottom design. This paper explores +Gz "dynamic overshoot" in the automobile environment and addresses variation as a function of initial position and seat design characteristics. INTRODUCTION The purpose of any vehicle's occupant restraint system is to protect occupants and increase survival probability during crash impact. Restraint systems have three basic functions: to prevent occupant ejection from the vehicle; to prevent or minimize the effects of "secondary collisions", such as impacting interior structure; and to control the crash forces imposed on the occupant. Occupant restraint devices such as three-point lap/shoulder harnesses have been widely researched and improved over the years, significantly increasing automotive safety. However, attention to the seating portion of the automotive restraint has not been as extensive. One concern is the design of many contemporary automotive seat bottoms which embody compliant characteristics during vertical loading (+Gz). Compliant characteristics would intuitively appear to be capable of producing excessive occupant displacements during impulsive loading, exposing the occupant to structural strike hazards and offering little management of the crash impact energy. BACKGROUND A study with human cadavers during vertical loading, conducted in the early 1960's, concluded that the "dynamic load factor" (referred to in this paper as "dynamic overshoot") increased for all types of cushions used in those tests. The report also concludes that "a soft cushion which bottoms during an impulsive force causes more overshoot than no cushion ." Military technologists have expended considerable effort researching the problem of +Gz exposures, both in the ejection seat and crash-resistant seat areas, because this force vector becomes a prominent i actor in many occupant survival scenarios. Helicopt*" occupants experience significant +Gz acceleration ring crashes and hard landings. Ejection seat occupant, also experience significant +Gz accelerations as the seat is rapidly propelled from the aircraft. Military experiments on ejection and helicopter seats have demonstrated that a contoured rigid seat pan covered with a rate-dependent, foam cushion provides reasonable occupant response by minimizing displacement under load. Displacement-controlling seat bottoms define occupant kinematics in a predictable manner, enabling designers to identify and protect the occupant from potential structural strike hazards. This type of seat bottom prevents occupant response from exhibiting excessive "dynamic overshoot." Human tolerance to +Gz (spinal) loading can be expressed in terms of both amplitude and time duration. This data, commonly reported as the Eiband Curves**, identifies the 23 G-level over approximately a 5.5 millisecond time duration as a critical transition point for the threshold injury region in the spineward direction. * Hodgson, V.R., Lissner, H.R., and Patrick, L.M., 1963, Response of the Seated Human Cadaver to Acceleration and Jerk with and without Seat Cushions , The Journal of the Human Factors Society. ** Eiband, A. Martin, 1959, Human Tolerance to Rapidly Applied Accelerations: A Summary of the Literature , National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Washington. 1933</page><page sequence="2">Subsequent investigation by military researchers in the development of ejection seat designs essentially substantiated Eiband's data. However, it is generally accepted that these tolerance values are based on healthy young males ideally positioned with the mid-axillary line of the spine parallel to the acceleration vector. Also, researchers agree that departure from ideal prepositioning or ideal physiology of the seated occupant tends to lower the spine's ability to tolerate +Gz loading without serious injury. Consequently, occupant characteristics such as age, sex, bone strength, and initial position can affect occupant response to impulsive acceleration loading, resulting in serious spinal injury even at levels substantially below Eiband's 23G's criterion. As a result of these variables, researchers define a "risk" regime of +Gz exposures where extreme caution must be taken to avoid spinal injuries. To help understand this concept, note the following example: standard military protocol for testing human subjects to +Gz exposures generally permits initial exposure at a "safe" level of 6G's for training and indoctrination purposes. Acceleration is then gradually increased in 1G to 2G increments, using the 8G and 10G levels to study kinematic motions. Exposure to higher levels (i.e., 12G's and beyond) defines the "risk" range and is undertaken only after careful analysis of occupant response in the "safe" range. The close relationship between the "safe" range and the "risk" range in the Gz axis has necessitated careful control of dynamic overshoot with military seating systems to prevent avoidable and unnecessary increase of exposure in the "risk" range. This principle is directly applicable to all vehicles that experience a +Gz exposure. Automotive seat designers typically use several different seat bottom design approaches which depart radically from the military approach. Some contain varied thickness of non-rate dependent padding material integrated with an array of springs and positioned over an open space within the seat cushion frame. Other designs simply use thick layers of similar padding material mounted within a rigid seat bottom structure. Still others use a hybrid of cushion foams and structures. Occupant comfort is a high priority goal in automotive seat cushion technology; nevertheless, military cushion design for the +Gz acceleration environment has shown that an acceptable comfort-versus- safety tradeoff can be achieved, even considering the effects of fatigue to long-duration missions. While test data has substantiated the military designs, the authors found no public data validating the automotive designs. To evaluate dynamic performance under controlled laboratory conditions an initial impact test program was conducted on several typical production automotive seat models. Variables such as test dummy size/weight/initial position, and crash pulse peak accelerations/velocity changes were controlled to determine influence on occupant response. TEST METHODOLOGY The dynamic response characteristics of the test articles were evaluated by determining the amplification ratios between the forcing function (i.e., the simulated crash pulse) and the occupant's inertial response (as measured at the anthropomorphic test device's [ATD] pelvis), both appropriately filtered. In addition, consideration was given to the phase lag between input and response curves, the relative shape of the ATD's acceleration profile, and the existence of any "bottoming-out" events by the ATD on structural components of the test seat. This study addressed two hypothetical acceleration-time profiles in the "safe range" (see Figure 1) and evaluated the factors that affect dynamic overshoot in the occupant. The test matrix, as represented in Table 1, illustrates the different ATD positions used during the runs to simulate a sampling of potential positions of occupants during an incident in which a vehicle has left the road surface and become airborne prior to a "wheels-first" impact. 10.0 -i S 8.0- 2 60 ' &lt;g 4.0 - rJ/ &lt;g Ö /V 20 " { ■ . &lt;1 ^ J -50 0 50 100 150 200 250 Time (msec) Figure 1: Range of Input Accelerations Selected for this study were four automotive seat designs, one modified seat using specially adapted military type seating technology and one rigid platform to serve as the control article. Two Hybrid III ATDs were used as surrogates: one 5th percentile male and one 50th percentile male (both configured with articulating pelvises). The methodology of this dynamic test program was to conduct a comparative evaluation of several production- model automotive seats by subjecting them to a series of dynamic crash conditions in the +Gz axis. Specific goals included: 1. Measurement of the ATDs dynamic response to the applied loading in the +Gz axis when seated in the various test articles. 2. Establishment of a "baseline" dynamic response with a totally non-compliant system. 3. Comparison of an alternate seat bottom design. 1934</page><page sequence="3">The program's ultimate objective was to gain a better understanding of occupant impact dynamics in the +Gz axis for the purpose of improving automotive safety. TEST ARTICLES The four automotive driver-side bucket seat designs selected for this test study where taken from: 1. 1991 Full Size Sedan (FSS) 2. 1989 Compact Sports Coupe (CSC) 3. 1987 Multi-Purpose Passenger Van (MPV) 4. 1980 Compact Import Sedan (CIS) In addition, one alternate design seat bottom assembly was fabricated and topped with a commercially available rate-dependent, slow recovery, open-cell padding material. Two inches of this material in a medium density were laid over a contoured molded foam which fît into the seat bottom space of the 1987 MPV seat. A rigid flat seat surface fabricated from wood was also contoured to fit into the MPV seat bottom frame. This served as the test baseline seat intended only to produce best-case coupling of the ATDs to the seat structure. The baseline seat platform was tested only with the 50th percentile ATD. Baseline platform response parameters were used as the control test for comparison with the production seat test articles. The MPV seat was selected as the platform for both the alternate design and the baseline because the seat bottom frame configuration could be readily adapted to provide an unencumbered support for both designs. POSITIONING OF THE ANTHROPOMORPHIC TEST DEVICE (ATD) When a vehicle is about to encounter a "wheels-first" landing, the occupant can actually experience a -Gz acceleration causing him to rise from the seat. As the "wheels-first" landing occurs, the acceleration direction changes as the occupant experiences a +Gz acceleration and applies a load to the seat bottom. Initial position of the occupant just prior to touch down is affected by the use of belt restraints, the type of belt restraints, the dynamics of the vehicle, as well as the orientation of the occupant. For this test program an orientation at erect posture forward- facing was selected. Fore and aft, as well as vertical position (all in the seat coordinate reference system), were variables of the test program. Fore and aft positions used included: spine pressing into the seat back, spine approximately 4 inches off the seat back for the FSS and spine approximately 2 inches off the seat back for all other seats. Vertical positions selected included: buttocks touching the cushion with the cushion uncompressed and buttocks 2 inches off the uncompressed cushion. TEST RESULTS Table 1 contains the initial conditions and the fundamental output data from each of the tests. Early in the program it was determined that pelvic Gz and pelvic displacement would be used for the primary analysis. These values would be the least affected by artifacts and could provide a meaningful basis for comparison. DISCUSSION Ideal restraint for +Gz crash accelerations is a direct coupling of the occupant to the seat bottom, i.e., the ischial tuberosities are essentially in contact with the seat bottom structure. However, this is obviously not practical when comfort during normal operation is considered. To implement comfort, a cushion is added which then introduces a pronounced spring-mass response of the system to vertical crash accelerations. Occupant accelerations in relation to the input will experience at least some degree of amplification by the basic physics of the response of a spring-mass system. Whether the spring characteristics are within the system being tested (the seat bottom cushion), or the test apparatus itself (the rubberized "skin and flesh" of the ATD's pelvis and buttocks), the response of the system results in identifiable dynamic overshoot. This fact was demonstrated throughout the test program. Even the unpadded rigid baseline seat, which isolated all but structural flexion and the ATD compliance , exhibited some dynamic overshoot. In this expected "best-case" scenario, the dynamic overshoot was shown to provide approximately a 30% amplification. Tests with cushioning showed varying results based on specific point design parameters. This data demonstrated that protection from serious injury due to the vertical acceleration need not be totally compromised with the addition of a cushion, but can be addressed with proper cushion and structure design. This confirms the lessons learned in military applications. This test program demonstrated that within the physical constraints of the automotive seating system, bottoming out of the cushion assembly generally can be expected. Two factors cause "bottoming out": either the spring of the system has reached its limit of deflection in its "linear" force/deflection range, or the spring deflection has been limited by the presence of structure under the seat. Deflection characteristics of the structure may also alter the nature of bottoming out. Analysis of the test data shows that the peak response acceleration generally coincides closely with the maximum vertical relative displacement of the ATD, as expected, since these maximums occur as the ATD matches the velocity of the seat system and typically bottoms out. This is illustrated in Figures 2 and 3. The maximum displacement can be considered the point at which the ATD "bottoms out" in the spring-mass system. 1935</page><page sequence="4">TABLE 1.

As seen in Figures 2 and 4, the alternate design seat quickly bottomed the cushion and accelerated the occupant near the outset of the pulse, having limited the relative displacement of the ATD to approximately one inch. By contrast, the FSS and CIS seat occupant in Figures 3 and 4, respectively, encountered contact with seat understructure after a build up of differential velocity of approximately six inches displacement, and achieved coupling of the occupant much later in the pulse. Fore and aft positioning varied the dynamic response characteristics observed. A typical change in response in tests for the FSS seat at an approximate 6G input is shown in Table 1, Tests 1 and 3. With the ATD positioned 4 1/4 inches forward of the normal seated position, overshoot levels decreased as the timing and severity of the bottoming due to the structure was affected (even though the seat recline adjustment connecting rod, which crossed under the cushion, was struck by the cushion in each test). 1936</page><page sequence="5">20.0 -ļ Pelvis Ace. 15.0 - ' /• - s ' .B /• - s ' ' 10.0 - Sled Acc. /Vļ(' //^^ /' Pelvis Disp. öo 5.0 ■ // / &gt;w&gt; łĄr^ J '^X_ / -5.0 J -50 0 50 100 150 200 250 Time (msec) FIGURE 2. Dummy Response in Alternate Design Seat, (Test 12B). Vertical positioning relative to the seat bottom surface was another factor affecting the ATD response. When the ATD was placed initially above the seated surface, an unpredictable amount of energy dissipation occurred. This positioning of the ATD accounted for some of the best and some of the worst dynamic overshoot levels within the test program. As illustrated in Table 1, the CIS, MPV and CSC seat exhibited a dynamic overshoot which dropped off significantly when the ATD was placed 2 inches above the cushion in varied longitudinal positions. However, even the acceleration/time plots of the responses seen in these instances revealed excessive vertical displacements and a delayed peak acceleration. FIGURE 3. Dummy Response in FSS Seat (Test 2B). This suggests that severe bottoming out was avoided only by structural attenuation or the limitations of the input energy. On the other hand, the FSS seat showed increased dynamic overshoot when the ATD was elevated from the seat due to the seat understructure design which remained rigid under load. FIGURE 4: Modified Seat Comparison (Test 10B) to Compact Import Sedan Seat (Test 12A) Overall, each production seat tested showed levels of amplified occupant accelerations into a significant risk-of-injury range within the parameters of this test program during some of the tested positions. Tests of other seated positions revealed excessive excursion but low dynamic overshoot values. The positional sensitivity and lack of occupant motion control could prove dangerous. This means that two people experiencing the same input during the same impact in the same vehicle would have two drastically different responses: one in the risk range and one in the safe range just due to initial position. This inconsistency of production seat performance with different locations on the cushions was alarming. Obviously, consistent response is desired for vertical crash loading to minimize the dynamic overshoot and to remain within a "safe" range for a variety of conditions anticipated in the course of normal seat use. One solution to this problem is a seat bottom design which incorporates a controllable and predictable type of cushion over a consistent seating surface, such as the alternate design concept used in this program. In the limited testing exposure herein, this alternate design seat appeared to have promise for meeting expectations in other test conditions, even though a full complement of testing was not performed in this program. 1937</page><page sequence="6">The design of the alternate design seat bottom incorporated a consistent thickness of rate-sensitive foam over a contoured rigid foam to fill the void in the seating surface. This design is expected to provide uniform response for the ATD within a wide range of initial buttock locations. In this manner, the dynamic overshoot was managed. It is expected that overshoot can be maintained at an acceptable level over a broad spectrum of impact severity and occupant positions. The underlying principle of vehicle occupant protection was not compromised in this application and dynamic overshoot was controlled. To further enhance the alternate design seat, seat belt geometry otpimization and lap-belt slack and control devices should be incorporated to maintain buttock-to-seat coupling. Uncoupling could severely degrade any advantages offered in a seat bottom design. CONCLUSIONS The following conclusions were drawn from an analysis of the test data acquired during this test program: 1. All four production automotive seats demonstrated unmanaged dynamic overshoot and unmanaged bottoming out, even when subjected to input energy levels within the range of safe exposure. This is noted on both the 5th and 50th percentile Hybrid III ATDs as measured in the pelvis. This response, in many instances, raised the acceleration from the "safe" range to the "risk" range, with many tests having a dynamic overshoot exceeding twice the input level. 2. The dynamic overshoot response characteristic of the tested automotive seating systems proved to be positionally sensitive. This appeared to be due mainly to occupant contact with understructure, the response of the understructure and the ability or inability of the occupant to complete the bottoming out within the span of the input pulse. 3. Test results with the alternate design seat bottom clearly demonstrated that ATD dynamic response can be significantly managed (i.e., reduced) by control of seat cushion properties and acceleration response peaks can be maintained in the "safe" range when subjected to exposures within the safe range. RECOMMENDATIONS Automotive seats should be designed to consistently manage the adverse effects on the dynamic response of seated occupants during "slam-down" crash scenarios. Structural, geometric and cushion properties must be considered and verification testing must take place. Occupant-to-seat coupling must not be overlooked.

UNDEFORMED VIEW OF THE CAR-TO-CAR IMPACT FEA MODEL Appropriately refined meshes were introduced for the bumper beam, energy absorbing guide flex, rear rails and connecting brackets in order to adequately transmit applied load from bullet car and to develop crushing mode. The guideflex was modelled using elastic solid elements with a low modulus whereas all other components were modelled as elastic-plastic material with appropriate yield stress. The bullet car, representing a common midsize car, was modeled for the full width of the front half body, power train, front bumper system, hood, front wheels, tires and suspen- sion, with a fine mesh using shell elements. The rear half of the bullet car (rearward of A-pillar) was modelled with a very coarse mesh using shell elements to obtain proper mass distribution. The entire model was constrained at the tire locations in the vertical (Z-) direction only. The simulation was per- formed by impacting the bullet car at 80.4 km/hr to the rear end of the stationary struck vehicle. The analysis was con- ducted only upto 30 ms which was enough to observe the crush mode of the bumper system, the initiation of hinge for- mation in the rear rails, and crushing of bumper to rail connection brackets. A total of 22 sliding surfaces were used to simulate the interaction among various components, namely: bumper with end panel, bumper with bumper con- nections, bumper connections and end panel with rear end of rails, bullet car's front end with struck car's bumper and guide flex, etc. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The simulation was conducted first for two different bumper system configurations for the struck car, namely: (1) steel rear bumper system, (2) Fiber Reinforced Plastic (FRP) composite Structural - Reaction Injection Moulding (S-RIM) rear bumper system. Later a third simulation was conducted with a viable design modification to the composite bumper system by inserting additional high strength metal- lic reinforcement at the tensile flanges of the composite bumper (Fig. 2) for improvement of the rear structure crashworthiness. Since the analysis was conducted only up to 30 ms for the bumper system to sufficiently deform and transmit the load to the rear rails for crush initiation, the struck car was not expected to have any forward movement. With the steel bumper system in the model, the time his- tory deformation modes of the bumper system and the guide flex (Figs. 3, 4) indicate that the rear bumper helps maintain the rear structure integrity. The brackets interfacing the bumper and rear rails (Fig. 3) were noticed to act as cushions Figure 2.
