ISBN o-I9-8I4055-X. ?SS.00. Epic, according to a definition in Servius, consists of divine and human characters. Professor Feeney's disarmingly staid, even stodgy, title, suggests perhaps another of those earnest 'aspect of the epic' anatomizing disquisitions; but, as connoisseurs of F.'s articles might expect, this study of one half of the epicist's world is a work of dazzling and delightful scholarship and criticism. On second reading even that title proves deceptively apt: 'The gods in epic' signals an engagement with the forms of reality or unreality assumed by the supernatural actors in this kind of literature, and a refusal to judge them by the standards of realism or plausibility naturalized in the novel (the attack on 'novelistic prejudice' becomes a refrain). Associated is F.'s treatment of the question of ancient 'belief' in the gods of epic, all too often discussed as a matter of literal credulity or scepticism. A typical example is Gordon Williams'</page><page sequence="2">III. THE EMPIRE 253 allegorical explaining away of the Virgilian gods (see I 34-5); it is curious that such positivistic anxieties about the literal credence lent to epic gods by ancient audiences still linger among students of ancient literature, when students of religion have long since evolved far more sophisticated treatments of religious belief. F.'s remedial insistence on the self-authenticating autonomy of epic's fictions might risk forming too tight a seal between epic and 'reality'; this is certainly avoided in the numerous and luminous discussions, in the chapters on the Roman poets, of the relationship between the emperor's power and epic representation of divine power. The chapter on Apollonius Rhodius, by contrast, operates almost entirely within a Callimachean ivory tower (but see 8o; on the contemporary relevance of themes in the Argonautica see recently R. L. Hunter in 'EAAHNIXMOX. Quelques jalons pour une histoire de l'identite' grecque, 8I-99). More could also have been said on the subject of the cultural authority of epic's representation of the gods, an issue inescapably bound up with the genre from the time that Herodotus stated that Homer and Hesiod had given the gods their names, spheres of activity, and shapes. And further exploration of the dialectic between epic and history might well profit from closer engage- ment with the methods of New Historicism; Hellenistic and Roman imperial epics rewrite the divine power structures of Homer in times of a highly self-conscious elaboration of forms of autocratic power. Representation and power, those constant catchwords of New Historicism, in fact emerge as the two leading themes of a book that is in every respect also characterized by a glorious abundance and variety. The ancient gods, beings both of and not of the human world, raise interesting problems of representation. Who sees them, and in what form? What physical, mental, or abstract realities do they represent, and in what form are they to find literary representation? As poetic fictions the gods force our attention to the nature of the epic poet's authority, of the power of his language to engage our consent to the illusion created, to authenticate. The genre of epic is caught in a nexus of power: in the first place the power of its heroes, who strive to match the power of the gods (in extant ancient epic the Homeric insistence on the ultimately absolute gap between human and divine power will in fact turn out to be the exception rather than the rule). Our belief in the characters, human and divine, is the product of the power of the poet, which according to the poet's own fiction is validated by the power of some of those same poetic gods (Muses or Muse-substitutes). As power surges round the circuit, gods, heroes, and epic poet all tend to become versions of one another; one of F.'s many services is to offer a radiantly lucid and compelling picture of the self-awareness and self-reflexivity of the epic poet that should persuade all but the diehards. Ch. i treats of the ancient critics, above all of Homer. Homer himself is missing; no doubt full treatment of the Homeric gods would have made for an impossibly large task and book, but there remains an untested assumption, challenged by much recent criticism, that there is a qualitative chasm between Homer and 'secondary' epic in such matters as representation and authentication. We begin, then, with an essay in the by now familiar practice of using ancient critical responses to Homer as a guide to the creative practice of later epicists. An expertly economical sketch of the history of allegorizing and rationalizing interpretation, and of Greek approaches to the problems of poetic fiction is followed by a detailed examination of the Homeric scholia; these yield a flexible range of responses to questions of verisimilitude and anthropomorphism, guided by the awareness that answers are inseparable from the generic peculiarities of epic (an implicit rebuke to many modern critics). F. will use these ancient responses as an empirical guide in his own handling of the epic gods, ducking the current theoretical quarrel about the authority of ancient interpretative practice in controlling our own responses to ancient texts. If a general principle emerges from all of this, it is perhaps that of giving the epic gods their due by allowing them the freedom to be 'unreal'. F.'s choice of emphases immediately pays dividends in ch. 2 on Apollonius. Cunning attention to the detail of the text reveals how Homer's Olympian perspective on the Al6Og fouXi becomes dark and 'uncertain' (a key word). Phineus, blinded for his over-exact revelation of the god's will, becomes a figure of the poet when he tells of Zeus' wish that his purpose be veiled from men; in terms of plot this means uncertainty about the TEo; of the story. From Apollonius down to Statius F. will deliver a series of tactfully nuanced analyses of the 'destabilization' of Homeric certainties (again perhaps begging the Homeric question). Apollonius, like the Latin poets, foregrounds the problems of representing gods in epic; persuasively, and unfashionably, the interview in heaven between Hera and Aphrodite at the beginning of Argon. iii is read as a kind of degree zero adherence to Homeric norms against which the strangeness and incomprehensibility of other divine appearances may be measured. The confusion lurking in Homeric anthropomorphism is brilliantly captured in the analysis of Triton's appearance (Argon. iv. i602ff.) 'exactly as he really was to look at', which turns out to be like a man - and like a god, with no external standard to discriminate between the two categories. Uncertainty permeates the epic characters' perception and understanding of the gods: the doubt as to what precisely takes place during Medea's infatuation is focused on linguistic detail, notably the ambivalence between "Eewg/ewg: mythological fiction or psychological realism? Again we are at the beginning of a long tradition, summed up in Nisus' question at Aen. IX. I84-5 'dine hunc ardorem mentibus addunt, I Euryale, an sua cuique deus fit dira cupido', where the last two words escape their speaker's control, since adjective and noun capitalized (ancient texts making no distinction between upper and lower case) both become supernatural</page><page sequence="3">254 REVIEWS beings very active in the epic, Dira and Cupido. The path leads straight to the pyrotechnics of Statius' manipulation of his personifications, well captured by F. in his last chapter. The problem that bedevils Apollonius' characters becomes the narrator's own problem, whose shifting perception of the Muses in this poem - conventional deities subordinate to the poet's voice, or independent divine guarantors of truth? - highlights the question of authentication of the narrative. Thus it is that a study of epic gods brings us to the centre of modern critical discussion of the Argonautica as 'metafiction'. The remaining three quarters of the book are devoted to Latin epic. Ch. 3 prepares the ground, stressing the fact that Greece bequeathed poetry and criticism together, so that Latin epic is from the start self-conscious of its devices and traditions. We are reminded of the primarily social and public nature of Roman religion, whose gods are scarcely implicated in narratives and genealogies; the borrowed gods of Greek myth and poetry are almost inevitably pressed into the service of Roman historical epic. A momentous shift occurs when the Greek Zeus, a god standing above interstate faction, is identified with Jupiter, the god who guides Roman destiny from the Capitol. Henceforth the epic Al6Og 3ouiX will never look the same again. This is a point of startling importance, which, as F. says, seems never to have been given its due weight, although he rightly alludes to the vast gap in our knowledge caused by the total disappearance of Hellenistic epics on Alexander and his successors ('kings are from Zeus', although Zeus might not deign to champion individual Greek cities). Cautious but incisive reconstruction of the role of the gods in the epics of Naevius and Ennius confirms the centrality of the myth-history axis in early Latin epic, and also brings out the great variety of ways of representing and explaining the gods available to poets who superimposed Roman tradition on the already many- layered Greek inheritance. For F. 'the ancients' ability to view a deity as a many-sided prism' (I27, a propos of the Ennian Juno's equivalence to both the Homeric Hera and the Carthaginian Tanit) is a source of poetic liberation rather than confusion (modern disquiet may again be traced to the 'novelistic prejudice' about consistency of action and character; similar points might be made, for example, about the character of Aeneas). The later Latin epicists exploit this plurality to the full, empowered above all by Virgil, the great prestidigitator who seems capable of keeping any number of balls in the air at the same time. And by an easy move, the almost archaeological layering of the gods as they are received into Latin epic provides fertile ground for the propagation of the destabilizing and fracturing tendencies already active in Apollonius' representation of the gods. All the themes of the first three chapters are gathered together and developed in the chapter on the Aeneid. It is a good test of F.'s unflagging invention and penetration that he is able to make so many new points about some of the most familiar passages in ancient literature. The Procrustean reductionism of all too many Virgilian critics is completely superseded by a revelling in the (never chaotic) discontinuity of Virgilian representation and in the fictive energy of the mythical gods. The analysis of the power struggle between Jupiter and Juno conforms with the now prevalent unease about the status of the ending decreed by Jovian fate, on heaven as on earth, with some unexpected revelations about the association of Juno with beginnings (I37-8). The recognition that the end of the poem is more about power and violence than any easy system of morality leads into a discussion of the most powerful - and violent - hero, Hercules, whose career transgresses all categories as he moves between the separate realms of beast, man, and god, the Earthman who visits both Hell and Heaven (with precedent in Apollonius). Narrative indeterminacies are here brutally caught up in the confusions of historical reality. The problem of Hercules is the problem of the Principate: the history of first-century Rome is the history of the attempt to define and channel, make sense of, the unbounded power of the emperor, seesawing wildly between the providential self-command of the god and the uncontrollable raging of the beast. The chapter on the Aeneid ends by examining the representation of how the divine impinges on the human, and the relationship of the poet to his Muse, two areas already shown to be of central concern to Apollonius. The Alexandrian, and specifically Apollonian, qualities of Virgil become more apparent year by year. One might quibble at the claim that the passage on Fama in Aeneid iv is the most self- referential in the poem (I87): Anchises' reaction in the Underworld to the sight of his son, modelled on that of the shade of Homer to the sleeping Ennius in the prologue of the Annals, at least runs it a close second. As we move into the first century A.D. there is an intensification of epic's traditional obsession with the divergence or convergence of men and gods, an area highlighted in recent Homeric criticism both by the structuralist French school and by the more traditional humanist criticism of Jasper Griffin: F. is hospitable to both kinds of approach. Methods of interpreting Greek myths transfer easily to Roman adaptations of those myths (a sign, one might argue, of the profound transformation of Rome by its Greek spoils). The phantasmagoric blur of Ovid's Metamorphoses hovers over a schematic grid of differences and distinctions that are explored in their transgression as men and gods slide through the categories of beast, man, god. The resulting tension between 'the poles of fixity and flux' (I90) is in fact one not peculiar to the Metamorphoses; at a deeper level it corresponds to a tension within the epic genre itself, between the drive to the monumental, timeless fixation of heroic deeds and the unending momentum of narrative process (there is much of relevance here in recent criticism of Renaissance epic: e.g. B. Rajan, The Form of the Unfinished (I985), 8I-2 on the play between pattern</page><page sequence="4">III. THE EMPIRE 255 and flow in The Faerie Queene); this is a tension that Virgil had already exploited in his own epic version of the princeps' attempt to wrest a lasting settlement out of the precipitous events of the end of the Republic. F. brings out the Hesiodic affiliations of the first human metamorphosis in Ovid's epic, that of Lycaon, a story that explores the relationship between beast, man, and god through a narrative of perverted sacrifice. The poem ends with the contemporary apotheoses of Julius Caesar- and of the poet himself - as the poem's span links the earliest Greek attempt to define the place of man in the universe with the latest Roman exercise in redefining that universe through the victorious race's unbounded power. Here F. shifts the focus from Greek myth to Roman religion, and in a series of fine analyses of Metamorphoses xv reveals how the public state religion is appropriated by the individual emperor (Vesta transferred from the Forum to the Palatine, etc.). F. correctly sees this too as a reworking of a Virgilian interest in the 'balance between communal and individual' (2I3), but again is too sanguine about Virgil's success in maintaining that balance (see my 'Augustan poets and the mutability of Rome', in A. Powell (ed.), Roman Poetry and Propaganda in the Age ofAugustus (I992)). F. suggests (2I4 n. 97) that Ovid's final claim that he will be read by the lips of thepeople (Met. xv.878) may be 'a rebuff to Augustus' flawed [i.e. self-appropriating] reading of Ovid's poetry', but there may be a more shocking pretension still on the part of the poet, who alone, in the medium of poetic fame, will enjoy a truly perennial 'apotheosis', the whole history of the world gathered into the power of the one man Ovid (the poem's last word is a first-person singular verb, uiuam). The appropriation of the corporate by the individual is also a central theme of Lucan's epic (286-301), in the form of 'Caesarism'; one of the reasons for the 'absence' of the conventional gods from Lucan is that they are crowded out by an (anti-)hero whose power invades all parts of the cosmos. Two qualifications to F.'s account of Lucan here may be made: (i) here too we see the hypertrophic development of a generic feature of epic, as the expansive, totalizing hero, presses to become the 'one man'. (ii) Caesar's Jovian anger certainly continues an Ovidian theme, but goes back beyond that to the final scene of theAeneid, where the implicit identification of Aeneas in his wrath with the fulminating Jupiter contains the seeds of so much that was to follow. Ovid has always been regarded as a supreme manipulator of fictions, and in the last section on the Metamorphoses (224-49) F. examines Ovid's self-conscious sporting with the suspension of (dis)belief. A continuing critical receptiveness to disjunction and discontinuity allows F. to bring out the dizzy double visions that characterize Ovid's representation of the gods (Achelous is simultaneously a cheery anthropomorphic host and a raging flood). This prepares the ground for an analysis of that type of supernatural representation that overtly challenges the simple-minded to a one-dimensional reductionist reading, personification allegory; F.'s account of Ovid's Invidia and Fama shows the powerful resources of fantasy and punning play drawn on by Ovid in this mode that wavers between the abstract and the corporeal. The interpretative gains are consolidated and extended in the treatment of Statian personification (364-89): elaborating on C. S. Lewis' classic discussion of the historical evolution of personification F. reveals how Statius' usage functions as a self-conscious and playful commentary on the tendency of epic gods to the abstract (365 'a power-struggle among alternative narrative modes'). Statius is always on top of what might seem to be the constrictions of the mode: the inappropriateness of a female deity embodying the very masculine notion of Vir-tus is exploited, as she dons an even more feminine garb to point up the contradictions of the 'realistic' narrative; one might add that the ambiguity of Virtus also corresponds to the liminal status of Menoeceus, a boy poised between a girl-like boyhood and true manhood (Statius' favourite intensification of the Virgilian type of the doomed Heldenknabe, exemplified also in Parthenopaeus and the youthful hero of the fragmentary Achilleid). Ch. 6 on Lucan begins with a discussion of ancient conceptions of 'history' and 'myth', usefully drawing on recent relativizations of the status of 'truth' in ancient historiography, before moving on to a survey of the evidence for the expected presence of divine machinery in historical epic. The notion that Lucan dispensed with the gods because a sophisticated audience would have found them implausible in an epic on relatively recent Roman history turns out to be a modern prejudice. Lucan's unusual decision is then to be seen within an ancient horizon of expectation that a historical epic would employ the full range of divine machinery; the absence of the gods is a constant 'presence' within the text. Lucan goes out of his way to make this an issue in the apparition of Patria to Caesar at the very opening of the narrative (Bell. Ciu. i.i85-90) - dream or waking vision, goddess or personification? There is an analogy (at least) with the epiphany of Venus at the beginning of Lucretius'De rerum natura, a passage that sets us up for the complex dialectic between religion and irreligion that permeates the didactic poem. The Bellum Ciuile by its practice continually forces on the reader Lucan's unwillingness and inability to deliver the traditional divine perspective on events that are 'unspeakable' (the punning replacement of Fata, the traditional subject of the omniscient poet, by nefas is central, 276), and in which as a Roman citizen he is too closely implicated to stand outside in an Olympian detachment. It is interesting to note that one of the few places where Virgil anticipates, on a small scale, Lucan's gran riftuto is in a passage where Aeneas' attempt to prevent what in effect is civil war (Aen. XII.313 'quo ruitis? quaeue ista repens discordia surgit?', words that echo Epode I 7 and in turn are echoed by Lucan) is frustrated by an arrow- shot, of which the narrator is unable to give an account, Aen. XII.320-2 'incertum qua pulsa manu, quo</page><page sequence="5">256 REVIEWS turbine adacta, I quis tantam Rutulis laudem, casusne deusne, I attulerit.' In Lucan 'the dilemmas of fiction, and of the poet's authority' (274) are inseparable from the contradictions and illegitimacy of a civil war that infects everything, including the poet's voice. F.'s musings should be read together with the recent work of Masters, Henderson, and O'Higgins, which in some ways take the discussion considerably further. A new orthodoxy on Lucan is on the point of emerging, and not before time. In his discussion of Statius, however, F. is ahead of the field; this, together with John Henderson's new (and very different) essay in PCPhS 37 (I99I), 30-79, should finally dispel any doubt that the Thebaid is a very considerable, even great, epic. With a nod in the direction of Harold Bloom F. shows just how 'Statius confronts his belatedness head-on' (340), in his own way as skilful an ironist in the use of tradition as Virgil or Ovid. His use of the gods, as analysed by F., might be described as a combination of the mapping, categorizing instinct of Ovid (as described earlier in the book) with Lucan's exploration of the radical confusion of categories, with a strong dash of Seneca, but this would be to betray the unmistakably Statian quality as this is all translated back into the divine action of a traditional, Homeric kind of mythological epic. Heaven, Earth, and Hell are the theatre for a divine power struggle that destabilizes the disposition of the original casting of lots by the great gods. F. talks in terms of 'arrogation' or 'appropriation' of the roles of the Olympians by the infernal gods, and vice versa; the confusion is in fact more radical still, amounting to a total indistinguishability (and this one might in any case expect from a poet writing on a 'civil war' after Lucan). F. also lays insufficient emphasis on the Virgilian roots of the Statian confusions: again we have to do with an unfolding of the implications of the last scenes of theAeneid, where the boundaries of the universe are transgressed as Jupiter sends down(!) a Dira, and the celestial Jupiter's infernal design is embodied in human action as Aeneas blasts Turnus. F. well shows how the gods eventually retire from the action of the Thebaid, firstly Jupiter in Book xi, and finally even the Furies as the brothers square up for the final fratricidal duel. The last divinity is a personification without a person, Clementia, a virtue with no body other than the individual human heart (390). F. notes that even in this there is not the degree of closure that is found in the Iliad's final (if temporary) triumph of the weak forces of humanity, but he isolates too simply the humanity of Theseus, an epic equivalent of a tragic deus ex machina. It may be true that the simile at XII. 650-5 comparing him to Jupiter works to disjoin human and divine, in contrast to the implicit identification of Aeneas' final fury with Jupiter's purpose in theAeneid, but just how 'human(e)' is Theseus? At 71 I-4, as he enters the final battle, 'desilit in campum, qui subter moenia nudos I adseruat manes, dirisque uaporibus aegrum | aera puluerea penitus sub casside ducens I ingemit et iustas belli flammatur in iras'. The Underworld returns. Thebes was always the last place to look for a humanity that did not risk confusion with bestiality, infernality, or divinity. There remain Valerius Flaccus and Silius Italicus. The former receives a proxime accessit after Statius in ch. 7 ('Epic of Myth'). F. convincingly describes (3 I4-37) a poet of impressive and intelligent self-awareness, working independently and effectively to explore through the story of the Argo the by now familiar areas of poetic authority, self-reflexivity, and the nature and limits of the Jovian/imperial dispensation: handsome and detailed rehabilitation, indeed. Silius figures as an appendage to Lucan in the chapter on 'Epic of History' (30I-I2), allowed a degree of intelligence and even wit, only to be pushed finally into his accustomed outer darkness as a sterile bungler. Where the other epicists create rich patterns of indeterminacy, Silius 'oscillate[s] meaninglessly' (307). Perhaps there always has to be a wooden spoon; my own experience in allowing Silius a chance on the same terms as, say, Valerius and Statius has been far more positive and even enjoyable (see my forthcoming The Epic Successors of Virgil). F. knows Silius probably better than anyone, but I confess to some disappointment at the perpetuation in Silius' case of the evaluative condemnation that has so long been the lot of all 'Silver' epic. That misrepresentation aside, this is in every way a remarkable book that confirms F. as a critic of unusual power and authority; above all it is a landmark in the study of Latin epic (not least because it demonstrates the important continuities with the critical concerns of Classical and Hellenistic Greece). F. combines the traditional skills of the classicist with the insights of literary theory, in a work of a muscular and supple intelligence that deserves the widest readership.
