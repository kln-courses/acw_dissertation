<plain_text><page sequence="1">C. WRIGHT MILLS AND THE POLITICS OF TRUTH: THE POWER ELITE REVISITED RICHARD GILLAM Palo Alto, California IT IS NOW ALMOST TWO DECADES SINCE C. WRIGHT MILLS PUBLISHED The Power Elite. Few books of its kind have been more widely read or more vigorously debated; fewer yet have retained so much urgent relevancy for so long a time. The Power Elite raised questions of enduring importance, and it gave answers that still provoke considerable disagreement. But if the book has not yet lost its controversial immediacy, it has also, subtly and by degrees, won a measure of popular acceptance. Certain of Mills's argu- ments that most thought heretical and wrong in 1956 that power is con- centrated and oppressive, that a mass society is emerging in America, that liberal theory is outmoded-today seem not only familiar but accurate as well. Over the years the book has become almost respectable. Only an un- generous critic could now deny The Power Elite a central place in the in- tellectual history of our age. ' My purpose here is not to "test" the power elite thesis yet another time. This task is best left to disciplinary specialists who can explore Mills's hypothesis with the empirical tools of the social sciences. I propose instead to place The Power Elite in its historical context; to consider the volume in terms of the general "reorientation" of American social thought after 1940; to assess Mills's contribution in this book as one of "sensibility" as well as of "theory"; to explore certain ambiguities of analysis; and along the way to relate the book more closely than has yet been done to the personality of the 'Convenient surveys of the argument over The Power Elite may be found in G. William Domhoff and Hoyt Ballard, eds., C. Wright Mills and The Power Elite (Boston: Beacon, 1968), in Richard Gillam, ed., Power in Postwar America (Boston: Little, Brown, 1971), and in John A. Warner, "The Critics of C. Wright Mills: Ideology and the Study of Political Power in America," Diss. Princeton 1972. A splendid example of Mills interpretation-and an in- dication of the recent interest in the man and his work-is Peter Clecak's overall assessment in Radical Paradoxes: Dilemmas of the American Left, 1945-1970 (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1973), pp. 31-71.</page><page sequence="2">462 American Quarterly man who wrote it. Perhaps an examination of this sort will also help further to define the sources of appeal and overall achievements of this important example of American social criticism. * * * Today The Power Elite merits another look because it bears directly on the "reorientation" of American thought that began with the collapse of the Progressive synthesis around 1940 and that gained momentum after World War II. Recent scholars have perceived a change in American liberalism from its earlier Progressive variation into a new form that has been called "vital center," "cold war," "counterprogressive," or, simply, "new" liberalism. Where the insurgent liberalism of prewar years had emphasized human perfectibility and the inevitability of progress, postwar liberalism cautiously stressed ambiguity, paradox, and human limitation. In this new worldview, innocent optimism gave way to "pessimism, evil, tragedy, and despair." Despite their sober view of human potentiality, however, new liberals advanced a benevolent theory of American politics. The United States seemed to them an exceptionalist nation virtuously free of "foreign" or "totalitarian" vices of ideology and class conflict. New liberals portrayed America as a consensual, happily pragmatic society in which power was balanced, pluralistic-a "resource" as Talcott Parsons put it. If a few of these thinkers feared the mob passions of a "mass society," others stressed instead the vitality, strength, and folksy "genius" of "Our Country and Our Culture." In some respects, then, the new liberalism proved an accepting creed; it affirmed what was, to the neglect of what might yet be.2 In opposition to this theory, however, there also began to emerge in the 1940s a countervailing tendency in American thought. This opposing theoretical impulse may be called the "new radicalism," a term I use to describe a strain of revisionism that, much like the new liberalism, 2Daniel Bell, The End of Ideology (New York: The Free Press, 1960; Collier edition, 1962), p. 300.

Wright Mills and the Politics of Truth 463 was born of the failure of a past tradition-in this case of the old Marxist, or neo-Marxist radicalism of the 1930s. Its first stirrings were evident among those intellectual dissenters of the 1940s who took their lead from Dwight Macdonald's antiwar periodical Politics. Unlike its liberal counter- part, the new radicalism never hardened into one dominant and the- oretically coherent form. Yet in all its manifestations this critical impulse has had a number of defining and interrelated purposes: to find new in- tellectual heroes to replace or to modify Marx; to oppose liberal affirmation with radical subversion; to reject present reality in the name of future liberation. One variant of new radical thought has won considerable scholarly atten- tion. Historians now commonly speak of a "Freudian left" (or "Party of Eros") that sees revolutionary potential in the release of sexual instincts. The work of Wilhelm Reich, Paul Goodman, Norman 0. Brown, and Herbert Marcuse (of Eros and Civilization) represents this viewpoint. Yet there also exists a second tendency within the new radicalism that remains more obs6ure. Highly intellectualistic in nature, this alternative analysis puts its faith in reason, not in biology, as the salvation of humanity. Freudian leftists might speak of a politics of sex, but rationalistic radicals have referred instead to a liberating "Politics of Truth." These latter critics have believed, simply, that reason has a subversive power of its own; that ideas count; that it is possible to think one's way out of trouble. Radicals of this persuasion have occasionally gone on to claim that intellectuals, as the oracles of reason, are themselves agents of change potentially able to suc- ceed where Marx's proletariat had failed. Dwight Macdonald, William Ap- pleman Williams, Herbert Marcuse (of "the Great Refusal"), and perhaps Noam Chomsky are among those who at one time or another have cham- pioned such rationalistic beliefs. Above all, however, this brand of new radi- calism can be identified with C. Wright Mills.4 Indeed Mills was the major prophet of an intellectualistic new radicalism in America from the mid-1940s to his death in 1962. Despite a debt to the old political theory of Progressivism, Mill's ideas were in some aspects also 3My definition of the "new radicalism" differs from that of Christopher Lasch in The New Radicalism in America: The Intellectual as a Social Type (New York: Knopf, 1965), esp. pp. ix, xiv-xv. 40n the Freudian left see especially Paul Robinson, The Freudian Left (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1969), and Richard King, The Party of Eros (Chapel Hill: Univ. of North Carolina Press, 1972). Mills discusses the importance of a Politics of Truth to his own work in "A Per- sonal Note to the Reader" (introduction to The Cultural Apparatus), box 378 University of Texas ms [hereafter cited as UT]. The two tendencies within new radical thought are not necessarily antagonistic-though they would remain so in Mills's work-and such thinkers as Macdonald and Marcuse have on occasion championed both rationalistic and "sexual" radi- calism.</page><page sequence="4">464 American Quarterly "new," "radical," and exceptionally rationalistic. The Power Elite therefore bears especially close examination, for it tends to define the author's contribution to new radical thought. In the book one finds those original theses about power, mass society, and the "politics of intellect" for which Mills is best known. One also finds other qualities typical of his thought: the theoretical strengths and weaknesses, the strident polemicism, the defining sensibility, the overriding effort to stand new liberal analysis on its head. Attention to authorial temperament and biography suggests that the savagely anti-new liberal impulse of The Power Elite had important per- sonal (as well as intellectual) roots. Mills was an uncommonly combative man much given, in correspondence and conversation, to war-whooping assaults on the "shits" and "crap artists" whom he opposed. For him all politics were personal politics, all intellectual battles were personal battles. This highly personalized spirit of pugnacity pervades The Power Elite. Much of the book, in fact, represents a direct attack on just those liberal thinkers at Columbia University among whom Mills spent his professional life. Always something of a headhunter, Mills liked nothing better than to take his trophies from the bodies of opponents he had stalked personally on Morningside Heights-preferably in the familiar corridors of Fayerweather or Hamilton Halls. A remarkable number of his chosen antagonists thus came from his own university, which after World War II had become a hotbed of new liberal analysis. Mills's work bears an adversarial relation to that of such Columbia academics as David Truman, Daniel Bell, Seymour Martin Lipset, Jacques Barzun, Lionel Trilling, Charles Frankel (with whom Mills once taught a seminar on "Liberalism"), Richard Hofstadter, and, across the street at Union Theological Seminary, even Reinhold Niebuhr himself. Whatever he might think of these men personally-and a few such as Frankel and Hofstadter were his friends-Mills attacked them intellectually with a special ferocity reserved for opponents taken on at close quarters. For this reason the would-be debate between Mills's new radicalism on one side and the new liberalism on the other often escalated, like many familial squabbles, into fratricidal warfare. Just so, The Power Elite trades in life-and-death argument; it goes directly for the jugular. The book also reflects the external perspective of a habitual loner who remained warily outside all groups, claiming to understand "liberty" and "equality" but not "fraternity."' At odds with the academic culture of Columbia, Mills likewise stood apart from the larger intellectual culture of New York City. After 1945 he lived in close contact with "The New York Intellectuals," that "herd of independent minds" whose members tended to define the major premises of national thought and culture in the postwar pe-</page><page sequence="5">C. Wright Mills and the Politics of Truth 465 riod. But Mills, feeling himself "out of joint," "intellectually, politically, morally alone," never shared in the collective experience of this intellectual establishment and naturally revolted against it. The Power Elite is, accord- ingly, the renegade expression of a man who saw the intellectual life of New York and the nation, as he saw life generally, from "outside the whale."5 Considered at a higher level of generalization, moreover, this volume can be seen to express a distinctive psychological orientation. The shaping con- sciousness of The Power Elite is obsessed by violence, holocaust, the imper- sonal technology of destruction. It is a consciousness formed largely in reaction to the unprecedented horrors of World War II. This war-born sen- sibility the Millsian sensibility-is that of a "survivor" who has witnessed death and destruction on an inhuman scale and has emerged from this experience with a new view of reality. Focusing on the effects of collective violence, this "survivor" formulation resembles that used by such scholars as Robert Jay Lifton to describe the human remnants of Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and the death camps. As applied to Mills, however, the "sur- vivor" concept makes a specific and modest point: World War II, the great instance of mid-century violence, shaped the Millsian sensibility "down deep and for good" (as he put it himself)6. Of course most intellectuals of the 1940s reacted to the grisliness of total war. Yet Mills's response deserves its own label. Thinkers of the war years had usually had some previous political involvement with the "old left" disputes of the Thirties; by 1940 many could count themselves, with Daniel Bell, as "veteran[s] of many factional wars." But Mills missed the radical experience of the 1930s almost completely ("I just didn't get its mood") and thus, unlike most of his contemporaries, came to political consciousness for the first time during World War II. In the 1940s, moreover, the over- whelming majority of intellectuals either moved to the right politically or stuck grimly to the middle of the road. By contrast, Mills discovered ideology and moved left. For him the war catalyzed a sudden "awakening" 5,Irving Howe, "On the Career and Example of C.

Virtually alone of his generation, Mills could write that "following [World War II] closely and thinking about it made me a radical."7 During the 1940s Mills developed the violently traumatized vocabulary so central to his later work: "inhuman," "monstrous," "irrational" became key terms. His prose style came to depend as well on military and mechanical metaphor, on the imagery of great size, force, violence, to describe a world spinning crazily out of rational control. Mills's great obsession with power also emerged during these years. His first reference to "power elites," for example, appeared in an unpublished essay fragment written in 1941 just as the war was about to engulf America. Thereafter the concept of power as domination haunted him persistently. Intellectually and psychologically, then, Mills was a survivor-the child of mid-century cataclysm. And The Power Elite can be understood as a work of survivor- hood. It represents one man's attempt to make sense of a new and mon- strous world broken off, as if history itself had split in two, from the secure moorings of a simpler past.8 This analysis illuminates Mills's strongly Manichean mind. He saw reality sharply in either-or terms. The Power Elite perfectly expresses this Promethean worldview in its dualistic perception of power as an elite-mass phenomenon. The argument gains force from its apparent simplicity; it seems to assert boldly without qualification. Yet a caveat must be entered. One should not emphasize the for-and-against extremity of Mills's theory to the complete neglect of the genuine complexity and uncertainty apparent at times in both the man and his work. Even The Power Elite is more equivocal than most critics have realized. Mills feared power, and this emo- tion dominates The Power Elite. Yet he also desired and sought power. The hope of reunifying "Knowledge and Power" (the title of an important essay) pervades all his work, and he always wanted, as William Miller has written, "to use [power] as he understood it." Moreover, Mills sometimes seemed to envy, even secretly to respect, the elites he feared. In 1954, for example, he flew as a bedazzled civilian passenger aboard a military jet put at his dis- posal to the Air War College in Alabama where he addressed a group of "warlords" in the manner of a policy intellectual counseling an old and valued client: he was invited back. These and other conflicting attitudes 7Bell, op. cit., p. 299. Mills, Tovarich, op. cit., Letter Five, p. 10. To put the argument another way, the concept of survivorhood suggests that Mills was a "once-born" radical of the war years. He thus escaped the burden of a guilty past that weighed down those deconverted or "twice-born" thinkers-ex-radicals of the 1930s-who defined the major premises of new liberal thought in the 1940s and 1950s. 8Mills, "Methodological Consequences: Three Problems for Pathologists," p. 34, in box 360 UT.</page><page sequence="7">C. Wright Mills and the Politics of Truth 467 toward power are all present in The Power Elite. The book shows the contradictions of complex personal feelings.9 This preliminary discussion suggests a final point about The Power Elite. This deeply personal book appeals to the emotions as well as the intellect. One responds not just to the theory but also to the author whose presence- moral and political-seems to animate his argument. Mills emerges from this work as one of those exemplary "figures" who, Lionel Trilling has writ- ten, ". . . live their visions as well as write them, who are what they write, whom we think of as standing for something because of what they have writ- ten in their books." The Power Elite thus illustrates why Richard Hofstadter should have conceived of Mills, in just this sense, as a "figure" whose work "was undertaken as a kind of devotional exercise, a personal discipline" and gained "a kind of primary moral significance." It suggests, too, why the idealistic Tom Hayden, speaking in 1961 for an awakening generation, should have pointed to Mills as one of three "figures" over thirty still trusted by the young. The Power Elite becomes important, then, not only for whatever analytical truth it may possess but also for its moral evocation, in Trilling's words, "of the man who tells the truth." '0 * * * The Power Elite has the look of a work hammered together quickly and then rushed to press with the finishing touches left undone. It is awkward, prolix, rough edges stick out everywhere, and there are leavings of old arti- cles stuffed, impatiently it seems, into ill-fitting place. The signs suggest hell-bent haste. Yet such appearances are deceiving. Mills did write most of The Power Elite in a two-year burst between 1953 and 1955, but this was after years of research had already gone into the book. He put the volume through several revisions, moreover, sweating out each one and periodically fighting off depressions, "my fall downfall, the old Untergang," that made work an agony. This masterwork was not then tossed off carelessly at the bat of an eye. 1 'William Miller to author, June 27, 1966; Mills, "The Growth of Administrative Structures and the Modern State" (transcript of Air War College talk), in PE Update file, UT; Leland to Mills, June 28, 1955, in ibid.; Mills to parents, n.d., RG [all privately-obtained material now in the author's possession is cited as RG].

He defensively went so far as to send his publisher a list of potential critics who were not to see the book before publication and whose opinion, he insisted with less than total conviction, he did not care about. Those proscribed included the Time magazine circle; Partisan Review people; David Riesman, Lionel Trilling, Jacques Barzun "and type"; Commentary contributors; and Columbia academics. The doubts that inspired this enemies list could only have in- creased in mid-1955 when two of Oxford's three pre-publication readers proved ambivalent about the book and the third sent back a negative report scalding enough, in Norman Mailer's phrase, to boil the fat off a New York hackie's neck. In response to such "carping about the surface," the irate author raised a battle cry whose defiant echo would persist in his book: He was "tired of the bullshit." 12 Mills continued to revise "rather ruthlessly" until late 1955 when he finally had to release what to him still seemed an imperfect manuscript. With matters out of his hands, he found himself ambivalently predicting on one side that no one would read the book and, on the other, that it would be "a little bit of a pivot" and, grandiosely, that it might influence the outcome of the 1956 Presidential campaign. In this uncertain state of expectancy Mills saw the publication of The Power Elite-a title selected only at the last moment-in the spring of 1956.13 In The Power Elite Mills is invariably drawn to those invidious elite deci- sions that are violent-to the entry into war, to the dropping of the atomic bomb, to foreign policy in its military dimension. The book deals with power, and the ultimate kind of power for Mills, as for Weber, is violence. The Power Elite obsessively warns that warfare, itself the ultimate kind of violence, has become "the only reality, that is to say, the necessity of our time." Mills further insists that the very time when he himself first awoke politically during World War II was also the pivotal moment when the United States entered the new epoch of the power elite. In this way he identifies his own radical conversion with nothing less than a turning point "in the world history of mankind." And Mills believes that in this new epoch the world must be seen through radically new eyes, for it is a world built of huge mechanical parts, a bureaucratic and oppressive world in which power 12CWM to Oman, November 9, 1954, OUP; CWM to Oman, April 23, 1955, OUP; reports of readers 1 (Claiborne Pell), 2 (James Reston), and 3 (Eric Hodgins), OUP; CWM to Grove, June 10, 1955, OUP; CWM to Harvey [Swados], n.d.

Wright Mills and the Politics of Truth 469 has become a decisive factor. Here, patently, the revelatory consciousness of a survivor is at work.'4 The Power Elite gathers momentum slowly. After a few nostalgic glances backward at the disappearing past and some digressive comments on "the world of the celebrity," Mills gets down to business about one-third of the way through his book. Here he advances in detail the famous proposition that a new structure of power had emerged from the crucible of war. In contemporary America power derives increasingly from three dominant in- stitutional orders or "domains." The "higher circles"-the "corporate rich," the "warlords," and the "political directorate"-controlling these economic, military, and political orders thus command power unique in American history. These three circles or "elites" now tend to operate together for the same ends rather than in isolation. This idea of elite coordi- nation is not, Mills insists, equivalent to a "conspiracy theory" of history. The bond among elites is that of common background, psychology, institu- tional interests, and only occasionally that of "explicit coordination" fash- ioned in conspiratorial secrecy. Mills ultimately finds it possible to speak of a unified "power elite," composed of "circles" and "overlapping cliques" whose members decide "whatever is decided of major consequence." "In so far as national events are decided," he writes, "the power elite are those who decide them." He does not bother, as his critics have unfailingly noted, to examine a single such decision in detail. Yet Mills's uncomplicated moral vocabulary makes his own negative judgment clear: the power elite is "ir- responsible," "secretive," "oppressive," and its decisions exploitative. Thus, the High and the Mighty inevitably promote domination and diminish freedom. 15 At the bottom of the social hierarchy lies the "mass society," which Mills briefly describes in his final chapters. Powerless, disorganized, and manipu- lated, the quiescent "mass" is replacing the active "public." Mills is careful to say that the United States has not yet arrived at the anti-utopian state of a society composed exclusively of masters at the top and victims at the bot- tom. Yet he leaves no doubt that this outcome is inevitable if history continues to "drift" in its present direction. To this extent The Power Elite foresees the extinction of reason and freedom in a world dominated by the powerful few at the expense of the powerless many. This vision of mass so- ciety, it should be emphasized, differs from that of both conservatives and new liberals. Unlike Jose Ortega y Gasset and his American disciples, for example, Mills does not mainly emphasize the threats of the democratic mass to a hierarchical ideal. Nor does he, like the representative new liberal 14The Power Elite (New York: Oxford Univ. Press, 1956) [hereafter cited as PE], pp. 171, 22, 184, 185, 201, 28, 275, 25. Cf. Bell, op. cit., p. 54.

Instead Mills assails the oppressive elite that he thinks has reduced free citizens to mass apathy and calls for the transformation of manipulated masses into resis- tant "publics" that will be at once ideological and radical.16 Mills concentrates on the demolition of new liberal theory. It is in thinking against this particular orthodoxy, in fact, that he is at his best. He peppers the new (and sometimes old) liberal opposition with critical left jabs: Schumpeter, Burnham, Berle and Means, "Tocqueville-quoting Americans" in general, and even Veblen take their lumps in this way. In the antiliberal chapter "The Theory of Balance" he gleefully aims more powerful haymakers at Riesman, Galbraith, David Truman, and those other "balancing boys" whose "romantic" obsession with the semi- organized stalemate at the middle levels of power had blinded them to domination at the top. Mills also suggests that the liberal fascination with the evils of McCarthyism was diversionary insofar as it caused many to ig- nore the real villains of the post-war era who comprise the power elite. The basic difference is that liberals of the 1950s tended to equate power with stability and security, whereas Mills identifies power in its modem form as an engine of domination. With such reversals of conventional perspectives, The Power Elite becomes the stuff of liberal nightmares. 17 Mills's unfashionable antiliberalism helps to explain a charge commonly brought against The Power Elite-namely, that the book is guilty of the sin, unpardonable in the cold war era, of applying "foreign" theory to an excep- tional (and liberal) American reality. It is true, of course, that Mills bor- rows from European sources. His analysis of power in terms of domains or orders derives from Weber; his concept of a tripartite elite of power comes (in modified form) out of Franz Neumann's classic analysis of Nazi Germany Behemoth; his "elite" notion shows some further affinity with the analyses of Mosca, Michels, and even Pareto; and the exceptional ra- tionalism of his analysis probably owes something to the "critical theory" of the Frankfurt School. To criticize The Power Elite for such usage of "Eu- ropean" insight, however, now seems at once chauvinistic and misguided. The exceptionalist assumptions of the cold war era have eroded with time so that today The Power Elite is likely to seem remarkable precisely because it 16Ibid., ch. 12, esp. p. 309. Cf. Daniel Bell, ed., The New American Right (New York: Crite- rion Books, 1955); Joseph Gusfield, "Mass Society and Extremist Politics," American Socio- logical Review, 27 (1962), pp. 19-30. 17PE, ch. 1 1, pp. 88-91, 270. Mills actually accepts-indeed in White Collar he anticipated- the "status anxiety" interpretation of McCarthyism advanced in The New American Right. But by attacking elites and not masses he pushes this insight in radical as opposed to new liberal directions. Cf. E. P. Thompson, "C.

Wright Mills and the Politics of Truth 471 sometimes views American facts against a background of European theory. 18 Yet the exceptionalist critique of The Power Elite also misses the mark for the more important reason that it greatly overestimates the alien character of Mills's analysis. Despite his fondness for certain non- American theorists, Mills often shows the provincial's home-grown distrust of European exotica. Time and again The Power Elite reveals the author's aversion to European metaphysics; the investigation is far more volun- taristic and open-ended than those pursued by such gloomy prophets of inevitability as Marx, Weber, and Pareto. In a notorious footnote, moreover, Mills explicitly rejects the Marxian "ruling class" concept be- cause it incorporates a "short cut" assertion of "economic determinism." Later he would rightly insist that The Power Elite was anti-Marxist as well as antiliberal. Even the elite-mass formulation that Mills advances in place of Marx's ruling class-proletariat dichotomy is not so "un-American" in its theoretical roots as one might at first assume. His understanding of mass society owes much to Walter Lippmann's analyses of the 1920s; and his "power elite" concept likewise seems rather more indebted to the argu- ments of Harold Lasswell than to those of Mosca or Pareto. Indeed "the power elite" is only the most memorable of several terms used to describe a ruling group that Mills had originally (and perhaps more accurately) labelled "the High and the Mighty." In fact Mills's apparently foreign idiom of "elites" and "masses" often gives way to an expressly American dialect that employs such synonyms as "cliques," "crowds," "decision-" or "opinion-makers," and "phantom" publics.'9 The Power Elite also draws on American thought in its basic assump- tions. If Mills means to fashion a "new" and "radical" theory of modernity, he labors at the same time to found his innovations on the bedrock of an in- digenous critical tradition. Attempting to refute the new liberalism in its own terms, he turns to those very Progressive critics against whom new liberals had revolted and whom they seemed prepared in the mid-1950s to "8Critiques of The Power Elite based in some degree on exceptionalist-and usually on new liberal-assumptions include: those of Richard Rovere, Talcott Parsons, Adolph A.

The negation of 1950s liberalism therefore leads to a qualified affirmation of Progressivism. A simple check of citations reveals The Power Elite's indebtedness to the Progressive- muckraking canon. Mills constantly acknowledges, even when criticizing, the work of Progressive and neo-Progressive scholars such as Veblen, Gus- tavus Meyers, Ferdinand Lundberg, Matthew Josephson, Bruce Catton, and Floyd Hunter. Often he revives Progressive terminology to identify his villains, as when he writes of the "robber barons," the "titans" of high finance, the "lords of creation," or the "warlords." Mills's chapter on "The Very Rich" illustrates the muckraking con- nection with particular clarity. Not only does it build upon such typically Progressive works as Meyers's The History of Great American Fortunes, it also draws on contemporary data supplied by Mills's maverick and Progressive-minded friend-the lifelong enemy of corporate concen- tration-John Blair of the Federal Trade Commission. This important chapter further reflects the conviction, identified with the Beardian wing of Progressivism, that the underside of life at the top, and in particular the economic underside, is rough, sordid, reprehensible. "Money-sheer, naked, vulgar money," Mills snidely exclaims at one point in the book. Like so much Progressive scholarship, The Power Elite is an expose based on the methodological premise that an indirect analysis of social origins, career- lines, and economic interests will reveal the corrupt nastiness of power.20 In good muckraking fashion, moreover, Mills often spices up his scholar- ship with journalistic touches. The Power Elite bases many of its conclu- sions on facts taken from the pages of Fortune, Business Week (Mills's fa- vorite periodical), Time, The Reporter, and other everyday sources. For all its theorizing, The Power Elite also has the empirical strengths of a book that aims, in a way familiar to past generations of Progressive critics, to ex- pose reality through the relentless accumulation of data. In thus dealing with "catchpenny realities" as well as "transcendent theory," The Power Elite shows the journalistic imprint of Progressive social science.2' This sympathetic affinity with some aspects of the Progressive synthesis also extends to the habit of mind and view of reality that inform The Power Elite. Rejecting the new liberal vision of a dialectical and ambiguous world, Mills is drawn instead to the old Progressive view of reality (and of power) as simple, bipolar, and marked by clear-cut divisions between the haves and the have-nots. He writes polemically in a deliberately extreme and judg- 20PE, pp. 50, 94-117. Cf. correspondence in box 375 UT.

Sometimes (despite his protests to the contrary) Mills verges on the sort of "conspiratorial" interpretation of the powerful that Hofstadter, among others, has linked to the "muckraking model of thought." His outlook, like that of the Progressives, is negative and highly suspicious. The Power Elite becomes, then, a study in villainy of a sort not much favored by new liberal theorists of postwar consensus.22 The Power Elite is also shaped by an essentially individualistic and par- ticular imagination resembling that which animated the muckraking mind. Mills attends to structural-institutional analysis and claims not to deal with individuals but with "psychological types." Yet he finds it necessary, time and again, to boil down his assessment into specific terms. Like that model Progressive thinker Vernon Louis Parrington, who developed every analysis from one pungent phrase, Mills constantly searches in The Power Elite for the simple label that will give focus to complicated propositions. What he liked to call "slogunizing" [sic] phrases such as "the higher immorality," the "conservative mood," the "mass society," or indeed any of the colorful chapter titles of The Power Elite, define and intensify ideas in just this way. Mills expresses the general and abstract in particular and human terms.23 What is more-and this has often been missed-Mills's imagination is anthropomorphic and visual. He puts a personal and often a specifically in- dividual face on the specter of power. At times Mills refers, significantly, not to the "structure" of power but to "the men of the circles composing this [power] elite," to the men "who now make such key decisions as are made." His drive to visualize and to see power as a human enemy is per- fectly illustrated by certain photographs that Mills once proposed to use in his book: the famous shot of General Douglas MacArthur striding ashore on Leyte during the reoccupation of the Philippines in 1944 was to introduce his chapter on "the Warlords"; a picture of two business executives and members of the Eisenhower Cabinet, George Humphrey and Charles Wilson, "skeet shooting or on horseback" was to illustrate a proposed chapter on "The Managerial Elite"; a depiction of four men-three of them pointedly identified as Charles Frankel, Richard Hofstadter, and Mills himself-engaged in "very active" debate was to preface a chapter on com- peting theories of power; and elsewhere in the book photographs of such wildly-varied types as Walter Winchell, Marilyn Monroe, and King Farouk of Egypt were to dramatize other facets of Mills's argument.24 From this rogues gallery of villainy and seduction only a cover photograph of the three types of hats worn by Mills's economic, military, 22Cf.

Yet even this tame representation of power through the symbolism of dress points to the tendency, everywhere apparent in The Power Elite, to visualize power in terms of flesh-and-blood antagonists. Indeed Mills's "images" (one of his favorite words) of warlords, corporate chieftains, and political outsiders re- call those old Thomas Nast or Art Young cartoons depicting bloated pluto- crats and corrupt politicians. Creating a demonology of the powerful that is also visual and personal, The Power Elite likewise works forcefully on the emotions of its readers in a way that straightforward exegesis alone could not. To the extent that the book deals with evil individuals to the neglect of evil institutions, it stands in the American tradition of particularistic social criticism. If Mills tunes in nicely to the past fears of the American reform mind, however, he often seems less responsive to the hopes of that mentality. The Power Elite gives us villains but no obvious heroes. Can it therefore be said that this book so decisively rejects the hardcore optimism of most Ameri- cans that it passes into an alien realm of fatalism? An answer to this ques- tion is neither simple nor unambiguous. No reasonably perceptive reader can miss the pessimistic implications of The Power Elite. Mills opens and closes the book warning gloomily of impo- tence and irresponsibility. At times he implies that the rise of the power elite and the mass society is part of a world-historical trend. Power becomes, in this bleak assessment, the oppressive stuff of history against which puny mortals are helpless. But this is not the whole story. Mills often uses pessimism as a strategic weapon to express anger and not hopelessness. Such devil's-advocacy pessimism is therapeutic and acts as its own remedy; it reveals the worst only to incite resistance to it. A good deal of Mills's negativism is superficial, the kind of skin-deep toughness that he often affected to protect-and to conceal-a core of vulnerable optimism. Mills was always terrified of getting caught stark naked with his pessimism down. And yet his essential optimism had a dynamic that runs through The Power Elite. Mills insists, for example, that he is describing "trends" rather than inevitabilities. The specter of a totalitarian society divided permanently be- tween elites and masses is not yet reality; there is still hope. Despite some ambiguous lapses into the idiom of determinism, moreover, Mills goes out of his way to emphasize that history is open-ended. Thus his use of the "elite" as against the "class" concept illustrates voluntarist tendencies in his thought. Classes rise and fall with the impersonal dynamic of history; but Mills's elites, taking events in their own hands, can "smash one [institu- tional] structure and set up another." The rise of an "event-" or "role- determining" power elite therefore affirms freedom, for it shows that his-</page><page sequence="15">C. Wright Mills and the Politics of Truth 475 tory is a project within the dominion of man and not the gods. Mills opti- mistically concludes that "the course of events in our time depends more on a series of human decisions than on any inevitable fate." In The Power Elite this voluntarist theory of history-making sustains the hope that humanity may yet seize control of its destiny and replace what Mills calls "drift" with "mastery"-terms that themselves echo the affirmative language of 25 Progressivism.5 A further hopeful achievement of The Power Elite is to identify reason with freedom. While the book's negative subject is raw and oppressive power, its positive and in many respects more important theme is the liberating potential of reason. Mills characteristically conceives of all political problems as intellectual problems, and he translates the dichotomy between power and powerlessness into a more fundamental polarity be- tween unreason and reason. His villains, for example, all suffer mainly from deficiencies of intellect and imagination: they "never let [their] brains show," endorse "irrationality," believe in the "military metaphysic," exhibit "psychological illiteracy," and generally accept the divorce of knowledge from power. Given this diagnosis, the remedy happily follows. A revitalizing dose of reason can, virtually by itself, expose corruption, turn masses into aroused publics, destroy the "metaphysics" of war, and, in sum, end evil and bring about good.26 Mills further suggests that the American intellectual community, car- rying the standard of reason, ought ideally to become the new vanguard of change. He admits, of course, that the intellectuals have not yet taken on this missionary function, and this failure moves him to outrage in his final chapters. Yet Mills remains unshaken in his conviction that the servants of intellect have the ability, given the will, to revolutionize reality. In such assumptions The Power Elite promotes a positive and rationalistic message. Thought is a revolutionary force. The triumph of a Politics of Truth can also mean that noblest of accomplishments: "the presumptuous control by reason of man's fate." 27 This faith has complex implications, for the extremity of Mills's volun- tarist-rationalist convictions acts in two ways. On the one hand Mills can conceive of the future in terms of ideal possibilities unlimited by any deficiencies of human nature or inexorable laws of history. On the other hand Mills views the present very critically in terms of mistakes, failures, 25PE, pp. 24, 21.

This simple distinction between potential and actual clarifies the mixture of audacious hope and hands-thrown-up disgust apparent in The Power Elite. Concerning possibilities Mills is an optimist and utopian. Concerning actualities he is a sober realist and, at times, a pessimist. He believes in the best but is not surprised by the worst. In its distinctive combination of such positive and negative qualities Mills's new radicalism diverges most sharply from the old Progressive syn- thesis. His modern outlook avoids those saving myths of a simpler and more confident age. Thus the uncomplicated Progressive faith in necessary progress gives way to a sense of "grievous decline." The old stress on in- vigorating conflict is replaced by a new emphasis on oppressive one-dimen- sionality. The Progressive confidence in science and technology as kind vehi- cles of progress, an article of belief in that lost time before modern world wars, likewise yields to concern over threatened nuclear destruction. Mills was too involved with what he called "a love affair with the gasoline engine" really to hate technology or to reject, out of hand, the scientific advantages of modern life. Nevertheless, as he confessed in a lecture on science in the post-Hiroshima era, "I do not regard technology as the greatest thing ever ... the truth is, just now, it frightens me a bit." "No longer can we believe, as many of our forebears have," Mills added, "that man will become omni- potent merely by the ascendancy of the scientific ethos of Prometheus un- bound." Somewhat negative concerns of this sort abound in The Power Elite. They reflect a mid-century survivor's wary, and post-Progressive, view of modernity.28 Yet such doubts about technology and progress only cause Mills to put more emphasis on the need for humanity itself to master history through reason. The strength and critical acuity of this rationalist faith decisively separates Mills not only from the old Progressives but also from new liberals. If he had embraced aspects of Progressivism in order to negate the "anti-" or "counter-Progressivism" of modern liberals, Mills ultimately gives his radicalism an identity of its own by rejecting the basic political im- plications of both of these alternative analyses. Whatever their other differences, Progressives and new liberals shared a belief in gradual, prag- matic, and sometimes technocratic reform. They agreed that, at any given moment, there were limits beyond which change could or should not go. By contrast, Mills's thought is more heroic and unrestrained. The high ten- sion between his animadversion to reality and his sense of possibility acts in The Power Elite as a critical principle of a sort alien to most new liberals and Progressives. Mills wants massive change; he wants it now; and he wants to use the power of negative thinking to bring it about. Even while 28PE, p. 353.

Wright Mills and the Politics of Truth 477 describing existing domination in all its reality, he still preserves a hope-a demand-of liberation. In this distinctive linkage of the critical and utopian Mills most closely approximates a theory that is both new and radical.29 * * * Neither Progressive nor new liberal in viewpoint, The Power Elite clearly breaks fresh critical ground. Yet ultimately the book fails to complete its task of new radical synthesis, for at crucial points it lapses into ambiguity and contradiction. A symptomatic confusion has to do with power itself. What promises to be a tough-minded assessment of power in institutional terms often becomes instead an emotional assault on The High and The Mighty in very personal terms. In his evaluation of power, moreover, Mills swings wildly from one end of the political spectrum to the other. At one ex- treme he takes the position of, as he put it, the "goddam anarchist" who hates and fears power of all kinds and who wants ideally to abolish it altogether. But at the other extreme Mills sometimes appears to covet power as the key to a planned society remade along socialist lines.30 Throughout The Power Elite one also encounters other political identities of an in-between sort: Mills the nostalgic democrat who only desires that power again be "balanced" as he thinks it once idyllically was; Mills the conservative who yearns for a traditional aristocracy of power; Mills the hero-worshipper (the Mills of the 1954 Air War College speech) who admires power despite himself. The "wobbly"-anarchist position tends to prevail. Yet the absence of any serious effort to clarify the shifting politics of The Power Elite blurs the focus of the book and leaves the author's real views in doubt. It is as if Mills has tried to preserve every political option by deliberately riding off in all directions at once.31 This sort of ambiguity carries over to other parts of the discussion. It is not clear, for example, whether the utopia of freedom and rationality is compatible with modern industrial capitalism. Mills rails against corporate privilege and denounces the slump-war-boom dynamic of a military economy, to be sure, and yet he also suggests certain more positive judg- 29On "counterprogressivism," see Wise, op. cit.

Perhaps demonstrating what he admitted were his "petty bougwa" instincts, Mills ventures the apparently unradical opinion that "money provides power and power provides freedom." Unlike many radical theorists of capitalist alienation, he assumes that the rich are not only free ("as free as any Americans") but happy. On this point Mills quotes the gospel according to Sophie Tucker: "I've been rich and I've been poor, and believe me, rich is best." He also rejects the Veblenian assumption of leisure class indolence to suggest, almost respectfully, that the rich usually work hard and single-mindedly to increase their wealth and power. In a sense they merit what they get. Such genuflections in the direction of wealth suggest the possibility that, in Mills's view, the ideal society can emerge without any root-and-branch transformation from a capitalist to, say, a socialist or a communist economy. Reform rather than revolution may be enough.32 Such ambiguities further confound Mills's treatment-or rather lack of treatment-of the means of radical change. Unclear about ends, he is necessarily vague as well about how we might go wherever it is we ought to go. Thus Mills gives his Politics of Truth no specific content. Nor does he hold out much hope for the great majority of potentially radical groups from which later dissenting thinkers have commonly taken heart-the poor, the ethnically and sexually oppressed, the young. It is here that Mills's book now seems weakest and most dated. In theoretical terms, then, The Power Elite has severe limitations. It lacks a clear vision of the good society, encourages what Stephen Cohen has called the "programmic escapism" of much crisis-ridden radicalism, and at its worst tends to obscure or to undermine Mills's sustaining faith in the possibility of liberation through reason. The book remains too eclectic, too ambiguous, too tentative and experimental, finally, to achieve the new radical synthesis at which it aims. The analysis of The Power Elite is some- thing of a half-way effort that advances toward, but does not reach, the status of a finished theory.33 Ironically, this indecisiveness explains much of the book's remarkable popularity. Protean and loose-jointed, The Power Elite conforms to some measure to a wide variety of dissenting belief ranging in ideology from far right to far left; consequently it has appealed-in a way that more dogmatic analysis could not-to the conflicting sentiments of a heterogeneous audience. What the book sometimes lacks in theoretical coherence, moreover, is largely made up by the author's conviction. The "unique 32PE, pp. 162, 163, 346.

[from his] magnetic self-assurance." Swados offered even more immediate and telling evidence of the book's emotional impact, especially on lost radicals of the 1950s, in an earlier appreciation of Mills's achievement. "You have done the job," he wrote in 1955. "Let them accuse you of unbalance, twisted judgment, cold imperviousness to the charms of Adlai &amp; Ike, lack of recognition of cultural progress-you have kicked them in the balls at a time when they were craving for it. And you have wrapped up what I feel about America in one book." Mills loved that tribute.34 The importance of The Power Elite, as Swados recognized, thus had as much to do with Mills's sensibility as with his theory. The man who said No has perhaps mattered most of all. To make this point, however, is not to deny The Power Elite its genuine intellectual and historical accomplish- ments. The book raised the liberating colors of dissent in a time of dis- quieting consensus, asking new questions, suggesting some answers, de- manding truth, perfection not compromise, practicality. It was altogether timely and prophetic, moreover, in its attack on prevailing orthodoxy. For The Power Elite at once announced and helped to inspire a revival of radical theory that would, over the next decade and a half, considerably influence the course of American social thought.
