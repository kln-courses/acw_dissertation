<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Sacri cial Stone Tatiana Flessas* This article looks at the controversy surrounding the ownership of the Parthenon Marbles. It argues that relics, memories, iconic fragments and their reconstitution as (and through) narratives of attachment and belong- ing underlie every attempt to use the law to determine ownership of ancient objects. The law in cultural property claims attempts to allocate ownership of metaphors. This article attempts to suggest what these meta- phors might themselves represent. Against a reading of what Friedrich Nietzsche says about memory in On the Genealogy of Morality,1 this article looks to analyses of memory and mourning to suggest that the claims for the Parthenon Marbles are claims for (authorized) memory, and to query what sort of memory is being claimed: memory that references ster- ile mourning, or memory that instead avoids lament and nostalgia, and functions as one of the mechanisms of man’s “overcoming.” If it is the latter, then the claims for the Parthenon Marbles may represent memory that has resulted in completed mourning, a paradoxical position in which the city and its inhabitants claim the past in order to allow amnesia or forgetting to  ourish, and thus to underwrite the possibility of a, or any, future. These dreamy blinkings-out Strike me as grace, if I may say so, Capital punishment, Yes, but of utmost clemency at work, Whereby the human stuff, ready or not, Tumbles, one last drum-roll, into thyme, Out of time, with just the fossil quirk At heart to prove — hold on, don’t tell me . . . What? James Merrill, “Losing the Marbles” “Just as expecting is possible only on the basis of awaiting, remember- ing is possible only on that of forgetting, and not vice versa.”2 This is a tremendously cruel observation: although it is commonly acknowledged 49 </page> <page sequence="2"> that memory may hurt, Heidegger points out that the pain of memory depends upon the different, and possibly greater, pain of forgetting. To remember, one must be in a state of forgetfulness after having not been in such a state: that is, to remember one must be in a state of loss. What is remembered is thus resuscitated, created, retrieved or otherwise brought into being or into consciousness or both as an acquisition or re-acquisi- tion of the lost object. In political theory, the lost object is originary racial or political purity, a beginning that is predicated on the destruction of memory itself.3 In law, and in particular in claims regarding the allocation of cultural property, what is to be gained by tropes or narrative events of remembering or forgetting? Bluntly, property. The argument proposed is that the narrative of ownership is one of the shifting membranes between memory and forgetting. Cultural property discourse and autobiographi- cal tropes occur in the same space and have the same object(s) and crite- ria. They make property out of the past, spinning gold out of straw or treasures out of some alliance between things and the stories told about them. Like all memorial narratives, they are mechanisms of appropriation and lies. The effect is to create property out of what may not have been property before it was claimed. To claim ownership of an ancient object, the law requires a declara- tion of provenance. Yet, the “past” that underlies the debates regarding memory and the ownership of ancient objects, and that forms the substrate(s) of the account(s) of origin, is itself in the making.4 “Memory, history, and relics have long served as mutual metaphors.”5 The account of provenance is itself a combination of history, memory, and  ction.6 The techniques used to support cultural property claims, and to create the narratives of attachment to the object, are techniques of memorialization, which in modernity (as suggested above) reference mourning. However, this article argues that these memorial narratives are turned not towards the past but towards the future.7 They function as the mechanisms of the process of “overcoming” that Nietzsche describes in On the Genealogy of Morality, the process that forms modern “man” out of his precursor, a “nec- essarily forgetful animal, in whom forgetting is a strength. . . .”8 The mecha- nisms of “overcoming” require memory as a positive, or active force. There- fore, the narratives that underlie claims for ancient objects seek to manage the loss that inevitably accompanies time, to overcome memory itself, and through the ownership of the object, to bring mourning to an end. 50 </page> <page sequence="3"> I. History: Origin and Overcoming: The Parthenon and the Parthenon Marbles (Sacri cial Stone) A. The Case The disputes regarding the ownership of the Parthenon Marbles serve as exemplars of this process on many interpretive levels. Speaking at a debate in the Oxford Union in 1986, Melina Mercouri declared “There are no Elgin Marbles!”9 In 2001, there are no longer any Elgin Marbles.10 It is a small elision, yet one that represents a strategic victory over Lord Elgin, and over his memory. The statues themselves remain in the British Museum. As objects patinated with layers of meanings and af liations that constantly  uctuate, they continue to elude both identi cation and ownership. They are glossed, at any given moment, by (discourses and strategies of ) memory and forgetting. The question of who owns the Parthenon Marbles may be better considered by asking how these sculp- tures can be owned, and what mechanisms of “ownership” are used. This question addresses the ownership of memory and history as much as it does the ownership of fragments of a ruined building. As regards the allocation of ancient objects, it is paradigmatic of all cultural property discourse. Yet it may be particularly relevant to the allocation of modern objects and modern sacred sites as well. War constantly creates ruins and those who mourn them, and the question of who owns these ruins is as relevant to the future as it is to the past. The question of whether the “Elgin” or “Parthenon” Marbles should be returned to Athens is one of the oldest questions in cultural property law, and has been extensively addressed by law professors, legal and cultural theorists, historians and politicians from 1816 until the present day.11 Beyond the realms of academia and politics, the debate continues in the news media and on the Internet.12 Claims for their restitution or retention have been made on behalf of the British, the Greeks, and currently, the Parthenon itself, but it’s not clear what “ownership” of these stones would mean. The bases of the claims for retention or restitution now turn as much on principles of cultural internationalism13 (“The cul- tural property of all mankind”) as on cultural nationalism (“They are Greek”; “The British are the true inheritors of the Ancient Greeks”).14 Questions of stewardship and accountability also currently loom as large as the more traditional arguments based in standard principles of contract 51 </page> <page sequence="4"> and property law. Certainly, both the Greek the British governments are less than clear, and possibly less than honest, about the grounds for their claims on these objects. The Greek government currently claims the Parthenon Marbles on the basis that they are fragments of the Parthenon, and that the Parthenon is a symbol of the cultural heritage of the whole world and should be as complete as possible.15 This claim carefully balances the “cultural interna- tionalist” and “cultural nationalist” views of the Parthenon, accepts as a given the territorial basis for Greek ownership of the Parthenon, and glosses over the reality that the sculptures would be placed in a museum rather than on the monument. In the latest bulletin from the Hellenic Ministry of Culture, there is no mention of the legal claims that dominated the debate so far. Rather than arguing about the legality or validity of the “ rman” allegedly giving Elgin’s agents the right to remove pieces of the Parthenon,16 or the legality of the Ottoman action in disposing of Greek cultural history, the Ministry now focuses on arguments of aesthetic integrity and careful stewardship. This change in position may be an attempt to accommodate the perspective of the European Union and the dif culty of supporting legal claims regarding the ownership of ancient objects rather than a change of heart. However, the Greek government is attempting to shame the British government into returning the sculptures by leaving a large open space for the sculptures in the new museum that is being built on the Acropolis. Their absence demands and connotes their presence: it is (already) monumental. The British government steadfastly refuses to yield them. The  rst act of the new Labour government in 1997 was to reassure the nation that the Elgin Marbles would stay in the British Museum. This reassurance was given again in 2001. As a political act, the refusal to return the Marbles differentiated “new” from “old” Labour more effectively than almost any other act.17 The Marbles have played a part in British identity and politi- cal life since Lord Elgin sold them to the nation in 1816. Although the basic claim for retention is that the Marbles were legally acquired, the British also claim that Lord Elgin saved the Marbles by removing them from the Acropolis, and that in the years since their removal they have become part of the British cultural heritage. The British claim of good stewardship and art historical accountability was shaken by William St. Clair’s devastating proof of damage to the Marbles at Lord Duveen’s request.18 Now, the 52 </page> <page sequence="5"> British, like the Greeks a generation, or a century, ago, fall back on their claim to Ancient Greece. The con ict between the modern Greeks and the British government re ects, and turns on, the battle being waged for the ownership of memory, history, autochthony,  liation, descent from the “Greeks.” The current form of the dispute unfolds against the background of cultural property law and theory more generally. First, there are at least two major strands in cultural property analyses. The  rst is that repre- sented by the international conventions for the preservation of cultural property during war, is administered by the United Nations, and is expressed in the work of traditional legal scholars and historians. From this perspective, which encompasses both the cultural nationalism and cultural internationalism brie y discussed above, the legal and legislative efforts regarding the return of cultural property are concerned with managing primarily physical objects, which are locatable at the intersec- tion of the realms of national and international politics, and are cross- referenced against certain points in the realm of “culture.” Culture in this schema is a quasi-normative organizing concept that can be loosely considered as underwriting the value of preserving certain kinds of objects in a form that acknowledges the concerns of (artistic) integrity and (terri- torial) allocation, and remains as close to the “original” form as possible. As such, the efforts of more traditional cultural property legislation and political activism are directed towards the work of reconstruction, restitu- tion, retention, “repatriation” of the objects at issue. The claims regarding the disposition of the Parthenon Marbles exist in this area of cultural prop- erty law. The second strand or school of cultural property analysis is represented by the  eld of critical cultural property analyses that are based in the disci- plines of social theory, anthropology, heritage studies and the laws and policies being currently created around/for indigenous peoples. In these realms of legal and cultural theory, the emergent  eld of cultural property analysis focuses on multiculturalism, the effects of colonialism, and the rights of certain groups to pieces of their “identity.”19 The arguments often turn on the distinctions between East-West, North-South, and “indigenous” and “Western” or “technocratic” economic and social struc- tures. In situations where an indigenous/“Western” split is visible, there is a different privileging of the term “culture” as used in “cultural property.” 53 </page> <page sequence="6"> “Culture” becomes a substantive rather than formal category, one that can anchor property claims without the concomitant operation of traditional notions of “law” or “proprietary rights.” In this form of analysis, the past itself is understood as  uid, or as requiring reconstruction. This sort of theoretical project is supported by the work of traditional and non-tradi- tional historians, anthropologists, cultural theorists, and legal academics, and engages with the questions that are seen to de ne modernity more generally. Between these two forms of analysis, there is a growing body of legal scholarship that looks to instantiate the values of the latter approach within the more traditional legal landscape of the former. To this end, legal academics and theorists are proposing new uses of property law concepts within the legal framework of cultural property disputes,20 or are propos- ing new legal bodies and tribunals to provide a forum for resolving these sorts of problems.21 All three perspectives interrogate the meaning of “the past.” One can- not discuss cultural property questions without taking a position on the accessibility of “the past” to modern observation. The case of the Parthenon Marbles exempli es this point as well; the imperative of assessing the con- struction of memory as a strategy of ownership becomes apparent when looking at the history of the Parthenon and the Marbles. B. The Parthenon In both sets of claims, the Parthenon itself stands as the primary cipher. Even before the Marbles, the history of the Parthenon itself displays the links between memory, history, and civic identity that are at the heart of public buildings. No public building is built by accident. The choice of what it memorializes, or represents, however, changes over time. Any public building risks this  uidity of function and meaning.22 In the case of the Parthenon, memory, mourning, and forgetting were inextrica- bly intertwined from when it  rst came into being. This complex of signs, in stone, continues to the present day. Therefore, any attempt to set out the history of the Parthenon must address the question of what is retained and what is discarded of original meaning or intent. The Parthenon was built a generation after the Persians laid waste to many of the earlier temples on the Acropolis.23 Pericles directed the re- 54 </page> <page sequence="7"> building of the Parthenon in order to erase the memory of the Persian conquest of Athens, and to commemorate the predominance of Athens among the city-states of Ancient Greece. However, within a few years af- ter its completion, and before the temple of the Erechtheion was  nished, the Peloponnesian War began between Athens and Sparta. The Athenians lost this war a generation later.24 Thus the marker of Athenian triumph over the Persians (and of domination over the other city-states that formed the Delian League) shifted almost immediately to a symbol of loss. Within two generations, the political power that the Parthenon was intended to represent had come to an end. In this sense, the “Elgin” or “Parthenon” Marbles anchor the history of the Parthenon rather than the other way around, as to tell the story of the Parthenon is to choose an arbitrary moment of origin, and continue. The history of the Parthenon is as complicated as the history of Athens. In later antiquity, the Parthenon was appropriated by non-Athenian Greeks (i.e., Alexander the Great) and the Romans as a symbol of later regimes’ appropriation of the classical Athenians’ patrimony. The building then remained largely unchanged until the Byzantine Emperor Constantine converted to Christianity and declared Christianity the of cial religion of the Empire in the 4th century A.D. In the early 6th century, the Parthenon was converted to a Greek Orthodox church. It was dedicated to Our Lady of the Holy Wisdom, in order to maintain and bene t from the linkages with the pre-existing worship of Athena. Athens nevertheless remained a provincial center of the Byzantine Empire until 1204, when invaders, primarily crusaders (Franks) and Venetians, began to conquer the Byzan- tine Empire. At that point, the Parthenon became the Roman Catholic church of Notre Dame, and a large tower was built near the entrance to the Acropolis. In 1453, the Ottomans occupied Greece and took possession of Athens. The Acropolis, as a militarily strategic position, served as the for- tress of the Ottoman army posted in Athens. In 1687, during the attempt by the Venetian general Morosini to retake Athens, the Parthenon was being used as a munitions arsenal by the Turkish forces. Shelling Athens from the harbour, Morosini hit the Parthenon. The building exploded. After that, it was a ruin. In the following year, the Turks re-captured Athens, and built a small minaret and mosque on the ruins of the Parthenon. They also used it to garrison some army of cers, building small 55 </page> <page sequence="8"> houses among the ruins. By the end of the 18th century, Athens was a small Oriental town, with a multicultural population, churches, mosques, palm trees, camels, traveling gentlemen and artists from Europe. At the time of the Greek War of Independence against the Ottoman Empire,25 the Acropolis bore the traces of these other incarnations. In 1833, the Greek state was established with the support of the European powers. At this point the Parthenon assumed the form and mean- ing that it carries today. The European regard for ancient Greece and the virtues and values of classicism not only contributed to the recognition of the modern Greek state, but also mandated that state’s emphasis on ancient Greece and the identity of its people with the ancient Greeks.26 The reconstruction of the Parthenon began immediately. The struggle to establish and maintain the chosen national identity meant that the traces of medieval and late Hellenistic history vanished. Even pre-classical archaic structures on the Acropolis were nearly lost. “Greece,” and by extension “Athens,” was no longer multicultural and multilingual, it was “purely” classical. As a result of this decision, the Parthenon was deliber- ately restored as a ruin: In 1834 the Bavarian neo-classical architect Leo von Klenze was invited to Athens to advise the new government on a policy for the future of the Acropolis. Like Elgin and most of his contemporaries, von Klenze admired the Athens of the  fth century above all other periods of the past. He proposed that Greece should repair the surviving monu- ments, using a mixture of old marble and modern imagi- nation. They would, however, remain as ruins, romantic and picturesque, a lasting reminder of what had been lost and what had been regained.27 This plan was acted upon by successive Greek governments, until 1890, . . . when virtually everything had already gone, the so- called “purist” approach to the Acropolis came to an end. The Parthenon was now a badly ruined building of the  fth century. The Acropolis was a fully dug archaeologi- cal site.28 The memorial was complete. 56 </page> <page sequence="9"> The building, in its “ nished” form, has come to symbolize an Athens that existed for less than one hundred years, and yet which has come to represent the Greeks that exist two and a half thousand years later. All Greeks have not become Athenians, but “the people of Greece came to regard the Parthenon as the ‘soul of Greece.’”29 However, following the history of the Parthenon as set out above, does the “soul of Greece,” thus de ned, belong to the Greeks? This soul may well be as British, as French, as German, as it is Greek. Pericles began the making of the Parthenon. The Europeans of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries passionately supported the classical history of the building. The Greeks of the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth centuries have appropriated both “origins”: the origin of Pericles, and that of classical scholarship. These Greeks ensured that [t]he temple . . . which for more than a thousand years, according to one traveller, had languished as a place for the worship of a Jewish peasant and an Arab camel driver, had at last been returned to its true purpose.30 This statement can be read as a failure as well as a success. One must ask what this sort of return represents. One must also ask how ownership claims can be resolved or even understood in this context. C. The Frieze The sculptures at the center of the dispute distill the discourse of remembrance and sacri ce that the building itself represents. The Marbles are large sections of the frieze that ran around the entire Parthenon.31 Currently, the bulk of the frieze is in the Duveen Gallery of the British Museum,32 although there are a few panels in the Acropolis Museum in Athens. Directly in front of the entrance to the Duveen Gallery, in the middle of one of the long walls of the rectangle that makes up the Gallery, is the East frieze, which consists of the focus of the ceremonial proces- sion.33 Here, there are the gods of Olympus, two adults (a man and a woman), two girls bearing trays with folded cloths on them, a child that could be either a girl or a boy, and magistrates or tribal heroes. The gods ranked on either side look away from the scene. The meaning of this tableau is a mystery.34 Clearly, the frieze refers to an event that engages and 57 </page> <page sequence="10"> concerns the entire population of Athens. Until recently, scholars specu- lated that the frieze depicted the Panathenaic festival, which celebrated Athena, the founding deity of Athens, but this theory has never been wholly accepted as the correct account of what the frieze depicts.35 Indeed, it is impossible to know what the true meaning of the scene “really” is. The meaning of the frieze is a matter of interpretation.36 Recent scholarship suggests that the subject-matter of the frieze commemorates not the Panathenaic Festival but the sacri ce of Erechtheus’ daughters.37 The legend surrounding Erechtheus was one of the ancestor or tribal myths of Athens and a common theme in Athenian civic art. In this myth the ancient king Erechtheus was told that he must sacri ce one of his three daughters in order to be guaranteed success in the war against the Thracians.38 All three daughters had sworn, however, that if one must die the other two would share her fate. Connelly argues that the West side of the frieze shows Erechtheus, his wife Praxithea, and the three daughters in the moment before the sacri ce. Erechtheus was either the second or the  rst great founding father of Athens, either a descendant of Kekrops and Erechthonious, the mythical founders of the autochthonous Athenian race, or an alternative incarnation of these  gures.39 The Erechtheion on the Acropolis also commemorates Erechtheus. Herodotus writes that from earliest times there was a “temple of Erechtheus the Earth- born, as he is called, in this citadel. . . .”40 The people of Athens and the city of Athens could not be distinguished from each other. In Euripides’s Erechtheus,41 Erechtheus’s wife Praxithea justi es the sacri ce of her daughters by saying that I shall give my daughter to be put to death. I take many things into account and  rst of all that I could not  nd any other city better than this. To begin with we are an autochthonous people, not introduced from elsewhere: other communities founded as it were through board-game moves, are imported, different ones from different places. Now someone who settles in one city from another is like a peg ill- tted in a piece of wood — a citizen in name but not in his actions.42 As citizens, the ancient Athenians of the classical period considered them- selves to be an autochthonous people, a people that sprung from the land 58 </page> <page sequence="11"> of the Acropolis itself.43 Praxithea is represented on the Parthenon frieze, and it is interesting to note that the  gure of Kekrops was also represented on the West pediment of the Parthenon.44 The frieze therefore memorial- izes civic memory of origin and sacri ce. The Acropolis served as the center of Athens and of its cults and myths long before the Classical Parthenon was constructed.45 Visiting the Acropolis Museum46 in search of panels from the Classical frieze, one sees that the  gures from the archaic Parthenons depicted the same narrative program. The sculptures from the pediments of the earlier temples on the site show The “frightening monsters” with their superhuman strength and daemonic power, and the . . . lions tearing at the  esh of . . . calves. . . . Their purpose is not to relate a story, but merely to remind one of the existence in the world of terrible powers that are overawing and over- whelming. . . . Yet there is no one more powerful than man. . . . Attic sculpture displays the terrible power of supernatural beings but at the same time projects the hu- man being, both heroic and mythical, who succeeds in harnessing this power.47 At the time that the frieze was created, the Golden Age of Athens had vanquished the “frightening monsters.” Yet Connelly shows that the Parthenon Marbles are in keeping with the narrative program of the archaic Parthenon as well as the Classical temple ordered by Pericles.48 Like in Von Klenze’s scheme almost two millennia later, the program is one of memorializing and overcoming simultaneously. However, the act at the heart of the Parthenon frieze is an act of sacri ce that holds both elements of the program in stasis. On the Parthenon frieze, it is always before the sacri ce: the sacri ce has not yet been made; the future of the city hangs in the balance. The link between a people and their place of origin might always portray this particular moment, deliberately or not. Memory and the future — “overcoming” — may be dependent on each other and opposed. At the heart of this conjunction (or trajectory) are human sacri-  ce, war, death, and a grim commitment to the future. The classical order and rhythm of the Parthenon frieze displays (in the form of a mystery to modern viewers) these necessities. The discourse of cultural property is origin-obsessed, relentlessly back- 59 </page> <page sequence="12"> ward-looking. The very idea of “cultural property” references re-claiming rather than merely claiming; the act of establishing origin is portrayed as an act of recollection. 49 For very ancient objects, such as the Parthenon frieze, the recollection must take the form of a narrative that links the claimant with ahistorical time. This narrative, impossibly, turns on memory. . . . [I]n his list of peoples who inhabit the Peloponnese, the historian Herodotus carefully distinguishes those “stay- ing in the same place,” meaning those whose ancestor is autochthonous, from the rest who are considered immi- grant, or at least displaced populations. . . . But autochthony must be earned. . . . [O]ut of Herodotus’ statement a . . . criterion emerges, implicit but imperative, which adds to the transmission of the soil that of memory. It is well to occupy the land, but even better to maintain the autochthonous tradition, in order to strengthen the ties that bind the present to the time of origin.50 To maintain the autochthonous tradition means to possess cultural objects such that the acts of claiming and possessing do the work of memory. This is narrative work. It requires a purposive engagement with the past in order to  ctionalize it. The Parthenon frieze suggests that the work of memory is ambiguous in its valorization of accuracy; rather than pure or objective recollection, it is, in a sense, memory management. “Overcoming” the memorialized moment, that is, moving into the future, may mean overcoming memory itself.51 Certainly, the frieze shows that for the ancient Greeks, the future was built on the collapse of “time immemorial” into “time memorial”; and indeed, into “time remembered.”52 Within the realm of cultural prop- erty, this sort of purposive relativization and historicization of “the past,” interacting with cultural memory and cultural forgetting, constitute the  eld on which, or through which, cultural property (and the related  elds of museum management and “heritage” sites) has become an ever-expand- ing discourse.53 Nevertheless, despite the claims of memory and autochthony, there is no possible uninterrupted relationship with ancient objects. Memory is at issue because it underpins the claim of autochthony, but also because it is an essential narrative trope of the  ctions of uninter- rupted attachment that are necessary in cultural property claims. These 60 </page> <page sequence="13"> ( ctional) claims are in turn necessary to annex the past as a foundation for the continuing survival of a people or polis, that is, for a foundation not for a particular future, but the possibility of any future. II. Memory: Techniques of “Overcoming” The sort of active or generative memory that  gures narrative is its own object, creating itself out of the exercise of its own faculties. It serves as both structure and substance of narrative. This may be seen in the different ways that the art of memory is practiced in different historical periods. The balance between mneme and anamnesis shifts over time, as does the “direction” of memory and the “place” or “landscape” in which memory is presumed to operate.54 A. The purpose of memory: “Overcoming” The understanding that genealogies of (self-)knowledge are also exercises of the will, and thus artifacts of human creation, begins, in the modern era, with Nietzsche. In Sections 1–3 of the second essay of On the Genealogy of Morality,55 Nietzsche examines how “nature” “[bred] an ani- mal which is able to make promises.”56 The human ability to make promises is bred in counter-force to the natural, healthy state of forgetfulness. Memory is an expression of will, created through some symbiosis between “nature” and “man.” . . . [P]recisely this necessarily forgetful animal, in whom forgetting is a strength, representing a form of robust health, has bred for himself a counter-device, memory, with the help of which forgetfulness can be suspended . . . in those cases where . . . a promise is to be made: consequently, it is by no means merely a passive inability to be rid of an impression once it has made its impact, . . . instead it is an active desire not to let go, a desire to keep on desiring what has been, on some occasion, desired, really it is the will’s memory: so that a world of . . . circumstances and even acts of will may be placed quite safely in between the original “I will” . . . and the actual discharge of the will.57 61 </page> <page sequence="14"> The act of making a promise triggers the ability to remember, or rather, to suspend forgetfulness. This ability is the cornerstone of “the sovereign individual,” a man who has been made reliable by the “straightjacket” of the “morality of custom” and who, because of his own reliability, because of the sublimation of his animal self, now possesses a will that allows him to be predictable to himself and responsible to others. Society and the morality of custom, working through brute force, over- come the “frightening monsters” of human nature. They were simply the means to . . . the sovereign individual . . . like only to itself, having freed itself from the morality of custom, an autonomous, supra-ethical individual (because “autonomous” and “ethical” are mutually exclusive) . . . a man . . . who has the right to make a promise — and has . . . an actual awareness of power and freedom, a feeling that man in general has reached completion.58 Brute force — pain — links the present with the promise made in the past, continues (or guarantees the continuation) of that desiring self. This continuation, through the complex of pain, social bene ts, promises and the enforced discharge of  xed desire, constitutes the sort of memory that is, in turn, the cornerstone of reason.59 One could say, this sort of memory is the cornerstone of this sort of reason.60 Nietzsche here is engaged in diagramming the tools and processes that led to a “man who is now free,” a “master of the free will” because he “really does have the right to make a promise.” A promise, a guarantee of the will’s desire, leads to freedom. But there are two problems with this. First, man is not free, regardless of his “actual awareness of power and freedom.” Not even Zarathustra is (wholly) free.61 This degree of will and of concomitant “freedom” is merely an interim point in the development of “man.” Memory gives man the right to the future, but a split exists between the repression, pain, and “breeding” that lead to the right, and the use of it. Humankind must reach the future in order to become free, an objective that not only de nes Nietzsche’s scheme for the next step of mankind, the next “overcoming” that will continue and invert the processes that brought us thus far, but also as regards the possibility, the  eld or ground for this process. The desire to keep on desiring into the future is the minimum requirement for the nexus of time 62 </page> <page sequence="15"> and will that may, in each instant, change the pain of self-overcoming into the af rmation of life.62 Second, in Nietzsche’s scheme, the desire to make the promise must predate memory and reason both. As the example of Zarathustra shows, it also postdates memory and reason. Yet, the “blond beast” or the “superman” putatively gains something entirely different from making promises than the self-satisfaction of being reliable that the “sovereign individual” feels.63 One could argue that the “blond beast” and the “superman” gain the ability to make important or fateful promises: to enact human sacri ces, to deny contractual society, to be an autochtho- nous citizen of a polis that we cannot imagine. It is not clear what the purpose of memory or reason would be to a person who remembers and forgets seamlessly, without the aide-mémoire of pain. In this shifting world of forces and objects, Nietzsche’s analyses illuminate what is at stake in debates regarding cultural property. Nietzsche’s inversion of the past into the future, of memory into desire, sets a new horizon line for addressing cultural property claims. “For Nietzsche all great things bring about their own demise through a process of self-over- coming.”64 The claim for return of cultural objects, the reaching for and use of great art, great ancient cultures: these gestures form an act of self- overcoming, a necessary and necessarily-cannibalized foundation for the future. The gesture is the “dice-throw,” the scooping up the past in order to throw it forward, to overcome, to invert, to survive, to grow, to be stron- ger, to be the same but different. The desire to keep on desiring (memory) and the object through which desire focuses itself (the Parthenon Marbles) conspire in an elision of time, an attempt to slip the constraints of time and vault into immortality. What else is required by “nature” for the sovereign individual, does the sovereign individual come to require of him- self? The very notion of desire, of “longing” is pinned to immortality.65 Immortality and mortality, mourning, alterity: memory is concerned with what can be acquired and overcome. Like in archaeology, memory is con- cerned with what can come to function as a foundation, which will in turn, and necessarily, be forgotten. If the gesture is the dice-throw and the  eld or ground for this gesture is the shifting  eld of forces geared to immortality, the  gure that animates the ground of this discourse is the  gure of memory, and the technique by which it does so is a steadfast  ctionalization, or “lying,” in the face of a “truth”66 that might express any other will to power. The hall- 63 </page> <page sequence="16"> marks of memory as mechanism of cultural property claims, like those of memory as a technique of “overcoming,” are falsehood and repression. Memory inverts into forced, not “natural” forgetting, it is uncomfortable with both the past and the future. Engaging in the discourse(s) of memory means taking up a (consciously?) resistant posture, in which memory, and forgetting,67 both stand as barriers to the strategies and tactics of compet- ing wills. This stance raises the question of representation: language and “real- ity” have to be untangled in order for the techniques of memory and narrative to be visible. Modern ideas of memory both partake in and must address this problem, in contrast to ancient or medieval constructions of memory, in which memory is coeval with knowledge, organized on a grid of representation in which the phenomenological triangle of viewer/ob- ject/perspective remains unproblematic.68 The  ctionalizing or “lying” stance is that of narrative. The past as narrative requires a (constructed) link between the authority of the poet or storyteller and that of the scholar.69 B. The  gure of memory: Mnemosyne The modern art of memory (as seen in psychoanalysis, oral history and “heritage” discourses) is rooted in the Romantic movement in poetry and painting as well as the notion of “resurrectionism.”70 This is to root modern memory in a persistent sense of anxiety and nostalgia, a position that it shares with other concepts (particularly that of time) in “moder- nity.”71 The direction of speech is towards the dead rather than towards the living, the direction of vision is internal rather than external. There- fore, the link between memory and the past requires an examination of the link between memory and mourning. In the realms of literary criti- cism, memory as a trope or  gure is connected to mourning and to mor- tality, thus to the ethics of identity and alterity.72 Considering the work of Paul de Man — and eulogizing de Man after his death — Derrida links the  gure of Mnemosyne73 with mourning. He draws a distinction, rooted in psychoanalytic theory, between possible and impossible mourning. In possible mourning, one interiorizes the image or ideal of the other, as opposed to an “impossible mourning, which, leaving the other his alterity, respecting thus his in nite remove, either refuses to take or is incapable of taking the other within oneself, as in the tomb or 64 </page> <page sequence="17"> the vault of some narcissism.”74 Derrida de nes the tropological use of “memory” to mean a certain relation that exists between a speaker and his or her subject, a relation that is internal but that makes the internal visible to the speaker, so in a sense turns him or her inside out. Once again, the de ning moment of memory is the vault from origin (unknown and unknowable) into the future (also unknown and unknow- able). In order for memory to be more than “a technics, a recording,” impossible mourning must be attempted via an originary af rmation.75 Memory depends on af rmation, a pre-existing, non-rational “yes” that extends into an always-unknowable future.76 In this sense, Derrida (and de Man) access the themes addressed by Nietzsche.77 Yet this af rmation, while bringing the self into resolution for the self, does not rest there. The key to “impossible” mourning is precisely that it rests both before and beyond the self, anchoring the dual, or Janus-faced, nature of narrative: “Is narrative possible? Who can claim to know what a narrative entails? Or, before that, the memory it lays claim to?”78 In the meeting of mortal with mortal, which is “really” the meeting of mortal with his or her own mortality, what we have “is the origin of  ction, of apocryphal  guration. . . .”79 An opening, in language, becomes possible out of the impossibility of “true” mourning. This generates the deployment of several genres and tropes that describe the work of memory: autobiography,80 prosopopeia and the epitaph,81 and allegory.82 Fiction erupts to  ll the space otherwise left always empty. The originary af rmation remains a “yes” that cries out “I will!” These genres and tropes are all interstitial, re ecting the interstitial nature of memory and narrative in this scheme of analysis. Like memory, they inhabit the space “between Being and the law”83 and “between  ction and truth. . . .”84 Like memory, they cannot possibly (or impossibly) ex- press the truth. In Derrida’s work, “[t]he ‘truth’ of ‘true mourning’ is . . . part of the procession” that Nietzsche describes: “‘What is truth then? A mobile army of metaphors, metonymies, and anthropomorphisms.’”85 “True mourning” is only slightly “less deluded” than these other forms of truth. “‘The most it can do is to allow for non-comprehension and enumerate . . . prosaic, or better, historical modes of language power.’”86 This stripping away of the comforts of language brings out and makes possible analyses of “‘resistances’ and of the symptoms they produce (for example the ‘resistance to theory’ in literary studies).”87 65 </page> <page sequence="18"> In this sense, true mourning functions as a resistance to resistance, as an acceptance of the little “truth” available to the mourning subject, who has become, himself, the object of his own memory. In this endeavour, the space opened between speech and image is familiar.88 The distance be- tween the sign and the signi er, between the “self ” and the “other” has already begun to be explored, and the resulting landscape is now being imported, more or less wholesale, into this realm of images and attach- ments, beliefs based in mythologies of family and history, and entitlements conferred, still, by blood.89 Despite the “alliance” of af rmation, and the future-oriented  nitude which is “the trace of the other in us,”90 Derrida knows that “in memory of ” are words that we can never resolve to our satisfaction: “. . . [w]e remain in disbelief itself. For never will we believe either in death or immortality. . . .”91 In Derrida’s scheme, we overcome not mourning but our own mourn- ing, and then rarely. The work of memory and mourning, however, is the work of “overcoming” described in the Genealogy. Man forces an unnatu- ral result, and in the rupture or rift that is created, a new faculty comes into being. With the new faculty comes a new “man.” Caught between forgetting and impossible mourning, we expand past our boundaries: we speak of others’ lives when they are not there to contradict us, and of time that has (always?) already slipped its moorings. We take ownership of the past. This act of af rmation — the “yes” that cries out “I will!”—is the act needed to claim ancient objects or to occupy or rebuild ruins. It is a cry of  ctional recognition, of desire-driven appropriation, of power that seeks to overturn the loss of memory in the past. C. The results of purposive memory: the future Does the link between memory and mourning only arise when we face the alterity of death, which is in fact that of our own mortality? Or is “death” what we always face in the past, the meaning of “the past” to us? It is possible that when facing an ancient object — freighted with the past, but immortal, outlasting comprehensible stretches of human time — the relationship between memory and mortality, between memory and mourn- ing, changes. Our conception of the immortality of the object may restructure the process(es) of memory in us, so that the impossible (either mourning or immortality) becomes possible (in some evolutionary fan- tasy, guaranteed by the narrative of “the past”). Alternatively, the terrible 66 </page> <page sequence="19"> fragility of ancient things may cause greater mourning. If, however, these questions resolve themselves into questions of immortality, of endless desire rather than “endless mourning,”92 then we stand in a complicated, compromised position opposite time. We stand in the position of “after- wards” in order to move forward, a position that af rms the necessary af rmation, and raises interesting questions.93 A different reading of the possibilities of memory and mourning suggests a different approach to take to achieve “reason,” in order to access a different version of (civic) “overcoming.” In the reading proposed by Gillian Rose, reason can be released from the debates that diminish it in modernity (the schisms between representation and reality, between meta- physics and ontology), and also the brutalities that lodge it in mourning. She argues that memory and reason can work together to gradually redis- cover their own moveable boundaries as they explore the boundaries of the soul, the city and the sacred.94 In theory, reason can work with and through memory to complete mourning. Completed mourning acknowl- edges the creative involvement of action in the con gurations of power and law: it does not  nd itself unequivocally in a closed circuit that exclu- sively confers logic and power.95 Action then is not caught between repre- sentation (metaphysics) and ethics, or between ontology and “the law” of naming, of language. Rather, “explorations of our mutual entanglements in power” can be based on an understanding of “reality” that is neither founded in metaphysics nor results in narcissism. As a result, reason can survive modernity96 and its denial of classical philosophical foundations: [I]f . . . “reality” is intrinsically relational and experience is generated between what interconnected actors posit as independent of them and their dif cult discovery of those positings, then the critique of representation becomes pos- sible without it depending on any outworn metaphysical base.97 The freedom that results is positive and outwardly-directed. The view of “reality” that Rose argues for here depends on a “phenomenological description of experience,” and it sustains learning, growth, and knowledge “as fallible and precarious, but risk-able.”98 The “risk” is directly the opposite from that contemplated by Derrida. It is a risk of making “temporarily constitutive positings of each other which form 67 </page> <page sequence="20"> and reform both selves,”99 which is a risk of positing, failing, and positing again. The risk is of “activity beyond activity”100 rather than the Levinasian “passivity beyond passivity” which results from interiorized mourning. “Activity beyond activity” remains an ethical formulation of the problem, but its “direction of  t” with “otherness” is different than Levinas’s. In this analysis, the idea of political action is not necessarily determined by a closed or already-de ned notion of the subject. The realm that we would like to live in may be barred to us, but there is a huge realm of possible action remaining. Memory and mourning are turned not towards the individual but towards the polis. Rose discusses this through analyzing the meaning of a painting by Poussin, Gathering the Ashes of Phocion.101 Phocion’s mourning wife de es the law of the city to gather his ashes. One reading of the act of gathering the ashes is that it is an act of perfect love; it is opposed to reason and to law, and it is necessarily outside the boundaries of the unjust city, which is represented by the classical architecture depicted behind the two women. Rose puts forward the opposite argument. She argues that the classical buildings present the rational order which throws into relief the spe- ci c act of injustice perpetrated by the current represen- tatives of the city — an act which takes place outside the boundary wall of the built city. The gathering of the ashes is a protest against arbitrary power; it is not a protest against power and the law as such. To oppose anarchic, individual love or good to civil or public ill is to deny the third which gives meaning to both . . . the just city and the just act, the just man and the just woman. In Poussin’s painting, this transcendent but mournable justice is con-  gured, its absence given presence, in the architectural perspective which frames and focuses the enacted justice of the two women. To see the built forms themselves as ciphers of the unjust city has political consequences: it perpetuates endless dying and endless tyranny, and it ruins the possibility of political action.102 The grieving woman and the acts of memorialization and mourning correct the law, do not challenge reason. The citizens of the polis are the 68 </page> <page sequence="21"> “just man and the just woman.” The just city is the city that creates these people; they are “sovereign individuals,” they are themselves memorial- ized. There are too many differences between Phocion’s wife and Praxithea to attempt a true analogy. Nevertheless, despite their differences, the stories have a few similarities. In the just city (or the city perceived as just), memory and mourning invert into autochthony and immortality. On the walls or against the walls of the living city, or on the outskirts of the ideal(-ized) (interiorized) city, mourning  nishes and memory has work to do amongst a web of forces and experiences. To do the work of memory and to complete mourning in this context, one has to reject the (purely) interstitial reading of the nature of memory itself. Praxithea and Phocion’s (unnamed) wife act to create the necessary tropes of memorialization, and their actions save and re ect the just city. This is in keeping with the legal analyses referenced above; to return to Raphael Samuel, the argument of Theatres of Memory (and of much of the contemporary discourse in history, heritage and museum studies) is that . . . [M]emory . . . is an active, shaping force; that it is dynamic — what it contrives symptomatically to forget is as important as what it remembers — and that it is dialectically related to historical thought, rather than be- ing some kind of negative other to it.103 This is the sort of memory used in and by cultural property discourse. It is the memory of autobiographical and  ctional tropes turned to the uses of law, to claim a belief in the continuation of a just place, a just future. D. Forgetting The question of forgetting  rst arose as the description of one aspect of how memory serves as resistance and mechanism, forcing the human being out of a singular state and into a position of (personal and political) responsibility to others.104 To return brie y to the question, and to the Ancient Greeks, is forgetting any more possible than true memory or mourning? The Ancient Greeks recognized and rejected what the city feared: the “fascination of loss,” “‘pleasure of tears’” and “‘suspended time’” which threatens the positivity of the political sphere: “Hence the rejection 69 </page> <page sequence="22"> of memory when it tries to be the guardian of rifts and breaches: the city wants to live and perpetuate itself without breaks, and its citizens must not wear themselves out with crying.”105 In the ancient Greek polis, mourn- ing or lamentation had to stay within emotionally and politically accept- able bounds. The result could be “tantamount to the banning of memory — that is, of certain kinds of memory.”106 The exception to this rule was the “lamentation of mothers” — women who had the right to mourn publicly. Although Praxithea was allowed to mourn, Loraux, speaking of her zeal to sacri ce her daughters, comments that Praxithea is “Athenian” more than “mother” and that as Praxithea wraps herself in the autochtho- nous ideal, she is “elated with a very personal fanatical sense of citizenship that she pushes to the limits of deceit” in not just offering her daughter but ‘freely giving’ her. . . .”107 Praxithea is poised to memorialize, not mourn, her daughter(s) in the service of the Athenian city.  “Laws exist to delimit the bounds of mourning.”108 In the law of Ancient Greece, mourning ends with memorialization and the command to forget. The command to forget encapsulates the essence of the Ancient Greek idea of amnesty. Forgetting weaves personal mourning into politi- cal life; as regards the law, it is within the ambit of power to compel amnesty. Civic memory and civic forgetting were linked but orthogonal to mourning and lamentation. The memory was banned in order to ban the rage and the endless cycles of retaliation that accompany absolute grief; it was legal and legally-enforced forgetting. Amnesty and amnesia were linked.109 What was selected for forgetting was what was deemed no longer essential for the future of the city or the people.110 Is this possible today? As Loraux asked regarding the Ancient Greeks, is there ever absolution for absolute grief, cycles of endless retaliation? In Ancient Greece, amnesty was “formal civic act of nonremembering.” 111 The discourse of cultural property shows us that rather than remembering and refusing to remem- ber, we forget and refuse to forget. In this sense, we are still where Nietzsche placed us over a century ago. III. What does this mean for cultural property? The links between objects, memory, and history — between things and interpretive discourse — are themselves the fabric of the discursive  eld through which the law generates the narratives that validate claims to 70 </page> <page sequence="23"> pieces of cultural property. The narratives of past events are themselves often, if not essentially,  ctional.112 The narrative that de nes a relic is the narrative that weaves memory and history into and through the physical object, destabilizing the “thing-ness” of the object itself.113 Furthermore, “the past’s empirical absence leaves a grain of doubt which philosophical analysis cannot wholly allay.”114 It may seem self-evident that physical objects anchor the narrative(s) of the past better than remembered events; arguably a vase or statue or piece of  int keep their shapes through time, are merely glossed by the often competing or challenged stories told about them. Yet both as physical objects and as loci of memory or history, relics are themselves in  ux. The physical being of objects leads inevitably to their decay. As importantly, however, objects (in particular of this kind) cannot be separated from the disciplines of memory and history, and the meanings that attach to or are found in these disciplines.115 Objects from the ancient past may remain physically present while being phenomeno- logically irrelevant to the knowledge of the past that they are presumed to guarantee.116 In short, Memory, history, and relics offer routes to the past best traversed in combination. Each route requires the others for the journey to be signi cant and credible. Relics trig- ger recollection, which history af rms and extends back- wards in time. History in isolation is barren and lifeless; relics mean only what history and memory convey.117 In this argument, once again memory is like history: “inherently revi- sionist and never more chameleon than when it appears to stay the same.”118 Like history, memory is a creature of the present;119 and like memory, his- tory is a story told according to the constraints or rules of  ction.120 In this scheme, critical theory should recognize that memory constructed in this manner functions to allow necessary  ctions. The truths that are at stake in cultural property debates cannot be erased by knowledge, as they are both  ctional and real; they are stories told about desire, translated into prom- ises regarding the future. In this sense, the  ctions of memory become “truths” as obdurate and permeable as the objects themselves. Unless this understanding serves as the linchpin of analyses of claims for return, the objects themselves — the bowls and columns and vases and masks — remain untouched, still elude theory. An object can only be understood 71 </page> <page sequence="24"> — in its ownership as well as in any other quality — by understanding the stories that are told about it. The “falseness” of the memory is in direct proportion to the magnitude (if not the meaning of ) the claim to the object. Objects that are de ned as cultural property are riddled with absences: the people who made the object, those who worshipped it or at it, the various  uxes of populations that acquired it, “legally” or not. Rights attach to long-dead  gures in the past, which are reanimated and returned to relevance. In this sense, old objects are always palimpsests, come to the present with erasures and attachments, marginal interpretations and unintended emendations. The authority of history or science, the identi- ties121 that would seem to control possession or reappropriation of these objects, are brought to the “thing itself ” in overlapping, purposeful waves. There is thus a primary contradiction in attempting to understand the  eld on which cultural property debates are enacted. The  uidity of the discourse comes up against the solidity of the object. The reverse is also true: the solidity of the discourse (for example, the language of law and the tropes or patterns of “cases” and “judgments”) comes up against the  uidity of objects that are always being interpreted and thus recreated. There is an ever-shifting line or “membrane” between discourse and (physi- cal) object, the membrane that itself creates “property.” As such, ownership occurs on this line. The valid owner is, or will be, the owner that is directing the vector of narrative discourses of desire and attachment.122 This membrane is mediated by power, by will, and by the process of human development, the exercise of will to move forward through the process of “overcoming” described by Friedrich Nietzsche in his philosophy.123 The question of “justice,” hotly debated, also performs this strange inversion from past to future, from the stern rules of owner- ship and contract that de ne what Nietzsche labels “prehistory” or “morality of custom” to a legal scheme of justice premised on the increas- ing wealth and security of the original owners of the object. Following Nietzsche, the superabundance of goods and (cultural) security means that certain communities can “afford” to “lose” the objects that used to repre- sent their most cherished possessions. On the other hand, as the Western world becomes richer, museums, heritage sites, and claims for cultural prop- erty are proliferating. It is possible that in the endless future of modernity, ownership of the past becomes ever more necessary. As a result of these 72 </page> <page sequence="25"> inherent contradictions and shifting attachments to objects, the  eld of cultural property analysis must be approached via a theory or philosophy that can address the  uidity of the con icts presented. The question of origin and that of narrative need to be addressed in a way that allows for the eruption as well as the recovery of contested objects. To return to the question presented by the case of the Parthenon Marbles, the foregoing analysis seeks only to explore some of the invest- ments and mechanisms that perpetuate the con ict, rather than to propose any particular solution. Property does not exist without the desire for possession, and it is that desire that must be understood.124 Cultural property is, strangely, more vulnerable to the vicissitudes of desire than other sorts of property, because it requires the memory of many people and the shared concern for a common future. The language of cultural property law makes the assumption that this sort of interest exists. But if it doesn’t? Artifacts are vulnerable to war, decay, and the depredations of collectors; they are vulnerable not to amnesia but to the dreadful forget- ting that underlies  ares of memory and memorialization. The debate(s) regarding the ownership of the Marbles are better, overall, than the alter- native to such debates. V. Conclusion The Parthenon is an iconic ruin. Fragmented, it still appears whole from an (essential) distance. For the modern person in Athens, the act of looking upwards has come to presume the experience of looking back- wards in time, to a structure that retains its outline and authenticity from the originary point of its coming into being until the present moment, and which must be protected, unchanged, into the future. As has been suggested above, however, this experience is  ctional, depending upon managed omissions and recently-acquired memories. This may not mat- ter. It is the  erceness of the gaze rather than the clarity of the vision that wins such claims. Memory is always forgetting itself. It exceeds its bound- aries, it knows impossible things, and it vanishes terribly and leaves noth- ing in its wake. As the romantic ideal collapses into the recognition of present arti ciality and fragility, one must take a position on the questions of these claims regarding the past: one must contemplate whether the Parthenon requires the pieces taken from it, and which claimants require 73 </page> <page sequence="26"> the ownership of the ruin(s) more. We look to law to resolve these questions for us, to make fragments into wholes, things and stories both, transformed into objects that can be claimed or owned rather than simply found, lost, or mourned. Simultaneously, however, arguments based around the possessive urge create a void around themselves, turn the full world of modernity, the world of forces and discourses, tactics and strategies, into a seeming emptiness. In part, this is because will creates a vacuum around itself of necessity, it requires a space in which to operate. In the most extreme formulation of the argument presented in this paper, we do not remember or own anything at all. To succeed in claims for ancient objects we must  nd a justi cation for owning an object that outlasts all memorable gen- erations of human life. By the time a legal or diplomatic claim is made for the “return” of some “property” by a “people,” the complex of desiring and storytelling, of self and object(s), present and past, that which is cre- ated by will and that which is denied or promised by “history” have all merged into claims of memory and attachment that sound like “I want” in full cry, or (its synonyms) “I deserve,” “I am entitled to,” “I reclaim.” To translate this cry into “justice” means to decode it, to  nd the engine that drives its tremendous power. In the philosophy of Nietzsche and the workings of memory, there is a beginning to this endeavour. In the Parthenon Marbles, like in all ancient artifacts, there is enough silence to make an end. * School of Law, The University of Reading.

As such, it includes arguments regarding artistic or aesthetic integrity, arguments regarding the merit(s) of context, and arguments of “the marbles are Greek and therefore belong in Greece variety.” As a position, it underlies many of the policies and documents generated by the United Nations, UNESCO, and the Council of Europe. 15 The grounds for the restitution of the Parthenon Marbles are as follows: Because the monument to which they belong, namely the Parthenon, is in Athens. Because in Athens the Marbles will be exhibited close to the Parthenon and within sight of it, and the visitor can form a complete picture of the temple in its entirety. Because they form an inseparable part of the monument — the symbol of Greek Classical civilization at its apogee. The restitution of the Marbles will restore the unity of the decoration and the architectural cohesion of the monument. Because the British have an obligation, not to Greece but to the cultural heritage of the whole world, to restore its symbol, the Parthenon, which is also the emblem of UNESCO.

From there it then moves around the long North and South sides of the building until the two sides of the procession meet at the East side. From the West side therefore, which consists of scenes of preparation, the pro- cession moves up the North and the South sides in rows of horsemen, chariots, various marshals directing the procession and youths holding the horses, elders, musicians, wa- ter-jar carriers, tray-bearers, and animals being led to sacri ce. The two arms meet at the ceremonial scene that takes place on the East side of the Parthenon. 32 The room is bare, colorless, dressed in polished stone, and set up in a counter-intuitive manner. The gallery is a long rectangle, which one enters in the middle of one of the long walls. The fragments from the West frieze are to the right, and then the North frieze occupies the rest of the long wall on the right and continues on the opposite (long) wall. On the left is the beginning of the South frieze, which also continues on the opposite wall. 33 Rather than using the long walls of the rectangle to display the long sides of the frieze, as it was found on the rectangle of the Parthenon, the display arranges the frieze so as to show, immediately, its culmination. Arguably, this decision is in keeping with Duveen’s insistence on “cleaning” the Marbles. At the time the Duveen Gallery was built, the Western eye arranged the Marbles as “art” rather than “artefacts.” Museums are now taking a dif- ferent approach. 34 St. Clair, supra note 26 at 53–55. 35 “James Stuart and Nicholas Revett, travelers who documented their visit to the Acropolis with drawings and descriptions published in 1787, were the  rst to identify the frieze as the Panathenaic procession, an integral part of Athena’s birthday festival.” Joan B.

He made no mention, how- ever, of the 160-m-long frieze, set high and in the shadows of the exterior colonnade. Without an ancient source to con rm what the ancient viewers saw in this frieze, modern interpreters have been free to reconstruct a meaning on their own.” Joan B.

A new, much larger Museum is currently planned. 47 Supra note 43 at  69. 48 “This new reading allows the full sculptural program of the Parthenon to be understood as a coherent whole: the west pediment shows the original contest between Athena and Poseidon for patronage of the city; the frieze commemorates the  rst military threat to Athens launched by Poseidon’s son Eumolpos and the virgin sacri ce that ensured victory for the Athenians. . . . Thus, the full sculptural program serves as a greater metaphor for the Athenian triumph over the Persians in 480 B.C., in short, the nexus of ‘saving the city’ from exotic outsiders and the preservation of Athens by and for the autochthonous 78 </page> <page sequence="31"> Athenians.” Joan B.

In this schema, time and will are indissolubly linked. 63 N.b. the question of the “individual” must be approached very, very carefully. Thus far I have used the term only insofar as Nietzsche uses it. For a discussion of the term and its possible meanings in modernity, See Tim Murphy, The Oldest Social Science: Con gura- tions of Law and Modernity (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997). In particular, the nexus between “individual,” “memory” and “future” is caught and questioned in the middle of the inversion or “overcoming” that society is presently in: 79 </page> <page sequence="32"> “Should we not let go of our memories? Should we not allow ourselves to be open to the future, and learn to live without the fantasy of security and paternity which the older other vision, which we can now see as a vision, held out, once, to us? . . . [W]e need . . . to be more sensitive to the rather peculiar character of the individualism which has been installed in our age, using the building blocks of so many half-memories, and to recognize that this modern individual- ism sits alongside epistemic and orientational attitudes and practices through which this same individual is effaced into the average man. The freedom of the individual is triumphant at the same time as the erasure of the institutional and epistemic presuppositions which for so long sustained the individual as a ‘meaningful’ project.” p. 34. 64 On the Genealogy of Morality, editor’s introduction, p. xix. 65 Susan Stewart makes this point in On Longing: Narratives of the Miniature, the Gigantic, the Souvenir, the Collection (Durham and London: Duke University Press, 1993). She traces the meaning of “longing” from the Oxford English Dictionary as longing for or after immortality (1713). She continues: “. . . [T]he location of desire, or . . . the direc- tion of force in the desiring narrative, is always a future-past, a deferment of experience in the direction of origin and thus eschaton, the point where narrative begins/ends . . . ” p. x. 66 Any sort of truth: political, historical, scienti c. “Truth” is a term that must be explored in some depth. M. Clark, supra, attempts to resolve the internal contradictions regarding “truth” in Nietzsche’s philosophy. 67 See Peter Goodrich, “Of law and forgetting: literature, ethics and legal judgment” in Law in the Courts of Love: Literature and other minor jurisprudences  (London and New York: Routledge, 1996), pp. 112–137. Goodrich makes the point that law resists (denies) its genre (literature), and through this “aspires to assume the modern character and quality of the discourse of fate.” (p.112). Fate cannot be argued with, it exists at no and at all times, and, working within the available personae and scenes of the law, it allows judg- ment without responsibility. Goodrich argues that the confusion and denial of genres is deliberate and disingenuous, and is a technique of forgetting that “must be correlated initially to the phantasm of an origin. Forgetting institutes an invisible and so absolute cause, a non-empirical source, an image or symbol of certitude . . . which memory can- not directly supply and yet which science needs as the most basic justi cation of its enter- prise.” (pp. 121–122). 68 The two basic modern treatises on memory and the ars memoria, as well as a growing  eld of legal analysis that derives from the techniques of literary and anthropological criti- cism, demonstrate that memory and forgetting have only recently been understood as primarily psychological states connected to “individual” psyches. Rather, memory served many communal, social functions. Among scholars, memory and learning or knowledge were indissolubly linked. Remembered (and actively remembering) texts identi ed mem- bers of a community to each other, and guaranteed their continued membership in that community. Mnemonic technique anchored rhetoric, and thus oratory, public argument and persuasion of all kinds. (Francis Yates, The Art of Memory; Mary Carruthers, The Book of Memory.) 80 </page> <page sequence="33"> 69 There is an interesting question here about the various senses that are used in memory and that underpin (different kinds of ) authority (even though mnemonics are a tool of rhetoric): the blind poet or storyteller, the sighted scholar who has committed a text so perfectly to memory that he can “read it into” the blank center of a page of commentary and marginal comments — the center of the page left blank by later commentators, so only those who had read and memorized — internalized — the text, could “read” the book. (Carruthers, The Book of Memory, “Chapter 6: Memory and Authority,” pp. 189– 220, see pp. 217–8.) 70 Raphael Samuel, Theatres of Memory, supra note 54 at viii: “‘resurrectionism’ . . . [was] . . . a history which aimed to give a voice to the voiceless and speak to the fallen dead.” 71 “[The Romantic era’s] idea of memory was premised on a sense of loss. It divorced memory- work from any claim to science, assigning it instead to the realm of the intuitive and instinctual. It pictured the mind not as a watchtower but as a labyrinth, a subterranean place full of contrived corridors and hidden passages. Instead of anamnesis, the recollec- tion that resulted from memory-training and conscious acts of will, imaginative weight fell on what Proust called ‘involuntary memory’ — the sleeping traumas which spring to life in times of crisis.” (Raphael Samuel, Theatres of Memory, p. ix.) 72 Jacques Derrida, “Part I: Mnemosyne” in Memoires: for Paul de Man (New York: Colum- bia University Press, 1989). See also, Peter Goodrich, “Of law and forgetting” in Law in the Courts of Love, supra n. 67. 73 The goddess of memory, who also represents wisdom and is the mother of the Muses 74 Jacques Derrida, Memoires, supra note 72 at 6. 75 Id., at p. 32. 76 “. . . [T]he ‘yes,’ which is a non-active act, which states or describes nothing, which in itself neither manifests nor de nes any content, this yes only commits, before and beyond everything else. And to do so, it must repeat itself to itself: yes, yes. It must preserve memory; it must commit itself to keeping its own memory; it must promise itself to itself; it must bind itself to memory for memory, if anything is ever to come from the future. This is the law, and this is what the performative category, in its current state, can merely approach, at the moment when ‘yes’ is said, and ‘yes’ to that ‘yes.’” Id., at 20. 77 Id., at  31. As will be seen below, resistance, af rmation, and truth converge in criticism that attempts to denude language of its generic (lyrical) and pseudo-historical character, that demands rigourous attention to the work of memory. 78 Id., at 10. 79 Id., at 34. 80 Id., at 22–24. 81 Id., at 25–27. 82 Derrida describes de Man’s de nition of “allegory” as “a sort of narrative (rather than historical) fable — or rather, that of a story which certain people know how to tell about something which, nally, is not historical.” Id., at 36. 83 Id., at 10. 84 Id., at 22. 81 </page> <page sequence="34"> 85 Id., at 30, quoting Paul de Man in “Anthropomorphism and the Trope in the Lyric,” which begins with a quote from Nietzsche. 86 Id., at 30, quoting Paul de Man in “Anthropomorphism and the Trope in the Lyric,” p. 262. 87 Id., at 30. 88 One could say, cynically, that in the modern/recent literature, memory becomes impor- tant again as the latest prey of modernity, the most recent “thing” to become post-mod- ern. 89 Cf.
