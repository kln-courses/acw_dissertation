<plain_text><page sequence="1">SCIENCE, MYTH, AND FICTION IN H. G. WELLS'S ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU ROGER BOWEN An old edition of Captain Cook's "Travels," fascinating middle-eighteenth century Atlas with abounding Terrae Incognitae, are vivid among the writer's memories. . . . and the pictures in a Wood's "Natural History" . . . gave him an inkling of evolution and a nightmare terror of gorillas. H. G. Wells, "General Introduction," The Atlantic Edition of the Works of H. G. Wells (1924), pp. xii-xiii. H. G. Wells's full-length science-romances, written at the beginning of his career, are distinguished by their domestication of fantastic hypotheses, such as extraterrestrial invasion, lunar flight and lunar civilization, time travel, and invisibility. Wells's strategy is always to "hold the reader to the end by art and illusion and not by proof and argument."1 In his own definition of the tradition to which he has con? tributed, one which includes the "Golden Ass of Apuleius, the True Histories of Lucian, Peter Schlemil and the story of Frankenstein," Wells asserts that the "living interest lies in their non-fantastic elements and not in the invention itself."2 Thus, in The Time Machine (1895), the Time Traveller's story is told in the dancing firelight of a late Victorian smoking-room, and debated by a group of representative men of their day (while the actual workings of the machine remain vague); the drama and tragedy of invisibility in The Invisible Man (1897) is played out against the peaceful villages and suburbs of Kent; in The First Men in the Moon (1901) the moonflight has its humble and accessible beginnings in [318]</page><page sequence="2">ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU / 319 another bucolic setting, while the Martian invasion in The War of the Worlds (1898) brings death and destruction to a familiar and finely observed southern English landscape. The Island of Dr. Moreau (1896), however, is an exception. It shows the least attempt to domesticate the fantasy, and provides us with none of the settings which allow the reader to get and keep his bearings. A "private gentleman," Edward Prendick, is the sole survivor of a shipwreck in the Pacific Ocean. He is rescued, close to death, by a trading schooner whose captain in turn abandons him when his vessel reaches a small island to deliver a cargo of wild animals. On the island, a certain Dr. Moreau, with an assistant, Montgomery, runs a scientific laboratory. Prendick is reluctantly taken ashore by the doctor and per? mitted to stay. The nature of the latter's work is at first unclear but seems to be a form of animal vivisection. In a series of horrifying episodes Prendick discovers that Moreau is actually engaged in experiments designed to create men from beasts. These schemes eventually fail and the would-be creator is killed by his creations. Prendick finds himself alone on the island at the mercy of the Beast Folk. He finds rescue even? tually and returns, like Gulliver at the end of the Travels, to his English home, his mind forever scarred. Except for the novel's short Introduc? tion where Prendick's nephew presents his uncle's manuscript and authenticates it in all but its "essential particular,"3 and the last chapter describing his return to something approximating civilization, the nar? rative is given over to the reliving of a nightmare, to what could be called a prolonged hallucination, set on a distant terra incognita in the Pacific Ocean. Moreau, therefore, separates itself from the body of Wells's science-romances as its protagonist is separated from the known lands and the traffic of men. The mythopoeic quality4 of Wells's scientific fantasies is, of course, grounded in his fascination with the theories of Darwinism: "For him the universe was the enigmatic cosmos of late-nineteenth century physics; animate nature was the slaughter and struggle for existence described by Darwin and Huxley; man was a species of animal, Homo Sapiens, of the order Primates, thrown up by an accident of evolution and forced to adapt to its environment or degenerate or perish."5 While this philosophical starting point informs in one degree or another all Wells's early experiments in the genre of science-romance, in Moreau speculation about evolution is at the heart of the narrative as it is not in the remaining novels. Wells does not, as he does in The Time Machine, present glimpses of possible evolutionary developments in the distant future, but spells out instead the incontrovertible essence of man, cutting across the barriers of past and future. There is no need to travel in time to find the appalling truth of man's condition; a journey in space, and in</page><page sequence="3">320 / BOWEN the present, is enough. The usual need in Utopian or dystopian fiction for displacement in time and space is thus only partly met, but the simple emphasis on spatial rather than spatial and temporal separation becomes the story's peculiar strength as Wells explores evolution, the primal ter? rors associated with the origins of man, and the spectre of devolution, on a small, uninhabited Pacific islet. The geography of Wells's third published novel is, perhaps, its most significant feature, and this readily emerges in a consideration of the novel's three generic bases: The literary, comprising mainly fiction and prose narrative, the mythic, and the scientific. II The story's literary antecedents have been faithfully catalogued:6 Rudyard Kipling's Jungle Book for "The Saying of the Law," where Wells turns Kipling's whimsy into frightening satire as his Beast Folk struggle to hold on to their new, "human," identity; Poe for variations on some of the more gruesome moments in The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym; Defoe for the archetype of the solitary castaway and the psychology of island isolation; Swift for the elements of travel fantasy and the unrelenting satiric thrust; Stevenson for the physical demonstra? tion of human duality from Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde; and, above all, Mary Shelley for Dr. Frankenstein's experiments in the creation of life. Even Shakespeare, "read at school. . . but not much of him otherwise,"7 suggests his influence with the figure of Dr. Moreau, a latter day Prospero, but an appropriately named practitioner of the black arts, a modern enchanter holding sway over another "mysterious island." Wells himself acknowledges the influence of Swift and, indeed, the modes of eighteenth-century prose satire are apparent elsewhere in Wells, from The First Men in the Moon (1901) to Mr. Blettsworthy on Rampole Island (1928). And we can also take Frankenstein: or A Modern Prometheus from Wells's own estimate of his literary pedigree, but with this last men? tioned work we are already moving into the domain of myth. In fact, the more the sources for, and the tradition behind, The Island of Dr. Moreau are explored the more difficult it becomes to separate cleanly the literary from the mythic antecedents. To simplify, there are two basic myths which lay the foundation for the bizarre story of Dr. Moreau: the myth of the island,8 the novel's particular "geography," and the myth of crea? tion or metamorphosis. In elaborating upon both these traditions Wells succeeds in merging the realms of mythology and science, and it is this final definition which gives the tale its stamp of originality and lends it such disturbing and powerful reverberations.</page><page sequence="4">ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU / 321 The classical myth which is the key to the kind of universe suggested by Wells on his Pacific microcosm is easily identified. It was Chalmers Mitchell who asked so despairingly: "must he choose the spell of Circe?"9 Indeed he had to, and did so in order to translate it into the new language of post-Darwinian science. In this translation, the work's first "metamorphosis," the reader encounters the most essential of the story's ironic reversals: from beast to man, and not from man to beast. Circe, skilled in botany, becomes Dr. Moreau, skilled in the science and chemistry of the human form. Prendick identifies the diabolical authority on the island in terms of the ancient myth of the enchantress with the magic wand and potion, until Dr. Moreau explains otherwise and the myth is revised for him and for us. In Wells's attempts to "give the utmost possible vividness to that conception of man as hewn and confused and tormented beasts,"10 and, as he explained on a later occasion, to convey the "aimless torture of creation,"11 he pursues this revision of Homer's story. The very notion of creation for him is an extension, in light of nineteenth-century evolutionary theory, of that ancient story of a perverter of human souls and an abuser of the human form. On Moreau's island beasts are translated, or partially so, to a higher level of creation by the deific Moreau, as man was created by God. Wells reduces the condition of mankind and the creation of the so-called order of the natural world, the very descent of man, to the indulgent whim of an amoral magician with certain skills in physiology and surgery, who has fallen under "the over? mastering spell of research" (p. 40). This magician can afford an oc? casional nod in the direction of his mythic pedigree: "The Satyr was a gleam of classical memory on the part of Moreau, his face ovine in ex? pression ... his voice a harsh bleat, his nether extremities Satanic" (p. 109). The transition from "spell" to "surgery," from magician to doctor, from Classical to Romantic myth, hinges on Mary Shelley's ex? perimenter, Victor Frankenstein. The relationship between the latter figure and Dr. Moreau is made clear in the crucial chapter, "Dr. Moreau Explains," where the exiled scientist identifies himself as the "first man to take up this question [of Plasticity] armed with antiseptic surgery, and with a really scientific knowledge of the laws of growth" (p. 90). He boasts that his science does not stop at "mere physical metamorphosis," but embraces intelligence and the power of speech. The figure created by Mary Shelley in 1818 had partaken of the Roman rather than the Hel? lenic version of the myth of Prometheus; the animator of clay (plasticator) rather than the martyred champion who stole fire {pyrphoros)}1 Frankenstein is a new "animator" for a new age, though reminiscent, in his ambition, of Faust and the tradition of the medieval</page><page sequence="5">322 / BOWEN alchemist. The clay in this case is animated by electricity, an idea derived from Mary Shelley's acquaintance with the theory and experimentation of Galvani and Volta. Wells takes the ruthless, single-minded quest of Dr. Frankenstein and recasts it for a generation weaned on the Darwin? ian revolution. He dispenses with the once popular notion of galvanism and concentrates on the biological sciences, thereby adapting existing materials and contributing to the evolution of a myth. With Dr. Moreau's amoral obsessions we can witness the clarity of the relationship and the continuity of the myth they share: "the study of Nature makes a man at last as remorseless as Nature"(p. 94). Wells's use of the island setting has its origin, then, with Homer's island enchantress. Her palace, her courtyards and gardens, are replaced by a simple stone structure, an enclosure or compound which contains a laboratory with a locked door. Wells's fondness for closed environments and the skill with which he can exploit them for effects of suspense and terror are evident in a number of his short stories13 but it is in "Aepyornis Island" (1894) that he encircles his drama with the ocean for the first time, as he does with Moreau, published a little over a year later. This setting is the common ground on which Wells so successfully cross fertilizes the scientific and the mythological, and his choice of insular en? vironment for both the short story and the novel has special significance in the context of the nineteenth-century science already emphasized. It might be said that the quest for the Blessed Isle, from Hesiod to Tennyson?"It may be that the gulf will wash us down, / It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles"?comes to a halt on the volcanic shores of the Galapagos Islands, that remote corner of the globe which provided for Darwin a redefinition of the species homo sapiens, man's links with the animal world and the laws which govern it. Freud offers a valuable perspective on the impact of Darwin on the psychological wholeness of man, in his essay, "One of the Difficulties of Psycho-Analysis" (1917). In it he describes the "cosmological," "biological," and "psychological" wounds inflicted on human identity by Copernicus, Darwin, and Freud himself, and the broad movements of thought these figures represent, the visions they illuminate, and the definitions of man they relentlessly sug? gest.14 Man's "self-love" staggers under the weight of dangerous knowledge: his notion of himself "at the centre of a circle," sovereign of the universe and of the earth, sovereign above the animals, and sure of the mastery of the ego "in its own house"?all in fragments, all ruthless? ly qualified. Freud suggests, then, a modern world of shattered con? fidence, and it is Darwin who holds the key to one aspect of this process of psychological erosion. In this light the blessed isle, that locus amoenus,</page><page sequence="6">ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU / 323 becomes an arena for struggle and survival; there is no more questing, only strife. A Utopian dream suffers translation into a dystopian night? mare. To Darwin, as to others before and after him, the first sighting of the Galapagos group brought to mind less than assuring associations: "The country was compared to what we might imagine the cultivated parts of the Infernal regions to be."15 Melville, who cruised among these islands in 1841 aboard the A cushnet, a few years after Darwin, describes their "Plutonian" landscape in his series of sketches, "The Encantadas," and declares, "in no world but a fallen one could such lands exist."16 Furthermore, he extends his hint of the region's mythic suggestiveness by bringing together a number of traditional responses to evil. The very islands themselves seem stricken and arrested, "caught in the air of spell? bound desertness," while the "dateless, indefinite endurance" of the giant tortoise suggests the powerful hand of some "penal, or malignant, or perhaps a downright diabolical enchanter." Melville sees, and senses, the underworld, the fall of man: "no voice, no low, no howl is heard; the chief sound of life here is a hiss." Both an animate and an inanimate creation seem caught in the spell of some Circe figure. These observa? tions are found in the first two of Melville's sketches, while the remain? ing eight trace the island's human history, and it proves to be a singularly horrifying one: murder, piracy, insanity, and enslavement. The entire archipelago becomes a microcosm of man's darker nature. The juxtaposition of scientific discovery and the fictional enlarge? ment of geographical and historical fact, in both Melville's and Darwin's accounts of the Galapagos, offers a useful preface to Wells's island parables. For "Aepyornis Island" and The Island of Dr. Moreau take their essence, more obviously so than any other of his science-romances, from the juxtaposition of Wells's own popular scientific journalism17 and his natural flair for the fiction of adventure. Most commentaries on Moreau have adequately taken into account the connections between the novel and journalism, but there is one short piece, not identified as Wells's until 1961, which may be especially pertinent because it suggests why Wells chose his island setting so deliberately. It is in a Saturday Review article entitled, "The Influence of Islands on Variation," that Wells displays his keen awareness of the unique patterns of variation found in the island environment, and his knowledge of Darwin's fellow biogeographer, Alfred Russel Wallace, author of that classic treatise, Island Life: or the Phenomena and Causes of Insular Faunas and Floras in? cluding a Revision and Attempted Solution of the Problem of Geological Climates (1880). The "special point," Wells says of his little essay, "is to suggest that isolation on islands has played a larger part in the evolution of the animals and plants than is usually attributed to it."18 He leads a</page><page sequence="7">324 / BOWEN discussion of the "law of variation . . . [as] a prince consort of the reign? ing law of inheritance," and begins with the proposition that there are two cases where "the abeyance of usual conditions of environment results in great variation." The first is the domesticated environment provided for animals, and the second is island life. Following Wallace's classifications {Island Life, Pt. 2, chap. 11, ff.) Wells enumerates the three island types, "biologically speaking": the "recent continental" islands like Britain; the "ancient continental" type, like Madagascar, and finally, "there are oceanic islands, isolated peaks rising from the beds of deep oceans, with no particular connection, geological or zoological, with any mainland." Such an island is Dr. Moreau's, or No? ble's Isle as Prendick's nephew identifies its ironic name on the British Navy charts he has consulted. In isolation of this kind, which has been brought about by sinking land masses, Wells continues, modification, variation, and the creation of new species would be greatly accelerated. Such a theoretical exposition readily lends itself to the elaborations of fiction. In the vast duration of geological time this island had become part of the greater evolutionary process; in isolation and secrecy a small stage is set, in the present time, for these anonymous mechanisms to become the operation of one man. The drama enacted on this island's "biological station" (p. 32) demonstrates metaphorically Wells's vision of Creation and the Fall of Man, of the conflict between Morality, the "artificial factor," and the Paleolithic Savage. Prendick, through his ex? periences, is enabled to rediscover for himself the import of man's origin, and the essence of the species, homo sapiens. But there is no treatise to write to record this discovery, merely the transcript of a nightmare which proves his education was devastating in its thoroughness: the descent of man and the ascent of the beast. That Wells probably had in mind the Galapagos and their significance is hinted at in the map references provided by Prendick's nephew which give the exact location for the loss of the Lady Vain and the final rescue of the lone scientist by a brig en route to San Francisco from Apia. They place Noble's Isle, therefore, slightly to the south and west of the nearest land?those "enchanted isles." The setting is doubly appropriate for the story told: an island of the "oceanic" type, volcanic, and close to the Galapogeian archipelago. Thus Wells followed Darwin and Wallace in their emphasis on the im? portance of island life in an understanding of the basic principles of evolution, that "mystery of mysteries." Sherwin Carlquist brings up to date Wallace's standard investiga? tion of the subject in his own Island Life: A Natural History of the Islands of the World. He has this to say about the distinguishing characteristics of island ecosystems: "Isolation, ecological opportunity, and to a lesser extent climatic moderation have, over long periods of time, created</page><page sequence="8">ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU / 325 remarkable designs. Untrammeled by the constant crosscurrents of migration, predation and competition, the smaller number of groups present on islands reveal patterns of evolution as in a laboratory. Islands are at the same time the experiment stations and the archives of evolution."19 Wells creates just such a vision of an ancient past and a projected future in Moreau; with this dramatic juxtaposition of "archive" and "laboratory" at the core of the narrative, Wells adds the mythic elements of Circe and Prometheus and infuses the entire fable with images of metamorphosis, creation, and degeneration. The demonstration of origin and the suggestion of a less than noble destiny are rehearsed in Wells's story, "Aepyornis Island." Using a fic? tional device familiar to readers of Kipling, he introduces us to a rough and somewhat insensitive cockney raconteur, who has the ear of a more sophisticated narrator. We learn of an expedition to recover the eggs of the Aepyornis or Elephant Bird, from Madagascar's southern coastal regions. Wells's island biology is accurate enough here; fragments of shell and even complete eggs from this recently extinct flightless bird are found precisely in this area. Wells leaves fact behind, however, when he isolates his modern man on a coral atoll off the Madagascan coast, after a shipwreck and the mutiny of his native bearers, alone with a live bird hatched from one of the eggs. The solitude which preys on him?"I tell you, Robinson Crusoe don't make near enough of his loneliness"20?is lessened by the companionship of the young bird, but "it was about the end of the second year our little Paradise went wrong." The small atoll becomes an arena for a conflict between two species, and the human representative is not loath to express his disquiet at the sudden reversal of supremacy: "A great gawky out-of-date bird! And me a human being?heir of the ages and all that."21 His struggle with the "damned anachronism" offers a change of perspective on man's sovereign position in nature and the fact of the collector's eventual victory, or survival, is no lasting comfort. Both man and bird match wits and strength on their tiny piece of land in the Indian Ocean; as the bird shows more and more the characteristics of human intelligence in its attempts to make this ter? ritory its own, so the human protagonist betrays increasingly his animal ancestry. The spectre of prehistory looms large and its present reality is stressed. The more complex island world depicted in his full-length novel of the following year enables Wells to develop this theme and illustrate a definitive reminder of human vulnerability, of man's insecure hold on the world of nature and on his own psyche. This erosion of human centrality is tracked and recorded through the entirety of Moreau; Wells's fictional strategy is to alert his readers at an early stage to patterns of change and metamorphosis. The Circe myth is thus enlarged; there is one group of spectacularly transformed</page><page sequence="9">326 / BOWEN creatures, but the victimization is eventually understood on a larger and more terrifying scale, until we recognize it as the basis of creation. This less than orthodox perspective on the descent of man should warn us of Wells's less than balanced use of his sources. Darwin, in The Descent of Man, had asserted: "Looking to the future generations, there is no cause to fear that the social instincts will grow weaker, and we may expect that virtuous habits will grow stronger, becoming perhaps fixed by in? heritance. In this case the struggle between our higher and lower im? pulses will be less severe, and virtue will be triumphant."22 Wells, with exuberant iconoclasm, challenges this speculation in Moreau and prefers instead to rest his hypothesis on the warning which Darwin saves for the very last paragraph of his monumental work: "with all these exalted powers?Man still bears in his bodily frame the indelible stamp of his lowly origin."23 Ill The story begins with disaster. The open boat with its three men which survives the sinking of the Lady Vain is Wells's first image of enclosure, and Prendick's first experience of isolation. The "mild tempered" narrator joins with one of his companions, Helmar, in an agreed plan to sacrifice one of their number, for sustenance, so that the other two may survive. The drawing of lots to determine the victim, and to secure the survivors, is a final and desperate attempt to deal rationally with the struggle for existence, yet, ironically, this gaming image suggests at the same time the fortuitous and the haphazard, the operating "prin? ciples" in the world of nature, in nature's creation and deprivation of life. Wells had concluded his article, "The Influence of Islands on Variation," with the illustration of the shuffling and dealing of a pack of cards to explain the relationship between the geological history of the globe and the plants and animals who succeed in establishing their "type" upon it. On the seventh day in the lifeboat a new and terrible world has dawned, one in which Prendick is prepared to participate. He is saved from committing cannibalism only by the fight which ensues between Helmar and the third sailor who fall overboard in their struggle, leaving Prendick alone. But he has already compromised his human identity long before the savage events on the island unfold. Delirious and close to death, Prendick is eventually picked up by the Ipecacuanha, a grubby trading schooner carrying a cargo of wild animals and captained by a superannuated Noah, the red-haired Davis. The ar? rival of this "ocean menagerie" heralds another new world, one which continues to rehearse the final island experience. Wells presents, as the more common survival narratives do not, more than one "threshold"; a</page><page sequence="10">ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU / 327 world outside the island is drawn first, a world in extremity. We ap? proach the microcosm of Noble's Isle via the open boat from the Lady Vain and the refuse-strewn decks of the Ipecacuanha. This first rescue scarcely allows Prendick to regain his civilized identity. Davis, foul mouthed and drunk, finds him an unwelcome additional passenger. Then there is Montgomery, oddly distant and morose, who proves to be in charge of the strange cargo. It is the latter who nurses Prendick back to recovery but refuses to accept gratitude, stressing the "accident" and "chance" of the event. The hints of atavism and the relentless processes of change evident in the aftermath of the first disaster, the sinking of the Lady Vain, emerge again in this new setting. The blood which Prendick did not drink in the lifeboat becomes the "scarlet stuff, iced" (p. 7) on board the schooner, administered by Montgomery; it tastes like blood and restores him. He later wolfs down his first solid meal shutting out the "noise of the beast" (p. 10), the "savage anger" of the caged animals on the deck above him. Montgomery himself, whose lip drops, who slobbers when he speaks, and whose clothes, when borrowed by Prendick, reveal a figure "rather large, and long in his limbs" (p. 10), does not exhibit perfection of human form. What seems to defy all the rules of anthropomorphism, however, is M'ling, Montgomery's assistant, whose misshapen body in? spires fear and hatred aboard ship and troubles the curiosity of the ves? sel's unscheduled passenger: "that black figure with its eyes of fire, struck down through all my adult thoughts and feelings, and for a mo? ment the forgotten horrors of childhood came back to my mind" (pp. 21 22). The gradual intrusion of a new and strange world is for Prendick a gradual change of consciousness, a remapping of mental territory. As his encounters with novel circumstances increase we see a steady encroach? ment of memory; there is more and more traffic between the "background" and "forefront" of his thoughts. Much in the way that an image of a barren island intrudes in the visual consciousness of the researcher in "The Remarkable Case of Davidson's Eyes" (1895) and blocks out normal perceptions, so Prendick seems to plumb levels of memory unknown to him or previously ignored by him. Part of this is the simple recollection of names and events from old newspaper stories (relating to the "Moreau Horrors"), but his response to M'ling, for ex? ample, at the schooner's rail, and his reaction to the Beast Folk once he is on the island, involve far deeper levels of memory. In sum, the entire period on the island, some eleven months, is for Prendick a ghastly ex? perience in race memory. He dredges up, and faces, the "shadow" on his soul. The composition of his mental world had begun to change drastically from the third or fourth day of his isolation, and he never</page><page sequence="11">328 / BOWEN recovered his original mental framework. He descends and returns, witnessing change, suffering change, and the outcome is psychic desola? tion. The capricious cruelty of the world which is gradually revealed to Prendick is sharply evidenced when both Moreau and Montgomery, and the ship's captain, refuse to take responsibility for him when the island is finally reached. Once again he is condemned to his "little hell," the open boat, now half-swamped and unprovisioned. "I prayed aloud to God that he would let me die" (p. 27), confesses the luckless Prendick. God does not anwer, but Dr. Moreau does and denies the plea. From the besotted and crude authority of Captain Davis the focus shifts to the white-haired, majestic command of Dr. Moreau, and from the chaos and disorder of Prendick's various shipboard experiences to the mystery of the island and its "inimical phenomena" (p. 85). Within moments of landing on the island's shores, the continuation of the story's mythic strategy is stressed with Montgomery's release of a cageful of rabbits: "Increase and multiply, my friends" (p. 33). This is a place where new life is born, where new patterns of existence are contrived. Like its near neighbor, the Galapagos group, this island is volcanic in origin, and from the evidence of the fumarolles, the hot spring, the thin spire of smoke which is a permanent feature of the landscape, and the "faint quiver" of seismic activity, the island is still young, geological? ly speaking. The hint of a geological time-bomb pairs effectively with the omnipresent biological threat, the triumph of the beast flesh. Wells does not indulge in the kind of dramatic demonstrations of volcanic power utilized in, for instance, Jules Verne's Mysterious Island or Fenimore Cooper's Crater.24 When the novel ends the island is still on the surface of the ocean, within the ken of the British Navy. The island's geological age is used on one occasion as a reminder of biological time. The topography is only vaguely outlined; it is a low lying, nondescript patch of land with only two important features, one man-made and one natural. Moreau's enclosure, where the maker pur? sues his craft, his "intellectual passion," is situated near the beach, while at the other end of the island there is a ravine peopled by a grotesque community of the half-made, crippled victims of the surgeon's knife. It is in the description of this sulphurous ravine that Wells allows the half formed and retarded in nature, a dormant volcanic rift, to symbolize the abortive experimentation of Dr. Moreau, and, in consequence, the un? finished, "rough-hewn" nature of man: Presently we came to trees, all charred and brown, and so to a bare place covered with a yellow-white incrustation, across which a drifting smoke, pungent in whiffs to nose and eyes, went drifting. On our right, over a shoulder of bare rock, I</page><page sequence="12">ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU / 329 saw the level of the sea. The path coiled down abruptly into a narrow ravine between two tumbled and knotty masses of blackish scoriae. Into this we plunged (p. 69). The scene is rich in literary and mythic analogy. Prendick is led down the path by his "ape-like companion" into "the central gloom," and a kind of Hades which bears comparison with Melville's descriptions of the Enchanted Isles, and reminds us also of Aeneas's descent into Hell. There is a moment of savage Swiftian humor when the creature ar? ticulates to the stupefied Prendick, "Home." The biologist from the halls of Gower Street "is aware of a disagreeable odour like that of a monkey's cage ill-cleaned," and if not to him then certainly to us the image of the Yahoo is implied. The whole island, its structure and fauna, is primeval; it is the past but it is also the present, and it could be the future. The movement in time suggested is both backward and forward, and these journeys are made without the agency of a machine. The movement toward the future is encapsulated in the novel's fourteenth chapter, "Dr. Moreau Ex? plains," based largely on Wells's article, "The Limits of Individual Plasticity," where biological and physiological metamorphosis is postulated. As he does in an earlier piece of journalism, "The Fallacies of Heredity," Wells makes a great deal of the "fanatical fatalism" to which generalizations about heredity may be pushed, and outlines the possibilities of manipulative surgery on the "raw material" of living be? ings and of "replacing old inherent instincts by new suggestions, grafting upon or replacing the inherited fixed ideas." In conclusion, Wells allows simply that the "artistic treatment of living things" is credible enough to be worthy of a place among "the things that may some day be."25 Dr. Moreau covers the same ground, but the ideas are colored and deepened, and made more terrifying. The shame that Prendick feels at their "mutual positions" should be viewed critically. This student of T. H. Huxley, a proponent of the theory that the "ethical progress of society depends, not on imitating the cosmic process still less in running away from it, but in combating it,"26 is pitted against a demonic figure, part enchanter, part alchemist, who is not troubled by ethics at all, and who identifies himself with the strife and cruelty of the cosmos, and with the "ways of this world's Maker . . . His laws" (p. 93). Though it may be possible to see Prendick as a "humanistic intellec? tual"27 alone in a strange and hostile environment the vulnerability of all the protagonists is ultimately stressed. Prendick's susceptibility to baser instincts, his demonstration of the "artificiality" of his moral education, have already been illustrated. However godlike Moreau may appear, and it is necessary to recognize the allegorical role he plays,28 he does in this chapter confess to the degree of his failure as a "deity," as a creator of</page><page sequence="13">330 / BOWEN life. The ravine holds sixty or more of these failures and there have been, we are told, many more. Moreau knows that "in the seat of the emotions" there are things he cannot control: "cravings, instincts, desires that harm humanity, a strange hidden reservoir to burst suddenly and inundate the whole being of the creature with anger, hate or fear" (p. 98) . In the latter part of his lengthy revelation of his past history, the nature and purpose of his life's work, periods of silence dot his monologue as the awareness of "the beast" dominates his thoughts (p. 99) . We see him, suddenly and surprisingly, defensive, unsure, even puz? zled. In the fluid, metamorphic world of this novel, no one stays the same, or can be clearly and consistently labeled in any tight allegorical scheme. Bernard Bergonzi correctly admits that Wells's attitude remains "calculatedly ambiguous."29 With "The Limits of Individual Plasticity" in mind can we attempt any kind of defense of Moreau's "sophistry"? Does Prendick's discipleship of Huxley's dual universe, of the primacy and viability of ethical progress, effectively lay a claim for moral cham? pionship in this debate? The guarded optimism of Wells's "Human Evolution: An Artificial Process," with its vision of possible emancipa? tion from the "deity of Natural Selection," the steady training of man's artificial factor "against the currents and winds of the universe,"30 seems a far cry from the final pages of a novel which succeeds in demonstrating the endless conflict between the instinctual and artificial in man. To bor? row a definition from Darko Suvin's analysis of The Time Machine, the "mutation of scientific into aesthetic cognition"31 involves a closing off of many of the intricacies of scientific debate in favor of a more dramatic and more accessible presentation. Though ambiguities do in? deed cloud the novel, the final vision has a bleak simplicity and unity about it. Two facts remain: Moreau perishes, his experimentation having proved a failure, and he lies on the pyre white and awful like some fallen titan; and Prendick survives, but lives thereafter in solitude, a lost and crippled soul. From the exposition of "Dr. Moreau Explains" to the novel's con? clusion we follow a series of changes and regressions which prove only the proximity of modern man to the age of unpolished stone. As these events escalate we can only look back and view with scepticism the argu? ments of both men; Dr. Moreau's monologue and Prendick's response to it represent a kind of island of intellection amid a frightening and primitive world. The "wild luxuriance" of the jungle beyond the walls of the enclosure holds more fundamental secrets than those kept within. Moreau's aspirations and Prendick's moral protestations seem alike hol? low and pretentious; both men are overtaken by forces more powerful than either of them.</page><page sequence="14">ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU / 331 While the focus shifts from Moreau back to Prendick we are told of another stage in the latter's deterioration; he becomes "habituated" to things which "had seemed unnatural and repulsive" (p. 106). However, he does hold back from an unfettered commitment to Moreau's New Jerusalem because he can see "no intelligible object" in his scientific quest (p. 123). Prendick would almost welcome the motivation of hate, but he sees only "carelessness," "wantonness," and "painful disorder" in Moreau's island kingdom. It is this vision which leaves the "perma? nent scars" on his mind. He recognizes how all the islanders, human and bestial, are "torn and crushed, ruthlessly, inevitably," in the wheels of a "vast pitiless mechanism" (p. 123). This recognition explains the demise of Dr. Moreau; his characterization shifts from deity to "mad doctor" in the tradition of Frankenstein, and he is "cut and shaped" along with everything else. Moreau's death occurs in the eighth week of Prendick's virtual cap? tivity. He is slain by the Puma Woman, the last "perfection" he at? tempted to create. The reluctant guest who had found allegiance impos? sible, either to Moreau or to Montgomery's "vicious sympathy" for the Beast Folk, but who had been identified by the Satyr as "one of the made," one who had been seen to bleed and weep, who had fled from the master's whip and revolver, now picks up those weapons and wields authority. He persuades the Beast Folk that Moreau has merely "changed his shape ... his body" (p. 133), and has not relinquished ultimate command over them. In fact, Moreau has gone the way of all matter. Habits, the habits of ten years, now begin to collapse, and Montgomery for one cannot endure this "jest" any longer. Like Pren? dick in the open boat, before and after the casual intervention of the Ipecacuanha, the former medical student is very close to a recognition of the universe as fundamentally absurd. He takes his leave, with the aid of alcohol, and makes sure that the vestiges of human habitation on the island, the enclosure and the boats, are consumed by fire. This symbolic purgation Prendick does not appreciate. He is now once again pursuer and pursued in an island population which will gradually lose what little human attribute was gained on Moreau's operating slab. He might have "grasped the vacant sceptre of Moreau, and ruled over the Beast People," but his tendency to "solitary thought" prevails over "courage," and he instead fulfills the prophecy of the Ape-Man by becoming one of the made: "When I awoke it was dark about me. My arm ached in its bandages" (p. 152). Accompanied by the Dog Man, a bizarre parody of Crusoe's Fri? day, for part of the time, Prendick tries to maintain his sanity and his safety. Wells returns us to an earlier phase of evolution, to a world of</page><page sequence="15">332 / BOWEN precise imperatives, unmasked and dominant. They have been there all the time, as the surviving lifeboat from the Lady Vain bore witness to, but on the wildness of the deserted island, their power becomes in? creasingly manifest. As Moreau's creatures kill one another off in a spasmodic, degenerating war, Prendick records the stages of the rever? sion which now overtakes human and animal life. Speech is the first mark of Moreau's artificially created nature to disappear; precise ar? ticulation disintegrates, finally, into "mere lumps of sound" (p. 160). Each day of those long ten months he goes in fear of new signs of "ex? plosive animalism" among the Beast Folk, and, more significantly, his own decline: "I am told that even now my eyes have a strange brightness, a swift alertness of movement" (p. 163). A remarkable series of evolutionary changes, social and anatomical, in reverse, is compressed into this time period. Rather like the rapid cinematic images, changing as the years clock by, remarked by the Time Traveller perched on the sad? dle of his machine, life passes before Prendick: from biped to quadruped; from smooth skins to abundant hair; from clothing to nudity; from monogamy to promiscuity; from constructed shelters to the natural protection of nature, and so on. But unlike the Time Traveller Prendick is part of this speeding decline; he has not the means to escape. There is no marvel of technology between him and the phenomena of social and biological history. The Time Traveller does participate in a sense when he stops his headlong journey, but Prendick's participation in a devolv? ing world never ceases. His escape from this "archive of evolution" does come eventually, as aimlessly as every other event recorded in the narrative?a lifeboat from the Ipecacuanha with its cargo of dead?and the island's physical reality finally fades from his sight, but its metaphysical reality never does. Prendick's nightmares constitute a heightened awareness, too aw? ful to bear in the society of men: "I could not persuade myself that the men and women I met were not also another, still passably human Beast People, animals half-wrought into the outward image of human souls, and that they would presently begin to revert. . . " (p. 170). The actuality of metamorphosis, as he witnessed it on the island, has passed from his vision, but the idea of it persists, and his perception of civilization is forever conditioned by that experience. Prendick's earlier failure to con? trol a balance between the "forefront" and "background" of his thoughts returns again, and so he consults a mental specialist as do Mr. Blettsworthy in Mr. Blettsworthy on Rampole Island (1928) and Dr. Finchatton in The Croquet Player (1936), men who experience similar vi? sions of the "worm in the bud." But the only satisfactory solution for Prendick, and it is only partial, is a spatial one, which brings us back to our first definitions of the novel. All the dramatic revelations about the</page><page sequence="16">ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU / 333 nature of homo sapiens take place in enclosed spaces, the lifeboat, the trading schooner, and the island, and so the little peace that Prendick can find, from his pervasive fear of "prowling women" and "gibing children," is not in London, "where the horror was wellnigh insupport? able" (p. 171), but "near the broad, free downland . . . under the wind? swept sky." He seeks solace in Nature's open spaces. But this change of environment by no means allows him to recover the sense of his centrality, the integrity of his own being?this is irreparably lost?but it does reopen for him the totality of life's mystery. He lives, he stresses, in hope and solitude, but the solitude, so fearfully understood and ex? perienced, must necessarily govern the hope. He does not return, as Moreau once taunted, to "collecting butterflies," but to astronomy and chemistry. These fields of knowledge give him the illusion of escape and hope. Like the man in Wells's "Rediscovery of the Unique," he has lit a match in the dark and "around him, in place of all the comfort and beauty he anticipated?darkness still."32 He suggests faith in science, a faith which his narrative has undermined. With the aid of Moreau's pas? sion for furthering the frontiers of knowledge, Prendick has been made privy to the secrets of human origin, "the animal within us" (p. 172), and to the aimless drift of creation, be it past, present, or future. In his science-romances Wells is stimulated by the accelerating spiral of discovery, in the biological sciences, and by the concomitant demonstrations of human vulnerability and alienation. So the match striker discovers that the mystery has widened, not narrowed. In The Island of Dr. Moreau Wells skillfully mines the resources of myth, adapts them for a new age, and above all, rediscovers the perfect topographical emblem for human isolation, the island, to show just how unspeakable life's adventure may well be. The "island with no name" is at once the world's beginning and the world's end.
