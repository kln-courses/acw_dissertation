<plain_text><page sequence="1">A COURSE OF STUDY IN OUTLINE FOR THE KINDER GARTEN GRADES OF TH E BIBLE SCHOOL. BY PROFESSOR GEOKGE W. PEASE, Hartford School of Religious Pedagogy, Hartford, Conn. ONE of the pressing problems of the church today is to provide for its Bible schools a course of study which shall be pedagogically con- structed, and at the same time adapted to the peculiar conditions under which the Bible schools must do their work. One of the most difficult parts of this problem is that which deals with the younger children in the primary departrtzent, and especially with those who are to be found in the kindergarten grades, ranging in age from four to six years. But whatever the course finally adopted, it must relate itself very closely to the characteristics, mental powers, and interests of the various periods of life, if it is to be productive of the best results in the development of Christian character. In suggesting, then, a course of study for the children in the kindergarten grades, let us note first some of the char- acteristics, mental powers, and interests of children from four to six years of age. A marked characteristic of this early part of the childhood period is the strength of the animistic impulse the impulse to invest inanimate objects with all of the attributes of personality. "Their powerful imagi- nation and strong feelings master them so that they do not distinguish clearly between the real and the imaginary, and until they are four or five often do not know that their dreams are not realities. The line between feeling, will, and intellect is hardly distinguishable. This confusion begins to clear up after five or six, but the stronger impulse to attribute to everything else the child's own feelings, or animism, is still present at seven, and falls away only slowly till adolescence." I Practically everything, even the most unpromising thingsfi come in for this warm, vitalizing touch of the child's fancy. Another characteristic of the period is the extreme suggestibility of the child. Dr. Small, in his extended study of the subject,2 comes to the conclusion that "in healthy children suggestibility is (I) a uni- versal condition, (2) high in degree, (3) largely within the control of anyone who knows the working of the child-mind." I ELLIS, PedagogicaS Setrzinary, Vo]. V, p. I 72. 2fiiig.s Volj IV, pp. I 76 ff. 369</page><page sequence="2">37o TEIE BIBLICAZL WORLD Somewhat closely related to this suggestibility of the child is the imitative instinct. The power of imitation and the power of imagina- tion form two of the most important factors in child-development, and both play a large part in moral and religious education. When we consider the strength of this imitative instinct in the child, and the alrilost hypnotic state of suggestibility in which we find hirll during the early part of childhood, the importance of his environment and of the suggestions which come to him from the teacher in the class and the parent in the home cannot be overestimated. During this period the imagination is extremelwr active, although children differ widely in imaginative power. Professor Burnham says,3 with reference to the individual differences in children iI] productive imagination: "With some children it rnay be necessary to check imagi- nation. With others the effort should be to develop it. lind it is well to remember that most children have sufficient imagination to vivify what is dull and prosaic to us. What ytou tell a child of wolves and bears, of tramps and robbers, of the dark forest and all-devouring sea, of giants, ogres, angels, devils and future punishment, is not apper- ceived in the dull prosaic way in which you tell it; but it grows appal- ling in that vivid ideal world in which it finds lodglllent. rhe whole subject of religious education especially should be studied in relation to the child's productive imagination." The imagination in children needs the support of sense-perception. For this reason the teacher should not hesitate to use objects, pictures, rough drawings, or any form of illustrative material which will aid the child to visualize the scene as it is presented to him verbally in the story. There are two other characteristics which should he noted: the child's selfishness, and his fears. All the impulses of the child are centered in self and the satisfaction of its mrints. While we cannot expect to make unselfishness a strong characteristic in young children, still our course of instruction should be planned so as to provide for a natural development of whatever germs of altruism may be present. Again, young children are naturally fearful. *RTith children under six, fears due to real objects are much more numerous than imaginary fears; these latter increase in nurllber as the child grows older. In this case knowledge and faith will help to overcome much of the natu- ral fearfulness of the child. With reference to the interests of the period one of the earliest and strongest is that in the causal idea. Miss Davis finds4 that the fields 3Pedagogical Serozinary, Vol. II, p. 223. 4 Child Shxdy Montfily, I 896, pp. 226 ff.</page><page sequence="3">JKI9JDERGARTE9J STUI)Y FOR BIBLE SCGOOL 3 7 I in which interest in the causal idea is shown are natural phenomena, motion, animals, and religious objects. The field in which children find the earliest and best opportunity for the development of this interest is that of nature. The theological interests and ideas of young children are an odd patchwork, the " patchwork being due to the heterogeneous sources of the child's information, his own observations of the visible world on the one hand, and the ideas supplied him by what is called religious instruction on the other." Professor Earl Barnes shows5 that young children under six "accept what they have been told without question or comment, recasting their theology, how- ever, into forms that appeal to their experiences and their modes of thought " Two of Professor Barnes's conclusions have reference to the period we are discussing: (I) If young children are to be taught a theology, it must have an anthropomorphic and realistic form We may teach that God is a spirit, but the child's mind at once invests him with a form and human attributes. (2) Since pictures furnish so much of the imagery with which they deal, children should be surrounded with worthy pictures. With regard to the rtlental powers, the powers of perception are the first to develop. Young children are interested in perceptions what they see, hear, feel, and taste---rather than in conceptions concerning the qualities, relations, classification, and meaning of all these images of the senses. In attempting to understand thoughts presented to them, they translate everything so far as possible into terms of sense- experience, and their ability to understand these thoughts when pre- sented is largely dependent upon the development of their perceptive powers, and the extent of their sense-ideas. The memory is active, but it is a memory for things and concrete facts. Imagination is strongly active, but it is crude and undeveloped, needing the sup- port of the perceptive powers. The thought-powers are comparatively undeveloped. Professor Earl Barnes says6 that one of the marked characteristics of the young untrained mind is that "it thinks in bits, pieces, fragments. Lacking continuity, it is easilv played upon by suggestion, and goes off along lines of associated ideas. If one could have a map of the ground over which the mind of an ordinary ten- year-old child travels during the forenoon in school, it would be at many points of the course miles away from the route laid down by the curriculum and traveled over by the teacher." 5PedazogicaS Seminary, Vol. II, pp. 442 ff. 65Sdies in S:dzgsation, Vol. I, p. 264.</page><page sequence="4">372 TEE BIBLICAZL WORLD This is perhaps even more true of the very young child in the Bible-school session. During this period, then, the teacher, while not neglecting to lead the mind to a definite understanding of definite truths, should endeavor to teach as much as possible by suggestion on the one hand and by exalnple on the other. As conscience plays but a small role in connection with moral action until about nine years of age, and little then until thirteen years of age, the teacher should not appeal to it nor rely upon it as an important factor in her work. The foregoing presentation of some of the characteristics, powers, and interests of the young child, together with the fact that the earliest ideas which he gets of God ordinarily center in his creative activity, the child envisaging God as a great being, something of an enlarged father, who is the great world-worker, capable of doing all things, seems to call for the presentation to the child during the first two years of Bible-school instruction, (i. e., from four to six years of age) of the creative aspect of God's nature. lthis is the simplest and most easily grasped aspect of God's nature, which in itself would indicate its adaptability to the child. Caird says7 that " the conceptions of Natural Theology, the idea of God as the Creator, Preserver, Moral Governor of the World, alld of the attributes of Power, Wisdom, Goodness, and so on, with which he is invested, do not seem foreign to our intelli- gence; for they are based on human analogies, and even where they transcend all finite parallels they can be represented to our minds as only an indefinite extension of human qualities. Ordinary thought, in other words, finds no impossibility in representing to itself a personality who is simply a magnified man." The child should be brought into touch with nature at first hand where possible, God as seen in his works being the guiding thought for the teacher in the presentation of the lesson material. Nature should be presented directly as the handiwork of God, without any of the sentimentalism so often associated with nature-study. " ln the beginning God created the heavens and the earth." "The heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament sheweth his handiwork." As then, so noW, the world of things is first, and "in the beginning" of the child's religious development the "heavens and the earth" are the elements which first appeal to him, and through which he can get his first glimpse of the Creator, of the "glory of God." If through the use of this nature Inaterial we can impress the child with somewhat of a sense of God's power, wisdom, love, and rule, he will just as surely 7 EandamentaS Adeas of Christianity, Vol. I, pp. 56, 57.</page><page sequence="5">KIXDER GAZ R TE1!J S TUD Y FOR BIBLE SCffO OL 373 react with reverence, trust, love, and obedience as will his brain react light when the optic nerve is stimulated, or sound when the auditory nerve is excited. An outline of a suggested course of study follows, together with a number of lesson plans showing how a topic may be developed, and a list of a few books helpful to teachers and pupils ill these two grades. It is believed that such a course of study is in harmy with the characteristics mentioned, is adapted to the mental powers, and will appeal to the religious interests of the young children. In Grade A the child is shown the love of God in providing for all the needs of all his creatures, and in Grade B he is shown that all things are co-operat- ing with God in this work of providence. The purpose of the two- years' course will have been accomplished if the children receive the idea that God is a God of power, wisdom, and love, and if a desire is created in them to co-operate with God, to become "workers together with him."

We have learned about the creating of the world, the trees and the flowers, the fish of the sea, the animals of the field, the birds of the air, and finally of man himself. For the next few Sundays we are to learn about how God in his love and wisdom provides abundant food for all of his creatures upon this {'big round ball on which we live." Preparation: Question the children about what they need to make them grow tall and strong. Sunshine, and pure air, and esercise. Yes, all of these and plenty of good food. Nothing can grow without food. Today our story will tell us how God provides food for the trees and plants, and what they do to get this food. Presentation: Present the story matter in the following detail: I. The food in the earth: (a) The food stored away in the rocks and hills. (b) The crumbling rocks Make soil. (c) The seeds are planted in this soil. (d) The rain prepares the food for the plants. 2. The food in the air: (a) Some food the plants need is not in the soil. (b) This food is stored away in the air. (c) The winds blow the air about so all can get this food. 3. The plant seeking food from the earth: (a) The sun and rain awaken the plant to life. (h) It begins to send out tiny roots. (c) These go in all directions seeking the food in the earth. (d) These rootlets are little mouths which drink in the liquid food they find in the earth. 4. The plant seeking food from the air: (a) The seed sends out roots into the earth it also sends out stems and leaves into the air. (b) These leaves act like lungs and breathe in food which they find in the air. (c) The wind constantly changes the air and brings more food. Suggestions for developing the story and using the illustrative material: Begin the story by referring to the previous topic, the story of creationO God knew that all living things would need food, so when he made the svorld he stored away an abundance of food for every living thing. In telling about the rocks crumbling and making soil, speak of the com- bined action of water and frost; perhaps some of the children have hadi experiences with pitchers of water or milk which have been broken by being frozen. The rain preparing the food dissolving the mineral food substances-may be made ciear by dissolving a little sugar in water. When the story of the plant seeking food in the earth and air is told, shos tO the children the roots and leaves of the plants which have been prepared, calling attention to the great number of these roots and leaves, and to the way in which they go out in all directions in their search for food in the earth and air. Show the pictures, and give the class the thought that the strength and size of trees, and the beauty and fragrance</page><page sequence="8">376 IEE BIBLICAL WORLD of the flowers, are made possible because God has provided an abun- dance of the right kind of food for them. Ask the children a few simple questions, the answers to which shall express the main elements of the story, and encourage the children to talk freely about what they have learned. Then repeat to the class the verses " Waiting to (Grow," and finally give the memory verse and have the class repeat it, but do not try to have it committed to memory at this time. Deszred resuZ!s.
