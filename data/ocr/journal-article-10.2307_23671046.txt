LAMBERT The University of Birmingham ANCIENT MESOPOTAMIAN GODS SUPERSTITION, PHILOSOPHY, THEOLOGY* The Sumerians organized their gods, which were deified natural forces as conceived, into a sgstematic panthéon for a land of city states. This continued with modifications under the succeeding Babglonian civilization, which was politically unified. The process of identifying originally distinct gods of similar attrihutes continued unlil some scholars identified ail major gods with Marduk in a kind of monotheism. Relies of other Systems occur in the worship of mountains and rivers, and in southern Iraq itself the concept of deity spread from the god himself to his accoutrements, abode and city. Les dieux de l'ancienne Mésopotamie : superstition, philosophie, théologie Les Sumériens organisaient leurs dieux, conçus comme des forces naturelles déifiées, en un panthéon systématique qui conve nait à un pays composé de cités souveraines. Cette situation se maintint avec quelques modifications dans l'Empire baby lonien, qui était unifié politiquement. Le processus d'identifi cation des dieux, distincts à l'origine mais avec des attributs similaires, se poursuivit jusqu'à ce que certains érudits eussent assimilé tous les dieux importants à Marduk dans une sorte de monothéisme. On trouve dans les textes des allusions à d'autres systèmes pour ce qui est de l'adoration des montagnes et des rivières, et dans le sud de l'Irak, la notion de divinité s'est étendue du dieu lui-même à son équipement, son temple et sa ville. * Texte initialement prévu pour le numéro thématique de la RHR, « Qu'est-ce qu'un dieu ? » (4/1988).

The area "Mesopotamia" is wider than the area I shall deal with mostly, which is the terrain roughly between the modem Baghdad and Basra. This small area was a cultural powerhouse in the ancient world, Sumerian in the third millennium bc, Babylonian in the second and first millennia. The terms "superstition", "philosophy" and "theology" have been delib erately chosen as raw, crude terms to avoid a powerful terminology which would take over the subject by imposing its own concepts on the discussion. By "superstition" the emotional content of religion is meant ; "philosophy" is used to refer to the rational element in religion (with an implicit objection to those who might wish to assert that abstract thought began with the Greeks) ; and "theology" refers to the amalgam of these emotional and rational elements. The area concerned, the southern end of the Mesopotamian plain, is not particularly hospitable for human habitation. It is watered by the flooding of the Tigris and Euphrates in the late spring and early summer, but for most of the year is dry, lacking any useful rainfall, and naturally devoid of trees and most plant life, apart from the marshes adjacent to the Persian Gulf. In summer the climate becomes unbear ably hot, while the winter is chilly. The main natural resources were clay, since it is an alluvial plain, and reeds, which grew especially in the marshes. There is no local source for metáis, and not much useful stone is within reach. Yet this area sprang ahead of the surrounding régions in material culture at about the end of the fourth millennium bc and remained a cultural leader until the spread of Hellenism after Alexander. The reasons can only be guessed, but the inhospitable terrain may be one of the factors. After 3,000 bc there was little village settlement, towns composed most of</page><page sequence="3">Ancient Mesopotamian gods 117 the places where humans lived. One factor in this development was certainly the need for the mass organization of human labour to irrígate the cultivable land as the flood rose. The digging and maintenance of canals (the latter especially as the flood rose) required central direction within each city or group of cities. In turn the cities resulted in a specialization of crafts that would have been impossible or unlikely in a village culture. Wealthy government of a village culture could of course provide resources for craftsmen supplying luxury items, but the early Sumerian city states provided the bases for both material and intellectual developments. Furthermore, there is no trace of tribal organization. The cities proved melting-pots for whoever lived there. From the times of the earliest surviving knowledge Sumerian city governors were involved with religion ex officio. The largest buildings in each city were the temples, built and maintained by the governments of the cities. In each temple there was a deity who was its owner, and that god in the most important temple in each city was considered the owner of the city. In practice he or she owned land around the city, employed labour (both free and serf) to work the land, to look after domestic animais, and to engage in ail the various arts and crafts of which the temple had need. Thus the temples were not simply places of worship, but were large économie organizations, and in this sense could be compared with Medieval manors. The very name reveáis the concept. The Sumerian word for temple was é "house", the same word as used for any human's house. And this anthropomorphic concept extends much further. The chief deity of any temple was not the only occupant. There was his or her spouse, their children and, sometimes, other relatives, then their servants and officiais, ail considered divine. As an extreme, in the temple of Marduk, city god of Babylon, it is known that during at least the period c. 1500 to c. 300 bc. Marduk had four divine dogs named "Snatcher", "Seizer", "He got it" and "He howled", and his wife</page><page sequence="4">118 W. G. Lambert Zarpânïtum had two divine hairdressers1. The Sumero-Baby lonian temple was a divine court modelled on human courts. According to local mythology the human race had been created by the gods to relieve them of the hard labour of producing their daily bread. This practically meant that the government had to supply meals to statues of the gods twice daily, and had to clothe these statues, periodically providing new garments. In addition other items of personal possession such as seals and jewellery were supplied, and everything had to be of the best. Henee the need for fields, workers, skilled and specialized craftsmen, workshops, etc. So far as practicable temples were self-supporting, though rulers regularly made personal gifts, and booty of war often found its way to the gods. It was the duty of the ruler to keep watch over the temples and to take such action as might be necessary to ensure that they prospered. The concept of the divine court not only replicated human courts, but one may suspect it had served another purpose in prehistoric times. As will be explained shortly, each city needed the help of the whole panthéon of gods, and the divine court provided the means of keeping alive the cuits of gods within each city which otherwise might have sufïered attrition and have died out. This system of city supported temples was practically the concern of the rulers. The temples were not places of communal city worship. Access to the actual temple building housing the divine statues was highly restricted, and only certain of the temple craftsmen e.g. were allowed inside. So while the ordinary citizens would certainly be well informed about the major city deities in the temples and could share in the spirit of the major festivals, their own religion was something sepárate, to which we shall return. In fact the officiai city cuits were from the beginning largely dominated and developed by theologians. Sumer had been a land of city states traditionally, yet eulturally unified 1. CT, 24, 16, 19-22 and 15, 11-12 and duplicates.</page><page sequence="5">Ancient Mesopotamian gods 119 in language and religion. Thanks to the invention of writing at the end of the 4th millennium bc it is possible to know something of the concepts held of the Sumero-Babylonian gods, and so to note how sytematic was the panthéon as a panthéon. There is virtually no duplication in the Sumerian city patron gods, despite the city state organization of the country and the fréquent intercity warfare. Since each city could only prosper with the co-operation of a whole host of différent gods, one is forced to the conclusion that in pre historic times there had been a kind of ecumencial conférence in which it had been worked out how the major gods could each be head of one city, so that so far as practical ail the major deities would be thus honoured. The other gods traditionally worshipped in each locality were then worked into the cuits of the major city gods. The number of différent names of gods and goddesses is in the thousands, but that does not mean so many sepárate deities. The moon god was called both Nanna and Suen or Sîn, but there was only one moon god, and there were in fact other less used names by which he is on occasion called. However, ail the better known gods and goddesses pertain to particular parts and aspects of nature as known and con ceived by the Sumerians and Babylonians. There was a god of heaven as a cosmic location, a goddess of the earth, both a god and goddess conceived in various sources as ruler of the nether world. The sun, moon and Venus were also considered deities, the first two maie, the third, as in Classical antiquity, female. However, most stars, constellations and planets were thought of as heavenly stations of deities with other major abodes elsewhere. Occasionally mistakes were made, and since they held that ail rivers and springs drew on a vast subterranean lake, there was a deity presiding over that cosmic area. Cosmic functions and processes were also rep resented in the panthéon by deities concerned with them. There was a god of the storm, more than one deity of cereals, a god of cattle, and various deities concerned with the human</page><page sequence="6">120 W. G. Lambert crafts : of dairy farming, of brewing, weaving, etc. It would seem that there was no aspect of the universe as they knew and conceived it for which there was not at least one patron deity. That those with obviously greater cosmic importance, such as the goddess of the earth, are more important than those concerned with human crafts, such as weaving, may imply both the strength of a millennia-long tradition and common sense on the part of the ancient theologians. Thus the officiai panthéon of Sumer and Babylon is easily seen as the outcome of reflection on the universe : these ancients were surrounded by forces of nature, real or imagined, which they identified as persons of superhuman power. There was always some ambiguity about the precise relationship of the deity to the aspect of nature, whether, for example, the sun god was in very fact the actual fiery bail moving across the sky, or whether he was not of human form, living in a palace and directing the actual solar body in its daily motions from a distance. Probably they were not so conscious of such problems as we are. Certain developments in the understanding of this panthéon can be observed over the course of history, and these are revealing for the ancient conceptions of the gods. The most conspicuous one, which continued ail down history, was the outcome of taking an overall view of the gods of ail the cities. Just as the Greeks tended to identify foreign gods with the nearest one in their own religion, so Sumerian and Babylonian thinkers identified similar gods as judged by their attributes though they were entirely sepárate in their cuits and in their names. Obviously the sun god Utu of Larsa was the same as the sun god Samas of Sippar, but the process went beyond such undeniable identities and proceeded to equate gods and goddesses which were only similar in certain but not ail of their attributes. Thus Ningirsu of Lagash, Ninurta of Nippur, and Zababa of Kish were alike considered the chief son of Enlil, and were so identified, but so far as knowledge is available it would seem that in the earliest</page><page sequence="7">Ancient Mesopotamian gods 121 known times they were in other aspects by no means identical. In some cases, such as with the god of a big town and the gods of nearby smaller towns, it may be suspected that power politics resulted in the major god of the big town swallowing up the smaller gods of the neighbouring smaller towns. Marduk of Babylon became identified with Tutu of Borsippa. Thus by both theological thinking and by the power of priests of major temples the total number of différent gods was diminished over the centuries. One practical resuit of this was an increase in the names of the major gods. A name was not merely an identification tag, but had meaning, either the actual philological meaning of the word or combi nation of words, or a meaning extracted from the name by what we would consider bogus philology. Names were split into syllables and were then interpreted from the many Sumerian monosyllabic roots, many of which were homo phones of other Sumerian roots with totally différent meanings. The System was sufïiciently flexible that almost any desired meaning could be extracted from a name by this method. Thus each name had one or more meanings, which enshrined theological truth about the god to whom the name belonged. In the later second and in the first millennium Marduk had fifty names, the total consisting of his own names and epithets, then those of other gods whom he had absorbed by being equated with them by the theologians. The final step in this process also involved Marduk, who by the late second mil lennium had become head of the panthéon. Some theologians took the final step of identifying ail the major maie deities of the panthéon with him, so that a kind of monotheism resulted. However, his spouse Zarpânïtum and ail the other goddesses (perhaps conceived as identified with Zarpânïtum) remained as sepárate beings, and presumably démons also retained their identities. However, belief in a devil or démons has not been held to invalídate claims to monotheism on the part of major world religions of the Christian era. Before Marduk achieved headship of the panthéon there</page><page sequence="8">122 W. G. Lambert were other concepts of organization within the panthéon. So far as our knowledge goes back there had always been more and less important gods, so judged either from their cosmic significance, or from the prestige of their cities, or from a combination of both. From the end of the third millennium to the end of the second millennium there was a committee of top gods who exercised power, in a sequence which also illustrâtes their concept of the physical uni verse. An (Sumerian) or Anu (Babylonian) bore as name the Sumerian noun "sky", and that was his sphere. He was a kind of président of a socialist state: nominal head but not wielding day-to-day power except in emergencies. Between heaven and earth there was a gap in which human activity took place. The god of this space was Enlil. He lived on earth in his town Nippur and so concerned himself with human activity, being the most important god for the human race. The earth itself was considered female, presumably as the récipient of the fertilizing rain sent down by father heaven, and a third member of this committee was the Mother Goddess, known by a variety of names: Ninhursag, Nintu, Arûru, and Bëlet-ilî. Her position in the top committee is not invariable—she can be lacking—but the reason for her position is clear. She occurs below the space in the universe in which humans operate. The final member of the Committee was Enki (Sumerian) or Ea (Babylonian), both names of unknown meaning. He was god of the subterranean lake, called Apsû, from which ail springs and rivers draw their water. Thus the second-millennium committee of three or four was replaced by a single head in the first millennium. But generally there was a remarkable conservatism about the Mesopotamian gods. They remained in the same temples over the millennia, since the temple sites were holy and could not be moved. Only the total decline of a city could resuit in a cuit dying out. Within any cuit, however, there could be major changes over the centuries in the courtiers and other minor gods. Each deity was présent in the temple in a cuit image. The</page><page sequence="9">Ancieni Mesopotamian gods 123 majority of these were, it seems, anthropomorphic, though some may have been of composite monsters. In the second and first millennia these statues were made of wood, dec orated with precious metal and precious stones. At least to the intellectuel Babylonians their religion was not a crude image worship. The statue was conceived as a less than permanent abode of the divine essence. When a new statue was made or an old one repaired it was put through a series of rituals which resulted in the divine presence taking up its abode in the statue, and when a statue was seriously damaged or worn, it was believed that the divine presence was withdrawn. Ail this applied only to the temple statue. Other représentations of the gods were also made, some were indeed massproduced in clay figurines, but these were not the very gods, and did not go through the rites of vivification. The question has been raised whether there was not something less developed behind this highly sophisticated scheme of gods as aspects of nature. So far as the organization of the gods in city temples is concerned the earliest surviving evidence merely confirme that no major changes took place over history except in the organization of the gods into a panthéon, and except where cities completely died out and ceased to be inhabited. There have been suggestions, however, that the anthropomorphic représentations were preceded by a theriomorphic stage. A. Spycket and T. Jacobsen have been the main contenders for views of this kind2. In historical times gods had symbols by which they were generally known, and Jacobsen has argued that these are survivais of a pre-anthro pomorphic stage of religion. In the historical eras the functions of these symbols, which may be manufactured objects or natural things in whole or part, is well known. First, the major temple statues were so holy that they were not available 2. A. Spycket, Les statues de culte dans les textes mésopotamiens des origines à la Ir° dynastie de Babylone (Cahiers de la Revue Biblique, 9), Parie, 1968 ; T. Jacobsen, Toward the Image of Tammuz and Other Essaye on Mesopotamian History and Culture, Cambridge, Mass., 1970, p. 1-38.</page><page sequence="10">124 W. G. Lambert for many purposes for which divine presence was needed. In a court, for example, oaths were taken in gods' names, and a presence of the god in some form was essential. A model of the appropriate symbol served instead of the statue. Thus for Marduk, a spade was the symbol and no doubt something more elabórate and expensive than a workman's spade was made, but we know that oaths on particular occasions were taken by the Spade of Marduk. Secondly, in art it was impossible for the most part to distinguish anthropomorphic gods or goddesses, and especially in small scale art. Thus on seals, if one wanted the presence of the moon god depicted, it was usual to put a lunar crescent, which was technically very simple to engrave, and was very easily recognised. Furthermore, it is known that down the course of history at least a few deities changed their symbols. The sun god Samas was identified by a saw, presumably a symbol of justice, from c. 2300-1600 bc, but simultaneously by a depiction of the solar dise, but only the latter is used on boundary stones c. 1400-1000 bc. The goddess Ishara was represented by a viper c. 1800 bc, but by a scorpion c. 1400 1000 bc. Some of these symbols occur in prehistoric art, so that, no doubt as symbols, they had great antiquity, but it is not possible to argue that therefore they attest a pre anthropomorphic stage of religion. Supporting evidence is lacking. Spycket offers fuller arguments: (i) that no actual statues have been found from before 2000 bc which are certainly statues of deities, (ii) that in third-millennium texts statues of rulers are mentioned, but never statues of gods. The lack of certain examples of third millennium divine statues, if archaeologically assured (opinion is perhaps not uniform), can be explained either by the accidents of dis covery, or by this and two other factors. It is known that divine statues were richly adorned with precious metal and stones, so plunderers would be tempted to destroy them for their materials or to take them, and if the custom of later times of making the statues from wood prevailed already in</page><page sequence="11">Ancienl Mesopotamian gods 125 the third millennium, then they would not of course survive in the wet soil of southern Iraq. The lack of mention of divine statues in texts is not significant since after 2000 bc, when the use of statues for gods is not in dispute, there is a similar lack of mention of the physical objects. Kings speak of "the god", etc. and almostnever allude to statues3. Spycket's further suggestion that when the Early Dynastie rulers of Lagash state that they "fashioned" a named deity it means that they fashioned a statue of themselves and put it in the temple of the named deity, while grammatically just possible, has not found favour with Sumerian scholars, and would only be justified if it were known that these rulers did not have statues of their gods made. Though the evidence for a pre-anthropomorphic stage of Sumerian religion is at présent unconvincing, there is evi dence for forms of religion which seem to be survivais from a period before the extreme systématisation which charac terises Sumerian and Babylonian religion. Two kinds of source supply such information, incantations and personal ñames. The occurrence of this oíd material in incantations is explained from the nature of the texts. They were magie spells, and their efîectiveness depended on the precise form of words. Thus they should not have been altered if they were to be used successfully. So they preserve ail kinds of archaic matter which does not occur in e.g. hymns and prayer to gods. Many personal ñames have a divine ñame as one element, so that their study is important for the history of religions. Also they corne from the whole spectrum of ancient society, while officiai religion was the preserve of the priests and the ruling classes. In this connection it must be stressed that there is no evidence for popular religion among Sumerians and Babylonians being concerned generally with a totally dif férent panthéon from that of state religion. Though the forms 3. See The Assyrian Dictionary of the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago, vol. 7, I and J, Chicago and Glttckstadt, 1960, where the seventh meaning of ilu *god' is 'image of a deity'.</page><page sequence="12">126 W. G. Lambert of worship were of course on a much humbler scale, at the nitch at home, or at the street corner shrine, the personal ñames of workers generally attest the same gods as are known from the city panthéons. In certain cases, however, there is reason to hold that some of these personal ñames were of north Mesopotamian origin, and attest to forms of religion there, where the Sumerian System did not reach. The first noteworthy matter from this material is that the concept of the gods as aspects of nature extends where it does not in officiai Sumero-Babylonian religion. The Sumerian Iskur, Babylonian Adad, as god of the storm took in the winds as well, but in a series of Babylonian incantations for driving away agricultural pests there is a sequence of seven, ail very similar in content, one each to: Marduk, Ninurta, Adad, the South Wind, the North Wind, the East Wind and the West Wind. The first three are major gods in the Sumero Babylonian panthéon, but there seems to be no evidence for cuits to the four winds either individually or collectively. However, these incantations treat each wind in the same way that the three major gods were treated, e.g. : I am the exorcist of Ea [and Asalluhi] : I cali you, I invite you ! This day I have arranged a holy offering for you, I présent an [oblation before you. .., I give a gift as befits a god [. .. ] A silver stag, a [golden] deer [(...)] Accept (these), O East Wind that makes the flood pass, Eat the good food, drink [the sweet beer], Get rid of the big dogs of Ninkilim4. Other exorcistic material covers both winds and other parts of the world: Be exorcised by the seven winds, by the four (world) régions, Be exorcised by silent night and bright day, Be exorcised by shrines, sanctuaries, lands, cities, mountains, seas and the great rivers5. 4.

The writer in Iraq, 45 (1983), p. 85.</page><page sequence="13">Ancient Mesopotamian gods 127 This is Sumerian, and it reflects the Sumerian view that the gods planned the whole universe as including civilized man, so that canals are as much part of this world as rivers, and cities as much as mountains. The distinction we make between phenomena of nature, such as rivers, and human products, such as canals, was not part of their thinking. These lines follow a long list or such lines beginning "Be exorcised by" but with the officiai panthéon listed. Thus, though last, these winds etc. are conceived as gods with divine power as much as the preceding named deities of the city cuits. Three of these catégories merit individual attention. First, rivers as divine beings occur in the exorcistic tradition of Sumer and Babylon, note in addition a section which lists four constel lations, then seven rivers beginning "Tigris, Euphrates"6. However, cuits to even these two are not so far as the writer knows attested in southern Iraq, but upstream evidence exists. At Ebla, south of Aleppo in Syria, the court c. 2500 bc arranged offerings to a variety of gods including the Balikh, the tributary of the Euphrates7, and in Mari, on the middle Euphrates, there is similarly a roughly contemporary docu ment recording offerings to the Euphrates along with other gods8. Rivers occur as the theophorous element in personal ñames rarely in the third and second millennia bc throughout Mesopotamia, but then seem to die out. From this evidence it may be suspected that rivers were gods in prehistoric times, but gradually ceased to be in historical periods. Mountains are similar. Assyria arose from the town Assur, which was situated on a conspicuous hill, and its tutelary god bore the same name Assur. In this case attributes from other deities were borrowed so that the numinous hill duly became a state god comparable to others. But in other cases mountains such as Nimush, Ebeh and Dipar are known as 6. ABBT, I, 57, 23-25. 7. G. Pettinato, Oriens Antiqvvs, 18 (1979), p. 103. 8. D.

Lambert gods only in personal ñames, and not later than the second millennium.9 In the flat plain of Sumer such deities did not of course occur. With temples and cities the origins were of course entirely différent despite the Sumero-Babylonian cos mology, and we may suspect a totally distinct origin of their conception as gods. Here the evidence is from southern Mesopotamia. Hymns to temples and cities were a genre of Sumerian and Babylonian litera ture, and there is clear proof that the divinity of the deity was seen to have spread to temple, city and accoutrements. Quite at random one may quote an offering list from Sumer: 1 lamb, the god Enlil 1 lamb, Hursaggalamma (the ziggurat of Enlil at Nippur) 1 lamb, the throne of Enlil.10 Here the throne of the god receives exactly the same offering as the god himself! Complementary evidence cornes from myths in which implements of gods are fully deified and talk with their masters. In the Sumerian Lugal.e the hero of the taie, the god Ninurta, converses at length with his weapon the god Sharur.11 In the Babylonian Erra Myth the god Erra has a vizier whose origin is given away by his Sumerian name, Hendursanga, "Prime Sceptre", and he also has a set of weapons with whom he converses.12 The most striking example occurs with the town Lagash, whose patron pair, the god Ningirsu and his spouse Baba, had two sons: Shulshagana ("the young man of his heart") and Igalima ("aurochs-door"). The latter philologically refers to a par ticular type of gateway, and as a divine name is paralleled in other gods: Iggalla ("big door"), Igkuga ("holy door"), Iglulim ("stag door"). Gateways in temples were cultically 9. The writer, Iraq, 45 (1983), p. 84. 10. S. T. Kang, Sumerian économie texts from the Drehem archive, I, Urbana, 1972, p. 174 11. 18-20. 11. J. J. A.

Ail this evidence points in the same direction. The aura of a god in his temple could so attach itself to the temple, or architectural parts of it in particular, also to implements he used, and to the city which housed the temple, in such a way that these various things also became gods and received offerings as a mark of the fact. A final category of gods consists of various monsters and composite créatures, usually inferior in terms of divine pre cedence. Some of them are involved with the major gods of the panthéon by having been defeated in time past. Others are servants of major gods, while some were respectable gods in their own right, but little worshipped for one reason or another. Perhaps the best known is the lion-headed eagle, Imdugud in Sumerian, Anzû in Akkadian, who stole the Tablet of Destinies from Enlil, and was eventually defeated and killed by Ningirsu/Ninurta, who duly returned the power giving tablet to his father Enlil.13 Ail créatures of this kind were gods by the ancient Mesopotamian use of words. To sum up, the basis of the Sumero-Babylonian panthéon was the déification of parts and aspects of nature as then perceived and understood. This raw material of a panthéon was then subjected to organization by the theologians, who wanted to spread the cuits around the Sumerian towns so that each major deity was city patron somewhere. These deities were also conceived as having personality of a very human kind, and over the millennia their relative statuses became a matter of great importance in ancient religion, usually due to the political power of their supporters.
