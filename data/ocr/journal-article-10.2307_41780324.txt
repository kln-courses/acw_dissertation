<plain_text><page sequence="1">On a cliff ledge overlooking the vast Utcubamba Valley I spot five-foot-tall anthropomorphic sarcophagi of six ancient Chachapoya, gazing at the rising sun, as if the dead were watching over the living. The capsulelike coffins, made of clay and grass, and built into the cliff face between a.d. 1100 and 1300, are shielded from the rain by overhanging rock. Within them are mummy bundles holding the remains of Chachapoya elite. To reach the cliff heights, the Chachapoya may have used natural ledges, which were destroyed when they withdrew. Scholars believe a stone wall was erected around each mummy bundle. Cane poles were inserted into the walls, sort of teepee-style, and the capsules were built up and then painted. The effigies were finally "dressed" in feathered tunics and adorned with necklaces and trophy heads. The skulls may have been part of the decoration. The site is called Karijia, after a canyon below; the sarcophagi are known to locals as "ancient wise men."</page><page sequence="2">/';-=09 )(8* =-0/']</page><page sequence="3">/';-=09 )(8* =-0/']</page><page sequence="4">/';-=09 )(8* =-0/']</page><page sequence="5">/';-=09 )(8* =-0/']</page><page sequence="6">/';-=09 )(8* =-0/']</page></plain_text>
