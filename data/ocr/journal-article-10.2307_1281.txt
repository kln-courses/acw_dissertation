INTRODUCTION. ALTHIOUGH all work on bird biology, contains much of ecological import and geological considerations have underlain some of the best modern systematic ornithology, explicitly ecological work on African birds has been rare. The bias in favour of the geographical aspect of bird distribution has been strong; so strong that since the publication of the Systema Avium Aethiopicarum African bird geography in its old sense may be said to be within sight of completion, while on the other hand the definition of the range of each form in terms of environmental factors, omitting so far as possible local incidentals, has hardly begun. Clearly the ecology of any given bird can only be worked out on the basis of critical local studies carried out on comparable lines. Such studies would lead to substantial advance in African ornithology. The optimum and the limiting conditions for each form would ultimately be determinable. Climo- graphs of distribution could be prepared and the factor of prime significance in determining the range of each form might emerge. The sub-species that were merely in geographical isolation would be distinguished from those grounded in ecological adaptation, and between the latter the significant differences could be stated. The existence of "physiological races" would become apparent, forms like those demonstrated in other classes of organisms, morphologically indistinguishable but of specialised ecology. The present paper has arisen out of an attempt to make a detailed bird survey of a particular area, the Usambara Mountains of Tanganyika Territory,</page><page sequence="2">42 A Contribution to Tropical African Bird-Ecology as a contribution to the scheme of research suggested above. I have the advantage of being resident there, and moreover the Usambara Mountains are unusually well adapted to provide the essential facts, unobscured by accidents of topography, of the ranges of many forms. The area presents a large variety of habitats in the separation of which geographical distribution plays the smallest possible part; and it is almost unique in Africa in exhibiting a series of evergreen forests, which provide a homogeneous complex of niches, from sea-level to 7500 ft. practically without interruption. (A map of Usambara showing the forests appeared in the Ibis for 1932, facing p. 492.) Also the correlation of climate with altitude is markedly different in Usambara from that in other African mountain areas. Data from such an anomalous region must be of special value when a comparative study is made of distribution in several areas, as tending to isolate the influence of particular factors. In seeking to collect data on the significant variables of the environment I have been faced at the outset with the difficulty of deciding upon what variables attention should be focussed. Such an area as Usambara, close to the Equator, and mainly evergreen, presents problems strange to the ecology of the temperate zone. In Usambara there are no lethal temperatures, and for the most part there is no seasonal interruption of food supply. Further, in Tropical Africa the life-zone through which at least one homogeneous complex of niches-that conditioned by evergreen forest-may persist, is 10,000 ft. high. The present paper is an attempt to take stock anew of the potentially significant variables in this unfamiliar environment, and particu- larly of the enigmatic "altitude" so often referred to as if it were a simple factor. The following pages will inevitably include much that is commonplace to experienced ecologists; but as critical methods have not been applied ex- tensively in African ornithology, certain fundamentals require to be restated. Attention will also be drawn to the subject of bird eco-climates; for the extent to which the temperatures actually experienced by birds differ from those recorded by ordinary meteorological stations has not been generally appre- ciated. Various opinions have been given on the factor of most importance in determining bird distribution in Africa. Chapin (1923) thus summarised his main thesis, in which he had the immense low-lying West African region particularly in mind: " It is through these different types of vegetation (steppe, savannah, forest) that the rainfall determines the distribution of birds," For, in his experience "avifaunal lines are never more sharply defined than the changes of composition and habit of the vegetation." He considers that "although temperature may be a distributional factor of weight it acts most visibly along certain critical lines, as, for instance, where occasional frosts occur.... Other similar lines are found on mountains, where trees disappear." In a later work Chapin is inclined to attribute "no marked influence" to "temperature alone" in the Congo "until an elevation of 5000 ft. is reached"</page><page sequence="3">R. E. MOREAU 43 (1932, p. 81). Bowen (1932) has divided the African avifauna on a temperature basis, but he does not discuss the manner, direct or indirect, in which tem- perature might exert an influence on birds. It is hoped to publish the detailed Usambara survey data elsewhere (a synecological study has been accepted for publication in the Journal of Ecology in 1935), and subsequently to discuss them in this Journal, with particular reference to the suggestions of Chapin and Bowen. Meanwhile it seems to be essential at the outset to recognise the close interdependence of the major factors in the environment. Thus in the opinion of one distinguished ecologist, "Temperature and moisture are so interrelated in controlling the geographical range of organisms that the two are often confused and it is difficult to separate out either moisture or temperature as a definite controlling factor in the geographical distribution of animals" (Chapman, 1931, p. 105). Here, then, is special need for caution in attempting to designate prime factors in African bird distribution. The temptation to over-simplify is one that has constantly to be resisted. "It is fairly useless to make elaborate 'laws of distribution' based entirely on one factor like temperature, as has often been done in the past. It is too crude" (Elton, 1927, p. 43). With this in mind, an attempt has been made to approach the whole question de novo in a critical spirit. A suitably humble-if not despairing-frame of mind towards the com- plexity of our problems is induced by the following quotation from a recent review of insect ecology: "An insect living under natural conditions is never exposed to one isolated climatic factor, but to the continually changing combinations of several. While in the study of the responses of an insect to environment it is necessary first to apply the analytical method, and to investigate the influence of each factor separately, it would be wrong to assume that the response of an insect to the combined action of several factors will represent merely a sum of the responses to each of the factors involved. Indeed, we must first satisfy our- selves whether this is true, or not, by studying experimentally all the more usual combinations of factors" (Uvarov, 1931, p. 80). Recent work on plants has developed this point further. It has been shown experimentally how the nature of an organism's reaction to any one factor may be affected by variation in other factors (cf. Gregory, Crowther and Lambert, 1933). I desire to express my general indebtedness to the scientific officers of this Research Station. They have freely given me assistance on technical points; and the diversity of their interests has aided the cultivation of a broad outlook.</page><page sequence="4">44 A Contribution to Tropical African Bird-Ecology II. ALTITUDE AND ITS CONCOMITANTS. Altitude has often been referred to as if it were a simple factor, and it has always been regarded as of great significance in determining the distribution of living things. For example, the wording of the British Museum collector's labels invites the insertion of the altitude at which the specimen was taken, although it does not require any other particulars of the bird's associations. This conception of the importance of "altitude" may be correct, but there appears to be no general agreement, and, indeed, surprisingly little discussion, as to the nature of the influence of altitude on the organism. Thus Chapin (1923) remarks that "the striking difference [in avifauna] between the Tsavo desert district and the highland veldt to the westward has sometimes been spoken of as due to altitude. This is probably only involved so far as it affects rainfall," and hence, by inference from the main thesis of the paper, vegeta- tion. Chapman, however, in his Andean work (1926) appears constantly to imply the potency of some factor linked with altitude, other than vegetation. I have failed to find any explicit statement of his views, but such passages as this (page 128) appear to indicate his belief in the direct influence of tem- perature as the critical concomitant of altitude: "From these colder regions [of southern South America] the Condor, no less than diminutive Sparrows, have extended their range toward the Equator, increasing their altitude with decreasing latitude and thereby remaining in a life-zone similar to that from which they started." In any case it appears that there is room for a critical examination of the whole question of the influence of altitude. I may say here that I came to the Usambaras without any preconceptions whatever on this subject. I had never lived or worked in a mountainous country. But as I began to learn something of the distribution of the local fauna I was astonished to find that altitude above sea-level had the appearance of ruling the distribution of many species. It was as if every bird carried a pocket aneroid. As one travelled about the mountains the same species were to be expected at the same heights above the sea. One striking example may be cited at this stage. When I went to the West Usambara plateau, which is all above 4000 ft., I met for the first time a number of species not seen in several years' residence and intensive collecting at 3000 ft. on the East Usam- bara plateau (Amani). In the East Usambaras there is one ridge, at the north end, that rises appreciably above 4000 ft. The total area above that height is about 3 sq. miles. This was searched for West Usambara species, with the result that a single day's collecting produced three still not encountered at 3000 ft. There are no obvious biotic factors to account for this limitation of range. The impression conveyed is that altitude per se is of significance. But obviously altitude can only make itself apparent to the organism through one or more of its physical concomitants, i.e. environmental factors. These factors</page><page sequence="5">R. E. MOREAU 45 will be discussed severally; meanwhile, the degree of their connection with altitude must be glanced at. Chapin's tacit assumption when he compares the Tsavo area and the Kenya Highlands, that increased altitude means increased rainfall, is one that can be supported by many local examples. There is certainly a tendency for pre- cipitation to be greater at higher elevations, but this is not in consequence of any general principle. It is the result of local topographical factors. Thus, the Taru Desert, which Chapin had in mind in the remark quoted, at an altitude of about 1000 ft. above sea-level, gets 25 in. of rain a year. A hundred miles to the south and the same distance inland the rainfall at 800 ft. is 70 in. (at Tongwe Mission in Usambara). Elsewhere in Usambara, Amani at 3000 ft. has a rainfall of nearly 80 in., Shume at 6400 ft. one of under 30 in. Factors that are of more importance than the actual amount of annual precipitation in governing the type of vegetation are the distribution of the rainfall and the temperature. In a cooler climate evaporation is lower. So far as vegetation is concerned the same amount of rain "goes further." K6ppen in making his classification of the climates of the world (1918) gave special weight to this modifying factor. Following him McDougall has drawn up a chart (1925) showing the effect of the interaction of rainfall and tem- perature. Thus, it is shown that if the mean annual temperature is 60? F. (15? C.) 80 in. of rain are required to produce equally humid conditions as result at 40? F. (50 C.) from 50 in. The absolute saturation deficit of the air is probably the criterion that should be applied in determining the rainfall efficiency, but African data for this calculation are so scanty and unsatisfactory that it cannot be used at present. Decreasing temperature is certainly an immediate and predictable effect of increasing altitude-at the rate of about 20 C. per 1000 ft. as a world-wide average. But temperature is by no means always correlated with altitude to the same degree, nor, of course, with latitude. Thus, in the Usambaras the temperatures run much lower than the altitude and latitude would lead one to expect. At Amani (3000 ft.) the mean temperature is that of Kenya and Uganda' at about 5000 ft., and of stations at 3000 ft. in the Shire Highlands of Nyasaland, which are 10? further from the Equator. Text-fig. 1 shows comparatively the temperature-altitude correlation in several African areas. Data for Kenya and Usambara have been in part supplied by the B.E.A. Meteorological Service and in part derived from successive years of the " Mitteilungen aus den Deutschen Schiitzgebieten." Data for other areas have been derived from Knox (1911); Murray (1922) for Nyasaland; Sayers (1930) and Der Pflanzer, vol. 8, 1912, Anhang, for Kilimanjaro; Meteorological Maps, Survey of Egypt, Cairo (1922), for the neighbourhood of Ruwenzori. It is, 1 Cf. the Ruwenzori Report (Ogilvie-Grant, 1910, p. 369), where reference is made to "hot tropical valleys" at 6000 ft. There is nothing of the kind at 6000 ft. in the Usambaras, or even so low as 4000 ft.</page><page sequence="6">46 A Contribution to Tropical African Bird-Ecology moreover, worthy of remark that the respective elements making up the mean temperature do not decrease to an equal degree with increasing altitude. Although the data to hand are only those for the Usambara and for Kenya this is doubtless a general phenomenon. The physical basis is presumably increased outward radiation at night owing to the thinner atmosphere at high altitudes. The annual means (mean maxima and mean minima for Kenya as published by the British East Africa Meteorological Service) for various altitude zones are shown graphically in Text-fig. 2. It is evident (i) that the minimum decreases almost exactly twice as fast as the maximum, and 1U times as fast as the mean; (ii) that the higher the altitude the more extreme the climate (compare Samoa, where the mean daily range at sea-level is 6 4? C., at 2000 ft. 9 60 C. (Buxton, 1930)). 2000 - 6000 1500 - 5000 %4- 4000 S 1000 {3000 d ~~~~~~-2000 500 400- 300 - \ 1000 200 Sea-level l l I I l 16?C 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27?C Fig. 1. Gradients of annual mean temperature x altitude in Tropical Africa. On the whole, it is clear that if we are trying to ascertain the limits of a species' temperature tolerance, its altitudinal limits are by themselves far from giving an accurate indication. Moreover, cutting across the general climatic variations and modifying them to a surprising extent are the localised modifications of climate, especially the eco-climates engendered by vegetation. These are discussed in a later section. There is still another precaution that must be observed by the ecologist in stating, or accepting a statement of, a species' vertical range. Where the bird's connection with a certain botanical formation is close, we shall often find that its lower and upper limits are those of the formation. This particu- larly applies to birds of tall evergreen forest. By a historical accident, organised man's first appearance in Tropical Africa armed with fire and with iron tools</page><page sequence="7">R. E. MOREAU 47 has coincided with an epoch of general desiccation. The result is that evergreen forest, already of less extent than under a more humid climate, has been restricted more and more to the mountain-tops. In fact, at the present day there is but little evergreen forest left below 5000 ft. in the eastern half of the continent. Consequently, in East Tropical Africa a forest bird tends to be looked upon as a mountain bird. This is often true in essence as well as in appearance; but we must constantly be on our guard against accepting as a species' natural bounds what are in truth artificial restrictions of recent date. \ 10000 3000 - - 9000 2500 - - 8000 - 7000 2000- ~~~~~l5OO ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~~~~~-5000.- -4000 1000 -3000 -2000 500- 1000 Sea-level 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 Degrees centigrade Fig. 2. The increasing extremes of climate with altitude (Kenya). This prepossession may in part account for the astonishing and misleading list given by Bowen (1932, p. 269) of "species characteristic of the savannas and drier belts," Category C, "Confined to the East Coast." Practically half the twenty-one species cited are characteristic of closed forest or restricted to the extreme coastal strip, which is comparatively humid. In conclusion it may be said that from the point of view of the ecologist, an altitude expressed in feet or metres is best regarded as nothing more than a convenient shorthand method of indicating a complex of meteorological conditions and biological associations, which invariably require to be defined for the particular district concerned.</page><page sequence="8">48 A Contribution to Tropical African Bird-Ecology [II. THE FACTORS POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT IN BIRD DISTRIBUTION. These may conveniently be considered under three headings: (1) Biotic, (2) Climatic, (3) Subjective factors. (1) Biotic factors. At the outset a distinction requires to be drawn between directly and indirectly operating biotic factors. (a) Direct biotic factors. This term covers the most obvious and concrete elements in a species' economy; the presence or absence of suitable food, nesting sites, nesting material, of enemies and of competing species. These direct biotic factors have often been held to be the determinants of bird distribution. There can, of course, be no doubt of their great importance, but they can no longer be regarded as all-sufficient. Thus, in the case of the big hornbill, Bycanistes cristatus, its most obvious requirements in life are quantities of fruit and very large holes in trees to breed in. This hornbill is absent from the "Miombo Bush" that covers so much of East Africa. 9" Miombo Bush" contains practically no trees large enough to provide holes for the bird. Here, then, is a direct biotic factor capable of accounting for the bird's absence from the "Miombo Bush," even if all the other local factors were within its tolerance. But when we find that, given a continuous sheet of evergreen forest full of huge old trees and pro- viding plenty of fruit throughout, these hornbills shun one part of it, we begin to seek factors other than the direct biotic factors. In Usambara dozens of species present just such a problem. One's general ideas on the efficacy of competition between individual species as a mutually limiting factor must suffer some modification when the peculiar circumstances of the tropics, and in particular of tropical forests, are considered. We will for the sake of simplicity deal with evergreen forest con- ditions where all the local peculiarities are found in their most exaggerated form. First, it is clear that, except for those birds that live in holes, competi- tion for the essentials of nesting cannot be a limiting factor. The provision of nesting sites and nesting material is so abundant in evergreen forest that competition for food would intervene as a prior limiting factor. As regards food, the two main types available in the forest are fruit and insects. In the forests I know best the supply of fruit appears to be perennially abundant, and vast quantities of it fall uneaten to the forest floor. And it has been one of the most remarked features of tropical forest ornithology that in its pursuit co-operation in the pursuit of insect food in great measure replaces competition. Swynnerton's notes (1915) on this subject in the Chirinda Forest are applicable, to a large extent even specifically, to the Usambaras, and doubtless to other African forests. In certain species it may be possible to demonstrate a fully</page><page sequence="9">R. E. MOREAU 49 competitive instinct and developed territorial prepossessions; but on the very broad general grounds given above it appears that within our area competition as a direct biotic factor is not likely to be of much weight. Moreover, the mutual exclusiveness of competing species, so that their common boundary is the resultant of the population pressure from both sides, probably has practical importance mainly in large areas of uniform environ- ment. The area considered here is highly mountainous, with a variety of habitats packed into a small space. Each one is, on the geographical scale, of trifling extent. In such circumstances it appears that even if a boundary between any two local species is the resultant of their competition, the site of it must be determined within narrow limits by the extent of each species' optimum environment. Therefore in subsequent discussion the direct compe- tition factor will be ignored. (b) Indirect biotic factors. These may be of the most varied and obscure nature. Vegetation factors are of more general, as opposed to specific, potential importance than any zoological factors that can be conceived, simply because vegetation develop- ment can change the whole physiognomy of an environment. All birds pass more or less of their lives within a couple of hundred feet of the ground. Most of them are tied almost as closely to the earth for critical periods in their lives as the average mammal. Within the narrow zone they inhabit, vegetation may take up an important part of the space. For most species of bird vegetation provides the furniture of their habitat, for many the walls and for some the roof as well. Essential features of the habitat may remain true to type either in time or space, but may change specifically. Thus in every stage of its succession a regenerating evergreen forest in Tropical Africa will provide a variety of dense bush cover and berries. But the bushes and berries present at the beginning and at the end of the process will not be the same, nor will the attendant insect population. Again, a typical mountain forest of Tropical Africa provides the same set of habitats and niches as does an evergreen lowland forest, but the species of plants providing the furniture and framework of each are different in the two forests. In such a case essential material requirements may be present continuously for any given bird in general type but with specific changes. If then, as usually happens, the range of the bird is less extensive than that of the type of its material needs, the hypothesis of a direct biotic (vegetational) factor may be held to break down, but that of an indirect (vegetational) factor operating through subjective factors may be tenable. Especially when vegetation bulks large in the absolute sense, modified climatic conditions tend to be produced within its immediate influence. We know next to nothing about the eco-climates associated with various vegeta- tion types in the tropics: they are only now beginning to be studied. As in Journ. of Animal Ecology TII 4</page><page sequence="10">50 A Contribution to Tropical African Bird-Ecology temperate regions, there must however be well-marked divergencies, specific to at least the main botanical formations, from what is commonly regarded as the "general" local climate, i.e. the climate as usually measured in a screen 3 or 4 ft. above the ground. It is at first sight to be expected that these eco- climatic differences will per se be of less importance to birds than to insects and plants: but when it is realised that eco-climates conditioned by vegetation and existing side by side in an area even so small as a few square yards, may differ as much as the "general" climates of altitudes separated by thousands of feet or of countries a thousand miles apart, it becomes obvious that this effect of vegetation is an indirect biotic factor to be borne in mind even if we lack the data to assess it in numerical terms. Reference is made in Section IV to certain eco-climates important in Tropical Africa. Before leaving the subject of indirect biotic factors of potential general importance, a possible zoological factor may be cited in the presence or absence of a vector of a parasitic disease. Mosquitoes and malaria are obvious examples in point. The mosquito population tends to fall off rapidly with increasing altitude and to change in specific composition. It is conceivable that the presence of certain mosquitoes at low altitudes might set an effective limit to the high-altitude avifauna, which had never acquired immunity to bird malaria. However, it is a fact that at present nothing is known of the incidence of bird malaria in Africa (Mr J. W. McHardy, Medical Entomologist to the Tanganyika Governments, in litt.), although it has received much attention in America. The parasites are specifically different from those concerned in human malaria (Wenyon, 1926). Filaria is another parasite in point (cf. Webb, 1931). (2) Climatic factors. Next to nothing accurate seems to be known of the direct significance of any of these factors to birds, and particularly to wild birds. Direct effects only are considered under this head. Indirect effects can of course be regarded as existing, but their operation is through biotic factors. Experimental data will always be difficilt to obtain, for the living material with which we are concerned is perhaps the least susceptible to laboratory treatment of any class of organism. In this respect the botanist and the entomologist are to be envied. At least a beginning has been made in knowledge of insect responses to climatic factors. Chapman (1931) summarised a mass of data on the reaction of animals to various factors, but making all allowances for the fact that he wrote "with especial reference to insects," his citations dealing with vertebrates are suggestively scanty, and are few indeed for birds. For insects alone Uvarov (1931) also has provided a critical and thoroughly up-to-date summary. Such progress as the entomologists have made is of interest to us as a guide to what factors are likely to be of significance to animals in general and</page><page sequence="11">R. E. MOREAU 51 in what way. But several cardinal differences between insects and birds must be borne in mind. Unlike insects, birds are warm-blooded animals. The tem- perature range within which an insect is capable of activity may be less than 25? C. and beyond the extremes of its active range it may fall into complete inertia within 2' C. (cf. Chapman and others, 1927). Moreover, birds are extremely mobile except for the comparatively short initial helpless stage of their lives; and during that stage they are for the most part enveloped in special conditions maintained by the parent. The differences between insects and birds are too great for any close reasoning from analogy to be permissible. Under climatic factors, humidity, light, wind, pressure and temperature have to be considered. The first three can be disposed of briefly at the start: the subject of eco-climates, which is of most interest to us on the temperature side, is discussed in section IV. (a) Humidity. Birds in general are likely to be much less susceptible than other animals to the direct effects of humidity. For in the case of shortage of moisture birds can move comparatively long distances to drink, and moreover they are notoriously adaptable in this respect. Thus Lynes (1925) found that besides the native birds, which were habituated to desert conditions, many Palaearctic birds passed the winter in parts of Darfur where there was neither accessible surface water nor dew for months on end. In case of excess of moisture birds are not likely to be affected unless they are susceptible to damp-engendered diseases. These are perhaps most likely to be operative on birds just out of the egg or the nest. It is common experience that a "cold wet spring" is bad for poultry rearing, and there the conditions are such that there is no question of the food supply being affected by unfavourable weather. There is the possibility that some birds, like most human beings, may experience discomfort when the saturation deficit of the air is very low- "4raw cold" and "muggy heat "-and may shun areas where this uncom- fortable condition prevails. But this question of the potential significance of humidity through the comfort impressions of the subject is a particularly difficult one because the idea of relative humidity is inseparably bound up with temperature. The investigations quoted by Chapman (1931, p. 111) show that an unexpectedly wide range of relative humidity can convey to the human subject a similar impression of comfortable conditions if the tem- perature is suitably adjusted. But we have to face the fact that birds may be influenced by humidity in their impressions of comfort and discomfort quite differently from human beings, and that avian species must differ in this respect widely between themselves. It is indeed only too clear that we have not the remotest idea to what extent humidity may operate directly to determine birds' ranges, if at all: but we shall probably be safe in concluding that except in a few extreme 4-2</page><page sequence="12">52 A Contribution to Tropical African Bird-Ecology cases (e.g. sandgrouse, Pterocles) any direct influence of humidity is small in comparison with the immense importance of humidity in determining the botanical elements in the habitat. The tendency for plumage colours to be darker and richer in more humid areas is well known-the so-called Gloger's law. How far this is the direct effect of humidity and how far of other factors, especially light, is doubtful and probably variable from species to species. For example, with the crested larks (Galerida cristata subspp.) of the Near East there is reason to suppose that humidity does not account for their conspicuous colour gradations (cf. Meinertzhagen, 1921, p. 642). On the other hand I believe that an American worker (? Beebe) succeeded experimentally in pro- ducing darker plumage in a dove by manipulating the humidity of the labo- ratory environment, but I cannot quote the reference. (b) Light. Although it may be of comparatively little importance to birds in many regions of the earth, light is of special interest to us because of the dominance of evergreen forest in our area, with a whole fauna confined within the shade of its canopy. Sun-flecks reach the ground, but between them the average light intensity is of the order of one-thousandth of that of the open air. In our experience individual birds of the species inhabiting the interior of the forests do not seek, and appear to shun, flecks of sunlight. It is then con- ceivable that a bird living near the ground in the forest may be physically incapable of supporting the impact of full sunlight even if the material neces- sities of life are available. The question of the optimum composition of the light can at this stage only be left untouched. The light that reaches the forest-floor between the sun-flecks is certainly very different from the white light of the open air: and recent work has shown a possibility that light of different wave-lengths may have different effects on testis activity (cf. I3issonnette and Wadlund, 1931). Furthermore the amount of ultra-violet radiation penetrating to the lowest stratum of the forest appears to be extremely small, probably even less in proportion than the visible light. The importance of ultra-violet radiation in elaborating vitamin D from the ergosterol in the preen gland has been recently demonstrated in certain northern species of birds (Rowan, 1931, pp. 57 et seq.). It appears possible therefore that birds confining themselves to the deeply shadowed interior of the evergreen forest may be specialised in this respect. High (visible) light intensity and high temperature tend to go together, and their effects will tend to be confused. (c) Wind. Except perhaps in peculiar regions of the earth where high winds are a very constant and pronounced phenomenon their mechanical effect is likely to be of much less importance to birds than to plants and insects, although birds certainly seek cover and sheltered hollows in windy weather. In our</page><page sequence="13">R. E. MOREAU 53 area wind can hardly be of any significance. It is, however, a fact that the stillness of the air is one of the characteristics of the forest eco-climate. Birds of the undergrowth are never during the whole of their lives exposed to any- thing stronger than a draught; and even in the canopy the force of any wind is mitigated. (d) Pressure. With species that in our area appear to be limited in distribution by some factor cutting across an approximately homogeneous habitat, it is natural that barometric pressure should present itself as possibly significant. We shall clear the ground if we can dispose of its pretensions. In the first place, barometric pressure is the factor that varies most directly with altitude. It decreases with increasing altitude: and the same altitude implies the same pressure irrespective of locality and latitude. In the tropics the daily variation in barometric pressure tends to be greater, and the seasonal less, than in the temperate zones. Temperature also affects barometric pressure to a slight extent. These causes of variation are however small compared with those resulting from change of altitude. They are equivalent to those caused by a few score of feet in ascent or descent, whereas we are dealing with thousands of feet. At first sight it appears to follow from this that a hypothesis of the signifi- cance of pressure in determining the distribution of a bird could be proved or disproved by demonstrating that the same morphological form did or did not occur between the same altitudes on different mountains. From my experience it appears that it would not often be possible to demonstrate such a unity of altitude choice, and there are, of course, very notable exceptions, such as the numerous species referred to by Chapman (1926) in the Andes. But the question of pressure cannot on this. account be quite disposed of at this stage for two reasons. In the first place there does exist for this factor experimental evidence that points prima facie to the potential significance of pressure in nature. Secondly, observational evidence from a number of isolated areas can never be irrefragable because of the possible existence of forms distinguishable physiologically though not morphologically. (Cf. the recent work of Krumbiegel (1932) on a Carabid beetle, in which he found experi- mentally that the physiological distinctions between specimens from different areas were much more appreciable than their morphological differences.) As regards the possible manner in which pressure could affect the organism it might be (a) mechanical, rarefaction of the air weakening the powers of flight, or (b) physiological. Regarding (a) it may be remarked that most of the birds with which we have to deal are no more aerial than a wren: and those which spend most time on the wing, such as swifts and the big Falconidae, are notoriously free of the heavens to great heights. The question of a physiological effect requires more attention. Pressure</page><page sequence="14">54 A Contribution to Tropical African Bird-Ecology is an obvious factor for experimental manipulation, and a small amount of laboratory work is on record. It is assumed that the most significant element in reduced atmospheric pressure is the shortage of oxygen. Rosin (1928) subjected hens to a pressure so low as 230 mm. of mercury, which would be equivalent to the rarefaction at 27,000 ft., without obvious effects. The duration of the experiment was apparently short. We hiave no indication whether similar reduced pressure extended over weeks and months would result in a deterioration sufficient to unfit the bird for life under natural conditions. It seems, however, likely that an adult bird's adaptability to pressure is sufficiently wide to be without significance in the life zone we are dealing with. The conclusion is of course not strictly applicable to other species than domestic fowls, but the potentialities are sufficiently indicated. The work of Riddle (1924) and Romanoff (1930) provides evidence that embryonic birds may be much more sensitive to varying oxygen pressures than are adults. To increased pressures their adaptability is great enough to remove the possibility of this factor's significance out of the range of practical con- sideration. With regard to reduced pressures the indications appear to be otherwise. Unfortunately Riddle does not present his facts with all the clarity that one might wish. It seems, though it is not stated, that he secured his reduced oxygen pressures not by exposing the eggs to air under reduced pressure but by immersing them in an atmosphere richer in nitrogen and poorer in oxygen than is air. His conclusions are: "Many bird embryos in one or another stage of development require an atmosphere containing...not less than 15 per cent. of oxygen" (p. 360). "A concentration of 17-5 per cent. of oxygen during 24 hours kills.. .weak and older normal embryos... .For the entire developmental period a concentration probably not less than 14-0 per cent. is required" (p. 361). Romanoff found that growth stopped when the pressure (oxygen) was reduced by about 23 per cent. Now it can be calculated that the partial pressures of oxygen in artificial atmospheres containing 17-5 and 15 per cent. of oxygen are equivalent to those encountered at about 5000 and 8800 ft. respectively above sea-level. Again, Romanoff's reduction of 23 per cent. is reached at about 7500 ft. In the fowl, then, we should expect to find a marked mortality in the shell at 5000 ft. and almost 100 per cent. mortality at 8000 ft. A somewhat surprising result. It occurred to me that as Kenya Colony possesses poultry farms up to 8500 ft. above the sea, and thereby provides a series up to uniquely high altitudes, I might be in what Elton describes as the exhilarating position of finding a large-scale experiment already carried out. Mr T. G. Watson of the Division of Animal Industry, Department of Agriculture, Nairobi, very kindly interested himself in the question and collected data through the Kenya Poultry Club. As a result he wrote: "My general finding is that there is no</page><page sequence="15">R. E. MOREAU 55 greater mortality at 8500 ft. than at 5000 ft. Even at the higher altitude 100 per cent. hatchings frequently occur." It is not of course suggested that anything equivalent to properly controlled experimental data was available from the farms, but nevertheless if the experimental results quoted had been reflected in Kenya practice the data from the altitudes received by Mr Watson should have shown a marked difference. Two possible reasons occur to one for the incompatibility of the laboratory and the Kenya data. (a) The effect of a reduced oxygen pressure in an artificial atmosphere at normal pressure may be different physiologically from that of a reduced oxygen pressure in a correspondingly reduced atmospheric pressure, such as always occurs in nature. I am indebted to Mr F. J. Nutman for pointing out that physiological work on plants supports this view (cf. Clements, F. E., 1931). In that case the laboratory work is not relevant to our problem. (b) A strain capable of withstanding reduced oxygen pressures might have been unconsciously selected in Kenya. Otherwise, if the experimental results are indeed applicable to natural conditions the poultry introduced into the Kenya Highlands would have failed to perpetuate themselves. On the whole the conclusion is that changing pressure, the one direct con- comitant of changing altitude, is not likely to be significant in bird distribution. (e) Temperature. Although there is much evidence to show that birds survive an exceedingly wide range of temperature so long as food is available (cf. Rowan, 1929, p. 163 for sub-Arctic aviaries; Stantchinsky, 1927, for wild birds in Russia) it is a natural assumption, and one that has been repeatedly made, that birds' ranges may be affected by temperatures not approaching the lethal extremes. As a working hypothesis it is reasonable, but I have been able to find no references to experimental data in favour of it. The Oxford Bureau of Animal Population confirms the view I had formed from search in the agricultural library at Amani. But strictly physiological literature may contain some references. Moreover, when the hypothesis is applied to an area such as the Usambara Mountains it must be held to imply a fairly high degree of sensitivity on the part of birds. Thus, all the striking changes in the composition of the avifauna to be described later will be found to be effective within a life zone of 4000 ft. Within that range the annual mean temperature only varies locally about 70 C. (see Text-fig. 1). The difference between the winter minima is a little greater (about 90 C.), but between the summer maxima it is less. The extent to which birds are sensitive to changes in temperature on this small scale, or to what elements of the variable temperatures encountered in nature they react, is quite uncertain. Hope was aroused by the title of a paper by Mitchell and Haines (1927) on " The critical temperature of the chicken." The critical temperature is defined as "the environmental tem-</page><page sequence="16">56 A Contribution to Tropical African Bird-Ecology perature at and below which the heat production of the fasting resting animal will increase to prevent a lowering of the body temperature." In the summary of the paper it is stated that the "average critical temperature was 62? F.," but "some of the individual birds appeared to show distinct differences in their reactions." On reading the paper it is found from Table III (p. 555) that the "probable location of the critical temperature" varies among the 12 birds used from "above 75? F." to "below 50?." If any conclusion what- soever is permissible from such data it is that critical temperature is individual rather than specific. With insects the daily range of temperature has been established to be a limiting factor as well as the mean maxima attained in the summer and the mean minima of the winter. In addition the entomologists have been able to recognise the existence of a " preferendum," i.e. the temperature that any given species of insect prefers. It is regarded as "probably one of the most potent factors influencing the ecological distribution of insects and their movements." The preferendum of an insect species can readily be ascertained. For if an insect is "placed so that a choice of several temperature conditions is possible it usually moves about for some time and finally rests in a certain temperature zone" (Uvarov, 1931, pp. 54-6). It is immeasurably easier to manipulate an ant in a long box with a source of heat at one end, than to manipulate, let us say, a bush-shrike in any controlled surroundings capable of yielding reliable data as to its preferences under natural conditions: nevertheless it is surprising that no attempt to ascertain whether birds exhibit specific preferenda appears to have been made. "Daily range" is an element of natural temperature that has been shown to be of importance to insects. Whether it is significant where birds are con- cerned we do not know. The increasing difference between annual mean maxima and mean minima with altitude (cf. Text-fig. 2) would imply a concurrent increase in daily range. Detailed records of daily range at Usambara stations confirm this inference, but the nature of the vegetation is evidently a modifying factor. The daily range tends to be lower in a neighbourhood where evergreen rain forest is predominant, and higher in bare country. It is highest in desert and smallest of all in the "indoor" conditions under a canopy of evergreen forest. Thus, while daily range differences of possible significance exist between the "general" climates of altitudes and districts, such differences are even more clearly marked (and hence of greatest potential significance) between eco-climates existing within the same "general" climate. The point will be referred to again in the section on eco-climates. Uvarov (1931, p. 122) quotes species of insects the range limit of which has been found by various workers to coincide with annual isotherms. Most ecologists will agree that no conception can be formed of how such a mean, in which all the extremes of the year have lost their identity, can impress itself on an organism. For example, an annual mean of 15? C. might equally</page><page sequence="17">R. E. MOREAU 57 well exist with mean summer maxima of 250 C. and mean winter minima of 100 C., or with mean summer maxima of 350 C. and mean winter minima of -5' C. Two very different types of climate would thus be masked under a common isotherm. An example is afforded by a comparison of the climates of Lushoto (at 4800 ft. in the Usambaras and within 60 of the Equator) and of Deepwalls (at 1700 ft. in the Knysna district of South Africa, latitude 340 S.). The annual means agree within 10 C.; even the mean maxima of the three hottest months and the mean minima of the three coldest show the same close correspondence. But at Lushoto the temperature is never greater than 320 C., while at Deepwalls temperatures of 380 C. are recorded in five months of the year, with an absolute maximum of over 430 C. (Phillips, 1931). Such considerations need not exclude the use of annual means as an index for comparing the climates of different localities so long as they are of the same type. But obviously if any argument is to be based on annual means the constitution of each needs to be examined. It may be that birds suffer discomfort, much as human beings do, with high temperatures far below the potentially lethal. I observed in Egypt that the hoodie crows and the sparrows both opened their bills and gasped when the temperature reached about 350 C. It seems too that undue heat and cold may lower the vitality of warm-blooded animals without evoking definite pathological symptoms, and under natural selection any such disability would tend to exclude a species from the zone in which the summer maxima or winter minima consistently passed the bounds of its tolerance. A thoroughly ab- normal drop in temperature at long intervals is likely to be less significant in restricting a species' range than a succession of temperatures that are only a little below the optimum. For the effects of a rare catastrophe would be transitory compared with those of a steady depressant. All the above considerations have reference to the health or comfort of the individual and its direct reactions, reflex or voluntary. Among many insects, however, temperature exercises an extremely important indirect effect through the rate of reproduction. Chapman (1928) gives experimental grounds for believing that the effect on certain insects of a single degree difference in temperature may be measurable by the proportionate increase in the popula- tion. Thus "two closely related and competing species of beetles in controlled environments are present in varying proportions, the ratio of the two to each other being dependent. on their curves of proportionate increase. The species with the higher proportionate rate of increase at high temperatures is dominant at high temperatures." The annual proportionate increase, or better, the biotic potential, of most insects is measured in thousands. The biotic potential of birds, especially tropical birds with their small broods, and comparatively slow generation is vastly less. The average clutch of most Tropical African birds is under three. Such birds on a basis of two broods a year would have a biotic potential of between four and six. It is true that the stimulation of</page><page sequence="18">58 A Contribution to Tropical African Btrd-Ecology reproductive activity in birds by optimum temperature would probably not be so direct and marked as it is in insects, whose whole vital functions tend to be narrowly governed by temperature. But the possibility that the biotic potential of a bird may be susceptible to some specific optimum in temperature is not one that can be dismissed, because the smallest differences, e.g. between 4*9 and 5.0, could over a period of geological time be as effective in establishing the dominance of one competing species over another as the vastly larger index figures of insects. If ultimately we are able to convince ourselves experimentally that the comparatively mild temperatures we are chiefly concerned with here are indeed of direct significance in determining bird distribution it may prove that the relationship is not of the kind that can be derived from the meteorological records usually published. Thus, on the analogy of other forms of life the possibility must be considered that some kind of summation effect may be significant, e.g. of the number of degree-hours above a temperature threshold which would probably be specific. Such an effect would tend to exaggerate small temperature differences. For example, if the threshold were at 20? C. and the temperature exceeded that figure for 7 hours a day the respective numbers of degree-hours available at 21 and 22? C. would be 7 and 14. As regards temperature in general we may conclude that under our peculiar local conditions and within the abnormally small range we have to deal with, there may be no experimental data whatever to show that temperature is directly significant to birds, apart, that is, from its influence on biotic factors. But analogy, although admittedly not close, suggests the possibility of such marked and varied direct effects that we shall be justified in adopting the working hypothesis that some element of temperature may be significant. It follows that in the present stage of knowledge no ecological study can hope to include the really significant temperature data except by a lucky chance. In the absence of any guide I shall assume that the mean maxima of the hottest months and the mean minima of the coldest are at least likely to be more illuminating than the annual mean temperatures, or even the annual mean maxima and minima. (f) Climatic factors-General. In the foregoing we have been concerned mainly with the potential direct effects of the various climatic factors on birds. We have found no reason to suppose that wind or pressure can be significant; we have considered that under the peculiar extreme local conditions light may be an effective factor; we have adopted the working hypothesis that some element of temperature may be significant; and if the whole question of humidity effects had been less wrapped in obscurity and difficulties it might have ranked with tem- perature. Accordingly, as complete temperature data as possible are always required, together with the extreme conditions of light intensity; and, although</page><page sequence="19">R. E. MOREAU 59 we cannot in the least estimate their direct significance, a certain minimum of humidity data. Altitude will, of course, only be mentioned incidentally, the emphasis being constantly on the temperature gradient, not on the pressure. It is necessary here to emphasise that even were direct effects of light, temperature and humidity demonstrated experimentally they might in nature be masked by indirect effects. For temperature and humidity are the factors that in combination primarily determine vegetation types, and, generally speaking, the vegetation type determines the light. It appears, then, that on observational data we can hardly hope to be able as a rule to isolate any one factor as of compelling significance in determining distribution, and it is im- portant that in seeking to interpret such data we should continually bear in mind that climatic effects may be less direct than they appear, and the significant factors of every category more complicated and interdependent. (3) Subjective factors. To these factors we attribute the preferences and repulsions that we observe and cannot in our ignorance rationalise. And it may be well to recall at the outset that the psychology of birds is much more complicated than that of the invertebrates usually the subject of experimental manipulation. In the opening sentence under "Direct biotic factors " I referred to "suitable food, nesting sites or nesting material." I followed many previous authors. The phrase has become almost a cliche. But the truth is that the use of the adjective "suitable " in that connection is merely question-begging. Fortified by a knowledge of dietetics we may be able to assure ourselves that certain fruits are "suitable " nourishment for a given bird which is known to be frugivorous. The bird may have different views, and it alone is the arbiter of what is and is not " suitable." The same difficulty is sometimes encountered with the more primitive races of mankind. The savage's views are in conflict with the dietetic expert's, and the savage is prepared to back his opinions with his life. It is most exceptional for any species to be specific in its diet. As a result of the examination of over 80,000 bird stomachs in the course of 40 years by the United States Department of Agriculture, McAtee has come to the con- clusion that " a discrimination in the choice of prey by birds is... .non-existent " (reviewed by Uvarov, 1932). I have not been able to consult McAtee's book, but in view of such work as Swynnerton's (1919) it seems likely that the statement of this conclusion is a little extreme. The review quoted has pro- voked much subsequent discussion in the pages of Nature, where it appeared. But I think that most people who have done any stomach examination at all will agree that species tend to have a wide range of food. It appears that generally speaking a flycatcher will take anything on the wing that is small enough; a thrush, berries in addition to a wide range of invertebrate food,</page><page sequence="20">60 A Contribution to Tropical African Bird-Ecology both Arthropods and, Gasteropods; a barbet a variety of fruit. At the same time experience of birds in aviaries leads one to realise that in certain circum- stances they are capable of narrow selection. Thus a Turacus fischeri Rchw. and a Buccanodon olivaceum (Shelley) kept by me, show themselves critical towards certain of the varieties of banana bought from the local Africans. In general the birds' tastes agree with those of human beings, and astringent varieties are rejected: but distaste is also shown for a certain plantain type of banana which I regard as palatable. (The enormous range of banana varieties can hardly be realised in Europe, where the wholesale suppliers handle practi- cally nothing but the one variety, Gros Michel). If there is any strong taste preference for one particular food it can in the nature of things often be exercised during only a part of the year. Or the passionately desired food may be scarce and form only a relatively small part of the total bulk of food swallowed. (Incidentally, the significance of such an item of diet would not be revealed by stomach examination.) We have then to consider whether in such circumstances the occasional or seasonal occurrence of the specially prized food could be effective in limiting the bird perennially to the immediate neighbourhood of that food's occurrence. It sounds unlikely: but the case of Gypohierax angolensis (Gmel.), the vulturine fish-eagle, shows that it may operate even in a most unexpected type of bird. It has been shown elsewhere (Moreau, 1933) that in all probability the highly anomalous range of this eagle in Africa depends on that of the oil-palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.), the fruits of which are occasionally found in its stomach; and that the bird in East Africa keeps much more closely to the neighbourhood of oil-palms than its powers of flight would lead one to expect. The choice of nesting materials is a similar difficult point. A given forest species is observed to build its nest of skeleton leaves and nothing else. Does it do so because this material is plentiful in the forest and readily lends itself to the construction of the specific type of nest? Or is it so unadaptable that if all other conditions were favourable an absence of skeleton leaves would prevent it from propagating its kind? The possibility that the use of nesting material may be highly and consciously selective is illustrated by certain well-known species-e.g. the chaffinch, which has been described, perhaps with undue anthropomorphism, as decorating its nest with taste and ingenuity. Of still wider application and still more vague is the preference for par- ticular associations, particular "kinds of country." For example, a species whose material necessities appear to be met by a supply of insects, of fibres, and of any inequality that will hold a nest, may be found only in the neigh- bourhood of rocks. A shrike that ranges through the canopy of the evergreen forest may never cross into the contiguous plantation trees. Here we seem to have a counterpart of the vague repulsion-"unhappiness"-felt by some</page><page sequence="21">R. E. MOREAU 61 men born among hills when they encounter flat country: or by the Bedawin of the Egyptian deserts when they enter the Nile Valley'. Elton (1930, p. 54) gives a good example of an irrational preference of this type. On one islet Arctic terns were observed to avoid all patches of grass although they nested on other kinds of vegetation. This preference can hardly have had any biological significance, because elsewhere birds of the same species nested on islets completely covered with grass. We may regard the invocation of subjective factors as a suspicious ex- pedient to be used as sparingly as possible; as a last resort of ignorance; as a confession of despair: but so much appears to be explicable by no factors other than the subjective that we are forced to postulate their existence. IV. EcO-CLIMATES2. An eco-climate has been defined as " the sum-total of meteorological factors within a habitat" (Uvarov, 1931, p. 128). It is mainly conditioned by the material components of the habitat and their mutual relations in space. The spatial extension of the eco-climate to be studied depends partly on the size of the organism and partly upon its mobility. Thus the eco-climate of a grub in a rotten log is small and comparatively homogeneous. Most eco-climates are more complicated, and for mobile creatures consist rather of a complex of eco-climates inhabited by the individual for varying periods of time. Thus, a jerboa inhabits an eco-climate narrowly defined in all three dimensions while it is in its burrow, and a different one, limited in vertical extension by the creature's small stature but comparatively unlimited horizontally, when it is foraging on the surface of the desert. The habitats of birds are of greater spatial extension than those of the animals just quoted, and their eco-climatic relations are more complicated. Apart from the fact that during its first few weeks an individual bird exists in the highly specialised eco-climate of the nest, during its adult life it fre- quents a more or less wide vertical range of the atmosphere and a variety of vegetation. A bird moving up and down between the ground and the branch of a tree passes through several climatic strata differing, as we shall see, to a surprising extent. Temperatures, humidity, wind and light may all be modified in an eco- climate. Here for the sake of simplicity and also because it is ex hypothesi a factor of general importance, discussion will be practically confined to tem- perature. Throughout this discussion " temperature " refers to air temperature, radiant heat, such as is taken up by an unshaded object, being left out of 1 Since this paper was accepted for publication, the work of D. Lack on "Habitat selection in birds" has appeared (J. Animal Ecology, 2, 239, 1933); this paper puts forward independently the same idea, and substantiates it by detailed evidence from birds on the Breckland forest plantations. 2 Much of the theoretical basis of this section and the data on eco-climates from the North Temperate Zone are derived from Geiger (1927).</page><page sequence="22">62 A Contribution to Tropical African Bird-Ecology account. If any attempt were made to evaluate the temperature actually " felt" by an unshaded bird, fresh complications would be introduced because the heat absorption at the surface of the plumage must differ according to the colour and degree of glossiness, and the heat transmitted from the external surface to the skin must depend on the texture of the plumage. Actually in a bird the lungs may well be the surface most sensitive to air-temperatures. An immense number of measurements would be necessary to determine the climates frequented by a single bird in the course of a single day's activity. But the problem assumes more finite proportions if the underlying principles are considered for a moment. The physical factors determining an eco-climate of the type inhabited by birds are (1) the proximity of surfaces capable of absorbing solar radiation by day and radiating heat at night, (2) the nature of the surfaces, (3) the freedom of air-movement, (4) the presence of shade. Air in close proximity to an unsheltered surface is hotter by day and cooler by night than perfectly "open" air is. The denser the surface the greater the day temperature and as a rule the greater the daily range, i.e. the more extreme the eco-climate. The canopy of a forest and the upper part of a close stand of herbage both act as heat surfaces, but not being so dense as an earth or a rock surface the eco-climate conditioned by them cannot be so extreme. The colour of the surface is important because the paler the colour the more heat is reflected; and of still greater importance is its degree of dryness. A surface capable of giving up water will not condition so extreme an eco-climate as a dry surface. Thus the transpiration of green grass will have a modifying effect on its eco- climate, which will be less- extreme than with the same grass when it is withered. Restriction of air movement round heat surfaces assists the hot air to accumulate and makes for a more extreme climate: but where heat surfaces are absent it makes for a more equable eco-climate (e.g. in a burrow). In nature some or all of these factors operating in modification of the "general" climate are effective simultaneously. They may exaggerate or they may cancel each other's effects. Moreover, in nature there are endless com- binations of the eco-climatic factors in varying degrees of potency. Never- theless, the general principles being accepted, it is now possible to particularise a little further. Thus, it is clear that within any given " general" climate the most extreme eco-climate will be that encountered on the surface of bare ground. Probably the highest temperature of all will be experienced by a bird like Thamnolea moving about on naked rocks by day. (The actual surface temperature may exceed 600 C.) Again, at any given moment, assuming identical conditions of sun and shade for both birds, a lark working bare ground in the African bush by day would be exposed to an air temperature much higher than an Anthoscopus on a twig 6 ft. above its head. While we have no actual records of the temperature difference in these circumstances in Africa, data for tem-</page><page sequence="23">07o ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~z r00 U r C,) z Ct 04 U)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~C 0 Photo. E.A.A.R.S. r' Phot. i. Intermediate forest, exterior.r</page><page sequence="24">R. E. MOREAU 63 perate climates show that it would often exceed 10? C. That is equivalent to the difference involved in more than 5000 ft. of altitude. The eco-climates conditioned by vegetation are the most important we have to deal with. They have already been mentioned under indirect biotic factors. It appears that within its immediate influence the same type of vegetation modifies the "general" climate in the same way irrespective of locality: or in other words we may expect to obtain from a systematic study a factor of modification expressed in numerical terms and approximately constant wher- ever the same type of vegetation occurs. In dealing with natural vegetation the major difficulty, not quite so great in plantations, must be to ensure that the vegetation under investigation is comparable to that for which the factor was calculated. And of course between any types selected there will in nature be complete transitional series. We may have to wait a long time before such factors are available. Mean- while we may indicate the direction in which the "general" climate appears to be modified for certain main vegetation types. For the last one it will be possible to produce numerical data, and tentatively a temperature modifica- tion factor: (a) Low herbage-a few inches high. (b) Taller herbage: (i) Plants with broad leaves more or less horizontally disposed dominant. (ii) Erect grasses dominant. (c) Bushes. The foregoing eco-climates are considered for unshaded situations. The presence of overhead shade tends in all cases towards equability. The tendency is exhibited in its extreme form with type (d) (ii) below. (d) Evergreen forest. (i) Canopy. (ii) Interior. (a) Low herbage will be hotter by day and cooler by night than the "general" climate. The heating effect will be greater when the vegetation is dry. This condition is usually encountered in the hot season, and the extreme nature of the low herbage eco-climate is thus exaggerated to the utmost. (b) In herbage more than about a foot high at least two climatic layers are engendered. (i) Plants with broad leaves horizontally disposed produce by day in their topmost few inches temperatures appreciably hotter (at least 3? C.) than the "open" air above, while close to the ground the temperature is lower than in the open. At night the entire temperature range in the vegetation is below</page><page sequence="25">64 A Contribution to Tropical African Btrd-Ecology that of the open. (But with a transpiring organism the absence of air move- ment close to the ground might offset the biological consequences of the lower temperature.) In other words this type of -vegetation produces a climate more extreme than the "general" in its topmost layers but in its lowest a climate that is if anything more equable and consistently cooler. (ii) Erect grasses are at their tops hardly appreciably hotter by day than the open air, but the air temperature rises rapidly as the ground is approached (by as much as 4? C.) and there is no well-developed cool belt close to the ground as with type (b) (i). At night it is a little colder halfway down the stems than it is at either the top or the bottom of the grasses. Thus with the erect grass type of vegetation the eco-climate of the tips approxi- mates to the " general " climate but that of the interior is more extreme, mainly in the direction of greater heat and most exaggerated in the dried-up conditions of the hot season. This eco-climatic description is based on measurements in cornfields in Germany. It will be subject to some modification in accordance with the habit of the individual grasses dominant in any given stand. But the great heat inside tall grass is well known to anyone who has followed African paths through "Elephant Grass." (G) Bush, if dense, tends to resemble type (b) (i) in being more extreme, hotter by day and cooler by night. The difference may be as great as 5? C. in both directions. (Based on unpublished data collected in Kenya by the Entomologist, East African Agricultural Research Station.) In fact, as might be expected, it appears that bush and herbage (b) (i) condition similar eco- climatic systems. (d) (i) Forest canopy tends to be hotter by day and cooler by night than the "general climate" (cf. Geiger, op. cit.). In fact the eco-climatology of the canopy of a forest appears to be governed by the same principles as unshaded bush. But in downward passage through the canopy the eco-climate changes progressively to that diverging from the " general" climate in the opposite direction and described in the following subsection. (ii) Evergreen forest undergrowth exists in an eco-climate much more equable than the "general" climate, perennially cooler, damper and darker. The degree of equability appears to depend primarily on the density of the canopy above. This eco-climate is of great interest because it houses a whole special fauna. No published data regarding the climate in the interior of a forest in Tropical Africa appear to be in existence, An attempt has therefore been made to obtain data in the Amani forests. The results of a year's records are omitted from this paper for reasons of space. It is hoped to publish them later. Briefly, at 4 ft. above the ground in intermediate forest (3000 ft.) and in the somewhat lighter lowland forest (1150 ft.) (to be described botanically</page><page sequence="26">U) - H 14~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ cn ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~~~Pots .A .R .Po.3 ntreit oet neir Phot. 2.

C., as follows: In annual mean temperature ... -2 00 C., - 150 C. In summer maxima ... ... -4 0 C., -(3 00 C.) In winter minima... ... ... -O 5? C., 00 C. Although, as already stated, we have no data from any other part of Tropical Africa, Phillips (1931) has investigated the climate in the evergreen forest at Knysna which is comparable with Usambara forest. He found the (annual) mean maxima under the canopy to be 3.30 C. less than outside and the mean minima to be practically the same in both sites. On the three sets of data available we are justified in concluding that the divergence from the "general" climate inside forest resembling the types in question lies in reduction of maxima (and daily range). As it happens that the subtropical forest investigated is the most luxuriant in East Africa, it is probable that a modification factor of - 4*00 C. in maxima will not be exceeded in East and South Africa. We should expect the factor to be bigger in the West African forest with an interlocked canopy as described by Chipp (1927). The range between - 4 0 and - 3 0? C. may be expected to cover most forests that are tall, evergreen and closed. It follows from the foregoing that only a small proportion of the total avifauna actually inhabits the "general" climate. The birds that do so most nearly are those that live in open arboreal surroundings, e.g. the fork-tailed drongo, Dicrurus adsimilis divaricatus (Licht.) and the wood-hoopoe, Phoeni- culus purpureus marwitzi (Rchw.)-to quote local races. A large proportion of the other open country species live in temperature conditions more extreme than the "general" climate: how much more extreme we have no definite data to decide. But almost certainly within tall grass the modification factor is above + 40 C. in maxima. On the other hand we have found the corre- sponding factor for forest undergrowth to be -40 C. So that the difference between the maximum temperatures encountered by birds in the two habitats, which often occur in immediate proximity, is as much as that involved in at least 5000 ft. range of altitude. It is to be noted that the temperature differentiation with altitude ex- presses itself primarily in the minima, which change, as shown in Text-fig. 2, twice as fast as the maxima: whereas the eco-climate temperature differentia- tion lies principally in the maxima. Excepting where local topography favours accumulation of cold-air drainage, it appears from what we have said above that whatever the nature of the habitat its minima as a rule diverge com- paratively little from the "general" minima. It would follow from this that eco-climatic modification of temperature is not generally capable of completely counteracting altitudinal modification, or that the "general" climate of any given altitude could be duplicated in an eco-climate at another altitude. Thus, Journ. of Animal Ecology iI 5</page><page sequence="28">66 A Contribution to Tropical African Bird-Ecology for example, the forest eco-climate at 2000 ft. may agree with the " general" climate at 4000 ft. in maxima, but it cannot in minima. These facts introduce somewhat new ideas. In the first place it appears that in the general course of their existence a great many birds are (largely owing to their small size) enveloped in much higher air temperatures than are human beings inhabiting the same locality. Birds may, and do, evade, the full eco-climatic extremes temporarily. Thus, by burying themselves at midday in the depths of a mass of vegetation of type (b) (i) they remove themselves from the immediate proximity of the heat surfaces. (As stated at the beginning of this section, sun temperatures are excluded from this discussion.) But none the less many species will during their periods of activity be fully exposed to the eco-climatic extreme of their habitat. Secondly, the eco-climatic differences between habitats in immediate proximity may be of direct significance in distribution. We have accepted the working hypothesis that comparatively small differences in temperature may be effective in differentiating altitudinal life zones. The differences be- tween contiguous habitats are of the same order. It follows that such habitats may be differentiated by their eco-climatic peculiarities no less than by their material physiognomy. V. SUMMARY. This discussion is preliminary to an attempt to describe in as much signi- ficant detail as possible the distribution of the habitats of the birds of the Usambara, a mountainous area in East Tropical Africa. African ornithology has shown a very strong bias in favour of the geographical aspect. Little critical ecological work has been done and it has seemed desirable to investigate de novo the principles with reference to which local bird ecology should be worked out. Rainfall (as affecting vegetation) and also temperature have been cited by certain workers as master factors in determining the distribution of African birds. Altitude has generally been treated as of great importance, but not, it appears, in a critical spirit. On consideration it is evident that the two determinable concomitants of increasing altitude are decreasing temperature and decreasing pressure. The relation between pressure and altitude is practi- call' fixed; but that between temperature and altitude is subject to con- siderable variation (Text-fig. 1). The frequent connection of altitude with increased absolute precipitation is fortuitous. But decreased temperature increases the effect of the same amount of precipitation. In fact temperature and humidity in conjunction determine vegetation, so that they are far from being independent factors. Annual mean temperatures are by no means always satisfactory indices of comparison. Apart from any other factor, climate tends</page><page sequence="29">R. E. MOREAU 67 to become more extreme with increasing altitude, owing to the rapid fall in minima (Text-fig. 2). The environmental factors of potential significance to birds are discussed under the heads biotic (direct and indirect) climatic, subjective. Direct biotic factors in the narrow sense are recognised as insufficient to account for ob- served peculiarities of distribution. Indirect biotic factors include the eco- climates produced in different vegetation types. No records of experimental work on the direct effect of climatic factors on birds have been discovered except for pressure. These experimental results are discussed and reasons are given for rejecting their application under natural conditions. In the absence of experimental data for birds recent advances in insect ecology have been utilised as a guide to the potential significance of climatic factors, due allowance being made for the fundamental physiological difference between birds and insects. As a result of discussion of the individual elements of climate, the hypo- thesis is adopted that temperature may be directly significant even under the equable local conditions; our ignorance of birds' reactions to humidity is too complete to justify a hypothesis: light may be significant under the extreme local conditions. But it is again emphasised that these factors are inter- dependent on each other and on vegetation. Subjective factors are held to cover preferences that cannot be rationalised. Instances are given of such cases and the reality of subjective factors is recognised with reservations. The term " eco-climate " is defined and the physical principles determining the nature and degree of the divergence from the "general" climate are indi- cated on the basis partly of meteorological data obtained from comparable vegetation types in the North Temperate Zone, and partly on actual measure- ments made in Africa. The eco-climates of several important African bird- habitats are sketched. Most of them are more extreme than the "general" climate, the difference lying mainly in the direction of higher day maxima. An exception to this general tendency is provided by eco-climates under overhead shade, of which by far the most important is the eco-climate under a canopy of evergreen forest. There the day maxima are from 3 to 4? C. below those of the "general" climate. In fact eco-climates contiguous vertically or horizontally may differ by 8? C. and even more in maxima: this difference is equivalent to that associated with at least 5000 ft. in altitude. It follows that on the hypothesis of the direct significance of temperature in bird distri- bution eco-climatic differences must have some significance in differentiating habitats. 5-2</page><page sequence="30">68 A Contribution to Tropical African Bird-Ecology REFERENCES.
