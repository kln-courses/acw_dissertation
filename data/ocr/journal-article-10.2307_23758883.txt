This vessel has a diameter of 36 cm, and a maximum height of 8 cm. The plate is in almost pristine condition and also its three hol low supports, or rattle pedestals, are complete. The center of the interior painting is partially eroded and effaced. The excellently preserved underside of the object shows a cut step-fret motif design, the tree oval-shaped supports have two air-holes each (Fig. 1). This artifact has been analyzed in the course of a chemical and stylistic project conducted by Ronald Bishop and Dorie Reents-Budet, and received there the project number MS 1511 (Reents-Budet and Bishop 2003; Looper 2008: 9). The center interior design of the plate's flat interior bot tom depicts on an orange or tawny background a standing anthropomorphic figure, commonly interpreted as the Maya Maize God, with the elongated head turned to the left, as seen by an observer. Both arms are held gracefully outward.The right foot of the personage is on the ground line, and his left leg is bent and the left foot is slightly lifted from the ground border, obviously implying a dynamic dancing pose. The body of this individual is painted overwhelmingly in a solid red, with a few minor black elements. The figure is deco rated with wrist bands and anklets rendered in fine black lines, wears a headdress and a difficult to recognize textile waist belt from which hang long and narrow sashes. The deity holds in his hands some fabric bands. Encircling the deity image are three double lines in black. The interior rim section is painted in red. The buff or cream colored space between the two double lines contain four Fig. 1. Underside of the polychrome ceramic plate (front cover). separate panels in black, composed of repetitive distinctive elements. The provenance of this ceramic vessel is unknown, but it is a typical example painted in the so-called style or tradition of the "Tikal Dancer Plate" corpus of the Late Classic period, ca. 600 - 900 AD, or more specifically ca. 600 - 650 AD. Its presumed place of origin is very probably the Guatemalan Department of Petén. In October 2005 and July 2006 I was shown two poly chrome unprovenanced tripod dancer plates displaying the same iconographie style and theme in an art gallery in Vienna, Austria, which are part of an Australian private collection. Both vessels are hitherto unpublished and I was permitted to inspect them and to take measurements and color photo graphs of both specimens. One piece (Fig. 2), has a diameter of 34 cm, and is 8 cm high. The vessel is in a good condition and the three rattle legs are well preserved. In the middle of the vessel is a small drilled hole. The interior design of the plate's bottom is portraying on a cream or orange colored background the dancing Maize God, encircled by a single line and a double line in black. The space between these lines contain repetitive points and geometric motifs in black and red on a creamy background. The outer rim area of the plate is divided into two halves: the right space is a red band, the left section shows on a creamy background a pseudo-glyphic design in red and black. The seven glyphic blocks are accom panied by four bar-and-dot signs, imitating numerals. The standing deity figure is painted in red and black in a dynamic pose, with the profile head, accentuated with a thin black line, turned to the left. The feet are close together and point outwards. Both arms are fully outstretched. The second vessel documented in Vienna (Fig. 3), is gen erally also well preserved. It has a diameter of 32.2 cm, and a height of 8.4 cm. Approximately in the center of the vessel is a irregularly shaped small hole. The center design depicts in red and black, on a cream-colored background, the standing Maize God with the head turned to the left and with the feet pointing outwards. The scene is encircled by three thin red lines and tiny elements on top, then follow above another two mexicon • Vol. XXXII • Oktober 2010</page><page sequence="3">red lines, that frame an inscription consisting of about three dozens of glyphic signs, very probably representing pseudo glyphs. The concentric, intricate glyphic band is painted in black, with a few fine lines in red. Above the inscription is painted a double black line, and a plain red band. The top of the rim is marked by a thin black line. These three unprovenanced ceramic plates, here presented for the first time, belong to a corpus of stylistically and icono graphically related Late Classic ceramic tripod plates, that portray in an elegant, delicate and dynamic style an obvi ously dancing male figure, generally interpreted as God E, the Maize God, Tonsured Maize God, or Foliated Maize God of the ancient Maya pantheon (Taube 1985; 1992:41-50). The first excavated entire plate or dish exhibiting this figurai im agery was discovered at Uaxactun (Smith 1950; Smith 1955: Fig. 73a,1), which led to the naming of this particular picto rial style, the "Uaxactun Dancer" plates, as denominated by Nicholas Hellmuth (Coe 1982: 88; Taube 1985: 177). The next complete specimens of this distinct stylistic plates were excavated at Tikal (Coggins 1975: 440-442; Culbert 1993), a fact that obviously led to rename this special corpus as "Tikal Dancer" plates (Coggins 1975: 442; Reents Budet 1994:197-198). Unfortunately for archaeologists and especially cerami cists and art historians, the overwhelmingly majority of the known and published so-called "Tikal Dancer Plates" with their recurrent and consistent subject matter, are of unknown provenance and were illegally excavated by looters. These plates are now scattered worldwide in private and public collections. Dorie Reents-Budet (1994: 196-199; see also Reents Budet and Bishop 2003, and Reents-Budet, Bishop and McLeod 2003:75-76) has investigated, discussed, and par tially published this particular ceramic corpus. Erik Boot (2003) has presented an excellent essay with an annotated and illustrated overview of twenty-seven examples of "Tikal Dancer" plates, identified the anthropomorphic central figure as the dancing resurrected Young Maize God and suggests as best denomination the "Maize God Tranformation Plates". V ^ m Fig. 2. Plate in a private collection in Vienna. Photo by Karl Flerbert Mayer, 2005 Further studies of this ceramic complex were published by Matthew G. Looper (2008; 2009: 122-129, 243), who states that the Tikal Dancer theme occurs on at least eighty-two tri pod plates made in workshops at the sites, of Tikal, Uaxactun, and smaller centers in the immediate vicinity. Justin Kerr has photographed many Tikal Dancer Plate objects (cf. Looper 2008: 7-9, 2009: Pl. 6). Well-known published examples, whose place of origin cannot be proved until now, are found, for example in Gua temala, the United States, Israel, and Europe. These many examples were all removed illegally from their original ar chaeological context. Such looted and unprovenanced plates and fragments of plates were allegedly found at archaeologi cal sites like Dos Pilas in the Petexbatun Region of the Petén, from Dos Lagunas in the northern Petén (Mayer 2001), from Ramonalito and El Zotz (Reents-Budet 1994: 198). Unprove nanced "Tikal Dancer Plates" are, for example once exhibited or presently permanently residing in Guatemala in the Museo Nacional de Arqueologia y Etnologia in Guatemala City (Gal lenkamp and Johnson 1985: 164, Cat. No. 106; Schmidt et al. 1998: 603, Cat. No. 337; Seipel 2002: 216-217, Cat .No. 97; Talvitie 1997: 85, Cat. No. 7), in the Museo Popol Vuh, Universidad Francisco Marroquin, in Guatemala City (Reents Budet 1994:198, Fig. 5.38, Chinchilla 2003:13-14, Castro 2007: 234-235, Cat. No. 120), and two items are on exhibit in the private museum "Collecciôn Juan Antonio Valdés" at Uaxactun, Petén (Mayer 2001). In the United States examples are housed in the col lections of the Foundation for the Advancement of Mesoa merican Studies, Crystal River, (Reents-Budet 1994:199, Fig. 5.39, 339, Cat. No. 59), in the Duke University Museum of Art, Durham (Reents-Budet 1994: 198, Fig. 5.37), the Mint Museum of Art, Charlotte (Reents-Budet 1994: 197, Figs. 5.35, 536, 339, Cat. No.58; Whittington 2001: 262, Cat. No. 135,264, Cat. No. 137.) and in the Museum of Fine Arts, Bos ton (Boot 2003: 13, No. 23). The Israel Museum, Jerusalem (Coe 1982: 88-89, Cat. No. 44), owns another example. Fig. 3. Another plate in the collection in Vienna. Photo by Karl Herbert Mayer, 2005 mexicon • Vol. XXXII • Oktober 2010</page><page sequence="4">1Q0 In Europe, for instance, there are unprovenanced Tikal Dancer Plates in a private collection In Switzerland (Aveleyra and Pina Chan 1997: 302; Stierlin 1998: 227, Cat. No. 261), as well as in the Rijksmuseum voor Volkenkunde, Leiden, Netherlands (Castro 2007: 234-235, Cat. No. 119). From time to time such plates were offered by art dealers and auction houses in New York City, like Sotheby's (Sothe by's 1999), the André Emmerich Gallery (Emmerich 1984: Cat. No. 34), and Arte Primitivo (Boot 2003: 15, Nos. 26,27), and elsewhere. Whereas most of the complete preserved Tikal Dancer plates are unfortunately of unknown place of origin, and the rare known and published provenanced items stem exclu sively from Uaxactun and Tikal, recent scientific excavations of tombs in the Dolores region of the south-eastern Peten brought to light three entire examples originating from the archaeological sites of Sukche and Ixek, as well as a fine specimen from an elite tomb at Nakum in the north-eastern Peten. These findings question the commonly accepted suggestion or assumption that the Tikal Dancer Plates were produced only at several workshops at Tikal and Uaxactun or exclusively at Tikal, or in the Tikal vicinity (Reents-Budet 1994: 197, 228, 229; Looper 2009 123). The recent discover ies demand the appropriate chemical tests for these plates in order to confirm or reject the current views of a localized style and workshops centered at Tikal and could solve the possibility that they were created outside the Tikal region or were imports from the Tikal sphere. In the following some notes are offered, referring to the definitely provenanced complete seven Tikal Dancer Plate examples, arranged chronologically after their excavations or publication. These data are important in the attempt to trace the original archaeological provenance of the three displaced pottery items presently in Guatemala City and Vienna private collections, and moreover to place them in a reasonable relative chronological framework within the Late Classic period.

Sukche Burial PSP-75 Plate This plate was excavated by Guatemalan archaeologists, headed by Juan Pedro Laporte, from Burial PSP-75, at the site of Sukche or Suk Che in the southeastern part of the Department of Petén. Sukche (spelled also Suk Che'), first reported in 1988, is located 2 km south-west of the town of Dolores (Laporte and Mejia 2000: 214). The excavedplate (Laporte and Alonzo 1994: 479, Fig. 2) is on exhibit in Vitrine 8 in the Museo Regional del Sureste de Petén, in Dolores (Corzo 2005:763). Its inventory number is PSPA-481. The piece has a diameter of 35 cm and a height of 6 cm, its three hollow supports are missing. The ceramic type is Palmar Orange Polychrome. It is dated to Tepeu 2 times of the Late Classic period (Fig. 6). Ixek Burial PSP-80 Plate In 1994, this plate was also excavated by the team of Laporte, at the site of Ixek Central, in the Burial PSP-80 (Laporte and Alonzo 1994: 484, Fig. 3). Ixek (also spelled Ix Ek'), is lo cated near the town of Dolores and has been first reported in 1989 (Laporte and Mejia 2000: 165). The vessel is displayed in Vitrine 8 in the Museo Regional del Sureste de Petén and its inventory number is PSPA-486 (Corzo 2005: 764). The plate has a diameter of 30 cm. The ceramic type is Palmar Orange Polychrome. Chronologically it is assigned to Tepeu 2 times of the Late Classic period (Fig. 7). Nakum Tomb 1 Plate In 2006, this complete lateral-flange tripod plate was ex cavated by the Nakum Archaeological Project of a team of Polish archaeologists from Tomb 1 in Structure 15 at the large ancient settlement of Nakum in north-eastern Peten, Fig. 6.

Photo by Karl Herbert Mayer, 2006 and has been designated as "Vessel 2" (Zralka 2008: 35, Fig. 7a, Zralka, Koszkul and Hermes 2008: 106,110, Fig. 34 c, 111, Figs. 35, 36). The ceramic type of the vessel, a lateral-flange tripode plate with semicylindrical supports, is Saxche Orange Polychrome. The vessel's flange shows a step-fret motif and is covered with blue pigment. The flat interior bottom of the plate is painted with red and orange color and some circular black bands. The centre of the bottom represents a single dancing male figure, judging from the pose and the individu al's raised left leg with an outflung left arm and flying ends of the loincloth ends. It is a typical dynamic image of the Maize God. The plate has a diameter of 38.2 cm (Fig. 8). Text: Karl Herbert Mayer Front Cover: Guatemala City Plate top WMHff \f * K IFts. «/ x ® *?'"
