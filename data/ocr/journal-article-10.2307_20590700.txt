<plain_text><page sequence="1">P OE T R Y EUCHARIST AND ROASTING PHEASANT Selected Poems, by Vernon Watkins. New Directions. $3.00. The sea is almost obsessive in Vernon Watkins' poetry. The two long, fine meditations, Sea-Music for My Sister Travelling and The Broken Sea, conclude this selection, and the sea provides the imagery and music of many of the other poems in the volume. It is a crowded, terrible, "hate-white" sea, the track of error, full of turning weeds, spawning tunnies, the dolphin's gyre, spindrift, narwhals, ice-blocks, Sargasso growths, and the bodies of the dead. Watkins writes to his sister during the war, when seamen drift sun crazed in open boats or scream naked from burning oil, and she, looking down into the shuddering seas from the ship's rail, imagines the unextricated dead in London ruins. These actual horrors tangle in the mind with lyric sea burials in glass coffins or star-white bones lying in vaulted, subaqueous rocks. This sea which once covered all - Watkins writes a sonnet to the Infant Noah and refers often to the Flood - is a mid-term or mid-region between Earth (usually capital ized) and star-traced sky. Earth is the realm of sensitive, blind, natural growth and feeling from which spirit struggles to free itself. The sky is the realm of light and wisdom. In Discoveries, what Copernicus, Galileo, Blake, Donne, Voltaire, Swift, Milton, Blake, Michelangelo discover are the stars, but human eyes give stars their light. Watkins returns frequently to the familiar insight symbol of the time-freed vision: "for a point of light has seeded all," "the self-engendering flame," "the crust breaks in Christ's orig inal radium," "in this cupped hand the breathing light," 170</page><page sequence="2">EUCHARIST AND ROASTING PHEAANT "the lightning's wings are pentecostal tongues." The sea, however, is the center where living and dead, spirits, bodies and spectres swirl together in the confusion of error, until a purified flame "may resurrect/ From the estranging tide/ All lives the Lifeless wrecked." Though the returning dead in the dramatic, highly-charged Ballad of the Mari Lwyd rise from earth, the image they carry is the "Horse of Frost, Star-horse, and White Horse of the Sea." Watkins is giving a folk custom the magic and terror of its remote origins. In Wales on the last night of the year parties of singers and wits carry this carved figure to the door, and try to win admission to food and drink in a rhyming contest with the dwellers in the house. In boy hood, listening, Watkins imagined the horse's head as a festooned skull, "surrounded by all kinds of claims and holy deceptions." The swinging pendulum, which makes one of the many rhythms of this complexly musical choral poem, carries us to midnight, the last breath of the year, "the mo ment," Watkins says in an explanatory note, "of supreme forgiveness, confusion and understanding, the profane and sacred moment impossible to realize while the clockhands divide the Living from the Dead." Rhyming voices call back and forth through the bolted door, voices of the hungry dead, their red throats parched for gin, and of the frightened living who reject them. The doubtful claims on Charity by those outside, the too-eager denial by those within, and the general confusion of body and soul, of Eucharist and roasting pheasant, make paradox and oxymoron natural forms of expression in this poem, with its gleaming shadows, saints who are devils, and hated lechers with holy songs. Sometimes elsewhere such schemes seem literary or devised, as in 'life withered back to water 171</page><page sequence="3">P O E T R Y from a rock," but in many poems Watkins gets close im aginatively to the primitive sense of mana, of forces within natural objects and phenomena which may be either good or bad according to the way in which they are approached or used, and which remain dangerous as long as the power lasts. This sense precedes religiously the separation of spirits, demons, or anthropomorphic gods from the objects which become their emblems. It is present in many of Watkins' rather folkish Christian references, in the power and frightfulness of the holy rood and "loaves of light." Though there is abstract mention of pride, love and judg ment, and a gently luminous poem on a mother nursing: "his mouth under darkness clings/ To the night-surrounded milk in the fire of her hair," Watkins' imagination is cosmic, generic and primitive, and only indirectly human and social. He names Yeats frequently, but has little of Yeats's intellec tual definition, and gives little sense of personal experience, of the relation of individual sensibility to ideas, and of the extent to which human happiness and religious meaning lie in individual action, in the dramatic relation of person to person, human or divine. There are perhaps too many bones, mummies and lepers. The poem on the shooting of Werfel, one of the few dealing with a specific event, de scribes Werfel's seeking "in each the return of the Saviour," but makes him dominantly a kind of wood demon who has put forth antlers, 'like those invisible ones of Moses," a tree god whose "pines stood up in my blood's meadows." Watkins rhymes richly and in varied meters, subtly changing rhythm and pace within the lines. Except for occasional periphrases he uses without strain the language of ordinary communication. There is a great deal of as sonance and alliteration, sometimes nearer to Poe than 172</page><page sequence="4">EUCHARIST AND ROASTING PHEASANT Hopkins in lines like: And truth and tomb and doom and double dye or And the brown ignorant water bindweed breeds Not caring there what brow it braids. His meaning is sometimes obscure, but becomes less so as more poems are read, for Watkins' associations are not hidden or arbitrary, and there are no erudite mystifications. Where the difficulties are not intrinsic, they are largely a matter of syntax, which is sacrificed to the poetry. In the later poems sentences are twenty or thirty lines long; even in shorter poems it is not always at first clear what modifies or refers to what, a little like reading Latin without benefit of inflection. But the elements cohere imaginatively the more the poems are read, and the longer ones often achieve rhapsodic magnificence without losing their firm feeling and distinctiveness of vision.
