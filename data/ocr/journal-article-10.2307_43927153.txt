<plain_text><page sequence="1">REMARKS ABOUT THE STUDY OF PREDYNASTIC EGYPT Rodolfo Fattovich* This paper is dedicated to the memory of Claudio Barocas. I met Claudio in 1970, when I moved to the University of Rome "La Sapienza" for my specialisation in Oriental Archaeology, and we soon became close friends. A few years older than I was, Claudio al- ready was a very competent Egyptologist with many innovative ideas about the way to study ancient Egypt. In particular, he emphasised the need to identify the internal categories of ancient Egyptian cul- ture rather than using Western ones for a more accurate interpreta- tion of this civilisation. I learned a lot from him and his lesson is still a significant component of my approach to the study of the past. His premature death was a great loss to Egyptology. In my opinion, on the basis of a general assessment of the state of art in the study of Predynastic Egypt, the investigation of this period is today at risk of entering into a dead end, despite the indisputable advancement of knowledge in the last two decades. Actually, we now have an increasing amount of factual data without any innovative approach to the reconstruction of the historical process that led to the establishment of the Thinite state in the late 4th millennium BC. In this paper I shall try to: 1) outline the development of the study of Predynastic Egypt in the last fifty years, 2) provide an assessment of the current trends in this area of research, and 3) suggest an agenda for future investigation of this period of Egyptian history Introduction I began ago, when to be at interested the age of in fifteen the study I was of fascinated Predynastic by Egypt1 the illustration over fifty of years the ago, when at the age of fifteen I was fascinated by the illustration of the Narmer Palette in Alan Gardiner s Egyptian Grammar2 that my father gave to me in 1961. 3 This illustration stimulated a great curiosity to understand the * University of Naples "l'Orientale", Naples (Italy). 1 The Predynastic Period conventionally corresponds to the formative period of the ancient Egypt- ian state in the 4th millennium BC, when hierarchical societies and petty kingdoms emerged in the low- er Nile Valley, up to the unification of the whole region to the north of the First Cataract into one terri- torial state at the end of the 4th millennium BC (see. Bard 1999, 2008, pp. 91-108; Shaw 2000). 2 Gardiner 1957, p. 7. 3 In 1969 I graduated in Classics from the University of Trieste with a dissertation about the origin of sacral kingship in Egypt, under the tutorship of Prof. Claudia Dolzani (Egyptology) and Prof. Luigia A. Stella (History of Religions); see Fattovich 1970. In 1972 I got the specialization degree in Oriental Archaeology at the University of Rome "La Sapienza" with a dissertation on the social and economic de- velopment of Egypt in Predynastic times, under the tutorship of Prof. Salvatore M.

From Culture History to Post-processualism: Predynastic Egypt from the 1960s to 2000s In the 1960s the study of Predynastic Egypt was a marginal area of investiga- tion in Egyptology. Most scholars believed that an appropriate reconstruction of this period was impossible because of the lack of written sources.8 Re- constructions of the origins of the ancient Egyptian state based on later tex- tual evidence were largely accepted,9 and a few scholars still ascribed the rise of this state to a dynastic race.10 Archaeological research was mainly aimed at describing the Predynastic cultures,11 in a culture-historical paradigm.12 The chronology was based on the Sequence Dating system W. Flinders Petrie outlined in the 1890s and Werner Kaiser revised in the 1950s,13 as well as on cross-dating with Near Eastern evidence.14 The paleoenvironmental context examined the collection of Predynastic ceramics from Hamamiya in the Egyptian Museum, Turin; see Fattovich 1978. From 1977 to 1984 I was co-principal investigator with Maurizio Tosi on the Italian Archaeological Expedition to Zuwaidah (Petrie's South Town) of the Oriental Institute, Naples, under the direction of Claudio Barocas; see Barocas 1986; Barocas, Fattovich, Tosi 1989; Pirelli 1998; Fattovich 2001; Fattovich et al 2007. Finally, from 1987 to 1990 1 co-directed with Sandro Salvatori the Archaeological Expedition in the Eastern Nile Delta of the Centro Studi e Ricerche Ligabue, Venice; see Chłodnicki, Fattovich, Salvatori 1991, 1992a, 1992b. 4 Most of my research has focused on the development of early states in the northern Horn of Africa and the trade between the Mediterranean Sea and Indian Ocean via the Nile Valley and Red Sea, ca. 4,000 BC to AD 1,000; see e.g., Fattovich 2010; Bard, Fattovich 2010. 5 See Fattovich 1970, 1973, 1978, 1979, 1982a, 1982b, 1984, 1987, 1988a, 1988b, 1998, 1999, 2001, 2007; Fattovich, Malgora, Pirelli, Tosi 2007; Bard, Fattovich 2001; Barocas, Fattovich, Tosi 1989; Chłodnicki, Fattovich, Salvatori 1991, 1992a, 1992b. 6 I have limited my remarks to the Predynastic Period only, without considering the Early Dynastic Period. 7 I agree with the historians, anthropologists and archaeologists who suggest that history did not begin with the invention of writing, ca. 5,000 years ago, but with the appearance of anatomically mod- ern humans, ca. 125,000 years ago.

A Dead End? Predynastic Egypt in the 21st Century My opinion is based on a review of the following sources, which may well represent trends in the research in the past ten years:35 a) The papers presented at the four international conferences Egypt at its Origins . b) The catalogue of the exhibit Before the Pyramids . The Ońgins of Egyptian Civilisation (Oriental Institute, Chicago, March 28-December 31, 2011). c) The last ten issues of the journal Archéo-Nil. d Three monographs which have been published by Beatrix Midant-Reynes, David Wengrow and Robert J. Wenke, respectively, in the 2000s. My review is aimed at identifying: 1) the main sources of recorded data, 2) the major themes of research, 3) the paradigm which, consciously or uncon- sciously, is at the base of the research, and 4) the actual advancement and in- novation in the interpretation of the recorded evidence in comparison with the one suggested in the 1980s when I was more active in this field. Data sources Thirty-two papers out of 171 in the proceedings of the conferences Egypt at its Ońgins (i-iii) and abstracts of Egypt at its Origins iv are based on the evidence from Hierakonpolis in Upper Egypt and 23 papers on the evidence from Tell el-Farkha in Lower Egypt. Other represented sites are: Abydos (8 papers), Adaima (4 papers), el-Ma- hasna (3 papers), el-Abdiya (2 papers), el-Adwa (1 paper), Zawaydah/Naqada (1 paper), el-Amra (1 paper), Mo'alla (1 paper), Nag el-Qarmila (1 paper) in Upper Egypt; and Tell el-Iswid (3 papers), Abu Rawash (2 papers), Khom el-Khilgan (2 papers), Minshat Abu Omar (2 papers), Helwan (1 paper), Maadi (1 paper), Tell el-Fara'in (1 paper) in Lower Egypt. 31 Bard 1992; Baines 1995; Midant-Reynes 2003; Wengrow 2006; Hendrickx, Huyge, Wen- drich 2010. 32 Trigger 2006, pp. 444-478. 33 For a definition of historical process see Fattovich 1990. 34 For an extensive bibliography of the prehistory of Egypt see Hendrickx 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2009; Hendrickx, Claes 2010, 2011. 35 I have only considered the papers about the Predynastic Period, not those about earlier or later periods.</page><page sequence="5">[5] REMARKS ABOUT THE STUDY OF PREDYNASTIC EGYPT 2Ó1 Hierakonpolis, Abydos and Tell el-Farkha are the sites more extensively examined in the catalogue of the exhibit Before the Pyramids . The Origins of Egyptian Civilisation. These papers /chapters clearly indicate that at present most of the knowl- edge about the Predynastic Period in Egypt depends on the results of field- work at Hierakonpolis and Tell el-Farkha, while Abydos remains a crucial source of information about Dynasty o. Main themes of research The proceedings of the four conferences Egypt at its Origins include 35 papers with field reports, 26 papers about artifacts, 21 papers about the process of state formation (both general interpretations and remarks on specific aspects of this process), 13 papers about the interaction with other regions, 12 papers about philology and writing, 9 papers about visual culture, 9 papers about physical anthropology, 8 papers about technology, 7 papers about regional interactions between Upper and Lower Egypt, 6 papers about the paleoenvi- ronment, 5 papers about funerary and cult architecture, 5 papers about the symbolic culture (religion and rituals), 5 papers about funerary analysis, 4 papers about potmarks, 3 papers about rock-art, 2 papers about chronology and 1 paper about settlement patterns. These papers point to: 1) a bias of the description of the results of fieldwork (35 papers), and description and/ or analysis of artifacts, including cult and fu- nerary structures (34 papers); 2) the process of state formation (21 papers) and the interactions of the human groups in Upper and Lower Egypt at both a re- gional and interregional scale (20 papers); 3) an interest in the earliest written documents and potmarks (16 papers), visual culture (9 papers), as well as physical anthropology (9 papers); 4) a minor concern with the paleoenviron- ment (6 papers), symbolic culture (5 papers), funerary analysis (5 papers), chronology (2 papers) and settlement patterns (1 paper). Three papers pre- sented at the fourth conference in New York indicate an emerging concern with the rock-art. The contributions to the catalogue of the exhibit Before the Pyramids. The Origins of Egyptian Civilisation deal with the same basic themes:36 origins of the Pharaonic state (6 papers); culture history (3 papers); relations between Egypt and the surrounding regions (2 papers); relative chronology (1 paper); history of archaeological research (1 paper); material culture (1 paper); visual culture (1 paper); and writing (1 paper). A similar trend can be observed in the last ten issues of Archéo-Nil. Two is- sues (no. 12, 2002 and no. 13, 2003) are entirely dedicated to reports of field- work in Upper and Lower Egypt, and the western Desert. One issue (no. 14, 36 T EETER 2011.</page><page sequence="6">2Ó2 RODOLFO FATTOVICH [6] 2004) focuses on Egypt and the surrounding regions in the 5th-4th millennia BC. Two issues deal with the origins of funerary architecture (mainly in the Early Dynastic Period) (no. 18, 2008) and rock-art (no. 19, 2009). One issue (no. 21, 2011) focuses on the relative chronology from the Paleolithic to Naqada III. Two issues (no. 15, 2005 and no. 20, 2010) contain articles about interaction with the surrounding regions (6 articles), recent fieldwork (2 articles), arti- facts (1 article), potmarks (1 article), symbolic culture (1 article) and visual cul- ture (1 article).37 Besides fieldwork, which obviously is the background for the entire re- search, the following themes of investigation appear to be the most relevant ones:38 1) material culture (artifacts, buildings and tombs), including technol- ogy and archaeometry; 2) origins of the pharaonic state, with an emphasis on the emerging of the institution of kingship; 3) interregional interaction, mainly with the Levant and Nubia; 4) origins of writing, including potmarks; 5) regional interaction between Upper and Lower Egypt; 6) visual culture, in- cluding ichonography and rock-art; 7) symbolic culture; 8) chronology; 9) fu- nerary analysis; and 10) settlement patterns. Physical anthropology and paleoenvironmental studies, though represent- ed by a few papers (9 and 6, respectively) in the proceedings of the confer- ences Egypt at its Ońgins, appear marginal in the general context of the re- search. Most themes are in the tradition of studies of Predynastic Egypt since the very beginning of the research in the late 19th - early 20th century.39 The in- vestigation of the origins of writing, which developed in the last twenty years as a consequence of the impressive discovery of the tags and painted jars in Tomb U-j at Abydos, is the only new theme of research.40 Rock-art is another theme of research getting more attention in the last ten years,41 after being almost completely neglected for many decades since the early work of Winkler.42 The relevant contribution of this art to under- standing the origins of Egyptian civilization, however, was already recog- nized in the late 1960s and early 1970s.43 Paradigms of research The three monographs, I have examined, demonstrate that the main theo- retical approaches, which characterized archaeological thought in the 20th century, are influencing the study of Predynastic Egypt. 37 Two issues (16, 2006 and 17, 2007) are dedicated to the prehistory of Sudan and the pioneers of prehistoric studies in Egypt, respectively. 38 I have ordered the themes in a sequence approximately corresponding to the number of published papers. 39 See e.g. Petrie 1920a, 1920b; Capart 1905; Moret, Davy 1923; Wainright 1938. 40 See Stauder 2010. 41 See also Wilkinson 2003; Röhl 2000; Judd 2009. 42 Winkler 1938. 43 Huard, Leclant 1972.</page><page sequence="7">[y] REMARKS ABOUT THE STUDY OF PREDYNASTIC EGYPT 263 Beatrix Midant-Reynes maintains a culture-historical approach, with an emphasis on the ideological aspects of the Predynastic culture,44 conforming to the culture-historical paradigm which still dominates Egyptology despite intermittent attempts to connect the discipline to the social sciences.45 David Wengrow suggests an interpretation of the manipulation of the body by funerary rituals to generate new personal identities as a consequence of the emerging state in a post-processual perspective.46 Robert J. Wenke focuses on the social and economic transformations which characterized the early development of the Egyptian state in the clas- sic processual perspective of the 1980s.47 This survey of the papers and books which have been published in the 2000s indicates that most of the current research is conducted in an "updat- ed" culture-historical perspective with some post-processual intrusions, such as e.g., the use of structuralism in the analysis of visual culture.48 The re- search consists mainly of descriptions of excavations, artifacts and architec- ture, which are used to generate "historical" narratives of the origins of Egyptian civilization. Post-processual foci, such as e.g., agency, embodiment, identity, personhood, etc., are barely discussed. The culture evolutionary ap- proach, which underlies the study of Egyptian state formation in the 1970s and 1980s, has been almost completely abandoned, as can be inferred from the few papers about funerary analysis and settelement patterns, which were important themes of research in the those years.49 This approach still survives in the analysis of state formation by Branislav Andelkovic.50 Advancement of the Research At present, the results of fieldwork in progress at Hierakonpolis and Tell el Farkha are the major advancements in the research about Predynastic Egypt, as excavations at these sites are providing much new data, which significant- ly contribute to a more detailed knowledge of this period. These results provide a partial (and heavily biased on specific contexts) per- ception of the historical dynamics that generated the pharaonic state. The ex- cavations at Hierakonpolis, in particular, suggest that this settlement was the focal center in the political geography of late prehistoric Egypt and thus had a crucial role in forging the early Egyptian state. It is possible, however, that other contemporary, large settlements occurred in Upper Egypt and may have been as powerful as Hierakonpolis:51 Thinis, which has never been lo- cated; Naqada South Town (Zuwaidah), which occupied a small area (ca. 1.5 44 Midant-Reynes 2003. 45 Weeks 1979; Trigger 1993, 2003; Lustig 1997; Baines 2011. 46 Wengrow 2006. 47 Wenke 2009. 48 See Graff 2005, 2009; Hendrickx 2011. 49 See also Stevenson 2009. 50 Andelkoyić 2004, 2008, 2010, 2011; see also Fattovich 2007; Köhler 2010. 51 Baines 2004, p. 3.</page><page sequence="8">2Ó4 RODOLFO FATTOVICH [8] hectares), but may be mostly covered by alluvial silts;52 and Gebelein, where prestige artifacts have been excavated, suggesting that a wealthy elite was al- so buried here.53 The perception of the number (and possible roles) of the earliest chiefdoms and petty kingdoms that we presently have,54 therefore, may be misleading in the absence of a more complete analysis of settlement patterns along the entire lower Nile Valley 55 New data from fieldwork in the 1990s and 2000s has at least provided a bet- ter understanding of the interaction between Egyptian communities and those of Palestine and Nubia in the 4th millennium BC.56 The investigation about the origins of writing and possibly its relationship with earlier visual art is the most remarkable advancement in the knowledge of Predynastic Egypt during the last two decades.57 In the absence of more evidence, however, this theme of research might soon be exhausted, as what happened with Mycenean philology in the 1980s. No real advancement can be observed in the interpretation of the process of state formation, however. New archaeological data have just added more factual information about this process, but have not changed the basic re- constructions, which were suggested in the 1980s.58 On the whole, the current research fluctuates between rigorous descrip- tions of factual data (that by itself is a crucial contribution) and speculative (and often untestable) interpretations of the evidence.59 Moreover, even a cursory look at the quoted literature in the bibliography of the publications indicates that most research is self-referencing60 and more and more isolated from the main trends in archaeology.61 3. A Way Out? A Tentative Agenda for Future Research In this section I shall try to suggest a few ideas, which in my opinion might be useful to revitalize the study of Predynastic Egypt in the upcoming years. I have no pretensions of being exhaustive in my suggestions or outlining an alternative reconstruction of the latest prehistory in the lower Nile Valley. I am actually convinced that the general sequence of social, economic and ideological changes emerging from the last decades of culture-historical and 52 Fattovich et al. 2007 : Di Pietro 2010. 2011. 53 Quibell 1902; Donadoni Roveri 1999. 54 See e.g., Kemp 2006: fig. 22. 55 Unfortunately, a systematic investigation of the settlement patterns in Upper Egypt is almost im- possible now, because most sites along the edge of the low desert have already disappeared or are on the way to disappearing because of recent agricultural development; see Bard 2008, p. 55. 56 See e.g. Braun 2011. 57 See e.g. Ansein 1999; Kahl 2001; Baines 2004, 2007, 2010; Wengrow 2006, 2011. 58 See e.g. Fattovich 1984, 2007; Hassan 1988; Bard 1992; Jiménez Serrano 2008; Campagno 2011; Castillos 2011; Köhler 2010. 59 See e.g. Graff, Eyckerman, Hendrickx 2011; Hendrickx, Eyckerman 2011; Hendrickx 2011. 60 See e.g. the bibliography in Teeter 2011, pp. 265-288. 61 See e.g. Bentley, Maschner, Chippendale 2008.</page><page sequence="9">[9] REMARKS ABOUT THE STUDY OF PREDYNASTIC EGYPT 265 processual research is basically good, and will not be greatly modified in the future.62 I believe, however, that a change in the perspective with which we are looking at the cultural developments in Egypt during the 4th millennium BC may be required to take a step forward in the understanding of the his- torical dynamics of this period. So far, I feel, scholars (including myself) were only dealing with the upper aspects of the process (i.e., the most evident as- pects of it, such as e.g., the subsistence economy, craft specialization, social hierarchy, rituals, legitimation of power, etc.), without going into the deeper currents that led to the rise of the Pharaonic civilization.63 My basic assumption is that archaeology must not be limited to a mere re- construction of the past (even in a very detailed way and with a great deal of data), in order to provide an historical narrative at different scales of tempo- ral and spatial resolution.64 Archaeology must contribute to explain how his- torical processes work in order to understand how the present emerged from the past and may evolve into the future.65 This goal requires, above all, a re- thinking of what the "Predynastic Period" was in Egyptian history. The Predynastic Period is usually perceived as the temporal segment in the history of ancient Egypt when the pharaonic state was progressively formed and Egyptian civilization, as we know it in later historical times, arose as a correlate of the state.66 The focus on 'formation and 'rise' has generated an attitude of scholars to investigate this period from a 'ideological' perspective considering: 1) The pharaonic state and civilization as the logical outcome of a sequence of progressive changes in the economic (subsistence, craft specialization, exchange and trade), social (kinship, hierarchy, kingship), and ritual (bur- ial and cult) components of the late prehistoric Egyptian societies, in- cluding administration, writing and visual art as a by-product of the these changes and warfare as the final outcome of these changes.67 2) The (mainly Upper Egyptian) Predynastic culture as the prototype from which later Egyptian civilization originated, and thus the same meaning of later practices and beliefs have often been assigned to Predynastic cul- tural features.68 The Predynastic Period in reality was a time of horizontal (synchronic) and vertical (diachronic) transformations in the behavior of people in Upper and 62 See e.g. Bard 2008, pp. 91-108. 63 Wengrow (2006, 2010) provides the best attempt to penetrate into a deepest level of analysis, but his interpretations, though attractive, are still quite speculative. See also Stevenson 2009. 64 For a definition of scale in archaeology see Lock, Leigh Molyneaux 2006. 65 See Fattovich 1990, 1997. 1 do not mean that archaeology can contribute to predicting the future or that we can find general laws of human cultural behavior as the New Archaeologists of the 1960s and 1970s dreamed. In my opinion, by analyzing material culture archaeology can contribute to a better un- derstanding of the processes that generate changes in human societies and explaining how historical dy- namics works. 66 Assmann 1992. 67 See e.g., Kemp 2006: 73-78; Fattovich 2008; Köhler 2010 68 See e.g., Kemp 2006, pp. 92-99.</page><page sequence="10">266 RODOLFO FATTOVICH [io] Lower Egypt, deeply affecting their daily life through at least thirty-six gen- erations over almost one millennium. These transformations most likely were a gradual process of social evolution,69 even if the ambition of single in- dividuals to get more power may have accelerated the changes at some places in conformity with the punctuated model of biological evolution.70 People in Predynastic Egypt who were experiencing these changes were absolutely not aware that they were building a state, even if they could per- ceive that some individuals were getting more and more political control within the community through time.71 They surely perceived some gradual changes in inter-personal interactions through generations, and could ob- serve that: a) some individuals were distinguishing themselves by assuming different social roles; b) groups of individuals practicing different crafts were forming corporate groups sharing specific knowledge; c) some individuals were practicing new activities; and d) a few individuals (i.e., the emerging elite) were introducing new rituals, most likely to reinforce the relational gap between them and the other members of the community. This period is characterized by interwoven changes in the network of so- cial interaction between the inhabitants of the lower Nile Valley at a micro- scale within families, lineages and small communities; at a middle scale with- in larger communities; and at a macro-scale between different communities and/ or groups of communities based on a common language and/ or politi- cal organization.72 The eventual consolidation of a large territorial state in the late fourth millennium BC was the result of the progressive manipulation and control of the networks of social interaction at the different scales up to the concentration of power in one individual: the king. Demographic growth might have been a relevant factor in the process of social transformation in Predynastic times. Neuropsychology and evolution- ary biology actually demonstrate that communities up to 150/200 people can maintain their cohesion through direct, personal social relations.73 An in- creasing number of people over this threshold required either a split into smaller groups or the invention of new institutions to keep the group cohesive.74 Analysis of this process may thus require a conceptual shift from 'forma- tion to 'transformation/ focusing on the following main changes that may have generated the pharaonic state: 1) The transformation of small segmental communities into larger and more articulate, centralized social aggregates, possibly with a re-organization of 69 Trigger 1998; Carneiro 2003. 70 Gould 2002, pp. 745-1024. 71 See Fattovich 2007. 72 See Knappet 2011. 73 GAZZANIGA 2008: pp. 94. 74 This might stimulate a re-evaluation of the old 'Circumscription Theory' by Robert Carneiro (Carneiro 1970; Bard and Carneiro 1989), but in a modified form: demographic growth generated more articulated social groups through time, rather than conflict between the groups.</page><page sequence="11">[il] REMARKS ABOUT THE STUDY OF PREDYNASTIC EGYPT 267 lineages from a household production mode into a community produc- tion mode involving more lineages in a common activity.75 2) The emergence of new personal identities (to use a favorite concept of the last generation of post-processual archaeologists)76 at the micro- scale, group identities at the middle scale and collective identities at the macro-scale of social interaction,77 and possibly transformation in the personhood of the people,78 as a consequence of the new emerging identities. 3) The modification of the network of social relations, as a consequence of changing patterns of interaction between people with different new iden- tities, up to the emergence of new institutions based on a general con- sensus and enhanced by a common language.79 4) The possible transformation in the minds of the people,80 i.e., the organ- ization of thoughts in a coherent conceptual network providing a gener- al perception and interpretation of the surrounding environment which regulate human actions. 5) The transformation in the cultural memory of individual communities, i.e., in the social construction of their past in the form of historical, myth- ical and cultural narratives, which were at the base of their collective identity.81 6) The re-adjustment of the information flow through the network of social interaction,82 with the consequent use of new visual and (later) written media to transmit information at the different scales of interaction,83 and possibly the emergence of sub-cultures at the different levels of social hierarchy. The reconstruction of these transformations might seem like imaginative speculation in the absence of written records, but actually it is not out of the range of archaeological analysis.84 The most feasible procedure could be, in my opinion, considering the ma- terial culture (artifacts, ecofacts and burials) as an indicator of interaction among people and using social network theory to identify the patterns of so- cial interaction at different scales and their changes through time.85 In such a way, the Predynastic archaeological cultures so far identified could be exam- ined and interpreted as the expression of spatial and temporal changes in the 75 Fattovich 1979, 2007. 76 See e.g. Wengrow 2006; Stevenson 2009. 77 For a general introduction to the archaeology of identity see Diaz-Andreu et al 2005. 78 Wendrich 2010b; for a general introduction to the archaeology of personhood see Fowler 2004; 79 Searle 2010. Unfortunately, we will never know how much the Predynastic Egyptians were re- ceptive to having someone stating that he was needed and thus they had to obey to him! 80 See e.g. Fattovich 2011. 81 Assmann 1992, 2006: 1-30; 2011. 82 Johnson 1978. 83 Baines 2007, pp. 1-30. 84 For an introduction to analytical archaeology, besides the classic Clarke 1968 and doran, hod- son 1975, see Renfrew, Bahn 2004. 85 Knappet 2005, 2011.

Changes in cultural memory, in turn, can be inferred from the iconographie analysis of the visual art.94 Finally, a more precise analysis and interpretation of the cultural transfor- mations which characterize the Predynastic Period will require combining archaeological analysis with the linguistic one in order to possibly identify the local languages and /or dialects that were part of the social interaction at the different scales, and their merging into one official language as a consequence of development of the pharaonic state.95 Conclusion I have no pretensions to change the present trends in the study of Predynas- tic Egypt with these remarks, or to state that previous reconstructions of the origins of the Egyptian state and civilization are wrong and must be aban- doned. I would just like to suggest that a change from 'formation to 'trans- formation in the interpretation of this period, suggesting possible alternative problems, might help scholars to better identify the internal, i.e., specifically Egyptian, cultural rules which modified the behavior of the population during the 4th millennium BC and led to the rise of pharaonic Egypt. A pro- cedure, I think, that Claudio would have appreciated. 86 See Knappet 2011 for an application of Social Network Theory to Minoan Crete. 87 Fattovich 1979: Bard 1994; Stevenson 2009. 88 Wengrow 2006: Stevenson 2009. 89 See Stevenson 2009 for the result of archaeogentic analysis contradicting the hypothesis that the contiguity of burials in the cemetery might represent family groups. 90 Analysis of the genome from human remains in Predynastic cemeteries might provide good evidence of population movements in the 4th millennium BC. 91 Renfrew, Bahn 2004, p. 396. 92 See Stevenson 2011; Hendrickx 2011b. 93 See e.g., Fattovich 2011. 94 See e.g., Hendrickx 2010. 95 See e.g., Ansein 1999.
