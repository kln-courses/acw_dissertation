<plain_text><page sequence="1">America's Measure of Mankind Proportions and Harmonics Jonathan L. Fairbanks Time alters fashions and frequently obliterates the works of art and in- genuity, but that which is founded on Geometry &amp; real Science, will remain unalterable. -Thomas Sheraton, The Cabinet-Maker and Upholsterer's Drau'ing-Book (London, 1791) "Symmetry, Proportions, Order": these three words are repeatedly uttered by Andrew Passeri, a senior craftsman and traditional uphol- sterer who restores historic furni- ture for the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. His emphasis on these words suggests that successful de- sign of three-dimensional works of art depends largely on the precise division of parts and the resolution of spaces in and between these parts. Such divisions are resolved either empirically, using compass divisions and draftsmanship, or more abstractly, using mathematics and geometry. It is not surprising, therefore, that Thomas Sheraton (1751-1806) considered geometry the founda- tion of lasting art or that Thomas Chippendale (1718-1779) wrote about the importance of under- standing classical orders and pro- portions in architecture and cabinetmaking.1 Geometry, order, and proportions are all fundamen- tal to the subject of symmetry, which was central to the aesthetics of eighteenth- and nineteenth- century art. Chippendale, Sheraton, and many other designers also thought the five classical orders-- Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, and Composite-and their propor- tions were of primary importance in creating successful art. By apply- ing classical proportions, they ac- knowledged the authority of the an- cient past, thereby illuminating their own search for universal prin- ciples of symmetry and propor- tions or patterns from an ancient or "divine" plan. The same princi- ples were involved in taking mea- surements of the human body in order to rationalize proportions in furniture, interior space, and sculp- ture. Because mankind was thought to be the focal point of an earth- centered universe, measures based on body units-the foot, face, or hand-were employed by many civilizations. The search for abso- lute harmonies in human propor- tional form and in the three- dimensional arts is an ancient quest. Through generations of re- finement and interpretation, pro- portional systems ultimately deriv- ing from classical antiquity have found their way into American fur- niture, architecture, and sculpture over the past three centuries. Measurement ideals for the hu- man body are generally based on Renaissance art theory, which took inspiration from antiquity. The pro- portions of today's high-fashion models often conform to the ten face length, ideal figural stan- dards articulated by Marcus Vitruvius Pollio, a celebrated Roman ar- chitect who served under Julius Caesar and Augustus.

This search for ideal variations on the geometry of human mea- surement has occupied artists for many generations: the most famous analysis is Leonardo da Vinci's drawing of the norm-man with arms and legs outstretched within a circle and a square.2 The evolution of various proportional systems in Western art has been complex. It is important, however, to recognize the influence early theoretical writ- ings and studio/shop practices had on early American furniture, sculp- ture, architecture, and design. One of the earliest books in the English language to discuss human proportions was a work translated by Richard Haydocke and printed in London in 1598. The original book, Trattato or Tract Contain- ing the Artes of Curious Painting, which became the bible of the Man- nerist style, was written in 1571, by Giovanni Paolo Lomazzo who was strongly influenced by the theories of Leonardo. Havdocke's version of the Trattato contained several en- gravings illustrating human propor- tions that were based not only on Leonardo's works, but also on Durer's complex proportional stud- ies. The substance of the English text, which was repeatedly plagia- rized throughout successive centu- ries, was known in Boston as early as 1670, if not before.3 Early New Englanders also had means other than the written word helpful in generating proportional systems. Traditional apprenticeship encour- aged the repetition of craft prac- tices. Carefully proportioned chests, chairs, and other articles of household furniture, together with tools, dividers, and measuring rules useful in shaping the human habitat, arrived with the new set- tlers. Established shop traditions maintained old proportional ideals, while successive generations of newcomers brought new shapes and ideas to furniture and the con- figuration of enclosed spaces. The changing physical stature of the colonists probably had less to do with changing the proportions of furniture and architecture than did evolving technologies and chang- ing perceptions of proportional sys- tems. Growing awareness of classi- cism on the part of the craftsmen gradually developed a conscious following of academic formulae. In America, awareness of the rules of classical antiquity in- creased dramatically in the eigh- teenth century. One of the most admired examples of classical inspi- ration in American furniture is a chest-on-chest owned by the Mu- seum of Fine Arts, Boston (fig. 1). Traditionally attributed to the carv- ing shop of Samuel McIntire (1757-1811) and the cabinet shop of a Mr. Lemon, both of Salem,4 the chest is constructed on a pro- portional scheme favored in mid- eighteenth-century Boston and North Shore areas. The basic cabinetwork consists of one chest of drawers set on top of another. Both chests are almost square in frontal elevation, yet with the addi- tion of moldings, feet, entablature, and pediment they appear as a sin- gle unified composition conform- ing to proportions based upon the golden section.5 The golden sec- tion or golden mean is a Pythago- rean proportional system that di- vides a line into two parts so that the smaller segment relates to the larger segment as the larger seg- ment relates to the whole. Each drawer of the chest-on-chest in- creases one inch per drawer in ver- tical depth from top to bottom. The columns that flank the upper chest belong to the Composite order and appear to be copied directly from Sheraton's Drawing-Book (fig. 2).

Mahog- any, 13V/2 in. high (foot to top ofhead) umns demonstrates that the ma- ker was fully aware that the capital must measure exactly one-tenth of the column's entire height. And this is only one measurement in a thoroughly integrated system of di- vided parts that add up to a visually handsome whole. The process of design is academic: it conforms to rules. Consciously applied mod- ular schemes of measure are not unique to this piece-Stephen Badlam's chest-on-chest (Yale Uni- versity Art Gallery),6 as well as the carved ornaments and figures on both McIntire and Badlam chests, used modular measurements. The female figure of Fame (fig. 3) on the McIntire chest measures thirteen and one-half inches from her foot to the top of her head and one and one-half inches across the chest (from nipple to nipple). The latter measurement corresponds to the length of the facial index-the vertical length from the chin to the upper edge of the medal at her breast-and is also equal to the dis- tance from the medal to a point at the bottom of the xiphoid process of her sternum. These equally di- vided segments follow through the rest of Fame's body: sternum to na- val, navel to pubis, pubis to mid- thigh, mid-thigh to knee; the re- mainder is obscured by the dress. The face is divided vertically into three equal parts (forehead, nose, and nose to chin), each seven- sixteenths of an inch. Thirty-one of these parts yield the overall height of the figure with the face length very close to one-tenth of the over- all height of the figure. Many other measurements can be made to demonstrate the various divisions implicit in the figure. Analyses of proportions attributed to this work would be speculative if a sketch from McIntire's hand had not sur- vived. Made sometime after the wa- termark of 1802-a date integral to the paper on which the drawing was made-the sketch shows that the Salem carver, architect, builder, and dancing master was conversant with neoclassical order (fig. 4). McIntire proportionately delin- eated both male and female figures to correspond in their overall heights to about seven and three- quarters head lengths or ten face lengths. A London engraving, show- ing measurements of the Venus de Medici and the Antinois, seems a likely source for his ideas about measurements (fig. 5). The divisions-"parts" and "m's" (a smaller unit or module)-in the en- graving correspond exactly to the ruled system of measure that he drafted beside the sketches he made. McIntire's rule clearly states that the unit of measure used to generate the whole figure is not ac- tually dependent upon the length of the human head or the face. The scale of the rule in the center of his drawing specifies a unit called a "part." This unit equals the length of the nose which, in turn, is equal in dimension to the space between the lower edge of the tip of the nose and the bottom of the chin. The "part" is also equal to the verti- cal distance from the upper edge of the upper eyelid to the lower edge of the hairline of the fore- head. When the "part" in McIntire's drawing is multiplied thirty-one times the sum is equal to the entire height of both the male and the female figures. In addition, each "part" in McIntire's scheme is sub- divided into twelve units desig- nated "m" (presumably modules). With "parts" and modules McIntire or his workmen could use com- passes and rulers to create detailed layouts for carving properly propor- tioned figures (heroic or miniature scale) while maintaining total har- mony with the classically derived orders of his architecture or furni- ture. His system was practical, di- rect, and capable of great refine- ment: time was not wasted upon theoretical analyses of actual an- 76 Winter 1988</page><page sequence="6">4 Samuel McIntire, Drawings of the Propor- tion of the Human Figure, ca. 1802.

His scheme differed little in principle from the woodworking practices used to proportion case furniture, orna- ment architecture, or take measure- ments of house carpentry. While the "part"-the length of the hu- man nose-may not have had any connection to the proportions of houses or furniture, there were either real or imagined connec- tions between the size of Fame's head-its relation to the body- and the capital when compared to the total height of the column. They are both ten units. A similar system was used by members of the Skillins family, who carved the figure on Stephen Badlam's chest- on-chest. A carved and painted white pine figure (fig. 6) representing Liberty (by an anonymous carver from coastal New England) closely ap- proximates the proportions of the neoclassical system sketched by McIntire. Liberty employs the same system of thirty-one divisions or "parts" to the total height, based upon the length of its nose. Al- though McIntire may not have made this work, the design sug- gests that the carvers of McIntire's generation-those who worked in the early neoclassical vein-did so with traditional rule and compass, dependent upon an age-old meth- od of achieving commensurability by multiplying all parts of the whole by a given unit of body mea- sure as a standard. Of course, the finished work appears to have the proportions of ancient sculpture, which seems to result from techni- cal methods rather than a serious artistic intent. It would remain for the following generation of sculp- tors from this country (especially those Americans who studied abroad, like Horatio Greenough, Hiram Powers, and Thomas Crawford) to achieve greater archeo- logical correctness of proportional measure derived from ancient clas- sical sculpture. The carpenter/carver approach to proportion employed by McIntire was unpretentiously prac- tical. A generation later, however, as the profession of sculpture emerged in this country during the Victorian era, it did so in reference to more complex notions about proportions imported from abroad by American sculptors and through books. A prime example of one such book was published in 1857 by the English sculptor John Gibson and Joseph Bonomi, cura- tor of Sir John Soane's Museum.

I?- ' / / Handed Down to Us by Vitruvius, went through several editions and remained a standard text well into the third quarter of the nineteenth century. In their discussion, which also examined Leonardo's theories, Gibson and Bonomi quote Vitruvius's definition of proportion as the "com- mensuration of the various constitu- ent parts with the whole; in the ex- istence of which symmetry is found to consist."'7 According to the illus- tration of the male body with ex- tended arms, the ideal head mea- sures one-eighth of the total height of the figure; the face, one-tenth (fig. 7). Detailed charts recording precise measures taken from the antique statuary of the Venus de Me- dici, Venus of the Capitol, and oth- ers were included to demonstrate the universality of the laws of pro- portion found in the form of the human body as visualized by fa- mous sculptors and painters of an- tiquity. These rules were adopted by the first generation of American sculptors to go abroad. Orpheus and Cerberus, Thomas Crawford's debut piece in America, reflects the proportional systems of antique classical sculpture (fig. 8).8 Challenging the method of Gibson, Bonomi, and the first gen- eration of American sculptors, but not appreciably changing the mea- surable results from a visible stand- point, the American sculptor William Wetmore Story published his Proportions of the Human Fig- ure According to a New Canon in 1866.9 As well as being a world- renowned sculptor, Story was a classical scholar familiar with Pliny the Elder, whose writings offered some insight into the lost treatise on proportions by the famous Greek sculptor Polycletus. By analyzing Pliny's text, Story con- cluded that Polycletus's sculpture Doryphoros, or Spear Bearer, em- bodied the proportional precepts or symmetry of Polycletus's missing treatise. Story felt he could not only reconstruct the Greek sculp- tor's canon but also actually im- prove upon it, providing modern sculptors with a whole new system for commensurate measure that fit a divine or absolute plan appropri- 5 (Opposite) Proportions of the Human Body Accurately Measured from the Most Ad- mired Antique Statues at Rome, 1789.

Story approached the subject from two directions. First he intro- duced the reader to the Cabala- the mystical writings from ancient Jewish times. By studying this book of Creation, in which the mysteries of the arts and sciences invoked the use of signs, symbols, and num- bers, Story claimed that the mean- ing of proportions and symmetry could be understood. Demon- strating his powers of research and analysis, he also reviewed the exist- ing literature on proportions, from the writings of Leonardo to con- temporary authors of the nine- teenth century such as Gibson and Bonomi. He pointed out the incon- sistency and unreliability inherent in the traditional methods of mea- surement, which based proportion upon a module or unit of the hu- man body such as a head, face, hand, or foot length. By contrast, his system used the absolute geo- metrical units of the circle, square, and equilateral triangle and the sig- nificant numerical divisions within these mystic symbols (fig. 9). At a time of intense religious revivalism worldwide, the import of signs, portents, and symbols was enthusi- astically accepted. Victorians ar- dently believed that beneath the visible or apparent world lay hid- den meanings significant to the soul and the understanding of 81 Smithsonian Studies in American Art</page><page sequence="11">10 William Wetmore Story.

Story explained that the circle-a traditional figure rep- resenting in two dimensions the sphere, or cube circle, generated by the dodecahedron-is, by that relationship, expressive of the num- ber twelve and a geometric figure that "Deity employed in tracing the plan of the universe."10 The trian- gle represents the tetrahedron and through its three sides represents the Holy Trinity and divine nature. The square represents the cube, the embodiment of the number four which Pythagoras preferred. It signifies solidity and manifests the "establishment accorded to law"11 in the world. In using Story's geometric sys- tem, the artist must first arbitrarily determine the overall height of the figure. Then he takes one-fourth of the overall height as the length of the side of an equilateral triangle. Dividing the side of the equilateral triangle into two equal parts, its alti- tude extends below its base line just one-third the amount above it. That produces the diameter of the circle, within which is circum- scribed the triangle and the sides of the square. Subdivisions of these units (based on the mystical num- bers of 3, 6, 12, and 24) are then applied to determine the relative size of the smaller parts of the ideal body of both man and woman according to Story's charts. The system is applied in vertical measure to both sexes with the only differences for male and fe- male being in breadth and thick- ness. Story observed that shoul- ders, expressing strength and ac- tion, dominate the male physique, while the pelvis, expressive of pas- sive endurance, dominates the fe- male form. Overall proportions, however, are the same in both sexes. Story's marble nude figures of Bacchus and Venus Anadyomene embody his new canon of proportions (figs. 10, 11). To rationalize his program and demonstrate that his canon per- fectly coincided with the measure- ments given by Vitruvius and oth- ers, Story appended an impressive table of comparative measure- ments, contrasting the information generated by his system with actual data taken from antique sculpture. His publication is a scholarly piece of work too complex for practical studio use. While is it not possible to demonstrate that Story's Canon became a standard or guide for an enthusiastic following, it does re- 82 Winter 1988</page><page sequence="12">I 12 Martin Milmore, proposal for monument to Governor John A. Andrew, ca. 1865. Por- celain, 21 in. high. Private collection flect a widely shared mind-set and an intense belief in absolute rules of beauty deriving from what was then conceived to be an everlasting cosmic scheme. Numerous discourses on the golden section, harmonic pro- portions, and dynamic symmetry are evidence that the search for and belief in such a divine plan or universal order persisted in Amer- ica throughout the nineteenth cen- tury and well into the twentieth century. In 1908, the Rev. H. G. Wood asserted that the functional purpose of the human body was to put personality in touch with God's work. Wood's Ideal Metrologv de- clared that the ultimate problem of physical science is not merely to weigh and measure physical things but to discover the rationale of God's activity.12 Few persons of that era would have argued against such a statement; yet by the late Victorian period, sculptors and art theorists were exploring ideas and forms that reached beyond ideal proportions. In the 1860s the young Boston sculptor Martin Milmore (1844-1883) struggled with the rather unheroic propor- tions of Governor John A. Andrew's bulk while modeling a proposed heroic monument of this well- known subject (fig. 12). The Civil War governor of Massachusetts would hardly have been recog- nized as an idealized figure. His generous cape was all that could be considered classical.13 Tensions between ideal and ac- tual proportions and ideal and real subject matter plagued artists for at least three generations. Consider the failure of Greenough's depic- tion of George Washington as a semi-clothed Olympian Zeus (Na- tional Museum of American Art, Smithsonian Institution). Average Americans untutored in the mean- ing of classical symbolism found a semi-nude Washington perplexing. Boston's anatomist and sculptor William Rimmer (1816-1879) coped admirably with the problem of variability in human proportions in his superbly illustrated book Art Anatomy published in 1877. He ex- plained that internal consistency within each body type was the an- swer to the commensurability of the parts. His treatise, analogous to those of contemporary phrenolo- gists, explains that different shapes and proportions reveal dis- parate characters in the persons portrayed.14 By the turn of the century, ideal measurements were still eagerly be- ing sought out by sculptors dealing in universal subjects. The English sculptor Albert Toft conceded that the student must closely observe the actual model and accurately render it in clay despite the possi- ble deviations from the ideal. Yet he also maintained, quoting an un- identified Spanish author, that sculpture represents the "music of the spheres made visible, the Ideal manifest unchanging and unchange- able through the Ages!"'5 Such am- bivalence is evident in the works of the American sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens (1848-1907), whose recognizable heroes were accompa- nied by idealized female figures. Other artists, using a somewhat dif- ferent approach to the search for ideal proportions, shifted away from the examination of ancient sculpture and texts to anthropome- try (i.e., measuring and statistically averaging living human beings). Sculptor Henry Hudson Kitson (1863-1947), who made a heroic bronze Minute Man for Lexington, Massachusetts, in 1900, collabo- rated with Harvard University pro- fessor Dudley Allen Sargent to mea- sure the proportions of college stu- dents. The composite findings were tabulated and resulted in ideal measurements for both male and female figures.'6 Using these measurements, Kitson and Sargent concurred that within the Aryan 83 Smithsonian Studies in American Art</page><page sequence="13">race only one type of beauty exist- ed-the ideally proportioned American woman. Such ethnocen- tric studies and nationalistic con- clusions were prevalent in many professions throughout the United States during the time of World War I. The studies of sculptor Malvina Hoffman (1887-1966), however, were quite different. Un- like Kitson, she and others, such as the English sculptor Herbert Ward (1863-1919) who accompanied the Stanley expedition to Africa, seri- ously examined the variability of racial types. Repeated measurements of the human body broke with the Victo- rian canons of Greek art and yielded differentiated sets of mea- surements for male and female fig- ures. Yet the system adopted by art teachers and most sculptors belong- ing to America's National Sculpture Society reaffirmed that the body was divisible into modular units, whether male or female, with head or face lengths setting the standard for the vertical measure at seven and one-half or eight units respec- tively, and with torso and limbs di- visible into equal thirds. By follow- ing these rules one could divide a male figure six feet tall into three twenty-one-inch segments-from the chin to the front ridge of the ilium, to the knee, to the sole of the foot. Identical divisions oc- curred in a female figure measur- ing five feet six inches with each tripart division measuring sixteen and one-half inches.T' This cursory, explanation, however, treats only the gross vertical dimensions of a complex three-dimensional subject (fig. 13). In order to resolve the overall grand scheme or structural order inherent in the numerical, visible, and invisible worlds, sculp- tural application necessitated mi- nutely measured details of propor- tional harmonies in the body. The search for relationships be- tween observed proportions of the ideal human body and that of ge- ometry and numbers continued well into the twentieth century. Re- search in this field was not re- stricted to sculptors, architects, or artists. Samuel Colman and C. Arthur Coan, for example, dealt with theories of harmonic unity governed by proportional form in nature, art, and science,18 while il- lustrator Jay Hambidge analyzed fully Pythagoras's golden section in his work Dynamic Symmetry: The Greek Vase. Claude Bragdon, influ- enced by Hambidge's research, published his poetic and theosophi- cal book The Frozen Fountain at the height of the Art Deco move- ment. Reissued five times between 1924 and 1932, it invoked the use of root rectangles and whirling squares as a means of finding sig- nificant measure and the golden section. Bragdon was also influ- enced by Henry Parker Manning's Geometrp of Four Dimensions, W. S. Andrew's Magic Square and Cubes, and Matila C. Ghyka's Ge- ometry of Art and Life, translated from the French. Ghyka's influen- tial text, based upon Ghyka's Esth6- tique des Proportions dans la Na- ture et dans les Arts, dealt with the cosmic unity in art and life as con- ceived by Plato through mathemati- cal and geometrical principles. Ghyka reaffirmed the essential or- der in all things at a time when artists and the public alike intellec- tually and emotionally desired such assurances. It sustained the func- tionalist point of view expressed by Greenough in his writings on form and function and embraced the Pla- tonic and Pythagorean ideas that structure and numbers were the only things that counted in man- kind's reconstruction of the exter- nal world.19 Rooted in the Euclidean ideal of commensurability of geometric pro- portions and the abstract beauty of human structure, traditional sculp- tors in America perceived perma- 84 Winter 1988</page><page sequence="14">13 Avard Fairbanks, Feminine Figure- Height 5 ft. 6 in., 1936.

Although unspoken, their public works asserted cosmic rela- tionships beneath the surface of ap- pearances. Echoes of these efforts persist today, but the strands of memory are varied. For some indi- viduals proportional ideals support notions of cultural or racial stereo- types. Other persons find propor- tional studies valid and continue their search for norms in human form. Of particular interest is the study of the interactions between the human body and machines. Henry Dreyfuss, influenced by mass mechanization and the ro- mance Americans had with the Ma- chine, considered the human body as a machine to determine its use- ful factors in a mechanistic world. His charts of anthropometric data, some of which are life-size and "suitable for mounting," were pub- lished by the Whitney Library of De- sign in 1959 (fig. 14);Julius Panero and Martin Zelnick's Human Di- mension and Interior Space, pub- lished by the Whitney Library of De- sign in 1979, also explores the con- cept of human proportional theory along these same lines.

These efforts remain a vital field of research for designers, craftsmen, and artists. What were once believed to be unified aesthe- tic systems basic to understanding beauty and truth are now recognized as mutable. Although no longer considered absolute, proportional studies by their very nature are self-regenerating and seem to be leading towards new ends.

Attri- bution to Mclntire is also partly based on a bill from Mclntire to Madam Elizabeth Derby, dated 22 October 1796, for carving a case of drawers. The museum's chest was passed down through the Derby family, but the match of the bill to this piece has long been disputed. See Edwin J. Hipkiss, Eighteenth Century American Arts: The M. and M.

The sculp- tor who won the commission was Milmore's teacher, Thomas Ball (1819- 1911). In 1870 Ball made a figure of Andrew in heroic scale in marble for Doric Hall of the Massachusetts State House. This piece is no more ideally proportioned than Milmore's. 14 William Rimmer, Art Anatomy (Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1877; New York: Dover Publications, 1962). 15 Albert Toft, Modelling and Sculpture (Philadelphia: J.
