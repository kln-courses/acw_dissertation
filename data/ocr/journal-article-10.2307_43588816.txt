The dissertation was written at the Hebrew University and supervised by Profs. A. Ben-Tor and N. Goren-Inbar. I wish to thank them both for dedicating much time to this study and for their many useful comments. I owe many thanks to Prof. J. Perrot of the Centre de Recherche Français de Jérusalem, the excavator of many of the sites discussed in this book, for making pottery assemblages and photo- graphs available to me for analysis and publication. In my work at the laboratories of the Centre I was given every possible support. D. Ladiray and M. Barazani greatly assisted with the preparation of the figures and photographs. The final figures were prepared by H. Betan. J Rosenberg prepared the maps. Parts of this work are based on my excavations at Tel 'Ali (two seasons) and Sha'ar Hagolan (three seasons). These excavations were supported by the Irene Sala CARE Archaeological Foundation, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and the Israel National Council for Research and Development. An additional essential contribution to this work were the finds from Stratum XVIII at Tel Beth Shean, excavated in the early 1930s and now in storage at the University Museum of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia. I am most grateful to Ms. M. de Schauensee, Keeper of the Near Eastern Section, for permission to study and publish these finds. This work was sponsored by the Berman Center for Biblical Archaeology at the Institute of Archaeology of the Hebrew University of Jerusa- lem. I am also grateful to A. Drori, Director of the Israel Antiquities Authority, for permission to study and publish various items in the Authority's storage rooms, and to B. Brandl and his staff for their assistance. Several scholars showed and discussed with me unpublished material from their excava- tions: E. Yannai, E. Galili, N. Getzov, Z. Gal and the late T. Noy. Numerous scholars and institutions kindly con- tributed photographs from their excavations or collections. I am most grateful to J. Perrot, A. Biran, T. Levy, C. Epstein, G. Rollefson, A. Ben- Tor, the Israel Antiquities Authority, the Centre de Recherche Français de Jérusalem, the Israel Mu- seum, the Pontifical Biblical Institute in Jerusalem, the Wilfrid Museum in Kibbutz Hazorea, the Hebrew Union College in Jerusalem, and the Weingreen Museum of Biblical Antiquities of Trinity College, Dublin. The photographers are credited in the list of photographs. Last but not least I would like to thank A. Paris, who translated parts of the manuscript, and S. Gorodetsky, who painstakingly and professionally edited the manuscript, greatly improving both its style and its content.

This geographical area is designated "the southern Levant." Four major chronological units (periods) are defined: Pottery Neolithic, Early Chalcolithic, Middle Chalcolithic and Late Chalcolithic. The relevant stratigraphie evidence is examined and the pottery types of each unit are presented and illustrated with drawings (at a uniform scale, as far as possible) and photographs (not to scale). Regional variations in each of these units are taken into account. The available radio- carbon dates of each period are summarized and evaluated against the stratigraphy and the pottery typology. The 6th-4th millennia bee,* discussed in this work, are a "black hole" in the archaeology of the region. Each scholar who specializes in this period has suggested a different scenario for its period- ization. In Ruth Amiran's classic book The Ancient Pottery of the Holy Land , three out of the four periods discussed here are combined and presented in just one figure (Amiran 1969: Pl. 1). A comprehensive synthesis of the Neolithic and Chalcolithic pottery industries of the southern Levant is therefore long overdue. Two main components in the study of ancient pottery vessels are the typological and the techno- logical aspects. Typological research focuses on the final products and analyzes the shape of the vessels and the patterns of decoration. Technological research focuses on the potter's craft and analyzes the various stages of manufacturing: selection of raw materials, preparation of the mix, building of the vessel, and finally firing. In this book I have concentrated on the typological aspect. * Throughout this volume, uncalibrated radiometric dates appear with the lower-case letters bee, while calibrated dates are designated BCE. 1.1. HISTORY OF RESEARCH It is the common practice in archaeological research of the southern Levant to subdivide the time units discussed in this book into three main successive periods: Pottery Neolithic A, Pottery Neolithic B and Chalcolithic (Kenyon 1960; Aharoni 1982; Mazar 1990; Ben-Tor 1992; Stager 1992). This subdivision is based on Kenyon's excavations at Jericho (Kenyon 1957; 1960). However, it should be emphasized that while this concept has been acceptable to archaeologists working primarily on the Bronze and Iron Ages, scholars specializing in the 6th and 5th millennia bee have observed a much more complex situation (Table 1 presents the main proposals). Nevertheless, these ideas have had little effect on mainstream research. While archaeologists of the southern Levant have been able to establish a coherent framework for the later chronological and cultural units, the Pottery Neolithic and Chalco- lithic periods have remained the most obscure phases in the archaeology of the area. The small number of sites excavated, the limited data pub- lished from these excavations and the lack of reliable radiometric datings and information on the cultural variations between contemporary sites situated in different regions make it difficult to draw a clearcut picture of the ways in which material culture and social organization developed during the period. Many different terms have been used to designate the various assemblages related to the Pottery Neolithic and Chalcolithic periods, and the opinions and suggestions put forward are almost as numer- ous as the scholars who have studied the issue (Table 1). Over fifty different designations have been suggested for the various cultural, chronolo- gical or regional stages in different parts of the Levant in the 6th, 5th and the first half of the 4th millennia bee: 1</page><page sequence="19">c A 2 I 1 £ 0) JS a Vi •O 'C Ł O S ? ■B U 1 A S s s z « *© § 'C M .a 'C o 'C Ł a&gt; € ha a VI 2 fiu jc "S S » e 4&gt; -O M H CQ £ Oh I * .Sá â á 'S -C cd £&lt; X&gt; * 5 - PC ^ ,3 Q N b 2 ^ ^ O t' -C S o Id 2_c £ £ ^ O «73 t' -C b o Id 2_c ^ 'C ll- &lt;t3 ^ Os r^±ï b ^ Ä 43 'C Ö ll- £ &gt; &lt;t3 ^ ^3 ^ tìPQ U O c/5 H-» Q &gt; &gt; ČŠ X) = i_i j2 s i_i j2 .2 H d â :§ - -Sá ¡3 &lt;U "q 3 cd .

These terminological inconsistencies create a mis- leading situation, blurring the picture and testifying to poor methodology. 1.2. RESEARCH AIMS AND METHODOLOGY The state of research described above dictates two main aims: 1. The presentation of a coherent typological framework for the description and analysis of pottery products manufactured in the southern Levant from the 6th to the first half of the 4th millennia bee. The main question here is what are the typical pottery groups of the region, and whether there is any justification in seeing each of them as a separate cultural-archaeological unit. A further question is whether the available assemblages represent the entire time span between the beginning of pottery production and the end of the Ghassulian period, or whether there are settlement gaps (Perrot 1969) or gaps in our information (Kirkbride 1971). 4</page><page sequence="22">2. The subdivision of the 6th, 5th and first half of the 4th millennia bee into cultural phases and their classification into the Pottery Neolithic and Chal- colithic periods (periodization). The main question here is what are the chronological relationships between the different pottery groups of the southern Levant: which were earlier, which were later, and which coexisted with others in different regions. A central issue here is whether the 5th millennium bee should be included terminologically in the Pottery Neolithic period or in an early part of the Chalcolithic period. The methodological principles I have followed throughout my work are as follows: 1 . Concentration on key sites. Since the available data vary in quality and quantity, in constructing the typological framework for each pottery group I have chosen to concentrate on assemblages un- earthed at key sites. Other assemblages are then also taken into account. The key sites are Munhata, Sha'ar Hagolan, Jericho, 'Ein el-Jarba, Abu Zureiq, Tel 'Ali and Stratum XVIII at Tel Beth Shean. 2. Careful choice of the units of analysis. In sites of the type discussed in this study, extensive building and digging activities have taken place, resulting in the mixture of sediments and the movement of finds from their original position into other layers. In order to obtain well-defined assemblages I have given much thought to the units of analysis at the level of bucket and locus. From each of the sites, only assemblages from clear archaeological contexts were chosen for typological and quantitative analysis. Neither material collected from surveys and site surfaces nor items of unknown origin are included in this study. 3. Pottery typology. The study has focused on the preparation of a classification and description system for pottery vessels. This was deemed necessary because to date no comprehensive study of the pottery of the 6th and 5th millennia bee has been published. Appended to the description of the vessels are figures which present numerous examples of each of the pottery types discussed in this study. Neolithic and Chalcolithic pottery was manufac- tured at the household level, rather than by skilled and specialized potters. The vessels consequently vary in size, thickness of wall, angle of wall, shape of rim and decoration. The classification system used here conforms with this situation by using flexible definitions of the different types, avoiding the use of a large number of subtypes which would make the typology clumsy and complicated to use. 4. Regional research. One of the reasons for the confusion in research of the 6th-4th millennia bee is the existence of striking cultural differences between the various regions of the southern Levant. In order to overcome this difficulty, it appears to me that one should focus initially on a limited geographical area. When the stages in each region have been well defined, it is possible to attempt a correlation with what is known from other regions. For my doctoral dissertation I chose the central Jordan Valley because it is a relatively small area in which numerous sites of this period have been excavated. In the present study data from the other parts of the southern Levant have been integrated to complete the picture. 5. Field work. Some of the key sites for this period were excavated several decades ago by outdated methods of excavation and documenta- tion. The stratigraphy of these sites is thus often unreliable. In order to obtain clean assemblages in situ, renewed excavations were carried out at Sha'ar Hagolan and Tel 'Ali. The new data which were collected contributed greatly to the conclusions of this study. 6. Quantitative analysis. In addition to the typological analysis, I performed quantitative ana- lyses in order to assess the frequencies of the various phenomena. The quantitative approach enabled a better understanding of the proportions between different elements in each assemblage. 7. Dating techniques. Both relative and absolute chronologies are used in this study. 1.3. SUMMARY The results of the detailed typological analysis of the pottery assemblages and their stratigraphie contexts pointed to the existence of four main cultural- chronological units (periods). The pottery industries are presented in four chapters, each dedicated to one period. In Table 2 the stratigraphy of the main assemblages discussed in this study is presented. Table 3 presents the periodization, chronology and main pottery groups related to each period. The reader should be aware of the following features of the periodization adopted in this work: 1. The Pottery Neolithic period consists of only one phase. Thus, Kenyon's classical division of the Pottery Neolithic period into PNA and PNB has been superseded here.

The Wadi Rabah phase, which includes Kenyon's Pottery Neolithic B Jericho, is defined here as Early Chalcolithic. This terminology was suggested as early as 1935, when the first assem- blage of this ceramic tradition was unearthed in Stratum VIII at Jericho (Garstang et al. 1935). This concept has been accepted by scholars specializing in this period (Kaplan 1958a; Kirkbride 1971). The flint assemblage of PNB Jericho was even defined as "Ghassulian" in the final excavation report (Crow- foot-Payne 1983). When observing the sequence of cultures in the southern Levant I see a gradual change over 5000 years, from the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A to the Ghassulian Chalcolithic. Thus, the definition of the Wadi Rabah culture as Late Neolithic, Early Chalcolithic or Intermediate Neo- lithic/Chalcolithic is largely a question of semantics. However, examination of Wadi Rabah Ware reveals more similarities to the pottery of the subsequent phase than to the pottery of the previous one. The Wadi Rabah phase has conse- quently been defined here as the Early Chalcolithic period. For further discussion of the terminology of the Chalcolithic period see below, Chapter 4, Section 4.1. 3. An additional phase between the Wadi Rabah/ PNB and the classical Ghassul-Beersheba Chalco- lithic is defined here. Up to now, the existence of 6</page><page sequence="24">such a phase has usually been overlooked and it has been integrated into either the Wadi Rabah or the Ghassulian Chalcolithic (see below, Chapter 5, Section 5.1). This phase is designated here Middle Chalcolithic. It is characterized by Beth Shean and Qatifian Wares. 4. The classical Ghassul-Beersheba Chalcolithic assemblage is classified here as Late Chalcolithic, continuing the scheme of the previously defined Early Chalcolithic and Middle Chalcolithic phases. Additional assemblages of this period are Golan and Hulah Wares. 7</page><page sequence="25">CHAPTER TWO THE FIRST STEPS 2.1. THE TYPOLOGICAL BACKGROUND With the beginning of sedentarization in the Near East in the Natufian and Neolithic periods, increasing numbers of containers appear in ancient settlements. Portable containers made of various materials occur in the archaeological record: 1 Stone bowls. Limestone and basalt items have been reported from almost every site. Two characteristics contribute to this fact: on the one hand this raw material is durable, unlike wood and other organic materials, while on the other hand stone containers are rather heavy items which are not easy to transport, and thus when discarded were left behind at the site. Fig. 1 presents some examples of stone vessels from the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B sites of Jericho, Basta and Abu Ghosh. The variety of shapes and sizes, including shallow bowls (Fig. 1 :2, 9), deep bowls with rounded wall (Fig. 1:6), deep bowls with straight wall (Fig. 1:3, 7) and basins (Fig. 1:8), is striking. Some items have lug (Fig. 1:5, 8) or pierced (Fig. 1:3) handles, and some bowls have flat bases (Fig. 1:3-4, 7). The stone vessel industry apparently provided the typo- logical background for the first open-shaped pottery vessels: shallow bowls, deep bowls and basins. 2 Basketry and cordage containers. Evidence for the existence of items made of these raw materials is very rare, since these are perishable materials. However, a few such items have been discovered in the southern part of Israel in areas with a relative dry climate. The earliest example, from the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A site of Gilgal, is dated to the 8th millennium bee. Here an item coated with waterproof material (bitumen?) was reported (Noy 1989: 13). A few other items were discovered at the 7th millennium bee Pre- Pottery Neolithic B site of Nahal Hemar Cave (Bar-Yosef and Alon 1988), some of them also coated with waterproof material (Photo 1). This technique is mentioned in the Old Testament in the description of the ark made by Moses's mother (Exodus 2:3). Coating the basket with bitumen or other components made the item suitable for containing liquids. Photo 1. Nahal Hemar Cave, Pre-Pottery Neolithic B containers made of cordage and coated with bitumen. 3 Wooden bowls. Wood is another perishable material which rarely survives from antiquity. A few wooden items, however, have been discov- ered at early sites: a small oval box from 7th millennium bee Beidha (Fig. 2:1), which con- tained flint blades and arrowheads (Mortensen 1988); various items from 6th millennium be Çatal Hüyük (for photographs see Mellaart 1967: Pis. 105-108; for drawings see Mellaart 1964: Figs. 35-39); and a deep bowl from the early 5th millennium bee underwater site of Kefar Samir (Fig. 2:2). 8</page><page sequence="26">Fig. 1 .

The common term for these items is "White Ware" (or vaisselles blanches ). These containers appear in the 7th millennium bee in many Pre-Pottery Neolithic B sites (Fig. 3). White Ware vessels are quite similar in shape and size to pottery vessels but were made from different raw materials and with different manufacturing techniques. This phenomenon will be discussed in detail below. 5 Unbaked clay items. At a few Pre-Pottery Neolithic B sites of the 7th millennium bee large rounded containers made of unbaked clay were discovered. These are similar to the large pottery pithoi of later periods and probably served as silos (Photo 2). Such items were reported from 'Ain Ghazal (Rollefson et al. 1992: Fig. 13) and Basta (Nissen et al. 1987: Pl. V: 3). It is possible that a similar object from Jericho, identified as a temple model (Garstang et al. 1936: 71), is also such an item. Small and large unbaked clay containers have been re- ported from Çayônû (Özdogan and Ozdoģan 1993: 93). Photo 2.

THE TECHNOLOGICAL BACKGROUND Pottery vessels are containers made of clay, hardened by baking at high temperatures. These entered systematic use for daily activities in north- ern Syria and Anatolia in the early 6th millennium bee and reached the southern Levant some four hundred years later, at around 5600 bee. Pottery vessels provided an excellent solution to the problem of storage. They occur at every site of the ancient Near East and constitute the most common finds in archaeological excavations. Why were pottery vessels found to be the ideal portable containers in the ancient world? From the geological point of view, pottery is an artificial manmade rock. The potter's craft has been de- scribed in detail in various works (see, for example, Amiran 1969, Hebrew version only; Arnold and Bourriau 1993). The production process can be summarized in the following seven stages: 1 The natural raw materials, clay, grits and sometimes straw, are collected. 2 The clay is prepared by mixing the materials with water and kneading them together. This is a long process which may take several weeks or even months. 3 The vessel is shaped by hand or on a wheel. In the earlier periods with which this book deals the potter's wheel had not yet been introduced. Only in the Late Chalcolithic period were some small open-shaped vessels manufactured on a wheel. 4 The pot is left to dry until it is leather-hard. 5 The potter adds handles and shapes the base of the vessel at the leather-hard stage. 6 Still at the leather-hard stage, the vessel is decorated. Here four main techniques can be discerned: a Painting: the use of color for painting a pattern or to cover the entire surface of the vessel (slip), b Burnishing: burnishing the vessel's surface, usually after painting, gives a high-quality shine to the item, c Surface manipulation: this includes incisions, combing, impressions and puncturing, d Plastic decoration: applying clay to the original surface in a figurative shape (human, snake) or a simple band. 7 The vessel is fired at a temperature of several hundred degrees centigrade. The soft clay hardens, producing a pot that is ready to be used. This is an irreversible process: the pottery cannot revert to unfired clay. The fired vessel, even when broken, remains on the archaeologi- cal site and constitutes the most abundant find during excavations. The manufacture of pottery vessels integrates two main technological aspects: clay modelling and firing at high temperature (pyro technology): 1 Clay modelling. Evidence of the extensive use of clay in architecture or in the production of small portable objects appears in the ancient Near East as early as the 8th millennium bee, in the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A period. Mudbricks, dried in the sun, were used for building purposes at sites like Jericho (Kenyon 1981: PL 44a) and Gesher (Garfinkel 1990a; 1990b). At the same sites small baked clay items, such as a necklace of 14 beads from Gesher (Photo 3), have been unearthed. The Pre-Pottery Neolithic B gave rise to an increased production of small baked clay objects. At the site of Munhata, for example, a rich collection of anthropomorphic figurines, zoomorphic figurines and geometric items was unearthed (Garfinkel 1995). At the sites of 'Ain Ghazal (Rollefson et al. 1992: Fig. 13) and Basta (Nissen et al. 1987: PL V:3) large rounded containers made of unbaked clay were discovered. In a few cases, small baked clay containers have been reported as well: from Beidha (Kirkbride 1966: Fig. 4:4) and Ganj Dareh (Smith and Crepeau 1983). Photo 3. Gesher, Pre-Pottery Neolithic A baked clay beads. 11</page><page sequence="29">2 Pyrotechnology. This term refers to manufac- turing processes that require high temperatures for the production of goods. In the ancient Near East pyrotechnology was applied to the manu- facture of four main materials: from early to late, plaster, pottery, metals and glass. As early as 12,000 be, plaster manufactured from lime- stone at a temperature of 850° C was used as an adhesive material. It was smeared on flint items, probably for attaching them to wooden handles (Kingery et al. 1988: 226). In the Natufian village of Mallaha, plaster was used for architectural purposes in the 10th and 9th millennia bee (Kingery et al. 1988: 226). In the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B the production and use of plaster reached a peak which was not exceeded in any other period and included: a Building materials. Lime plaster was used as the basic building material for the production of floors and for plastering mudbrick walls. Almost every dwelling unit exposed in this period in the Mediterranean zone of the southern Levant was equipped with a plaster floor and plastered walls, ranging from several hundred kilograms to several tons of lime products in each household (Photo 4). In the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B village of Yif- tahel, for example, the weight of the plaster floor in one structure was about 7 tons (Garfinkel 1987a; 1987b). About 30% of this weight (2 tons) is burnt lime, and the rest is crust lime with various inclusions (Malinow- ski and Garfinkel 1990; Goren and Goldberg 1991). Such large quantities testify to indus- trial manufacture of lime in this period. Photo 4. Yiftahel, Pre-Pottery Neolithic B plastered floor. b Portable containers. In the Pre-Pottery Neo- lithic B various containers made of plaster appeared for the first time. Because of their light color these vessels have been named "White Ware." These containers predate the earliest pottery vessels, c Cul tic items. Burnt lime products were used for producing plastered skulls, anthropo- morphic statues, figurines and geometric items (Rollefson 1990). The manufacturing process of lime includes five main stages: 1 Collecting the raw material, natural limestone (CaC03). 2 Firing: the limestone is placed in a fire at a temperature of at least 850° C. C02 is released into the atmosphere and the limestone becomes quicklime (CaO). 3 Mixing with water (slaking): water is added to the quicklime and a soft paste of slaked lime [Ca(OH)2] is produced. 4 Modelling: the slaked lime paste is mixed with other materials and water, and then modelled according to the desired shape of the final product. 5 Drying: in the final stage C02 is absorbed from the atmosphere and water is released and evaporates. The modelled item hardens and the final product is ready. In the lime industry pyrotechnology is used at the beginning of the production process, and the raw material emerges from the kiln. This raw material, together with other materials, is molded to the shape of the final product. In the pottery industry the process is reversed and pyrotechnology is used at the end of the production process: first the raw materials are mixed and molded to the shape of the final product, and then the finished product emerges from the kiln. 2.3. WHITE WARE VESSELS Portable containers made of lime have been discovered at various sites of the 7th-6th millennia bee: 1 The 7th millennium bee. White Ware vessels of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B from the site of 'Ain Ghazal have been described in detail (Kafafi 1986; Rollefson 1990). Fig. 3 presents some examples from this site. In the first seasons at 'Ain Ghazal 48 White Ware items were dis- 12</page><page sequence="30">Fig. 3. White Ware vessels from Pre-Pottery Neolithic 'Ain Ghazal (Rollefson 1990: Figs. 8-9). Scale 1:5. covered, 34 from the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B, seven from the next chronological phase, the Pre-Pottery Neolithic C, and five from the next phase, the Pottery Neolithic period (Rollefson 1990: 36). The variety of shapes is limited, displaying only a few types of open vessels: deep bowls (Fig. 3:8), shallow bowls (Fig. 3:2-3) and basins (Fig. 3:4-5). 2 The first half of the 6th millennium bee. In the northern Levant White Ware vessels were discovered at various sites: Stratum II at Tell Ramad (de Contenson and Van Liere 1966: PL 2b), Labwe (Kirkbride 1969: Figs. 1-3), Neba' Fa'ur (Copeland 1969: Fig. 2b) and Stratum Va at Ugarit (de Contenson 1992: Fig. 164). The largest collection of vessels, both in number of items and variety of shapes, has been reported from Tell el-Kowm in Syria (Dornemann 1986; Marechal 1982). A detailed typological discus- sion appears in Dornemann's report. It is interesting to see that at this stage closed vessels were also manufactured in White Ware techni- que. Fig. 4 presents some examples from Tell el- Kowm. In the southern Levant this period is the Pre-Pottery Neolithic C: White Ware vessels were reported from 'Ain Ghazal (Rollefson 1990: 36), Stratum II at Tel 'Ali (Garfinkel 1992b), and probably at the base of Tel Dan (Gopher and Greenberg 1987: Fig. 5:10). 3 The second half of the 6th millennium bee. This is the Pottery Neolithic period in the southern Levant. At this stage White Ware vessels were manufactured alongside regular pottery; how- ever, while pottery is found on every site and in large quantities, only very small quantities of White Ware vessels have been found. A few items were reported from Sha'ar Hagolan (Garfinkel 1992b: 123), 'Ain Ghazal (Kafafi 1990: Fig. 7:11; Rollefson 1990) and "néolithi- que ancien" Byblos (Dunand 1973: 41, Fig. 14). Open shapes (bowls and basins) are found. From a typological point of view, it should be emphasized that one of the most common vessel types in the White Ware assemblage is the chalice, a bowl on a high pedestal. This shape has a wide distribution, and Fig. 5 presents examples from the following sites: Byblos, Labwe, Tell Ramad, Tel Dan, Ugarit and Neba' Fa'ur. 13</page><page sequence="31">Fig. 4.

Since the Yarmukian group has been investigated in more detail than the other two groups it is better known, and will serve as a point of departure. In order to emphasize the great similarity between Yarmukian and Jericho IX Wares, cross-references have been given between equivalent types of the two assemblages. From the technological point of view the following features characterize all three groups: 1 All of the pottery is handmade rather than wheelmade. The use of coils can sometimes be discerned in the sections of sherds. 2 Fine vessels with a smooth surface and elabo- rate decoration appear side by side with undecorated coarse vessels that have thick walls and rough surfaces. 3 The surface has sometimes been wiped and smoothed by the use of grass or straw, which has left its imprint in the pottery. 4 Some bases bear mat impressions. The mats are rounded and the vessels stood in their centers, indicating that potters used mats as working surfaces. 5 Pétrographie studies at Munhata (Goren 1992) and Nahal Qanah Cave (Goren 1996) have showed that the vessels were made of local clay derived from the immediate vicinity of the sites. 6 Potters preferred highly carbonatic clays which gave vessels a light color. This is a clear continuation of the plaster pyrotechnology tradition of the 7th and early 6th millennia bee (Goren 1992). 3.1. YARMUKIAN WARE (Photo 5) The first Yarmukian sherd was discovered in Jericho at the beginning of the 20th century (Sellin and Watzinger 1913: Pl. 21:F3). In the 1930s a variety of Yarmukian items were unearthed at the base of Tel Megiddo (Loud 1948: Pis. 1-3; Garfinkel 1993a: 118, Fig. 2), but these were not recognized as representing an independent Pottery Neolithic culture. In the publications, the relevant finds were described together with other objects as Chalco- lithic. The Yarmukian culture was first distin- guished in the late 1940s by Stekelis at the site of Sha'ar Hagolan in the central Jordan Valley. He recognized the unique character of the flint indus- try, pottery and art objects, and named the culture after the nearby River Yarmuk (Stekelis 1951). In his preliminary publications on Sha'ar Hagolan, Stekelis pointed out the most characteristic aspects of this material culture: 1 Pottery decorated with incised herring-bone pattern. 2 Sickleblades with coarse denticulation. 3 A rich assemblage of art objects, which includes large numbers of schematic anthropomorphic pebble figurines. The incised herring-bone pattern is considered the most characteristic feature {fossile directeur) for recognizing Yarmukian Ware. Altogether Yarmukian assemblages have been discovered over the years at some twenty different sites (Fig. 6). Some of the publications from these sites present a detailed account of the pottery industry, while others mention its existence only briefly. The following list reviews the pottery publications from each site: Munhata (central Jordan Valley). The site was first surveyed and tested by Tsori (1958). A Yarmukian settlement (Stratum 2b) was subse- quently exposed over some 2050 sq m by Perrot (1964; 1966; 1968; 1993). It was discovered above a Pre-Pottery Neolithic settlement (Strata 6-3) and below a Wadi Rabah settlement (Stratum 2a). The excavation at Munhata produced the largest known collection of Yarmukian pottery, which was pub- lished by the author (Garfinkel 1992a). In his 16</page><page sequence="34">Fig. 6.

Munhata, Yarmukian Ware, various vessels. preliminary report, Perrot suggested a subdivision within the Yarmukian sequence into the Sha'ar Hagolan phase and the Munhata-Ghrubba phase (Perrot 1968). However, further analysis of the pottery has demonstrated the homogeneity of the material throughout Stratum 2b. Sha'ar Hagolan (central Jordan Valley). This, the largest known Yarmukian settlement, has been excavated twice: first in 1949-52 by Stekelis and recently by the author. Stekelis' final report (1972) concentrated mainly on the flint tools and the art objects, and the pottery was mentioned only very briefly. The pottery unearthed during the first two seasons of the new excavations was analyzed in the author's doctoral dissertation (Garfinkel 1992b). Abu Thaw wab (Jordanian plateau). A Yarmukian settlement has been exposed over an area of some 750 sq m (Kafafi 1988; Obeidat 1995: 4-7). The pottery has been recently published in a final detailed monograph (Obeidat 1995). 6 Ain Ghazal (Jordanian plateau). The settlement sequence includes three successive phases: Pre- Pottery Neolithic B, Pre-Pottery Neolithic C and Yarmukian. Samples of Yarmukian pottery have been published in each preliminary report (see, for example, Rollefson and Simmons 1986; Rollefson et al. 1992). A detailed study of the pottery unearthed in the 1985 season is available (Kafafi 1990). 6 Ain Rahub (Jordanian plateau). Limited excava- tions were carried out at this site (Muheisen et al. 1988) and a small collection of sherds was published in detail (Kafafi 1989). Nahal Qanah Cave (Samaria hills). Yarmukian remains were collected in this karstie cave lacking stratigraphie context. Well-preserved pottery ves- sels, some with complete profiles, were reported (Gopher and Tsuk 1996). Megiddo (Jezreel Valley). A Yarmukian settle- ment was discovered at the base of Tel Megiddo in Area BB. Some pottery sherds are presented in the 18</page><page sequence="36">final report, mixed with later material, and were designated Chalcolithic (Loud 1948: Pis. 1-3). I was kindly permitted to see this material in the store- rooms of the Rockefeller Museum in Jerusalem. Wadi Murabba'at Cave (Judean Desert). In the early 1950s a few pottery sherds with typical Yarmukian shapes and decorations were discovered in a cave in Wadi Murabba'at. This material was not found in a stratigraphie context, but was mixed with later pottery of the Ghassulian Chalcolithic. I examined this material too in the storerooms of the Rockefeller Museum. Hazorea (Jezreel Valley). A few sherds with the typical incised herring-bone decoration of Yarmu- kian Ware were reported from this site (Anati 1971; Anati et al. 1973: Pl. XVIII:4a-b). The pottery assemblage of the so-called "Hazorea Culture" (Anati et al. 1973: Fig. 58), though published separately from the decorated sherds, is typically Yarmukian in form. Tell el-Far'ah North (Samaria hills). At the base of the site a typical Yarmukian jar fragment was reported (de Vaux and Steve 1947: Fig. 1:34). Some typical denticulated sickleblades were also discov- ered, testifying to Yarmukian activity on the site. Habashan Street (coastal plain). This site is located in the center of Tel Aviv. Three seasons of excavations were conducted between 1950 and 1952. Three occupation strata were unearthed: I, Early Bronze Age; II, Wadi Rabah; and III, Yarmukian (Kaplan and Ritter-Kaplan 1993). Some data on the Yarmukian pottery were presented in Kaplan's doctoral dissertation (1954b). I was kindly per- mitted to examine this material in the storerooms of the Israel Antiquities Authority in Jerusalem. Pella (central Jordan Valley). Some typical Yarmukian pottery sherds (without herring-bone incised items) and stone artifacts, designated "late Neolithic," were reported from this site (McNicoll et al. 1982: 17-34, Pl. 103; 1992: Pl. 12; Bourke 1997: 97-98). Horvat 'Uza (coastal plain). Typical Yarmukian pottery was discovered in Stratum 20 (Getzov 1995). The assemblage is unpublished, but I was kindly permitted to see the material in the store- rooms of the Israel Antiquities Authority in Akko. Nahal Zehora II (Carmel hills). Yarmukian as well as Jericho IX Wares were reported from the base of this site (Gopher 1993). Some aspects of the assemblage, without a typological analysis, were presented in an MA dissertation (Orrelle 1993). Tel Qishion (Lower Galilee). Classical Yarmu- kian pottery was collected on the surface of this site (Arnon and Amiran 1981: PI. 37). I saw this material at the local museum at Kibbutz 'En Dor. Hamadiya (central Jordan Valley). One excava- tion season was carried out here by Kaplan at this single-stratum site; the report mentions pits, ovens and fireplaces, but no building remains (Kaplan 1993a). Typical pottery, flint and art objects are briefly mentioned, but no detailed report has been published. I saw this material in the storerooms of the Israel Antiquities Authority in Jerusalem. Wadi Shu'eib (Jordanian plateau). A test pit conducted at this site produced Neolithic pottery; its identification as Yarmukian or Jericho IX is uncertain because of the limited published sample (Simmons et al. 1989). Byblos (Lebanese coast). In the excavations three Neolithic stages were defined: "néolithique ancien," "néolithique moyen" and "néolithique récent" (Dunand 1973). The "néolithique ancien" stage at this site produced typical Yarmukian pottery, together with flint and art artifacts. The Typological Framework for Yarmukian Ware To date systematic typological frameworks within which Yarmukian pottery may be described and analyzed have been established for Munhata (Garfinkel 1992a), Sha'ar Hagolan (Garfinkel 1992b) and Abu Thawwab (Obeidat 1995). Here, the typology that I formulated during my work on Munhata and Sha'ar Hagolan will be followed. The ceramic assemblage of Munhata was especially suitable for this purpose, because of the following factors: 1 The pottery comes from a stratigraphie excava- tion. 2 The assemblage consists of 15,890 sherds, making it the largest Yarmukian assemblage excavated. 3 A large part of the site (2050 sq m) was excavated, reflecting varied activity areas of the settlement. 4 Many conjoinable sherds enabled the restora- tion of complete vessels. 5 Non-diagnostic body sherds were counted and recorded; thus quantitative data relating to the entire assemblage are available. The typological framework of the Yarmukian pottery is based on two principles: 19</page><page sequence="37">1 The basic shape of the vessel: open or closed. 2 The size of the vessel: diameter smaller than 10 cm, 10-20 cm, and larger than 20 cm. The diameter was chosen as a criterion of size since it can be established even in the case of very small sherds, while the height can be established only when the complete profile has been preserved. Thus, six main classes of vessels were identified: A Small open vessels. B Small closed vessels. C Medium-sized open vessels. D Medium-sized closed vessels. E Large open vessels. F Large closed vessels. The vessels within each typological class were subdivided according to their specific shape and decoration, forming altogether 20 different types (Fig. 7). Each specific type was given a number within its class. After completion of the typological analysis and definition of the various types, the entire assemblage was reviewed and the number of items of each type in each locus were counted. It should be mentioned that pottery statistics are a very difficult methodo- logical task (see, for example, David 1972; Egloff 1973). Since the Pottery Neolithic assemblages consist mainly of broken sherds and restorable vessels are rare, the following principles were applied: 1 The statistics included only rims. 2 In general only sherds over 4 cm long were counted, since very small rim fragments are not indicative of the exact vessel type they represent. 3 In the case of small and miniature vessels, all diagnostic rim fragments were counted. Elsewhere I have presented the detailed frequencies of the various pottery types in each excavated locus at the sites of Munhata (Garfinkel 1992a: Tables 12- 15) and Sha'ar Hagolan (Garfinkel 1992b: Table 59). Here these data are combined into larger units (Table 4). Table 4. Yarmukian Ware: frequencies at Munhata (by major excavation areas) and Sha'ar Hagolan (1989-90 excavations).

Small bowl or cup (Munhata 2%; Sha'ar Hagolan 1.5%). This type includes all the bowls or cups smaller than 10 cm in diameter. There is great variability here, including the following features: a Vessels that are so small that they can be described as miniatures (Fig. 8:1-5; Photo 6). b Small shallow bowls (Figs. 8:6-7, 9-12; Photos 7-8). c Small cups (Fig. 8:13-16). d Small cups with miniature pierced handles at the rim (Fig. 8:17). Only one such vessel was found at Munhata, but a similar cup is reported from the Jericho IX site of Ghrubba (below, Fig. 43:18). e Hemispherical (globular) bowls (Fig. 8:18-20). Small bowls or cups, decorated and undecorated, from Munhata, Abu Thawwab, Sha'ar Hagolan, Megiddo and 'Ain Ghazal are presented in Fig. 8 and Photos 6-8.

Spoon (Munhata 0.4%; Sha'ar Hagolan 0%). Spoon-shaped clay vessels make up this category. Such items were discovered at Munhata in the excavations conducted by Tsori (Fig. 10:1; Photo 11) and Perrot (Fig. 10:2-3). Spoons have been reported from the Jericho IX sites of Jericho and Ghrubba (Fig. 10:4-7). Spoons made of various other raw materials, such as bone (Fig. 10:8), wood (Fig. 10:9) and stone (Fig. 10:10), have been reported from 6th millennium bee sites in the Near East. Photo 11. Munhata (Tsori excavations), Yarmukian Ware, spoon (Fig. 10:1). CI. Deep decorated bowl (Munhata 14.6%; Sha'ar Hagolan 12.5%). This type is one of the most common in Yarmukian assemblages. The following characteristics define the type: a The bowl is relatively deep, the height of the vessel being equal to its diameter, b The walls of the bowl are only slightly curved or are upright, c The base is flat or disk-shaped, d A small loop handle, or sometimes a pierced handle, is found close to the rim of the bowl. The handle is vertical in most cases and only occasionally horizontal. The bowls appear to have had only one handle, e The rim is simple, rounded or pointed, f These vessels are usually carefully constructed; they are relatively thin and the surface has been smoothed. These bowls can be further subdivided according to the three techniques used to decorate them: incision, slip and painting (Fig. 11). Some bowls are decorated by one of these techniques, others by two or even all three of them. The inside of the bowl is sometimes decorated in a different technique from the outside. We therefore view all three decoration groups at Munhata as being contemporaneous rather than serving as chronological indicators. Almost every bowl is decorated somewhat differ- ently. Our classification stresses the external dec- oration, as it is more conspicuous than the internal. By the external decoration, then, each bowl is classified into one of the three main decoration groups: incision (50.9%), slip (28.5%) and painting (20.6%). These three groups are further subdivided according to the internal decoration. The final result is ten subgroups by which all the deep decorated bowls are classified (Table 5). Table 5.

The pattern is often accompanied by red painted lines parallel to the incisions or by red slip on the remainder of the bowl face. The following five subgroups are identified (Fig. 11): 1 Bowls with incised external face and under- rated internal face. 2 Bowls with incised external face and internal face decorated by a red painted line along the rim. 3 Bowls with incised external face and red slip on all or most of the internal face. 4 Bowls with incised external face and internal face decorated by red painted spots. 5 Bowls with incised external face and internal face decorated by red painted lines. Bowls with external incised decoration are the most common in Yarmukian sites, and Fig. 12 and Photo 12 present examples from Munhata, Nahal Qanah Cave, 'Ain Ghazal and Abu Thawwab.

Bowls externally decorated with red slip This group includes bowls whose external face is covered with red slip. This group is usually less carefully constructed than the incised bowls. It can be subdivided into three subgroups (Fig. 11; the numbering of the subgroups continues throughout): 6 Bowls with red slip (or a red painted line near rim) on external face and undecorated internal face. 7 Bowls with red slip on external face and internal face decorated with a red painted line near rim or red painted spots. 8 Bowls with red slip on external and internal faces. Fig. 13:1-3 presents bowls from Munhata, Sha'ar Hagolan and Abu Thawwab whose external face is covered with red slip. Similar vessels from Jericho IX sites are illustrated below (Fig. 45:1-3). C. Bowls externally decorated with paint This group includes bowls which are decorated on their external face by different types of red painted lines. The most common pattern is parallel zigzag lines. This decoration is most reminiscent of the Jericho IX vessels, although at Munhata the painted bowls are not burnished. According to the character of the painting, two subgroups are identified (Fig. 11; the numbering of the subgroups continues throughout): 9 Thin delicate lines, 2-3 mm wide. 10 Wide lines, up to 1 cm or more in width. Photo 13. Munhata, Yarmukian Ware, deep bowl decorated with painted pattern (Fig. 13:10). Bowls from Abu Thawwab, Munhata, Sha'ar Hagolan, Megiddo and Nahal Qanah Cave that are decorated on their external face by red paint are shown in Fig. 13:4-12 and Photo 13. Such bowls have also been reported from Jericho IX sites (below, Fig. 45:4-12). C2. Deep undecorated bowl (Munhata 8.1%; Sha'ar Hagolan 10.3%). The deep bowls that make up this category are quite similar to the decorated type described above but differ in the following features: a They are coarsely constructed with relatively thick walls and a rough surface, sometimes smoothed with grass, b They are flatter in their proportions, c One item from Sha'ar Hagolan has a rounded opening in the wall (Fig. 14:7). No bowl with two handles was discovered; it is therefore inferred that recovered bowl fragments without handles are in fact remains of bowls with one handle. Fig. 14:1-7 and Photo 14 show examples from Munhata, Sha'ar Hagolan, Megiddo and 'Ain Ghazal. For similar vessels from Jericho IX sites, see below (Fig. 47:1-6). Photo 14. Munhata, Yarmukian Ware, deep undecorated bowl (Fig. 14:1). C3. Bowl with large handle (mug) (Munhata 1.3%; Sha'ar Hagolan 0%). This is a rare type with the following characteristics: a The bowls are medium-sized, b One large vertical loop handle extends from the rim almost all the way down to the base, c The items have thick, coarse sides, usually without decoration, d When a substantial part has been preserved, it indicates that the vessel was oval rather than circular in plan (Fig. 14:8, 10). 29</page><page sequence="47">Fig. 13.

Large chalices form a type which exhibits the following characteristics: a The bowl at the top of the chalice is flat, b The base of the chalice is high and hollow, with an even diameter throughout its height or widening somewhat at the bottom, c One handle extends to the middle of the base, as indicated by the complete large chalice from Megiddo (Fig. 9:6; Photo 16) and small chalices (Fig. 9:1-3). d The diameter of most chalices does not exceed 20 cm and they have consequently been included here in the medium-sized vessels. However, larger items have sometimes been reported. Photo 16. Megiddo, Yarmukian Ware, large chalice (Fig. 9:6). From the point of view of decoration, the chalices can be divided into three groups: 1 Undecorated chalices. The undecorated chalices have a coarse surface and represent a simple version of the decorated chalices (Fig. 9:9). No decoration was observed on 41.7% of the chalice fragments at Munhata. 2 Red-slip chalices (Fig. 9:6-7, 10). The slip covers the entire vessel or those parts visible to the eye: the internal face of the bowl and the external face of the base. This decoration was observed on 33.3% of the chalice fragments at Munhata. 3 Painted chalices. This is a well-defined group of decorated items, carefully constructed (Fig. 9:8, 11): the faces are well smoothed and painted with thin, delicate, red lines in a zigzag pattern. The decoration is found on the external and internal faces of the bowl and on the base. This decoration is unique to the chalices; at Munhata it was observed on 25% of the chalice frag- ments. Large chalices from the Yarmukian sites of Megid- do, Munhata, Abu Thawwab and 'Ain Ghazal are shown in Fig. 9:6-11 and Photo 16. Fig. 44:5-9 below presents large chalices from Jericho IX sites. C5. Various bowls (Munhata 0.6%; Sha'ar Hagolan 0.4%). This type includes all the medium-sized bowls which were not included in the previous categories. Two clear categories were found here: a Shallow bowls with flat or rounded base. Fig. 15 and Photo 17 present items from Munhata, Pella, 'Ain Ghazal, 'Ain Rahub, Abu Thawwab and Sha'ar Hagolan.

The pots closely resemble holemouth jars (type Fl); the only difference is in the walls, which are upright in pots and incline inward in holemouth jars.

Similar pots have been reported from Jericho IX sites (below, Fig. 50). E2. Large bowl (Munhata 0.8%; Sha'ar Hagolan 1.5%). This type of vessel is rare and only a small number of sherds was recovered. The large bowls are characterized by the following features: a The walls slope inward and the rim somewhat outward (this profile may be described as "S- shaped"). b The diameter of the opening is smaller than the vessel's largest diameter, c In all cases where handles were found on the sherds, they were horizontal, d Although no complete vessels were recovered and the ratio between diameter and height cannot be determined with certainty, it is nevertheless clear that the vessels were deep rather than shallow, e The large bowls are usually decorated, most with red slip or incised herring-bone pattern.

Sha'ar Hagolan, Yarmukian Ware, basin (Fig. 19:5). E3. Basin (Munhata 4.8%; Sha'ar Hagolan 1.5%). This type consists of very coarse vessels with the following features: a The vessels have a large diameter; though all are broken and their exact size cannot be deter- mined, their diameter appears to have been 40- 60 cm. A few items have a smaller diameter (Fig. 19:2-3). b The basins were probably oval in plan, as can clearly be seen from one item from Abu Thawwab (Fig. 19:1). c The vessels are very shallow; their height usually does not exceed 6-8 cm. d The walls of the basin are upright or curve somewhat outward, e The walls are very thick and may reach 3-4 cm; the walls are thicker at the base and thinner toward the rim. f The rim is rounded or pointed, depending on how narrow it becomes, g The internal face is smoothed, while the external face usually remains coarse, h Some of the items have a particularly thick base in comparison to their walls. The purpose of this thick base is to secure the joints between it and the walls, i The basins have a flat base, sometimes slightly convex, with a raised center in relation to the perimeter. One item from Nahal Qanah Cave has a ring base (Fig. 19:2). j The clay of these vessels is rich in organic material, as evidenced by the many straw impressions. k The firing of the vessels is particularly poor and the core of the pottery is black. The basin is a common vessel at Pottery Neolithic sites; Fig. 19 and Photo 19 present some examples from Abu Thawwab, Nahal Qanah Cave, Munhata, Sha'ar Hagolan and 'Ain Ghazal. Basins of this type also appear at Jericho IX sites (below, Fig. 51). E4. Pithos (Munhata 13.5%; Sha'ar Hagolan 12.9%). This type includes particularly large open or slightly closed storage vessels. In the reports on Pottery Neolithic and Chalcolithic sites, these vessels are given several designations: pithoi (Ka- plan 1958a: Fig. 5:1-3), holemouth jars (Prausnitz 1970a), heavy bowls (Kenyon and Holland 1982: Fig. 26), jars (Epstein 1984: Fig. 2:5-9) and kraters (Gophna and Sadeh 1989: Fig. 10:11). In size and volume, these vessels are ten or even twenty times larger than any other pottery type of the Neolithic assemblage, making them a unique type. The designation "pithos" is used here in order to stress their exceptional size. Pithoi were made in a variety of shapes and sizes. Morphologically, they can be divided into two main types: holemouth pithoi and open pithoi. Not all the pithos sherds are sharply divided between hole- mouth pithoi and open pithoi; intermediate shapes between the two also exist. For statistical purposes, therefore, all the pithoi have been included in one category of considerable variability. Photo 20.

Holemouth pithos. One complete vessel of this type was recovered at Munhata (Fig. 21:1; Photo 20). Its diameter is 70 cm, its height 80 cm and its volume has been calculated as 270 liters. Holemouth pithoi have the following features: a The vessel has a particularly small base and thus its lower part is exceptionally narrow, b The walls of the vessel are thick, sometimes reaching as much as 2 cm. c The walls of the vessel converge inward toward its upper extremity, creating a holemouth shape, d Near the rim, in some cases touching it and in others protruding above it, is a row of lug handles. The lugs are 1-2 cm high and appear at uniform intervals along the perimeter of the vessel (Photo 21). On some vessels the intervals are only 3-4 cm, while on others they are as large as 12-13 cm. The lugs are small in comparison with the size of the vessel and do not appear to have served as handles for carrying the pithos from one place to another. They may have been used for tying the pithos during its production to strengthen it, as has been suggested with regard to the "rope decoration" of the Chalcolithic jars (Amiran 1969: 25). Alternatively, they were perhaps used to secure a lid to prevent the penetration of insects or the evaporation of the vessels's contents. The lugs may also have been solely decorative. e The rim of the pithos is constructed with great care in comparison with the other Yarmukian vessels. At least eight different rim types can be determined. In some of them the rim widens in a variety of ways (Fig. 20): Photo 21. Munhata, Yarmukian Ware, rim of holemouth pithos with lug handles. 1 The rim widens evenly inward and outward. 2 The rim widens inward. 3 The rim widens outward. 4 The rim widens in the shape of a mush- room. In other cases the sides of the vessel remain even and the rim does not widen at the edge (the numbering continues throughout): 5 Pointed or rounded rim. 6 Square rim. 7 Diagonal rim. 8 Outcurved rim. f The surface of the vessel in general is not carefully finished, remaining rough and uneven. From the complete vessel, it is evident that not all parts of the surface were treated consistently. The internal face is smoother than the external face and the external area close to the rim is smoother than that close to the base. Fig. 20.

This is evident from the fact that no black core can be seen in the pottery, as opposed to the basins described above. The pithos testifies to the technical ability of the potter at both the construction and the firing stages, h The holemouth pithoi can be divided into two groups by volume: large and medium-sized. As most of the remains are fragmentary, the differences in height or diameter between vessels cannot be determined with any certainty. Holemouth pithoi from the Yarmukian sites of Munhata, Abu Thawwab and Sha'ar Hagolan are illustrated in Figs. 21-22. For similar vessels from Jericho IX sites, see below (Fig. 52). E4b. Open pithos. This type includes large open vessels with the following features: a The walls are more or less straight, at least at the top of the vessel. No complete vessel of this type has been found, and the shape of the lower body is unclear. As no pithos base with a diameter exceeding 30 cm has been found, it may be safely assumed that the lower part of the vessel narrows sharply, as in the holemouth pithos described above, b The walls are thick. c The diameters of the relevant recovered sherds are smaller than those of the holemouth pithoi and seem not to exceed 50 cm. d The vessel has lug handles close to the rim. e Some of the vessels are covered with red slip or incised with a herring-bone decoration close to the rim. Decoration with incisions other than herring-bone pattern also occurs. Pithoi, or large open vessels with straight walls, from the Yarmukian sites of Munhata, Hamadiya, 'Ain Ghazal, Abu Thawwab, Megiddo and Sha'ar Hagolan are shown in Fig. 23. Similar items were found at Jericho IX sites (below, Fig. 53). Closed Vessels Bl. Miniature jar (Munhata 0.8%; Sha'ar Hagolan 0.4%). These are especially small closed vessels with a diameter of 5-7 cm. The main typological characteristics are flat base, rounded body, neck and two handles extending from the neck to the shoulder. The items are decorated with incised herring-bone or red paint. This shape is a miniature version of the vessel type designated below "Sha'ar Hagolan jar" (type Dl). In view of the size of the items, the term "juglet" might perhaps be more accurate; but the items of this type have two handles, while "juglet" is used for items with one handle. Perhaps the term "jarlet" once suggested by Ruth Amiran would be suitable. Such items have been reported from Munhata and Sha'ar Hagolan (Fig. 24:1-9). B2. Small jar (Munhata 0.6%; Sha'ar Hagolan 1.9%). These are items whose diameter is 8-10 cm and whose shape is similar to the vessel type designated below "Sha'ar Hagolan jar" (type Dl). They are usually decorated with incisions and red paint, though some items are undecorated. Such items have been reported from Munhata, Sha'ar Hagolan and 'Ain Ghazal (Fig. 24:10-14; Photo 22).

Beneath it, zigzag-shaped lines encircle the body. This decoration appears in several variations, usually combining herring-bone in- cisions and paint. On one jar from Sha'ar Ha- golan (Fig. 26:4) the painted area is burnished, g The neck above the handles is decorated in a great variety of combinations of paint and incision. Almost every vessel is somewhat different, indicating that they were individually produced. At least 12 different variations can be defined (Fig. 25): 1 Undecorated. 2 Red paint covering the entire exterior of the neck. 3 A painted red line above the handles. 4 Red paint covering the entire exterior of the neck and a red line on the internal rim. 5 Diagonal incised herring-bone lines des- cending from the rim to the base of the neck. 6 Vertical painted lines descending from below the rim to the base of the neck. 7 An incised horizontal line encircling the rim with a zigzag pattern encircling the neck beneath it. 8 Incised zigzag pattern encircling the neck. 9 Red paint on most of the neck with one unpainted horizontal line encircling the neck close to the rim. 10 As no. 9, but the horizontal line is framed by incisions. 11 As no. 9 but with two incised and light- colored lines. 12 A horizontal line incised with herring-bone decoration encircling the rim. This vessel is a very typical element {fossile directeur) of Yarmukian assemblages and has therefore been named the "Sha'ar Hagolan jar."

Jericho IX jar (Munhata 2.1%; Sha'ar Hagolan 3.0%). This type includes medium-sized jars with the following characteristics: a The low neck is either straight or widens outward. b A pair of loop handles extends from the rim or the middle of the neck to the shoulders. The handles are thick, wide and elliptical in section, c Two variants are observed with regard to the shoulder: relatively flat and relatively sloping, d The body is rounded, e The base is flat. f With regard to decoration, this type can be subdivided into four categories (Fig. 29): 1 Undecorated (Fig. 27:7-13), the most com- mon variant of the Jericho IX jar at Yarmukian sites. 2 Paint in lines or other patterns (Figs. 27: 1-6). 3 Red slip. 4 Incised herring-bone pattern (Fig. 28); this type of decoration is very rare. I have chosen to designate this type the Jericho IX jar since it is extremely common in the phase designated Pottery Neolithic A at Jericho.

For similar items from Jericho IX sites, see below (Figs. 55-56). Photo 26. Munhata, Yarmukian Ware, Jericho IX jar (Fig. 27:3). D3. Byblos jar. In the Munhata report, this rare vessel was not classified as an independent type but was included in the Varia category (Garfinkel 1992a: 51). Consequently, it does not appear in Photo 27. Nahal Qanah Cave, Yarmukian Ware, Byblos jars (Fig. 30:2-3). the typological chart in Fig. 7. However, the few complete items from Nahal Qanah Cave indicate that it does constitute an independent typological category. Since the first known items of this type were reported from Byblos (Fig. 30:8-9), I have designated it the "Byblos jar," on analogy with type D1 ("Sha'ar Hagolan jar") and type D2 ("Jericho IX jar"). This type comprises medium-sized jars with the following characteristics: a Two horizontal handles, usually pierced lug handles, are located at the conjunction of the neck and shoulder of the vessel. Horizontal loop handles have been discovered as well (Fig. 30:4-5). b Two neck forms have been reported: high cylindrical (Fig. 30:2-5) and low everted (Fig. 30:7-9). c A ridge sometimes encircles the base of the neck (Fig. 30:1-4). d The body is rounded e The vessels have high or low ring bases, f Some items are decorated with painted red lines (Fig. 30:2, 6) or red slip (Fig. 30:7). Fig. 30 and Photo 27 show examples from the Yarmukian sites of Wadi Murabba'at, Nahal Qanah Cave, Munhata and Byblos. Fl. Holemouth jar (Munhata 18.6%; Sha'ar Hagolan 25.5%). This closed, neckless vessel is the most common pottery type at Neolithic sites. Yarmukian holemouth jars have the following features: a The base is flat or disk-shaped, b The rim is pointed, rounded or (rarely) square, c The vessel mouth at the rim is often oval in plan. The complete example from Sha'ar Hagolan (Fig. 31:3) has an oval rather than a round opening, as may be discerned from previous publications, d Two large, opposing lug handles are placed at the narrow ends of the opening, close to the rim. All the sherds of which a large part of the perimeter has been preserved include such handles. There is no evidence for vessels lacking handles or with more than two handles, and therefore sherds lacking handles are also in- ferred to be remains of this type. In most cases, the handles were found 1-2 cm under the rim of the vessel; however, they sometimes touch the rim and occasionally protrude above it (Fig. 31:5-6). 50</page><page sequence="68">Fig. 30.

In some cases the upper part of the vessel received better treatment and was smoothed, while the lower part remained rough, f Some vessels are well fired and the color of the pottery is reddish-brown, while others are badly fired and their color is grayish-brown, g Some of the sherds have low, wide, krater-like proportions, such as one complete vessel from Munhata (Fig. 31:1). Others are of high, narrow, barrel-shaped proportions, such as one complete vessel from Sha'ar Hagolan (Fig. 31:3). As most of the remains are sherds which cannot be restored into complete profiles, one cannot be certain whether a rim sherd belongs to a krater-shaped holemouth or a jar-shaped holemouth. The two types have therefore been combined here, h In a small number of cases the rim rises slightly as if a neck were beginning (Fig. 31:7). i One outstanding item is a holemouth jar with a raised rim and five knobs adjacent to it (Photo 29). j Many items are smoke-blackened and had thus served as cooking pots. Fig. 31 and Photos 28-29 present such items from the Yarmukian sites of Munhata, Nahal Qanah Cave, Sha'ar Hagolan and 'Ain Ghazal. The holemouth jar with two lug handles was a very Photo 28.

Munhata, Yarmukian Ware, holemouth jar. important vessel in the Pottery Neolithic household and is common at almost all sites in the Near East: Jericho IX sites (below, Fig. 57), "néolithique ancien" Byblos (Dunand 1973: Figs. 23:16165; 24:23686), Ugarit (Kuschke 1962: 286; de Contenson 1992: Figs. 162:1, 166:2, 7, 9), 'Amuq A (Braidwood and Braidwood 1960: 50, Fig. 22), Tell el-Kowm (Dornemann 1986: Pl. 28:14-17) and Anatolia (Ozdogan and Ozdogan 1993: Fig. 5). F2. Large Sha'ar Hagolan jar (Munhata 1.6%; Sha'ar Hagolan 0%). This type (Photo 30) consists of jars that are similar in form to the medium-sized Sha'ar Hagolan jar (type Dl, above, Fig. 26:10) but larger. They display the following features: a The diameter of the jar exceeds 20 cm. b The heights of two vessels whose complete profile has been preserved is 25 and 27 cm (Garfinkel 1992a: Fig. 71:1-2). c These jars are generally not decorated or incised, though in some cases remains of red slip are visible. Two almost complete vessels of this type with a full profile have been recovered from Munhata, while other sherds are of the upper part of the vessel. In some cases, the sherds are smaller than half of the rim's circumference and do not include the handle, but the high neck widening toward the top indicates that the sherds belong to this category. 53</page><page sequence="71">Photo 30. Munhata, Yarmukian Ware, large Sha'ar Hagolan jar (Fig. 25:10). F3. Handleless jar (Munhata 13.5%; Sha'ar Hagolan 12.5%). In this type a large variety of jars have been included: high-necked, low-necked, straight-shouldered and sloping-shouldered. The recovery at Munhata and Nahal Qanah Cave of several complete vessels permits definition of the basic features of the handleless jar type: a The base is flat or disk-shaped, b The three complete items from Munhata have an elongated, barrel-shaped body (Fig. 32:1-2, 5). The one complete item from Nahal Qanah Cave has a rounded body (Fig. 32:6), like similar items from Byblos (Dunand 1973: Fig. 26:20100, 32901). c The diameter of the neck is usually less than 10 cm, unlike type F2, where the neck is generally wider.

This category includes four different groups of jars that do not belong to any of the types described above. Of special interest are the particularly large items, perhaps a type of pithos, from Munhata, 'Ain Ghazal, Sha'ar Hagolan and Abu Thawwab presented in Fig. 34. All of these fragments are small sherds, and the entire form and dimensions of the vessel cannot be reconstructed; however, from the thickness of the walls one may estimate that the diameter must have exceeded 50 cm. These jars have no neck, or only a very low one created by the rim rounding outward. A similar item has been reported from Jericho (below, Fig. 61:2). Fig. 34.

The handles were divided into five main groups: 1 Loop handles (Munhata 54.9%; Sha'ar Hago- lan 60.5%). Loop handles appear on the following vessel types: small chalice, deep decorated and undecorated bowls, bowl with large handle, large chalice, large bowl, minia- ture and small jars, Sha'ar Hagolan jar, Jericho IX jar and large Sha'ar Hagolan jar. 2 Lug handles (Munhata 36.8%; Sha'ar Hagolan 35.5%). Seen from above, four shapes can be defined in this group: rounded, triangular, rectangular and elongated. This category in- cludes handles which in other publications have been given a variety of names: knob handles, lug handles or ledge handles. The terminology used for handles has not always been very precise. "Knob handle" or "lug handle" has been used for short, rounded handles, while rectangular handles are usually designated "ledge handle" (Amiran 1969: 38-39, nos. 1-6; Braidwood and Braidwood 1960: 50). In my opinion, however, all these types should be seen as variations of the same handle type, the lug handle. For miniature lugs, see the next category. Lug handles appear on the following vessel types: pots, pithoi and holemouth jars. Fig. 35. Pottery Neolithic, Yarmukian Ware, various handles and bases.

The term "knob" is used here only in relation to miniature lugs with a diameter of ca. 0.5 cm. The knobs were probably purely decorative in function. Such knobs are desig- nated "low rounded blobs of clay" in the 'Amuq area (Braidwood and Braidwood 1960: 50). Decorative knobs appear on handleless jars (Fig. 33:4-6). 4 Pierced handles (Munhata 5.5%; Sha'ar Hago- lan 3.9%). Pierced handles appear on small bowls or cups, deep decorated bowls, deep undecorated bowls, Sha'ar Hagolan jars, Byblos jars and pots. One outstanding item is a handle with two wedge-shaped grooves on the edge (Fig. 35:1). Similar items appear at Jericho (below, Fig. 62:1-2). 5 Tubular handles (Munhata 0.8%; Sha'ar Ha- golan 0%). Such handles are found on jars and bowls (Fig. 35:2-3). A similar handle is reported from Jericho IX (below, Fig. 62:3), where it was designated "wide pierced lug" (Kenyon and Holland 1983: Fig. 5:10). Bases Seven base types were determined in Yarmukian Ware: 1 Flat base (Munhata 47%; Sha'ar Hagolan 55%). 2 Disk base (Munhata 36.7%; Sha'ar Hagolan 33.9%). 3 Chalice base (Munhata 5.6%; Sha'ar Hagolan 1.7%). 4 Convex base (Munhata 3.8%; Sha'ar Hagolan 4.3%). 5 Ring base (Photo 33:1; Munhata 3.3%; Sha'ar Hagolan 1.7%). 6 Base with mat impression (Photo 33:2; Munhata 2.8%; Sha'ar Hagolan 3.4%). 7 Base with rounded impressions (Munhata 1.2%; Sha'ar Hagolan 0%). A small number of bases have a coarse surface with rounded indentations (from pebbles?) with diameters up to 1 cm (Photo 33:3). Bases and some body fragments exhibiting such impressions have been reported from various 6th and 5th millen- nia bee sites (Figs. 35:4-6; 62:8; 89:12-13). A similar phenomenon was observed on complete vessels at Tell Abada in Mesopotamia and designated "Surface-manipulated Ware" (Jasim 1985: Fig. 211). No satisfactory explanation has Photo 33. Munhata, Yarmukian Ware, various bases. been offered for this phenomenon apart from a suggestion, raised by E. Eisenberg in a lecture presented at the Israel Prehistoric Society, that the potter had produced the vessels on a floor of pebbles which had left their imprint on the base. Decoration At Munhata 12.8% of the sherds, and at Sha'ar Hagolan 15.4% of the sherds, were decorated in various styles (Table 6): 1 Red slip or red paint on the entire sherd (Munhata 38.6%; Sha'ar Hagolan 60.5%). When dealing with small sherds, it is not obvious whether the entire vessel had a red slip or whether the sherd is part of a painted section on the vessel; the two are consequently com- bined here. This decoration is found mainly on small bowls and cups, deep decorated bowls, large chalices, Jericho IX jars and large bowls.

This decoration is found mainly on small bowls and cups, miniature and small jars, deep decorated bowls and Sha'ar Hagolan jars. It has been reported from Byblos as well (Fig. 38:1-2). 6 Other incised patterns (Munhata 1.1%; Sha'ar Hagolan 1.5%). The significant pattern in this category consists of incised parallel lines inside triangles (Photos 37-39). This pattern was discovered at Byblos on a number of vessels (see, for example, Fig. 39:1-3), and isolated items with similar incisions have been discov- ered at Sha'ar Hagolan, Munhata and Megiddo (Fig. 39:4-9). This appears to be a northern motif which penetrated the southern Levant from Byblos. Photo 37.

Incision is the chief component of the decoration. The paint is usually a background covering the entire vessel or lines following the contour of the incision. The painting is always executed in different shades of red. Three main elements are present in the incision: a Horizontal lines, b Zigzag lines, c Herring-bone pattern. The decorative techniques were performed in the following order (Fig. 40): 1 Incision of parallel horizontal lines (around the neck of jars and close to the rim of bowls) forming a frame. 2 Incision of parallel zigzag lines beneath the two horizontal lines along the perimeter of the vessel, forming a frame. 3 Filling of the frames with short incisions of herring-bone pattern. 4 Painting red the area not incised; the incised area remains unpainted. The concept of the Sha'ar Hagolan decoration is clearly unique to the Pottery Neolithic period. The stages described above are the traits that generally occur together on vessels classified as belonging to this decoration type. However, several variations of the incised portion of the decoration exist, with only minor differences between them. Most of these variations have been classified into 24 groups (Fig. 41) as follows. For specific references to each group see Garfinkel 1992a: 56-59. 1 Classic simple (Photos 40-41). A horizontal frame runs around the entire perimeter of the vessel, with a parallel zigzag frame undulating between it and the base of the vessel. Each frame is composed of two parallel lines enclosing a herring-bone pattern. On open vessels (bowls) the horizontal frame is located close to the rim, while on closed vessels Oars) it is located at the base of the neck. The horizontal frame is related to the handles and passes through them. 2 Classic double. Pattern no. 1 is doubled: two adjacent horizontal frames encircling the vessel and two zigzag frames undulating between the horizontal frames and the base. 3 Partly double A. One horizontal frame encir- cling the vessel and two zigzag frames undulat- ing between it and the base of the vessel. The frames enclose herring-bone incisions. 4 Partly double B. Two horizontal frames en- circling the vessel and one zigzag frame undulating between them and the base of the vessel. The frames enclose herring-bone inci- sions. 5 Divided double. Two parallel separate zigzag frames undulating between the horizontal frame and the base of the vessel. Each frame encloses herring-bone incisions. 6 Single horizontal frame. One horizontal frame enclosing a herring-bone pattern. 7 Double horizontal frame. Two adjacent hor- izontal frames encircling the vessel. 8 Divided double horizontal frame. Two parallel horizontal frames with a space between them encircling the vessel. 9 Simple frame. Similar to no. 1 but without herring-bone pattern in the frame. 10 Double frame (Photo 42:1). Similar to no. 2 but without herring-bone pattern in the frame. 11 Partly double frame. Similar to no. 3 but without herring-bone pattern in the frame. 12 Horizontal frame. An empty horizontal frame.

This pattern is very similar to the classic simple (no. 1), but the ends of the zigzag frame are not carefully incised and do not meet to form a point. 20 Double pseudo-zigzag. Similar to no. 19, but consisting of double frames. 21 Double pseudo-zigzag frame. Similar to no. 20, but with empty frames. 22 Frame and herring-bone combination. Two parallel frames, one empty and the other enclosing a herring-bone pattern. 23 Zigzag pattern. A zigzag frame with or without herring-bone incisions, undulating to the base of the vessel without horizontal lines. 24 Other enclosed incisions (Photo 43). Instead of herring-bone incisions, the frame encloses par- allel, incised, straight or diagonal lines. The painted decoration added to the incision is found in a number of designs, which can be classified into six main groups (Fig. 42): 1 All the area not incised is painted. 2 Most of the area not incised is painted; the painted area ends in a straight edge close to the base of the vessel. 3 Painted areas adjacent to the incision; this design also includes the painting of the triangles enclosed by the zigzag lines. 4 A painted line adjacent to the incision; the line may be wide or narrow. 5 Several painted lines around the incision; the lines are usually relatively narrow. 6 A painted line above the incision.

JERICHO IX WARE The first Jericho IX sherds were discovered at Jericho at the beginning of the 20th century (Sellin and Watzinger 1913: Bl. 21:F2, 22:F1), but were not recognized as Pottery Neolithic items. The Jericho IX culture was first distinguished in 1935-36 by Garstang; it owes its name to the fact that it was found in Stratum IX of his excavations at Jericho. Over the years additional names have been suggested: "Pottery Neolithic A" (Kenyon 1957; 1960) and "Lodian" (Gopher 1995). Since this cultural tradition was clearly defined by Garstang and is commonly used in the literature, there is no reason to alter the original term. The most characteristic feature of Jericho IX Ware is its decoration, which includes painted and burnished narrow or wide red/brown lines on top of creamy/whitish slip. As mentioned above, painted decoration appears as well in Yarmukian pottery, but the painted areas are not burnished. This distinction has not been fully understood, and some studies (e.g. Gopher and Gophna 1993) include every site with painted sherds in the Jericho IX culture. In this way a distribution map has been created that even includes Tel 'Ali, a site which was not occupied during the Pottery Neolithic period. Clear assemblages of the Jericho IX pottery tradi- tion have been published from the following six sites (Fig. 6): Jericho (lower Jordan Valley). The pottery from Garstang's excavations was published only in preliminary reports. The pottery of Stratum IX from the 1935 season (Droop 1935) and the 1936 season (Ben-Dor 1936) was analyzed and published immediately after each season. Jericho was exca- vated once again by Kenyon during 1952-57. She did not retain Garstang's terminology, and his Stratum IX became "Pottery Neolithic A." The pottery from the new excavations was published in great detail: the typological framework (Kenyon and Holland 1982: 19-53) and the assemblages of the various excavation units (Kenyon and Holland 1983). However, the stratigraphy of the Pottery Neolithic A settlement at Jericho needs revision, as large parts of it have been related to the Pottery Neolithic B settlement (see below). I was kindly permitted to see part of this material at the Rockefeller Museum at Jerusalem. Teluliyot Batash (Judean lowlands). This site was excavated by Kaplan in the mid-1950s; his Stratum IV is characterized by Jericho IX pottery. The material was presented in one article in Hebrew (Kaplan 1958b). I saw part of this material in the storerooms of the Israel Antiquities Authority in Jerusalem, and part of it in the storerooms of the Harvard Semitic Museum at Harvard University. Lod (Judean lowlands). This site was first excavated by Kaplan, and the material was pre- sented in one article in Hebrew (Kaplan 1977). Kaplan reported some Wadi Rabah Ware from Lod as well, though it lacks a clear stratigraphie context. During the 1990s various salvage excavations reached Pottery Neolithic remains. I saw part of the material from Yannai's excavations in the store- rooms of the Israel Antiquities Authority in Tel Aviv. An interesting assemblage from Gopher's excava- tions has been presented in an unpublished MA thesis by N. Blockman (personal communication). This study presents statistical information as well. Ghrubba (lower Jordan Valley). One pit, half of which was destroyed by road construction, and the other half excavated by Mellaart in the early 1950s, constitutes this site. A very detailed account of all of the ca. 120 sherds has been published (Mellaart 1956). Some scholars have understood this sample as an independent cultural unit (Perrot 1968; Kafafi 1987), but the typological analysis carried out in the present study indicates that it is part of the Jericho IX assemblage. Dhra' (eastern Dead Sea shore). This site was tested by Bennett in the late 1970s. A short report presents a few examples of the pottery (Bennett 1980). Recent excavations at the site did not recognize any Pottery Neolithic layer (Kuijt and Mahasneh 1998). However, items assigned there to the Early Bronze Age I are undoubtedly classical Pottery Neolithic sherds (Kuijt and Mahasneh 1998: Fig. 3:c, d). Khirbet ed-Dharih (Wadi Hasa, west-central Jordan). This site was tested in the mid 1980s. A short report presents a few examples of the pottery (Bossut et al. 1988). In addition, small assemblages of classical Jericho IX Ware were reported from Lachish (Tufnell 1958: 300, one sherd), Yiftahel (Braun 1997: 122-29, sherds without clear stratigraphie context), Nahal Zehora II (Gopher 1993; Orrelle 1993), Asawir (Yannai 1995) and Neveh Yam (Galili et al. 1996, a small concentration of sherds in the northern part of the site). 68</page><page sequence="86">The Stratigraphy of the Pottery Neolithic A and B at Jericho The largest assemblage of Jericho IX pottery came from Kenyon's excavations at Jericho. Jericho is the key site for any discussion of this pottery tradition, and the stratigraphy of this site must therefore be clarified. In Garstang's excavations, and later in Kenyon's, two strata containing pottery earlier than the Early Bronze Age were recognized. The earlier stratum was named "Jericho IX" by Garstang and "Pottery Neolithic A" by Kenyon. The later stratum was designated "Jericho VIII" by Garstang and "Pottery Neolithic B" by Kenyon. Kenyon developed the concept that these strata are mixed with one another: "One of the difficulties is to assign the finds to the correct periods. The material from the house levels is rather scanty, and much the greater part comes from the great quarry pits described above. Since these contain material from the destroyed levels of the A people [i.e. Pottery Neolithic A], and also from the pre-pottery houses into which the pits were dug, as well as that belonging to the B people [i.e. Pottery Neolithic B] who dug the pits, it is often not possible to say to which of them an object belongs" (Kenyon 1957: 88). This situation was described by de Vaux as follows: "The stratigraphy of the layers of the Pottery Neolithic period is very uncertain, and it is with some hesitation that Miss Kenyon has identified two phases: Pottery Neolithic A and Pottery Neolithic B. This distinction is based much more on the typology of the pottery than on stratigraphical evidence" (De Vaux 1970: 512). However, in the final publications (Kenyon 1981; Kenyon and Holland 1982; 1983) this point has been omitted. Readers who are not familiar with the preliminary hesitations receive no clue as to the confusion of typology and stratigraphy at Jericho. The main question that arises from the above statements is the following: what were the criteria for Kenyon's separation of the material at Jericho into Pottery Neolithic A (Jericho IX) and Pottery Neolithic B (Jericho VIII)? In the mid 1950s there were practically no publications on Neolithic pottery in the southern Levant and Kenyon had no comparative data with which to correlate the Jericho material. Now, with the publication of five more Jericho IX sites (Teluliyot Batash, Lod, Ghrubba, Dhra' and Khirbet ed-Dharih), as well as the publication of Yarmukian sites (Munhata, Sha'ar Hagolan and Abu Thawwab), the stratigra- phy and typology of Jericho can be approached from a new perspective. The basic conclusion of the new analysis, as presented below, is that the stratigraphy at Jericho is not fundamentally dis- turbed, and that assemblages from clean contexts were unearthed: most of them correspond to Kenyon's Pottery Neolithic A (our Pottery Neo- lithic), and the rest correspond to Kenyon's Pottery Neolithic B (our Early Chalcolithic). There are a few mixed contexts, as in any multi-layer site, but there is no basis for the general conclusion that the stratigraphy is very uncertain. Table 7 presents the nine excavation areas at Jericho in which Pottery Neolithic A or B material was discovered, and the 28 different stratigraphie phases recognized in them. Kenyon's dating of each phase is taken from Table 10 of the latest and most up-to-date Jericho report (Kenyon and Holland 1983:xlvii). I have examined the published pottery from each of these 28 phases. The pottery types have been compared with the different typologies presented in this work: Pottery Neolithic (Yarmu- kian), Early Chalcolithic, Middle Chalcolithic and Late Chalcolithic. The results of this analysis are as follows (note that, to avoid confusion, Kenyon's terminology of Pottery Neolithic A and B is used throughout): 1 Trench I. Stages XXVII-XXIX are dated by Kenyon to the Pottery Neolithic A and Stages XXX-XXXII to the Pottery Neolithic B. The excavation report relates 198 sherds to the Pottery Neolithic A (Kenyon and Holland 1983: Figs. 1-9) and seven sherds to the Pottery Neolithic B (Kenyon and Holland 1983: Fig. 10). All of these seven sherds, however, are typical of the Pottery Neolithic A typology. There is thus no need to subdivide Trench I into two different periods. Moreover, other sherds discovered in later fills in Trench I are also typical of our Neolithic typology. 2 Square Fl. Stages XXVII-XXIX are dated by Kenyon to the Pottery Neolithic A and Stages XXX-XXXIII to the Pottery Neolithic B. From this area the excavation report presents only 17 sherds and relates all of them to the Pottery Neolithic A (Kenyon and Holland 1983: Fig. 32). Since the report dates all of these sherds to one phase, it is not clear why Stages XXX- XXXIII were related to the Pottery Neolithic B. 69</page><page sequence="87">Table 7.

Stage XXX was dated by Kenyon to the Pottery Neolithic A, and 22 sherds were presented (Kenyon and Holland 1983: Fig. 34). Stage XXXI was dated to the Pottery Neolithic B and 16 sherds of this stage were published (Kenyon and Holland 1983: Fig. 35). Of these 16 sherds, 12 are typical of the Pottery Neolithic A (Kenyon and Holland 1983: Fig. 35:1-12) and four are typical of the Pottery Neolithic B (Kenyon and Holland 1983: Fig. 35:13-16). Thus Phase XXXI is mixed, consisting mainly of Pottery Neolithic A material. 4 Trench II. Stages X-XI were dated by Kenyon to the Pottery Neolithic A, and 74 sherds were presented from them (Kenyon and Holland 1983: Figs. 37-39). All of these are clearly Pottery Neolithic A items. Stage XII was dated by Kenyon to the Pottery Neolithic B and 55 sherds were presented from it (Kenyon and Holland 1983: Figs. 40-41). Most of these items correspond to the Pottery Neolithic A, but the following typical Pottery Neolithic B items are included: a Spouted vessel (Kenyon and Holland 1983: Fig. 41:3). b Bow-rim jar (Kenyon and Holland 1983: Fig. 41:7). c A few bow-rim jars published separately from the rest of the assemblage: (Kenyon and Holland 1982: Fig. 27:1, 3, 7, 9-14). It is clear that most of the items of Stage XII at Trench II are from the Pottery Neolithic A and only a small portion of the material is from the Pottery Neolithic B. 5 Trench III. Only Stage X of this area is relevant to our periods. It was dated by Kenyon to the Pottery Neolithic B, and some 80 sherds have been presented from it (Kenyon and Holland 1983: Figs. 75-77). All the items in Fig. 75 are typical of the Pottery Neolithic A. Most of the items in Fig. 76 are typical of the Pottery Neolithic B. Fig. 77 presents a mixed assemblage. Typical Pottery Neolithic B items were discovered in Pit A, and include the following types: a Shallow incurving bowl (Kenyon and Hol- land 1983: Fig. 76:7-8). b Shallow carinated bowl (Kenyon and Hol- land 1983: Fig. 76:9-14). c Holemouth jar with square rim (Kenyon and Holland 1983: Fig. 77:1-5). d Bow-rim jars (Kenyon and Holland 1983: Fig. 76:25). e Flaring neck jar (Kenyon and Holland 1983: Fig. 76:27). However, Pit A also includes a number of typical Pottery Neolithic A items (Kenyon and Holland 1983: Fig. 75:12-23). 6 Square M. Stages XVI-XVIA are dated by Kenyon to the Pottery Neolithic A and Stages XVIB-XVII to the Pottery Neolithic B. All the 70</page><page sequence="88">items published from Stages XVI-XVIA are typical of the Pottery Neolithic A (Kenyon and Holland 1983: Figs. 110-11). From Stages XVIB-XVII 25 sherds were published (Kenyon and Holland 1983: Fig. 112). The report classified 14 of them as belonging to the Pottery Neolithic A and the remaining 11 items were related to the Pottery Neolithic B (Kenyon and Holland 1983: Fig. 112:3-8, 19-23). However, these 1 1 sherds do not include any distinguish- able Pottery Neolithic B types. Thus Square M represents only a Pottery Neolithic A occupa- tion. 7 Square EIII-IV. Stages EE-MM consists of many pits dated by Kenyon to the Pottery Neolithic B. However, some of these pits contained sherds which are typical of the Pottery Neolithic A: a Pit B (Kenyon and Holland 1983: Fig. 120: 4-7; 1982: Fig. 32:8). b Pit D (Kenyon and Holland 1983: Figs. 122:29-33; 123:1-7). c Pit K (Kenyon and Holland 1983: Fig. 123:8- 10). Other pits or excavated areas include sherds which are typical of the Pottery Neolithic B: a Pit W (Kenyon and Holland 1983: Fig. 120:8-11). b Pit M (Kenyon and Holland 1983: Fig. 120:12-13). c Pit T (Kenyon and Holland 1983: Fig. 122:17-18). d Stage MMi (Kenyon and Holland 1983: Fig. 120:17-22). e Stage JJ(s) (Kenyon and Holland 1983: Fig. 121:29-34). Without entering into a stratigraphie discussion, it should be mentioned that Pottery Neolithic A pits were found throughout the sequence side by side with Pottery Neolithic B pits. In any case Square EIII-IV represents not only the Pottery Neolithic B, but the Pottery Neolithic A as well. 8 Grave Area D. In Grave Area D, north of the mound, concentrations of pottery were discov- ered in two locations: D7 and D8. Some of these sherds were dated by Kenyon to the Pottery Neolithic A and others to the Pottery Neolithic B (Kenyon and Holland 1983: Figs. 214-16). Typologically, however, these items do not include any distinguishable Pottery Neolithic B types. Thus the human activity in this area should be dated solely to the Pottery Neo- lithic A. 9 Grave Area J26. In Grave Area J26, north of the mound, a concentration of pottery was discovered inside a shaft. These sherds, which were not recognized as Neolithic during the excavation, were subsequently dated to the Pottery Neolithic A (Kenyon and Holland 1983: Fig. 217). Table 7 presents, side by side, the dates suggested for the various excavation units at Jericho by the excavators, and the conclusions of the new analysis. According to the new analysis most of the excava- tion units, 23 out of 28, are dated to the Pottery Neolithic A. The Pottery Neolithic B is represented in only five units, and was found there mixed with Pottery Neolithic A material. This has far-reaching implications for two issues: 1 The settlement pattern. As opposed to Ke- nyon's original understanding (1957), Pottery Neolithic A Jericho was a large settlement on the mound as well as north of it in the cemetery area. The Pottery Neolithic B, on the other hand, was a very short episode at Jericho, and is hardly represented at the site. 2 The pottery assemblages. Large assemblages of the Pottery Neolithic A have been unearthed at Jericho from clean stratigraphie units, but only small assemblages of the Pottery Neolithic B were discovered, usually in mixed contexts. This picture is also supported by the statistical data published in the tables summarizing the amounts of sherds discovered in the various excavation units (Kenyon and Holland 1983:xli-xlv). Out of 7192 sherds, 5721 (79.5%) are dated by Kenyon to the Pottery Neolithic A, and only 1471 (20.5%) to the Pottery Neolithic B. But since the renewed analysis has demonstrated that in many cases Pottery Neolithic A material has been mistakenly assigned to the Pottery Neolithic B, it seems to me that the proportion is likely to be 90% versus 10%. The flint assemblages conform with this conclusion: 2166 items are related to the Pottery Neolithic A, and only 17 to the Pottery Neolithic B (Crowfoot-Payne 1983: Tables 17-22). How did Kenyon arrive at her conclusions? It seems to me that the root of the confusion is the decoration of incised herring-bone pattern in a frame of parallel lines. This pattern has been discussed above, in the Yarmukian pottery, as 71</page><page sequence="89">Sha'ar Hagolan decoration. Kenyon understood this decoration as being typical of the Pottery Neolithic B and dated to this period every excava- tion unit in which the pattern was found. Thus, most of the Pottery Neolithic A of Jericho was assigned to the Pottery Neolithic B. Kenyon in this case followed an earlier confusion concerning the Sha'ar Hagolan incised herring-bone decoration. In all the following sites this decoration was dated not to the early Pottery Neolithic period, but to later phases: Stratum VIII of Garstang's excavations at Jericho (Droop 1935; Ben-Dor 1936); Stratum XX at Megiddo (Loud 1948); Tell el-Faťah (N) (de Vaux and Steve 1947) and Wadi Murabba'at (Benoit et al. 1961: 20-22). Kenyon's Typological Framework at Jericho In the final excavation reports of Jericho, Kenyon presented a detailed pottery classification system for the Pottery Neolithic A (Kenyon and Holland 1982: 19-53) and another system for the Pottery Neolithic B (Kenyon and Holland 1982: 55-81). The typological framework of the Pottery Neolithic A is presented here in Table 8 and that of the Pottery Neolithic B in Table 9. The pottery of the Pottery Neolithic A is divided into three main categories: bowls, jars and holemouth jars. The bowls are divided into 13 types (12 specific and one for varia), the jars into six types (five specific and one for varia), and all the holemouth jars form one type. In Table 8.

Altogether the Pottery Neolithic A has 41 types (Table 8). The pottery of the Pottery Neolithic B is divided into four main categories: bowls, jars, holemouth jars and spoons. The bowls are divided into 12 types, the jars into six types and the holemouth jars into four types; the spoons form one type. In many of the types there is an additional division. Altogether the Pottery Neolithic B has 42 types (Table 9). Kenyon's classification systems are problematic for the following reasons: 1 The classification is based on the shape of the rim and the angle of the wall rather than the shape of the complete vessel. In some cases Kenyon did not recognize a basic shape, such as the pithos; this common type is scattered in the Jericho classification among different bowl groups (Kenyon and Holland 1982: Figs. 6:3; 7:14; 8:13; 9:16; 26:9-10). 2 The large number of subtypes makes the entire system clumsy and complicated to use. It should be remembered that Neolithic pottery was manufactured at the household level, rather than by highly skilled and specialized potters using the wheel. Thus each vessel is somewhat different in size, thickness of wall, angle of wall, shape of rim or decoration. The classification system should conform with this situation by using a flexible definition of the different pottery types. 3 Owing to the stratigraphie confusion at Jericho, as demonstrated above, some of the Pottery Neolithic A types have been related to the Pottery Neolithic B. Thus the two classification lists represent a mixture of assemblages. Table 9.

The various types have been described above in detail. Two additional types appear in Jericho IX Ware, shallow bowl (C6) and hemispherical bowl (C7); these shapes are fre- quently reported from Jericho IX sites but are very rare in Yarmukian assemblages. No statistical data on the frequencies of the various pottery types in any of the Jericho IX assemblages are available. Only a small portion of the original material was accessible to me, and this summary is therefore based mainly on the relevant reports. Open Vessels Al. Small bowl or cup. This type includes all the bowls or cups that are smaller than 10 cm in diameter. There is great variability here, including: a Shallow bowls. Some items have a rounded wall (Fig. 43:1, 5-8), while other have a straight wall (Fig. 43:4). b Small cups (Fig. 43:11-17). Some of the items are very elegant, with the typical Jericho IX decoration of burnished painted red to brown bands on creamy-pink slip, c A small cup with miniature pierced handles at the rim (Fig. 43:18). A very similar cup is reported from Munhata (above, Fig. 8:17). d Hemispherical (globular) bowls (Fig. 43:19-20). Small bowls or cups, decorated and undecorated, from Jericho, Teluliyot Batash, Khirbet ed-Dharih, Ghrubba, Dhra' and Lod are presented in Fig. 43. A2. Small chalice. Four miniature chalices were reported from Ghrubba (Fig. 44:1-4). They have a high, solid base. Similar chalices have been reported from Yarmukian sites (above, Fig. 9:1-5). Fig. 44.

Two clay spoons were reported from Jericho (above, Fig. 10:4-5) and two from Ghrubba (above, Fig. 10:6-7). The Jericho items were related by Kenyon to the Pottery Neolithic B (Kenyon and Holland 1982: Fig. 39:40; 1983: Fig. 14:26). How- ever, these items were found not in Pottery Neolithic B contexts but in later fills and their attribution to the Pottery Neolithic B lacks typo- logical grounds. Moreover, the clay of these items has been described as typical of Pottery Neolithic A. Thus the two spoons from Jericho should be related to our Pottery Neolithic. For similar items from Yarmukian sites, see above, Fig. 10:3-4). CI. Deep decorated bowl. This type is one of the most common in the pottery assemblages at Jericho and Ghrubba. The items were decorated in a variety of techniques, including: Photo 44. Jericho, Jericho IX Ware, two deep bowls, each with loop handle, decorated with wide painted lines (No. 1, Fig. 45:4).

The most common pattern is composed of red to brown chevrons, sometimes burnished, b Red slip (Fig. 45:1-3; Photo 45). c Incised herring-bone pattern (Fig. 46:1-7). At Yarmukian sites this is the most common decoration, while at Jericho IX sites it is very rare; such items have been reported only from Jericho and Teluliyot Batash IV. In addition, at Jericho IX sites only the horizontal band encircling the vessel, but not the zigzag bands, are incised. Figs. 45-46 and Photos 44-45 illustrate deep decorated bowls from Jericho, Khirbet ed-Dharih, Lod, Ghrubba, Dhra' and Teluliyot Batash. Similar items have been reported from Yarmukian sites (above, Figs. 12-13). Photo 45. Jericho, Jericho IX Ware, deep bowl with lug handle decorated with red slip. C2. Deep undecorated bowl. These deep bowls are similar to the previous type but lack decoration. Fig. 47:1-6 shows examples from Jericho, Ghrubba, Dhra' and Khirbet ed-Dharih. Similar items from Yarmukian sites are presented above in Fig. 14:1-7. C3. Bowl with large handle (mug). This type is very rare in Jericho IX assemblages; Fig. 47:7-8 presents items from Jericho. For similar items from Yarmu- kian sites, see above, Fig. 14:8-10. C4. Large chalice. Large chalices are a rare type in Jericho IX assemblages. Fig. 44 presents large chalices from Jericho and Teluliyot Batash. Similar vessels appear at Yarmukian sites (above, Fig. 9:6-11). C6. Shallow bowl. This type is frequently reported from Jericho IX sites. It includes a variety of shallow bowls: small and large, decorated and undecorated, with sloping or relatively upright walls. Fig. 48 illustrates shallow bowls from Jericho, Ghrubba and Lod. Such items are rarely uncovered at Yarmukian sites (above, Fig. 15). C7. Hemispherical bowl. This type of vessel, some- times designated globular, appears in various Jericho IX assemblages. They resemble the hole- mouth jars of type Fl (below, Fig. 57), but differ in the following aspects: a They have loop handles near the rim rather than the lug handles of the holemouth jars. Some of the items (Fig. 49:1, 5, 11), one of which is certainly reconstructed, have been presented with two handles. However, like the deep bowls of types CI and C2, it is possible that the hemispherical bowls have only one handle, b They are usually smaller, c They are usually decorated, while the hole- mouth jars are usually undecorated. Some have elaborate decoration of burnished painted patterns or incised herring-bone bands. Fig. 49 shows examples from Lod, Jericho, Teluliyot Batash and Ghrubba. Similar items from Yarmukian sites are presented above in Fig. 16. El. Pot. These are deep vessels with relatively upright walls and two lug handles near the rim. Fig. 50 presents such items from Teluliyot Batash, Jericho and Lod. Similar vessels from Yarmukian sites appear above in Fig. 17. E3. Basin. The basin was defined at Jericho as bowl type IIIa.4 (Kenyon and Holland 1982: 24). Fig. 51 and Photo 46 illustrate examples from Jericho and Teluliyot Batash.

Nevertheless, some isolated items can be found in Kenyon's Pottery Neolithic A as well. Fig. 52 shows hole- mouth pithoi from Jericho and Dhra', and Fig. 53 presents open pithoi from Jericho, Lod and Khirbet ed-Dharih. Some of them are decorated with an incised herring-bone band near the rim (Figs. 52:7, 53:6). The rims of the Jericho IX pithoi are similar to the Yarmukian items, including rims that widen evenly inward and outward (Figs. 52:2-3, 53:5).

Similar Yarmukian items are presented above in Fig. 24. D2. Jericho IX jar. This type is the only medium- sized jar appearing at Jericho IX sites, since certain examples of Sha'ar Hagolan or Byblos jars have not been reported. A variety of neck shapes and proportions are represented. In terms of decoration, three groups can be defined: a Jars entirely lacking decoration (Fig. 55:12-15). b Jars decorated with red slip and sometimes burnished as well (Fig. 55:8-11). c Jars decorated with painted patterns (Fig. 55:1- 7). The most common pattern consists of red to brown chevrons, sometimes burnished. On very elaborate items the painting was executed over creamy-pink slip, d Incised patterns, which are typical of Yarmu- kian pottery, have very rarely been reported from Jericho (Fig. 56). None of these items has the high neck of the classical Sha'ar Hagolan jar. Jericho IX jars from Jericho, Teluliyot Batash, Yiftahel, Lod and Ghrubba are presented in Figs. 55-56. Yarmukian jars of this type appear above in Figs. 27-28. Fl. Holemouth jar. This type is the most common in the various figures of the Jericho reports. Most of the holemouth jars are large vessels, but one example is smaller (Fig. 57:6). Some items have cylindrical lug handles (see, for example, Fig. 57:3). One holemouth jar from Jericho (Photo 47) has four lug handles near the rim. Fig. 57 illustrates hole- mouth jars from Jericho, Lod, Teluliyot Batash and Ghrubba. Holemouth jars are also reported from Yarmukian sites (above, Fig. 31). F3. Handleless jar. The three types defined in the Yarmukian assemblages were also discovered at Jericho IX sites: straight neck (Fig. 58:1-2), widen- ing neck (Fig. 58:5-7) and converging neck (Fig. 58:8). Some of the jars are exceptionally well decorated (Fig. 58:3-4, 6). Some rare features have been observed in a number of handleless jars: a Photo 47. Jericho, Jericho IX Ware, holemouth jar with four lug handles. ridge at the base of the neck (Fig. 59:1-2), perforation at the neck (Fig. 59:3) and an internal lug handle (Fig. 59:4). Figs. 58-59 present handleless jars from Jericho, Lod, Teluliyot Batash and Ghrubba. For similar Yarmukian items, see above, Figs. 32-33. F4. Various jars. Under this title two main types of jars appear in the Jericho IX assemblage: a Jars with handles on their body (Fig. 60). In the jars of the Pottery Neolithic period, the handles are typically located at the neck. However, on this type of jar the handles are located at the middle of the body. This type of jar has not been reported from Yarmukian assemblages, and seems to be confined to Jericho IX sites. There are differences in size, ranging from medium (Fig. 60:1-4) to large (Fig. 60:6-7). b Large jars (Fig. 61). This group includes large jars or necked pithoi. These items are much larger than any other jar in the Jericho IX assemblage. One item from Jericho is decorated with the classical herring-bone decoration (Fig. 61:5). Figs. 60-61 present various jars from Jericho, Ghrubba and Khirbet ed-Dharih. 87</page><page sequence="105">Fig. 55.

The latter type was designated at Jericho a "wide pierced lug" (Kenyon and Holland 1983: Fig. 5:10). Isolated examples of additional handle types have been reported as well: 1 Cylindrical lug handle. This rare type of lug handle occasionally occurs in the Jericho reports (see, for example, Figs. 57:3; 62:4-5). At Yarmukian sites, such as Sha'ar Hagolan or Munhata, such items have not been discovered, and I am familiar with only one such item from 'Ain Ghazal (above, Fig. 17:5). 2 Pierced handle with two wedge-shaped grooves on the edge (Fig. 62:1-2). 3 Loop handle with two knobs at its upper part (Fig. 60:3). Another such handle has been reported from Teluliyot Batash (Kaplan 1958b: Fig. 8:13). Bases The types of bases that occur on Yarmukian pottery are found in Jericho IX assemblages: flat base (Fig. 62:7), disk base, chalice base (Fig. 44:7-9), convex base, ring base (Fig. 62:6, 10), base with mat impression and base with rounded impressions (Fig. 62:8). In the Jericho reports bases with mat impressions are not illustrated but are described in the text (Figs. 43:4; 48:9). Decoration Jericho IX vessels were decorated in a variety of techniques. No quantitative data are available on the frequencies of each category: 1 Slip. Two kinds of slip have been reported from Jericho IX assemblages: red and pale (creamy- pink). The red slip appears on small open vessels (Fig. 43:4, 6-7), chalices (Fig. 44:5, 7-9), deep decorated bowls (Fig. 45:1-3), hemisphe- rical bowls (Fig. 49:1-3) and Jericho IX jars (Fig. 55:6). The pale slip does not occur alone but was used as a background for elaborate painted and burnished patterns. 2 Red slip and burnish. The red-slipped vessels were sometimes also burnished. This decoration appears on Jericho IX jars (Fig. 55:5, 7-8). 3 Various painted decorations (Photos 48-50). This is the most characteristic feature of Jericho IX pottery and corresponds to the incised herring-bone decoration of the Yarmukian pottery. The painting was sometimes executed over creamy slip, and the painted area was sometimes burnished, creating very elegant and elaborate vessels. For a detailed discussion see below. 4 Incised patterns of herring-bone inside a frame (Photo 51). This decoration appears on deep decorated bowls (Fig. 46), hemispherical bowls (Fig. 49:9-11), medium-sized jars (Fig. 56:1-2, 4-7) and pithoi (Figs. 52:7; 53:6; 61:5). 5 Incised frame of parallel lines (Fig. 56:3). One such item has been reported from Jericho; it bears the classical Yarmukian composition of a horizontal frame at the base of the neck with a parallel zigzag frame undulating between it and the base of the vessel.

The painted decoration of Jericho IX The elaborate decoration of the Jericho IX vessels was performed in three stages: 1 Covering the vessel's surface with pale creamy- pink slip. 2 Painting various patterns over the slip with red to brown colors. The painting includes four major elements: thin lines (see, for example, Figs. 45:6-8; 48:12; 58:10; 60:2), thick lines (see, for example, Figs. 48:10; 49:4-7; 54:5-7; 55:2-3), triangles (see, for example, Figs. 48:11; 55:1; 58:3; 60:2) and dots (see, for example, Figs. 43:13; 58:3; 60:2). The painted decoration frequently resembles the Yarmukian incised decoration. It is composed of a horizontal band at the base of the neck with parallel zigzag lines (chevron pattern) undulating between it and the base of the vessel. 3 Burnishing the painted pattern, but not the area around it. In the early reports from Jericho this decoration was described as follows: "A dark brown paint of chocolate colour is applied to the outside and covers the greater part of the surface. Horizontal bands or large chevrons left in reserve reveal the original pottery surface or creamy slip and thus form a regular geometric pattern. The paint is usually well burnished and highly lustrous. Care has been taken to limit the burnishing exactly to the painted portions and thus to increase the attractive interchanging of painted and reserved spaces. Only in one or two cases the burnishing tool is seen to have slipped off and gone over the reserved pottery surface. In a few cases we find the same geometric scheme in unburnished red. Sometimes the reserved space predominates and the chevrons are formed by brown bands" (Ben-Dor 1936: 82). Summary The shapes of the vessels unearthed at Jericho, Teluliyot Batash, Lod, Ghrubba, Dhra4 and Khir- bet ed-Dharih represent a pottery tradition which is very similar to the Yarmukian tradition. The differences between these two very closely related assemblages are mainly in the decorative techniques: the Yarmukian potters preferred incised patterns, while the Jericho IX potters preferred painted and burnished patterns. Nevertheless, painted items were discovered at Yarmukian sites (e.g. Figs. 13:10-12; 27:1-4; 36:7-11) and incised items at Jericho IX sites (e.g. Figs. 46; 49:9-11; 56). 96</page><page sequence="114">3.3. NIZZANIM WARE In the southern coastal plain of Israel a few Pottery Neolithic sites are known. The pottery from these sites is simple, including the basic shapes that appear in the Yarmukian/Jericho IX assemblages. However, the decoration of this pottery tradition does not include the typical characteristics of either Yarmukian or Jericho IX Wares. These sites there- fore stand out as an independent pottery tradition. The following sites are included here: Nizzanim. This is the major site in this group, since it was excavated over a relatively large area and a final detailed report has been published (Yeivin and Olami 1979). The pottery assemblage constitutes 145 sherds. The publication includes statistical data and drawings of 42 items. The material is now in the storerooms of the Israel Antiquities Authority in Jerusalem. Giv'at Haparsa. This site was excavated over a limited area, and the excavation report concentrates mainly on flint artifacts (Olami et al. 1977). Very few fragmentary sherds were published, all pre- sented in one figure (Olami et al. 1977: Fig. 8). I saw some of these items in the collection of the late E. Friedman, one of the excavators of this site. Ziqim. This site was excavated over a limited area (Noy 1993). The pottery assemblage, comprising 349 sherds, has recently been analyzed by the author (Garfinkel, in preparation d). The material is now in the storerooms of the Israel Museum at Jerusalem. The few Pottery Neolithic sites of the southern coastal plain produced very small quantities of sherds, indicating that pottery was used only seldom. Since at these sites architecture was entirely lacking and only pits were found, one may suggest that they functioned as seasonal hunting and fishing camps. These sites were founded on sand dunes and after their abandonment were not reoccupied in the Neolithic period. Thus stratigraphie relationships with Yarmukian or Jericho IX settlements cannot be established. In previous discussions the following interpretations regarding their datings were sug- gested: 1 This was an independent pottery tradition that coexisted with the Yarmukian and Jericho IX traditions (Garfinkel 1993a). 2 These sites belong to the Jericho IX tradition and date from a later period than the Yarmu- kian tradition (Gopher and Gophna 1993). 3 The sites may be divided into two phases (Noy 1977); Ziqim belongs to the earlier phase and Nizzanim and Giv'at Haparsa to the later phase. The Typological Framework of Nizzanim Ware The Nizzanim report presents the pottery in one paragraph: "Holemouth jars were the most com- mon type of vessel at Nizzanim. The next most common type was bowls, some with carinated rims. Necked jars were relatively numerous. Sherds of thick base-rings or stands (perhaps incense burners) were also found. Knob and ledge handles predomi- nated, but pierced and loop handles were also found. In general, the pottery was well fired. Although the use of straw temper was noted, more common was the addition of white and grey grits. The clay, sometimes coarsely gritty and sometimes well levigated, was light-brown or yellowish in color, though whitish clay was used for some of the vessels. Dark-red burnished pottery, sometimes treated both inside and out, was found. There were also sherds decorated with dark-red painted bands. No incised pottery came from the excavations themselves, but some was found in the deposits of soil left by the bulldozers" (Yeivin and Olami 1979: 123). One table presents the quantitative data, summarized here in Table 10. Table 10. Inventory of pottery from Nizzanim (Yeivin and Olami 1979: 123).

There are 20 rim fragments: seven (35%) deep bowls, nine 97</page><page sequence="115">(45%) holemouth jars and four (20%) pithoi. In addition there is one unusual item, half broken with a rounded scar in its center (left by a broken-off handle?). It appears to be a pottery lid. Analysis of the assemblages from Nizzanim (the published drawings) and Ziqim in accordance with our Yarmukian/Jericho IX typology reveals the following types: Open Vessels Al. Small bowl. Two small shallow bowls are shown in Fig. 63:1-2. CI. Deep decorated bowl. There are few examples of these, sometimes decorated with red slip (Fig. 63:4). Fig. 63:9 is probably a sherd of this type of bowl. Fig. 63. Pottery Neolithic, Nizzanim Ware, various open vessels.

There is one fine example with painted decoration in this type (Fig. 63:5). El. Pot. At Nizzanim there are a few such vessels with lug handles near the rim (Fig. 63:7). E3. Basin. A relatively small item has been reported from Nizzanim (Fig. 63:8). E4. Pithos. Only open pithoi were found (Fig. 64:1- 2). A relatively large number of lug handles, attached to the rims of large vessels, have been reported from Nizzanim and Giv'at Haparsa (Fig. 64:5-7). At Ziqim 20% of the rim fragments belong to this type; they are holemouth in shape and medium in size, with rounded rims. There are no lugs near the rims, as opposed to other Pottery Neolithic sites. Closed Vessels Fl. Holemouth jars. This is the most common vessel type in the Nizzanim assemblage (Fig. 64:8-10). At Ziqim 45% of the rim fragments belong to this type. It is noteworthy that necked jars have not been reported. Handles and Bases At Nizzanim 29 handles were discovered, most of them (19) classified as "knob and ledge handles." There were seven loop handles and three pierced handles. At Ziqim there are 17 handles, 10 of them loop handles, four lug handles and three unclassi- fied broken items. There are 11 bases, 10 flat bases and one ring base. Two of the flat bases are small in diameter, with straight walls, creating a cylindrical vessel. Decoration Three types of decoration have been reported from Nizzanim: 1 Red slip. There are a few such examples (Figs. 63:4, 9; 64:4). 2 Paint. There are two painted items in our figures (Figs. 63:5, 64:11). 3 Incision. There is one such example in our figures (Fig. 64:12); the herring-bone incised pattern does not appear. 4 Burnish. Though the Nizzanim report men- tioned burnished red slip, no item with this decoration appears among the published pot- tery (Yeivin and Olami 1979: Figs. 16-18). In any case the burnish was not associated with a painted pattern such as that of the Jericho IX tradition. 3.4. DISCUSSION Typology and Function Some twenty types of pottery vessels have been defined in Pottery Neolithic assemblages. In the Munhata assemblage the most common types were the holemouth jar, type Fl (18.6%), deep decorated bowl, type CI (14.6%), pithos, type E4 (13.5%), and handleless jar, type F3 (13.5%). Altogether these four types constitute 60.2% of the diagnostic rim fragments counted. Somewhat less common types are the deep undecorated bowl, type C2 (8.1%), pot, type El (6.9%), basin, type E3 (4.8%), large chalice, type C4 (4.8%), various jars, type F4 (2.6%), Sha'ar Hagolan jar, type D1 (2.2%), and Jericho IX jar, type D2 (2.1%). These seven types constitute 31.5% of the diagnostic rim fragments counted. Rare vessel types, with a frequency of 2% or less, are the small bowl or cup, type Al (2%), large Sha'ar Hagolan jar, type F2 (1.6%), bowl with large handle, type C3 (1.3%), large bowl, type E2 (0.8%), miniature jar, type B1 (0.8%), small jar, type B2 (0.6%), various bowls, type C5 (0.6%), spoon, type A3 (0.4%), and small chalice, type A2 (0.2%). These nine types constitute 8.3% of the diagnostic rim fragments counted. Very similar frequencies have been reported from Sha'ar Hagolan (see Table 4). No statistical data on the frequencies of these types in Jericho IX assemblages are available. The vessels, according to their shape and size, could have served the inhabitants of the site for a large number of purposes related to a household's daily activities: 1 Storage. The holemouth pithoi, whose volume, according to one completely reconstructed vessel, reached 270 liters, represent a consider- able storage potential. Since the diameter of the opening is large, this vessel was unsuitable for 99</page><page sequence="117">Fig. 64. Pottery Neolithic, Nizzanim Ware, various vessels.

Jars, whose neck diameter is small, are particularly suitable for the storage of fluids. Storage containers include vessels defined as Sha'ar Hagolan jar, Jericho IX jar, handleless jar, large Sha'ar Hagolan jar and various jars. 3 Cooking. One of the great advantages of pottery is its ability to come into direct contact with fire and remain intact. This makes it very useful as kitchenware. The holemouth jars and pots, which are usually coarsely constructed and have a rough surface sometimes displaying evidence of burning, could have been used for cooking. The large basin could also have been used during different stages of food processing. 4 "Table ware." Open vessels which were carefully constructed and decorated with paint and incisions could have been used for serving food. The deep decorated bowl and the chalice are typical vessels of this group. Less elaborate vessels are the deep undecorated bowl and the bowl with large handle. 5 Vessels for spices and cosmetics. Small and miniature vessels could have been used for storage of small quantities of valuable commodities such as herbs, spices, medicines and cosmetics. The variety of shapes and sizes of the Pottery Neolithic vessels convey the impression that they satisfactorily served all the everyday functions and needs of a family household. The Chronological Relationship between the Yarmukian and Jericho IX One of the main problems concerning the Pottery Neolithic period is the chronological relationship of the Yarmukian, Jericho IX and Nizzanim traditions. Following the discovery of the Yarmukian at Sha'ar Hagolan at the end of the 1940s, a heated debate ensued on its relationship to the lower levels at Jericho, Jericho IX (Pottery Neolithic A) and Jericho VIII (Pottery Neolithic B). Five different suggestions have been offered over the years: 1 The Yarmukian precedes Jericho IX (Aurenche et al. 1981: 572; Kafafi 1987; Gopher and Gophna 1993). 2 The Yarmukian is contemporary with Jericho IX (Stekelis 1972; Moore 1982; de Contenson 1983: 67; Stager 1992; Garfinkel 1993a). 3 The Yarmukian postdates Jericho IX and precedes Jericho VIII (Kaplan 1959a; 1969; Kirkbride 1971). 4 The Yarmukian is contemporary with Jericho VIII (Kenyon 1960; Moore 1973). 5 The Yarmukian is contemporary with both Jericho IX and Jericho VIII (de Vaux 1970). When the debate began only two sites were known: Jericho and Sha'ar Hagolan. Since then many more Yarmukian and Jericho IX sites have been dis- covered, but no clear stratigraphie relationship between the two units has emerged. Since no radiometric datings are available for Jericho IX assemblages, the chronological relationship between Jericho IX and the Yarmukian cannot be deter- mined on such a basis. Two other criteria must, therefore, be employed: typology and geographical distribution. Typologically, the basic vessels found in the Yarmukian are also found in Jericho IX sites (Table 11). The greatest divergence between the two pottery assemblages is found in the style of decoration: incised frame and herring-bone pattern in the Yarmukian and painted lines and burnish in the Jericho IX. The flint assemblage of the two cultures is also very similar: Crowfoot-Payne, who published the flint artifacts from Jericho, designated them "Yarmukian" (Crowfoot-Payne 1983). Geographically, it should be noted that the main Jericho IX sites are concentrated in the southern parts of Israel, while the main Yarmukian sites are found in the north and center of Israel (Fig. 6). The sites of each pottery tradition do not overlap geographically, except for some small find spots. In any case, it is interesting to note that although Yarmukian and Jericho IX Wares have been so far found in more than 30 sites, no clear stratigraphie relationship between the two has been established. From the typological and geographical points of view one should therefore understand the Yarmukian and Jericho IX as the contem- poraneous existence of two cultures in separate geographic regions. The hypothesis that we are dealing with an early and a late period creates an anomalous situation: during the Jericho IX period all of the central part of the Levant is empty, whereas during the Yarmukian period the south of the Levant is not settled. I therefore conclude, on the strength of typological and geographic 101</page><page sequence="119">Table 11. Typological comparison between Yarmukian, Jericho IX and Nizzanim Wares.

The sites of the southern coastal plain of Israel should be understood in this context. They include assemblages of pottery and flint with characteristics similar to the Yarmukian and the Jericho IX assemblages. The differences in the forms of decoration are also regional rather than chronolo- gical. The Relationship between the Yarmukian and Byblos Three different Neolithic levels were defined by the excavator of Byblos: "néolithique ancien," "néolithique moyen" and "néolithique récent" (Dunand 1973). The excavations at Byblos were not performed stratigraphically, in the usual archaeological sense of the word, but the settle- ment levels were artificially separated from one another every 20 cm. The artifacts from the three levels are chronologically very mixed and it is difficult to establish which elements do indeed belong to each stage and which are intrusive. Three stratigraphie correlations of Byblos and the Yarmukian have been suggested: 1 The Yarmukian coincides with the "néolithique ancien" of Byblos (Stekelis 1972; Kirkbride 1971; de Contenson 1983: 67; Bar-Yosef 1987; Garfinkel 1993a). 2 The "néolithique ancien" of Byblos should be divided into two phases: "néolithique ancien" and "néolithique ancien final"; the "néolithique ancien final" is contemporary with the Yar- mukian (Aurenche et al. 1981). No argumen- tation was given to justify the splitting of "néolithique ancien" Byblos into two or the relation of the Yarmukian to the second stage. 3 The Yarmukian coincides with the "néolithique moyen" of Byblos (Cauvin 1968). When the various components of the Yarmukian material culture are compared with Byblos, a close affinity is apparent between it and the "néolithique ancien" in the following aspects: 1 The pottery includes many similar shapes. 2 Incised herring-bone decoration appears (Fig. 61). 3 Incised parallel lines in triangles appear (Fig. 62). 4 The flint industry includes deep denticulated sickleblades. 5 Anthropomorphic pebble figurines appear. 6 Anthropomorphic clay figurines with cowrie (coffee bean) eyes appear. 7 Geometric patterns incised on seals at Byblos appear on basalt pebbles at Sha'ar Hagolan. 102</page><page sequence="120">8 The single radiometric date from "néolithique ancien" Byblos coincides with the available Yarmukian datings (see below, Table 24). The divergences between the "néolithique ancien" at Byblos and the Yarmukian with regard to pottery and architecture should be understood as regional rather than chronological. The inhabitants of Byblos were probably exposed to influence from the other sites of the Phoenician coast: Tell Sukas (Riis and Thrane 1974), Ugarit (de Contenson 1992) and the 'Amuq plain (Braidwood and Braidwood 1960). The "Munhata-Ghrubba Phase" At the conclusion of his excavations at Munhata, Perrot suggested a subdivision of Stratum 2b at this site into two stages (Perrot 1968): 1 The Sha'ar Hagolan phase (Stratum 2b2), the earlier stage within Stratum 2b, characterized by incised herring-bone decoration. 2 The Munhata-Ghrubba phase (Stratum 2b 1), the later stage within Stratum 2b, characterized by painted decoration. This was related only to the northern area at Munhata. The latest analysis of the pottery from Munhata did not support this notion (Garfinkel 1992a): in the New Encyclopedia of Archaeological Excavations in the Holy Land (Perrot 1993) Stratum 2b is presented as one homogeneous unit. Nevertheless, the term "Munhata-Ghrubba" or "Ghrubba" still appears in the literature (Gopher and Gophna 1993: 318; Obeidat 1995: 107). In order to demonstrate that there is no basis for this term, Table 12 presents the incised versus the painted decoration from all the relevant units in the northern area of Munhata. In the lower part of the table these data are compared to Sha'ar Hagolan and the entire site of Munhata. The painted decoration constitutes 36.1% in the Table 12. The distribution of painted versus incised sherds near the rounded structure in the northern area at Munhata.

The incised decoration constitutes 64.0% in the northern part of Munhata, 65.5% at Sha'ar Hagolan and 70.3% at the entire site of Munhata. The northern part of Munhata and Sha'ar Hagolan thus share the same proportions of painted and incised decoration. According to this logic, the site of Sha'ar Hagolan should also be classified as "Ghrubba." In other words, small changes in the proportion of painted and incised decoration cannot be used as cultural markers in the Pottery Neolithic period. 103</page><page sequence="121">CHAPTER FOUR POTTERY OF THE EARLY CHALCOLITHIC PERIOD 4.1. THE TERMINOLOGY OF THE CHALCOLITHIC PERIOD Before presentation of the pottery assemblages of the Chalcolithic period, the term "Chalcolithic" itself needs clarification. Until the end of the 1950s the term was applied to three independent periods (Wright 1937; Albright 1949; Glueck 1951; de Contenson 1960): 1 Early Chalcolithic, including Jericho VIII and the Yarmukian. 2 Middle Chalcolithic, including Tuleilat el-Ghas- sul, the Beersheba sites and Tel Beth Shean XVIII. 3 Late Chalcolithic, including Gray Burnished Ware (Esdraelon Ware). In the late 1950s this terminology became redun- dant. On the one hand Kenyon, following the excavations at Jericho, redesignated the Early Chalcolithic of Jericho VIII as "Pottery Neolithic B" (Kenyon 1957; 1960). On the other hand, the Late Chalcolithic was incorporated into the Early Bronze Age: Kenyon named it Proto-Urban (1957; 1960) and Wright named it the Early Bronze Age I A (1958). With its head and tail chopped off, the Chalcolithic comprised only a single phase. Thus, in later basic works on the archaeology of the southern Levant (Kenyon 1960; Amiran 1969; Aharoni 1982; Mazar 1990; Ben-Tor 1992; Stager 1992), the term Chalcolithic refers only to the previous "Middle Chalcolithic" period. However, one should be aware that Gustavson-Gaube, who excavated Tell esh-Shunah in the mid 1980s, uses the terms "Middle Chalcolithic" for the Ghassul-Beersheba culture and "Late Chalcolithic" for the gray- burnished assemblage of the Early Bronze Age I (Gustavson-Gaube 1985; 1986). In this work the tripartite division of the Chalcolithic period has been restored, though the pottery assemblages of each are different: 1 The Early Chalcolithic comprises Jericho VIII ("Pottery Neolithic B") and Wadi Rabah. 2 The Middle Chalcolithic comprises Tel Beth Shean XVIII, Tel Zaf, the lower levels at Tuleilat el-Ghassul and the Qatifian culture. 3 The Late Chalcolithic comprises the upper levels at Tuleilat el-Ghassul, the Beersheba sites, ossuary burial caves in the coastal plain, the Golan Heights and the Hulah Valley cultures. Recently, various suggestions have been made for the subdivision of the Late Chalcolithic into subphases, such as Developed Chalcolithic and Terminal Chalcolithic (Gilead 1994; Joffe and Dessel 1995). These studies, however, are based on radiocarbon dates rather than on the analysis of pottery assemblages. 4.2. THE EARLY CHALCOLITHIC ASSEMBLAGES (Photo 52) The first Early Chalcolithic assemblage was un- earthed in Stratum VIII in Garstang's excavations at Jericho in 1935-36. In the report of the 1935 season it was designated "Chalcolithic" (Droop 1935) and in the report of the 1936 season it was designated "Neolithic" (Ben-Dor 1936). Thus, the confusion still encountered today as to whether this phase belongs to the Neolithic or Chalcolithic period began at the very first stage of research. The similarity of the Jericho VIII pottery to assemblages in the northern Levant was discussed by Wright in the early 1950s (Wright 1951). In the mid 1950s Kaplan excavated the site of Wadi Rabah. He understood the material culture unearthed at this site as a unique tradition and named it the "Wadi Rabah Culture" (Kaplan 1958a). He viewed the assemblage of Jericho VIII as a later phase, postdating the site of Wadi Rabah and predating the site of Tuleilat el-Ghassul. However, as the typological analysis below will 104</page><page sequence="122">Photo 52. Hazorea and 'Ein el-Jarba, Wadi Rabah Ware, various vessels. show, the pottery assemblages of Wadi Rabah and Jericho VIII are very closely related to one another. Over the years Kaplan excavated the Wadi Rabah sites of Teluliyot Batash III, Lod, Habashan Street, 'Ein el-Jarba and Kefar Gil'adi. In his studies he emphasized the following: 1 The unique Wadi Rabah decoration, compris- ing red and black burnish together with a variety of surface manipulation techniques: combing, incision, impression and plastic at- tachments. 2 The typological similarity to the Halafian pottery of the northern Levant (Kaplan 1960). From the terminological point of view, Kaplan classified the Wadi Rabah culture as Chalcolithic. In the late 1950s, after her renewed excavations at Jericho, Kenyon redesignated Stratum VIII of Garstang's excavations as "Pottery Neolithic B" (Kenyon 1957; 1960). In the early 1970s Anati excavated Wadi Rabah assemblages near Kibbutz Hazorea, which he named "Coastal Neolithic" (Anati 1971; Anati et al. 1973: 79-84). Thus, four different terms were suggested over the years for the same cultural unit: Jericho VIII, Wadi Rabah, Pottery Neolithic B and Coastal Neolithic. Of these, the term Wadi Rabah is most commonly used in the literature and is therefore adopted here as the name of the characteristic ware of the Early Chalcolithic period. It should be emphasized that, beyond the semantic confusion which was created by giving parallel names to the same archaeological units, the archaeological units themselves were not always adequately defined. Some scholars included in the Wadi Rabah culture assemblages which are not related to it, and other scholars excluded assem- blages which are related to it. In order to avoid further disorder, the following list specifies the 105</page><page sequence="123">relevant Early Chalcolithic assemblages (Fig. 65) and their state of publication: Jericho (lower Jordan Valley). Early Chalcolithic pottery was discovered in Stratum VIII of Gar- stang's excavations and was published only in preliminary reports (Droop 1935; Ben-Dor 1936). In Kenyon's excavation in the 1950s this settlement was designated "Pottery Neolithic B." The pottery was published in great detail in the final publica- tion reports (Kenyon and Holland 1982: 55-81; 1983). However, as I have stated earlier, the stratigra- phy is confused, as large parts of the Pottery Neolithic A material have been artificially related to the Pottery Neolithic B. In the introduction to the last volume of the Jericho publications some quantitative data are given on the number of sherds and their dating in each excavation unit. Altogether 5721 sherds are assigned to the Pottery Neolithic A and 1471 sherds to the Pottery Neolithic B (Kenyon and Holland 1983:xli-xlv). However, as shown in the analysis of the Jericho stratigraphy (above, Table 7), most of the contexts have been erro- neously assigned to the Pottery Neolithic B. More- over, the analysis of the typology shows that various types of Jericho IX (Pottery Neolithic A) vessels have been mistakenly related to the Pottery Neolithic B. Thus many (at least half) of the 1471 sherds related to Pottery Neolithic B in fact came from the Pottery Neolithic A level. It now seems that only 600-700 sherds came from Pottery Neolithic B Jericho, while some 6500 sherds came from the Pottery Neolithic A. I examined a few items from Stratum VIII of Garstang's excavations at the Rockefeller Museum in Jerusalem. Munhata (central Jordan Valley). An Early Chalcolithic settlement (Stratum 2a) has been exposed over a large area (Perrot 1964; 1966; 1968; 1993). It was discovered above a Yarmukian village (Stratum 2b) and below an Early Bronze I settlement (Stratum 1). The excavations at Munhata produced 47,320 sherds, the largest known assem- blage of Wadi Rabah pottery, which was published by the author (Garfinkel 1992a). Wadi Rabah (coastal plain). Excavations on a limited scale were carried out on this site by Kaplan in the mid 1950s. He published a short report and coined the term "Wadi Rabah culture" (Kaplan 1958a). Kaplan published two plates of sherds, most shown not in conventional drawings with section and profile but in frontal view only. I examined the pottery assemblage in the storerooms of the Israel Antiquities Authority at Jerusalem. Habashan Street (coastal plain). This site is located in the center of Tel Aviv. Three seasons of excavations were conducted between 1950 and 1952. Three occupation strata were unearthed: I, Early Bronze; II, Wadi Rabah; and III, Yarmukian (Kaplan and Ritter-Kaplan 1993). No data on the Wadi Rabah pottery have been published. Teluliyot Batash (Judean lowlands). At this site, excavated by Kaplan in the mid 1950s, Stratum III is characterized by Early Chalcolithic/ Wadi Rabah pottery (Kaplan 1958b). It was found above Stratum IV, a Jericho IX settlement. The material was published in one article in Hebrew. I examined the pottery assemblage in the storerooms of the Israel Antiquities Authority in Jerusalem, and part of it in the storerooms of the Harvard Semitic Museum. Tel 6 Ali (central Jordan Valley). This site was excavated twice, first by Prausnitz in the 1950s (Prausnitz 1965; 1970b; Sussman 1990), and later, in the late 1980s, by the author (Garfinkel 1992b; 1993d). According to Prausnitz's stratigraphy and the results of the new excavations, the following occupation strata were unearthed: la Late Chalcolithic. Ib Middle Chalcolithic. Ic Early Chalcolithic. Characteristic elements of Wadi Rabah pottery were reported, without illustration, as "a very beautiful dark face burnished ware" and "bands of a red or brown paint carefully and brilliantly burn- ished alternate with reserved surfaces deco- rated with incised or stabbed decorations. The incisions may be running lines, wavy lines running parallel" (Prausnitz 1965). II Pre-Pottery Neolithic C (Garfinkel 1994). No pottery was discovered here during the new excavations. III-V Pre-Pottery Neolithic B. Wadi Murabba'at Cave (Judean Desert). In several adjacent caves in Wadi Murabba'at, Yar- mukian, Wadi Rabah and Ghassulian sherds were discovered in the mid 1950s. I examined the pottery assemblage in the storerooms of the Rockefeller Museum in Jerusalem. One classical bow-rim jar (Benoit et al. 1961: Fig. 2:27) is clearly related to Wadi Rabah pottery. 106</page><page sequence="124">P' ir- I*, Tel Dan ir- I*, Tel Dan C «Nahal ' Bezet I '_ ' ' ļ ~ i «Horvat 'Uza ì - NevehYamY Tel 'Ali ļ/~" ^ ziizzizizzziizzzizi^īEzīEīEEEEEEEīEEEEEīEEEEEīīi 'Ein el-Jarba Nahal» t Hazorea ^ Zehora ^bu Zureiq Munhata»^ - ~~ ====7 I &amp; Il ) ^7 • Asawir ? / • Wadi Rabah I / Habashan Street / =7 • Lod ) - 7 Jericho» ' / #Teluliyot ' / Batash / - / Wadi Murabba'at • / Cave / - =/ ' Ir ■ § 0 20km Fig. 65.

Up to the publication of the Munhata assemblage this report constituted the best publica- tion on Wadi Rabah pottery. However, Kaplan did not consider all the pottery variations from this site (Garfinkel, in preparation c). I examined the pottery assemblage in the storerooms of the Israel Anti- quities Authority at Jerusalem and the part of it that is kept in the storerooms of the Harvard Semitic Museum. Hazorea (Jezreel Valley). The site designated "Hazorea" by Anati (Anati 1971; Anati et al. 1973) is adjacent to the sites of 'Ein el-Jarba (Kaplan 1969; Meyerhof 1982), Abu Zureiq (Perrot 1963) and Tel Qiri (Baruch 1987). It is not clear whether all these sites should be viewed as a concentration of several small settlements or one large village. A good collection of sherds and a few complete vessels were reported from this site (Anati 1971; Anati et al. 1973: Pl. XVIII:4a-b). This assemblage was named "Coastal Neolithic" by the excavator. I examined part of the assemblage at the Wilfrid Museum at Kibbutz Hazorea. Abu Zureiq (Jezreel Valley). This site is adjacent to the sites of Hazorea and 'Ein el-Jarba. Small- scale excavations were carried out here by Perrot in the early 1960s (Perrot 1963). I am currently preparing this assemblage for publication (Garfin- kel, in preparation b). Neveh Yam (coastal plain). This submerged site was first discovered in the early 1970s (Prausnitz and Wreschner 1971), and a detailed account of the pottery collected was published (Prausnitz 1977). During the mid 1990s additional work was carried out at this site and a rich assemblage of Wadi Rabah pottery was collected (Galili et al. 1996). I was kindly permitted to see the pottery assemblage in the storerooms of the underwater archaeology center of the Israel Antiquities Authority near Atlit. Lod (Judean lowlands). As mentioned above, a Jericho IX settlement was discovered in situ at this site. Kaplan reported some Wadi Rabah pottery as well, though it lacked stratigraphie context (Kaplan 1977). Tel Dan (upper Jordan Valley). During the excavations of a Middle Bronze Age rampart a narrow trench, 2 m deep, was dug into earlier remains. Five phases were revealed and published as one homogeneous assemblage, which was described as "either preceding the Wadi Rabah culture or paralleling the earlier part of its sequence" (Gopher and Greenberg 1987: 1 1 1). I was kindly permitted to see the pottery assemblage in the storerooms of the Hebrew Union College, Jerusalem. Close examina- tion of the stratigraphy and the material culture suggested three different phases of occupation, from bottom to top: 1 Local phases d-e (Pre-Pottery Neolithic C), including small arrowheads, denticulated sickle- blades and White Ware vessels. 2 Local phases b-c (Early Chalcolithic), including typical Wadi Rabah pottery. 3 Local phase a (Middle Chalcolithic), including two infant burials in jars which were dug into earlier phases and a basalt chalice. Nahal Bezet I (Western Galilee). Small-scale excavations were carried out at this site by Gopher in 1986-87 (Gopher 1989). Above Pre-Pottery Neolithic remains a few pits containing Wadi Rabah pottery were discovered. The assemblage, constituting some 120 sherds, was discussed in detail, including quantitative data (Gopher et al. 1992). Horvat 6Uza (coastal plain). Typical Wadi Rabah pottery was discovered in Stratum 19 (Getzov 1995). I examined this unpublished material in the storerooms of the Israel Antiquities Authority in Akko. Asa wir (coastal plain). Typical Wadi Rabah pottery was discovered in Stratum VI (Yannai 1995; 1997). I examined this unpublished material in the storerooms of the Israel Antiquities Authority in Tel Aviv. Nahal Zehora I and II (Carmel hills). These two sites are located several kilometers from one another. Wadi Rabah pottery was reported without typological presentation (Gopher 1993; Orrelle 1993). Hagosherim (upper Jordan Valley). Typical Wadi Rabah pottery was discovered in the new excava- tions conducted at the site in the summer of 1996 (Getzov personal communication). 4.3. WADI RABAH WARE Before the detailed typological description, a few remarks on the potter's technique are in order: 1 The wheel was not used and all the pottery is handmade. 108</page><page sequence="126">2 A typical feature of Wadi Rabah pottery is a sharp carination in one or both of two positions; between the neck and the body, or at the shoulder, on the lower part of the vessel narrowing toward the base. It has been sug- gested that the latter type of carination was produced by the use of stone molds (Yannai 1997). 3 The rims are carefully constructed, from the smallest vessel to the largest pithos. 4 In many jars it is obvious that the neck was made separately and then attached to the body of the vessel; the joint is discernible on the interior of the jar. 5 Great care was usually taken in the treatment of small and medium-sized vessels. Most of these items have a smoothed surface, and an elabo- rate red or black slip and burnish are quite common. 6 The potters had reached full control of the firing process in kilns. Oxidizing or reducing atmo- spheres were used in order to obtain the burnished red or black slip. 7 Pétrographie studies show that the vessels were made at each site from local raw materials (Goren 1992). Carbonatic clay was preferred. Even the most delicate vessels that have elaborate black slip and burnish were made locally rather than at a specialized pottery production center. Early scholars of the Wadi Rabah culture did not suggest a systematic typological framework within which to describe and analyze its pottery. From Garstang's excavations at Jericho VIII very few items were published. Kenyon's assemblages from the equivalent phase (Pottery Neolithic B) are mixed with the Pottery Neolithic A (see discussion above, and Table 7). From Kaplan's excavation at the site of Wadi Rabah, where this term was coined, only two plates of artifacts have been published (Kaplan 1958a: Figs. 5-6). This small sample gives a partial picture and certainly does not include all the ceramic types of the Wadi Rabah pottery. Wadi Rabah assemblages have also been described by Kaplan at Teluliyot Batash III (1958b), Lod (1977) and 'Ein el-Jarba (1969). The assemblages published from the first two sites are very small. A larger assemblage was published from 'Ein el-Jarba, but it too displays only part of the ceramic variation of this period. Kaplan's many pioneering studies did not provide a typological framework for the description of the pottery of the Wadi Rabah culture. The first site for which a detailed typological framework for the Wadi Rabah pottery was established was Munhata (Garfinkel 1992a). The ceramic assemblage of Munhata was especially suitable for this purpose because of the following five features: 1 The site was systematically excavated. 2 The assemblage is large (47,320 sherds). 3 The excavated area is extensive. 4 Some joining sherds enabled the restoration of complete or near-complete vessels. 5 Full quantitative data are available. All the statistical data concerning the Wadi Rabah pottery in Munhata were presented in the final publication report (Garfinkel 1992a: Tables 16-19). The assemblage includes 47,320 sherds, of which the following counts were made: 1 2956 decorated sherds constitute 6.2% of the assemblage. 2 2172 diagnostic rims constitute 4.6% of the assemblage. 3 615 base fragments constitute 1.3% of the assemblage. 4 142 handles constitute 0.3% of the assemblage. In the typology of the Wadi Rabah pottery, the main division of the items is into open and closed vessels (Fig. 66). The open vessels are divided into four main types: A, deep bowls; B, shallow bowls; C, chalices and stands; and D, pithoi. The bowls were divided into subtypes according to the shape of the walls: carinated, rounded and straight. The closed vessels comprise two types: E, holemouth jars, and F, necked jars. At Munhata 21 different types were recognized. In this study, in which the evidence from other sites is taken into account, two further types are defined: B7, platter, and F5, straight-necked jar. In Wadi Rabah assemblages in general only a few items have been restored to form complete vessels and most of the material consists of small rim sherds. Consequently, many of the typological shapes are only partially known to us. In order to overcome this obstacle, similar complete items reported from Tell Halaf (von Oppenheim 1943) are shown at the top of the pottery figures. In one case (Fig. 78), vessels from Ugarit are used for the same purpose. In these cases, only the profile is shown, since the decoration differs from that of the Wadi Rabah assemblage. 109</page><page sequence="127">írT (N öb E hé &lt;N On a «e cd a e3 a s os B Ctí £ •a xí Ctf 1 • £ &lt;4-1 O t: ¿a o "tf o 'Sb o o a o 03 S CL» O C/5 O a -&lt;-&gt; o ü U Th cd u VO VO #&amp;b E 110</page><page sequence="128">A. Deep Bowls Al. Small deep carinated bowl (Munhata 2.5%). This type includes small bowls with the following characteristics: a The bowls are deep, delicate and carefully designed with a thin wall, b The diameter is smaller than 10 cm. c The wall is carinated in the lower part near the base. Another carination sometimes occurs near the rim. d The rim is pointed or rounded, e The base is somewhat rounded and there is no clear division between it and the bottom part of the wall. The base is sometimes convex, f Most of the items are decorated with black slip and burnish, some with red slip and burnish, g According to the relation between the rim and the body, four groups can be identified: straight wall, converging wall, widening wall and inverted rim. Fig. 67:1-3 presents small deep carinated bowls from Munhata, Tel Dan and Hazorea. In addition, somewhat different items from Munhata and Hazorea are shown in Fig. 67:4-5 and Photo 53. Photo 53. Hazorea, Wadi Rabah Ware, small deep carinated bowl (Fig. 67:5). A2. Large deep carinated bowl (Munhata 8.7%). This type is similar in character to the previous one (Al), but the diameter of the bowls exceeds 10 cm and is usually smaller than 20 cm. These bowls are characterized by red slip and burnish on the exterior and a narrow band on the interior. Within this type, some vessels are wider (Fig. 67:6-7), while others are narrower and deeper (Fig. 67:8); however, no differentiation has been made between the two, since most of the finds are small rim fragments that cannot be assigned to either of the groups. Fig. 67:6-8 shows three large deep carinated bowls from Munhata. A3. Spouted vessel (Munhata 0.5%). Very few sherds of spouts originally belonging to deep bowls have been recovered from Wadi Rabah sites. Fig. 68 presents spouts from Munhata, Teluliyot Batash and Jericho VIII (Pottery Neolithic B). A4. Flaring-rim bowl (Munhata 2.8%). This type includes all the bowls with a flaring rim that curves sharply outward. A variety of shapes and sizes, from Wadi Rabah, Munhata, 'Ein el-Jarba, Tel Dan and Hazorea, is illustrated in Fig. 69 and Photo 54. Some items are krater-shaped bowls with a relatively low neck (Fig. 69:2, 6-7), while others have a flower-pot shape (Fig. 69:5; Photo 54). Some of the rims are rather similar to those of the jars of type Fl (Fig. 85), but with two important differences: a The diameter of the bowls is much larger, b Bowls usually have a slip on the interior, whereas the jars are slipped on the exterior.

Shallow Bowls Bl. Shallow incurving bowl (Munhata 8.4%). This is a very common bowl in Wadi Rabah assemblages. It has the following characteristics: a The wall is rounded from rim to base, b The wall converges near the rim to form a closed shape; the diameter at the rim is smaller than the largest diameter, c The vessel is decorated with red or black slip and is burnished. The decoration is found on the upper half of the exterior of the vessel and on the interior close to the rim. One bowl is decorated with stylus impressions (Fig. 70:4). d The diameter is greater than the height, e The diameter is usually larger than 20 cm, though in rare cases smaller items occur (Fig. 70:8). Fig. 70 and Photo 55 show examples from Hazorea, Teluliyot Batash, Jericho, Munhata, Lod, Neveh Yam, 'Ein el-Jarba, Abu Zureiq and Nahal Bezet. Photo 55. Hazorea, Wadi Rabah Ware, shallow incurving bowl (Fig. 70:1). B2. Shallow rounded open bowl (Munhata 1.3%). Bowls of this type have the following characteristics: a The vessel is shallow, its diameter being greater than its height, b The walls are rounded from rim to base, c The largest diameter of the vessel is at the rim. d Some items have handles close to the rim. The handles are flat, elongated lugs or ledge handles. The complete vessel may have had two handles, one on each side, e The vessels are decorated only on the interior. They are especially carefully decorated with red slip and burnished, f The rim is designed in one of the following forms: widening inward, widening outward or square. Fig. 71 presents examples from Munhata and Jericho. B3. Shallow carinated bowl (Munhata 1.3%). This type includes shallow carinated bowls with the following characteristics: a The bowls are elegant and carefully designed with exceptionally thin walls, b The vessel may be carinated at its lower part or near the rim. c The base is sometimes convex, d Most of the items are decorated with burnished black slip, e Two subtypes can be defined: 1 Items with a straight or slightly outcurved rim. Fig. 72 and Photos 56-57 illustrate examples from Neveh Yam, Munhata, Teluliyot Batash, Jericho, 'Ein el-Jarba, Nahal Bezet and Hazorea. 2 Items with a sharply converging rim. Fig. 73 shows examples from 'Ein el-Jarba, Munhata and Jericho. Additional items have been published from Asawir (Yannai 1997: Fig. 1:4, 8). f Yannai (1997), who recently published cari- nated bowls of various shapes from Asawir, suggests that they were made in stone molds.

Basins/large bowls (Munhata 3.8%). These are shallow vessels with thick walls and a large diameter. The two subtypes of this type are: a Undecorated, with a slightly rounded wall and a rim usually widening inward, b Decorated with red or black slip and burnished. In this subtype the rim does not widen. Rim fragments of this group are sometimes similar to those of pithoi of type D2, except that the basin rims curve outward, while they are straight in the pithoi. In the basins the slip is usually internal, while in the pithoi it is external. Fig. 74 presents examples from Munhata, Jericho, Nahal Bezet and Neveh Yam. B5. Lid (Munhata 0.6%). In the Munhata report this type was defined as a shallow bowl with straight walls. However, it seems more likely that the items functioned as lids. In this case the "base" would have been at the top and the holes may have served for a cord tying the top to the neck of the jar. This type is characterized by the following features: a The top is flat. b The top protrudes beyond the walls of the bowl, c The walls are low; the height of the complete vessels does not exceed 4 cm. d The walls are perpendicular to the top and straight. e The rim is simple, rounded or pointed, with no special design, f The diameter of the vessel is small and usually does not exceed 10 cm. g Small holes were pierced through the protrud- ing part of the top before firing.

This very distinctive pottery type has been reported from various sites in the northern Levant: Tell Halaf (Fig. 75:A-B), Ugarit (Fig. 75:C-D), "néolithique récent" Byblos (Dunand 1973: Fig. 88) and the River Qoueiq area (Mellaart 1981: 147, Fig. 119:481-82). Three enigmatic items from Jericho may belong to this category (Fig. 75:8-10). Each has a protruding top and straight walls. They are decorated with impressed plastic bands (rope decoration) and one item is decorated with red slip underneath its top (Fig. 75:8). B6. Various shallow bowls (Munhata 1.1%). This category includes all the shallow bowls which do not fit into any of the above types. At Munhata the platter was included in this category, but here it is defined as a separate type. 120</page><page sequence="138">Fig. 75. Early Chalcolithic, Wadi Rabah Ware, lids (type B5).

Platter. This vessel type has the following characteristics: a The vessel is very shallow, its height not exceeding 5 cm. b The base is relatively wide, almost equal to the diameter of the rim. c The walls curve out diagonally, d Platters are usually decorated with red or black slip and burnished. Since at Munhata this type was included in the previous category, it does not appear in the schematic typological chart (Fig. 66) and there are no quantitative data on its frequency. However, since less than 10 platter rims were discovered, they cannot exceed 0.25% of the assemblage. Fig. 76 and Photo 59 show examples from Munhata, Nahal Bezet, 'Ein el-Jarba and Hazorea. Photo 59. Hazorea, Wadi Rabah Ware, platter with mat impression on base (Fig. 76:10). C. Chalices and Stands CI. Chalices (Munhata 2.2%). The chalices of Wadi Rabah pottery have the following features: a They are usually massive, with a sizable wall width and a diameter exceeding 20 cm. Only a few smaller items have been reported (Fig. 77: 1-3). b The lower part is composed of a hollow base of cylindrical shape or with sides widening at the bottom. c Most of the items are red-slipped and burn- ished. d In most examples the upper part of the bowl is broken and its reconstruction is uncertain, e At Jericho small chalices with a rounded perforation at the side of the base appear in both Garstang's Stratum VIII (Fig. 77:2) and Kenyon's Pottery Neolithic B (Fig. 77:3). This type was discussed by Wright (1951: 53, no. 3). Fig. 77 presents examples from 'Ein el-Jarba, Jericho, Hazorea, Munhata and Nahal Bezet. C2. Stands (Munhata 2.1%). No vessels of this type were reported from Tell Halaf, but Ugarit has produced some complete items (Fig. 78:A-C). This type displays the following features: a The body is cylindrical, long and narrow, with a diameter not exceeding 10 cm. b The rim of the base is sometimes thicker than the rest of the vessel c In some of the sherds there are clear indications of "windows" of one of two types: long narrow openings or rounded openings. Three or four such windows were apparently spread around the perimeter of the vessel, d The stands are undecorated, coarsely con- structed and roughly finished.

XLI: 6 126</page><page sequence="144">D. Pithoi Pithoi are divided into two subtypes: holemouth pithoi (Dl) and open pithoi/large deep bowls (D2). As the two tend to overlap, in some cases it is difficult to assign a sherd to a particular category. Consequently, the two subtypes have been combined for statistical purposes (13.7% of the assemblage at Munhata). Dl. Holemouth pithos. These are large storage vessel with the following characteristics: a The rim is usually thicker than the rest of the wall, and the basic type of Pottery Neolithic pithos rim continues in use. b The upper part of the walls converges and gives the vessel a holemouth form, c Special attention is paid to the finish of the vessel. The surface, at least in the upper part of the vessel, is smoothed and worked. This is one of the outstanding differences between the pithoi of the Pottery Neolithic and Early Chalcolithic; the walls of the Pottery Neolithic pithoi are left coarse and uneven, d Where handles are present, several types occur: 1 Thumb-impressed ledge handles: elongated handles with thumb-impressed decoration are placed close to the rim (Fig. 79:5-7; Photo 61). This characteristic feature of Wadi Rabah pottery is unknown from the previous period. Photo 61. Munhata (No. 1) and Abu Zureiq (No. 2, Fig. 80:3), Wadi Rabah Ware, thumb-impressed ledge handles of pithoi. 2 Lug handles: a small number were found on pithoi. In one example from Hazorea the lug is pierced (Fig. 79:4). e The holemouth pithoi can be divided into two subgroups according to their size: large (prob- ably exceeding 50 cm in diameter) and medium- sized (probably smaller than 50 cm in diameter). Fig. 79 and Photo 61 show examples from Mun- hata, Hazorea, 'Ein el-Jarba, Jericho and Abu Zureiq. D2. Open pithos/large deep bowl. Examples of open vessels with an exceptionally large diameter were discovered at Wadi Rabah sites. These vessels have the following features: a Straight or slightly closed walls, at least near the rim. b The rim has no particular design; it is square or rounded. c No bases can be definitely allotted to these vessels. As no bases with a diameter as large as that of the rim have been found, it is likely that the lower part of this vessel was sharply carinated, decreasing the diameter of the base, d Two subgroups can be identified with regard to the finish: undecorated and decorated. The decoration includes red slip and burnish, inci- sion, or a combination of the two. The decoration is found mostly on the exterior of the vessel and in some cases on the interior as well. Fig. 80 presents examples from Nahal Bezet, Neveh Yam, Abu Zureiq, Teluliyot Batash, Munhata and 'Ein el-Jarba. £. Holemouth Jars The holemouth jar is the most common vessel in the Wadi Rabah assemblage. Three different types can be distinguished: El. Decorated holemouth jar (Munhata 6.2%). This holemouth jar has the following characteristics: a The diameter of the vessel at the rim usually does not exceed 15 cm, and the maximum diameter does not appear to exceed 25 cm. b The rim is simple, rounded or pointed, c The vessel has no handles, d The vessel has a thin wall and it is carefully constructed. 127</page><page sequence="145">Fig. 80.

One item from 'Ein el-Jarba is decorated with applied plastic relief of two anthropomorphic dancing figures (Fig. 81:15; Photo 62). Fig. 81 and Photo 62 illustrate examples from Jericho, Nahal Bezet, Munhata, Tel Dan, Neveh Yam and 'Ein el-Jarba. E2. Holemouth jar with raised rim (Munhata 1.6%). This holemouth jar has the following features: a The rim of the vessel rises like a neck but usually does not exceed a height of 0.5 cm. b The rim is rounded or pointed, c The vessel is medium-sized, as are the hole- mouth jars of the previous type, d The vessel sometimes has red or black slip and is burnished.

Early Chalcolithic, Wadi Rabah Ware, various types of holemouth jar rims (Garfinkel 1992a: Fig. 29). E3. Simple holemouth jar (Munhata 30.5%). This holemouth jar is the most common vessel of the entire Wadi Rabah assemblage at Munhata. One vessel which was completely restored (Fig. 83:6) demonstrates the features of this type: a It is undecorated. b It has no handles. Only a few exceptional items have been reported, with thumb-impressed ledge handles from 'Ein el-Jarba (Fig. 83:3) and lug handles from Jericho (Fig. 83:4). c This jar type is larger than the previous types, usually larger than 20 cm in diameter at the rim. d In some sherds the interior is black and damaged, suggesting that they had been ex- posed to fire from within. e The artifacts are neatly finished and smoothed, f The rim is very carefully designed in a number of ways (Fig. 82): 1 Square rim. 2 Flat rim. 3 Thick rim widening evenly inward and out- ward. 4 Rim widening mainly inward. 5 Rim widening mainly outward. 6 Ridged rim. 7 Grooved rim; this rim is usually thick and square with a small line engraved around its perimeter. 8 Rounded rim. 9 Pointed rim. 131</page><page sequence="149">Fig. 83.

Necked Jars The necked jars may be divided into four well- defined types and a group of varia. Types Fl, F2a and F5 are medium-sized jars, usually decorated, while types F2b and F3 are larger, more massive, and usually undecorated. Fl. Bow-rim jar (Munhata 5.4%). Bow-rim jars are considered the most characteristic vessel of the Wadi Rabah assemblage. The features of this type are: a The neck and rim are bow-shaped. In some cases the neck is concave and the bow shape is carefully constructed, while in others the bow shape is less emphasized, b In many items it is obvious that the neck was made separately and then attached to the body of the vessel; the joint is discernible on the interior of the jar. c There is a sharp carination between the neck and shoulder, d The items are usually decorated with red or black slip and burnish, e The diameter of the neck does not exceed 10 cm and the walls are relatively thin, f There is great variety in the height of the neck: some necks are high, up to 5 cm, and some are low, only 2 cm in height.

Flaring-necked jar (Munhata 3.3%). This type has the following characteristics: a The straight, flaring neck widens toward the rim. b The neck creates a sharp carination with the shoulder, much like the bow-rim jar. In a few cases it is obvious that the neck was made separately and then attached to the body of the vessel; the joint is discernible on the interior of the jar. c The flaring-necked jars have been divided at Munhata into two subtypes: 1 A medium-sized vessel with a thin, pointed rim, decorated with red or black slip and burnished. The diameter of the neck does not exceed 10 cm and the walls are relatively thin (Fig. 85:1-4). 2 A larger and coarser type with a thick rim, usually undecorated (Fig. 85:5-7). Fig. 85 shows examples from Nahal Bezet, Munhata, Teluliyot Batash, Hazorea and Jericho. F3. Jar with outcurving rim (Munhata 1.1%). This type is characterized by the following features: a The neck and rim curve outward, b The neck exceeds 10 cm in height and the walls are thick. c There is a sharp carination between the neck and shoulder, d This type is usually undecorated. Fig. 86 presents examples from Abu Zureiq, Neveh Yam, Munhata, 'Ein el-Jarba, Jericho and Hazorea. F4. Various jars (Munhata 1.3%). This type includes all the jars not assigned to any of the above categories. At Munhata the type included the straight-necked jar, which is classified here separately. F5. Straight-necked jar. This vessel type has the following characteristics: a The neck is relatively low and straight, main- taining a constant diameter from base to rim. b A sharp carination is found between the neck and shoulder, c In many items it is obvious that the neck was made separately and then attached to the body of the vessel. d This type sometimes appears to be an undeve- loped bow-rim jar. At Munhata this type was included in the "various jars" category, and it therefore does not appear in the schematic typological chart (Fig. 66). In addition, there are no quantitative data on its frequency. However, fewer than 10 rims were discovered, which do not exceed 0.25% of the assemblage.

Quantitative data on this phenomenon have been presented for Munhata: while in the Yarmukian the handles constitute 2.3% of the sherd assemblage, in the Wadi Rabah assemblage they constitute only 0.3%. The small number of handles may be classified into four main types (Figs. 88, 89:9-10): a Lug handles (71.8%). These appear mainly on pithoi. b Ledge handles (14. 1 %). Some handles are found attached to a shallow, rounded, open bowl (Fig. 71). Most of the handles, however, are only present on pithoi and are of the thumb- impressed ledge type (Figs. 79-80). At 'Ein el- Jarba thumb-impressed ledge handles have been reported on various holemouth jars (Fig. 83:3; Photo 67). The thumb-impressed ledge handle is not known from the Pottery Neolithic, and is an innovation of Early Chalcolithic pottery. 138</page><page sequence="156">Photo 67. 'Ein el-Jarba, Wadi Rabah Ware, miniature holemouth jar with thumb-impressed ledge handle. c Loop handles (12%). At some sites this type of handle is extremely rare, and in others it is more common. In the assemblages of Munhata and 'Ein el-Jarba only very few such handles have been discovered. Some of the loop handles widen toward the point of merging with the vessel body (Fig. 89:9-10). Ben-Dor discussed these handles in the Jericho report: "The regular handle of the Chalcolithic period is a loop handle, flat, thin, strongly splayed at the upper and lower attachment and forming a rounded bow. Similar handles come from the Pits and from Level XVIII of Beth Shean, and a study of the specimens shows that, while the handles of Level XVIII itself are much thicker and clumsier than ours, the specimens from the Pits and from below Level XVIII gives an exact parallel to the Chalcolithic series of Jericho. This type of handle is not found in Ghassul" (Ben-Dor 1936: 87). However, in his discussion Ben-Dor has combined assemblages of both the Early and the Middle Chalcolithic. d Pierced handles (2.1%). Two distinct types are found: 1 Miniature, vertical and horizontal handles found on the shoulder of jars close to a sharp carination toward the base (Fig. 88). 2 Pierced lug handles of pithoi (see, for example, Fig. 79:4). The small number of handles is apparently the result of the fact that many vessel types which had appeared with handles in the Yarmukian appear without them in Wadi Rabah pottery: a Holemouth jars. In the Pottery Neolithic these are characterized by two lug handles close to the rim. In the Early Chalcolithic assemblage, these holemouth jars lack handles, b Bowls. Loop or pierced handles appear on almost all bowls of the Pottery Neolithic, while in the Early Chalcolithic assemblage lug handles appear on only one type of bowl (B3). c Jars. Handles are common in the Pottery Neolithic on several types of jars: miniature jars, small jars, Sha'ar Hagolan jars, Jericho IX jars, large Sha'ar Hagolan jars and various jars. In the Early Chalcolithic assemblage handles are absent from all common types of jars, apart from one item from Jericho (Fig. 84:12). d Chalices. A single handle was present on small and large chalices in the Pottery Neolithic. Handles are totally lacking on chalices of the Early Chalcolithic assemblage, e Pithoi. Most of the pithoi of the Pottery Neolithic display a series of lug handles close to the rim. This phenomenon is rare in the Early Chalcolithic assemblage and the number of handles on each pithos is also reduced. There is also evidence for pithoi entirely lacking handles. Bases The following bases were classified at Munhata. The assemblage includes 615 base fragments, divided into eight types: a Flat base (58.0%). b Disk base (19.2%). c Stand base (7.5%. d Chalice base (6.5%). e Base with mat impression (Fig. 89:11; Photos 59, 68-69) (5.2%). In the Pottery Neolithic assemblage of Munhata (Stratum 2b) 2.8% of the bases have mat impressions. In the Early Chalcolithic level this figure doubles, indicating more common use of this technique. At Munhata a few base fragments bear two straight incisions crossing one another at right angles (Garfinkel 1992a: Fig. 132:1, 3-4). This is an indication that during manufacture the vessel stood on an installation of some kind which helped the potter to turn it. f Convex base (2.3%). g Base with pebble impressions (0.7%). Examples of these are presented in Fig. 89:12-13. h Ring base (0.7%). 139</page><page sequence="157">Fig. 88. Early Chalcolithic, Wadi Rabah Ware, carinated body fragments.

Decoration At Munhata, out of the 47,320 sherds collected in Stratum 2a, 2956 (6.2%) were decorated. Since no other site has produced quantitative data on this aspect, the following frequencies are all taken from the Munhata final publication (Garfinkel 1992a: Table 17). The vessels were decorated using a number of techniques: A. Slip and burnish The most common feature of Wadi Rabah decora- tion is red or black slip. It should be noted that the percentage of slipped sherds is in fact larger than given below, because sherds bearing both slip and incision or impression were counted in the latter, less numerous group. Out of the 2956 decorated sherds, 2023 (68.4% of the decorated assemblage) have red slip, 418 (14.1%) have black slip and 114 (3.9%) have partly red and partly black slip. Most of the slipped sherds are also burnished. This decoration is evident on almost all types of vessels: bowls, chalices, pithoi, and holemouth and other jars. The slip is thick, glossy and of extremely high quality. The slip- covered vessels are carefully constructed; their sides are usually thin and smooth. These features make the finish of the vessels very impressive. B. Painting Paint is rarely found on Wadi Rabah vessels: at Munhata only 12 sherds were painted (0.4% of the decorated assemblage). The painting was executed with a thin brush and the designs include thin parallel lines or a net pattern (Fig. 89:1-2). Fine examples of painted vessels are reported from 'Ein el-Jarba (Fig. 89:3-8; Photo 70), where they are also very rare. Photo 70. 'Ein el-Jarba, Wadi Rabah Ware, painted sherds (No. 1, Fig. 89:7). C. Combed decoration This type of decoration was carried out by incising parallel lines with a comb on the body of the vessel before firing (Photos 71-72). At Munhata this group constitutes 8.3% of the decorated sherds. Seven different varieties of decoration made by this technique can be defined (Fig. 90:1-7): 1 Parallel lines in horizontal or diagonal direc- tions incised with a comb of 2-3 teeth. 2 Lines perpendicular to one another incised with a comb of 2-3 teeth. 3 Parallel zigzag lines incised with a comb of 5-6 teeth, creating a horizontal herring-bone pat- tern. 4 Parallel zigzag lines incised with a comb of 5-6 teeth, creating a vertical herring-bone pattern. 5 Lines crossing one another incised with a comb of 5-6 teeth. 6 Wavy lines incised with a comb. 7 Dense combing covering the entire sherd. 142</page><page sequence="160">Fig. 90.

Incisions This type of decoration consists of freehand incisions made with a sharp object on the body of the vessel (Photos 73-74). At Munhata this group constitutes 3.2% of the decorated sherds. Five different varieties of decoration executed with this technique can be defined (the numbering of the subgroups continues throughout): 8 Freehand incision of short lines (up to 1.5 cm) in a simple herring-bone design. The herring- bone decoration is not framed by two parallel lines as in the Pottery Neolithic. 9 Freehand incision of long lines (over 1.5 cm) in a simple herring-bone design. The herring-bone decoration is not framed by two parallel lines as in the Yarmukian vessels. 10 Freehand incision of a triple herring-bone design. 11 Freehand incision of a multiple herring-bone design. 12 Freehand incision of single lines. 13 Herring-bone incisions framed by two parallel lines. This decoration, typical of the Yarmukian pottery, appears in the Wadi Rabah assemblage of Munhata on only two items and differs from the earlier decoration in two aspects: a The incisions are very shallow and thin and appear to have been made by a knife, b The width of the decoration is twice that usually found on Yarmukian items. £. Impressions Various kinds of implements were used for impress- ing the surface of the vessel prior to firing. At Munhata this group constitutes 1% of the deco- rated sherds. Seven different varieties of decoration executed in this technique can be defined: 14 Dense puncturing made with a comb in horizontal lines. 15 Dense puncturing made with a comb in diagonal lines (Photo 75:1). 16 A combination of puncturing and incision (Photo 75:2). 17 Impressions made with a triangular or rectan- gular stylus (Photo 76:1). 18 Impressions made with a rounded stylus (Photos 76:2; 77). 19 Lunar-shaped impressions (Photo 78). 20 Rouletted impressions (Photo 79). Recent eth- nographic observations reveal further data on this technique (Soper 1985). 145</page><page sequence="163">F. Plastic decoration This type of decoration was produced by the attachment of clay strips or lumps to the outer surface of a vessel prior to its firing. This is a very rare decoration at Munhata, constituting only 0.6% of the decorated sherds. Three different varieties of decoration executed with this technique can be defined: 21 Pendants. These are small rounded or elliptical lumps of clay densely attached to the body of the vessel (Photo 80). At 'Amuq C of the northern Levant this decoration was designated as "tangs of clay applied with the finger" (Braidwood and Braidwood 1960: 148, Fig. 117:5) Photo 80. Munhata, Wadi Rabah Ware, sherd with applied decoration. 22 Figurative representations. At Munhata only two figurative representations were found, both of them of snakes (Garfinkel 1992a: Fig. 139:12- 13). A fine example is of a curled snake attached to the side of a holemouth pithos, with its head touching the rim (Photo 81). The best example Photo 81. Munhata, Wadi Rabah Ware, sherd decorated with applied snake figure. of this kind of decoration was found at 'Ein el- Jarba, on which two anthropomorphic dancing figures are portrayed (Fig. 81:15; above, Photo 62). I have recently discussed this motif else- where (Garfinkel 1998b). 23 Extremely rough texture. This feature is the result of crumbs of clay being added to the original surface. They create the impression that the original surface is eroded, though in fact the opposite is the case. This type of decoration is also reported from Jericho, where it is desig- nated "Rusticated Decoration" (Kenyon and Holland 1982: Fig. 25:8-10). 24 Strips. These are horizontal parallel strips of clay attached to the vessel body, creating ridges. It is not certain whether this decoration is intentional or whether it is a result of the manufacturing technique. G. Other decorative techniques Further examples of decorated items have been reported from Wadi Rabah sites: a Figurative incisions. A sherd incised with fish motifs has recently been discovered at Neveh Yam (Galili et al. 1996: Fig. 73). b Rope decoration. A few items decorated with thumb-impressed plastic bands have been re- ported from Jericho (Fig. 75:8-10) and Abu Zureiq (Garfinkel, in preparation b). This extremely rare decoration at Early Chalcolithic sites becomes very popular in the next phase, in Middle Chalcolithic assemblages. 4.4. DISCUSSION Vessel Shape and Function Twenty specific types of pottery vessels and three groups of varia were defined in the Wadi Rabah assemblage of Munhata. The most common types were the simple holemouth jar, type E3 (30.5%), and the pithos, type D (13.7%). These two types together constitute 44.2% of the diagnostic rim fragments counted. Somewhat less common vessels are the large deep carinated bowl, type A2 (8.7%), shallow incurving bowl, type B1 (8.4%), decorated holemouth jar, type El (6.2%), bow-rim jar, type Fl (5.4%), basin, type B4 (3.8%), flaring-necked jar, type F2 (3.3%), flaring-rim bowl, type A4 (2.8%), small deep carinated bowl, type Al (2.5%), 146</page><page sequence="164">chalice, type Cl (2.2%), and stand, type C2 (2.1%). These ten types constitute 45.4% of the diagnostic rim fragments counted. The rare vessel types, with a frequency of less than 2% each, are various deep bowls, type A5 (1.7%), holemouth jar with raised rim, type E2 (1.6%), shallow rounded open bowl, type B2 (1.3%), shallow carinated bowl, type B3 (1.3%), various jars and straight-necked jar, types F4 and F5 (1.3%), jar with outcurving rim, type F3 (1.1%), various shallow bowls and platter, types B6 and B7 (1.1%), lid, type B5 (0.6%), and spouted vessel, type A3 (0.5%). These eleven types constitute 10.5% of the diagnostic rim fragments counted. In Table 13 I have juxtaposed the frequencies of the major typological groups of the Yarmukian and Wadi Rabah assemblages at Munhata. The fre- quencies of all the basic types (small vessels, bowls, basins, chalices/stands and pithoi) are .very similar in the two assemblages. The only meaningful divergence between the two periods is found in the holemouth and necked jars. Although the two latter types together constitute 48.1% of the Yarmukian assemblage and 49.4% of the Wadi Rabah assem- blage, the proportions between them vary greatly between the stages. In the Yarmukian the necked jars constitute 47% and the holemouth jars 53%, while in the Wadi Rabah assemblage the necked jars constitute 22.5% and the holemouth jars 77.5%. Thus the use of necked jars declined in favor of the holemouth jars. Indeed, the Wadi Rabah hole- mouth jars are more varied in shape and some of them are decorated. It appears that only the simple holemouth jar (E3) was used for cooking, and it is the only holemouth jar that parallels those of the Yarmukian from the functional point of view. The frequency and character of Early Chalco- lithic vessels is generally similar to that of the Pottery Neolithic period; it appears that they represent basic household functions which did not change drastically between the periods. Other aspects of the pottery typology are: 1 Handles. At Munhata almost no handles are present in the Early Chalcolithic assemblage. Conspicuous in their absence are loop and pierced handles. On the other hand, some innovation is evident in the appearance of ledge handles and thumb-impressed ledge handles. 2 Bases. As in the Pottery Neolithic, a large variety of bases are present in the Early Chalcolithic assemblage: flat, disk, convex, stand, chalice, ring, pebble and mat. The employment of mats as a surface on which the vessel is manufactured increases at Munhata from 2.8% in the Yarmukian to 5.2% in the Wadi Rabah assemblage. 3 Decoration. Additional techniques are em- ployed in Wadi Rabah pottery both for improved color effects and for a wider variety of incised decorations. The use of burnish on red or black slip is introduced. Color and shine is controlled by an oxidizing or reducing atmo- sphere during the firing process. These testify to an advanced kiln technology. The potter of Wadi Rabah used a variety of techniques of incision such as combing, puncturing, stylus impression, roulette and plastic decoration. These are usually accompanied by slip and burnish and testify to the attention paid to the decoration of the vessels. The incised herring- bone pattern is present in Wadi Rabah pottery but it is not so closely controlled: it is not circumscribed by two parallel lines in a narrow strip, but is incised freely on the vessel body, sometimes in a double pattern.

Since no radiometric data are available from Jericho and those of Wadi Rabah sites are not very reliable, radiometric dates cannot serve as a decisive factor. Typologically, it should be noted that both assemblages have many vessels in common: deep carinated bowls, vessels with spouts, shallow incur- ving bowls, shallow carinated bowls, chalices, stands, holemouth pithoi, open pithoi, thumb- impressed ledge handles, bow-rim jars, flaring- necked jars and outcurving-rim jars (Table 14). In addition, the typical Wadi Rabah style of decoration is also evident in Jericho VHI/Pottery Neolithic B. Some Pottery Neolithic B wares are described as burnished (Kenyon and Holland 1982: 9-10, B4, B5, BIO, B14). Various types of burnished slip are described as follows: red slip and burnished (Kenyon and Holland 1982: Fig. 21:6-7, 11, 13, 15- 16); slightly polished dark red slip (Kenyon and Holland 1983: Fig. 76:10-12, 14, 16, 21, 23); polished gray self slip (Kenyon and Holland 1983: Fig. 76:19). The combed, incised and impressed decorations which are typical of Wadi Rabah pottery are found at Jericho (Photo 82). The excavation report of Stratum VIII clearly specifies: "Other forms of incised decoration are: parallel wavy lines, lattice incision, irregular round lines, short incised strokes arranged in a triangle on the upper attachment of a handle, etc. Rows of small incised circles appear at the end of the period. Crescent-shaped indentations were probably made with the thumb nail" (Ben-Dor 1936: 89). Fig. 91 presents such items from Garstang's excavations of Stratum VIII as well as from Kenyon's Pottery Neolithic B. Finally, one outstanding typological phenomen- on at Jericho must be mentioned: the deep bowl decorated with two incised parallel lines within which a herring-bone pattern is incised (Fig. 46:1-5). Since this type is typical of the Yarmukian, its existence at Jericho, in a stage parallel to Wadi Rabah, is surprising. No bowl of this shape and decoration is reported from any other Wadi Rabah site. According to my analysis above (Table 7), it is obvious that this bowl should be reassigned to Stratum IX at Jericho.

In stratified sites these stages are superimposed: Munhata 2a and 2b, Teluliyot Batash III and IV, and Jericho XI (Pottery Neolithic A) and VIII (Pottery Neolithic B). Typologically, no known assemblage can be in- serted between the two periods. Therefore, it appears that the two follow one another chronolo- gically. We may conclude on the strength of this evidence that, if the Pottery Neolithic ended ca. 5000 bee, this should also be considered the earliest date for the Early Chalcolithic. The Relationship between Wadi Rabah and Halafian Pottery Only a few specific vessel forms of the Pottery Neolithic continue into the Wadi Rabah assem- blage: holemouth jars, pithoi, chalices and basins. The rest of the types are newcomers, and two which represent typological innovations merit special mention: vessels with spouts and stands with windows. Where did the new pottery forms origi- nate? Did they result from local innovation or can influences from other regions be identified? Several scholars have noted the many typological similarities between the Wadi Rabah and Halafian cultures (Wright 1951; Kaplan 1960; Kirkbride 1971) and the relationship between the incised decoration of Wadi Rabah and other contemporary assemblages in the Levant (Kirkbride 1971). Scho- lars who overlook or dispute the similarity (Cope- land and Hours 1987; Leenders 1989: 97) probably do so because of lack of access to the material, which to date has not been published in detail. The Halafian culture should not be treated as a homogeneous, crystallized entity; regional cultures, as well as chronological stages, can be defined (Watson 1983). Typologically, Wadi Rabah pottery is closest to Halafian assemblages from sites in Syria: Tell Halaf (von Oppenheim 1943), Shams ed- Din Tannira (Gustavson-Gaube 1981) and Tell Turlu (Breniquet 1991). Table 15 is a comparison between the shapes of the new vessel types of Wadi Rabah pottery and that from three Halafian sites. It should be stressed that the similarity is typological and is evident in the shape of the vessels, while dissimilarities are often a matter of decoration. The characteristic Halafian decoration, particularly the painting, is entirely absent from Wadi Rabah vessels. On the other hand, combed, incised, 150</page><page sequence="168">Table 15.

In conclusion, the Halafian culture appears to be the dominant influence on the ceramics of Wadi Rabah, and the new vessel shapes of the Wadi Rabah assemblage have their origins in the Halafian culture of Syria. The Distribution of Wadi Rabah Pottery in the Levant On the basis of the parallels discussed above, Wadi Rabah pottery appears at the following Levantine sites: Munhata 2a, Jericho VHI/Pottery Neolithic B, 'Ein el-Jarba, Wadi Rabah, Teluliyot Batash III, Lod and Neveh Yam. At Hazorea, the stage designated by Anati as "Coastal Neolithic" (Anati 1963; Anati et al. 1973) in fact also belongs to the Wadi Rabah stage. The Wadi Rabah culture has a wide distribution in areas which had been pre- viously occupied by settlements of both the Yarmu- kian and Jericho IX. However, Wadi Rabah pottery should not be viewed as a phenomenon typical only of the southern Levant. It is also well represented in the central Levant: 1 Kirkbride's excavations at Ard Tlaili in the Baq'a area of Lebanon have been published only in a preliminary report and drawings of two vessels are presented: a bow-rim jar and a shallow incurving bowl (Kirkbride 1969: Fig. 4). These two types are very common in Munhata. In the report's photographs other items with a variety of incisions, combing and impressing can be seen (Kirkbride 1969: Pis. IV- V). The assemblage of Ard Tlaili is of special significance since it includes both Halafian sherds and typical Wadi Rabah pottery. This site, therefore, connects the Wadi Rabah and Halafian cultures chronologically. Further- more, Ard Tlaili is important because it has been radiometrically dated by a series of four samples (see section 5.2.6), which constitute the only reliable dates available from this stage in the Levant. 2 The "néolithique moyen" of Byblos contains a number of vessels and decorative types also seen in Wadi Rabah assemblages. Kirkbride has previously compared the assemblages of Ard Tlaili with "néolithique moyen" Byblos (1969; 1971). It is now possible to see how Wadi Rabah practically coincides with "néolithique moyen" Byblos, as well as the Ard Tlaili assemblage. 151</page><page sequence="169">3 In extensive surveys undertaken by Copeland in the Baq'a area of Lebanon, sherds typical of the Wadi Rabah pottery, both in decoration and in form, were collected from various sites (Cope- land and Wescombe 1966). The vessel types represented included shallow incurving small bowl (Copeland and Wescombe 1966: Fig. XLIV:31), large shallow incurving bowl (Cope- land and Wescombe 1966: Figs. XL: 1-3; XLIV:29-30), massive chalice (Copeland and Wescombe 1966: Fig. XXXVI: 3-4), holemouth and open pithos (Copeland and Wescombe 1966: Fig. XXXI:1, 9), bow-rim jar (Copeland and Wescombe 1966: Fig. XLIV:6), and flaring neck jar (Copeland and Wescombe 1966: Figs. XXXIX: 1-2; XLIV: 15-16). The decorative tech- niques include combing (Copeland and Wes- combe 1966: Figs. XXXI:8; XXXVIL5, 7-8), incisions (Copeland and Wescombe 1966: Fig. XXXVII: 10), puncturing (Copeland and Wes- combe 1966: Fig. XLI: 11) and impressions (Copeland and Wescombe 1966: Figs. XXXI:3; XXXIV: 1-9). As opposed to the Pottery Neolithic period, which is characterized by a sharp regional division within the Levant, in the Early Chalcolithic we see a high degree of uniformity over large geographical areas. The entire Levant is influenced by the Halaflan culture. This influence is evident even in the southernmost sites, such as Jericho. In light of the typological similarity between the Wadi Rabah and Halaflan cultures, and in light of the wide distribu- tion of Wadi Rabah pottery in the Levant, it should be viewed as a western variant of the Halaflan culture. It would seem appropriate to designate the Wadi Rabah culture as "Levantine Halaflan." Copeland and Hours (1987), who described the Halaflan culture and its contemporaries in northern Syria and the Levant, were apparently unaware of the relationship between the Wadi Rabah and Halafian cultures; they did not even mention the name "Wadi Rabah." 152</page><page sequence="170">CHAPTER FIVE POTTERY OF THE MIDDLE CHALCOLITHIC PERIOD 5.1. INTRODUCTION The Middle Chalcolithic period has not previously been clearly defined. The sites of this phase have been assigned to very wide-ranging periods, e.g., Late Neolithic, Early Chalcolithic, Middle Chalcolithic and Pre-Ghassulian Chalcolithic. The pottery does not fall into either the typological framework of the Early Chalcolithic (as defined in the previous chapter) or that of the Late Chalcolithic (to be defined in the next chapter). In addition to the typological characteristics of its pottery, the material culture of this phase has other striking attributes, including construction of circular silos lined with flat stones, basalt chalices and infant jar burials. I have divided Middle Chalcolithic sites into two main regions: northern (with Beth Shean Ware) and southern (with Qatifian Ware). The northern region includes sites excavated in central and northern Israel and a large number of settlements in the middle and lower Jordan Valley. The southern region is mainly located in the northern and western Negev and in the Feinan region of Jordan. The study of Middle Chalcolithic pottery has faced several difficulties over the years, as most of the excavations were limited in scope and have been only been reported in preliminary publications in which very few of the finds are presented. There have been six distinct proposals concerning the dating of finds from this period: 1 The early stratum at Abu Hamid has been interpreted as postdating the Yarmukian culture and predating the Wadi Rabah culture (Kafafi and Dollfus 1997). 2 Some of the finds from Tel Dan have been described as "a period around the beginning of the fifth millennium bee, that is, a period either preceding the Wadi Rabah culture or paralleling the earlier part of its sequence" (Gopher and Greenberg 1987: 111). 3 They are regarded as parallels to Wadi Rabah vessels (Kafafi 1987; Gopher and Gophna 1993). 4 They are regarded as an independent phase between the Wadi Rabah and the Ghassulian cultures (Garfinkel 1992a). 5 They are regarded as a northern group, contemporary with the Ghassulian and Beersheba Chalcolithic sites in the south of the region (de Contenson 1960: 20; de Miroschedji 1971: 78; Amiran 1969: 38; Gustavson-Gaube 1986). De Miroschedji (1971: 78) has proposed the term "civilisation de Far'ah." 6 It has even been proposed that finds from Stratum XVIII at Tel Beth Shean and from the foundation of Tell esh-Shunah (N) be regarded as a late Ghassulian Chalcolithic phase, preceding the Early Bronze Age (Hanbury- Tenison 1986: 115, 119). Stratigraphically speaking, in view of the results of new excavations at Asawir and Horvat 'Uza, it is clear today that the Middle Chalcolithic is a phase occurring between the Wadi Rabah (Early Chalcolithic) and Ghassulian (Late Chalcolithic) phases. This is corroborated by the stratigraphy of the relevant strata at Tel 'Ali and Meyerhofs excavations at 'Ein el-Jarba. The stratigraphy at these key sites is presented in Table 16. This resolves the lengthy debate over the dating of the Middle Chalcolithic. 5.2. BETH SHEAN WARE Vessels from 23 sites are classified as Beth Shean Ware, the northern Middle Chalcolithic group (Fig. 92). The sites and the geographical distribution of this group will be surveyed here in order of their publication. Because this phase has not yet been clearly defined in the archaeology of the southern Levant, the survey of sites is more comprehensive than that presented for other periods. 153</page><page sequence="171">~ J Kefar Gil'adij. 1J^Tel Dan y Tel Te'o «' - y • Ka bri C • Hayonim Cave J - =?

(Yarmukian) Tel Beth Shean (central Jordan Valley). At the base of Tel Beth Shean, in both Stratum XVIII and in the pits beneath it, a single pottery assemblage (about 100 items) was reported (Fitzgerald 1934; 1935). In the publication, a few pottery sherds were presented (Photo 83). I examined these sherds, most of which are stored at the Museum of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia and some in the Rockefeller Museum, Jerusalem, and reclassified them as described below (Garfinkel, in preparation a). Photo 83. Beth Shean XVIII, Beth Shean Ware, various sherds (Fitzgerald 1934). Beth Shean (central Jordan Valley). In 1964, Tsori conducted an excavation in the Roman city at the foot of Tel Beth Shean (Tsori 1977). Beneath the structure referred to as the House of Leontius were found pits containing various ceramics, flints and basalt chalices. The excavator cited parallels to these finds from Stratum XVIII at Tel Beth Shean. Tell esh-Shunah (central Jordan Valley). This site was excavated by four different missions (Garfinkel 1993e): In 1953, in the framework of an archaeological survey, de Contenson excavated a probe and exposed a stratigraphie sequence of 19 phases from different periods. At the base of the tell, the two earliest phases (19-17) constitute Stratum I. A good sampling of pottery and other finds from this stratum were published and paralleled to Stratum XVIII at Tel Beth Shean (de Contenson 1960: 12-20). In the framework of the same survey, Mellaart also excavated at the site; however, he uncovered only Early Bronze Age strata (Leonard 1992: 34-63). In 1974-75, Gustavson-Gaube conducted another excavation in an area designated Tell esh- Shunah North. After each season of excavation, a very detailed report of the excavation and pottery was published (Gustavson-Gaube 1985; 1986). The archaeological remains, some 4 m. thick, were divided into 114 levels, while the pottery was divided into three phases. The earliest pottery in the area was collected in levels 114-55, which correspond to the finds of Stratum I in de Contenson's excavation. In the 1990s, renewed excavations were con- ducted at Tell esh-Shunah North, near the excava- tion of Gustavson-Gaube. Mainly Early Bronze Age strata were uncovered, and only very limited 155</page><page sequence="173">portions of the settlement stratum at the base of the tell were excavated. Limited information, consisting of a description and a small number of drawings, has been published on the pottery from this excavation (Baird and Philip 1992: 82; Philip and Baird 1993; Baird and Philip 1994: Fig. 9). I examined some of these sherds at the British School of Archaeology in Amman. Tell Abu Habil (central Jordan Valley). In 1953, de Contenson excavated a small probe measuring 3 X 2 meters. Three strata with a uniform material culture were identified; all paralleled Stratum XVIII at Tel Beth Shean (de Contenson 1960: 31-49). The publication included a good selection of sherds. Among the surface finds from the site, a flint scraper perforated at the center, typical of the Ghassulian Chalcolithic, should be noted (de Contenson 1960: Fig. 30:3). In the framework of the same survey, Mellaart also excavated at Tell Abu Habil. The results of this excavation have only recently been published (Leonard 1992: 64-76). Mellaart identified five stratigraphie phases, which Leonard divided into two units: the lower includes three pits and the upper includes architectural remains. The entire sequence was dated by him to the Ghassulian Chalcolithic and ceramics from all phases are combined in the tables of finds. However, the pottery from the lower unit has typological characteristics of the Middle Chalcolithic, while the pottery from the upper unit has typological features of the Late (Ghassulian) Chalcolithic. Tell es-Sa6idiyeh et-Tahta (central Jordan Valley). In 1953, de Contenson excavated a probe measuring 6 square meters (de Contenson 1960: 49- 57). He noted five stratigraphie phases, uniform in terms of material culture. The finds were typologically paralleled to Tel Beth Shean Stratum XVIII. Tell el-Maijar (lower Jordan Valley). A limited probe was excavated at this site by Mellaart in 1953. The results of the excavation appear in a recently published report (Leonard 1992: 9-23). The finds are dated by Leonard to the Ghassulian Chalcolithic, but typological analysis shows that they should be regarded as Middle Chalcolithic (Garfinkel 1997). Tell el-Far6ah North (Samaria hills). This site was excavated by de Vaux during the late 1940s and 1950s. During the first excavation season, various accumulations up to 3 m. thick at the base of the tell were interpreted by the excavators as a single homogeneous stratum which they called "énéolithique moyen" (Middle Chalcolithic) (de Vaux and Steve 1947: Fig. 1). However, these finds are mixed and also include Yarmukian Ware (Fig. 37:7). For later excavation seasons, better examples of Middle Chalcolithic pottery have been published (de Vaux 1955: Fig. 4; 1961: Pl. XXXII). Further discussion of this site was presented by de Miroschedji, who proposed calling it "civilisation de Far'ah" (de Miroschedji 1971: 78). The final report of this excavation has not yet appeared, but further information appears in de Miroschedji 1993. Tel 'Ali (central Jordan Valley). This site was first excavated by Prausnitz in 1955-59. The excavation was conducted in Areas A and B. No pottery from these excavation areas was published and only verbal descriptions have appeared in print (Prausnitz 1965; 1970b). In 1959, Sussman excavated a small test section designated Area C, in which six stratigraphie phases were defined (Sussman 1990). Two new excavation areas were opened in 1989- 90 by the writer (Garfinkel 1993d): Area D in the northern part of the site, measuring 200 sq. m, and Area E to the south of it, measuring 100 sq. m. The pottery finds from Stratum lb (the stratum number- ing follows Prausnitz) fall into the Middle Chalco- lithic category. The following stratum at the site, la, is a Late (Ghassulian) Chalcolithic settlement. Pottery gathered from Stratum lb in the renewed excavation constitutes a key to constructing the typological framework presented here, including quantitative data on the various characteristics of the pottery of this period. Kabri (Western Galilee). Limited excavations were conducted next to Tel Kabri in 1957-58 (Prausnitz 1969). A sequence of three phases was encountered. The uppermost included chamber tombs lined with fieldstones, a circular silo lined with stone slabs, and basalt and limestone chalices. The chamber tombs had been damaged by plowing activity and rich grave goods were collected from the surface, including an obsidian mirror, a ram figurine and a stone jar. The excavator notes that "over the entire surface no later finds, except for a single infant jar-burial, were found" (Prausnitz 1969: 122). In view of the finds of infant jar-burials at many Middle Chalcolithic sites, it seems that the above burials also belong to that period. Findings from the two lower phases were not reported. 156</page><page sequence="174">Tuleilat el-Ghassul (lower Jordan Valley). The label "Ghassulian Chalcolithic" (Late Chalcolithic) derives from these excavations. In the excavations conducted in 1929-32 (Mallon et al. 1934; Koeppel 1940) and in 1960 (North 1961), a single cultural unit was identified at Tuleilat el-Ghassul. This verdict changed following Hennessy's excavation in 1967: a sequence of nine settlement phases is documented in his report and a sampling of ceramics is presented from each phase (Hennessy 1969). My analysis of the sherds of the 1967 season indicates two periods of settlement at the site: Middle Chalcolithic (Phases I-F) and Late Chalcolithic (Phases E-A). Additional seasons of excavation were conducted at the site from 1975 to 1978; however, these have been published only in very limited reports (Hennessy 1989). Tel Zaf (central Jordan Valley). This site was excavated at the end of the 1970s and published in a final report (Gophna and Sadeh 1989). The excavator defined two strata. The lower stratum, excavated in only a very limited area, includes some pits and only one sherd was collected here (Fig. 98:5). On the basis of this single sherd, the excavator defined the stratum as Neolithic. The upper stratum, also excavated over a limited area, included an accumulation approximately 1.5 m deep. Here, a good sample of pottery was col- lected, some decorated with bichrome painting on a white background (Tel Zaf decoration). The excavator paralleled this stratum to Pottery Neo- lithic B at Jericho and to the base strata at Tell esh- Shunah, Tell Abu Habil, and Tell es-Sa'idiyeh et-Tahta (Gophna and Sadeh 1989). In another publication, it is compared to the Wadi Rabah culture (Gopher and Gophna 1993). On the basis of typological analysis, the two strata from Tel Zaf should be included in the Middle Chalcolithic framework. From a pétrographie standpoint as well, the single sherd from Stratum 2 is not characteristic of the Pottery Neolithic (Goren 1991: 112). Kataret es-Samra (lower Jordan Valley). In 1985, Leonard conducted a limited probe of 4 square meters at the site and exposed a stratigraphie sequence which included five phases (Leonard 1989). The three upper phases were dated to the beginning of the Early Bronze Age. The two earlier phases were broadly dated by the excavator to the Chalcolithic and included a variety of sherds with Tel Zaf decoration. In the publication, which related only to the decorated pottery group, eight decorated examples are presented. No information concerning the other pottery found together with the decorated sherds was presented. Tel Qiri (Jezreel Valley). This site was investigated by Ben-Tor in 1975-77. In limited areas beneath the Iron Age remains the excavation reached earlier strata defined as Late Neolithic (Baruch 1987). A clear locus identified as Middle Chalcolithic is a circular silo lined with flat limestone slabs (Locus 1883). 'Ein el-Jarba (Jezreel Valley). In 1980 Meyerhof conducted a limited excavation near the spot where Kaplan excavated a Wadi Rabah settlement. A stratigraphie sequence of three strata was encoun- tered. The earliest stratum dates from the Early Chalcolithic and is typical of the Wadi Rabah culture. The middle stratum, dating from the Middle Chalcolithic, is characterized by a silo lined with flat stone slabs and pottery which the excavator compared to Stratum XVIII at Tel Beth Shean (Meyerhof 1982). The upper stratum was dated to the Early Bronze Age I. This is one of the first excavations in which a stratigraphie relation- ship between the Early and Middle Chalcolithic was established. Another small excavation in the area displayed a similar stratigraphie sequence (Meyer- hof 1988-89). Tel Dan (Hulah Valley). In a section excavated at the base of the tell (Gopher and Greenberg 1987), finds characteristic of the Middle Chalcolithic are presented for the upper phase, including a basalt chalice, some pottery and two infant jar-burials dug into Wadi Rabah strata. Further features of the stratigraphy of this section were treated in the previous chapter. Kefar Galim (coastal plain). In the framework of underwater surveys carried out by Galili on the Carmel coast, several underwater sites were dated on the basis of finds and radiometric dates to various phases of the Neolithic and Chalcolithic (Galili and Weinstein-Evron 1985). The site of Kefar Galim clearly belongs to the Middle Chalcolithic, as stone-lined silos, basalt chalices and pottery with applied rope decoration were found there (Galili and Weinstein-Evron 1985: PI. II). Though they do not contribute significantly to our knowledge of Middle Chalcolithic pottery, the limited data demonstrate the presence of settlement in this region. 157</page><page sequence="175">Tel Te'o (Hulah Valley). This site, excavated by Eisenberg in 1986, has a stratigraphie sequence of Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age settlement levels. Strata X-VIII should be dated to the Middle Chalcolithic. These strata include rectangular structures, stone-lined silos, basalt chalices and infant jar-burials. Though the pottery has not yet been published, on the basis of the excavator's description, the vessels are simple types: V-shaped bowls, cooking jars and high-necked (sometimes bow-shaped) jars. Applied rope decoration is present on the vessels (Eisenberg 1986: 9). Horvat 'Uza (Western Galilee): This site was excavated in rescue excavations by Ben-Tor (1966) and later by Getzov (1995). The new excavation is of particular importance, as it has revealed a clear sequence of all four phases dealt with here. Stratum 20 is characterized by Yarmukian pottery and flints and dates from the Pottery Neolithic. Stratum 19 yielded Wadi Rabah pottery and dates from the Early Chalcolithic. Strata 18-16 are characterized by Middle Chalcolithic pottery. Stratum 15 contains sherds dating from the Ghassulian (Late) Chalcolithic, though no settlement remains were found in Getzov's excavation. Hayonim Cave Terrace (Western Galilee). In Valla's excavation at the Natufian site of Hayonim Cave Terrace, various finds were defined as Late Neolithic (Khalaily et al. 1993). Truly indicative finds are few, but fall into the typological framework of the Middle Chalcolithic. A circular silo lined with flat limestone slabs was identified as Natufian (Valla et al. 1989: Pl. 1:2). However, such silos are not known during the Natufian period but are common in the Middle Chalcolithic; it is probable that the silo was dug into Natufian levels during the Middle Chalcolithic period. Tabaqat el-Buma (Wadi Ziklab, which drains into the eastern Jordan Valley). Extensive excavations were conducted at this site by Banning in the early 1990s. Several stratigraphie phases, which included rectangular structures and chamber tombs lined with stone slabs, were encountered. The finds from one tomb were published first (Banning et al. 1992). There are several stratigraphie phases at the site, but since the publication does not specify to which phase the pottery belongs, we shall relate only to the finds from one clear locus, a chamber tomb lined with stone slabs (Banning et al. 1992). A series of ten radiometric dates contributes to the site's dating (Table 24). Abu Hamid (central Jordan Valley). Major excavations were conducted at this site by Dollfus and Kafafi. During the first season of excavations, a large Ghassulian settlement was uncovered (Dollfus and Kafafi 1988; Dollfus et al. 1988). As the excavation progressed, three strata were reported at the site (Dollfus and Kafafi 1993; Kafafi and Dollfus 1997; Lovell et al. 1997). The uppermost stratum is dated to the Ghassulian Chalcolithic. The middle stratum was compared to Stratum 2a at Munhata, i.e. the Wadi Rabah culture. The lowest strata was compared to Ghrubba, i.e. the Pottery Neolithic, and was regarded as a late phase of the Yarmukian, prior to Wadi Rabah (Kafafi and Dollfus 1997). However, on the basis of the small number of published sherds, it would appear that a different dating of the sequence at Abu Hamid is in order. The two upper phases are characterized by Ghassulian-type pottery (Dollfus and Kafafi 1993: Fig. 2), while the lower phase fits the Middle Chalcolithic (Dollfus and Kafafi 1993: Fig. 1; Lovell et al. 1997). Asawir (coastal plain). Salvage excavations were conducted at this site by Yannai in 1994. A sequence of four phases ranging from the Pottery Neolithic to the Late Chalcolithic was found (Yannai 1995; 1997). The following sequence was encountered in the excavation of Area B. Stratum VII is characterized by Jericho IX (Pottery Neolithic) pottery. Stratum VI is characterized by Wadi Rabah pottery. Stratum Vb-c postdates the Wadi Rabah culture and predates the Ghassulian Chalcolithic (Middle Chalcolithic). Strata Va-IV date from the Ghassulian Chalcolithic (Late Chalcolithic). Kefar Gil'adi (Hulah Valley). This site, near the Ruwahina Spring, was excavated by Kaplan in 1957 and 1962 (Kaplan 1993c). Few data were published from the excavation, though the excavator noted the existence of three Chalcolithic strata (Strata I- III) and a Neolithic stratum (Stratum IV). In the absence of stratigraphie data, it is not possible to relate to this excavation in general. However, a complete holemouth jar from Kefar Gil'adi is presented here in the pottery figures (Fig. 105:12); it dates from the Middle Chalcolithic on the basis of its typology. 158</page><page sequence="176">The Typological Framework for Beth Shean Ware Before discussion of typology, the following characteristics of the potter's craft should be noted: 1 All of the pottery is handmade rather than wheelmade. 2 The finish is of poor quality compared to Wadi Rabah Ware, and the great variety of incised, combed, pierced and stamped decoration now becomes more limited. 3 The shiny red and black slips typical of Wadi Rabah assemblages disappear almost entirely. The few objects still decorated in this way do not reach the same technical level. 4 One outstanding group with high-quality technique and finish is that of Tel Zaf, which will be discussed below. Study of the pottery of this phase is in its infancy. Most of the excavated finds have not yet been published, and the publications do not offer a Fig. 93. Middle Chalcolithic, schematic typological chart of Beth Shean Ware. 159</page><page sequence="177">comprehensive typological array and do not include quantitative data. Only the finds from Stratum lb at Tel 'Ali offer a typological framework with quantitative data on the various vessel types (Garfinkel 1992a). The finds include 5699 sherds. Of these, 90 (1.5%) were identified as intrusive material of the Byzantine-Islamic periods; most of these were found in Area D, in which the stratum lies very close to the surface and is exposed to disturbance resulting from agricultural activity or animal burrows. The undisturbed finds comprise 5556 sherds, 192 of which are indicative (187 rims and four body sherds), 153 bases, 128 handles, 1192 decorated sherds. They comprise the basis for the statistical data presented below. In addition to the finds from Tel 'Ali, available data from other sites have been included in a single typological framework. The open vessels were divided into two classes and the closed vessels into five. Each class is divided into various vessel types. A total of 20 vessel types are presented (Fig. 93). A. Bowls Al. Cup. These are small vessels with the following characteristics: a The vessel's diameter is less than 10 cm. b The walls are straight, sometimes erect and sometimes slanted, c The proportions are high and narrow, d Some examples with handles are found, e Most of the examples are undecorated; in some cases the vessel is red slipped and burnished. Fig. 94 presents cups from Tell el-Mafjar, Tuleilat el-Ghassul, Tell esh-Shunah, Tell esh-Shunah (N), Tell el-Far'ah (N), Tel Zaf, Tel Beth Shean and Tell Abu Habil. At Tel 'Ali this type was included within the shallow bowls and consequently no quantitative data are available for this site. A2. Shallow bowl (4.2% at Tel 'Ali lb). This type includes small bowls 6-12 cm in diameter and medium-sized bowls 15-20 cm in diameter. The small bowls (Fig. 95:1-7) have the following characteristics: a The wall is rounded from the rim to the base, b The vessels are delicate with thin walls, c Various types of decoration appear: slip and burnish, painted stripes and incisions. Red or black slip and burnish continues the Wadi Rabah tradition of the Early Chalcolithic. There is a greater variety of medium-sized bowls (Fig. 95:8-14), which have straight, rounded or slightly carinated walls. Some are decorated with painted stripes and others are red-slipped. Shallow bowls from Tel 'Ali, Tell esh-Shunah (N), Tell el- Far'ah (N), Tuleilat el-Ghassul, Tell el-Mafjar, Tel Beth Shean and Tel Zaf are illustrated in Fig. 95. A3. Deep bowl (38.2% at Tel 'Ali lb). This is the most common vessel type of Beth Shean Ware. It has the following characteristics: a The bowls are medium-sized, 15-20 cm in diameter. b The height of the vessel is equal to or greater than the diameter, c The walls are straight or slightly rounded from base to rim. d In some examples the base is pushed inward, e Some bowls are undecorated; where present, the decoration may be of several types: 1 Painted: broad, horizontal stripe near the rim, sometimes with additional painting on the walls. 2 Slip and burnish: this is a continuation of the Early Chalcolithic tradition. 3 Applied rope decoration (Fig. 97; Photo 84): this feature is not known to me from Early or Late Chalcolithic bowls, and is thus a unique typological trait of the Middle Chalcolithic. Figs. 96-97 and Photo 84 show deep bowls from Tel Zaf, Tel Beth Shean, Tell Abu Habil, Tell el-Far'ah (N), Tel 'Ali, Tell esh-Shunah, Tell el-Mafjar, Tuleilat el-Ghassul, Hayonim Cave Terrace, Horvat 'Uza and Tell es-Sa'idiyeh et-Tahta.

The vessels have the following characteristics: a The body is carinated, with the carination at mid-height; the carination is not sharp as in Wadi Rabah vessels of the Early Chalcolithic. b Pierced or lug handles appear on the upper part of the vessel. c Decorated examples have red slip, painted stripes and applied rope decoration.

A body fragment of a small, closed vessel which appears to be a distinctive type was found at Tel 'Ali (below, Fig. 112:4). The vessel has the following character- istics: a The vessel is small, with a diameter of less than 7 cm. b Two miniature pierced handles are located near one another on the body; if the vessel were complete, it would have had four to six such handles. c The vessel is made of light-colored clay (Cream Ware?). I know of no parallel to this vessel from any other site. D. Small Jars Dl. Small Jar (not found at Tel 'Ali lb). This is a closed vessel with two loop handles extending from the neck to the shoulder. Handle fragments from the joint between the neck and shoulder are often adequate to identify this vessel. This basic form, which appears in the Pottery Neolithic as the Sha'ar Hagolan and Jericho IX jars, disappears almost completely from the Wadi Rabah assemblage and returns in the Middle Chalcolithic period. In Fig. 102 and Photo 86 are examples from Tabaqat el- Buma, Tel Zaf, Tell el-Far'ah (N), Tel Beth Shean and Tel Dan. Parallels are also found in the southern Qatifian Ware (below, Fig. 121:1).

In two examples, from Horvat 'Uza and Kefar Gil'adi (Fig. 105:11-12, loop or pierced handles extend to the ridge. d In terms of size, the holemouth jars may be divided into two groups: small (Fig. 103) and large (Figs. 104-105). Photo 88. Tel Dan, Beth Shean Ware, large holemouth jar (Fig. 104:1). Photo 89. Kefar Gil'adi, Beth Shean Ware, holemouth jar with applied rope decoration (Fig. 105:12). e The vessels are decorated with red stripes on the interior and exterior of the rim, and occasion- ally with stripes of drip-painting descending toward the base, f Small holemouth jars are occasionally deco- rated with red or black slip and burnish, g In several cases there is an applied rope decoration (Fig. 105). h Two loop handles sometimes appear on the body (Fig. 103:1-2, 5-7; Fig. 104:1). These are often flat loop handles which broaden consider- ably at the ends where they are attached to the body of the vessel. This is a significant innova- tion, since during the Pottery Neolithic the holemouth jars had two lug handles, while during the Early Chalcolithic period holemouth jars had no handles at all. i In rare cases, lug handles occur on holemouth jars (Fig. 103:4). Figs. 103-105 and Photos 87-89 show simple holemouth jars from Tell Abu Habil, Abu Hamid, Tell el-Mafjar, Tel Beth Shean, Tel Dan, Tuleilat el- Ghassul, Hayonim Cave Terrace, Tel Zaf, Tell el- Far'ah (N), Tell esh-Shunah (N), Tel 'Ali, Horvat 'Uza and Kefar Gil'adi. 170</page><page sequence="188">Fig. 104.

Holemouth jar with raised rim (16.2% of all vessels at Tel 'Ali lb). This type has the following features: a A vertical rim, a sort of unfinished neck, no more than 0.5 cm high, b This type has loop handles with a relatively flat section which broaden at the ends where they are attached to the body of the vessel, c At Tel 'Ali lb, most of the vessels of this type were decorated; only a small percentage was undecorated. d Decoration consists of a horizontal red stripe on the interior and exterior of the rim and additional stripes on the body, e In addition to intentional painted decoration, drip-painting marks which descend toward the base appear on the body of the vessel, f In some cases there is also applied rope decoration. Holemouth jars of this type have been reported from a variety of sites; Fig. 106 shows examples from Tel Beth Shean, Tell esh-Shunah, Tel 'Ali, Tel Zaf, Tell el-Mafjar, Tell Abu Habil and Tell esh- Shunah (N). F. Necked Jars Fl. Bag-shaped jar (10.5% at Tel 'Ali lb). This term was proposed in describing pottery from Tell esh- Shunah (N) (Baird and Philip 1994: 121). These are vessels with the following characteristics: a The vessel is medium-sized, b The neck is extremely low, less than 2 cm high, c The rim is everted. d There are two loop handles, which broaden considerably at the place where they are attached to the body of the vessel, e The decoration consists of red stripes on the interior and exterior of the rim. There are sometimes drip-painting marks descending to- ward the base, f Applied rope decoration sometimes appears, g As the neck is very low, the vessel resembles the holemouth jar with vertical rim (Fig. 106); when dealing with small rim sherds it is difficult to distinguish between the two types. Examples of this type illustrated in Fig. 107 and Photo 90 are from Tel 'Ali lb, Tell el-Mafjar, Tuleilat el-Ghassul, Tell es-Sa'idiyeh et-Tahta, Tel Zaf, Tel Beth Shean and Hayonim Cave Terrace.

A similar term was proposed in describing pottery from Tell esh-Shunah (de Contenson 1960: 17). This type has the following characteristics: a The neck diameter is not uniform: the neck widens, narrows and widens again. It may widen considerably, like a bow-rim neck, and there are cases where the diameter changes only minimally. b The rim is everted, in the opposite direction from the narrowing of the neck, c These vessels have two loop handles which broaden considerably at the place where they are attached to the body of the vessel, d Some examples are decorated with painted stripes, applied rope direction and more complex painted designs in shades of red and black (Tel Zaf decoration). Photo 91. Tel 4 Ali lb, Beth Shean Ware, swollen-necked jar (Fig. 108:1). Jars of this type presented in Fig. 108 and Photo 91 are from the following sites: Tel 'Ali, Tell esh- Shunah, Tell Abu Habil, Tell es-Sa'idiyeh et-Tahta, Tel Beth Shean and Tel Zaf. This type does not occur in the Wadi Rabah assemblage and constitutes a significant typological innovation of the Middle Chalcolithic. This neck form occurs later in the Ghassul-Beersheba assemblage as the typical neck of churns (Figs. 158-59). F3. Low-necked jar. This type has been defined on the basis of two well-preserved examples from Tell Abu Habil (Fig. 109:1-2). It has the following characteristics: a The neck is low and everted, b The shoulder is pronounced, increasing the diameter of the vessel's upper portion; this is in contrast to the narrow shoulder of the bag- shaped jar. c The jar has two loop handles located at the widest part of the vessel, d Small sherds of neck and rim are difficult to distinguish from the bag-shaped jar. F4. Straight-necked jar (2.1% at Tel 'Ali lb). This type has the following characteristics: a The neck is cylindrical and uniform in diameter, b The neck is low, not more than 2-3 cm. c The rim is pointed or rounded.

Jar with conical neck (2.1% at Tel 'Ali lb). This type has the following characteristics: a The neck narrows toward the vessel's opening, creating a conical form, b The vertical rim is simple, pointed, or rounded. Examples illustrated in Fig. 109:9-11 are from Tell es-Sa'idiyeh et-Tahta, Tell el-MaQar and Tel 'Ali. F6. Bow-rim jar (1.6% at Tel 'Ali lb). This type has the following characteristics: a The neck and rim are bow-shaped, b In most cases, the neck is attached to a narrow shoulder, without a pronounced carination between shoulder and neck, c In a complete example from Tel Qiri, two loop handles are attached to the center of the body of the vessel. Fig. 109:12-15 and Photo 92 present examples from Tell esh-Shunah (N), Tell el-Far'ah (N), Tel Zaf and Tel Qiri. Comparison with the bow-rim jars of Wadi Rabah Ware (Early Chalcolithic period) reveals the following distinctions: 1 In the Middle Chalcolithic the vessels are larger in diameter and in the thickness of the walls. 2 In the Middle Chalcolithic the jars are generally undecorated, while the bow-rim jars of Wadi Rabah are decorated with a combination of slip and burnish, incisions and impressions. 3 In the Middle Chalcolithic, the joint between the neck and the body is not visible. This seems to reflect a technological difference: the Middle Chalcolithic potter modelled the neck on the body of the vessel, while in the Wadi Rabah jars the body and the neck were modelled separately and subsequently joined. 4 In the Middle Chalcolithic the jars have handles. 5 In the Middle Chalcolithic this is a rare type, while it is very common in the Wadi Rabah assemblage.

E7. Various jars (4.2% at Tel 'Ali lb). This group consists of small sherds which could not be assigned with certainty to any of the five jar types above. G. Pithoi Gl. Pithos (0.5% at Tel 'Ali lb). This type has the following characteristics: a The vessel has a considerable diameter, over 40 cm. b The walls are especially thick, c Some examples have a low, everted rim. d Some examples have applied rope decoration, e On the bottom of a large pithos from Tell es- Sa'idiyeh et-Tahta is the impression of a straw mat, showing that the potter produced the vessel on a mat. This type continues the tradition of the holemouth pithoi which appear in the Yarmukian vessels of the central Jordan Valley (13.5% at Munhata) and Wadi Rabah vessels (13.7% at Munhata), and continue to appear in the Ghassulian Chalcolithic as well. At Tel 'Ali lb, they decrease to only 1%, apparently due to a change in storage techniques: at Middle Chalcolithic sites, silos were excavated into the ground and lined with flat stone slabs. Fig. 110 and Photo 93 present examples from Tel Beth Shean, Tell es-Sa'idiyeh et-Tahta, Tell el-MaQar and Tel Ali. Photo 93.

Handles and Bases Handles Large quantities of handles are found at all Middle Chalcolithic sites (Figs. 111-12; Photo 94). These may be classified into four types (quantitative data are based on Tel 'Ali lb, where 128 handle sherds constitute 2.3% of all sherds): 1 Loop handles which broaden considerably at the ends where they are attached to the body of the vessel (62.5%). The handle sometimes has a flat cross-section and is also known as a strap handle (Fig. 111). Applied rope decoration may be found near the handle. Such handles are extremely common at various sites and large quantities have been reported. Typologically speaking, this constitutes a clear characteristic of the Middle Chalcolithic. 181</page><page sequence="199">Fig. 111. Middle Chalcolithic, Beth Shean Ware, handles.

Some of these are large and rounded, like the typical Late Chalcolithic handles of large vessels (jars, pithoi and churns). 3 Pierced handles (13.3%). These are generally small (Fig. 112:1-7). 4 Lug handles (0.8%). At Tel 'Ali only one lug handle was found. Similar handles have been reported at other sites (Fig. 112:8-9). In several cases, thumb-impressed ledge handles were found (Fig. 112:10-12), including an example with a pair of handles applied horizontally, one above the other (Fig. 112:12). In summary, handles appear on a variety of Middle Chalcolithic vessels: cups, bowls, small closed vessels, jarlets, holemouth jars, and all other types of jars. In fact, all complete and nearly complete jars and holemouth jars have a pair of handles on the body. This stands in marked contrast to the Wadi Rabah vessels of the Early Chalcolithic, which are characterized by a particularly small number of handles. Among the handle types are loop handles with a flat section, which broaden considerably at the ends where they are attached to the body of the vessel (Fig. 1 1 1). At Tel 'Ali lb, this type constitutes 62.5% of all handles. Bases At Tel 'Ali lb, 153 identifiable base sherds, constituting 2.7% of all sherds, were found. These are divided into six types: 1 Flat base (60.5%). 2 Central-raised base (25.7%), with a center higher than the edges (Photo 95). Such bases were described in Stratum B at 'Ein el-Jarba as "very thick base, the center of which was removed before firing, producing a sort of ring base" (Meyerhof 1982: 81). This type of base probably indicates that the vessel was formed on a round pedestal which was smaller than the vessel base. The central part of the base was thus raised above the edges. Typologically, this base does not appear in the Early or Late Chalcolithic and constitutes a striking charac- teristic of the Middle Chalcolithic. 3 Disk base (10.5%). 4 Mat-impressed base (2.6%). These vessels were usually made on circular mats. 5 Ring base (0.7%). 6 Chalice base (0.7%). Photo 95. Tel 'Ali lb, Beth Shean Ware, bases. Decoration We shall first examine the decorative techniques of Beth Shean Ware as a whole and then present the Tel Zaf decoration, which has a more limited geographical distribution. At Tel 'Ali lb, 1192 decorated sherds represent 20.7% of the sherds collected in this stratum. They were classified into five groups: 1 Red slip (66.1%). The slip is in various shades of red. All sherds that are entirely covered with slip are included in this category, though clearly it cannot be determined whether a small sherd is from an entirely slipped or painted vessel. 2 Paint (27.4%). Like the slip, the paint was in various shades of red. Painted decoration generally consists of thick stripes (2-3 cm wide) around the vessel's exterior rim and sometimes the interior rim on bowls, holemouth jars and various types of jars. Drip-painted stripes descending from the rim to the body of the vessel are also included here (Fig. 113:1-2). This decoration was described at Tel 'Ali: "Splashes of paint are applied at the top of the vessel and allowed to trickle down over the whole surface to the base. Parallel lines in red, dark red, and even brown are thus formed" (Prausnitz 1975: 65). 3 Red or black slip and burnish (3.4%). In order to obtain this effect, the vessels must be fired in a kiln that enables complete control over oxidizing or reducing atmospheres, in the tradition typical of the Early Chalcolithic (Wadi Rabah). Slip and burnish appear at Tel 'Ali lb 184</page><page sequence="202">Fig. 113. Middle Chalcolithic, Beth Shean Ware, decorated sherds.

In other sites with parallels in the central Jordan Valley, burnish appears only on these vessel types. 4 Applied rope decoration (2.4%). This decora- tion was created by application of strips of clay on the vessel surface and then marking with thumb impressions (Fig. 113:3-5). This decora- tion is common in the Middle Chalcolithic and is unknown in the Wadi Rabah vessels of the Early Chalcolithic. At Byblos, applied rope decoration first appears in the "néolithique récent," which is equivalent to our Middle Chalcolithic (Dunand 1973: Pis. LXXX:26998- 99; LXXXV: 11/6; XCI). The inspiration for the applied rope decoration probably comes from the thumb-impressed ledge handles which ap- peared on Wadi Rabah pithoi (above, Fig. 79:5- 7; Photo 60). 5 Impressed and incised decoration (0.7%). Be- cause of the small number of examples in this category, we have grouped together various types of incised and impressed decoration (Fig. 113:6-11). Only a small part of the wealth of incised and impressed decorations known in Wadi Rabah vessels continues into the Middle Chalcolithic. With the conclusion of our presentation of the types of decoration utilized in the northern Middle Chalcolithic, it should be noted that thumb- impressed rims do not appear at all on these vessels. However, such rims do occur at Qatifian sites in the south of the region (Fig. 117:8-10) and in the Late Chalcolithic (Fig. 171). Tel Zaf decoration A special group of vessels decorated with painted geometric decoration (Fig. 114; Photo 96) was found at several sites in the Jordan Valley. The foci of the distribution of this phenomenon are Tel Zaf (Gophna and Sadeh 1989) and Kataret es- Samra (Leonard 1989). In addition, isolated sherds decorated in this style were found at Tell esh- Shunah (Fig. 114:13, 16-17) and at Tell Abu Habil (Fig. 114:14-15). To this group should probably be added sherds decorated with net pattern from Abu Hamid (Dollfus and Kafafi 1993: PL 111:17). Geometric decoration, sometimes of inferior quality to that of Tel Zaf, is also known at Tel Beth Shean in the Jordan Valley: a single sherd in the pits beneath Stratum XVIII at Tel Beth Shean (Fig. 114:12; Photo 97) and a single sherd from Stratum XVIII (Fitzgerald 1935: PL 111:17). Photo 96. Tel Zaf, Beth Shean Ware, painted sherds (Fig. 114). Photo 97. Beth Shean XVIII, Beth Shean Ware, painted sherd (Fig. 114:12). Tel Zaf decoration was executed in two phases: first a white wash was applied to the surface of the vessel, and then the patterns were painted in continuous horizontal bands on the upper portion of the vessel. The painting was done with a fine brush, usually only in black but sometimes also in red. At Kataret es-Samra four combinations are common (Fig. 115:B), but analysis of the types of decoration found at Tel Zaf indicates ten distinct combinations (Fig. 11 5: A): 186</page><page sequence="204">Fig. 114.

The literature contains various proposals for the dating of the Tel Zaf decoration: a It is a cultural unit that is parallel to or part of the Wadi Rabah culture (Gopher and Gophna 1993), i.e. Early Chalcolithic. b It is a cultural unit postdating the Wadi Rabah and predating the Ghassulian phases (Garfinkel 1992b; 1993b; Gophna and Sadeh 1989: 34), i.e. Middle Chalcolithic. c It dates from the Ghassulian phase, i.e. Late Chalcolithic (Leonard 1989; 1992: 69). Considerations in favor of dating the Tel Zaf decoration to the Middle Chalcolithic are: 1 Stratigraphically speaking, the sherds found at Tell esh-Shunah (N) and Tell Abu Habil relate Tel Zaf to the Middle Chalcolithic. 2 A typological analysis of the Tel Zaf sherds indicates the existence of characteristics which appear in Middle Chalcolithic pottery, while clear characteristics of Wadi Rabah do not appear in them at all (Table 17). The special decoration of the pottery of Tel Zaf and Kataret es-Samra apparently reflects a local tradition in a limited geographical area in the southern Jordan Valley. With the transition to the Ghassulian Chalcolithic, this tradition of painting continued to appear in the Jordan Valley, mainly at Tuleilat el-Ghassul (below, Fig. 170). Table 17.

QATIFIAN WARE Qatifian Ware is the least well known of all the various groups covered here. The small number of excavated sites yielding this ware and the small samples collected (at some sites only a single sherd) do not permit discussion of this ware in the same detail as, for example, Yarmukian or Wadi Rabah Wares. This situation will hopefully change in the future with the excavation and publication of new sites. The first Qatifian sherds were excavated in 1929- 30 at several small sites along Nahal Besor, but were found mixed with later finds (Macdonald 1932). Further probes were conducted in this region during the 1960s (Perrot 1962). In the early 1970s, the coastal plain sites of Herzliya (Prausnitz 1970a) and Qatif (Epstein 1984) were excavated and generally attributed to the Neolithic period. During the 1980s the findings of Macdonald's excavations were reexamined by Roshwalb (1987). Pottery that he dated to the Late Neolithic was identified from several sites: A, B, D and M. Most of the sites yielded few sherds, though 68 sherds derived from Site D. During the second half of the 1980s, Gilead conducted renewed excavations at the Nahal Besor sites (Gilead 1990; Gilead and Alon 1988) and at Qatif (Gilead 1993). He proposed the name "Qatifian culture" to define these sites. Similar finds have also been reported from the area of Feinan, southeast of the Dead Sea, at Tell Wadi Feinan (Najjar et al. 1990) and as surface finds (Goren 1990). Although Qatifian Ware was defined by the excavators as Late Neolithic, it is classified here as Middle Chalcolithic. This does not affect the absolute chronology and is mainly a semantic issue. Qatifian Ware was found at the following sites: Qatif (southern coastal plain). This single-layer site was relatively extensively excavated by two expeditions. A report presenting the ceramics, an infant jar burial and other data was published following Epstein's excavations (Epstein 1984). From Gilead's excavations, a description of the pottery was given (Gilead 1993) and a few isolated finds were presented in a single plate (Gilead 1990: Fig. 5:1-11). A total of 34 drawings of sherds has been published from both excavations. Site P14 (Nahal Besor in the northern Negev). At this single-layer site an area of 32 square meters was excavated, yielding 50 indicative sherds, including 17 rims (Gilead and Alon 1988: Table 3). The report included a description, drawings of 16 items (Gilead and Alon 1988: Fig. 11) and pétrographie analysis (Goren 1988). Site D (Nahal Besor). Although this site has been excavated by four different researchers over the years, data on the pottery are very scanty (Macdo- nald 1932; Perrot 1962; Gilead and Alon 1988; Gilead 1990: 54). The finds from Macdonald's excavation were processed and published by Rosh- walb, who identified 68 items (25% of the sherds found at the site) as Neolithic. These sherds were unearthed in several pits excavated beneath the Chalcolithic levels (Roshwalb 1987: 142). Drawings of 14 sherds appear in the publication. Gilead and Alon, who excavated Area Dl 1 at the site, presented finds which they define as the "Besor Phase." In their opinion, this phase postdates the Qatifian culture and predates the classic Ghassul-Beersheba Chalcolithic (Gilead and Alon 1988; Gilead 1990). This proposal is dealt with in the discussion at the end of this chapter. Site A (Nahal Besor). In Roshwalb's reexamina- tion of the finds from Macdonald's excavation, a single sherd classified as Neolithic was identified (Roshwalb 1987: Fig. 5.1:2). This artifact was found in Pit 5. Site B (Nahal Besor). In Roshwalb's reexamina- tion of the finds from Macdonald's excavation, two sherds classified as Neolithic were identified (Rosh- walb 1987: Fig. 5.1:7, 10). Site M (Nahal Besor). In Roshwalb's reexamina- tion of the finds from Macdonald's excavation, a single sherd classified as Neolithic was identified (Roshwalb 1987: Fig. 5.1:8). Tell Wadi Feinan (the Feinan region in Jordan). Three strata were found at this site: the uppermost was dated by the excavators to the Roman period, the middle to the Ghassulian Chalcolithic and the lowest to the Yarmukian (Najjar et al. 1990). Twenty-eight sherds of the Qatifian type from the lowest stratum were published; they should be attributed to the Middle Chalcolithic rather than the Yarmukian culture. Herzliya (coastal plain). This site contains a mixture of finds from various phases. A large pithos preserved in its entirety (Prausnitz 1970a), a button- shaped stamp seal (Garfinkel et al. 1992), and transversal arrowheads (Prausnitz et al. 1970) may be attributed to the Middle Chalcolithic period. 189</page><page sequence="207">Teluliyot Batash (Judean lowlands). Kaplan noted that in Stratum IIIH the site has certain characteristics parallel to those of Site H at Nahal Besor (Kaplan 1958b: 12). This aspect was further discussed by Goren (1990). The infant jar burial and silo lined with stone slabs found in Square B3 should apparently be attributed to this stratum. The Typological Framework for Qatifian Ware Prior to the typological discussion, the following general characteristics of Qatifian pottery should be noted: 1 The vessels were handmade rather than wheel- made. 2 No special effort was invested in the finish of the vessels, which are crude and thick-walled. They are apparently the result of domestic production rather than the work of specialized potters. 3 On several large Qatifian pithoi, handles were inserted through the walls into the body of the vessels (Fig. 120:2-3). There is no parallel to this feature in the pottery of the southern Levant in other periods; it is reminiscent of Cypriot Bronze Age production. 4 Pétrographie studies indicate that the raw materials for these vessels generally came from the immediate area of the site (Goren 1988; 1990). The potter utilized clay mixed with large amounts of straw and coarse tempering materi- al, resulting in rough, pitted vessel surfaces. These vessels were fired at very low tempera- tures. 5 Potters utilized straw mats as work surfaces, as attested by the mat-impressed bases of the vessels (Najjar et al. 1990: Pl. 11:21-23 and photograph in PI. 2:3). The available data on Qatifian Ware are quite limited: in addition to short descriptions, drawings Fig. 116. Middle Chalcolithic, schematic typological chart of Qatifian Ware. 190</page><page sequence="208">of only about a hundred items have been published. A large number of the drawn artifacts are body sherds, handles and bases. From the few rim sherds published, the ceramics would appear to include simple bowls, holemouth jars and pithoi, and jars. Typologically, I have divided the vessels into nine types (Fig. 116). Statistical data on the numbers of the various types are rarely given, and the quantitative analyses that were conducted are based on a very small sample: 17 rim sherds at Site P14 (Gilead and Alon 1988: Table 3) and 35 rims at Site D (Roshwalb 1987: Table 5.2). At Site D, all of the bowls together constitute 57.1% of all sherds. A. Bowls Al. Medium-sized bowl with slanted walls (41.1% at Site PI 4). Since complete vessels were not reported, the form of the lower parts of the vessels and their depth are unknown. Fig. 117:1-7 presents examples from Tell Wadi Feinan, Site P14, Site D and Qatif. A2. Straight-walled bowl (17.7% at Site P14). These are medium-sized bowls; at Site PI 4, they were termed basins in the Hebrew report (Gilead and Alon 1988) and bowls in the English report (Gilead 1990). Since only rim fragments were found, it is not clear if these vessels were cylindrical or if the walls curved inward toward the base. All of the examples reported thus far from Qatif and Site P14 (Fig. 117:8-11) have thumb-impressed rims. A3. Deep bowl. Large deep bowls are rare in the Qatifian repertory, reported only at Site D and Qatif (Fig. 117:12-13). The item from Qatif is decorated with broad painted stripes. A4. Basin. The basin is a low, broad vessel with thick, outward-splaying walls. Two basins were reported at Site D (Fig. 117:14-15). A5. Spouted bowl. A spout fragment (Fig. 117:11) was published from Qatif, indicating the existence of spouted vessels. Since this is a single sherd, the form of the entire vessel remains unclear. B. Holemouth Jars and Pithoi Bl. Holemouth jar (23.5% at Site P14, 42.9% at Site D). The Qatifian holemouth jar is relatively small and the mouth is approximately 10 cm in diameter. This vessel type is widespread and has been reported at Qatif, Site D and Site P14 (Fig. 118). A single example at Qatif has applied rope decoration (Fig. 118:4). B2. Holemouth pithos (no quantitative data avail- able). This vessel has the following characteristics: a The vessel is holemouth in shape. b The vessel is over 60 cm high. c The vessel's capacity is at least ten times greater than that of any other type of Qatifian vessel, d The rim is simple and of constant thickness, as opposed to the rims of Pottery Neolithic and Early Chalcolithic pithoi. e Large loop handles are located at the mid- section of the vessel. This characteristic is unique to Qatifian pithoi and is unknown in any of the Pottery Neolithic or Early Chalco- lithic (Wadi Rabah) types. It constituted the main consideration for classifying the hole- mouth pithos from Herzliya in the Qatifian Ware category, f Most examples have two handles; the Herzliya vessel has three, g The bases are particularly thick and heavy. Pithoi have been found at Qatif, Site B, Tell Wadi Feinan and Herzliya (Figs. 1 19-20; Photo 98). In the "néolithique récent" at Byblos, several examples of holemouth pithoi with large loop handles at the mid-section of the vessel have been reported (Dunand 1973: Pis. XLI:4; LXXXIX-XC). Two complete examples, from Herzliya and Tell Wadi Feinan, were found buried in pits (Fig. 119; Najjar et al. 1990: Fig. 3). Their considerable size and burial in pits indicate that the Qatifian pithoi served as silos for storing grain. Large pithoi have also been found buried in pits in the Yarmukian settlement at Munhata (Fig. 30:2) and at various Late Chalcolithic sites (Figs. 156:1; 157). 191</page><page sequence="209">Fig. 117.

Jars Cl. Jar with handles extending from neck to shoulder. One well-preserved vessel (Fig. 121:1) from Qatif has two handles extending from neck to shoulder, as in Pottery Neolithic jars (e.g. Figs. 25, 27). Similar examples also occur in Beth Shean Ware assemblages (Fig. 102). C2. Jar (1 1.8% at Site P14). This type is represented only by small sherds which include rim and neck fragments. Fig. 121:2-5 shows examples from Qatif; these would appear to be medium-sized jars. Handles and Bases Handles Qatifian Ware includes large quantities of handles. At Site PI 4, out of the 50 sherds that are statistically documented, 16 (32%) are handles (Gilead and Alon 1988: Table 3). At Site D, 20 (29.4%) of the 68 sherds are handles (Roshwalb 1987: Table 5.2). Three types of handles appear in the excavation reports: 1 Loop handle. This is the most common type in Qatifian Ware: at Site P14, 15 out of 16 reported handles were loop handles and at Site D, 13 out of 20 reported handles were loop handles. Most of the handles are vertical, but at Tell Wadi Feinan a single horizontal handle was reported (Najjar et al. 1990: Fig. 10:18). One of the handles from Tell Wadi Feinan widens considerably where it meets the body (Fig. 122:2) and is reminiscent of the handles which occur in large quantities in Beth Shean Ware (Fig. 111). 2 Lug handle. This is the second most common type occurring at Qatifian sites. At Site PI 4, of 16 handles reported, one is a lug handle. At Site D, of 20 handles reported, seven are lug handles. Lug handles were also found at Qatif (Fig. 122:6). The pithos from Herzliya which has three rows of lug handles on its upper portion (Fig. 119) is notable. 3 Pierced handle. Only a few examples of this type of handle are known (Fig. 122:1). 195</page><page sequence="213">Fig. 122. Middle Chalcolithic, Qatiflan Ware, various handles and bases.

The range of bases is illustrated in Fig. 122:7-12). 1 Flat base (Fig. 122:8, 10). 2 Disk base. Large disk bases occur on pithoi (Fig. 119; Fig. 120:3). 3 Base with mat impression. The best published example is a photograph of a base from Tell Wadi Feinan which bears the impression of a square mat (Najjar et al. 1990: Pl. 11:3). A base bearing the impression of a round mat has been reported at Qatif (Fig. 122:12). 4 Pointed base. One example of a pointed base was found at Qatif (Fig. 122:7) and interpreted as a juglet base. As juglets are unknown in this period, it is difficult to accept this interpreta- tion. Decoration The reports on Qatifian pottery emphasize the small number of decorated sherds. In two reports, a more specific treatment is provided. The description of the pottery from Qatif states that "of the thousands of sherds recovered, only fifty-six items are decorated" (Gilead 1993: 1224). At Site D, 12 decorated sherds are reported from a sample of 68 sherds (Roshwalb 1987: Table 5.2b). A summary of the data published from Qatifian sites indicates six types of decoration, which did not all occur together at any single site: 1 Red slip. Of 56 sherds reported at Qatif, 41 (73.2%) were red slipped. "The majority of the decorated items consist of rims and thin bodied sherds, mostly of bowls. Of the assemblage's characteristic vessels, seven crude fragments retained traces of paint. No decorative pattern was discerned on the painted items, and it appears that the vessels were painted inside and out" (Gilead 1993: 1224). 2 Painted stripes. An example decorated with red painted stripes was reported from Qatif. The painted pattern includes a horizontal stripe adjacent to the rim and parallel diagonal stripes extending downward toward the base (Fig. 117:13). 3 Impressed decoration. This was reported at Site D, where it constitutes 75% of decorated sherds (Table 18). These data should, however, be Table 18. Qatifian Ware, Site D: frequency of decorated types by vessel form (Roshwalb 1987: Table 5.2). Vessel type Total Impressed Engraved Impressed + engraved Bowls 5 4 1 - Holemouth jars 6 5-1 Body sherds 1 - 1 - Total 12 9 2 1 Percentage 100% 75% 16.7% 8.3% treated with caution, since the sample of decorated vessels includes only 12 sherds. No drawings or photographs of impressed sherds were published. 4 Assorted incisions. This decoration is reported at Site D, where it constituted 25% of the decorated sherds (Table 18). No drawings or photographs of incised sherds were published. 5 Rope decoration. This decoration consists of a plastic band bearing finger impressions applied to the surface of the vessel, giving the appear- ance of rope. Examples were reported at Qatif (Fig. 118:4) and Tell Wadi Feinan (Fig. 120:5- 7). At Qatif, 15 of the 56 decorated sherds (26.8%) bore this type of decoration (Gilead 1993). The appearance of rope decoration appears to be chronologically significant: at Wadi Rabah sites of the Early Chalcolithic, no rope decoration appears, and the first signifi- cant occurrence is in the northern group of Middle Chalcolithic sites (Fig. 113:3-5). Thus, the Qatifian Chalcolithic should not be attrib- uted to the Early Chalcolithic (Wadi Rabah) but to the Middle Chalcolithic. 6 Thumb-impressed rims. This decoration occurs on several vessels (Fig. 117:8-10; Fig. 120:4). Such rims were not found at all in the northern group of Middle Chalcolithic sites, but are extremely widespread in the Late Chalcolithic (Ghassul-Beersheba) as presented in Fig. 171. In conclusion, two aspects are noteworthy: a Most of the vessels are undecorated. b Where present, the decoration is simple and little attention was devoted to its execution. These features fit the general character of the Qatifian assemblage, which comprises simple vessels for basic, everyday use rather than elaborate serving vessels. 197</page><page sequence="215">5.4. DISCUSSION The phase defined here as Middle Chalcolithic has not previously been identified in the archaeology of the southern Levant as a unique cultural phase, but has generally been included in the framework of either the Late Chalcolithic (Ghassulian) or the Early Chalcolithic (Wadi Rabah). However, the stratigraphie context of the sites considered here and the typological uniqueness of their pottery can no longer be ignored. The differences between the Middle Chalcolithic and the Wadi Rabah and Ghassulian wares are unmistakable. Comparison of Middle Chalcolithic with Early Chalcolithic Pottery 1 The great variety of carinated deep or shallow bowls occurring in the Wadi Rabah Ware of the Early Chalcolithic is not a feature of the Middle Chalcolithic. 2 The shallow incurving bowl that is so common in the Wadi Rabah assemblage does not occur in the Middle Chalcolithic. 3 Three types of jars, with bow-rim, flaring and outcurving neck, are typical of Wadi Rabah pottery, while only the bow-rim type continues into the Middle Chalcolithic. 4 Swollen-necked jars, unknown in Wadi Rabah Ware, occur in the Middle Chalcolithic. 5 Holemouth jars with loop handles and grooved rim, unknown in the Wadi Rabah repertoire, occur in the Middle Chalcolithic. 6 Large holemouth pithoi with carefully executed rims and thumb-impressed ledge handles, com- mon in Wadi Rabah Ware, are almost entirely absent in the Middle Chalcolithic. 7 While very few types of jars have handles in Wadi Rabah Ware, almost all types of jars have loop handles on the body in the Middle Chalcolithic. 8 In Wadi Rabah Ware from Munhata, handles of various types constitute only 0.3% of all sherds, while at Tel Ali lb their percentage increases to 2.3%. When loop handles alone are considered, at Munhata 20 (0.04%) of a total of 46,711 sherds are loop handles, while at Tel 'Ali lb, 110 (2.0%) of 5556 sherds are loop handles. Loop handles are thus fifty times more common at Tel 'Ali lb than in the Wadi Rabah Ware from Munhata. In the publications on Stratum XVIII at Tel Beth Shean, the pits below this stratum, the House of Leontis at Beth Shean, Tell el-Far'ah (N), Tell esh-Shunah, Tell esh- Shunah (N), Tell Abu Habil, Tell es-Sa'idiyeh et-Tahta and Tel Zaf, large numbers of handles are visible in illustrations of pottery. 9 The most widespread handle in the Middle Chalcolithic is the flat loop handle which broadens considerably at the ends where it is attached to the body of the vessel. 10 In the Middle Chalcolithic the central-raised base appears. 1 1 Slip and burnish, the most common decoration on Wadi Rabah vessels (86.4% of decorated sherds at Munhata), constitute only 2.4% of the decorated Middle Chalcolithic sherds. In Wadi Rabah vessels, burnish occurs on a variety of types, while in the Middle Chalcolithic it is known on only three types of vessel: small bowls, deep bowls and small holemouth jars. 12 Decoration utilizing incision, combing, impress- ing and piercing techniques, which appear in great variety on 12.5% of the decorated sherds at Wadi Rabah, declines to 4.1% in the Middle Chalcolithic. Besides this considerable numer- ical decrease, there is also a decline in the quality and variety of these types of decoration. 13 Plastic decoration consisting of thumb- impressed bands (rope decoration), which occurs in the Middle Chalcolithic (2.4% of decorated sherds at Tel 'Ali lb), is unknown in Wadi Rabah Ware. Comparison of Middle Chalcolithic with Late Chalcolithic Pottery Is it possible to place the Middle Chalcolithic sites within the framework of the Late Chalcolithic Ghassulian and Beersheba sites? The pottery of the Late Chalcolithic is treated in the next chapter of this study and summarized in Fig. 126. When the two groups are compared, several significant features appearing in the Middle Chalcolithic which are unknown in the Late Chalcolithic become apparent: 1 Loop handles widening at their point of connection to the vessel body. 2 Jars with handles extending from neck to shoulder. 198</page><page sequence="216">3 Holemouth jars with ridge or plastic thumb- impressed decoration below the rim. 4 Bow-rim jars. 5 Swollen-necked jars (in the Ghassul-Beersheba Chalcolithic, such necks are associated with churns). 6 Red and black slip decoration with glossy burnish in the tradition of Wadi Rabah Ware. 7 Drip-painted decoration from the vessel rim toward the base. The following typological characteristics are present in the Ghassul-Beersheba Chalcolithic and entirely absent in the Beth Shean and Qatifian wares: 1 Small V-shaped bowls. 2 Small and large churns. 3 Thumb-impressed rims (as indicated above). 4 Platters. 5 Large pithoi up to 2 m high. 6 Multiple-handled jars. 7 Clay spoons. 8 Ossuaries and ossuary jars. The "Besor Phase" Following the excavation of Site Dil in Nahal Besor, Gilead and Alon (1988) proposed the existence of a cultural phase between the Qatifian (Middle) Chalcolithic and the Ghassulian (Late) Chalcolithic cultures. This unit, referred to as the "Besor Phase," was said to be characterized by two features distinct from both the Qatifian and the Ghassulian Chalcolithic: narrow and backed sickleblades (Gilead and Alon 1988: 124*) and the pétrographie composition of its pottery (Goren 1988). Closer examination of the features on which the claim for a new cultural phase is based reveals the following limitations: 1 A total of only 30 square meters was excavated in Site Dil. 2 The thickness of the archaeological layer is only 10-40 cm. 3 The finds occurred immediately below the surface and were thus exposed to erosion and animal burrowing. 4 No architectural remains, but only accumula- tions of ash and a single pit, were encountered. 5 The sherd sample is small and consists of only 182 items, of which 11 represent bowls, 16 holemouth jars and 17 jars. In the publication a single plate is presented with drawings of only 22 sherds (Gilead and Alon 1988: Fig. 12). 6 There is no stratigraphie relationship between these finds and a Qatifian or Ghassulian stratum. 7 The finds have not been radiometrically dated. 8 No similar finds have been reported from other sites. In view of these points, it is difficult to accept the proposal of an independent cultural phase which lies chronologically between the Qatifian and the Ghassulian Chalcolithic. Typologically, the pottery vessels from Site Dil are closest to Qatifian Ware; this was clearly stated by the excavators (Gilead and Alon 1988). Among the finds assigned to the "Besor Phase," a bowl with slanted walls and rope decoration stands out (Gilead and Alon 1988: Fig. 12:4). Rope decoration on bowls is unknown in Ghassulian Ware but does appear in Beth Shean Ware (Fig. 97). Therefore, at least at this stage of research, it appears that Site Dil should be regarded as part of the Qatifian entity. 199</page><page sequence="217">CHAPTER SIX POTTERY OF THE LATE CHALCOLITHIC PERIOD 6.1. INTRODUCTION Late Chalcolithic pottery was first found in Macalister's excavations at Gezer in the early 20th century (Macalister 1912: Vol. II, 136-43; Vol. Ill, Pis. CXLI; CXLIII:l-2) and in the excavation of Umm Qatafa Cave in the Judean Desert in the 1920s (Neuville and Mallon 1931). However, the excavators did not emphasize the unique nature of these finds. The Chalcolithic was defined in the wake of the excavations at Tuleilat el-Ghassul (Mallon et al. 1934); though the finds from this site were initially attributed to the Bronze Age, they were later assigned to a phase of the Chalcolithic following Albright's analysis (1932). Later land- marks in the study of the period include the discovery of burial caves in the coastal plain (Sukenik 1937), the excavation of the Beersheba sites (Perrot 1955) and the discovery of the Golan culture (Epstein 1978). Minor regional differences in the Chalcolithic pottery of the southern Levant have resulted in the development of terms like "Ghassulian culture," "Beersheba culture" and "Golan culture." The abundance of information would clearly make it possible to write a study focusing exclusively on the pottery of the period while emphasizing the characteristics peculiar to each region. From the standpoint of the present work, which deals with the development of pottery through different periods, the similarities between the Ghassulian and Beer- sheba sites appear to be greater than the differences. Therefore, only three groups of pottery are distin- guished here: the main group (Ghassulian Ware), which occurs in most of the region, and two northern groups, Golatl Ware and Hulah Ware. For the sake of convenience, the culture of the Ghassulian and Beersheba sites is termed here "Ghassulian." Since the first sites identified as Chalcolithic were discovered at Tuleilat el-Ghassul and in the area of Beersheba, a picture emerged of a culture typical of marginal areas in the south of the region and in the Jordan Valley (de Miroschedji 1971). As a result of this idea, two distinct candidates for a northern group contemporary with the southern one were suggested: 1 A unit consisting of Tel Beth Shean Stratum XVIII and the pits below it, the lowest stratum at Tell esh-Shunah, the Middle Chalcolithic at Tell el-Far'ah (N), and additional sites included here in the framework of the Middle Chalco- lithic (de Contenson 1960; Amiran 1969: 22; de Miroschedji 1971). 2 A unit consisting of the sites at which Gray Burnished Ware of the "Esdraelon Culture" was found (Hennessy 1967: 85), representing cultural overlap between the Ghassulian Chal- colithic and the beginning of the Early Bronze Age. Today, Ghassulian Chalcolithic sites are known in most parts of the region and the even distribution of settlements militates against the above approaches (Fig. 123). Below, we shall survey the main publications dealing with the pottery from this period according to geographical region. The list does not include all known sites but rather a representative sample from each region. Lower Jordan Valley We begin our survey in the region in which Tuleilat el-Ghassul is located because the culture was first defined here. The site was first excavated in the late 1920s and 1930s, and pottery from these excava- tions was published in detail (Mallon et al. 1934; Koeppel 1940). Additional ceramic finds were published from a single season of excavations conducted in 1960 (North 1961), and from the renewed excavations conducted at the site during the 1960s and 1970s (Hennessy 1969; 1989). A comprehensive discussion of the pottery typology of Tuleilat el-Ghassul was presented in the unpub- 200</page><page sequence="218">Fig. 123. Distribution of Late Chalcolithic Ghassulian sites in the southern Levant. 201</page><page sequence="219">lished doctoral dissertation by Lee (1973), a copy of which is in the library of the Institute of Archae- ology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. At el-Adeimeh, several kilometers southeast of Tuleilat el-Ghassul, Stekelis excavated a cemetery which contained some Late Chalcolithic finds (Stekelis 1935: Fig. 19). In Garstang's excavations at Jericho, typical Ghassulian Chalcolithic pottery was found in three tombs (354, 355, 356) (Garstang et al. 1935: Pl. XLIII). It thus appears, contrary to the prevailing scholarly view, that there was a settlement at Jericho during that period (Garfinkel 1999). A few finds were published from the excavation of a domestic dwelling at Fazael in the lower Jordan Valley (Porath 1985). Beersheba Valley and northern Negev sites Pottery of this region has been published from a considerable number of sites: preliminary reports from Perrot's excavations at Abu Matar and Bir Safadi (de Contenson 1956), the report from Horvat Beter (Dothan 1959a) and Stratum V at Arad (Amiran 1978). In the final reports of the pottery from Abu Matar, Wadi Zumeili and Bir Safadi, Commenge-Pellerin presented the most highly detailed discussion yet of Late Chalcolithic pottery (Commenge-Pellerin 1987; 1990). The reports include a typological survey, quantitative data, artifact drawings and photographs. The types are listed in Table 19, with the addition of a sequential number to facilitate future reference to them. In Fig. 124, the typological array described by Commenge-Pellerin is presented at a uniform scale. In Table 20, vessel frequencies at the above three sites are listed. Large-scale excavations were conducted at the village site at Shiqmim and pottery from both the village and the cemetery was published in a final report (Levy 1987). The description and typological classification of the pottery are general and include only ten types (shown here in Fig. 125); the report also includes quantitative data. Gilat is another site in the northern Negev at which large-scale excavations have been conducted; however, the pottery from this site has not yet been systematically published. The site is noteworthy for several unusual pottery finds: a zoomorphic vessel (Fig. 164:1), an anthropomorphic vessel (Fig. 165), and a special type of cylindrical jar unknown at other sites (Fig. 153). Lately, a final excavation report has appeared for the site of Gerar which includes a separate chapter on pottery. The pottery has been divided into eight main types and 23 subtypes (Gilead and Goren 1995: Table 4.2). Quantitative data are presented for the eight main types (Gilead and Goren 1995: Table 4.3). The excavators' typology and vessel frequency data are presented in Table 21. In the spring of 1997 I conducted a salvage excavation at Meitar in the northeastern Negev. The pottery assemblage here is very like that at Gerar, including a similar percentage of cornets (Garfinkel, in preparation e). Judean Lowlands Late Chalcolithic finds have been reported from Tel Gezer (Macalister 1912, Vol. II: 136-43) and Tel 'Erani (Brandl 1989: Fig. 4). In the Tel Miqne- Ekron excavations, sherds, including numerous cornet fragments, were found in later fills (T. Dothan, personal communication). Recently, Late Chalcolithic finds have come to light in the Beth Shemesh area (Dagan 1996) and at the Revadim Quarry (Gudovitch and Pipano 1998). Coastal Plain Large quantities of complete vessels are known from burial caves in the coastal plain uncovered at various locations: Hadera (Sukenik 1937), Giv'atayim (Sussman and Ben-Arieh 1966; Kaplan 1993b), Azor (Perrot and Ladiray 1980), Bene Berak (Ory 1946; Kaplan 1963), Palmahim (Gophna and Lifshitz 1980), Kissufim Road (Goren and Fabian 1993), Sha'ar Ephraim (Oren and Scheftelowitz 1998: 77-89) and others. An up- to-date list of all known Late Chalcolithic burial caves has recently been published (Brink 1998). Sites with architectural remains are extremely rare in the coastal plain and have been reported only from the vicinity of Tel Aviv (Kaplan 1954b; Kaplan and Ritter-Kaplan 1993). On the western edge of the Sharon, settlements have been reported at Mezer (Dothan 1959b) and Asawir (Yannai 1995). Judean Desert In the Judean Desert Late Chalcolithic pottery has been uncovered in numerous caves. Detailed in- formation appears in the excavation reports of the Cave of the Treasure in Nahal Mishmar (Bar-Adon 1980), and Umm Qatafa and Umm Qal'ah Caves (Perrot 1992). Additional finds are known from the 'En Gedi temple (Ussishkin 1980). 202</page><page sequence="220">Table 19.

Late Chalcolithic, Ghassulian Ware, schematic typological chart of Shiqmim pottery. Judea and Samaria Finds typical of the Ghassulian Chalcolithic were uncovered in the hill region in several excavations: Burial Cave U at Tell el-Faťah (N) (de Vaux and Steve 1957: 553-56; de Miroschedji 1993), Sataf (Gibson and Kloner 1990), Nahal Qanah Cave (Gopher and Tsuk 1996: 91-107) and a cave near Shechem (Klamer 1981). At four other sites in Samaria, Ghassulian Chalcolithic remains were recorded as surface finds (Gophna and Zuk 1990). Jezreel Valley Typical Ghassulian Chalcolithic pottery was pub- lished from Sukenik's excavations at 'Afula (Suke- nik 1948). At Megiddo, sherds belonging to cornets were found in Area BB but lack clear stratigraphie context (Loud 1948: PL 92:18-24, 30-31). Central Jordan Valley Ghassulian Chalcolithic pottery, sometimes as chance and surface finds, has been published from various sites: Beth Shean (Tsori 1967), Neveh Ur (Perrot et al. 1967), Pella (McNicoU et al. 1982: 31- 34; 1992; Hennessy et al. 1989), Teli Dalhamiya (Tsori 1967; Amiran 1977), Teli el-Handaquq (Mabry 1989), Abu Hamid (Dollfus and Kafafi 1988; Dollfus et al. 1988) and Tel 'Ali la (Garfinkel 1992b). 205</page><page sequence="223">Galilean Hills Data on Late Chalcolithic pottery in the Galilee come from a cave in the Western Galilee (Frankel and Gophna 1980) and Beth Ha'emeq (Frankel and Kempiński 1973). Sherds made of basaltic clay of the type characteristic of the Golan were found at various Galilean sites (Epstein 1992). At the periphery of the Akko Valley, Late Chalcolithic material was encountered at Horvat 'Uza (Ben-Tor 1996; Getzov 1995). Recently, a burial cave was excavated at Peqi'in which contained a variety of vessels, including previously unknown types (Gal et al. 1995; 1996; 1997). Golan Heights and Hulah Valley Pottery from the Golan Heights has been published in preliminary studies by Epstein (Epstein 1978; 1981; 1993). A detailed presentation appears in the final publication (Epstein 1998). Material from Tel Turmus (Dayan 1969) and Tel Te'o (Eisenberg 1989) in the Hulah Valley has been published. The pottery from this area is made of clays that are basalt erosion products, producing dark red vessels. Sherds of this type have also been found at several sites in the Galilee (Epstein 1992). Sinai Peninsula and Arava Valley Evidence of Late Chalcolithic settlement, including pottery, has been reported from the northern part of the Sinai peninsula (Oren and Gilead 1981) and from the vicinity of Serabit al-Khadem (Beit Arieh 1980). In Jordan, Late Chalcolithic sites have been reported at Wadi Fidan 4 in the Feinan region in the eastern part of the Arava Valley (Adams and Genz 1995). At Tell Wadi Feinan (Najjar et al. 1990), the Late Chalcolithic settlement was found above a Qatifian occupation. Radiometric datings are reported for both periods. 6.2. GHASSULIAN WARE (Photos 99-100) Before presenting a typological description, the following aspects of the potter's craft should be noted: 1 A pétrographie study was carried out on pottery from Tuleilat el-Ghassul (Edwards and Segnit 1984). Pottery assemblages from additional sites, such as Shiqmim (Goren and Gilead 1987), Gerar (Gilead and Goren 1995: 192-94) and Nahal Qanah Cave (Goren 1996), were systematically examined by Goren. It was found that the Late Chalcolithic potter selected raw materials from the immediate vicinity, within a radius of no more than one kilometer from the settlement. Two main types of paste were employed, in accordance with the type of vessel being made (Gilead and Goren 1995: 192-94): a Fine paste without grits or with grits no larger than 1 mm in diameter. This was used for the production of small, thin vessels, b Coarse paste with grits larger than 1 mm in diameter. This was used for the production of large, thick vessels. 2 Small V-shaped bowls were often produced on a tournette (slow wheel) (Commenge-Pellerin 1990: 10-13; Gilead and Goren 1995: 194; Roux and Courty 1997); wheelmarks appear as horizontal bands on the vessels. The form of the base may also provide an indication of the production method (Commenge-Pellerin 1990: 11-12). At Gerar it was reported that cornets and (rarely) other vessels were wheelmade. The necks of churns and various jars were sometimes wheelmade and then attached to the handmade body of the vessel (Gilead and Goren 1995: 194). 3 Medium-sized and large vessels were handmade. 4 During this period, string-cut marks appear on bases for the first time. These are found only on the bases of small bowls (Fig. 129:13; Photo 164) and indicate the development of a technique for separating a finished vessel from the wheel or from a larger mass of clay still on the wheel. 5 The term "Cream Ware" refers to a small group of vessels made of especially light-colored clay. The term was already applied to these vessels in Macalister's excavation at Gezer at the begin- ning of the 20th century (Macalister 1912: 137; Amiran 1955). Amiran suggested that these light wares, known mainly from the Beersheba region, were manufactured from kaolin origi- nating in the volcanic craters of the Negev (Amiran 1969: 46). However, similar light- colored wares were also found at sites far from the craters: Gezer (Macalister 1912: 137), Tuleilat el-Ghassul (Hennessy 1969: 9; Gilead and Goren 1995: 195), Nahal Qanah Cave (Gopher and Tsuk 1996: 99) and Mezer (Dothan 1959b: 23). Pétrographie studies have shown that these vessels were manufactured 206</page><page sequence="224">Photo 99. Gilat, Ghassulian Ware, various vessels. Photo 100.

At the site of Meitar in the northeastern Negev, 85 Cream Ware sherds were found. These constitute 1.1% of the sherds at the site (Garfinkel, in preparation e). The framework used here for the classification and description of the various Late Chalcolithic vessels was established in accordance with the following principles: 1 I have utilized the pattern adopted for the description of pottery from other periods considered in this work. Nine main classes have been established and divided into types. 2 Types have already been defined in a variety of prior studies. When possible, the categories established by Commenge-Pellerin have been utilized in order to facilitate comparison with data from the Beersheba sites. 3 The framework is applicable to all Ghassulian sites rather than a specific area. Fig. 126 presents all of the types, arranged by group, at a uniform scale. A. Bowls Al. Small bowl (Type 1 in Commenge-Pellerin's typology). This deep bowl with straight, everted sides is commonly referred to as "V-shaped." The bowl's diameter is no more than 14 cm. In many cases the rim is painted with a red band. The bowl was often made on a slow wheel. It is usually the most common vessel at Late Chalcolithic sites. A detailed study of this type of bowl (Roux and Courty 1997) has recently been published. Fig. 127:1-8 and Photos 101-102 present examples from Tel 'Ali, Azor, Bir Safadi, Tell el-Faťah (N), Neveh Ur, Pella, Tuleilat el-Ghassul, Gerar, Shiqmim and Abu Matar. Photo 101.

Medium-sized bowl (Type 3 in Commenge- Pellerin's typology). This is a deep, V-shaped bowl, 15-25 cm in diameter.

A3. Large bowl (Type 4 in Commenge-Pellerin's typology). This type comprises deep, V-shaped bowls, 30-40 cm in diameter. Fig. 127:12-14 presents examples from Tuleilat el-Ghassul, Ben Shemen and Bir Safadi. Some medium-sized and large bowls have additions; a In a few cases, lug handles were placed in the interior of the bowl (Fig. 128:4-6). b A carinated, loop-handle-shaped addition was occasionally attached to the inside of the base of the bowl. This is a very rare feature which has been reported at only two sites, Bir Safadi (Fig. 127:14; Photo 105) and Neveh Ur (Perrot et al 1967: Fig. 17:8). c The vessel wall was sometimes densely pierced before firing to serve as a strainer (Fig. 128:1-2). d Pairs of holes are sometimes found on opposite sides of a break (Fig. 128:3; Photo 106). These holes were drilled after firing and served to repair broken vessels, e Plastic application of a zoomorphic figure at the rim (Fig. 128:7-9) has been reported only from Tuleilat el-Ghassul.

Hemispherical bowl (Type 15 in Commenge- Pellerin's typology). Included here are usually small vessels with diameters ranging between 10 and 15 cm, no more than 20 cm high, with a holemouth profile. The vessel mouth is sometimes oval (Fig. 129:4). Some investigators have regarded these as goblets or bowls (Amiran 1969: PL 5:1-2; Gilead and Goren 1995: Fig. 4.18:1-4).

Included in this type are deep medium-sized bowls, greater in height than in diameter (Fig. 130). The sides are generally of uniform diameter or inverted in the upper portion of the vessel and not splayed as in the V-shaped bowls. Two pairs of handles were sometimes placed at mid-height. This type has primarily been reported at Jordan Valley sites. Examples from Neveh Ur, Tuleilat el-Ghassul, Nahal Qanah Cave and Pella are presented in Fig. 130 and Photos 108-109. Photo 108.

These are shallow vessels approximately 50 cm in diameter. Fig. 131 and Photo 110 show basins from Abu Matar, Nahal Mishmar Cave, Bir Safadi, Tuleilat el-Ghassul and Wadi Zumeili. In many cases, the rim is square and thumb-impressed. The basin generally lacks handles, though examples with lug (Fig. 131:3, 5) or loop (Fig. 131:4) handles have been reported. It should be noted that in the excavation reports of Shiqmim and Gerar the term "basin" is applied to other types of vessels, such as large bowls or pithoi. 215</page><page sequence="233">Fig. 130.

Tel 'Ali la, Ghassulian Ware, platter (Fig. 132:5). A8. Varia. Included in this category are small bowls with rounded or carinated (rather than V-shaped) profile (Fig. 129:6-15). Though some of the examples are open, most are closed, with the rim forming a low neck. Some examples show evidence of string-cut bases (Fig. 129:13). It has been suggested that this type represents the final phase of the Ghassulian culture (Perrot 1992: 110). B. Goblets Bl. Cornet (Type 9 in Commenge-Pellerin's typology). This vessel is also referred to as a horn- shaped goblet in the literature. The vessel has a triangular profile and pointed base and cannot stand independently (Fig. 133:1-14; Photo 112). Some of the cornets have a short base, while other bases are particularly long. The elongated base was sometimes scraped, resulting in a ribbed rather than rounded cross-section (Fig. 133:9). Some of the cornets are decorated, including examples with parallel painted stripes, red slip and sometimes more complex patterns of triangles covered with a net pattern. Rarely, cornets have four miniature pierced handles, as reported at Tuleilat el-Ghassul and Gerar (Fig. 133:2-4, 6, 8). Cornets occur principally at southern sites and have been reported in large quantities at Tuleilat el- Ghassul, 'En Gedi, Meitar and Gerar. The southernmost report of a cornet is from the Sinai peninsula (Oren and Gilead 1981: Fig. 7:17). At Gerar and Meitar, cornets constitute some 14% of all pottery vessels. At some of the Beersheba sites, including Abu Matar, Bir Safadi and Shiqmim, cornets are quite rare. Despite this, at Horvat Beter 65 cornets were reported from the excavation conducted there (Dothan 1958: Fig. 5:10-18; Rosen and Eldar 1993). In the Judean Desert, cornets have been reported at Umm Qatafa Cave, while at nearby Umm Qal'ah Cave no cornets were encountered (Perrot 1992). The factors determining the distribution of cornets are unknown. Cornets are not found at northern sites such as Tel 'Ali, Tell Dalhamiya and Abu Hamid, but have been reported at Mezer (Dothan 1959b: Fig. 7:1-5) and at Megiddo, lacking stratigraphie context (Loud 1948: PL 96:11-17).

Footed goblet (Type 8 in Commenge-Pellerin's typology). This medium-sized vessel stands on a high, slightly hollow foot (Fig. 133:15-21; Photo 113). This is a rare vessel which occurs at only a few sites: Shiqmim, el-Adeimeh, Tuleilat el-Ghassul, Abu Matar and Bir Safadi. B3. Cup. This category includes a variety of small, delicate vessels with flat bases. Fig. 133:22-28 and Photo 114 present examples from Tuleilat el- Ghassul and Gilat. A group of cups with small, flat bases which look like a cross between cornets and V-shaped bowls (Fig. 133:25; Photo 114:1-2) was found at Tuleilat el-Ghassul. C. Chalices and Stands In her discussion of the chalice during the Chalcolithic period and Early Bronze Age, Amiran raised the possibility that this vessel reflects a Mesopotamian influence on pottery- making in the southern Levant (Amiran 1992). This is not an acceptable proposal, as chalices were already known in White Ware (Fig. 5), in the phase preceding the introduction of pottery. Since then, chalices have appeared in all periods and in all pottery-making traditions: Yarmukian (Fig. 9), Jericho IX (Fig. 44), Wadi Rabah (Fig. 77) and Beth Shean (Fig. 101:1-6). No other vessel is as firmly rooted in the local tradition in the periods preceding the Ghassulian Chalcolithic. CI. Chalice. This type consists of a V-shaped bowl on a high, hollow bases without fenestration in the base. Chalices without fenestrated bases are rare at Late Chalcolithic sites. Examples from Azor and Ben Shemen are shown in Fig. 134:2-3 and Photo 115; two further examples from el-Adeimeh have been published (Stekelis 1935: Fig. 19:o, s). The chalices from Azor and Ben Shemen have lug handles located on the upper part of the base or the lower part of the bowl. A chalice with a high, solid base (Fig. 134:1) was reported from Stekelis' excavations at el-Adeimeh. Photo 115. Ben Shemen, Ghassulian Ware, chalice (Fig. 134:3). C2. Fenestrated chalice (Type 2 in Commenge- Pellerin's typology). This type consists of a V- shaped bowl on a high, hollow, fenestrated base. Fig. 134:4-11, Photos 116-17 and Fig. 170:1 below illustrate examples from Bir Safadi, 'En Gedi, Tell Dalhamiya, Abu Hamid, Giv'atayim and Azor. The base usually has three large, rectangular windows. In the Jordan Valley, items with high, narrow windows have also been reported (Dollfus et al. Fig. 134. Late Chalcolithic, Ghassulian Ware, chalices (type Cl) and fenestrated chalices (type C2).

In some examples, rope decoration surrounds the base of the bowl where it is joined to the base (Fig. 134:8-9), a feature that is also common in the Gray Burnished Ware chalices of the Early Bronze Age IA. This decoration is related to the manufacturing process of the vessel: the potter prepared the bowl and the base separately and then joined them together. The rope decoration was placed directly on the joint to strengthen the bond and conceal the joint. A particularly large number of such chalices occur in cultic contexts at 'En Gedi (Ussishkin 1980: Fig. 7:1-9) and Gilat (Alon and Levy 1990: 32), and at burial sites in the coastal plan and at Peqi'in. Few fenestrated chalices occur at dwelling sites. An unusual vessel with fenestrations in the bowl and small goblets attached to its rim (Fig. 134:12) was reported at Azor. Recently, chalices with human faces decorating the fenestrations of the base have been reported from a burial cave at Peqi'in (Gal et al. 1995; 1996; 1997; 1999:11*). C3. Fenestrated goblet. These are goblets on a hollow fenestrated base. Only isolated examples have been reported: a particularly small example from el-Adeimeh (Fig. 135:1), an example from Shiqmim defined in the report as a "fenestrated holemouth vessel" (Fig. 135:2; Photo 118) and an example from Tuleilat el-Ghassul (Fig. 135:3).

Kraters This type is difficult to divide into subtypes, as it includes a great variety of forms which differ only slightly from one another. When a complete vessel is found it is easy to define; however, excavations generally yield only small sherds which are difficult to assign to a specific type. I have divided the kraters into three distinct types and a fourth group of varia. Dl. Open krater/pithos (generally corresponds to Type 6 in Commenge-Pellerin's typology). These are large vessels of considerable diameter and depth. Examples whose maximum diameter is at the rim have been included here; the vessels shown in Fig. 136 are from Bir Safadi, Abu Hamid and Tuleilat el- Ghassul. D2. Spouted krater. This vessel is distinguished from the spouted holemouth jar (Type F2) in that the krater is broad and open, while the holemouth jar is a relatively tall, closed vessel. In most cases, these are large vessels measuring over 30 cm in diameter, though at Palmahim a single smaller example (Fig. Photo 120. Wadi Zumeili, Ghassulian Ware, spouted krater. 137:1) was reported. In a few examples, there is a strainer in the spout (Fig. 137:3); it has been suggested that this type of vessel was utilized in olive oil production (Epstein 1993). Fig. 137 and Photo 120 present vessels from Palmahim, Bir Safadi, Ben Shemen, Azor, Wadi Zumeili, Nahal Qanah Cave and Abu Hamid. D3. Closed krater /holemouth pithos (Type 7 in Commenge-Pellerin's typology). In these large vessels the walls are inverted toward the opening, producing a vessel with a holemouth profile (Fig. 138). In the 'En Gedi report, such items were called large bowls (Ussishkin 1980: Fig. 8:8-9). In many cases the rim of the closed krater is incised or thumb-impressed on the exterior (Photo 121, from Meitar). Many examples have an outward thickened rim.

Jar with multiple handles (Type 14 in Commenge-Pellerin's typology). These are small jars with a low, straight neck, sometimes carinated, usually with eight small pierced handles on the shoulder. In general the handles are alternately horizontal and vertical. Jars with multiple handles from Tuleilat el-Ghassul, Bir Safadi, Abu Matar, Tell el-Far'ah (N), Nahal Qanah Cave, Tell Dalhamiya and Neveh Ur are illustrated in Fig. 142 and Photos 126-27. At Beersheba sites, these vessels were often made of particularly light-colored clay (Cream Ware). At the northern sites of Tell Dalhamiya, Neveh Ur and Nahal Qanah Cave, such vessels were found with red slip (Fig. 142:7-8), and at Tuleilat el-Ghassul, an example painted with an elaborate design was found (Fig. 142:9).

This is a jar with a low neck, strongly everted and thus separated from the shoulder at a sharp angle. There are two variants. Medium-sized examples with sloping shoulders and elongated body are shown in Fig. 147 and Photo 134, which presents examples from Ben Shemen, Bir Safadi, Wadi Zumeili, Tuleilat el-Ghassul and Abu Matar. Large examples with high shoulders and spherical body, from Nahal Mishmar Cave, Abu Matar, Bir Safadi, Ben Shemen and Azor appear in Fig. 148, Fig. 169:10 and Photo 135.

This jar has a high cylindrical neck and a low, sharply everted rim. It appears in different shapes. Its main distribution is in the Jordan Valley; Fig. 149 and Photo 136 illustrate examples from Fazael, Neveh Ur, Nahal Mishmar Cave, Jericho, Tuleilat el-Ghassul and Abu Hamid. A single example is reported from Shiqmim (Levy 1987: Fig. 12.9). Photo 136. Tuleilat el-Ghassul, Ghassulian Ware, high- necked jar with everted rim (Fig. 149:5). G3. Various necked jars. This group includes various large necked jars which do not fit into any of the previous categories (Fig. 150; Photo 137). Most are jars with a conical neck extending to the shoulder without carination. In many cases, small handles are attached where the neck joins the shoulder (Fig. 150:2-4; Photo 137). The rim is simple, without profiling. This type is mainly reported from the Jordan Valley: Jericho, Jiftlik, Tuleilat el-Ghassul and Abu Hamid (Dollfus and Kafafi 1988: vessel on title page).

Additional items have been reported from Giv'a- tayim, Bene Berak, Palmahim and Kissufim Road. Its upper portion ends in a point, to which a plastic decoration is frequently attached (Fig. 152). A single example from the Judean Lowlands is decorated by a bird with outstretched wings created by a combination of plastic decoration, incisions and puncturing (Perrot and Ladiray 1980: Figs. 54- 57; 119; 121; Tadmor 1990: Fig. 8).

Gilat jar. This type of jar (Fig. 153; Photo 139) is known thus far only from the site of Gilat. This is a long, narrow, particularly thick-sided vessel with a pair of large handles on each side (Alon 1990; Alon and Levy 1990: 31-32). The vessel has a constant diameter throughout its length, resulting in a tubular profile. Although all the known examples are from Gilat, pétrographie examination showed that the vessels were made up to 120 kilometers from the site (Alon and Levy 1990: 32). Photo 139. Gilat, Ghassulian Ware, Gilat jar (Fig. 153:1). H. Pithoi HI. Medium-sized pithos. This type includes a variety of pithoi less than 1.5 m high. Typical pithoi of the southern sites have a particularly low, sharply everted neck creating a sharp carination at the shoulder; Fig. 154 and Photo 140 show examples from Abu Matar and Shiqmim. They have a thumb- impressed rim and painted decoration without rope decoration. The pithoi sometimes have false handles with concentric circle designs resembling human faces painted around them. Pithoi typical of the Jordan Valley have higher necks which are rounded outward and to which are applied horizontal bands of rope decoration (Fig. 155, showing vessels from Tuleilat el-Ghassul, Neveh Ur and Abu Hamid). Painted decorations sometimes also appear on these pithoi. Photo 140. Abu Matar, Ghassulian Ware, medium-sized pithos (Fig. 154:1). H2. Jordan Valley pithos. This is a particularly large pithos, up to 1 m in diameter and 2 m high. The large pithoi were buried under the floor level and thus three nearly complete examples are preserved from Tell Dalhamiya (Fig. 156:1; Photo 141), Tel Kitan (Eisenberg 1993) and Abu Hamid (Fig. 157). A somewhat smaller vessel comes from Tuleilat el- Ghassul (Fig. 156:3). In addition to the complete examples, fragments of this type were found at Pella (Fig. 156:2), Beth Shean (Tsori 1967) and Tel 'Ali (Garfinkel 1992b). The vessel is decorated with horizontal bands of applied rope decoration. Two large loop handles sometimes appear, as in vessels from Beth Shean (Tsori 1967) and Abu Hamid (Dollfus and Kafafi 1988) and the example from Tel 'Ali. The very large examples are known only in the central Jordan Valley; they are the largest vessels made in any period in the southern Levant. In the careful excavation of such a vessel at Abu Hamid, during which a detailed section was documented, the vessel appeared to have been buried beneath floor level in a large pit (Fig. 157). Above the vessel opening, a circular wall some half meter high, of the same diameter as the opening, was constructed of bricks. This created a storage facility with a capacity of approximately 2 cubic meters which could preserve a quantity of grain sufficient for a single family for an entire year. The excellent preservation of the pithoi is due to their having been used as underground installations. 249</page><page sequence="267">Fig. 154.

Churns The churn is one of the most unusual vessels in the pottery of the southern Levant, differing in shape from vessels found in any other period. It appar- ently imitates an animal-skin container used for churning milk (Kaplan 1954a; 1965). Churns of various sizes are known: large (Fig. 158:1-2), medium-sized (Fig. 158:3-7), small (Fig. 160) and miniature (Tadmor 1990). Miniature churns are also sometimes incorporated in anthropomorphic or zoomorphic vessels (Fig. 164:3; Fig. 165). These examples indicate that the churn had a special function in the mythology and cult of the people of the Late Chalcolithic period. Churn fragments have been discovered as far south as the Sinai peninsula (Fig. 158:7). In the north, churns have been discovered at Tel Te'o in the Hulah Valley (below, Fig. 184:5-6). At Byblos, one item may be a churn (Dunand 1973: Fig. 170:32258); though it is drawn as a symmetrical vessel, the handle on the recon- structed side should be located at the end rather than on the shoulder. A small variant of the churn continues into the Early Bronze Age I (Amiran 1977: Fig. 6; 1985), but lies beyond the scope of this presentation. I have divided the churns into four types: II. Large churn (Type 16 in Commenge-Pellerin's typology). The vessel has a horizontal, barrel- shaped body of which one end is straight and the other rounded. From the center of the body protrudes a bow-shaped or swollen neck. A large handle is located on each side of the vessel: the handle near the straight side is on the shoulder, while the handle on the rounded end is affixed to the side of the vessel. The handles are very large, with a round profile, and are thus easily identified. The average churn is approximately 60 cm long. Fig. 158 and Photos 142-43 illustrate large churns from Abu Matar, Bir Safadi, Tuleilat el-Ghassul, Tel 'Ali and Site A-301 in Sinai. Photo 142. Abu Matar, Ghassulian Ware, large churn (Fig. 158:2).

In these churns the neck is larger than other parts of the vessel. This type has been designated "barrel-shaped necked churn" at Gerar (Gilead and Goren 1995). Kaplan reported Fig. 158.

Tel Aviv, Ghassulian Ware, churn with gigantic neck (Fig. 159:2). 13. Small churn (Type 17 in Commenge-Pellerin's typology). These are vessels no larger than 20-30 cm, a smaller version of the large churn. Fig. 160:1- 7 and Photos 145-47 present small churns from Azor, Horvat Beter, Gerar, Abu Matar, 'Afula, Tell Dalhamiya and Hadera. Of the two complete vessels found at Azor, one had lug handles (Fig. 160:1) and the second loop handles (Fig. 160:5). Small churns with double handles were found in the Jordan Valley in excavations at Tel 'Ali and at Tell Dalhamiya (Fig. 160:7). In some small churns, a strainer is located at the base of the neck (Fig. 160:1, 5-6; Photos 145^46; and, from Nahal Qanah Cave, Photo 145. Azor, Ghassulian Ware, small churn with strainer in neck (Fig. 160:6). Gopher and Tsuk 1996: Fig. 4.5:1). In view of the location of the strainer, it appears that its function was to prevent the entry of larger pieces into the vessel, rather than to strain a mixture being poured from the vessel. This is the vessel that at Tuleilat el- Ghassul was termed "bird-shaped vessel" ( vase en forme ď oiseau). I have also seen some unpublished small churns with a large ring base from three other sites. Photo 146. 'Afula, Ghassulian Ware, small churn with strainer in neck (Fig. 160:5). Photo 147.

This vessel, a small churn with a flat base and straight, sharply angled sides, may be regarded as a combination of two parts: a lower portion like a medium-sized Y-shaped bowl and an upper portion resembling an ordinary churn, including two handles and a neck. Several such items were found at Tuleilat el-Ghassul (Fig. 160:8-10; Photo 148). 257</page><page sequence="275">Fig. 160. Late Chalcolithic, Ghassulian Ware, small churns (types 13-4).

Lid. Two types of lids are known at Late Chalcolithic sites. One is in the form of a straight- sided shallow bowl with a handle attached to its exterior. Several such objects are known from Tuleilat el-Ghassul (Fig. 162:1; Photo 150) and several lids for large jars have recently been found in the Peqi'in Cave (Gal et al. 1996: 22). The second type are large clay stoppers utilized to seal jars (Fig. 162:2-4). These consist of large lumps of unfired clay which were stuck into jar openings. Applied rope decoration on some jars imitates the cordage utilized to fasten the lids to the jars, providing further evidence for the use of lids and the sealing of storage vessels during this period (Tadmor 1992). Photo 150. Tuleilat el-Ghassul, Ghassulian Ware, lid (Fig. 162:1). J3. Gutter (Type 19 in Commenge-Pellerin's typo- logy). Elongated objects with an elliptical profile were found at Bir Safadi and Abu Matar (Fig. 163). In the publications these were defined as gutters for draining water from house roofs.

Very few such examples have been found: a ram carrying cornets from Gilat (Fig. 164:2; Photo 153), a bull carrying churns from 'En Gedi (Fig. 164:3; Photo 151), a bull-shaped vessel from Abu Hamid (Fig. 164:1) and two bird-shaped vessels from Palmahim (Fig. 164:4; Photo 152). The laden animals provide the earliest known evidence for the use of beasts of burden (Epstein 1985). Photo 152. Palmahim, Ghassulian Ware, zoomorphic vessel in the shape of a bird. Photo 153.

Anthropomorphic vessel. The single example of this type was found in the vicinity of the cultic area at Gilat (Alon 1976). It is in the form of a woman seated on a pedestal and holding a churn on her head (Fig. 165; Photo 154). It should be noted that the churn is hollow and was joined to the female figure, as may be observed in the photograph taken before the vessel underwent restoration of missing pieces with plaster. Much has been written on the iconography of this unique vessel (Alon 1976; Amiran 1976; 1989; Tadmor 1986; Fox 1995). Anthropomorphic and zoomorphic vessels are quite rare and are reported only from a very small number of Pottery Neolithic and Chalcolithic sites. However, in cases in which such vessels have come to light, they have often been found together at the same site, for example, Hacilar (Mellaart 1970: Pis. LX-LXI, CLXXVI), Yerim Tepe II (Merpert et al. 1981) and Gilat (Alon 1976). While such vessels have been reported from Anatolia and Mesopota- mia as early as the 6th and 5th millennia bee, in the southern Levant they are dated to the 4th millen- nium bee onward. This is probably due only to chance and the situation may change in the future. Fig. 165. Late Chalcolithic, Ghassulian Ware, anthropomorphic vessels (type J 5). Photo 154.

Fig. 166 and Photos 155-60 present examples from Ben Shemen, Azor, Giv'atayim, Hadera, Peqi'in and Bene Berak. Most items are large, over 60 cm long (see, for example, Fig. 166:1; Photo 155). There are also very small examples which could not have been used for burial (Fig. 166:2-3; Photo 160). The study of Perrot and Ladiray (1980) is the most comprehensive publication dealing with these ob- jects and includes a detailed discussion of their typology. Examples of ossuaries from this study are presented in Fig. 167 in both frontal view and section, indicating their box-like structure. A large number of ossuaries depict a human face above the opening: the depiction is sometimes very schematic, showing only a nose (Photo 157), while sometimes nose and eyes are shown (Photo 158). A recently found example from Peqi'in has a complete, naturalistic sculpted face (Photo 159). Some ossu- aries display gender characteristics: breasts for females (Perrot and Ladiray 1980: Figs. 36-37; Gal et al. 1996: 21) and beards for males (Gal et al. 1996: 21). Square or roughly rectangular lids, which may have painted or plastic decoration, were fitted to the openings of the ossuaries (Fig. 168; Photo 156). A pierced handle or small holes, which had apparently served to fasten the lid to the ossuary, sometimes occur on the lids. Small pierced handles for holding the lid were affixed to each side of the opening of the ossuary. Ossuaries have been found in burial caves in the coastal plain at Hadera (Sukenik 1937), Giv'atayim (Sussman and Ben-Arieh 1966), Bene Berak (Ory 1946; Kaplan 1963), Azor (Perrot and Ladiray 1980), Palmahim (Gophna and Lifshitz 1980) and Kissufim Road (Goren and Fabian 1993). Concen- trations of ossuaries have also been reported from the Judean Lowlands and the hill regions: Ben Shemen (Perrot and Ladiray 1980), an ossuary lid from Gezer (Macalister 1912: Vol. III, PI.

In the excavation of Tuleilat el-Ghassul a miniature, closed vessel was found which resembles a juglet (Photo 161); it has an elongated body, rounded base and two handles (Koeppel 1940: PL 77:6). Photo 161. Tuleilat el-Ghassul, Ghassulian Ware, minia- ture vessel. 268</page><page sequence="286">Handles, Bases and Strainers Handles Handles are common in the Late Chalcolithic and occur on a variety of vessel types (Fig. 169). Multiple handles are often placed around the body of a vessel: four (Figs. 140:6, 143:1), six (Fig. 140:2) and eight (Fig. 142). Generally, when four handles are placed on a vessel, they are arranged in pairs, each pair on opposite sides of the vessel. The handles are incorporated into the vessel's decora- tion but they probably had a practical function related to securing strings or ropes when the vessel opening was covered with pieces of cloth or leather (Tadmor 1992). Several types of handle occur: 1 Small pierced handles. These handles occur on various types of vessels: cornets, deep bowls and multiple-handled jars. 2 Large pierced handles (Photo 162). These handles, which have a triangular profile and triangular cross-section, occur on large jars and pithoi. They are sometimes thumb-impressed, producing a jagged edge when viewed in profile (Fig. 169:3-4, 12). Photo 162. Bir Safadi, Ghassulian Ware, pierced and thumb-impressed handle. 3 Combined large and small pierced handle. A small pierced handle is sometimes attached to a large pierced or loop handle (Fig. 169:9-11). A published example comes from Tuleilat el- Ghassul, in which two small pierced handles are affixed above and below a large central handle (Malion et al. 1934: Pl. 40:2). This type is common in Golan Ware, where it is known as the "Eye and Nose handle," and in Hulah Ware (Fig. 169:10-11). 4 False pierced handle. In several cases, a handle with the appearance of a pierced handle is in fact unpierced: there are two small depressions on opposite sides of the handle which do not perforate it. The result resembles a ledge handle (Fig. 169:5-6). 5 Loop handle. Simple loop handles, common in all of the other periods, are relatively rare in Late Chalcolithic contexts. 6 Churn handle. Churn handles are easily identi- fied by their particularly large dimensions and circular section. It is possible to differentiate between a handle from the flat side of the churn (Fig. 158:3-4) and one from the rounded side (Fig. 158:5). 7 Lug handle. During the Late Chalcolithic period, lug handles (Fig. 168:7-8) are quite rare. They appear on chalices with unfenestrated bases (Fig. 134:2-3), small and large holemouth jars (Figs. 144:2, 146:2) and as internal protru- sions in large bowls (Fig. 128:3-7). 8 Basket handle. This is the term used for handles extending above the vessel rim from one side to the other. Such handles are extremely rare and have been reported from Kissufim Road (Goren and Fabian 1993: front cover) and as a surface find (Amiran 1986). Basket handles are found on a few copper vessels from the Nahal Mishmar hoard (Bar-Adon 1980: 109). 9 Ledge handle. These have been described in some reports (Perrot and Ladiray 1980: Figs. 75:1-7; 129:8-9; Oren and Gilead 1981: Fig. 6:8). However, the absence of such handles at nearly all Late Chalcolithic sites may indicate that the above-mentioned items come from problematic stratigraphie contexts. At this stage, caution precludes inclusion of ledge handles in the Ghassulian assemblage. This survey of handle types does not present quantitative data because such data are generally not given in excavation reports. Among the 45 handles found at Tel 'Ali la, loop handles con- stituted 73.3% and pierced handles 26.6%. These proportions are quite different from those from Gerar, where most of the handles were reported to have been pierced handles (Gilead and Goren 1995: 186). Quantitative data on handles are also avail- able from Meitar in the northeastern Negev (Garfinkel, in preparation e). Of 7848 sherds found here, 175 were handles (2.23%). These were divided into three types: loop handles, mainly found on 269</page><page sequence="287">Fig. 169. Late Chalcolithic, handles.

During the Late Chalcolithic period there is a complete absence of loop handles which broaden at the point of their attachment to the body, the characteristic handle of the Middle Chalcolithic period (Fig. 111). Bases Few descriptions or classifications of different types of bases of this period appear in excavation reports. At Tel 'Ali la, 65 bases were found, constituting 1.8% of all sherds. These bases are divided into five types: flat (70.8%), disk (12.3%), concave (12.3%), ring (3.1%) and chalice (1.5%). Quantitative data on bases are also available from Meitar (Garfinkel, in preparation e). Of 7848 sherds, 217 are bases (2.8%). These are subdivided into the following types: flat (70.5%), cornet (15.7%), disk (6.5%), ring (3.7%), concave (3.2%) and chalice (0.5%). Mat impressions are found on 4.4% of the bases. Excavation reports emphasize the fact that circular or rectangular mat impressions were found on some of the bases (Koeppel 1940: Pis. 83-84; Gilead and Goren 1995: Fig. 4.20:8-9). Such Photo 163. Tuleilat el-Ghassul, Ghassulian Ware, bases with various mat impressions. impressions are known as early as the Pottery Neolithic in Yarmukian vessels and do not repre- sent a Late Chalcolithic innovation. Nevertheless, they become much more common during this period. Photo 163 presents a variety of mat impressions from the site of Tuleilat el-Ghassul. String-cut marks on bases appear in this period for the first time (Photo 164, from Abu Matar). They have been reported at various sites, such as Gerar (Gilead and Goren 1995: Figs. 4.1:13-14; 4.2:1, 3). Photo 165 shows a ring base from Abu Matar. Photo 164.

Strainers Strainers occur in a number of vessel types in Ghassulian Ware: V-shaped bowls (perforated before firing) (Fig. 128:1-2), spouted bowls (Fig. 137:3), bottles (Fig. 143:6), spouted holemouth jars (Fig. 145:3; Photo 132) and small churns (Fig. 160:1, 5-6; Photos 145-46). A particularly wide variety of strainers appears at Tuleilat el-Ghassul (Lee 1973: Fig. C.84). 271</page><page sequence="289">Decoration A variety of decorative techniques appear in Ghassulian Ware: 1 A painted red stripe near the rim. V-shaped bowls are commonly decorated with a stripe of red paint on the exterior (and sometimes also on the interior) of the rim (above, Photo 101). 2 Painted geometric patterns. More elaborate painted decoration sometimes occurs on small bowls, hemispherical bowls, cornets, fenestrated goblets and pithos handles. At Tuleilat el- Ghassul and Jordan Valley sites, there is a painted decoration consisting of triangles with net pattern (Fig. 170), similar to the Tel Zaf decoration of the Middle Chalcolithic (Fig. 115). 3 White wash (Photo 166). Light-colored wash usually appears on the upper part of the vessel. It sometimes occurs as horizontal bands on bowls (above, Photo 103). At Tuleilat el- Ghassul, where it is quite common, it has been described as follows: "Streaky-Wash ware ... the application of a very thin creamy white wash brushed on to the upper body of the pot and then wiped to reserve horizontal bands of the body surface ... Occasionally, bands of red paint were applied over the wash" (Hennessy 1969: 7). Photo 166. Tuleilat el-Ghassul, Ghassulian Ware, sherds decorated with white wash bands. 4 Applied rope decoration (Photo 167:1). This decoration consists of the application of bands of clay to the vessel surface which are then thumb-impressed; the result resembles rope. The applied bands are sometimes designed in the form of a snake (Photo 167:2). Rope decoration occurs as horizontal bands on large pithoi in the central and lower Jordan Valley. Sometimes, there is a more sophisticated ar- rangement on the jars and the rope decoration is applied in relation to the vessel's handles (Fig. Fig. 170. Late Chalcolithic, Ghassulian Ware, painted patterns from Tuleilat el-Ghassul (de Miroschedji 1971). 272</page><page sequence="290">150:4), apparently imitating real ropes attached to the vessels (Tadmor 1992). Amiran proposed that the potters fastened ropes to the vessels in the course of production and for transporting them and that these were transformed into decorative motifs on the vessels (Amiran 1969: 25). Photo 167. Tuleilat el-Ghassul, Ghassulian Ware, sherds with various applied plastic decorations. 5 Incised rope decoration (Photos 168-69). Unlike the applied rope decoration of the previous category, this decoration was impressed or incised directly onto the vessel's surface (Figs. 149:5, 150:3-4). 6 Incised and thumb-impressed rims (above, Photo 121). This type of decoration appears on various types of vessels, chalices, bowls, kraters and pithoi, as summarized in Fig. 171. Photo 168. Meitar, Ghassulian Ware, impressed rope decoration. Photo 169. Tuleilat el-Ghassul, Ghassulian Ware, im- pressed rope decoration. 7 Other incised decoration (Photo 170). These are incisions applied to the body of the vessel before firing, utilizing thin, sharp tools. A variety of patterns exists, but all are very rare (Fig. 172). Of particular interest are a few items with triangles near the rim, imitating contemporary basalt vessels (Fig. 172:2-3). Photo 170. Wadi Zumeili, Ghassulian Ware, jar with incised decoration. 8 Slip. Late Chalcolithic vessels are very rarely covered with a red slip. Sometimes a reserved slip technique was utilized; the vessel was first covered with paint and later, after drying, horizontal bands were scraped away, exposing the original surface of the vessel. 9 Figurative painting. At Tuleilat el-Ghassul a few such examples have been reported, one depicting a bird and the other a horned animal (Photo 171). Human faces were sometimes drawn on ossuaries (Perrot and Ladiray 1980: Figs. 33, 60). 10 Figurative plastic decoration. This form of decoration is relatively rare. Known examples may be divided into four groups: 273</page><page sequence="291">Fig. 171. Late Chalcolithic, Ghassulian Ware, vessels with thumb-impressed rims.

These were formed by elongated bands of clay with circular impressed decoration (Photo 167:2, Malion et al. 1934: Pl. 52:1-2, 5). b Horns. These were modelled in pairs on ossuaries (Perrot and Ladiray 1980: Figs. 92; 103; 105; 141), ossuary lids (Perrot and Ladiray 1980: Fig. 63:9), burial jars (Perrot and Ladiray 1980: Fig. 119:6-10) and in the Golan Heights on large jars (below, Photos 175, 180:1). c Zoomorphic figures attached to the rims of bowls. These are reported only from Tuleilat el-Ghassul (Fig. 128:9-11; Lee 1973: 96-97). d Human heads on ossuaries (Photos 157-59). The most common form in the coastal plain is a schematic plastic decoration of a nose, sometimes with eyes (Perrot and Ladiray 1980: Fig. 48). Ossuaries recently excavated at Peqi'in include naturalistic, three- dimensional depictions of heads (Gal et al. 1995; 1996; 1997). Quantitative data on decorative techniques are available from Meitar (Garfinkel, in preparation e). Of 7848 sherds, 1081 were decorated (13.8%). The following types occur: red painted (91.4%); impressed (3.7%); thumb-impressed rims (3.6%); impressed and painted (0.9%); and white wash (0.4%). No applied rope decoration was found at Meitar, though this type of decoration is quite common at Jordan Valley sites. It is noteworthy that red-slipped and burnished vessel surfaces are not reported in Ghassulian Ware. The absence of this decorative technique, the main form of decoration in many periods in the southern Levant, is thus typical of this period. 275</page><page sequence="293">6.3. GOLAN WARE Contributed by Claire Epstein Distinctive groups of pottery vessels dating from the Late Chalcolithic period are characteristic of the Golan Heights. Though first identified in the 1960s in a trial excavation at Tel Turmus (Dayan 1969), it was only in the early 1970s and during the 1980s that vessels of this kind were found in a reliable context. As the result of extensive excavations in the basalt-covered areas of the central Golan, closely spaced agro-pastoral settlements were revealed (Fig. 173), with houses containing a wide range of artifacts. Calibrated radiometric dates cover a period from the end of the 5th to the beginning of the 4th millennia BCE (Carmi et al. 1995). Similar wares have been found at a number of sites in Galilee, including Tel Te'o (Eisenberg 1987), several smaller sites (Epstein 1992) and Peqi'in (Gal et al. 1997: Fig. 5). Detailed discussion of the pottery from the Golan can be found in the final publication dealing with the Golan Chalcolithic culture (Epstein 1998). Fig. 173. Late Chalcolithic sites in the Golan mentioned in the text. 1: El-Majami'; 2: Rasm Harbush; 3: Site northwest of Qaliq; 4: "Silo Site" near 'Ein el-Faras; 5: Site near Daliyyot Waterfall; 6: Rasm el-Kabash; 7: Khirbet el Hutiyye. Ware and Decoration (Fig. 174) Pottery vessels, produced primarily for domestic use, were made from clay obtained from wadis near the settlements. In the central Golan, where cover basalt predominates, the clay contains quartz and gritty inclusions and is rich in basalt particles, the latter affecting the color of the ware after firing. The pottery is dark reddish-brown in color, sometimes bright red, orange-red or pinkish-red, according to the firing temperature (700-800° and higher). In the southern Golan, with its extensive exposures of sedimentary rocks, the wadi clays have a high calcareous content with a varying admixture of basalt and gravel. Here the local wares are predominantly light buff to cream in color and are often irregularly decorated with red paint, while the color of the local red-toned fabrics differs from that of the distinctive reddish-brown pottery typical of the basalt-covered areas. All the vessels are handmade, with some use of the tournette on neck and shoulder. Mat impres- sions on bases are completely absent: the flat-based pots were probably built up when set on a flat basalt stone. Coil building was widely used, as indicated by marks on the inner vessel wall; the outer surface was usually carefully smoothed over. Impressed decoration was widely used, mostly in the form of horizontal bands, especially on larger vessels on which contrasting configurations were often introduced to diversify the encircling pattern. On smaller vessels the decoration is also horizontal, usually on the upper part. The most common decorative motif, used exten- sively on storage jars, is the rope pattern applied directly to the vessel surface. This is confirmed by the absence in the section of any sign of the addition of strips of clay to carry the decoration, while on vessels decorated prior to the attachment of the handle, the pattern continues uninterruptedly across the handle mark on the body (Photo 172). On any one vessel the direction of the indentations is constant, the shape and size of the impressions depending on the type of tool used to apply the ornament. Variety in ornamental effect could also be achieved by altering the spacing, slant and depth of the impressions, as likewise the speed of the marking movement. Impressed rope pattern decoration is not con- fined to concentric bands, but is used in a variety of forms, including wavy lines, zigzags, circles, and 276</page><page sequence="294">Fig. 174. Late Chalcolithic, Golan Ware, schematic typological chart. 2/7</page><page sequence="295">Photo 172. Golan Ware, handles attached to vessels on top of impressed rope decoration. upright and oblique bars. In addition, it is widely used to decorate medium-sized vessels, such as spouted kraters, fenestrated footed bowls and, to a lesser extent, large bowls. Most bowls, however, are decorated with a wide range of slashes, incisions and punctured motifs. The widespread use of the above motifs illustrates a predilection for the decoration of common household utensils. A. Bowls Al. Small V-shaped bowl (Fig. 175:1-4). A2. Rounded bowl (Fig. 175:5-12). A3. Large single-handled bowl, rope-decorated (Fig. 175:13-14; Photo 173). Large numbers of bowl sherds were retrieved at all sites, but few complete vessels could be restored. Bowls are of different shapes and sizes and are made both with and without handles, with a single handle or two small ledge handles. In contrast to many contemporary assemblages, V-shaped bowls (type Al) are not very common. Rims are often flattened and slightly everted. While plain bowls occur frequently, most bowls are decorated with a wide range of motifs, among which incised and punctu- red decoration predominate. Applied below the rim in varying sizes and depths, recurrent patterns are Photo 173. Golan Ware, bowl (Fig. 175:13). Fig. 175. Late Chalcolithic, Golan Ware, bowls (types Al -3).

Rope ornament is not often used, except to decorate large single-handled bowls (Fig. 175:13-14; Photo 173). This type of bowl (A3) comes mainly from the large site of Rasm Harbush: the wide flattened rim, thick fabric and encircling rope pattern bands distinguish it from other bowl types and mark its relationship to the pithos, while the single broad handle is unusual. B. Fenestrated Footed Bowls This is the name used here for the items designated "chalices" in the Ghassulian Ware (Fig. 134). These items, made in two separate parts, were finger- impressed on the contiguous surfaces so as to fit securely together; the join was then masked by a band of rope pattern (Fig. 176:1-6; Photos 174-75). The high fenestrated foot has a well-made base, sometimes decorated with bands of rope pattern (Fig. 176:5); it is pierced by three or four elongated "windows," usually curved at the extremities and marked by a clay finish (Fig. 176:1). Many fragments of fenestrated footed bowls were recov- ered but only one vessel was restorable (Fig. 176:1; Photo 174). Unfortunately it lacks the part of the bowl section which almost certainly bore a plasti- cally-rendered symbol, as on so many of the others. Fenestrated footed bowls were decorated with plastic applications. The applications are in the Photo 174. Golan Ware, fenestrated footed bowl (Fig. 176:1). Photo 175. Golan Ware, fenestrated footed bowl frag- ment decorated with applied horn handle (Fig. 176:4). form of stylized horns (Fig. 176:9), a nose placed between horns (Fig. 176:3) or a "horn handle" consisting of horns placed on either side of a small horizontal non-functional handle (Fig. 176:2, 4; Photo 175). Similar cultic applications are also found on other types of vessels, including larger and smaller pithoi (Figs. 176:8, 179:2; Photo 180:1), while the placing of circular button-like symbols on either side of a small handle (Fig. 180:5) can likewise be thus interpreted. Although different in conception, it is likely that the delicately modelled goat's head (Fig. 176:10) was added to a storage jar with similar apotropaic intent. It should be noted that since the "horn handle" was not functional, there are good grounds for regarding it as a mark of association, connecting a vessel with the herded animals and, by extension, with everything pertaining to the pastoral side of the economy. As such, it was added to fenestrated footed bowls, which were probably used for offerings in domestic cult practices to induce increase among the flocks; with the same end in view, it was added to domestic vessels used in the preparation of milk products. C. Kraters Cl. Small to medium-sized krater with double handle (Fig. 177:1-3; Photo 176). Note that in the Ghassulian Ware these vessels were designated "deep bowls" (Fig. 130). C2. Large spouted krater (Fig. 177:4-6; Photo 177). Comparatively few vessels of type CI could be reconstructed. Of various sizes, some are decorated, 280</page><page sequence="298">Fig. 176.

Golan Ware, small kraters (No. 1, Fig. 177:1; No. 2, Fig. 177:2). others plain. Double handles are common, compris- ing either a pair of upright handles or a pair of horizontal handles. One vessel has double perfo- rated handles at the sides (Fig. 177:1) which, it has been suggested, were specially contrived so as to secure a lid firmly to the pot by means of string passed through them (Tadmor 1992: Fig. 18). Although few complete large spouted kraters (type C2) could be restored, the recovery of over fifty spouts throughout the excavated sites (Fig. 177:7-10) points to the widespread use of different- sized spouted vessels. The larger form can be regarded as a shortened version of the wide- mouthed pithos (type F): most have a flattened rim, all have vertical handles at the sides and the upper body is frequently decorated with bands of rope pattern, though incised herring-bone (Fig. 177:6) and punctured decoration also occur. Spouts were made separately and added to the completed vessel. On one or two there is a small inner ledge at the base of the spout hole (Fig. 177:4) to prevent the spilling of accumulated sediment. Below other spouts there are a small auxiliary handle (Fig. 177:7) or a small knob (Fig. 177:5, 8-9); on one there is a small plastic nose (Fig. 177:10). The large numbers of spouts indicate that this type of spouted pot was a common item of household equipment made to hold a liquid. It has been suggested that these vessels were used in processes connected with the making and storage of oil (Epstein 1993). Photo 177. Golan Ware, large spouted krater (Fig. 177:5). Fig. 177.

Holemouth Jars Holemouth jars are globular and rather squat in shape (Fig. 178:1-3; Photo 178); some have lug handles on either side (Fig. 178:1), while on one there is a pair of nipple protruberances at mid-body (Fig. 178:2). Photo 178. Golan Ware, holemouth jar (Fig. 178:1). Although relatively few holemouth jars have been recovered, it is likely that this type of vessel was a common item of household equipment, used as a cooking pot as at other contemporary sites. However, since few are complete and little of the lower body is usually extant, no signs of soot or burning were found. The scarcity of holemouth jars in the Golan assemblages may well be due to their removal when the houses were eventually aban- doned, the occupants taking with them only the essential utensils that were necessary for basic living requirements. £. Juglets, Jugs and Jars This category includes a variety of elaborate closed vessels: Ela. Juglet, high narrow neck, globular body, decorated (Fig. 178:5; Photo 179:1). Elb. Juglet, low wide ridged neck, globular body, plain (Fig. 178:4). E2a. Jug, high wide neck, rounded body, plain (Fig. 178:6; Photo 179:2). Jugs have recently been reported from Peqi'in (Gal et al. 1997: 150-51). E2b. Jug, rounded body, decorated (Fig. 178:7). E3. Jar, high wide neck, double handles, plain (Fig. 178:8). The pottery assemblages from the Golan contain very few jugs or juglets of any kind; this may also be due to the removal from the evacuated houses of many of the smaller and easily portable vessels. On both juglets and jugs there is either a loop or a strap handle; bases are flat and usually wide, imparting a somewhat truncated look to the lower body. Juglets, characterized by a slender neck widening at the rim, are often decorated, including a pair of nipple protruberances at mid-body (Fig. 178:5). An extremely small juglet is unusual for its wide neck, globular body and single minute lug handle (Fig. 178:4). Jugs tend to be wide-necked and are either plain or decorated on the shoulder. A unique jar has a wide neck and double shoulder handles (Fig. 178:8). Photo 179. Golan Ware, juglet (No. 1, Fig. 178:5) and jug (No. 2, Fig. 178:6). 284</page><page sequence="302">Fig. 178.

Pithoi The pithos, or large storage jar, is among the most commonly found vessels at all sites. Its widespread use, especially for grain storage, was to no small extent due to the difficulty of digging a silo into the hard basalt terrain where the sites are concentrated, an interpretation which gains added weight in the light of the comparatively small number of silos discovered. In accordance with their overall shape and decoration, the pithoi have been divided into several categories, with a marked differentiation between wide-mouthed (F) and narrow-necked forms (G). In addition to large and medium-sized vessels, fragments of small jars of similar shape and decoration were also recovered; they are miniature versions of the larger types. Irrespective of size, the characteristic features of what may be termed the typical Golan pithos are the following: a barrel-like shape, wide flattened rim, comparatively small base, upright handles at the sides and, occasionally, small horizontal aux- iliary shoulder handles, the whole of the body (to within a little above the base) being decorated with bands of rope ornament (Fig. 179:1). In addition, the broad flattened rim may be ornamented along the edge with a series of nicks, or with straight or zigzag lines of punctured dots on the upper surface; handles, triangular in section, may be slightly rounded or acutely curved, decorated along the back, or plain. There are so many variations of the rope ornament that the size and proportions, as well as the spacing of the decoration, differ greatly from vessel to vessel. The following main categories have been distinguished: F. Wide-Mouthed Pithoi Fla. Large pithos, decorated concentric rope pattern bands (Fig. 179:1). Fib. Medium-sized pithos, decorated concentric rope pattern bands, horn handle (Fig. 179:2; Photo 180:1). This vessel is unique on account of the single horn handle (restored) on the shoulder, pointing to a connection with pastoral activities. The possibility should not be ruled out that this smaller type of container was used for the processing of milk and the preparation of milk products and that the horn handle served not only as a mark of association, but 286</page><page sequence="304">Fig. 179.

Large pithos, lower body decorated with concentric rope pattern bands, contrasting shoulder decoration (Fig. 179:3-5; Photo 180:2-3). While most of the body is ornamented with concentric bands of rope pattern, the shoulder is decorated with contrasting motifs (likewise in rope pattern), including zigzags, herring-bone pattern, oblique bands, triangular motifs and an inscribed circle set in a panel of horizontal bands on the upper body. F2b. Extremely wide-mouthed pithos. This is the only example of an extremely wide-mouthed and un- wieldy pithos (Fig. 180:4; Photo 181). It is closely decorated with bands of rope pattern on the body which alternate below the rim with a narrow frieze of zigzags. The handles are elaborately decorated and the upper surface of the wide flat rim is covered with close rows of punctured dots. On a much smaller vessel (Fig. 180:3) the shoulder decoration consists of groups of short upright bars placed at intervals between overall concentric bands. Photo 181. Golan Ware, wide-mouthed pithos (Fig. 180:4). F3. Large to medium-sized pithos, decorated below rim and above base with two or three concentric rope pattern bands (Fig. 180:1). This form of decoration is found on pithoi of different shapes and sizes, both wide-mouthed and narrow-necked; but on all vessels the intervening space between the groups of rope pattern bands is undecorated. It may well be that the groups of double or triple bands were so placed in order to mask joins between separately- made parts of the vessel as it was gradually built up by the potter. F4. Large to medium-sized pithos, plain (Fig. 180:2). Owing to the preference for highly decorated wares, storage jars without ornament of any kind do not often occur. Most are medium-sized, the heavier type of vessel being completely absent. Rims are largely out-curving, in contrast to the flattened shelf-like rim which is a recurrent feature of so many large pithoi. "Eye and Nose" handles These vertical pithos handles are distinctive on account of the second, smaller perforation made above that of the main handle (Fig. 180:6-7; Photo 182). Both in full face and in profile, the handle curve calls to mind the eyes and nose of a face, a likeness made even stronger in profile by the indication of the forehead bulge. It was this resemblance that gave rise to the name which is used to designate handles of this kind in the Golan. The examples shown here, as also the pair on a complete pithos (Fig. 181:1), illustrate the general likeness to facial features, with special emphasis on the nose. The nose was widely regarded as a life- fertility symbol imbued with a special potency, as exemplified by its use as a plastically-rendered feature on fenestrated footed bowls (above) and its pronounced appearance on basalt pillar figures (Epstein 1982: 70-72).

Large to medium-sized narrow-necked pithos, lower body decorated with concentric rope pattern bands, contrasting shoulder decoration (Fig. 181:2, 4; Photo 183:2). In addition to the widely distributed types of wide- mouthed pithoi, a number of narrow-necked storage jars occur. The outstanding difference between the pithoi belonging to this category and those already described is in the size of the opening. Instead of the bin-like aperture, they are character- ized by a narrow opening above a high neck which is sometimes decorated. Probably because of the narrowing of the upper shoulder, these vessels tend towards a more globular shape. Although no residual material was recovered which could throw light on the nature of their contents, it can be assumed that they were used as containers for specific products, possibly dry goods other than grain.

Noteworthy are the design of inscribed circles of punctured dots introduced on the shoulder between horizontal rope pattern bands (Fig. 181:2) and the extension to mid- body of the contrasting zigzag motif on a medium- sized globular jar (Fig. 181:3). The large pithos decorated on the shoulder with a running zigzag design (Fig. 181:4) illustrates the elegance of some of the heavier types of vessels used for storage. Photo 183.

HULAH WARE In the Hulah Valley, located in the northernmost part of the Jordan Valley, pottery assemblages dated to the Late Chalcolithic period have been reported from only two sites: Tel Turmus. At this site a limited stratigraphie section of 15 square meters was excavated in 1962 (Dayan 1969). Further salvage excavations were conducted in the mid-1990s, though as yet nothing has been published on this excavation. During the first excavation, six stratigraphie phases were discerned and the excavator divided the sequence into two phases: "The older, corresponding to strata 5-6, is characterized by a 'black incised' ware; the later, corresponding to stratum 2, and perhaps strata 3-4, is characterized by the 'excised stripes' type of decoration" (Dayan 1969: 70). In the report five pottery plates present approximately a hundred sherds. Some of these finds are now stored in the Israel Antiquities Authority storerooms in Jerusa- lem. When Tel Turmus was excavated, the finds there were enigmatic and difficult to understand. Today, in light of the excavations at sites in the Golan Heights and nearby Tel Te'o, it appears that the entire sequence at Tel Turmus belongs to the Late Chalcolithic (Eisenberg 1989: 35). Tel Te'o. This site was excavated in a salvage excavation in 1986 (Eisenberg 1989), revealing a sequence of strata dating from the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B through the Early Bronze Age. Strata VI- VII are from the Late Chalcolithic period. An area of 600 square meters was excavated. In Stratum VI an impressive architectural assemblage included several rectangular structures arranged around a courtyard was unearthed (Eisenberg 1989: Fig. 2:a). Only a short preliminary report has been published on the pottery. It includes a single plate with 17 sherds and a short description: "Most of the identifiable sherds represent V-shaped or everted rim bowls of assorted sizes. Some of them are red or brown to black slipped and burnished with incised decorations ... These incisions are horizontal, triangular, wavy or of herring bone design ... Other common vessels are holemouth; some apparently served as cooking pots. The few examples of storage jars found [are] reminiscent of similar vessels from the Golan Culture" (Eisenberg 1989: 35). 291</page><page sequence="309">The limited information published to date does not enable comprehensive discussion of Hulah Ware. The following vessel types are present: Open Vessels A. Small and medium-sized bowls. Fig. 182 presents various bowls, some with straight, everted sides and others with rounded, slightly outcurved sides. There are no quantitative data concerning the frequency of the various types. The bowls are decorated in a number of techniques: red slip (Fig. 182:3), wavy incision (Fig. 182:4-6), applied plastic decoration (Fig. 182:7-9) and burnished black slip with a variety of incisions, known as "Tel Turmus decora- tion" (Fig. 182:10-12). Similar bowls with incised decoration and applied plastic decoration have been reported at several sites in the Golan Heights (Fig. 175:9-10). B. Large bowls and open kraters. This type includes a variety of vessels with straight or rounded sides, greater than 25 cm in diameter. They are decorated in a variety of techniques (Fig. 183:1-4). C. Spouted krater. These vessels were found at both sites (Fig. 183:5-6). D. Holemouth pithos. These large vessels have a holemouth profile, thickened, carefully shaped rim and horizontal bands of densely incised rope decoration (Fig. 183:7-8). "Eye and Nose" type handles have been reported as well (Fig. 183:9). These vessels are particularly common in the Golan Heights, as has been explained in detail above (Figs. 179-80). Closed Vessels E. Holemouth jar. As outlined in the Tel Te'o report, these vessels are quite common. Fig. 184:1 shows a large holemouth jar from Tel Te'o. This vessel is decorated with a red stripe on the interior and exterior of the rim. F. Jar. Several relatively small sherds indicate the existence of jars at Hulah Valley sites (Fig. 184:2-3). Varia G. Spoon. A single example was found at Tel Turmus (Fig. 184:7). Similar examples have been reported at the southern sites of Tuleilat el-Ghassul, Fazael and Tel 'Erani (Fig. 161), but not from the Golan Heights. H. Churn. Fragments of two medium-sized churns were reported from the Tel Te'o excavations (Fig. 184:5-6). Similar vessels have been reported at several southern sites (Fig. 160), but not from the Golan Heights. Fig. 182. Late Chalcolithic, Hulah Ware, various bowls (type A).

At the same time, black-slipped and burnished areas were observed on these sherds. In Fig. 185, a selection of such sherds from Tel Turmus is presented. The different researchers have pointed out the similarity between this decoration and the incisions and black slip of Wadi Rabah Ware (Dayan 1969; Eisenberg 1989). However, it should be noted that the Wadi Rabah and Tel Turmus decorated wares are separated by the period of the Middle Chalcolithic and cannot therefore be regarded as showing direct continuity. From a stylistic standpoint as well, the incised motifs of Tel Turmus Ware (Fig. 185) are distinct from those of Wadi Rabah Ware (Fig. 90). The Tel Te'o and Tel Turmus assemblages present, on the one hand, typological features typical of Ghassulian Ware, such as churns and spoons, and on the other hand, typological char- Photo 184.

The Hulah Valley assemblage appears to be a local variant which adopted elements from both north and south. Moreover, there is a unique decorative style at these sites, referred to here as "Tel Turmus decoration," which does not occur in other regions. Fig. 185.

The finds have been divided into four main periods: Pottery Neolithic, Early Chalcolithic, Middle Chalcolithic and Late Chalcolithic. The pottery of these periods has been described with the accompaniment of drawings and photographs of pottery from a variety of sites. I have attempted to present the full range of typological groups rather than selected vessels of particular chronological significance. It is now time to summarize and to present the main conclusions which may be drawn from the data presented. For those interested in pottery as a tool for dating, section 7.1 includes a survey of the changes discernible in the main vessel types from period to period. Section 7.2 treats the full typological range of each period. For those interested in a general picture of the four periods described here, in section 7.3 I shall digress from the description of their pottery and present other aspects of the material culture of each period. Section 7.4 summarizes the radiometric data available for each of the four periods. 7.1. TYPOLOGY The four previous chapters have presented the reader with a typological analysis of the vessels known from each period. For those interested in pottery as a tool for dating, the presentation of such large amounts of information sometimes creates a situation in which, as the saying goes, it is hard to see the wood for the trees. I will therefore focus here on the most indicative pottery types and emphasize the features in each which change from one period to the next. Rare vessels of outstanding typological importance will also be mentioned. These are not necessarily the most common types, but rather the fossiles directeurs most indicative of the period in question. Bowls (Fig. 186) During the Pottery Neolithic, the most common bowl type is the deep bowl with rounded sides and one handle on or near the rim. This type appears in both plain forms (C2) and with elaborate decora- tion (CI): red slip, painted stripes and incised herring-bone pattern. During the Early Chalcolithic, three types of bowls are common: a deep carinated bowl (A2), a shallow incurving bowl (Bl) and a shallow cari- nated bowl (B3). These bowls are generally deco- rated with red or black burnished slip. During the Middle Chalcolithic, large deep bowls with straight, everted sides (A3) are common. They resemble the large V-shaped bowls of the following period and sometimes have rope decoration. During the Late Chalcolithic, the most common bowl, which constitutes about a third of the vessels at many sites, is the small V-shaped bowl (Al). These bowls were made on a slow wheel. Most of these bowls are undecorated, but the rim occasion- ally has a red stripe. Chalices (Fig. 187) During the Pottery Neolithic, two types of chalice appear: a small chalice with a high solid base (A2) and a large chalice with a hollow base (C4). Both types of chalice have a single handle which extends from the base of the bowl to the middle of the base. During the Early Chalcolithic, very heavy, thick- sided chalices of large diameter (CI) appear. They are decorated with burnished red slip. A smaller type of chalice with a fenestrated base also occurs. During the Middle Chalcolithic, few examples of chalices (Bl) are known, and these only from fragments. It is currently impossible to establish a characteristic type. During the Late Chalcolithic, the typical chalice has a V-shaped bowl and a particularly high hollow base which is generally fenestrated with rectangular windows (C2). 297</page><page sequence="315">Fig. 186. Summary chart of bowls. Fig. 187. Summary chart of chalices. 298</page><page sequence="316">Holemouth jars (Fig. 188) During the Pottery Neolithic, the holemouth jar is characterized by an oval, rather than circular, opening. The rim is generally rounded or pointed with two lug handles near it (Fl). During the Early Chalcolithic, a holemouth jar with a carinated body and without handles (E3) appears. The carination is in the midsection or lower part of the vessel. Most of the holemouth jars have a square rim. During the Middle Chalcolithic, holemouth jars have loop handles which widen at the point where they are attached to the body (E2). Some holemouth jars have a ridge below the rim. The body sometimes has applied rope decoration. During the Late Chalcolithic, a variety of hole- mouth jars appear. Outstanding among them is a small jar with a spout (F2). During this phase, loop or lug handles sometimes appear on large hole- mouth jars. rig. Iöö. Summary chart 01 holemouth jars. 299</page><page sequence="317">Fig. 189. Summary chart of jars. 300</page><page sequence="318">Jars (Fig. 189) The characteristic type of the Pottery Neolithic is a jar with two handles which extend from the neck to the shoulder: Sha'ar Hagolan jar (Dl), Jericho IX jar (D2) and Byblos jar (D3). This type appears in a number of sizes. During the Early Chalcolithic, jars without handles appear. The neck is made separately and attached to the shoulder at a 90-degree angle. On the basis of the neck, the jars may be divided into three types: bow rim (Fl), flaring rim (F2) and outcurved rim (F3). During the Middle Chalcolithic, bag-shaped (Fl) and swollen neck (F2) jars appear. Bow-rim jars of this phase (F6) are characterized by a sloping shoulder without sharp carination at the point of its attachment to the neck. The jars have loop handles which widen where they meet the body and are decorated with applied rope decoration and drip painting. During the Late Chalcolithic, low-necked jars with everted rims (El) predominate. In addition, there are rare types which occur only in this phase: bottle (E4), jar with multiple handles (E3), burial jar (G4) and Gilat jar (G5). The jars are characterized by a variety of pierced handles of various sizes. Pithoi (Fig. 190) During the Pottery Neolithic, pithoi with hole- mouth profile, thickened rim and a row of lug handles near the rim (E4) are common. Fig. 190. Summary chart of pithoi. 301</page><page sequence="319">During the Early Chalcolithic, pithoi with hole- mouth profile and thickened rim (D), similar to those of the Pottery Neolithic, are common. The innovation in this phase is the appearance of thumb-impressed ledge handles located near the rim. During the Middle Chalcolithic, pithoi with low, incurved neck (G) appear; they are similar to those of the Late Chalcolithic period. Pithoi with large loop handles located on the lower part of the body (B2) occur in Qatifian Ware. During the Late Chalcolithic, pithoi with low neck and outcurved rim (HI) occur. In the Jordan Valley there is a type of particularly large pithos, 1.5-2 m high, decorated with bands of applied rope decoration (H2). Complete vessels of this type have been found buried under floors in sites of this period. Unusual vessels (Fig. 191) Clay spoons (A3) occur in the Pottery Neolithic. During this phase spouted vessels, known in each of the following three phases, do not yet appear. Another vessel indicative of this period is the shallow basin with very thick sides and base (E3). During the Early Chalcolithic, lids with shallow cylindrical body and base broader than the body (B5) occur. Another unusual type is the thick-sided, cylindrical stand of narrow diameter, open on both ends, with rectangular or circular fenestrations (C2). During the Middle Chalcolithic no exceptional types have been noted. During the Late Chalcolithic, there is a large variety of special vessels: cornet (Bl), churn (I), spoon (JI), zoomorphic (J4) and anthropomorphic vessels (J5) and ossuaries (J6). Decorative patterns During the Pottery Neolithic, two types of decora- tion predominate. Yarmukian vessels are character- ized by their incised, framed herring-bone pattern. Sometimes, the empty frame appears without herring-bone incision. Jericho IX vessels are char- Fig. 191. Summary chart of unusual vessels. 302</page><page sequence="320">acterized by painted and burnished stripes. In both groups there are vessels covered with red slip. During the Early Chalcolithic, special attention was paid to vessel decoration. There is a great variety of surface treatments: incised, impressed, punctured, combed and plastic. This wealth of decoration is unparalleled in any other period in the region. Red or black slip and burnish of outstanding quality also occur. During the Middle Chalcolithic there is drip- painted decoration in which the paint is dripped from rim to base. The various incised decorations and red slip and burnish continue, though they decline markedly. During this phase, applied rope decoration occurs on a wide variety of vessels. In a limited geographical area in the central Jordan Valley, Tel Zaf decoration occurs, with geometric motifs painted with a fine brush in red and black on a white background. During the Late Chalcolithic, red burnished slip disappears. The most common decorations are painted horizontal stripes, various incised rope decorations and applied rope decoration on large storage vessels. 7.2. VARIETY OF TYPES In this section, I shall leave the typological discussion of individual vessels and focus on the typological variety characteristic of each period. The emphasis here will be on the number of types identified in each period. These data are summar- ized in Table 22, which presents the breakdown of types into seven main classes: open vessels, kraters and pithoi, holemouth jars, jars, spoons, stands and varia. During the Pottery Neolithic, in the initial phase of pottery production, 21 definable vessel types exist. Eighteen types are defined in the Munhata excavation report (Fig. 7) and another three types are more typical of the Jericho IX assemblages: shallow bowls, hemispherical bowls and jar with handles on the body. Among the vessels of the Early Chalcolithic, 20 types are defined. Eighteen types are defined in the Munhata excavation report (Fig. 66) and two other types have been added to these: platters and straight-necked jars. Thus, despite the typological change in vessel form, the number of vessel types remains largely unchanged. In the Middle Chalcolithic, 20 types have been identified (Fig. 93). Here too, there is no significant change in the number of types. In the Late Chalcolithic, on the other hand, there is an increase in the number of types from approximately 20 in each of the three previous periods to around 40 (Table 22). Vessels now occur in larger quantities at the various sites and served for a wider range of activities: A In the household for cooking, storing and serving food. B In agriculture as large silos for storing the harvest. C In industry for curdling milk (churns) and oil production (spouted vessels). D For burial (burial jars with side opening and box-like ossuaries). E In cult (anthropomorphic and zoomorphic vessels). 7.3. SURVEY OF THE PERIODS The Pottery Neolithic The Pottery Neolithic is characterized by a mosaic of regional cultures which simultaneously populated different parts of the Levant: 1 The Yarmukian culture is known at sites located in the Mediterranean zone of the central Levant, in Israel, Jordan and Lebanon. Only the Wadi Murabba'at Cave lies outside this area and is located in a desert region. This should Table 22. The variety of pottery types in the different periods.

The following sites have yielded significant finds of this culture: Jericho IX, Teluliyot Batash, Khirbet ed-Dharih, Dhra', Ghrubba and Lod. In addition, small assemblages have been reported at sites farther north, at Asawir, Neveh Yam, Yiftahel and Nahal Zehora II. 3 Nizzanim Ware was found at sites in the southern coastal plain, south of the Yarmukian sites and west of the Jericho IX sites, including Giv'at Haparsa, Nizzanim and Ziqim. 4 North of the area of the Yarmukian culture, we lack information on parallels. However, it should be noted that Cardium Combed Ware, found in the "néolithique ancien" at Byblos (Dunand 1973: Pis. XLV-XLIX), has been reported at two additional sites: Stratum III at Tell Ramad in Syria (de Contenson and Van Liere 1966: PI. 2a: 1) and in Kaplan's excava- tions at Kefar Gil'adi in the Hulah Valley. The examples from Kefar Gil'adi have not been published; however, I was able to examine material from both sites in the storerooms of the Israel Antiquities Authority and in the collection of the Harvard Semitic Museum. In Stratum III at Tell Ramad, pits contained pottery, figurines with cowrie-shell eyes, and a flint industry including sickleblades with deep, wide serration and small arrowheads. Lately, de Contenson has proposed that Stratum III at Tell Ramad should be dated to the second half of the 6th millennium bee, parallel to Sha'ar Hagolan and Jericho IX (de Contenson 1989). Tell Ramad may reflect a local tradition in the Damascus area and perhaps in the Hulah Valley. 5 North of Byblos, Pottery Neolithic sites are known in the 'Amuq area, Tell Sukas and Ugarit. At these sites, red and black slipped and burnished pottery of a type referred to as Dark Faced Burnished Ware (DFBW) was in use. Such vessels do not appear in the southern Levant during the Pottery Neolithic, but similar ones do occur in the Early Chalcolithic. 6 Sites are known in desert areas which have no pottery at all. These may be related to the Pottery Neolithic period on the basis of the following considerations: a Radiometric dates which fall into the frame- work of the 6th millennium bee at Kadesh Barnea 3, Jebel Naja and Dhuweila (see Table 28). b The appearance at these sites of small flint arrowheads which also occur in Pottery Neolithic sites in the Mediterranean region. Many researchers have regarded the various groups surveyed above as a chronologically significant development and much effort has gone into attempts to establish the order of their appearance, from early to late. On the basis of typological and geographical analysis of the finds in this work, I have concluded that these are regional cultures which existed simultaneously, each within a defined territory. Some overlap may be observed between these units; however, the main sites of each culture are clustered in distinct regions. When we examine the material culture in the different regions, there appears to be considerable unity in flint tool and pottery types. The regional differences are manifest mainly in the decorative style of pottery and in art objects: at Yarmukian sites decoration is mainly engraved, while at Jericho IX it is primarily painted and burnished. The decoration is stylized, easily identified and emphasizes the uniqueness of each cultural entity. The Yarmukian sites are also outstanding in the richness of their art objects, including stylized anthropomorphic clay and pebble figurines and grooved stone artifacts. This wealth and variety is unknown in other cultural entities. A further feature observed in the Pottery Neolithic is the decline in the amount of obsidian and exotic objects, appar- ently indicating a weakening of long-distance connections in the Levant. During this period there seems to have been a tendency for human groups (tribes?) to live in relative isolation, with a resulting strengthening of the unique character of each region. The Early Chalcolithic The Early Chalcolithic represents a drastic change in the material culture of the region, as compared to the preceding phase. This is evident in the following features: 304</page><page sequence="322">1 New, consolidated forms, particularly pottery types, appear. 2 Flint tools undergo major change, including the disappearance of small arrowheads and the appearance of new types of sickleblades. From this phase on, small arrowheads are not found at Mediterranean sites and remain in use only in seasonal desert sites such as Nahal 'Ishrun. 3 Statuettes and other art objects, which appeared with high frequency at Yarmukian sites, are almost entirely lacking at Wadi Rabah sites. While a central motif of the Yarmukian culture, figurines with cowrie-shell eyes, continues to appear in Mesopotamia throughout the 5th-4th millennia bee, at Wadi Rabah sites it disappears entirely. Few art objects were reported in earlier excavations at Wadi Rabah sites: the outstand- ing find is the holemouth jar decorated with two dancing figures in relief from 'Ein el-Jarba (Fig. 81:15; Photo 62). In recent years additional finds, especially large numbers of stamp seals, have been made at Hagosherim but remain unpublished (Getzov, personal communication). 4 A change takes place in settlement patterns, from extensive pits and poorly-built villages covering large areas to densely built-up villages. At Munhata and Jericho, there is a reduction in the settlement area. 5 Elongated slingstones, which do not occur at Pottery Neolithic sites, now appear. This element of the material culture is known at Halafian sites. 6 At Wadi Rabah sites, obsidian objects are reported at nearly all sites and obsidian becomes less rare than it was in the previous period. The Wadi Rabah phase may be regarded as constituting a significant change in the material culture of the southern and central Levant. The transition from the Pottery Neolithic to the Early Chalcolithic appears to have taken place quickly, for we find few signs of continuity and hybrids indicative of a transitional phase do not occur. Wadi Rabah Ware consists almost entirely of new forms borrowed from the Halafian culture. Local cultural development did not take place in this phase; rather, Halafian influences were adopted and absorbed from northern Syria. How may this phenomenon be understood? Does it reflect massive population movements, as various researchers have suggested, or did a local population adopt Halafian cultural elements, similar to the process of Helleni- zation in a later period? Whatever the case, it is a rapid, drastic change which includes many aspects of material culture. We have few data on Wadi Rabah burial customs. At excavated sites from this period, tombs are known only at 'Ein el-Jarba, where simple burials in the ground were observed. At Munhata, 'Ein el-Jarba/Hazorea, Wadi Rabah and Jericho VIII, where distinct strata of this period were excavated and there was no later settlement, infant jar burials were not reported. No jar burials were found in the Halafian culture either: burials consisted of simple interments, accompanied by gifts (Akkermans 1989; Merpert and Munchaev 1993). Therefore, jar burials attributed to the Wadi Rabah phase, such as Teluliyot Batash Stratum III, Tel Dan Phase B and the "néolithique moyen" at Byblos, may reflect misreadings of stratigraphy. The final feature that we shall emphasize here is the high level of cultural homogeneity in the Early Chalcolithic sites. Wadi Rabah sites appear both in areas previously characterized by Jericho IX vessels and in areas where Yarmukian vessels predomi- nated. This homogeneity is likewise observed in the central and northern Levant, as seen in the Baq'a sites, "néolithique moyen" Byblos and 'Amuq Phase C. The obsidian trade intensifies in compar- ison to the Pottery Neolithic; it would seem that during periods of cultural homogeneity over broad regions of the Levant, there is an increase in the amounts of obsidian found in excavations. The Middle Chalcolithic As shown above, this is a separate phase in the sequence between the Wadi Rabah culture and the Ghassulian Chalcolithic. Pottery from this phase, which appears at a considerable number of sites, is divided into two groups, a northern group called Beth Shean Ware, after the first site at which it was found, and a southern group called Qatifian Ware. Beth Shean Ware is known at many sites, including the pits and Stratum XVIII at Tel Beth Shean, Stratum lb at Tel 'Ali, the lower strata at Tell esh- Shunah, Tell Abu Habil, Tell es-Sa'idiyeh et-Tahta, Tel Zaf, Kataret es-Samra, Tel Te'o, Tel Dan, Tell el-Far'ah (N), and the lower levels at Tuleilat el- Ghassul. Qatifian Ware is known at Herzliya, Qatif, Nahal Besor and Tell Wadi Feinan. This period, which continued for some 800 years, represents a gradual transition from the Wadi 305</page><page sequence="323">Rabah to the Ghassulian Chalcolithic. This change is reflected in the fact that assemblages of relatively early sites such as Tel Zaf preserve qualities more typical of Wadi Rabah Ware like burnish, incised decoration and the bow-rim jar, while later sites in the sequence such as Tell el-Mafjar and Tel 'Ali lb are characterized by Ghassulian Chalcolithic fea- tures, such as V-shaped bowls and a variety of pierced handles. Additional characteristics of the material culture in Middle Chalcolithic settlements at various sites include the following: 1 Stone-lined silos and bricks with a plano-convex section. 2 Simple basalt chalices. 3 Built cist tombs, such as those at Kabri (Prausnitz 1969), "néolithique récent" Byblos (Dunand 1973) and Tabaqat el-Buma (Banning et al. 1992). 4 The use of jars for infant burials at several sites, e.g. Tel Dan, Qatif, Tel Te'o and Kabri. The Late Chalcolithic This phase is the best known of all the cultural units surveyed here and I shall therefore not go into great detail. General background appears in any intro- duction to the region's archaeology (e.g. Kenyon 1960; Aharoni 1978; Mazar 1990; Ben-Tor 1992). This period is outstanding in its manifestations of artistic expression, including wall paintings, ivory carving, violin-shaped figurines, basalt vessels, metal artifacts and pottery. In the past, it was popularly believed that the Late Chalcolithic peoples were immigrants who arrived with a mature culture from their land of origin. This view has not been proven, for no cultural center from which the bearers of the Ghassulian tradition could have derived their inspiration has come to light. With the clear definition of the Middle Chalcolithic phase, whose culture includes the jar burials, basalt vessels, large V-shaped bowls, pierced handles and pithoi that are also typical of the Late Chalcolithic, a local origin for the Ghassulian culture is now accepted. 7.4. RADIOMETRIC DATING Data from radiometric dating of the four periods covered in this work will be presented and analyzed here. These dates are based on measurement of the concentrations of the 14C isotope in samples of organic material, such as wood, charcoal and bone. Uncalibrated radiometric dates appear with the lower-case letters bee, while calibrated dates are designated BCE. The fact that the dates obtained are sometimes inaccurate for a variety of reasons raises a difficult methodological question: when should radiometric dates be accepted and when rejected? This problem is illustrated by the following two examples: 1 A radiometric date of 3750 bee from the Early Chalcolithic site of 'Ein el-Jarba has been accepted by many researchers (Moore 1982; Gilead 1990: 55), while others regard it as a thousand years too late (Kirkbride 1971). 2 A radiometric date of 4090 bee from Qatif is regarded by some as reliable (Gilead 1990), but by others as approximately 500 years too late (Gopher and Greenberg 1987: 112). The following considerations must be kept in mind: 1 Experience has shown that reliable dating for an archaeological unit is one based on a series of several samples rather than a single date. 2 It is preferable that the samples be tested at more than one laboratory. This provides a control for the preparation of the sample and the testing procedure. 3 Methodology has improved at physics labora- tories and the new dates are more reliable than ones from the 1960s and 1970s. These considerations have determined my attitude toward the published radiometric dates from different sites. Where the data are contradictory, preference is given to a series of dates rather than a single date, and to newer dates rather than older ones. Radiometric dates for each of the four periods are grouped in separate tables. The analysis of the dates examines their compatibility first with the given group and subsequently with the dating of the preceding and following phases. The radiometric dates given here are uncali- brated; only after a chronological range has been established for each period are the opening and closing dates calibrated. Though the calibration is based on the calibration system of Evin, as presented here in Table 3 (Evin 1995), I do not in all cases accept his division into periods or the dates he proposes. 306</page><page sequence="324">The Pottery Neolithic Before dealing with the beginning of this phase, let us examine what is known about the end of the Pre- Pottery Neolithic. Radiometric dates obtained from numerous sites indicate that the Pre-Pottery Neo- lithic B ended at the end of the 7th millennium bee, ca. 6100 bee. Dates from the next phase, generally known as the Pre-Pottery Neolithic C, are presented in Table 23. There are 22 dates, ranging from the end of the 7th millennium bee through the entire first half of the 6th millennium bee. (The date from Yiftahel is somewhat later than this, but it has a large standard deviation.) On the basis of these dates, we may date the beginning of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic C (and the end of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B) to around 6100 bee and the end of this phase to the mid 6th millennium (5600) bee. Calibration of the dates yields ca. 7000-6400 BCE, a period of some 600 years, for the Pre-Pottery Neolithic C. In Table 24, dates from Yarmukian sites and southern coastal plain sites of the Pottery Neolithic are presented; these dates are later than those of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic C. Fourteen radiometric dates are available from five Yarmukian sites: Sha'ar Hagolan, Munhata, Byblos, 'Ain Rahub, 'Ain Ghazal and Nahal Qanah Cave. Twelve dates fall within the second half of the 6th millennium bee. The date from 'Ain Ghazal is completely anomalous and one date from Byblos is later than all the rest (4700 bee) and may therefore be rejected. The dating of the Yarmukian sites to the entire second half of the sixth millennium bee, ca. 5600-5000 bee, does not contradict the known dates for the Pre- Pottery Neolithic C (Table 23) or Early Chalcolithic (Table 25). Calibration of these dates provides a range of 6400-5800 BCE, a 600-year period. No radiometric dates have yet been published for Jericho IX sites. As this is a culture parallel to the Yarmukian in both flint and pottery typology, it seems that these sites should also be dated to the range of 5600-5000 bee uncalibrated, 6400-5800 BCE calibrated. Two sites in the southern coastal plain, Nizzanim and Giv'at Haparsa, provided three radiometric dates (Table 24). The two dates from Giv'at Haparsa are considerably later: one falls in the 3rd millennium bee and the second at the end of the 5th millennium bee with a standard deviation of 1200 years. Clearly, these are particularly problematic dates which cannot be accepted. The date from Nizzanim is some 300 years later than the accepted dates for the Pottery Neolithic and clearly falls into the period of the accepted dates for the Wadi Rabah culture (Table 25). Therefore, the single, less recently obtained date from Nizzanim should be rejected in favor of the five more recently obtained Yarmukian dates. Since sites dated to the Early Chalcolithic (Wadi Rabah) are known in the southern coastal plain, one might claim that Giv'at Haparsa and Nizzanim are contemporary with Wadi Rabah but continue to preserve the Pottery Neolithic material culture. This explanation would make it possible to accept the radiometric date from Nizzanim, but would result in a settlement vacuum in the southern coastal plain during the second half of the 6th millennium bee. The Early Chalcolithic Six radiometric dates exist from two sites character- ized as belonging to the Wadi Rabah culture: Ard Tlaili in Lebanon and 'Ein el-Jarba (Table 25). Four dates from Ard Tlaili constitute a comprehensive, reliable sequence, all falling into the first third of the 5th millennium bee. The two dates from 'Ein el- Jarba, on the other hand, are problematic: 1 The date 2900 bee falls within the Early Bronze Age and has already been rejected by the excavator himself (Kaplan 1969). 2 The date 3750 bee is disputed; though it was accepted as reliable by the excavator and several researchers regard it as the chronological boundary between the Wadi Rabah culture and the Ghassulian culture (Moore 1982; Gilead 1990: 55), there is also a suggestion that it is about a thousand years too recent (Kirkbride 1971). Ard Tlaili is, at this point, the only site related to the Wadi Rabah culture for which a series of radio- metric dates exists. These dates do not overlap the dates of the Pottery Neolithic (Table 24) or those of the Middle Chalcolithic (Table 26). On the basis of Ard Tlaili, the Wadi Rabah culture should be dated to the beginning of the 5th millennium bee, around 5000^4700 bee. Additional radiometric dates (un- published) obtained from recently excavated sites are later than those from Ard Tlaili; they appear to show that the Early Chalcolithic period lasted until ca. 4600-4500 bee.

At the underwater sites of Neveh Yam, Kefar Samir and Kefar Galim, several radiometric dates fall into the range of the first half of the 5th millennium bee (Table 28). At the site of Neveh Yam, Wadi Rabah sherds were found; however, Jericho IX vessels of the Pottery Neolithic and cultural elements characteristic of the Middle Chalcolithic were also collected there. Thus, the date from Neveh Yam cannot be utilized as proof of the date of Wadi Rabah Ware. At other sites, the nature of the pottery has not been reported. There- fore, it is unclear to which material culture the many dates from underwater sites should be related. The Middle Chalcolithic Twenty-four dates are available from six sites, Tel Zaf, Tuleilat el-Ghassul, Qatif, Tell Wadi Feinan, Tabaqat el-Buma and Tel 'Ali (Table 26). From Tabaqat el-Buma there is a series of ten dates from a stratigraphie sequence (Stratum 16 to Stratum 5). Both dates for Stratum 16 are problematic, as one is very early and the other very late. These discrepancies probably stem from the fact that the samples were from bones, which, as is well known, do not maintain their original chemical composition when in the ground. Two samples from Stratum 11, dated to 4720 and 4680 bee, are reliable as they are the earliest both in the stratigraphie sequence and in date. The sample from Stratum 9, falling around 4950 bee, is earlier than the two samples measured for Stratum 11. This constitutes a contradiction between the radiometric date and the stratigraphy and it is clear that this sample is unreliable. All the other five dates from Tabaqat el-Buma, from Strata 9 to 5, fall into the range of 4600-4200 bee. It is possible that there are also remains of the Early Chalcolithic period at the site. However, since the preliminary reports have not yet presented clear pottery assemblages, the nature of the material finds of the early stages cannot presently be established. Fourteen additional dates come from four other sites: Tuleilat el-Ghassul, Qatif, Tell Wadi Feinan, Tel Zaf and Tel 'Ali. They all fall into the period of 4700-3800 bee. Two dates overlap those of Wadi Rabah Ware: the date from Tel Zaf and the early date from Tuleilat el-Ghassul. The date from Tel Zaf has a particularly large standard deviation (± 470). The date from Qatif, which has been questioned (Gopher and Greenberg 1987), fits in well here. The four dates from Tel 'Ali lb range from 4000-3800 bee. These are the latest of the dates for the Middle Chalcolithic and give an indication of the date of its end, in the first quarter of the 4th millennium. Since this is a series of four dates which were recently obtained, they are most probably reliable. When we examine the radiometric dates from Late Chalcolithic sites (Table 27), we can see that most center around the mid 4th millennium and only three, from Shiqmim, Abu Hamid and Nahal Qanah Cave, fall at the end of the 5th millennium bee or the very beginning of the 4th millennium. On the basis of all these data, the range of the Middle Chalcolithic should be set as 4500-3800 bee uncalibrated. Calibration of these dates gives a range of 5300-4500 BCE. Thus, the Middle Chalcolithic lasted some 800 years. Dates from the underwater site of Megadim (Table 28) fall within this range, but no details of the nature of the material culture at this site are available. The 800 years of the Middle Chalcolithic separate the end of the Wadi Rabah culture and the beginning of the Ghassulian Chalcolithic. Clearly, we must reject the idea that "the data indicate that the Wadi Rabah culture continued to 309</page><page sequence="327">Table 26. Radiometrie datings of the Middle Chalcolithic period.

The Late Chalcolithic Table 27 gives 64 radiometric dates for this period, more than those of all the other three periods combined. Three dates from Shiqmim, Abu Hamid and Nahal Qanah Cave, which fall around 4200- 3900 bee, seem too early, while six dates within the 3rd millennium bee appear to be too late. The remaining 55 dates fall within the 4th millennium bee. These radiometric dates have been discussed in considerable detail in two studies (Gilead 1994; Joffe and Dessel 1995). The general range is clear and it is accepted that the Ghassulian Chalcolithic began around 3800 bee and continued up to 3100 bee uncalibrated. Calibration of these dates gives a range of 4500-3600 BCE, indicating that the Late Chalcolithic lasted for some 900 years. This is longer than the other periods and perhaps explains why a larger number of pottery types developed during the Late Chalcolithic (Table 22). 310</page><page sequence="328">Table 27.
