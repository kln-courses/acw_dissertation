<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SPIRITS OF THE DEAD An introduction to the ancestor worship of the Sukuma of Tanganyika R. E. S. TANNER Musoma, Tanganyika I. LIFE AND THOUGHT The Sukuma are pastoral agriculturists living on the semi- arid steppe of north western Tanganyika, administratively di- vided into a series of loosely federated chiefdoms. So far they have been little influenced by either Christianity or Islam and continue to practice their own form of ancestor worship which is the subject of this paper. It is essential before we pass to a consideration of their actual religious practices, to understand what they regard as the prin- ciples of life and to proceed from that to their worship and the reasons for their beliefs. In the absence of a written tradition their beliefs have wide variations and few Sukuma have given thought to such prob- lems so that it is only from the everyday phrases exemplifying certain words that a loosely coherent system can be constructed. If we ignore for the moment the supernatural forces which mould the intentions of a human being, the chain of causation from desire to action is from the heart to the brain which trans- lates the desire into action. The heart itself is the centre of life maintained by the breath. Breath lives within the body and looks after it so that when it leaves they say that death follows and that shortness of breath accompanies weakness; in fact breath is given to man so that he may work, and is the force which holds the body erect. Although breath is in every part of the body, it comes from in- side the heart - myuyi ikingaga mu moyo. If a man dies the Sukuma say that his breath is finished - munhu uyu washilaga myuyi - and following on this that breath not only looks after life but also death as well. Each man has his own breath with which he is born and which is not the same as that of anyone else. Breath increases with the growth of the body and sickness is regarded as the out- ward expression of the breath's illness. 108</page><page sequence="2">SPIRITS OF THE DEAD 109 It seems that the Sukuma word covers both the Swahili word for soul - royo - and for breath. Nevertheless the breath has no evil or good intentions and is not the soul as we understand it; possibly a better interpretation would be that it is the spirit of life. The heart experiences the desires and wants of the man and passes that knowledge to the brain and then, through the func- tioning of the body, the breath gives expression to the action. The heart would say: "today my heart dislikes this sort of food and prefers this" - lelo moyo gwane gututogwa shilebe, gulitogwa shilebe dudu. When the man is not sick it is his heart which picks and chooses. The heart then in this aspect has the work of considering intentions of a bodily nature but not those of a moral or spiritual aspect. Although the function of the brain is to follow that of the heart, they are in a sense thought to work together so that from this combination comes activity. It is the work of the heart to look after the physical welfare of the body and they under- stand that if the heart does not make known the troubles of the body then the individual will die. The heart also functions as a part of the personality when they say: "my heart is happy," - moyo gwanne gwayega - or "my heart does not want to deal with him," - moyo gwanne gwitaga kitima. It is also the excuse for forgetfulness when they say: "my heart meant to do something but forgot," - moyo gwanne gwakabaga - or as a polite way of expressing a di- vergence of opinion when they say: "our hearts are of the one type but our intentions are different," - mnzoyo ise ili imo kihamo, lelo ng'horo jikilile. The badness of a man is not anything which is inherent in his own character or which they can attribute to him in a di- rectly personal sense. They regard this badness as being of the heart, while the heart itself is said to express the intentions of the spirit of life. Some state that the heart in its known activities has four divisions. There is first the man who lives with his heart for the whole of his life, which they express as the well-intentioned and good-hearted person, - ng'horo yakwe ya wiza no. Sec- ondly there is the person who on one day gets on well with his fellows and on the next day behaves as a mean person, his heart is in fact two-sided - ng'horo yakwe kiti kasaji. Then</page><page sequence="3">110 ANTHROPOLOGICAL QUARTERLT there is the man who lives all the time without any happiness towards his fellows, - the sullen-minded person - ng'horo yak- we ya bubi no. Finally, there is the man - ntubu - who pre- fers to live on his own the whole time. It should be noted that the spirit of life is regarded as existing separately from the heart, which expresses its intentions. Rather more important, however, is the fact that the Sukuma describe the activities of the heart only in relation to other people. There is no idea that the heart can have a moral goodness independent of society. It can be good only in relation to the society in which the individual lives. The heart expresses the intention of the spirit of life and acts as the motive force which allows the brain to function. Thus for example if a man is cheated, the heart acts on the spirit of life's annoyance, which in turn works the brain to ac- tually make the complaint. It is interesting to note that the brain occupies a subordinate role, which fits in well with their conception that the individual is very much a creature of his destiny. There is little that he can do which will alter the unfolding of his life as it might have been laid down by the spiritual forces to which he is at all times subordinate. The first sentence of a text on the role of the brain states categorically that a brain exists in anything which walks, and that it exists to consider what is given out by the heart before it is passed into action. The Sukuma also state that a man without a brain cannot be a complete being. Nevertheless they distinguish between the brain - bongo - and intelligence - masala. They divide the outward expression of the brain into four. There are the simple-minded - masala mado; the mad - masala kuduhu; the intelligent person - muhu wa masala; and lastly the person who has to make an effort to think - masala gakwe ga kuchuchuba. The brain helps the man to speak what is in his heart after properly considering it, but the man who speaks without think- ing is the stupid one since he does not use the brain which he is supposed to use. There can be no direct communication with the brain other than passing through the heart, so that it cannot work alone either as a recording agent or as an activating principle. Read-</page><page sequence="4">SPIRITS OF THE DEAD 111 ing is done through the heart just as is a problem of arithmetic; the heart is in every case the vehicle on which the other facul- ties ride and without which they become immobilised. The Sukuma give considerable attention to the shadow - ng'wengeji - of a man which they regard as a sign of his life. They state quite categorically that a dead man has no shadow; for this reason the wizard will take a part of a living man's shadow in order to kill him by witchcraft. They say that the shadow is bodily health - ng'wengeji hu bupanga - and that a corpse has no shadow - ng'wengeji gutilonga ha mimba. Some informants went so far as to say that a corpse, which would be set up in the sun, would have no shadow. One man, who wanted to make a proper experiment and tried to get near to a corpse on its way to the grave, was sharply dealt with by the relatives of the dead man who thought he was trying to get material for witchcraft activity. Their theories of causation show a marked passivity in that the brain is subordinate to the functioning of the body of which the heart is the motivating principle. For the carrying on of his life, the individual is dependent on supernatural forces of which the ancestors are probably the least powerful agents in Sukuma cosmology, although they figure in the greater part of the individual's religious practice. II. THE LINEAGE A potential ancestor spirit is in the blood of every man and be- comes active after his death. All the spirits of his ancestors are in his blood and in the blood of his relatives. If a man dies without child, the spirit of the dead man goes to his brothers by reason of the blood relationship through father and grandfather; it is not necessary for him to die in order that his spirit be present in the body of his son, and they allege that a living man by this means is able to affect another living relative. As descent is patrilineal there could be no continuance of the life through daughters who, upon marriage, become attached to other lineages. Nevertheless, the married women still remain members of their own lineages and are able to take part in the ritual activities of their own families. Only one case was encountered in which the true lineage had</page><page sequence="5">112 ANTHROPOLOGICAL QUARTERLT been falsified in order that the inheritance of a chieftainship should be passed down in direct line. The circumstances were these: a chief in the past had had only one child, a girl; he prevented her from marrying; in the course of time she bore an illegitimate son which then belonged to her father and not to the genitor; the chieftainship was thereby kept in the family of the old chief. A man's spirit is within him and looks after him but is not located in any particular part of him. It can maintain the man in good health, but it does not help a man to think or feel, abilities reserved to the activity of the heart. A good harvest or intelligent cultivation is not the result of the direct help of the ancestors. Juma Ndamulo and his classificatory brother had signed on as recruits for the King's African Rifles without their father's per- mission. The night before they left for the depot they went home to say good-bye to their father. The father asked them who would look after him when they had gone, but his son said that he could not withdraw now as he had signed on. The father was quite dogmatic, insisting that his son would not be accepted and would return home, regardless of what Juma might say. Later when they were leaving, the cow of the lineage dedi- cated to the spirits followed them down the path for several miles. When Juma got to the depot, he only stayed there three days and was discharged on medical grounds. Even ten years later he still regarded this as the perfect example of the ances- tors' spirits taking action for the benefit of the family. The spirits know the sex of the child before it is born and they base their intentions on this knowledge. As soon as the birth occurs they know whether the child will follow their wishes or not - knowledge which they were prevented from having prior to the event by the possibility of a miscarriage. Although the child may be new-born, it can still have definite obligations towards its own ancestors. If it denies these at birth, then before striking the ancestors will wait until the child has grown up and is doing well. Although name-giving is usually done soon after birth, names may be changed later in life because of illness which has been attributed by divination to a dereliction of filial duty. At the time of such name-changing, the person will be asperged by</page><page sequence="6">SPIRITS OF THE DEAD 113 the head of the lineage, who will make an invocation to the ancestors: "I am summoning my ancestors, I am calling them because of the name of your child here. You are wanting him to be called Masanja and from today this will be his name. This was as you wanted and from now on leave him alone that his family may increase and gather property and that he may regain health with plenty of food." There is no need for him to use the name in everyday life as the formal ceremony and the mention of the name therein is sufficient to alleviate the troubles from which he has been suffering. After the child has been born, the ancestors come and look at the child to see its intelligence before the coming-out-of-the-house ceremony, at which it is given a name which they themselves may have decided upon before the birth. If the birth is difficult the child is thought to be refusing to acknowledge the power and position of his ancestors, and they in their turn despair that he will be one of them. Accordingly the ancestors pin their hopes on another subsequent child to take the wanted name. When the child is called by the name willed by a particular ancestor, all the ancestors are informed so that none of them will be angry. A man will only take names from the male side of his family and a woman from the female line. There is no limit to the number of names which any indi- vidual can take on and some men have been through the cere- mony as often as four times. The importance of names cannot be overstressed as the name rather than the individual is the operative element on which most of his ritual life before and after death will depend. This fact is emphasized in witchcraft, where it is essential not only to obtain something of the individual to be bewitched or some- thing which he has used, but also to know his full name. Other- wise the magic will be ineffective. The study of texts seems to suggest that, although a person's father may have an operative ancestor spirit, in actual practice the taking of names is always referred to as from grandparent to grandchild. It should be noted, however, that there is tele- scoping of generations beyond this so that all ancestors may be referred to collectively as grandparents. There is a continuity of the parent relationship carried on</page><page sequence="7">114 ANTHROPOLOGICAL QUARTERLT from life into death, but it is no longer centered on individuals, and the loves and hates of the family life of this world are projected onto the ancestors more as a corporate body than as a collection of individuals. The concentration of propitiation on unknown ancestors by the descendents, who have been suffer- ing from their activities, supports this conclusion. The recently dead parents are actively used as links with the mass of an- cestors preceding them. If the child is doing poorly in the days immediately after its birth, this will most certainly be taken as a sign of ancestor action. The infant then will be made to dribble into the bill of a young chicken which will be taken to a diviner for harus- piciation. This will tell the parents the cause of the sickness, which would usually be attributed to the need to name the child after an ancestor. In the diagnosing of the causes of a child's illness, it is regarded as particularly significant should the child not cry during the early morning before dawn, as it is then that the ancestors are present in the compound. Another feature is the neglect of the dead as individuals in contrast to the remembrance of them as ancestors. For instance, there is the lack of attention to graves which are unattended almost from the time of the funeral. No visits or periodic sweep- ings are required of the descendants unless they should be par- ticularly prescribed by diviners. Except for the graves of chiefs, or occasionally as a result of divination, the graves in general are not the scene of ceremonies. The living and the dead have an essential and continuous unity in which the two are interdependent. Each depends for its existence on the other, so that the higher the social standing of the descendant the greater the number of ancestors with whom he has to keep in touch. III. ANCESTOR BEHAVIOUR In their attentions to ancestors, the Sukuma do not seem to take particular care with the agnatic line; all or any of a man's ancestors may be called into prominence and propitiated. As inheritance is normally from father to son, it seems strange that this line is not stressed to the exclusion of others. Marriage is</page><page sequence="8">SPIRITS OF THE DEAD 115 allowed within the lineage except for those having great-grand- parents in common. Consequently there may be a considerable number of common ancestors beyond that degree which would tend to make ancestor worship cognatic rather than agnatic. Nevertheless a great many propitiation ceremonies are for female ancestors and it is probable that, as the women lose their kinship in their children, there may be a degree of counter- balancing, through their predominance in such ceremonies. It could also be looked upon as a belated retribution for such in- justices as they, the female ancestors, may have suffered in their lives. In their ideas on causality, benevolent and evil forces are not equally divided between the various spiritual agencies. In their investigation of illness and misfortune, there is no known direct line of causality which they and their diviners can follow for all matters. Rather there is a process of elimination which removes possible causes one by one and allows them eventually to hit on the remedy which is the true cure for ill health or misfortune in that particular context. As an influence for good and evil the position of the ancestors is much more complex. It is doubtful if the people have any conception of good and evil abstract forces which are equally valid at all times and places. The average Sukuma would seem to grade his ideas of right and wrong according to the degree of relationship which he has to the person in the context. Since his primary obligations are to his own family and diminish with increasing kinship distance, it follows that the presence of an- cestors must be a sanction on the behaviour of the individual which can, in this context, be described as moral. The unit for ancestor worship is almost always the unitary family, except for the chief, who is the leading descendant of the dominant clan in each chiefdom and whose relationship with his ancestors in the past concerned the welfare of the whole chiefdom. Now little interest is taken in these activities relating to the chief's ancestors, in comparison to the past when they were the very centre of the life-cycle of the chiefdom. Nowadays the chief is under the eye of an alien administra- tion and usually considers rightly or wrongly that it would be inadvisable for him to take part in such ceremonies. The chief has a deputy under customary law, whose role has changed</page><page sequence="9">116 ANTHROPOLOGICAL QUARTERLY to that of a substitute for the chief when these ceremonies are carried out in semi-secrecy in response to emergencies such as wide-spread drought or cattle sickness. Although the ancestors are dominant in the ritual life of these people, they are relatively weak in their powers and they are never considered to have any direct control over the forces of nature; in fact they have no overall control over any par- ticular facet of life and are themselves considered to be ultimately dependent on the Supreme Being and other non-ancestral spirits. There is no idea that the ancestors will automatically look after their descendants and that illness and death are a result of their inattention. There is the necessity of intercession since the good will of the ancestors is essential. Magic medicines, however well divined, may be ineffective by themselves. Regular everyday ritual directed to the ancestors is no longer considered a necessity in order to obtain a pleasant and satis- factory life, and, even in the more out of the way parts, it is no longer carried out. Perhaps there never has been regular ritual as such and the informants may have attributed to the past all the ideal aspects of life which they find to be absent from their present existence. Today both the educated and uneducated persons can and do neglect their ancestors for years and only consider propitiating them when they are in trouble. The ancestors themselves are very capricious and do not appear ever to complain of neglect in general but only of some particu- lar desire that has not been followed, - a desire which in the majority of cases could not have been anticipated. Possibly neg- lect is not quite the correct word; it may be rather that they wish to be remembered in some particular way because of some- thing which was done to them during their lives. In a Sukuma's life, which may be pleasant and successful with plenty of cattle and a large family, there is never the sug- gestion that this well-being is in any way related to the number of propitiation ceremonies which the householder has performed. Only in the case of the magician whose art depends on the ac- tive cooperation of his ancestors, can it be said that he has been in an active and satisfactory communion with his ancestors. Such well-being may be related to the fact that on the one hand his ancestors have not noticed it or rather have refrained from</page><page sequence="10">SPIRITS OF THE DEAD 117 doing evil, and, on the other, its existence is due more to the actions of the Supreme Being and his subordinate spirits. They have no firm idea of when the spirit of a dead man becomes active after his death and there are no ceremonies in which his spirit is activated into the community of the an- cestors. They acknowledge that his powers are latent and some say that he can begin to influence the living as early as six months after his death. In other tales they do suggest that the spirit of the dead man does remain in the area of his home for a time and that under certain circumstanaces he can be both seen and felt. However, we must examine these folk tales against the back- ground of their social life. A man is never on terms of great intimacy with his father and it is thought that such attitudes would vitiate some of the other practical aspects of their re- lationship. The father is also too near to the living to be con- sidered as a spirit in a group of spirits. The grandparent is a more distant relative in years, while at the same time his role is one of personal intimacy with the grandchild. Thus it seems likely that the spirit does not become active until there is a gap of one generation between the deceased and the living. In actual fact the question may be largely an academic one. Although propitiation ceremonies may be addressed to a single ancestor, there is a marked reluctance to single out that ancestor by name, from fear of antagonizing the others, and invocations are usually addressed to them as a whole. IV. IN EVERYDAY LIFE A further link between the ancestors and their descendants is the practice of keeping a particular head of cattle, a goat, or a sheep in their remembrance. These animals are usually cattle, - ng'ombe ya kwitongeleja, - and are annointed by the head of the family at the beginning of a propitiation ceremony. Such animals are kept separate from the other animals herded by the family and are known by name, to which as often as not they answer when called. They are never slaughtered and are kept until they die, at which time their meat will be eaten only by the members of the family as a whole and not merely by those in the agnatic line. The milk from such a dedicated cow</page><page sequence="11">118 ANTHROPOLOGICAL QUARTERLY can only be drunk by those who have spent the previous night in that family's compound or by the family itself. Their dedication of an animal is not obligatory on every family but follows upon a chain of misfortune and the divina- tion which accompanies all their ritual actions. On the death of one such animal, another would not be put in its place until and unless the family suffered another misfortune and was ad- vised to dedicate another beast to a particular ancestor. A wealthy family will dedicate a cow, but a goat would be sufficient for other families with less stock. A woman in trouble will dedicate a sheep to her ancestors, and sheep are seemingly used only in ceremonies which are connected with women. In addition to the use of live-stock for continuous ancestor remembrance, the Bukwimba clan have dogs dedicated to their ancestors and use them in the same way. The clan founder was stated to have been a great hunter with the help of his dog and to have been very upset when it died and he took another one in remembrance of it to' continue his hunting, which then became a clan tradition. The Bwela clan have much the same practices with snakes. They, however, do not keep snakes in the house as members of the Buyeye secret society are accustomed to do. The snake visits the family to give them greetings from the ancestors but does not usually come unless there is something wrong, in which case it would appear near a sick person. The house owner will asperge it and it would never be harmed. Such a snake need not belong to any particular species. An informant who saw a snake sleeping beside a young baby took a stick to kill it. The mother saw him and shrieked at him to stop because, she said, the snake was her relative. Many tales are told of snakes, sleeping in spirit houses, or which have responded to invocations and have not hurt anyone. Shrines dedicated to the family's ancestors are a feature of large numbers of house compounds and are reproductions in miniature of the type of house in which the Sukumas may have lived in the past. They are frameworks of branches or grass hutches standing up to three feet high, with an additional variety consisting of flat stones set up in cromlech form. The tops of these shrines are sometimes decorated with objects such as heart- shaped hoes, the necks of pots and branches of thorns, in order</page><page sequence="12">SPIRITS OF THE DEAD 119 to show that the ancestors of the family are connected with chiefly clans. Although for specific reasons these may be set up at the gateways of compounds, they are usually placed in any empty space between the huts and are not in any way venerated in the daily life of the compound. The erection of such shrines is likewise the result of misfor- tune and the consequent divination of its cause, and, once built, they seem to have fulfilled their primary purpose. They are not repaired except as a result of a subsequent divination in connec- tion with renewed misfortune. Children climb on them, goats sleep in them, and they often have a bedraggled appearance. The average family would be contented with one shrine. However, according to the amount of interest in and reliance of the family on its ancestors, the number may increase. Some magician might have as many as twenty shrines scattered around his compound to testify to his spiritual connections. V. PROPITIATION CEREMONIES Ceremonies of propitiation are not indulged in without re- course to divination, and even in divining the cause of an ill and recommending a ceremony, they must be careful that the other unnamed ancestors will not be offended by the attention paid to one of their number. In the course of a disease, if the sick man is holding his own, this may be because the majority of the ancestors are battling with the ancestor who caused the trouble, and that is the reason why he has not died. The effect of a ceremony in such a situation would be to ignore the help which some ancestors were giving, and to antagonize them rather than to get the man well again. The spirits of the dead are definitely anthropomorphic in character and action, and there is a clear dividing line between them and the Supreme Being on the one hand and the cluster of non-ancestral spirits on the other who are no longer classifiable by human characteristics. The remembrance of their ancestors usually takes an all-em- bracing form and they are addressed as bakurugenji, ancestors, or as brothers, - badugu. Although the names of their ances- tors can be quoted to the enquirer, they were never heard to be used in propitiation ceremonies.</page><page sequence="13">120 ANTHROPOLOGICAL QUARTERLY The centre of Sukuma ritual practice is the sacrifice, which varies between a small libation of water and flour to the slaughter of a bull, depending on the status of the propitiator and the im- portance of the initiating trouble. Both to the onlooker and the participator it signifies the unity of the living in family groups as well as their continuity as one with their ancestors. The sacrifice has a social function independent of its ritual value. The compound at the time of the ceremony will contain a number of family relatives who have been specifically called to take part in it, but a significant feature is the role of senior elder of the parish who will bless the initiator or the ceremony before it commences. There will also be present the men from the neighboring compounds as well as the elders of the surround- ing parish. It serves as a form of social cement while at the same time allowing the holder of the ceremony to pay back hospitality which he has received in the past. Apart from any other consideration the Sukuma have a pas- sion for meat, and the holder of a sacrifice is, at least for that day, the centre of the social life of his community and he must benefit indirectly from the ceremony. The magician who car- ries out numbers of ceremonies in the name of his ancestors is not only establishing himself as a person with whom the ances- tors are in strong communion, but becomes a dominant person- ality in his community which must also contribute to his material success as a satisfactory diviner. This factor becomes all the more important when it is realized that the old system of status promotion through feasting is gradu- ally breaking down. The gap thus left as well as the function of these feasts may now have been taken up by propitiation ceremonies. Another factor inherent in the propitiation ceremony and allied usages, is the possibility of over-doing it through fear, so that repeated ceremonies do something to control a form of neurosis, which may be both psychological as well as social. Mwanza the principal town of Sukumaland, on the Lake shore, has a far larger number of magicians in its immediate neighbor- hood than are to be found in the most distant parts of the area. Possibly the function of the propitiation ceremony has changed from the relief of purely personal ills to the relief of some form of underlying social insecurity.</page><page sequence="14">SPIRITS OF THE DEAD 121 Accepting their fundamental idea that the dead and the living are one uninterrupted line, it is natural that they have affec- tion for the dead of the family both in the general and in the particular. Although so many of their troubles are thought to be due to ancestors, there does not appear to be any fear of them even when their descendants are suffering from their activities, and these ceremonies can only be described as loosely formal. It does not seem that the ancestors are considered specifically as the protectors of the family and this may possibly be a con- sequence of the non-localization of lineages which would have necessitated individual rather than lineage welfare. There is a marked degree of informality in addressing them with no display of honorifics, in fact there is often no means of telling by the language whether the Sukuma are addressing the living or the dead. The ancestors through the medium of divination ceremonies do not offer guidance and advice to their descendants, and as often as not they are asked to agree to lines of action or states of affairs which have already been decided on or carried out. The head of the family asks for their intercession with powers greater than they rather than for their help, and in general they are asked to abstain from evil rather than to bring about unexpected good. These propitiation ceremonies are not directed to relatives who can be remembered by even the oldest of the family. The relative causing the trouble comes from the distant past so that the production of his name in a divination ceremony usually occasions considerable surprise, as the name and the incidents complained of are unknown even in the tales of the lineage. The cycle of an individual ancestor in name form depends on remembrance as an individual, and considerable stress is made on the unfortunate circumstances of losing one's name. Never- theless, the individual soon fades into their group ancestry and no longer has any individuality in the social sense. VI. ANCESTOR WORSHIP AS A MORAL AND SOCIAL FORCE Although it may be supposed that the processes of ancestor worship act as a sanction on their form of morality there is no</page><page sequence="15">122 ANTHROPOLOGICAL QUARTERLY indication that the connection is close and that infringements of their code are immediately followed by supernatural action. If we considered this to be the case and found that the people relied on this connection, it would suggest that their processes of customary law were weak. This, however, is not the case as it seems that the ancestors do not act on matters which are more readily dealt by their legal processes. They are certainly not the upholders of custom in general nor do they appear to take any action in cases where particular individuals are thought to have caused general misfortune through their alleged starting of a drought. No cases have been found in which they took action in cases of adultery, theft and other private delicts. We must not forget that the ancestors are not a separate series of beings but that they are, if not one with their living descendants, at least a part of the same family in the relationship of father to son and mother to daughter. Between these categories there always exists a very wide meas- ure of tolerance and it would be hardly likely that the father would take action against his son for theft etc., nor the mother against her daughter should she disgrace the family by being caught in adultery. Very few cases can be found in which fathers or mothers have disowned their children and even then it has been caused by the children's flagrant neglect or disobedience rather than because of some more public action. The ancestors therefore are inter- ested in continuing the lineage and in its maintenance, and are only likely to take action when they feel that this unity is being disrupted. The majority of cases of ancestor possession result from their descendants neglecting them within the framework of the parental relationship. There is a sense of dependence on their ancestors as being one with them in the same family rather than an aggressive con- trol over their descendants by dominating ancestors. It is not a fact that, if the man behaves well and remembers his ancestors, they will bless him, but rather that the man will be upset by the ancestors for reasons of their own choosing which the man will not be able to find out in advance. The function of ancestor worship is not to dispose of individual troubles, but to unify the family in response to a challenge to its continuity.</page><page sequence="16">SPIRITS OF THE DEAD 123 The land is not considered as belonging to the ancestors, as none of the lineages except the dominant lineage of the chief- dom headed by the chief is in any way localized. The ancestors of the earth and any ritual associated with it are absent from their religious life. Ownership of land is only by active occupation and any conception of ritual ownership would be alien to this, apart from the fact that every lineage has a mythological charter which even in its historical sections contains many migrations. Although in the past the worship of ancestors had a very wide field of activity both geographically and socially, it is doubt- ful if nowadays it has any influence outside the expanded family. It is not to be viewed as a field of ritual collaboration overlap- ping kinship ties and extending into the necessity of neighbor- hood unity. Sometimes informants say that the murderer cannot commit such a crime without having first committed many sins against his ancestors, and it is the latter who drive him to kill. Al- though he does not usually take a knife out with him, he will take it on that day. The man who is to be murdered cannot be called to the place of killing by the ancestors of his murderer, so it is considered that he is called by witchcraft with which his own ancestors have concurred. In fact the whole thing is regarded as rather a foregone conclusion, and even more so be- cause sometimes the murder would take place in the presence of a lot of people, when by all the odds it should have been prevented. The overt reason for the murder is not the real cause, which will be provided by their ancestors. The wizard, if he has failed to kill someone through sickness, might find out the man's ancestors and attack him before the latter are aware of what is going on. The ancestors are not propitiated during the night or at midday, so such attacks would be made at these times when the ancestor spirits are not in attendance at the homes of their descendants. The idea may be that such serious public delicts must involve a priori rejection by ancestors who have no further interest in that individual as a member of the lineage. There is little attention to the purely personal side of re- membrance and it is doubtful whether any individual would carry out a ceremony for a particular ancestor purely out of</page><page sequence="17">124 ANTHROPOLOGICAL QUARTERLT affection for him as a remembered individual. This may indeed seem strange but we have been unable to discover any customs other than those connected with the funeral, which would testify to a prolongation of personal grief. It is considered that the elements of personal grief may well be acted out in the responsi- bilities of inheritance especially when there are cattle to look after in the compound. In conclusion we find that the Sukuma have no consistent cosmology but a rough theory of causation which is not specific- ally dependent on the results or failures of ancestor worship. In their worship, there is little to distinguish the living from the dead and the parent relationship becomes submerged in the ancestors as a corporate body to which it is directed. The re- lationship with the ancestors is founded on expediency within the framework of continuing remembrance as the only means of insuring survival. The ancestors act as a sanction for the maintenance of moral standards which appear to be only defina- ble in kinship terms. Their ancestor worship has no part in their knowledge of spirits and phantoms which make them frightened of the night and of lonely places. It is the key to the functioning of their culture and not a ghost story.</page></plain_text>
