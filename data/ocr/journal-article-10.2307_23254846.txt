<plain_text><page sequence="1">Intimate Bureaucracies: Roadkill, Policy, and Fieldwork on the Shoulder ALEXANDRA KOELLE Over the last twenty years, wildlife biobgists and transportation planners have worked with environmental groups and state and tribal governments to mitigate the effects of human transportation arteries on animal habitats and movements. This paper draws connections between this growing field of road ecology and feminist science studies in order to accomplish two things. First, it aims to highlight the often unacknowledged roots that the interdisciplinary field of animal studies has in feminist theory. Second, it seeks to contribute to conversations in the humanities and social sciences on roadkill and on wildlife biobgy by steering us into a world of practice that foregrounds mundane details. I approach this topic through interdisciplinary methods, including interviews with tribal and state wildlife biobgists and participation in fieldwork on a western painted turtle tagging project. Although engaging in science and formulating policy are often understandably regarded by nonspecialists as practices that distance observers from their topic, in the world of roadkill prevention, I argue that the opposite is the case. What I call "intimate bureaucracies" are formed: arrangements of papers, policies, and people that bring a world of counting, and accountability, into being. Situated knowledges are great. They counter dreams of generality and generalization. But they come with questions of transport. Where might one be situated? Where are you? Which elsewheres emerge there? And how to not stay put but move around? Imag ine transportation devices and modes of transport along with situatedness. Trains. Cold chains. The internet. Walking trails. Broken roads. Bicycles. Slow motion. The way a crow flies. And then remember that you are no crow. — Arine Marie Mol (Bauchspies and de la Bellacasa 2009) Hypatia vol. 27, no. 3 (Summer 2012) © by Hypatia, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">652 Hypatia Feminist Theory on the Road Out on the highways and single-lane roads of North America, the categories of "nature" and "culture" are hard to separate. Snakes bask on paved roads. Some get run over, and their bodies attract scavengers, who find a steady food source along the asphalt. Eagles gorge themselves on carrion, becoming so heavy that they need a running start before they can fly. Cars often hit them before they are airborne. Bighorn sheep glean salt from de-icing agents stuck in the cracks of the pavement. Bats roost under highway bridges, and the mowing that keeps grasses short along medians can increase forage for small mammals. In this way and in more subtle ones, a space designed for Homo sapiens' vehi cle transit is one simultaneously used for other purposes. The growing field of road ecology approaches the road as a distinct ecological zone, one that always provides more than mere access to somewhere else, and that interacts complexly with the area it traverses.1 One detail, for example, is that humans have the same diurnal transportation schedule as many other species. Most animals travel at dawn and at dusk—"deer-thirty"—which corresponds with our commuting rush hour. As ecology is the study of connections, road ecology traces cascading direct and indirect effects such as this one: a whole world of complexity that arises through the seemingly simple, blunt act of putting down pavement and driving cars on it.2 Biological corridors are animals' routes, multiple overlapping pathways that do not make a mark on the landscape as blatant as a ribbon of asphalt. Although some animals do use human rights-of-way, most stick to their own trails. These routes that animals travel to get from one suitable habitat to another—for food, water, to mate, or for other reasons—are species-specific. A spider's habitat and its biological corridors exist on a different scale than a grizzly's, and provide for different needs. Moreover, one species' corridor may be another's barrier: rivers and streams can be obstacles to some terrestrial animals, whereas fish clearly require them. Consequently, a biological corridor may not always be recognizable to species other than those who use it. One of the aims of road ecology is to increase highway-crossing opportunities for animals, because the human road is the most dangerous zone within a biological corridor—for owl, snake, or skink. In this paper, I do not propose a grand theory of roadkill and relationality. Instead, I foreground methodological connections between feminist science stud ies and road ecology in order to accomplish two things. First, I aim to highlight the often unacknowledged roots that the interdisciplinary field of animal studies has in feminist theory. Second, I seek to contribute to conversations in the humanities and social sciences on roadkill and on wildlife biology by steering us into a world of practice that foregrounds mundane details. The act of paying attention to such details is inherently political, along the lines of Jane Bennett's theory of vibrant matter, which posits "a vitality intrinsic to materiality as such,"</page><page sequence="3">Alexandra Koelle 653 and "the ensemble nature of action and the interconnections between persons and things" (Bennett 2010, xiii and 37). Feminist theory's shaping of animal studies, performance studies, and affect theory also inform my analysis. A decade ago Lynda Birke called for the extension of feminist theory's attention to gen der-as-performance to our understanding of human-animal relationships (Birke 2002). Since then, Donna Haraway's theory of "companion species" and Karen Barad's notion of "intra-action" have shown that relationships of all kinds define not just the interactions between humans and animals, but determine the shape and nature of those very entities themselves (Barad 2007; Haraway 2008). Lastly, affect theory, with its interest in the particular and often disavowed details of life, has its genesis in feminist theory, which regards personal experi ence and emotion as political. Roadkill is an abject topic; affect theory helps one take it seriously.3 We would also do well to note that feminism and environ mentalism do not inherently dovetail, as Stacy Alaimo reminds us.4 This paper uses feminist theory, especially feminist science studies, to make a series of prov ocations and observations about how we may better understand our inherently multispecies relationships with roadways, as roads affect animals in many ways. Roadkill in Practice and Theory Busy roads create a barrier effect and isolate populations, noise from cars impacts bird communication, and particulates from exhaust harm the respiration of ani mals and the plants on which they depend for food and shelter. Roadkill—direct mortality—is only the most apparent effect to us: the olfactory onslaught of a skunk's final, ineffective defense; the tissue-thin butterfly wings you find stuck in the grille when stopped to get gas. Yet roads' impact on megafauna alone is stag gering: collisions are the number one source of mortality for moose on the Kenai Peninsula, of barn owls in the U.K., and of the endangered Florida panther (Forman 2003, 113-22). In the United States, roughly a million deer-vehicle collisions occur annually, resulting in 200 human fatalities, 29,000 human inju ries, $1 billion in property damage, and, not least, the deaths of a million deer (Huijser et al. 2007, 1). One million is also the rough number of vertebrates who die in car collisions daily in the United States (Forman 2003, 113-22). One million, two hundred thousand people die in car accidents worldwide every year—the vast majority of them not drivers themselves (World Health Organization 2009). The United States also slaughters a million chickens every hour.5 With all these millions, why focus on roadkill? Roadkilled animals are more than isolated, abject symbols of our species' violence toward nature, but instead are evidence of one of the deadlier forms of the complex relationalities between humans and wild creatures that are brought to the fore by our intersecting mobilities.</page><page sequence="4">654 Hypatia This intersection of vectors is the entry point of geographer David Lulka's engagement with roadkill: the shared mobile nature of human and animal bodies that is so violently terminated by a collision. In his literary exploration of "dis may and persistence" engendered by viewing roadkill, Lulka focuses on "the relational situation of encountering roadkill, or better yet the 'have-not-always been-roadkill,' for the shared penchant for movement creates a bond formed from commonality" (Lulka 2008). An affective charge is created in our bodies, Lulka contends, because the animal's movement has been disrupted, something to which we can physically relate. He lucidly points out the homogenization and subsequent emotional distancing that result from use of the term roadkill, when the moment of contact or encounter is actually always irreducibly singular. Let us, then, pay attention to the singularity of the moment of impact: there is only the flattened squirrel with tail still aquiver, or the shattered body of a deer denting the hood of one's car, the adrenalin rush and fear in the driver as well as the animal. Lulka writes that "we connect with [roadkill] more deeply due to our shared propensity for mobilization (commonly synthesized as our evo lutionary heritage) than because of the exact configuration of their face and body" (Lulka 2008, 45). Here I disagree: these details matter, and often deter mine how we come to care. Barry Lopez—whose writing has been tremendously effective in cultivating American environmental sensibilities—pays attention to such "exact configuration[s]" in his elegiac poem Apologia: In eastern Oregon, along U.S. 20, black-tailed jackrabbits lie like welts of sod— three, four, then a fifth. By the bridge over Jordan Creek, just shy of the Idaho border in the drainage of the Owyhee River, a crumpled adolescent porcupine leers up almost maniacally over its blood-flecked teeth... (Lopez and Eschner 1998, unpaginated) To Lopez, what matters is the expression on the face of a dead porcupine and the shape and number of rabbits—black-tailed jackrabbits at that; he looked long enough to identify the species. They are not reducible to an idea, although they can be understood within its terms, as their "penchant for movement" is what caused their deaths and what connects our journeys to theirs. I have driven the eastern Oregon roads Lopez describes, and the animals he mourns remind me shar ply of the magpie that landed in front of my truck an instant before I hit it, and of the hundreds of kangaroo rats I flattened while driving a newly paved road to visit an ornithologist friend who was working at Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. Reminiscent of Lulka, sociologist Mike Michael's "Roadkill: Between Humans, Nonhuman Animals, and Technologies," is also interested in the semiotic plas ticity of roadkill (Michael 2004, 277). Michael's encounter with a dead badger opens up his thoughtful piece on automobility and animobility. He uses wildlife</page><page sequence="5">Alexandra Koelle 655 biology research reports to explain the magnitude of roadkill in Britain, yet road kill unfortunately slips into functioning as a metaphor for the alienation between "moderns" and "nature." I share his interest in "examining] roadkill as a means of reflecting upon the connections between human and nonhuman animals and technologies" (278). But his paper's focus on "propositions through which to grasp these complex relationalities" keeps it stuck in the "modernity versus nat ure" divide he questions. In calling for new approaches to the material, the material is not itself the generative source of these approaches. It remains bio mass, food for thought. And yet roadkilled animals are also actually food, for ravens, microbes, or one of the members of our own species who participates in the art/shock-value prac tice of roadkill cuisine.6 In his study of roadkill representation and commodifica tion, Marxist geographer Dennis Soron observes that "the stark visibility of broken animal bodies on roadways has generated mostly fatalism and disengage ment, becoming as naturalized a part of contemporary landscapes as roads and automobile traffic themselves" (Soron 2007, 111). He argues that these broken bodies are both repressed and celebrated in a sort of commodity fetishism, reap pearing as cartoon characters and stuffed animals with x's in their eyes. Roadkill circulates in our stories as well as in pop culture. When my sister worked at the Audubon Society Corkscrew Swamp Sanctuary on Florida's Gulf coast in 2005, she came close to hitting a Florida panther. The big cat crossed the road in front of her Prius in two jumps, a split-second blur between cypress trees at night. If she had been driving at or over the speed limit of twenty, there would likely be one fewer panther in the total population today, which is esti mated at only eighty to one hundred. A Montana cougar was not so lucky when, in 2009, two friends were speeding home from the "Love Your Mother Earth" music festival in the Bitterroot Mountains: they hit what turned out to be a juvenile lion, as they discovered when they turned their SUV around to move the body off the road. Intimate Bureaucracies Yet there is also good news amid the carnage. Over the last twenty years, wildlife biologists and transportation planners have worked with environmental groups and state and tribal governments to decrease the effects of human transportation arteries on wildlife habitats and movements.7 Although engaging in science and formulating policy are often rightly regarded by nonspecialists as practices that distance observers from their topic, in the world of roadkill prevention, the opposite is the case. Through road ecologists' extensive studies of a diverse and far-ranging array of animal movements and habitat types, what I call "intimate bureaucracies" come into being. These assemblages are made up of papers,</page><page sequence="6">656 Hypatia policies, and people: an agential world of counting and accountability. Intimate bureaucracies regard vehicles and roadways as complex p he no me na - i n- the - wo r 1 d, thereby countering what Soron describes as "the diffuse and incremental effects of automobile transportation ... difficult to grasp immediately as a structured whole" (Soron 2007, 122). Field research in road ecology seeks to grasp exactly this whole. Road ecology is concerned with roads as networks in the living landscape, networks that can be altered to be more responsive.8 For example, roadways can be retrofitted or designed to allow animal passage in many ways, not all of them prohibitively expensive. Although only about fifty overpasses designed for wildlife exist world wide, many thousands of underpasses not explicitly designed for animals are currently, unofficially, used by a variety of creatures. Crossing types include expanded culverts to allow better fish passage, new or wider tunnels, and length ened bridge spans over wetlands or streams. These underpasses, by virtue of their location, are invisible to the traveling motorists on the road. Left powerful yet ignorant of these alternate passages is the driver up above, who has no idea that at the moment his RV speeds over an underpass, a mountain lion may be cau tiously walking through below. "People don't really notice them, which is what we are going for," says the Transportation Director for the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes, who have recently installed 42 underpasses on the main highway through their reservation (Montana Department of Transportation 2007). We should therefore applaud the success of crossing structures that have reduced roadkill of large animals by as much as eighty percent (Clevenger 2006). I was curious about these invisible underpasses—their construction, location, and human and animal traffic—so I tracked the work of field biologists and plan ners in several ways: by volunteering on a western painted turtle mark/recapture study, through interviewing a tribal wildlife biologist, by accompanying a research ecologist, and by sustained engagement with policy documents and reports on roadkill prevention and mitigation.9 All of this research took place in western Montana.10 This paper joins an interdisciplinary conversation that takes seriously the affective and relational qualities of biologists in relation to their research subjects. One key difference separates my inquiry from other recent critical and anthropological explorations of scientists who study corncrakes and meerkats, to name just two examples.11 These field scientists, who are themselves under observation by anthropologists and geographers, operate in nontraumatic situa tions: they all study animal behavior in relatively intact environments. Roadkill and its prevention, in contrast, operate within a different set of circumstances. Road ecology in some ways resembles epidemiology and public works planning more than wildlife biology. The individual animals are representatives of their kind, but always primarily in relation to a manmade object. In other words, the relationship between the organism and the asphalt is the defining connection of</page><page sequence="7">Alexandra Koelle 657 Figure 1 Whitetail Deer in Underpass. Photo by Montana Department of Transportation, Western Transportation Institute, and the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes. the field. My attention to road ecologists—those who study how this relationship affects all others—therefore brings to the fore different questions about the inter action of scientists and animals. Road ecologists' starting perspective is not one only of respectful distance, but is shaped by urgency about how to mitigate our often fatal material infrastructure. Informed by feminist science studies work on relationality and performativity, I ask: what are the connections among science, policy, and animal as well as human lives and deaths on the road? A pressing and lively world emerges when one takes seriously the scientific and regulatory worlds that deal with roadkill. Fieldwork on the Shoulder Whisper Camel is an enrolled member of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes on the Flathead Indian Reservation. For her graduate work in wildlife biology at Montana State University, she performed a statistical analysis of deer vehicle collisions on Highway 93, which led to her current position with the Tribes' Natural Resources Department. I met Whisper at the Old Timer Cafe in St. Ignatius on a July afternoon. We sat at a picnic table under a weeping willow by a large parking lot and drank iced tea. My embarrassment about being a white academic on the reservation to interview a Native woman was mitigated (as road ecologists would say) by the timely gift I brought: a satellite dish for her boy friend Chauncey Means, the nephew of AIM activist Russell Means. It had been delivered to a mutual friend's house in Missoula, so I felt meekly helpful by</page><page sequence="8">658 Hypatia completing an errand.12 Whisper had that morning been working below Kerr Dam, trying to get rid of golden willows that had been planted by non-Indian settlers in order to "reclaim" wetlands for agriculture. The biggest rift regarding the construction of wildlife underpasses, Whisper observed, was not (as I had assumed) between their proponents and opponents. Rather, it was between engineers and construction workers on the one hand, and ecologists on the other. The design considerations and complications involved in constructing bigger culverts or different bridges often frustrated the workers and engineers. Similar to the momentum that carries one forward as a motorist and that compels animals to cross the road, road projects are measured by mileage completed. Construction bells and whistles such as underpasses slow this progress down. Indeed, the technical wrangling required of volunteers in Kathy Griffin's wes tern painted turtle mark/recapture study made our work seem at times more like that of contractors and less like the focused contemplations of naturalists. Griffin, originally from San Jose, earned her doctorate in Wildlife Biology from the University of Montana. For seven years, she conducted extensive fieldwork with western painted turtles in the Ninepipe Wildlife Refuge on the Flathead Indian Reservation, which is bisected by Highway 93. Her findings are used by the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes in their ongoing attempts to leverage funding for improved turtle crossings (Montana Department of Transportation 2008). We handled tools as much as we did the soft, striped bodies of turtles secure inside their bright green and orange shells. I got to be a "swimmer," shooing wes tern painted turtles into the net as it was dragged across appropriately named Hell Pond. I felt some initial hesitation about plunging into the opaque water, guaranteed to contain—along with hundreds of turtles—beer bottles, old wire, and other trash thrown in or blown off the highway. Many passersby honked; one man yelled out the window of his SUV: "Leave the turtles alone!"13 Whis per's outreach work on the reservation was marked by a similar irony. Tasked with educating people about animals' use of the crossing structures, she also has to avoid disclosing the exact locations of the underpasses because they contained expensive motion-sensor cameras. Once we had safely extracted the turtles from the nets, we used metal calipers to measure their upper and lower shells, determined sex (males have longer tails and longer claws), weighed them, scanned for previous markings, and recorded those details in log books. If it was a first-time capture, the turtles were marked with two elegant systems, a passive integrated transponder (PIT) tag and a series of notches drilled into the carapace. The study of turtle road-mortality rates was therefore also at the same time a test of the reliability of two different marking systems. The turtles were bright and beautiful, perfectly shaped, and struggled mildly throughout the entire procedure with an air of nonplussed determination.</page><page sequence="9">Alexandra Koelle 659 The velocity and volume of cars on the highway was the most dangerous part of the whole project, as well as the condition that necessitated the study in the first place. Moreover, the researchers were subject to the same danger as the turtles. We parked in a turnoff, and then climbed up the embankment with our nets, buckets, and processing tools and waited for a break in the traffic before awkwardly loping across. We avoided becoming roadkill ourselves only to find the stinky, smashed carcasses of turtles that weren't so lucky. Some of them had PIT tags that we read with the scanner; we recorded them in the log books: "found dead on highway." Six to seventeen percent of the total population dies this way every year (Griffin and Pletscher 2006, 35). These biologists' findings about deer-vehicle collision pat terns and turtle mortality make the specific ecology of this route apparent and quantifiable. Such attention to wildlife establishes a legible (and legitimate) scien tific claim for the need to improve road permeability. Research road ecologist Marcel Huijser explained to me that although every one is quite interested in the overpasses and underpasses being built, as a won derful win-win situation for animals and drivers, a less glamorous but just as important element of these crossings has been an object of contention: the fences necessary along the route that prevent the animals from entering the roadway, and that funnel them to the crossing structures. Unlike the invisible underpasses, fences are impossible to hide. Yet what looks like a barrier to the driver is actually a structure that makes the highway more permeable to animals, by reducing their possible points of crossing to fewer sites, but ones that guaran tee safe passage. But the nature of a fence is that in order to be effective it must be continuous. Some property owners adjacent to the highway have resisted installation of cattle-guard-type mesh on their access roads and others have Figure 2 Western Painted Turtle. Photo by Alexandra Koelle.</page><page sequence="10">660 Hypatia refused to allow fencing on or adjacent to their property. The resulting gaps in funneling devices translate quickly to increased collisions. I spent a cold March day making the rounds on Highway 93 with Marcel, down loading data from the cameras in the underpasses and marveling at his ability to determine what animals stepped on the sand-tracking beds. I was delighted to learn that most sensor cameras have traces of bear saliva on them, as the blinking red light attracts their attention. These motion-sensor cameras have captured even large animals, previously assumed to be hesitant to walk underneath the roadway, emerging from underpasses. Indeed, herpetiles, small mammals, fish, and birds need expanded culverts much more than they need overpasses. Yet more than any other feature, the improvement elements that draw national attention are the wildlife overpasses. A recent international design com petition for such bridges received extensive media coverage (ARC 2010). Never mind that these structures are prohibitively expensive and largely unnecessary— we want to see the animals crossing above, or at least see the bridge that they might cross on—we crave what philosopher Barbara Herrnstein Smith calls the "ontological thrill" of the encounter (Smith 2004, 5). However, footage of ani mals in underpasses can provide a similar virtual thrill, as is evident in the popu larity of mesmerizing motion-sensor photos of animals.14 There is something reassuring about the snapshots of badgers and bobcats going about their business, aided rather than hindered by human-made structures.15 Even less immediately visible than animals in underpasses are the intimate bureaucracies of managing roadkill, along with the wildlife biology practices that substantiate them. Yet these assemblages are the reason why a turkey could, on an overcast winter day, saunter over Animal's Bridge near Jocko, Montana, and why three river otters were able to traipse through an underpass a few miles away. Visibility and Policy Planning bureaucracies create their objects rather than simply describing them, and thereby bring worlds into being, as Timothy Mitchell has shown in his study of Egypt (Mitchell 2002). Usually the effect of planning is increased control or the furthering of a political agenda. Planning documents, Tania Murray Li notes, are a key part of the discursive apparatus of "improvement projects": workings of governmentality whose terrain is nevertheless established through the interplay of a host of unstable forces (Li 2005, 386). Although all these Foucaultian facets of power relations are operative vis-a-vis roadkill, something else is created through attention to the lives and deaths of animals. A double object comes into being: the world of their paths as they intersect with our asphalted agendas, and our databases and mitigation studies that seek to make these paths viable. Wild life biology, citizen roadkill tallies, and policy recommendations all work to</page><page sequence="11">Alexandra Koelle 661 create objects, and make visible circumstances and events—mobility, browsing preferences—in the lives of animals that would otherwise not be legible to lawmakers or administrators. Bureaucratic and academic reports make visible the production, presentation, and circulation of roadkill data and the practices of fieldwork in wildlife biology. These methods, and the acts of their compilation, pay close attention in all their specificity to animal lives and animal vectors of desire and need. Donna Haraway might describe these assemblages of papers, people, and practices as "extremely prosaic, relentlessly mundane, and exactly how worlds come into being" (Haraway 2008, 26). Jane Bennett's notion of vital materialism is also helpful in getting at the importance of these reports, since it "seek[s] to cultivate a broader definition of self and of interest" (Bennett 2010, 13)—a fitting description for careers built on studying how, why, and when animals must cross roads. Research reports that tackle the problem of animals and roads repeatedly point out that it is "important to structure the research questions to address animal-vehicle colli sions and habitat fragmentation together" (Hardy et al. 2007, 10). In other words, these studies are not concerned just with making our travels smoother, but also with ensuring the safe peregrinations of animals, for movement defines their lives as much as itineraries shape ours.16 The Western Transportation Institute's "Evaluation of Wildlife Crossing Structures and Fencing on US Highway 93: Evaro to Poison, and Finalization of Evaluation Plan" (hereafter "Evaluation" [Hardy et al. 2007]), is a compilation of data about species preferences for crossing structure design and location.17 The employees at the WTI, as well as those at the transportation departments them selves, bring to their work interests in wildlife biology, engineering, and conser vation—experiences, predilections, and motivations that shape and are shaped by the report. I suggest that "Evaluation" not be regarded only as a source of data. Nor should it be read as a narrative, exactly, but rather as an affecting compilation of road mortality studies, motivated by the hope for and weighing of possibilities for their amelioration. The details draw one in, rather than refract ing one's vision or repelling the attempt to get a sense of the broader aim: a pro ject to allow animals paths to cross ours. Movement abounds according to species and individuals' preferences. We learn that "white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) appear to adapt to and use crossing structures more readily than mule deer (Odocoileus hemoinus) ... distance to cover was significantly positively correlated to passage use for grizzly bears (Ursus arctos horribilis), elk (Cervus ela phus) and deer (Odocoileus sp.), while the correlation was negative for cougars (Felis concohr)" (Hardy et al. 2007, 7). This is delightful in its specificity, and the descriptions are compounded by the layering on of yet others. Each detail drives one closer to the animals, and also to the scientific practices of fieldwork: of getting up early, figuring out meth ods, performing field evaluations, of crouching, observing, waiting, and watching</page><page sequence="12">662 Hypatia animals, to the business of thinking about them. Regarding highway exclusion fencing, "Evaluation" cites studies that have found that "ungulates will jump fences which are too low or sag, push through openings, and even crawl under gaps— Coyotes and other small to medium size animals will crawl under gaps and bears will climb wide mesh fencing— Bears and cougars will also climb sup port poles" (Hardy et al. 2007, 10). These varied attempts of animals to cross fences—the climbing, crawling, pushing, and jumping—together with the effort of Homo sapiens to catalogue these actions, heighten our awareness that move ment is constantly afoot or a-crawl in our world. What becomes apparent above all here is the consistency and variety of itineraries just as pressing as ours: down to the river for water, back across the road for cover at night. "Evaluation'"s literature review in particular calls to mind the careful atten tion of researchers to the movements, habits, and preferences of animals. One can picture biologists carrying out painstaking seasons of fieldwork, resulting in findings that show that "[t]he size of a crossing structure has a direct relationship to the size of the animals that use it.... Smaller species tend to choose smaller passages while larger species prefer larger passages" (Hardy et al. 2007, 6). Some one did enough fieldwork to be able to observe that "Cattle guards are effective for mitigating narrow access roads, but small mammals may become trapped if they fall into the well under the guard rails without escape ramps" (Hardy et al. 2007, 10). In other words, biologists actually cared enough to monitor cattle guard wells, seeking to prevent the deaths of small mammals stuck in them. Or perhaps they didn't "care," in the sense of care-as-emotion. But "care" can be regarded as a practice of giving energy and attention to something, as feminist science studies scholar Maria Puig de la Bellacasa points out: "It is important to stay close to the material signification of caring when insisting on giving margin alized issues a voice in the staging of technoscientific mediations. Care can be easily idealized as a moral disposition, or turned into a fairly empty normative stance disconnected from its critical signification of a laborious and devalued material doing" (de la Bellacasa 2011, 95). These researchers, and the gathering of their studies, bring a world into being: one in which small mammals stuck in cattle guard wells may be considered in future road construction plans. "Evaluation" is both a record of, and itself the practice of, the "intersecting gaze" that Haraway calls for in making lab practices more responsive to, and responsible for, the needs and proclivities of animals subject to experiments (Haraway 2008, 21). The agendas of road ecologists are always determined by the desires of animals; indeed, enabling animals' agendas is the whole point of the field. And then there are the compendia of noninvasive field technologies introduced in the report: the sticky wire that catches bear hair for DNA sam pling in underpasses, the motion-sensor cameras, and sand-track beds.18 All these scientific methods were developed not by a disinterested, detached curiosity about the "natural" movement of populations, but by an inquiry shaped by a</page><page sequence="13">Alexandra Koelle 663 conservation agenda. While concerned with populations more than with individ uals, they simultaneously do their work without harming individual animals in the process. Of Categories and Counting When one reads that "in October when the track beds froze and passing animals (especially soft padded animals such as bear, canine and feline species) could not leave an imprint in the solid tracking media, monitoring was terminated" (Hardy et al. 2007, 41—42), we learn that sand tracking is an effective device for chart ing how animals approach and cross or follow the road. We also learn at the same time of a wonderful new category made germane by this technology: that of "soft padded animals such as bear, canine and feline species." We may then for a time think about "soft padded animals" a little differently, taxonomically apart, from hoofed wild animals, insects, and birds. Also conjured up in that one sentence is the field labor of scientists, who install the sand-track beds, walk the route, bend down and measure tracks, and otherwise catalogue the presence of animals. Although cataloguing is a bureaucratic practice that is often used to make over a population in the image of the more powerful group, or to otherwise exert control over its subjects, here it is different. The act of cataloguing is part of taking responsibility for our effects on animals. The word "tracking" captures this dual mode nicely—it conveys control, but also closeness, watching over, and being led by the indices of animal movement. Another technical WTI document, one that is useful to consider with the help of affect theory, is "Wildlife-Vehicle Collision and Crossing Mitigation Measures: A Toolbox for the Montana Department of Transportation (hereafter "Toolbox" [Huijser et al. 2007]), a thick, illustrated report that details thirty-nine mitigation measures. Only large species, those animals that, when hit, also may injure the driver or vehicle, are included in this cost-benefit analysis of measures to reduce roadkill.19 Small animals, including terrestrial mammals, turtles, frogs, and birds, are therefore left out; insects and other invertebrates also go unmen tioned. The cost of improving crossings for these species would always outweigh the financial benefit.20 "Toolbox" draws on previous studies of mitigations to assess their effectiveness in a variety of situations, considers their impact on habitat connectivity, performs financial calculations, and provides photographs of each type of structure. Even though the document is written in technical lan guage, its subject matter and level of detail draws one in. Maybe this is so because affect is inseparable from movement. Melissa Gregg and Gregory Seigworth explain that affect is "the name we give to those forces—visceral forces beneath, alongside, or generally other than conscious knowing, vital forces insisting beyond emotion—that can serve to drive us towards movement, toward</page><page sequence="14">664 Hypatia thought and extension" (Gregg and Seigworth 2010, 1)—a description that could be applied just as well to "Toolbox" as a document, an intervention, and a record of work in the world. "Four moose killed this summer!" exclaims an elec tronic message board in Yellowstone, depicted as an example of "enhanced sign age." Photos of cassowary crossing signs in Australia and camel warning signs in North Africa populate the document, gradually bringing into view our species' disparate, inadequate, but nonetheless ongoing attempts to stem the deaths of fellow creatures that are caused by our runaway transportation landscape. It is thus both depressing and touching, as it allows us to glimpse a world of violence seldom prioritized in its own right. The interested reader can realize another affective connection through "Tool box"'s attention to the humans in the road along with the animals: with each detail we realize that it takes two sets of action to produce a collision. In other words, roadkill is a relation, one foregrounded in "Toolbox" through its focus on the possibilities of modifying behavior—including human behavior. The report distinguishes between mitigation measures that "alter driver behavior" and mea sures that "alter animal behavior." The mitigations that are proven effective in modifying human behavior, it turns out, are just as species-specific as those used to control animal behavior. In other words, humans also respond in predictable and therefore statistically quantifiable ways that "Toolbox" considers seriously.21 "Toolbox" exhorts its readers in its own manner, that is, through scrupulous data presentation, that collisions will be greatly reduced if drivers can just be made to slow down. "If drivers are warned, the time required to react to an unu sual and unexpected event can be reduced from 1.5 seconds to .7 seconds, the report summarizes. "Increased alertness could reduce the stopping distance of 68 feet" for a vehicle moving at 55 miles per hour (Huijser et al. 2008, 14). Research on Homo sapiens suggests that novelty value and lack of habituation are the most effective tools for reducing speed, and therefore roadkill: "seasonal warning signs may reduce wildlife-vehicle collisions by as much as ~50% in the first season of use. However, driver habituation may have to be addressed in subsequent years" (Huijser et al. 2008, 21). As in any ecological system, something that affects one aspect of the biotic community has effects on others. We learn that "Carcass removal is typically applied for highway safety and aesthetics. Evaluation of the effect of carcass removal on reducing wildlife-vehicle collisions (e.g., scaveng ers) has not been studied and, to date, has rarely been considered." And yet, the practice of letting dead animals lie on the roadside may have an indirect effect of slowing down drivers, as "the presence of deer carcasses has been documented to have an effect on vehicle speed reduction" (37). Such bodily, affective responses as slowing down when driving past carcasses—arising from our own animal nat ure—help resuscitate the judicious use of anthropomorphism.22 I have argued in this paper that a performative, affective relation to roadkill is also at work in the creation of planning documents, and in the scientific</page><page sequence="15">Alexandra Koelle 665 practices of fieldwork and analysis that they address, provided one is willing to look beyond one's assumptions about "data production." Bureaucracy and science are often thought of as rule-based, sober practices. In the case of the bloody and macabre object of roadkill, however, bureaucracy and science are examples of Barad's theory of "intra-action," Haraway's "companion species," Bennett's "vital materialism," and de la Bellacasa's "matters of care." Like these theorists and like the authors of the WTI reports, I am interested in these singularities—singulari ties that in the aggregate, as we have seen in these "intimate bureaucracies," also transmit a political, affective, and bodily charge. For five years, high-school students at Two Eagle River, a tribal alternative high school in Pablo, Montana, conducted road mortality studies along the seg ment of Highway 93 that bisects prime western painted turtle habitat, the same area studied by Griffin. They found 406 turtle carcasses in 2000, 346 in 2001, 290 in 2002, 450 in 2003, and 350 in 2004 (Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes 2007, 24). Through their annual walking of the length of the corridor, and collecting carcasses from the road's shoulders and ditches, the students liter ally made the lives of these turtles count by counting them. Counting roadkill may not take much "embodied skill and experience," but it is important as a form of witnessing, as Jamie Lorimer points out in his study of corncrake cen suses in England.23 Counting also provides crucial data about the use of under passes. Indeed, DNA tests of hair samples caught in sticky wire, a method with higher status than simple counting, is actually used just to enumerate how many individuals of a species used an underpass (individuals can be difficult to tell apart in images captured by motion-sensor cameras). The Two Eagle River students' turtle-carcass census constitutes what Haraway calls for in responsible science practices: a nonmimetic "sharing of suffering" (Haraway 2008, 72). Such sharing of suffering includes multiple modes of atten tion. Some include leaning in to the details of carnage, and others are far removed from the roadway for a brief period of time, as you, dear reader, are now. Notes 1. Road ecology addresses the multiple effects of roads on biota and habitats, with two goals: increasing the permeability of roads for animals who must cross them, and decreasing the indirect effects roads have on wildlife populations. The foundational text in the field is Forman 2003. The International Conference on Ecology and Transportation (ICOET) brings together policymakers, transportation planners, researchers, and activists working on road ecology (ICOET 2011). 2. The reckless automobility of the United States, and increasingly the world, has its own vast literature. See, especially, Lochlann 2004 and Urry 2006. In this paper, I focus not on cars but on the encounters among mobile animals, the wildlife biologists</page><page sequence="16">666 Hypatia and transportation planners who study them, and the materiality of roadways them selves. The dangerous work conditions of road-construction crews, the rules governing allocation of federal and state highway project contracts, and the safety laws that per tain to drivers in construction zones are also important topics beyond the scope of this paper. 3. Sarah Ahmed notes in her methodology regarding an inverse emotion, happiness: "I would begin with the messiness of the experiential, the unfolding of bodies into worlds, and the drama of contingency, how we are touched by what we are near" (Ahmed 2010, 30). 4. Feminist science studies "reconceptualizes nature in such a way that it can no longer serve as the ground of essentialism, because it is no longer the repository of unchanging truths or determining substances but is itself an active, transforming, signify ing, material force" (Alaimo 2008, 302). 5. This is my calculation, based on the 8.63 billion broilers killed in 2010 in the United States, in addition to the layers killed after one year of production and the male chicks killed upon hatching (US Poultry and Egg Association 2011). 6. In my experience, nonscientists who encounter the topic of roadkill often turn first to discussions of its representation by artists, and then to the macabre topic of roadkill cuisine. See Michael 2004 for a discussion of these modes of engagement. 7. For details about specific projects, see Hilty et al. 2006 and Beckmann et al. 2010. 8. Two excellent literature reviews are Coffin 2007 and Kociolek et al. 2011. 9. The biologists with whom I worked have completed the following studies (this is only a partial list): Griffin and Pletscher 2006; Camel 2007; Huijser et al 2007. 10. This paper follows a spur road from a chapter of my dissertation (Koelle 2010). In the chapter "Native Sovereignty and Road Ecology on the Flathead Indian Reserva tion," I address the political and cultural negotiations among the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes, the Montana Department of Transportation, and the Federal Highway Administration in the recently completed reconstruction of Highway 93. 11. See Lorimer 2008 and Candea 2010. 12. Vine Deloria, Jr.'s classic "Anthropologists and Other Friends," remains relevant (Deloria 1988, chap. 4). For a recent assessment of the ongoing negotiations and shifting terms between anthropologists and Native communities, see Stam 2011. 13. For a history of the development of radio tagging and telemetry involving large mammals, and the public response to various invasive and noninvasive techniques in wild life biology, see Benson 2010. 14- See http://www.mdt.mt.gov/pubinvolve/us93info/post_construct.shtml for photo graphs of animals using crossing structures on Montana Highway 93 (accessed August 2011). 15.

The Western Transportation Institute is a research center at Montana State Uni versity in Bozeman.

Haraway makes this observation regarding the monitoring of hairy-nosed wom bats in Australia (Haraway 2008, 288-91). 19. A typical cost-benefit analysis reads: "If the minimum MOE [Measure of Effec tiveness] for reducing DVCs [deer-vehicle collisions] by 35% is maintained over 25 years, the estimated costs of the mitigation investments would be repaid in terms of reduced property damage, human injuries and fatalities, carcass removal costs, and loss of deer as a resource" (Huijser et al. 2007, xix). 20. Although this valuation of some species and the dismissal of others is (ironically) unacceptable to some humans, I support it for pragmatic reasons and agree with Jane Ben nett's sentiment that the political goal "is not the perfect equality of actants, but a polity with more channels of communication between members" (Bennett 2010, 104). 21. Also see Huijser et al. 2008 for how efforts to prevent roadkill are figured in both human- and animal-behavior modification terms. 22. Smith notes that "once we admit the propriety of anthropomorphizing animals at least some of the time, it becomes harder to see why we should not accept the propriety of naturalizing humans at least some of the time" (Smith 2004, 9). Bennett muses along sim ilar lines that "[m]aybe it is worth running the risks associated with anthropomorphizing (superstition, the divinization of nature, romanticism) because it, oddly enough, works against anthropocentrism: a chord is struck between person and thing, and I am no longer above or outside a nonhuman 'environment"' (Bennett 2010, 120). 23. Jamie Lorimer points out that "counting is widely recognized as one of the sim plest forms of scientific practice and is often given low epistemological status" (Lorimer 2008, 390).
