Whereas some major sanctuaries, such as the sanctuary of  Zeus at Olympia and the Asklepieion at Epidauros, incorporated rituals for  a wide variety of deities, the Argive Heraion seems generally to have had more  restricted cult activity. Indeed, previous publications give the impression that  only Hera (or more specifically, Hera Argeia) was worshipped in the sanctuary.  The evidence presented here, however, shows that in the Classical period at  least, limited cult activity at the Argive Heraion was devoted to Artemis and  an anonymous hero. INTRODUCTION  Greek sanctuaries differ considerably from one another with respect to size,  complexity, and location (within cities or small settlements, or in a variety  of rural settings—on arable plains, in marginal hill country, or even on  mountaintops or at the edge of the sea).1 They also differ in terms of sig- nificance, that is, whether they are important only for a small community or  for a single polis, or whether they have a broader, even Panhellenic, appeal.2  Another difference that has not received much attention—perhaps  because it is obvious—is that some sanctuaries focus narrowly on the cult of  one principal deity whereas others accommodate a variety of secondary cults.  The sanctuary of Zeus at Olympia and the Asklepieion at Epidauros are  examples of sanctuaries of the broadly inclusive variety, where dozens of  divinities and heroes were worshipped, chiefly through offerings or sacrifices  at altars.3 The Heraion at Perachora, on the other hand, is an example of  1.

Courtesy  American School of Classical Studies at  Athens THE HERO Among the finds from Charles Waldstein’s excavations at the Argive  Heraion in the 1890s is an inscribed black-glazed vessel with an intriguing  graffito incised on its exterior. The piece appears in the second volume of  The Argive Heraeum in a chapter by Theodore Woolsey Heermance de- voted to inscriptions on vases.10 Although the vase itself is not illustrated,  a 1:1 drawing of the inscription (reproduced here in Fig. 1) is provided.  The vase is described as a “low bowl,” but the fact that it has two handles,  one vertical and one horizontal, and “resembles in shape Furtwängler, Berl.  Cat. vi. 215”11 indicates that it is actually a type B skyphos dating to the  first half of the 5th century b.c. (see Fig. 2).12 Heermance records that the  diameter of the rim is 0.096 m and that the vessel, which was “restored  from several fragments,” has “black glaze inside and out.”13 The published drawing of the inscription indicates that the letters  generally range from 0.010 to 0.013 m high, though the omicron is much  smaller, 0.003 m. The forms of the letters are generally consistent with the  date of the skyphos. According to evidence for the Argive epichoric alphabet  assembled by Lillian Jeffery, the form of the epsilon that appears on the  skyphos was used from the first quarter of the 5th century b.c., the form  of the sigma from the end of the 6th century b.c., the form of the upsilon  10.

Yet to change  τρυ- of the Heraeum inscription to τ is entirely too violent, and no  other explanation suggested has more in its favor.16 The parallel from Mycenae cited by Heermance is an incised graffito,  reading τ hέροός ἐμ[ι] on a fragment of a black-glazed plate discovered  by Heinrich Schliemann in an upper stratum in the area of Grave Circle A  (Fig. 3).17 Though he made little of it, Schliemann correctly translated the  inscription “ich stamme vom Hero.” Figure 3. Graffito from Mycenae,  IG IV 495. After Kern 1913, pl. 8 Since Heermance, no one, to my knowledge, has compared this graffito  from Mycenae to the one from the Argive Heraion. In fact, no one seems  to have noticed the Heraion graffito at all.18 As Heermance notes, the let- ter forms of the two inscriptions are certainly similar. It is hard to believe  that their meanings are not also similar. The letters hεροος of the Heraion  piece, like those on the Mycenae sherd, must surely be the genitive form of  ἥρως, indicating that the skyphos was the property of a hero. The use of a  genitive on inscribed objects to indicate possession by a person or divinity  is well attested. At the Argive Heraion itself, there are several examples of  objects inscribed with the genitive form of Hera to indicate her possession  of them.19 The letters before hεροος, which puzzled Heermance, may be a  botched attempt to write the genitive singular article τ, but as Heermance  himself notes, this seems unlikely. I would suggest that τρυ is an abbreviation  of τρύβλιον. The term tryblion, like many other terms for ancient Greek  vessels, was not restricted to one specific shape. As it is applied to cups or  bowls, it could easily be used for the skyphos from the Argive Heraion.20  16. Waldstein et al. 1905, p. 187.

Inscriptions of this  </page> <page sequence="5"> artemis  and  a  hero  at  the  arg ive  hera ion 281 In support of this interpretation is the fact that the names of vessels  are well attested in inscriptions written on the very vessels they identify.21  A famous example is the late-8th-century b.c. kotyle from Pithekoussai,  the so-called Nestor’s Cup, whose three-line inscription indicates, at least  once, that the vessel is a ποτέριον.22 Closer to home, a 7th-century b.c.  cup from the small shrine of Hera discovered by Carl Blegen alongside  the road from the Argive Heraion to Mycenae is inscribed χς {ε}ἐμί (“I  am a chous”).23 In numerous cases where the name of the vessel is written,  it occurs with the possessive form of the name of the human owner of the  vessel. For example, on a 7th-century b.c. cup from the Athenian Agora,  the inscription reads: “I am the potērion of Tharios.”24 The combination of  a vessel name with the possessive form of a heroic or divine name seems to  have been less common. The one example known to me is in an inscription  on a 5th-century b.c. bronze ladle handle of unknown provenance, which  reads: “kyathos of Zeus.”25 Returning to the graffito from the Argive Heraion, the most interest- ing and obvious question that comes to mind is, who is the hero? Walter  Pötscher has argued that “hero” and “Hera” are etymologically linked and  that both names mean something like “ready for marriage.” He has con-  cluded, moreover, that the original consort of Hera was named “Hero” and  that their union provided the paradigm for the institution of marriage.26  Susan Langdon has taken this idea still further, suggesting that this “Hero”  may have been Hera’s original consort at the Argive Heraion.27 As Jonathan  Hall has observed, however, it “is difficult to believe that [Hera’s] liaison with  Hero was still being articulated through cult as late as the 8th century b.c.,”28  the date when cult activity is first securely attested at the Argive Heraion.29  In fact, Linear B evidence from Pylos would seem to indicate that, at least  in the southwestern Peloponnese, already in the Late Bronze Age Zeus  had become associated with Hera rather than with di-wi-ja, whose name  appears to be the feminine counterpart of Zeus.30 21.

To begin this  inquiry we might turn to the “hero cults” or “tomb cults” in the Mycenaean  chamber tomb cemetery in the immediate vicinity of the Argive Heraion.  Whereas the evidence for hero cult provided by the inscribed skyphos has  been overlooked, post-Mycenaean offerings in the chamber tombs have  drawn considerable attention from scholars attempting to understand the  emergence of hero/tomb cult in the Early Iron Age. Nicolas Coldstream,  in a now-famous article, connected the post-Mycenaean offerings in the  tombs with a heightened interest in heroes brought about by the spread  of epic poetry in the 8th century b.c.32 In more recent years, scholars have  generally shied away from the idea of connecting ritual activity at tombs  with the influence of epic, but most still characterize the activity as a form  of hero cult.33 One problem with identifying this activity as “hero cult”  is that no site has yet produced epigraphic evidence to confirm that the  recipients of cult activity in Bronze Age tombs were identified as specific  epic heroes, or that they were even referred to by the term hērōs.34 Another problem is that the poems of Homer and Hesiod, which are  widely believed to have been produced during the time when cult activity  is well attested at Bronze Age tombs, fail to link heroes with worship or  veneration at a grave. Homer’s account of the funeral of Patroklos in book  23 of the Iliad certainly attests to an elaborate, “heroic” burial that finds  parallels in the archaeological record of the Early Iron Age,35 but neither  the Iliad nor the Odyssey refers to cult activity at graves subsequent to the  burial of the deceased.36 Hesiod bears witness to the fact that honor (timē) 31.

The kinds  of offerings that were deposited in the tombs do not seem to favor one  kind of recipient over the other.41 Moreover, Antonaccio’s assertion that  post-Mycenaean burials in some of the chamber tombs near the Argive  Heraion indicate that later inhabitants of the area felt a kinship with the  original Bronze Age occupants of the tombs is not strongly supported  by the archaeological evidence. Throughout the chamber tomb cemetery  near the Argive Heraion, later burials in the tombs are exceedingly few,  37. Farnell 1921, pp. 12–14; Snod- mize their claim to the land.

Nor do I think there is adequate  evidence to support the claims made for the political significance of the  rituals, especially with regard to legitimizing land tenure. If tendance of  these tombs was integral to claims of territory, one might have expected  this activity to have been maintained over a longer period of time than  is indicated by the objects deposited in most of the tombs.43 Moreover, if  the aim had been to legitimize territorial claims (especially claims made  by a polis, rather than by individual families or communities), one might  also have expected the activity at the graves to have been monumental- ized in much the same way that cult activity came to be monumentalized  at the Argive Heraion.44 It is difficult to see how a few vessels and other  small objects deposited within a chamber tomb could be expected to assert  much of a claim to the ownership of either an individual parcel of land or  a larger territory.  42.

The shift of activity  </page> <page sequence="9"> artemis  and  a  hero  at  the  arg ive  hera ion 285 David Boehringer’s suggestion that hero cults in the chamber tombs  near the Argive Heraion were supported by rich aristocratic cult groups  who competed for status through display is also problematic.45 First, the  votive offerings are not of such consistently high quality as to suggest  aristocratic competition. Second, the tombs, which by the 8th century b.c.  were mostly holes in the ground produced by the collapse of the roofs of  the burial chambers, would not seem to provide particularly conspicuous  venues for competitive display. I would suggest that the explanation most consistent with the evi- dence is that the ritual activity at the tombs was intended to propitiate  the dead at times when the tombs were accidentally discovered. The dead  need not have been regarded as heroes or ancestors for such acts to have  been thought appropriate or necessary in the Early Iron Age, when many  of the first offerings were made.46 That these graveside rituals began at  approximately the same time that the Argive Heraion was beginning to  receive significant numbers of votives may simply indicate that this was  the time when people in the area started to notice the old collapsed tombs  in the vicinity and sought to propitiate the spirits of the unknown dead  (or perhaps the gods on behalf of the dead).47 In many, if not most, cases a  single ritual accompanied by offerings was perhaps all that was necessary.  In those cases where objects of a broader range of date have been found in  the tombs, one might imagine that rituals were repeated when, with the  passing of time, the tombs were forgotten and then rediscovered, or when  the collapsing or further collapsing of their roofs provided a reason for  repeating the propitiatory rituals.48 Unlike the offerings in the chamber tombs, which provide no confir- mation of the heroic status of the deceased, the inscribed skyphos from the  Argive Heraion unequivocally identifies its owner as a hero. What kind  of hero he was remains to be considered. He could possibly have been a  specific hero from the epic tradition, but none of them are known to have  45. See n. 38, above.

To explain why a nameless hero would come to be venerated at the  Argive Heraion, one might first think of the possibility that an ancient  grave was uncovered in the course of construction within the sanctuary of  Hera and that this unknown individual was perceived to be a local hero.  In Waldstein’s excavations of 1894 and 1895, some early graves (perhaps  all Middle Helladic) were uncovered in the area immediately north of  the west end of the South Stoa.51 It is entirely possible that some of the  graves in this area were disturbed shortly before the middle of the 5th  century b.c., when the back wall of the South Stoa and the contiguous  retaining wall to the east of the West Building were constructed. Earlier  excavations carried out at the site in 1854 also encountered a few graves  (perhaps Middle Helladic) somewhere to the southeast of the Classical  temple.52 The report of these excavations does not indicate whether any  of these graves might have been encountered during construction of the  Archaic and Classical sanctuary.  Having raised the possibility of linking our hero with the discovery  of an early grave on the site, we must immediately call attention to the  problems with the association. It should first be noted that the findspot of  the inscribed skyphos is not reported. This is not surprising, since most of  49.

That nothing is reported about the find context  would seem, then, to suggest that the skyphos was not found in situ in a  Bronze Age grave. That the skyphos was inscribed, whereas the offerings  in the nearby chamber tombs were not, might be taken as evidence that  the skyphos was not a comparable offering motivated by the discovery of  a tomb. To this, however, it can be objected that the skyphos dates to the  5th century b.c. (whereas nearly all of the offerings in the chamber tombs  date to the 8th and 7th centuries b.c.), and that the response to the discovery  of a tomb in the Classical period may have been different from that in the  Geometric and Early Archaic periods.  It is also possible that the discovery of a tomb within the sanctuary  might have elicited a different response from that to tombs outside the  sanctuary. For instance, the discovery of tombs outside the sanctuary in  the 8th and 7th centuries b.c. might have occasioned only short-term  propitiatory rites to the dead occupants, whereas perhaps the discovery of  a tomb in the area of the sanctuary in the 5th century b.c. gave rise to a  more clearly defined hero cult with regular rituals and even a shrine of some  sort. Finally, although hero cults are often connected in literature with the  bones and/or the burial place of a hero, there is very little archaeological  evidence to link securely identified hero cults with Bronze Age burials.54  Moreover, among the examples of heroes worshipped or venerated in con-  texts clearly separate from any grave site, there is at least one who, like  the hero at the Argive Heraion, was anonymous. This is the hero who  received burnt offerings on an inscribed altar in the round structure of  the “Heroon” at Olympia.55  The phenomenon of anonymous heroes is certainly perplexing. The  only thing that can be said with confidence about them is that they are  attested over a wide geographic area and in varied contexts, ranging from  sanctuaries, such as Olympia, to urban centers, such as the Athenian  Agora.56 In some cases, as, for example, in some dedicatory inscriptions,  the argument can be made that the name of the hero was known but was  omitted because the identity would have been clear from the original con- text.57 In other cases, however, such as when heroes are identified by only a  functional title or geographic designation, there is good reason to believe  that the name was simply not known.58 In Athens, for example, there was a  hero doctor and a hero general;59 at Sounion there was a “hero at the hale”  53.

In the end, it must be admitted that there is not enough evidence to  determine how in the 5th century b.c. an unnamed hero came to be rec- ognized and presumably venerated or worshipped at the Argive Heraion.  Vessels with similar inscriptions referring to unnamed heroes at Mycenae  and Argos suggest that the skyphos from the Argive Heraion is part of a  broader regional phenomenon, but in no case is there contextual evidence  to explain the motivation for honoring these anonymous heroes or to shed  light on the kinds of rituals that were associated with the inscribed vessels.  In the case of the inscribed plate from Mycenae mentioned above, the  findspot near Grave Circle A encourages one to connect the piece with  a hero cult linked to the Early Mycenaean graves, but there is apparently  no evidence to confirm that the existence of the graves was still known in  the 5th century b.c., when the piece was inscribed.61 Another vessel with a graffito indicating that it was the possession  of “the hero” was found in the agora of Argos. It is an Attic black-glazed  cup roughly contemporary with the two inscribed pieces from the Argive  Heraion and Mycenae.62 Again, the findspot does not seem to provide  clear evidence for the original context in which the vessel was used.63 At  the Argive Heraion, Mycenae, and Argos, then, inscribed vessels provide  tantalizing clues regarding the existence of anonymous hero cult, but not  enough evidence to allow us to fully understand the origin and nature of  the cult activity implied by the inscribed vessels. There is nothing to show  whether the vessels were merely presented as votive objects to the hero (at  a shrine or grave) or were intended to be used by the hero in some form  of ritual banquet.64 Because the findspot of the skyphos from the Argive Heraion was not  recorded, any evidence it might have provided for the location of cult activity  connected with the hero has been lost.

Certainly  there is nothing as prominent as the shrine of Opheltes/Archemoros at  Nemea or the Pelopion at Olympia.65 The lack of such a prominent her- oon at the Argive Heraion should caution us against interpreting our hero  as a comparable founding hero, especially in the absence of any literary  reference to such a hero. As a final note, there is no other unambiguous  evidence of hero cult at the Argive Heraion. There is, therefore, nothing  by which to gauge the duration of the cult activity. Some 48 fragments of  early handmade horse-and-rider figurines were found at the site, but there  is no conclusive evidence to show that they were dedicated to a hero.66 ARTEMIS J. R. Wheeler’s preliminary report of 1894 on the inscriptions from Wald- stein’s excavations at the Argive Heraion provides the editio princeps of an  inscription on a “much broken block of stone measuring 2 ft. 3 in. by 2 ft. by  1 ft. 3 in. (height).”67 Exactly the same wording is used to describe the in-  scribed block in the final excavation report of 1902. Fraenkel’s description  of the block in IG IV is essentially a Latin translation of Wheeler’s En-  glish.68 According to Wheeler the inscribed block was “found on the upper  terrace just south of the remains of the earlier temple”; from this it can be  determined that the inscription was found either in 1892 or, more likely,  in 1893, when excavations were carried out on the Old Temple Terrace.69  Facsimiles of the inscription in Wheeler’s publications and in IG IV indi-  cate that the second and third letters are not fully preserved, but do not  indicate that the inscription may not be complete at its right end (Fig. 4).  Wheeler read the text as a dative singular form of Artemis, Artami, for  which he cited a parallel in an inscription at Argos published by Foucart.70  Figure 4. Facsimile of IG IV 513. Neither Wheeler nor Fraenkel hazarded a guess as to the nature of the  Waldstein et al. 1902, p. 213, no. XVI inscribed block or its date. In the course of my work at the Argive Heraion I discovered that  the inscribed block described above is still lying on the Old Temple Ter- race, near its east end (Fig. 5). Examination of the piece confirms that it  is a simple, small monolithic altar carved from a type of hard, light gray  limestone that was used in several of the buildings and monuments on the  site (Figs. 6–8).71 New measurements indicate that the altar is 0.668 m  65.

The mu that  follows is the same height as the neighboring alpha; it is complete except for  some damage to its upper right corner. The legs of this letter flare slightly  toward the bottom, as in the facsimiles, but whereas the facsimiles show the  two middle strokes meeting one another at the bottom of the letter, they in  fact meet well above the bottom. Of the final iota, only the very bottom of  the vertical stroke is preserved. As can be seen in Figure 7, there is a break  in the stone that traverses the front of the altar immediately to the right of  the traces of the iota. It cannot, therefore, be assumed that the inscription  ended with the iota. Since there would have been room for a number of  letters after the iota, I would suggest that the common Doric genitive form  of Artemis, Ἀρτάμιτος, be restored more or less symmetrically across the  front of this altar.72 The surviving letters do not offer much evidence for  dating the altar, but they point to a date in the 4th century b.c., consistent  with the date of similar altars at Argos and Epidauros.73 Monolithic altars of this type (lacking moldings and bearing a simple  dedicatory inscription) seem to have been something of a local specialty.  They are attested in considerable numbers at Argos and Epidauros and  are dedicated to a wide variety of deities. At Argos three altars of this type  were found in the vicinity of the sanctuary of Apollo Pythaeus; they were  dedicated to Zeus Panoptas, Aphrodita, and Damater Pylaia.74 In the Askle-  pieion at Epidauros, there are at least 10 altars of this type, dedicated to  Zeus Ourios, Poseidon, Hygieia (2), Agathos Daimon and Agatha Tycha,  Artamis Enodia, the Mousai, and a Soteira (3).75 In the sanctuary of Apollo  Maleatas at Epidauros, there are at least 17 altars of this type, dedicated to  Zeus Epikleros, Zeus Moiragetas, Poseidon, Dionysos, Damater, Apollo  Mousagetas, Lato, Mnemosyna, Linos Ailinos, Kaphisos, Erato, Apollo  Deiradiotas, Artamis Hagemona, and Hera.76 Nearly all these altars are  dated to the 4th century b.c., and the few exceptions are thought to date  not much before or after the 4th century.77 It is not clear whether these  altars were used for animal sacrifice or for other kinds of offerings.78 No  signs of burning have been observed on the tops of any of these altars,  and certainly no evidence of burning (blackening or calcination of the  surface) is now to be seen on the altar at the Argive Heraion.

The altar is not now  in its original position, and there is nothing to indicate that it was found  in situ.80 It is necessary therefore to consider whether or not the altar was  originally set up on the Old Temple Terrace. The plundered state of the  Argive Heraion provides abundant evidence of blocks having been moved  from their original locations, so the findspot of a piece does not provide  secure evidence for its original location. Nonetheless, on this terraced hill- side site, stone elements associated with buildings and monuments have,  as a rule, been found at or below the level where they stood in antiquity.  Gravity would naturally have aided the movement of blocks downhill,  but stone robbers would generally also have moved blocks downward in  the process of carrying off usable building material to the villages in the  adjacent plain.  The discovery of the altar on the highest terrace would seem, then,  to support the idea that the altar was originally set up on this terrace rather  than in some lower part of the sanctuary.81 This conclusion, if correct, is  somewhat surprising. After 423 b.c., when the Archaic Temple of Hera  was destroyed by fire, the burnt ruins of that building were evidently left  in place as a new temple was constructed on the terrace below.82 One  might have expected that with the abandonment of the old temple site  all cult activity would have shifted to the lower terrace. The possibility  that a 4th-century b.c. altar to Artemis was set up on the Old Temple  Terrace now requires us to consider that for some considerable time after  the destruction of the Archaic temple the upper terrace was still the site  of some cult activity. There is, unfortunately, no other evidence that I am  aware of for activity on this terrace subsequent to the destruction of the  temple. Before ending this discussion of the altar, some consideration should  be given to why Artemis would have been provided with an altar at the  Argive Heraion. If we knew who was responsible for setting up the altar,  we might be in a better position to answer this question. The evidence,  however, is ambiguous. The small size of the altar might suggest that it  was a private dedication that reflects some special interest of its dedicant.83  On the other hand, the fact that the inscription fails to name the dedicant  might suggest that the altar was a public dedication reflecting the interests  79.

She is known  to have had a number of sanctuaries in the Argolid,86 two of which have  foundation stories associated with the myth of Hera and the Proitidai.87  Moreover, as a virgin goddess concerned with the lives of girls and young  women, Artemis can be seen as doubling the role of Hera Parthenos.88  The obvious difference is that, whereas Hera Parthenos is an aspect of a  goddess who goes on to marry and is associated with the maturation of  women through marriage, Artemis (at least as she figures in the cults of the  Greek mainland) is the perpetual virgin, who is associated with the young.89  It is widely believed that the institution of marriage was an important  concern of the cult of Hera at the Argive Heraion. The klinē seen by Pau- sanias in the pronaos of the Classical temple has been taken as evidence  for the celebration of the ritual of the hieros gamos of Hera and Zeus,90  and scenes of dancing women on early vases from the site have been inter- preted as representations of premarital initiatory rites of young women.91  84.

That virginity was an important  precondition of the kind of legitimate marriage that was promoted by Hera  is well supported by the local tradition, reported by Pausanias (2.38.2), that  Hera (probably represented by her statue) bathed annually in the Kanathos  spring near Nauplion to renew her virginity.94 Although Pausanias does not  elaborate on the consequences of this bath, it may have served as a pre- liminary to the hieros gamos, ensuring that Zeus would be united with a  renewed, virginal Hera.95 From the evidence now available it is difficult to assess the importance  of the altar of Artemis at the Argive Heraion. From the find context, there  is no way of knowing how long the altar was in use, and short of finding a  sacred calendar that provides information about offerings or sacrifices to  Artemis, we are not likely to ever know the extent to which the altar was  incorporated into the life of the sanctuary. Because the altar is small and  unadorned, we may be tempted to think that it was not particularly impor- tant, and that whatever significance it had was short-lived. Evidence from  nearby Epidauros shows, however, that this may not be the case. Among  the many altars in the Asklepieion that received inscribed numbers as part  of an inventory during the Late Roman Empire, there are some small,  plain altars that date as early as the 5th and 4th centuries b.c.96 From this  it would appear that in the Asklepieion some small altars comparable to  the altar of Artemis at the Argive Heraion continued to be used for more  than seven centuries. 92.

Incomplete recording or assessment of the archaeological  finds exaggerates still further the tendency toward oversimplification. It is  hoped that this article, with its focus on two previously overlooked finds from  the Argive Heraion, a cup and a small altar, has enhanced our understanding  of the complexity of cult activity at the sanctuary.  In a final assessment, it would appear that the Argive Heraion was,  by comparison with Olympia and the Asklepieion of Epidauros, a rather  narrowly focused sanctuary, but the evidence presented here has shown  clearly that ritual activity extended beyond the cult of the principal deity  to embrace an anonymous hero in the first half of the 5th century b.c. and  Artemis in the 4th century b.c. Having set out this evidence for subsidiary  cults at the Argive Heraion, I hope that others may be inspired to look  more closely for similar evidence from other sites so that we may better  understand the role of subsidiary cults within Greek sanctuaries.
