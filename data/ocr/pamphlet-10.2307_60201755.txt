When so many of the gifted and cultured have practically failed in vindi¬ cating Eeligion to the mind of the Atheist, it may appear presumption in a novice like myself to attempt the same task. My apology lies in this fact— that I have for many years had more acquaintance with Atheists than usually falls to the lot of Theists, aad that such acquaintance has given rise in me to a deep-rooted conviction that there are, in modern English Atheism, elements of faith which are not generally appreciated. Many Theists there are, in all sects, and of no sect, who have shown full and frank recognition of the fact that pure-hearted Atheists are as worthy of respect and affection as pure-hearted Christians; but beyond tliis point scarcely any Theist has passed. They are all anxious to explain their own faith to the Atheist, and they often do this very admirably; but it scarcely ever occurs to them that the Atheist has a faith also, which he prizes quite as earnestly as they prize theirs. They see Atheism only as a negation of Theism, and dream not of all the inspirations and associa¬ tions with which—logically or not—it is connected in the minds of its earnest votaries. Till Theists study and appreciate, and to some extent sympathise with these, all their religious expositions, however well- reasoned or eloquent, will be to then- opponents like fair possessions on the other side of a bridgeless river—out of reach. To begin by folly occupying the ground which is common to both parties, and tlien to show where divergence begins, and why it does so, is surely a more hopeful way of attaining agreement. This is what I have endeavoured to do; whether I have succeeded, is another question. It should perhaps ho added that part of this Essay appeared in 1850 (in a short-lived periodical called the Free Inquirer), signed with the pseudonym of Pantfiea. Since then it has been entirely recast, and its narrative and criticism are carried down to the Atheistic productions of the present month.

GEORGE JACOB HOLYOAKE. 11 could not live—coulds't thou to hear a truth Cry loudly in the heart, and strangle it. Wore this the end, no other lite beyond, Better to perish thus, our dust unurned (So it might nourish still a living flower). Rather than breathe such breath us hourly kills The truth that blooms within.' Vivia Perpetua, by Sarah Flowkr Adams, A pew years ago, it was remarked by an acute spectator* of a Discussion on Christianity, that " those who stand at the head of society, and argue that the minds of the people must be left alone, or they will break loose from the religious ties that are supposed to bind them, and drift away no one knows whither—must take a new course, as the people are already free from those ties; and they who mean to guide them must guide them speedily, or some one else will do so for them."f The truth of this remark becomes increasingly apparent with every year. Not only are the details of Christianity, or the Church, fearlessly called in question, but even the corner-stone of Theology, the existence of the Deity, is freely canvassed. Painful as it is to earnest worshippers to hear such a topic debated on a platform, before a mixed audience, such • is the irresistible destiny of to-day. The popular theology fails to rule the minds of large numbers of thoughtful men among the working classes, and they come for¬ ward and'challenge their spiritual masters to defend or to disown it. Possess¬ ing sufficient culture to be critical, but not enough to compete with the clergy on the literary points which are inextricably bound up with the sub¬ ject, they are more quick to detect error, than strong to evolve truth. This is soon discerned by the other side, who forthwith descant on the presump¬ tion of " the people," but who, at the same time, take no steps to aid the people by liberal education to judge the question on equal grounds with themselves. Thus each party sees the other's weak points without appre¬ ciating each other's real reasons: consequently neither conveys any impres¬ sion to the other beyond the fact of its own earnestness. Now these insurgencies of thought are never without meaning. It is never for mere whim that numbers of men undergo suffering and reproach. Everything that shows purpose shows some sort of reality that needs to be thoughtfully dealt with; and when that purpose is a wholly disinterested one, it should at least be respectfully dealt with. Those who rail at Atheism, * W. E. Porster. f Beasoner, vol. ix., p, 66. B</page><page sequence="8">2 GEORGE JACOB HOLYOAKE as nine-tenths of the religious world do—or even those who look on it with dismal solemnity, as the other tenth does—will never understand it. Those who fail to see that it may be in itself a purely intellectual, and therefore unblameable result of the genuine pursuit of Truth, begin by ignoring that human respect and sympathy which must exist between two parties before either is likely to make any impression on the mind of the other. But though, as believers in man's full right to the free use of his intellect, we hold any intellectual conclusion to be, as such, unblameable, and readily acknowledge that Atheism furnishes no exception to the rule—we have yet to ask if it be a true conclusion? Is universal scepticism to supersede the worship of ages? to overthrow all the belief in a Eathcr and a futurity which has animated not only the Hebrew and the Christian, but almost every nation of the whole earth, giving energy to the toiler, balm to the sufferer, and a whole world of aspiration and blessedness to the thought¬ ful and the loving? Is tho religious faculty in man no more than a mis¬ take or a disease? or does it exist only to be tortured with unmitigated hunger? I, for one, cannot believe this. The religious instinct is to me so vivid a reality, that no intellectual difficulties can destroy or diminish my conviction that it is a presage of a deep Truth. That the religious instinct has erred grievously, both in past and present times, is indubitable; but this only tends to show how important a faculty we have been misusing. The scheme of human nature from which we exclude a tendency that has played so large a part in our history, must be an imperfect one. To those who thus believe, there is something painful, therefore, in the prevalence of Atheism, especially when it is seen to be, not merely as in the last century, the excuse of the vicious, or the diversion of the thoughtless, but the speculation of the earnest, and the conviction of the pure. In such a connection it has an influence not previously enjoyed, and a candid investi¬ gation into its claims becomes our serious duty. Among the English exponents of Atheism, none occupy so high a place as the author whose name is placed on the title-page of this essay. His in¬ fluence has gradually become a power, and such influences always mean something. I propose to examine his woiks as representative of modern English Atheism; because, although not correct samples of the majority of Atheistical writings, they manifest all the distinctive features of Atheism, gathered together into a focus, and reproduced with more power and pur¬ pose than any other English Atheist displays: because, also, as editor of the chief organ of English Atheism, and as the most untiring and devoted of Atheistical propagandists, Mr. Holyoake has earned the general confi¬ dence of the body as their " representative man;" and further, as he bears a high character for integrity and usefulness, both public and private, in mat¬ ters unconnected with Atheism, he may be taken as a fair sample by which to judge of the relations of Atheism to practical and moral life. Every large associated body contains false men, who disgrace it—foolish men, who bring ridicule upon it, and mediocre men, who hold its principles without possessing sufficient intellectual power to judge of them independently; but the fairest way to test any creed as an ideal of truth and duty, is to regard it as expounded by those who accord to it the distinct acceptance of a com¬ prehensive and free intelligence, and who honestly endeavour to work out their principles to their full extent, as germs of life and thought. Should the result prove satisfactory, it is easy to make further inquiries as to the</page><page sequence="9">AND MODERN ATHEISM. 3 more average effects of such a creed; but should the best result prove clearly fatal, either to the consistency of the advocate, or the rationality of his prin¬ ciples, we may quietly reject his theory without stooping to inveigh against all the follies and vices which may peradventure be found among some of its less disciplined adherents. To working men, Atheism is not a merely speculative question: it is, as all that interests the suffering classes must be—largely involved in the social problems of the day. An outline of our Atheist's biography will, therefore, throw some light on the processes of thought by which he arrived at his present position. Those facts which now appear in print for the first time, are given on the authority of the present writer, who has derived them either from personal observation, or from conversations with Mr. Holyoake and his familv. George Jacob Holyoake was born at Birmingham, on the 13th of April, 1817—the second child and eldest son of a family of thirteen. He was early subjected to the vicissitudes of poverty, and the alarms of prospective want. A delicate, sickly child, he grew up under the constantly-repeated prediction that he was destined to die early. But he was placed in circumstances where he was obliged to work, whether feeble or robust. Except during two long and dangerous illnesses, he worked as a whitesmith, " from nine years of age to twenty-two, with thousands of others, who were never remunerated by the means of paltriest comfort, and whose lives were never enlightened by plea¬ sure."* He " had an aversion to being thought idle, and he worked hard."f A pretty little steel fire-grate is still in existence, which he manufactured at twelve years old, as a specimen of the more skilled labour to which he was then desirous of being promoted. In what way our established religion came to soothe the vicissitudes of his family, may be seen from the following incident narrated by Mr. Holyoake on his trial. His parents had been suddenly reduced by a commercial panic to a state of unusual privation; and at this crisis his little sister fell ill. While she was so, the Eev. Mr. Mosely, rector of St. Martin's, Birmingham, sent an order for his Easter due of fourpence. Poverty prevented it from being paid; but the next week a summons came for it, with the addition of half- a-crown because of the non-payment of the fourpence. The payment could now no longer be evaded, for in a few days a warrant of distraint would have rudely torn the bed from under her, as had been the case with a neighbour. Dreading this, the family gathered together all the money they had, and the mother reluctantly left home to pay the " due." She was kept waiting at the court from five to six hours, and when she returned all was over—her child was dead. " Will you wonder (concluded Mr. Holy¬ oake) if, after all this, I doubted a little the utility of church establishments J Dissenting piety was, however, at hand to indoctrinate the young mind; a task so effectually performed that our hero's youthful enthusiasm gained W * Beasoner, iv., p. 101. f End, iv., p. 100. % " Last Trial for Atheism," pp. 38, 39. At the funeral of this sister, Mr. Holyoake caught a rheumatic fever, from which he did not recover for six months. He was then about twelve years old. B 2</page><page sequence="10">4 GEORGE JACOB HOLYOAKE him, from pastoral lips, the appellation of "an angel child." Of this pietistic period of his life, he has given, at different times, the following reminis¬ cences :— "I learned the accents of piety from my mother's lips. She was, and still is, a religious woman. Whatever may be the dissent I entertain, I have never spoken of her opinions in the language of contempt. I have always left her (as she to her honour has left me) to enjoy her own opinions. In early youth I was religious."* " My days were given to toil and to prayer. After the day's task was done, I was lured into the prayer-meeting. When the seventh day of rest came, I was immured in a Sunday-school, f and it brought no rest to me. The should-have-been buoyancy of youth was absorbed by the gloom of religion. Premature cares weighed on my young spirit. Supernatural fears destroyed my peace, and I was degraded by an artificial sense of depravity. I looked on nature not as inherently glorious, but as the unintelligent tool of God—regarded the world only as a sublu¬ nary trial—my friends, but as brands of an eternal burning; pleasure was a temptation, joy a crime, and death a horrid foreboding. I knew no cheer¬ fulness, no utility. Instead of being encouraged to rely on my own ener¬ gies, and calculate my own resources, I was sent to the throne of grace, and cruel was the mockery of my petitions. No God ever had a truer suppliant or more devout worshipper, yet those near and dear to me perished unheeded around me."J '* As I grew up, I attended missionary meetings, and my few pence were given to that cause. When told of heathen kings who knew not God, and caged their miserable victims, I shuddered at their barbarity, and prayed for their conversion."§ So ardently did he drink in the teachings of evangelical faith, that he used every evening to attend some chapel or other, when released from work. But in the course of this chapel-haunting, he one day heard a Bap¬ tist minister of the name of Cheadle, who contravened the doctrine of eternal torments. To this gentleman's chapel, therefore, our young in¬ quirer soon gave his preference. Mr. Cheadle wished him to be re-baptised, but from that he shrunk, not considering himself holy enough for such a ceremony. * " Last Trial," p. 40. )• The school attached to the Eev. Angell James's Chapel in Carr's Lane, Birmingham. A few years ago, circumstances led Mr. Holyoake to revisit this chapel after an absence of twenty years. " What vicissitudes of reli¬ gious experience (he says) had I gone through since I last walked along its familiar galleries! What an utter, an unforeseen change had my life been since then! There was the well-known clock, whose tardy hands I had watched so wearily out of the Sunday-school gallery. There, too, were those formal, dull, ground-glass windows, which did not let in even the cheerful blaze of day; and I used to envy the bright sun above, which dwelt so high in the sky, and was never cooped up in the Sunday-school, but looked out over all the world, even on itobinson Crusoe's island, and was not forced to go to chapel on the bright Sunday morning." Beasoner, xv., 4,5. % Beasoner, hi., p. 347-8. § " Last Trial," p. 40.</page><page sequence="11">AND MODERN ATHEISM. • 5 When about fifteen, he ventured, though still tolerably orthodox, to gratify his curiosity to hear a Unitarian service. After many prayers for grace and strength, he entered the Eev. Mr. Bache's chapel in Park Street, Birmingham—taking his station in a place from which he could easily escape should he hear anything very shocking. Sometimes, in his evan¬ gelical simplicity, he used to look up at the roof to see if it gave any signs of coming down. But it never did. Hitherto his education seems to have been exceedingly slight and de¬ sultory; but at seventeen, he entered the Birmingham Mechanics' Institu¬ tion, where he found an excellent tutor and friend in Mr. Daniel Wright— the schoolmaster, forty years previously, of Charles Pemberton.* In 1836, '38, and '39, Mr. Holyoake gained prizes at the Institution for proficiency in Mathematics; and previously to the first of these occasions, his studies had been conducted with the help only of some compasses of his own forging, one pair of which was so ingenious in its variety of contriv¬ ances as to be mentioned in the Secretary's Annual Eeport to the Institu¬ tion. Whereupon, when the chairman presented " to George Holyoake, a book, for skill in mathematics,"—" Mr. Pitman asked if Holyoake was the youth referred to in the report, who had evinced so much assiduity, and on being informed that he was, that gentleman said he considered it a pity- such a master mind should be crippled; he should feel great pleasure in presenting him with a set of mathematical instruments. " Holyoake came forward and modestly returned thanks. He said, he felt extremely grateful for the prize and the present, and he hoped to repay the givers by renewed exertions in the cause of science."f In the following year (1837) our young mechanic distinguished himself by conducting some observations on the November meteors, which obtained the marked approbation of the philosophical investigators by whose desire he acted. But it is worth while to note the conditions under which working men are forced to study the stars. Mr. Holyoake says that he conducted his observations " during the cold nights of November, on the house-top, from six at night to eight in the morning, from Sunday to Wednesday, without rest, as no cessation of work was provided for. This I had done for the Philosophical Institution, and thought myself rich in their votes of thanks, while I had, out of my scanty savings, to pay doctors' bills, to restore my injured health and that of my coadjutors." J * Charles Eeece Pemberton was chiefly known as the Pel Verjuice of the Monthly Bepository, and as a dramatic lecturer of remarkable genius. He was one of the Eadical writers of the Eeform Bill epoch, and differed from the general Eadical school in being more poetic than philosophic. He was a bright, radiant creature, ever glowing with the most generous sympathies, and only too sensitive for this rough work-a-day world. f The Birmingham Journal adds that " a book was also presented to Frederick Hollick for his skill in mathematics. This young man has also distinguished himself in an extraordinary manner, and has presented the Institution with some well-executed maps, drawn by himself." Frederick Hollick was an early friend of Mr. Holyoake, and was afterwards a col¬ league of his as a Socialist Missionary. He is now Dr. Hollick, of America, and is well known throughout the Union for his physiological works. X Beasoner, i., p. 161.</page><page sequence="12">6 GEORGE JACOB HOLYOAKB He continued to make these observations every November for several years. In the second year some slight remuneration was given; but it was not till the third year that he ventured to ask for it.* The next point visible in Mr. Holyoake's development, is an ardent hero- worship for George Combe, whose name was to him "a talisman that awakened all his fondest idealisms of moral and philosophic perfection." Of this enthusiasm, Mr. Combe, in the opinion of Mr. Holyoake's friends, took advantage on the occasion of Mr. H.'s becoming his assistant at Birmingham for a few weeks. The story is too long for insertion here, but may be found at full length in the Beasoner,] with other autobiographical fragments of Mr. Holyoake's life at this period. Another object of his young enthusiasm was the gifted and generous Charles Pemberton. But Mr. Ilolyoake's inter¬ course with him lasted not many years; in the spring of 1840, "the Wan¬ derer " went to his long rest. In a little " Sketch of the Life of Pemberton,"{ which Mr. Holyoake wrote in 1841, there occurs the following reminis¬ cence of their last meeting upon earth:— "For weeks preceding his death, the earth was mud and the sky haze; but the day of his death was one of those beautiful days which welcome the returning spring—seemingly sent that nature's face might smile as his spirit for the last time gazed upon it. " A few hours before his death, I entered his room, but never beheld so much of the majesty of thought in his face before. His usual smile was there; his eyes were fully as brilliant as in life, and all bespoke his usual unruffled sweetness of mind. Yet he know he was dying. Occasional dozes succeeded, in which he uttered broken phrases that told his spirit was in far-off sunny climes. The last time consciousness returned he smiled in the face of his niece, who was supporting his head, thanked her for her atten¬ tion, and serenely died. "Pembertonwas borne to his grave by a few members of the Birmingham Mechanics' Institution. He lies at the General Cemetery, a beautiful spot for the last sleep of the gifted wanderer through many far-off lauds."§ While thus communing with free minds and liberal studies, our young mechanic was also vividly alive to all the stirring influences of Birmingham Eadicalism: and the bonds of his orthodoxy began to be loosened by all these things. It is characteristic of him that as the first great change in his views arose from his repugnance to the supposed inhuman treatment of the erring in another world, so his next great change originated from his dislike to the unkindly treatment of heretics here below. He used to be pained at hearing his companions talk sneeringly against the Socialists, and ho would; sometimes go to hear Socialist lecturers (though not agreeing with them), that he might be able to report good things which they had said, with which to check the harsh remarks he had heard. This was in 1837. Two years later, his sympathy had grown into warm acquiescence, and he had joined * Beasoner, iv., p. 301. t Vol.i., Nos. 11, 12,13, 16. f This is now out of print, but a lecture on the same subject, very superior to the "Sketch," was delivered by our author in 1844,and is still to be pro¬ cured. It is entitled, " The Value of Biography in the Formation of Indi¬ vidual Character." § "Sketch of the Life of Pemberton," pp. 12,13,15.</page><page sequence="13">AND MODERN ATnEJSM. 7 the Socialist ranks, and accepted the mastership of the school attached to the Social Institution in Birmingham. In March, 1839, he married the "Eleanor" to whom he refers so nobly in the history of his imprisonment: and, quitting his father's house, settled in a dwelling of his own. In the September of this year, Mr. Daniel Wright died suddenly; a pain¬ ful blow to Mr. Holyoake, who wrote that "in him each of his pupils lost a father and a friend. They marked, in some measure, their sense of his loss by the erection of a tablet to his memory over his last resting-place, in the Old Meeting-House Yard. If ever teacher was mourned by those he in¬ structed, it was Daniel Wright."* After Mr. Wright's death, the superintendence of the educational classes at the Mechanics' Institution was transferred to Mr. Holyoake. During 1838 and 1839, he was also a teacher (of Secular knowledge) at the Unita¬ rian Sunday-school attached to Mr. Bache's chapel, in Park Street, although he was very far from being a Unitarian. When, however, in 1840, he was about to make his first plunge into ultra-heterodox publicity, by lecturing as a Socialist missionary, he resigned his teachership at Park Street, lest the Unitarians should feel compromised by his new position. They parted from him with an expression of regret that " his engagements would not permit him to continue his valuable services."! He was sent, not long afterwards, to occupy a " station " at Worcester, where he remained about a year. A memorial^ presented to the Central Board of the Eational Society, by the Worcester Branch of Socialists, at the period of his leaving them, states that " since the engagement of Mr. Holy¬ oake, the audiences have gradually increased in number and respectability; additions have been made to the Branch; useful educational classes, superior to anything of the kind in the city, have been established; and it is to be hoped that the social, literary, and scientific lectures that have been delivered, have done much to diffuse morality and intelligence." Mr. Holyoake was next located at Sheffield, where, for thirty shillings a week, he taught a day-school, and lectured on Sundays. He had been thus occupied for nearly a year, when the events occurred which determined the current of his life's career. In November, 1841, Mr. Chai-les Southwell, a fellow (Socialist) mission¬ ary of Mr. Holyoake's, set up, in conjunction with Mr. Chilton and Mr. Field, an Atheistic periodical, entitled the Oracle ofBeason. An article of Mr. Southwell's in the fourth number, called " The Jew Book,"—an article, the coarse tone of which is sufficiently indicated by its title,—entailed upon its author the heavy sentence of a year's imprisonment and a £100 fine. Mr. Holyoake was not at this time an Atheist, but feeling intensely the dan¬ gerous position in which Southwell's sentence placed the right of free utterance, he came forward to conduct the Oracle during his friend's im- * " Sketch of the Life of Pemberton," p. 11. The erection of this tablet was entirely owing to Mr. Holyoake. He was also Secretary to the Com¬ mittee for raising a monument to Charles Pemberton. f Eeport of the Committee of the New Meeting Sunday-schools, May 18, 1840. % Published in the New Moral World, ii. (N. S.), p. 337. I</page><page sequence="14">8 GEORGE JACOB HOLYOAKE prisonment.* It was not long, however, before he entered, heart and soul, into the Atheistic movement. The Evidences of Theology he had long promised himself to study, and when they came before him with these ex¬ citing commentaries, it is not surprising that his inquiry " ended in his seeing the insufficiency of the evidence which had before satisfied him."f That it was the inhuman rather than the illogical element in modern theology which induced his disbelief, is evident from a red-hot lecture which he delivered at Sheffield, just before Southwell's trial, in which he says:— "I was born pious, and was nursed in orthodoxy; and have been, till within a very short period of this, a believer in the humanising tendency of Christianity; but the persecution of my friend has been, within these few weeks, the cradle of my doubts and the grave of my religion. My cherished confi¬ dence is gone, and my faith is no more."f The last remnant of religious belief was now swept away, and he was left to build up a faith for himself, from his own intuitions and experiences of nature and of life. It will afterwards be seen how he prospered in that work, Mr. Holyoake had conducted the Oracle during fourteen weeks, when,inthe course of a pedestrian journey to visit Mr. Southwell (then in Bristol jail), he staid a night in Cheltenham (May 24,1842), to lecture on " Home Colo¬ nisation." At the end of the lecture, discussion having been invited, a sort of local preacher, named Maitland, rose and complained, that although the lecturer had told them of their duty to man, he had not told them of their duty to God; inquiring also whether Mr. Holyoake's proposed community would contain churches and chapels? Mr. Holyoake replied with the enthusiasm of a raw recruit, in a speech (which he now admits§ " was perhaps indecorous "), the purport of which was, that he could not recommend that which he personally disbelieved j that he thought people could spend their money to more advantage on their fellow-creatnres than in building churches; and after referring to the expense of church-rates, he said—"If poor men cost the state as much, they would be put, like officers, upon half-pay, and while our distress lasts I think it would be wise to do the same thing with Deity." For this sentence, and another (which he could never recollect having uttered), viz., "I do not believe there is such a thing as a God," Mr. Holyoake was arrested a week afterwards, and sentenced, in the August following, to six months' imprison¬ ment. It is not necessary to give any detail of the event in this place, as Mr. Holyoake has himself narrated the whole story in his "Fragment of Autobiography," entitled, " The History of the Last Trial by Jury for Atheism in England." How the illegality and inhumanity of his treatment * Those readers who may be aware of the many sins of the Oracle against propriety of speech and coherence of thought, should be here re¬ minded that Mr. Holyoake "never had the personal control of the paper for a single week, being always in a distant part of the country from the place of its publication" (Beasoner, iii., p. 488). His editorship consisted in contributing the most sensible and least offensive among its articles, and in bearing its legal responsibility. f Beasoner, xiv., p. 291. X " The Spirit of Bonner in the Disciples of Jesus," p. 4. § " Last Trial," p. 5.</page><page sequence="15">AND MODERN ATHEISM. 9 before trial were so marked as to call down a special rebuke from the Home Secretary (Sir James Graham); how the young enthusiast discussed creeds and systems in the dock and in prison, with as much independence as he had ever shown on Socialist platforms or in Atheist leading-articles; how the sufferings of his situation were increased by the loss of his eldest child, a little girl of much beauty and promise, who sickened and died in conse¬ quence of the poverty caused by his absence—all this is told with modest simplicity in the " History," which is prefaced by the manly request that no one will connect these incidents with him, "but regard them as a posthumous record of bygone events."* The effect of this imprisonment on a character so earnest as Mr. Holy¬ oake's was, naturally, to consolidate and intensify his disbeliefs into a distincter form. While in jail, he wrote a pamphlet, entitled " Paley Eefuted in his own Words," which, though written with a sarcastic levity of style too frequent in his early writings, manifests decided intellectual power in its conception and arrangement. On the argument of this tract, the author's Atheism has ever since been based, and it is an argument not to be hastily passed by. Soon after his liberation, he removed to London, where he maintained himself and his family by teaching. In the December of this year (1843) he commenced editing, in conjunction with the late M. Q. Byall, the Movement, a weekly paper, bearing the characteristic motto (from Bentham), " Maximise morals, minimise religion." The Movement was free from the worst sins of the Oracle, but it was a very crude production, more remark¬ able for earnestness of purpose than for anything else. At the end of its first year, Mr. Holyoake fell dangerously ill, and for nearly nine weeks he lay without hope of life. As his only resources were derived from his own labour, these fell off, " and he was in as much danger of perishing from inanition as from disease."f Possessing " a sensitiveness in reference to pecuniary matters, so great that he was unable to draw the line between mendicancy and martyrdom," J he said no word of his situation to any one, and submitted to starve rather than go into debt. Some friends, however (among whom Mr. W. J. Birch should be remembered), discovered his situation, and saved his life. On his recovery, he found that the Movement was greatly in debt, and he instantly ceased its publication, discharging at once every claim upon it, even the salary of his coadjutor.§ Mr. Holyoake next accepted a Socialist lectureship at Glasgow, one inci¬ dent of which should not be lost. It is thus told in his "reports of progress" to the Society's journal. After narrating the endeavours made to meet the first financial exigency which occurred after his arrival, he says:— " Soon after, it appeared that the amount thus guaranteed was insufficient for the liabilities of the branch, and a second meeting was held, which was rendered remarkable by the delivery of two speeches. One speaker could not see what the branch had to continue for, because Harmony was all awry, and he thought the lectures, if we did hold on, should be popularised so as to pay. The other speaker was for an ' out and out' sensation in the theo- * It should be added, that this work was not written till 1850. f Movement, No. 68.

To these remarks, I replied that ' it was the first time I had ever heard a member of our society ask what had a branch to continue for? No true member ever hung his manhood and his virtue on the gates of Harmony. The philosophy of rationalism related to men, to human duty and dignity; and it would have an abiding influence, should a dozen Harmonies fail. Fraternity and systematic morality were the great princi¬ ples we had to illustrate and inculcate, and he only should propose the disso¬ lution of a branch who was prepared to deny their validity and their value.' With respect to the other point, I answered—' I had never condescended to make what I considered the interests of truth a matter of £ s. d., and never would. If I could not establish the interest, I would at least preserve the dignity of what I endeavoured to inculcate—that I would never pander to the untutored taste of those who craved for novelty at the expense of propriety. If that which was useful had no charms for our friends and the public, they would hardly miss its absence, and it would do little harm to let it drop. That the advice I had often given them as individuals, and as an association, to preserve perfect pecuniary independence for the sake of honour, of example, and of influence, I would in no way modify or explain away, now that its adoption affected my interest. Bather than I would be the cause of increasing their liabilities, I would at any time cancel my engagement without a murmur or a reproach, as nothing would reconcile me to the humiliation of receiving money due to their creditors.' The sentiments of the branch may be gathered from the course they pursued. They resolved to extend the subscription list, which has been done."* But four months later we find it stated in another report:—" Of my offer (reported in Herald, No. 3), which some months ago I found it my duty to make the branch, our executive have availed themselves, and my engage¬ ment here terminated on the 22nd of last month."f Once more setting out to seek employment, he returned to London, but with some resources he had little calculated on. Some months previously, the Directors of the Manchester Unity (of Odd Fellows) offered five prizes, of £10 each, for the five best lectures on the words Charity, Truth, Knowledge, Science, and Progression. Each lecture was to be an essay illustrating, in a popular style, the subject on which it treated, and not to occupy more than half an hour in delivery. The competition was thrown open to all members of the Order, and competitors were to send in their compositions anonymously, signed with a motto.J For these prizes Mr. Holyoake competed, taking for his motto Justitia suf- ficit, inscribed on a cube in isometrical perspective. There were seventy-nine competitors (some of them clergymen), but all the five prizes were awarded to Mr. Holyoake. When the arbitrators discovered to whom they had given the palm, they were surprised; but they were too honourable to retract their word, and the money was sent to him accordingly.§ It came precisely * Herald of Progress, No. 3. f Ibid, No. 11. X Beasoner, v., p. 275. § A gentleman, however, who had previously offered £50 for the copy¬ right of one of the lectures, withdrew his offer immediately the authorship was made known. Some two years later, an attempt was made to attach the stigma of Atheism to the Order of Odd Fellows, on the ground of their acceptance of Mr. Holyoake's essays; but it was shown in reply (and ad-</page><page sequence="17">AND MODERN ATHEISM. 11 when it was most wanted, at the abrupt termination of his Glasgow engage¬ ment; and with this £50 he came to London and started the Beasoner, of which the first number appeared on June 3, 1846. Although Mr. Holyoake's mental development at this time was, on the whole, very immature, yet he was then far more fitted for public usefulness than he had been at any previous period. Upright, fearless, and generous, he always was; but being thrown by circumstances into public life while his mental and moral training was very imperfect, his early productions were often exceedingly crude. How much he had to overcome in one special direction may be guessed from the following reminiscence, given in one of his lectures.* "My original patrimony was a haughty temper, a proud spirit, and an inflexible will, and I profess to be no immaculate oracle. During thirteen years, I stood twelve hours of every working day by the side of one man without ever forgetting or forgiving that he had insulted me—and I could boast as many trophies of ill-temper and malignant retorts as any man could be proud of. Eesentment was easy to me, and of all the Fables of iEsop, that of the man who had one eye put out that his enemy might lose both, was my favourite. But what was my surprise when first I found that the great, whom I had so long reverenced in their remoteness from me, were themselves the victims of those errors which belonged to my youth, igno¬ rance, and others' evil example. When I came in contact with those whom I had known only as models of emulation, and whose genius I worshipped, as some men do the creations of Theology, and found their brilliant reputa¬ tion tarnished by the mildews, not indeed of vulgar, but of refined animosity, I resolved, that though I had no reputation to tarnish, I would not tarnish myself." He set to work to conquer the impetuous irritability of his disposition, and succeeded so far as to incur no end of twittings for his "meekness," from those whose ideal of virtue does not include the element of self-control. In this self-discipline, his prison experience was of great service to him. From the marked difference in his tone before and after it, it appears to have been a turning-point in his development. And it is in itself a noble feature in his history, that personal ill-treatment, instead of embittering his feelings, tended to calm them. The temper which could be passionately excited by others' wrongs, learnt " experience and patience" from its own. The reader who will compare Mr. Holyoake's lecture on the arrest of Southwell with his letterf to the Cheltenham Free Press, written on the day after his own mitted by the Bishop of Oxford on their perusal) that the essays were no more Atheistic than they were Christian:—religion and politics being pro¬ nounced neutral questions by the Order, and Mr. Holyoake having confined himself strictly to the ethical bearings of the subjects under consideration. See Beasoner, No. 122, containing Mr. Holyoake's defence, and Beasoner, No. 133, containing an article on the subject reprinted from the Odd Fellows' Chronicle, concluding with the generous remark that'much as Mr. Holyoake hasbeen maligned and condemned by his assailants out of the Order, he has exhibited under their attacks a far higher amount of Christian charity and Christian forbearance than his—speaking to the letter—Christian opponents." * Beasoner, ii., p. 201. f " Last Trial for Atheism," pp. 88—93.</page><page sequence="18">12 GEORGE JACOB HOLYOAKE liberation, cannot fail to observe the noble amount of growth. By the time when he commenced the Beasoner, he had improved still more. A treatise which he published while at Glasgow, entitled "Eationalism," was the first ripe fruit of his mind's manhood. Though very open to criticism on some points, it is, as a whole, pervaded by a thoughtful, dignified, disciplined spirit, which contrasts pleasingly with the tone of his previous productions. The following passage will show the point from which the work is con¬ ceived :— "Because preference shares yield no interest, and community scrip finds no purchasers at this particular time, many persons, supposed to be well- grounded in Eationalism, have begun to despond. But that philosophy which is to elevate human nature and to be the guide and guardian of virtue, must not fluctuate with a joint-stock experiment; it must be higher than public opinion—it must not be shaken by relative success or failure; nor peculiar to any social condition—but fixed as truth, as universal and enduring."* Such were our Atheist's aspirations when commencing his new " Church of the Future." Before the Beasoner had been many weeks in existence, however, he began to surprise his readers by the tendency of his speculations. In the seventh number (p. 109) he announced that—" Infidelity has been too long a mere negation. It has reached a new point—it interests itself in social questions—it identifies itself with a practical system of morality. Its nega¬ tive theory must assert its positive influence, or the apathy of its present friends will be eternal." And in a letter to William Howitt in the same number he said— " To the doctrine of a Deity and prospect of immortality I have, and can have, no aversion—indeed I gladly see such conjectures strengthened!, and admissible evidence belonging thereto matured. As an intelligent [t. e. intellectual] speculation, it (Theology) will ever be one of the most absorbing in which mankind can be engaged. I am by no means anxious to refute all the arguments of the religious. Many are of no consequence, if true, and many I have pleasure in finding well supported; but as a whole I con¬ sider them to be of less weight than experience is, and therefore, when they are opposed to the dictates of experience, I reject them. This is the sense in which the Beasoner is anti-theological. As this is the first opportunity I have had of expressing these conceptions, I fear they may lack firmness of outline. But should they leave you in any doubt, I shall be willing, on hearing from you to that effect, to attempt more explicitness." This article brought down some anxious correspondents, one of whom held up his old Oracle articles to him, and thought his new views " quite opposed to those you formerly held; and if I fully understand your mean¬ ing, I think I can perceive a pretty considerable leaning to belief in God." " To this," replied the editor, " I answer, it is not a ' change,' so much as a more just and comprehensive view of Atheism to which I have to plead guilty....Those who regard Atheism as a mere negation of religion, regard it in its narrowest point of view....Surely something remains beyond....The Atheist, when in argument he has set up morality over religion, is bound to set it up in practice, to evidence to the world, in his own person and con¬ duct, the value of his theory. If he no longer owns the authority of religion, * " Eationalism," p. 8.</page><page sequence="19">AND MODERN ATHEISM. 13 he has to demonstrate that he owns the authority of reason and benevolence —he has to show, by his active endeavours to recover others from the dark¬ ness from which he has been relieved, that his Atheism has some vitality in it, and is not, as I have too often seen it, merely critical, cold, and selfish. " This is one of the enlargements of Atheism, which seems to be impera¬ tively called for. Another seems wanting—a moral ground, on which both Atheist and Theist can stand. So long as each denies to the other a particle of reason on his side—so long as each maintains an infallibility of pre¬ tension to complete truth—they both assume what is contrary to the nature of things, and exclude the common ground which must be established be¬ tween them, where truth and error can join issue. There is no impassable gulf between contending men or contending opinions, but that dug by pride and passion. We all have a common starting-point. We have a common consciousness of impression—a common nature to investigate—a common sincerity actuates us—truth is our common object, and we have a common interest in discovering it "In the department of physics (the most conclusive, be it observed, and where strictest reasoning can be applied), I find little argument in favour of Theism. But in the department of metaphysics, as respects man's nature and aspirations, there do appear some few probabilities in favour of it. No sound system of metaphysics can be propounded which is not based on the admission of certain aptitudes of all men—such as Adam Smith has treated in his ' Moral Sentiments.' Of these, the aspiration to higher qualities and character, and the ceaseless progression of man, seem to point to an after life. That all that pertains to the feelings is to some extent delusive—men change so with circumstances, I am fully aware; but the probabilities, such as they are, in candour should be admitted."* Another " enlargement of Atheism" was visible a few weeks afterwards. A correspondent writes:— "Sir,—I have been asked,how is it that the Beasoner quotes with approval Christian divines, such as Theodore Parker and others It strikes me as unusual in a publication devoted to Naturalism. Does it imply, as Mr. Saunderson supposes, a leaning to Goddism?" To which the Editor replies:— " It matters little where it leans, so long as there is truth in what it means. Sceptics should pride themselves on being eclectics—in selecting the good wherever it appears."f No. 27 of the Beasoner contained an exposition, by Mr. Holyoake, of the principles of the "Society of Theological Utilitarians," whose "professed objects " were the following:— " L The extirpation of the grosser religions, and the refutation of the refined ones, II. The registering of theological arguments—distinguishing such as remain unanswered, from such as have been refuted. III. The re¬ duction of the authority of the Bible to the level of profane history—Moses to the level of Mahomet—David to Milton—Paul to Cicero. TV. The promulgation of systematic morality, founded on the nature of man and his harmonious relation to external things; a morality independent of religion, and which, instead of showing men to heaven, shows them to themselves; * Beasoner, No. 10, " Delineations of Atheism." f Beasoner, No. 17, p. 239, "Progressive Christians."</page><page sequence="20">14 GEORGE JACOB HOLYOAKE and, as Bishop Butler expresses it, • deduces their course of life and beha¬ viour from that which their real natures point out.' " As those who are without religion are commonly affirmed to be without morality—as those who negative the current affirmations of Theology are held to negative humanity, honour, fraternity, and every other virtue, the follow¬ ing explanation is offered of the principles in which the members of this society do believe, and which are demonstrable primarily and independently of any religion. " They believe in the inherent tendency of Humanity to goodness, in the invincibility of Truth, the sufficiency of Season, and the duty of Justice. " They believe in the poet's creed—that human nature is best elevated by delineations of the beautiful and true—and that portraitures of the wrong are only necessary to perfect the distinctness and attractiveness of the right. " That all human duties properly commence from man, and the wise use of life is the just use of this world." In No. 57 of the Beasoner, Mr. Holyoake, in surveying the "Influence of the Pulpit in the Nineteenth Century," attains a still greater distinct¬ ness. Speaking of the " untutored, because infantine enthusiasm" with which Theology had been chiefly assailed, he said:— " Anti-religious controversy, which was originally, and ever should be, but a means of rescuing morality from the dominion of future-world speculation, became an end—noisy, wordy, vexed, capricious, angry, impu¬ tative, recriminative, and interminable. " To reduce this chaos of aims to some plan, to discriminate objects, to proportion attention to them, to make controversy just as well as earnest, and, above all, to rescue morality from the ruins of theological arguments, were the intentions of the Beasoner. It began by announcing itself ' Utilita¬ rian in Morals,' and resting upon utility as a basis. In all reforms it took unequivocal interest, and only assailed Theology when Theology assailed Utility. The Beasoner aimed not so much to create a party, as to establish a purpose. It threw aside the name of 'Infidel,' because it was chiefly borne by men who were disbelievers in secret, but who had seldom the honour to avow it openly. It threw aside the term ' Sceptic' as a noun, as the name of a party, because it wished to put an end to a vain and cavilling race, who had made the negation of Theology a profession, and took advan¬ tage of their disbelief in the church to disbelieve in honour and truth." Passing by several articles which are "progressive steps in the same series," we find in No. 106 of the Beasoner, the first of several chapters on the "Moral Eemains of the Bible;" that Bible of which Mr. Holyoake had said in his reply to Maitland at Cheltenham, in 1842," I flee the Bible as a viper." But now that he had been training himself " to make controversy just as well as earnest," he regarded the subject differently. The " Moral Eemains" are thus prefaced:— " Of late years numerous books have been written exposing errors, incon¬ sistencies, and immoralities in the Bible. But we cannot conceal from ourselves that this practice, by familiarising the public with vicious incidents, has a tendency to increase the evil it seeks to cure. It has, however, had its use in revealing to the unsuspecting the mixed character of this incon¬ gruous compilation, and in checking the indiscriminate eulogy with which policy or ignorance has loaded this book. A more pleasing, but not less effective task remains, that of abstracting and presenting, as a whole, such</page><page sequence="21">AND MODERN ATHEISM. 15 moral excellences as it contains, and thereby demonstrating, in an unob- noxious way, the disparity between the evil and the good " The greater part of those who accept the Bible, accept it altogether; and those who reject it, reject it altogether. There is, perhaps, less discrimina¬ tion shown in the judgment of the book than any other (sic). But it seems to me not more just than wise to act differently—for he only who yields full admiration of excellences, is fairly qualified to enter his protest against de¬ fects; and vice versa. The inculcation of a discriminating habit needs to be forcibly insisted on. Half, and indeed more than half, of the theological discussions of which I have had experience, have not so much been founded on disagreements about essential truths, as on exaggerations and wholesale assertions." The " Moral Eemains " were never completed, and the chapters thereof which were published in the Beasoner show that the work would have been too fragmentary to have been of much use. But it is interesting as a theo¬ logical exercise of Mr. Holyoake's. Here is a specimen of it—his comment on the narratives concerning Abram and Lot, Gen. xiii., xiv. " It was striking good sense in Abram not to enter into the quarrel of his retainers. There is a patriarchal majesty about Abram's proposal, that does him infinite honour. This willingness to oblige Lot, where the pride of an ordinary man would have resolved itself into pernicious obstinacy, makes this a fine example of the fraternal disposition. It is pacific dignity per¬ sonated [i. e. personified] A fine old Hebrew gentleman, all of the olden time, was Abram."* A little tract deserves notice here, which, though not published separately until 1850, was mainly composed in 1848. "The Logic of Death"—by which title one must conclude the author to mean the logic for (the hour of) death—is an earnest and even eloquent expression of Atheistic faith; but there is a sombreuess in its tone which does not convey a consolatory im¬ pression of that faith, though it excites additional respect for the manliness with which the author has " accepted the order of things he found without complaint, and attempted their improvement without despair."! While thus developing in " matters pertaining to religion," Mr. Holyoake was also engaged in secular labours, of which a brief notice should here be given. In 1844, he published the first of a series of Educational Hand-books for the Working Classes, entitled " Practical Grammar." This lively volume was said by the Spectator to be "written in the conjoint style of Punch and an Ultra-Eadical setting the world to rights;" a judgment not far from the truth. Interjections are not allowed, by our practical grammarian, to be parts of speech, because they appear to him to display weakness of mind, and he is desirous to correct our morals as well as our language. " If I were," sounds to his exclusively English-taught ear, like the combination of a singu¬ lar pronoun with a plural verb; he, therefore, in the cause of veracity, extin¬ guishes the subjunctive mood forthwith. Yet, notwithstanding these and other crudities, the book is useful and suggestive. It is, moreover, conceived from the right point of view—that of seeking the distinctions of lan¬ guage in the nature of things J more directly than had previously been the case. * Beasoner, vol. v., p. 65. f "Logic of Death," p. 13. X "Practical Grammar," pp. 9, 14, 66.</page><page sequence="22">16 GEORGE JACOB HOLYOAKE " Practical Grammar " was followed, in 1846, by the " Hand-book of Gram¬ mar," which, besides many suggestive hints and questions, contained a pleas¬ ing selection of extracts for grammatical exercises. This work was soon followed by " Mathematics no Mystery; or the Beauties and Uses of Euclid," a treatise which was written nine years previous to its publication, and which bears evident marks of the fact in its more juvenile and diffuse style. But even in an essay on lines and angles, the inborn tendency of the author to entertain dreams of moral perfectibility* thus manifests itself:— "An important connection is beginning to be established between the principles of science and morality. More than one philosopher is found to acknowledge that 'the axioms of Physics translate those of Ethics.'-)" The desire of aiding to some extent the development of this fact, was not one of the least reasons which has dictated the compilation of the 'Beauties and Uses of Euclid.' "J In lb47, Mr. Holyoake began to contribute literary articles to the People's Press, a liberal (but not anti-religious) magazine, edited, in the Isle of Man, by Mr. William Shirrefs. Among these articles, two papers entitled "Hints to the Advocates of the Eights of Women," and two others on "Loyola an Exemplar to Modern Eeformers," deserve mention as being remarkable for their manly sense and noble tone.§ In 1848, when the brilliant series of events on the Continent renewed in our English artisans all the intensity of previously-drooping political life, for the wise direction of which but few were prepared—Mr. Holyoake sym¬ pathised warmly in all the thrilling sensations of the time, while he anxiously sought to cultivate among his fellow-artisans those principles of stead¬ fast self-possession and intelligent forethought by which alone the reality of progress can be ensured. On the eve of the celebrated 10th of April, he delivered to a crowded audience of Chartists, a lecture|| on the disadvantages of violence as a means of promoting liberty, in a country where free discus¬ sion is safe. In the May following, he joined Mr. W. J. Linton in conduct¬ ing a small newspaper entitled the Cause of the People, which only lasted nine weeks. Soon after this ceased, he accepted a situation on the Spirit of the Age, a Socialist newspaper, in which, besides several literary articles, he wrote a series of political letters under the signature of Ion.*[ After the * See Appendix, A. f Emerson. X " Mathematics no Mystery," p. 12. § These four articles were reprinted in Nos. 63,75, &amp; 77, of the Beasoner. || See Beasoner, No. 99, " On the Chances of obtaining an English Eepub- lic by Moral Means." % The choice of this pseudonym " was founded on the following passage in Sergeant Talfourd's preface to the fourth edition of his tragedy of Ion:— ' The idea of the principal character—that of a nature essentially pure and disinterested, deriving strength entirely from goodness and thought, not overcoming evil by the force of will, but escaping it by insensibility to its approach—vividly conscious of existence and its pleasures, yet willing to lay them down at the call of duty.' The assumption of the name, associ¬ ated with this description, of course is not intended to imply the assumption of these qualities. It is permitted to us to admire what we do not pretend to realise. But if one combination of character more than another may be usefully studied, it is that which presents hope without dependence, enjoy-</page><page sequence="23">AND MODERN ATHEISM. 17 cessation of the Spirt* of the Age, in March, 1849, theseletters were continued at intervals in the Beasoner, and afterwards in the Leader. These Ion letters have been the subject of much criticism and controversy, but few ob¬ jectors seem to have comprehended the stand-point from which they were written. The one idea which they ever, in various directions, enforce and illustrate, is this;—that Impulse is but the raw material of Character, and needs the direction of experienced reason and disciplined conscience ere it can attain a ripe development; that consequently, political life, as a branch of moral life, demands special culture and severe self-training—and that without these, mere indignation against oppression, or passionate love of freedom, will avail nothing to abate the power of wrong, or hasten the advent of right.* By many an impulsive politician this doctrine has been bitterly cried down as cold and treacherous, and Ion has been denounced, in broadside and epigram, as false to liberty and to his own previous profes¬ sions. This is not the first time, and will not be the last, that the severe self- restraint of a passionate soul has been mistaken for coldness, and a life of unceasing renunciation set down as traitorously politic. But those who love liberty for her own sake, can afford to meet such misapprehensions as the inevitable reward of serving her effectively among a generation on whom the very idea of political education is but just beginning to dawn. In 1848 appeared the fourth volume of Mr. Holyoake's Educational Series, entitled "A Logic of Facts; or, Plain Hints on Seasoning." The "plain hints on reasoning" are mostly excellent; but the "logic of facts" which our author endeavours to elaborate, is open to grave objections, which have been well stated in a review of the book which appeared in the Athenaum:— " Ordinary logic is simply the art of deriving correct inferences from true premises. Mr. Holyoake wishes for some form of science which will test the truth of the premises—something which might be assimilated to pure mathematics. Now something of this kind, it is well known, the late Mr. Coleridge meant to attempt in his never-executed work, • Logosophia.' Mr. Holyoake, we are afraid, has not calculated the difficulty of the undertaking when he presumes that it could be executed in a popular treatise like the present. Mr. Holyoake predicates that the perception of truth is possible to man; and using this predicate as the foundation-stone of his proposed 'Logic of Facts,' he proceeds to illustrate and define his 'Truth.' ' Truth,' he tells us, ' in sculpture, means an exact similitude of some living form chiselled in stone or marble. Truth in painting is a natural representation, on canvass, of some person or object.' In both instances he has confounded Truth with what is more properly distinguished by the aesthetic reasoner as Eeahty. ' An assertion,' he says, ' which represents things as they really are, is a truth.' Now this looseness of style may suit a popular treatise, but must not pretend to a scientific title. Truth is some¬ thing higher and other than is inspired in either Mi. Holyoake's definition or his illustrations. It is something absolute and universal; not any parti¬ cular and relative representation, such as those to which he has referred— ment without infatuation, indifference to danger without fatalism, and strength without antagonism. It was in appreciation of this view that the nom de guerre in question was adopted."—Spirit of the Age, No. 29. * See Appendix B. c</page><page sequence="24">18 GEORGE JACOB HOLYOAKE strangely enough, considering that he will not permit us to call' a fact' a truth, but' only an element in truth.' Mr. Holyoake deals largely in cita¬ tions, showing that he has been an industrious reader; but compiled remarks, definitions, syllogisms, inductions, &amp;c, do not compose, under his hands, anything that deserves to be called a ' Logic of Facts.' "* In the following year Mr. Holyoake published the last of his Educational Handbooks,—" Eudiments of Public Speaking and Debate,"—an admirable little work, full of valuable hints for all situations of life, whether public or private, in which the conquest of opinion is desired. In the early part of 1850, Mr. Holyoake edited a monthly magazine, entitled the People's Beview, which ceased after the third number, chiefly for want of funds. The plan on which this review was conducted was a new one in liteiature, and deserves recording. It is thus described in the Preface to the completed volume:— " This Eeview has differed from the Quarterlies inasmuch as it has given expositions of the principles of Communist, Eepublican, Eeligious, and Dietetic Eeformers, and even of despotic monarchists. We intended to carry the rule out, and embrace every order of thinkers, of whatever side, who from time to time should attract public attention and influence opinion. The Quarterlies bestow expositions on their own party only, and traduce or silence all others. In this Eeview writers, who might be considered ' Ee- presentative Men,' have had the opportunity of developing their own views, with no other restriction than that of speaking in the third person—not as partisans, but as expositors. Poles have treated Polish books, Germans German questions, Eeligious Thinkers religious topics; and when, in the course of time, we came to irreligious subjects, irreligious men would have been the expounders. We would never alloy the integrity of truth nor outrage the sacred right of conscience by serving up a man's soul second¬ hand." To resume the thread of our Atheist's religious history. In the beginning of 1849 he published a brief and well-condensed memoir of Eichard Carlile, which, though written with affectionate respect, manifests a very creditable degree of impartiality. " For," as our author remarks, "he who encouraged me to maintain the truth at my own expense, would be quite willing, if need be, that I maintain it at his."'f In 1851, Mr. Holyoake published a small essay, the matter of which had evidently been some time in his thoughts—" The Philosophic Type of Ee- ligion, as developed by Professor Newman, stated, examined, and answered." Those Christians who are anxious for the conversion of Freethinkers would do well to study, in this little treatise, the remarkable effect which the faith of Francis Newman has produced on the mind of his Atheist reviewer. He characterises " The Soul" as a work " conceived in the highest genius of prose- Jytism, which must command respect for the religious sentiment wherever it is read." Further on, he adds:—" That which strikes me as the secret of its proselytising power is its absolute candour Knowing that no earnest men are wholly in the wrong in matters of humanity, he [Mr. Newman] does not fear to admit what is right on his opponent's side, which certainly does not indispose an opponent to admit what is right on his. He thus inspires you * Athenceum, No. 1085. f " Life and Character of Eichard Carlile," p. vL</page><page sequence="25">AND MODERN ATHEISM. 19 with confidence and respect, and this is the foundation of all healthy con¬ currence. This predisposing element to uniformity Mr. Newman's book has eminently. If one does not concur in it, it is because of the presence of intellectual error—no prejudice stands between the reader and the author. Others, besides Christians, who study its ability, may learn of its wisdom of manner, in the written and oral advocacy of their views."..."Eeligious per¬ sons have often remarked to me, 'You will find the same genial utterances of piety in the writings of many other divines [as well as] in Mr. Newman's.' In one sense this is true; there are passages of generous inspiration in the works of many eminent preachers, but expressed with less explicitness, and besides, followed by a certain equivocation which leaves you in doubt whe¬ ther you may trust them. With Mr. Newman there is an unmistakableness which you feel to be at once reliable. There are no subtle texts of Scrip¬ ture coming in to dilute his meaning—there are no theories of divinity crushing the vitality out of every generous affirmation. What he says once he says all through—not in one or two passages, but on every page."* The quick perceptiveness with which Mr. Holyoake, in re-stating Mr. Newman's theistic argument, seizes upon all its salient points—the kindred intuitiveness and ready sympathy with which he appreciates the moral ele¬ vation, and even the spiritual beauty which pervade that admirable work, sufficiently indicate to all who have eyes to see, that he is by no means defi¬ cient in religious seusibility, and that his Atheism is but an accident of his intellectual development. One sign of this may be seen in the affirmative point from which lie comments on his author. Speaking of the section on the Sabbath, he says:—" These are the parts of the book which the public will suppose most congenial to us, but we have no intention to dwell upon them We have chosen rather to dwell on those affirmative develop¬ ments which are additions to our insight into religious phenomena."—"No review of this book has come under my notice which conveys the full spirit of it, and much I distrust my own power to supply what I feel to be wanting. All accounts of its daringness, of its strong rejection of so much to which the mass of believers cliug in indiscriminating adoration, refer only to that which constitutes the framework of the book, without its life—indeed less than that, for such rejection is merely the clearing of the ground in order to occupy it by a new superstructure."—" No man, whether believer or Atheist, can read this book without great improvement, unless he be very good in¬ deed, or entirely incapable of moral appreciation."—" To children of the people, to whom scholastic guidance is never vouchsafed, beguiled by a show of popular learning which seduces them, and abandons them to medi¬ ocrity, such a book as this—profound in thought, affectionate in spirit, trusty in report, accurate in speech—is an epoch in personal history, disci¬ plining the understanding, and giving a new tone to character."! And there can be little doubt that " The Soul" has given a new tone to Mr. Holyoake's character.^ It has quickened into more distinct form all that was previously working in him towards noble development. In almost everything note-worthy which he has done or said since then, an attentive observer may trace the gracious influence of Francis Newman;—not in the * " Philosophic Type," pp. 9, 15. f Ibid, pp. 7, 8, 9, 16. X For this reason I have spoken of his impressions of the work in re¬ ference to the time at which he read it (on its first appearance in 1849), which was two years before his review of it was published.</page><page sequence="26">20 GEORGE JACOB IIOLYOAKE form of a servile imitation, but in that recasting of ideal aspiration, and that clearer perception and fuller development of high principles, which form the manliest tribute that one independent soul can pay to the excellence of another. When the death of Henry Hetherington occurred, in August, 1849, Mr, Holyoake conducted the funeral service, which took place at his burial, in Ken sal Green Cemetery; a service which I have heard religious persons describe as deeply impressive. The following remarks, affixed to the dis¬ course when published,* indicate Mr. Holyoake's feeling on the subject:— " It seems to me that nothing is gained by dispensing with the Church Service, unless something, as carefully considered and more personally con¬ scientious, is put in its place. It seems to mc that, in point of solemnity and decorum, the Church Service is perfect; and in every substitution of ours, the qualities of propriety and earnestness should be most anxiously and effectually preserved. It has come under my observation, that some burials of our friends have been conducted where the possibility has been left open of irrelevant things being said—and sometimes they have been said. As far as this can be guarded against it should be—and to write what facts and thoughts are proposed to be expressed is the best precaution we can take to prevent it. It must not be left open for any man to think that freedom of thought, which we claim to express, is not quite compatible with good taste. That philosophy which wants sensibility is false. It must be put past all doubt that scepticism of clerical error does not deprive us of the feelings of men, or the reverence of humanity." Passing over nearly two volumes of the Beasoner, we find, in No. 252, this declaration:— "What I am anxious to guard against, is the impression that we acknowledge as of our party, that numerous class of persons in this country who are simply ignorant of, or indifferent to, religion; who will cavil at a prophecy, or sneer at a humble believer, but who are susceptible of no generous in¬ spiration of moral truth, nor make any sacrifices to enlighten those whom they affect to regard as superstitious....These we do not count, nor even another class, who are simply neutral and negative. We only include those whose Atheism is active and fruitful—those who are Atheists, not from re¬ action, but from examination and conviction, and whose rejection of Chris¬ tian tenets is translatable into a clearer moral life, and into systematic and patient endeavours for the benefit of others."! Still later we find, in a funeral discourse on Mrs. Martin, the following acknowledgment:— "If we do but pierce beneath the antagonism from which all development issues, we shall see how, both with the Christian and the Freethinker, the same intention is ever at the bottom. We perceive a principle from different points, trace it to different roots, explain it in a different language, maintain it for different reasons, and foresee for it different conclusions: but the conflict continued, sometimes darkly, sometimes wildly, is for one mo¬ rality and for one truth; and if there be in the end a Judge who looks with * In No. 172 of the Beasoner, but since reprinted, with other matter, in a pamphlet entitled "The Life and Character of Henry Hetherington." f Beasoner, x., p. 386.</page><page sequence="27">AND MODERN ATHEISM. 21 an equal eye on all, he will not fail to discern the motive and pardon the means."* From these passages it will be seen that a change was beginning to come over Mr. Holyoake's speculations. Most of the original minds who com¬ mence active life on the side of Negation, come to alter their formal creed after some years' conflict with the realities of life. Many fail for want of personal or intellectual self-reliance, and turn to the Affirmations of Ortho¬ doxy for moral support Others, of less impressible temperament, grow fanatic and impracticable, from the inability to perceive any truths beyond those which are peculiarly constitutional to themselves. But the healthiest and happiest of the band, escaping both the Scylla of submission and the Charybdis of isolation, emerge safely into the Affirmations which are the true complements of their original Negations, and which, though long unanalyscd and but half perceived, have really been the central fountains from which that negative preaching derived all its generous life-blood. Thus it befel with Mr. Holyoake, The impulse which had hitherto actu¬ ated his career, had been an intense antagonism to those religious dogmas which, as he believed, tended to hinder the development of justico and love among men. Eising by degrees to a higher point of view, he began to see " how, both with the Christian and the Freethinker, the same intention is ever at the bottom"—that the conflict " is for one morality and for one truth"—that the prevalent forms of religion were but varying statements of the same great facts of Nature, Life, Death, and Aspiration, from which his own beliefs arose. Gradually it dawned upon him that Negations, however necessary, are only useful relatively to surrounding circumstances, while Affirmative Truth is permanently valuable for its own sake. And, therefore, although not sheathing the sword while the forces of Error remain a-field, he has come to devote his chief efforts to the .development of Affirmative Life on a free basis. The first steps of this movement must now be chronicled. In 1852, Mr. Holyoake commenced organising the English Freethinkers into a regular body,—inspiring them with clearer purposes both in doctrine -and discipline. The Atheism which barred him from incarnating his aspi¬ rations in any form of spiritual faith, and the " Pure Moralism "f which, like a foeus, absorbed and concentrated all the enthusiasm of his nature, now combined to suggest one definite ideal, and Secularism arose in his mind as a distinct faith; the pure and wise use of this world, independently of the belief in a God as its ruler, or a futurity for its continuation. It was in the spring of 1851, that Mr. Holyoake first used the term " Secularist," as being more complete and distinctive than that of " Atheist?" but it was not until some time afterwards that he felt the full force of the improvement, and made a distinct stand thereupon. In October, 1852, the First Secular Con¬ ference was held at Manchester, Mr. Holyoake being in the chair. The circular then discussed and agreed to, on the " Constitution and objects of Secular Societies," was terse, practical, and morally instructive. In the previous December, Mr. Holyoake had issued the prospectus of a " Library of Freethought, Politics, and Culture," entitled the " Cabinet of Beason," the object of which was to do something towards filling " the * " Last Days of Mrs. Emma Martin," p. 7.

The first volume of this series, " The Task of To-Day," was by Mr. Evans Bell, and though not equal to Mr. Holyoake's writings in power and discrimination, it is the production of a thoughtful mind, and is preceded by a preface of earnest and noble indi¬ viduality. The second volume of the "Cabinet of Eeason" was by Mr. Holyoake, and bore the title, " Why do the Clergy avoid Discussion, and the Philosophers discountenance it?" This little work, earnest, spirited, and direct, created some sensation among the Evangelical world, which resulted in the holding of a six nights' discussion in January and February, 1853, between Mr. Holyoake and the Eev. Brewin Grant (of Birmingham), at the Cowper Street Institution in London.* An authorised report of this Discus¬ sion was (after revision from both speakers) published by Ward and Co., and duly advertised and sold in religious quarters—a new feature of the Freethinking movement. Mr. Holyoake's speeches in this Discussion contain some of the fullest ex¬ positions of Secularism which he has yet published. That which forms the leading idea of the whole he thus expounded: — " Let any one look below the mere surface of pulpit declamation, and ask himself two questions: what has even reputed Atheism, on the whole, meant? And what has it, on the whole, sought? even as to its negative and least favourable side. It has, in modern times, disbelieved all accounts of the origin of nature by an act of creation, and of the government of nature by a Supreme Being distinct from nature. It has felt these accounts to be unin¬ telligible and misleading, and has suggested that human dependence and morals in their widest sense should be founded on a basis independent of scriptural authority; and it has done this under the conviction, expressed, or unexpressed, that greater simplicity, unanimity, and earnestness of moral effort would be the result. This is what it has meant, and this is what it has sought." " Our particular inability to attain to the desired solution, and our attempt to walk by an independent light, you describe by the term ' Atheism,' a name which associates guilt with dissent. It is quite true that till very lately, we used this priest-made term; but when we clearly found that we were spending our time in re-educating the public in the right meaning of a nega¬ tive term, when we might be educating them in positive principles, we declined any longer to employ anarne, which, as understood by Christians, distorted and falsified our objects wherever it was heard. We therefore resolved to choose a new name (Secularism), which should express the practical and moral element always concealed in the word Atheism...Now, Secularism seeks the personal Law of duty, the Sphere of duty, and the Power by which duty may work independently. The Law is found in natural, utilitarian, and artistic morals. The Sphere is this, to work with our first energies in this life, for this life—for its growth, culture, development, and progress. The Power is discovered in science, the Providence of life, and intelligence. The problem solved by Secularism is this, that this partially-comprehended and unexplored universe is yet, in its material and ascertainable relations to man, a possible theatre of the limitless happiness of humanity—that the * At the close of this Discussion, Mr. Grant's friends subscribed to send him on a three years" mission among the English Freethinkers.</page><page sequence="29">AND MODERN ATHEISM. 23 light of duty may be seen, that a life of usefulness may be led, indefinite refinement may be attained, and tranquillity in death, and the highest desert in untried existence beyond us may be won, though the Origin of all things be hidden from us, and the Eevelations of every religious sect shall be rejected."* Mr. Brewin Grant's method of opposing Mr. Holyoake was then, and has ever since been, to do all in his power to undermine Mr. H.'s personal reputation, by resorting to the meanest insinuations, and the grossest abuse. He has even carried this policy so far as to create much disgust in the minds of a considerable portion of his own party. To their castigation he may be left: for his disgraceful conduct renders him utterly unworthy of criticism from any other quarter. In the autumn of 1853, Mr. Holyoake published a little treatise on " Or¬ ganisation: not of Anns, but Ideas," forming the third volume of the " Cabinet of Season." It aims at being a manual of the morals of public duty, and it contains, also, many valuable hints for private self-discipline. Few working-class hortatives rival it in terse and manly power, except Thomas Cooper's excellent "Letters to the Young Men of the Working Classes." At the end of 1853, Mr. Holyoake opened a shop at 147, Fleet Street, where, having purchased the business of Mr. James Watson (for many years the respected publisher of English artizan Fieethought under the shadow of St. Paul's), he now conducts his Secular organisation on an increased scale. Since the opening of this shop, he has published a little tract on " Secularism, the Affirmative Philosophy of the People"—being a revised collection of some of the best thoughts he has uttered on that sub¬ ject. He has also held another Discussion with the Eev. Brewin Grant, at Glasgow, in October, 1854,— the report of which was revised by both speakers previous to publication.! In the latter of these Discussions, Mr. Holyoake has made some admis¬ sions which deserve notice. In his concluding speech he said:— " There are higher objections brought against Secularism than those we have listened to in this debate. I allude to such as say, that that view of thought which looks to Eealism, and trusts it, is inadequate to satisfy the longings of nature, and supply exalted emotions to those who have these opinions. We say...the field of Eealism is mostly untrodden, and the true inspirations of life not merely unnoticed, but denied....There are only two senses in which the word 'Eeligion' is intelligibly used. First. Its strict sense, which includes the proposition of the existence of God as ascertained, and regards God as an object of conscious worship and trust. In this strict sense, Eeligion is a separate question from Secularism. Second. In the relative sense of the word 'Eeligion,' we, perhaps, are not logically excluded from its use. Though we regard human duties as commencing from Man, we consider the promotion of human happiness, purity, and pro¬ gress, as something which would meet the approval of Deity. If there is not the recognition of God in Secularism, there is, as in all pure Moralism, * Cowper Street Discussion, pp. 27, 221. f One other of Mr. Holyoake's Discussions has been properly revised— that with the Eev. Mr. Eutherford in August, 1853. But these three Dis¬ cussions are the only ones the accuracy of whose reports is to be relied upon, and even these are not free from mistakes of print.</page><page sequence="30">24 GEORGE JACOB HOLYOAKE the contingency of God. If Deity be not with us a dogma, it is reverted to as an ideality. Eecognising Nature as the great Self-existence, we say, if there be a God of personal attributes, Nature is God. And if the All be conscious, intelligent, humane, and equitable, our sincerity and our endea¬ vours will be in harmony with the Universal Nature. We regard God, when we realise the idea of his possible existence, as the infinite enlargement of man's purest nature and highest faculties.* Our principles, therefore, though not founded upon knowledge of God, as the eternal, independent Cause of all existence, are compatible with all the trustful attributes of such a Being. Thus, while we found our principles upon the ascertained operations of Nature, and have the advantage of proceeding with the cer¬ tainty of human experience, we establish the moral right to the Supreme approbation, if in life, or after death, we shall find ourselves in personal relation thereto. In this relative and ethical sense, we might claim to be considered religious. For, if Secularism does not proceed upon the know¬ ledge of a God Actual, it moves towards a God Possible."f Here then, we close this biographical sketch: having traced Mr. Holy¬ oake's progress from a feverish Evangelical piety, through many phases of inquiry and so-called " infidelity," till at last, after thirteen years of Athe¬ istic activity we leave him gradually, but unmistakably, " moving towards a God Possible." In attempting to estimate Mr. Holyoake's character as a public teacher, the chief characteristic thereof which attracts the attention appears to be this:—that in theological criticism, which is usually abandoned to the keenest, coldest exercise of the mere intellect, he is remarkable for the pre¬ eminence of his moral development. He is not a systematic thinker. Though endowed with manly good sense, and frequently flashing forth striking and eloquent thoughts, he is remarkably deficient in speculative ' genius. Whenever he dwells on purely metaphysical subjects (which is not often), he seldom utters anything beyond mere common-places; and the small amount of metaphysical belief to which he does subscribe, appears frequently to escape his memory, if we may judge by the inconsistent canons which he lays down on matters connected therewith. His literary culture is also very imperfect—a circumstance which frequently leads him into awkward blunders. His little treatises, indeed, are carefully compiled, and well written, but his periodical writings perpetually suffer from his want of regular mental training. His name could never take literary rank be¬ side those of a Strauss, a Comte, a Bobert Mackay, or a Francis Newman. Still less can he pretend to the poetic genius which garlands the heresies of a Shelley or an Emerson. What, then, is the inspiration which, for thirteen tireless years, has urged on his steps, amid every variety of dislike and dis¬ couragement? It is the resolution to conquer a free field for human eon- sci'e?jce,where, unfettered by harsh .creeds and unjust laws, it may develop into its true proportions, and assume its rightful position as the pupil of Nature and the guardian of Life. In this faith, Mr. Holyoake makes the circuit of creeds and customs, pleading for the application of Morality to all that pertains to Eeligion. In some respects, this is no novelty: the im¬ moralities of Dogmatic Theology have been indicated by along succession of * " The Soul," by F. W. Newman, f Glasgow Discussion, pp. 214-I5k</page><page sequence="31">AND MODERN ATHEISM. 25 brilliant writers, living and dead. But scarcely any one of these has genuinely endeavoured to deal with the practical difficulty as Mr. Holyoake has done. He has clearly understood what very few have even begun to perceive—that these harsh and crude dogmas will never be dethroned till we show their upholders that our sympathy with them as men is greater than our differ¬ ence from them as theologians;—till we behave to them with the respect, the good-will, in a word, with the humanity, which we complain of them for not manifesting towards us. To what purpose do we denounce the doo- trine of God's vengeance on sinners, if we cherish vengeful feelings against those who differ from us If we deem our arguments to be slightingly met, are we quite sure that we, in our turn, have taken care to show full- hearted justice to all the elements of truth in the writings of our oppo¬ nents? It is in setting a noble example in these rarely-attempted virtues, that Mr. Holyoake has made an important practical contribution to the pu¬ rification of religious controversy: a contribution, the value and grace of which are enhanced by the pressure of civil wrong and social scorn under which it has been made. To endure all the varieties of hostility and hate, which inevitably beset such a career as his, without losing the disposition of good-will and the habit of gentle speech,—to do this with no support from God's love, without even the placidity of natural temperament to aid him,— with no sustainment but the chastened instincts of a generous heart—this indicates no common soul, and is, in itself, sufficient to entitle Mr. Holyoake to no merely tolerant consideration. Now, the generosity and liberality of Mr. Holyoake's character have been recognised by many persons whose theological positions are widely different from his own: but scarcely any one has appreciated the aspiration of his nature. Almost every critic has regarded Secularism as a system of nega¬ tions, which aims to rob Christians of their faith: whereas, its main purpose is to bring out a common ground on which persons of differing faith may work together for human welfare and happiness. Mr. Holyoake's error has been that he did not know how to define this common ground without in¬ cluding in his definition the materialistic and Atheistic arguments which had, in some measure, paved the road thereunto for himself and his own party. It was impossible for any one, Christian or otherwise, who truly believed in the Providence of God, and the immortality of man, to subscribe the declarations contained in the Address of the London Secular Society.* But it is none the less certain that Mr. Holyoake's object in drawing up those declarations was to include in one body all who could conscientiously join the Atheist party in Secular activities, whatever their personal creed.f But the outlying world, which knew little or nothing of the modern Atheist party till quite recently, has attributed the remnants of Atheism which accompany Secularism, to the agency of Secularism itself, and has treated that as a "terrible negation," which is, in fact, an endeavour to escape from the atmosphere of negations into the active service of Humanity. For although many grave negations are implied in Secularism, yet the point from which they are dealt with is an affirmative one—viz., that human life, whatever its antecedents or consequents, is in itself a noble opportunity, and * See Appendix C. f An illustration of this may be seen in the fact, that each official circular of Secularism has contained less and less of Atheism.</page><page sequence="32">26 GEORGE JACOB HOLYOAKE that whether or no a Father sustains us, or a futurity awaits us, we should do right here and now, and realise the pure life of nature while it is yet ours. It is perhaps well, that after all the selfish moralities which have been preached, even by men whose generosity of nature is beyond a 'doubt,— concerning the impossibility of maintaining virtue or peace without the consolations of religion,—it is well that a sect should arise who affirm that reward and consolation are not indispensable to the true man; that for him, virtue is enough, and " all other pleasures are not worth her pains." And the world condemns this heroic doctrine as wanting in faith Truly did Bronson Alcott say, that " the current version of all sacred books is pro¬ fane;" and the Christianity of England has illustrated the idea by its utter non-perception of the innate sacredness of Human Life, and the influence which the unselfish performance of life's duties must exercise in leading pure minds onward to the Source of all sacrednoss. It is not by sudden leaps that changes can be wrought in the convictions of thoughtful men; and had the opponents of Atheism welcomed Secularism as a step in the right direction, and encouraged its votaries to develop the affirmative side of their position to the utmost, an immense amount of good might have been done. Instead of this, Secularists have been constantly taunted with the Atheism which their doctrine partially implied, and have been forced back to defend that. But although the development of many has been retarded in consequence, Mr. Holyoake himself has not been thus injured. Though misunderstood more extensively than ever, he has kept fast hold of the new clue he has gained to truth; his prejudices have melted away one by one,— his sympathies have become more and more comprehensive, and his aspira¬ tions increasingly loftier,—till at length, though he still believes himself to hold an Atheistic creed, he has wholly outgrown the Atheistic spirit, and a tone of Catholic, sympathetic reverence, has taken its place. And finally, he affirms that in a " relative and ethical sense." he " might claim to be con¬ sidered religious. For, if Secularism does not proceed upon the knowledge of a God Actual, it moves towards a God Possible." To hasten and confirm that movement, is the object of the following ages.</page><page sequence="33">AND MODERN ATHEISM. 27 CHATTEE II. THE ARGUMENT OF MATERIALISM' "How much speculation would be saved, how much pernicious error would beprcvcnted, if man would always keep in view that it is the order of Nature alone, whether as relating to matter or to mind, that he is capable of observing; that independently of a supernatural revelation, he can know neither the beginning nor the end oi things, but can only observe what is."—Charles Bsay. The fundamental argument of Mr. Holyoake's Atheism is thus stated in his " Paley Eefuted:"— " Design must have a designer, because whatever we know of design, we know proceeds from a designer. A designer must be a person, because whatever we know of designers has taught us that a designer is a person. All analogy is in favour of this inference. This is Paley's reasoning upon the subject, and it is too natural, too rigid, and too cogent to be escaped * from. Whoever admits the argument of design, must admit the personality of a designer. But every person is organised. No person was ever known without an organisation. The term person implies it. All analogy, all experience, are in favour of this truth. Every cerebral physiologist, and every modern metaphysician, is now aware that organisation is necessary to the generation of mind or thought. Without brain, nerves, and senses, there is no intelligence. Paley says that 'we have no authority to limit the properties of mind to any particular corporeal forms, or to any particular circumscription of space.' But we have great authority—the authority of universal and uncontradicted experience, for limiting the properties of mind to organisation. In fact, we do this not only from authority, but of neces¬ sity; for it is out of our power to disassociate organisation and intelligence. Hence the inevitable conclusion that Paley's personal, intelligent designer must be an organised being. If, then, every known organisation is redolent with contrivance, and teems with marks of design, by what analogy can we conclude that Deity's organisation is devoid of these properties? What effect ought this discovery to have upon our former inference? What? but to increase our conviction that this being also had a maker? Thus the reasoning of Paley is in a circle. It brings us back to where we set out, We still want in the end what we wanted in the beginning—a God, an original agent, a sole Supreme, a Creator, a First Cause."* * Condensed from "Paley Eefuted," chapters 8-10. See AppendixD.</page><page sequence="34">28 GEORGE JACOB HOLYOAKE Now the whole force of this argument lies in the assertion that " organi¬ sation is necessary to the generation of mind. Without brain, nerves, and senses, there is no intelligence." Undoubtedly, the sort of intelligence with which we are best acquainted is manifested to us by means of brain, nerves, and senses; but to assert, therefore, that intelligence can exist in no other form, is to assume the attribute of omniscience. As justly might a South Sea Islander, ignorant of the art of writing, maintain that intelligence could not be communicated except by speech; as well might one who had never heard of serpents, maintain that no living creature coidd walk except by legs. Has Mr. Holyoake an exhaustive knowledge of all the forms in which conscious intelligence can exist, that he is justified in asserting in what forms it cannot appear? Yet this proposition is the central idea of Materialism, from which Atheism is but one corollary among several. Let us examine this matter carefully, for it is here that the real ground of battle lies. In the first place, it may be remarked that the meaning which is attached by materialists to the word " matter," is very far from being a fixed one. Sometimes they employ it in the popular sense, as meaning that which can be touched, seen, or otherwise perceived by the senses: at other times they employ it as indicating all being; and then they argue from one meaning to the other, and say, that as matter is that which can be perceived by the senses, and as matter constitutes all being, therefore, all being can be per¬ ceived by the senses. Now this reasoning proves nothing. Precisely what we want to know is, whether that which we perceive by the senses be, or be not, all being; and this is not to be settled by assertions on either side. Employing the word "material" as indicating that which is perceivable by the senses, and the word "ideal" as indicating that which relates to Ideas, without dogmatising as to the relation borne by either to the other, let us now inquire,—What is the utmost that we know of the connection between the Material and the Ideal—between the things we can handle and the thoughts we can think? Materialists hold that we may legitimately make two statements on the subject 1. That no ideal manifestation can take place without being preceded and accompanied by material conditions. 2. That, therefore, all ideal manifestations are but transient phases of matter. The first of these statements is doubtless a fact; but the second is only an inference which I cannot see that the first warrants. We are so com¬ pletely in the dark as to how material action induces ideal manifestation— we are so unable to perceive anything more than the sequence between them, that I see not how we are justified in asserting anything more than the fact of that sequence. To go beyond this, and predicate origin, seems to be quitting experience for hypothesis, and committing in metaphysics precisely the same error which has been so often condemned in theology. 1. The seed that was recently found in an Egyptian mummy-case had shown no sign of life for some thousands of years. Yet when placed in English mould, it sprouted and bore full ears of corn. The mould was absolutely indispensable to its germination; yet who would say that the mould was the sole originating cause of that Pharaonic harvest, or that the harvest was a mere phase of the mould? Again:—a letter is written with</page><page sequence="35">AND MODERN ATHEISM. 29 jotting in the sun without the action of what we call "natural forces;' and/ sympathetic ink. The paper appears wholly blank; but when held to the fire, the inscription gradually becomes visible. Is the firo the sole originating cause of the letters? Or, because the agency of the fire is necessary to their appearance, would you say that the letters are a transient phase of fire? Here the cases are indisputable as regards sequence: by such conditions alone could the effect be produced. Yet this sequence does not prove causation. The effect resulted from the relation which that condition bore to some other condition, both of which must act simultaneously in order to become productive. Now, in our intense ignorance of the nature and origin of Ideas and Matter, how can we say that the sequence between them may not be just such a sequence as these are? And until more is known upon the subject, would it not be consistent in those who express such a strong desire to adhere alone to fact and experience, to abstain from asserting that which fact and experience have not revealed? 2. There is another consideration which favours the idea that the sequence between matter and mind is not that of absolute causation on the part of matter. It is, that although every ideal manifestation is preceded and accompanied by a material con lition, the materiality of that condition— i.e., that in it which can be perceived by the senses—is often manifestly not die agent which causes the ideal manifestation. When, for instance, a letter is perused, the distressing nnture of which throws the reader into a brain fever, it is not the effects of the black marks on the white paper that have injured the brain through the eye; the very same ocular perceptions, if unaccompanied by a knowledge of the language in which the letter may be written, would produce on the reader no effect of any moment whatever. Whence, then, the overwhelming results to the brain and the mind? Is it not from the Ideas communicated, and not from the material conditions by mtans of which the communication was made? A phrenologist might reply, that the machinery by which the communi¬ cation was made and received, resulted from the action of certain organs, and that these are merely physical agents. But it is the mere physicality of these agents which is the very point requiring to be proved—and it is precisely what the circumstances do not prove. For if the letter can act on the brain through the furce of Ideas, when to the mere eye nothing is visible but a black scrawl, why may not its antecedent, the brain, a fortiori, act through the force of Ideas, though nothing is visible there but convolu¬ tions of* brute matter?" And how can these convolutions be identified as the sole originating causes of Ideas, without resorting to hypotheses which cannot be shown to be more than hypothetical!)' true? When we investigate our physical being with the eye and the touch, how is it possible to get beyond results that are risible and tangible? Or can we really see the sen¬ timent of love, and handle the idea of truth? Now, at this point we may take into consideration the existence of an opposite system to Materialism,—namely, Idealism: which makes in its turn the following statements:— 1. No material manifestation can take place without being preceded and accompanied by ideal conditions. •2. Therefore all material manifestations are but transient phases of spirit. Here, as before, the first statement may be pronounced a fact: the second, apitmature deduction therefrom. The* merest log of wood could not lie 4- +</page><page sequence="36">30 GEORGE JACOB HOLYOAKB when these are observed perpetually to act according to distinguishable methods, of which we take cognisance by the mind alone, such methods may be justly termed ideal. But thence to assert that Ideal Existence is the only reality, and that Matter is but its transient phenomenon, is to go be¬ yond experience into hypothesis—as the materialist does on the other hand. Now these two systems, Idealism and Materialism, seem to have equal ground in nature for their first statement, and equal absence of ground for their several inferences therefrom. It is well known that they each tend to give birth to the other; and what is curious, each system is driven to supply partially, in a spurious form, the facts it ignores on the other side: the materialist is gradually constrained to treat Matter as somewhat ideal, and the idealist learns to regard his Ideas as somewhat substantial.* Such systems are interesting as exhibiting the utmost that can be suggested on either side: but while the central notion of each is supplied by hypothesis, it is not surprising that the question has never been decided between them. Would it not be simpler to adhere to the facts on both sides, and postpone the making of inferences till they can be wholly justified?—to pursue our study of the connection between ideas and matter as far as it is possible to do so (a study so important to the healthy action of both mind and body)— and then to continue our study of each department separately, leaving it to future ages to discover, if they can, what we as yet know nothing about —the real nature of each, and their true relation to each other, f Materialism has two great corollaries. 1. If Ideas be merely transient phases of organised matter, it is evident that the universe is not, so far as we know, gifted with personal conscious¬ ness, as no organisation is known to exist which might generate such a Personal Consciousness. 2. It is also clear, that as the organisation of man dissolves at death, his personality cannot last beyond his physical life. Such being the materialistic basis upon which Atheism rests, our next business is to inquire how far Modern English Atheism, as represented by Mr. Holyoake, is in accordance therewith. * At this point the two systems virtually coincide; each deeming the universe to be composed of one substance only, and only differing as to whether it should be called "matter" or "spirit." The popular doctrine, in opposition to this, believes in two contrasted kinds of existence; and though, in our ignorance, we are not justified in asserting this doctrine as a fact, yet my own conviction is that it is the human translation of a fact. f Since this was sent to press, Mr. Holyoake has made a statement which admits nearly all that I claim in this chapter. He says (Beasoner, vol. xix., p. 81), " A philosophical materialism does not seek to forestal proof, and predict that all causes must be physical. The unknown causes of effects may be moral, or even spiritual: such issue it foresees, but it is wisely inexorable in demanding the proof before it admits the fact. It is of no consequence to progress, whether causes are physical, moral, or spiritual, provided they are calculable: with this element they are reliable, without it mystical and uncertain...In its actual sense, Materialism is the search after calculable causes—that progress may no longer be a vague, or capricious aspiration—but a serious scientific pursuit in which the steps shall be definite, measured, and reliable." _J</page><page sequence="37">AND MODERN ATHEISM. 31 CHAPTER HI. THE DOCTRINE OF ATHEISM- " Here you stand, Adore and worship when you know it not: Pious above the meaning of your thought, Devout beyond the intention of your will." Wordsworth. The Doctrine of Atheism has two classes of adherents: those who may be called Atheists by nature, and those who are only Atheists in theory. In the Atheists by nature, the faculties of Wonder, Ideality, and Veneration, are constitutionally feeble: the problem of life does not stimulate their imagination, or take hold of their feelings. Their chief anxiety on the subject is that other people should not be absurd; they value mere denial far more than discovery,—not merely because denial may be a present neces¬ sity, but because they conceive of Truth mainly as the assailant of Error, rather than as the substantive reality which Error transiently veils. They rejoice in geological discovery, because it disproves the infallibility of the Bible, but care little to track the path of free science for its own sake. They seem to think virtually that free men exist for the purpose of denying what orthodox men believe. There is no ideal of life beckoning them on to an increasingly beautiful future. Nevertheless, these men have often possessed heroic qualities, and have rendered invaluable services to the cause of Free- thought. When morally estimable, let them receive all cordial esteem: but, as thinkers, I do not here address them. No one should be blamed for deficiency in religious sensibility, any more than for deficiency in the love of music or painting; but it is impossible for such a one to form a compre¬ hensive judgment on a subject in whose elementary sensations it is consti¬ tutionally difficult to him to participate. The Atheists by theory are an altogether different class of persons. Their religious instincts are naturally quick, but they have as yet found no temple to which their understandings can unlock the gate. To this latter class Mr. Holyoake undoubtedly belongs. He has his own way of believing and worshipping—his own theories of " doctrine and discipline." My object is to show that these theories, when extended to their legitimate proportions, cease to be Atheistic. Taking in order those passages of Mr. Holyoake's writings which appear to give utterance to the instinctive workings of his mind on this subject, I commence with the following expression of the sentiment with which he regards the mysteries of the universe:—</page><page sequence="38">32 GEORGE JACOB HOLYOAKE "Deem me not blind to the magnificence of nature, or thebeauties of art, because I interpret their language differently from others. I thrill in the presence of the dawn of day, and exult in the glories of the setting sun. Whether the world wears her ebon and jewelled crown of Night, or the Day walks wonderingly forth over the face of nature, to me— ' Not the lightest leaf but trembling teems With golden visions, and romantic dreams.' It is not in a low, but in an exalted estimate of nature that my rejection of the popular theology arises...The majesty of the Universe so transcends my faculties of penetration, that I pause in awe and silence before it."* 2. Next take the instinctive workings of his understanding on the same subject:— " Upon what do I fall back then, you will ask? Upon nature! which has peopled space with glittering worlds, given to earth its capabilities, to foliage its magnificence, to flowers their tints, that fills land and sea with joyous life, and sustains man in his proud dominion over all. I fall back on nature, from which man derives so much—of which he acknowledges so little, and which, when religious, he delights to subordinate to the vague and poor chimeras of his own imagination, which he has the vanity to set over nature, as though that which is self-existent, may not be self-operating; as though powers coeval with eternity, and that conquer both time and destruction, require a parent or benefactor—or that nature, from whom we learn wis¬ dom, and order, and government, needs direction, like a straggling army, or a wayward child."f This is not merely rhetoric: for we find our Atheist, when attempting to steer by principle and system, doing it in confessed imitation of the uni¬ formity of nature's operations. 3. " As the skill of the artisan is consequent upon his observance of method in his manipulations, and the man of science achieves his triumphs by fol¬ lowing given rules, and even the elements, which work in dumb concert together, from age to age, produce their wondrous changes by uniform operation, it follows that to be in harmony with art, science, and nature, men must systematise their procedure. Therefore, though the philosophers of convenience will smile at our simplicity, we propose to guide ourselves by some principle of action, without which life degenerates into a manoeuvre, and policy into a trick!"X Neither is this implied of physical nature alone: for hear our author further:— 4. " In the infinite process of human affairs, ever developing, ever con¬ summating, where Time is builder, who shall declare what the great architect is at? who can penetrate to the great design of that superstructure, whose subject is humanity, whose corner-stone is universal happiness, whose cement is fraternity? Is it given to the stone to perceive its use—to the pillar to comprehend the outline of the temple which it supports? It is under these difficulties that they of the Present must read the portendings of the Past."§ * "Logic of Death," pp. 9, 10. f Movement, No. 21, pp. 164-5. X Beasoner, i., p. 1. § Spirit of the Age, Jan. 13,1849.</page><page sequence="39">AND MODERN ATHEISM. 33 Human life, then, would appear to be fulfilling some "great design," which transcends the faculties of individuals, who are to its mighty plan but as pillars in the outline of Nature's temple. But something distincter still is to follow. 5, " Our true course is to do the work of to-day by the light of to-day. It seems to be a law of thought that the light given to us is proportioned to our wants, and lasts our time, and that it is a law of destiny, that we must reduce to practice what we know as the only means of attaining to a higher elevation, and winning a wider view of the unexplored future."* Now I am well aware that in writing these passages, Mr. Holyoake had no intention of attributing consciousness to Nature, either directly or indirectly. But let us not be the slaves of words. What is the " logic of facts ?" If what you call Nature " has peopled space with glittering worlds," and " fills land and sea with joyous life;"—if from Nature " we learn wisdom, and order, aud government"—if it " gives us light propor- tioned to our wants," and rewards our virtue*^' a higher elevation,"—why £-fc then, Nature must be capable of purposing, willing, loving, and sustaining— *J ' and the exercise of these qualities implies consciousness:—Nature, therefore, / must be conscious with the lite of all that is—the Nature whom we know f%_ must be the God whom we seek.f Very recently, Mr. Holyoake has expressed an idea which virtually con¬ cedes this point:— "When a man asks me, 'Do I believe in God?' and I know what he means by God, I answer, and always have done, yes or no, as the case may require One man believes God to be an abstract principle distinct from Nature—such I cannot understand. Another, by God means Design— the mechanical God of Paley, which philosophy itself explodes. Others mean by Gud, Light, or Life, or Law, or Love, or Truth. I believe in Light, and Life, and Law, and Love, and Tiuth; but I think it misleading to call either ' God.' "J Yet what are Life and Love, when predicated of the Universe, but the attributes of a Pervading Consciousness? and is not such an admission as the one above quoted, a virtual surrender of the doctrine that " without brain, nerves, and senses, there is no intelligence ?"§ Can he be justly called a materialist who believes in Nature's Life? Is he an Atheist who believes in Nature's Love? It is the chief charge I have to bring against Mr. Holyoake's theological consistency, that he has left this point in an obscurity from which its im¬ portance should have saved it. I think he is bound either to add a distinct acknowledgment of Nature's consciousness || to the other attributes he has * Beasoner, vii., p. 5. f The converse of Mr. Holyoake's statement,—" The God whom we seek is the Nature that we know."—"Logic of Death," p. 10. X Beasoner. vol. xviii., p. 98. § "Paley Eefnted," p. 25. j| In the ardour of his Nature-worship, he once virtually reached this point. Probably he was scarcely aware of the full nature of his conces¬ sion; but it is worth recording, as indicating the natural tendency of his mind. " The Theist lives in the world—sees infinite marvels which nature hourly produces, and yet he gives such powers no credit for their productions Plotinus used to say ' that nature was a thing which did only do, but did not</page><page sequence="40">34 GEORGE JACOB HOLYOAKE already recognised, or to give an equally distinct explanation of the sense in which he attributes life, purpose, and love to the universe, without sup¬ posing it to be aware that it lives, purposes and, loves. It may not be superfluous to add that there are Theists* who are no more able than the Atheist, to know anything of the nature of God—of the creation of the world—the origin of man, and the like. But seeing throughout nature and life the perpetual traces of Power and Purpose, such a Theist cannot but own them to be manifestations of a Pervading Con¬ sciousness. Observe, he does not theorise upon absolute causes; it is only manifestations that he feels justified in trusting. But because he is not able to comprehend the conditions of this great Consciousness, he does not con¬ sider himself disqualified to apprehend its existence; the more so, as he feels precisely the same inability to comprehend the conditions of every other consciousness, from the lowest zoophyte up to Shakspere or Emerson. The inability to account for a mystery is an excellent reason for not giving cre¬ dence to mysteries of whose actual existence we have no proof; but it should not prevent us from acknowledging the reality of that which can be proved to exist, unless we can first explain its genesis and rationale. How could any science progress, if inquirers did not hold themselves free to admit new facts before they were competent to explain them? One important branch of this subject calls for special notice. Mr. Holy¬ oake tells us that " Science is the providence of life; spiritual dependence may lead to material destruction."! And he elsewhere adds, " I mean by spiritual dependency, application to heaven by prayer, expecting that help will come to us." " It has long seemed to me the most serious libel on the character of Deity, to assume for one moment that he interferes in human exigencies. A mountain of desolating facts rises up to shame into silence the hazardous supposition Nor do I see how any one, in the face of such facts, can hold that there is a special providence, without proclaiming it to be of limited power or of limited humanity, or owning that the Divine administra¬ tion of this world is conducted on principles inapplicable and inexplicable to humanity, and is at once beyond our criticism, and therefore incapable of affording us instruction.''^ All this is undeniably true as far as it goes; but there is another class of truths to be taken into consideration. Mankind have hitherto shown so little appreciation of God's modes of action, that it is scarcely surprising that the majority of human experience should be in contradiction with the popular theory of prayer. A person may pour out his ardent desire that such a blessing should happen to him, or such a calamity be averted; but he has no right to expect that God should alter His nature to gratify human know;' but Plotinus, like many of his followers, forgot to inform us how he came to know th at; if nature had made him its especial confidant, he might have apprised us of the fact. Those who know most of nature believe most in its powers. Science is against Plotinus." (Movement, No. 3, p. 19, January, 1843.) If Plotinus be wrong, and nature doth know, as well as do,—what becomes of Atheism? * Perhaps the best title by which to distinguish them is that of Panthe¬ istic Spiritualists. Cowper Street Discussion, p. viii. X Cowper Street Discussion, pp. 62, 66, 67.</page><page sequence="41">AND MODERN ATHEISM. 35 wishes. Such a breathing-forth may however, if uttered in an uncomplain¬ ing spirit, have the beneficent effect of sympathy on his mind, and is not therefore to be despised. But true prayer is the putting oneself in harmony with God, and working with Him. Do you desire a physical good? you must then, offer a physical prayer. Put your own shoulder to the wheel, and co-operate with the divine energy that resides in matter; it will oome half-way to meet you, if invoked in its own language. Do you desire a good for humanity Study the laws and conditions of human nature, and act accordingly. Those powers with which it is endowed will act for you and with you, whether the individuals know it or not. And, finally, if you desire a spiritual good within you, which no outward action can procure— if your spirit shrinks from its duty, and reason and conscience speak to it in vain, and although the heart is willing, the energy is faint—then, with whatever of good is left in you, fly to the Inspirer of all Good, the Pure Heart of the Universe, and He will come forth to commune with you—His love shall overflow your soul, and in His strength shall you be strong. Mr. Newman truly says that the abundant evidence of the multitudes of persons whose earnest prayers have been thus answered, is the only proof that can be required of the reality of such communion.* Yet it has been very greatly overlooked in the modern discussions on this subject. Chris¬ tians have attributed to spiritual prayer a physical efficacy, and Atheists, seeing this to be a mistake, have concluded that prayer had no efficacy of any kind. But with clearer perceptions of God's various modes of action, we gain clearer views of our various modes of communion with Him. And those who have experienced the rapture and the sustainment of God's moral sympathy, will not be persuaded to count it as an illusion, because it does not, of itself, achieve physical results. Whether Mr. Holyoake has any material objection to bring against these conceptions of Providence and Prayer, it rests with him to state. * "The Soul," p. 78.</page><page sequence="42">36 GEORGE JACOB HOLYOAKE CHAPTEE IV. SECULARISM; ITS METAPHYSICS AND ETHICS. " Virtue is the adherence in action to the nature of things, and the nature of things makes it prevalent."—Emerson. " By words Which speak of nothing more than what we are, Would I arouse the sensual from their sleep Of death, and win the vacant and the vain To noble raptures."—Wordswobth. Passing from the consideration of Atheism as a speculative doctrine, we will now turn to observe its effect on the primary duties of life. Bacon's often-quoted remark that '• Atheism leaves men to sense, to philosophy, to natural piety, to laws, to reputation, all which may be guides to an outward moral virtue, though religion were not," is true enough. But be it remarked, that although Atheism leaves a man to these things, it does not impel him towards them. It does not even inculcate those virtues without which the acceptance of its own unpopular creed must be a curse. The profession of Atheism requires daring and patience; but the belief in Atheism does not require the profession of it, as Christianity or Mahometanism do. A man may be an accomplished Atheist, and yet feel no obligation to be an open one. Still less will he feel, on account of his Atheism, any obligation to be honest in other things—to be a faithful husband, a generous friend, or a self-sacrificing patriot. His conduct in all these relationships will depend on far other qualities than those of logic—on his integrity, purity, and resolution of character. For good or for evil, Atheism is purely intellectual. This by no means proves it to be false: there are many intellectual truths which do not of themselves convey any moral impulse to the ordinary human mind. But the mere intellectuality of Atheism does prove that the sources of nobleness and the regulation of impulse have a differing sphere therefrom, and require study and discipline wholly unconnected with the mere rejection of a Personality above us; 'andj therefore, that some deeper knowledge of reality and some distincter creea of duty is needed than that rejection alone can supply. Of this Mr. Holyoake is now fully aware. In discipline as well as doctrine, he now combats the false only as a preparation for accepting t true. And he tells us that the merit of Atheism is that it clears the w for Pure Moralism.* It becomes necessary, therefore, to examine wha manner of thing that may be. Perhaps the completest attempt at a moral system which our author ha issued is that contained in his treatise on Eationalism. Though written long ago as 1845 (some months before the commencement of the Beasoner), it has not been invalidated by any subsequent progress made on the sam»j subject, and is, in the main, equal to Mr. Holyoake's present tone of thoughf * " Last Trial," p. 99.</page><page sequence="43">I AND MODERN ATHEISM. 37 The following is the " argument" on which the work is written, with a few of the subsequent comments and explanations:— "Rationalism, from one general fact on which it rests, furnishes three infer¬ ences addressed to individuals, three to society, and one wise admonition to all. " General Fact. '•The opinions and actions of men result from their original suscepti¬ bilities,* and the external influences which affect them. " Inferences Affecting Individuals. " 1.—The character of men resulting from their natures,! qualitiedj as their natures may be by direct training, and the general circumstances which surround them, teach that self-knowledge and self-improvement are the primary duties of each person in pursuit of intelligence and happiness. "2.—The conduct of men being necessitated, the affairs of life§ are a process—which fact all should remember, that anger may be avoided as only the poor exhibition of ignorance taken by surprise. " 3.—Mankind being influenced by external circumstances! suggests to each individual, wariness of conduct—as every erroneous step will make itself felt; and the same consideration warrants high confidence in just action as that can never be lost to the world. This fact imparts energy to charac¬ ter, and makes a man, to a certain extent, master of fate. It teaches him that in the worst circumstances there is hope of amendment or chance of dignity—if he has but wisdom to guide and courage to act. It removes doubt from human endeavour, and reduces progression to a science. Inferences affecting Society. " 4.—Character and conduct being influenced by external circumstances —including those which precede birth, as well as those which operate after¬ wards—it is the first duty of society to see that these are pure that men may be perfect. * "'The term ' susceptibilities' is more intelligible than organisation, but it is employed to signify what was intended by organisation. Mr. Murphy, in his remarkable Essay towards a Science of Consciousness, has a clear distinction of things generally, into two classes—powers and susceptibilities. This distinction, observed with respect to organised life and the circum¬ stances which surround it, dispels many clouds of metaphysics. All we know of human nature in reference to morality, is included in the respective qualities of susceptibility and circumstances. A practical knowledge of humanity is a knowledge of the relations these two bear to each other. Susceptibility is used in the seuse of peculiar liability of impression. "'Natures' is here employed in the same sense as 'susceptibilities' in the General Fact. X " This is a coinage, as I could find no word fully expressive of what takes place. Each step in the process of character changes the quality of the being—perhaps elevating, perhaps deteriorating. It is not the change so much as the quality of the change which concerns us, and which has to be expressed. § " The phrase " affairs of life' is not employed in its wide sense, but is to be taken as signifying the personal proceedings of men. 1! **It is not intended here to tacitly deny the influence which the 'sus¬ ceptibilities'spoken of in a preceding fact "exercise. This fact is confined to the consideration of the influence of 'external circumstances' alone. The same is to be understood of the next fact.</page><page sequence="44">38 GEORGE JACOB HOLYOAKE " 5.—All moral action being generated by constitution and condition, all crime must result from bad propensity, ignorance, or privation, therefore society will rather protect itself against, than revenge itself of crime. " 6.—Opinion being dependent on natural capacity and acquired know¬ ledge—it follows that erroneous opinion is a misfortune only, to be remedied by superior education. "General Inference. " It following from the foregoing facts that the perfection of man depends on the perfection of his organisation and the favourable influences operating on him—persons convinced of this truth will make man, society, and nature generally, especial objects of study—the better to bring all these relations ot humanity into harmony with happiness and progression." " Will the reader be at the trouble of noticing, that when it is said that, ' the opinions and actions of men result from their susceptibilities, and the external influences which affect them'—that the word affect is italicised. Cognizance of the meaning here intended will save many misunderstand¬ ings. When a man owns himself to be influenced by circumstances, it is currently inferred that he confesses himself a metaphysical weathercock— that if he believe in Priestley to-day, he may in Mahomet to-morrow— indeed, if wedded only to-night, that he may fall in love afresh in the morn¬ ing. These are improbable expectations. It does not follow that because a man is sure to be influenced by some circumstances that he will be influenced by every circumstance. It is worth while to notice that many circumstances surround or operate upon us without deciding us—those only assist in forming character which affect us... External circumstances maybe powerful or weak—may act too long, and produce a morbid result, or too short and produce no result at all. But the wisdom we gather is, that we have to master and modify as far as possible, these external influences, and proportion them to the susceptibility to be affected. We learn that human nature is a soil to be cultured, and that the harvest depends upon our atten¬ tion and skill."* What is the moral of all this? Why, that "circumstances" are an ad¬ mirable raw material for the plastic energy of courage and virtue. "It is an important distinction to make (adds our materialist), that man is not the slave, but the subject of circumstances. Though by nature he renders alle¬ giance to them, yet he may be said to choose which he will serve The fatalist submits to necessity, the philosophical necessarian moulds it. Every man has means, which, like soldiers, wait his command. The fatalist leaves his troops to disband, and supinely relinquishes every chance of victory. The wiser necessarian marshals his forces, challenges fate, and pursues con¬ quest with all his powers."! The relation which this novel form of Necessarianism bears to the doctrine of Free Will is thus stated by Mr. Holyoake:—"By free will it is meant that of any given number of objects presented to a man's notice he can choose which he likes. To this Eationalism, says yes—only understand that what a man likes depends upon his natural and acquired taste, and on the strength of the evidence before him. This simple, yet striking and sound distinction is analogous to that which is to be observed between the popular belief of Mr. Owen's meaning, and that capable of being inferred from his * Eationahsm, pp. 8, 10,12,13. Eationalism, pp. 17, 20.</page><page sequence="45">AND MODERN ATHEISM. 39 fundamental facts. When he tells us that 'man is compelled by his origi¬ nal constitution to receive his feelings and convictions independently of his will'—the meaning, I take it, is not that man is the passive recipient of all feelings and all convictions, but that such as he does receive, he receives in the way stated."* Probably few believers in Free Will would object to this doctrine. But it is certain that several Necessarians do strongly object to it. Many have been the protestations made against it by members of Mr. Holyoake's own party. They have no notion of " choosing which circumstances they will serve," and as to "challenging fate," and "moulding destiny," that is not dreamt of in their philosophy.! This is another illustration of the propo¬ sition I am endeavouring to prove, that Mr. Holyoake has passed far beyond the sectarian sense in which his nominal creed can be understood, and that he virtually holds the spiritual truth on the other side. All I ask is, that he should do "this distinctly. If he consider the term Free Will to be irrevo¬ cably joined to the absolute and unlimited freedom of the will, let him findsomeother term which shall indicate the agent of conscience, the faculty by which we "mould destiny" and "discipline susceptibility;" but let him not retain the appellation of Necessarian while holding that doctrine in so very modified a form. Let him bear in mind the words he applies to Mr. Owen on this subject:— "When Mr. Owen said the character of man resulted from the action of circumstances and the reaction of organisation, he virtually expressed the part a man may be said to play in the formation of his own character, but on such a question the sense requires to be more than virtually expressed, it must be ob\ ious, unmistakably obvious, or only a partial perception will be attained where we least expect it."J So much for the metaphysical part of Mr. Holyoake's ethics. Now let us examine his practical application of it. As might be expected, there is much less of Necessity in it than of Free Will. * Eationalism, pp. 19, 20. "The secularist leader despises a theory which condemns a man ti eternal torments on account of his misbelief, while tacitly accepting a theory which implies the punishment of man in eternity for his misconduct in time. Strange that any one should be a necessitarian, and fail to perceive that con¬ duct is as much necessitated as belief! Strange that he should declare 'faith is not in itself a virtue,' and immediately after say 'therefore it would be much more useful to have made salvation depend on works which are more or less at the command of all men!'" "The Secularist leader having committed himself (so far as words went) to the fallacious hypothesis that for our actions though not for our opinions, we can justly be amenable to 'Divine judgment,'had no firm place on which to plant his foot," &amp;c.—Charles Southwell's " Super-naturalism Exploded," pp. 13, 14, 15. See also a letter in the Beasoner, signed " Cleon" (voL xi. p. 119), containing these remarks:— "In 263 of the Beasoner, Mr. Holyoake reports himself to have replied, in answer to a question, that' Conscience is a man's sense of duty, and it im¬ plies responsibility to himself and his fellows.' This statement, coming from a disciple of Mr. Owen, is extraordinary, and seems to imply a denial of one of the most essential principles of Socialism." X Rationalism, p. 17.</page><page sequence="46">40 GEORGE JACOB HOLYOAKE " We learn from the late census, that four millions of the people in Great Britain alone stand outside the pale of the church, declining membership and communion. This large number is composed of two main classes, the indifferent and the conscientious. The indifferent, generally, care as little for virtue as for religion. The conscientious are those who intelligently and seriously consider the fight of nature clearer than the light of the Bible or the Church. The practical question with us is,—How can the conscientious be organised in idea and action, so as to attain position themselves, and con¬ quer the indifferent and restore them to usefulness? This is no work of supererogation Preachers, indeed, denounce, but they do not arrest, the current of crime. It may be that we shall not succeed better, but there is room for us to try.''* " The earliest consideration with one who attempts the influence of others is man's duty to his own conscience, which is the beginning of self-training. And towards such training, what help does Secularism offer? "In the first place, Secularism is not Stoicism. It neither proposes ignor¬ ing the passions, nor does it undertake the impossible task of extirpating them. But it would chasten and direct them Involved in a struggle for life and liberty, Secularists have hitherto had few opportunities of dwell¬ ing upon that discipline of the affections which they would seek to cherish. Whatever pertains to purity and elevation of character, we value as deeply as the theist. Even the sense of sin has with us its defined place. Excess is sin, and therefore all deviation from moral or physical temperance, is an offence. All omissions of duty, or of love, are offences—which, if they do not (to us) involve remorse before God, involve contrition before conscience —that contrition which is expressed by all possible reparation, stricter watchfulness, and contingent amendment. " We do not, therefore, say to the young, without qualification, Considt your aptitude, follow your bias. We do not assume human nature as being altogether a guide in that full sense; for in this half-nurtured, half-trained, doubtfully-cunditioned state of society, if that language were used, the generous might, indeed, be incited to noble deeds, but the sordid might lay their vulture claws on their neighbours, and the immoral and unprincipled might victimise their fellows. But what we do say is, Follow your honest impulse in those directions which include the welfare of your fellow-men as well as your own, in matters of example and influence." Then follows a division of mankind into three classes, and the motives by which our author deems each to be capable of being influenced for good. " There are certainly many persons who hardly ever sin. Many men, and more women, have a passion for goodness, and to do evil is a violence to their nature. With this order of persons there is a natural guarantee of morality. The child honours his father and mother, and the parent guards the purity and footsteps of the child; the wife cherishes her honour, and the husband respects his pledge; the friend is faithful to his word, and the citizen is true to the state—because love and duty, self-respect and good faith, have intrinsic charms and influences over these individuals. " But there is another order of persons besides those whose well-balanced feelings thus incline them to virtue. There is an order less happily consti¬ tuted, whom error misdirects and, conventional interest perverts. These are to be governed by knowledge. With them the appeal should be to * Glasgow Discussion, p. 13.</page><page sequence="47">I AND MODERN ATHEISM. 41 their intelligence; they require to be put under the dominion of ideas The man of nature undergoes a new birth when he is admitted into the kingdom of thought And when morality is studied as a science, and all its dependencies and advantages made familiar to the common understand¬ ing, we shall find that virtue, which is now a grave and scarce pre¬ tension, will become a genial and a general pursuit But allow¬ ing that some men and women are good by nature, and that it is possible, by the culture of the moral sense, to control others usefully, what is to be done with those who are both violent and dull, whose nature impels them to excess, and whose capacity will never expand so as to cor¬ rect it? In these instances our appeal is to utility, to the sense of interest —an appeal which the rudest are prompt to own, and which even a philoso¬ pher cannot wholly afford to disregard. If any one will not pursue right conduct for its own sake, it is still worth his while to do it for his interest's sake; if any one will not live uprightly because of its intellectual beauty and moral "harmony, we say it is worth his while pursuing it as a matter of calculation. We will show him that no other course will answer Do Christians tell us that vice is successful, and that virtue docs not answer in this world? We say, virtue ought to answer, and as far as in our power lies it shall answer, and we believe it can be made to answer. For the in¬ fluence of right doing is in the very constitution of things conserved. No fate can rob us of dignity without our own consent; in the narrowest cir¬ cumstances there is hope if there be effort; and chances of happiness are within our grasp, where there is wisdom to guide and courage to act. Gradually it dawns upon us, that in no obscurity are we hidden, in no re¬ moteness are we lost—that, unseen or unknown, no thought, or word, or act, is effectless—that our doings ever tell for society's advancement or our own deterioration. This aspect of things is full of strength and nobility. It is virtue founded, not on fear, but on intelligence—assuring us that well in some shape ever waits on well, and sending the salutary conviction of Macbeth stealing over us, that * Even-handed justice Commends the ingredients of our poisoned chalice To our own lips.' "* What, then, is the climax of our author's ethical faith? Why, this—that Nature is just, " for the influence of right doing is in the very nature of things conserved." Do you call this Atheism? Many and many a Theist has not half this faith in " the Infinite Ideality."! I have no wish to strain Mr. Holyoake's words to mean more than he intended by them; but surely when such sublime co-operation with individual virtue is added to the other attributes predicated of Nature—the qualities which imply consciousness are more than ever indicated. JFor if the Life of the Universe"be moral, surely it can only be conceived of as personal; the " Infinite Ideality," who " gives us light proportioned to our wants," and whom a wise seeking will always find, for " in no obscurity are we hidden, in no remoteness are we lost"— " well in some shape ever waits on well." * " Secularism, the Affirmative Philosophy of the People."

Yet if a man really love Truth as Truth, better than his own current theory of it, the day will inevitably come whefa he will perceive that his own com¬ panions, even though they believe in "the truth," and belong to "the cause" (whatever that cause may happen to be), do not come up to the perfection which that sacred Idea seems to demand of them, but manifest all the weak¬ nesses, and even some of the crimes, of frail humanity. Should he become acquainted with some of the advocates of "the other side," it is also possi¬ ble that he may discover that these men have as earnest an aspiration after truth as his own party, and make as many sacrifices to realise it. If he be incapable of analysing this phenomenon, he will at this juncture, probably, become indifferent to the exact culture of Truth. But if he be wise and stedfast, he will see that rival systems do not stand to each other in the relation of absolute truth and absolute falsehood, but as different conceptions of trutfi: and that while a man is not capable of transcending the ideal of his creed, that ideal is to him, good. There is beauty in the Eoman Catholic visions of Bedemption and Paradise—let those whose hearts have thrilled over Haydn's Passione bear witness! These was sublimity in the stern worship of the hunted Covenanters: there is a grand pathos in the Chris¬ tianity of "Alton Locke," and a heavenly aspiration in the Anglican "Heir of Eedclyffe." We cannot doubt that these different forms of piety have hallowed the lives of thousands; and with warm human sympathy we reve¬ rence all who work out their faith from a conscience-guided soul. But the question for the truth-seeker to ask, is—from what point are the leading principles of a faith conceived? Does it endeavour to do equal justice to</page><page sequence="49">AND MODERN ATHEISM. 43 the whole circle of our capabilities? or does it lay an undue stress on parts of them only? In this respect, it is of serious importance, even to the com¬ paratively unspeculative, what faith they live by. For there is no part of our nature which can be long violated with impunity. Yet this has been done in two opposite directions, with results which require to be studied at some length! The first parts of human nature which force themselves into notice are the passions, and the earliest forms they assumed were but little elevated above the nature of merely animal instincts. The earliest religions always sanctioned every crude gratification of passion, as the mythological and historical records of all nations abundantly show. But as humanity gradually unfolded, and the affections, aspirations, and idealities emerged into the sunlight—the ideas of purity and discipline were gradually infused into thecodeof Eeligious Authority. And in that religion which chiefly concerns the civilised world,* the Family, the Kingdom, and the Church have been sanctioned as the legitimate forms of human development. The husband is to be lord of the wife,—the father, lord of the child,—the king, lord over the parent,—and the priest, lord over alL Now this hierarchical system of life does immense injustice to some of the most important faculties of our nature. It places irresponsible power in the hands of the strongest, and utterly neglects the right of the soul, whether in the woman, the citizen, or the thinker, to an equal standing with mere physical force. All develop¬ ments of thought and life are banned which do not accord with the will of the individuals who are supposed to have received a " divine right" to act and rule. Increasing intelligence and refinement have greatly elevated the tone of orthodoxy during the last century; and several of its objectionable features have been considerably modified, even by those who believe them¬ selves to be faithful and orthodox Christians. But as the sacred books which form the basis of Christianity were written by men who lived when this law of the strongest was deemed to be holy and virtuous, all creeds de¬ rived from those scriptures are more or less tinctured with it The innocent wife must be ever bound to the brutal husband, because Christ forbade Jewish husbands to abuse their power of summary divorce;! the slave must not escape from his master, because Paul sent back the fugitive Onesimns; the citizen must not rebel against a despot, because Paul said that "every soul should submit to the higher powers;" the geologist must not acknowledge the antiquity of the pre-human earth, for Moses said it only lasted during six days; the Palace of Art must not be opened on Sunday, because Moses affirms that God rested on Saturday; the thinker must not criticise the Bible, because John cursed all who should alter the words of the Apocalypse; the worshipper must not seek God without a Mediator, for Christ said " no man cometh unto the Father, but by me,"}: and John adds that "he that believeth not the Son shall not see fife; but the wrath of God abideth on him."§ * I am not speaking here of Christianity as it existed in the mind of Jesus, but as it has been known throughout Christendom since its establish¬ ment as an ecclesiastical institution. The idea of a court of law before whom conjugal questions could be impartially tried, was unknown in that day. X John xiv. 6. § John iii. 36.</page><page sequence="50">44 GEORGE JACOB HOLYOAKE Now this theory of life, while it endeavours to keep down all growth in Morals, Science, and Eeligion, to the point sanctioned by orthodoxy, has the inevitable effect of inspiring in the minds of the energetic and free an intense reaction;—and the principle of Free Thought becomes the centre of an opposite mental and social development. It is not surprising that its first movements should be those of aggression,—nor that, seeing how much of human nature has been cramped by Orthodoxy, Freethinkers should adopt " human nature " as their basis. Yet they have hitherto been as im¬ perfect in their rendering of it as the orthodox. They have almost ex¬ clusively cultivated those activities alone which Orthodoxy condemns,— viz., theological criticism and political resistance. Now, these are often indispensable as the guardians of life, but they do not constitute life itself. The primary instincts which lie beneath, the love of our fellow beings, of nature, of truth, of God,—these are the substantive realities for the sake of which the critical faculty is valuable; and it is a serious mistake to cultivate one side of our nature at the expense of the other. Not only so, but each side requires to be fed by the impulses of the other, or it soon loses balance and health;—rhe reverence which wants self-respect becomes senile, and the independence which wants sweetness becomes unjust. And when the discipline of the affections and the culture of the aspirations have bnt little place in the thoughts, it is inevitable that they should find still less place in the life, and thus, without deviation from conscious rectitude, one side of many an earnest nature is likely to be numbed and repressed. Still more is the deficiency visible when children are born into the dwelling, and their training in temper, truth and virtue, has to be cared for. All this cannot come by accident or gravitation. A man may be a sensible critic and a useful politician, and yet have no idea how to fulfil his part in home duty. For the discharge of this, positive and discriminate training of the passions, affections, and aspirations, is indispensable. If this be not given in time, the energetic are apt to become hard, the imaginative grow unpractical, and the passionate grow selfish. No one who has mixed with Freethinkers but must have witnessed this repeatedly, and that, too, among many who are by no means wanting either in generosity or intelligence. But the influence they do want, is a Moral Culture that shall stimulate them to obey their noblest impulses, and repress their meaner ones on principle;—and for such a culture, Freethought has hitherto made no adequate provision. But Mr. Holyoake has endeavoured to initiate such a culture for his co- believers; and with what result? Why, that " the influence of right doing is in the very nature of things conserved;" that "the Infinite Ideality" " gives us light proportioned to our v. ants," and rewards our use of it by " a higher elevation:"—that "they who toil and make efforts for the improve¬ ment of others, who resist evil, who endure wrong, and who fill their even¬ ings with services, and their thoughts with undying love—these men are above creeds and confessions, their life is a worship, every day is a piety, every hour a preparation:" * that " in all pure Moralism there is the con¬ tingency of God,"—and that philosophy does not forbid us to " believe in Light and Life, and Law and Love." Thus the disinterested love of Good¬ ness has led him to the perception that Goodness is the underlying reality of the Universe. Now the distinct recognition of the Consciousness of this * Glasgow Discussion, p. 208.</page><page sequence="51">AND MODERN ATHEISM. 45 Pervading Goodness seems to me the last crowning element of its perfect effectiveness—and hence the moral importance of such a recognition. Hew ho believes that the Divine lives and loves, has a new door opened to all that is holy and beautiful. Duty becomes irradiated by Love; no temptation is bevond the influence of a Divine encouragement, no sorrow without the consolation of a Divine tenderness. Fresh joys ever increase our gratitude, and fresh trials do but rouse our nobler qualities into action under the thrilling reliance that He who gave us a conscience will strengthen it to conquer, and render us the purer for the struggle.—Nor is religious faith without its beneficial effects in the purely intellectual world. It is an ele¬ vating consideration, in studying the records of Science, to look upon all the indications which it traces in Nature, of " wisdom, order, and govern¬ ment,"'—all its marks of "exquisite complexity," or "transcendent majesty," as the sublime thoughts of a Pervading Consciousness. Such considera¬ tions seem to make us more at home in this wondrous Universe,—more ble*t within, and more strong to bless without. If, therefore, they be con¬ sonant with truth, it is highly important that their truth should be recog¬ nised. And should Mr. Holyoake recognise it, it is probable that his The¬ ism would be eminently devout and practical. With whom would Beligion be a more vivid and permanent mdity than with one in whom its founda¬ tions have been gradually built up, year by year, amid the most destructive influences—who, thrown early on the moral sentiment for his only guide amid the buffettings of life, has followed that clue until it has led him on to the very gates of the sanctuary? These are the votaries we want; men who do not " believe in God as the authority and respectability of the world combined," * but as the Living Soul of Goodness; men who, while keeping fast hold on Freedom, do so for the sake of that wide possession of Truth which Freedom alone can ensure; men who, amid all the frailties of hu¬ manity, still do their best to honour the principles at home which they preach abroad. The woik which needs doing for mankind surges around us in every direction. It can only be thoroughly achieved by the labours of the free. May not those free be inspired by the thrilling encouragements of a pure and rational faith, which feels God within, sees him around, and hopes to do both more completely beyond the grave? My object, in this Essay, has "been to put this question to the best of my abilitv. It remains with others to answer it. * " It seems to me that the god that is commonly worshipped in civilised countries is not at all divine, but is the overwhelming authority and respec¬ tability of the world combined.

It is this tendency to value every thing according to its moral suggestive- ness, that has made Mr. Holyoake's influence, in spite of many errors, one of great usefulness on the whole. Perhaps this is worth illustrating by the following passages gleaned from his writings:— L "Principles which do not improve us as individuals are held in vain."—Bationalism, p. 21. II. "We place personal reforms first They precede all others. Of what value are public changes if they involve not, in fact compel, thebetter- ance of private manners? Or what imports theological reform, if it is to end in protests merely against Priests, and the severance of the Church from the State? The freedom of private judgment amounts to nothing if it leads not to the purity of private conduct If we put away dogmas, it is to deify duty...But as acts of parliament cannot make people wise or virtuous, their operations must be to afford better conditions for individual endeavours after excellence and honour."—Beasoner, vii, 113.

"Domestic life is very far from what it might be under the present system. That those who see so much of what is desirable should not accom¬ plish individually what is possible, is very sad.

"The very order in which the words Liberty, Equality and Fraternity stand, indicates the peremptory period in which they were framed. Conces- cession is exacted before Fraternity is offered.

As civilisation is approached, law is in¬ vented to check excess and restrain impulse at the point of temperance, which means practically at the point of safety to others. When reason teaches men to do this 6f their own accord, they are said to be a law unto themselves. Law is evidently, then, the necessary attendant on partial and transitory civilisation, and hence obedience is yielded to it by every intelli¬ gent man—not the obedience exacted by the arm of absolute power, but that more genial obedience of reason and conviction."—Ion Letters, Spirit of the Age, No. 20. • V. " The aspiration after Equality is the noble instinct of the populace of these times. It ought to be fostered, not scorned....It seeks to raise the low to the level of the high, and it invites the aid of the high in the gracious task. Its advocates seek not to establish Equality, but to attain to it. They regard it as an approximation to social and political justice. Equality envies no rich: it would make all rich. It molests not the high: its mission is to elevate the low. It reverences inferior natures, and it passes by the pride of power to study the lowliness of those whom nature and men have forgotten, not to force imbecility into prominence, but by wise education and social privilege to minister to incapacity till it takes its place by the side of Genius and Virtue."—Ion Letters, Spirit of the Age, No. 21.

To aspire to control large interests and national honour, implies some large sense of human and commercial rela¬ tions, some high private cultivation, how else can such duties be discharged? To claim to regulate the relations of your neighbour in the state (which the exercise of the franchise implies), should signify some individual com¬ prehension of what those relations ought to be, and some power of impar¬ tiality and fraternity. If the sovereign people are to take the place of the sovereign king, they must be greater and grander than royalty in their notions. The imperial people must be animated with the catholicity which embraces and conserves all honourable interests, and the magnanimity which looks with an equal eye on all parties. But if those qualities are to come out of the people, they must dwell in them individually. The democrat, in aspiring to democratic power, enters upon the study of democratic virtues, and should rise above those who are incapable of political inspiration. We expect therefore, not to find the democratic politician coveting to be known as the unwashed, unshorn, and ill-dressed; we expect to find him a gentle¬ man, not in the sense of the observance of a hollow and frivolous etiquette, but in the purity of high purpose and the simplicity and gentleness of noble manners."—Organisation of Ideas, pp. 5, 6.

In the winter of 1S53, a circular of the London Secular Society was sent me by the Secretary, with an invitation to join the body. I declined, alleging that Secularism, as represented in the circular, implied the rejec¬ tion of religious faith. This was questioned in the Beasoner soon after¬ wards (vol xvi., p. 13) by a correspondent signing W. H. N, and Mr. Holy¬ oake subsequently told me in conversation, that my ground for declining Secular membership was not tenable. And he has repeatedly asserted in public that the acceptance of Secularism was possible to Theists and Atheists alike. It may, therefore, perhaps, be not superfluous to indicate the points in which Secularism does contradict religion. The form into wliich I have thrown my elucidation is, perhaps, an egotistical one, but it would be still more presumptuous to pretend to answer for the details of any one's faith besides my own. Principles of the London Secular Society. 1. That the secidar sphere is the province of man, and claims his especial attention. Confession of Faith by a Pantheistic Spiritualist. 1. That the secular and the spiri¬ tual are so indissolubly interwoven in the life of man, that secular affairs must ever claim his careful attention, not only on account of their own in¬ trinsic importance, but as the indis¬ pensable conditions of a healthy spiritual development.</page><page sequence="57">APPENDIX. 51 2. That Science is the providence of life. That to observe and trust the natural laws which are found to regulate our being is the highest wisdom and obvious duty of man; whilst to place dependence on super¬ natural or external spiritual influ¬ ences, is to stand on uncertainty, and may lead to incalculable disaster. 3. That the order and method, rather than the cause or origin, of nature are the proper subjects for human study. Human nature being improvable under well-understood material conditions, a complete system of secular education is of the utmost importance. The order of mind is as uniform and calculable as the order of the material universe; and he who masters the process of human affairs may come to control results. 4. That the present life demands our first care. The conditions of a future life being unknown, and, at most, conjectural, we should attempt the improvement of human condition in this. 2. That Science is man's key to an increasingly large portion of God's Providence, which extends our em¬ pire over nature, and inspires us, by its revelations of order and beauty, with a trust in the Moral Purpose that pervades the Universe, to which Ignorance, however pious and well-meaning, can never attain. Granted. Granted.—Human nature being improvable under certain conditions, a complete system of education, phy¬ sical, moral, mental, and spiritual, is of the utmost importance. The order of mind is probably as uniform as the order of the material universe; but though it can only be wholly calculable to the mind of Omniscience, man may reasonably hope to learn increasingly the power of tracing its laws; and in proportion to his becoming able to master the process of human affairs, will he be able to control residts. Granted. — The conditions of a future life are indeed unknown, and wholly conjectural; but its reality under some form or other seems so demanded by man's capabilities for progressive improvement and abid¬ ing affection, that the almost uni¬ versal instinct which has, in all ages, assumed immortality as a fact, is not to be lightly dismissed because it has no future-world evidence to produce. And while we would wait serenely till Death shall lift the curtain of the Future, the hope that that Future will enable us to continue and deve-</page><page sequence="58">52 lop all that is worthiest here into ever fuller life, is a most animating stimulus to all human improvement because it offers to that improve¬ ment an unending career. With the remaining paragraphs, I cordially agree. NOTE D., page 27. THE ARGUMENT FROM DESIGN. It is necessary here to remark that Paley's way of stating the Argument from Design introduces into that argument an element which does not belong to it in general estimation. He says* that " the undeviating course of our experience" forces us to conclude that design had a designer, and that that designer is a person. He fails to see that the very word " design" is only another name for conscious meiital action; the two forms of speech are but different ways of expressing the same idea. But when Paley brings in our undeviating experience to prove what requires no proof, viz., that thought implies a thinker, he justifies the Atheist in adding that our unde¬ viating experience also requires that the thinker should have brains. Now this fallacy of Paley's should not be charged upon Theists in general. Certainly it makes no part of the instinctive popular belief: neither is it universally accepted by thinkers. Professor Bushnell distinctly repudiates it;! an(i Professor Newman has presented, in "The Soul," an argument infinitely superior to it. But the general popular mind is not sufficiently critical to perceive the blunder,—and continues to accord to Paley a high place among the defenders of Theism. Moreover, though it is plain that Mr. Holyoake's argument against Paley is wholly built on this point, yet in * " Wherever we see marks of contrivance, we are led for its cause to an intelligent author. And this transition of the understanding is founded upon uniform experience. We see intelligence constantly contriving, that is, we see intelligence constantly producing effects, marked and distin¬ guished by certain properties; not certain particular properties, but by a kind and class of properties, such as relation to an end, relation of parts to one another, and to a common purpose. We see, wherever we are witnesses to the actual formation of things, nothing except intelligence producing effects so marked and distinguished. Furnished with this experience, we view the productions of nature. We observe them also marked and distin¬ guished in the same manner. We wish to account for their origin. Our experience suggests a cause perfectly adequate to this account. No experi¬ ence, no single instance or example, can be offered in favour of any other. In this cause, therefore, we ought to rest; in this cause the common sense of mankind has, in fact, rested, because it agrees with that which, in all cases, is the foundation of knowledge,—the undeviating course of their experience."—Paley's Natural Theology, chap. 23. Bushnell's " God in Christ," p. 55.</page><page sequence="59">APPENDIX. 53 no answer to Mr. Holj'oake or his friends that I have seen, has it been per¬ ceived that this " experience " clause of Paley's is the Achilles' heel of his great work, through which the Atheist shaft can and does penetrate. Con¬ sequently, as the real Atheistic difficulty has never been perceived, it has never been removed. When it is also remembered that an anthropomorphic conception of God pervades nearly the whole Bible, and that popular Christianity attributes to the Deity a local habitation and a visible throne, it will be seen that the Atheist becomes still more confirmed in the notion that a belief in a Divine Personality implies anthropomorphism; and from this he naturally revolts. On the other hand, pious, uncritical persons are honestly perplexed and grieved at what appears to them the inconceivable blindness that will not see the mind of a Deity in the beautiful wisdom of the universe,—and they fly to the supposition that such blindness can only result from a wilful hardness or even depravity of heart. It is difficult to say which party most widely misapprehends the other: the only point in which the Free¬ thinker's error is the least hurtful of the two is, that as he allows an appeal to nature and reason, he leaves open a common ground on which all natural believers may reason freely with him. It should be his pride to extend that common ground till it includes the whole of the truth on both sides. NOTE E., Page 41. Wiiile these sheets were going through the press, I met with the following passages, which singularly illustrate the position I here take. " Innumerable volumes have been written upon the nature of a religious or saving faith; yet, perhaps, all they contain of essential truth might be condensed into a declaration that faith is practical confidence on good, as being intimately in harmony with the laws of human life To rest, maugre much individual discouragement, calmly confident in the inherent vitality and supremacy of good, as evinced by our faculties of conscientious benevolence harmonising with the eternal order of the universe, seems really a manifestation of that faith by which, and by which alone, earnest intelligence may be saved from chaotic Atheism."* Thus the very argument which forms the climax of Mr. Holyoake's Se¬ cularism, is brought forward by a Christian writer as " that faith by which alone, earnest intelligence may be saved from chaotic Atheism!" Mr. Wilson is right: it has produced that effect on Mr. Holyoake. All I ask is, that he should perceive that it has done so. * Note to Deut. xxx. 15, in the Eev.
