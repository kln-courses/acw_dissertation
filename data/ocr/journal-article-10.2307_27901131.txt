<plain_text><page sequence="1">EVOLUTION OF RELATIVITY ALTHOUGH I am not writing in Tennessee, I should explain my heterodox subject. While I believe that all becoming, all change, is a real evolution in the relativity of things, here I mean by evolution merely an orthodox process of unnatural selection by which human understand ing has arrived at its present concept or attitude of rela tivity. I mean by relativity?and, please, will no one sug gest to a Southern legislator that the last word of my sub ject is more devilish than the first?relativity in its most fundamental and general sense, relativity as a character istic and constituent of the real. Man's appreciation of this characteristic has been an evolution. By relativity I do not mean relativism or subjectivism, which words are vitiated by dualistic and absolutistic as sumptions. Relativity is the state or, more often, process of differentiating, of making a difference. In the absence of relativity no differentiation can exist, nothing but an infinite, continuous uniformity which is identical with non - being. I repeat, where no difference is, nothing is ; where difference is, there something is, and that something is relative. It is relative in that it owes its very existence and nature to the relations it shares with other things. If it has extension, duration, or motion, feeling, thought, or meaning, or any other characteristic, even existence, it has each and all in virtue of its relations with something else. For what is absolute being, or being with respect to itself?</page><page sequence="2">542 THE MONIST Even nothingness, from its own point of view, has being. When clearly conceived, space without differentiation, or absolute space, is simply nothing. Likewise, absolute time, substance, spirit are severally and, therefore, collectively nothing. But given differentiation or relations, then time, space, motion, and even spirit are also given. Spirit or mind is a matter of degree, manifesting itself in proportion to the complexity and internality of relations. Individua tion consists in relative differentiation of relational con figurations. Only space can differ from time, and only time from space. Time is differentiated space, and space is differen tiated time. Space-time is, from different points of view, relative motion, energy, process, perception, appreciation, thought, creativity. This is not a genetic description. Since the process of reality constitutes time, these attributes of the real have always existed, and the real has always been a complex organizing and creating of relations. Like the checkerboard, or better, because of its greater com plexity, like the game of chess, these fundamental relations must obey certain unalterable laws, but they also have an in definite range of possibility, opportunity for purpose and error, and capacity for failure or success. From the point of view of science we have discovered within this relational process a few laws of combination which are very probably, for the present at least, quite deterministic. From the point of view of certain complex portions of this process such as, for instance, finite minds, when these portions or minds function not merely analytically, but also with im mediate synthesis as in sensation, appreciation, or intui tion, we discover within reality quality, purpose, conscious ness. In brief, the logically fundamental metaphysical unit is a spacio-temporal differentiation or relation which, while continuous with other relations, has a geographical, historical, and configurative individuality. Being spacio</page><page sequence="3">EVOLUTION OF RELATIVITY 543 temporal, these relations necessarily consist of motion and, therefore, manifest energy. And relative motion which is of such sort as to constitute space-time, must be vital. I mean by this that it manifests order, consistent change, appreciation, creativity. This process has its deterministic, quantitative characteristics, and also its purposive, appreci ative capacities. From many standpoints it is material; from many others it is spiritual ; from others equally signifi cant it is neither or both. At least logic and science, intro spection and intuition, have enabled us to see from various vantage points this infinitely complex process of which we are intimate parts. To this synthetic view of the nature of reality and knowledge the evolution of the concept of rela tivity has brought us. From the metaphysical point of view the chief forms of relativity which appear in the history of the concept may be described semi-symbolically as follows : Let R mean making a difference to or in, and let a and b mean objects or terms of any sort. Then : Configurational Relativity is Rn, e. g. any complex set of relations, any object a or b, such as a crystal, tree, per sonality, quality or concept. Simple Relativity is a-R-b, e. g. sun-R-solar system. This is the form of psychological subjectivism and the theories of a non-absolute creator-god. Mutual Relativity is a-R-b and b-R-a, e. g. individual R-society and society-R-individual. Leibnitzian monad ology and socialism exemplify this type. Absolute Relativity is Rw-R-Rn, e. g. the state, such as the electro-magnetic field or the human mind, in which nothing exists but relations and relative configurations of relations. This characterizes reality as I conceive it, and also, I believe, as Professor A. N. Whitehead, perhaps less absolutely, would hold. Particularly Limited Relativity is a-R-b but not b-R-af</page><page sequence="4">544 THE MONIST e. g. seal-R-impression but not impression-R-seal. This is distinguished from Simple Relativity by its emphasis upon the asymmetrical character of the relation. It is limited because the relation is significantly internal to only one term ; and it is particular because all the relations sus tained by the other term are not external. Kant's cate gories and Plato's ideas represent this type of relativity. Universally Limited Relativity is a-R-b but not b-R-a, and for every value of x, it is false that x-R-a, e. g. where a is the Absolute upon which all else depends but which itself is independent or unaffected by anything. This type includes the Indian Brahman and the absolute of Plo tinus. Selective Relativity is a-R-some by e. g. sense of sight R-some light rays. Here Kantian epistemology and spe cific methods, such as the scientific and the mystical, are typical. These forms of Metaphysical Relativity, i. e., relativity in the nature of the real or being, have corresponding forms of Epistemological Relativiity because experience or knowledge is just as real, and just the same sort of reality, as anything else. With respect to the relations between the so-called metaphysical and epistemological realms, simple relativity may be called Mediary Relativity, a-R-b where a is some medium, such as air or light rays, between the knower and the known, and b is the resultant knowledge. Mediary relativity has the forms of Physio logical Relativity where a is part of the knower's body; Psychological Relativity where a is the nature of the mind ; Pragmatic Relativity where a is the interests, desires, tem perament of the knower; and Historical Relativity where a is tradition, education, the political and economic con ditions, and such factors of historical epochs as influence judgment or appreciation. This classification is, of course, more or less arbitrary, and itself relative.</page><page sequence="5">EVOLUTION OF RELATIVITY 545 Chronologically, the absolutistic attitude precedes the relativistic. Primitive man, who represents a stage in hu man evolution including, according to future historians, the twentieth century, seems naturally inclined to absolute explanations. Largely because of his desire to utilize the beneficent, and placate the malevolent, forces about him, man has been so eager for absolute knowledge that often he has almost deliberately deceived himself into believing he possessed it. Even the civilized man can refuse to look through the telescope for fear his faith may be shaken. Negative instances are notoriously difficult of observa tion. The Vedic sacrifice is master even of the god of thunder ; and if one tithes and sits in the pew on Sunday, one fears not death. Moreover, the definiteness and con venience of the simple, unconditioned explanation favors the absolutist tendency. Man's limited experience and his insensibility to the infinite complexity of fine distinctions led him to consider absolute the aspect of things as seen from his usual point of view. The earth is flat, for we have seen it so with our own eyes. The fundamental substance is water, or air, or spirit, or electricity. One can see that Euclidean geometry alone is valid. The earth is at rest ;? no, it moves and the stars stand still;?well, you can take your choice ! Thus, seeing things in an increasing variety of aspects or relations has changed our judgments and heightened our sense of the dependence of our judgment upon our particular point of view. All viciousness or sub jectivity in this conception of relativity is circumvented by the denial of any substantial distinction between the subject and the object, by the recognition that particular points of view are just as spacio-temporal and just as spiritual when they are our own as when they are the moon's. The pre-Socratic hylozoists and the unsophisticated Sophists, with their helmsman in Heraclitus, started phil</page><page sequence="6">546 THE MONIST osophy on a tack which might have kept Western culture out of the doldroms in which it drifted for two thousand years had not Socrates and Plato brought about a calm so absolute that even Aristotle could not keep his sails inflated. The Milesian school explained reality equally well by taking as their point of reference any stage of the world-process such as water, air, or the boundless. In terms of this more or less arbitrarily chosen absolute all else had its being and could be known. Like Tha?es, Pythagoras, too, was more relative than he knew, for before Einstein the Pythagoreans "put the world in numbers." The anti-anthropomorphism of Xenophanes, the fiery flux of Heraclitus, and the man measure doctrine of Protagoras proved too much for the traditional absolutism which, with respect to religion, mor ality, and the state, would let well-enough alone. Instead of accepting relativity and beginning a collection and classi fication of aspects, Socrates and Plato soared into the heavens in quest of an absolute pattern for the whole, and the parts, of a perfect and unchanging city-state. They graciously granted Heraclitus his flux. Things are chang ing and relative, but things are imperfect and lacking in reality. Just here Aristotle almost saw that ships could sail in spite of Platonic calms. Nothing for him was more real than the particulars; their perfection was relative to the unique potentialities which resided in the nature of each. Your Golden Mean could not be mine. Matter and form, even primitive matter and pure form, potentiality and actuality, non-being and being, like genus and species, are instances of mutual relativity. In the first pages of the De Motu Animalium, chiefly, the assumption that only the immovable could create movement kept him from the con ception of the relativity of motion. Yet Aristotle had spent too many years in the Academy not to finish by assuming an unmoved mover and the immortality of species. The attention was again shifted from identities to differences</page><page sequence="7">EVOLUTION OF RELATIVITY 547 by the Cyrenaics, whose psychological and epistemological relativity was continued by the Epicureans. Yet, as in all of these early relativistic views, something like the Epi curean atoms forms a background of absolutistic assump tions. This fact is implied by the very name of the last representatives of this tendency in Greek thought, the Sceptics. It is latent in the concept of probability as de veloped by Carneades. The Sceptics of the first century of the Christian era contributed to the evolution of rela tivity by arguing that a cause is a relatum which can neither be syncronous with, nor precede or follow, the effect. Here the argument waited for David Hume. In passing, one may remember the beautiful characters of Arcesilaus and Carneades, a consequence, perhaps, of their philosophy. Throughout the Middle Ages the concept of relativity awaited the conquering of the unexperienced minds of Western Europe by the centered might of Christian and Platonic absolutism. The relativistic attitude, however, was never entirely absent. Even mysticism has more sig nificance here than appears at first sight. It bears witness for relativity not only negatively in the extent of the world against which it turns its back, and in its opposition to the formulated dogmatism of the period, but also positively in its ready acceptance, as Hocking expresses it, of "a pres ent inspiration as its law."1 Among the intellectuals this same tendency was kept alive by the growing emphasis upon nominalism. The conception of the relativity of per ception and of knowledge was chiefly responsible for the new view of the world created by such minds as Nicolaus of Cusa, Copernicus and Giordano Bruno. Burnt offer ings of living men were sacrificed on the altar of the abso lute that a Galileo, a Kepler, and a Newton might live and think. Here at the dawn of science the evolution of rela xThe Meaning of God in Human Experience, New Haven, 1923, p. 400.</page><page sequence="8">548 THE MONIST tivity was rapid, and culminated in Newton's formulation of the relativity of motion. Yet even Newton was unable to trust his insight, and postulated absolute space, time, and motion. He showed, however, that the followers of a creative mind may be more dogmatic than their master. Newton said that he was only like a boy playing on the seashore, and diverting himself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, while the great ocean of truth lay all before him.2 And Einstein, making a substitution for Descartes's name in another of Newton's remarks, might say, "If I have seen farther than Newton, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants."8 Here I can but mention the steps in the evolution of relativity through the dogmatic abduction of the scien tific methods by Descartes, Spinoza, and Leibnitz ; through English empiricism and scepticism with its almost com plete emancipation from religious absolutism; through Ger man criticism and idealism with its reserve strategy mak ing the last stand against the allied relativistic forces of individualism, positivistic philosophy, psychology, and sci ence; the pragmatic and neo-realistic attitudes of mind; and the development of mathematical theory and scientific experimentation, particularly non-Euclidean geometries and electro-magnetic and optical hypotheses. In science the flower of this evolutionary growth is the theories of Einstein. Einstein's accomplishment is chiefly a synthesis of the results of many different fields of investigation. It deserves the name of physical relativity because of the fundamental role played by the mutual rela tivity of time and space and the absolute relativity of mo tion. This is a physical and metaphysical relativity be cause the real nature of things or events varies with their New2 YorkW?9?7, . " * W' ^ A ^ ?f S ?ce&lt; 3Loe. cit.</page><page sequence="9">EVOLUTION OF RELATIVITY 549 relations. Einstein's frequent mention of the observer's point of view has led to a confusion of relativity with sub jectivity; but in every case the observer could be replaced by some other recording instrument. Moreover, for Ein stein the observer, even in a psychological sense, does not necessarily differ in kind from other parts of the space time continuum. Mind, like matter, is space-time or noth ing. From certain points of view, however, his whole position is characterized by a selective relativity. It is relative in fact, if not in form, to the highest velocity wc know, that of light. It is relative inevitably to the fact that our observations must be made on, and from, the Earth. But of still greater significance for philosophy, the Ein steinian view of the world, like the behavioristic view of the soul, is relative to the mathematical or measuring approach of science. From these points of view the theory of physi cal relativity probably presents an approximately accurate description of an important aspect of reality. We seem to be ready for a thoroughly relativistic phil osophy. Reality is a complex of relations. Entities are re lational configurations whose nature and boundaries are relative to the point of view. Such reality and such enti ties exhibit permanent quantitative characteristics. They exhibit also creativity, originality, development, design. This aspect is most evident to introspection and intuition, which relationships are no more psychological than meta physical. Knowledge is not a function peculiar to that portion of reality we call human, although man most readi ly recognizes it himself and in other entities which his crude senses represent as most analogous to himself. Recep tive knowledge is taking account of the differentiations in one's environment in such a way as to retain a correspond ing set of differentiations within one's own complex of re lations. Tn this way both quantity and quality consist of relations. The most evidently relative are the so-called</page><page sequence="10">550 THE MONIST primary qualities. This is indicated by the inconceivable example of a universal uniform variation. It is said that if absolutely all velocities were suddenly reduced to half their present rate, or all things to half their present size, we should never know the difference. They say truly, for there would be no difference. Such a uniform variation is no variation at all. Likewise, the secondary qualities are but systems of differentiation. If your perceived color scheme varies systematically from mine, it does not vary at all. Yet qualities of this sort,which are introspective appreciations, cannot be reduced to quantity, although the same set of relations seen from a different point of Anew and in a somewhat different total situation, appears as quantity. The validity of the qualitative aspect is sug gested by the fact that all the wisdom which the method of physics and behaviorism can acquire, can be communi cated entire to the congenitally blind man, but can never enable him to understand or appreciate the quality red. The colors correspond to differentiations in certain com plex situations which include eyes. The epistemological significance lies in the theory that the system or form of the relations or differentiations constitutes quality. Ex cept for other relative considerations, such as empathy, the Venus of Melos is just as beautiful in statuette as in heroic size?it is her form that counts. I shall neglect a consideration of the relativity of value for a final observation concerning the value of relativity. First, with respect to accuracy. If Ptolemy, Copernicus, and Einstein each had said, "Relative to my point of view, to the data at my disposal, the most probable explanation of the world is the following," each would have spoken an eternal verity. Moreover, that attitude would have dis couraged their disciples from burning at the stake those who would bring forward new data. The relativistic spirit is death to censoriousness, dogmatism, and such sectarian</page><page sequence="11">EVOLUTION OF RELATIVITY 55* ism as is seen in religion and psychology today and in the way many scientists accept or reject Einstein. In ethics and religion, for how many millions of the most enlightened lives must absolutism answer ! Without the support of the absolutistic attitude of mind, crusades, holy wars, inquisi tions, and pogroms would at least have caused conscientious hesitation on the part of their devoutly sincere perpetrators. Nothing is more encouraging for fanaticism, or more dis couraging for sustained effort, than so-called absolute ideals, which, for all their dialectical and revelational jus tification, are intuitively known to be unattainable, and somehow untrue of the real world. The result is jugglery in the moral life, or a consistency which is worse because sanctioned by fear which is maintained by an ignorance enforced at the hands of absolutism. Relativity goes for ward with the conviction that the relative ideals of the pres ent are attainable at least in that part of their essence which requires that they shall change and develop with in creasing experience and knowledge. Relativity says that no ideal that can be known in the present is good enough for the future. Moreover, my ideal is never good enough for another man. This all means that collectively and in dividually we must help discover our own ideals, and, be cause they are relative, act vigorously upon them in order that their relativity may become more and more inclusive, true of more and more reality, ever adapting them to the actual situations of which they must form parts. In this day, when no man can take all learning for his province, cooperation, the sharing of points of view, is necessary for progress. Since things are essentially rela tive, the best policy is to see a thing in as many of its re lations as possible. In philosophy the absolute played the vicious role of the lotus, lulling to sleep in a dreamy noth ingness those who might have been courageous searchers for new points of view. In science the absolute has, for</page><page sequence="12">552 the monist the same reason, delayed discoveries for centuries. Once the earth was believed flat or at rest, man could be roused from his lethargy only by the dogged insistence of circum stance in the form of a few men who for truth's sake would risk the absolute's hell. The relativistic attitude does not lead to scepticism. The relativist knows that only by action on the basis of present knowledge, with a full awareness of its relative character, will he discover new facts, and arrive at more comprehensive, and therefore more useful, generalizations. The believer in the absolute hesitates to act from fear of his having failed to comprehend the absolute. The rela tivist knows that there is no awful absolute; knows that action must be based upon the relative; knows that the world is an inexhaustible stream of increasingly interesting relations which will blend each individual personality in an ever greater harmony with other personalities and the rest of reality. "New times demand new measures and new men; The world advances, and in time outgrows The laws that in our fathers' day were best ; And doubtless, after us, some purer scheme Will be shaped out by wiser ones than we, Made wiser by the steady growth of truth." ?Lowell.
