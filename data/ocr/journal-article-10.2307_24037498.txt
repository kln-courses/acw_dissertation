<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism Cumulative Index Volumes I-XXXV 1941-1977 Subject Index Author Index Title Index Subject Index Prepared by Lars Aagaard-Mogensen John Fisher, Editor Copyright, 1979 The American Society for Aesthetics</page><page sequence="2">The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism is published quarterly by the Ameri can Society for Aesthetics. Editorial offices are at Temple University, Philadel phia, PA 19122. Business offices are at the Cleveland Museum of Art, Cleveland, OH 44106. Editors of the Journal for the period covered by this Index have been: Vols. I-XXI Thomas Munro Vols. XXI1-XXXI Herbert Schueller Vols. XXXII-XXXV John Fisher</page><page sequence="3">A cumulative index of a scholarly journal is primarily a research tool. It also can provide a synoptic view of the history of the journal and of the discipline which it serves. Aesthetics in the United States is a comparatively new area of independent scholarly concern, and its nascence roughly coincides with the founding of the Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism. One of the unexpected benefits of enduring for many months an office inundated with the data of the following pages was the awareness, which swelled with the accumulating paper, that a field of academic concern was developing, a discipline was being shaped, and tentative, hesitant projections of what aesthetics might become were being realized. Users of these indices, in addition to having at their fingertips easy access to thirty-five years of writing in aesthetics, have data from which they might wish to trace what has been happening in aesthetics and the philosophy of art. The resultant observa tions may prove very interesting. Regular readers of the Journal will have little difficulty using the index. For conven ience, in the latter two indices, references always immediately follow the titles. Refer ences are, in almost all cases, given by volume, followed by page, i.e., 23, 56. In the earliest issues pagination was not consecutive within a volume, thus numbers as well as volumes are identified, i.e., 1, 4, 33. Other idiosyncratic devices are self-explanatory. When James Johnson, then Secretary-Treasurer of the American Society for Aesthet ics, first approached me concerning the project I replied that I had a feeling that it would take a great deal of time and the efforts of a great many people. It took more time than he or I thought and the cooperative effort of a large number of people. Jim Johnson's encouragement was constant and Lars Aagaard-Mogensen broke new ground in working out the structure of the Subject Index. Monroe C. Beardsley was a patient counsel, who in one busy year read a dozen volumes of the Journal cover to cover to test some preliminary indexing categories. A number of Trustees of the ASA, and some other interested mem bers read preliminary drafts (with varying degrees of enthusiasm). Linda Slotnik of the Computer Center of Temple University gave many hours of time and much good advice. William Subers and Ed Silverie of Computer Techni/graphics, Inc., gave indispensable aid. Don Callen and Esther Meek did tedious proofreading of printouts. The project would have been impossible without the support, both tangible and intangible, of the College of Liberal Arts of Temple University and the Temple University Computer Center. But most of all the index is indebted to Grace Stuart, the Journals Editorial Assistant, who made this project her professional life for over a year. Its completion is a tribute to her ability to work with tens of thousands of data entries and stay within the infinitesimal percen tage of error which our most ardent friendly critics will allow. All of these helped, and each one would, I think, say that if we worked on it a bit longer we could improve on it more. Because I said no, let's get it in the hands of the readers now, I'm afraid that the responsibility for any residual flaws are mine, not theirs. So be it.
