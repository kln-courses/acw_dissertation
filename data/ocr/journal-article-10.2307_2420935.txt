<plain_text><page sequence="1">Did the Peclchams Witness the Invention of a Tool by Ammophila urnaria? John A. Frisch, S. J. In the year 1898 the Peckhams reported that they had observed a wasp, of the species Ammophila urnaria (now named Sphex urnarius), repeatedly employ a pebble to pound down the soil used in closing the tunnel of her nest; they concluded that they had witnessed a unique event, the improvising and the intelligent use of a tool by an insect. A drawing of this Ammophila, in the act of using the pebble as a tool, accompanied their report. This drawing has since been copied in many textbooks of biology and psychology, and it is usually supplemented by the statement that this Ammophila was the first insect to improvise a tool. As no mention is made of any wasp using a tool since then, the inference is that this individual Ammophila of the Peckhams was unique indeed, and had neither predecessors nor successors in the use of a tool. Among the more recent authors, who have either reproduced the drawing, or who refer to the observations of the Peckhams are, Wheeler (1923, 1928), Thouless (1927), Wyatt (1930), Shumway (1931), Metcalf and Flint (1932), Folsom and Wardle (1934), Cockerell (1935), Williams (1937), Aaron (1938). The reception given this discovery by the naturalists is exemplified by Hingston (1929) : "To my mind it forms the best instance of intelligence recorded in any insect." The psychologists were even more sanguine. Mc- Dougall (1923) says: "Oh wonderful Ammophila! What shall Fabre or Bergson or the mechanists say to this most irregular behavior, so upsetting to every theory except the common sense theory that instinct and intelligence cooperate most intimately and that, while the wasp has much instinct, she also has some intelligence. Here is Ammophila using a tool! A mode of behavior commonly regarded as the exclusive prerogative of man, sometimes proposed as defining the mark of his species." The sole question I wish to investigate here is, "Did the Peckhams witness the actual invention of a tool?" For the Peckhams to have witnessed the improvising of a tool, the two following conditions would have had to be present: a) that no wasp, or at least no wasp of the species umana had ever before used a pebble or other solid object as a tool to pound the soil, and b) that this particular wasp of the Peckhams regularly employed this method, so as to make certain that her behavior was not an accident, but a designed and intelligent procedure. The second condition was not fulfilled. The Peckhams did not observe their wasp further, perhaps because they erroneously thought that she builds only one cell to her nest. I have found two cells to the nest and have known the wasp to work at her nest for five days. If the Peckhams had known more 345</page><page sequence="2">346 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST about the habits of urnaria they could have observed the wasp further to see whether she repeated her supposedly unique behavior. Nor was the first condition fulfilled, namely that no wasp, at least of the species urnaria had ever before used a pebble or other solid object for pound- ing. Sometime after their observation of their supposedly unique umana, the Peckhams saw a note of a similar but much earlier observation by Williston (1892) on Ammophila yarrowi Cres. But they mistakenly interpreted Willis- ton's account as referring to a single individual. Williston says that the wasps "were so numerous that one was distracted by their multiplicity, but by singling out different individuals we were able to verify each detail of their operations." He then pieces together the isolated observations made on differ- ent individuals into a composite whole?the wasp after digging the nest, selects a door stone, places it in the tunnel and then heaps dirt on it. Still speaking in general terms, and not of a particular wasp, he continues, "When she had heaped up the dirt to her satisfaction, she again flew away and imme- diately returned with a smaller pebble, perhaps an eighth of an inch in diam- eter, and then, standing more nearly erect, with the front feet folded beneath her, she pressed down the dust all over and about the opening, smoothing off the surface, and accompanying the action with a peculiar rasping sound. After all this was done, and she spent several minutes each time in thus stamping the earth so that only a keen eye could detect any abrasion on the surface, she laid aside the pebble and flew away to be gone for some minutes." Every time the wasp returned with a paralyzed larva she opened the nest, took the larva down and then closed "up the entrance precisely as before," Williston's con- cluding remarks leave no doubt that all the wasps were using a pounding pebble: "The thing that struck us as most remarkable was the judgement in the selection of a pebble, precisely the right size to fit the entrance, and the use of the small pebble in smoothing down and packing the soil over the opening, together with the instinct that taught them to remove every evidence that the earth had been disturbed." It is evident that in Ammophila yarrowi the use of a pounding pebble is a fixed habit or instinct, common to all members of the species. Also previous to the observations of the Peckhams, another investigator, Pergande, (1892) described some observations he made on Ammophila gryphus Sm. He says that the wasp "ran a short distance and picked up with its mandibles a small pebble, carried it to the mysterious spot" (the closed entrance tunnel), "and deposited it on top of it, pressing it at the same time down as much as possible to insure its remaining in position. Running then again a short distance it picked up another pebble and placed it close to the first one; after a while a third was added." Unable to find more pebbles, the wasp "returned to its little mound of pebbles, commenced to rearrange them and to press them again down as much as possible." To the student of the habits of wasps, the term "pressing" is synonymous with the term "pound- ing!" This wasp, therefore, used several pounding pebbles and left them on the surface of the nest. Since the time of the observations of the Peckhams, another investigator,</page><page sequence="3">AMMOPHILA URNARIA 347 Hartman, (1905) has observed Ammophila procera. He says that the wasp uses chips of wood, dry leaves and twigs, besides sand, in closing her nest. "When the nest is full enough for the wasp to reach down comfortably, she presses the separate pieces firmly down before she lets go and accompanies the strenuous occupation with a cheerful buzz. Now it sometimes happens, especially towards the end of the operation, that a piece of wood is pressed down tightly, then pulled out and pressed down again and this repeated several times, so that one might suspect that the wasp were here improvising a tool with which to tamp down the sand." Hungerford and Williams (1912) report a small species of Ammophila using a small stick to pack down the earth and a larger species using "as a tool the tibia and tarsus of a small Acridiid." The Raus (1918) report that Ammophila pictipennis uses clods of soil to fill her tunnel, which she 'grinds by a rotary or side motion until worn to dust. When she has thus filled the top of the tunnel level with the ground, she selects " a pebble usually a little larger than her head, but sometimes an unusually hard clod or bit of wood," and this she "brings in her mandibles and grasping it firmly, she rubs, pounds and hammers down the dirt on top of the hole until all traces of the fill are obliterated." Rayment (1935) says: "I venture to assert that the wasp Ammophila already has the ability to use a tool, for I have observed her here in Australia to select a suitable stone and then proceed to ram down loose soil just as a human being would do." It will be observed that none of the above observations refer to Ammophila urnaria. Possibly the urnaria of the Peckhams was the first of her species to use a tool. My own observations show that urnaria uses, besides the finely divided excavated soil, larger lumps of soil, small pebbles and other bulky material in closing the tunnel of her nest. I have repeatedly seen her use bits of wood, twigs and even male pine cones. Thus one urnaria, whose nest was under a pine tree, where the ground was littered with broken pine needles and very small male pine cones, examined in turn several pine cones and finally picked one up and rammed it into the tunnel; but she immediately pulled it out again and dropped it aside. Then she selected another cone, rammed it in and left it there. Next she scraped some soil into the tunnel and rammed it down with her head. Then she alternately rammed pine cones and soil into the tunnel. Next she picked up a pebble, rammed it in, but pulled it out and dropped it aside, as though she had used the pebble to pound in the fine soil. She completed her work by alternately scraping soil into the tunnel and ramming in bits of pine needles, which latter she would occasionally pull out again and lay saide. An enthusiastic observer would be justified in maintaining that this wasp had used male pine cones, pine needles, bits of wood, and a pebble to pound in the finely divided soil; in other words had employed them as tools, but that she did not use the same tool twice. The above observations force the conclusion that all Ammophilas thus far observed, including urnaria, use solid objects as a pounding tool. At best the</page><page sequence="4">348 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST urnaria of the Peckhams could be credited with a more spectacular use of a peb- ble, namely the repeated use of the same pebble. Must such a more spectacular use be considered the invention of a tool? Hardly. For it is quite possible under the laws of chance that the wasp could use the same pebble several times in succession, by accident and quite unintentionally. Such a chance happening would be particularly likely to occur if bulky material were rare in the vicinity of the nest. The Peckhams' description of the closing of the nest of their urnaria creates a strong impression that there actually was little or no bulky material at hand to help in the filling of the tunnel. "In filling her nest she put her head down into it and bit away at the loose earth from all sides, letting it fall to the bottom of the burrow and then, after a quantity had accumulated, jammed it down with her head. Earth was then brought from the outside and pressed in and then more was bitten from the sides. When at last the filling was level with the ground, she brought a small quantity of fine grains of dirt to the spot. . . ." The only, two instances, in which I have observed a wasp fill her tunnel by biting away the walls of the tunnel, occurred where there was a definite shortage of excavated soil or bulky material. Since the use of solid material for pounding is a part of the hereditary equipment of all urnaria, the repeated and successive use of the same pebble is quite within the hereditary capacity of the wasp. Even the exclusive use by an individual urnaria of a pebble for pounding the soil would not argue the invention of a tool. The habitual use of solid materials, including pebbles, for pounding, could easily result in the exclusive use of a pebble. The memory of neater and quicker work, associated with the occasional use of a pebble, could establish a constantly increasing valence for pebbles, to the gradual exclusion of other material; and if pebbles were rare in the vicinity of the nest, could result in the repeated use of the same pebble, without any direct percep- tion on the part of the wasp of the relation of the means employed to the end to be attained. The invention of a tool postulates just such perception of the relation of the means to the end. As stated earlier in this discussion, the Peckhams considered their observa- tion the first recorded instance of the use of a tool by a wasp; it was only some time later that they saw Williston's (1892) earlier report of a similar observa- tion. By some queer mental gymnastics, the discovery that the Ammophila of the Peckhams was not the first, nor the only wasp to use a pebble as a tool, was hailed by the proponents of the intelligence of this act as a further proof of its intelligence. The Peckhams state, "We are claiming a great deal for Ammophila when we say that she improvised a tool and made intelligent use of it, for such actions are rare even among higher animals, but fortunately our observation does not stand alone, although we supposed this to be the case at the time it was made." They then refer to Williston's observation. As we have seen, Williston's observation does not indicate the improvisation of a tool by a single individual, but clearly shows that the use of a tool is a fixed habit of all the individuals of the species yarrowi. Bouvier (1922) is also mistaken when he states expressly that Williston's observation concerned only a single individual. McDougall is doubly wrong when he says: "If the Peckhams'</page><page sequence="5">AMMOPHILA URNARIA 349 instance stood alone, perhaps it would be wise to dismiss it as a joke, a hoax, or an error of observation or of memory. But unfortunately for the theological, the philosophical, and the mechanical theorists, it does not stand alone. Closely similar behavior, on the part of another member of the same species, has been minutely observed by an independent observer in a distant part of America. Are we then to regard each of these two wasps as a lively "bahnbrechende" genius, leading their species onward to the use of tools; individual sports, comparable to the man or ape, who first took a stone in his hand to crack a nut and so foreshadowed the genius of Nasmyth? I see no other plausible interpretation of the facts." Unfortunately for McDougall, his facts are wrong; Williston's report does not deal with a single wasp, and the wasps belong to a different species. Finally, there is a lingering doubt in my mind as to whether the Ammophila of the Peckhams owes her prowess to her spectacular behavior, or rather to a more spectacular description of her behavior. The Peckhams are proclaimed as peerless observers, seeking only the truth and fully aware of the pitfalls of anthropomorphism. Nevertheless, in all their observations they were intent on proving that the wasps performed intelligent acts, and they consider Ammophila3s behavior the crowning glory of their proof. Their sentimentality and their humanizing tendencies are evident in all their studies; they interpret every action of the wasps in terms of our own conduct, and motivate their actions in terms of our own motives. Thus, when their "fastidious little creature" had closed her nest, "she stood back and surveyed the hole, and it seemed to us that we could read pride and satisfaction in her mien." Again, "We remember her as the most fastidious and perfect little worker of the whole season, so nice was she in her adaptation of means to an end, so busy and contented in her labor of love. And so pretty in her pride over her completed work." After using the pebble, "the little creature, all unconscious of the commotion she had aroused in our minds, unconscious indeed of our very existence and intent only on doing her work and doing it well, gave one final, comprehensive glance and flew away." Many of the observations made by the Peckhams were very superficial and led them into wrong conclusions. On the basis of an observation made on a single individual of the wasp Ammobia ichneumonea they state that this species builds only one cell to its nest and stores only one grasshopper as food for her offspring. I have shown (Frisch, 1937) that ichneumonea builds as many as seven cells to her nest and stores up to five grasshoppers in each cell. The Peckhams came upon their ichneumonea on the first day of nest building, after she had constructed the first cell and was storing the first grasshopper. Instead of continuing their observations, they dug up the nest and drew their erroneous conclusions and never checked them. If they had patiently observed the wasp for several days, they would have learned that she closes the nest each evening, but opens it the next morning, and may continue building more cells and storing them for as long as two weeks. This habit of digging up nests without sufficient observation led them into wrong conclusions in other instances.</page><page sequence="6">350 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST However, even granting that the Peckhams' description of the behavior of their Ammophila is not a glorified version of their observations, but is accurate in every detail, they have made of her a rank impostor. If the adoption of solid objects for pounding is the invention of a tool, the credit for the inven- tion must be given to the first wasp to use this method, somewhere in the dim past of geological history; for the method is now an automatic habit, common to all Ammophilas in varying degrees of perfection. Who was this bahn- brechende" genius? Nobody knows; it certainly was not the Ammophila of the Peckhams. REFERENCES AARON, S. F. 1938?Insects with ideas. Nature Mag. 31 (2) :77-79. BOUVIER, E.
