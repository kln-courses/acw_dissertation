<plain_text><page sequence="1">EDIT RIAL nineteenth and twentieth-century schools of painting, more richly represented at Lyon than in any other French pro- vincial museum, and the museum's chief glory. There are no less than 350 reproductions, some in colour. The catalogue notes will seem a little diffuse to those who have been brought up on Martin Davies, but the essential facts are there; as for the art criticism (such phrases as 'la touche pensive de Fantin donne a ce tableau un parfum de sanctuaire' can be found on almost every page), one would have to be a monster of pedantry to remain impervious to its charm. In the scheme for recataloguing the whole National Gallery Collection by schools of painting, a vital role is played by the volumes of illustrations, unquestionably the most remarkable series of its kind to be produced by any museum in the world. Up to now volumes of plates have been published as follows: earlier Italian Schools (two volumes); French; Spanish; Early Netherlandish; eighteenth-century Italian; Dutch (two volumes). It is anticipated that further volumes will be pub- lished covering the sixteenth-century Venetians; the six- teenth-century Italians outside Venice; the German School; and the Flemish and Italian seventeenth century. This will make about thirteen volumes in all, but by the time the series is complete, it is to be hoped that there will be a suffi- cient number of new acquisitions to justify the publication of a supplementary volume, which might also contain reproduc- tions of pictures which have noticeably altered in the course of restoration since their appearance in an earlier volume. The volumes of text catalogues have now been enriched by the quite recent publication of Cecil Gould's sixteenth- century Venetian Schools,5 whilst the Dutch text catalogue, 5 The National Gallery Catalogues. The Sixteenth Century Venetian School. By Cecil Gould. 162 pp. (National Gallery Publications Department), 6s. on which Neil MacLaren has been at work for the last five years, is expected to appear some time this summer. Meanwhile the two magnificent volumes of Dutch plates6 whet the appetite for Mr MacLaren's text. From the cap- tions we are permitted a preview of some of the important changes in attributions since the Dutch entries in the I929 catalogue. The three pictures which used to be 'ascribed to Kalraet' now appear without a question-mark. The puzzling No.2552 has been changed from 'ascribed to de Hooch' to 'Delft School'. No.237 which used to be known as Rembrandt on the strength of its 'signature', is now tentatively given to the mysterious Drost. Three 'Cuyps' (Nos.2546-7-8) have fallen by the wayside. A 'signed' Honthorst portrait (No.3315) has become a possible C. van Everdingen. The St Paul (No. 3590) which used to be thought Spanish, is now brought into relation with a composition by the third De Gheyn. A 'Ruisdael' (No.987) has become a possible Johan van Kessel, and No.72 is now a Lievens. For the Family Group (No.I699) which used to be thought of as Sweerts, the name of Michiel Nouts is suggested as a possibility. No.2gog9, formerly as Italian School, has become a Poelenburgh. The Fish Market has now been handed to De Witte. The 'Hercules Seghers' (No.4383) is now turned down. These are only a few of the sixty or more changes in the labelling, and include none of the pictures acquired during the last thirty years. The value of this aspect of the volumes will of course diminish as soon as Mr MacLaren's text appears. But the beauty of the repro- ductions will remain a permanent source of pleasure and interest. 6 National Gallery Catalogues. Dutch School XVII-XIX Centuries. Plates. Vol.i, A-M.

JOHN SHEARMAN Andrea del Sarto's Two Paintings of the Assumption WITHIN the framework imposed on Sarto's development by the standard chronology, the third decade seems even more baffling than the second. The rediscovery of the inner logic of his art in this last decade of his activity necessitates, in the first place, the elimination of those works regularly placed there which in fact belong to the previous decade,2 and in the second place a re-examination of those works that re- main securely later than 1520, to see that their chronological order is correct. The present enquiry into the problem of the two Assunta, his largest altar-pieces, is an attempt at this 1 The problem discussed in this article arose out of a general study of Sarto's paintings and drawings which will appear soon, I hope, as a monograph. This study began some years ago within a thesis written for the University of London on the more general subject of the use of colour in Florentine painting in the early Cinquecento, and it has been made possible by generous grants from the Central Research Funds of the University. I am particularly grateful to Pro- fessor Johannes Wilde for his guidance and encouragement at every stage. 2 One such elimination was made by RAGGHIANTI in his article 'Andrea del Sarto a Cortona' in Critica d'Arte, vII [1949-50], pp.II3 ff. The principal con- clusion of this study - that the crucially important composition of the lost Madonna di Porta a Pinti is to be dated at the latest in 1515 instead of c. 525 as is usual - is, I think, incontrovertible, and is the most important contribution to the understanding of Sarto's position in Florentine painting that has been published for many years. second task, which I hope will clarify the direction of Sarto's style in his later years. The nature of this problem itself suggests an approach in three phases: first, an analysis of the sources, which have demonstrably been misinterpreted; second, an examination of the many drawings for the two altar-pieces; and third, a summary of the stylistic differences between them, and the relation of this difference to the direction of style indicated by the securely dated works of the 1520'S. The two Assunta, although originally painted for widely separated sites, are now both in the Pitti Palace. The version (No.225, Fig.3) with the Virgin looking out towards the spectator, the putti praying, and the two patron saints in addition to the apostles, was painted for Margherita Passer- ini of Cortona, and is usually (though not invariably) known as the 'earlier' one; there is a document which gives a date around I526 for this painting. The other version (No.191, Fig.2) with the Virgin looking up, the putti standing, and no saints beyond the apostles, was painted for Bartolomeo Panciatichi the elder, for an altar in Lyon; there is no direct documentation for this version, but it is usually known as the I24</page><page sequence="2">2.

But both artists, when they returned to a prob- lem once momentarily solved, felt the necessity for a funda- mental recasting of their apparently-repeated compositions according to a more advanced style. Clearly, since the two Assunta are in outline so similar, such differences as there are become critically important in asses- sing Sarto's development in the '20's; it is sufficient only to imagine the chaos that would exist in Leonardo studies if there were doubt about the order of his two Madonnas. One very simple observation should immediately raise a question mark against the present choice of 'early' and 'late' versions. Vasari tells us (and his evidence cannot be doubted) that the head in the rear of the Assunta Panciatichi (Fig.2) is a self- portrait; it follows that the similar head, partly obscured by St Thomas' hand, in the rear of the Passerini version (Fig.3) is also a self-portrait, and it is this one, with its lined and sunken cheeks and eye-sockets, which is nearer to the very late, movingly honest self-portrait as St Joseph in the Madonna Borgherini in New York.4 For the Assunta Passerini, the relevant document is the will of the donor, dated 28th April, I526.5 Among other things, this binds her heirs to ensuring that a painting by Magistro Andrea Pictore Florentino for the high altar of Sancte Marii suorum extra portam at Cortona (S. Antonio)6 is completed 3 It would be pointless to quote all the modem opinions giving the late date C. 1530; the following are among the most authoritative: F. KNAPP: Andrea del Sarto, Leipzig [1907] and [i928], p.1oI; F. DI PIETRO: I disegni di Andrea del Sarto negli Uffizi, Siena [I9IO], p.85; B. BERENSON, 1932 Lists; I. FRAENCKEL: Andrea del Sarto, Strasbourg [I1935], pp.146, 230. L. BECHERUCCI: Andrea del Sarto (in series I grandi maestri del disegno), Milan [I1955], p. 14, decided that this was the later version, but did not specify a date. BERENSON, in both editions of the Drawings. . ., dates both before 1528. In the nineteenth century, however, it was normal to date this version in the early '2o's; for example, REUMONT: Andrea del Sarto, Leipzig [1835], p.I98 ('Nicht lange nach seiner Riickkehr aus Frankreich') and H. GUINNESS: Andrea del Sarto, London [1899], p. 104 (c.1523). In modern literature this is very rare. VENTURI: Storia . . , ix, i, p.599, discusses both after the I 525 Madonna del Sacco, but calls the Passerini version a 'replica libera . . . opera di scuola', which at least implies that he gave precedence to this one, and A. E. POPHAM, in Catalogue of the Italian Drawings exhibited at the Royal Academy, London [x93I], p.56, discussing a drawing then in the Oppenheimer Collection, dates it c. 1521. 4 VASARI: Vite [1550], p.754. The self-portrait in the Madonna Borgherini is in the reverse sense; however, in the earliest stages of this composition the head and shoulders were projected remarkably close to those in the Assunta 225 (rather than No.19I) and in the same sense; this stage is preserved in the drawing in the Uffizi, No.6445f recto (now treated as a copy, and rejected as such by DI PIETRO, op. cit., P.75, n.3, and FRAENCKEL, op. cit., p. 194, but correctly treated as authentic by L. MARCUCCI in the Catalogue of the Uffizi exhibition [1954], under No.23; on the verso are further studies for the same Madonna). A draw- ing at Windsor (A. E. POPHAM and j. WILDE: Italian Drawings at Windsor Castle, Cat. No.264, Fig.58) is probably a copy after a drawing by Sarto for his head in the Assunta 225. 5 Unpublished; Archivio di Stato, Florence, V225, fol. I35 if. The document mentioned by MILANESI (Vite, v [i88o], p.34, n.I, Arch. di St. V224, I4) is an exact and more easily read copy of the original, dated 8th August, I526. It is odd, at first sight, that Vasari was ignorant of such an important work as the Assunta 225, but this may perhaps be explained by the execution of this very large panel in Cortona itself; there is evidence that Sarto had Cortonese pupils, and a Signorelli in Cortona (the altar-piece from the Cappella di S. Onofrio, in the Duomo, now in Perugia) clearly provided the prototype for the S. Onofrio in Sarto's Gambassi Madonna (Pitti No.307) painted c.I526-7. Vasari's trans- ference to Bandinelli's studio in 1525-6 (see below, p.128) may have been another result of the same hypothetical interval. 6 Variously known as the Convento dei Padri Servi di Maria Vergine in S. Antonio, S. Antonio de'Servi, S. Antonio Abbate, etc. The church is very small according to a contract already made with the artist. The subject is to be the Assumption cum aliisfiguris, and the price, I55 florins (more, or less, according to the said contract). The contract itself has not been found. In the Assunta No.225, which is known to have been removed from S. Antonio in I639, the saint kneeling to the right (Fig.I), actively a par- ticipator in the mystery, is S. Margherita Penitente, patron saint of Margherita Passerini and of Cortona as a whole.7 There can be no doubt that this painting is the one referred to in the document, and that it was, therefore, already com- missioned, but not delivered, by Spring 1526. For the Assunta Panciatichi the evidence of the sources is decidedly more complex. The following information is given by Vasari: 'Faceva allora in Francia molte faccende di mercanzia Bartolomeo Panciatichi il vecchio: et desideroso lasciare memoria di se in Lione; ordinO a Baccio d'Agnolo, che Andrea li dipignissi una tavola, per mandarsi dl; nella quale volse una assunta di Nostra Donna, . . . Questafu poi da Bartolomeo Panciatichi il giovane suo figliuolo, riposta nelle sue case . .. 8 Bartolomeo Panciatichi il vecchio spent most of his life in Lyon, and died there in 1533. In 1517 he founded a chapel in the Dominican church in Lyon, and in his will increased his gifts to it; it was presumably for this chapel that the Assunta was ordered.9 It would be absurd to question Vasari's information, since he knew Sarto, Baccio d'Agnolo, and the picture itself very well,10 and - given the date of the founda- tion of the chapel - there is no reason here for thinking that - only about 25 yards long - so that an altar-piece on the scale of the Assunta would have been an imposing image. 7 1247-97; she was beatified by Leo X (24th Nov. I515), who was the life- long friend of Silvio Passerini, son of Margherita, governor of Florence for Clement VII from 1524, and an early patron of Sarto's. 8 Vite [I550o], P.754- 9 The Dominican church known as Notre-Dame-de-Confort was the natural site for Bartolomeo's new chapel; in the Quattrocento and Cinquecento it was extensively patronized by the Florentine community, who even went so far as to rebuild the nave in the early fifteenth century and have the dedication changed to St John the Baptist (R. P. MIGHEL CORMIER: L'Ancien Couvent des Dominicains de Lyon, Lyon, I [I898], p.26). The church was demolished in I823. The date of I517 for the foundation of the chapel was already given in L. PASSERINI: Genealogia e storia della famiglia Panciatichi, Florence [i858], p.67. He also gives as the original dedication of the chapel the one it certainly held in the seventeenth century: Notre-Dame du Rosaire, but it seems likely from the other sources that this was given to it by the Dominican Fathers long after the Panciatichi had neglected the chapel. Mention should be made of an early eighteenth-century source which gives a later date for the chapel; this is a Plan Gdometrique de l'ancien couvent . . . etc., subsistans en *709, avec la disignation et explication de chaque chose ou sont les chiffres . . . drawn up by PR. FR. SIMEON A. RAMETTE in I719, (published by CORMIER, op. cit., p. I if.) No.67 (CORMIER, p.22) reads: 'Chapelle voutee . . . que Barthilemy Panchati noble Florentin, fit construire en I526, etyfit mettre ses armes.' RAMETTE is also the source of the description given by J.-B. MARTIN: Histoire des Eglises et Chapelles de Lyon, Lyon [ I 908], I, p.46, who, however, misquotes the date as 1525. RAMETTE was conceivably reading an inscription in the chapel marking its completion; he was quite certainly wrong about its foundation. A medal exists with (on the obverse) 'BARTHOLOMEUS .PANCIATIC.CIVIS.FLORETI.' and his bust-portrait, and (on the reverse): 'HANC.CAPPELLA.FUNDAVIT.ANO.DM.MDXVII.L.X.' and the es- cutcheon (A. ARMAND: Les Midailleurs Italiens, II [1883], P.97, No.16). According to LE COMTE DE CHARPIN-FEUGEROLLES: Les Florentins a Lyon, Lyon [ I 893], p. 156, an example of the medal was fpund beneath the chapel during its demoli- tion. The corresponding medal for the foundation of the chapel of Tommaso Guadagni in the opposite aisle (for which the Salviati altar-piece in the Louvre was eventually painted) is dated I 523 (ARMAND, op. cit., p.96, No. I I). Fragments of the Guadagni chapel survive (MARTIN: Recherches sur l'architecture . . . etc de Lyon, Paris [I855], p.II ff.), and a description is given by F. z. COLLOMBET: L'Eglise et le Couvent des Dominicains de Lyon, Lyon [1843], p.i6, and if these give a guide to the character of the slightly earlier Panciatichi chapel, Sarto's panel would have had a worthy setting - austere but of fine quality - and one as startlingly novel to the Lyonnais as it would have been itself. 10 As pointed out by H. WAGNER: Andrea del Sarto, Seine Stellung zu Renaissance und Manierismus, Basle [1950], p.59, the Assunta composition influenced Vasari's own picture for the Badia; this is particularly true of its colour-composition. I27</page><page sequence="5">ANDREA DEL SARTO S TWO PAINTINGS OF THE ASSUMPTION the commission for the altar-piece need have been much delayed. But Vasari says more, which gives a very positive clue to the date of the execution of the altar-piece: 'La quale Andrea condusse fin' presso alla fine; ma il legname di quella parecchie volte si aperse: Et cosi ella rimase adietro non finita del tutto alla morte sua.' What Vasari does not say is that it was left unfinished because of Sarto's death, yet this is how his statement has been abridged by most modern writers, with the then logical con- clusion of a date c. I529-30.11 Now in fact Vasari places the Assunta Panciatichi relatively early: before the plague (late in 1523) and just after a fresco in the Chiostro dello Scalzo which we know to have been painted in I523.12 This part of Vasari's text is chronologically very confused, so that the precise relationship to other works is to be treated sceptically, but what is important is that he places the Assunta before the journey to the Mugello (late I523, to escape the plague) for that means also that he places it before his own arrival in Florence, in May I524. Vasari's evidence may be used in a special way. His apprenticeship with Sarto was not a long one, according to his own account, and it seems to have begun immediately on Sarto's return to Florence; certainly, he was present when Sarto copied the Raphael Leo X with the two Cardinals, which was between December I524 and October I525; his trans- ference to Bandinelli's studio could not have been before the end of I525.13 He left Florence after the Tumulto del Venerdi, May I527, but he was there again for a few months before October 1529, when he departed for Pisa and Bologna; Sarto died a year later. Two points follow from this: first, that Vasari reports Sarto's work from 1524 to 1527, and again in the autumn of I529, as an eye-witness, but that, for the rest, his Vita is a reconstruction; second, part of his evidence for this reconstruction would have been what he knew to be already extant on his arrival in I524. If he declares that a work is (by the implication of the context) before I524, one must find a very good reason for refusing to accept his word as a starting point in chronology problems. The converse, of course, is far from a necessity: if he declares that a painting is later, there is the possibility that it already existed, but that he did not see it on his first visit to Florence; the Last Supper is a case in point.14 But a careful reading of the Vita 11 The birth of the legend may perhaps be witnessed in the distortion of Vasari's text produced byG. PIACENZA, in his edition of BALDINUCCI: Notizie ... , I [i 770], p.434: 'la qual tavola avendo egli condotta fin presso alfine, non potJ tuttavia terminarla, impedito dalla morte, che non gli diede tempo di superar la pessima natura del legname, il quale parecchie volte . . .' etc. 12 The Feast of Herod; see MILANESI, op. cit., p.70. 13 KALLAB: Vasaristudien, Vienna [I908], p.24. 14 This appears, in Vasari's chronology, during the period of his absence from Florence, and this late dating has been followed almost without exception in the literature (with results disastrous to the attempt to describe Sarto's stylistic evolution), in spite of, or sometimes without reference to, the fact, known from a ricordo datable I 526, that the fresco was commissioned 15th June 15I9, by Don Ilario Panichi (Arch. di St., Convento 88, Vol.3, c.7r.; cited, but not published, by MILANESI, p.47, n.2; the surviving documents for S. Salvi begin only in I525); in this ricordo there is no hint that in I526 the contract was unfulfilled: 'Ricordo come in sino a di I5 di r519 donno Ilario Panichi allogo a andrea d'agnolo dipintore affare et dipignere uno cenacolo o vero mensa nel nostro refettorio compacto e convenzione come si vede in una scriptafacta per loro sottoscritta sotto decto di di che ne debbe havere per decta dipintura Fiorini Trentotto lar(ghi) . . . Fi.38'. On the other hand, this is one of a group of records of expenses incurred 'in piu volte' by Don Ilario, and the inference is that the 38 florins due to the artist had in fact been paid. There is further evidence for the early date of the Last Supper; the only real hint of a late date is from Vasari, who places it with two works dated 1528 - that is to say, during his own absence. This is fairly easy to understand as an intelligent guess; the fresco only became generally known during the 128 will show that the chronology of the '20's is only subject to errors of this kind; in only one case can it be shown that a work placed by Vasari before the I523-4 Mugello interval is likely to be later.15 It is therefore a hypothesis worth test- ing that Vasari found the Assunta Panciatichi already in its present cracked and incomplete condition in the studio on his own entry there, probably late in I524.16 The provenance of this version from the studio to the Pitti can be followed in detail. 17 To summarize: the external evidence is not definitive, but favours the precedence of the Panciatichi version, and certain- ly lends no support to the usual dating. Therefore our analy- sis of the drawings may reasonably begin with those made for this version, but there are a few preliminary remarks to be made. Firstly, it was already pointed out by Ingeborg Fraenckel, who believed in the precedence of the Passerini version, how very few drawings could in fact be associated with that version, compared with the other.18 Secondly, it will be clear that - whichever came first - many drawings made for the first would be re-used for the second, while for those parts that were to be radically changed new studies would be made; perhaps the most vital over-all result of examining the drawings for the two altar-pieces is that those which can only be connected with the Passerini version are exclusively for those parts where the paintings differ in con- struction, while those that were used for both can in most cases be shown to have been made in the first place for the partial destruction of the monastery in the siege. VARCHI (Storia ... ., x, 29, ed. MILANESI, Florence, n [1858], p. 131) gives October 1529 as the date of the general 'scorched-earth' order, and his immediately subsequent account of the S. Salvi scandal is misleading; the precise date of 25th April 1530 is supplied by a letter of CARLO CAPELLO'S of the next day (ALBERI: L'Assedio di Firenze, Florence [I840], p.I92, and ROTH: L'Ultima Republica Fiorentina, Florence [I929], p.275, n.2). To judge from the astonishment of the Signoria's demoli- tion squad (recorded by VARCHI) it seems probable that the fresco was known previously only to a very few, and it was not likely to have been seen by Vasari during his two first visits to Florence. What is certainly unjustified on any count, is the surprisingly frequent dating, in recent literature, 1525-6; had it been painted at any time between autumn 1524 and spring 1527 Vasari would surely have known the circumstances of its execution. 15 One exception in effect proves the rule: the S. Godenzo Annunciation (Pitti No. 97), which Vasari groups early with the SS. Annunziata Nativity of the Virgin (ed. MILANESI, v, p. 17), whereas the painting is a studio-product dependent upon studies made in I528 - that is to say, at a time when Vasari would not have witnessed its execution, and he would be unlikely to have toured the Mugello extensively in his earliest Florentine years. As on so many other occasions Vasari gives a similar date to works which have only a circumstantial or topographical connexion (S. Godenzo was a benefice of the Servi); no such considerations affect the issue in the case of the Assunta Panciatichi. 16 Obviously incomplete parts include the tablets above, and St Thomas's left foot. The panel is also split quite badly, and this may have happened early, but it seems likely that Vasari is here - as so often - accurate in observation but speculative in interpretation; the reason for non-completion is likely to be not so much the split in the panel, as the international situation; the un- certainty of the future of France around 1525 (deeply felt in Florence) surely prevented the delivery of other paintings ordered from Sarto in the same period for France which remained in Florence. 17 From Sarto's studio at his death it passed to the son of the patron (Anon. Magl., ed. FREY, Berlin [I892], p.io8); in the 1550 Vite Vasari repeats this information, but in his second edition (ed. MILANESI, V, p.33) states: 'E oggi questa nella villa de'Baroncelli poco fuor di Fiorenza, in una chiesetta stata murata da Piero Salviati vicina alla sua villa per ornamento di detta tavola . . . ' (repeated almost verbatim by BORGHINI: Riposo [I584], p.422). In fact it must have entered the possession of the Strozzi family, already, some time before I548, when the villa (now Poggio Imperiale) was confiscated from them by Cosimo I. The villa (and presumably the altar-piece) then passed to the Orsini and the Odescalchi, and was finally bought back again, in I602, by Maria Maddalena of Austria (ANGUILLESI: Notizie Storiche dei Palazzi, e Ville appartenenti alla I e R. Corona di Toscana, Pisa [I815], p.9i). According to a memoria in the Scrittoio delle R. Possessioni, quoted by DOMENICO MORENI: Contorni di Firenze, II, Florence [I792], p.I6I, Maria Maddalena paid Iooo scudi separately for the Assunta. 18 Old Master Drawings, ix [June 1934], p.Io.</page><page sequence="6">ANDREA DEL SARTO S TWO PAINTINGS OF THE ASSUMPTION Panciatichi version. Lastly, a complication: this was not the first time that Sarto had had cause to think about the com- positional problem of the Assumption. Already in 1515 a fresco of this subject had been commissioned from him, for the Chiostro dei Voti in SS. Annunziata; the contract was finally passed to Rosso nearly two years later.19 No drawings con- nected with this commission are known to me, but it would be unreasonable to suppose that the problem had not passed through Sarto's mind; and given the squat format of the fresco-fields in SS. Annunziata, it should not be surprising if his first thoughts for the tall altar-pieces showed a densely- compressed figure-composition more compatible with the low format, and with his figure-style of the middle of the second decade, rather than of the third. That, at least, may be a partial explanation of the strange compositional study in the British Museum. I. B.M. i9io-2-i2-37 (Figs.5, 7). This is perhaps the most important of the drawings in the present context: I will deal with the verso first.20 The primary study on this side, in black chalk, shows a female nude in violent, rising contrapposto surrounded by figures (the sheet is cut on the right here), and with, it seems, clouds above; these are all contained in one tall composition, the boundary of which is drawn on the left. On the left of this study is a clarification of the left-hand group from the first, and (more lightly) a swift sketch of a kneeling figure turned in profil perdu to the right, and looking slightly upwards. Above these secondary studies, and drawn with the sheet turned the other way, is a characteristically brilliant sketch of a winged dragon, which has no connexion. All these secondary studies are in red chalk. At first sight, the primary study seems to be connected with the left-hand part of the Scalzo fresco of the Dance of Salome (paid for in January 1522), and the connexion is im- portant; but it cannot have been a study for that fresco: this much is made clear by the very tall format of the composi- tion, by the nebulous background, and by its intimate con- nexion with the secondary study, which has no analogy with the fresco. On the other hand it does seem to be a study for the Assunta, which is significantly directly connected with the Dance of Salome in that the left-hand figure in each case is dependent upon the same drapery-study for its lower half;21 parenthetically, it may be pointed out at this point that the Panciatichi version is closer in this detail to the fresco than is the Passerini one.22 It is not illogical that the artist's ideas for fresco and altar-piece, should have taken shape together, but in this sketch a higher position for the central figure, who must be identified as the Virgin, is already contemplated; this is clear from the upwards gaze of the attendant figures in the primary and secondary studies.23 19 MILANESI, op. cit., V, p.67, and p. 157, n.i. 20 To my knowledge these studies on the verso have never been connected with any particular work, and have not been reproduced. They are not mentioned in the original publication of the recto (Vasari Society, I, vii, No.5) but were accepted as authentic by KNAPP ([I928], p. 117), and by BERENSON (No. I38A).

I97) rejected the verso, and proposed an attribution to Puligo, with whose style there is certainly no resemblance. 21 This connexion was already pointed out, with reference to the Passerini version, by Fraenckel. Compare Uffizi 282f recto, where the figure was posed for the fresco (B.B.I IB, Fig.854). 22 Furthermore, the apostle on the right, looking down into the tomb in the former and differently posed in the latter, uses the same figure-study as the Herod in the Scalzo fresco, or vice versa. 23 For the understanding of the main study of the British Museum drawing it is important to notice that at the last stage, when the pose of the female nude was The experiments with the pose of the Virgin in this sketch are more logically related to the Panciatichi version (Fig.2), and in fact follow the pattern of immediately preceding Florentine Assunta - for example, Fra Bartolomeo's. 24 It must have been at the succeeding stage, now lost to us, that there came into Sarto's mind a memory of Pinturicchio's Assunta in S. Maria del Popolo, for - broadly speaking - it is this pattern that is imposed upon the ideas in the British Museum sketch to produce the basis of the final composition. The kneeling figure lightly sketched on the same sheet becomes the foreground figure in each version; the pose as shown in this early stage (with the head turned away) was further developed in another, as yet untraced, drawing (Fig. 12): a nude study, closer in pose, in the slope of the book and in type, to the young apostle of Assunta igi, than to the S. Nicholas of Bari of Assunta 225.25 The recto of the British Museum sheet (Fig.7) contains pre- liminary studies of various kinds for the putti immediately below and to the right of the Virgin of the Panciatichi ver- sion;26 these studies need no explanation, but they support the recognition of the studies on the verso as being for the Assunta composition, though not, to be strict, necessarily for this version. However, there is one child on this sheet who is not connected with either, and has so far remained un- identified: the one drawn twice towards the top right-hand corner. These two studies were made for the Christ-child in the Madonna della Scala in the Prado, painted for Lorenzo Iacopi about 1522-3 ;27 they may be directly compared with the more elaborate studies for the same child on a sheet in the Uffizi.28 All these studies of children are stylistically con- sistent with one another, and with the drawings on the verso. II. Louvre I685. This drawing establishes a further link between the studies for the Assunta composition and those for the Madonna della Scala; it quite clearly served for the heads of the left-hand figures in each case.29 The setting of the shoulders and the details of the hair suggest that it was in fact made, in the first place, for the apostle in the Assunta Panciatichi. III. British Museum, Fawkener 52o10.63.30 The major studies on the recto are for the putti beside the Virgin in the elaborated, the other figures were cancelled. For an equally violent contrapposto, cf. Domenico Campagnola's engraved Assunta of 1517 (repr. VENTURI: Storia, ix, 3, Fig.340). 24 Compare the two drawings at Munich, Nos.2158-9 of c.I516 (one of them reproduced in GABELENTZ: Fra Bartolomeo, II, Liepzig [1922], pl.64). This, of course, sidesteps an insoluble problem: Fra Bartolomeo was by this date draw- ing upon Sarto's compositions, and it is by no means to be excluded that he had seen a project of Sarto's for the I515 composition. 25 This photograph was very kindly made by Dr Isolde Harth from one in the Kunsthistorisches Institut in Florence. 26 This identification was already proposed by SIDNEY COLVIN in Vasari Society, loc. cit. 27 Cf. VASARI: Vite [I550], P.757, and [1568], ed. MILANESI, V, p.37. 28 No.29if; reproduced and identified as here, by DI PIETRO, op. cit., Fig.40, PP.59-6o. The sketch of this child on the British Museum sheet must be the earlier draft, as the pentimenti here bring the pose into line with the Uffizi study and the painted version. 29 Connected with the Madrid altar by BERENSON: Drawings, I [1903], p.294, and [1938], No. 49, Fig.9oi; with the Assunta 225, by GUINNESS, pl.IN, p.50; rejected by FRAENCKEL, p. 199, as a copy, possibly after a study for Assunta 225. BECHERUCCI (pl.32) seems to have been the first to recognize its dual connexion with the Madrid altar and Assunta igi. 80 Recto and verso reproduced by CAMPBELL DODGSON in Old Master Drawings, I, i, pl.8, 9 (the recto as studies for the putti in the 1528 Quattro Santi).

On the verso of this sheet is a drawing of a skull and one bone, surely made, like the other studies of skulls and jaw-bones in the Uffizi,3l for the fictive ledge above the fresco-cycle in the Scalzo. The latest occasion upon which these could have been made was just before the last of these decorative parts was completed, in February I522.32 IV. Uffizi 3I4f, recto. These studies of children (there are two more, seated, on the verso) have been connected with the putti in the Assunta 9I ;33 the analogy between the standing boy and the one in the rear of the group around the Virgin is close, but it should be clear from the direction of the light- ing and the precise view-point (rather higher in the drawing) that this study could not actually have been made originally for this purpose, but was only adapted subsequently. In fact, the drawing was first made for another part of the Scalzo decoration, the bases below the frescoes on the entrance wall, where reversed pairs of these putti support the tablets.34 This part of the decoration cannot be precisely dated, but it would be reasonable to place it between the decorative parts above (February I522) and the first fresco on the right wall (paid for November I524); it therefore presumably dates from the period just before the Mugello interval. These four sheets of drawings are those connected with the Assunta Panciatichi which bear implications of a date;35 it can- not be claimed, strictly speaking, that the evidence in any one case is conclusive, but taken together they do indicate a date of around I522 for the conception of the work, and this agrees well enough with what may be deduced from the 31 Uffizi 6423f r. and v.; the recto is reproduced by KNAPP [I928], Fig.91. These were already connected with the Scalzo by Di Pietro. This drawing is now classed as a copy in the Uffizi, which is, to my eye, an underestimation. The verso of the British Museum sheet was tentatively connected with the Scalzo by FRAENCKEL, p. 179. 32 MILANESI, op. cit., p.70. The strip of decoration over the four frescoes on the right wall (and therefore over the last two of Sarto's, painted 1524 and 1526), had already been painted by Franciabigio or his assistant during Sarto's absence in France 1518-19: on i8th March 1519 Franciabigio was paid for three of these sections, at the rate of 14 1. each, and on 3rd April a further 14 1. for unspecified work, presumably the remaining section - certainly all four sections on this wall are homogeneous in colour and fattura. 33 Originally, but tentatively, by DI PIETRO, p.88; confidently, by P. N. FERRI: Disegni . . . degli Uffizi, iv, Florence [1916], iii, 25. BERENSON [1903], No.73, and [1938], No.I I3D did not accept this, proposed no alternative, but dated the sheet soon after I520, which is entirely convincing. The seated study on the recto is now in an unsympathetic state, being reinforced and largely ruined by heavy, greasy chalk, and this may have led Fraenckel (p.i88) to reject the studies as school-work. 34 Probably the other studies on this sheet were made from the same model while searching for the motif. 35 The following drawings are also authentic and for this version: (i) Uffizi 303 (BERENSON [1938], Fig.899), (ii) Uffizi I486 Orn. recto (KNAPP [1907], Fig.iI8). See also note 40 below. Uffizi 626E r. and v. may also be connected. The following drawings do not apply, but have been connected in the past: (i) B.M.I896-8-IO-I r. (by KNAPP [1907] and [I928], p.II7): studies for Baptist of Wallace Madonna (BERENSON [1903], No.13 I, [1938], Fig.89i); (ii) Frits Lugt Collection (formerly Oppenheimer), man's head in profile to the right; frequently identified with one of the apostles in No.I9I (e.g., in Oppen- heimer sale catalogue [1936], pl.43), but in reality a study for the portrait-head in the Vienna Tobias altar; (iii) Uffizi 278f (by BERENSON [I903], I, p.294, and [1938] No.109B): now attributed to 'Anon. Fior. affine al Boscoli', which is cer- tainly nearer the mark; (iv) Uffizi 302f (by GUINNESS, BERENSON [1903], KNAPP [1907] and [I928], Fig. I03): copy after Uffizi 303f (DI PIETRO, p.87); (v) Uffizi 648 r. (BECHERUCCI, pl.3I), frequently connected with the third head from the left in the Passerini version, and with the Berlin altar (now burnt) by BERENSON: on the verso of this sheet is an unnoticed study for a figure to the left in the 152 I fresco at Poggio a Caiano, and the recto agrees well with the head of the same figure; it is not, however, impossible that it was later adapted for heads on the left of each Assunta. sources. Since there is no outstanding reason for dissociating the Passerini version from the document of spring I526, we are led to the conclusion that the Panciatichi version is the earlier; this is confirmed by two further drawings. V. The first of these, in the collection of Mr Frits Lugt, is the earliest and one of the most interesting of the series (Figs.4, 6);36 both recto and verso contain studies preliminary to those of the British Museum drawing, and the relationship between the two must be an immediate one. On the verso are the first ideas for the grouping of the apostles; two groups are shown, one a variant of the other. The left-hand figure in each group reappears on the left in the British Museum sheet (Fig.5) and eventually takes its place on the left of the Assunta composition; the right-hand figure, with head bowed into the ample folds of the robe, and arms raised in front, becomes finally the St John, crouching and looking into the tomb.37 The three rapid studies of dragons on this sheet are obviously related again to the British Museum drawing; again, they are independent, drawn with the sheet first on its side, and then turned upside-down.38 On the recto of Mr Lugt's drawing are the first studies, drawn from the life, for the putto below the Virgin; the boy was posed in a standing position, and drawn down to the thighs - the brief indica- tions of legs flung back are clearly drawn separately to con- vert what Sarto saw into what he needed. In the continuing process in the British Museum studies (Fig.7) the boy becomes a putto of the right age, and more abstracted, so to speak - more in conformity with the artist's personal forms, and less objective. Since in this indivisible pair of drawings there are studies for a second putto who appears only in Assunta igi, it is abundantly clear that the putto who is common to both versions, and who was studied ab initio in these drawings, was drawn in the first place for Assunta i9i. VI. Corsini 124156 (Fig.8). The beautiful drawing on the recto of this sheet was first published by Fraenckel, as the study for the head of St Thomas in Assunta 225 (which she believed to be the earlier).39 If we consider carefully the relation of the head to the diagonal slant of the shoulders in the drawing, we find this relationship in the pose of the St Thomas in Assunta igi, while in the other the raising of the arm brings the upper part of the body into pure profile, with the further shoulder hidden; moreover the relation of hair, neck and collar in the drawing is the one found in the former altar-piece, but somewhat adjusted in the latter. But on the verso of this sheet (Fig. i o) is the study for the Passerini St Thomas, more fluid, and limited to a few specific points of detail: precisely those points upon which the two 36 I am very much indebted to Mr Lugt for supplying me with photographs and for permission to publish his drawing. It was exhibited in Amsterdam in 1934 (Italiaansche Kunst in Nederlandsch Bezit, Stedelijk Museum, No.644); in the catalogue entry (by Mr Lugt) both recto and verso were already related to one of the two Pitti Assunta, and the recto was connected with that of the British Museum drawing. 37 The motif may also be compared to the angel in the Scalzo fresco, the Annunciation to Zacharias, finished by 22nd August 1523. 38 These splendid studies remain enigmatic; they seem to be for an opponent suitable for a St George, for example (cf., Durer's 1505 woodcut) and to be quite distinct from Sarto's persistent dragon-type for St Margaret's attribute on the one hand (Dresden and Pisa altar-pieces) and from the anthropomorphic devil subdued by St Michael on the other (predella of 1528 Quattro Santi in the Uffizi); there must have been some other project occupying Sarto's mind at this moment, upon which it is possible to speculate, but of which we have no real knowledge. 39 Old Master Drawings [June I934], pp.8 ff, and pl.1o.

The drawing can only be explained satis- factorily by the supposition that Sarto drew the study on the recto, complete and self-contained, and then later, when he was faced with the similar but not identical problem, turned back to this sheet, and rapidly noted on the back the necessary adjustments; it is a process which can be paralleled in a drawing in the Uffizi, for the same pair of altar-pieces.40 The drawings for the Passerini version are fewer and less informative. As has already been said, they are significantly only for those parts of the altar-piece which are considerably different; this in itself confirms the precedence of the Pan- ciatichi version. A case in point is the drawing in the Louvre for one of the praying putti above, so different in spirit to the robust standing putti in the other picture.41 Another more important drawing in the Uffizi (Fig. 5) is an unnoticed full- length drapery study for the apostle on the extreme left, who is completely changed between the two altar-pieces, though only partly in view in each case;42 every detail of the drapery-forms of this drawing reappears in the fragment seen in the altar-piece; the head, of course, is that of a garzone. On the verso of this sheet is another study datable c. I526.43 Most important of all, however, is the sheet at Munich, at present attributed to Pontormo (Figs. i I, 13);44 on the recto is Sarto's action-study of a garzone in the pose of the S. Margherita, and on the verso are the studies for the hands of the apostle above and behind her, leaning on a staff - again a detail changed. The evidence of the drawings seems, therefore, to prove the precedence of the Assunta Panciatichi;45 it now remains to be seen whether this conclusion raises any difficulties in the 40 Uffizi 323f: the study on the verso is of a garzone in the pose of the Panciatichi Virgin; on the recto is a drapery-study for the lower part of the Passerini Virgin (repr. respectively, KNAPP [I928], Fig. 107, and FRAENCKEL, pl.xxiv, i). The drapery studies for the corresponding detail in the Panciatichi painting are on both sides of Uffizi 327f (repr. FRAENCKEL, pl.xxiv, ii, and KNAPP [I928], Fig. io6). One other drawing should be mentioned: Uffizi 643If. This was originally connected, by KNAPP [1907], with the left arm of St Thomas in No.225; by DI PIETRO, with the same detail in No.1I9 (p.89), followed by FRAENCKEL (Old Master Drawings [June 1934], p.io, n.2: 'much more developed style . . . does definitely connect with that composition'). This drawing, however, is datable 1514-I5; it is a preliminary study for the sleeve of the Madonna di Porta a Pinti. 41 No. 692; first identified with No.225 by BERENSON [I1903], No.153: note that in this edition the gallery numbers of the two Assunta are reversed. The study on the recto (BERENSON [1938], Fig. 9oo) is fairly close to the angel on the left, but there is a closer connexion between the drawing on the verso (the recto study traced through - visible in a strong light, although stuck down) and the angel to the right. 42 No.3I9f r.; connected by KNAPP [1907] and DI PIETRO (p.47) with the Gam- bassi Madonna (Pitti 307); by KNAPP in the second edition [1928], p. I I6, with the Scalzo Feast of Herod; BERENSON [I903] and [1938], No.i 5r., without identification. Rejected by FRAENCKEL, p. I89. A strip at the bottom (including the feet) has been added by a clever restorer. 43 Described by FRAENCKEL, p. I89, as a rapid sketch corresponding to the recto; it is in fact quite dissimilar, and is an action-study, a garzone in the pose of the S. Onofrio of the Gambassi altar (DI PIETRO, p.47); the additional sketch is the work of the restorer. Photograph: Gernsheim 7926. 44 No. I 1123 (BERENSON [I1938], No.2256B); the traditional attribution to Sarto was rejected by BERENSON, who proposed the present one to Pontormo, with a date c.I 530. 45 The date C. 523 makes sense of another problem. A drawing at Besanon (No.2278) is a copy, I believe, after the lost Visitation lunette painted at Luco in I523-4 (see VASARI, ed. MILANESI, V, p.39); to the right of this composition stands Zacharias, identical in the position of his hands and in most details of his drapery to the right-hand apostle in Assunta ig9 (and unlike this apostle in the other version). Most of this Visitation composition was repeated in the Scalzo fresco of the same subject immediately after the Luco journey, but the Zacharias is there completely changed. This sequence cannot be explained satisfactorily if the Assunta igi is dated c.1530. stylistic sense, or whether, on the contrary, the situation is clarified.46 In the first place - since one must be a modification of the other - one of the two should appear more organically con- ceived, while the other could show signs of the modification; this is surely the case. If we allow the precedence of Assunta igi (Fig.2), and only then, it is easy to understand the process by which two of the apostles in Assunta 225 (Fig.3) become displaced by the foreground saints and appear as clear inser- tions into the row of apostles behind to the left: in this position they have no comprehensible, a priori role in the figure-composition, but are, simply, displacements. The re- versal of this process is inconceivable. One difference that is particularly striking is the greater exploitation of the axis of depth in the Panciatichi version; this is largely a matter of changed systems of lighting, though it is also intimately bound up with the change in St Thomas's gesture. The lighting of the Passerini version is that of a dark space lit transversally, but with diminishing strength in the deeper strata: a convention first realized by Leonardo for the intensification of rilievo, and that is precisely the function it has here; it is a convention which naturally found favour for many mannerist altar-pieces. The Panciatichi ver- sion, on the other hand, shows the firm shaping of space itself which is characteristic of a rather brief period of Sarto's activity from, roughly, the Scalzo Imprisonment of the Baptist (1517) until the Pitti Pietd (1524); the Tribute to Caesar fresco at Poggio a Caiano (I521) is perhaps the most far-reaching example. But there is a second important aspect of the lighting-in-depth of this version: the dramatic shadow cast by the clouds of the upper group on the deeper figures of the lower group, which intensifies both the emotional and the spatial content. In Assunta 225 both these effects are significantly diminished. The compositional changes are bound to be influenced to a certain extent by the more complex iconography of Assunta 225; the unity of action is complicated by the intro- duction of SS. Margherita and Nicolas, and they are no doubt partly responsible for the greater formality, as of a sacra conversazione, of this version. But the drama is stilled to such an extent that this is surely more than a minor change of subject, and is in part a change of style. If one analyses carefully the surface-composition of Assunta ig9, for example, one finds that it is a balance of unstable, conflicting patterns. The main axis, like a spine to the whole picture, is a contin- uous twisting line between St Thomas and the Virgin, in- clined to the left; this inclination, and its echoes, are opposed by patterns inclined to the right: for example the broad arrow formed below by the book and the herm, and the edges of drapery to either side, or the angel with the tablet above 46 I should perhaps state that this enquiry was prompted in the first place by stylistic considerations, and in particular by colour-analysis, and it was only after my conviction that the conventional dating was stylistically impossible that I turned to examine the other evidence. I should also state at this point my conviction that studio assistance plays no significant part in either altar- piece; the quality of execution seems to me uniformly high (so far as one may judge in view of the poor condition of both versions) and workshop intervention cannot be held responsible for the difference of style (cf. Fig.i); for different assessments, see VENTURI: Storia IX, i, p.599, and FRAENCKEL, pp.226, 230. Finally, it would have been possible to argue further about the dating of the altar-pieces on the basis of the style of their respective drawings; this, I am convinced, produces the same results, but it seemed wisest to exclude this method of approach in view of the lack of any general agreement about the development of Sarto's drawing style. I33</page><page sequence="11">ANDREA DEL SARTO S TWO PAINTINGS OF THE ASSUMPTION to the right. The sense of movement inherent in these opposed inclinations, and especially in the unified twist in the main axis, sets the whole tone of the picture: tense and energetic. Looking then at the Passerini version, one finds that this movement is absent; the axial twist is discontinued, and the movement along it halted. The opposed linear patterns are resolved into a single pattern: a stable, nearly symmetrical pyramid of the three main figures below is complemented by an inverted pyramid above,47 and the conflicting directions are now stabilized in a carefully triangulated surface-pattern (compare, for example, the relation of the lower silhouette of St Margherita's veil to St Thomas's left arm, and the 'V' below in the symmetrically-inclined drapery-edges of SS. Nicholas and Thomas). The same basic change is visible also in the colour- composition; in the first, the greatest intensity of colour lies concentrated precisely on the main axis, the field of greatest emotional tension, in the repeated blues and reds of St Thomas and the Virgin. In the second, the colour-intensities have become dispersed above and below, so as to embrace the whole of the two main pyramids, and to include also the other apostles. The change in the figure-style is sympathetic to these. In Assunta Igi, gestures and poses are transient, open, incom- plete; in Assunta 225, they are closed, and the tensions are resolved: the movements are completed, so that what re- mains is the outward sign of movement - torsion - without the impulse. The excited, turning apostle kneeling to the left in the first, becomes the relaxed, stable St Nicholas in the second, just as the taut gesture of St Thomas comes to rest, finally, in a pose almost excessively beautiful: the latent figura serpentinata. Similarly, the 'types' change from coarse, contadino natural- ism (with sharp differentiation one from another) to refined, elegant, almost polished idealism. The difference between the extreme right-hand heads in each row of apostles, is only a particularly arresting example of a difference that is general. The transformation of St Peter is identical: the sun- burnt, white-haired head on the left of the Panciatichi ver- sion is unmistakably the same as the St Peter in the Last Supper in S. Salvi; the comparison between these two works can be extended to include the whole group of apostles 47 The virtual elimination of the inclined axis is exemplified in the slight but significant change in the axis of the putto below the Virgin. (without haloes) in each case.48 Between the angels above in the two Assunta there is a difference of the same kind; the robust, lively putti of the first turn into a new type in the second: sweeter, and altogether more angelic. The nature of the change of style may be rather crudely summarized as the change from a concept of energy, vivezza, and tension, to one of grazia and maniera.49 It is of course relative; the Panciatichi Assunta does not mark the most 'proto-baroque' moment in Sarto's career, nor is the Passer- ini Assunta the most refined and emotionally cold of the later altar-pieces. Vasari, describing the change of style (to which he was a witness) in the last of the Scalzo frescoes, the Birth of the Baptist of 1526, characterized it thus: 'figure piu belle ..., maggior rilievo, e piu grazia . .'50 The Birth of the Baptist is indeed in the same stylistic phase as the Assunta Passerini. There can be little doubt of the direction of the stylistic development between the two versions; that direction only makes sense if the Panciatichi version is the earlier, and is dated in the early '2o's, for in that case the development may be compared quite precisely to that between the Scalzo frescoes from the Dance of Salome to the Birth of the Baptist. The realization that the Assunta Panciatichi, on all the evi- dence, is to be dated so much earlier than is usually admitted inevitably enhances its historical position in Florentine cinquecento painting, and - perhaps more important - clari- fies an obscure phase in Sarto's own development. It is on the one hand one of the two or three most distinguished altar- pieces produced in Florence in the third decade, and a fitting summary of the quarter-century before Florence embarked upon Mannerism; and on the other hand it is one of a brief sequence of heroic works (among them the Tribute to Caesar, and the S. Salvi Last Supper), painted just after the return from France in a period when Sarto brought to full maturity, with complete confidence, the style which already in its immaturity had done so much to set the course of Florentine painting. 48 Compare also the apostle on the left, looking into the tomb, with the crouch- ing figure on the steps of the Poggio a Caiano fresco (152I). 49 For the sense in which this term is used here, cf. especially G. WEISE: 'La doppia origine del concetto di Manierismo', Studi Vasariani, Florence [I952], pp. 8i ff. 50 I550 ed., p.763; Vasari was naturally enthusiastic about this later style, and associated it with a knowledge of Michelangelo's new style in the Sagrestia Nuova: 'Andrea ... aveva ringrandito la maniera per aver visto le figure, che Michel'agnol' Buon'arroti aveva cominciate et parte finite per la sagrestia di San Lorenzo . . .'
