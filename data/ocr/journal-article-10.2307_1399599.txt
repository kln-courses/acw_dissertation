Although theoretically following Needham on this score, Peerenboom (p. 121) nevertheless twists history around by believing that an impersonal rather than an anthropomorphic heaven is a fertile ground for a theory of natural law. 25 - For different translations of ji (extreme/pole), see my dissertation, pp. 351-352; and Vitaly Rubin, "The Concepts of Wu-Hsing and Yin- Yang," Journal of Chinese Philosophy 9, no. 2 (1982): 153 n. 36. In expressions such as siji and baji, it is difficult to stick to 'pole'.

R. P. Peerenboom Practicing Attorney Honolulu, Hawaii Philosophy East &amp; West The Rational American and the Inscrutable Oriental as Seen from the Perspective of a Puzzled European: A Review (and Response) in Three Stereotypes-A Reply to Carine Defoort I must begin by thanking Carine Defoort for an absolutely delightful, insightful, and thought-provoking review, a review that runs the gamut from excessive and overstated praise for the clarity of the presentation to, somewhat paradoxically, serious charges alleging recklessness (or at least gross negligence) with respect to my explication of (or at least "attitude" toward) the text itself. According to Defoort, I have explained with unusual clarity the wrong text! Oh dear. How could this have happened? Apparently, by failing to take some of her preferred meta- phors seriously; by not translating or interpreting the metaphors I do take seriously according to her, rather than my, reading of the text; and, most importantly, by preferring a clear interpretation of the text to a "puzzled" one. To be sure, if Defoort is right in her reading of the text (context and texture included), then I have indeed not taken sufficiently seriously certain metaphors and have misinterpreted and, as a result, mistranslated many others. In particular, I would be mistaken at least with respect to one central issue: the transcendence of tian. Such a mistake would 368</page><page sequence="2">diminish to a considerable extent (but not eradicate) the philosophical novelty of the Boshu, particularly with respect to epistemology, language, and jurisprudence, although the implications for the interpretation of Huang-Lao social and political philosophy would be less severe. Accord- ingly, our disagreement is important, and somewhat more than "in- finitesimal," as Defoort charitably characterizes it. Nevertheless, one should not overstate the differences, even on the single issue of Huang- Lao's view of nature. Defoort does agree that nature for Huang-Lao is impersonal, constant, rule-governed, and normatively prior to man.' That in itself would be sufficient to distinguish Huang-Lao from many contem- porary schools, and to support much, though not all, of the social and political philosophy I attribute to it.2 Having clarified what is at stake in the dispute over the nature of tian, I must now point out at least one other possible resolution to our disagreement: I am right, and Defoort has not taken seriously the meta- phors and reading I suggest.3 Having made my case at length in the book, I leave the substantive issue of the transcendence of tian to the readers to decide, and turn instead to the methodological concerns that lie at the heart of her review. I. Through a Text Darkly Defoort repeatedly (dare I say "obstinately"?) objects to my "obsti- nate quest for clarity." At the risk of proving her point, I would like to begin to sort out this criticism, if that is what it is, by first establishing common ground. I suspect we agree that wisdom lies in knowing what one can and cannot be clear about: to pursue clarity where it cannot be had is folly. I also suspect Defoort would agree that the author of the Boshu, like all authors, is clear on some points and unclear on others. Surely this is not exceptional. Nor is it exceptional that someone else, standing a certain distance from the author's work, can see clearly what the author herself perceives only dimly. Indeed, one of the few advantages of being "a foreigner" is that one is sometimes able to perceive things that one immersed in the culture cannot see: we all have our blind spots, as it were. Even less surprising is that we are now able to make certain distinctions and readily spot certain ambiguities that escaped those who came before us. After all, one would hope centuries of learning are of some value in this regard. To be sure, temporal and cultural distance may equally blind us to crucial distinctions. One must be sensitive to the text and cultural context. But the ever-present danger of cultural imperialism does not give us license to impute to Chinese authors an unclear position when a clear reading of the text is available. While it would be wrong to read into the text clarity where there is only confusion, it would be equally wrong to present clear ideas as muddled. R. P. Peerenboom 369</page><page sequence="3">Philosophy East &amp; West What, then, worries Defoort about my "quest for clarity" and "relent- less pursuit of clear criteria"? For starters, she apparently finds the author much more "puzzling" than I do (though I, too, would find him at least as puzzling as, if not more puzzling than, Defoort were I to read him as she does).4 More importantly, however, she wishes to celebrate the puzzling and ambiguous character of the text, or at least what is puzzling and ambiguous on her reading of it. Here it is important to distinguish between the ideas in the original text, the interpretation (or reading) of the text, the translation of the text, and the explication (or presentation) of the ideas and interpretation. I would argue-and I suspect Defoort would agree-that as a general rule the explication of the author's position should be clear, not muddled, even if the original ideas are confused or confusing.5 That is, as a scholar of intellectual history, it is one's duty to state clearly the author's posi- tion,6 including what is puzzling about his position, which ideas seem confused, and why.7 While I think Defoort would agree with me on the need for clarity in explication, she clearly disagrees with respect to translation. I sought to provide clear translations that both read well and remained faithful to the original text by choosing from the range of meanings of a given term the one most appropriate in the context. Ironically, I was all too successful to suit Defoort's tastes. My translations, "although elegant [and] fluently English in language and thought," do not reveal "illegitimate jumps" on the part of the author (though, again, whether the author made illegiti- mate jumps depends on how one interprets the text and one's own philosophical beliefs). Defoort, for her part, would highlight the ambiguity of the Chinese term.8 But this is largely a matter of personal preference. As she rightly points out, translators face several mutually exclusive alternatives, none of which is completely satisfactory. One can simply transliterate a term. The problems with this approach are several. First, it is of little use to the reader who knows no Chinese. At some point, the author must explain the term and its meaning or range of meaning. The reader is then left to guess what the appropriate meaning should be. A second shortcoming of this approach is that too many transliterated terms make the text confusing, particularly for the reader who does not know Chinese and who cannot remember the difference between ji, li, bi, ci, and so on-not to mention ji*, ji2, ji3, or jin. An alternative approach is to provide one English "equivalent." Because the English equivalent will make no sense in many contexts, this method forces the reader to confront the various meanings of the original term. The drawback, obvi- ously, is that it is hard sledding for the reader, who still must select from a range of possible meanings suggested by the translator/interpreter (or think up, on her own, new meanings, presumably, not having read the whole text and perhaps not knowing any Chinese, based on the few 370</page><page sequence="4">passages selected and translated by the translator). A third method is for the translator/interpreter to select from the range of possible meanings (explained beforehand) the most appropriate one, as I did for the Boshu. The disadvantage of this is that the unalert reader may forget the various meanings and fail to appreciate that a single Chinese word is being used in a variety of ways. But this deficiency can be partially remedied by including the Chinese character or pinyin along with the chosen transla- tion where necessary, as I often did. In short, the main force of Defoort's objection does not seem to be directed at either the clarity of my explication or even my approach to translation. Rather, her real target is the way in which the interpretation seems to gloss over incoherencies and ambiguities in the work itself Apparently, my ardent quest for a clear reading of the text blinded me to the correct interpretation (on Defoort's view, hers), caused me to ignore some metaphors while mistranslating others, and led me to draw mis- taken distinctions while failing to note other distinctions.9 Of course, whether I have indeed been led astray or have accurately interpreted the text will depend on one's reading. For instance, whether I "equivocate where the text distinguishes" depends on whether the author does indeed use dao and tian (tiandao, tian zhi dao, tiandi zhi dao, tiandi zhi heng dao) in the same way, at least in some instances.'0 Similarly, whether I "introduced" a fundamental distinction-the notion of transcendence-depends on how one reads the text and context. Finally, as Defoort rightly points out, I did use metaphors of correspon- dence, naturalism, and foundationalism to translate certain key meta- phors, terms, and concepts in the text. But I didn't simply pick these particular renderings out of a hat. I provide explanations for the English equivalents, including the few terms Defoort explicitly questions, such as li (principle), fa (law), ming (determinant conditions), tian, and tian ji (limits of natural order, pole star). To be sure, these renderings reflect my interpretation of the text. But what would one expect? I would have been seriously remiss had I employed philosophical vocabulary inconsistent with my reading." II. Reverse Cultural Imperialism: Or, If You Eat with Chopsticks You Must Think Differently'2 What troubles me most about Defoort's review is not that she ob- jects to my reading of the text but the nature of the argument against it. In going after the "texture" rather than the text or context she attempts to circumvent the need to address systematically the substantive argu- ments for my reading by raising the specter of cultural imperialism (though, I would suggest, to do so is itself a kind of reverse cultural imperialism).13 She does so in two ways. First, what is wrong with my interpretation of the text is that it is too clear: no Chinese thinker could R. P. Peerenboom 371</page><page sequence="5">be that clear. As she puts it, "one may have reservations about this Cartesian demand for perfect clarity and strictly demarcated definitive criteria" because "a certain degree of obscurity has probably always characterized the category 'Huang-Lao'." Even assuming that the cate- gory Huang-Lao has been obscure, must it always remain so? Must then this particular text also remain obscure? If so, why? Simply because Chinese cannot think as clearly as we Westerners? (And is this what Defoort means when she insists that "the author of the Boshu [must be] taken somewhat more seriously"?) Or is it more a problem of interpreta- tion, of getting those "inscrutable Orientals" right? I would think a better explanation for the lack of understanding that has surrounded Huang-Lao is that all texts from the school were lost for most of the last two millennia. Now that we have a text, we should at least see if a clear understanding of that text is possible. There is no reason, in my view, to assume a priori that the author is incoherent, muddle-headed, or excessively puzzling simply because he is Chinese, or even a Qin-to-Han dynasty Chinese. To make such an assumption is to give up hope of understanding the text without even making an effort; it simply erects a roadblock on the path of inquiry.14 I also stand accused of a second form of cultural imperialism: impos- ing alien (but clear!) concepts such as transcendence on the text; dismis- sing certain metaphors, misconstruing others; introducing fundamental distinctions not present in the text; and so forth. Of course, all this may be true. Again the point is not to dispute the substance of the charge but to challenge the way it serves as a surrogate for systematic engagement with my arguments.15 Having accused me of not taking metaphor seri- ously and imposing Western dualistic thinking on the text, there is noth- ing more for Defoort to do but announce her conclusion: "Not only is the dualistic world view that goes with the dichotomy that Peerenboom introduces absent in the Boshu, but also are its 'Western' implications: laws of nature and natural law." But this begs the hermeneutic question: whether natural law is present in the text depends on the proper interpre- tation. I have given my reasons for interpreting it the way I did. Now Defoort must come up with an alternative reading, or at least an explana- tion why my reading cannot be right. With respect to the former, she admits that, as of yet, neither she nor any one else has presented a fully explicated alternative.16 With respect to the latter, her main objection to my reading is that it makes Huang- Lao unique within the intellectual tradition of China. But that is precisely my claim, and what I labored to demonstrate. Not only did I present textual evidence that Huang-Lao ought to be interpreted that way, but I also offered several reasons why Huang-Lao would develop as it does. Indeed, the majority of the book was dedicated to demonstrating that Philosophy East &amp; West Huang-Lao developed a unique philosophy in response to the shortcom- 372</page><page sequence="6">ings of existing philosophies. In so doing, the author created a new kind of philosophy that, at least with respect to the issue of transcendence, differed in kind from Chinese philosophies that existed at the time. Of course it still retained many features characteristic of these other philoso- phies-characteristics that readily and radically distinguish it from its closest counterparts in the West. Thus I would take issue with Defoort's overly simplifying conclusion that "we are presented with a Chinese variant of traditional mainstream Western thought."17 But such quibbles aside, my main objection to Defoort's critique is that it is itself a kind of reverse cultural imperialism, relying on the assumption that Chinese could never be so clever as to come up with similar solutions to similar problems as their Western counterparts.'8 The poor Chinese are trapped in their own world views; unable to change, they are doomed to an endless round of totalitarian governments and despotic rulers who prefer rule of man to rule of law. Not only can they not make the sociopolitical, legal, and institutional change to a different system, they cannot even conceive it. Only clever Westerners could devise such an ingenious system as rule of law, or believe that the normative and natural order may be something determined indepen- dently of humans. To be sure, if one thinks transcendence of the type I attribute to the Boshu so unusual a response within the Chinese context to the problems confronting them, then one will be less likely to favor my reading. But if one thinks that such an idea is within the intellectual capacity of a Chinese (and I provide other examples of contemporaneous thinkers such as Zou Yan, the authors of parts of the Guan Zi and He Guan Zi who shared similar ideas),'9 then my reading may seem more likely, particu- larly when combined with the textual and contextual evidence. If so, then my choice and translation of metaphors, distinctions, and categories, far from being the mistaken imposition of an alien conceptual framework, will be entirely appropriate and necessary to bring out the full meaning of the Boshu. To translate the terms as appropriate in other texts would be to diminish the author's importance as a unique thinker in order to maintain at all costs our preconceptions about "Chinese philosophy." Again, I may be utterly wrong. But I think the reader owes it to herself to approach the text (mine and the author's) with a sufficiently open mind at least to entertain the possibility that a Chinese philosopher might have, for better or worse,20 conceived of something we Westerners find so obvious that we take it for granted. Notes 1 - Defoort even goes so far as to allow that the Boshu is an "admittedly marginal expression of 'immanent' order," on the cusp of, but not R. P. Peerenboom 373</page><page sequence="7">quite falling into, that black zone of transcendence, which differs in kind from all Chinese thought. It is in this sense that the disagreement is infinitesimal. 2 - It would, for example, still be a type of natural law-at least if Defoort means by "normatively prior" what I mean. 3- Alternatively, we are both wrong, or partially wrong and partially right, although this Solomonic solution may not be possible with respect to the discrete and central issue of the nature, and possible transcendence, of tian. Two separate issues are (1) whether any reading of any text can be right (or wrong) and (2) if so, whether one could ever prove my or Defoort's reading right. With respect to the latter, I most definitely do not want to claim my interpretation to be the only possible reading of the text. At the moment, however, it does strike me as the most plausible of those available, though Defoort's reading, at this point only partially fleshed out, appears to show considerable promise. (As I note below, careful consideration of the metaphors I do take seri- ously caused me to reject such a reading.) In any event, whether ultimately she could muster enough textual and contextual evi- dence (to be distinguished from her "textural" critique of my position) to show the superiority of her reading is hard to say. The text and context may simply underdetermine the issue. 4- One gets the impression from Defoort that nothing about the text puzzles or has ever puzzled me. Far from it. But I did not think the average reader would be terribly interested in all of the half- baked thoughts, missteps, and deadends I encountered along the way, or in all of the unclear and indistinct ideas I still have floating around in my head. In any event, having pondered the puzzles for several years, I came to see a reading that allowed the text to make sense rather than nonsense (or, if you prefer, I saw a way to make sense of the text). At that point, I sat down and wrote-I hope clearly. 5 - There may be instances where one deliberately presents the material in a confused light even though the material itself is clear. Perhaps one wants to stimulate the reader to think for herself, for example. Or perhaps one is a prisoner of war and wants to thwart the efforts of one's captors through disinformation and obfuscation. Needless to say, these were not my intentions. 6- Alternatively, one might be interested in using the text as a spring- Philosophy East &amp; West board for creative philosophical ideas. If so, one might prefer a strong 374</page><page sequence="8">misreading of the text. What would be important would not be that one got the text "right," but that the ideas one put forward were of interest in their own right, regardless of the source. 7 - I certainly did not intend to sweep under the carpet certain puzzling aspects of the Boshu. Nor, however, was I inclined to simply throw my hands up in the air whenever something seemed a little odd. Rather, I attempted to understand how the author could hold all of the views he appeared to hold on my reading. Some apparent incon- sistencies could be explained (or, if one shares Defoort's reading, explained away). But as is the case with most if not all authors, some ideas appeared to remain inconsistent. I then attempted to explain why the author might not have perceived such an inconsistency. Still, some inconsistencies remain. But if I understand Defoort cor- rectly, it is not so much that she thinks her interpretation will resolve more inconsistencies. Rather, one should simply expect such inconsistences from Chinese philosophers and learn to appreciate them. In my view, however, the ability of my (or any) interpretation to make sense of the text is a virtue rather than a vice, an argument in favor of rather than against the interpretation. Of course, the author of the Boshu could have set out to obfuscate and puzzle, but there is no evidence to support such a speculation. 8 - To what extent she would pursue ambiguity and how exactly she would do this are not fully spelled out. She seems to prefer some middle ground between freely using the full range of English equiva- lents and obstinately sticking to a single word, be it English or simply a transliteration. She does not reveal her criteria for determining which words in what circumstances call for ambiguity and which call for clarity-though this perhaps is due to the space limitations of the review. 9 - Underlying this quest for certainty, I am told, is a bad attitude. Where the venerable Angus Graham is intrigued and puzzled by the incon- sistencies, the linguistic overlaps, and apparent equivocations of the author, I simply struggle to cure the poor bloke, and having dis- covered a way to resolve the conflicts, "grant him his best 'clear and distinct' argument." Actually, I think there is more than a kernel of truth to this characterization (of both of us). But I would add two qualifications. First, Defoort seems in this instance to have her own clear and distinct categories: either one is rational and clear or intrigued and puzzled. But surely it is a matter of degree. Second, and relatedly, neither approach will do by itself. In the end, what combi- nation is most effective will vary by text and by person. R. P. Peerenboom 375</page><page sequence="9">10 - I never claimed, or intended to claim, that the author never used the terms differently. Nor do I disagree with much of what Defoort says about tian, either in the Boshu or in other texts. 11 - A further distinction is necessary here. In explicating my interpreta- tion, I often used metaphors consistent with my philosophical read- ing that did not appear in the text. But when translating the text, I tried to use metaphors that reflected the philosophy of the text (on my reading) and at the same time remained true to the metaphor in the text: for example, I did not use "mirror" images to translate a word such as dang (translated as hitting the mark, correspond). 12 - I owe the phrase to R. Randle Edwards. 13 - This is not to impute an ill motive. Were I to write my own review, I, too, would focus precisely on this issue of transcendence, as it is the most controversial issue of significance. Further, Defoort's reading is a natural one, one that first occurred to me as well, though ultimately I rejected it in favor of transcendence for the reasons given in the book. But were I to maintain a nontranscendence reading, I, too, would focus my critique on the texture rather than the text and context, as to critique the latter would require a fully articulated exposition of the counterposition of nontranscendence-in short, a book rather than a review. Finally, I believe Defoort has accurately identified the relevant fibers of the texture to pull out for closer examination. Indeed, her review is quite persuasive. However, I be- lieve that much of the persuasiveness is due to the implicit assump- tion that Chinese cannot think either clearly or like us, as I explain below; and second, by the overuse of the rhetoric of bafflement, shock, and surprise, which gives one the impression that my interpre- tation is wholly implausible, simply based on Defoort's (professed) emo- tive reactions to it. But most of what Defoort finds baffling, shock- ing, surprising, puzzling, intriguing, remarkable, paradoxical, and curious is readily explicable: I read the text differently than she does. 14 - To be sure, being too quick to put the text in familiar categories-be they Western categories of transcendence or traditional Chinese categories of immanence-equally thwarts understanding. 15- To be sure, my response to Defoort is of the same character. Put (somewhat too) starkly, where she accuses me of being the rational Anglo who, in failing to take metaphor seriously, imposes clear and distinct order on the Chinese, I turn the tables, accusing her of being the European/continental philosopher who, by overly relying on the ambiguity and openness of metaphor at the expense of clear argu- Philosophy East &amp; West ment and exegesis, not only fails to give the author his best reading 376</page><page sequence="10">but continues to play into the stereotype of the inscrutable Oriental. The danger here is that what is passing for argument may be nothing more than appeal to preconceptions and stereotypes: the Rational American oblivious to metaphor; the context- and metaphor-sensi- tive European whose arguments lack philosophical rigor; the Inscru- table Oriental. In my defense, I offer two explanations. First, I have provided substantive arguments for my position in the book, and have little to add. Second, there is but little choice. Taking the form that it does, Defoort's textural criticism compels a response in similar terms. Her argument hinges on the assumption that Chinese could not possibly think the way I say the author does (i.e., similar, but not identical, to the way some Westerners think). Having provided the textual and contextual reasons why I think at least one Chinese philosopher, the author of the Boshu, did think that way (actually, I also argue that others had similar ideas), I have only two choices. I can abandon my reading and agree that no Chinese could think such things; or, I can maintain that just maybe some Chinese could think that way. In the absence of a more fully developed textual and contextual argument to the contrary, I am not yet willing to abandon so readily my reading, and thus must opt for the latter. I would, however, like to address one powerful point: if the author meant transcendence, why didn't he just say it? Of course, I think he did, using the terms he had available. Why didn't he invent new words? An observation of Defoort provides one reason. Whereas Western authors and artists emphasize the novelty of their work, Chinese authors and artists historically have tended to celebrate continuity with tradition. Thus even major conceptual innovations are cloaked in the traditional vocabulary of dao, tian, de, fa, ren, yi, and so forth. In short, many authors use identical terms to mean radically different things. That is what I meant by linguistic overlap. 16 - This is not to say she or someone else will not present a better view. Her partial reading may seem (as it once seemed to me) plausible and promising. Of course, she will have to take more seriously and give a fuller account of the textual metaphors that indicate, in my view, transcendence; metaphors such as cheng yi quan heng, can yi tian dang, zhong tian li, shun si shi, xun tian chang, yin tian, yin tian shi, yin shi, jin tian ji, shun dao, zhi dao, shun li, cha ming li, bei tian zhi dao, shi li, ni li, ni xing, du, cheng, zheng, etc. See chapter 2. These metaphors were largely responsible for my adopting a reading of transcendence, an interpretation I knew would give rise to a conser- vative backlash by those wanting to read the text as safely within what has hitherto been understood as "the Chinese tradition." R. P. Peerenboom 377</page><page sequence="11">Philosophy East &amp; West 17- Indeed, Huang-Lao even differs, on my view, from most Western theories of transcendence. Not only did I explain how it differed in chapter 2, but I also explained how this difference still allowed one to understand Huang-Lao naturalism as a kind of organicism and a variant of the traditional notion of tianren heyi. See pp. 31-32, 37-38, 292-293 n. 1, 295 n. 23. Ironically, Defoort objects to my attempt to apply such traditional labels to Huang-Lao. Enforcing her own cultural dichotomies, she insists that East is East and West and West: if a theory is transcendent, even qualified in the way I qualify the Huang- Lao position, it must belong to the West, and that is that. To try to conceive of Chinese transcendence is simply "incoherent," a cate- gory mistake, as it were. Interestingly, while Westerners are able to conceive of organicisms and immanent naturalisms, to think correla- tively, and to understand Chinese texts from the Analects to the Daode Jing to the Boshu, Chinese are, apparently, not even capable of conceiving the Western alternatives, much less appreciating, understanding, or desiring them. 18- Defoort finds it baffling that I would attribute to the author of the Boshu, a Chinese philosopher who appears to have spent a good deal of time thinking about nature, heaven, and the way, a distinction so common to us that we find it hard to think any other way-a distinction, moreover, that the author of the He Guan Zi also makes, as Defoort points out. 19 - Again, in focusing on the texture of my argument, Defoort pays short shrift to the substance, and in particular to the argument, for my reading based on context. The author of the Boshu may have written a unique philosophical work, but he did so-as I attempt to demon- strate in chapters 4 to 7 and in the Appendix-by responding to his philosophical and cultural context and by drawing on the ideas of various thinkers. Defoort's counterarguments consist of (1) a demon- stration that some others did not think the same way as the author of the Boshu; (2) the use of one, all-purpose "Chinese" metaphor, tianji, explained not by reference to its occurrence in specific pas- sages of the Boshu (or indeed specific passages from any text) but rather by appeal to what we all (should) know about Chinese philoso- phy; and (3) an expression of surprise that I would read the context differently than she does. With respect to the first, of course others think differently-that is my point; that is why Huang-Lao is special. As for the second, even were Defoort to provide textual evidence, which she no doubt could, that would only show that others thought differently, which is her first point. As for the third, I have explained how the Boshu fits the context, specifically, how it is one step in the process of naturalization of the law and the development of the kind 378</page><page sequence="12">of interactive correlative cosmologies advocated by Dong Zhongshu that provide the theoretical basis for many Han immortality prac- tices. Further (and ironically), that Huang-Lao differs as much as it does from the mainstream explains what Defoort finds so surprising and puzzling: that the author of the Boshu (along with a couple of others, most notably Zou Yan) "generates a separation between humans and the cosmological source of order which had yet to be thought of and which was immediately overcome after him." 20 - One of the several ironies here is that whereas many authors err by reading their favorite theory into a text, I stand accused of reading into the text theories of transcendence and natural law that I not only find suspect philosophically but that are at odds with my reading of much of the Chinese tradition. Obscurity about Clarity-A Reply to R. P. Peerenboom R. P. Peerenboom's response to my review, just like his book, is character- ized by a remarkable clarity of mind, a characteristic which I truly admire and appreciate, as opposed to what the author seems to have under- stood from my review: "Defoort repeatedly (dare I say 'obstinately'?) objects to my 'obstinate quest for clarity'." The main thrust of my critique is described by Peerenboom as a wholesale objection to the ideal of clarity, not only in his translations and interpretation, which I would find "too clear," but also in the original text. Over and over, Peerenboom interprets my comments as if attributing obscurity to the Oriental mind, claiming "that the Chinese cannot think clearly," that the author of the Boshu is "incoherent, muddleheaded, or excessively puzzling simply because he is Chinese," and that he would even have consciously "set out to obfuscate and puzzle." One can imagine my surprise at such an understanding of my review, convinced as I was that this is exactly the approach that I had detected in Peerenboom's work and tried to argue against. The reason why Peerenboom lumps almost all of my criticism to- gether as an emotional 'European' reaction against 'Anglo-Saxon' reason by resorting to the cliched depiction of the Chinese author as an 'inscru- table Oriental' is, I believe, his failure to distinguish between the value of clarity and its various possible types. I have definitely never expressed reservations against clarity as such. Needless to say, I am all in favor of it. But my attempts to convince Peerenboom of another, possibly more interesting type of clarity are all (mis)represented as a personal preference for puzzlement, obscurity, and ambiguity-in short, as a wholesale attack on clarity tout court.
