<plain_text><page sequence="1">189 A Letter to the Editor Adveniat tuum regnum. Editor: What I like, what I respect most in Ulbandusis its candor, its frankness. Your journal's shameless disregard for decorum is truly inspirational. The applicability of post-colonial theory, eh? Such hubris, such megalomania! I may not have been invited to contribute, no, but these accursed questions, this exquisitely heterogeneous space now awkwardly stretched under the aegis of Slavism?it's kept me up nights running. Well, you might accept my unsolicited ramblings?though I tell you I write them only to spite myself. I'll begin, anyhow, breathless and irksome as I have always been, and forgive me if the thread runs thin at times. So, we go out in search of mirrors, in search of an other that may se credy reflect the dark cruelty in our own hearts. And what is our response, the enlightened answer we export? Exterminate the brutes: a projection of suicidal desires. But what (I might ask) if the reflection does more than externalize the flaws of Man? What if the mirror is also a gesture, an at tempt at communication, the beginnings of a new language? Naturally it will appear cruel?the creative spasms of some imperfect god. Language, contact, is active memory, a memory distorted in the retelling. We speak, we intervene, we encode ourselves. Half-remembered patterns pulsate until the self is no more than gesture, offering, sacrifice. Certainly, you are right, the nation is an uneasy hybrid, a swirling perplexity of daily performance and audience that resists the linear histories of pedagogical narration. And, yes, every actor, every heckler must find, test, suffer this site of contact in mirror and memory. All these things are plain as day. Listen, what uncanny drives are we surest of, drives beyond the base, elegiac triumph of love over death? The compulsion of the "I" to repeat the traumas of the "I-of-the-other"? Do you remember your neo-Kantian past? The widow repeats her husband's consumption in funereal flames and the revolutionary repeats the suicide pact. Each knows her displacement, her variation on the theme. From ashes emerges the beautifully patterned chaos of the communicative act and the false memories it transmits. And, again, you are right, if speech can only come in the form of suicidal poli tics, it is hard to call it speech. But what (another might ask) if to speak in mirrors and the false memories of the other is not the repressed, eternal returning and eternally effaced? What, I say, if this speech we do not</page><page sequence="2">190 A Letter to the Editor recognize as such, in fact, signals a time of cruel miracles, a time of real, if excruciating contact? Almost the same, but not quite. A diabolical repetition with displacement does not simply tell us domination looms near. A mimetic gesture does not always travel the iron axis of power and desire. To approach a mirror as a mirror oneself, leaving an infinity of shifting, shimmering forms, each contorted with the chinks and crevices of incomplete being and incomplete knowledge of self. What, you might say, if this strange, perverse act of love reaches beyond the plangent, ritualized chants of elegiac mourning? Yes, we go out of ourselves to make room for the other, and is it not possible that in fact we have no interest whatsoever in the phenomenology of the spirit, the manifestation of self-consciousness as paradise regained? Is it not possible that the other's imperfect (even disastrous and cruel) reciprocity could signal a break in the logic of domination and suicidal responses to aggression? If only we could recognize this fact, this origin in imperfec tion, this image of life as a detour passed between mirrors of different shapes and reflective properties, a detour predicated on the economy of uncanny repetitions, if we could face this truth, then violence could never be planned and enacted as we see it planned and enacted today. The cataclysmic, elemental accidents that lie in wait for the evolutionary adventures of most fledgling languages would be enough to satisfy the cruel and tragic sensibilities of man. But perhaps I race ahead too quickly. From genocide through suicide to world peace in fifty lines. Well, that's theory for you. Have you noticed where I am coming from, though, what Broadway movie-house I've just left? Yes, I admit it, I paid my eight dollars to watch Soderbergh's Solaris. Do you know this text, the incredible vicissitudes of its translation, or should I say, "hybrid mimicry"? Lem's Polish novel in Russian translation is adapted with radical liberties by Tarkovsky, only to be remade by So derbergh, following the English translation from the French translation of the Polish! Harey is anagrammed into Rheya, Snaut becomes Snow, and screenplays meet the rough hands of critics and censors alike?under one regime attacking the text's religiosity and lack of patriotic optimism; under another excising the racy excesses of lines like "Why are we talking about this s..t when we could be Ling?"1 and making Sartorius a black woman for the sake of demographics! Of course, Tarkovsky had an audience to deal with, too, and what a typical story it was that his two male leads, 1 "Po co gadamy o tych bzd..ach zamiast si? pie...yc?"; "Pourquoi parlons-nous de cette m..de, alors que nous pourrions b...er."; "3aMeM ?e roBopHM BCK5 3Ty X..HK3. JTIotLIABC e...i?c?."</page><page sequence="3">Q 191 Kelvin and Snaut were respectively Lithuanian and Estonian, speaking Rus sian of course, though dubbed in the end to bury the accent. Consider also the director's remark that drayr should have been played in Estonian?"he could have been even more free, and therefore more vivid, more highly coloured''1?though still dubbed, of course, naturally he would have to be dubbed. In any case, what a glori ous play of mirrors, no? I hope you won't mind if I recall these variations on the theme. You won't walk out in protest, will you? In Lem's book, the oceanic planet, Solaris, is a dark, mysterious mass, Conrad's Congo. In a bitter parody of the follies of knowledge, human scientists 2 "Moglby bye nawet bardziej wolny i przez to, bardziej zywy, bardziej kolorowy."; "II n'en aurait que gagner en liberte, en vie et en couleur...."; "oh Mor 6m 6i?rn&gt; eme cboooahcc h noTOMy flpne, 6orane KpacKaMH_" struggle in vain for generations to adequately describe the activity of the ocean. Invariably, these representations are doomed to anthropomorphic fallacies and all knowledge of the globe is apophatic. The stated goal of solarystyki?Contact?appears in the most cynical passages as little more than a search for mirrors, mankind's search for itself in the farthest reaches of the cosmos. Like Romantic poets journeying into the Orient in pursuit of its mysteries, the scientists' mission expounds nothing but the darkness of their own souls. But still, they do find some mirrors, if not exacdy those they seek. These are "les mimoi'des" of Solaris, formations in the oceanic currents that can perfecdy synthesize any inorganic object they encounter. Beyond the external mhmohah, the ocean's mimetic urges are also cathected internally in the form of the symmetriads and their more</page><page sequence="4">192 A Letter to the Editor dramatic cousins, asymetriady. These consist of a form and its perfect or imperfect mirror?"the spatial analogue of some transcendental equation,"3 solved or not. But both collapse in violent convulsions of the oceanic surface, recalling a public massacre or an orgasmic frenzy. Deeper still are the reflections aboard the Station that orbits the planet itself?uncanny guests that come to the scientists, physically manifesting their deepest, most repressed memories, thoughts, fetishes. Do these creatures not tell of the ephemera of mimicry in their resurrections 3 "txojwyrniarowe rozwi ni^cie jakiegos rownania wyzszego rz?du"; "le developpement tridimensionnel de quelque equation transcendante"; "Tpex MepHaa moacab KaKoro to ypaBHeHHH Bwciuero nopHAKa." always filmed in reverse? Might they not indicate the possibility of contact? Shared vocabularies in the looking glass? It could be, no? Lem leaves the question open?what may be contact may also remain mere narcissism. And the same goes for the Freudian frame as the Ori entalist. The churning ocean recalls the unconscious, much as its gestures of contact are reproductions of repressed memories and thoughts. Here come die unheimlichen Doppelgahgerinen of deep space, coughed forth in the ocean's own repetition compulsion. The visitors cannot be extin guished without the equivalent of shock therapy, a negative neutrino field (gasp!). And in a last ditch hope to explain things to the ocean and stop the visitors, the scientists project an encephalogram of Kelvin's conscious self onto its surface, hoping Bto conjure some of that superego magic. KeAbBHH's melancholic thoughts of Harey give way to the image of his father or, even more sublime, Geise, the father of la solaristique. But Kelvin fi nally rejects sublimation and returns to melancholy (can anyone say Trauerspiel?), hopelessly fixated on the dead object of desire, Rheya.

He goes to the heart of the fantasy and uncovers a deeper, temporal encounter with the Alien/Autre. Yet still the mystery remains inchoate, a hint. Individuality is dissolved into abstraction; CoAHpnc knows no differentiation. The tragedy of two human beings does not impress. Redemption? Ha! Transparent, a sham. God is imperfect, evolving, sometimes even absent. But miracles of con tact and encounters with the cruelly unfamiliarized uncanny may still be possible. Yes, and there may even be a spot of time for the breach of the subject-object divide that curses man, a breach that strikingly resembles the dark, shimmering threshold of a mirror. Hope comes at the end of the novel in the form of a handshake with the curious, lively plasma of the ocean and the exchange (repeated several times) of a flower. Upon first examination, Tarkovsky would seem to have totally re worked the philosophical structure of his Polish source text. While Lem's Snaut muses on the problem of the visitations being "a situation that is beyond morality,"4 Tarkovsky cuts this line and makes of his film a veritable morality play. The Freudian dilemma of reconciliation with the unconscious plays second fiddle to a deeper look at the 4 "sytuacja, pozamo ralna."; "une situation qui echappe a la morale"; "cHTyactHH BHe MOpaAbHHX HOpM" mission of man, the inward experience evoked by the exotic encounter.

XapH becomes more and more human as time passes, suffering, feeling love and compassion, drawn into the fold of humanity not by the search for communication, but by the awesome gravitational pull of humanity itself, as an existential condition. When she finally begs Sartorius for her merciful execution by negative neurtrino field, Lem's tragedy of contact becomes one of elegiac non accomplishment. The foreign and uncanny can only be civilized and familiarized enough to serve as a screen for projection, a service which inevitably destroys them. Kelvin endures the memory of his dead love and his dead mother, and, in the end, he overcomes his melancholy and begs forgiveness of his mimoidovy father. Kneeling at the threshold of the mimoid-dacha to receive his absolution, Tarkovsky's Kcabbhh receives the same redemption Lem rejects as an archaic illusion. No wonder the Pole nearly disowned the Soviet adaptation. Kelvin accepts his exile from the paradise of childhood, nature and mother and returns to a sublime paradise of the mind, governed by the image-memory of his father. However, the myriad links of the film to Tarkovsky's subsequent mas terpiece, Mirror, beg a deeper investigation of the motifs of doubling and reflection. While the director himself may have viewed and represented Solarisas a painful and unfortunate interruption of his work on Mirror, it seems to have been a fruitful one, conferring a much-needed philosophical depth upon the then largely confused and amorphous ideas of the later film. These links are more than the superficial honing of certain images and devices by a master craftsman (the vacillation between color and black and white to represent shifts in perspective and states of consciousness, the depiction of love's transient fecundity with the image of levitation, Solaris study of Breughel's "Winter" and Mirrors reproduction of it in the end of the "Shell-shock" sequence, etc). Beyond these, both films share</page><page sequence="7">Q 195 the conflation of the protagonist's lost lover with confused memories of his young mother, also lost, and both triangulate this desire with painful contemplation of an unreliable father upon whom all hope for redemp tion rests. Both Solaris and Mirror return to the unsteady ground of the Freudian unconscious that Tarkovsky had ostensibly replaced with the more traditionally humanist concerns of man's mission and condition. Apparendy, instead of the drama of repression, Tarkovsky was interested in les asymetriades of the family romance, finding enough of the uncanny there to go around. But perhaps more significant than all this is the moist, earthward gaze of Mirroras a reminiscence of Solaris churning ocean. In a Bergsonian flourish, the solid forms of thought succumb to the existential flux; liq uefication questions and replaces sublimation. Rain falling indoors serves as an image of art and memory as non-intellectual reflection, reflection via the spirit, the breath, the steam given off by the warm rain that falls on Kelvin's mhmohahhh father at the end of Solaris. The Earth itself is as fluid as time and memory, as much a churning mirror-mind as the ocean-planet. And this is not merely introspection mingling with the desire to speak loudly and clearly for one's whole life. Foreignness abounds in Mirror%s much as in Solaris, with the situation rhyme of exiled Spaniards recalling their childhood, the Pushkinian counter to Chaadaev's thesis of Russian spiritual emptiness with the classic Eastern European marty rology of absorbing the Tatars to save Christian (Western) civilization, accented by images of Soviet soldiers holding back the Maoist hordes and the passing remark from Aleksei about the Asiatic bourgeoisification of their supposedly communal existence. And yet, this variation on the theme of contact is not simply the Romantic absorption of the other as a means of alienating and objectifying the self. Paralleled in the entire</page><page sequence="8">196 A Letter to the Editor construct of Mirror 2&amp; a projection of one's own precarious, inconstant memories while investigating the equivalent memories of another, the gesture of mnemonic mimesis offered by the ocean does, in fact, reduce to a communicative act. Remember how the origins of Mirror in the strange concept of subjecting the director's mother to a long and varied questionnaire, filmed by a hidden camera, reach their conclusion in the English edition of the original screenplay/story, "A White, White Day," with the mother's complaint: "I'm worn out with all your questions. Could you answer all those questions yourself? About your own life, of course?"5 The flawed mirror of memory as a threshold on the unconscious of both self and other is crossed and re-crossed. What remains is the notion of a third choice that will always demolish the seeming solidity of a binary (if he turns at the bush, it is father, if not, father will never return; but he does turn, and he is not father). If our own loved ones become uncanny monsters whom we must learn to love again, does this not imply that the question, the torture of contact unavoidably suffuses all our inner, existentialist mus ings, negotiating and subverting the cognitive divide of subject and object? "Perhaps we are only here at all so as to sense, for the first time, man as a reason for love?"6 Soderbergh doesn't cut the Nietzschean line about what is "beyond morality," although he puts it on the lips of CapTOpnyc. No doubt he deemed that the Hollywood plot twist of Snaut's murder and replacement aboard the Station by his own mimoidovy twin disqualified him from such a human thought. But Soderbergh himself is no humanist either, and conscience is not his primary concern. As should be expected, he indulges in all the gimmicks and predict abilities, the contemporary issues (manic-depression, 5 "Jestem wykonczony twoimi pytaniami. Czy moglbys sam znalezc na nie odpowiedzi? O swym wlasnym zyciu, rzecz jasna."; "Je n'en peux plus de toutes tes questions. Pourrais-tu repondre a toutes ces questions toi-meme? A propos de ta vie, bien sur?"; "K yTOMHAacB or BaraHX BonpocoB. A but cajvtir MOrAH 6bi OTBeTHTb Ha BCe 3th BonpocH? O cBoefi CoBcTBeHHOH jkh3hh, kohchho?" 6 "Moze jestesmy tutaj tylko by po raz pierwszy poczuc czlowieka, jako powod aby kochac?"; "Peut-etre sommes nous ici seulement pour sentir, pour la premiere fois, l*homme en taut que raison pour l'amour?"; "A mojkct 6nrb mm Boo6ine 3AeCB TOAfcKO AAH TOrO, HToGfal BnepBMe omyTHTb AioAeii KaK noBOA aah ak&gt;6bh?" the ethics of psychiatric medication, etc) he needs to give the story mass appeal (though it still did awfully at the box office). Yet, beyond all that, Soderbergh shirks conscience in order to zero in on memory, isolating it and treating it more specifically than Tarkovsky had in his more fraught and enmeshed meanderings. He's good to us simpletons, Soderbergh is. He spells it all out quite nicely.</page><page sequence="9">Q 197 The film alternates throughout between the drama aboard the Sta tion and flashbacks to the slick, black vinyl world of socialites and parties back on futuristic Earth. The director lingers on Rheya and Kelvin's early romance, their descent into dysfunction, and Harey's eventual suicide. Harey le mimoide returns as if only to jog Kelvin's memory, to turn back the clock for him for a fleeting moment. Finally, in the ambiguous series of scenes where, as in Tarkovsky, the audience assumes Kcabbhh has returned to Earth only to learn that he has descended to the surface of Solaris, Soderbergh's Kelvin, played by the bad-boy pediatrician-cum-actor, George Clooney (who bears a striking resemblance to Tarkovsky's Donatas Banionis), develops a key passage from Lem that Tarkovsky condenses. In the novel, Kelvin imagines returning to Earth, resuming the routines of life there, although sure to be alienated from them by the memory of his experiences orbiting Solaris. Soderbergh, on the other hand, takes the liberty of reworking this passage to create a new ending, perpetuating the mediation of contact with the ocean through the doubles (as contrasted with Lem's finale of the unmediated handshake). Soderbergh's Kelvin does return to Earth, to the great, bustling city from whence he came. But his is a mimoid city, no doubt the greatest achievement of mimicry the planet has ever achieved. The defamiliarization of active memory, struggling to recover the quotidian routine, goes beyond mere alienation of the self who has made room in his soul for the other. Soderbergh adds the lines: "I am</page><page sequence="10">198 A Letter to the Editor haunted by the idea that I remembered her wrong. That I shaded my memory of her to suit myself. That I was unfair to her and caused her destruction. What if I was wrong about everything? I've come to believe memory is a curse."7 This is well beyond Tarkovsky's rendition of the idea of false memory with Lem's fantastic detail of Xapn's dress that cannot be unfastened, Kcabbhh having forgotten, or never noticed, the mechanism of how it was done. It is even beyond Tarkovsky's own original image, repeated in Mirror, of the man who cannot properly remember his young mother's face. Soderbergh's much more explicit treatment of false memory comes in the context of Kelvin's impossible return to a city that has been mined or mimed from his mind and reproduced by the ocean. Again we find it when the false memory of a picture of Rheya, not present in the first scene of Kelvin's apartment, announces he has in fact remained on Solaris. Harey finally appears, bearing not a flower, but a sloppy kiss, miraculously ending the time of cruel miracles. In true Hollywood form, she even realizes Tarkovsky's impos sible dream of forgiveness and redemption passed from the lover or mother (and not the father) to the son. She proclaims that "Everything is forgiven. Ev erything,"8 the deep pools of her massive eyes swirling and churning like the ocean of CoAHpnc itself. He may have remembered her wrong. On Earth he failed to recognize the sincerity of the human Harey's suicidal impulses, and now, on Solaris, a failure of memory has kept him from making amends with the Rheya mimoidienne. The double chooses annihilation just as the original did. By making the transition from memory as curse to memory as redemption, Soder bergh completes the general shift of focus away from conscience, and his love story is complete. The lines of Dylan Thomas, "Though lovers be lost, love shall not; / And death shall have no dominion,"9 resound in the cavity left by the removal of Lem's lines "The age-old faith of lovers and poets in the power of love, stronger than death, that finis vitae sednon amoris, is 7 "Przesladuje mnie mysl, ze zle jq, zapa mi^talem.

Lem's contemplation of the cruel and miraculous in the near impossibility of navigat ing the waters between subject and object gives way to the age-old illusions of redemption and, finally, even the sham elegiac triumph over love over death. Perhaps most notably, neither film truly reproduces the content of Kcabbuh's dreams on the cusp of Xapn's final self-annihilation in the novel, both in its place substituting a purely cinematic delirium. In Lem, at least in the French and English versions, Kelvin dreams "visionless dreams, where in an un moving, clotted silence I felt myself being slowly and minutely explored, although no instrument or hand touched me. Yet, I felt myself being invaded through and through, I crumbled, I disintegrated, and only emptiness remained. Total annihilation was succeeded by such terror that its memory alone makes my heart beat faster."11 The explorer suffers exploration at the inquisitive hands of the very plasma he has come to explore, the subject becomes object, the hunter gets captured by the game... But neither film portrays the role-reversal beyond the level of plot. This is quite a serious omission, no? Later in this same chapter, Lem's Kelvin looks at Rheya and in a Beckettian line again introduced by the adventurous French transla tor, he narrates, "I wanted to get up, take her in my arms and stroke her hair. I did not move."12 Still, if we explode the linear logic of adaptation and take the roaming narrative of a single Solaris, overdetermined and multi-lingual as it has become, perhaps we can allow the contradictions, additions, and reversals as a mere celebration of heterogeneity, and, in a way, as an illustration of the central problems of contact, memory, mirror and love.

Somewhere along the line, we have become more interested in the native informant, or even better, in the hybrid souls of visitors from the ocean of the other to our own academy What will become of the inside-outside soul of the regional specialist? The scholar who journeys into exotic landscapes, not to colonize, but to be colonized, to be transformed enough to return (though we are never certain why we return) as a double-agent of contact, a strange colonizer for the other side, smuggling in the sweet experience of the foreign as a means of emancipation and enlightenment from without. Perhaps it is a flawed pattern, more cruel than miraculous. Perhaps we Slavists have no right to represent, to speak, to offer the other from the site of the self. Perhaps we should desist in these juvenile fantasies of our culture, so clearly seized at the moment by a retrograde impulse. But can't we have something of the Caliban in us, too, even if we are free? Is it not possible to find comfort in the peculiar mix of determinism and un certainty that gathers around the cuffs and lips of life after the fierce wanderlust of adolescence? Is there not a way that we might sail between the Scylla and Charybdis of pedagogy and perplexing performance with their alliterative oppression, and chart the way of instruction in the other's damp soul, the loose frame of the self? Kelvin's love lies hidden, as if in the belly of some sleeping tyger, but still she returns, and someday may do so for good. And whether or not she will continue to share her soul with that fearful asymmetry by night, ever vacillating in her half-remembered half-life, it will mean nothing but that she has penetrated the illusion of accomplished perfection and glides now secret, drowsy, beyond the dusky depths of the looking glass and the ceiling painted like a sky.
