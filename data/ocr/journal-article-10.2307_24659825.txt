FELDMAN Yeshiva University, New York Les Antiquites Juives, Volume I: Livres I ä III. Texte, traduction et notes par Etienne NODET avec la collaboration de Gilles BERCEVILLE, Andre PAUL, Elisabeth WARSCHAWSKI. A. Introduction et texte. Les Editions du Cerf. Paris 1990, xlv and 155 pp. ISBN 2-204-04051-7; B. Traduction et notes. Les Editions du Cerf, Paris 1990, 190 pp. ISBN 2-204-04113-0. FF 185. — . This edition of the Greek text, translation into French of the first three books of Josephus' Antiquities, and extensive commentary marks an important milestone, by any standard, in the history of Josephan scholarship. Most important, it is the first systematic new edition of the text since the editions of Niese and Naber a century ago. Nodet had previously come to the important conclusion (RB 94 [1987] 323 375) that the family of manuscripts favored by Niese (and on which the Latin translation of the school of Cassidodorus is dependent) is actually badly placed in the stemma, and that, in particular, Manuscript V (Vaticanus Graecus 147, dating from the thirteenth or fourteenth century and containing [with some lacunae] Books 3 15 of the Antiquities), which Niese collated only for Book 10, now merits complete collation. Following the prevailing tendency of his era, Niese relied unduly on one group of manuscripts, inasmuch as its spelling of proper names was less contaminated by the Sep tuagint, to the exclusion of others; and he thus failed to accept in dividual readings from other manuscripts on a case-by case basis. Naber, whose edition appeared almost simultaneously with that of Niese, often has a smoother and more readable text, but he emends too freely and his apparatus criticus has numerous errors. Heinz</page><page sequence="2">REVIEW ARTICLE 89 Schreckenberg, Die Flavius-Josephus-Tradition in Antike und Mit telalter (Leiden: Brill, 1972), lists 133 manuscripts of the Greek text of the works of Josephus (in whole or in part), of which 50 were unknown to Niese and two of which seem to be of some impor tance. His conclusion, however, is that real progress in reconstituting the text will be made through emendation rather than through further collations. Nodet's apparatus criticus is far more extensive than that of the Loeb Classical Library edition and frequently supplements that of Niese. He systematically gives all the variants for proper names, especially those in the Bible; but, we may remark, such evidence is inconclusive, inasmuch as copyists may well have changed the spelling to accord with the particular text of the Bible before them. In general, Nodet's text avoids emendations and, indeed, is even more conservative than the Loeb text. Unlike Schreckenberg, he puts little store in the Latin translation in his attempt to restore the text. Of Heinz Schreckenberg's suggested emendations ("Einige Vermutungen zum Josephustext," Theokratia 1 [1967-69] 64-75) for this portion of the Antiquities (1.170, 1.267, 2.32), all of which im prove the sense but which are transcriptionally somewhat removed from the manuscripts, he adopts none. As to the translation, Nodet tends to be more literal than Julien Weill's version in the Reinach series (Paris: Leroux, 1900), though he often follows Weill closely. Occasionally, he errs on the side of freedom: thus in 3.270 he translates της κεφαλής ίμάτιον άφελών, "lui decouvre la tete," where a better translation is "removing the cloth from her head." Again, in 3.274 he translates κακόν μέγιστον, "un acte odieux," where a better translation is "the greatest sin." In format the Loeb Classical Library edition is more convenient, having the text and translation on facing pages and having the commentary below text and translation, rather than, as here, in two separate volumes. Nodet's commentary surpasses in its completeness and in its ac curacy any that has yet appeared. He is particularly interested in the relationship of the Antiquities to the Bible and to the Judaism of Josephus' day. It is regrettable, however, that he is not concerned, except rarely, with terminology, style, or grammar. In this connec tion we may here call attention to Robert Paul Gallant's Josephus' Exposition of Biblical Law: An Internal Analysis (diss., Yale University, New Haven, 1988), in which he demonstrates that Josephus has</page><page sequence="3">90 REVIEW ARTICLE used a host of literary devices that both explicitly and implicitly restructure the law. We may thus, for example, often explain his modification of a law because it is analogous to a law with which it is juxtaposed. Likewise, as Gallant (p. 110) has noted, Josephus uses the same word twice (e.g. 3.251: Xoiuov) in close succession, but with two very different connotations, to provide a link between successive legal elements. Most striking is the way in which Josephus (e.g. 3.274; Gallant, p. 135) links legal elements by alliteration and by punning assonance; fju&lt;rfEa0ai...fxriTpdaiv... [iifiaTOv, where the first five letters of [xtayecOat are a permutation of the first five letters of ^eyiaxov. As to grammar, even greater pro gress will be made in restoring Josephus' text when we compile a grammar of Josephus' usage of Greek. Nodet concludes that the kinship between Josephus and Philo is due to the common Jewish culture, but without specific connection. We may, however, point out the striking resemblances between the preface to the Antiquities 1.1-21 and Philo's introduction to De Opificio Mundi 1.1-2.12. We may, for example, note that both offer substantially the same reason why the account of creation precedes that of the giving of the commandments of the Torah, namely to mould the minds to obedience of those who were to receive the laws. Most striking are the parallels in the allegorical interpretation of the Bible. Thus, both look upon the divisions of the Tabernacle (Antiquities 3.181; Philo, Quaestiones in Exodum 2.85; De Vita Mosis 2.18.88) into three parts as symbolic of the earth, the sea, and the heaven; the twelve loaves of shewbread as symbolic of the twelve months (Antiquities 3.182; Philo, De Specialibus Legibus 1.35.172); the seven-branched candlestick as symbolic of the seven planets (Anti quities 3.182; Philo, Quis Rerum Divinarum Heres 45.221-46.226; Quaestiones in Exodum 2.73, 75); the four materials of which the tapestries were woven as symbols of the four elements (Antiquities 3.183; Philo, De Vita Mosis 2.18.88, Quaestiones in Exodum 2.85); the high priest's garments as symbolic of earth, heaven, lightning, the ocean, sun, moon, the signs of the zodiac, etc. (Antiquities 3.184 187; Philo, Quaestiones in Exodum 2.112-114, 117-120). In at least some of these symbolic interpretations, as Louis Ginzberg, The Legends of the Jews, vol. 6 (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1928) 68, note 353, remarks, Philo and Josephus significantly stand alone, unparalleled by any passages in existing rabbinic writings. As to expositions of the Biblical text, Nodet would have found it</page><page sequence="4">REVIEW ARTICLE 91 useful for the Book of Genesis to consult the most systematic presentation of these parallels in Thomas W. Franxman, Genesis and the 'Jewish Antiquities' of Flavius Josephus (Biblica et Orientalia, Rome: Biblical Institute Press, 1979). It is in his commentary that Nodet most excels. The comments below should in no way be interpreted as ingratitude or negative criticism of Nodet's work. They are merely supplements to a first rate work. Antiquities 1.27: Nodet notes Josephus' use ofexxtaev rather than the Septuagint's £TC0t7]aev but fails to see its significance, namely creatio ex nihilo rather than creatio ex aliquo. 1.27: Nodet fails to note whyjosephus has "a breath from above sped" rather than "the spirit of God hovered." Josephus was trying to avoid the implication of the verb merahefet, which connotes "brooding," with the pagan image that the world-egg, in a fashion similar to that of the Orphic theogony, was hatched, as it were, from fluid chaos. 1.28: Nodet fails to explain the reason why Josephus omits "there was evening and there was morning, one day" (Genesis 1:5), namely because the Jewish day does not end at sunrise and because there could hardly have been evening before the day on which light was created. 1.32: Josephus' use of the word §ri[XioupyeT in referring to God's creation of animals is presumably intended to remind the reader of Plato's 3r][xioupy6i;, the creator of Plato's visible world in the Timaeus (40C). 1.32: Nodet fails to note the significance of Josephus' statement that "on this day also He formed man" for the Bible's (Genesis 1:26) "Let us make man in our image," with its reference to God in the plural, wherein Christians found an allusion to the Trinity and which the rabbis (Genesis Rabbah 8.3-7) explained as a reference to God consulting with the angels. 1.34: As a parallel to Josephus' statement that when God formed man out of the dust of the earth he breathed into him not only the breath (irveu^a) of life but also soul (4iUX'n)&gt; Nodet cites the parallel with Wisdom of Solomon 15:11 and 1 Thessalonians 5:23. How ever, these two concepts are, it would seem, opposed to each other in 1 Thessalonians 5:23; and Josephus may have had in mind Plato's three-fold faculties of the soul (Republic 439)—the logical, spirited, and appetitive.</page><page sequence="5">92 REVIEW ARTICLE 1.35: Nodet does not explain why in Josephus it is God rather than Adam who gives names to the animals, namely because the Epicureans (see Lucretius 5.1041 ff.) ridiculed the idea that one man assigned names by spontaneous declaration. 1.38: Note that the conception of a stream, the Okeanos, flowing around the earth, is found among the Greeks from an early period (see Herodotus 2.23). Josephus thus presents Biblical geography (Genesis 2:10) in terms intelligible to his Greek audience. This feature, as Salomo Rappaport, Agada und Exegese bei Flavins Josephus (Wien: Alexander Kohut Memorial Foundation, 1930) 2, note 8, admits, was unknown to the rabbinic Agada and is plainly an at tempt to present Biblical geography in Greek terms. 1.39: On the identification of the Gihon River with the Nile Nodet cites Ben Sira 24:27. Most likely, however, Josephus' source was the Septuagint of Jeremiah 2:18. 1.40: Nodet fails to explain the significance of Josephus' omis sion of the statement (Genesis 2:17) that, according to the warning that God had given him, Adam was to die on the day when he ate of the tree of knowledge; the problem here is that Adam did not die on that day but in fact reached the age of 930. 1.46: Josephus' picture of primitive man unmolested (araxOfj) by any evil is reminiscent of the Stoic goal of &lt;X7ta(kia. 1.46-49: On the developed extra-Biblical picture of the original bliss of mankind Josephus follows a tradition found in many authors from Hesiod on. See my "Hellenizations in Josephus' Por trayal of Man's Decline," in Jacob Neusner (ed.), Religions in Anti quity: Essays in Memory of Erwin Ramsdell Goodenough (Studies in the History of Religions, 14; Leiden: Brill, 1968, 341-344). 1.49: Note the significance of Josephus' omission of the Biblical statement (Genesis 3:16) that one of the punishments meted out by God to Eve is that man should rule thereafter over woman. In generalizing about the evil produced by womanish counsel Josephus is highly reminiscent of Homer's Odyssey (11.436-439). 1.52: Nodet does not ask why Josephus, immediately after reporting the birth of Cain and Abel, states that Adam and Eve also had daughters; the reason presumably is that otherwise the reader would be forced to conclude that Cain married his own mother. 1.52: To the parallels noted by Nodet for the tradition that Adam and Eve had daughters add Pseudo-Philo, Biblical Antiquities 1.1-2.</page><page sequence="6">REVIEW ARTICLE 93 1.54: Note the significance of Josephus' omission of Genesis 4:7, which was regarded by the rabbis (Yoma 52a-b) as one of the five verses of the Torah the grammatical construction of which was undecided. 1.62: Note the parallel with Ovid, Metamorphoses 1.135-136, wherein the ground, like the sunlight and the air, which had previously been the common possession of all men, was now, during the Iron Age, carefully marked out by boundary-lines. So also Virgil, Georgics 1.126-127, Tibullus 1.3.43-44, Ovid's Amores 3.8.41, and Seneca's Phaedra 528-529 and Octavia 420-422. 1.62: On fortifying cities with walls note the parallel with Virgil, Eclogues 4.32-33. 1.69: Josephus' extra-Biblical description of Seth's descendants, who live without dissension, is similar to that of Plato (Laws 3.678E9-679A2). 1.70: On God's pondering whether to destroy the world with fire or with water Nodet omits the classical parallels (Plato, Timaeus 22C1-3 and Ovid, Metamorphoses 1.253-261). Nodet should also note the parallel with Pseudo-Philo's Biblical Antiquities 3.9, which is closer to Josephus in that a promise or prediction is mentioned in which a fire and flood (or in the case of Pseudo-Philo, additional alternatives) are referred to, whereas in the Talmudic parallels the promise of God is merely that He will not send another flood. See my "Josephus' Jewish Antiquities and Pseudo-Philo's Biblical Anti quities, '' in Louis H. Feldman and Gohei Hata (edsJosephus, the Bible, and History (Detroit: Wayne State University, 1989) 62. 1.73: Nodet fails to note the significance of Josephus' omission of the anthropomorphic statement (Genesis 6:6) that God repented that He had created man. 1.74: Nodet cites the rabbinic parallels for the picture of Noah as a preacher but fails to note that the picture is also that of a Cynic or a Stoic preaching such "diatribes" as those written by Menippus, Meleager, Petronius, Epictetus, Dio Chrysostom, and Seneca. 1.74: Note that Josephus' detail that Noah emigrated to another country is unique with him, and that he introduced it presumably in order to explain how the ark had come to rest in Armenia, whereas Noah had lived in Palestine. 1.75: Note that both here and in 1.99 Josephus carefully remarks that God loved Noah for his righteousness but omits completely the</page><page sequence="7">94 REVIEW ARTICLE Biblical statement that he was perfect, presumably because to speak of Noah thus would raise a question as to where Moses and the Torah marked any advance. 1.75: Josephus' extra-Biblical statement that after He had resolved to wipe out the human race God had decided to replace it with one devoid of vice is paralleled by Aeschylus (Prometheus Bound 248-249 [232-233]) and by Ovid (Metamorphoses 1.250-252). We should note that neither Philo nor Pseudo-Philo's Biblical Antiquities nor the rabbis have any parallel to Josephus' unique comment, of fered to defend God against the charge of mere negativism, that God had decided not merely to blot out the existing race of mankind but to replace it with another race free of vice. 1.76: Josephus' statement that Noah alone was saved, God having put into his mind (u7to6e|x£vou) the idea of making an ark, is very similar to the statement in Apollodorus (1.7.2) that Deucalion constructed an ark upon the advice (uiroöejjievou) of Pro metheus. 1.76-77: Note the similarity between Lucian's statement {De Syria Dea 12) that Deucalion was saved in this manner (r\ Be acoxripirj f^Se iyevexo) and Josephus' (acoxrjptav toia6xr)v). Moreover, Lucian says that Deucalion put his children and their wives (TtouSai; xe xal fuvaixai; eauxoü) on the ship, whereas Josephus very similarly states that Noah embarked with his children, the mother of his children, and their wives (ouv xrj [xrjxpt x&lt;5v 7ta(Swv xat xaT? xoikcov yuvatijiv). 1.92: Nodet should comment on the significance of Josephus' omission of the anthropomorphic statement (Genesis 8:21) that God smelled the sweet savor of Noah's sacrifice. 1.96: Whereas the Bible gives no reason for the sacrifice which Noah offered upon emerging from the ark, Josephus explains that Noah did so because he was fearful that God would send another flood and sought thus to beseech Him not to do so. 1.96: Nodet should comment on the fact that whereas in the Bi ble (Genesis 8:21-22) the attention is focused on God, Who pro mises not to make any wholesale destruction of man in the future, in Josephus the attention shifts to Noah, who reasons with God to maintain the primitive good order of nature and not to send an other calamity upon mankind. 1.99: Nodet fails to note the reason why Josephus omits the statement in which God says that "He will not curse the ground any more for man's sake, for the imagination of man's heart is evil</page><page sequence="8">REVIEW ARTICLE 95 from his youth," an embarrassing passage for a Jew inasmuch as it seems to allude to a doctrine of original sin. 1.100: Nodet omits the significance of the fact that the genera tion obliterated by the Flood had been guilty of oßpi? and that the punishment meted out by God is to be viewed as v£(i.eai?, as in a Greek tragedy. 1.102 Nodet should explain that Josephus, presumably because it would have been embarrassing to expect more of Gentiles than of Jews, differs from the rabbinic interpretation (Sanhedrin 57b), which understood that the sons of Noah (i.e. non-Jews), on the basis of Genesis 9:6, are forbidden to have abortions (although in Against Apion 2.202 he declares that abortion is prohibited for Jews). 1.103: Note that for his pagan Greek readers (e.g. Homer, Iliad 17.547) the rainbow is a symbol of war and thus has the opposite connotation of what it has in Genesis. Note, furthermore, that Josephus carefully avoids stating (Genesis 9:13) that God created the rainbow; indeed, the rabbis are troubled that God should have set the rainbow in the cloud as a kind of afterthought of the Flood and that He seemingly did not have the foresight to do so earlier; hence they declare (Aboth 5.6) that God created the rainbow on the eve of the Sabbath of creation. Josephus' solution is to state that God displayed (dwtoar](j[.aiva&gt;v) the rainbow, which presumably had been created long before. 1.103: Andre Paul, "Flavius Josephus' 'Antiquities of the Jews'; An Anti-Christian Manifesto," New Testament Studies 31 (1985) 473-480, has argued that Josephus' substitution of the word roxüXav ("truce") for the word berith (Genesis 9:9, Septuagint, 8ta0r|xr|v) is due to his desire to dissociate himself from the New Testament's emphasis on the the "new covenant." We may reply, however, that if Josephus were writing an anti-Christian manifesto we would have expected him to be more open about it, since he had nothing to fear from the Christians at the time that he wrote the An tiquities, inasmuch as they were few in number and were hardly held in favor by the Emperor Domitian, during whose reign Josephus issued his work. Moreover, the fact that Josephus (20.198-200), in a passage whose authenticity has seldom been questioned, is so laudatory of James, the brother of Jesus, is hardly consistent with a polemic against Christianity. The avoidance of the term Sioc0r|XT) would rather seem to be due to Josephus' desire to avoid the na tional implications of the covenant and to view Judaism as a religion rather than as a national entity.</page><page sequence="9">96 REVIEW ARTICLE 1.109: Nodet fails to note that Josephus' statement that Noah's sons were the first to descend (xaxaßacrtv) fro the heights (and xwv 64&gt;riXcöv) to the plains (ti&lt;; -cot 7te8ia) is paralleled by Plato's descrip tion (Laws 3.677B1-3) of the descent (xoraxßouveiv) of shepherds from the heights (ex ... tgov 6&lt;J&gt;r|Xai&gt;v) into the plains (erct -rot 7te8£a) after the Greek flood. 1.110: Note that the reasons why God urges Noah's descendants to found colonies are similar to those which led to the founding of many Greek colonies, namely a population explosion and the threat of civil strife; see, e.g., Herodotus' account (1.94) of the founding of Etruria by the Lydians. 1.113: To the parallels noted by Nodet for the tradition connec ting Nimrod with the Tower of Babel add Pseudo-Philo, Biblical An tiquities 6.14. 1.142: Josephus explains, as the Bible (Genesis 9:27) does not, that Noah did not curse Ham himself (but rather Ham's son Ca naan) because of his nearness of kin. 1.156: On Josephus' unique proof for the existence of God from the predictable irregularity of heavenly phenomena and its relation to Stoic proofs see my "Abraham the Greek Philosopher in Josephus," Transactions of the American Philological Association 99 (1968) 145-149. 1.157, 160: Both Josephus and Pseudo-Philo's Biblical Antiquities 8.1, perhaps out of anti-Samaritan motives, omit Abram's stay at Shechem and Bethel (Genesis 12:6-8), which the Samaritans equated with their sacred Mount Gerizim. 1.160: The tradition of a place named after Abram is also found in Pseudo-Philo's Biblical Antiquities 6.18. 1.181: It is not clear from the Hebrew Bible (Genesis 14:20) whether Abram gave a tenth or received it from Melchizedek. Josephus is here in line with the Septuagint, the Genesis Apocryphon (col. 22, line 17), Jubilees (13:25-27), and the rabbis in interpreting this passage to mean that Abram gave a tenth to Melchizedek. 1.192: Since he wishes to diminish the role of God in his nar rative and since, as a Jew who spent the latter half of his life in the Diaspora and who sought an accommodation with the Romans, Josephus seeks to reduce the centrality of the land of Israel, he omits the fact that circumcision is a sign of the covenant between God and Abraham (Genesis 17:10-11) and instead declares that its</page><page sequence="10">REVIEW ARTICLE 97 purpose is to prevent Abraham's posterity from mixing with others. 1.209: For apologetic reasons Josephus omits the Biblical passage (Genesis 20:9) in which Abimelech bitterly remonstrates to Abraham for deceiving him; instead, we are told that Abimelech sent for Abraham and bade him have no further fear of any in dignity to his wife. 1.218: Abraham's seeming cruelty toward Hagar is softened by his omission of the Biblical statement (Genesis 21-14) that she lost her way in the wilderness of Beer-sheba, a scene which Targum Jonathan presents with even more vividness than does the Biblical text. Moreover, the pathetic scene (Genesis 21:16) in which Hagar lifts up her voice and weeps is completely omitted by Josephus, since it would apparently cast an unfavorable reflection on Abraham as pitiless. 1.218: Nodet misses the parallel with Euripides' Hercules Furens 323-324, noted by Thackeray (ad loc.) and commented upon by me in my "Josephus as a Biblical Interpreter; the cAqedah," Jewish Quarterly Review 75 (1985) 219-221. 1.222: Josephus' reading of [xovoyevfj proves that he was render ing the Hebrewyehidekha, "your only one" (Genesis 22:2), rather than the Septuagint's äyomTyröv, "beloved." Nodet renders "uni que," which is possible, according to Liddell and Scott's Greek lexicon; but, in view of the Hebrew, "only born" is more likely, despite the fact that Isaac was not Abraham's only son. It is signifi cant that in the Biblical episode most closely parallel to the cAqedah, namely Jephthah's sacrifice of his daughter, she is termed (Judges 11:34) an only child (yehidah), as indeed she is; and there the Sep tuagint renders this word by (jLovoyev^i; as does Josephus (5.264). 1.222: Nodet notes the parallel phrase "on the threshold of old age" in Homer's Iliad 22.60 but does not explain its significance. See my "Josephus as a Biblical Interpreter: the cAqedah215. 1.223: Nodet should comment on the fact that Abraham hoped to leave his son ärcocöfj and on the range of meaning of this word— "unscathed, not suffering, unaffected, without feeling," also "emotionless." In translating this word by "florissant," "flourishing," Nodet has lost the double entendre. 1.224: Nodet fails to note that Josephus identifies the mountain where Abraham took Isaac as Moriah, as does the Hebrew text, whereas the Septuagint has 0&lt;})T)Xiqv, "lofty." This would provide evidence that Josephus knew the Hebrew text. In my "Josephus as</page><page sequence="11">98 REVIEW ARTICLE a Biblical Interpreter: the cAqedah," p. 227, I have conjectured that the Septuagint avoided mention of Moriah because (itopia in Greek means "folly." Josephus, we may assume, would have been aware of the possible sneer; the fact that Josephus goes out of his way to mention Mount Moriah and to state (1.226) that it was there that King David later built the Temple seems thus to be deliberate. 1.225: It is significant that in obeying the divine command Abraham is presented as a kind of Stoic philosopher who reasons that "all that befell His favored ones was ordained by His pro vidence (rcpovoiai;, a favorite Stoic word). Indeed, as Harold W. At tridge, The Interpretation of Biblical History in the Antiquitates Judaicae ofFlavius Josephus (Missoula: Scholars, 1976) 71-76, has shown, the motif of God's rcpovoia is frequently found in Josephus' extra Biblical additions in connection with many of his Biblical char acters. 1.226: In the Bible (Genesis 22:5) Abraham appears to be dis ingenuous in telling the young men who accompany him to the scene of the sacrifice of Isaac that he and Isaac will worship and then return to them. The rabbis explain this lack of truth by saying that Abraham is here prophesying unconsciously that they will return. Josephus characteristically, for apologetic reasons, omits this statement altogether. 1.227: Nodet notes Josephus' addition in giving Isaac's age as 25, but he does not comment on the significance of this detail. The reason would seem to be that it is important to establish that Isaac was not a mere lad (Genesis 22:5 [Nodet wrongly has 22:7]) but a grown young man and hence was able to make a deliberate choice as to whether he would consent to his being sacrificed. This is partic ularly important to Josephus in view of the fact that Iphigenia, with whom Isaac would certainly be compared by his Greek readers, did in Euripides' Iphigenia at Aulis heroically consent to be sacrificed. See my "Josephus as a Biblical Interpreter: the cAqedah," pp. 234-236. 1.228: Nodet does not comment on Josephus' omission of the most important word in his entire account of Abraham's readiness to sacrifice Isaac, to judge from the way in which the rabbis refer to the incident, namely caqad ("bound," Genesis 22:9), a hapax legomenon in the Bible. Instead he has Abraham deliver a homily to Isaac. Presumably, to a Greek audience, the physical binding of Isaac would have been incriminating for Abraham; Josephus</page><page sequence="12">REVIEW ARTICLE 99 heightens the heroism of Isaac in rushing (1.232) upon the altar, thus presenting a more favorable comparison with Iphigenia. 1.232: There is a close parallel between Isaac's exclamation "that he deserved never to have been born at all were to reject the decision of God and of his father" and Isaac's question in Pseudo Philo's Biblical Antiquities (32.3), "What if I had not been born in the world to be offered a sacrifice unto Him that made me?" 1.232: Isaac's extra-Biblical statement, which has no rabbinic parallel, is that even if the command to be sacrificed had been the brainchild of his father alone, it would have been impious to disobey it; in this Josephus may have had in mind the basic pattern in pagan sacrifice, as seen, for example, in Euripides' Bacchae, which required that the sacrificial animal should press forward voluntarily as a sign that it is willingly led by the god. 1.233: In Josephus it is God Himself rather than, as in Genesis 22:13, an angel who addresses Abraham and produces a ram to take the place of the sacrificial human victim, presumably because the subject was too important to be left to even the best of God's deputies. 1.236: The scene of the ram caught in a thicket by its horns may have seemed grotesque and too much of a miracle for a rationaliz ing Greek intellectual. Hence, Josephus omits this and states merely that God brought the ram from obscurity into view, with the clear implication that the ram had always been there. 1.255: The Bible (Genesis 25:5-6) ascribes to Abraham an ap parently unequal treatment of his sons, for he is said to have be queathed all that he had to Isaac and to have given only gifts to his sons by Keturah. Josephus, for apologetic reasons, omits Abraham's distributions of his property altogether. 1.257: Whereas the oracle, according to both the Hebrew and Greek Bible (Genesis 25:23), states that the older (that is, Esau) will serve the younger (Jacob), Josephus, in order to avoid the impres sion that the descendants of Esau, presumably here the Romans, are destimed to be slaves of the Jews, writes rather that the lesser will excel the greater. 1.258: Josephus omits the statement (Genesis 25:25) that Esau was red at birth, presumably because in antiquity there was a general prejudice against ruddy or red-haired persons. See my "Josephus' Portrait of Jacob, "Jewish Quarterly Review 79 (1988-89) 123-124.</page><page sequence="13">100 REVIEW ARTICLE 1.258: Nodet, page 56, note 5, does remark that Josephus omits the etymology of the name of Jacob ("supplanter," Genesis 25:26), but he does not explain why. In my "Josephus' Portrait of Jacob," 114, I suggest that it was embarrassing to look upon the ancestor of the Jewish people as aggressive from his very birth. 1.269: In his presentation of Esau's relationship with Isaac, Josephus arouses more sympathy for Esau, presumably because of the tradition that Esau was the ancestor of Josephus' beloved Romans. Thus, he emphasizes Esau's piety toward his father, so that whereas the Bible (Genesis 27:5) says merely that Esau went to the field to get venison for Isaac, Josephus presents him as acting with much greater enthusiasm, since he says that Esau rushed to the chase. 1.269: Josephus transfers the blame for the deception of Isaac completely to Rebecca, even though, in general, he drastically reduces the role of Rebecca. 1.271: Nodet omits comment on Josephus' failure to refer to Jacob's false and embarrassing statement (Genesis 27:19) that "I am Esau, your first-born." Indeed, in Josephus (2.173) God Himself justifies Jacob's theft of the blessing, saying that it was He who had given the princedom to him rather than to Esau. 1.272: Nodet says simply that the blessing given by Isaac to Jacob is different from that in Genesis 27:27-29 without stating how, namely that the national aspect is totally omitted, presumably because Josephus was a lackey of the Romans. 1.276: For apologetic reasons Josephus omits mention of the statement (Genesis 27:43) that Esau intended to kill Jacob. 1.277: Josephus uses restrained language, again for apologetic reasons, in stating that Isaac and his family were not well disposed to Esau's marriages with Canaanite women. 1.278 and 282: Presumably because the Romans were so sen sitive about proselytism by Jews, Josephus is careful to omit any in dication (Genesis 28:3-4, 14) that Jews will seek to convert others to Judaism. 1.279: While the Bible (Genesis 28:12) speaks of angels ascen ding and descending in Jacob's dream, Josephus rationalizing, declares that Jacob thought that he saw a ladder, and instead of angels has phantoms of nature. 1.303: Josephus says nothing of Jacob's hatred for Leah (Genesis 29:31) but rather accentuates the positive, namely his passion (epco?) for Rachel.</page><page sequence="14">REVIEW ARTICLE 101 1.333: Whereas the Bible (Genesis 32:28), in its version of Jacob's wrestling with the angel, states that Jacob's name will from now on be Israel "because you have striven with God and with men," in Josephus' version the struggle with men (which might, presumably, include the Romans) is significantly omitted from the explanation of the name. 1.336: As to the key word, vayishaqehu ("and he [Esau] kissed him [Jacob]," Genesis 33:4), which in the Masoretic text is dotted and which led to much disagreement among the rabbis as to Esau's sincerity, Josephus eliminates it, presumably for apologetic reasons, and states instead that Esau greeted Jacob. 1.340: Simeon and Levi, in massacring the Shechemites, acted without their father Jacob's permission. 1.343: To be sure, Nodet does note that Josephus omits "till this day" (Genesis 35:20) but does not explain why, namely because such a statement would imply that the passage was written long after the event. 2.3: For apologetic reasons Josephus says nothing about Esau despising his birthright (Genesis 25:34). 2.6: Josephus significantly omits the Biblical statement (Genesis 36:31), which would seem to be written from a much later vantage point when the Israelites had kings, that "these are the kings that reigned in Edom before there reigned any king over the children of Israel." 2.51: In the Bible (Genesis 39:9), in response to the invitation to Joseph by Potiphar's wife to have relations with her, Joseph cries out, "How can I sin against God?" Consistent with his general de emphasis on the role of God, Josephus' Joseph says nothing about God and only later (2.52) mentions God when he appeals dramatically to her conscience. 2.205: Though Josephus closely parallels the rabbinic tradition with regard to the predictions of Moses' birth, in Josephus it is an Egyptian sacred scribe, surely a more impressive figure to his au dience than a King Nimrod, who makes the prediction of Moses' future greatness. 2.207 The Samaritan tradition, which often parallels that of Josephus and of the rabbis in midrashic details, has a passage in the Book of Asatir in almost the very words of Josephus in which an Egyptian scribe foretells that from the loins of Levi "will come one who will be mighty in faith and in knowledge, that the heaven and</page><page sequence="15">102 REVIEW ARTICLE the earth will hearken to his word, and that by his hands will come the destruction of Egypt." 2.218: Though he has many details that are parallel to the rab binic tradition, Josephus, because he sought to minimize miraculous details, here avoids mentioning the tradition {Mid.ra.sh Exodus Rabbah 1:19; Baba Bathra 120a) that Jochebed, Moses' mother, was 130 years old when she gave birth to Moses, and "that the marks of youth came back to her, her flesh was again smooth, the wrinkles straightened out, and her beauty returned." 2.218: Josephus does not have the tradition (Midrash Exodus Rabbah 11.20; Midrash Deuteronomy Rabbah 11.10) that when he came out of his mother's womb Moses was already circumcised, that when he was only three days old he not only walked but even talked with his parents, and that he actually refused to drink milk from his mother's breasts until she had received her payment from Pharaoh's daughter. Likewise, again apparently because he sought to avoid miraculous details, he lacks the tradition (Midrash Exodus Rabbah 1.20) that at the moment of the child's appearance the whole house was flooded with light, and that this was the light which God had created at the beginning of creation but which he had hidden, anticipating the wickedness of the generation of the deluge and of the Tower of Babel, who were unworthy to enjoy it. 2.219: In an extra-Biblical detail which has no rabbinic parallel, Josephus explains why Amram, rather than Jochebed, chose to put the baby Moses into a basket upon the river, namely to commit the salvation of the child to God and thus not to bring to nought the promise which God had given him in a dream. This is particularly effective, inasmuch as generally Josephus de-emphasizes the role of God, presumably in order to win the favor of his rationalistic readers. 2.220: Josephus lacks the rabbinic tradition (Sotah 12b, Midrash Exodus Rabbah 1.24) that when Moses was exposed in the basket on the river the angels appeared before God and asked how He could allow Moses to die in the sea when he was destined to sing a song of praise to God because of the miracle of crossing the Red Sea. Josephus, seeking to diminish the miraculous, finds it much more credible to have Amram express assurance that God would provide complete security that nothing should be falsified of that which He had promised in his dream. 2.224: Whereas the Hebrew text declares that Moses was goodly</page><page sequence="16">REVIEW ARTICLE 103 (tov) and whereas the Septuagint renders this as aaxeiov ("pretty, graceful, charming"), Josephus speaks of his beauty (xaXXou?) and later describes him as being of divine beauty (fxopcpfj...9£tov). Ap parently, this tradition of Moses' beauty had even reached the non Jewish world, inasmuch as we find in Pompeius Trogus (ap. Justin, Historiae Philippicae 36, Epitome 2.11), who lived at the end of the first century B.C.E. and at the beginning of the first century C.E., the statement that Moses' beauty of appearance (formae pulchritudo) recommended him. 2.230: Nodet translates that Moses showed his superior maturity in his educative activities (les activites educatives), reading roaBeiocii;, whereas the Loeb and other editors follow the Regius manuscript (R), dating from the fourteenth century, and read naiSiocT?, "pastimes, amusements, childish play." The Latin translation reads infantia, "infancy," and would seem to support the latter reading. Support for this reading may be seen in the reference to the childishness (vrpttoxri-ra, 2.233, where the Latin translation again reads per infantiam) with which Moses threw Pharaoh's crown upon the ground. As a parallel to the reading touSiocü; we may point to Herodotus' description (1.114) of the ten-year-old Cyrus, later to be king of Persia, whose parentage was discovered through an incident which occurred when he was playing with the village boys, during which he ordered one of them to be beaten because he had disobeyed his command. 2.232: It is significant that Josephus uses the same nouns (fjiop&lt;pr| and cppovrjfxoc) in the description by Pharaoh's daughter of the infant Moses that are used by Dionysius of Halicarnassus (1.79.10) in describing Romulus and Remus. 2.232-236: Nodet notes the rabbinic parallels, but he does not comment on the reasons why Josephus departed from them. In the midrash (Tanhuma Exodus 8; Midrash Exodus Rabbah 1.26; Midrash Deuteronomy Rabbah 11.10; Yashar Exodus 131b-132b) it is Moses who takes the crown from Pharaoh's head and places it upon his own as a clear prediction that he would some day displace Pharaoh. In Josephus, well aware that such an aggressive attitude would not find favor among his readers, it is Pharaoh's daughter who takes the initiative of bringing the infant Moses to him because she is mindful for the succession and because, inasmuch as she has no child of her own, she seeks to adopt Moses as heir apparent. If Josephus had reproduced the rabbinic tradition of having Moses</page><page sequence="17">104 REVIEW ARTICLE seize Pharaoh's crown, the parallel (Nonnus, Dionysiaca 6.269 and 27.228) with Zagreus, that is Dionysus, who, soon after his birth, ascended the throne of his father Zeus and mimicked him by bran dishing lightning in his little hand, might well have suggested itself to his pagan audience. Josephus was particularly sensitive to the charge of Jewish aggressiveness because the Jews had been twice expelled from Rome because of aggressive missionary activities, in 139 B.C.E. (Valerius Maximus 1.3.3) and in 19 C.E. (Dio Cassius 57.18.5a). 2.238-253: Nodet does not discuss why Josephus felt impelled to present this lengthy extra-Biblical account of Moses' campaign against the Ethiopians. In the first place, the episode supplies a case history at once in the causes of anti-Semitism and in the benefits that the Jews have given to society. In particular, whereas the Bible has the embarrassing account of Moses' flight because he had murdered an Egyptian, here we have a much more satisfactory explanation, namely to escape the attempt of the jealous Egyptians to murder him. It disproves the contention that the Jews are cowards who are militarily inept. It provides more flesh and blood to the Israelite leader Moses. Including, as it does, the love affair of Moses and the Ethiopian princess (which is not present in Ar tapanus, whose account it otherwise resembles), it provides roman tic interest for his readers. 2.241: It is significant that whereas in the Septuagint Moses is never called axpaxr\j6&lt;; (general) or even rpf£[j.a&gt;v (leader), in Josephus, who realized the importance attached by the ancients to military excellence in a hero, he is referred to fifteen times in the Antiquities (2.241, 268; 3.2, 11, 12, 28, 47, 65, 78, 105; 4.82, 194, 329) and once in the Against Apion (2.158) as a axparriyo?; in addi tion, the verb axpaxTiyew, "to be a field-commander," "to lead an army," is used of him once (2.243); and the noun a-cpaxriyia, "army command," "office of supreme commander," is used of him twice (2.255, 282). Furthermore, the noun rjye[jLa)v is used of him six times (2.268, 4.11; Against Apion 1.238, 261; 2.156, 159). 2.253: Significantly, as part of his apologetic strain, Josephus declares that Moses did abide by his agreement and married the Ethiopian princess, whereas in the parallel stories in the Graeco Roman legendary and historical traditions, the hero systematically betrays the traitoress. 2.263: Josephus apparently felt apologetic about the fact that</page><page sequence="18">REVIEW ARTICLE 105 Moses was a shepherd, perhaps because shepherds were dis qualified as judges or witnesses in Palestine, according to the Rabbis (Sanhedrin 25b), apparently because they sometimes ap propriated the sheep of others. Hence, whereas the Bible (Exodus 3:1) states that Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, Josephus here adds an explanation, namely that in those days the wealth of barbarian races consisted of sheep. 2.268: Significantly, it was not as teacher or legislator that the voice from the burning bush bade Moses to act but rather as general (axpa-rrj-fo?) and leader (r^eii-cov). 2.269: In the Bible (Exodus 3:8) God tells Moses from the burn ing bush that He will take the Israelites into the land of the Ca naanites, flowing with milk and honey. A similar statement is found a few verses later (Exodus 3:17). The implication is clear: the Israelites are to displace the Canaanites and establish an indepen dent state. Josephus here, however, significantly makes no mention of the Canaanites who are to be displaced, and there is no implica tion of an independent state; the Israelites are merely to come to the land and settle there. 2.274: Inasmuch as the ideal statesman, as we see, for example, in Thucydides' portrait of Pericles (2.60), must have the ability of speech to persuade the masses, Josephus was confronted with a ma jor problem in the case of Moses, inasmuch as the Bible (Exodus 4:10 and 6:12) notes that Moses had a speech impediment. Significantly, Josephus omits both of these references. 2.274: Josephus, in his concern not to elevate Moses to divinity, as had the Samaritans in effect, is careful to omit God's statement that Moses was to be to Aaron as God (Exodus 4:16) and God's statement (Exodus 7:1) that God was making him as God to Pharaoh. 2.277: The Septuagint (Exodus 4:20) avoids stating that Moses put his wife and his sons upon an ass and sent them back to the land of Egypt, and instead, presumably because the ass was such a lowly animal, declares that Moses mounted them upon beasts, without indicating the identity of the animals. Indeed, the Talmud (Megillah 9a) declares that the translators, under divine inspiration, substituted "carrier of men" for "ass." Josephus goes one step fur ther and says that Moses took his wife and sons and hastened away, without mentioning the means. 2.280: Whereas the Bible (Exodus 4:30) states that Aaron per</page><page sequence="19">106 REVIEW ARTICLE formed the miracles in the presence of the people in order to con vince them, Josephus, in his eagerness to upgrade the importance of Moses, declared that it was Moses who, after at first failing to convince the most distinguished of the Israelites by a mere descrip tion of the miracles, then proceeded to perform them before their very eyes. 2.287: Josephus must have been troubled by the fact that in the encounter between Moses and the Egyptian magicians the Egyp tians are also able to perform feats of magic comparable to those of Moses; but Josephus is here careful to remark that the Egyptian rods only "looked like pythons." 2.292: When God gives his charge to Moses (Exodus 6:4, 8) tell ing him to go to Pharaoh to request that he allow the Israelites to leave, He reminds Moses that He had established His covenant with the forefathers to give them the land of Canaan. There is here a clear indication that the Israelites are to displace the Canaanite inhabitants and establish an independent state. Josephus, opposed as he was to an independent Jewish state and eager not to ruffle the Romans, significantly omits the entire passage. 2.293: In addition to the reasons which Josephus here gives for recounting the plagues, we may add that he desired to show the power of Moses in bringing them on, since he clearly sought to divorce Moses as such as possible from the picture of a magician, inasmuch as this kind of jugglery (2.230) was sneered at by the Egyptians. 2.294: Whereas the Bible (Exodus 7:19) says that it was Aaron who with his staff produced the plague of blood, Josephus, in his concern not to make Aaron more important than Moses, though he generally avoids imputing miracles to God, says that the plague was produced at God's command and does not indicate who actually produced it. Likewise, in Exodus (8:2) it is Aaron who produces the plague of frogs, whereas in Josephus (2.296) it is God who brings on the plague. Furthermore, it is Aaron who in Exodus (8:13) pro duces the plague of lice, whereas in Josephus (2.300) it is God who directly sends the plague of lice. 2.295: Realizing that the fact that the Egyptians (Exodus 7:22) were able to duplicate the feat of turning the river of Egypt into blood detracted from the miraculous nature of the plague, Josephus here omits this altogether. 2.303: In the dispute as to what the fourth plague consisted of,</page><page sequence="20">REVIEW ARTICLE 107 Pseudo-Philo's Biblical Antiquities 10.1 agrees with Josephus in iden tifying it as a mixture of wild beasts. 2.303: A theological problem that must have troubled Josephus is the fact that according to the Hebrew text (Exodus 9:6) God caused all the Egyptian cattle to die in the fifth plague, whereas later (Exodus 9:19, 11:5) we find that there are still living cattle to be found in Egypt. Josephus resolved the problem by simply omit ting the fifth plague altogether, even though he promises (2.293) to recoünt them all, and, indeed, does so at length (2.293-314). We may note that Pseudo-Philo's Biblical Antiquities 10.1, like Josephus, omits one of the plagues, but it is boils (the sixth plague) in the case of the former. 2.312: Josephus here gives the reason why the remnants of meat of the Paschal sacrifice are burnt, "as persons on the eve of depar ture." 2.314: One of the incidents which would appear to contradict the Israelites' reputation for honesty and presumably Moses' reputa tion for integrity was Moses' permission to the Israelites to borrow jewelry and clothing from the Egyptians. Indeed, a pagan writer, Pompeius Trogus (36.2.12-13), who is generally friendly to the Jews, states that the Jews carried off by stealth the sacred vessels of the Egyptians. Josephus totally omits the passage (Exodus 3:21-22) which states that before leaving Egypt the Israelites were to borrow jewels and clothing from the Egyptians. In his paraphrase of Ex odus 11:2-3 he says here not that the Israelites approached the Egyptians but rather that it was the Egyptians who took the in itiative in honoring the Israelites with gifts. 2.315: That Moses himself was not prejudiced against Gentiles is clear from the fact that Josephus here differentiaties between Pharaoh and the Egyptians, carefully noting, in an extra-Biblical addition, that when the Israelites departed from Egypt the Egyp tians lamented and regretted the harsh treatment that they had given to the Israelites. 2.322: Josephus, seeking to heighten the role of Moses, asserts that it was Moses who chose the roundabout route to the Promised Land. Keenly aware of the apparent lack of wisdom in leading a multitude through a desert, Josephus, in addition to the Biblical answer, presents two further explanations, namely so that if the Egyptians changed their minds and wished to pursue them they should be punished for this malicious breach of their pact, and so</page><page sequence="21">108 REVIEW ARTICLE that the Israelites might come to Mount Sinai, where God had com manded Moses to do sacrifice. 2.323: One of the great divine miracles in connection with the exodus is that, according to Exodus 13:21, the Lord went before the Israelites, protecting them by day in a pillar of cloud and by night in a pillar of fire. Josephus significantly omits it totally, presumably because he feared that his readers would find it incredible. 2.334-336: The miracle at the Red Sea, surely the most spec tacular of all the miracles performed by God in connection with the exodus, serves, in Josephus' version, to heighten not merely God but also Moses. Thus, whereas in the Bible (Exodus 14:13-14), Moses addresses the people, urging them to have confidence in God, Josephus here has him addressing God directly and showing his supreme faith in Him, in His providence, and in His might. 2.348: Josephus might well have been acquainted with the ra tionalized view of the Memphians, as cited by Artapanus (ap. Eusebius, PraeparatioEvangelica 9.27.35), that Moses, being familiar with the countryside, watched for the ebb tide, and then led the Israelite multitudes through the dry part of the sea. 3.14-15: Whereas in the Bible (Exodus 16:6) Moses and Aaron merely promise the Israelites food, in Josephus it is Moses alone who confronts the unruly mob and exhorts them not to be obsessed by their present discomforts and to have confidence in God's solicitude. He thus calms them (3.22), restraining their impulse to stone him. The scene is reminiscent of the passage in Virgil's Aeneid (1.124-147) in which Neptune calms the seas that have been made turbulent by Aeolus and in which Virgil presents as a simile (Aeneid 1.148-156) the effect upon a turbulent crowd when a great leader assuages their feelings. 3.25: By adding the statement that quails are a species of bird abundant above all others in that area and that they are accustomed to skim the ground, Josephus clearly rationalizes the miracle (Ex odus 16:13). 3.47-48: Whereas in the Bible (Exodus 17:9) it is to Joshua that Moses entrusts the leadership in battle, in Josephus it is Moses who takes the lead in calling up the heads of the tribes and the other of ficers and exhorts these subordinates to obey him, their general. 3.60: Josephus, adopting a neutral position between Exodus 17:14, which states that God will utterly blot out the Amalekites, and Deuteronomy 25:19, which declares that the Israelites are to do</page><page sequence="22">REVIEW ARTICLE 109 so, puts it in the form of a prediction that the Amalekites are to be exterminated, without indicating by whom. 3.95-96: Josephus is careful to dispel the view by some that when Moses tarried on Mount Sinai for forty days it was because he had been taken back to the divinity. This was particularly necessary in view of the fact that the apotheosis of heroes, such as Dionysus, Heracles, and Asclepius was a commonplace among the Greeks. Josephus may also be reacting to Sophocles' account of the mysterious disappearance of Oedipus in Oedipus at Colonus which bears a striking resemblance to that of Moses. It is also just possible that Josephus is reacting against the Christian tradition of the apotheosis of Jesus (Luke 24; Acts 1). See James D. Tabor, "'Returning to the Divinity': Josephus's Portrayal of the Disap pearances of Enoch. Elijah, and Moses "Journal of Biblical Literature 108 (1989) 225-238. 3.99 Whereas the Biblical narrative (Exodus 34:28) states that Moses neither ate bread nor drank water during the forty days that he was on Mount Sinai, Josephus says that he tasted no food of the kinds designated for men. The implication is that Moses ate heavenly food, that is, nectar and ambrosia. Yet, in the very passages (3.317, 320) where Josephus refers to Moses as so inspir ing and as ranking higher than his own nature he is careful to refer to him as a man. 3.102: In the Bible (Exodus 25:2 and 35:5) the Israelites bring their gifts with gladness of heart toward God, whereas in Josephus, who consistently seeks to de-emphasize the role of God, their rejoic ing is focussed on Moses their general. 3.104: Whereas the Bible (Exodus 31:3) states that the architec tural skills of Bezalel are due to the Divine Spirit, in Josephus, who consistently seeks to emphasize the role of Moses, it is Moses who sets the architects over the project. 3.134-138: A theological problem arises when one considers that the Torah, said to have been given by God, seems to contradict itself. The account in Exodus (37:1-9) states that Bezalel made the ark of the covenant, whereas the version in Deuteronomy (10:1-5) indicates that Moses made it. Even if we attempt to reconcile the two versions by asserting that Moses could be accredited with making that which an assistant completed, we are still confronted with another contradiction, in that in the version in Exodus Bezalel made the ark after Moses' second descent from Sinai (Exodus</page><page sequence="23">110 REVIEW ARTICLE 34:29), whereas the account in Deuteronomy indicates that Moses made it before his ascent. Josephus, apparently aware of the problem, skilfully sidesteps it by simply not mentioning who built the ark. 3.168: Nodet presents a very useful table of the names and order of the twelve stones in the breastplate of the high priest, in the ver sions, respectfully, of the Hebrew text, the Septuagint, Josephus' War 5.234, and the Antiquities here. This should be supplemented by the table in my Prolegomenon to the reprint of M. R. James, The Biblical Antiquities of Philo (New York: Ktav, 1971) cxiii, where, in addition to these four columns, I give the data for the lists in the New Testament (Revelation 21:19), Midrash Shemoth Rabbah 38.8, and Pseudo-Philo's Biblical Antiquities 26:10-11. Pseudo-Philo's list agrees with the Hebrew text eleven times, with the Septuagint twelve times, with Josephus' War twelve times, with the Antiquities eleven for twelve times, with Revelation eleven or twelve times, and with the Midrash nine times. In the key matter of order Pseudo-Philo agrees with the Hebrew text six times, the Septuagint ten times, Josephus' War six times, Josephus' Antiquities eight times, Revelation no times, and Midrash four or five times. It is interesting that in the one place where Pseudo-Philo does not agree with the Septuagint, namely in the identity of stones 8 and 9, it is in agreement with Josephus' Antiquities, which is a later version and obviously, to judge from the wording of the passages, a correction of the list in the War. 3.180: The fact that Moses is here referred to as a "lawgiver" (vo|xo0eTT]&lt;;) rather than, as he is cited in rabbinic literature, as "Moses our master" (Mosheh Rabenu) is an adaptation for Gentile understanding of his primary role in Jewish history to make him parallel with other great lawgivers, such as Lycurgus of Sparta. See Wayne Meeks, The Prophet-King: Moses Traditions and the Johannine Christo logy (Supplements to Novum Testamentum, 14. Leiden: Brill, 1967) 132. 3.180: In referring to Moses as a "man of God" (OsTov ocvSpa) Josephus is not asserting Moses' divinity but is rather seeking to refute those anti-Semites who had charged the Jews (3.179) with slighting the divinity whom they themselves professed to venerate. 3.196: Josephus here gives the number of those who contributed the half-shekel as 605,550, whereas the Bible (Exodus 38:26: both the Hebrew and the Septuagint version) give the number as</page><page sequence="24">REVIEW ARTICLE 111 603,550. In Antiquities 3.288 Josephus gives the number of men capable of bearing arms as 603,650, whereas the Bible (Numbers 1:46: both the Hebrew and the Septuagint version) give the number again as 603,550. We may note that there are no variants in the manuscripts of Josephus at both of these points and that the Latin version agrees with the figures which the Greek has. Nodet, in his note (p. 184, note 4) on 3.288 remarks that Josephus' figures differ from the Biblical numbers by a single digit in both cases, and he postulates that this was under the influence of a neighboring figure and hence due to an error in the archetype. We may, how ever, note a similar divergence in Pseudo-Philo's Biblical Antiquities (14.3), who gives the number as 604,550. 3.203: A miracle which Josephus' readers would apparently find difficult to comprehend was the filling of the tabernacle by the Divine presence (Exodus 40:34-35), which prevented Moses from entering it. Josephus here rationalizes this phenomenon by explain ing that a delicious dew was distilled from the cloud, thereby reveal ing God's presence to those who both desired it and believed in it. 3.224: Nodet should note the contradiction between this classification of sacrifices and that in 3.204. 3.226: Nodet, 171, note 3, cites Mishnah Parah 1.3 as saying that lambs and goats to be sacrificed must be between one and two years old. But Mishnah Parah 1.3 speaks of lambs and rams, not goats, and says that lambs must be [no more than] one year old; it specifically declares that either a ram or a lamb that is thirteen months old is not valid as a sacrifice. 3.227: Josephus substitutes cleaning for flaying (Leviticus 1:6) of sacrificial animals. 3.232: "The sinner who is conscious of sin but has none to con vict him of it": the latter phrase is unscriptural. 3.235: Nodet fails to note that Josephus omits frankincense from the meal offering (Leviticus 2:1). 3.241: By using ayovxe«; for the communal goat Josephus conveys the impression that the communal goat is alive during its removal. See Gallant, pp. 88-90. 3.243: Nodet says that Josephus has drawn upon Leviticus 4:8 10; but the terms there do not mention the extremities. 3.245: Josephus seems to condition the celebration of the festival of Tabernacles upon conquest of Palestine. 3.245: According to Leviticus 23:36 sacrifices are to be brought</page><page sequence="25">112 REVIEW ARTICLE on all eight days of the festival, but the four species are required to be taken only on the first day. Josephus specifies both sacrifices and the taking of the species for all eight days. 3.245: Josephus here identifies "the fruit of goodly trees" (Leviticus 23:40) with the persea (7t£paeoc&lt;;). Nodet identifies the persea with the etrog or citron; but the persea is a fleshy one-seeded fruit of the laurel family, the most common member of which is the avocado. Elsewhere Josephus (Antiquities 13.372) does identify the fruit of goodly trees as the citron (xixpou;), as do the rabbis (Sukkah 35a). 3.248: As Gallant, p. 105, notes, because of the inconsistency between Exodus 12:3 and 21 (which mentions a lamb) and Deuteronomy 16:2 (which mentions flock or herd, i.e. large cattle) Josephus does not identify the animals to be offered in the Passover sacrifice. 3.251: Gallant, pp. 16-17, notes the significance of the fact that the portion of the omer offering (Leviticus 23:9-14) assigned to the priests is called to Xoitcov ("the remainder"), and that the same term appears with a different connotation in the next phrase: xai tots Xoutov. This double use of Xoitcov serves to relate the obligatory and permissive components of the omer ritual. 3.261: Josephus declares that a menstruating woman is removed from pure things and is separated from the public on account of uncleanness, just as rabbinic tradition {Seder Eliyahu Rabbah 16, pp. 75-76) declares. 3.262: Nodet offers Leviticus 14:10 as a parallel; but Josephus here speaks of two female lambs, whereas Leviticus 14:10 speaks of two male lambs and one ewe lamb. 3.270: "After removing the covering her head": Numbers 5:18 speaks of uncovering the head of the woman suspected of adultery; but Josephus here, as well as the rabbinic tradition (Sifre Numbers 11.17), clearly indicates that it was the practice of married women to cover their heads, the source of this halakhah until today. 3.271: Nodet cites Rabbi Ishmael (Sifre Numbers 5.28; add Sotah 26a) as agreeing with Josephus' statement that if the suspected adulteress is wrongly accused by her husband she will give birth to a male child in the tenth month. Acutally, Rabbi Ishmael says that she will do so only if she had hitherto given birth only to daughters. 3.287: One of the embarrassing questions that readers might well have asked is why the Levites —Moses among them— were exempt</page><page sequence="26">REVIEW ARTICLE 113 from military service. The Bible (Numbers 1:47) gives no reason; but Josephus here gives a very plausible explanation, namely that the Levites were a holy tribe. 3.290: Josephus gives the number of Levites as 22,880 (Nodet in his text neglects to mention the variant reading xpio^iXiot, which would give a total of 23,880, found in two important manuscripts and in the Epitome), whereas the Bible (Numbers 3:39, both in the Hebrew and in the Septuagint) gives the total as 22,000. Pseudo Philo's Biblical Antiquities 14.3 gives the number of Levites above 50 as 47,300, and those below 20 as 850,850, and a hopelessly corrupt number (1,602,900, according to the restoration by Charles Per rot and Pierre-Maurice Bogaert [ed.], Pseudo-Philon, Les Anti quites Bibliqu.es, vol. 2 [Paris: Les Editions du Cerf, 1976] 119) for the total. 3.291: In view of the importance which his pagan Greek au dience attached to music, it is not surprising that Josephus makes Moses, on his own initiative, the inventer of a musical instrument, the silver trumpet (ßuxavrj), thus making him comparable to Hermes, who was said to have invented the lyre, and the goddess Athena, who was said to have invented the aulos (flute or, rather, oboe).</page></plain_text>
