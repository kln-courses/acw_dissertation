<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 120 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 41 (2014) Sean McQueen Biocapitalism and Schizophrenia: Rethinking the Frankenstein Barrier  N. Katherine Hayles considers the demise of the liberal-humanist subject, and the subsequent instantiation of the posthuman, as an opportunity to return to postmodernism “the flesh that continues to be erased” (5). Yet the posthuman can only be understood in relation to the human, and Julie Clarke’s deconstruction in The Paradox of the Posthuman (2009) suggests that the posthuman extrapolates beyond but nevertheless endorses humanism. If the posthuman is bound to slip back into the values of humanism and to conflate humanism with modernism (Latour 13), then it might prove useful to emphasize for posthuman discourses the values denied in its origin. That is, we need a posthumanism founded on that which humanism and modernism actively negate; this requires the introduction of the nonhuman animal according to Cary Wolfe, who argues that posthumanist posthumanism “has to do with understanding—and understanding the consequences of—the very redefinition of what humanistic knowledge is,” a redefintion that has to do with questioning the accuracy of a discourse of humanism that, in Derrida’s phrase, “the human that it ‘gives to itself’” (126). Although he mentions them on the next page, Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari are not included in Wolfe’s theoretical mapping (which includes, among others, Latour and Haraway) of posthumanist posthumanism (125-26). Like Wolfe, Deleuze and Guattari oppose the “anthropological dogma” (Wolfe xiv-xv) of humanism, a dogma that insists on the repression of the animal (the term nonhuman animal highlighting the animality of the human), and emphasize material existence.  The central contention of this essay is that Deleuze and Guattari’s becomings-animal are particularly useful for rethinking George Slusser’s “Frankenstein barrier.” In Shelley’s tale (1818), Victor Frankenstein denies the monster’s demand for a companion and thus the means to procreate. Citing Frankenstein as the foundational sf text, Slusser takes this action as emblematic of the point at which, more broadly, the future possibilities of sf creation and the story in general fold back upon one another through the denial of futurity, accompanied, as we shall see, by regression into Oedipal relations. While the denial of futurity is Frankenstein’s as much as the monster’s, the barrier is nevertheless anthropocentric, for “Victor seeks through reason to transform animal nature, [and] that same animality ... stands as a thing unmoving in the path of not only Frankenstein’s but all our dreams of the future” (Slusser 51). For Slusser, the Frankenstein barrier is the logic that informs sf, and he sees in cyberpunk the means to overcome it (52). By analyzing and contrasting Mary Shelley’s myth for modernity, Frankenstein (1818) and Vincenzo Natali’s Splice (2009), I argue that attention to the nonhuman animal provides another way to conceptualize this barrier in the </page> <page sequence="2"> BIOCAPITALISM AND SCHIZOPHRENIA 121 twenty-first century, because the Frankenstein myth has increasingly come to incorporate and be identified with nonhuman animals. Using Bruno Latour’s conception of the hybrid in modernity, I will show that Frankenstein is a paradigmatically modern text in its approach to nonhuman animals, and that this enables us to understand the technoscientific and Oedipal relations through Deleuze and Guattari’s Oedipal animal. The nonhuman animal in Splice is, by contrast, a product of postmodern, technoscientific biocapitalism, a very different type of hybrid that gives rise to new technoscientific and Oedipal relations. The contrast is contingent upon a more pronounced affinity with Deleuze and Guattari’s becoming-animal and makes Splice more than just a recent example of the nonhuman animal injected into the Frankenstein myth; rather, it is a significant addition because it is the nonhuman, rather than the human animal that alters the Frankenstein barrier.  Two factors inform this change from the human to the nonhuman animal. First, the bodies that concern me are defined by mythopoetical narrative conventions of genre and their technoscientific conditions. I thus ascribe to becomings-animal a narrative function coterminous with both modern metanarratives and their supposed lack of purchase in postmodernism. For Haraway, Deleuze and Guattari’s is a “philosophy of the sublime, not the earthly, not the mud; becoming-animal is not an autre-mondialisation” (28).1 I argue, contra Haraway, that Deleuze and Guattari’s becomings-animal, and the statuses of the nonhuman animal hybrids they produce, are grounded in and contingent upon material technoscientific conditions and cultural attitudes. Indeed, it is the intersections of power relations—of biotechnology and the family—that make following Deleuze and Guattari along this line worthwhile. The contrast between becomings-animal as they appear in Frankenstein and in Splice will allow us to reconceptualize the Frankenstein barrier. Second, the psychoanalytical valances at work in these texts and in Slusser’s barrier shape conceptions of the nonhuman animal and, more specifically, the nonhuman animal hybrid, and these too are shaped by technoscientific conditions.  Deleuze and Guattari’s becomings-animal illuminate the “zone of proximity or copresence” (Thousand 273, emphasis in original) between two molar forms that are overcoded by psychoanalysis and Western humanist modernity. Slavoj Žižek says “becoming means transcending the context of historical conditions out of which a phenomenon emerges” (“Becomings”). His choice of words is poor—Deleuze and Guattari permit no transcendence—but he is right that becomings are escapist and offer possibilities outside of Western cultural, social, and political thinking. Deleuze and Guattari note that sf is a productive site for becomings: “[it] has gone through a whole evolution taking it from animal, vegetable, and mineral becomings to becomings of bacteria, viruses, molecules, and things imperceptible” (Thousand 248). In sf we get exaggerated, though nevertheless sophisticated and polemical, instances of becomings-animal. It is a genre that frequently occupies the space between anticipation and eventuation, and this too is similar to Deleuze and Guattari’s sense of becomings-animal: “There is a reality of becoming-animal, even </page> <page sequence="3"> 122 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 41 (2014) though one does not in reality become animal” (Thousand 273). They suppose that we   know nothing about a body until we know what it can do, in other words, what its affects are, how they can or cannot enter into composition with other affects, with the affects of another body, either to destroy that body or to be destroyed by it, either to exchange actions and passions with it or to join with it in composing a more powerful body. (Thousand 257)  Hybrids, monsters, creatures, Frankenmonsters, and variations thereof are always already in some way nonhuman and understood as, or made to conform with, differing understandings of the nonhuman animal. Wolfe’s sense of posthumanism “requires us to attend to that thing called ‘the human’ with greater specificity, greater attention to its embodiment, embeddedness, and materiality, and how these in turn shape and are shaped by consciousness, mind, and so on” (120). With regard to Deleuze and Guattari’s becomings- animals, the impulse to rethink the human is evident in the analyses of Hassan Melehy and Claire Perkins, but these analyses, like Wolfe’s, miss the opportunity to focus not on the human, but on the nonhuman. This is also true of Slusser’s Frankenstein barrier. With this change in perspective, the question might well be asked: can a nonhuman animal participate in a becoming- animal? Deleuze and Guattari leave the question unresolved, save to state: “I cannot become dog without the dog itself becoming something else” (Thousand 258). This essay will test this presumption. There seems to be an intentional avoidance of the human in the interest of accounting for the nonhuman animal hybrid in postmodern biocapitalism—an approach nevertheless implicit in Wolfe’s assertion—that echoes Haraway’s critique of Deleuze and Guattari. Wolfe later suggests that for “biopolitical theory, the animality of the human becomes a central problem—perhaps the central problem—to be produced, controlled, or regulated for politics in its distinctly modern form” (100). I am not interested in the becomings-animal of the human, however, for the distinctly modern and human-centric nature of the Frankenstein barrier renders them problematic. I will look at where the becoming-animal of the nonhuman goes, and how it reworks the Frankenstein barrier. A Filthy Type of Yours. Shelley subtitled Frankenstein “The Modern Prometheus” and, although the novel was first published on the cusp of Romanticism and has links to the spirit of the Age of Enlightenment (see Adams), Turney is right to say that the novel is “the governing myth of modern biology” and a “myth of modernity” (3, 8). In this sense of modernity the hybrid that Frankenstein creates is intelligible through Latour’s conception of modernism. In We Have Never Been Modern, Latour argues that modernism is characterized by two impulses: the creation of “new types of beings, hybrids of nature and culture,” and the “purification” of these forces into distinct zones of human (culture) and nonhuman (nature): “So long as we consider these two practices ... separately, we are truly modern—that is, we willingly subscribe to the critical project, even though that project is developed </page> <page sequence="4"> BIOCAPITALISM AND SCHIZOPHRENIA 123 only through the proliferation of hybrids down below. As soon as we direct our attention simultaneously to the work of purification and the work of hybridization, we immediately stop being wholly modern” and, in the process, efface having ever been modern (10-11). The hybrid thrives when and where it is most suppressed and effaced. In this sense, hybrids are endemic to modernism, proliferating and “interbreeding” in substrata, yet effaced by modernism’s tendency to create binaries between human and nonhuman, between “what happens ‘above’ and what happens ‘below,’” and between nature and culture (12, 13). To extrapolate Latour’s binaries, we find the division between Western masculine transcendence, arising from the Cartesian cogito operating in the cultural sphere, and embodied “feminine” subjectivity, aligned with nature and the distinction between human and nonhuman animals. Victor Frankenstein is both Prometheus pyrphoros, the Titan who stole fire from the gods and delivered it to humans, and Prometheus plasticator, “said to have created or recreated mankind,” often with the same fire, “by animating a figure made of clay” (Joseph vi). Less frequently is Prometheus and, by extension, Frankenstein, considered in relation to nonhuman animals. Sherryl Vint observes that in “some versions of the legend, Prometheus is contrasted with his foolish brother Epimetheus, who is given the task of distributing positive traits to the animals. Lacking foresight, Epimetheus has run out of gifts when he reaches humans; in compensation Prometheus steals fire for humanity.” Thus we might “acknowledge Prometheus’s compensatory gift of technology as that which has created the human-animal boundary” (182). It is the ad-hoc and consolatory Prometheus, and the humanist repression of animality and the desire for transcendence described by Wolfe (xv), that is characteristic of Western modernity:  For what made the grands récits of modernity master narratives if not the fact that they were all narratives of mastery, of man seeking his telos in the conquest of nature? What function did these narratives play other than to legitimize Western man’s self-appointed mission of transforming the entire planet in his own image? (Owens 75) Frankenstein’s “fervent longing to penetrate the secrets of nature” (39) and to bring them under his control is the impulse of modernity, and its use of the consolatory gift of technology affects perceptions of nonhuman hybrids. Susan Squire suggests that Frankenstein’s monster is “an interspecies hybrid,” functioning “as a point of origin for the negative literary image of xenogenic desire” (366). The monster is metonymically animalized by Frankenstein, who calls him “daemon,” “wretch” and “vile insect” (99) and assembled in a “workshop of filthy creation” with materials furnished from the “dissecting room and the slaughter-house” (55). Frankenstein’s manipulation of these animal materials (metonymical or otherwise) makes him a “distinctly modern hero who embodies the deepest impulses of modernity to control nature, perfect social existence, and produce new forms of life” (Best and Kellner 159). </page> <page sequence="5"> 124 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 41 (2014) For Deleuze and Guattari, becomings are always opposed to these metanarratives. This is not to say that they are absent from narratives, since Deleuze and Guattari develop their theory with reference to Melville’s Moby Dick (1851) and Kafka’s Metamorphosis (1915). Metanarratives strive for certainty and resolution, which are antithetical to escapist and molecular becomings. In structuralism, myths are understood by binarism and invariance and “it is always possible to try to explain these blocks of becoming by a correspondence between two relations, but to do so most certainly impoverishes the phenomenon under study” (Thousand 237; emphasis in original) More specifically, becomings often resolve themselves into molar identities. They can be arrested and recoded as necessary transgressions that create illusory ideological openness. Thus “myth recapitulates them in its own terms in order to curb them.... Societies ... have always appropriated these becomings in order to break them, reduce them to relations of totemic or symbolic correspondence” (237, 247-48). Becomings are therefore “more like fragments of tales” (237) than narratives, although their arrest and resolution into or affirmation of the fixity of the molar is the stuff of metanarratives. Frankenstein’s monster is an instance of becoming, and its treatment in the narrative is instructive. George Slusser says that  To place Frankenstein at the beginning of the SF genre is to erect what I call the Frankenstein barrier. If SF is distinguished from other literary forms by the fact that science is given a free hand there to construct things to come, then Victor is the first SF protagonist. And he actually makes, for the first time in a literary work, a true thing of future possibility. But that future thing, perhaps because it is a thing of fiction as well, seems destined to collapse back on itself.... Mary Shelley’s novel opens SF’s epistemological futures only to subject them to a particularly stringent law of inverse proportionality. (48-49) Slusser’s analysis identifies an essential quality enduring in the Frankenstein paradigm: the interconnectedness between the denial of futurity and the Oedipal relationship between creature and creator: “Victor’s refusal ... forc[es] the future back on itself so that it is now the future itself that blocks the future, in the form of a thing destructively present at each of Victor’s junctures of futurity—family, friendship, marriage” (Slusser 48). Thus, the Frankenstein barrier allows us to examine the resolution of unstable becomings into molar forms. Returning to Latour, we can identify the double movement of modernity at work here, since Frankenstein, a figure of the social, takes nature as his object in order to “purify” it of indeterminacy (62), yet the result is a nonhuman animal hybrid whose potential for proliferation causes the utmost anxiety.  The territory of Freudian psychoanalysis is an undesirable state for Deleuze and Guattari, and Frankenstein’s monster “get[s] bogged down and fall[s] back to the Oedipal family animal” (Thousand 250). Just as the denial of futurity retards the narrative for Slusser, so too “One allows oneself to be re- Oedipalized not by guilt but by fatigue, by lack of invention” (Kafka 33). The narrative of Frankenstein is well summarized (albeit inadvertently) in this passage from Deleuze and Guattari:  </page> <page sequence="6"> BIOCAPITALISM AND SCHIZOPHRENIA 125 The old-time theologians drew a clear distinction between two kinds of curses against sexuality. The first concerns sexuality as a process of filiation transmitting the original sin. But the second concerns it as a power of alliance inspiring illicit unions or abominable loves. This differs significantly from the first in that it tends to prevent procreation; since the demon does not himself have the ability to procreate, he must adopt indirect means. (Thousand 246)   Frankenstein’s Promethean transgression restages original sin, and his monster must indeed adopt indirect means to procreate, entreating Frankenstein to make him a female counterpart. The biblical analogues and allusions to Milton’s Paradise Lost (1667) are well documented, particularly by Andrew Milner (195-238). Yet it is not the mythopoetical dimensions of the monster, or its self-identification with the biblical Adam and Milton’s Satan, that evoke terror. Rather, it is the monster’s ontological status, “his immanent embeddedness in the life-world” (Csicsery-Ronay 154), that is repellent. Janet Staiger notes that “In botany and zoology, the function of hybridization is to produce invigorated offspring by crossbreeding, but the offspring may be sterile. So too, the hybridized literary text ... may create a strong effect, but the hybrid itself does not generate a new family” (195). Frankenstein, however, has produced offspring in the form of innumerable adaptations, and Frankenstein’s terror at the thought of the monster’s fecundity infers that he is not sterile either. His unhappy trajectory can be understood as the arresting of a line of flight characteristic of a “botched” becoming.  The monster of the Frankenstein barrier is thus Deleuze and Guattari’s domesticated and sentimental Oedipal animal, those that “invite us to regress, draw us into a narcissistic contemplation, and ... are the only kind of animal psychoanalysis understands” (Thousand 240). The daddy-mommy-animal triad Deleuze and Guattari suppose characteristic of the Oedipal animal is evident. Frankenstein is incestuous not because Elizabeth is his (albeit adopted) sister, but because of his conflation of Elizabeth with his mother, who died of fever contracted while caring for Elizabeth. When he dreams of Elizabeth, she decays and transmogrifies into his dead mother and he wakes to find the monster hovering over him (58). The monster is thus the “unnatural” offspring of a repressed sexual attraction for his mother and a manifestation of Oedipal anxiety. This anxiety is accentuated by the psychoanalytical figure of the Doppelgänger, with “the Oedipalized animal as psychoanalysis sees it, as the image of the father” (Deleuze and Guattari Thousand 244). The monster becomes Frankenstein’s Doppelgänger, his “own spirit let loose” (77), who himself claims, “my form is a filthy type of yours, more horrid even from the very resemblance” (130). Frankenstein’s refusal to create another monster is his wresting back of patrilineal control, but the monster, enraged by the denial of sexual reproduction, says, “I shall be with you on your wedding-night” (168), evoking the primal scene. The monster, assuming the early stage of a child’s psychosexual development, interprets the primal scene as violence visited upon the mother and enacted in the murder of Elizabeth. </page> <page sequence="7"> 126 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 41 (2014) Biocapitalism and Schizophrenia. At the end of Shelley’s tale, the monster perishes in the Arctic snow, but innumerable adaptations and reworkings testify that he is hardly dead.2 Though he returns to a state of Oedipal repression, restagings of the artificial creation and manipulation of life cannot be told without some acknowledgement of Frankenstein “because, like stories from the Bible, it has passed into general and universal mythology” (Reichardt 136). Indeed, for Paul O’Flinn, “There is no such thing as Frankenstein.... There are only Frankensteins, as the text is ceaselessly written, reproduced, re-filmed and redesigned” (22). Natali’s Splice is not an adaptation of Frankenstein but rather reworks the Frankenstein myth. As Sheryl Hamilton demonstrates, sf and biotechnologies are consumed in combination by the general public (276) and often undifferentiated.3 We can see this lack of differentiation in the way “Franken” has become a polysemic sign for a variety of scientific discourses and perceptions, from Frankenstein “cinemyths” (Picart 1) and “Frankensteinian images” (Turney 11), to “Frankenfarms,” “Frankentomatoes” and “Frankenvirus[es]” (Lederer and Ratzan), to a generalized symbol for (the misapplication of) Western science (Rollin 154). Two features are common to Frankenimages: they have a biological orientation and, more and more, have acquired the presence of nonhuman animals, so much so that Bernard Rollin suggests that genetically engineered animals are invariably linked to Frankenstein in its many incarnations (1). Tora Holmberg states that transgenetic animals represent “Frankenscience” (62), such as the “earmouse,” or, more properly, Vacanti Mouse, one of two subjects in Patricia Piccinini’s Protein Lattice #1: Subject Red (1997), which Natali claims to be the inspiration for Splice (Fordham 12).4 We can see Piccinini’s Vacanti Mouse and female subject conflated in Splice’s Dren (Delphine Chanéac).  As a new addition to the Frankenstein myth, Splice dramatizes the intersecting power relations of technoscience (biotechnology) and familial relations (reproduction). In Splice, Clive (Adrien Brody) and Elsa (Sarah Polley) are romantic and professional partners at the cutting edge of their field of genetic engineering. Clive wishes to start a family but Elsa does not want to have children after being raised by an abusive mother. They work for Nucleic Exchange Research and Development, a pharmaceutical company that creates amorphous hybrids of nonhuman animal species to aid the development of livestock. Splicing human DNA with nonhuman animal hybrids would allow research into treatments for Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease, diabetes, and cancer. Forbidden to do this, they conduct the experiment in secret and succeed in creating a genetically recombinant and cloned hybrid, Dren, whom they raise in secret. They use DNA manipulation technologies, combined with interspecies in vitro fertilization, a technology developed equally in the fields of human reproduction and stockbreeding (Turney 161). Clive’s name evokes actor Colin Clive, who played Henry Frankenstein in James Whale’s two Frankenstein adaptations (1931 and 1935), while Elsa’s alludes to Elsa Lanchester’s portrayal of both Mary Shelley and the eponymous Bride in Bride of Frankenstein (1935). Splice reworks this dual </page> <page sequence="8"> BIOCAPITALISM AND SCHIZOPHRENIA 127 role, since Elsa, like Shelley, is both Dren’s creator and also in some way the creation itself, since Dren’s human DNA is derived from Elsa’s.  Splice’s narrative is informed by the directives of biocapitalism intelligible through contemporary science-as-industry.5 This biocapitalistic imperative is postmodern rather than modern with regard to the hybrid, because it “ideologically grants and materially invests in a world in which species boundaries can be radically crossed ... in the genetic and aesthetic pursuit of new markets” (Shukin 11). Clive and Elsa’s customer, Newstead Pharma, sees no immediate profit in the project to splice human and nonhuman DNA, and wishes to extract the CD356 protein from the nonhuman hybrids and rush it to market. Elsa, dismissing ethical questions, objects: “if we don’t use human DNA now, someone else will.” Joan (Simona Maicanescu), the CEO of Newstead, replies: “you put a viable product for livestock on the table, then we will talk about a twenty-year plan to save the world.” As Vint suggests, “we have now entered an era in which biology has become a discourse of information, and the value established through the biotech industry is largely a value based on market projections” (“Science” 165). Dren is for Newstead Pharma first and foremost a commodity, reducible to a protein that can be reproduced in genetic code. At this intersection of technoscientific innovation and familial relations in Clive and Elsa’s parentage of Dren, the usefulness of Deleuze and Guattari’s becoming-animal emerges. Simply put, it is because of these technoscientific conditions that Dren can be understood as Deleuze and Guattari’s “demonic animal” (Thousand 241), the becoming-animal par excellence. Such becoming-animal can be understood through its affects and resistance to Oedipal signification, and it becomes apparent that these affects are available to Dren only because of technoscientific conditions.6 To become animal—and this will be important for Dren—is “to participate in a movement, to stake out the path of escape in all its positivity, to cross a threshold, to reach a continuum of intensities that are valuable only in themselves, to find a world of pure intensities where all forms come undone, as do all the significations, signifiers, and signifieds” (Deleuze and Guattari Kafka 13). The significance of becoming-animal is that this animal is a schizophrenic, in Deleuze and Guattari’s sense of materialist schizoanalysis as opposed to representational psychoanalysis. Dren’s becoming-animal is further distinguishable from the Oedipal animal of the Frankenstein barrier because in Splice there is a becoming-woman. In their influential reading of Frankenstein, Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar suggest that “Frankenstein’s male monster may really be a female in disguise” (237) and psycho- biographers frequently adduce the links among Shelley, Frankenstein, and the monster. The Oedipal father/son relationship is, nevertheless, the dominant one. For Deleuze and Guattari, all becomings, including becomings-animal, “pass through” becoming-woman (Thousand 277). This is more pronounced in Splice than it is in Frankenstein, since Dren acquires a womanly resemblance, but this is not becoming-woman. Deleuze and Guattari’s use of the word “woman” is strategic, best understood as opposite to man, the “molar entity par excellence,” “the majority, or rather the standard upon </page> <page sequence="9"> 128 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 41 (2014) which the majority is based: white, male, adult, ‘rational,’ etc.” (Thousand 292). This is the universal man postmodern theory has, by and large, sought to decenter, which is why there are no becomings-man. Deleuze and Guattari’s movement through woman to nonhuman animals is problematic and, historically, the two concepts have been linked in scientific and cultural discourses to their mutual detriment (see Birke). Deleuze and Guattari are not referring, however, to a sexed or gendered body, any more than to a species- specific nonhuman animal: “In the same way that we avoided defining a body by its organs and functions, we will avoid defining it by Species or Genus characteristics; instead we will seek to count its affects” (Thousand 257). Dren’s body is a constantly metamorphosing body-without-organs, the body of immanent potential “opposed to organisation of the organs” (Message 33); for example, what appear to be tumor-riddled lungs enable Dren to breath under water.7 There are objections to and varying interpretations of becomings-woman, and in my reading I take it to “refe[r] to every discourse that is not anthropocentric, and is thus coded by all economic, social, cultural, organic, and political circuits as ‘minority’” (Colman 101).8  The technoscientific and cultural conditions in Splice further distinguish it from Frankenstein. Dren is an example of transbiology, “a biology that is not only born and bred, or born and made, but made and born” (Franklin 171). She is genetically engineered, a product of recombinant DNA technology, “which involves combining DNA from two different species” (in this case human and unspecified nonhuman animals), and a clone, “a new individual ... generated from a single cell, circumventing sexual reproduction” (Kirby 193). It is significant that Dren is also cybrid, produced by the “implantation of a human cell nucleus into an enucleated animal egg” (Haddow et al. 4). Hybrids, as Latour finds them in the modern constitution, are artificial notions of disconnection that result from our ideological work to separate nature and culture. Cybridization is the inverse, since it actively seeks to collapse the binaries that Latour deems characteristic of modernism, while emphasizing his industrial conception of technoscience. While most hybrids constitute a “barrier threat,” cybrids, in ways never realized by Frankenstein’s monster, constitute a “creation threat” in two senses: in the distinction between “what is human and what is animal” (Latour 5) that Elsa exploits by claiming that although “Human cloning is illegal. This won’t be human, not entirely”; and in the threat posed by Dren’s potential to reproduce and create more hybrid beings. Thus, Dren’s becoming-animal is contingent upon technoscientific discourse, which provides the necessary conditions of its becoming, and it is this becoming-animal of the nonhuman-animal-hybrid that begins to rework the Frankenstein barrier. Dren is a clone, and in the clone we find psycho- analytical dilemmas, especially incest, the figure of the Doppelgänger, and bestiality. In Frankenstein we see the Oedipalization of the becoming-animal that both erects and maintains the Frankenstein barrier. Here we can observe that becoming-animal can be measured in terms of affect and asignification. Dren, realizing Frankenstein’s fear that a female monster might turn “to the </page> <page sequence="10"> BIOCAPITALISM AND SCHIZOPHRENIA 129 superior beauty of man” (165), has consensual sex with Clive, and later forces what appears to be a masculinized body upon Elsa. Both cases, arguably, are incestuous sex acts between parent and child. Given that Dren’s physiological and psychosexual development is neither relative to humans nor species- specific, this could also be considered sexual assault perpetrated by both Clive and Elsa, since Dren might be too young (by human standards) to consent. In the first act, as a clone, Dren is genetically linked to Clive’s partner, Elsa; in the second act, because Dren is Elsa’s clone, the act might be read as a kind of (in)voluntary (mutual) masturbation. In any event, Dren’s becoming-animal is asignificatory and irreconcilable with molar forms, since a clone “resolves all oedipal sexuality” (Baudrillard, Simulacra 96) at a semantic level.  Just as Deleuze and Guattari reproach Freud for turning the unconscious into a representational theatre (Anti-Oedipus 24), Jean Baudrillard writes of the de-representational effects of cloning technoscience: “we may see in cloning the resurgence of our fascination with an archaic form of incest with the original twin” (Vital 12). Through cloning, incest becomes interconnected and confused with the Doppelgänger. Cloning de-metaphorizes the Doppelgänger, resulting in “the materialization of the double by genetic means, that is to say the abolition of all alterity and of any imaginary” (Baudrillard, Simulacra 97). Although he considers this the realization of the death drive and a return to pre-individual asexuality (Freud’s “polymorphous perversity”), this is surely both the death of the Lacanian imaginary and the liquidation of psycho- analytical, and thus Oedipal, signification.9 We recall that in Frankenstein the monster assumes the role of Frankenstein’s Doppelgänger, his murder of Elizabeth a recapitulation of the interpreted violence of the primal scene. The primal scene in Splice is rather different: it is Clive who bears the brunt of the sexual confusion since Dren is, genetically, Clive’s partner Elsa and, in Oedipal triangulation, Dren’s father. The sex act that occurs between Clive and Dren is presaged when Dren retires to bed, fondling the blonde hair of a doll in the soft light of a child’s bedroom and, in the following scene, Clive and Elsa have sex. As Elsa straddles Clive, he looks over her shoulder to see Dren lurking behind a gossamer curtain, inclining her head with a child’s naive curiosity as she watches her “parents.” In a series of shot-reverse-shots that establish both Clive and Dren as equally inquisitive, Clive orgasms while fondling Elsa’s blonde hair, gesturing to Elsa and Dren’s shared genetics, but also prefiguring Dren’s desire for Elsa. Here, as for Deleuze and Guattari, Oedipal filiations are “prepersonal intensive states that could just as well ‘extend’ to other persons,” retrospective categories that “do not exist prior to the prohibitions that constitute them as such” (Anti-Oedipus 161, 160). On the loss of alterity, Baudrillard is very clearly wrong, as the becomings-animal in Splice demonstrate: “the imaginary power and wealth of the double—the one in which the strangeness and at the same time the intimacy of the subject to itself are played out (heimlich/unheimlich)—rests on its immateriality, on the fact that it is and remains a phantasm” (Simulacra 95). Baudrillard is prone to hyperbole, but on this point he is correct in that in post-biological and post- evolutionary Western culture, these concepts are technoscientifically contingent </page> <page sequence="11"> 130 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 41 (2014) and, when involved in becomings-animal, lose a certainty hitherto ironically guaranteed by their de-ontological, representational status. The becoming- animal of the nonhuman animal hybrid puts the Oedipal coordinates in flux.  The issue of the nonhuman arises again with regard to becoming-animal. Implicit in each of these sex acts is no small degree of bestiality. Margaret Grebowicz says of pornography depicting sex acts between human and nonhuman animals, or “zoo porn,” that “[i]ntense anthropomorphism fuels these narratives, rather than the eroticization of the power of humans over animals” (1, 2). While Splice is no zoo-porn film, the becomings-animal are asignifactory, and thus tend to confound anthropomorphism and, regarding consent and desire, anthropocentricism. With regard to cloning, Baudrillard implies that the informatization of the body in the form of genetic codes renders useless the word “species,” although it has never been precise in biological discourse (Rollin 38), nor is DNA species-specific (Haddow et al. 13). Dren is neither species specific, nor entirely a human or nonhuman animal, and is thus best understood as a becoming-animal. Rethinking the Frankenstein Barrier. It is the nonhuman animal hybrid, and its becoming-animal made possible by these technoscientific conditions, that reworks the Frankenstein barrier. Slusser’s formula is human-centered—it is, after all, the Frankenstein, rather than the Frankenstein barrier. Frankenstein denies the monster his wish, but it is Frankenstein’s future that is denied, his “family, friendship, marriage” (Slusser 48), as he subsumes the monster through its Oedipalization. The monster is also, for Slusser, a “thing of fiction” (48), and it is evident in Baudrillard that this is precisely where the power of the Doppelgänger, and thus the Oedipalized monster, resides. This is where Dren’s becoming-animal (nonhuman animal hybrid rather than human) is distinct from that in Frankenstein and evades or disrupts the obstacles of the human and the uncanny Doppelgänger.  There is yet another Oedipal twist that further reworks the Frankenstein barrier by way of becoming-animal. As in Frankenstein, the hybrid in Splice turns Oedipal, not at the whim of the creator, but rather when a masculinized Dren has sex with Elsa. Realizing the Oedipal narrative, Dren kills Clive and impregnates Elsa, although Elsa kills Dren immediately thereafter. It is precisely through the “unnatural participations” of becoming-animal (Deleuze and Guattari Thousand 242) that Splice successfully breaks the Frankenstein barrier, in that the hybrid is able to reproduce. Deleuze and Guattari do, of course, note that the schizo “may even accept the banal Oedipal code, so long as he can stuff it full of all the disjunctions that this code was designed to eliminate” (Anti-Oedipus 15). Splice reconfigures the intertwinement of futurity and Oedipal repression entailed in the Frankenstein barrier: the becoming-animal of the nonhuman scrambles the latter in order to achieve the former. Yet this success comes at the expense of Dren’s life because becomings-animal are always transitory, “fragments of tales” rather than narratives: “a line of becoming has neither beginning nor end, departure nor arrival, origin nor destination ... only a middle” (Deleuze and Guattari </page> <page sequence="12"> BIOCAPITALISM AND SCHIZOPHRENIA 131 Thousand 293). They are in-between things: major/minor, identity/non- identity, rhizomatic/arborscent, molar/molecular. In other words, becomings are always unfinished. This is why Deleuze and Guattari say that “when a text deals essentially with a becoming-animal, it cannot be developed into a novel” (Kafka 38)—or, in this case, a film. A caveat provided by Baudrillard highlights the place of the nonhuman animal hybrid in biocapitalism, further distinguishing how the Frankenstein barrier has been significantly changed, and how it can be reconceptualized in twenty-first century scientific practice. In “The Animals: Territory and Metamorphoses,” Baudrillard notes parenthetically of Deleuze and Guattari that it is “paradoxical” to “take the animal as model of deterritorialization when he is the territorial being par excellence” (Simulacra 137). He calls becomings-animal “liberatory phantasmagoria” and asserts “[t]hat animals wander is a myth, and the current representation of the unconscious and of desire as erratic and nomadic belongs to the same order” (Simulacra 140). Deleuze and Guattari’s becomings-animal are, for Baudrillard, anticipations of capital rather than oppositions to it, “because they dream of total deterritorialization where the system never imposes anything but what is relative: the demand for ‘liberty’ is never anything but going further than the system, but in the same direction” (Simulacra 141).10 This is evident in Splice’s conclusion. Dren’s corpse is excavated for its genetic codes—“we’ll be filing patents for years,” says Joan—and pregnant Elsa elects to keep the child, selling both it and herself to Newstead Pharma for a large sum. Hybrid transgression becomes not only naturalized by capitalist ideology, but also essential to its continued existence. Becomings-animal are not the sublime concepts to which Haraway objects; rather, they are material and thus can be folded into the logic of biocapitalism. Returning to Latour, we note his suggestion that “those who think the most about hybrids circumscribe them as much as possible, whereas those who choose to ignore them by insulating them from any dangerous consequences develop them to the utmost” (41). As Simon During has pointed out, the hybrid is easily understood as an institutionalized and ideologically necessary transgression (7) and this is not dissimilar to Cary Wolfe’s assertion that humanism is adept at a “pluralism” that incorporates the previously marginalized in ways that leave itself unaffected, and, indeed, more influential (99). Gary K. Wolfe has observed that in sf, “[i]deally, the monster is not simply annihilated, it is appropriated; its defeat serves to broaden the dominion of human knowledge and power” (200). This movement towards appropriation hold true in Splice, and Dren’s death will provide a host of new technoscientific possibilities that can be exploited. Frankenstein is thus no longer synonymous with the misapplication of Western science, or with modernism; rather, science, capital, and ideology implode and endorse hybrid transgressions, only to accommodate them and thereby extend their influence. Splice erects a very different barrier to that maintained in Frankenstein: one that demands the future. The Frankenstein barrier is still informed by psychoanalytical valences, but the emphasis on the promise of the future </page> <page sequence="13"> 132 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 41 (2014) changes significantly: it is no longer guaranteed a positive value now that its horizon is the bioeconomy. If this barrier is to be broken anew, future hybrids must seek ways to exist outside of biocapital, while still owing to it their existence. NOTES 1. In When Species Meet, Haraway writes: “Despite the keen competition, I am not sure I can find in philosophy a clearer display of misogyny, fear of aging, incuriosity about animals, and horror at the ordinariness of flesh, here covered by the alibi of an anti-Oedipal and anticapitalist project. It took some nerve for D&amp;G to write about becoming-woman just a few pages later!” (30). Deleuze and Guattari are critical of anthropocentrism in its Oedipal form, but according to Haraway they are romantic in their anthropomorphism. She objects to Deleuze and Guattari’s distaste for domestic pets, although they note that “every animal is fundamentally a band, a pack,” but there are “varying degrees” that “make it easier or harder to discover the multiplicity” (Thousand 239, 241).  2. See Steven Forry’s Hideous Progenies for a comprehensive, although now likely outdated, taxonomy. 3. Similarly, Turney states that the “story has had a life beyond the original book, evolving in ways which are hard to pin down exactly, although they are equally hard not to notice” and that these adaptations “achieve a recognizability which is not attached to any particular version or medium” (26-7). Within the context of sf, Tatiana Chernyshova’s concept of science-as-myth allows us to locate the Frankenstein narrative within the blurring of science and sf Sheryl Hamilton observes. 4. This image can be found online by searching on the author’s name and the image title. 5. Roger Luckhurst, drawing on Latour, observes that there “is no such thing as ‘pure’ science, because these are the laboratories that have to seek the most funding, the most governmental and industrial support” (7). This marks a transition from “autonomous” science to research, which is “the imbrication of science, culture, and economy” (10). Splice is situated in the transition from science to research emblematic of the difference between the initial intentions of Frankenstein and the research-directed motivations of Clive and Elsa. 6. Deleuze and Guattari’s notion of affect is, for Jussi Parikka, an essential aspect of what he calls a “neomaterialism” that searches for meaning beyond the linguistic turn. Affect, in this sense, is useful to the study of nonhuman animals. He writes: “This is what I find a crucial point in the field of animal studies and posthumanism as well: we must not get stuck with the question concerning language and the defining differences (usually in terms of language) that remove the animal from the cultural. Instead we should map the differing modalities of expression of animal bodies that point toward asignifying semiotics” (xxv). 7. Dren’s continuous metamorphoses elude the interpretation of the hybrid as a dialectical molar identity, one between two molar identities, and the composite mix of DNA from various animals physiologically intimates a “generalised animalism” (Wells 122) more convincingly than the Beast People of Island of Doctor Moreau (1896), who, by contrast are examples of molar hybrids such as Puma Woman. 8. See Beaulieu, Flieger, and Grosz for a discussion of the meanings and limitations of the concept of becoming-woman. 9. On the evocation of Lacan, it might be useful to note Wolfe’s assessment of Lacanian disciple Slavoj Žižek, for whom “‘the animal’ is already simply a metonymy </page> <page sequence="14"> BIOCAPITALISM AND SCHIZOPHRENIA 133 either for the Lacanian Real or, in the case of Pets, for the Symbolic” making him, according to Wolfe, “humanist and anthropocentric in his inability to rethink ... the ‘distribution’ of subjectivity across species lines” (125). 10. Baudrillard also asserts this in an interview, “Forget Baudrillard,” in Forget Foucault. While he expresses enthusiasm for metamorphoses, he suggests that Deleuze’s becomings-animal and becomings-woman are nothing more than entwinements of mythology and metaphor (75). Baudrillard’s concept of seduction, however, entailing the becoming-woman-object, wavers between essentialism and a non-fixity not entirely dissimilar to Deleuze and Guattari’s becoming-woman (96). See also Baudrillard’s Seduction (1990). A similar, albeit more sustained, critique of Deleuze’s relationship with capitalism is Žižek’s Organs Without Bodies (2004).

ABSTRACT Deleuze and Guattari’s becomings-animal are particularly useful in rethinking George Slusser’s “Frankenstein barrier”: the point at which the sf story folds back upon itself through the denial of futurity, which is accompanied by a regression into Oedipal relations. By analyzing and contrasting Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein and Vincenzo Natali’s Splice, this essay argues that while the denial of futurity is Victor Frankenstein’s as much as the monster’s, the barrier is nevertheless an anthropocentric one. The essay examines the possibilities opened up by the becoming-animal of the nonhuman, and explores how this reworks the Frankenstein barrier in twenty-first century technoscientific biocapitalism. </page> </plain_text>
