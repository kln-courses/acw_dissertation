Thus The Book of Changes states: "In the remote past, people buried the dead in the open field under thick brushwood, without constructing tumuli or planting trees. The period of mourning was also not regulated. The later sages then replaced this ancient custom with inner and outer coffins."1 The same idea also underscores the first narrative of the history of mortuary architecture: Zhao Zi of the second century c.e. considered the invention of the coffin the single most important event in the history of tombs; all later developments of the tomb only elaborated upon the notion and form of the coffin, which, in a rudimentary but highly conceptual manner, first materialized and stabilized a special space for the dead.2 Zhao attributed the invention of the coffin to the Yellow Emperor, a legendary ruler in antiquity who is also described in Han texts as the inventor of ritual and of statecraft.3 Following the Yellow Emperor, according to Zhao, the royal house of the Western Zhou (eleventh-eighth centuries b.c.e.), multiplied the layers of coffins and embellished them with surface decoration. Subsequently, the powerful warlords of the Eastern Zhou (eighth-third centuries b.c.e.), constructed large, luxurious mausoleums for themselves, "squandering a handsome sum from state coffers in the realm of the Three Springs (that is, the underground)."4 Modern archaeology has basically confirmed this development outlined by Zhao Zi. Based on scientific excavations, we now know that timber coffins had appeared in China by at least the fourth millennium b.c.e. during the late Neolithic period,5 that the aristocratic coffins of the Western Zhou were covered with patterned fabric called huangwei, and that the coffins of the Eastern Zhou began to have decorative and symbolic images marked directly on their surfaces. These early timber coffins are the subject of Alain Thote's chapter in this volume, which surveys Chinese coffins from the first millennium b.c.e. and analyzes the symbolism of some decorated examples. Over the next two thousand years, the Chinese continued to favor timber coffins as the dominant form of burial equipment while also creating stone sarcophagi during specific periods and in particular areas, such as during the Han dynasty (206 b.c.e.-220 c.e.) on the East Coast and in the Sichuan Basin, and again from the late Northern Dynasties to the High Tang period (roughly sixth-eighth centuries) in north China. A considerable number of stone sarcophagi are richly decorated with mythological and narrative scenes, which are generally absent on timber coffins. From a macroscopic historical perspective, what we find here are two interacting traditions of coffins, the development of which followed two distinct patterns. The dominance and omnipresence of timber coffins were occasionally challenged by stone sarcophagi, whose distinctive material, decoration, and architectural form defined them as special ritual objects. Such self-conscious distinction, in turn, implied specific customs, identities, and intentions on the part of the users of these objects.6 In other words, although stone sarcophagi never constituted a continuous historical form as timber coffins did, their intermittent bursting onto the scene betrays a different kind of historical logic and leads us to seek the specific historical forces that gave rise to their creation. This article focuses on the first appearance of the stone sarcophagus in China. During the period from the second century b.c.e. to the early third century c.e., stone coffins emerged in two regions, first in the Shandong/Jiangsu region on the East Coast and then in the Sichuan region in the southwest (fig. 1). Sometimes carved with pictorial images, these Han dynasty 1. "Yi jing" (Book of Changes), in Shisanjing zhushu (an annotated edition of the Thirteen Classics), ed. RuanYuan (Beijing, 1980), p. 87. 2.

How did these two regions receive connection may not be accidental—I will suggest later cultural influences from outside? Definitive answers to that in making stone coffins and other stone mortuary these questions are perhaps still beyond our reach.

Instead of conveying the same meaning as the original foreign works, however, the new material and „ . , , , . . ., . b , ■ , ι , ■ ,· ι ι Body and soul, surface and depth imported images helped express indigenous ideas about death, the posthumous soul, and immortality. From this There is a fundamental paradox in the function of a perspective, the Han sarcophagi resulted from a cultural Chinese coffin, and consequently in a coffin's design and fusion: Carrying on the function of timber coffins in decoration. This paradox was rooted in the ambivalent ritual practice, they also updated such practice with new, concept of the "remains" of the dead, which a coffin contemporary elements. was made to contain. On the one hand, the professed My second focus is the consistency and the function of the coffin was to conceal and protect the variations to be found among Han sarcophagi physical body of the dead. So an ancient text offers themselves. Why did stone coffins flourish in these this standard definition of the tomb: "Burying means two geographically separate regions in Han China? hiding away; and that hiding [of the corpse] is from a What are the relationships between these two regional wish that men should not see it. Hence there are the traditions of sarcophagi in terms of their decoration, clothes sufficient for embellishing the body; the coffins pictorial program, and religious associations? Did they all around the clothes; the casket all around the coffins; emerge as a single development, or as two separate the earth all around the casket; and a mound further</page><page sequence="4">Wu: Han sarcophagi 199 raised over that grave with trees planted on it."7 This understanding naturally inspired people to construct the tomb, and coffin, as self-contained units, which would be as strong and opaque as possible. It was in this spirit that Emperor Wen of the Western Han went to inspect his burial site in the early second century b.c.e. When he saw his tomb—the first recorded imperial tomb constructed inside a rocky hill—he sighed with satisfaction: "Oh! Using stone from the Northern Mountains to make my coffin, securing it with linen cloth and again gluing the cloth with lacquer, how can the coffin still be shaken!"8 On the other hand, the ancient Chinese also believed that a person's posthumous remains included not only his physical body but also his invisible soul. According to this idea, a living person's soul is united with his body, providing him with intelligence, emotion, senses, and the capability to act. Death then results from the detachment of the soul from the body, an event which turns a man from a living organism to a lifeless corpse.9 This belief was given a more rational form during the Eastern Zhou, when Confucian ritualists developed a theory of "twin souls" called hurt and po. In this theory, only the hurt, the "heavenly" soul, flies away when death occurs, while the po, the "earthly" or "bodily" soul, stays with the corpse in the tomb.10 The survival of both souls would depend on continuous nourishment provided by living family members in the form of ritual offerings both inside and outside the tomb. As the recipient of such offerings, the posthumous souls were imagined as autonomous entities with the ability to move. Even the heavier and less active po soul should be able to travel inside a grave to enjoy the offerings and to occupy various chambers that mimicked sections of a living household. To facilitate such movement, therefore, a solid coffin had to be redefined as being flexible and penetrable, as well as being a space of confinement. Its separation of the interior and exterior spaces could not be absolute, but was to be negotiated by the soul's movement. Such negotiation then became a central motivation behind the various designs and decorations applied to a coffin's surface. The easiest—but by no means the ideal—solution to the dual function of the coffin appeared as a forced compromise: The walls of some urn-shaped Neolithic pottery coffins from the sixth to fifth millennium b.c.e. had round holes drilled in them." Whereas a hole would permit the soul to move in and out of the coffin, it also diminished the coffin's role of concealing and protecting the body. This dilemma was solved by providing the dead with double coffins with different designs, as we find in the famous Leigudun Tomb 1 at Suixian, Hubei province.12 In the tomb's east chamber, a set of two coffins contained the remains of Marquis Yi of the State of Zeng, who died in the late fifth century b.c.e. Based on the objects found in the tomb's four chambers, scholars have identified these spaces as underground counterparts of the Marquis's residence, including a formal audience hall, a private quarter, a harem, and an arsenal. Small openings on the interior walls linked these separated rooms into a continuum. These openings were likely prepared for the Marquis's soul to move around inside his grave—a hypothesis supported by the design of his double coffins. The outer coffin, a formidable structure of over seven tons, is constructed of thick hardwood around a bronze framework. Given how strong and solid this coffin is, it is surprising to find a rectangular hole, thirty four centimeters tall and twenty-five centimeters wide, near the bottom of the coffin's headboard. "Openings" were also created on the inner coffin. Instead of cutting real holes, however, the designer painted doors on the coffin's two long sides and flanked them with 7.

I have discussed these carvings in a previous study and have suggested that they together represent an early version of the "White Ape" legend, which later became the subject of a famous Tang tale.15 In the story, Ouyang He, a general in the government army, was sent to the southern frontier on campaign. One night, his wife was spirited away from a locked room and no trace of her could be found. Grief-stricken, Ouyang spent months in search of her. Finally he entered a heavily wooded area and found a mysterious garden on a sheer cliff; more than a score of women lived there. They told him that they had all been abducted by a great white ape, and that his wife lay sick in a cave. The story ends with the slaying of the ape: The captive women disclosed the ape's secret weakness, allowing Ouyang to destroy it with his sword. Whereas the vivid depiction of the story has its own artistic and narrative value engraved on a sarcophagus, it also conveys the desire to protect the dead by warding off evil spirits. Icons A very different visual logic separates "icons" from the narrative scenes discussed above. No temporal sequence or dramatic effect is pursued here; instead, these isolated images all depict subjects that transcend time and space. Sometimes the carvers labeled these images with cartouches, as we find on a second century c.e. sarcophagus from Guitoushan in Jianyang, Sichuan (fig. 4).16 Among the many images carved on 15.

Several other images are identified as cosmic symbols, including the sun and the moon, directional animals (a tortoise, a dragon, and a "white tiger"), and the two cosmic deities Fuxi and Nüwa. There are also symbols of immortality—two winged fairies playing chess (labeled xianren bo) and another immortal riding on a horse (labeled xianren qi). A fourth category of images symbolizes wealth and prosperity: A raised two-story building, the "Grand Granary" (taicang), is envisioned to supply the dead with inexhaustible food; a "white pheasant" (baizhi), a "cassia-coin-tree" (guizhu), and a beast called a lili typify three basic kinds of auspicious omens, each drawn from the animal, bird, or plant kingdom. Among the icons carved on the Guitoushan sarcophagus, the union of Fuxi and Nüwa was especially prominent in the Sichuan area during the second century and customarily appears on the rear end of a coffin. The two images read almost like a diagram of yin and yang, the two universal forces in Han cosmology (fig. 5). This symbolism is suggested not only by the different genders of the two deities but also by the celestial orbs they hold: Fuxi supports the sun with his right hand and Nüwa supports the moon with her left hand. Inside the moon is a hare, and inside the sun, a bird. According to ancient Chinese mythology, these creatures inhabit the cosmic symbols of the sun and moon. The perfect symmetry of these images signifies the opposition of yin and yang, whereas the joining tails of Fuxi and Nüwa further alludes to the interaction and transformation of these cosmic forces. Another major deity frequently depicted on Sichuan sarcophagi is Xiwangmu, "Queen Mother of the West" (fig. 6). But instead of transforming a stone coffin into a microcosm of the universe like Fuxi and Nüwa do, she symbolizes eternal happiness in the realm of immortals. The tale of Xiwangmu may have developed from antiquity. During the Western Han she was further associated with Kunlun, a magical mountain to the West.

On a sarcophagus excavated at Shuangheya, Pengshan (fig. 6), there is the additional image of a woman who is entering the Queen Mother court while making an offering. This is probably a portrait of the dead, who is imagined to have achieved immortality after death. "Passages" Continuing the tradition of painting and constructing doors and windows in Eastern Zhou tombs, "passage" images constituted a dominant motif category on stone sarcophagi when this type of burial equipment first emerged on the East Coast. Zheng Yan's chapter in this volume offers a general introduction to these early examples. Briefly, the stone coffins from the East Coast found in present-day Shandong and northern Jiangsu— the earliest examples of such artifacts in China—have been dated from the second century b.c.e. to the first century c.e. No two sarcophagi repeat the same decoration, but all utilize the images of doors, gates, and perforated bi-disks, and all play up the tension between surface and depth, or between positive and negative spaces, in an increasingly complex manner. A relatively simple example in this group is a sarcophagus from Qishan Tomb 1 at Peixian in Jiangsu, which bears two groups of carvings on either of its two ends (fig. 7). One composition depicts a gate formed by two pillars, which marked the entrance to a formal architectural compound in ancient China. Two men flanking the gate are bowing their heads, as if paying homage to someone who is entering the gate, while a third figure stands in front of the gate, offering an object to the arriving guest. The other composition is centered on a circular b/'-disk, coupled with an animal mask to form a pushou image. Two gentlemen standing at either side of the bi seem to be holding it up with strings. Abundant evidence from Han tombs has revealed that a special jade bi was placed or painted next to the deceased to symbolize the passage of his or her posthumous soul.18 More specifically, with a circular hole in the middle, this ritual object or its image was believed to possess the magical power to guide the soul to leave the corpse and enter a higher realm. This belief is clearly disclosed by a number of second-century b.c.e. "jade suits"—actually constructed "jade bodies"—of 17. On the history of the Queen Mother of the West, see Wu Hung (see note 3), pp. 108-141. 18. I have discussed this symbolism of the b/'-disk in Han funerary art in "Yin hun ling bi" (the b/-disk as a conduit of the soul), in Wu Hung and Zheng Yan, eds., Gudai muzang meishu yanjiu (Studies on ancient tomb art), vol. 1 (Beijing, 2011), pp. 55-64.</page><page sequence="10">Wu: Han sarcophagi 205 Figure 7.

Inevitably, a bi-disk is installed on the top of the head, allowing the soul to leave the physical body.19 The famous silk banner from Mawangdui Tomb 1, again from the second century b.c.e., further provides a vivid pictorial account of the soul's posthumous transformation: Two scenes in the middle of the painting are framed by a pair of dragons, whose bodies intertwine while penetrating a large jade bi (see fig. 7 in Eugene Wang's essay in this volume). Below the disk and flanked by the dragons' tails, mourners are holding a funerary vigil, offering food and wine to the corpse of the deceased. Above the bi and flanked by the dragons' upper bodies and heads, the deceased woman re-emerges in all her vividness. I have proposed that this second image actually portrays the woman's soul, now freed from her temporal, material form.20 Separating yet connecting her body and soul, the jade bi and ascending dragons facilitate the transformation of the soul into a disembodied, eternal presence. Some timber coffins from Sichuan originally bore ¿/'-shaped copper plates, on which the circular disk is integrated with a gate motif, sometimes labeled as the Gate to Heaven. The additional images of immortals further clinch the meaning of the disk/gate combination as the entrance to a celestial paradise (see fig. 7a in Lillian Tseng's essay in this volume). Most stone sarcophagi from the region, however, are only carved with a gate on the front (fig. 8). Consisting of two pillars and called a que, this gate also marked the entrance to a Han cemetery along a road called the shendao, "the path of the soul." Historical records tell that during a royal funerary ceremony, a mourning procession carried the coffin of the deceased emperor through this gate, along the shendao, and then buried him in the tomb located at the end of the path. During monthly sacrifices, a procession escorted the crown and clothes of the emperor through this gate to his temple. There is little doubt that the pillar gate engraved on a sarcophagus has the same meaning, symbolizing the soul's passage into a spiritual world. This interpretation also explains why the pillar gate and a "greeting" figure must appear on the front of a sarcophagus, and why a rider is sometimes added: Holding a funerary banner, he is guiding the soul to enter the open gate (fig. 9). Posthumous realms As defined earlier, the fourth perceptual/conceptual mode of sarcophagus decoration is characterized by the combination of a symbolic passage and scenes of the imaginary afterlife. This mode thus both represents the soul's journey to the afterlife and transforms a sarcophagus into a microcosm of the universe, an underground "happy home," or an immortal paradise for the departing soul. A simple way to achieve this effect is to reconceptualize a liminal gate as a picture frame. One such example can be seen on the Shuangheya 19.

The subtle distinction between the que gate and the half-opened gate, however, seems to have largely vanished in the early third century. The best evidence for this change comes from a dated sarcophagus from Lushan, Sichuan (see fig. 1 in Lillian Tseng's essay in this volume). Found in a brick tomb in 1940, it bears an epitaph which reads: "The deceased Steward of Accounts, Wang Hui, styled Bozhao, died in the last decade of the ninth month of the sixteenth or xinmou year of the Jian'an era (c.e. 221). He was buried on the jianxu day of the sixth month of the seventeenth year (c.e. 222). Alas!" Compared to the complicated narrative scenes on some of the earlier sarcophagi, the decoration of this sarcophagus is considerably—and deliberately—simplified, consisting of a few isolated images rendered in round relief. On the front side, a figure emerges from a half opened door. Replacing a pillar gate in this position, the half-opened door now assumes the meaning of the entrance to a posthumous universe. This new significance is revealed by other images on the coffin: Two divine animals, the Blue Dragon and the White Tiger, are depicted in a symmetrical fashion on both sides, with similarly elongated bodies and arched tails. In Han cosmology these two beasts are symbols of the east and the west, respectively. Depicted on the rear is the composite symbol of a snake and a tortoise—the combined symbol of the north. These directional symbols constitute a three dimensional symbolic structure, transforming the stone box into a microcosm of the universe. But the half-opened door on this sarcophagus still subtly retains its traditional association with the idea of immortality: We find that the figure inside the gate has a wing growing from his shoulder, and feather patterns striating his leg. These features identify him as an immortal. So the cosmic space into which he is admitting the deceased also takes on the meaning of an immortal paradise. Contexts of stone sarcophagi in Han China Broadly speaking, the invention and development of stone sarcophagi in Han China was associated with three crucial changes from the late Eastern Zhou to the Han, in regard to (1) the changing conception of the posthumous soul, (2) the emerging idea of postmortem immortality, and (3) the intensified interaction between China and the outside world, including the introduction of Buddhist art and material culture. First, during this period, the concept of the posthumous soul underwent an important transformation. As mentioned earlier, a traditional theory about death was based on the dualism between the hun and po souls: The hun flies away when death occurs, while the po stays with the body in the tomb. This bipartite division of the soul was closely related to the temple/tomb dualism in traditional ancestral worship.23 A very significant passage in The Book of Rites records a conversation between Confucius and his student Zai Wo. In answering Zai Wo's question about the nature of ghosts and spirits, Confucius explains that "ghost" refers to the po, which remains underground after death, whereas the spirit, or hun, flies on high to become a divine being. "Once this opposition is established," the Master continued, "two kinds of rituals are framed in accordance and (different) sacrifices are regulated."24 Whereas temple sacrifices are offered to the heavenly existence of ancestors, grave sacrifices serve as a tribute to their earthly existence. Such distinctions between the two souls and related ritual services became obsolete during the Han or existed only in theory. Following the decline and obsolescence of the collective lineage temple, the hun and po were reunited in the graveyard. Numerous Han texts, including mortuary inscriptions found in tombs and on funerary shrines, reveal a new concept of the posthumous soul. As Ken Brashier has shown, in most Han sources, hun and po form a compound that simply means the soul, and the tomb is imagined as its dwelling place.25 Consequently, the tomb was reimagined as the soul's otherworldly dwelling, leading to the invention of the "chamber grave," which imitated the architecture of a household. The emergence of the stone sarcophagus around the same time was likewise inspired by the desire to construct an eternal home for both the hun and po. As we have found, pictorial carvings on a sarcophagus not only depict earthly delights such as eating and drinking, but also transform the stone box into a microcosm of the universe or a heavenly realm. 23.

Starting from the Han, however, a new belief in "postmortem immortality" prevailed.26 Images of immortal lands increasingly decorated tombs. Miraculous tales circulated, describing how ancient sages such as the Yellow Emperor ascended to heaven after having been buried in a grave. A certain Canon of Immortality (Xian jing) further classifies immortals into different ranks: While those of the higher ranks have the ability to defy death, those of the lowest rank "cannot avoid death and have to shed their physical shells like a cicada."27 According to this new belief, instead of preventing a person from achieving immortality, death actually offers an alternative route to reach paradise. This idea soon attracted millions of people of different classes, mainly because it finally guaranteed the possibility of immortality without demanding laborious effort. No external proof was required to demonstrate the magical transformation taking place in the tomb. Or, such proof could be produced through art by embellishing a tomb or coffin to make it a fantastic immortal land. Third, following the establishment of the Han, a rapid territorial expansion toward the West fundamentally changed China's relationship with the rest of the world. This historical process may have already begun in the early Han,28 but it only culminated during the reign of Emperor Wu (141-87 b.c.e.), who made use of the strength accumulated in the early years of the dynasty to double the size of his empire. By defeating the Huns in a series of campaigns, the Chinese armies pushed ever farther towards the West across Central Asia until they finally confronted the Roman Empire. Two highways to make the Silk Road were established; the one north of the Heavenly Mountains ran through the Gobi Desert to Balkash, while the one south of the mountains led across theTarim Basin to Kashgar and Khotan. "Over both roads came Western ideas and art . motifs to be incorporated into but never to dominate the Chinese aesthetic canon."29 Two other international routes originating from China's East Coast and the Southwest, respectively, traversed the vast ocean and deep mountain gorges to connect the Han empire with the Indian world. Several aspects of Han sarcophagi are likely related to this profound historical process—their material, timing, geographical distribution, and patrons. I have written extensively on the "Chinese discovery" of stone from the second century b.c.e. to the first century c.e., connecting this phenomenon with new trends in Han religion and with people's fascination for the mysterious West.30 Briefly, it was at the height of the westward expansion of the Han Empire that the Chinese began to employ stone in making statues, funerary monuments, and sarcophagi.3' At the same time they also made frequent connections between four essential elements in Han religion and religious art, namely, immortality, the West, stone, and death. As the search for eternal happiness— including postmortem immortality—dominated Han religious thought, people also increasingly oriented their longing and search toward the space beyond the desert and high mountains. To them, not only were the magical mountain Kunlun and the Queen Mother of the West both located there, but a horse from the West was called a "heavenly horse," and a tribute elephant, "a passenger of the gods."32 These two beasts are portrayed on a chariot ornament made in central China at the beginning of the first century b.c.e. (fig. 11 a on page 196);33 their similarities with images found in present-day Pakistan (fig. 11 b on page 210) prove that before this time, 26. See I.

After Wu Hong, Liyi zhong de meishu (Beijing: Sanlian chubanshe, 2005), vol. 1, 16-18, 16-20. certain Indian art motifs had been brought to China and copied there. The knowledge of stone monuments and sculptures and of cave temples and cliff tombs may have reached China around the same time and inspired local practice. Significantly, when people of the Han adopted this material, they used it only for religious buildings and sculptures dedicated to the gods and the dead. A stone tomb or coffin was therefore created to confirm its association with death, immortality, and the West. When stone sarcophagi first emerged in southern Shandong and northern Jiangsu around the second and first centuries b.c.e., local princes in this area also constructed "cliff tombs" for themselves (see fig. 1). Built inside rocky hills, these enormous burials are sometimes over thirty meters long and consist of dozens of chambers. Neither this burial type nor the stone sarcophagus originated in China, but both can be traced to the regions west of the Han empire. Interestingly, when the stone sarcophagus was resurrected in Sichuan in the second century c.e., it was again accompanied by the popularity of cliff tombs in the region (fig. 12). The recurrent coexistence of these two burial forms on the East Coast and in Sichuan directs us to uncover an important factor shared by these two regions. Textual and archaeological evidence reveals that within the Han empire, the East Coast and the Sichuan area were under the strongest Buddhist influence; such influence in turn contributed to the emergence of religious Taoism in these two places. Although we are still unable to determine how early Buddhism had reached China, we do know that Liu Ying, a ruler of the Chu principality who held court at Pengcheng in present-day northern Jiangsu, "observed fasting and performed sacrifices to the Buddha" in the first century.34 These and other records have led Eric Zürcher to argue that "around the middle of the first century AD Buddhism appears already to have penetrated into the region north of the Huai River, in eastern Henan, southern Shandong and northern Jiangsu."35 This is an important observation for the present study, because the area that Zürcher outlines overlaps exactly with the region in which the first group of stone sarcophagi and cliff tombs has been found. This is not to say that there is a direct relationship between these burial forms and Buddhism. Rather, it suggests that the arrival of Buddhism was not an isolated event, but was related to the introduction of other cultural phenomena and their impact on local ritual practices. It is possible that certain architectonic forms related to Buddhism and Indian culture, such as rock-cut sanctuaries and stone reliquaries, had influenced the local population on the East Coast even before Liu Ying formally embraced the foreign religion. As Zheng Yan notes in his text in this volume, the earliest stone coffins in Shandong and Jiangsu typically belonged to small and mid-sized tombs, indicating the attraction of such alien forms for common people. Similarly, there existed a strong link between Sichuan and Buddhist art during the later Han. In fact, although Buddhist motifs have been found in different parts of Han China, images of the Buddha appeared in this southwest region in greater number and more authentic form.36 These images include, for example, two relief carvings in cliff tombs at Mahao and Siziwan in Leshan (fig. 13), and miniature icons on bronze "money trees." The iconographic features of these images, such as the hand gesture, the halo, and the usnfsa, directly link them to Indian prototypes created at Mathura and Gandhára in the second century.37 Given the frequency of such images in Sichuan during the second and early third centuries, however, it is curious that no text records the practice of 34. Fan Ye, Hou Han shu (History of the Eastern Han), (Beijing, 1965), pp. 1428-1429. Evidence for Liu Ying's worship of the Buddha is also found in an edict issued by Emperor Ming: "The King of Ch'u recites the subtle words of Huang-lao, and respectfully performs the gentle sacrifices to the Buddha. After three months of purification and fasting, he has made a solemn covenant (or: a vow) with the spirits. What dislike or suspicion (from Our part) could there be, that he must repent (of his sins)? Let (the silk which he sent for) redemption be sent back, in order thereby to contribute to the lavish entertainment of the upásakas and sramanas." Trans, from E.

His grandson Zhang Lu further became a Taoist ruler in Sichuan and southern Shaanxi for some thirty years, during which Taoism became the dominant religion in this southwest region. Zhang Ling's connection with the East Coast (which also developed into a stronghold of religious Taoism in the second century) may explain the re-emergence of stone sarcophagi in Sichuan. Indeed, although these two regional traditions of sarcophagi were separated by a temporal gap, the many shared elements in their decoration, including both individual motifs and large pictorial programs, link them into a single development. The dominance of Taoism in Sichuan also explains the nature of the Buddhist images found there. It is an established fact that when religious Taoism first emerged in the second century, it utilized many elements from Buddhism, from the Buddha's miraculous tales to icon worship. The Buddha images from Sichuan did not furnish Buddhist sanctuaries, but instead decorated tombs and "money trees" (local ritual objects possibly used for Taoist-related purposes). In all cases, these images aimed at strengthening the pursuit of immortality or enriching the emerging Taoist pantheon. In fact, if the East Coast sarcophagi reflect an early stage of cultural interaction between China and the outside world, the Sichuan sarcophagi may have been part of a Taoist visual and material culture. In a previous essay, I compared the documented locations of major centers of Heavenly Master Taoism with the distribution patterns of major types of religious images and objects in Sichuan art, including the cliff tomb, the sarcophagus, the "money tree," and images of the Queen Mother of the West and the Buddha. The comparison showed that two "maps"—one of a regional religious tradition and the other of a ritual art tradition—clearly overlap. A closer examination of special images on selected sarcophagi, such as the portraits of Taoist priests and a symbol called a sheng, further substantiated theTaoist identity of their users.38 To sum up, this paper has examined Han dynasty sarcophagi from three different but interrelated angles. The first is to relate these examples to the painted timber coffins of the Eastern Zhou. As early as the fifth century b.c.e., the design of some timber coffins already reflected a tension between surface and depth, which would persist in the decoration of stone sarcophagi. Rooted in the Chinese conception of an autonomous soul after death, this tension manifested itself most clearly in the creation of "passages" on a coffin's surface. Either portrayed as an empty door or as a jade disk with a hole in the middle, these special images made a solid sarcophagus "transparent" and "penetrable" to facilitate the soul's movement in and out. At the same time, a three-dimensional sarcophagus was also conceived as an eternal home of the dead, transformed accordingly into a metaphorical space, which offered posthumous security, prosperity, and immortality. This basic understanding led me to distinguish a number of perceptual/conceptual modes in sarcophagus decoration. Differing from a typological, iconographical, or stylistic classification, these modes emphasize the viewer's visual experience and cultural understanding of images on sarcophagi. A pictorial composition, for example, illustrates the "White Ape" tale with a vivid narrative representation, but it also helps ward off all sorts of evil spirits on a more abstract, symbolic level. A que gate can be an isolated icon pertaining to the boundary separating this life and the next, but it can also be used to frame other images and define the latter as concrete representations of the afterlife. Instead of focusing on an image per se, a perceptual/ conceptual mode connects the viewer to the meaning of a sarcophagus. It is both a cultural product and an embodiment of cultural experience. This finally led me to interpret Han sarcophagi within two broad contexts, one ideological and the other historical. The former is related to an important development in Han religious thought. In particular, the changing notions of the soul and immortality provide a foundation from which to understand the invention of stone sarcophagi and their pictorial programs. The other context is the Western expansion of the Han empire, which brought home new knowledge of the West, including stone monuments and statues, anthropomorphic gods, and the religion of Buddhism. These two contexts inform us about the general historical, cultural, and religious conditions of Han sarcophagi, and also provide information about regional uses of sarcophagi for specific purposes. 38.
