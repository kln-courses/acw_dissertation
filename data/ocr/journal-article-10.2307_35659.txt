FERSHT Department of Chemistry, Imperial College of Science and Technology, London S W7 2A Y, U.K. (Lecture delivered 9 April 1981 - Typescript received 9 April 1981) The evolution of stable forms of life requires considerable precision in the transfer and utilization of genetic information. The necessary precision is often beyond the limits of even the high specificity expected of enzymes and has been achieved by the coevolution of special enzymic mechanisms that involve the expenditure of some of the energy of the cell. The exquisite fidelity of the genetic coding process is maintained during the replication of DNA and the synthesis of proteins by editing reactions that remove errors. Without these checks, mutation rates would be unaccept- ably high and proteins largely heterogeneous. The editing mechanisms of amino acid selection during protein synthesis are discussed and used to exemplify the essential features of editing. An incidental result of these studies has been to reveal unexpectedly high binding energies between the side chains of amino acids and the enzymes responsible for their selection. This necessitates a re-evaluation of the forces responsible for the folding and assembly of proteins. The fidelity of DNA replication is now amenable to study by a combination of kinetic and genetic techniques by replicating in vitro DNA from a bacteriophage (+X174) and assaying the products by expression in vivo. This has afforded the first measurements of the nature and frequency of the base mispairings that lead to spontaneous mutation. These indicate that the accuracy of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase is the limiting factor determining the rate of spontaneous mutation of the single-stranded DNA bacteriophage. The more accurate replication of the E. coli chromosome requires a post-replicative mismatch repair system, special to double-stranded DNA. A simple relation between the accuracy gained by editing and the cost in terms of the wasteful hydrolysis of the correct products, the cost-selectivity equation, is presented that rationalizes some of the mechanisms and observations. The specificity of enzymes has long excited the imagination of chemists and biochemists. Gowland Hopkins, for example, in his Anniversary Address to this Society in 1932, remarked in almost anthropomorphic terms of the power of enzymes to select and direct metabolic pathways. Yet, a quarter of a century later, the advent of molecular biology stimulated the discovery of classes of enzymes, namely those involved in the replication of DNA and the synthesis of proteins, that display specificities so remarkable that the common metabolic enzymes appear almost feeble in comparison. The early protein sequencing studies of Sanger showed that proteins are homogeneous. Loftfield (1 963), while visiting Cambridge, was able 13 [ 351 ] vo0 . z'a. B (i 9 August I 98 i)</page><page sequence="2">352 A. R. Fersht to demonstrate that the overall error rate of protein synthesis is no worse than one mistake in 3000 amino acid residues incorporated. This includes all the errors of base pairing in transcribing the DNA to mRNA and matching up the codon and anticodon on the ribosome, and the errors of selection of amino acid and tRNA by the amino acid activating enzymes. Genetic experiments on Escherichia coli indicate an error rate in the replication of its DNA of only one mistake of 108 101o nucleotides polymerized. The specificity required to give such accuracy is so high that it is beyond the capabilities of simple metabolic enzymes and is only possible because of the evolution of editing or proofreading mechanisms. Many of the key enzymes involved in biosynthetic polymerization are multifunctional, having an additional hydrolytic activity which is used to excise incorrect intermediates as they are formed. This enables the addition of each monomer to be screened twice, once during synthesis and again during proofreading. In addition, because in double-stranded DNA the encoded information is duplicated, there is the possibility of removing errors by repair enzymes which excise the mistake from one strand and use the complementary information in the other to insert the correct nucleotide or base. It will be seen later that the evolution of higher forms of life and efficient lower forms has required the coevolution of editing or proofreading activities. The investigation of the enzymic mechanisms used to achieve extremely high specificity has required the development and refinement of new experimental techniques and has spawned novel ideas. Koshland's (1958) induced fit theory, for example, was originally formulated to account for the selection of amino acids during protein synthesis. Information has also been given about the limits of complementary interactions between biological molecules which affords new insights into some concepts in physical chemistry. It is the aim of this Review Lecture to outline the problems involved, their theoretical analysis, the experi- mental approaches used and their results. The major emphasis is on a kinetic approach. This is particularly appropriate because the biological problems involved are concerned essentially with frequencies and rates: the rate of accumu- lation of errors and mutations depends upon the rates of competing reactions in the cell. THE NEED FOR ACCURACY IN PROCESSING AND REPLICATING THE GENETIC CODE It is self evident that the replication of DNA must be carried out with sufficient precision to conserve the genetic information and avoid gross rates of mutation, and that protein synthesis must be sufficiently precise to form functional proteins and enzymes. The consequences of the effects of errors have been analysed in greater depth than this, however, because of their relationship to the phenomenon of ageing in multicellular organisms and their role in evolution.</page><page sequence="3">Review Lecture 353 (a) Accuracy of protein synthesis: 'error catastrophe' and cell senescence There are two contrasting theories of ageing in multicellular organisms: 'pro- gramming', ageing is a genetic process, a consequence of differentiation, and is the final stage of development; 'random error', lifespan is limited by an accumulation of errors to a catastrophic level in the cell (see Kirkwood (I980), and for a brief discussion see Hill &amp; Franks (I977) and Holliday (I977)). The second of these theories, the 'error catastrophe' hypothesis was formulated by Orgel (i 963, I 970, 1973). It is elegantly simple: the protein synthetic machinery is itself made of protein and so is responsible for its own production. Any imprecision in protein synthesis will lead to the production of a protein synthetic machinery of lowered accuracy which in turn will lead to the production of an even less precise machinery. There is thus the positive feedback of error into the protein synthetic machinery that if sufficiently high will lead to instability: an increasing rate of production of defective proteins and enzymes leads to an accelerating deterioration of the cell, climaxing in the cell death or lack of function. Orgel was careful to point out that the accumulation of errors in protein synthesis is not necessarily 'the mechanism of ageing' but is one source of progressive decrease in cell efficiency. For this point alone, irrespective of its role in ageing, protein synthesis must be conducted with a sufficient degree of accuracy to maintain a stable system. Thus, during the evolution of unicellular organisms, selection would have favoured those primitive cells with the most accurate protein synthetic machinery. (b) Accuracy of DNA replication The accuracy of DNA replication and the accuracy of protein synthesis are coupled phenomena in that inaccurate replication of DNA will lead to the production of defective proteins while inaccurate protein synthesis will lead to the production of DNA polymerases and DNA processing enzymes of lowered fidelity (Holliday &amp; Tarrant 1972). The criteria of the previous sections thus apply to the fidelity of DNA replication in the avoidance of error catastrophe. More important, however, is that inaccurate replication of DNA leads to a permanent change in the encoded information, that is, mutation. There exists a balance of pressures on the accuracy of replication, on the one hand to preserve the gene as an intact replicating unit, and, on the other hand, to be sufficiently imprecise that the rate of spontaneous mutation will be sufficiently high to evolve or adapt to a changing environment. Mutation rates have thus presumably evolved to an optimal level. They are certainly under genetic control as evinced by the existence of more rapidly mutating strains (mutator mutants) of Escherichia coli (Treffers et al. 1954) and Drosophila (Siegel &amp; Bryson I964). In addition to mutator strains of bacteriophage T4, there are also antimutator mutants that mutate less rapidly (Drake 1973). The gene product responsible for the mutator/antimutator properties of T4 mutants has been identified as the DNA polymerase (Speyer I 965; Hall &amp; Lehman I 968; Muzyczka et al. 1972; Hershfield 1973; Hershfield &amp; Nossal 1973). It is clear that mutations are induced by errors in DNA replication (Kondo 1973) and that DNA polymerases are major determinants in this. (For reviews see COx (1976) and Drake &amp; Baltz (I976).) Recent analyses of the role of mutation I3-2</page><page sequence="4">354 A. R. Fersht rates in evolution have been performed by, among others, Kimura (i967, 1977), Leigh (I973), Smith (I 977) and Jukes (I980). An ill defined link may exist between lack of fidelity of replication of DNA and cancer. There is a correlation between carcinogenicity and mutagenicity in that agents that initiate tumours are also found to modify DNA (Ames 1976). Some of the modifications are similar to the effects caused by the recognition errors of a DNA polymerase, such as the incorporation of an A instead of a G. For example, a low level of G miscoding as A, induced by the alkylation of the 06 of G by N-methyl-N-nitrosourea, is sufficient to cause tumours in mice (Lawley I 980). This area is a subject of controversy (Cairns I 98 I; Garner &amp; Hertzog I 98 I). THE BASIC PROBLEMS OF SPECIFICITY The problem of enzyme specificity is well illustrated by Pauling's (X958) analysis of the difficulty in selection of amino acids during protein synthesis. Although his ideas were formulated before our present knowledge of the involvement of tRNA and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and were based on the concept of a template constructed to bind the individual amino acids of a polypeptide chain, they pinpoint the problems precisely. Consider the cavity in an enzyme constructed to accept the side chain of a particular amino acid, say valine. The other amino acids that are competing for the valine binding site may be divided into three classes according to size: those larger than, those smaller than, and those the same size as (isosteric with) the correct substrate, valine. The larger substrates may be positively excluded from binding to the cavity by forces of steric repulsion, the magnitude of which will depend on the additional size of the larger substrate and the shape and flexibility of the cavity. The smaller substrates, on the other hand, cannot be excluded from binding, but will just bind more weakly. Similarly, an isosteric substrate, such as threonine, must also bind to the active site to some extent as it is not excluded by steric repulsion. Extension of these ideas to enzymes is at first sight complicated because it is well documented that a change in the structure of a substrate can affect both its binding and rate constants and need not just alter only its affinity for the enzyme. Indeed, the phenomena of 'strain' (where the binding energy of the enzyme and substrate is used to distort the substrate) and 'induced fit' (where the binding energy is used to distort the enzyme into an active conformation) have been proposed to provide specificity. Fortunately, a rigorous analysis of the role of binding energy in enzyme catalysis (Fersht 1974, 1977 a) shows that strain and induced fit have no effect on specificity in the situation of a mixture of two or more substrates competing for the active site of one enzyme. Differences in binding energy may thus be equated directly with differences in specificity. The mathematical analysis for enzymes obeying the Michaelis-Menten equation, kcat[Eo0 [S] (1) (where v is the rate, kcat the turnover number and KM the Michaelis constant), may be summarized as follows (Fersht I977 a).</page><page sequence="5">Review Lecture 355 When a mixture of two substrates A and B compete for one enzyme, their relative rate of reaction is given by VA/VB- (kcat/KM)A [A]/(kcat/KM)B [BI (2) (that is, relative rate of reaction varies as the relative rate constants, relative binding energies and relative concentrations). Further, when the enzyme is constructed to bind A, and B is smaller because it lacks a group R, (kcat/KM)A/(kcat/KM)B = exp (- AGb/RT) (3) where AGb is the difference in Gibbs binding energy due to the contribution of R. Thus VAIVB= e AGb/RT [A]/[B]. (4) (a) Specificity problems in DNA replication The basic problem in nucleotide selection is a variation upon the above theme, with its own peculiarities arising from the particular means of achieving specificity. The overall size and shape of A T, T A, G C and C * G nucleoside pairs are all very similar and so are all easily accommodated in the DNA double helix. This characteristic has been utilized during DNA replication to allow a DNA polymerase with only one (synthetic) active site to bind all four combinations of A, T, G and C. The DNA polymerase recognizes just the overall shape of the purine * pyrimidine pair and relies on the complementary nature of the base pairing to provide the specificity (Kornberg I980). There are, however, other types of complementary base pairing that occur at lower frequency and may be accommodated by the DNA double helix and the DNA polymerase. It was pointed out by Watson &amp; Crick (I953) in their original papers on the structure of DNA that keto-enol and amino-imino tautomerism scrambles the specificity: the enol form of T has the same hydrogen bonding pattern as C and the imino form of C has the HNJ H 0 ~HN HNN .'O 0&amp; N o0 N C ~~ul TI HW HoN: Ho N 0 Cimino Uenol Tenol FIGURE 1.

Fersht same characteristics as T and both are of similar size (figure 1). These unfavoured forms are calculated to occur at the level of one part in 104-105 (Topal &amp; Fresco I977) and so cause a potential mutation frequency by A* C and G T mispairing of 10-4-10-5. Topal &amp; Fresco (I977) have argued from model-building experi- ments invoking the participation of syn conformations of the nucleotides that purine purine but not pyrimidine pyrimidine mispairings will also occur at about this level. Thus errors of mispairing are expected to occur at a far higher rate than the values of 10-8-10-1o found for mutation in E. coli. Undoubtedly, four different DNA polymerases could have been designed, each specific for one of the four possible pairs, or alternatively there could have been an equivalent DNA polymerase with a separate active site for each pair to give higher specificity by recognizing their distinctive individual features. Evolution, however, has taken a different path. (b) Specificity problems in protein synthesis The potential mispairings predicted to occur during DNA replication will also arise elsewhere when specificity relies on base pairing, as in the transcription Df DNA by RNA polymerase to give mRNA. The matching on the ribosome of the codon of the mRNA with the anticodon of the aminoacyl-tRNA will also have these errors. Further complications arise because of the triplet nature of code, its degeneracy and 'wobble': the three residues of the anticodon of the tRNA are not aligned for forming part of the normal double helix (Jack et al. I 976; Quigley et al. I 976). A more serious problem, the potential weakest link in the chain, is the selection of amino acids. This takes place in a two-step reaction of activation of the amino acid (AA) followed by transfer to one of its family of tRNAs (tRNAAA): AA + EAA + ATP = EAA . AA-AMP + PPi (5) EAA . AA-AMP + tRNAAA EAA + AAAtRNAAA + AMP. (6) Both reactions, and hence both recognitions, are catalysed by the same aminoacyl- tRNA synthetase (EAA). The recognition of the tRNA by its cognate enzyme is no real problem since the tRNA is a large complex molecule with much scope for distinct structural variation (Fersht I 97 a). On the other hand, as pointed out by Pauling (I958), some of the amino acids are so similar in structure that discrimi- nation is particularly difficult. The most severe cases are those of rejection of glycine by EAla, valine by Eiie and serine by EThr since the smaller amino acids differ by only one methylene group. Pauling (I 958) calculated from a value of about 4 kJ/mol for the hydrophobic binding energy of a methylene group (the figure usually found from physical chemical measurements) that an error rate of about 1 in 5 is expected for glycine replacing alanine, valine replacing isoleucine etc. Pauling also attempted to estimate the errors of alanine replacing glycine (&lt; 1/100t) and phenylalanine replacing tyrosine (&lt; 1/100). One of the author's goals has been to measure these numbers experimentally as discussed later. t The solidus here stands for 'per' or 'in'.</page><page sequence="7">Review Lecture 357 SUMMARY OF OBSERVED AND PREDICTED ERROR FREQUENCIES FOR DNA REPLICATION AND PROTEIN SYNTHESIS Listed in table 1 are the predicted and observed error rates for DNA replication and protein synthesis in X coli. DNA replication proceeds some 10$ times more accurately than predicted and so an editing mechanism must be operating to remove errors. The theoretically predicted error rate in the absence of editing of 10-4-10-5 is a reasonable estimate which is supported by experimental evidence to be discussed in detail later (purified eukaryotic DNA polymerases which are known not to possess editing mechanisms make errors at these frequencies or higher, as does RNA polymerase).

I 98O). The accuracy of RNA polymerase in vitro is compatible with this figure (error rates of 1/2400-1/40000 (Springgate &amp; Loeb I975)), as is the accuracy of tRNA selection (Fersht I979a). Codon-anticodon interactions are an unknown quantity but amino acid selection is undoubtedly poor. The figures quoted for amino acid selection in the absence of editing allow for the imbalances in their concentrations in vtvo. The significance of these error rates in E. coli, when compounded to give the actual errors in a gene coding for a protein of relative molecular mass 100000, the mRNA and the protein, is seen in table 2.

R. Fersht the measured error rates) in the mRNA and the protein are somewhat less than one per chain and so these are only on the threshold of being error free. In the absence of editing, however, the amino acid content of the protein would be disastrously heterogeneous, containing some tens of incorrect amino acids per chain. Also the mutation frequency would be close to one per generation per protein. When these figures are multiplied by the total numbers of proteins in E. coli (ca. 3000), it is realized that few efficient progeny would be produced. THE EDITING MECHANISMS OF AMINO ACID SELECTION Early studies on the isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase showed that valine is activated by the enzyme as predicted but that the value of kcat/KM is about 200 times lower than that for isoleucine (see, for example, Loftfield &amp; Eigner I966). However, in the presence of tRNA, no valyl-tRNAIle is formed. The answer to this paradox was found by Norris &amp; Berg (I964) (and Baldwin &amp; Berg (I966)) when they prepared large quantities of the isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase and were able to isolate and examine directly the complexes of the enzyme with its substrates. The enzyme was found to form a relatively stable EIle. Ile-AMP complex in the presence of ATP and isoleucine. On the addition of tRNAIle to this complex there is substantial transfer of the isoleucine to the tRNA. A stable EIe . Val-AMP complex is also formed, but addition of tRNAIle causes the quantitative hydrolysis of the Val- AMP rather than the formation of Val-tRNAIle. The sum of these two reactions is that, in the presence of tRNAile and valine, the isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase acts as an ATp/pyrophosphatase by the sum of the two reactions EIe + ATP + Val - Eiie. Val-AMP + PPi (7) and Eile. Val-AMP + tRNAI'e EIe + tRNAIie + Val + AMP. (8) This constituted the experimental discovery of editing mechanisms and provided the basic rules for their detection and diagnosis: a partial reaction of a pathway occurs but not the overall reaction; there is the non-productive hydrolysis of a high energy compound. It was recognized in the original papers that hydrolysis of the wrong complex on the addition of the cognate tRNA could occur either directly at the level of the aminoacyl adenylate or after the formation of the mischarged tRNA. The solution of this problem required the development of new techniques for studying these enzymes on a rapid time scale. The essence of modern enzymology is direct observation of the enzyme and its complexes, whether it be by spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction or kinetics (see Fersht I 977 a). The basic problem of classical steady-state enzyme kinetics is that information about the enzyme and its complexes is indirect and relies on inference so that proof at an acceptable level is difficult to obtain. In modern rapid reaction kinetics, however, the complexes of the enzyme are observed directly as are the rates of formation and decay of intermediates. Application of this approach to the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases requires an apparatus for mixing the enzyme, tRNA and radioactively labelled amino acid and</page><page sequence="9">Review Lecture 359 ATP in various permutations and combinations, and then quenching with acid in a time range of milliseconds to several seconds. The classic rapid sampling and quenching machines (quenched-flow; see, for example, Lymn &amp; Taylor I970) were too limited in time range and required too much protein to be of much use for enzymes available in relatively low amounts. To overcome this problem, I devised the pulsed-quenched-flow method (Fersht &amp; Jakes I975) which in its original form extended the time range of quenched flow to the range of 150 ms to minutes. Subsequently, the machine has been refined to operate in the time range of 15 ms upwards, using only 25 pt samples of reagents (as well as faster times in the conventional quenched-flow mode). Applying the rapid quenching method to the problem of the rejection of threonine by the valyl-tRNA synthetase, we have been able to detect the transient formation of ThrAtRNAval and show that the major editing route of this enzyme involves the deacylation of the mischarged tRNA (Fersht &amp; Kaethner I966; Fersht &amp; Dingwall 1979a). The relevant observations are that (i) on mixing the Eval. Thr-AMP complex with tRNAval there is the transient formation of Thr-tRNAval, reaching a maximum after some 20 ms and then disappearing after 100 ms, (ii) the deacylation occurs much faster than the dissociation of the mischarged tRNA from the enzyme, (iii) on quenching the reaction with phenol, extracting the mischarged tRNA and measuring its rate of enzyme-catalysed deacylation in the rapid quenching machine, the valyl-tRNA synthetase is found to be a very efficient esterase towards the mischarged tRNA (kcat = 40 s-1), (iv) this esterase activity is not inhibited by the addition of valyl adenylate which blocks the aminoacylation site, thereby suggesting the presence of a distinct hydrolytic site. The results of a series of measurements of the rates of activation of a range of amino acids by the valyl-tRNA synthetases are listed in table 3. TABLE 3.

The double-sieve editing mechanism The whole range of amino acids may be sorted by the two active sites of an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase mainly according to size and, if necessary, by chemical characteristics in the same way that two sieves of different mesh may</page><page sequence="10">360 A. R. Fersht be used to isolate particles of just one desired size (Fersht I977a; Fersht &amp; Dingwall 1979 d). The sizes of the active site cavities sort the amino acids by using, instead of a wire mesh, the principle that larger substrates may be excluded by steric hindrance from an active site but smaller substrates must, perforce, bind. As a first example, consider an amino acid, such as isoleucine, that has no natural isosteres to cause complications. The activation site of the isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase is considered to be constructed to be just large enough to accommodate isoleucine but the hydrolytic site is smaller and just large enough to accommodate valine. All amino acids larger than the correct substrate are rejected at a tolerable level from binding at the activation site by steric hindrance. On the other hand, all smaller amino acids have access to the activation site and are activated, albeit at lower rates. But these same amino acids (or rather their products) are accepted by the hydrolytic site. The correct amino acid is largely excluded from the hydrolytic site by sterin hindrance. The principle of steric exclusion is thus used twice to obtain the desired sorting. The above case is relatively simple since sorting can be performed by size alone. Where isosteric amino acids occur, such as threonine competing with valine, sorting by chemical characteristics must be superimposed upon the sorting by size. For example, the hydrolytic site of the valyl-tRNA synthetase presumably has a hydrogen bond acceptor/donor site to bind specifically the hydroxyl of threonine and repel the corresponding hydrophobic methyl group of valine. Otherwise, the exclusion of all larger amino acids by the activation site and the acceptance of all smaller amino acids by the hydrolytic or editing site takes place as described in the first case. The evidence for the double-sieve is in table 3. (i) The rate of activation of isoleucine by the valyl-tRNA synthetase is only 5 x 10' of that of valine so that if all the isoleucine that is activated by the enzyme is transferred to tRNAval the error rate would be only one-tenth of that generally found in protein synthesis (3 x 10-4). Thus the first sieve is sufficiently precise to exclude at a tolerable level substrates that are larger by only one methylene group. (ii) The amino acids isosteric with, and smaller than, valine are activated but the relative rate of activation decreases as the fit with the enzyme becomes poorer. (iii) Val-tRNAval is relatively stable in the presence of the enzyme but the others, where studied, are rapidly hydrolysed. Single-site (single-feature) editing The double-sieve mechanism is particularly efficient at distinguishing between substrates because it uses different features for discrimination at each site (Fersht &amp; Kaethner I 976). For example, the valyl-tRNA synthetase discriminates against threonine by first binding its hydroxyl group weakly in a hydrophobic pocket in the activation site and then discriminates against valine in the hydrolytic site by requiring the binding of its relevant methyl group in a hydrophilic locus. Similarly, with the isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase, valine is bound more weakly than isoleucine at the activation site but isoleucine is sterically hindered from entering the hydrolytic site. The advantages of this type of 'double feature' recognition are analysed at the end of this article when the cost of editing is discussed. Another type of editing process, first proposed by Hopfield (I 974), relies on use of the same recognition twice over. For example, it was suggested that by invoking the</page><page sequence="11">Review Lecture 361 dissociation of the aminoacyl adenylate complex from the enzyme and the subsequent hydrolysis in solution, ATP PpitRNA E. AA \ B E. AA-AMP - AA-tRNA It I I E+AA E AA-AMP (9) 1 hydrolysis AA + AMP , the specificity could be 'squared'. For example, if valine bindsf times more weakly than isoleucine to the isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase, then the valyl-adenylate could also bind up to f times more weakly than the isoleucyl adenylate to give a total specificity of f2 (Hopfield 1974). However, as pointed out by Mulvey &amp; Fersht (i977), and discussed in detail at the end of the article, the additional specificity is only obtained when the dissociation of the aminoacyl adenylate is faster than the transfer to tRNA and the full specificity of f2 is achieved only at the expense of hydrolysing most of the correct substrate as well as the incorrect. Further, when f, the discrimination between the two substrates, is small, i.e. the situation when editing is most needed, specificity can be enhanced by a small factor only (see later). We have recently discovered an example where efficient editing can arise by a possible one-site editing because of the specific chemical nature of the incorrect amino acid. (H. Jakubowski &amp; A. IR. Fersht, unpublished data). The methionyl- tRNA synthetase possesses an editing mechanism that is presumably directed against homocysteine, the immediate biosynthetic precursor of methionine (Fersht &amp; Dingwall I979c). Much, if not all, of the homocysteinyl adenylate is rejected before the transfer of tRNA by the facile cyclization to the homocysteinyl thiolactone: NH3+ NH3+ CH CH CH \\ ,O \\ = X AM CH2 CH =0 +AMP . (10) | \AMP I CH2 CHI2 \SH \S It is possible that editing can, on occasion, be a two-step process by first the hydrolysis of the incorrect aminoacyl adenylate and then, in a ' mopping up' step, hydrolysis of the incorrect aminoacyl-tRNA that is still formed (Fersht 1977b). Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases not requiring editing mechanisms Some amino acids are so different from their possible competitors that adequate selection is possible without recourse to editing: larger competitors are excluded from binding to the active site by the usual process of steric hindrance while the smaller competitors are activated too slowly to pose any real problems. A rule of thumb to predict when editing is necessary is to compare the relative rates of activation of the correct amino acid and its isosteric and small competitors and</page><page sequence="12">362 A. R. Fersht calculate whether errors would be introduced at a higher frequency than the observed overall rate of 3/ 104 for protein synthesis. By this token, the tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase does not need to remove errors of activation of phenylalanine because the activation of tyrosine is favoured by a factor of 105 or so (Fersht et al. I 980). Similarly, the activation of cysteine is favoured by a factor of 5 x 106 or greater over its isosteric and smaller competitors (Fersht &amp; Dingwall I979b). There is no evidence for the participation of a double-sieve type editing mechanism with these enzymes. The glycyl-tRNA synthetase should also face no problems because all other amino acids are larger than glycine. Enzymes that clearly need to possess efficient means of editing are those that have to reject amino acids that are very similar to the correct substrates, e.g. the alanyl- (for Gly), threonyl- (Ser and Val), valyl- (Thr and Ala), isoleucyl- (Val), methionyl- (homocysteine), and phenylalanyl- and leucyl- (for the other smaller hydrophobic amino acids) tRNA synthetases. The essence of an editing mechani,sm The editing pathways of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases exemplify the basic requirements of editing. These are: (i) the occurrence of a metastable intermediate or product on the reaction pathway; (ii) a branch point leading to destruction through which the intermediate may be channelled (Fersht 1977 a). The metastable intermediates during the aminoacylation of tRNA are the aminoacyl adenylate complex and the aminoacyl-tRNA (when bound to the enzyme) since both are unstable with respect to hydrolysis: E. AA. ATP, E. AA-AMP-- E- . AA-tRNA----- E?AA-tRNA E+AA+AMP E+AA+tRNA (An interesting proposal by Hopfield (i 980) may also be classified on this scheme. The metastable intermediate in this mechanism is not a chemical entity but a high-energy conformational state of the enzyme which is somehow induced during the reaction and can either proceed to products or be deactivated when the incorrect substrate is bound. There is as yet no evidence for the actual occurrence of this particular mechanism in practice, but it remains an intriguing possibility because it causes no wasteful hydrolysis of ATP during the rejection of non-cognate species.) The evolution of specificity can be viewed as two notional processes: (i) the enzyme has evolved to favour its correct substrate as much as possible in the synthetic reaction (i.e. to bind the distinctive portions of the cognate substrate as tightly as possible); (ii) where necessary, an editing reaction has also evolved. PROBING THE LIMITS OF PROTEIN-AMINO ACID SITE CHAIN INTERACTIONS WITH THE AMINOACYL-tRNA SYNTHETASES: THE NATURE OF THE HYDROPHOBIC BOND The interaction of amino acid side chains with each other is a dominant feature in the folding of proteins and their assembly into oligomers: the interiors of globular proteins contain close-packed amino acid side chains as do the subunit</page><page sequence="13">Review Lecture 363 interfaces in oligomers; elements of secondary structure, such as a-helices, are assembled into larger units by interdigitating their amino acid side chains. The tendency of non-polar side chains to interact with each other is usually described as the 'hydrophobic bond' (Kauzmann I959). Hydrophobic bonding also often dominates enzyme-ligand interactions. The energy of the hydrophobic bond is usually measured from the equilibrium constants for the partition of molecules between an organic and an aqueous phase. The results are generally analysed and discussed in terms of incremental Gibbs energies of transfer, i.e. the contribution of a particular hydrophobic group on a molecule, relative to its absence in the parent compound. The incremental binding energy of the side chain of valine, for example, may be determined from the relative partitioning of valine and glycine between an organic and an aqueous phase. It is found, for example, that each -CH2- group of a molecule contributes about 0.5-1.0 kcal/molt, depending on the nature of the organic phase (Tanford I 980; Leo et al. I971). It has further been noted that there is a linear correlation between the Gibbs energy of transfer between organic and aqueous phases and the surface area of the hydrophobic moiety of the transferred solute (Hermann I972; Harris et al. I 973; Reynolds et al. I 974; Chothia I 974). With a value of 25 kcal/(A2 mol)t for the proportionality constant, quantitative predictions have made for specific examples of protein-protein binding and conformational changes, based on the change in hydrophobic area exposed to solvent. However, recent measurements on phosphorylase are in disagreement with these calculations (Sprang et al. I979). Rather than use model chemical systems to estimate hydrophobic binding energies in protein interactions, it is better to use direct measurements on the proteins themselves. The selective pressure on the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases to bind the distinctive portions of their cognate substrates as tightly as possible affords a possibly unique experimental opportunity of systematically exploring the limits of protein - amino acid side chain interaction (Fersht et al. I980). The mathematical basis of the approach is contained in equations (2) and (3): maximization of specificity involves maximization of the ratio kcat/KM (equation (2)); binding energies may be calculated by equation (3) from the ratio kcat/KM. Some values calculated in this way for the incremental binding energies of side chains are listed in table 4. It is seen that the binding energies for the purely hydrocarbon side chains are some 6.2-6.5 times higher with the enzymes than predicted from the simple solution studies, corresponding to a factor of about 100 in the equilibrium constant per methylene group involved. Listed in table 5 are the values derived from the results of many experiments on the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases of the binding energies of small groups (Fersht et al. I980). Notable among these are the following. (i) The binding energy of a methylene group is generally about 3.4 kcal/mol, independent of the enzyme used: similar values are obtained when comparing the binding of valine and isoleucine to the isolecyl-tRNA synthetase, a-aminobutyrate and valine to the valyl-tRNA synthetase, glycine to the alanyl-tRNA synthetase. (ii) The unfavourable energy of cramming the extra methyl group of isoleucine into the binding site of the valyl-tRNA synthetase is at least 7 kcal/mol. (iii) The hydroxyl group of tyrosine contributes 7 kcal/mol t 1 kcal =103 ca1=4.184 x103 J; tA = 1o-10 m.</page><page sequence="14">364 A. R. Fersht when one compares the binding of tyrosine and phenylalanine to the tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase. Thus we have succeeded experimentally in being able to measure the binding energies that could only be guessed at by Pauling (1958). The incremental binding energies obtained from the experiments with enzymes are analogous to the incremental binding energies obtained from the simple chemical partitioning experiments. They are derived empirically from experiment and, in turn, are the values that are to be used when calculating the Gibbs energies of transfer from aqueous solution to the binding pocket of an enzyme. It is not suggested that these very high values should be used in every case or that they are even typical, but that these represent the upper limits of the possible, the intrinsic binding energies (Jencks 1975). The observed values of the incremental binding energy of a group are expected to vary according to the particular degree of fit of the substrates with the enzyme. Consider, for example, the binding of tyrosine and phenylalanine to representative enzymes. At one extreme, the TABLE 4.

With chymotrypsin, which is specific for just aromatic amino acids, tyrosin and phenylalanine are bound almost equally well and so the hydroxyl group contributes no net binding energy. At the other extreme, the binding of tyrosine to the phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase is inhibited by the additional hydroxyl group. Two major reasons have been suggested for the stronger binding to proteins than to hydrophobic solvents (Jencks 1975; Page 1976; Fersht 977a; Fersht &amp; Dingwall I979c): (i) higher van der Waals forces with proteins because they are more densely packed than liquids; (ii) the existence of a preformed binding pocket in the protein. But, whatever the physical reason for the values of the incremental binding energies listed in table 5, they are far higher than those obtained from simple chemical studies and should be considered in theoretical studies on the folding and assembly of proteins. It is also clear that with enzymes the hydrophobic bond should not just be considered as the 'squeezing out' of an organic molecule from the aqueous phase by the hydrogen bonds. The specific packing of side chains can provide considerable specificity of interaction. EDITING ELSEWHERE IN PROTEIN SYNTHESIS There are four recognition steps in translating the genetic code: transcription of the DNA to mRNA by RNA polymerase; selection by the aminocyl-tRNA synthetase of the cognate tRNA and cognate amino acid; matching of the codon and anticodon on the ribosome. As alluded to above, the first two of these processes appear to be sufficiently precise to function in the absence of editing mechanisms. The fidelity of RNA polymerase has been measured to be at least as accurate as overall protein synthesis (Springgate &amp; Loeb 1975): the misincorporation fre- quencies of G and C during the transcription of poly[d(A-T]) in vitro by E. coli RNA polymerase are 2 x 10-5 and 4 x 10-4 respectively, while A and U are misincorpor- ated at 10O4 and 5 x 105 during transcription of poly(dC) poly(dG). Similarly, the specificity of an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase for its cognate tRNA, about 107 according to equation (2), is more than adequate to account for the overall accuracy (Fersht 1979 a). The evidence for editing in amino acid selection is conclusive. There is promising, buit not quite yet conclusive, evidence for editing enhancing specificity in codon-anticodon recognition. This stems from the follow- ing. After the formation and release from the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase of the charged tRNA, it is bound by the complex of elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) and GTP and carried to the ribosome. When the aminoacyl-tRNA is correctly positioned, the GTP is cleaved to GDP, releasing EF-Tu. Thus, in the presence of aminoacyl-tRNA and correctly programmed ribosomes, EF-Tu acts as a GTPase. Thompson &amp; Stone (I 977) noted that in experiments in vitro with poly(U) as a synthetic mRNA (coding for polyphenylanine with codon UUIJ), some non-cognate aminoacyl-tRNAs with codons similar to that for Phe stimulated the EF-Tu GTPase activity, although at lower rates than did Phe-tRNAPhe. They suggested that this indicates the presence of an editing mechanism, dependent on</page><page sequence="16">366 A. R. Fersht the hydrolysis of GTP, as previously postulated by Hopfield (I974). Yates (I979) extended these studies by detecting and measuring the amount of AcPhe-AA formed in the presence of poly(U) programmed ribosomes, AcPhe-tRNAPhe (which acts as an acceptor) and AAAtRNAAA. The stoichiometry of GTP hydrolysed to AcPhe formed is 7.1 for AA = Leu (tRNALeu codon CUU), 8.3 for AA = Ile (codon AUU) compared with 1.2 for AA = Phe. Streptomycin, which is known to cause errors in translation, reduced the stoichiometries to values of 1.1, 1.1 and 1 respectively. This is consistent with the presence of an editing mechanism which may be specifically inhibited by streptomycin, though not necessarily the particular mechanism of Hopfield (I974). (See also Thompson et al. (I98I).) Menninger (I977; see also Caplan &amp; Menninger I979) has suggested that the dissociation of peptidyl-tRNA from the ribosome and the subsequent scavenging is an editing mechanism for codon-anticodon matching. It appears that each peptidyl-tRNA has a finite probability of dissociating from the ribosome instead of proceeding to elongation. The probability of dissociation is much higher when the nascent peptide chain is attached to a tRNA that is a mismatch for the codon. The peptidyl-tRNA may be detected in E. coli mutants lacking the peptidyl hydrolase that initiates the scavenging process. THE EDITING MECHANISMS OF NUCLEOTIDE SELECTION IN DNA REPLICATION All known prokaryotic DNA polymerases have, in addition to their polymerizing activity in the 5' - 3' direction, a 3' -e 5' exonuclease activity which appears to function as an editing mechanism (Brutlag &amp; Kornberg I 972; Kornberg I 980). The evidence for this is: (i) the exonuclease activity on synthetic primer templates is greater when there is a mismatch at the 3'-terminus of the primer strand (Brutlag &amp; Kornberg I972; Muzyczka et al. I972; Fersht I979 b); (ii) there is a correlation between high exonuclease to polymerase activity and fidelity of T4 DNA polym- erases from mutator and antimutator strains (Muzyczka et al. I972); (iii) as seen in table 6, eukaryotic DNA polymerases that do not possess the 3' -&gt; 5' activity are less accurate than the prokaryotic polymerases that do. (A further piece of evidence which will be discussed later is that kinetic work on a realistic replication system is consistent with the active participation of an exonuclease editing mechanism (Fersht I 979 b).) It is far more difficult to study the accuracy of DNA replication by means of synthetic substrates than it is to study the fidelity of protein synthesis because DNA replication is so much more accurate and hence so much more prone to be obscured by artefacts. It is seen on examination of table 6 that the observed accuracies of the DNA polymerases are far lower than expected from mutation frequencies. For the eukaryotic enzymes lacking the 3' -&gt; 5' exonuclease activity, the observed fidelities are probably real in the sense that editing components that enhance the fidelity in vivo are missing in vitro and so the observed values tend to the inherent error level in base selection (10-4-10-5). The values for the prokaryotic polymerases probably reflect quirks in using synthetic templates and impurities inherent in their preparation and those of the substrates. They are</page><page sequence="17">Review Lecture 367 certainly underestimates of the accuracy in vivo. One particular problem, for example, is the effect of hydrolysis products of the nucleotides which spontaneously arise at a finite rate.

(I979); 2, Murray &amp; Holliday (I98I); 3, Dube et al. (I979); 4, Seal et al. (I979). For RNA, this represents a genuine change of coding. For DNA, this is an effective change of coding since dU codes as dT. It is of interest that in vivo there is an enzyme repair system that recognizes dU in DNA, excises it and replaces it with dC (Lindahl I974). That dU may clearly be distinguished from dT by the lack of the methyl group in the same way that the isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase can edit out valine, is presumably one reason that DNA contains dT rather than dU as the natural complement of dA. It is of further interest that DNA contains some 5-methyl-dC which deaminates to dT causing 'hot spots' for spontaneous mutation (Coulondre et al. I 978): NH2 0 N Me H,0 HN Me 0 f N20 0 ZN N H (12) ? N O l-</page><page sequence="18">368 A. R. Fersht However, whatever the effects of hydrolysis are in vivo, they certainly obscure experiments in vitro, especially where the template contains dC or the reagent dCTP. An alternative assay system for fidelity is clearly necessary. Bioassay for measuring the fidelity of DNA polymerases The standard method of genetics for measuring the frequency of point mutation in prokaryotes is to measure the rate of reversion of amber mutants. Amber mutants are produced when one of the amino acid codons, such as TGG coding for tryptophan or GAG coding for glutamic acid, mutates to TAG, which is a termination signal, instructing immediate cessation of synthesis of the particular protein. It is often a very simple procedure to assay the proportion of wild type and amber mutants in a population of bacteriophage because, although the amber mutant will not generally grow in its native host bacteria, it will often grow on a suppressor-carrying strain. (The suppressor in these cases is one of a number of tRNAs that has mutated to recognize the amber codon and insert its particular amino acid at a high frequency whenever the signal TAG occurs (or rather UAG in the mRNA).) The genetic procedure was modified to measure the fidelity of a polymerase in vitro in pioneering studies by Weymouth &amp; Loeb (I978) and Liu et al. (I979) by copying the DNA from an amber mutant of bacteriophage 4X174. Bacteriophage 4X 174 consists of a circular, covalently closed, single-stranded genome of 5386 nucleotides of DNA packed in a protein coat. Its replication may be split into distinct phases in vivo and in vitro (Kornberg I980). First, the single-stranded DNA (SS) is copied to form a duplex, covalently closed, supercoiled form termed RF (replicative form). This SS -&gt; RF stage uses the E. coli replication apparatus involving a large number of proteins. The essence of the replication, however, is the copying of the template strand by the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, the major replicative DNA polymerase of E. coli. The final stage (RF -e SS) is the production of many copies of the viral strand by copying the complementary strand of the RF. The RF -&gt; SS stage is readily performed in vitro by means of just four proteins (see figure 2): the geneA protein (phage-encoded) nicks the viral strand of the RF, becoming covalently attached to the 5'-end of a specific position in the sequence and releasing a 3'-hydroxyl to act as primer for polymerization by the DNA polymerase III; the double helix of DNA is unwound in advance of DNA polymerization by the rep protein of E. coli, fuelled by ATP, while the newly formed single strand is covered by DNA-binding protein (SSB); when a full length of viral strand DNA is formed, the geneA protein cyclizes it to form a new covalently closed intact viral genome while the geneA protein attaches itself to the 5'-end of the next stretch of viral DNA to be formed. The process thus repeats itself, the amount of new viral DNA produced in vitro being limited by the amount of SSB available. The fidelity assay of Weymouth &amp; Loeb (I978) involves annealing a restriction fragment primer to the viral strand of 4X 174 DNA and then copying past an amber mutation (or rather its complement) by DNA polymerase I from E. coli (a polymerase thought to be important in DNA repair and filling gaps). The viral strand and the small piece of synthetic DNA are then transfected into spheroplasts of E. coli (produced by treating E. coli with lysozyme and EDTA to make the cells</page><page sequence="19">Review Lecture 369 take up exogeneous DNA) which form phage from the original parent strand and the synthetic DNA. This system suffers from the drawback that the parent strand is expressed far more than the synthetic strand so that the progeny represent only 13 + 6 0 of the total phage formed. Because of this high background, the original studies were unable to detect the low level of spontaneous mutation. The fidelity assay of Liu et al. (I979) involves replication of 4X174 RF DNA to progeny RF DNA by means of the T4 polymerase system. The drawback of this system is that Q0CX~ RFI gene A rep, SSB SHO ) Pol III holoenzyme 3'HO ATP,dNTPs FIGURE 2. RF -&gt; SS stage of XX174 replication (after Kornberg I980). The sequence is initiated by the geneA protein (M17) converting the supercoiled RFI DNA to the geneA-RFII complex. The single stranded DNA produced is covered by single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB, 0). both strands of the DNA are copied, so complicating any kinetic analysis (see below). In the initial studies, no mutants were detected during replication in vitro. Consideration of the above suggests that the ideal system for studying the fidelity of a DNA polymerase should have the following characteristics: (i) the progeny should greatly outnumber the parent strand in the fidelity assay: (ii) only one strand of the template should be copied and so only one strand formed to ease kinetic analysis. Further, to study the fidelity of replication in E. coli, DNA polymerase III should be used, as this is the enzyme responsible for the major fraction of the replication of the E. coli chromosome (as well as that of 4X174). An ideal system is the RF -? SS stage of the replication of 4X174 described above (figure 2). Use of this system provided the first measurements of the accuracy of a polymerase as faithful in vitro as in vivo (Fersht I979b).</page><page sequence="20">370 A. R. Fersht The fidelity of prokaryotic DNA polymerases: 'kinetic genetics' The fidelity assay of Fersht (Ig79 b) is sufficiently precise and reproducible to enable the analysis of the kinetics of spontaneous mutation along the lines of classical steady state kinetics. RF DNA from an amber mutant of 4X174 is replicated in vitro by the procedure of figure 2 under controlled conditions to give many (5-7) copies of the single-stranded viral DNA which is transfected into E. coli spheroplasts so that the resultant progeny phage may be assayed by selective plating on wild type or suppressor-containing strains of E. coli. The technique is to favour the reversion of the TAG codon to an amino acid codon by biasing the concentrations of dNTPs in the reaction mixture to force the desired change. For example, to force the formation of TGG (copied from ATC) rather than TAG, elementary reasoning dictates that the reaction mixture contains high [dGTP] and low [dATP] to favour G T rather than A- T pairing at the middle position of the codon. Similarly, to force the synthesis of GAG rather than TAG, there should be a high [dGTP]/[dTTP] ratio in the reaction mixture. A more detailed analysis of the kinetics of mutation, however, suggests that the concentration of the following nucleotide to be incorporated may also affect the mutation frequency (see also Bernardi et al. 1979). This is because the 3' -&gt; 5' exonuclease activity of the polymerase acts as a proofreading function, excising a proportion of the mismatches as they are incorporated and before chain elongation can occur. Because the permanent incorporation of a mismatch requires chain elongation and the rate of this depends to some extent on the concentration of the deoxynucleoside tri- phosphate following the mismatch, a general expression for the reversion frequency, v, is 4[dNTPinc] [dNTPfol] [dNTP0'or] K+ [dNTPfol]' (1 where superscripts cor, inc, and fol designate the correct, incorrect, and following deoxynucleoside triphosphates for the particular position; K is a complex ratio of rate constants for binding, hydrolysis and elongation and is not the value of KM for the normal polymerization reaction.

Post-replicative mismatch repair Although the error rate of DNA polymerase III is very low at about 5 x 10-7 for the replication of the phage in vitro and in vivo, the accuracy is still not sufficient to account for the observed mutation frequency of only 10-8-10-1o for the replication of E. coli itself. The additional accuracy is achieved by a post-replicative mismatch repair system, special to double-stranded DNA and not available (or necessary) for the replication of the single-stranded DNA of bacteriophages. The possibility of such processes had in the past been ignored because of the problem of knowing which base in a mismatched pair was the mutant. However, DNA is methylated on the N6 position of A when in the sequence -GATC- (at about 1/256 nucleotides) and on the C5 of C when in the sequence -CC*AGG- (about 1/512 nucleotides) (Marinus I 976).

Glickman &amp; Radman (I980) have presented strong evidence that there is an enzyme system that patrols newly synthesized double-stranded DNA, searches for mismatches, preferentially removes the mismatch from the daughter strand and then inserts the correct base (or nucleotide). Just why this additional mechanism is required, and why the polymerase by itself cannot provide the required accuracy, is indicated below in a consideration of the costs and limits of editing.

Thus editing costs energy in two ways: (i) the high energy metabolites used in the formation and subsequent editing of the incorrect products; (ii) the fraction of the high energy compounds wasted when some of the correct product is edited. The first of these is clearly necessary and desirable, the second is also necessary, but undesirable and hence should be minimized. The wasteful hydrolysis of the correct substrate and the dependence of this on the efficiency of editing was shown experimentally by Muzyczka et al. (I972). They discovered that the DNA polymerase of certain anti-mutator mutants of T4 hydrolysed vast quantities of the correct substrates during DNA replication. Conversely, certain mutator polymerases are exceedingly frugal in their use of the correct deoxynucleoside triphosphate (table 8). There have been some recent detailed analyses of the cost and limits of accuracy (Savageau &amp; Freter 1979 a, b; Ehrenberg &amp; Blomberg I980), but, for the purposes of this article, I wish to use an earlier analysis (Mulvey &amp; Fersht 1977; Fersht 1977 a) because this formulation implied some simple equations and predictions in answer to the basic questions: what are the limitts of editing; what does it cost; how do these depend on mechani,sm? Consider the archetypical editing mechanism, a Michaelis-Menten mechanism combined with an editing step: ks synthesis KM kcat E + S E . S El (17) kd destruction</page><page sequence="24">374 A. R. Fersht The fraction of El that proceeds to products is given by kIc/(Ik? + kd) . Combination of this factor with equation (2) for substrates A (correct) and B (incorrect) competing for an enzyme gives VA_ (kcat/KM)A {IkS/(kS+kd)}A [A] VB (kcat/KM)B {ks/(ks + kd)}B [B]' (where VA and VB are now the functions of A and B proceeding to products). The selectivity, S, is defined by (lcat/KM)A {ks/(ks + kd)}A (kcat/Km)B {ks/(ks + kd)}B i.e. VA - s [A] (20) VB [B]' The selectivity may now be defined in terms of two discrimination factors and the cost of editing. First the cost, C, is defined by the fraction of the products of the correct substrate that is wastefully hydrolysed, that is, C = {kd/ (ks + kd)}A * (2l) (This definition of cost, rather than the sum of the losses of both the correct and incorrect substrates, is useful both algebraically and conceptually as it simplifies the equations and emphasizes that the hydrolysis of the correct product is the principal concern, the hydrolysis of the incorrect products being close to 100 0 for efficient editing.) The discrimination factor in the initial binding reactions, f, is defined by f (kcat/KM)A/(kcat/KM)B. (22) Let the discrimination factor in the editing reaction be defined by f', which may be manifested as either a more rapid editing of the incorrect products and kS the same for both, i.e. (k) =f'(kd)A (ks)A (ks)B, (23) or vice versa, i.e. (ks)A =f '(ks) B, (24) (kd)A (kd)B J (or a combination of both). Both types of behaviour give identical results in the following manipulations. Substitution of equation (22), and either equation (23) or equation (24) into equations (19) give the important relation (the cost-selectivity equation) S =f{?+(f'-1)C}. (25) A wide range of mechanisms that are more complicated than the basic scheme may be analysed to give the same equation. Some of the mechanisms that are likely to arise in practice may be grouped into the following two classes.</page><page sequence="25">Review Lecture 375 (a) Single-feature recognition: f =f Certain editing processes such as nucleotide selection in DNA replication, the putative editing in codon-anticodon interactions and the speculative 'kinetic proofreading' processes postulated by Hopfield (I974) discussed earlier would appear to function by checking the same feature of the substrate twice in the same manner. For example, the Brutlag &amp; Kornberg (I972) model for selection for editing in DNA replication, B dNTP E N elongation f'JT (26) E E N I?I?L~ + dNTP editing involves checking of the binding of the dNTP by complementary base pairing in the initial binding step and then again in the editing step; f' is thus presumably similar to f. The cost-selectivity equation reduces to S=f{l+(f-t)C} (27) or S =f (1 C) +f2C. (28) Inspection of equation (28) reveals two points: (i) as pointed out by Hopfield (1974), the increase in selectivity is limited to a further factor of f only; (ii) the full increase in specificity is reached only as C approaches 1, i.e. when 100 % of the correct substrate is removed (Mulvey &amp; Fersht 1977). Cost of editing by DNA polymerases and predicted error rates Equation (28) is plotted in figure 4 forf =104 andf = 105, simulating selectivity in DNA replication at the basal mispairing frequencies of about 104-10-1. The accuracy of replication of the E. coli chromosome (10-81-10-1?) would only be obtained at C = 1 under these conditions. A major question is: what is the cost of editing during DNA replication in the cell? There is little evidence on this so far. However, it is seen in table 8 that for the wild type T4 DNA polymerase C- 0.04. An unpublished experiment by the author on the ratio of dTTP wastefully hydrolysed to dTMP incorporated during the replication of XX 174 DNA in vitro (RF -+ SS), under the conditions of the fidelity assay of Fersht (Ig79 b) at 15 gm dTTP, 40 gm dCTP, dGTP, dATP, gives C = 0.034 for DNA polymerase III holoenzyme. Substitution of this value into equation (28) gives S = 3.4 x 106 for f = 104 and S = 3.4 x 108 for f = 105. These values are in the region required to account for the observed mutation frequencies of XX 174. This tentative analysis based on quite tenuous estimates predicts quite remarkably (and possibly com- pletely fortuitously) that a DNA polymerase with a single feature editing can obtain accuracies of about 10-6-10-8 at a cost of about 34 0o of the correct substrates being wastefully turned over. Further, it is consistent with the need for the post-replicative mismatch repair mechanism in E. coli to boost the accuracy to 108-10-10.</page><page sequence="26">376 A. R.

This simulates the cost of editing in DNA replication with a basal error frequency of 10-4-10- and single-feature recognition (see text). (b) Double-feature recognition: f' &gt; f The double-sieve mechanism is an example of a double-feature selection process whereby different characteristics of the substrates are used in selection for f and f'. At the initial selection in binding of, say, valine and isoleucine to the isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase, f is relatively low, about 100-200, because only the weak forces of binding are involved. However, for selection for editing, the strong forces of steric repulsion may be invoked to inhibit the binding of the side chain of isoleucine in the editing site for valine; f' may thus be very high (cf. table 4, bottom row) and hence also the selectivity. Double-feature recognition is an inherently more cost-effective procedure than single feature (Fersht I977a). Cost of editing by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases The selectivity of some aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases may be calculated more readily than that of DNA polymerases because values of f are well documented and some values off' may be reasonable estimated. For example, if one considers the valyl-tRNA synthetase from E. coli discriminating against cx-aminobutyrate, f is measured to be 180 (from the activation reaction versus valine) and f' &gt; 1.3 x 105 (from the relative rates of the valyl-tRNA synthetase-catalysed deacylation of a-aminobutyryl-tRNAvai (k = 50 s-1) and valyl-tRNAval (k = 3.8 x 10-4 S-1) (Fersht &amp; Dingwall I979a). Substitution of these values into the cost-selectivity equation gives S &gt; 2 x 104 for C = 0.001, and S &gt; 2 x 105 for C = 0.01. Further values of f' may be calculated from the incremental binding energies listed in table 4. For example, transfer of the valine side chain from an isoleucine binding site to a valine binding site relative to the transfer of the isoleucine side chain could be favoured by more than (3.4 + 7)kcal/mol, equivalent tof' = 4 x I07. The same calculation may be made for glycine being edited by the alanyl-tRNA synthetase. These selectivities should be more than adequate to account for the observed</page><page sequence="27">Review Lecture 377 accuracy of protein synthesis at relatively low cost. Measurements of the amount of aminoacyl-tRNA formed per ATP hydrolysed give a value of about 0.03 + 0.02 for C (Mulvey &amp; Fersht I977). (c) Multiple editing steps It has been suggested that editing in amino acid selection could in some cases occur by first hydrolysis of the incorrect aminoacyl adenylate complex and then hydrolysis of the misacylated tRNA in a 'mopping-up step' (Fersht I 77b). A higher degree of selectivity can be obtained at lower cost in such multi-step processes (Savageau &amp; Freter I 979 b). The post-replicative mismatch repair system of E. coli in combination with the polymerase editing functions may be considered to be an example of this phenomenon. CONCLUSIONS The study of editing mechanisms is at an exciting stage: their existence has been established; some basic rules for their behaviour have been formulated. But, as yet, we are in total ignorance of the enzymic mechanisms involved in even those examples where an authentic hydrolytic activity has been demonstrated. There is a lack of three-dimensional information on the spatial arrangements of the active sites involved in synthesis and hydrolysis. Not even the chemical nature of the groups participating in catalysis is known. The evolution of editing mechanisms is also intriguing. It is clear that, just as the present system of the genetic code represents the finished product and that primitive forms have been lost in prehistory, so the complex editing pathways of today are the sophisticated forms. It is attractive to speculate that the evolution of accuracy and editing mechanisms has parallelled the evolution of life since increasing complexity requires increasing accuracy to maintain it. Similarly, at the earliest stages of evolution, high mutability is necessary to generate varied pathways of progress and to adapt to changing environment. There are observations consistent with these ideas. Drake (I969) has noted that for prokaryotes the mutation rate per organism is approximately constant, so that the mutation rate per codon is higher for those with smaller genomes. Thus, the accuracy of the DNA polymerase alone is adequate for the replication of the single-stranded DNA bacteriophages such as 4Xt174 while E. coli requires the additional post-replicative mismatch repair mechanism. Theoretical work by Leigh (I973), discussed by Cox (I976), suggests that mutator alleles can be advantageous in asexual populations, especially in changing and unpredictable environments. In sexual populations, however, selection tends to minimize rather than optimize mutation rates. It seems likely that during evolution there has been a continuous pressure on protein synthesis to achieve the necessary precision to avoid 'error catastrophe' but there has been an ever-increasing pressure to increase the fidelity of DNA replication. Perhaps the limiting factor is the cost to the cell of editing.</page><page sequence="28">378 A. R. Fersht REFERENCES Agarwal, G. S., Dube, K. D. &amp; Loeb, L. A. I979 J. biol. Chem. 254, 101-106.
