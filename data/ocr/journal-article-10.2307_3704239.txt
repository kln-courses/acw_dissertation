The distinguishing features of this movement have been theorized by fihnakers and critics sincc its presumed advent in the early 1940s. These theories work to propagate the notion that the neo- realist movement is determined through literary, theatrical, cinematic, philosophical, and contextually historical influences and has developed phenomenologically as such. 1 In effect, neorealism is historicized through a romantic hermeneutics, a traditional historical reading strategy that still dominates the contemporary academy despite moves in the past decade to introduce various strategies of poststructuralism and deconstructivism into humanities curricula.2 As a result of the pervasive use of developmen- talist phenomenology, the possibility of asking more radical questions about neorealism is precluded. This is because these more radical questions are those which work to explain culture not as a tropological constitution of originary or generic phenomena subject to progressive entropy, but as an arena in which social groups (for instance, those ordered into such catego- ries as gender, class, and race) are engaged in a struggle for control of cultural sense-making apparati (or knowledge practices, or frames of intel- ligibility), one of which is the cinema.

Zavarzadeh have termed the task of "radical critical theory."3 What in the final analysis it can provide is an understanding of how and to what purpose cultural phenomena, such as a neorealist filrn text, are displaced by llegemonic knowledge practices on the historicopolitical plane of social relations.4 In spite of the strength of such a program for enlarging their knowledge of neorealist films, the great majority of historians and theorists prefer to settle for politically safe analyses oftheir auteurist, narratirre, and aesthetic discourses, thereby reinforcing the dominant humanist concept of social and cultural subjectivity as a function of opaque generic forces. However, as Foucault stresses in discussing his own theory of subjectivity, "What we call humanism has been used by Marxists, liberals, Nazis, Catholics.... What I am afraid of about humanism is that it presents a certain form of our ethics as a universal model for any kind of freedom. I think there are more secrets, more possible freedoms, and more inventions in our future than we can imagine in humanism as it is dogmatically represented on every side of the political rainbow: the Left, the Center, the Right."s Indeed, the radical contemporaneity of neorealism to Nazism, Christian Democracr, and Gramscian and Hegelian Marxism, among other political structures, is bla- tantly ignored in the context of humanist reading strategies which, in the tradition of the Enlightenment pgce Kant,6 inscribe a universalized ethics into oppositional aesthetic categories (good-bad, expression-content, nature-cukure). Such strategies delimit the critical process to the fimction- ing of a universal cognitive capacity (for instance, consciousness) or mediating agency (desire) which any number and configuration of inno- vative formal alterations leave structurally intact. With the terms of the oppositions thus dialectically reinscribed, the global picture the recog- nition not only of dialectics per se, but of the historicopolitical conditions 3See Donald Morton and Mas'ud Zavarzadeh, C'The Nostalgia for Law and Order and the Policing of Knowledge: The Politics of Contemporary Literary Theory," Syracuse Schol6¢r, suppl.

A Critique of Postwar Crisis Theories," Rethinki Marxism 2 [ 1988]: 86). For me, social value is as much the social meaning-fimctions of class, race, and gender categories as those of material re- sources (capital, labor) and regional political power structures. 5Rux Martin, "Truth, Power, Self: An Interview wlth Michel Foucault," in Technolo,gies of the Setf:A Seminar with Michel Fowcault, ed.

Of the preponderance of ethical oppositions inscribed into neorealist film textuality, perhaps the most pervasive and at the same time most widely ignored by film scholars is that of a male-female gender economy com- monly referred to as sexual difference. This economy, conceptualized as mediated by a universal agency of desire, not only stratifies gender into op- positionalities but also conflates or condenses these into polarized categories of desire itself. Thus the male-female economy becomes the ac- tive/masculine-passive/feminine economy, primarily on the basis of what may be called, to borrow Simon Watney's phrase, "a vulgar behaviourist reading of heterosexual sex."7 Such a reading recalls the traditional pa- triarchal theoretical approaches of psychoanalysis and sexology8 and constitutes by very definition the politics of heterosexism. According to these approaches, the binary economy is dialectically self-contained; often dogmatic acceptance of what are deemed its originary and determining ca- pacities, those suspended states of desire such as bisexuality and polymor- phism, serves to limit knowledge ofthe economyto a subjective experience of the body framed by a cognitive mode of intelligibility. Whether that body is considered a site of biological or linguistic determinism, the terms of its recognition are nonetheless relegated to the sensible experience of opaquet gendered desire,9 no matter if that desire be polarized into tradi- tional heterosexual complementarity, combined into androgyny, or set into a bisexual alternation. Thus bound, the economy occludes its radical the- oretical recognition, the discovery of its limits as the complex condition of political struggle-a situationalityl°- where common thought is still dominated by ideologies shrouding their patriarchal technique in a guise of sexual mystery. The question of why this operation has been overlooked and thus tac- icly reified-by neorealist film scholars of the contemporary academy has as 7Simon Watney, Policin,g Desire: Pornography, AIDS, and the Media (Minneapolis, 1987), p. 27. 8See Sigmund Freud, Civilization and Its Discontents, trans. and ed.

In view of what Marx notes as the mystification through the capitalist system of its modes of pro- duction for the sake of constructing the illusion of its dialectical self- perpetuation,l2 it becomes doubtful that the theoretical obfilscation ofthe dominant modes through which filrn texts are made intelligible is not impli- cated in the struggles facing such a system, especially when it can be shown that the obfuscation, like the relations of capital, works dialectically to position Foucault's "more possible freedoms" indeed those of socially oppressed groups- on a pedestal of impossibility, of utopian idealism. Morton's statement is thus well taken: "The acceptance of opacities of whatever kind, after all, only supports the dominant view of alterities as blots- indeed stains-on the map of culture drawn and regulated by pa- triarchal capitalism.''l3 Undoubtedly, it is in relation to dominant ideological structuring of neorealist textuality that (its) signification of al- terior sexual pleasures is ultimately contained by a heterosexist economics whereby their radical conditions of possibility are perpetually marginal- ized. In resistance to this operation, neorealist texts must be read critically, as partisan to patriarchal capitalist hegemony whose limits may be located at sites of textual contradiction, where ruptures in discourse signify global contestation, the concrete political struggles between marginal and central modes of (sexual) intelligibility. A radical critique of neorealist textuality 1 1Patriarchal hegemony in contemporary academic discourses is discussed by Michael W.

SamuelMoore andEdwardAveling, ed. FriedrichEngels [NewYork, 1967], 1:23- 24). Louis Althusser supersedes this position in stressing the function of ideology in this masking operation, although neither he nor Marx have managed to sufficiently work through the limits of structuralism. See his "Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses," in Lenin and PhilosoPhy and Other Essays, trans. Ben Brewster (New York, 1971). As the "post- Althusserian" work of P. Macherey, R. Balibar, and D. Laporte suggests, however, inspection of the function of illusion and ideology is, nonethelesso invaluable to a radical understanding of the dialectical inscription of ethico-aesthetic oppositionalities into (neorealist Slm) texts.

Such disclosure is most strongly enabled through inspection of the way same-gender sex practice, known commonly as homosexuality, is repre- sented in neorealist films.l4 Primarily constructed in terms of cultural stereotypes, homosexuality appears repeatedly in these films through con- ventions of metaphor and metonym, often in proportions of political allegory. This means that those historically material (socioeconomic) strug- gles constituting cultllral conceptualizations of homosexual subjectivity are sublated; their contradictions are resolved in an idealized third term. Homosexuality is emptied ofthe complex historicopolitical reality ascribed to it by such theorists as John D'Emilio,l5 as it comes to signify some- thing other than itself) whether that something be a psychic symbol or an entire social phenomenon, references which in this case are more or less deprecating. Seen to transcend materiality, to represent philosophical issues of moral arld ethical proportionsr homosexuality is no longer a his- toricopolitical category designating sarne-gender sex practice, but the indicator of all that is wrong with society the signifier of the transgression of bourgeois humarsist mores. In neorealist textuality, this transgression is conceptualized through dis- courses of pure evil, romantic decadence, existential libidinal freedom, or proto-Genetian criminalitJv. Whatever the form, such transgression never poses a real threat to the system it purportedly knocks; it, like the economy circumscribing it, is delimited by conventions of bourgeois knowledge practice that prevent it from signifying anything other than an ideal phe- nomenon of that very system. In the bourgeois imagination, homosexual- ity does not actually exist; it is the substallce of dreams, a necessarily repressed desire. Its deployment in terms of such conventionalism certainly sheds critical light on statements by C:. Zavattini and L. Visconti that neo- realism is a phenomenological practice, a searcll for essence or so-called 14Since) for me, ;'gay3t subjectivity is a political concept historically comprehensible only in light of the Stonewall Rebellion of 1969, I prefer to use the term ;'same-gender sex prac- tice" in reference to what at one historical conjuncture and in certain cultural discourses may be called sChomosexuality) and at/in others) Cigay" subjectivity. As I will illustrate) the use of the word C;homosexuality3' is most appropriate in describing the discursive structuring of same-gender sex practice in Italian neorealist films. l5John D'Emilio asserts that there is a concrete historical connection between, for exam- ple, "the emergence of gay identity under capitalism) and the mechanisms specific to capitalism that made this possible and that reproduce homophobia as well" (from "Capitalism and Gay Identity," in Powers of Desire, ed.

Bazin, is any- thing but ideologically pure (as if this were ever either possible or desirable);l7 it only follows that homosexualitiv conceptualized in these terms could and would be deployed as a viable signifier within a cinematic morality play working to reify the operation of its own hegemonic practice. Such deployment is nowhere more apparent than in Roma, citta apertg [Rome, open city], the first film of director Roberto Rossellini's postwar trilogy, considered by many a landmark testimonial to the postwar condi- tion of Italian society and its film industry, and which is therefore critically situated in relation to postwar socioeconomic liberation and reconstruc- tion.l8 Its problematic discursive deployment of homosexuality therefore opens an exceptional political space wherein the radical critical theorist may explore not only the relationship of capitalism to fascism but the man- ner in which the former maintains its hegemony at a moment of acute socioeconomic crisis. What I am suggesting is that the scapegoating of ho- mosexuals through the conventions of oppressive discourses inscribed in the Rotna text is partisan to this hegemonie: operation, despite what some neorealist theorists claim is the ontological openness, the nonjudgmental quality, ofthe narratives ofthe Rossellini trilogy, of whichRoma is the first. Theorist Stuart Sim is astutely critical of such undetermination, [in] the open-ended narrative, where the individual can fill in the de- tails as he goes along without being committed to any predetermined pattern or conclusion such as grand narrative enforces.... We re- move the teleological constraints . . . in order to make room for individual initiative.

What for example happens regarding Romg is that the contradictions of the precarious and complex political transition from prewar fascism to postsvar capitalism-a central thematic concern ofthe fiJm-are masked by the resolving of these in a manner that both would ideally displace resent- ment toward, arld perhaps anxiety over, the lingering presence of former Italian Fascists onto the Nazis and sublate the social struggle between the Left and the Right, implicated in this uneasiness, into a homosexual meta- phor of such invidiousness that its transgression of sexual mores and gender positioning literally suggests a Reichian parallel to the societal ma- levolence of nazism20 (this despite the ironic fact that both nazism and Italian fascism proved homosexuality's greatest adversaries during World War II)S21 In this film, the classic psychoanalytic conceptualization of ho- mosexuality as deviant and self-destructive is deployed in an attempt to naturalize it, to explain it in terms of cognition, ofthe sensible experience of (warped) gendered subjectivit,v structured through universal conscious- ness, and thereby to obscure recognition of its political, discursive situationality. The mainstay of this concept is that homosexuality is a pathological phenomenon, a sexual perversion, the etiology of which traces it to, in schematic terms, a glitch in oedipal trajection resulting in an arrest of psychic growth at a narcissistic stage of development termed latency. In short, homosexuality is deemed to constitute an economy of psychic am- bivalence over gender position, a dialectics of narcissistic self-containment rather than complementary intersubjectivity, and as such it denies its con- stituents the possibility of developing the stable egos, coherent sensibili- ties, and moral and ethical loci presumably ascribed to heterosexuals.22 In 20See Wilhelm Reich, The Mass Psychotofly of Fascism, trans. Vincent R. Carfagno (New York, 1970). Also, see Bazin, p. 17, for evidence ofthis uneasiness. Also, note Bazin's (p. 17) indication of his anxiety over the postwar situation in this rather tendentious and problematic statement: "Fascism, which unlike Nazism allowed for the existence of artistic pluralism, was particularly concerned with cinema. One may have reservations about the connection be- tween the Venice film festival and the political interests ofthe Duce but one cannot deny that the idea of an international festival has subsequently made good, and one can measure its prac- tice today by the fact that five or six European countries are vying for the spoils. The capitalists and the Fascist authorities at least provided Italy with modern students." What we shall see is that fascist and postwar ruling parties as well as the Nazis provided Italy with oppressive ways of seeing (homo)sexualitJv. 2lSee Richard Plant, The Pink Triangle: The Nazi War against Homosencxals (New York, 1986). 22This definition is taken from Lacan (n. 9 above), p. 55.</page><page sequence="8">248 TERRI GINSBERG Roma, such deployment is structured through the illicit relationship be- tween Ingrid (Giovanna Galletti) and Marina (Maria Michi), a gestapo agent and her informant, respectively, whose homosexualities are allegories for their participation in a number of socially and politically transgressive activities. The overt subsumption of the complex historical phenomenon of nazism into a heterosexist discourse of gendered subjectivity implied by such structuring may be seen, in following, as highly suggestive ofthe pol- itics at stake with regard to the film text.23 The nexus of this subsumption is largely constituted through the dis- course of narcissism, or self-(reflexive) love. Ingrid is a Nazi and as such must be understood on a literal level as positioned through a political dis- course promoting self-aggrandizement in a most salient fashion. This is underscored cinematically, upon Ingrid's first appearance in the narrative. Marina, an actress and sometime prostitute, is backstage in her dressing room when Ingrid, her contact, enters. Marina is seated at her vanity fac- ing its mirror, so that when Ingrid enters, she is viewed by Marina vis-a- vis her reflection in this mirror. In this way, Ingrid's introduction to the spectator, and the initial establishrnent of her subjectivity in the nar- rative, is ideologically significant, since it is achieved via the cinematic convention of self-reflexive re-presentation positioning her as a self-con- scious misrecognition, a so-called signifier of imaginary Otherness rather than full and complete (three-dimensional) subjectivity (autonomous bourgeois individualism). Ingrid appears without subjective foundation, as a mirror image whose only possible fianction is to reflect the so- cioeconomic conditions (imperialist exploitation) making her very relationship with Marina possible. She is literally an incomplete subject, the stereotypical Nazi robot, an amoral creature who cannot think for her- self, who can survive only by following orders, by adhering or adapting to ruling structures. Through her, nazism is structured as a sexually perverse rather than historically material phenomenon. Marina is also represented as narcissistic, yet in more ambivalent terms than is Ingrid.24 She is an actress and prostitute who has agreed to serve as an informant for the gestapo and a sexual liaison to Ingrid in return for material rewards such as a large apartment, fancy clothing, expensive jewel- ry, contraband foodstuffs, and a modest sum of money. Her introduction to the spectator takes place in her backstage dressing room, where she is framed both with and within the mirror, as though her subjectivity is one 23See Ian Kershaw, "The Nazi State: An Exceptional State?" New Left Review 176 (1989): 47-67, for a lucid theorization ofthe Third Reich as a historically material complex. 24Lacan's comment underscores the psychoanalytic constitution of this structuring: 'CThere is no need to emphasize that a coherent theory ofthe narcissistic phase clarifies the fact ofthe ambivalexce proper to the 'partial drives' of scoptophilia, sadomasochism, and homosex- uality" (p. 25, my emphasis).</page><page sequence="9">Nazis and Driftets 249 which oscillates between a state of originary plenitude (presence) and rep- resentation (absence). While it is clear that she is a working-class woman aspiring to bourgeois status and as such complying with the very system oppressing her, the narrative suggests a psychoanalytic rather than histor- ical materialist reading of her struggle, structuring her subjectivity as a function of oscillating, fundamentally bisexual desire rather than as a posi- tionality theorized through the discourses of a hegemonic complex. Marina's professions acting and prostitution are conceptualized in psychoanalytic terms as involving the desire to be looked at or receive (sex- ual) attention in the form of material gratification (money, status). This suggests that such wish for gratification is (1) stronger than the capacity to adhere to ethical structures, to an altruistic loyalty to either boyfriend or country, as it affirms a perverse privileging of the physical over the ideal; (2) a monolithic determinant of political allegiance and, in turn, cultural construction; and (3) decadent) or dialectically self-destructive. Operating through all these factors is the ideology of patriarchal capitalism; each term collapses the economic exploitation implicit for an Italian woman in Marina's positioning during World War II onto a cognitive experience of . . . . . . narclsslstlc su ectlvlty. The masking of historical materiality here encourages a focus away from politics and toward the psychoanalytic reading that, at the same time she is narcissistic, Marina, unlike Ingrid, is not without feelings of guilt, since a male, Manfredi (Alarcello Pagliero) on whose resistance activities she is informing-is the object of her true love. WIarina is at least capable of three-dimensionality, of having a complementary, so-called mature rela- tionship based on ideal love rather than selfish gain. As with Ingrid) the trajectory of desire is the indicator of moral and ethical dimension. Iron- ically, the fact of l9Iarina's ambivalence is key to the understanding of her compliance with the Nazi/lesbian, since it is the very existence of her con- science, that aspect of subjectivity lacking in Ingrid7 which makes her vulnerable to the lure of Ingrid's particular mode of transgression. The alle- gorical suggestion here, of course, is that Italian collaboration with the Nazis was ultimately sexually (experientially) rather than politically (histor- ically) conditioned. This is illustrated by the fact that Marina is not, as is Ingridn constructed as active/masculine within the patriarchal gender economy; she retains her conventionally correct feminine status. Within the homosexual rela- tionship, she is the passive recipient of favors, what might be called the femme in modern lesbian discourse. In short, she is the seduced, whereas Ingrid is the seducer. This polarization is reinforced by the fact that Ingrid had initially enticed Marina into working for her by offering her narcotics and has since become the now-addicted Marina's drug supplier. In effect, political opportunism is sllbsumed by a discourse of sexual victimization;</page><page sequence="10">250 TERRI GINSBERG while the working-class Marina is constructed as an unfortunately misled, or duped, passive/feminine subject of bourgeois hegemony, Ingrid is con- structed as a stereotypical lesbian vampire who may use her evil powers to seduce vulnerable young women into her amoral lair and drain them of their life's blood,25 meaning their morality, their conscience, their abilitJv to choose, to discern good from evil, to see things straight or from a sober perspective. It is significant in view of the sobriety metaphor that Marina faints, when she glimpses Manfredi's battered corpse, whereas Ingrid looks on amusedly. Fainting is an act often caused by an imbalance attributed to drugs and/or love, and which, according to Lichtenberger, is the sign of conscientiousness or reawakened consciousness, of redemptive rebirth.26 In short, it is Marina's guilt and ambivalence which not only position her as classically feminine (neurotic, hysterical, potentially hostile to society) and therefore vulnerable to the lure of transgression,27 but at the same time shield her from the kind of totalized signification of gender, and in turn cultural, transgression in which Ingrid, in her status as a butch (mannish) lesbian, participates. Ingrid's construction as butch, as the most transgressive and therefore more ';authentic'' lesbian of the pair, is filrther signified by her positioning as sexually active in her relationship with Marina. She often attempts to embrace or caress an evasive Marina, or she is framed seated with her arm around a quiet, perhaps sedated Marina in a stereotypical male-female pose. Likewise, she is visually coded as a Marlene Dietrich prototype who, in her gestapo uniform and filr coat, suggests the kind of female trans- vestism and animal imaging often signified by the androgynous Dietrich persona and the sexually transgressive meaning thereby implied.28 Ingrid's costuming is not the only signifier of her stereotypically mas- culine positioning; she is also the bearer of what has been theorized as the classically masculine voyeuristic gaze. Whenever she regards or pursues Marina, Marina is seen to move outside the frame in which they are both positioned in order to avoid Ingrid's erotic gestures. This elusiveness along with her ambivalence construct Marina as the obscure object of Ingrid's desire, indeed so obscure that it is only through her faint subsequent to the murder of Manfredi that Ingrid is ultimately able to locate her vul- nerability, her so-called feminine weakness, and inflict on her her sadistic wiles: she revokes the filr coat and leaves the prostrate Marina for dead. 25It is telling that Lacan, as participant in patriarchal psychoanalytic discourse, refers to the so-called regression from heterosexuality to homosexuality as a Chomosexualizing cap- ture" ( p. 55, my emphasis). 26Cited in Jacques Derrida, Writin,g and Difference, trans.

In effect, Ingrid is structured into a classic fetishization of Marina, a displacement of narcissistic desire in which it is Marina's idealized image (as alluring, skillful performer) and constructed persona (as kept, suppressed woman) rather than her historical materiality (as duplicitous opportunist and sycophant) that Ingrid aggressively seeks to control. In this way, the narrative main- tains its psychoanalytic emphasis on a determining agency of narcissistic, perverse desire as the operative in the homosexual-cum-societal condition. The negativity of this relationship, its quality of decadence serving as a sign for the disintegration of culture, bears striking resemblance to the dis- course of the Hegelian Master-Slave relationship,29 later taken up in psychoanalytic discourse as sadomasochism. In such a relationship, al- though the slave is subservient to the master, she is the only one enabled to grasp the totality of her oppression, since only she is fundamentally inter- twined with the dialectics of its operation. The master, on the other hand, chooses to separate herself from reality, to live in an ideal world of "luxury and placeless freedom in which any consciousness of his own concrete sit- uation flees like a dream."30 With regard to the Slave discourse, the fact that Marina has a conscience signifies that she at least recognizes her du- plicity, whereas with regard to the Master discourse, Ingrid's lack of a conscience relegates her to blind fetishism, the ideal love of an illusion. Even if it is thus suggested that there is hope for Marina, the fact that her self-knowledge is determined relative to her experience of her classically conceptualized perverse subjectivity her quasi-hysterical oscillation be- tween hetero- and homosexuality-hers is never a radical recognition of the concrete conditions of her situation, only a containment device in her continued bisexual undetermination. Because of this structuring, the les- bian relationship appears as a veritable farce, a situation of constant mistrust and misrecognition that reaffirms the common societal prejudice that homosexuality constitutes an impossible, unrealizable love and there- by a powerless, literally empty threat to the patriarchal status quo.3l Quasi-erotic scenes between Marina and Ingrid underscore this point. 29G.

Miller (Oxford, 1977), pp. 111- 19. 30Fredric Jameson, "Third-World Literature in the Era of Multinational Capitalism," Social Text l 5 (1986): 85. 3lRegarding the concept of stereotyping diminishing threats to the status quo, note Watney: "The very existence of homosexual desire, let alone gay identities, are only adrnitted to the frame of mass media representations in densely coded forms, which protect the 'general public' from any threat of potential destabilisation" (p. 42).</page><page sequence="12">252 TERRI GINSBERG These moments are conspicuously bereft of music (diegetic or nondiegetic) and strong key lighting, so that a murky, subterranean, expressionistic sen- suality is effected. Moreover, insofar as Marina is always evading Ingrid's gaze by fleeing the frames in which that gaze is deployed, she is structured through the narrative as evading the spectatorial gaze as well. These tactics inscribe lesbian desire as opaque, thus affirming hegemonic discourses by stmcturing alterior erotic possibilities as a narrative tease, as gratuitous, excessive, phantasmagorical, and certainly tmreal phenomena. In contrast to this is the positioning of the film's male homosexual, the gestapo Major Bergmann (Harry Feist), who is depicted, despite other ster- eotypical attributes (for example, effeminacy and sadomasochism), as a sovereign subject in that he is, for all intents and purposes, single Whereas lesbianism is delimited by its inclusive dialectics, an equally totalizing con- tainment of male homosexuality is never inscribed. Bergmann is indeed framed via the same cinematic conventions as the other male characters in the film. In Roma, female sexuality in toto poses the potentially greater threat than male sexuality to hegemonic stability. Even the character of Pina (Anna Magnani), a woman who is clearly portrayed as heterosexual- she has one child, is pregnant with another, and is about to be married is subject to idealization, most emphatically through her death, an instarlce of narrative retribution for her transgressive extramarital sexual activities. Pina's construction is unique in the film. She is generally framed head- on, with strong key lighting, and her gestures are traced by fluid camera movement. Scenes in which she is speaking with other characters are repre- sented by a minimum of reverse shots; although engaged in dialogue, Pina is structured cinematically as engaged in monologue. Moreover, her speech is as fuid as the camera that tracks her. These factors strongly suggest that Pina represents an embodiment of classically self-reflexive, eternally present feniininity. The event of her death underscores this so strongly that it may be considered the climax of the film. Suddenly bereft of any extraneous diegetic sound (that is, crowd noise), the scene is framed through plan- sequerlce shooting, employing long shots and a subjective camera, so that an ideal neorealism in the Bazinian sense of ontological truth or absolute pres- ence is effected. It is as though, in its narrative uniqueness, the scene is both abstract and concrete, pace Bazin, "a presentation which is at once elliptic and synthetic."32 The threaterling status of such presence, however, is sig- nified by its narrative erasure; neither Pina nor a scene of such ontological affect will appear again in the film. Certainly, the so-called mysteries of female sexuality as represented at least throughout the history of the West in such works as Aristophanes' Thesmophoriolzusae or in discourses of the more recent ecriture feminine are 32Bazin (n. 17 above), pp. 97-98.</page><page sequence="13">Nazis a¢d Drif ers 253 understood as politically threatening if cxnly because they are s£ructured as inaccessible to those (men) for whom patriarchy is at stake.

The possibility of their radical sitin; is occludled and hence prevented from (lisengaging the teXtual illusions not only of pa- triarchy but also of patriarchy's contemporaneous global constitution capital from its claims to postwar dominarlce. Homosexuality as a sign of psychic ambivalence or narcissism is also de- ployed through a discourse of existential libidinal freedom within Italian neorealist textuality. This occurs most clearly in Ossessioxe, the earliest ofthe neorealist films and also the first inscribed with discourses of (iramscian Marxism.33 EspeciaW because of this latter, its misrecognition of homo- sexuality opens space for a critique of its allegorical representation of Italian Communism arld Christian Democracy. By rtlegating homosex- uality to a status "beyondt' regional political foundations to the unbound space ofthe lumpen proletariat (a strategy echoed years later by Pasolini3,34 the filrn is positing an opposition between two modes of ordering intel- ligibility whereby the first, organized politics, merely constitutes various configurations ofthe same hegemonic stmctures, and by which the second, theorization of a radical political program, is deemed inconceivable. This oppositionality is positionecl by the filmts narrative, in which the protagonist, Ciino (Alassimo Girotti), an out-of-workdrifter, is the locus of choice between tlle homosexuality of Lo Spagnuolo (Elio Marcuzo), arz independent traveling perfiormer of dubious national origins-a veritable "citizen of the world3t-and the hetere3sexuality of (;iovanna (Clara Ca- lamai), a working-class woman married (read: prostituted) to a provincial bourgeois tavern owner, Bragana (Juan De Larlcla).

Because homosexuality allegorizes the es- sence of this baseless dream world, an illicit transgression of possible (heterosexual) economics, and because the political space its radical knowl- edge opens is foreclosed by cultural opacity, it once again comes to signify a utopian ideal that poses no substantial threat to the status quo. While the homosexual relationship between Gino and Lo Spagnuolo is, as with Ingrid and Marina, signified in terms of the psychoanalytic dis- course of narcissistic self-reflexivity, it is complicated by the operation of another discourse, that of existential phenomenology, whereby the whole of reality is conceptualized as an a priori condition of self-effacement. This complexity may be inspected by comparing the way in which relationships are represented during Gino's erotic sequences with both Giovanna and Lo Spagnuolo. Upon first meeting Giovanna, Gino is framed from her point of view, as the camera not only focuses on him but conspicuouslyzooms in on his fully lit face from what has been established through a previous re- verse shot as her position in the room. This zoom is accompanied by a crescendo of one of the romantic musical motifs used to signify the erotic attraction betxveen Giovanna and Gino throughout the film. At this point, then, Giovanna is given to adopt a masculine stance in relation to a sexually objectified, or eroticized, and, by extension, feminized Gino. Her position is underscored by her statement, "Non sono cuoca [I'mnot acook]," which places her outside the stereotypical feminine realm of bourgeois house- wifery. Yet the instability of her position and the political possibility it offers Gino the conventional (heterosexual) working-class life idealized by the Italian Communist party-is asserted during the bedroom scene, in which she sits with her back toward Gino, evading due to shame of adultery what she perhaps feels is his erotic gaze, and Ginors eyes (and ears) focus elsewhere-eyes on the ceiling or far wall, ears soon after on the interior, phantasmagorical sounds of a seashell- as they refise an intersubjective function and aim whatever attraction Gino is projecting into a self-reflec- tive mode. His self-absorption is underscored by the camera, which rather than eroticize Giovanna renders her sexually opaque, as a lucid view of her sparsely clad body is obscured by heavy shadowing. While Giovanna is thus structured into an oscillation betsveen activity and neutrality, the lighting fragments and thus further objectifies/femi- 35See Sim (n. 19 above) for a convincing argument on the radical insuiciency of oppos- ing foundationalist and antifoundationalist modes of thought.</page><page sequence="15">Nazis omd Driftews 255 nizes Gino. During an earlier sequence in which Giovanna appears transfixed by the sight of him, so that she is unable to efficiently performher wifely duty of sorting a basket of eggs, only his shoulder and upper arm are lit. Twice during the bedroom scene, the use of a mirror is invoked to strengthen Gino's objectified position. This first occurs just after the sexual encounter (ellipsized by a scene between Bragana, by whom Gino is now employed, and a country priest [Vittorio Duse]), as Gino combs his hair before a mirror in which he and we see reflected the figure of Giovanna in bed. Here, the presumed object of his desire is mediated by the mirror, signifier of (self-)reflection, so that the object is positioned through a nar- cissistic rather than intersubjective economy. At another point, Gino moves into a frame in which Giovanna is looking at herself in the mirror; whereas both her face and its reflection are visible in this shot, only the re- flection of Gino's face is added to it when he approaches her from behind. It is significant that at this momentt Giovanna is speaking about the degree of financial commitment she requires of a lover, and Gino is wearing a hat in the same clownish manner in which Lo Spagnuolo will soon be seen wear- ing his. Indeed, during a most salient subsumption of political economy into an allegory of (hetero)sexuality, and with that, an affirmation of the structures of cognitive politics conditioning the possibility of such prob- lematic linkage, Gino is represented as an elusive reflection, a childish character more wrapped up in the imaginary world of a seashell than the world of historically material reality. He lacks the multidimensionality that Giovanna so clearly displays in her guilt-ridden speech about the duplicity she performs with Bragana and would perhaps transfer into a relationship with Gino. Gino's unmasculine nalvete is carried over into scenes with Lo Spa- gnuolo, although the meaning ofthis subjectification is shifted onto the site of homosexuality by a contrast in music and narrative structuring. Whereas romantic motifs resound during Gino's scenes with Giovanna, his scenes with Lo Spagnuolo are often accompanied by popular street music. Significantly, the romantic music is conveyed via stringed, orchestral in- struments (violins), while the popular is played on a single harmonica or accordion. The reference here is clarified when viewed in terms of the con- trasting ellipses employed to signify the sexual encounters. For the heterosexual encounter with Giovanna, the narrative is ruptured by inser- tion of the stereotypically masculine activity (a hunting trip) of Bragana and the priest, who respectively represent modes ofthe dominant ideology, commerce and religion. This ellipsis consumes narrative time and involves a spatial shift. In contrast, the encounter with Lo Spagnuolo is split by the extinguishing of a match, a match which not only lights a cigarette recalling the initial meeting of the two men, but in its extinction elicits a puff of smoke whereby a significant shift in temporality (from night to morning) is</page><page sequence="16">256 TERRI GINSBERG effected. Illicit (adulterous) heterosexuality thus becomes a complex act of pulling strings, of operating in complementarity with of negotiating- dominant ideological structures. (Illicit) homosexuality, on the other hand, is a simple and direct act of striking and/or blowing, of being grasped in a flash or the blink of an eye, which while ultimately condensed and ide- alized just as problenzatically as is heterosexuality in the film, is represented in the somewhat more ontological fashion that places it not simply in a space of instability, but in a realrn of veritable impossibility. The structuring ofthis impossibility is further exemplified through the relative representation of Gino and Lo Spagnuolo during their bedroom scene. Here, as in the bedroom scene with Giovanna, Gino is objectified by the lighting, although at other times he takes on a neutral position never assumed with Giovanna. When he removes his shirt before Lo Spagnuolo's gaze, his shoulder is not highlighted. When Lo Spagnuolo moves to touch him for the first time, he remains almost completely in shadow. At other moments, for example during a dialogue extended by a long take, he is posi- tioned with strong key lighting, while Lo Spagnuolo remains in the dark. Gino's alternation as such between femininity and neutrality is most starkly emphasized during a series of frontal shots in which Lo Spagnuolo, ap- proaching Gino, is preceded by his shadow, which appears on the wall between the two men; and in which Gino, approaching Lo Spagnuolo, is preceded by his shadow in the same way. While with Giovanna, Gino is never sexually neutralized (as is Giovanna), merely structured as narcissis- tic (that is, feminine). With Lo Spagnuolo, he is neutralized, and that through the structuring of his sexuality as not only nonpresent (for prac- tical as well as ideological reasons, so as to avoid the film's possible censorship by Italian authorities) but as contained in toto: the camera nev- er takes up the direct erotic point of view of Lo Spagnuolo, as it does with Giovanna, so that the homosexual relationship remains safely obscured from the gaze ofthe patriarchal spectator.36 In effect, homosexuality is con- structed as a relationship between alter egos, between formless substances that can never signify anything but unreality because they are stuck in a suspended state of (sexual) signification preventing their conventional grounding in a patriarchal, male-female gender economy deemed prerequi- site for that (sensible) experience of consciollsness constituting reality for dominant structures.37 36The fact that the cameraman for this film, Aldo Tonti, was a lover to Visconti is interest- ing to note here, although his taking the indexical position of a woman in his subjective framing of Gino fits only too neatly into the vulgar heterosexual behaviorist model. 37Barthes's term "neutralization" is germane to this reading, since it is a concept theorized as "the phenomenon whereby a relevant opposition loses its relevance . . . [whereby] the tsvo pieces [of the opposition] are absorbed into a kind of 'archi-vesteme"'; they "fall under the heading of a single signified' (Roland Barthes, Elements of Semiology, trans. Annette Lavers and Colin Suiith [New York, 1967], pp. 80, 83-84).</page><page sequence="17">Ngzis gnd Drifters 257 It is along these lines that, as ambivalent locus between heterosexuality and homosexuality, Gino's situation is structured as a condition of pre- cariously bound choice. The discourse of choice is ideologically significant, since variety is a prime operative in the reproduction of both capitalist economy and its complicit subjects, where it shares space with concepts of laissez-faire, pluralism, and liberal tolerance. Because Gino's (and for that matter, Marinazs) ambivalence is structured in Lacanian-Althusserian terms as a cognitive process of subjective interpellationwhereby the self- reflexive gaze confronted with contradictory images of hegcmonic dis- course effects a psychic splitting along those self-same hegemonic lines it becomes a self-policing device that affords them only the most decadent alternative. It is as though, for them, life in relation to nonpatriarchal cap- italist structures might only occur in death This is literalized as Gino is betrayed to the police by his symbolic alter ego. Lo Spagnuolo is depicted signified by his shadow seen through a glass window in the door ofthe police station, so that the opacity of his being- its capacity to be (fill)filled with/by contradictory and/or multivalent dis- courses is visually figured, and his confessional relationship with the police becomes the hegemonic grounding, the displaced siting, ofthe pol- itics implicated in his struggle with Gino.38 Indeed, his only utterance at the station is a subjectifying response, a concession of his identity to the authorities. This is significant not only because his name is a pseudonym and therefore a form offraud) but because it is not "proper" in patriarchal terms; it is a metonym for national uncertainty, oftreachery, of disloyalty to the (Italian) family name. In Kierkegaardian terms, the lack of a family en- vironment signified by Lo Spagnuolo's lack of a proper name neutralizes the tension between good and evil, the anxiety deemed necessary to a con- ception of ethical subjectivity.39 By announcing his pseudonym to the police, Lo Spagnuolo is thus affirming the amorality as well as the crimi- nality of his relationship with Gino, so that the discourse of libidinal freedom gives way to one of espionage and betrayal, thus feeding into the discourse of homosexual double-agency deployed since at least the time of Plato's representation of the relationship between Socrates and Alcibiades.4° In effect, while positioned to gaze only at shadows, Lo Spa- gnuolo and Gino may on the one hand be read to possess a symbolic inward vision, or insight, which, when projected onto an alter ego, trans- forms symbolic displacement of narcissistic desire into an emancipatory gesture. Yet insofar as the freedom of such a gesture is belied by duplicity, 38See Michel Foucalllt, The History of Sexuality: An Introduction, vol. 1 of The History of Sexualityn trans.

Walter Hamilton (New York, 1951).</page><page sequence="18">258 TERRI GINSBERG its sexual and historical materiality is neutralized; the homosexuals, in their freedom, are ironically the agents of thcir own destruction. This is firther emphasized by the fact that the police are the literal possessors of the legal gaze in the film. Whenever Gino and Lo Spagnuolo argue? they are watched and even confronted by the police; whereas whenever Gino and Giovanna are involved in a confrontation (from car crash to love scene), they are merely noticed by the surrounding populace. It is thereby suggested that heterosexuality is somehow an expressible position, where- as homosexuality in any form is sure to be (re)contained by legal tech- nology. A metonymy of things that flow, such as water and money, works to un- derscore this policing operation as part of the politics of the homosexual fimction. Lo Spagnuolo and Gino are often framed as seated in two-shot along the banks of a river. In classic psychoanalytic discourse, water is asso- ciated with the presumed safety of the womb and as such with a form of ideal security to which the subject may only eternally return in fantasy. In this sense, the flow of the river may be paralleled to the flow of desire, whose dialectical operation with respect to the ideological gender econo- my is elusive, obscure, and ultimately insatiable except in the transcendence of death. Its deployment in the frame with Lo Spagnuolo and Gino is thus significant in view of the libidinal transcendence their homosexuality is also deployed to signify. This parallel signification is figured by the visual fact that Lo Spagnuolo and Gino are seated on the edge of the riverr sug- gesting their position on the margins, and thus their transgressionr of bourgeois culture. It also, however, signifies the containment oftheir trans- gression, since the trajectory of eternal return signifies not only safety but also death. Indeed, framed from behind and shot from below, it often ap- pears that Lo Spagnuolo arld Gino are one step from a fall into the river's voracious current. Consideration ofthe symbolism ofthe river in Hegelian discourse is ger- mane to this reading. For Hegel, rivers are "great Streams" that signify the transitory movement of history, since they literally fertilize the land, thus allowing for the development of civilization. This romantic hermeneutics also circumscribing Freudian discourse filrther suggests that bodies of water in general are what literally both unite and separate land masses and therefore the people on them; they are the means whereby the latter may obtain the ('feeling [of their] own infinite' that is at the same time sub- missive and dangerously violent. This dialectical iinction is filrthermore that which "invites man . . . to honest gain and commerce'';4l it is that ecorlomic means unavailable to the transgressive homosexual couple for whom the flow of money is as intransigent as that of desire. 4lHegel, ThePhilosophy of History trans.

Sibree (New York 1956) pp. X8, 90-91.</page><page sequence="19">Ngzis and D"fters 259 Lo Spagnuolo literalizes this metaphor, which associates the flow of money, water, and desire, as he mentions that money 'imoves" while solicit- ing Gino as a quasi-prostitute. Gino is constructed as prostituting himself to Lo Spagnuolo, accepting money from him in return for sexual favors, participating, through the engagement of his desire, in political economy. This engagement is however, obfiuscating, since it figures the collapse of bourgeois value onto desire whereby desire is conceived as the universal cultural determinant Gino's collaborative relationship with Lo Spagnuolo can as such be read as transcendental in terms of its movement "beyond') the historicopolitical reality of the dialectics of capital, despite what might at first glance appear its situation therein. With their relationship delimited by exist,ential and psychoanalytic discourses, Lo Spagnuolo and Gino's ho- mosexuality comes to signify a discursive masking of historical materiality. Its structuring, in its ideality, is none other than ideological; its apparent (libidinal) freedom, none other than the very site of ideological instability. It is as though, through the allegory of the unbound (homosexual) rela- tionship, the narrative were positing the unfortunate inevitabilityn the necessity, indeed the economic practicality, of patriarchal capitalism. The contradictions of the problematics (of history) opened by this disposition are thus sutured by a faulty seam that (dis)covers heterosexism as com- . . . . P lClw Wlth t le status quo. With this in mind, it is significarlt that Gino takes part in Lo Spa- gnuolos circus act, a derivative of commedie dell'arte) in which he performs the role of a signpost advertising the act.42 His role as a medie performer suggests the portrayal of traditional character types often represented by the use of masks. In the case of Gino and Lo Spagnuolo) this convention can be taken as a reference to the quality of their relationship that masks its economic grounding. In addition, performance itself is an unstable, dialec- tical operation, especially when it incorporates typage.43 Its association with the operation of capital is thus literalized by Gino's gesticular act of carrying the placard that requests that spectators attend the show and thus spend money on tickets. Because commedie tradition may filrthermore be traced to the phallic sight gags of the ancient Greek satyr plays, the fact that Gino calls the placard he is wearing a sCsign on [his] back') may be read to refer to his own satyrical positioning and thus) since saryrs were conceived as inhuman creatures parading their phalli around in the nude, his status as phallic symbol, as signifier of an impossible, total, immortal desire that is 42A reading of Gino-with-placard in terms ofthe Oerridean C'signsponge' is helpfiMX since it is conceived as "an indefaigable mediator, shuttling between the parties of an impossible contract.

When Lo Spagnuolo makes his fatefill visit to the police, historical ma- terialism is once again masked by the collapse of bourgeois value onto the operation of desire. Lo Spagnuolo's confession occurs in the narrative shortly after Gino's return to Giovanna; Lo Spagnuolo's loss is structured as sexual rather than economic. Indeed, Gino's role as performer is so sat(y)(i)rical that his status as financial asset to Lo Spagnuolo is obfils- cated. Therefore, Lo Spagnuolo's confession is structured as a function of jealousy, an operation understood in Kleinian thought as dialectical,45 over his certain loss of Gino to Giovanna, rather than in tlle concrete terms of opportunism. In classic fashion, Lo Spagnuolo chooses to act upon his jealous desire with interpellated hostility (rather than empathy), by "throwing back on to the world the disorder of which his being is com- posed,"46 and as such serves to index the bourgeois situationality of the discourses of pathological criminality and double-agency circumscribing his homosexual fimction within the text What is in short suggested through the operation of the discourse of ambivalence is the mortal impossibility of ideal freedom and the inev- itability of subjective oscillation within a politIcosexual economy mediated by an essential agency of desire, of which homosexuality is deemed a dan- gerous yet tempting form. Therefore, in Ossessione) as inRomg, homosexual subjectivity is conceptualized in romantic humanist terms, as a perversion that can only signify the very universal core from which it deviates. This is not to suggest that ('fair" representation of homosexuality means simply making it three-dimensional in the sense of bourgeois individuality. That would merely mean that the homosexual be allowed to possess a con- science, an internalized police force. Instead, what is necessary to a radical program of representing sex practice and what is missing from these films because of their political stakes is its strategic depiction through a mode of intelligibility that problematizes the totality of the ideological gender 44Fredric Jameson, Marxism and Form: Twentieth-CenturyDialectical Theories of Literatxre (Princeton, NJ, 1971), p. 92. 45See Melanie Klein, Enry and Gratitude and Other Words: 1946-1963, vol. 3 of The Writ- in,gs of Melanie Klein (New York, 1975). 46Lacan (n. 9 above), p. 20.</page><page sequence="21">Nazis and Drifters 261 economy, which puts into question those cognitive frames of understand- ing through which such experiential cultural concepts as sexual determinism work to relegate radical questioning of the reproductive operation of capital to the status of metaphysical, immaterial, and there- fore totalizing and senseless abstraction.47 For, more than representing same-gender sex practice in oppressive, psychoanalytic-based terms-as "homosexuality"-and thereby perpetuating by its mere pervasiveness in neorealist film textuality48 negative stereotypes considered commonsen- sical by large numbers of spectators and scholars, such relegation is implicated in the occlusion of alternative ways of knowing the world and the radical pleasures that may be theorized and experienced thereby. As suggested throughout this paper, the strategy enabling such the- orization is one which interrogates the ideological factor of romantic hermeneutics, which, in Foucauldian terms, sees the containment of ho- mosexuality through discourses of pathology, criminality, evil, decadence, and existential freedom as an operation of patriarchal capitalist hegemony. At a historical conjuncture where the liberties allotted gays and lesbians in the wake of Stonewall are falling prey to powerfill political constituencies, where the great majority of major Hollywood releases represent gay men (lesbians are rarely mentioned) through oppressive discourses,49 and where therefore gays and lesbians themselves are being led to take for granted the terms of containment the terms of liberal tolerance, of the inevitability of the negotiative iisystem" that at once extends and revokes liberties such a strategy can and should no longer be foreclosed. 47I am influenced in my use ofthe concept of "experiential culturalism" by Donald Mor- ton, " 'Class' Wars at the Limits of the Containment of Politics" (paper read at the Modern Language Association convention, Washington, DC, January 1990). 48 These oppressive structures can be found in such classic neorealist films as Rocco e i soui fratelli [Rocco and his brothers]) directed by Luchino Visconti, Titanus/Films Marceau, 1960; Ladri di biciclette [Bicycle thieves], directed by Vittorio de Sica, P.D.S., 1948; Germania omno zero [Germany, year zero], directed by Roberto Rossellini, Teverfilm-Sadfi., 1947; and La Terra Trema (Episodia de Mare), directed by Luchino Visconti, Universalia, 1947. 49This according to Vito Russo, "The Celluloid Closet," lecture presentation, New York City Public Theater, December 1989.</page></plain_text>
