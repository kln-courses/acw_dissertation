<plain_text><page sequence="1">Thomas Zummer: Portraits of Robots. Frederieke Taylor Gallery. At first glance, the new robot portraits by author and scholar Thomas Zummer, on view at Frederieke Taylor this summer, seem to be photographs. The detail is astonishingly realistic and the variation in surface texture suggests the graininess of a photo. When closer examination reveals them to be graphite drawings, the viewer may chalk up the fastidiousness of the ren dering to a kind of nostalgic fetishism of old technology. But Zummer is up to some thing more complex with these drawings, proposing correlations between the modes of reproduction and representation invol ved in robotics and portraiture. While they look like stills from a 1950s sci-fi flick, each of the eight por traits in the series is a drawing of a photo graph of an actual robot. Sabor (2000) depicts a robot from the '50s that had nip ples and smoked cigarettes, and MOBOT II (2000) features a mobile robot designed by an American aircraft company to replace humans in radioactive areas.
