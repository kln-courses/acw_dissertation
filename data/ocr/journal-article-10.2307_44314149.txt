Pp.272. $45.00. Thomas E. Jenkins argues convincingly that throughout the twentieth century characterizations of God in cosmopolitan (educated) theology have been less than engaging because of their lack of real complexity. This he attributes to the re- sidual effects of the neoclassical and sentimental literary styles of characteriza- tion predominant in North America at the beginning of the nineteenth century. Rather than embrace the potential for complex and ambivalent representations of God's nature as offered by Romanticism, conservative and liberal theologians alike persisted, through the nineteenth century and well into our own, with "flat" and "vague" characterizations. Jenkins begins Part One with a sustained account of the spectrum of influ- ences that came to shape American theology at the beginning of the nineteenth century, influences that collectively contributed to the supremacy of neoclassical and sentimental perceptions of God. Included in this section is a brief, interest- ing treatment of the development of Puritan attitudes to the study of literature. A critical element, the author points out, was the shift from a juristic tradition to philanthropism under the influence of theologians such as Socinius. In this re- sultant theological climate God was to be viewed as serene, consistent, and all- loving. Champions of philanthropism dismissed the primitive, anthropomor- phic character of God in the Old Testament and downplayed the notion of divine wrath. There was therefore an attempt to avoid or rationalize the problematic aspects of the divine nature. A detailed account is given of the approaches and responses to philanthropism adopted by William Ellery Channing, Edwards A. Park, Charles Hodge, and Archibald Alexander Hodge. The anguish suffered by Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane and on the cross tested neoclassical theological assumptions regard- ing the serenity of God's nature. ,The interplay of nuanced responses to such difficulties by these key figures in American theology is one of the strongest sec- tions in Jenkins' work. The particular nature of sentimental incarnationalism, the other major trend that Jenkins identifies as failing to portray God with complexity, is also carefully delineated. Specific reference is made to two key exponents, Henry Ward Beecher</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 507 and Harriet Beecher Stowe. Their depictions of God accentuated the family and divine love, and they also attempted to resolve any inconsistencies in their ideal- ized view of Christ's personality. Significant works were Beecher 's The Life of Jesus , the Christ (1871) and Stowe 's Woman in Sacred History (1873) as well as Footsteps of the Master (1877). Jenkins demonstrates in Part Two that there were theologians throughout the nineteenth century who did depict the character of God as having complexity; their work, however, did not have any impact on twentieth- century characteriza- tions. W. G. T. Shedd's Romantic anthropomorphism accentuated the invigorat- ing nature of God's wrath, assessing this quality as a sign of divine vitality. Others such as James Henley Thornwell, George Griffin, and Samuel J. Baird focused on the Trinity as a means of highlighting God's complexity. They found in the inter- active nature of the Trinity something analogous to sexual desire. Horace Bushnell's liberal anthropomorphism also emphasized, in a contentious man- ner, God's powerful and turbulent nature. So, Jenkins concludes, it was possible to develop more complex characterizations. Jenkins concludes his sweep of two centuries of American theology in Part Three. By examining the work of Theodore Munger and Amos N. Wilder, he illus- trates how the God of cosmopolitan theology had indeed become "vague." He proposes this to be true also in the liberal social-gospel movement of Walter Rauschenbusch and in the responses of both Reinhold Niebuhr and J. Gresham Machem. Carl Henry, he suggests, despite being a conservative theologian, stripped biblical passages of their anthropomorphic emphasis. Harvey Cox main- tained in The Secular City (1965) that God was diffused through humanity rather than having a distinctive character, stating that "God wants man to be interested not in [H]im, but in his fellow man." Francis Schaeffer, Martin Luther King, Jr., and some feminist theologians, Jenkins argues, also exhibit a tendency to avoid complex characterizations of God in their work. The Character of God: Recovering the Lost Literary Power of American Protes- tantism is a work of significant historical breadth, successfully coalescing a range of theological perspectives through a single concern: the limited manner in which the character of God has been viewed and depicted over two centuries of Ameri- can theology. In creating a distinction between cosmopolitan theology and popu- lar theology, however, and concentrating almost exclusively on the former, the author has not made it possible for the reader to judge if this tendency has be- come a problem for all who set their minds to conceptualizing God. This seems doubtful, but Jenkins' opinion on popular theology would have been of interest. While this is an excellent treatment of a particular issue in the development of American letters and theology, it is constructed on a single premise - that for God's character to be complex and interesting it has to embody aspects such as wrath, strong feelings, and conflicting desires. Such a view is obviously depen- dent on an acceptance of the validity of anthropomorphism as a means of de- scribing the nature of God. While it is a common approach in fiction, drama, and verse, the extent to which it is accepted in theological speculation must surely depend on a prior recognition by modern theologians of the value of recognizing God's unique and compelling character as revealed throughout Scripture. When that occurs there is undoubtedly much scope to recover complexity in theological characterizations of God. Peter Stiles Sydney , Australia</page></plain_text>
