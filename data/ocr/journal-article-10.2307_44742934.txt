Wiechel Systems Engineering Associates Worthington, OH Steve Bell Transportation Research Ctr. of Ohio East Liberty, OH Howard Pritz National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Dennis Guenther Ohio State University Columbus, OH Introduction Evaluation of the injury potential of auto- motive impact configurations, vehicle components, or the vehicles themselves is necessarily empirical in nature. Such experimentation requires an anthropomorphic test device that simulates the loading on the vehicle or vehicle component. It is also necessary that a prediction be made of the injury resulting from that loading. In most cases, the extent of the injury is of prime Importance in determining the severity of the impact. Component and vehicle redesign can then be performed to mitigate the injury in subsequent tests or in the actual crash environment. It is generally accepted that the Hybrid III dummy is the most advanced test device in determining thoracic injury. That fact, combined with its other attractive features, makes it a candidate for a standardized test device. Hybrid III thoracic injury evaluation is accomplished by measurement of an average chest deflection which is in turn related to injury based on previous cadaver Impact studies. The current Hybrid III thorax can accommodate a maximum deflection of slightly over 76 mm (3 inches). Thus, the Hybrid III is designed to differentiate between the nonserious injuries (AIS 1-3) and to identify the presence of a serious injury (AIS &gt;3). This limited injury measurement capability of the Hybrid III has left a void in the ability to evaluate automotive crash environments. Certainly, it is of paramount importance to be able to differentiate between serious and nonserious injuries and qualitatively determine an improvement in the design of a vehicle or vehicle component. However, the inability to quantitatively measure serious Injuries is a handicap. Absent this ability, the assumption must be made by the test engineer that all injuries above AIS 3 are equally serious and life threatening. Any assumption short of this is guesswork. It would be advantageous to be able to differentiate between a life threatening AIS 5 injury and a serious but not critical AIS 4 injury. This is especially the case in establishing the survivability of severe crash environments as in unrestrained occupant or high speed collisions. The objective of the present research is to redesign the Hybrid III thorax to accommodate measurement of injury levels greater than AIS 3. A review of the cadaver data is performed to determine which measurable parameter (deflection, acceleration) can be used to best differentiate serious injuries. The Hybrid III thoracic structure is then redesigned to facilitate measurement of this parameter. In addition, two limiting characteristics of the current ribs, those being temperature sensitivity and endurance, will be considered and improved if possible. Background An initial brief review of the biomechanic injury criteria suggested that increasing thorax deflection would be a viable method of predicting high severity injury levels (greater than AIS 3) . The injury predicting method for the thorax relates injury to a normalized chest deflection using a straight line regression. It is based on 43 tests in which cadavers are impacted with a 6 inch diameter impactor of various masses and at different velocities. It was estimated that increasing the allowable rib deflection something less than one inch would be a suitable method of predicting high severity injuries. Upon examining the biomechanic data on which the injury predicting equation is based, it is clear that simply extending the regression line to include the high AIS levels and measure greater chest deflection is not biomechanically correct. This can be seen in Figure 1, a plot of AIS versus normalized chest deflection (P/D, where P is chest penetration and D is total chest depth).

The regression line has essentially the same slope as that now used to predict injury levels. This figure shows that the normalized deflection does not, in fact, increase beyond about 0.4 as the injury severity increases from just under AIS 4 to 6. A more precise curve would consist of a line up to 0.4 and then a vertical segment (shown dashed) . The limiting of the deflection to 0.40 of the total chest depth as the injury increases from AIS 3 to 6 is inherently consistent with the physical system. As the P/D increases past 0.3 to 0.35, the rib structure starts to collapse. As penetration continues, the internal organs become Increasingly compressed against the vertebral skeletal structure. As this bottoming on the spine occurs, injuries change from largely skeletal to internal organ (nonskeletal) injuries. The dynamic system and resulting injury for deflections below 0.35 to 0.4 is largely related to the strength of the rib structure. This is very different from the dynamic system and injuries when the rib cavity has collapsed and bottomed on the spine. For these high severity nonskeletal injuries above AIS 4 a deflection based injury prediction is not consistent with the physical human system. The Hybrid III thorax has been designed to bottom the ribs and sternum on the spinal structure at slightly over 3 inches of deflection. This corresponds to a sternal deflection of 3.5 inches and a P/D of 0.39 (D - 9 inches) • When this is substituted in the injury predicting equation, the AIS is 3. Noting that the linear portion of Figure 1 reaches almost to the AIS 4 level, it is perhaps justifiable to Increase the allowable deflection in the ribs up to 1/2-inch to predict AIS 4. The biomechanic data was then examined for other possible parameters for predicting the high injury severities (AIS 3 - 6). One possibility is spinal acceleration. It was found that 13 of the 43 cadavers tested with the 6 inch diameter impactor were instrumented with spinal accelerometers. Actual signals were published by Kroell, Schneider, and Nahum.(2,3) Figure 2 is a plot of AIS versus Spinal Acceleration.

The seven tests from AIS 3 to 6 that involve substantial rib structure collapse and instability exhibit a rather definite trend. The linear correlation coefficient is a rather significant 0.914. Perhaps a two step injury prediction is indicated. First, a deflection criteria predicts injury up to the level where the chest and rib structure collapses and bottoms on the spine (AIS 1-3). From that point, spinal acceleration can be used to predict the higher injury severity levels (AIS 4-6). Analysis of the Current Hybrid III Ribs The analysis of the current ribs consisted of determining the dynamic characteristics of the damping material, measuring the strains in the rib steel and damping material, and preparing a simplified computer model of a single rib. The strain analysis was performed in two steps. First, brittle lacquer was used to identify the regions of high strain. Second, an array of strain gauges were mounted on the ribs to obtain an estimate of the strain distri- bution in the ribs. The strain gauge array was laid out to Include measurement of the maximum strain as identified in the brittle lacquer test sequence. The damping material testing program included evaluation of the effect of material thickness and width on dynamic response, measurement of the sensitivity of the damping material to temperature, and determining the effect of material thickness and width on temperature sensitivity. The computer model was developed with the Intent of simulating the rib response and then altering the input parameters to analytically determine the benefit of revisions in the current design. All impact tests throughout this study were conducted using a linear impactor.

The face of the Impactor Is 6 Inches In diameter. Some tests In the program required that the skin be left off of the upper torso. For these cases» a section of sternal skin foam from a different dummy was attached to the Impactor face to duplicate the sternal padding effect of the full dummy. The dummy was seated on an adjustable but rigid platform. During the early tests» the neck of the dummy was not held rigidly and the torso was allowed to fall backward. In later tests» however» the top of the spine was restrained so that the thorax would not sustain any rigid body motion. This was done primarily to facilitate recording the kinematics of the ribs on high speed film. Experimental Stress Analysis The stress distribution in the current Hybrid III ribs was studied experimentally using both brittle lacquer and strain gauges. For the brittle lacquer tests» the lacquer was applied to a set of ribs and the ribs were then Impacted at successively higher speeds. The brittle lacquer was Inspected after each impact to determine the extent of additional cracks. Details of these tests are given by Wiechel (4) . The primary utility of a brittle lacquer analysis is the Identification of the regions of maximum and minimum strain. Comparison of the crack patterns on the six ribs revealed that the strain distribution is very similar on each one. The point of maximum strain on the steel was about one inch forward of the mid-point between the front and back of the rib. The point of maximum strain of the damping material was at approximately the same location. Strain Gauge Analysis Based on the results of the brittle lacquer analysis» a configuration of strain gauges was developed. Two gauges were placed at the points of maximum strain on each rib to accurately measure the strain and loading distribution along the different ribs. In addition» a total of 14 strain gauges were mounted on rib number 3 to define the strain distribution throughout a single rib (Figure 3) • Two gauges were also mounted on the spinal rib stiffener of rib 3 to determine its contribution to rib strength. Note that a total of four gauges were mounted on the inner surface of the damping material. In addition to the strain tests» a second set of tests were conducted to visually evaluate the dynamic kinematics of the ribs. To accomplish this» the head» neck» arms» and thoracic flesh jacket were removed and the upper spine was held in place. High speed movies were taken from above» the side» and the back of the dummy during impact. The resulting films gave a detailed description of the motion of the ribs as the impacts progressed. Due to the symmetry of the thorax and the impact, the strains observed at corresponding 4Í I I "-1 xi.

The variation in peak strain between ribs is shown in Figure 5. The figure shows that the peak strain is roughly uniform for ribs 2 through 5 but much larger for rib 1. This is due to the smaller size of rib 1 which must deflect nearly the same amount as the other ribs. The ability of the current ribs to sustain larger deflections as outlined in the objective is determined by the peak stresses encountered by the rib steel.

Since the intent of the design of the Hybrid III is to have a reusable testing device, yielding must be avoided. The relationship between peak strain and measured chest deflection is shown in Figure 6. This figure shows the peak strain of rib number 3 for various speed impacts. Based on the apparent linear relationship between peak strain and chest deflection and the geometry of the ribs it can be assumed that extrapolation of the relationship beyond the current deflection limits will also yield a linear function. That is, the peak strain increases proportionally with chest deflection. It is obvious from this data that the maximum strain in the rib is very close to yield at 3 inches of rib deflection. Moreover, recall that the peak strain of rib number 1 is typically one-third higher than the values shown here. It can, therefore, be concluded that the current rib design cannot be used for larger deflections. The current Hybrid III ribs are constructed of a strip of steel with damping material attached. Although the steel is a significant load bearing member, the influence of the damping material must also be considered. This was achieved by studying the dynamic characteristics of a single rib equipped with various configurations of damping material. Since the damping material is also responsible for temperature sensitivity and durability of the ribs, their dependence on the damping material characteristics were also studied.

Determination of Damping Material Properties The parameter that best described the contribution of the damping material to the dynamic response of the ribs is the time constant, X . This is essentially a measure of the speed of response of the damping material. In addition, the damping material supplies some stiffness to the thorax. This is accounted for in the spring rate, k. One of the major improvements of the Hybrid III over the Part 572 dummy was the increase in the amount of energy absorption (nominally referred to as hysteresis) . Damping is a velocity sensitive force which resists change. Due to the large difference in the Young's Modulii of the steel and the damping material, the present neutral axis is located in the steel. Therefore, as the rib is compressed, its damping material is completely in compression. The further from the neutral axis, the greater is the motion and velocity due to the relations of angular and linear displacement and velocity. The obvious solution to allowing the ribs to deflect more is to decrease the thickness of the steel and increase the thickness of the damping material. This would also contribute to the much sought after energy loss characteristics. The problem with increasing the thickness of the damping material is that it would aggravate the cracking previously observed. With the constraints of the temperature sensitivity and cracking, it was decided to match the dummy force-deflection curves with Kroell's adjusted performance corridors (2) and 6.273</page><page sequence="5">relax the hysteresis» without falling below the hysteresis of the Part 572. Accordingly, the parameter that needed to be quantified was the time constant and Its temperature sensitivity with varying damping material geometries. A series of tests were performed to evaluate the damping material time constant . The results of these experiments are listed In Table 1 and are plotted In Figures 7 and 8. Figure 7 shows the relationship between the time constant and temperature for different TABLE 1 Change in the Time Constant in the 65°F to 80°F Range for Varying Widths Damping Material Width @ 80°F 065êF Change in inch (mm) m/s m/s % 0.375 (9.53) 60.5 174.2 65.3 0.500 (12.70) 73.9 202.5 63,5 0.625 (15.88) 82.3 206.4 60,1 *0.750 (19.05) 104.8 284.2 63.1 *0riginal Width Temperature (°C) 15 20 25 400 , , 1 300- 0.5 in o 12.7 mrn' i ' ' E ' 1 200- ' g 0.4in 0 ' 2 IO.I6mm^k 0 0.3 In - X. 100- 7.62 mmCk. - ' ^ 0.2 in n 5.08mm - - p ol I I I 60 70 80 Temperature (°F) FIGURE 7; Variation of the time constant as a function of temperature for different damping material thicknesses.

The temperature dependence of the time constant is shown to grow until the thickness reaches 0.4 inches (10.16 millimeters). When the thickness reaches 0.5 inch (12.7 millimeters), the curve is approximately parallel to the 0.4 inch (10.16 millimeters) curve. Figure 8 shows a less clear relation between width and the temperature dependence of the time constant. The absence of a clear relationship may be attributed to a lack of uniformity in the production tolerance of the material thickness. It is seen that the temperature sensitivity of the rib could be reduced by making it wider and thinner. A wider, thinner rib would also reduce the stress at the outer surface of the damping material. Development of an Analytical Rib Model Given the analysis of the stresses in the ribs and the damping material characteristics just presented, it remains to propose changes in the current rib design and evaluate these changes with respect to increased deflection, temperature sensitivity, and durability. A stress analysis of the bending stresses in the ribs indicated that the neutral axis was in the steel rather than in the damping material as one 6.274</page><page sequence="6">851732 might expect. Further, it is not readily obvious how changing the steel or damping material configuration effects the overall stiffness given the loading requirements. Á computer model of a simplified rib arrangement was thus developed to evaluate design changes. A system of cantilever beams was used to model the Hybrid III ribs. The basic configuration of the rib model can be seen in Figure 9. Only half of each rib was modeled due Lood Element I ^ .-Element 2 J i Element 3 Ele™ł ¡ P FIGURE 9: Graphic representation of the computer simulation rib model. to the symmetry of the rib. The rib model is composed of five elements, each representing a different section of the rib. The computer model was developed for a zero order system. As such, the model predicts only the final deflection given an input force. It is not possible for the present model to predict events between the time the force is applied and the time the sternum reached its maximum deflection. Thus, the amount of hysteresis present cannot be predicted from the model. Figure 10 shows the results of the computer model validation. The stress versus deflection curve shows that the initial predictions were low. By adding an impact factor of 2.05 the second curve predicting stress was generated. As seen, the curves are almost identical, with the predicted values being lower by 35MPa (5 KSI) . On first examination, the impact factor appeared high. However, it should be noted that the Impact factor for a suddenly applied load is 2 and is increased as the impact becomes more severe (5) . Analytical Rib Synthesis The restriction that limits the ability of the ribs to deflect more than 3 inches is the stress in the steel. Measured strains at this deflection in the current ribs are near or in excess of the yield point. The obvious solution is to move the neutral axis toward the center of the steel. This could be accomplished by reducing the damping material thickness while maintaining the stiffness by increasing the thickness of the steel. However, the stress levels in the steel increased as the steel Deflection (mm) 0 25 50 75 100 125 150 175 2°° i 1 , 1 Tļ - i 1 n ļļ - 1200 150 - Il / H / - 900 S * /I / 1 5 * If P 5 t/&gt; 100 H / % £ H/ £ (/) dļ / - 600 &lt;/) 50 - fļ / • Experimental Result Il / O Computer Model - Jļ X A Computer Model with Tļ D Impact Factor 0^- I 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 I 2 3 4 5 6 7 Deflection (in) FIGURE 10: Comparison of computer simulation stress-deflection response with experimental data. thickness increases and damping material is removed. Since the original design uses the steel to the upper limits of its strength, 194 ksi to 201 ksi (1338 Mpa - 1386 MPa) , a design which increases the amount of stress is not acceptable. A number of alternative rib designs were studied using the computer rib model as an analysis tool. These designs include sandwiching the damping material between two strips of steel and simply removing damping material. It was found that all obvious variations from the existing design resulted in decreased stiffness or increased stress in the steel. However, these negative aspects can be offset by increasing the width of each rib. Existing clearance between the ribs is insufficient to permit adequate widening. The alternative is to use a double rib design which effectively gives a wider rib. Putting two ribs in parallel makes the rib twice as stiff while also decreasing the distance to the neutral axis. A series of simulations were performed to evaluate widening the ribs. Table 2 shows the improvement in the stress level for each rib configuration over the current design. The results of the computer simulation study indicate that the best configuration for damped ribs is to use six ribs, each consisting of an inner and outer member. Since each member resembles an Individual rib of the current design, it could be construed that the proposed 6.275</page><page sequence="7">TABLE 2 Rib 3: Improvement in Stress Levels Due to Widening the Rib Number of Rib Width Improvement in Improvement in Ribs inchęs (mm) Is 2 DM 1 1.0 (25.4) 3.01 4.62 2 .75 (19.1) 6.79 13.85 3 1.0 (25.4) 10.49 22.31 Rib Steel Thickness - 0.0800 inch (2.03 mm) design would contain a total of twelve ribs. In this s tudy , however, the proposed ribs will be referred to as being number 1 through 6 (top to bottom) with an inner and outer member for each. Each member is 19 mm (0.75 in) wide and is made of 2.03 mm (0.080 in) thick steel with damping material measuring 6.4 mm (0.25 in) thick attached to the inside of each member. The dimensions of the steel for the outer members are identical to the steel dimensions of the corresponding ribs of current design. The inner members are just enough smaller than the outer members to allow for clearance between the two during compression. It was found that this could be accomplished by making the front- to-back dimension of the inner member 4.06 mm (0.160 in) smaller than the outer member and the side-to-side dimension 25 mm (1.0 in) smaller. The damping material on the radii of the outer members is then machined to allow 2.5 mm (0.10 in) clearance. Dynamic contact tests proved this to be sufficient clearance.

Experimental Evaluation A set of two ribs were fabricated to the specifications outlined in the previous section. The ribs fabricated were numbers 3 and 4 and were used to evaluate the proposed design. It was decided to perform the evaluation with only two ribs since the cost to make them was initially less than the cost of an entire set and because a double rib set was more ammenable to visual observation. Comparison of the proposed two rib configurations would then be made with the performance of a two rib set of the current design tested under identical impact conditions. Naturally, the two rib arrangement necessitated deviation from the practice of using a complete dummy for the test matrix. Thus, the head, neck, arms, and chest flesh were removed. Sternal padding was attached to the impactor to simulate the contribution of the chest flesh. The primary difficulty in performing impact tests on a two-ribbed Hybrid III is in scaling down the test conditions. For example, the severity of pendulum impacts are typically rated in terms of the impact speed of a 23.4 Kg (51.5 lb) impactor. Scaling was performed by taking one-third of the Impactor energy for a given speed. This was accomplished by adjusting the velocity of the impactor and leaving the Impactor mass constant. The evaluation of the proposed design was performed to encompass the three criteria mentioned previously, those being overall response, temperature sensitivity, and endurance. Due to the evolution of the proposed design during the testing program and constraints of the project, the final proposed design was not evaluated in all three criteria. However, the test matrix produced enough information to estimate the performance of the design. The following paragraphs describe the results of testing in these three areas. The rib design proposed as a result of the computer analysis was tested to determine its dynamic response characteristics. This testing was performed using a two rib subset of the entire ribcage and included ribs 3 and 4. Duplicate tests were performed using ribs 3 and 4 of the current design. The evaluation of the proposed ribs consisted of comparing response characteristics of these two data sets. The first characteristic used for comparison is the force-deflection relationship for the ribs when subjected to a dynamic load. Figure 12 shows the force-deflection response of ribs 3 and 4 of the proposed design compared with the response of the current ribs. Although there is no gross discrepancy between the two response curves, it is clear that the overall shape of the curve does not agree with the current design. Moreover, the peak force achieved is too high and the peak deflection is low. In short, the first proposed design was too stiff. In addition to overall force-deflection, the hysteresis or energy loss exhibited by the force-deflection curve was also compared. The energy loss for the proposed rib test shown in Figure 12 was 63 percent and for the corre- sponding current rib test 78 percent. The 6.276</page><page sequence="8">851732 Deflection (in) 0.5 IO 1. 5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4000 1 i 1 1 1 1 r o First Proposed Design ¿ Second Proposed Design - 750 Original 3000 - o 2000- y J J -450 a&gt; °0 I 2345678 9° Deflection (cm) FIGURE 12: Comparison of the force-deflection response of ribs 3 and 4 of the current ribs with the first proposed design for an impact speed of 3.7 m/s (12.1 ft/sec). energy loss is significantly less for the proposed ribs than for the current ribs as is to be expected. Also, the energy loss of the new ribs falls short of the calibration speci- fications for the Hybrid III which requires energy loss to range between 75 and 85 percent. The lower energy loss is to be expected since the damping material is less structurally active in the new design. However, the 63 percent energy loss falls within the acceptable range of 50 to 70 percent for the Part 572 dummy. Recognizing the fact that the Hybrid III response is more biof ideile than the Part 572, it is believed that the loading portion of the force-deflection response is most critical. The guidelines followed in this study are therefore to match the thoracic loading response and maintain high energy loss if possible. The 50 percent cutoff given as the minimum acceptable energy loss of the Part 572 was taken as the lower design limit for energy loss. Since the proposed design was too stiff and the energy loss was well above the 50 percent limit, it was decided to propose a second design that would give a softer response. In actuality this decision was made after extensive testing on the first design but is Included here to facilitate discussion of the results in an efficient manner. It was observed that the point of failure of the first design after approximately 40 impacts was the cracking and separation of the damping material from the steel on the inner members of both ribs. This implies that the damping material was still overstressed. The obvious means of reducing the stiffness is then to use a thinner layer of damping material on the inner members. The second proposed design is thus identical to the first design except that the damping material thickness on the inner members is 3.18 mm (0.125 in) . The force-deflection response of the second design is also shown in Figure 12. The loading portion of the curve follows the response of the current ribs rather well. In addition, the peak force and peak deflection are relatively close to those of the current ribs. The unloading side of the curve, however, sustains a higher force level than the current design. As such, the energy loss is lower for the second design. Specifically, the energy loss for this test is 50 percent which is just within the acceptable range. As expected, the energy loss is less than that of the first proposed design. Overall, the response of the second design agrees rather well with the response of the current design. The primary impetus to redesigning the Hybrid III ribs is to allow measurement of larger deflections. Specifically, it is necessary to measure rib deflections up to 3.5 inches to account for injury levels above AIS 3. To determine the ability of these ribs to accommodate this additional deflection, a Hybrid III was fitted with a special spine which was cutout in front to permit a larger stroke and ribs 3 and 4 from the first proposed design were attached. Two tests were conducted 4.51 and 4.63 m/s (14.8 and 15.2 ft/sec). These Impact speeds provide one- third the energy of 7.8 and 8.0 m/s (25.6 and 25.3 ft/sec) Impacts, respectively. The force-deflection response of the latter test is shown in Figure 13. This figure shows that the deflection reached 8.92 cm (3.51 in) as desired. Inspection of the ribs after the test revealed no adverse effects on the ribs. There was no permanent deformation of the steel and no new incidence of cracking in the damping material. The absence of deformation in the steel is significant since there was a major crack in the damping material at the site of maximum stress of the third rib inner member such that the damping material was not structurally active at that point. This permitted a larger bending moment in the steel at that point which could have caused the steel to enter the plastic range. This did not happen since the overall stress in the steel of the redesigned ribs is lower than the current ribs. Thus, the new design can sustain larger deflections than the current ribs without harm. Referring again to Figure 13, the force deflection response at high deflection is similar to the situation where the sternum bottoms on the spine. Measurement of the preimpact distance between the spine and sternum gives 9.53 cm (3.75 in) not counting the roughly 0.953 cm (0.375 in) stroke available in the rubber stops between the sternum and spine. This distance is greater than the observed 8.92 cm (3.51 in) of deflection. This anomally is most likely due to the flexible bib which connects the lower neck mount with the top of the sternum. The wrap distance from the lower neck mount around the front of the clavicle mounting brackets and back to the fully deflected sternum is 14 cm (5.5 in) assuming the bib can conform to 90° corners.

Ás a result» the bib in its present form acts as a spring near the end of the rib stroke. Eliminating the bib would certainly reduce the peak force achieved and possibly increase the total deflection slightly. However» the contribution of the bib to other aspects of dummy response such as distribution of shoulder belt load is not defined at this time. Clearly» the purpose of the bib and its design must be reevaluated before larger chest deflections can be achieved. The ability of both proposed designs to satisfy the calibration specifications is shown in Figure 14. This figure shows that none of the rib pairs tested including the current ribs and both the proposed designs satisfy the calibration specifications as written. However» all times at which calibration Information is taken comes early in all the two rib impact responses. Clearly» this is a phenomenon peculiar to the scaling of the Impact energy to the two rib case. Given that the scaling of the two rib test results to the full thorax case is precarious» the evaluation of the proposed designs must be based on tests of the current design using only two ribs. The results show that the second proposed design replicates the current rib response well except for the unloading portion of the response and the energy loss • Based on this information» the second proposed design should be used to fabricate a full set of ribs and used in a subsequent testing program. In the event that the response of the full set is unsatisfactory» then modifications to the damping material thickness should be able to adequately refine the design. Clearly, further testing on a full set of ribs is required to evaluate the proposed design.

Temperature Sensitivity The second objective in redesigning the Hybrid III ribs is to improve their temperature sensitivity. Saul (6) reported that the Hybrid III ribs are more sensitive to temperature variations than the Part 572 or APROD dummies. The Hybrid III ribs were found to vary 42 percent in the temperature range of 18° to 27°C (65° to 80°F). Due to the varied environments encountered in automotive testing, this degree of temperature sensitivity is difficult to accept. A series of tests were conducted to quantify the temperature sensitivity of the two proposed rib designs and to compare this sensitivity with that of the current rib design. Each set of two ribs were mounted in the Hybrid III dummy absent the head, neck, arms, and chest skin. The entire dummy was soaked at the desired temperature for at least 12 hours prior to testing. Two Impact tests were performed at each of three temperatures, those being 18, 22, and 27°C (65, 72, and 80°F) at a nominal impactor speed of 2.47 m/s (8.1 ft/sec). The results of these tests are given in Figures 15, 16, and 17 which show the force-deflection responses for a typical test at each temperature for the three rib designs. In each case, the overall stiffness decreases as the temperature increases. These results are summarized in Table 3 which gives the average peak deflection achieved for each rib at each temperature.

The original ribs show a total variation of 36 percent as compared with 42 percent for the full thorax. This difference is either due to the problem in scaling between the full thorax and the two ribcage or caused by manufacturing dissimilarities between the ribs used in this study and those used by Saul. The total variation for the first proposed design is 27 percent and for the second proposed design is 15 percent. Clearly, the less the damping material is used as a structural member, the less sensitive the ribs are to temperature variation. Rough calculations Indicate that the temperature sensitivity is related to the magnitude of the stress in the damping material.

Unfortunately, this approach negates the material's damping effect. The results, however, do show a marked improvement in the temperature sensitivity of the ribs. The sensitivity of the response of the Hybrid III thorax to temperature is often thought of as being the variation of peak deflection with temperature. However, appropriate loading of the thorax Implies that force is also an important consideration. Figure 18 shows the peak force plotted against the peak deflection for the 2.47 m/s (8.1 ft/sec) tests of all 3 rib designs. Generally, the peak force is inversely proportional to the peak deflection. The relationship for the original ribs, however, does not appear to be exactly linear. The variation of the peak force for the original and first proposed design is roughly the same. The peak force of the second proposed design shows considerably less variation. Moreover, the range of the first proposed design data is offset from the original rib data. The second proposed design comes closer to the original design. In all, this figure shows that the second proposed design not only does well in matching the desired peak force and peak deflection of the original design 6.279</page><page sequence="11">Deflection (in) -Arm0 2400 1 2 3 2400 I 7 1 - 500 2000- ' Increasing _ 400 1600- &lt;§ ' Temperature o ' °«^a ' § ^ 1 a&gt; 1200 - - 300 O DO O D O u. ö ii: O - 200 800 - 4QQ _ ° Original - 100 o First Proposed Design a Second Proposed Design Ol 1 1 I I 0 2 4 6 8 10 Deflection (cm) FIGURE 18: Sensitivity of peak force and peak deflection to temperature for 2.5 m/s (8.1 ft/sec) impacts of the current ribs and the first and second proposed designs. but also reduces the temperature sensitivity for both the force and deflection. Endurance The third aspect of the rib response earmarked for improvement in the current work is the endurance of the ribs. It is well known to users of the Hybrid III dummy that the damping material on the ribs is subject to cracking after the test device has been subjected to a series of tests. Wiechel (4) has recently evaluated the test history of Hybrid III dummy Number #42 and has given an estimate of the number of tests required to initiate response degradation. Depending of course on the severity of the tests, it was found that thoracic response degrades after 15 to 20 impacts. This assumes normal testing and calibration procedures are followed. Response degradation was taken here to be a marked deviation in the calibration force-deflection response. More typically, rib quality is visually monitored by inspecting the interior surfaces of the damping material for cracks or separation of the damping material from the steel. The endurance testing conducted in this study was performed only on the ribs of the first proposed design. It consisted of a series of 3.6 m/s (12.1 ft/sec) pendulum Impacts to the two rib pair until the damping material failed. The same pair of ribs was also used for the evaluation of their overall performance and temperature sensitivity. The tests for these later two categories were performed prior to the endurance tests and consequently they contribute to the total use history of the ribs. Á total of 16 tests were performed on the ribs prior to the endurance study. Then, 24 more tests were conducted with the sole objective of determining the endurance limit. The breakdown of the total number of tests and associated impact speeds prior to failure is given in Table 4. Failure was defined here as the visual observation of any cracks on the damping material. Two cracks appeared in the damping material of the inside member of rib number 3 during test number 41. Both cracks were about 0.64 cm (0.25 in) long and 0.16 cm (0.0625 in) deep. Twelve additional 3.7m/s (12 ft/sec) tests were performed after these cracks were first observed at which point one crack had propagated through to the steel and the damping material had delaminated from the steel within about 2 cm (0.8 in) of the crack. TABLE 4 Nominal Strain Stress Number of Cycles 8000 6400 9 17500 14000 10 27000 21600 12 40000 32000 9 48000 38400 2 The results of the endurance testing indicates that the proposed rib design can sustain a larger number of stress cycles prior to failure than the current design. Table 4 shows that a total of 40 tests were performed on the two rib pairs of the first proposed design prior to the incidence of any cracks. Moreover, these tests were reasonably severe with the exception of the 3 lower speed tests. These 40 tests are roughly double the 15 to 20 full dummy test limit using current ribs as reported by Wiechel before degradation of the thoracic response occurred (4) • Acknowledging that there are dissimilarities between the two test procedures which may affect this comparison, any deviation from this rate of improvement is not expected. Conclusions The thrust of this research was to redesign the Hybrid III thorax to allow measurement of thoracic injury above the AIS 3 level. An analysis of blomechanical data indicated that this could be accomplished by extending the current limit of total chest deflection for the dummy to 10.2 cm (4.0 inches) from the current 8.9 cm (3.5 inches). This would allow measurement of AIS 4 injury. However, permitting further compression would deviate from the blomechanical situation where the 6.280</page><page sequence="12">851732 sternum bottoms on the spine. The data Indicates that an acceleration criteria may be more appropriate than a deflection criteria for injury levels of AIS 4 to 6. The analyses of the current Hybrid III rib design reveals very little room for improvement. The steel is used optimally and the damping material is structurally active to the point where it affects the temperature sensitivity and endurance of the ribs. Computer simulation of proposed design changes dictate that additional deflection can be obtained by widening and thinning the ribs. Due to space limitations» this must be accomplished using inner and outer rib sets. The responses of two proposed rib designs were evaluated experimentally and shown to compare favorably with the current rib design response. Due to the decreased activity of the damping material» the hysteresis is lower for the new designs. However» this disimilarity presents itself primarily during the unloading phase. Both the first and second proposed designs result in lower temperature sensitivity. The second design» however, reduces temperature sensitivity more and matches the peak force and peak deflection of the original ribs better than the first proposed design. Testing also indicates that the endurance of the first proposed design is approximately twice that of the current design. It is inferred that since the critical damping material (that on the inside rib member) is thinner for the second proposed design, that the endurance life for that design will be even greater.
