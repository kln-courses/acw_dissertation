<plain_text><page sequence="1">289 SURVIVALS OF THE USE OF OCULI IN MODERN BOATS. BY JAMES HORNELL, F.L.S., F.R.A.I., late Director of Fisheries, Madras. [WITH PLATES XIX-XX.] PART I. IN a former paper (Memnoirs of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, vol. vii, No. 3) I drew attention to the survival of the employment of oculi upon certain of the older types of boats in Eastern Seas, particularly in India and China. Since then I have extended my first-hand acquaintancs with the subject considerably, not only in India, but also by visits to many of the ports of the Mediterranean-in Italy, Sicily and Malta more especially-where old customs persist strongly among the fisherfolk. During the past three years I have utilized every opportunity to obtain as wide information as possible, for this is an enquiry that is urgent; old customs are dying out fast, particularly in the East, to give way to a cosmopolitan dead level of commonplace uniformity. It seemed to be a subject that should vield valuable results from the ethnological standpoint, and in this I have not been disappointed. I shall deal first with the instances met with in India and the far East. In the former region, apart from the river-systems of the north, there are great racial dilferences and divergencies of custom between the west and the east coast. On the West Coast, which has been more directly subject than the East Coast to outside influence-Arabian formerly and Jatterly European, old customs have been largely revolutionized by this outside contact, facilitated by the wealth of natural harbours on the Bombay coast and by the calm weather season that prevails during the north-east monsoon. Hence, though I suspect there are vestiges of oculi to be traced in the ornamental devices seen on some of the Hindu-owned boats of the Bombay coast, these are so obscure that further investigation is needful before any definite statements can be made. With regard to the East Coast, more conservative and more isolated, and therefore richer in the relics of ancient customs and relationships, unfortunately there is little on record concerning the habits and practices of the shore people. This arises largely because of the physical difficulties that restrict communications along that coast; the railways seldom approach the sea save to serve some important seaport, coast roads are usually non-existent, while travel by sea is out of the question as no landing can be made on this surf-beaten coast except by catamaran. Fortunately, a connected series of waterways extends roughly parallel with the</page><page sequence="2">290 JAMES HORNELL.-SUTrvivals of the Use of Oculi in Modern Boats. coast for several hundred miles along the seaward boundary of the AMadras Presiclency on the east, while others traverse thp, deltas of the Kistna and Godaveri; these give access to innumerable villages so remote and cut off from the influence of mnodern movement that customs remain in the main unchanged from what they were hundreds of years ago. It is in such communities that the use of boat oculi survives in considerable vigour. The custom is a widely spread one. It extends along the whole coast from Palk Bay to Bengal and penetrates inland several hundreds of miles along the course of the Ganges. It is not found in the Gulf of Mannar, a locality where outside influence has been almost as great as on the WTest Coast, and where few Hindu fishermen are to be found. From Point Calimere to Bengal, only two forms of sea-fishing craft are to be found, the catamaran and the masuila boat. Both are of very ancient origin; though primitive in appearance, in reality they are highly specialized and thoroughly suitable for operations on a surf-bound coast devoid of good harbours. The catamaran, composed of a varying number of logs according to the duty to be performed, is never painted or otherwise ornamented. Its logs, constantly wvashed by the waves when on the sea, offer no opportunity for decoration. It is otherwise with the masuila boat. This craft is built up of planks sewn together with coconut yarn (sinnet). It is short, broad and deep, in order to be extremely buoyant; the smaller ones are used for the shooting of shore-seines, the larger for carrying cargo to and from ships in the roadsteads. They are dangerous craft even with the most skilful management; this probably accounts in the main for the many ceremonies that attend their building and launching and also for the presence of oculi on many of them. These oculi are placed on the bows, crudely represented upon a painted ground, usually red in colour; each consists of two curved horizontal lines enclosing a black spot representing the pupil. Sometimes they are slightly incised, or rather scratched in, in others rudely daubed. No care is taken to make them realistic. In some few instances a second pair of oculi is placed on the quarters, close to the stern, possibly because these boats are double ended, sharp both at stem and stern. One of the outrigger Javanese ships among those sculptured at Boro Budur appears similarly to have oculi, round as in Chinese ships, at each end.' In a few masfila boats a curious decoration, suggestive of the rude representation of a deeply curved moustache, is added below the oculus, sometimes in front of it and sometimes slightly behind; the up-curling tip is directed away from the boat's stem (text-fig. I and P1. XIX, figs. 3, 4). None of the fishermen could explain its significance, finding refuge in saying that it is just a decoration occasionally added according to the owner's fancy. Curiously enough, oculi and this 1 Hornell, J., " Origins and Ethnological Significance of Indian Boat Designs," Mem. Asiatic Soc. of Bengal vol. viii, No. 3. Fig. 29. Calcutta, 1920; and cf.

Thrown back upon themselves by this exclusion from com- munion with the educated and progressive section of the population, these people have no interests outside the limits of their own community and their own calling; as a consequence they are intensely conservative, and to this we owe the survival of many ancient customs. FIG. 1.-FORE END OF A MADRAS MASULA BOAT, SHOWING A PAINTED OCULUS AND ACCOMPANYING "MOUSTACHE 1 DEVICE. The waterways of the Kistna and Godaveri deltas afford another series of boats frequently decorated with oculi. This region, because of the poverty of its road and railway communications, has no free access to the culture of the large centres of population, and this is intensified by the conservative habits of the boat people, who pass most of their life in their boats. Superstition is rife among the people of this region; the most obvious of all, devices to avert the evil eye, are conspicuous at every turn-a narrow leather band around the body or the neck of bullocks or, daubed on houses and boats, the rude representation of a man, degenerating sometimes into a form that may easily be mistaken for a crudely formed conventional cross, which symbol I suggest may possibly have actually had this origin.' I There are variations seen sometimes which have a striking resemblance to a crudely made swastika.</page><page sequence="4">292 JAMES IIORNELL.-Survivals of the Use of Oculi in Modern Boats. The centre of this area is the Colair Lake, a huge marshy area converted in the rainy season into an immense expanse of shallow water. The villagers, petty cultivators and fishermen, quiet and peaceable in an ordinary way, object to interference by the local authorities. On occasions when the latter have attempted to inipose regulations on the use of fishing stakes, primarily in the interests of irrigation, opposition offered has been so violent, that in view of the difficulty of imposing peace by force in such a difficult country, the counterpart of that fen land in England where the Saxons so long defied Norman power, it has been thought the wisest course to wink at this defiance of the law and to leave the people largely to their own devices. Such conditions are ideal for the survival of old customs, and, among others that have persisted, one of the most conspicuous is the use of the boat oculus. In this region three types of boats are found, (a) the burratidu, a dugout formed from the butt end of the palmyra palm (Borassus flabellTformis), (b) the ndva, a long, narrow, planked boat with bow and stern of the Burmese canoe pattern, and (c) the padlavu, a heavy canal-boat built for cargo carrying. The first named is never painted nor decorated, being too cheap and trivial to warrant such expenditure or trouble. Similarly the nava is never painted, nor is it ornamented with carving, but the majority exhibit some form of an oculus on the solid stem piece below the overhanging edge of the flared bow. Although invariably daubed on roughly in black, and quickly becoming weather-beaten and unrecognizable, a wide range in form is seen, varying from a fairly perfect lens-shaped outline enclosing a round pupil spot, through one in which the lower cuive of the lens is omitted, to the final degeneration of a 'rough circle without lens spot. More interesting, however, is the fact that the " moustache-mark," already seen occasionally in the case of the coastal masuila boat, is again shown, rather more emphasized and definite, and more closely identified with the oculus than in the others (see Fig. 7, Plate XIX). The padavus are far more numerous, larger and better built than the navas; the latter are the villagers' boats, whereas the padavus are regular cargo carriers between the towns and villages on the canals. They are built on a type fundamentally different from the nava, having a nearly vertical stem ending in a stem head carved in a helical form (Figs, 2-6). The carvel-buiilt hull is generally painted black, with a large rectanguilar patch of a different colour, usually red, oni each bow. Nearly always there is a narrow strip of deeply carved wood along each gunwale extending from the coiled stem head to the hinder edge of the coloured area on each bow. (Figs. 2-4.) The motive of the design is based on the lotus; a series of over- lapping scales simulates the petals, while a deeply incised rosette, representing a conventionalized lotus flower, is usually found midway in its length and another at the hinder end. At the fore end a small oval oculus is commonly incised. This oculus is, however, a subsidiary one, the main one, when present, being painted conspicuously in the centre of the coloured patch on each bow. An attempt is</page><page sequence="5">JAMES HORNELL.-Survivals of the Use of Oculi in Modern Boats. 293 FIG. 2. -FORE END OF A PADAVU ON THE KISTNA-GODAVERI CANAL.

The " moustache " motive is present in the majority of instances where an oculus is shown, sometimes distinct and clear, at others so greatly modified and blended with other markings as to be difficult to recognize until analysis be made of the complex. Figs. 3-6 exhibit some of the chief variations. Fig. 3 is the most typical; in Fig. 5 the " moustache " occupies a normal relationship to the reduced and vestigial oculus, whereas in Fig. 4 it is too far forward, and in Fig. 6 has, been partly merged into the coloured border frequently placed round the rectangular patch of colour on the bows. An ornamental device seemingly of the same character is seen further north, carved upon the bows of the abnormally rigged boats of Chilka Lake in Ganjam and Orissa.1 It consists of a delicately carved stem curving backwards, bearing a FIG. 6.-ANOTHER KISTNA-GODAVERI PADAVU SHOWING THE " MOUSTACHE" IN COMBINATION WITH THE NARROW MARGINAL BAND THAT OFTEN BOUNDS THE COLOURED BOW PATCH WITHIN WHICH IS THE OCULUS. drooping " head " that irmay possibly be intended to represent an unopened lotus flower-bud. It is placed immediately behind and in conjunction with a large and carefully carved conventional representation of the open lotus flower. Fig. 7 shows the relationship and details of these curious ornaments. The open lotus is certainly a modification of an oculus, and there can be as little doubt that the symbol behind is an artistic translation of the " moustache " motive of the boats of the KiAtna and Godaveri deltas; its form has been changed and refined to harmonize with the alteration effected in the form of the oculus itself. This lotus oculus in the example sketched had the centre and periphery coloured white with chunam (limewash); a row of white dots encircled the whole and was continued into a rudely painted base. Above each junction (two) of the broad 1 These boats carry a high and narrow battened mat-sail upon two bamboo masts stepped abreast of one another close to the fore end.</page><page sequence="7">JAMES IIORNELL.-Survivals of the Use of Oculi in Modern Boats. 295 planks forming the sides of the boat, an irregular series of little dark coloured pyramids was also outlined in white dots; rude though the work was, it suggested at once an attempt to represent waves in the manner employed in Greek decorative symbolism. Rude oval oculi are also seen occasionally, though rarely, on the bows of the flat-bottomed canal boats which hail from the villages on the margin of Pulicat Lake and ply on the Buckingham Canal. These oculi are generally outlined in white, both with and without a pupil spot. Besides the above the only boats I know of on the East Coast of India which carry oculi are the clumsy kcalla dhonis that used to ply between the port of ~~~~~~~~~~~ / ? 0 ? . O 0 00 o 0 ? ?

Thopputhurai, near Point Calimere, and the port of Kayts in the north of Ceylon. These boats, which carried thiree masts, and had a balance-board fitted amidships,' invariably had an incised oval oculus (text-fig. 8 and P1. XIX, fig. 11) on a small unpainted panel on each bow, associated with the name of the patron goddess to whom the boat was dedicated. No trace of a " moustache " was present in any which I have examined. These boats have disappeared during recent years and are now non-existent. In Ceylon, which may be conveniently mentioned here from its geographical proximity to the south-eastern coast region of India, the only vessels bearing oculi are certain boats owned by Tamilian Hindius living in the Jafina peninsula.

So old is this connection that the Tamil spoken there is more akin to that of the ancient Tamil classics than is the ordinary Indian Tamil vernacular. Hence it is easy to understand that some archaic Tamil customs still linger in northern Ceylon that have died out in the maotherland itself. To a certain extent this is true of the use of oculi in seagoing vessels. In Jafina it is not the exception for oculi to be affixed to boats as is the case on the mainland. Nearly all the small coasters hailing from Valvettithurai and the neighbouring ports in the Jafina peninsula display well-marked oculi. These vessels, generally called Jafina dhonis by Europeans, are known as padagu in the vernacular. They are strange-looking craft, rigged FIG. 8.-INCISED EYE AND DEDICATION TO THE LOCAL GODDESS UPON THE BOW OF A EALLADHONI BELONGING TO THE POINT CALIMERE NEIGHBOURHOOD. THREE SERIES OF YELLOW DEVICES PAINTED AROUND THE BOWS REPRESENT VOTIVE GARLANDS. as two-masted schooners, with a great development of jibs and foresails. The oculi are large and prominent, being carved out of wood and nailed upon the bows. The pupil and iris are painted black, the eyeball white. In the large oculi on the padagus, there is also an outer black margining outline representing the eyelids. Smaller eyes are also nailed upon the bows of the heavy s)hip's boats carried by these vessels.' It miay be noted that boats of similar construction and trade belonging to Muhammadan owners in the same locality do not usually bear oculi. Fig. 10, P1. XIX, shows the form of this type. 1 Notes upon the religious ritual performed on these Jaffna dhonis, both at launching and at departure on a voyage, are given in my " Origins and Ethnological Significance of Indian Boat Designs " quoted above.</page><page sequence="9">JAMES HORNELL.-Survivals of the Use of Octli in Modern Boats. 297 In Northern India a few classes of river craft still retain oculi. Those I have noted are the clinker-built cargo-carriers seen in the neighbourhood of Benares, the cargo palwars of Eastern Bengal and the passenger boats called gayna 9?ouka of the same region. The Benares boats, used from time immemorial for the transport of stone from the Chunar quarries and of firewood for the funeral pvres, by their close association with the most famous of Hindu holy cities, are naturally those that may be expected to retain archaic features, particularly those of religious symbolism. In these the hull is unpainted save for a large triangular panel of black on either bow. A conspicuous brass oculus in raised relief is nailed to the upper part of the black area; above the eye is a conventionalized eyebrow as shown in Fig. 9. Frequently a garland hangs from the stem head, evidence of puja performed; a set ritual of worship is followed periodically, particularly at amavasai, the time of full moon. FIG. 9.-BOW OF A GANGES CARGO BOAT, BENARES. AN OCULUS IN BRASS IS NAILED UPON THE UPPER PART OF A BLACK AREA PAINTED ON THE STEM AND BOW. A GARLAND OF FLOWERS HANGS FROM THE STEM HIEAD. The Eastern Bengal boats provided with oculi invariably belong to Hindu owners. The oculus here is fashioned of brass, a similarity with the Benares type that shows the local custom of the Ganges and Padma to be homogeneous. A further decoration both of the palwar and gayna nouka is one or two circlets of brass-headed nails around the prow a little behind the oculi. These circlets are intended to represent the garlanding of the prow, as is done periodically with strings of small yellow chrysanthemum flowers on the Benares boats. In the case of the palwar, at the beginning of the harvest season-about mid-November-it is customary for the owner and crew, before resuming their seasonal occupation of grain carrying, to perform a special puja, when the prow is painted with vermilion, a flower garland hung round it, and offerings and libations made with the x 2</page><page sequence="10">298 JAMES HORNELL.-Survivals of the Use of Oculi in Modern Boats. appropriate ritual. No " moustache " is depicted upon any of these three classes of Gangetic boats. Evidence of the more widely spread prevalence of the oculus custom in ancient days in India is afforded by the frescoes in the Ajanta caves (Hyderabad), which are dated about 600 A.D. Among these are depicted a three-masted ship and a royal barge, both provided with eyes on the bows.' With regard to the countries lying east of India, we find oculi greatly in evidence wherever Chinese influence is predominant. In the harbours of Burma the Chinese sampan has ousted the indigenous canoe as the harbour handy-boat, and invariably these sampans show a round protuberant oculus on each boW.2 The Malays, although they do not use the oculus now, appear to have done so occasionally at no far distant date, for in the Indian Museum at Calcutta is a small model of a Selangor boat, beamy and double-ended, with an outboard platform on each side (a modified double outrigger), which shows a slightly elliptical eye on each FIG. 10.-FORE END OF A SMALL CHINESE JUNK; A LARGE BOSS OCULUS IS AFFIXED TO THE HEADBOARDS. SHANGHAI. bow. The black eccentric pupil is at the fore end of the white ellipse of the eyeball, which is painted upon a green panel at the extreme end of.the topstrake of the boat on each side. In China the same round eye seen in the sampans in Burmese ports is universal (Fig. 10), and so fully conventionalized that no variations occur; in Annam also the employmelnt of the oculus is equally general, but the form is excessively lengthened, as shown in Fig. 11. So far as I know neither the Polynesians nor the Indonesians make use of the oculus. As already noted, this custom appears, however, to have been occasionally followed in Java about the seventh and eighth centuries, for one of the boats 1 Mukerji, R., Indian Shipping, p. 41. 2 See postscript.</page><page sequence="11">JAAIES HORNELL.-Survivals of the Use of Oculi in Modern Boats. 299 represented in the Boro Budur sculptures shows what seems to be an oculus at each end. The Japanese do not appear ever to have followed this custom in spite of it being universal in China, whence the Japanese borrowed so much of their culture. On the other hand, the coast Indians of British Columbia and the adjacent islands, who are (or rather were) noted for the lavish totemistic decoration of almost all their ornaments and gear, extended the same to their boats; large oblong eyes contained within slightly curved lines are common forms of this orna- nientation. (P1. XIX, fig. 14.) In the British Museum collections are four models of large dugout canoes from Queen Charlotte Island and neighbourhood which all show the presence of oculi. In one of these, where the canoe is painted black except at the fore end, an anthropomorphic eye with eyelid (P1. XIX, fig. 15) is outlined in black low down upon the unpainted bow region. All the others bear eyes of the typical elongated sub-rectangular totemistic form. In one instance there is a single one towards FIG. 1 .-ELONGATED OCULUS CHARACTERISTIC OF ANNAMITE BOATS. each end, with a good deal of red, green and black conventional line patterns. Another has a fairly realistic eye on each bow with an elongated totem eye at the extreme end of the stem region, with a round one behind it; at the stern two totemistic eyes are painted within a red network. The fourth canoe is fantastically decorated with totemistic mask faces as well as with eyes, the faces towards one end, a conventional eye at the other; totem eyes are also painted low down amidships. Another model, from Vancouver Island, B.C., in the Liverpool Museum, is decorated at each end with sub-rectangular eyes. From the foregoing notes it is clear that the custom of decorating the bows of boats with oculi is far more general and widely spread in the Indo-Pacific region than is generally realized. The custom is found at the present day in a chain, practically unbroken, along the coast of Asia from the south of India, along the shores of the Indo-Chinese peninsula and of China, and thence across the Pacific</page><page sequence="12">300 JAMES HORNELL.-SuTrvivals of the Use of Oculi int Modern Boats. to the coast dwellers in British Columbia. We know also from the frescoes of Ajanta that it extended in the early centuries of the Christian era up the west coast of India. Three distinct groups may be made out (a) The Indian, characterised by distinctly anthropomorphic form, and frequently supplemented by a " mouistache-like " accessory device; (b) The Mongolian, a conventionalized form without any accessory device, round and boss-shaped among the Chinese, elongated and flat among Malays and Annanites; (c) Mixed totemistic and anthropomorphic forms employed by the shore people of the Pacific coast of Canada. Regarding the last of these, I consider that the totemistic forms have originated within the tribes using them and have no ethnological importance apart from that attaching to the general totemistic customs of these people. But, as we have seen, the totemistic eye is sometimes replaced or reinforced by a more realistic form distinctly of anthropomorphic type. As these people are undoubtedly largely of Mongoloid origin, and as the Chinese, Annamites, and some Atalays employ oculi conventionalized into mnere symbols of the human eye, I am inclined to think that the second British Columbian form is more closely akin to the original type than those employed by the modern Chinese and Annamites, and that the latter are conventionalized forms of such a higber type of oculus as that preserved by the, British Columbian Indians. The latter eye is much more nearlv related to the types common in India, and hence it would seem that the Chinese and Annamite forms are degenerate, and that the time was when a truly anthropomorphic and realistic form of oculus was found continuously along the southern and easterm coasts of Asia from Western India to Northern China, and thence across the Pacific to what is now British Columbia. All these forms probably originated from those of India, and it now remains to trace the origin of the boat oculi of India, as the immediate parent form of those found further east. The key to this problem is to be found, I believe, in Egypt. Everyone acquainted with the antiquities of that country is familiar with the Uzat (or uchat) ornament, commonest of all ancient Egyptian amulets against the evil-eye. This represents the eye of the hawk-headed deity Horus, and is also associated with the sun-god Rd. ,As an oculus it is seen on the funeral boats that ferried the dead to the abode of Osiris (text-fig. 12) ; it is also seen on the bows of some of the toy or model boats placed with other objects of everyday utilitv in the mummy chamber that the dead might find at hand, when wanted, the same means of travel to which he was accustomed before death (P1. XIX, fig. 1). The hawk-eye of Horus (Fig. 13) has several peculiarities the eyebrow is heavily outlined, while above and below the eveball a band of kohl, still affected</page><page sequence="13">JAMES HORNELL.-SurViVals of the Use of Oculi in Modern Boats. 301 by Egyptian ladies to enhance their charms, is distinctly indicated, continued at the outer corner into a strongly marked backwardly directed band, ending bluntly. A third characteristic is the short vertical bar below the centre of the eye and the FIG. 12.-PROW OF AN ANCIENT EGYPTIAN FUNERAL BARGE, SHOWING A SLIGHTLY MODirIED UZAT EYE AS OCULUS (AFTER MASPERO).

Actual similarity is not to be expected; the lapse of 3,500 or 4,000 years is ample to account for the differences present, even if originally the Indian form was directly derived from the Egyptian. The fact that the Indian device varies greatly in its position and form is indeed strong proof of its high antiqLuity, for no Indian can explain its significance, merely following a custom in use by his fathers; if one employs a simple pattern in conjunction with another, without understanding of its meaning or origin, inintelligent changes in form and relative position are certain to arise, and this I feel sure is what has happened in the case of this feather pattern of the Eye of Horus, in use now by a people of a different religion ignorant of the meaning of the device they use. In other papers I have attempted to show that the catamarans of the East Coast of India are mnodelled upon the ancient Egyptian form of reed raft ;' with this weightier and more direct corroborativepiece of evidence, the inference is strengthened that there are close ethnological affinities between Egypt and the Coromandel coast of India,where customs are still extremely archaic and little affected either by European or Hindu culture. It is my belief that these affinities are due flndamentally to racial relationship, and that a strong strain of the same blood as that which produced the Egyptian type is present in these lowly fisherfolk of the East Coast of India. Both appear, therefore, to be ofishoots of that race at present termed the Mediterranean. If so, this strengthens my theory that this race or their direct progenitors peopled a tract extending from the Mediterranean eastwards through Egypt, Southern Arabia, and India, and thence through Indo-China into Indonesia and the Pacific, finally impinging on the western coasts of central and equatorial America. PART II.-THE MEDITERRANEAN REGION. The use of oculi in the decoration of boats from religious or superstitious motive has been customary in the Mediterranean region from the earliest days of boat building of which we have any knowledge. So far as we can judge at present, the custom appears to have originated in Egypt, where we find the eye of the Sun-God represented on the bows of the boat of the dead when the primitive ideas of vague spirits haunting trees and embodied in stones gave place to a belief in gods with human attributes. The model boats manned with full crews placed with the mummy to ensure his comfort in travelling in a futuire life, sometimes bear the same symbol; there. can be little doubt that boats and ships employed in commerce and for pleasure and sport2 were frequently provided similarly with a representation of this sacred eye. How far this oculus was intended to identify the vessel with the Sun- God 1 Hornell, J., " Catamarans and Reed Rafts," Man in India, vol. i, June, 1921, Ranchi. 2 Erman, A., in his Life in Ancient Egypt, gives a figure of a hunting boat showing this device.</page><page sequence="15">JAMES HORNELL.-Survivals of the Use of Ocquli in Modern Boats. 303 himself, that the boat consecrated to this deity might see with his eyes and so avoid danger, or was used as an amulet against the evil-eye is a moot point. In favour of the former explanation being true when the Egyptian religion flourished in pristine purity and strength is to be set the facts that the eyes of Horus are depicted on mummy coffins opposite the head in order that the dead may have the power of seeing out, and that the boat itself is even at the present day consecrated to a deity in the case of certain Indian boats (the kalla dhoni of Thopputhurai, and the large dhonis owned by Hindus in the Jaffna peninsula of Ceylon), thereby identifying it with the deity whose eyes on the bow perceive danger and avoid it. The Chinese also universally believe that eyes are necessary to boats and ships to find their way safely over the sea, and this must embody some vague idea of the vessel being sentient and associated with some protective spirit or god. The fisherfolk of Gozo (Malta) have a somewhat similar belief; the older generation look upon their boats as animate; to them the oculi are made for the boat or its spirit to see with, and so signify much more than an evil-eye amulet. The alternative theory that oculi were placed on boats as a protection against the evil-eye is probably correct of the later days of ancient Egypt, when the old religion was becoming corrupt and complex, and when the gods were far more remote and conventionalized to the common people than in earlier days. Such an age is paralleled to-day in India and northern Ceylon; when the boat owner has some culture, and understands the rudiments of his religion, he consecrates his boat to a protecting deity-it may be a village goddess belonging to that pre-Hindu religion of spirits and demons still prevalent among low-caste Indians, or it may be one of the Hindu triad-and identifies it withl the god; if he be limited in ideas and saturated with superstition, the signs he puts on his boat are merely amulets placed there in the hope of counter- acting the evil-eye or to propitiate some power of evil. The Phoeniciains also used oculi on their vessels; if we may judge Lrom the scanty evidence of their coins the Phcenician oculus was represented extremely large and conspicuous. In form it appears to have been cruder and less anthropo- morphic than the Greek type, but Phce.nician remains are so scanty and fragmentary that no reliable details are available, excepting that thie eye was without any markings to suggest it having been derived directly from the hawk-eye of Egypt. This, however, does not preclude Egyptian derivation, for anv nation adopting the custom from Egypt would be prone to adapt the form of the eye to the ocular convention characteristic of their, own particular deities; the custom might be borrowed, but usually not details that would link the symbol with a foreign religion. In the British Museum catalogue of the Greek coins of Phoenicia, the coins of Aradus (the modern Jezireh Ruad) often show a galley with an unmistakable oculus, while those of Sidon also show this characteristic. With regard to the ancient Greeks, remains dating from the fifth to sixth centuries B.C. are particularly rich in representations of vessels, both round ships</page><page sequence="16">304 JAMES HORNELL.-S&amp;rvivals of the Use of Oculi in Modern Boats. and war-galleys, on which oculi are conspicuous. Coins, terra-cotta vases, friezes and sarcophagi furnish ample evidence. Figs. 15-17 are typical examples. Fig. 14 is an exceptional form. It is copied from a coin of Leucas (Acarnaria). Apparently FIG. 14. PROW OF A GREEK GALLEY DEPICTED UPON A COIN OF LEUCAS (ACARNARIA). LARGE OCULI ARE BORNE APPARENTLY IN PANELS ALONG THE WASHSTRAKE.

The latter was the real oculus, that identified with the spirit of the boat; the former should not be classed as an oculus, being FIG. 16.-PROW OF A GREEK GALLEY FROM AN ATHENIAN VASE IN THE BRITISIH MUSEUM (NO.

Of about the same age (circa sixth century B.c.) is a wonderfully interesting collection in the British Museum of terra-cotta models of ships and boats of diverse shapes, excavated at Amathus in Cyprus. Several of these show FIG. 17.-PROW OF A GREEK GALLEY, SHOWING TWO OCULI, FROM A C'OIN OF DEMETRIUS POLIOKERTES, KING OF MACEDON, B.C. 306-283. BRITISH MUSEUM COLLECTION. large oculi on the bows (P1. XIX, fig. 16). These oculi are characteristically semi- lunar in shape, crossed vertically by a thick bar representing the iris and pupil, with a heavy eyebrow outlined above. These rude models are probably similar to the boats of that fleet of fifty, sent by Kinyras, King of Amathus, as his contribution to</page><page sequence="18">306 JAMES HORNELL.-SUrViVals of the Use of Oculi in Modern Boats. the Greek cause at the siege of Troy-an act for which he incurred the wrath of Agamemnon.1 Coming to Roman days, we find the same custom followed, but here only a single oculus on each bow was employed; none was ever placed upon the rostrum of war-galleys. At the present time the use of oculi, particularly in the case of fishing boats, is prevalent in Sicily, Malta and Portugal; in southern Italy strong traces of its recent prevalence exist, and traces, still weaker, are to be found in northern Italy and in France. Probably some of the out-of-the way ports on the Mediterranean coast of Spain would yield instances, whilst, in view of its prevalence in greatest vigour in the ports of eastern Sicily, once the most important colonies of ancient Greece, we may infer that it also survives in Greece and its islands. It does not appear to persist in Egypt or amongst the native coast population of north Africa, the reason being the same as that which has caused its disappearance from Muslim-owned shipping in India-the Propliet's injunction against the employment of anthropo- morphic designs. SICILY.-As Sicily is the present-day centre of the oculus survival, I shall first describe the forms it assumes in the different ports, all observed personally during a visit paid to this island in 1920. As is to be expected on the theory of derivation from a Greek source, the boats of Syracuse are more consistently decorated with an oculus than any others. The large boats of the fishing fleet that hail from this port nearly all bear it, as do the small harbour boats. Among the smaller Syracusan coasters, characterized as are also the larger fishing boats by a well-marked projection beneath the bow that is the direct descendant of the classic rostrum, the oculus is also occasionally to be seen. The form assumed is local to Syracuse. It is most curiously conventionalized; the opening of the eye is show-n elongated, but the pocket at the inner corner has been exaggerated, while from the opposite end rises a fringed line that curves over the eye in the fashion of a squirrel' stail (P1. XX, fig. 1). None of the fishing boats shows any serious deviation from the type; in one case I noted the omission of the squirrel-tail eyebrow from the oculi of a small coaster. The fishing boats are sometimes gaily decorated in the region of the bow and along the upper strakes, as seen in Fig 18. Inside, they show little ornamentation, in contrast with those of Catania next to be described; it is rioteworthy, however, that a half-sun with conventionalized human features is commonly painted on the short decking at the aft end (Fig. 20). The fisherfolk of the neighbouring city of Catania, in spite of the flush of modernity and commercial activity that pervades its external life, are deeply imbued with superstition, and the cult of the oculuLs prevails nearly, if not quite as 1 Eustathius, p. 827.</page><page sequence="19">JAMIES IIORNELL.-Survivals of the Use of Oculi in Modern Boats. 307 generally, as at Syracuse, where the links with Old Greece still subtlv dominate the life of the people. In its form the Catania oculus is quite different from that of Syracuse; it shows a rounded eye with two obliquely curved lines above, the lower FIG. 18.-FORE END OF A MODERN SYRACUSAN FISHING BOAT.

These are fundamentally the same as in pre-Christian days, but are modified in detail to conform with their</page><page sequence="20">308 JAMES HORNELL.-Survivals of the Use of Oculi in Modern Boats. present form of Christianity-Roman Catholicism. Thus it comes that on the Catanian fishing boats the greatest ornamentation of any in Sicily is lavished. Both inside and outside they are usually gaudily painted with figures of saints, cherubim, flower-garlands and arabesques. On the lower part of the high vertical stem head a figure of the heroine saint of Catania, Santa Agatha, is sometimes depicted, while oni the stern quarters of many the figures of the three other saints greatly revered in Catania-San Alfio, San Filadelfo and San Cirino-are often painted, someti.mes -With considerable artistic skill. Some add to these the patron saint of the owner, (0J) FIG. 21.-F}ORE END OF A FISHING BOAT OF CATANIA. FOR DESCRIPTION SEE TEXT. -painted on the stern post. But while the great majority of these boats bespeak, at least outwardlv, the devout adherence of owner and crew to the most extreme form of Roman Catholicism and who appeal for protection to all the saints held in greatest veneration locally, a small proportion retain, either alone or in combination with Christian symbols and figures, what I am convinced is an older and pre-Christian scheme of decoration. In these, in addition to an oculus on the bow the principal other ornamentation consists of anthropomorphic representations of the sun's disc. The absence in the majority of such boats of rich decoration and particularly of</page><page sequence="21">JAMES HIORNELL.-Survivals of the Use of Oculi in Modern Boats. 309 Christian emblems and images of saints, so common in the smaller boats, is most significant. This type is usually characteristic of the larger fishing boats without high stem post. On these a large, rayed, solar half-disc, representing the rising sun, with rudely formed eves, nose and mouth within the disc, is painted on both bows and also on the quarters (Fig. 22). This solar decoration is still more emphasized within the boat, where on the short fore-decking, usually painted blue, is a large red disc in the centre on which is the sun's anthropomorphic visage painted in black. Encircling the red disc is a wide yellow circle on which the rays are shown usually in a crenate pattern in black (Fig. 19). The blue ground obviously represents the blue of the Mediterranean sky, in which the risen sun is set, a fiery disc, emitting golden rays. It is significant to note that this solar ornamentation of the fore deck is common to all the fishing craft of Catania; those covered externally with figures of saints equally with those that cling to the representation of the sun on bows and quarters, and appear thus to contemn the protection of Christian saints. It would appear that the owners, like those Hindus- who attend festivals at celebrated FIGS. 22 AND 23.-SOLAR DECORATIONS ON THE BOWS AND QUARTERS OF CERTAIN CATANIAN FISHING BOATS. Christian and Muhammedan shrines in India, desire to safeguard themselves fully bv offering devotion to the old gods as well as to the new. In two extreme cases this dual devotion went so far that a rayed solar disc (Fig. 23) was painted on each bow and each quarter in company with a galaxy of local saints. In both instances the solar disc was low down just above the water line. This association of the sun with the oculus goes far to prove that the Greek oculus was derived from Egypt, for there the sacred eye, whether as in the form of the uzat amulet or as the oculus on a boat, was closely identified with the sun. The 140th chapter of the Book of the Dead refers specifically to the sun as the eye. The sacred eye is also associated closely with Ra, the Sun God, for wherever this god's Sacred Bark is depicted, as in the papyrus of Ani, it bears this symbol on the bow. The Egyptian boat oculus and the uzat eye are usually considered to represent the eye of hawk-headed Horus, but it might be more correct to assign it a more generalized significance and simply to consider it as the symbol of the sun-god. Frazer says1: " There appear to have been few gods in Egypt who were not at one time or another identified with him " (Ra). " Ammon of Thebes, Horus of the East, The Golden Boutgh, 2nd edition, vol. ii, p. 149.</page><page sequence="22">310 JAMES HORNELT.-Survivals pof the Use of Oculi in Modern Boats. Horus of Edfu, etc.... all were regarded as one god, the sun." Even Osiris was sometimes conceived of as Ra and named Osiris-Rd and an eye was one of his symbols. Hence if the Egyptian boat oculus be identified with the sun, the survival of the custom of painting an oculus and actual solar representations on the fishing boats of Catania and Syracuse assumes the utmost significance in any consideration of the origin of the ancient Greek oculus, from which the modern Sicilian oculus has undoubtedly been directly derived.' STARS.-In a few boats at Catania I saw a star substituted for the normal oculus; this variation, the exception at this port, becomes the accepted form at Messina, where, at the fishing village close to the Faro, many of the boats had a well-defined star on each bow (Fig. 24). This is a common amulet against the evil-eye in Sicily FIG. 24.-FORE END OF A MESSINA FISHING BOAT. A STAR HAS REPLACED THE OCULUS. THE HIGH VERTICAL STEM BEARS AT THE SUMMT A SMALL WOODEN GLOBE ON WHCH ARE INCISED SMALL STARS. and in Italv; I have seen a large dried starfish (Asterias) hung above the doorway of a fisherman's house in a Calabrian village opposite Messina, and small ones are used aA amulets among the Chioggia fishermen-an intensely superstitious folk. This substitution of a star for an oculus is very prevalent in Western Europe, and as we shall see is found quite commonly throughout Italy, France and Belgium. Its presence must be attributed to the loss of the feeling that boats are sentient (Gozo), 1 It is also possible that the Sicilian representations of the sun are connected with the Greek custom of consulting the Delphic oracle when any Greek city contemplated the founding of an oversea colony. Phcebus Apollo being the god who spoke through the mouth of the oracle, and the god under whose auspices the settlers sailed forth and founded the new city, it may well be that the fishermen and sailors of the colony held Apollo in special reverence and sought his protection by the pictorial displav of his emblem, the sun, upon their boats.</page><page sequence="23">JAMES HORNELL.--ASurvivals of thze Use of Oculi in Modern Boats. 311 or under the protection of saint, spirit or deity (Sicily, India, Ceylon). In its place this symbol at best is but an amulet against the evil-eye (Italy), and at its lowest as it usually is (France and Belgium and even England), is a decoration put there out of mere habit or thoughtless imitation (Fig. 35). Forms of the oculus, entirely different from those characteristic of the east coast of Sicily, occur in the ports on the west and northern coasts, centering in Trapani, built on the site of the Carthagenian and Roman port of Drepanum. This West Sicilian type of oculus is extremely degenerate, consisting of a large circle roughly daubed on each bow, with a central spot within. No care is taken to make the circle neatly nor to form it into an ornament. At Trapani it is nearly always confined to the small double-ended boats used for inshore work and for sponge-fishing at Sfax (Tunisia). These boats have the bottom and lower part of the sides painted black usually, and it is on the upper part of this black area at the bow that this crude oculus is daubed. It is noticeable that the colour used is generally red (P1. XIX, Fig. 29). FIG. 25.-FORE END OF A SMALL FISHING- BOAT OF PALERMO, SHOWING THE PECIULIAR FORM OF CONVENTIONALIZED OCJULUS-A LARGE RED CIRCIE AND CENTRAL DOT. EiG. 26.-FISHING BOAT OF TERMINI IMERESE WITH A SMALL DISC, THE VESTIGE OF AN OCULUS, LOW DOWN ON THE BOW. At Palermo the same kind of oculus is seen, and its location is the same, low down on the bow (Fig. 25). But there it is not confined to small fishing boats, though it is only among these that it is fairly common; occasionally but very rarely the large galley-like fishing boats used in deep-sea fishing follow the same custom; in one of the few cases I noted, both stem and stern were thus decorated, but the oculi on the bows had each two concentric circles, while those on the quarters had the normal single one. Several of the small boats' had also one at each end on each side (P1. XX, Fig. 2). A few of the small Palermo boats substitute a cross within the circle for the usual central spot. At Termini Imerese, 37 kilometres east of Palermo, the rude circular oculus has degenerated into a red disc, 41 to 5 inches in diameter, painted on the bow (Fig. 26). Few boats, however, are thuis decorated. Of two exainined the discs VOL. LTTT. y</page><page sequence="24">312 JAMES HORNELL.-SurViVals of the Use of Oculi in Modern Boats. were low down, at or even just below the water line, painted on the extension upwards of the dark coloured bottom. In one instance there was only one disc on each bow and none on the stern. The other had one disc on the starboard side, but two on the port; these latter were arranged one behind the other. In this same boat two discs also occurred on each quarter of the stern arranged roughly in similar manner to those on the port bow. I have also seen, but rarely, red disc oculi on small Palermo fishing boats. At Palermo, the properly formed oculus is also seen, but it is confined to the larger-sized fishing-boats used for drift netting and which have a high stern-post. 'These boats are often gaudily painted with longitudinal stripes of bright colour along the sides and with various decorative figures in one or more of these bands .............. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ f . FIG. 27.-LARGE FISHING BOAT OF PALERMO WITH WELL-FORMED OCULUS AND LAVISH ORNAMENTATION. (Fig. 27). The form of the oculus is a regular ellipse in black with a large black pupil in the centre. The lashes, are usually distinguishable in freshly painted boats. Immediately below the oculus is a wedge-shaped area painted red. On this is commonly painted a mythological sea-horse, the head and fore-legs horse, the other half drawn out into a long coiled fish tail. On the tall stern post is often painted the figure of the Madonna. Unlike the somewhat related Catanian boats, there are no painted figures on the deck or on the combings, but it is suggestive that the short deck fore and aft is nearly always painted red, whatever be the scheme of colour bands on the outside, which varies with the fancy of the owner or the builder and for which no definite convention prevails. Excepting the last described form of oculus, it would seem that the West Sicilian oculus has had a different origin from that of the East Coast. The latter,</page><page sequence="25">JAMES HORNELL.-Survivals of the Use of Oculi in Modern Boats. 313 so far as Syracuse and Catania are concerned, has carried on the Gfreek tradition far more strongly than other cities in the island; GCreek colonization and domination began earlier and lasted longer there than elsewhere in the island, and indeed for some hundreds of years the two coasts were under separate domination-the east under the Greeks, the west first under the Phoenicians, and then under the Carthagenians. So, too, dturing Saracenic rule, the invaders' power and influence were far more strongly felt in the west than in the east, Palermo being their capital. It is therefore probable that the western type of Sicilian oculus is derived from a Phoenician source, and that this accounts for the radical difference in form. Or, possibly, though far less probably, the change from the anthropomorphic type to one that is at best a geometrical convention of the object is due to the Muhammadan objection to the former, as infringing one of the Prophet's strictest injunctions. It may even be that both influences have combined to produce the existing type. We have reason to believe from the evidence of their coins that the Phoenician oculus was of an exaggerated size and of simple form, hence if a specially large oculus, necessarily somewhat rounded, be converted into a purely geometric form without any semblance to the conventionalized human eye, the result is likely to be just such a form as is found in Palermo and Trapani-a large circle with a central spot. Regarding the Palermo boats with well-formed conventional oculi related closely to those of the east coast, I am inclined to think that these are migrants from that locality. This type of boat closely resembles the one characteristic of that region and differs entirely from any to be found at Trapani, a port where changes are slow to take effect and not clamant for increased supplies of fish as is the metropolitan city of Palermo. That this particular type is not found in Trapani, is, I consider, very strong evidence that it is an intruder from another district. The wealth of outward adornment in contrast to the sombre and usuallv unornamented hulls of the Trapani and smaller Palermo boats, and the presence of Christian images and symbols, all connect these boats with those of Catania. MALTA AND Gozo.-In Malta (apart from Valletta Harbour), and still more in the adjacent and more primitive island of Gozo, the cult of the oculus flouLrishes in greater vigour than anywhere else I know of except in Eastern Sicily; nowhere else are its powers so firmly believed in, and its influence against evil and bad luck recognized. Very many of the three principal types of fishing boats, ferillas, lozzus and cayicos (cayiques), follow the custom of placing oculi on their bows. The big Gozo cargo and passenger boats named dghaisa tat-pass also carry it; only on the harbour boats of Valletta has it degenerated and passed into other forms. Each oculus on these boats is typically carved in relief in wood, and attached at the fore end of the triangular space at the bow lying between the sheered fore end of the wash-strake and the straight upper line of the colouring of the bottom and bilge strake. This triangular area is called the " moustache " (Maltese, mustaco)</page><page sequence="26">314 JAMES HORNELL.-Survivals of the Use of Oculi in Modern Boats. it is usually painted red. Mr. G. Caruana, to whom I owe many of the details given in this section, informed mle that if there be mourning in the family due to the death of a prominent member, the red is replaced by black or by dark blue. The beading under the wash-strake is also usually repainted blue or black in such circumstances. The form of the oculus is characteristic. Great prominence is given to the eyebrow, as is also done at Syracuse; it is thick, heavy and bushv, its hairy nature represented by coarse oblique curved ridges as shown in Plate XIX, Fig. 33, and text-fig. 28. The orbit is elongated and rather narrow, a characteristic of the Maltese and East Sicilian oculus, in contrast with the rounded form seen in Western Sicily. Usually the eyebrow is painted yellow. The pupil is coloured dark blue or black, with the eyeball white outlined in dark blue. On a few boats I noted a degenerate form where the eyebrow was omitted. FIG. 28.-FORE END OF A MALTESE LOZZU. THE OCULTJS HAS A VERY HEAVILY MARKED EYEBROW. The use of the oculus is by no means universal in these islands; at Marsa Scirocco and at St. Paul's Bay in Malta, while oculi were common at the time of my visit, the majority of the boats were without them. In Gozo the custom prevrails more generally, but forty years ago, according to Mr. Caruana, none had abandoned their use. In Malta the oculus appears to be looked upon as little other than an evil-eye amulet. In Gozo an older conception prevails, the oculus being regarded, though vaguely, as the emblem of the guardian spirit of the boat. The fishermen, or certain of them, associate loosely the success or good luck of a boat with its " eyes." Mr. (G. Caruana, who belongs himself to Gozo, related a significant incident concerning a newly-built fishing boat that had belonged to himself; carved oculi had as usual been affixed upon the " moustache " before launching. The boat had phenomenally good fortune on her first day's fishing, and this continued for some</page><page sequence="27">JAMES HORNELL.--Survivals of the Use of Oculi in Modern Boats. 315 time to the great satisfaction of owner and crew. But one morning it was found that one of the oculi had been slashed as by a knife and half cut away. It was inferred that some other fisherman was jealous of the boat's heavy catches of fish and had spitefully cuit the oculus in the hope of breaking the run of good luck. The crew were much perturbed and angry, and a few days later Mr. Caruana found that a young fisherman belonging to the crewr had slept nightly under the boat on the beach, in the hope of catching the miscreant red-handed--he expected him to rettirn to complete his evil work. He told the owner that had he caught him he would have killed him-evidence of how seriously he viewed this treatment of the oculus. According to Mr. Caruana, who has intinate acquaintance with Gozo fishermen, the older men look upon their boat as an animate being. They consider it as one of the family, and indeed as its most valued member. It is because of this feeling of its animate existence that they endow it with oculi in order to see its way-so said an old fisherman once to Mr. Caruana when he enquired about this. The sense in which they refer to it, also clearly indicates that they consider it essentially feminine. This information, together with that concerning the intimate association of the oculus with the good fortune of the boat, although vague, and essentially indefinite as it is bound to be in the case of men, like the Maltese, devoted to Roman Catholicism, falls into line with the theory that these ideas are the fragmentary relies of a belief entertained in pre-Christian days that by appropriate rites, a deity could be induced to take up habitation in a vessel and afford it protection and direction. As I have pointed out elsewhere,' this was usually, though not inva-riably, a goddess-hence the view of the feminine nature of boats and the common custom of referring to a vessel as " she " and not as " it." In V7alletta Harbour, where customs are subject to disruptive outside influence, being the headquarters of the British Mediterranean fleet and a cosmopolitan town, the elegant harbour passenger boat dghajsa (pronounced " dhaisa "), very seldom carries true oculi, but the bows nearly always bear some other device in substitution: in quite a number of cases a connection with the former can be traced. The first stage of change appears to be the continuation of the deeply grooved eyebrow into a circle, and the substitution of some symbol for the pupil. Commonly this symbol is a flag, generally that of Malta-a white St. George's cross on a red ground (P1. XIX, Fig. 34). A related device is seen on the bows of British naval picket boats and cutters, and it would be of interest to ascertain if this has been derived from the Maltese custom or whether the reverse has taken place. The deeply-grooved eyebrow when continued into a circle would look exactly like a ring of rope, and for this it is usually taken. What strongly suggests that the origin of this corded circle is the eyebrow of the typical Maltese oculus is that it is typicallv coloured yellow like 1 " The Origins and Ethnological Significance of Indian Boat Designs," loc. cit.</page><page sequence="28">316 JAMES HORNELL.-Survivals of the Use of Oculi in Modern Boats. the oculus eyebrow, and that it is cut in relief and fastened to the boat's planking in the same way as the true Maltese oculus. Once the tradition of the inward significance of the oculus disappears, no law of custom remains to stabilize the form of the substituted device. At Yalletta this results in a most instructive series of changes which transform the original symbol of a flag within a corded circle into a bird device. The first step in this transformation is the substitution of a plain yellow circle for the cordedl ring around the inscribed flag. The next stage is the omission of the circle, leaving the flag alone as the device on the bow. After this, we find some decorative device added to the flag, usually a bird carrying a small pennant in its beak. Finally we have the omission of the flag or pennant in its beak and the triumph of the bird, a favourite device; sometimes the bird carries a scroll in place of the flag, whereon may be painted the name of the boat. Although the boatmen of Valletta have lost their understanding ard respect for the ocuilus, they are none the less superstitious and anxious to avert their craft being overlooked by the evil-eye, by attaching to it some well-recognized protective amulet. The favourite one is that of the partially closed hand making the sign of the horns, the index finger and little finger extended. Sometimes this is placed on the bows in the place normally occupied by the oculus, but more frequently it is placed on the quarter. The VTalletta boatmen either paint this symbol on their boats, the common custom, or make relief representations in wood or metal and attach these to the bows or quarters as they fancy. In Sicily and Italy a horseshoe is similarly fastened upon the quarter or stern occasionally. The Maltese type of oculus would appear to have had a common origin with that of Syracuse, and there can be no douibt that the former is the nmore closely related to the parent form. In the Maltese oculus the eyebrow is realistic, though certainly its relative size to the orbit is exaggerated ancd its appearance coarsened. The Syracusan eyebrow is so conventionalized as to become a caricature of nature, but in the short thick strokes that arise from the basal line, it is easy to recognize the oblique markings in the Maltese form. This conclusion that the Maltese and Syracusan types are intimately related is easily understandable when we learn from the Maltese chronicles that Gozo was once depopulated and afterwards colonized by immigrants from Sicily. The fisher people of Malta are probably also largely of Sicilian origin. Hence we infer that the Maltese oculus preserves for us an ancient Sicilian type, from which the present-dav Syracusan has degenerated. We would further infer from this that the Gozo people came from the vicinitv of Syracuse. PORTUGAL.-From various accounts of the fishing boats and small coasters operated by the Portuguese, and from models in museums, it is evident that the oculus custom is, or was till recently, as widely spread as on the east coast of Sicily. Indeed so closely akin are the Portuguese types that there can be no doubt that thev arose</page><page sequence="29">JAMES HORNELL.-Survivals of the Use of Oculi in Modern Boats. 317 from a common source. The best account of these boats is that entitled Estado Actual das Pescas im Portugal, by A. A. Baldaque da Silva, published at Lisbon by the Ministry of Marine, in 1891. Figs. 29 to 32, reproduced from this work, show the range in ocular variation prevailing. FIG. 29.-FORE PART OF A CAIIQUE DA COSTA OF ALGARVE, SETUBAL AND LISBON (AFTER BALDAQUE DA SILVA). Taken generally, the more typical show a close resemblance to the oculi of Eastern Sicily and Malta. Especially was this so in the case of the oculus of the muleta, an old type of Portuguese craft that has died out of recent years. The muleta oculi, as in a model in the Science Museum, South Kensington (P1. XIX, Fig. 21), are so closely akin to the Syracusan type, especially in the formation of the eyebrow, that if they are not nearly related by common origin, the two forms FIG. 30.-CANOA OF CEZIMBRA AND SETUBAL. COMPARE THE MOP-HEAD ORNAMENT ON THE STEM HEAD OF THIS BOAT AND OF THAT SHOWN IN FIG. 29 WITH THAT OF THE CATANIAN BOAT (FIG. 18). (AFTER BALDAQUE DA SILVA). show a remnarkable parallelism. This resemblance cannot, however, be fortuitous, for actual relationship is proved when we compare the design of bow in the two types, Portuguese and Syracusan. Reference to Fig. 18, a typical Syracusan fishing boat, shows that the stem head ornament is precisely the same as that of the cahique of Algarve, Setubal and Lisbon, depicted in Fig. 29, and also with the can6a</page><page sequence="30">318 JAMES HORNELL.-Survivals of the Ulse of Oculi in Modern Boats. of Cezimbra and Setubal (Fig. 30). All three show a form of turbaned stemhead derived from one oni which the skin of a sacrificial goat (Sicilv) or of a rabbit (Gozo) has been hung. Whether the intimate mediaeval connection that once. existed between Spain and Sicily has anything to do with this similarity seems more than doubtful; the more probable explanation perhaps is that this community of design in at least two outstanding features, between the boats of Portugal and those of Syracuse, indicates that there was a greater agreement of custom among the shore- dwellers of the. Mediterranean 1,500 years ago or more, than we are usually prepared to admit; possibly the mop stemhead is a relic of Muhammadan influence. The oculus of the fishing boat of Buiarcos (Fig. 31) exhibits an unusual and degenerate form of oculus apparently of no special interest. That of the caldo of Algarve (Fig. 32) is more interesting, as it is of that very rare form in which the eye is shown in profile. The only other instance of this form that I can recall is on a galley depicted on a coini of Leucas in Acarnania, where, as seen in Fig. 14, the foremost of three eves shown u-pon the wash-strake appears to be of this form. -~~~ FIG. 31.-FISHING BOAT OF BUARCOS WITH GREATLY DEGENERATE OCULUS (AFTER BALDAQUE DA SILVJA). FIG. 32.-CALAO OF ALGARVE WITH SPIKE-ARMED STEM AND REALISTIC OCULUS (AFTER BALDAQUE DA SILVA). ITALY.-In Italy, as apart from Sicily, the use of the oculus is now comparatively rare on the western coast; on the Adriatic coast survivals are, I believe, still fairly common, but the information at my command is too nieagre to permit of any descriptions being given. In the neighbourhood of Naples and Leghorn-localities with which I am familiar-a true oculus is never seen now. At Naples, however, I have seen, but very rarely, a couple of rudely drawn circles on the tiny breakwater just behind the stem head (Fig. 33). These appear to be vestigial oculi. On the bows of a few other boats in this neighbourhood I have also seen indications in the form of small discs and rings (Fig. 34). Much more frequent are stars on the bows in the place where the oculi are usually located, and similar to those already described from Messina. In one case a small coaster at Torre del G-reco had both a circle and a star on each bow. The</page><page sequence="31">JAMES HORNELL.-Survivals of the Use of Oculi in Modern Boats. 319 ~object of placing stars on boats is, I was informed, as protection against the evil- eye. At Leghorn I have also seen a few boats with stars on the bows. FRANCE.-In France, especially on the south coast, the custom of placing stars on the. bows of boats is more common than elsewhere. At Toulon, for example, 0 o FIG. 33.-BOWS AND STEM OF A NEAPOLITAN FISHING BOAT. TWO CIRCULAR OCULI DECORATE THE FORE SIDE OF THE LITTLE BREAKWATER ABAFT THE STEM.

The same boats have a peculiar form of stem terminal. The end of the stem-post is obliquely truncate; on each side is a cushion-like rounded cheek FIG. 35.-FORE END OF A TOULON FISHING BOAT, WITH THE BOWS DECORATED WITH TWO STARS; NOTE THE CUSHION CHEEK ON THE EXTREMITY OF THE PROLONGATION OF THE STEM.</page><page sequence="32">320 JAMES HORNELL.-Survitvals of the Use of Oculi in Modern Boats. made of a separate piece nailed on. These " cheeks " are generally painted red; the general appearance strikes one as distinctly phallic, but I am inclined to think that it is more probably a modification of the skin-clad knobbed stem-post once common in Sicily, Malta and Portugal. The star decoration of the bows is equally common at Marseilles. On the Seine and the Rhone, and elsewhere in France and in Belgium, the canal barges and steam tugs in very many cases have a great coloured triangle (usually red), the " moustache " as it is named in Malta, on each bow. It is often margined with a narrow wvhite line and in a considerable number of instances I have seen a star painted upon this red ground, one on each bow. There can be little doubt that this star decoration is a modification of the oculus, and that on the shores of the Mediterranean it is put on boats purely as an amulet against the evil-eye. In northern France and in England, where occasionally it is also met with, the original motive has been forgotten, just as has happened in respect of the field scarecrow, now ne.ver linked in the mind of English people with its original object as a devices to protect crops from being " overlooked " and thereby injured. In such cases the star has become a meaningless decoration placed in position from some obscure instinDct to follow this particular custom. All the sketches illustrating this paper are made from my own photographs and field drawings with the exception of figures 7, 11, 12, 15 and 29 to 32. I have to thank my assistant, Mr. K. R. Samuel, for the great care he has taken to make the finished drawings both artistic and technically accurate; without them my notes would lose much of their value. Postscript. Since writing the preceding notes, I have found oculi with an associated device on Hindu-owned fishing boats belonging to the port of Tondi and to adjacent fishing villages on the western margin of Palk Bay. This observation extends considerably the southerly range of this custom in India. These Tondi boats are large plank-built craft of canoe shape; each is provided with a stout balance-board made from a heavy palmyra plank laid athwart the boat amidships, the ends projecting several feet on each side. The stem head and the top of the stern-post are usually daubed vermilion in Hindu-owned boats; not so in those belonging to Muhammadans. Each oculus is a crudely daubed ellipse with a round spot in the centre (Fig. 36) underneath it is a zig-zag line which I have no doubt is a degenerate form of the scroll device occasionally seen on the masula boats of the Coromandel coast and on the canal boats of the Kistna and Godaveri deltas. The fishermen can give no explanation of its significance other than that it is the customary device upon their boats.</page><page sequence="33">Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute, Vol. LIII, 1923, Plate XIX. 1 .1&lt;, &amp; 6.26. 4. 17. 1 2 20 10.} 30. 03. 21&amp; _28. 3.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~9 9 .0 ~~~~29. 4. ~~~~~~12 .4 20o 13. 21. 0 31. 2 2. 23 3 2. 2 3.~~~~3 24. 93 SURVIVALS OF THE USE OF OCULI IN M~ODERN BOATS.</page><page sequence="34">Joulrnal of the Boyal Anthropological In8titute, Vol. Llll, 1923, Plate XX. d`7 .. ....... .... . .. ...S..M' ...</page><page sequence="35">JAMES HORNELL.--Survivals of the Use of Oculi in Modern Boats. 321 The zig-zagr is slightly swollen or enlarged at its hinder end; this probably represents the terminal short coil at the posterior end of the curved device seen in the iorus eye. If mv interpretation be correct, this observation of the degeneration of a scroll device. into a zig-zag or chevron form. may help materially in arriving at the origin or motive of some of the crude decorative schemes seen upon the sides of other boats in South India. iu1G. 36.-Bow OF A TONDI FISHING BOAT, SHOWING EYE AND ZIG-ZAG DEVICE BENEATH. It is also probable that oculi were formerly in current use on indigenous Burmese river craft, for in the Pitt-Rivers Museum at Oxford there is a model of a large Burmese river boat, with outboard lateral platforms, provided with large oculi painted in black. Each has a well-marked eyebrow and also a curved line beneath, a form related closely to the Indian type and entirely different from the Chinese form seen on sampans in Burmese ports. The practice is probably local or becoming rare, for I observed oculi on no Burmese boats during a recent visit to Rangoon and Bassein, DESCRIPTION OF PLATE XIX. TYPES OF OCULI.
