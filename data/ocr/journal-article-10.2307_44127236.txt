Anthropology has played an important role in the effort to better understand HIV risk behaviors among drug users and to develop empirically grounded interventions. However, the study of highly vulnerable and social stigmatized populations raises important ethical issues, including the full extent of researcher responsibility to the subjects of research. This paper uses a case study approach to explore these issues. The case in question is a research participant who was killed by police in what they describe as a "police-assisted suicide" not long after his last interaction with research staff. The paper seeks to initiate discussion among researchers, funders, providers, and policy makers concerning key ethical and responsibility issues in HTV/AIDS research. Key words: research ethics, researcher responsibility, HIV/AIDS, drug users, vulnerable populations The victimization, lic death attention. of a street In exposure addition drug to user to the drug rarely elements, overdose, draws and much violence automo- pub- lic attention. In addition to drug overdose, violence victimization, exposure to the elements, and automo- bile accidents, a range of infectious diseases, including HIV, regularly claim the lives of illicit drug users without drawing widespread notice. Occasionally, because of the dramatic nature of the way a drug user dies, this pattern is vio- lated. Such was the case in the death of Tony Lando (pseudonym), a 26-year-old drug user of mixed Puerto Rican and Italian heritage, who was sought by the police because he allegedly burglarized his parent's home, pre- sumably to support his addiction. He also was wanted for criminal mischief and failure to appear in court on an earlier charge. Early in April 1999, the police, directed to his where- abouts by a call from a concerned family member, arrived at Tony's apartment reportedly intent on serving an arrest war- rant. When no one responded to their knocks on the door of the apartment where Tony was said to be living, the police persuaded the building superintendent to let them in. After a brief search, they found Tony inside, waving a knife with an 1 8-inch blade. The officers reported that they instructed Tony to drop the knife, but he adamantly refused. Then, they claimed, he suddenly lunged at them with the knife. Two of- ficers rapidly fired eight rounds. Tony was hit several times and slumped to the floor. He died instantly. Merrill Singer is associate director and chief of research, Hispanic Health Council Elsa Huertas is the manager of the Hispanic Health Council Research Department and the coordinator of the study pre- sented in this paper. Glenn Scott is an HIV outreach educator and inter- viewer at the Hispanic Health Council. Questioned by newspaper reporters, a number of police officers indicated that Tony's actions suggested a "suicide- by-police" scenario. In such instances, a highly distraught individual aggressively engages in threatening behavior to provoke the police into killing him. The police supported this interpretation of the events in Tony's apartment by citing an incident three months earlier. On that occasion, the police had been called to the same apartment by a bounty hunter who was trying to capture Tony, wanted at the time for jump- ing bail on an earlier arrest. During this prior incident, Tony is said to have held a knife to his own throat and vowed he would not submit to arrest. He finally changed his mind, how- ever, and was taken into custody. All of this information was reported in a newspaper article on Tony's death, according him greater individual public notice than most impoverished street drug users usually receive. Tony's obscurity was further diminished by the fact that, in addition to being a wayward son, a known drug user with a long rap sheet, and an otherwise unemployed self-admitted petty drug dealer, he was also a very dependable participant in a longitudinal study of HIV risk among street drug users. Over the course of three years, from February 2, 1996, until his death, Tony was interviewed by members of our research team on three occasions concerning his sociodemographic characteristics, drug use patterns, HIV risk behaviors, health and mental health status, personality characteristics, and re- lated matters. He also was provided with various interven- tion services. His last interview occurred about a month and a half before his death. How Tony died and the young age at which his life ended were shocking to our research team, but the death of a participant in this project, which involves almost 1,300 individuals at high risk for drug overdose, HIV and other VOL. 59, NO. 4, WINTER 2000 389</page><page sequence="2">infections, and violence, is not a rare event. Since the project began in 1993, approximately 3 percent of study participants - most of whom were in their 30s and 40s - have died of various causes. This mortality rate, which is 4.6 times higher than that of the 35-44 age group in Hartford, Connecticut (Poledňák 1998), suggests the level of vulner- ability of the study population. Nonetheless, the possibility that our research might have played a specific role in avert- ing Tony's death - for example, by spotting that he was sui- cidal - raises significant questions about the proactive inter- vention services incorporated into basic research projects with heavy drug-using populations, groups that are known to suf- fer from high rates of mental health problems and to be sig- nificantly involved (as perpetrators and victims) in violence. These issues will be examined using Tony's case, as well as other data from our studies with street drug users over the last 10 years. Research Ethics with Human Subjects In the wake of the AIDS pandemic, there has been a rapid expansion in the quantity and variety of research initia- tives conducted among illicit drug users, especially among ethnic minority, inner-city drug users who can be recruited through street outreach. This research program has produced a number of tangible benefits, including: documenting the rapid diffusion of HIV among injection drug users through multiple-person reuse of infected syringes; identifying little known routes of HIV transmission in drug-using populations; determining the important role of crack cocaine in the sexual transmission of HIV through unprotected sex for drugs/money transactions; monitoring the emergence of new drug use and HIV risk patterns, such as the relatively recent appearance of crack cocaine injection; focusing public health attention on structural factors that promote risky behaviors among drug users, including various unhealthy health policies; examin- ing the public health risks associated with various types of drug use settings; discerning the importance of gender rela- tions, ethnicity, and geographic location in drug use and re- lated HIV risk patterns; documenting the effectiveness of outreach approaches to the recruitment of hidden populations of drug users into intervention; clarifying the limitations of education-only and individually targeted approaches to drug- user risk reduction; establishing the willingness of drug us- ers to adopt protective behaviors to avoid HIV infection; re- vealing the importance of "intertwined epidemics" like HIV, STDs, TB, and hepatitis; testing the success of alternative risk reduction strategies targeted to drug users; affirming the contributions of environmental interventions like syringe exchange in lowering rates of infection; establishing natu- rally occurring limits on HIV risk reduction among injection drug users; and clarifying the role of drug-user social net- works in HIV transmission and prevention (Des Jaríais and Friedman 1998; Needle et al. 1998; Singer 1999a; Sloboda 1998). As Needle et al. (1998:5) maintain, "Epidemiological and ethnographic studies were crucial in guiding early HIV prevention programs.... This prevention response has changed the course of the HIV epidemic for drug users." Despite these significant advances, aspects of the inten- sified research program targeted to drug users raise serious ethical dilemmas as well as troublesome questions about the accountability of social and behavioral scientists engaged in such research (Coughlin and Beauchamp 1996; Levine 1991 ; Loue 1995; Singer et al. 1999). Examining one of these ethi- cal issues - the appropriate extent of the intervention respon- sibilities of researchers studying highly at-risk drug users - is the purpose of this paper. In other words, when studying highly at-risk and otherwise vulnerable populations, how broadly should the lines be drawn concerning the obligations of researchers to ensure the welfare of the study population, including risks that do not originate with and are not the direct consequence of participation in research? Discourse on research ethics has focused on the risks to human subjects that are directly created or enhanced by research procedures and activities. With highly vulnerable populations should research responsibility be expanded beyond current standards to include additional protective behaviors in light of the knowledge researchers gain about study participants? The field of research ethics that has developed over the last five decades strongly emphasizes the importance of mini- mizing harm to research subjects. This orientation emerged initially as a reaction to gross and intentional violations of subject agency and well-being by Nazi researchers prior to and during World War II. The establishment of generally shared standards for acceptable research with human sub- jects dates to the postwar Nuremberg War Crimes Trials and the Nuremberg Code. The Helsinki Declaration of 1964 (re- vised in 1975), the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare 1974 Guidelines, The Belmont Report on Ethi- cal Principles and Guidelines for the Protection of Human Subjects of Research, public and researcher revulsion over the infamous Tuskegee syphilis study (White 2000), and a range of other incidents, seminal meetings, and documents have all contributed to the consolidation of contemporary thinking about research ethics with human subjects. Codes for the specific conduct of social and behavioral research have been adopted by a number of professional associations, be- ginning with the Society for Applied Anthropology in 1949 (van Willigen 1993:32), and followed by the American An- thropological Association and the American Sociological Association in 1971, the American Psychological Associa- tion in 1972, and the National Association for the Practice of Anthropology in 1988 (Diener and Crandall 1978:221-229; Ervin 2000:30). [For the most recent version of the ethics codes for these and related professional associations go to &lt;http:/Avww. aaanet. org/committees/ethics/ethics . htm&gt; .] Based on these diverse sources, three basic principles of ethical research have been established and are widely accepted among researchers: 1) The Principle of Autonomy and Re- spect asserts that people have the ability and must be given the right to act as autonomous moral agents, including en- suring voluntary, noncoerced participation in research based 390 HUMAN ORGANIZATION</page><page sequence="3">on a clear and open process of informed consent; 2) The Dual Principle of Beneficence and Avoidance of Malfeasance main- tains that researchers have a moral obligation to be highly sen- sitive to the health and well-being of human subjects, to avoid unduly harmful methods, and to use research to maximize human well-being; and 3) The Principle of Distributive Jus- tice emphasizes that standards of equality and fairness must be adhered to in determining who benefits and who bears the burdens of research. These three principles have come to serve as the foundation for an encompassing framework that guides much of the current biomedical as well as the social and be- havioral research conducted among drug users (Beauchamp 1994; Beauchamp and Childress 1983; Marshall 1992; Marshall et al. 1996; Muller 1994; Singer et al. 1999). These principles are operationalized at various levels in the contemporary research process. At the local level, they are interpreted by human subject panels (i.e., institutional review boards or IRBs) established at grant-seeking institu- tions such as universities and research institutes (LeCompte and Schensul 1999). Grants that receive IRB approval are then reviewed by scientific review groups, such as those es- tablished by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), to evalu- ate both the scientific merit and the human subject accept- ability of all grant applications. National advisory councils also evaluate all applications for compliance with Depart- ment of Health and Human Services human subject regula- tions. Current guidelines for federally funded research stress that grant applicants have the primary responsibility for safe- guarding the rights and welfare of individuals who partici- pate as subjects in research activities. Six factors are taken into account in assessing the ethical protections included in applications for federal research funding: 1) provision of a detailed description of proposed human subject involvement in the research design, including specification of the charac- teristics of the subject populations; 2) identification of the sources of research information obtained on research participants (e.g., interviews, observations, medical records, physical examinations and mental health assess- ments, anthropomorphic measures, biological specimens) and indication of whether these are newly collected data for the purposes of research or are gleaned from existing records; 3) description of subject recruitment and consent procedures, including description of the conditions under which consent will be obtained; 4) identification of the spe- cific physical, psychological, social, legal, or other risks that participants will face as a result of their involvement in the research; 5) report of the exact procedures to be adopted to protect subjects against or minimize potential risks, includ- ing specification of the provisions to be adopted for ensuring necessary medical or professional intervention in the event that subjects experience adverse effects as a result of their participation in the research; and 6) justification of any po- tential risks to which subjects will be exposed in light of the anticipated benefits to the subjects and in relationship to the importance of the knowledge likely to be produced by the research (National Institutes of Health 1999). However comprehensive the various research principles and guidelines noted above, Tony's case raises questions about their adequacy in conducting research with highly vulner- able populations such as street drug users, a group known to suffer a disproportionate level of mental health problems like depression and anxiety (Grant 1997; Latkin and Mandeli 1993; Rounsaville et al. 1982a) as well as more recently iden- tified hematological conditions known to affect cognitive ability (Montoya et al. 1998). Tony's case points to the possible need for additional principles of research responsibility that go beyond minimiz- ing the harm caused by personal, social, environmental, or other changes directly or indirectly introduced by research- ers. Specifically, his case suggests that, in working with high- risk populations, researchers should also be concerned with using their research findings and interactions with vulner- able individuals to help protect participants from harm that may befall them outside of the research context. Of course, there are limits to researcher awareness of potential risks faced by their study participants (e.g., it would have been difficult to anticipate the specific circumstances of Tony's death) and limits to the abilities of researchers to act on behalf of the perceived well-being of subjects (e.g., because subjects de- cline offers of assistance, because uninvited intervention would itself be an ethical violation, and because the required assistance may be far beyond the fiscal or training capacity of the research program). For example, members of our re- search team have come across situations in which study par- ticipants who appeared to be in extreme distress adamantly and unwaveringly refused assistance. In such instances, re- searchers must make careful and sometimes difficult judg- ments about the capacity of the individual to understand the dire nature of the situation and to make rational decisions about possible courses of action. Reaching defensible conclusions in such situations is greatly facilitated by the existence of ethical guidelines that researchers can turn to and use to make difficult deci- sions. It is not clear, however, that current guidelines ad- equately mandate the inclusion of procedures for using the research context for fully assessing the life-threatening risks and conditions faced by study participants and for mobiliz- ing available resources for moving them from harm's way. Within anthropology, as noted, statements on ethics have been developed by several national organizations. The American Anthropological Association's (AAA) Code of Ethics (1998) states that anthropologists "must not exploit individuals, groups,. . .they should recognize their debt to the societies in which they work and their obligation to reciprocate with people studied in appropriate ways" (III.A.6). While this language might suggest a basis for the inclu- sion of protective services in the anthropological study of vulnerable populations, the principles do not specifically address this issue or clarify the nature and boundaries of ap- propriate reciprocity. The Ethical Guidelines for Practitioners developed by the National Association of Practicing Anthro- pologists (NAPA 1988) similarly underscores the fundamental VOL. 59, NO. 4, WINTER 2000 39 1</page><page sequence="4">importance of paying close attention to the welfare and hu- man rights of study participants, including assuring recogni- tion for their contributions to research and protection from violations of confidentiality. However, ethical attention remains focused on risks generated by research rather than those merely encountered by it. The same orientation is found in the Statement of Professional and Ethical Responsibilities created by the Society for Applied Anthropology (SfAA 1997:497), which emphasizes the avoidance of taking or rec- ommending action on behalf of an applied research sponsor that is detrimental to the interests of the community under study. As with the AAA and NAPA, the SfAA assumes the existence of functioning communities that must be protected from emergent harm that originates in one of several ways during the research process, especially: 1) as a result an ex- posure of confidential information; 2) because of a failure to give proper recognition; and 3) because of social changes introduced on the basis of anthropological recommendation. To a notable degree, while emphasizing the avoidance of research maleficence, anthropological statements on eth- ics have tended to underplay the issue of beneficence. As noted in the Belmont Report, beneficence commonly is de- fined as "acts of kindness or charity that go beyond strict obligation" (National Commission for the Protection of Hu- man Subjects 1978:6). These acts, which are intended to se- cure the well-being of study participants, are specifically defined in the Belmont Report not as issues of generosity but as obligations inherent in the research process. Unfortunately, even the Belmont Report does not offer directions concern- ing the boundaries and content of beneficent responsibility. Rather, the report accentuates the importance of avoiding harm without clarifying to what extent researchers are obli- gated to protect the well-being of participants from preexist- ing harm. Importantly, however, in its discussion of research justice the Belmont Report does call attention to the special vulnerabilities of some populations (National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects 1978:19-20): One special instance of injustice results from involvement of vulnerable subjects. Certain groups, such as racial mi- norities, the economically disadvantaged, the very sick, and the institutionalized may continually be sought as research subjects, owing to their ready availability in set- tings where research is conducted. Here the concern is not researcher obligation to address the immediate expressions of vulnerability (to say nothing of their ultimate causes), but rather with prohibiting the ex- ploitation of these vulnerabilities for research purposes. From a broader ethical standpoint, however, one that is guided by the view that the purpose of research is to expand human knowledge for the specific purpose of improving the quality of human life, the study of "vulnerable bodies and fragile lives" (Scheper-Hughes 1995:409) raises questions about special researcher obligations and the soundness of aloof jus- tifications of inaction on the basis of narrow and immediate research priorities. This reexamination of researcher responsibility has spe- cial ramifications for anthropology because of the distinc- tive nature of ethnography, the hallmark of anthropological research. Ethnography is a unique approach to social research because of its: 1) location of performance (in the social and geographic domain of the community or group under study); 2) context of realization (it is closely interwoven with the everyday and sometimes private and quite intimate or emotionally charged activities of study participants); 3) in- vestigative goals (to grasp the - sometimes very private - insiders' understandings and experiences); 4) methods of data collection (including participation in the day-to-day activi- ties of members of the community under study and direct observation of behavior in social context); and 5) level of personal commitment (ethnographers, while in the field, do not, in a sense, go to work; rather, they live on the job, their work involves immersion in the lives of their research par- ticipants, and as a result the personal lives of ethnographers are not, by design, sharply separated from those of research participants) (Singer et al. 1999). Ethnographers commonly spend long stretches of time with research participants and frequently develop very close personal relationships with at least some of them. Indeed, from the subject's perspective, the ethnographer as a person may be of far greater significance than the ethnographer as a researcher (a role that the subject may not well understand or, conversely, understand quite well but thoroughly dislike). While in some types of social inquiry researcher responsibil- ity may appear appropriately limited to the specific context of the risks or burdens produced by the research project, in ethnography the boundaries between research activities and other arenas of study participants' lives often are blurred. As a result, anthropologists have tended to assume a much broader "contract" and set of moral obligations than may be the case in other research disciplines. As Wax (1971:41) ob- serves with reference to Alfred Lindesmith, an early ethnog- rapher of illicit drug use: the involvement of the fieldworker undermine[s] his pre- tense of moral neutrality. After working among opiate addicts, Alfred Lindesmith became a lifelong critic of the harshly repressive laws of the United States and the bar- baric procedures of the federal narcotics bureau. Consequently, a number of anthropologists, such as Scheper-Hughes (1995:415) have called for an "active, po- litically committed, morally engaged anthropology." Accord- ing to Scheper-Hughes (1995:419), anthropological research should be guided by an "ethic of care and responsibility." According to this ethic, researchers cannot narrowly draw a privileged circle around their domain of responsibility. In- deed, she asserts, contrary to the anthropological tendency to view morality as variable and embedded within specific cultural constructions of reality, there is an alternative view that understands ethics as prior to culture because it is social ethics that makes culture possible. As Lévinas (1987:100) writes, "Morality does not belong to culture: [it] enables one 392 HUMAN ORGANIZATION</page><page sequence="5">to judge it." In other words, as Scheper-Hughes (1995: 419) suggests, "responsibility, accountability, answerability to 'the other' - the ethical as I would define it - is precultural to the extent that our human existence as social beings presupposes the presence of the other." Culture, in short, emerged as a peculiarly human approach to préexistent interpersonal so- cial relationship; and social relationship, by its very nature, demands some form of interpersonal obligation. In this sense, those who argue against broader responsibility - on the grounds of maintaining proper researcher distance and sci- entific purity - ignore our deeper, even precultural responsi- bilities as social beings. Within applied anthropology, this enhanced orientation to researcher responsibility is evidenced especially in the advocacy discourse (Marshall 1991). As Partridge (1985: 157) maintains, our responsibility as anthropological practitioners "requires a commitment beyond narrow professionalism to take action once analysis indicates a course of action." This "commitment to socially responsible science" is rooted in an ethic of social practice that Partridge (1985:157) believes "contrasts vividly with the ethic of noninvolvement" (Par- tridge 1985:157) characteristic of basic (i.e., nonapplied) sci- entific research (e.g., D' Andrade 1995). However, it can be argued that anthropology can be understood as comprising a continuum of advocatorial stances. At the left end of this continuum. . .lies the use of the eth- nographic encounter in the service of anthropologically defined goals (e.g., broadening human understanding, expanding cultural knowledge). . . . At the other end of the continuum is the use of the ethnographic encounter in the service of the Other, including defending the right to self- determination or promoting access to needed resources (Singer 1990:549). From the perspective of advocacy anthropology (Schensul and Schensul 1978; Singer 1993; Stull and Schensul 1987), there is no contradiction between science and action, focused research and social responsibility, and morality and adherence to objective standards for knowledge generation. Put simply, advocacy anthropology justifies the existence of the discipline in terms of its contributions to the enhancement of human welfare and hence finds contradic- tory approaches to research that treat active response to social suffering as beyond the purview of researcher respon- sibility. These points are addressed below by examining fea- tures of the research project in which Tony participated and specific aspects of Tony's case. Project COPE: The Community Outreach Prevention Effort In October of 1988, with funding from the National In- stitute on Drug Abuse, our consortium of community research institutes and community service organizations initiated Project COPE I, a study of AIDS risk and prevention among street-injection drug users (IDUs) and their sex partners in Hartford, Conneticut (Singer et al. 1991, 1992a, Weeks et al. 1995).2 Hartford was seen as an important site for testing AIDS prevention efforts because the city had: 1) a high pro- portion of African Americans (32%) and Latinos (29%), two ethnic minority groups known to be at heightened risk for HIV infection; 2) a notably high percentage of residents liv- ing below the federal poverty line (26%) despite being lo- cated in the state with the highest per capita income in the country; 3) the highest rate of AIDS cases per capita in the state and the 18th highest in the nation in metropolitan areas with 500,000 or more population; and 4) a comparatively large number of injection drug users per capita (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 1997; City of Hartford 1998; Hynes et al. 1999; Singer et al. 1992a). Further, the city has long suffered with an artificially narrow tax base (caused by state laws that restrict the incorporation of its natural sub- urbs as part of the city); a tendency for surrounding areas to offer limited social services to the poor (resulting in migra- tion to Hartford); a failing school system that is unable to adequately train students for white-collar employment; a shrinking number of blue-collar or lower-skill jobs; great disparity and tension between very wealthy downtown cor- porations and impoverished residential neighborhoods; en- trenched discrimination against in-migrating populations such as the city's growing Latino population; and regional prox- imity to one of the largest illicit drug markets (New York City) in the world. Puerto Ricans have been migrating from the island to Hartford in large numbers since the 1960s. The official un- employment rate (17%) for Puerto Rican men in Hartford is more than double the rate for non-Hispanic white men (7%). Although the Puerto Rican population is significantly younger than the non-Hispanic white population in the city, only 68 percent of Puerto Rican men are still in the civilian labor force, compared to 75 percent of non-Hispanic white men. In a community survey of approximately 400 Puerto Rican men, 18-48 years of age, 33 percent reported they were un- employed and looking for work and another 17 percent worked only part-time (Singer et al. 1992b). Among Puerto Rican men in Hartford who do have employment, discrimi- nation and low levels of education "force many. . .to stagnate in low-paying dead-end jobs" (Becerra and Greenblatt 1983: 20). Unemployed or underemployed Puerto Rican men face not only a lack of work but the regular experience of failure in their culturally constituted role as males, as well as a con- siderable level of social discrimination and disparagement in the wider society. Illicit drug use, particularly drug injec- tion, is a common, if highly risky, coping strategy, one that begins during the teen years and continues well into middle age (Singer et al. 1992b). Launched as part of the National AIDS Demonstration Research (NADR) projects, Project COPE I was one of 29 projects implemented around the country (and in Puerto Rico) that ultimately recruited over 150,000 injection drug users (IDUs) and their sex partners into a basic epidemiological investigation of drug use- and sex-related risk behaviors and VOL. 59, NO. 4, WINTER 2000 393</page><page sequence="6">an evaluation study of intervention effectiveness in dimin- ishing HIV risk. An outgrowth of five years of applied re- search on HIV (Singer 1996a), and a previous study of adult male drinking behavior and problem drinking in Hartford (Singer et al. 1992b), the Hartford NADR project was the first concentrated study of illicit street drug use by our re- search team. Three and a half years later, when we were funded by NIDA for Project COPE II as a component of the 23-site Cooperative Agreement (CA) for the AIDS Community-Based Outreach/Intervention Research Program, we had gained a significantly increased understanding of illicit street drug use, the contexts and conditions of inner-city drug consumption, patterns of behavior among street addicts, and the range of problems encountered by drug users. As a result of COPE I, we knew that rates of HIV infection among IDUs in Hartford were extremely high (40% for African Americans and 37% for Latinos). Moreover, we had abundant exposure to the ways drug use (including drug overdose and withdrawal), poverty and lack of stable incomes, frequent changes of residence and lack of secure housing, multiple health problems, do- mestic and street violence, fear of AIDS, and the constant threat of arrest and police harassment contribute to high lev- els of self-reported stress and depression among street drug users (Singer 1994, 1995, 1996b, 1999b). Despite these com- plex and intertwined challenges, IDU participants in COPE I reported a 57.6 percent reduction in AIDS risk behavior at six-month follow-up, affirming the value of community-based research with drug users. The COPE II study was designed to utilize knowledge and insights from COPE I in the development and evaluation of the effectiveness of culturally appropriate AIDS preven- tion models for African American and Latino IDUs and noninjection crack cocaine users (Weeks et al. 1996). The project initiated street outreach and recruitment of drug us- ers (individuals who injected drugs or used crack during the previous 30 days and who had not been in drug treatment during this period) for AIDS education, pretest counseling, HIV testing, AIDS-related interviewing, and random assign- ment to either a conventional standard or to an enhanced cul- turally appropriate intervention. Following intervention, par- ticipants were recontacted and re-interviewed to assess the impact of the alternative prevention models on drug use and AIDS risk behaviors. Over the course of four years of active outreach, the project recruited 1,300 out-of-treatment drug users. Tony was the 1,240th participant recruited into the project. Like all participants in the COPE II study, Tony was pro- vided with the opportunity to be tested for HIV infection. He agreed to be tested and met with an HIV prevention counse- lor who provided the project's standard pretest counseling risk-reduction intervention (a one-hour assessment of the participant's level of AIDS risk knowledge followed by focused risk-reduction training that emphasized clarification of areas of participant uncertainty or misunderstanding of AIDS risk and prevention). Tony reported he had been tested on one occasion approximately one year before his involvement in COPE II. At the completion of his interview, Tony was in- vited to return to the project, which he did 25 days later, to receive his HIV test results and post-test counseling. Tony's test results, like those of 83 percent of male participants in COPE II (a notable drop from COPE I), showed he was HIV negative. Tony was reinterviewed for follow-up one year af- ter his initial interview. For cases to be counted in the CA national dataset follow-up interviews, they had to be com- pleted 5-10 months after intake interviews, and thus Tony's case was ruled ineligible for inclusion in the dataset of over 25,000 participants recruited into the CA study nationally (confirming his later self-assessment that if something could go wrong for him, it would). Tony missed the original ap- pointment for his follow-up interview because he was in prison on drug-related charges. Nonetheless, despite some problems with follow-up attrition, nationally the CA was deemed a very effective project that generated considerable new knowledge and produced significant drops in HIV risk levels among participants (Booth, Kwiatkowski, and Stephens 1998). In Hartford, we found that participants in the standard prevention modality, the program to which Tony was as- signed, lowered their HIV sexual risk level by 40 percent and their syringe-related HIV risk by 65 percent at six-month follow-up. To assess individual, perceived-peer (i.e., individual understandings of the values and expectations of significant social others), and social-context factors associated with sus- tained HIV risk reduction over time, sustained HIV risk de- spite intervention, and HIV risk relapse, we developed the COPE III study. The study participants for COPE III are the street drug-user cohort originally recruited for COPE II. The new study was designed to monitor longer-term patterns of drug use and HIV risk in this cohort. Recruitment for COPE III began in December 1998. Tony was among the first wave of participants from COPE II who were found through street outreach and scheduled for a follow-up interview. His intake interview for COPE III took place on February 9, 1999. Like the previous COPE interviews, it lasted approximately 45 minutes and examined sociodemographic characteristics, drug use, HIV risk, health status, and involvement with the crimi- nal justice system. In addition, it explored a number of issues not addressed in previous interviews, including self- esteem, locus of control, impulsiveness/risk-taking orienta- tion, social support, life orientation, motivations for illicit drug use, and exposure to violence. A Case Study in Vulnerability Members of our research team interviewed Tony on three occasions over the course of three years. In addition, he par- ticipated in two AIDS prevention sessions and underwent urine toxicology assessment for recent drug use on two oc- casions. While imprisoned on drug charges after his first in- terview, Tony wrote a letter to the outreach worker, a former drug user, who originally recruited him into the COPE study. These sources of information provide a picture of Tony 394 HUMAN ORGANIZATION</page><page sequence="7">during the three years prior to his death, including the period just before he was killed. When Tony was first interviewed in the COPE study, he was 23 years old, had dropped out of high school but had completed a high school equivalency program, was unem- ployed and looking for work - his only source of income was social security benefits. Tony was single but in a heterosexual romantic relationship and had recently moved into his own apartment in an inner-city, mixed Italian and Puerto Rican neighborhood. Although he tested negative for HIV infec- tion, Tony reported he had a reasonably high likelihood (50% chance) of becoming infected eventually. Tony told us he began drinking alcohol and smoking marijuana at age 12. By age 17, he began smoking crack and injecting cocaine. The following year, he began using Xanax, a tranquilizer, and had recently begun injecting heroin and speedball (a mixture of heroin and cocaine). He had never used amphetamines or other illicit drugs. At the time of his first interview, Tony reported he was continuing to use all of these drugs except Xanax. During the previous 30-day pe- riod, he said he had consumed alcohol on 15 occasions and marijuana on 4. Further, he smoked crack at least 100 times, injected cocaine 15 times, and speedball 20 times. Tony's drug of choice was now heroin, and he said he was shooting heroin eight times per day. This level of heroin injection is notably high, especially compared with rates re- ported nationally among illicit drug users. In Hartford, which consistently has had comparatively high rates of injection in its drug using population, Tony's injection pattern was high but not unusual (Singer 1999b). Urine testing for recent drug use showed evidence of both an opiate drug and cocaine in his body. Tony had never been in drug treatment. He denied involvement in the sale of illicit drugs, but did report having been arrested at least 10 times, including once during the previous 30 days, and having served two years in prison. Tony was much like the other street drug users recruited to Project COPE. While the young age at which he began serious drug use, his high frequency of heroin injection, and admitted involvement in risky drug use and sexual practices are notable, they are hardly unusual in the population sampled in the COPE study. What is perhaps most noteworthy about Tony's case is that we were able to recruit him into the project while he was still in his early 20s. Most COPE participants - long-term, hard-core street drug users - were in their 30s and 40s at initial recruitment. During pretest counseling, Tony indicated that if he tested positive for HIV infection he was unsure if he would seek medical treatment. In his log, the HIV counselor who met with Tony before and after his blood test recorded the following: "Client was encouraged to prac- tice risk reduction and to retest in about six months. He should also seek drug treatment." There is no indication that Tony was provided with any specific assistance in entering drug treatment, however. Given lack of funding in the COPE study for the type of intensive case management and advocated referral needed to assist street drug users to enter the limited number of available treatment slots (one COPE HIV counselor for 1,300 participants), only participants who explicitly asked for assistance in entering drug treatment received this type of help directly from the project. Within a few months of being enrolled in the COPE study, Tony did enter treatment - because he was arrested. The project outreach worker who recruited Tony wrote him a let- ter while he was incarcerated. The letter was intended to ex- press support and concern about Tony's welfare. From his response, it is evident that Tony was touched by the outreach worker's concern. Tony's letter expresses his hope that he may finally be turning his life around and heading in a posi- tive direction. He wrote: Things are looking up for me lately here. I am in an inpa- tient [drug treatment] program [within the prison] .... Five days a week we have meditation in the morning, three days a week I go to a group meeting, and twice a week I go to NA [Narcotics Anonymous]. In the groups we talk about all kinds of shit, like violence and things like that which stem from drug addiction. I am listening and learn- ing, probably for the first time in my life. Also, today I was approved for a halfway house. I should be there in about 60 days. I plan on getting a job and continue to learn about recovery. I think that this time I will do it. Tony said his girlfriend had been arrested and wished she would also get into a drug treatment program. He noted: "I know that we are both 100% different when we are off of dope [heroin].... I've seen the proof of how bad people can get fucked up from doing the stuff." In closing, Tony stressed the importance of positive role models and social support in sustaining his recovery from addiction: "Anyway, thanks again for being there. It gives me some inspiration to know there are other people like me who are out there and have turned their lives around." Five months after he wrote this letter, Tony returned to the COPE study for his follow-up interview. At the time, he was living in the halfway house referred to in his letter. He was not working, but his family was giving him some money. Most importantly, Tony reported he had stopped using all drugs and had not injected drugs for over six months. Inmates are able to obtain drugs while in prison, as well as syringes, so Tony's cessation of drug use - which was confirmed by urine toxicology - was not merely a conse- quence of incarceration (Singer et al. n.d.). While in prison, Tony indicated that he was in a special drug treatment pro- gram for almost six months. He also reported no sexual ac- tivity during this period and hence no HIV risk behaviors. Once again, Tony tested HIV negative. He now rated his chance of getting AIDS at half as likely (25%) as during his initial interview. At his final interview, some two years later, Tony was living in his own apartment and supporting himself by steal- ing, selling drugs, doing odd jobs, and getting money from his family. He had relapsed into drug use, reported smoking crack almost every day, and was injecting heroin five times a day. He was also injecting speedball every few days. Most of the time, Tony said, he injected drugs in his apartment, but VOL. 59, NO. 4, WINTER 2000 395</page><page sequence="8">he also shot up sometimes in abandoned buildings. Tony re- mained HIV negative and reported he would probably not get AIDS (a 25% chance). During this interview, we used the Rosenberg Scale to measure self-esteem (Rosenberg 1979). Tony agreed with the following statements: "I feel I do not have much to be proud of; «i wļsj1 J could have more respect for myself'; "I cer- tainly feel useless at times"; and "At times I think I am no good at all." He disagreed with the following statements: "I take a positive attitude toward myself' and "On the whole, I am satisfied with myself." Tony's score on this instrument shows comparatively low self-esteem just prior to his death. Another personal attribute assessed by the COPE III in- strument was impulse sensation seeking (Zuckerman 1994; Zuckerman et al. 1991). Participants were asked to respond "true" or "false" to a series of 19 statements (e.g., "I like 'wild' uninhibited parties"; "I sometimes like to do things that are a little frightening"; and "I'll try anything once"). On approximately 80 percent of these items, Tony selected the answer that reflected having an impulsive and sensation- seeking personality. Another assessment conducted in COPE III involved measuring participants' self-perceived levels of social sup- port (Stowe et al. 1993). Tony's answers on this section of the interview indicated he believed he had high levels of so- cial support and had strong social connections with friends. Tellingly, he answered true to the following item on this scale: "Lately, when I've been troubled, I keep things to myself." The subsequent section of the interview measured partici- pants' levels of optimism. Of the six items on this scale, Tony only agreed with one statement that reflected an optimistic outlook on life. Instead, he believed that "If something can go wrong for me, it will" and "I hardly ever expect things to go my way." He disagreed with the statements "I'm always optimistic about my future" and "Overall, I expect more good things to happen to me than bad." To determine if participants were using illicit drugs to self-medicate emotional distress (Harrison, Hoffman, and Edwall 1989; Singer 1995), we developed a two-part instru- ment based on prior research (Khantzian 1985; Khantzian, Mack, and Schatzberg 1974). Although there is ambiguity in Tony's answers, most of the time (62.5%) he indicated he used drugs to diminish personal problems. The final item in our interview was a checklist that asked participants to indi- cate whether or not they had been exposed to various forms of violence ever in their lives and during the last 12 months. Tony reported that during the last year his home had been broken into, someone had intentionally destroyed his per- sonal property, and his life had been threatened. Over the course of his life, however, Tony indicated that he had been exposed to all of the items on the violence checklist except for two: being raped and getting shot. The latter, tragically, was no longer the case a month and a half after he completed the COPE m interview. Four days before his death, Tony came into the project to receive his last HIV test results. He again tested negative. During post-test counseling, Tony was offered assistance with getting into drug treatment. He responded that he was "not ready." He seemed calm but rather quiet to the HIV counse- lor. Overall, Tony's behavior was uneventful (relative to other participants) and hence unremarkable. In reviewing responses from his several interviews and other materials from the COPE study, Tony emerges as an intelligent but troubled young man with limited formal edu- cation, no specific job skills, low self-esteem, a pessimistic outlook on life, and an impulsive drive that contributed to his involvement with alcohol and marijuana while still in middle school and with harder drugs prior to dropping out of high school. By the age of 26, drugs had become a way of life for Tony; a way of life he wanted to leave but could not. Drugs offered Tony temporary relief from emotional pain of unknown origin, pain he was finding increasingly hard to talk about with his friends and family members, individuals whom he generally saw as supportive. The police asserted that Tony was violent and suicidal when they shot him to death. Based on what we learned about him through Project COPE, what we have learned about Puerto Ricans in Hartford generally through our research over the last 20 years, and what others have reported in the psy- chosocial and anthropological literature on Puerto Ricans, it is possible to construct an alternative interpretation of his state of mind and behavior on the day he was killed. The starting point for developing this alternative understanding lies in the existing literature on the prevalence and pattern- ing of mental health issues among Puerto Ricans. While find- ing that "rates for mental disorders do not differ significantly from those for other [populations]" (Koss-Chioino 1992:92), this literature has consistently reported comparatively high rates of loneliness, demoralization, repressed anger, depres- sion, and somatization among Puerto Ricans (Guarnaccia, Angel, and Worobey 1989; Torres-Matrullo 1976; Canino 1987 et al.). Dohrenwend (1969), for example, found sig- nificantly higher levels of depressive symptoms among Puerto Ricans than African American, Jewish, or Irish study partici- pants of similar economic background. In a community men- tal health assessment of a predominantly Puerto Rican sec- tion of the Fordham/Tremont area in the South Bronx in New York City, Rodriguez (1987) found that Latino participants had significantly elevated rates for poor self-esteem, hope- lessness, helplessness, dread, confused thinking, sadness, and anxiety compared to African American and white participants in the study. Based on his reanalysis of Dohrenwend's data and his own study of Puerto Rican mental health in New York City, Haberman (1976) concluded that there are impor- tant differences between Puerto Ricans and other ethnic groups in modes of expressing emotional distress. In their most acute form, the unique expression of de- pression-like symptoms among Puerto Ricans has been la- beled the "Puerto Rican syndrome" in the psychiatric litera- ture (Berle 1975; Garrison 1997; Rothenberg 1964; Rubio et al. 1955). This term refers to "a sudden partial loss of con- sciousness, accompanied by either clonic or tonic seizures 396 HUMAN ORGANIZATION</page><page sequence="9">and at times by screaming, tearing of clothes, or foaming at the mouth" (Harwood 1981:418), although various other ex- pressions also have been described (Guarnaccia, de la Cancela, and Canillo 1989; Guarnaccia, Good, and Kleinman 1990; Guarnaccia, Rubio-Stipes, and Canino 1989). In Puerto Rican culture, these symptoms commonly are called an ataque de nervios (an attack of the nerves). As Garrison (1997:439) notes, there is general agreement among researchers who have studied ataques that they represent a culturally constituted mechanism for the "discharge of repressed or suppressed anger" and, given the high levels of stress associated with poverty, crowding, and being subjected constantly to social discrimination, that "Puerto Ricans lack sufficient [alterna- tive] opportunities for discharging anxiety or aggressive im- pulses" (Koss-Chioino 1992: 155). Ataques, as well as a broad set of related folk-illness categories, like ansiedad (anxiety), agitamiento (agitation), desasociego (worry or restlessness), bien nerviosa (being very nervous), inquietud (intranquility), and ataques de llanto (crying spells), are fairly common among Puerto Ricans and constitute what Koss-Chioino (1992) refers to as a cultural "nerves-intranquility complex." As contrasted with the common pattern of behavioral expression of depression among non-Puerto Ricans in the U.S., the conditions that comprise this cultural illness com- plex are not necessarily associated with social withdrawal. Rather, among Puerto Ricans "nervousness" in its various expressions tends to be somatized. Somatization refers to bodily complaints in the absence of clinically identified or- ganic pathology. On health-status inventories, Puerto Ricans consistently report a greater number of somatic symptoms than other U.S. ethnic groups (Garrison 1997; Weisenberg 1975). Fatigue and bodily weakness are among the most fre- quent somatic complaints among Puerto Ricans, while head- aches, stomach pains, and heart palpitations are other com- mon somatic complaints. In Koss-Chioino's (1992) view, somatization represents a culturally constituted bodily ex- pression of the daily experience by Puerto Ricans of their inability to control their lives and of the frustration, distress, and anger they feel because of this disempowerment. In other words, somatization can be interpreted as a cul- turally formulated channel through which Puerto Ricans ex- press social distress produced by the experience of colonial- ism, poverty, and discrimination (Singer 1999b), affirming the assertion by Scheper-Hughes and Lock (1987:20) that "to a great extent, talk about the body . . .tends to be talk about the nature of society." In this light, Tony's actions on the day he was killed may have had far less to do with a provoked "police suicide" and far more to do with an explosive ex- pression of frustration over his inability to stop drug use and "get his life together," his fear of going back to prison, and his growing sense of loneliness and inability to express his plight to significant others. While it is impossible to know what Tony intended through his actions when confronted by the police, this interpretation is consistent with the existing literature and our own studies of culturally constituted emo- tional expression among Puerto Ricans. Conclusions In light of the problematic and suggestive nature of some of the answers he provided on his final COPE interview, did the project have a moral responsibility to intervene in Tony's life (and thereby possibly avert his death)? Should the COPE study have had in place a mechanism for quickly spotting depressive symptoms among participants or for asking them about suicidal ideation (and responding accordingly)? Should the project have attempted to help educate the police or other institutions that come into contact with drug users about cul- tural expression of distress in the Puerto Rican community? Should all research projects that work with marginalized, low- income populations of highly at-risk drug users be required to establish a credible system of aggressive, advocated refer- ral into drug treatment and culturally sensitive psychiatric and other medical services for all participants (even for those who do not request such assistance)? These are the kinds of questions that have been raised within our research team since learning of Tony's death. They are questions that have shat- tered a workaday complacency born of over 10 years of re- searcher exposure to the "routine" suffering, self-defeating actions, and repetitive frustrating life patterns of street drug users, as well as equally intense frustrations produced by witnessing a health care system that is often poorly prepared to sensitively treat ethnic minority populations, the disjointed and ill-suited nature of our drug treatment "system," the con- tinued national sport of demonizing (and extensively impris- oning) drug users as the ultimate causes of America's urban problems, and the unnerving realization that it is far easier to get onto than off of drugs in the inner city. To a degree, the nervousness caused by these questions is offset by the realization that the COPE study has allowed our research team to maintain outreach-based AIDS preven- tion for drug users in Hartford for over 10 years. During this period, several thousand drug users have been contacted by research-funded outreach educators, and many have received HIV pre- and post-test counseling, HIV testing, formal pre- vention education and skills building, and referral for treat- ment and other needed health and social services (e.g., approximately 40 drug users were referred into drug treat- ment or other services by our research team during January and February 1999). Proof of the value of these services is seen in the falling rates of infection among drug users in Hartford and the presence of research team members who themselves were respondents in earlier studies by our team (such as the outreach worker who recruited Tony into COPE). Moreover, the COPE study has served as the conceptual launching pad for the development and implementation by our team of a number of nonresearch direct service projects, such as Project CONNECT 2000, a Center for Substance Abuse Treatment-funded bridge-to-treatment intervention initiative, and Project MAPP, a CDC-funded minority pre- vention program for diverse high-risk subgroups. In sum, in the COPE study the human subject cost/benefits ratio (i.e., risks for participants relative to the services and other gains VOL. 59, NO. 4, WINTER 2000 397</page><page sequence="10">they receive) can fairly be said to tip clearly toward benefits side. But is this enough? Given the vulnerable state of our study participants, should we be doing more? Should we be focused on building a morally engaged approach to research that is guided by an ethic of care and responsibility? These are not questions for the COPE study alone. They are ethical questions for all similar studies and research teams across the country. At the same time, they are questions for anthropologists involved in the study of other vulnerable populations. And they are questions for the National Insti- tute on Drug Abuse, the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, the National Institute on Mental Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other pub- lic and private funders of research on out-of-treatment drug users. If it can be made to serve some greater purpose, per- haps Tony's death can help to spark discussion among re- searchers, funders, and policy makers about the full moral responsibilities of researchers who must daily confront the ethical question: Am I my brother's keeper? Notes 1 Ready means are not available to verify or contest the police pre- sentation of the facts in this incident. Drug users, however, regularly report harassment and harsh mistreatment at the hands of police. More- over, Tony's actual state of mind and intentions during the incident are unknown. We proceed in this article "as if' the police interpretation is correct because of the ethical issues it raises for researchers without assuming that there are not alternative interpretations of the events lead- ing to Tony's death. 2The COPE study (consisting of COPE I, COPE II, and COPE III) has been supported by grant #s R18 DA05750, UOl DA07284, and RO 1 DA 11359 from the National Institute on Drug Abuse; Merrill Singer, Principal Investigator.
