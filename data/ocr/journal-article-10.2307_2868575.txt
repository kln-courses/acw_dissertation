To know, and even happily, that we meet unblessed; not in some garden of wax fruit and painted trees, that lie of Eden, but after, after the Fall, after many, many deaths. Is the knowing all?

Arthur Miller, After the Fall w 6HETHER or not The Tempest was chronologically the last of Shakespeare's plays is a debatable and ultimately an ir- relevant question. The Bard's farewell to the London stage before serenely tottering off to Stratford is a cliche requiring little attention; quite obviously, it takes the play for some- thing far slighter than it is. Nevertheless, there is an un- mistakable sense of finality permeating the work. Themes and their variations from throughout the Shakespeare canon seem to draw together here. The characters include a hero more sinned against than sinning, a pair of young and innocent lovers, a guilt-ridden King, a faithful old Counsellor, a machiavel- lian usurper, a swaggering braggart, and a fool-all central character types of the tragedies, histories, and comedies, recapitulated and condensed in this most compact and precisely ordered of Shakespeare's plays. More specifically, The Tempest deals centrally with ideas and concepts of art to a far greater extent than any of the plays before it. All its events and circumstances are either the direct result or the consequence of Prospero's "Art". We have seen a poet and painter discourse on their crafts (which are for sale to the highest bidder) in Timon, the poet Gower has presented Per- icles, and the art of Julio Romano has been a significant factor in the denoue- ment of The Winter's Tale. But here, for the first and last time, the artist is hero and protagonist, and his principal meditations, decisions, and actions are couched in terms of his art. We may well look, then, for implications of some final statement or pronouncement by Shakespeare upon his own art. First, however, we must examine the art of Prospero in detail, evaluating its meaning through the forms it takes, the intentions on which it is founded, and the ends it accomplishes.</page><page sequence="2">172 SHAKESPEARE QUARTERLY The least likely place to begin the investigation of a play is at its end, but the Epilogue of The Tempest offers us, through an unusual and uncon- ventional view of the art of the play as a whole, an illuminating insight into the role of art within the play. Nearly all other Shakespearian epilogues de- clare or assume the termination of the play-world, calling their audiences back to an extra-theatrical norm of reality by requesting applause.' This pat- tern is surprisingly consistent, whether couched in the utilitarian prose of the Dancer in 2 Henry IV or the finely wrought verse of Puck. The most con- cise and representative example is the Epilogue of All's Well That Ends Well, spoken by the King: The King's a beggar, now the play is done. All is well ended if this suit be won, That you express content; which we will pay, With strife to please you, day exceeding day. Ours be your patience then, and yours our parts. Your gentle hands lend us, and take our hearts. The first line dominates those that follow; it leaves no doubt that the play- world's standards of identity and reality have come to an end and bear no relevance to the present situation. The speaker is no longer the King but an actor. The play, its events, and its characters are offered simply as "our parts", objects of artifice for the pleasure and approval of the audience. The Epilogue of The Tempest, however, specifically does away with this perspective, purposefully eliminating any barrier between the play-world and the real: Now my charms are all o'erthrown, And what strength I have's mine own, Which is most faint: now, 'tis true, I must be here confin'd by you, Or sent to Naples. Let me not, Since I have my dukedom got, And pardon'd the deceiver, dwell In this bare island by your spell; But release me from my bands With the help of your good hands: Gentle breath of yours my sails Must fill, or else my project fails, Which was to please. Now I want Spirits to enforce, Art to enchant; And my ending is despair, 1 There are nine epilogues in Shakespeare-eleven if we count Feste's last song in Twelfth Night and Armado's concluding lines, which may or may not be addressed to the audience, in Love's Labour's Lost. The rest are in A Midsummer Night's Dream, 2 Henry IV, As You Like It, Henry V, Troilus and Cressida, All's Well That Ends Well, Pericles, The Tempest, and Henry VIII. At the end of Troilus and Cressida, Pandarus assaults the barrier between the play- world and the real world, speaking directly to the pimps and prostitutes in the audience and bequeathing them his diseases. As in The Tempest, convention is overturned for a specific effect. The effect in this case, however, is only to impress the audience with the fact that parallel forms of degeneracy exist in their world to those depicted in the play. This is a comparison of the two worlds: not the complete interpenetration which occurs in The Tempest.</page><page sequence="3">THIS ROUGH MAGIC I73 Unless I be reliev'd by prayer, Which pierces so, that it assaults Mercy itself, and frees all faults. As you from crimes would pardon'd be, Let your indulgence set me free.2, The opening three lines lead us to expect a conventional declaration by an actor who is only an actor, the "charms" of his art "o'erthrown". Yet such an expectation is deliberately undercut: it is still Prospero who speaks-from the island, not from the stage-and the play has yet to reach a conclusion. More- over, its final event, the impending return to Naples, is charged to the mem- bers of the audience. It is their "spell" (Epilogue. 8) that holds him confined; their hands must release him and their "gentle breath" (Epilogue. ii) supply the "auspicious gales" which he has promised Alonso (V. i. 3I4). In effect, they are invited to enter the play-world and assume a role, through their applause, as a moving force in its culmination. This is not simply a metaphoric request for applause; without such par- ticipation by the audience, Prospero's "project fails" (Epilogue. i2)-that same project we have watched evolve through the play and "gather to a head" (V.i.-i) in the fifth act. An appeal for applause is thus delivered, but it is spoken from within the play; while in previous epilogues the speaker stepped out of his dramatic context to address the audience in its own sphere of reality, Prospero brings the audience into the play. Here and here alone in Shakespeare, the play's art has no terminal boundaries but rather subsumes the "real", extra-theatrical world of its spectators, supplanting their sense of reality with its own. What is the nature of this art, powerful enough to encompass the play's audience, and what is the "project" in which their participation is ultimately required? We shall return to the full significance of the Epilogue later; but meanwhile, on the most immediate level, we know Prospero's art to be that of a formidable magician-a demiurge, in effect, since he can control and order all the elements to the extent of raising a storm which splits a vessel and shipwrecks its passengers without "so much perdition as an hair/ Betid" (I. ii. 30-3) to them or to the ship itself. Miranda associates his abilities with a "god of power" (io); and indeed, his "so potent Art" (V.i.50) seems almost blas. phemously close to godhead when he recalls rifting "Jove's stout oak/ With his own bolt" (45-46) and even raising the dead. Yet these are not powers naturally accruing to him; they were gained by years of seclusion and study (which cost him his dukedom), and they are embodied not in Prospero him- self but in such objects as his books, his staff, and his magic garment. With- out his books, says Caliban, "He's but a sot, as I am" (III.ii.I9). Prospero himself perceives this separation of his artistic function from his identity as a man to the extent that he can, in putting off his garment, say, "Lie there, my Art" (I. ii. 25). A more specific dimension of his art is its consistent preoccupation with mimesis, particularly mimesis of a dramatic kind. Even the storm was a "spectacle" (I. ii. 26): it was "Perform'd to point" (194) by Ariel, and all 2 All references from The Tempest are to the new Arden edition, Frank Kermode, ed. (London, 1954).</page><page sequence="4">I74 SHAKESPEARE QUARTERLY its lightnings and thunderclaps were in fact only semblances, as they did no harm. (One is reminded of W. B. Yeats's ultimate image of art in "Byzan- tium": "An agony of flame that cannot singe a sleeve.")3 His subject spirits are never what they seem, but continually assuming roles and guises. Ariel plays a seanymph and a harpy, and his lesser cohorts appear variously in "urchin-shows" (II. ii. 5) as apes, hedgehogs, adders, and hunting dogs. Ariel, in fact, offers Prospero the services of himself and "all his quality" (I. ii. i93); we recall that contemporary actors referred to their profession as "the Qual- ity".4 Prospero's remarks, after the banquet has been removed from before the Court party, might well be those of a director or stage manager congratulating his performers on a job well done: Bravely the figure of this Harpy has thou Perform'd, my Ariel; a grace it had devouring: Of my instruction hast thou nothing bated, In what thou hadst to say: so, with good life And observation strange, my meaner ministers Their several kinds have done. (III. iii. 83-88) Finally, the masque presented in the fourth act is overtly an exercise of dra- matic art. It is evident, therefore, that a considerable portion of Prospero's art involves the dramatic medium. We should, however, be careful to avoid any immediate identification of Prospero with Shakespeare, or even with the playwright in general. For Prospero is not a mere representative figure or allegorical cipher; he is a fully rounded character and, potentially, a tragic protagonist. As such, he is representative only in the broad sense that Lear and Hamlet are. To understand his full significance we must focus our at- tention on the terms of the play itself before inferring any outside implica- tions. Prospero is a magician as well as a dramatist-both are facets of the same "Art" -and a man as well as an artist. II What, then, are the ends toward which he employs his art; what, in other words, is the substance of his "project"? We can begin with his relationship to Caliban, who, while the most "monstrous" character of the play, is in effect the lowest common denominator of all its characters-indeed, of all human- ity. He is the amoral, appetitive, suffering Self in all of us, ever in search of freedom to satisfy all its hungers-visceral, sexual, and emotional-and ever ready to follow any "god" who promises such freedom. Prospero's general method of dealing with this essence of fallen man is to check his degeneracy with verbal chastisement and physical pain-the "urchin-shows" of apes and adders-and to draw him up toward a state of fulfillment and moral regen- eration. He teaches him how "To name the bigger light, and how the less" 3 The Collected Poems (New York, I956), p. 244. 4 Henry Chettle, for instance, in his Kind-Harts Dream, terms Shakespeare "exelent in the qualitie he professes" (quoted in E. K. Chambers, William Shakespeare [Oxford, 1930], I, 58). See also Sir Thomas More, IV. i. 356, in C. F. Tucker Brooke, ed., The Shakespeare Apocrypha (Oxford, 1908).</page><page sequence="5">THIS ROUGH MAGIC I75 (I. ii. 337), and, through Miranda, how to speak. Moreover, besides specifi- cally indicating the path to reformation, he shows him visions of some in- distinct, heavenly ideal to spur him on further: and then, in dreaming, The clouds methought would open, and show riches Ready to drop upon me.5 Oll. ii. 138-140) Thus Prospero has employed his art to expose and chastise Caliban's faults, lead him to goodness, and depict images of what he should be. This specifically moral function is the basic pattern of almost all his artistic endeavors. He ship- wrecks the Court party with the specific intention of subjecting Alonso, Antonio, and Sebastian to an ordeal of self-knowledge and purgation through the performance of his spirits. Ariel confronts them point-blank with their guilts-"You are three men of sin"-and leaves them with only two alterna- tives for the future: "Ling'ring perdition" or "heart-sorrow/ And a clear life ensuing" (III. iii. 53, 77, 8i-82). Ferdinand, too, undergoes a separate, punishing trial to rid him of his own "Caliban" qualities and to purify his love. Again, the ordeal culminates in a mimetic vision of the ideal which Prospero intends for him to assume: the masque of chastity. Prospero's project, then, is no less than to purge the evil from the inhabi- tants of his world and restore them to goodness. Thus his relation to the rest of the characters-manipulating their lives, judging their flaws, and setting standards of goodness for them-is, again, close to godhead. Through Ariel he equates himself with the "Destiny,/ That hath to instrument this lower world/ And what is in't" (III. iii 53-55); and Ferdinand, in the presence of "So rare a wonder'd father and a wise" (IV i. I23), thinks himself in Paradise. Such overt and implied resemblances have led some critics into mistaking Prospero for a figuration of God the Father. But it is precisely this assumption of god-like powers and responsibilities by one who is in no way superhuman that precipi- tates the central problem of the play. Prospero's artistic powers, being capable of great evil as well as great good, place him in a perilous position. The line between theurgy and necromancy could be thin at times, and the mage could easily cross it unawares. We need only remind ourselves that "prospers" is the Italian for "faustus". In order to fulfill the responsibilities he has assumed- before he can presume to influence others with his art-it is imperative that Prospero himself have a comprehensive and flawless moral vision of his world. He must perceive not only what is evil in men and what, ideally, they should be, but also what men are, and what relationship he, as a man, bears toward them. Without such a clarity of vision, the exercise of his art may result in corruption for himself and chaos for those around him. III Our first insight into the moral vision on which his art is based emerges through his own narration (I. ii) of his first contact with evil in the world. 5 Such visions are, of course, seen "in dreaming", but since Caliban has been put to sleep by "twangling instruments" and voices, it is reasonable to suppose that, like the sleeping courtiers in II. i, he is under the influence of Prospero.</page><page sequence="6">i76 SHAKESPEARE QUARTERLY We learn that, in the course of the "secret studies" (77) through which his art was acquired, he "grew stranger" (76) to his dukedom: rejected the everyday realities of statecraft for the ideal realm in his books. Being totally unaware or unsuspecting of the temptations of worldly power, he left the manage of his state to his brother, assuming that, since he reposed in Antonio an absolute love and a "confidence sans bound" (97), his love and confidence would naturally be returned. Instead, however, it "Awak'd an evil nature" (93), the throne was seized, and Prospero was cast away. His reaction to this eruption of evil is marked not simply by bitterness but by a pronounced incredulity "That a brother should/ Be so perfidious!" (67-68). He was, and is still, unable to con- ceive of the contradiction between what a brother should be and what his brother was. Similarly, he cannot accept the fact that his own officers supported the usurper: that any evil could exist in the world as he knew it without being "new created/ ... or chang'd . . / Or else new form'd" (8i-83). But primarily his amazement centers on the fact that his brother should have acted contrary to all logical and ideal norms of brotherhood-that his own kind could return hate where love was owed. The lapse of time has brought him no new understanding of this. He cannot even cope with its memory, and the increasing frustration of his failure to do so emerges in his irrational, peevish demands that his daughter attend him. He ignores Miranda's simple but overwhelming bit of realism: I should sin To think but nobly of my grandmother: Good wombs have born bad sons. ( I I 8-I20) Such an acknowledgement of evil as part of the natural condition of man is unacceptable to Prospero. His years of seclusion in his library have instilled in him a moral perspective rooted not in the real world but in the ideals of his art. Significantly, he still prizes his volumes above his dukedom (i68), and insists on judging the real world by their rigid moral absolutes. If his brother acted contrary to the ideal of a brother, then his brother was not a brother but some alien, inhuman thing of evil, to be dealt with as an enemy. In short, he rejects the sinner with the sin. The dangerous short-sightedness of this view is self-evident, and it is further revealed in the history of his relationship to Caliban. Initially recogniz- ing Caliban as a human creature, he accepted him totally and afforded him all the "human care" (348) ideally due to a fellow being. He trusted him, like Antonio, sans bound, giving him the run of his cell and the unguarded com- pany of his daughter, without a thought of any evil he might do. Then, when the inevitable assault (Caliban being Caliban) occurred, he relegated Caliban to the status of an entirely inhuman creature, unable to connect his evil with any species but that of a devil-begotten, "poisonous slave" (32I), an "earth" (3i6), a "filth" who deserved "stripes . . ., not kindness" (347). As he over- looks Miranda's explanation of Antonio's evil-that good wombs have born bad sons-he misses the full implications of his own comparison of Ferdinand to Caliban (483): that Caliban's evil is an essentially human characteristic. There is a Caliban in the best of men; his presence and even his birthright</page><page sequence="7">THIS ROUGH MAGIC I77 must be recognized if he is to be effectively dealt with; for if left to run entirely at large he will inevitably perpetrate evil, and if disowned and repressed he will prove a greater threat by rebelling outright. Of course, Prospero has not, at this point in the play, permanently dis- owned his affinity with either Antonio or Caliban. His ultimate intention, as his arrangement of the love between Ferdinand and Miranda indicates, is to reunite himself with all his enemies and so restore a harmony and order to his world in which, presumably, Antonio and Caliban will have their places. First, however, that world must be altered by his art to fit the letter of his moral vision. Alonso, Sebastian, and Antonio must all either assume a clear life or suffer lingering perdition; there is no middle ground. His faulty moral perception will not permit him to acknowledge as natural and human any being with the least taint of evil; he will accept nothing short of a world where all brothers are entirely trustworthy and all monsters entirely harmless: a prospect similar in scope and impossibility to Gonzalo's island commonwealth (II. i. I39- i6o). But Gonzalo never mistakes his vision for more than a utopian reverie. Prospero, on the other hand, intends to eliminate, by force if necessary, all elements of humanity which will not conform to his vision. Here, then, is the central and potentially tragic flaw in Prospero's awareness. He has, in a very real sense, confused his role as an artist with that of a god, forgetting his humanity in the process. In presuming to substitute his own sense of morality for cosmic law he has designated to himself a higher order of being and the authority to damn and destroy his fellow men: in effect, he has usurped the divine prerogative of vengeance. Thus his project is threatened with failure on two counts. His artistic ideal of a perfect world, given the nature of post-Lapsarian humanity, can never be realized. Meanwhile he is in constant danger of mistaking his own passionate resentment of the wrongs he has suffered for righteous indignation, thereby perverting his own goodness and wreaking havoc on those over whom he has power. This element of vindictive- ness and vengeful passion is never far from him, and it threatens constantly to overwhelm the nobler ends of his project. It accounts for the hint of sadistic relish with which he devises and threatens new forms of punishment for Caliban, and it is even more evident in his reactions to the ordeal of the Court party in the third act. He derives an obvious pleasure from their "dis- tractions" and rejoices not so much that his art has attained its end, in showing them their evil, as simply that they are now in his power. He still refers to them, significantly, as "mine enemies", and clearly has no intention yet of terminating their "fits" (III. iii. 88-93). IV Ferdinand is the one character whose moral regeneration Prospero under- takes without the danger of giving way to motives of revenge, not only be- cause Ferdinand has never wronged him, but also because he comes closest, with Miranda, to fulfilling Prospero's standard of goodness. Through the innate innocence and nobility of his nature he responds ideally to nurture, and in the betrothal of Ferdinand and Miranda Prospero sees the first concrete realization of the moral order he intends to impose on his world. He is, of</page><page sequence="8">178 SHAKESPEARE QUARTERLY course, overlooking the obvious fact that these are, even within the terms of the play, two remarkably good young people, and their goodness can hardly be established as a norm of humanity in general. Nevertheless he celebrates their union with a masque which, besides depicting the specific ideal of chastity he wishes to impress on them, constitutes an ultimate mimetic image of the world he means to forge through his art. As such, it is worth close considera- tion. The playlet centers on Iris, Ceres, and Juno, anthropomorphic embodiments of a nature which substantiates and rewards the human values of Prospero's moral system: theirs is a world from which all that is less than flawless, let alone evil, is rigidly exorcised. But the goddesses are being played by spirits who are, in fact, elemental creatures of nature-the real nature surrounding Prospero-and they are compelled, possibly against their wills, to enact a natural order which is not their own, but Prospero's "pathetic fallacy".6 Moreover, the chief details in Iris' opening description of the masque's landscape include "cold nymphs", "dismissed" and "lass-lorn" bachelors, vineyards which bear no fruit but are "pole-clipt", and a "sea-marge" that is "sterile and rocky-hard" (IV. i. 60-70). This is a world not simply ordered and controlled but gelded of all that is spontaneous and primal, leaving only that which is cold, hard, and sterile. The culminating dance of nymphs and reapers brings to mind a similar pastoral vision, the sheep-shearing scene of The Winter's Tale (IV. iv.). There, however, we had the earthly, mildly ribald merriment of the Clown and his two girl-friends, along with a dance of satyrs. But none dance in Prospero's pastoral that are not "properly habited" (IV. i. i38: stage direc- tion). Clearly, this vision fragments and distorts the realities of human experience. Venus and Cupid have been denied their rightful place in the pantheon, and the generative, sexual impulse they represent is strictly expelled from the world of the masque. Under such circumstances, the goddesses' invocations of "Earth's increase" and "foison plenty" (iio) seem as unlikely as that "Nature should bring forth,/ Of its own kind all foison, all abundance" (II. i. I58-I59) on Gonzalo's island. There is no fertility or natural regeneration where the nymphs are cold and the bachelors lass-lorn. Ceres' "rich leas" are nullified by her pole-clipped vineyard and sterile sea-marge. Like Gonzalo's plantation, the "latter end" of Prospero's commonwealth "forgets the begin- ning" (II. i. I53-I54). The entire masque, then, is overtly artificial and calculatedly unconvincing: a "'vanity" (41) of his art in a far more serious sense than he means the term. As such, it points up the basic flaw in his artistic and moral perspectives. His moral system is clearly at odds with human reality, and the artistic embodiment of that system, therefore, has no viable connection with reality. Not that the specific moral ideal set forth in the masque, premarital chastity, is in itself fallacious, but Prospero has set himself a greater goal than the depiction of an ideal. He means his art to encompass and directly influence reality. In his remarks to Ferdinand and Miranda (IV. i. I3-23) he draws no distinction be- 6 Caliban claims that Prospero's spirits "all do hate him/ As rootedly as I" (III. ii. 92-93); and the fact that Ariel, the most faithful and loving of them, comes close to open rebellion in the first act, indicates that there is at least some truth to this.</page><page sequence="9">THIS ROUGH MAGIC 179 tween the order of the masque's world and that of the world outside it. On these terms, as a comprehensive image of the real world, the masque is bound to fail. Since it ignores the realities of post-Lapsarian existence, it is incapable, as art, of comprehending or coping with the propensity for evil in fallen man. The events of the play rapidly make this as clear to Prospero as it is to us. The wide disparity between the play-world of his art and the real world he inhabits is immediately revealed by an abrupt intrusion of extra-theatrical reality; the morally precise nature of Ceres, Juno, and Iris is belied by the approach of true naturals, Caliban, Stephano, and Trinculo, bent on rape and murder. His art-work cannot co-exist with such reality, but "heavily" vanishes "to a strange, hollow, and confused noise". Patently, his art has failed to come to terms with the nature of things as they are. Perceiving this, Prospero addresses Ferdinand in what amounts to an epilogue: the "Our revels now are ended" speech (148-I58). It is unfortunate that this passage, out of its context, has come to be misinterpreted as the central statement of The Tempest. In fact, it amounts to a bitter testament of nihilistic despair on Prospero's part, antithetical to the sense of affirmation the play ultimately achieves. It begins, as do the other epilogues in Shakespeare (and as the epilogue at the end of this play does not) by acknowledging the termina- tion of the masque's play-world; it is an "insubstantial pageant" with a "base- less fabric". But-- Prospero goes on to imply that since his art-work has proved baseless, so any attempt to order reality through art must ultimately fail, since reality itself is only a fading illusion. Thus, while he has recognized the failure of his art, he has not yet discovered the cause of this failure: the flawed moral perspective on- which his art is based. His vision is still as disastrously short-sighted as it was in his initial confrontations with Antonio and Caliban. Since reality will not conform to his concept of reality, he assumes that reality is unreal; that all the world and all humanity amount to no more than a flawed image which will fade into ultimate sleep-ultimate nothingness. Retaining his serious misconception of himself as god rather than man, he assumes the right to condemn as unregenerate and destroy all that will not fit his moral code: A devil, a born devil, on whose nature Nurture can never stick; on whom my pains, Humanely taken, all, all lost, quite lost; ... I will plague them all, Even to roaring. (IV. i. i88-i90, I92-I93) Caliban is not a devil-thoroughly evil and unredeemable-but a type of humanity.7 Prospero has earlier denied the humanity of the Court party in the same way, calling them "worse than devils" (III. iii. 36), and it is no coincidence that Stephano and Trinculo initially revealed their distorted perceptions by mistaking each other for devils (II. ii. go, 99). Prospero is t Prospero, of course, claims that Caliban was "got by the devil himself" (I. ii. 321), but there is no concrete proof of this. Caliban, who makes frequent references to his mother and her god, never mentions an infernal father. In any case, his qualities as a character are clearly not satanic but human. He is disposed toward evil, but only in the sense that man, at his worst, is so disposed. He never consciously chooses evil-as do Shakespeare's more authentic demi-devils, Iago and Richard of Gloucester-but constantly mistakes it for good: he sees Stephano as a god and anarchy as freedom.</page><page sequence="10">i8o SHAKESPEARE QUARTERLY committing the same error in a far graver sense: despairing in the nurture of Caliban, he despairs of the redemption of the low nature in all men; and, turning from despair to rage and vengeance, he resolves to "plague them all", to strike out at all whose evil qualities have frustrated him. As he summons hounds named "Fury" and "Tyrant" (IV. i. 257), revelling in the pain of the clowns and exulting in the fact that "At this hour/ Lies at my mercy all mine enemies" (262-263), his spirits become his "goblins" (258), and he himself threatens to become a satanic personification of revenge. Tragic chaos impends. Disaster is averted, however, by the action of Ariel, who intervenes not as a deus ex machina but as an advocate on behalf of Prospero's own "nobler reason" (V. i. 26). The climactic crisis of the play passes in less than fifteen lines, as Prospero undergoes a brief but intensely meaningful psychomachy. Having described the whereabouts and miseries of the Court party (and it was after a similar description of Caliban and his confederates that Prospero called up Fury and Tyrant), Ariel checks the momentum of Prospero's passion by charging him with the central moral obligation he has hitherto ignored in his artistry: Your charm so strongly works 'em, That if you now beheld them, your affections Would become tender. Pros. Dost thou think so, spirit? Ari. Mine would, sir, were I human. Pros. And mine shall. (07-20) Good or evil, flawed or perfect, they are human-as he is-and on this basis alone he is bound to commiserate with them, to forgive them, and ultimately to accept them: Hast thou, which art but air, a touch, a feeling Of their afflictions, and shall not myself, One of their kind, that relish all as sharply Passion as they, be kindlier mov'd than thou art? Though with their high wrongs I am struck to th'quick, Yet with my nobler reason 'gainst my fury Do I take part: the rarer action is In virtue than in vengeance. (2I-28) As an artist, he must limit his ends to the revelation of truth and self-knowl- edge; as a man, he can presume no further: they being penitent, The sole drift of my purpose doth extend Not a frown further.... they shall be themselves. (28-30, 32) His moral vision is completed with the discovery and acceptance of this one truth: the overriding necessity for recognition and acceptance of one's own kind-in short, for love. This has been the element missing in his art: the flaw which rendered the masque of the goddesses inadequate. Only through un-</page><page sequence="11">THIS ROUGH MAGIC i8i conditional forgiveness and acceptance of human nature, after all that can be done to reform it, can an art be capable of comprehending and dealing with the realities, good and evil, of the world. Prospero, then, finds himself as an artist as well as a man. What he rejects in the "elves of hills" speech (33-57) is not his art in toto, but his "rough magic" (50): that aspect of his art by which he presumed to! rise to a Jove-like stature over other men, refusing to forgive them or accept their kinship as fellow beings until he had made them over in the image of his own faulty moral perspective. In drowning his book he does away not with the essence of his art but with that same volume that he has prized above his dukedom-above the society of his fellows: his blind absorp- tion in the ideal to the exclusion of the real and the human. Far from the end of his artistic powers, this marks the point at which his art truly begins to function effectively. The ultimate end of his artistic project, the restoration of order and har- mony to the real world, starts to materialize as he frees and formally forgives each of his enemies. The simple act of forgiveness might seem too pat a solution of the play's central problem if its difficulty were not made absolutely clear. As Prospero's confrontation with the evil in human nature was first represented by his alienation from his brother, his acceptance of that nature is affirmed in Antonio's pardoning: Flesh and blood, You, brother mine, . . . ... I do forgive thee, Unnatural though thou art. (74-75, 78-79) The words come haltingly. Prospero must force himself to forgive by sheer strength of will, repeating his pardon twice during the scene as if to convince himself, and emphasizing each time his detestation of the "unnatural" evil he accepts as "flesh and blood". Having done so, however, he can proceed toward the completion of his project by presenting his most successful single art-work: an image of moral perfection that is at once ideal and real. With a gesture of dramatic art, he draws aside the curtain to reveal Ferdinand and Miranda. Thus order is restored to the world of the play. Prospero regains his duke- dom, the reformed Alonso finds his son, and the perpetuation of order is insured by the betrothal of the lovers. But Prospero is now too wise to trust wholly in a "brave new world" (183). He is aware that the preservation of order will continue to require the forgiveness of evil, and he affirms this on a broadly representative scale by reacknowledging his responsibility for, and even kinship with Caliban: "this thing of darkness I/ Acknowledge mine" (275-276). And even here, at the lowest level of human nature, forgiveness sparks hope as Caliban resolves to "be wise hereafter/ And seek for grace" (294-295). Antonio, of course, remains ominously silent, but it is the very presence of his unreformed evil that underlines the triumphant order which has been achieved in its spite. Each other character has found himself through Prospero's art "When no man was his own" (2I3), and Prospero himself is no exception: his has been the last and greatest self-discovery.</page><page sequence="12">i82 SHAKESPEARE QUARTERLY V The play, as we have seen, does not end here, and Prospero's project is as yet incomplete. The artistic and moral vision of the masque was invalidated by its irrelevance to the outside world, proved by the violent non-correspond- ence of the three rebels to the three goddesses. By the same token, the ultimate ratification of the vision which Prospero has discovered and Shakespeare developed-for certainly Shakespeare speaks with Prospero at this point- must come from outside the world of The Tempest. The art of Shakespeare as well as of Prospero will prove a vanity unless the audience assumes its validity by participating in a cognate act of the love and recognition which are the essence of that art. In the Epilogue, then, Prospero brings the spectators into the play in order to place them in circumstances exactly parallel to the moment of his own climactic decision, charging them with the same responsibility. As Ariel reminded him that the courtiers were "Confin'd together" and could not budge "till your release" (V. i. 7, ii), so Prospero must be "confin'd" until the spectators "release" him (Epilogue.4,9). As he has "pardon'd the deceiver" (7), they must set him free by their "indulgence" (20). The Epilogue thus serves as a bridge between play and audience: a transi- tional link between art and reality. By the use of overtly religious terms such as "prayer", "Mercy", and "indulgence" in the last five lines, Shakespeare links his artistic vision with the orthodox principle of Christian charity. If his audience will make his vision their own-and it is an unprecedented testament of faith in his art that he terms its success dependent on such total acceptance- they will be participating in an act of prayer, which will bring down mercy and redemption on both the prayer and the prayed-for. Thus he endows his play's vision of love with the universal validity associated by his contemporary audience with the theological framework of their cosmos. His art passes beyond the moral spectrum of his play and merges with that of the world surrounding it, as Prospero, Shakespeare, and the audience unite in a recognition, accept- ance, and celebration of their shared humanity.
