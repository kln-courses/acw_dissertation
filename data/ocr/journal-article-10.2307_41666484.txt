<plain_text><page sequence="1">Examples of Chilean Diaguite ware. In the northern part of Chile, in the provinces of Atacama and Coquimbo, there lived in prehistoric times an interesting Andean people who long before their conquest by the Incas decorated their pottery with geo- metric designs. These Indians were farmers who also hunted and fished. They inhabited the fertile transverse valleys of these provinces as well as the long coastal strip. Their culture has been called "Chilean Diaguite" - possibly without good reason, since it was considerably different from that of the true Diaguite of Argentina. These people had probably lived in this area since be- fore A.D. 1000. No exact chronology has yet been evolved, and the chronologies of Max Uhle and Latcham have now lost their value as a result of more recent in- vestigations, especially the Carbon 14 process; this tech- nique has already made possible a new classification of some Andean cultures and will probably change earlier concepts regarding them. In their oldest cemeteries we find these people al- ready using pottery decorated in three colors. The ceramic ware consists of deep, semi-globular bowls; the quite primitive designs are generally found in the interior of the vessel. We have termed this earliest known pottery "Archaic." Later the ware evolved further, and new elements appeared in the decoration, elements that we ascribe to the "Chinchas," who also influenced the Ata- cama peoples to the north; this new ceramic phase we call "Transitional." The design elements of this period were the precursors of the beautiful and harmonious decoration which appears later, in the "Classic" stage, and makes this pottery outstanding among the ceramics of South America. The new elements which appeared in the Transitional period were at first very rudely drawn, but slowly they were perfected and made more precise, until they achieved technical refinement and true classicism. Later on, some fifty to seventy years before the arrival of the Spaniards, these Indians were subjugated by the Incas, and their pottery exposed to Peruvian influence. But for present purposes we shall ignore this stage of de- velopment and confine ourselves to the elements that appear in the preceding Classic period. Almost all the examples shown are from the collections assembled in the Archaeological Museum of La Serena. EARLY INDIAN AH 26</page><page sequence="2">F NORTHERN CHILE By FRANCISCO L. CORNEL Y Director of the Archaeological Museum of La Serena, Chile The decoration of the Chilean Diaguite is based on a few fundamental motifs, such as triangles, hooks, maean- ders, steps, etc. Placed in rows and arranged in rectangles on a white background, these motifs are composed into designs adapted to the shape of the vessel. White, black and red are the colors used. Red is generally the back- ground color of the vessel itself, inside and out. The area to be decorated was painted white and bordered by a thick black line; on this white ground the design was painted in black and red. In the latest period the inside of the vessel was also frequently whitened. In the decoration of these vessels there is generally twice or three times as much black as red. A good ex- ample is the bowl shown at lower left, which bears a pattern of parallel stepped horizontal lines. The first line is red; the second, third and fourth are black; the fifth is again red, and thus it continues, the colors alter- nating in this way in order to avoid monotony. In the same vessel we see that the horizontal lines are broken by steps at regular intervals, and that in each successive line the steps project a little farther than in the one be- fore, thus producing a diagonal ladder effect, an impres- sion consciously sought by the artist. The same diagonal effect is produced by other designs in which the rows are carefully placed, not one exactly below another but each succeeding row a little farther forward or back. It seems likely that this art developed quite rapidly, owing especially to the comfortable life enjoyed by the people who produced it. The tribes dwelling along the coast lived mainly on seafood - to which they may have owed their excellent teeth - and the climate allowed them to fish and to gather shellfish throughout the year. They also seem to have carried on trade with the in- terior. The people of the valleys cultivated corn and other food plants and they also owned a good many llamas. One of the Spanish historians recorded the fact that each Indian had thirty to fifty of these animals ; after the conquest by the meat-eating Spaniards this number was rapidly reduced, so that in two or three years each native had only a few animals. The fact that the people had little difficulty in secur- ing their daily food must have had great influence on the development of their art. In the Classic epoch new forms and even a new style appeared, an example of 27</page><page sequence="3">which is shown at the lower right on page 27. In this period appear the anthropomorphic bowls which have a face in front, and on both sides of the face various designs executed with great care. Some of these vases are illustrated above. The "duck jars," made in the form of swimming ducks, also belong to this period. Around the human head which takes the place of the duck's head (see example at bottom left) there are always two or three design elements chosen and executed with great care. These vases are rare - choice pieces which may have belonged to officials or priests. The so-called urns are rather rare, and it seems that they were not used 28</page><page sequence="4">EARLY INDIAN ART continued for burial purposes but rather as containers for chicha (the native beer) and employed at fiestas and funerals; afterwards they were generally intentionally destroyed and placed in the graves. Decorated jugs, such as those at the top of this page, are rare. There is also another kind of vessel, generally zoomorphic, which we consider to be of totemic signif- icance (see above, right) . All this pottery seems to have been intended for ceremonial purposes, that is, to have been used only on certain solemn occasions or at funerals. In daily life the people used ordinary pottery, grayish black and unpol- ished, which is generally found stained by contact with fire. This pottery is often decorated with plastic addi- tions such as those shown on the vessel above at the left. Generally they are applied to the necks of small pitchers which have a handle at the back, while the front part, the container itself, is considerably extended, giving the pitcher a characteristic form something like a shoe. The decoration often includes all the front part of the vessel. The applied relief elements are mostly anthropomorphic in character; more rarely zoomorphic decoration is used. With the arrival of the Incas, about 1475, came new outside influence. But that is another story. 29</page></plain_text>
