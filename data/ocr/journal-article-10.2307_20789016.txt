Scherbenske 140 Arbordale Avenue, Rochester, NY14610-1414, USA scherben @email. une. edu Abstract According to early Christian heresiologists, the Antitheses articulated Marcion's funda mental convictions based on the separation of the God of the Hebrew Bible from the God of the Christ. While scholars have long stressed the importance of this separation for Marcion's theology, the genre of the Antitheses, the primary vehicle for this belief, remains problematic. This article proposes that Marcion's Antitheses ought to be cate gorized as isagogic, a genre utilized primarily for preliminary instruction. A survey of the salient characteristics of isagogic texts reveals that in form, content, audience, and function, the Antitheses (as described by Marcion's opponents) align nicely with this genre. Identifying the Antitheses as an isagogic text offers insight into Marcion's com position and deployment of this work for his evangelic campaign; by leading the reader into a Marcionite interpretation of the scriptures, the Antitheses fostered the catecheti cal indoctrination and continual growth in the rudiments of his faith. Keywords Marcion, Antitheses, isagogic, introduction, interpretation Introduction Alongside editions of the Gospel of Luke and Paul's letters, the Antitheses represent one of Marcion's few known writings.1 Marcion's distinction between the Hebrew Bible and his scriptures, articulated in the Antitheses, compelled proto-orthodox and heterodox Christians alike to define more precisely their own understandings of Christianity and the role of the Hebrew Bible in this nascent faith.2 Despite the Antitheses importance in 1} Tertullian also refers to a letter allegedly composed by Marcion; see discussion below. 2) In addition to proto-orthodox responses to Marcion by heresiologists such as Irenaeus, Tertullian, Hippolytus, Epiphanius, and others, in his Letter to Flora the Valentinian Ptolemy {Flor., 3.2 [SC 24 46]) explicitly defined his understanding of the origin of the law ?

On the one hand, we must rely on their testimony for any reconstruction of Marcion's texts and thought; on the other hand, the evidence must be read circumspectly against the grain of their blatant heresiological agenda. This raises the questions: why should we trust heresiological reports about Marcion on some scores but not on others? And can we legitimately use their evidence yet read it against the grain with the result that we both accept and reject it simultaneously? The key question</page><page sequence="3">Marcions Antitheses and the Isagogic Genre 257 entitled the Antitheses because in it Marcion juxtaposed what he viewed as antithetical statements from the Hebrew scriptures and his NT collection.5 According to Tertullian, the Antitheses often deliberately set these state ments in contrast so as to demonstrate the incompatibility of the God of the Hebrew Bible and the God who sent the Christ: e.g. Marcion purport edly rejected the ius talionis by juxtaposing it with Jesus' injunction to "turn the other cheek."6 In Marcion's understanding, such statements were mutually exclusive and pointed to a conflict in laws, thus demonstrating Jesus' rejection of the law found in the Hebrew Bible. In addition to Tertullian's description of Marcion's writings as antitheses or a dosj our other earliest descriptions range from Irenaeus's scriptis? to Epiphanius's a a a,9 and an anonymous early Syriac writer preserved in Arme nian, who refers to Marcion's work as a proevangelium}^ in my opinion is: cui bono? Insofar as Tertullian, Epiphanius, and others achieve their objectives 1) to slander Marcion, his teachings, and his texts and 2) to wrest control of the scriptures from him, we must be highly suspicious of the veracity of their calumny. Con versely, when these heresiological writers concede arguments which make their defense more difficult or which they must go out of their way to refute, we are justified in judging that these are likely authentic. Additionally, independent testimony regarding Marcionite texts and doctrine will augment our confidence in their reports. 5) The following are Tertullian s references to Antitheses or antithesis from his treatise Adver sus Marcionem: Marc. 1.19:314,25; 11.28:374,25; 11.29:377,4; 11.29:375,28; 11.29:376,4, 19,23,27; IV.23:497,23; IV.1:423,2,5; IV. 1:425,17,23; IV. 1:426,1; IV.2:426,3; IV.4:429, 18,22; IV.6:432,15; IV.9:440,20; IV.23:497,23; IV.24:499,25; IV.24:500,22; IV.35:542,13; IV.36:547,3,4,11.

W. Scherbenske I Vigiliae Christianae 64 (2010) 255-279 Despite our knowledge of Marcion's Antitheses, one issue that remains problematic is this text's genre. One particularly promising explanation was already tendered in the early twentieth century by Adolf von Harnack: he hypothesized that Marcion's Antitheses had great authority in Marcion ite communities as a "symbolisches Buch" and provided a firm foundation for interpreting Marcion's Gospel and Apostolikon, which from the begin ning must have been companion tracts.11 Additionally, Harnack thought that the description of the Antitheses as a proevangelium could indicate that this work could have been an introduction to the gospel.12 I think that Harnack was on precisely the right track in identifying an introductory role for the Antitheses. In this article I propose that Marcion's Antitheses indeed functioned as an introductory tract, one that likely conformed to the ancient isagogic genre. Specifically, I argue that descriptions of the Antitheses form, content, targeted audience, and function are consis tent with the isagogic genre, a well-known genre in antiquity specifically designed for guiding neophytes into a discipline and for reinforcing the essentials of such knowledge in those already initiated. I argue that, as a direct corollary to the Antitheses function as an isagogic text, this introduc tion was fashioned to guide readers into the proper reading of Marcion's edition of the Gospel and Apostolikon. Ascertaining the genre of the Anti theses can yield important insights into Marcion's foundational work: by utilizing established conventions of isagogic texts in order to lay out and transmit his theological goals, Marcion implicitly conveyed his under standing of the Antitheses purpose and how he imagined they would be received by those (most likely neophytes, catechumens, and fellow adher ents to Marcion's interpretation of Christianity) encountering them. Thus the Antitheses were isagogically fashioned so that readers might learn to interpret the Hebrew Bible and Marcion's canon correctly even before their first reading; such instruction would continue to guide them through their um jene Zeit offenbar wurde, [n?mlich] zur Zeit des Pilatus des Pontiers, in jener Zeit, in der das Evangelium geschreiben wurde" (Joseph Sch?fers, Eine altsyrische antimarkionitische Erkl?rung von Parabeln des Herrn und zwei andere altsyrische Abhandlungen zu Texten des Evangeliums.

My argument unfolds as follows. After briefly discussing previous hypoth eses concerning the genre of the Antitheses, I detail the characteristics and features of the isagogic genre. Subsequently, I argue that in terms of for mat, content, and targeted audience the Antitheses aligned with the isa gogic genre; as such it was a text fashioned to guide readers pedagogically into the tenets of Marcion's theology. The Genre of the Antitheses While some scholars have attempted to categorize Marcions foundational work, the Antitheses genre remains problematic.13 Harnack noted similar works such as Apelles' and Tatian's ? a a and drew attention to Tertullian's enigmatic references to an epistle.14 More recently, David Dungan tried to identify the Antitheses genre by situating this work alongside similar lists marshalled to ridicule opponents' gods in ancient inter- and intra-religious struggles for cultural hegemony.15 Dun gan compellingly argues that such lists sought to accumulate disparaging stories about others' gods, not to provide a carefully reasoned argument;16 yet his attempt to identify the genre of the Antitheses remains somewhat 13) References to the contents of the Antitheses have been collected by Harnack {Marcion, 74-92; 256*-313*). J. Rendel Harris even suggested that a portion of the Antitheses should be identified in the Dialogue ofAdamantius, where it copies the dialogue of Methodius with a certain Valentinian Droserius ("Marcion's Book of Contradictions," Bulletin of the John Rylands Library 6, no. 3 [1921]: 289-309). Scholars have not, however, embraced this hypothetical suggestion. 14) Harnack, Marcion, 74-76. 15) David L. Dungan, "Reactionary Trends in the Gospel Producing Activity of the Early Church," in L'Evangile selon Marc (ed. M. Sabbe; Louvain: Leuven University Press, 1974), esp. pp. 191-98. On struggles for cultural hegemony more broadly, see Arthur J. Droge, Homer or Moses?: Early Christian Interpretations of the History of Culture (T?bingen: J.C.B. Mohr, 1989). 16) Dungan contends that Marcion's use of antithetical statements does not necessarily speak to his rejection of allegory as a means for ameliorating difficulties in the text, as is sometimes claimed; rather Marcion employed a literalistic reading of these passages which happened to suit him at any particular point in his theological argument ("Reactionary Trends," 198). Schmid follows this assessment of Marcion's employment of allegory {Mar cion, 255-60).</page><page sequence="6">260 E. W. Scherbens ke I Vigiliae Christianae 64 (2010) 255-279 unsatisfactory since the other denigrations of opponents' gods adduced come from a broad spectrum of writings and are more representative of an argumentative strategy than a genre. So the problem of the genre of Marcion's Antitheses persists. Isagoge as a Genre As the designation isagoge (from e a /e a e , meaning "lead into") indicates, isagogic texts primarily functioned to introduce readers to a field of knowledge by making them cognizant of its terminology, categories of organization, recurring problems, and occasionally previous solutions. By the second century of the Common Era when Marcion flourished, the isagogic genre had already been deployed for some time for the transmis sion of elementary instruction so that neophytes might more easily and quickly gain mastery of a field's fundamental principles. Introductory texts have been traced back to early works written to introduce students to the proper definitions, divisions, and components of rhetoric and Greek gram mar.17 Introductory works were also composed in an effort to lead novices into the fundamentals of philosophical thought by eschewing more abstruse and complex topics. Notable examples are Epicurus's (341-271 b.c.e.) introductory letters to Herodotus, Pythocles, and Menoeceus, his so-called Kyriai Doxai,18 and Chrysippus's (282-206 b.c.e.) isagogic texts categorized under logic by Diogenes Laertius.19 Galen also prescribed 17) See Anaximenes (380-320 b.c.e.)

Soranus defined as isagogic a text specifically designed to introduce initi ates (e a e ) to the fundamental principles of medicine.21 Isagogic texts were employed to introduce students to such diverse fields as theol ogy, music, medicine, architecture, mathematics, and astronomy.22 Despite their primary elementary focus, isagogic texts were sometimes even intended for more learned readers. In his Epistle to Herodotus from the fourth/third century b.c.e., for example, Epicurus argues that the codifica tion of his main points and rubrics under which philosophical knowledge should be organized solidifies his system in the adept's mind and facilitates the recall of the all-important essentials even if the subtle nuances are forgotten.23 The subsequent discussion offers simple distillations of his philosophical theory (e.g. a e e a a ) followed by demonstrations or proofs of the veracity of these statements.24 The content and argumentative strategies found in Epicurus's Epistle to Herodotus are typical of isagogic texts. Cleonides' (ca. 2nd century c.e.) E a a explains harmonics by means of deliberate division and definition of its theoretical and practical knowledge. After a main term (e.g. ) is introduced, it is defined ( e ) and then given a more full discussion (e e e e a e ).25 The introduction of terms in one definition then leads to subsequent literature for isagogic texts may have had even earlier and more practical antecedents in such handbook texts as Xenophon's e ; see .

The date of the materials categorized as Pseudo-Soranus remains problematic: while the sources used in the compilation of the work known as the Isagoge derive from as early as late antiquity, the compilation itself probably dates from Medieval times: for a brief overview, see D.R.

Isa goge takes a similar propaedeutic format, introducing terms briefly before offering a full definition. In contrast to Cleonides' E a a , however, this isagogic text transmits musical knowledge by means of a series of questions and answers {erotapokriseis) that build on and propel the instruction seriatim.27 Undoubtedly, this erotapokriseis format was utilized to mimic the student-teacher relationship, a format that would have worked in tandem with the repetitions in Bacchius's Isagoge to facilitate memorization by novices.28 Another isagogic text, Nichomachus of Gera sas ( floruit cz. 100 ce.) Enchiridion, introduces the novice to the elements ( e a) of harmonics in commentary form ( a), often by delib erately setting his discussion in relation to previous musical theorists.29 Prior teachers and teachings also figured prominently in Cleomedes (ca. 4th century ce.)

Th. Sch?fer, "Eisagoge;" and Manfred Fuhrmann, "Isagogische Literatur," in KlPauly.</page><page sequence="9">Marcions Antitheses and the Isagogic Genre 263 we can deduce some general features of isagogic texts. The content in these isagogic texts ranges from simple definitions and statements categorizing established bodies of knowledge to full explications and discussions pro vided by means of carefully constructed definitions, syllogisms, and proofs, which are sometimes framed in opposition to previous thinkers. In terms of format, the most common are the simple straightforward definitions ( , a a ), lists of elements ( e a), lecture notes ( a ), ques tions and answers {erotapokriseis), or pedagogical epistles used to convey material in the simplest terms. Despite the diversity of argumentative strategies and formats found in the texts just surveyed, one aspect particularly defined the isagogic genre's function: the intended audience. Isagogic texts were primarily designed for education, especially the indoctrination of novices or initiates?even though, as Epicurus's epistles reveal, adepts could also profit from such texts. The use of different formats (e.g. erotapokriseis, , etc.) was dic tated not by the genre, but by the utility such a format would have for transmitting knowledge to the intended audience.33 The pedagogical Sitz im Leben of the erotapokriseis format34 just happened to lend itself quite suitably to the isagogic genre. The primary concern in these isagogic texts was to introduce the inexpe rienced student to a topic or field of study. In so doing it was common for isagogic texts to present information in a format easily accessible to begin ners often (though not always) dealing with broad and general themes.35 Not only did isagogic texts introduce and ease the student into a topic or field by broaching broad themes in a non-technical and non-argumentative 33) Even though this erotapokriseis format was extremely conducive to transmitting isagogic concerns due to its effectiveness in relaying information in an established student-teacher relationship, it could also transmit content without isagogic pretensions. For discussion of Homeric precursors to erotapokriseis literature without isagogic concerns, see Norden, "Die Composition"; Gustav Bardy, "La litt?rature patristique des "Quaestiones et Responsiones" sur l'Ecriture Sainte," Revue Biblique 41 (1932): 210-36, 341-69, 515-37; 42 (1933): 14-30, 211-229, 328-352; and Ter Haar Romeny, "Question-and-Answer Collections." 34) Ter Haar Romeny, "Question-and-Answer Collections," esp. 148-54. 35) Asper's conclusions regarding isagogic texts (in particular what he designates "scho lische") corroborate my own findings that such texts were rarely used to develop nuanced arguments through precisely organized and ordered argumentation. Asper isolated six main features that distinguished this "scholische" or lecture-style e a : 1) a loosely arranged thematic structure; 2) variations in style; 3) direct exhortations by the author; 4) guiding notes; 5) exhortations to the readers/hearers; and 6) an emphasis on the oral transmission of the introduction ("Zu Struktur und Funktion eisagogischer Texte," 323).</page><page sequence="10">264 E. W. Scherbenske I Vigiliae Christianae 64 (2010) 255-279 way, it also introduced the novice to themes that would be encountered later in the course of study. By supplying notes for guidance in the field the isagogic text shaped the rubrics under which subsequent knowledge would be placed. The isagogic text thus supplemented (or stood in the place of) the author or teacher, sometimes directly in the first person.36 While isa gogic texts primarily functioned to guide the student or reader into the field and to prepare them for more advanced study, they could take diverse forms. Furthermore, the boundaries between different forms and contents could be blurred. Even Markus Asper, who has attempted to isolate rela tively distinct features for various isagogic texts, tempered his conclusions with caveats against expecting pure types in the e a genre: quite often, isagogic texts mixed with one another resulting in hybrid introduc tions.37 This malleability needs to be kept in mind when we try to under stand Marcions Antitheses in light of this genre. Marcion's Antitheses as an Isagogic Text References to Marcion's Antitheses support the argument that this work conformed to the isagogic genre and was adapted for Marcion's particular purposes. Although identifying the genre of ?vz Antitheses, a text no longer extant, poses difficulties, references to the argumentative content, form, and intended audience suggest that this work conformed to many aspects of the isagogic genre. Our knowledge of the Antitheses content provides the most important evidence for its connection to the isagogic genre. As noted, this text was primarily comprised of antithetical statements eluci dating Marcion's fundamental theological themes. Tertullian locates the primary focus of Marcion's theology in his disassociation of the God of the Hebrew Bible from the God of Jesus Christ and, as a result, the law from 36) In his study of isagogic texts Asper argued that in Cleomedes' Caelestia the first person opening exhortation, e , characterizing the lecture setting, has been codified into a third person written statement with the closing words of this tract, e e ai a a a at the end of the work (Caelestia, 1.1.1; 2.7.228 [ed. Todd 1,3-5; 84,11-14]). From the beginning to the end, according to Asper, there is a transition from a first person pedagogical situation of the lecture to the codification of this instruction in the written notes ( a ). These lecture notes now stand in place of the teacher by collect ing and systematizing his instruction ("Zu Struktur und Funktion eisagogischer Texte," 320-22). 37) Asper, "Zu Struktur und Funktion eisagogischer Texte," 326-35.</page><page sequence="11">Marcions Antitheses and the Isagogic Genre 265 the gospel. Tertullian vehemently and consistently militates against this very tenet: The separation of the law and the gospel is the principal work of Marcion. His disciples are not able to deny this, which they have in the first document {in summo instrumento), through which in fact they are initiated {initiantur) and are made obstinate {indurantur) in this heresy. For these are Marcion's Antitheses, that is contrary opposites, which endeavor to expose the gospel's discord with the law, so that from the contrariety of statements of both documents they may also prove the contrariety of Gods.38 We have, however, already established against the Antitheses that nothing is con tributed by the first premise of Marcion, which he reckons is the disassociation of the law and the gospel, as even this is arranged by the creator, then preached in the promise of a new law and a new word and a new testament.39 Marcion apparently tried to disassociate his scripture from the Hebrew Bible by arguing from contradictory laws or sayings from these documents: e.g. Marcion claimed the God of the Hebrew Bible was vengeful in con trast to the merciful God proclaimed by Jesus {Marc. 1.27.1); the one was bellicose, the other pacifist {Marc. 1.6.1-2); one just, the other good {Marc. 1.6.1-2); one sullied with the creation of the material world, the other alien to this mutable world (Iren. Haer. 5.2.1); one petty and par ticularistic, the other magnanimous and universalistic {Marc. 4.63); one known, the other unknown {Marc. 4.6.4); and one God of the law, another of the gospel {Marc. 4.6.3). Marcion rejected this God because he was unable to accommodate what he deemed were proper divine attributes and actions with disgraceful stories in the Hebrew Bible: such stories not in accordance with divine qualities (e.g. anthropomorphisms, descriptions of God's creation of evil, ignorance, and limitations) buttressed Marcion's conviction that this God was separate from that who sent the Christ and, for this reason, ought to be rejected.40 These representative examples 38) Separatio legis et euangelii proprium et principale opus est Marcionis, nec poterunt negare discipuli eius quod in summo instrumento habent, quo denique initiantur et indurantur in hanc haeresim. Nam hae sunt 'Antithesis Marcionis, id est contrariae oppositiones, quae conan tur discordiam euangelii cum lege committere, ut ex diuersitate sententiarum utriusque instru menti diuersitatem quoque argumententur deorum (Marc. 1.19.4 [CCSL 1 460,22-2]). 39) Praestruximus quidem aduersus antithesis nihil proficere proposito Marcionis quam putat diuersitatem legis et euangelii, ut et hanc a creatore dispositam, denique praedicatam in repro missione nouae legis et noui sermonis et noui testamenti (Marc. 4.9.3 [CCSL 1 558,20-24]). 40) Tertullian Marc. 1.2.2; 2.5.1-2; 2.16.4; 2.25.1-2 (CCSL 1 443; 479-480; 493; 503).</page><page sequence="12">266 E. W Scherbenske I Vigiliae Christianae 64 (2010) 255-279 demonstrate Marcion's thoroughness in articulating this fundamental tenet through his Antitheses and cohere well with the ways in which isagogic texts often conveyed introductory content by means of simple straightfor ward definitions in order to inculcate and systematize the basic tenets of a specific doctrine. According to Tertullian, Marcion's Antitheses did not consist in carefully reasoned arguments. Marcion's refutation and rejection of Judaism and the Jewish God was instead grounded in the accumulation of discrete, yet interrelated, antithetical statements that elucidated his fundamental themes. Tertullian's attempt to offer alternative antitheses and interpreta tions reveals the succinct and straightforward quality of Marcion's state ments. For example, Tertullian simply counters Marcion as follows: "these rather will be our antitheses which connect Christ [to] not separate [from the Creator];"41 and "but if the kingdom of God is in the commandment then set it against Moses, and according to our antitheses, there is one sense."42 The discrete character of Marcion's Antitheses is also intimated in Tertullian's following statement: "I should otherwise have fallen one by one on Marcion's antitheses themselves, if, from their toilsome destruc tion, a defense of the creator as good and judge had been lacking."43 Appar ently, Marcion was not particularly concerned with developing an elaborate or carefully nuanced argument; the statements themselves, juxtaposed with one another, compelled the interpretation Marcion endorsed. Although this style of argumentation and introductory demonstration grounded in simple antithetical statements coheres well with some aspects of isagogic texts, Tertullian's bias must be weighed circumspectly; we would expect him to portray the Antitheses as simple and unsupported by well reasoned arguments.44 Fortunately, other sources corroborate Tertullian's Gerhard May has convincingly argued that philosophical conceptions of the divine informed Marcion's theology and interpretations of Genesis transmitted in his Antitheses ("Markions Genesisauslesung," 197-98). On Marcion's possible relationship to philosophi cal thought, also see Ugo Bianchi, "Marcion: Theologien biblique ou docteur gnostique?," VC 21, no. 3 (1967): 141-49; and John G.

An impor tant one is Adamantius's De recta in Deum fide, a text not dependent on Tertullian.45 Despite Adamantius's references to Marcion's own works in this dialogue, scholars are virtuously unanimous in thinking that Adaman tius probably did not himself use Marcion's texts.46 Rather, Adamantius likely made use of earlier heresiological works for his information on Marcion.47 Such caveats notwithstanding, Gerhard May still goes so far as to hypothesize that the antithetical statements recorded in this work may Harnack s portrait of Marcion as a biblical philologist uninterested in more philosophically abstruse concerns. In fact, May has compellingly argued that the reality is quite the reverse: evidence indicates that Marcion was deeply engaged with the philosophical questions of his day and developed his theology towards their solution ("Marcion in Contemporary Views," 143-48; and "Markions Genesisauslesung," 197-98). 45) The De recta in Deum fide, once attributed to Origen, is now widely accepted as anony mous and usually dated to the first half of the fourth century. The question of dating revolves around the relationship between passages found in the De recta in Deum fide and in Methodius's e a e and e a a a e . Although Timothy Barnes argued that Methodius was dependent on the De recta in Deum fide, thus placing the latter in the middle of the third century ("Methodius, Maximus, and Valentinus," JTS n.s. 30, no. 1 Ap [1979]: 47-55), Schmid has reaffirmed Zahns opinion that Adamantius is depen dent on Methodius {Marcion, 202-06). As a result, he argues that the De recta in Deum fide probably was written after Methodius's death ca. 313 and before 358 when this work was first attributed to Origen in the Philocalia (ibid. 206). This work written in Greek also survives in Latin manuscripts of a translation undertaken by Rufinus around 400. For a discussion of the manuscripts and sources used by the author of this work, see the critical edition by W. H. van de Sande Bakhuyzen ed., Der Dialog des Adamantius: E E E E [Leipzig: Hinrich, 1901], xxvi-xxxvii, xv-xvi. 46) De recta in Deum fide, 806d-807b {GCS 4 10,20-32); De recta in Deum fide, 823e-824a {GCS 4 66,5-12); De recta in Deum fide, 864a-c {GCS 4 222,10-28). The dialogue even imputes this same rhetorical strategy to the Marcionite Megethius, who is portrayed as trying to refute Adamantius with his own writings, i.e. his scriptures {De recta in Deum fide, 810a [GCS 4 18,7-9]). W.H. van de Sande Bakhuyzen {Der Dialog des Adamantius, xv-xvi), Harnack {Marcion, 56*-63*), and Schmid {Marcion, 207) all concur that this dialogue does not offer direct access to Marcion's writings, but incorporated earlier anti Marcionite texts. 47) Harnack thinks that even though it does not appear that Adamantius used a copy of Marcion's works, since he wrote in the early 4th century, Adamantius would have been able to redeploy many anti-Marcionite sources for his refutation {Marcion, 59*-63*). While Schmid is less sanguine, he does not completely dismiss Adamantius's worth for recon structing Marcion's texts (at least his text of the Pauline corpus), though he maintains that, since Adamantius did not have Marcion's text of Paul in hand, his citations should ideally be corroborated byTertullian and Epiphanius {Marcion, 207-09).</page><page sequence="14">268 E. W. Scherbenske I Vigiliae Christianae 64 (2010) 255-279 have been original.48 In sum, Adamantius offers valuable sources that con tain (possibly original) information not only on the content of Marcion's Antitheses, but their argumentative form as well. This dialogue s most noteworthy aspect is the repeated antithetical state ments, which the Marcionite characters furnish to support arguments that the God of the Hebrew Bible was separate from that of the Gospel and the Apostolikon. For example, the Marcionite Megethius contrasts the bellicose God of the Hebrew Bible with the pacifist Jesus in this way: The prophet of the God of creation, so that he might kill more when he was fight ing, did not allow the sun to set until he finished killing those fighting against the people; but the Lord, since he is good, says, "do not allow the sun to set on your anger;"... The prophet of the God of creation, when war was stirred up against the people, climbing to the peak of the mountain stretched out his hands to God so that he might kill many in battle; but our Lord, since he is good, stretched out his hands not to kill men but to save them. What then is similar? Through stretch ing out his hands that one kills, but this one saves.49 These simple antithetical statements cohere well with the content of the Antitheses as described by Tertullian. Although short interpretations or explications may have been appended to these antithetical statements (as seen in the second example), the Antitheses primarily consisted of contrast ing statements from Marcion's texts and the Hebrew Bible. Sometimes the content of statements attributed to the Marcionites in De recta in Deum fide are remarkably close to Tertullian's explicit references to the Antitheses in his Adversus Marcionem. For example, both Tertullian and Adamantius mention Marcion's emphasis on the opposite reactions to children in the Hebrew Bible and the gospel, the former explicitly linking these statements to Marcion's Antitheses. 48) "Die ersten beiden Teile des Dialog enthalten eine Reihe markionitischer Antithesen, die urspr?nglich sein k?nnen" ("Markions Genesisauslesung," 197). 49) E . e e e , iva e a a , e a e a a e a a ? a a , e ? e a (De recta in Deum fide 1 813a-b [GCS 4 28,21-23]); E . e e e , a a , a a?a , e e a e a a e , iva e a ? , a a , e e a e a a a e e a a a a . ; e a e a e e a a e , e (De recta in Deum fide 812b [GCS A 24,24-29]).</page><page sequence="15">Marcions Antitheses and the Isagogic Genre 269 Tertullian, Marc. 4.23A But behold Christ loves the little ones, teaching that those who want to be greater ought to be such as these. But the creator let loose bears against boys, taking vengeance for the insults the prophet Elisha suffered from them. Adamantius, De recta 15-16 814c The prophet of the God of creation told a bear to rush from the wood and devour the children taunting him. But the good Lord says "allow the children to come to me, for the king dom of heaven is for such as these."50 The content and form of these two sources are remarkably similar, only differing insignificantly in the order and statements attributed to Christ. If the Antitheses contained both sayings attributed to Christ alongside the story about Elisha and the she-bears, and if this difference is not due to the whims of Tertullian or Adamantius, we may have caught a glimpse of Mar cion structuring multiple statements from his collection of scripture along side a Hebrew Bible antithesis.50 Adamantius also corroborates Tertullian's report that Marcion con trasted Christ's injunction to travel without worldly possessions with the creator God's command that the Israelites gird themselves for travel and spoil the Egyptians. Tertullian, Marc. 4.24A Now the creator leads the exodus of the sons of Israel from Egypt loaded with the spoils of gold and silver and utensils and clothes, together with weight of unleavened dough.

See how the good one clearly opposes the teachings of that one.51 While Tertullian has an abbreviated form compared to Adamantius, in terms of content and format, both he and Adamantius offer strikingly similar accounts despite their independence. The short epexegetical note appended to the antithetical statements in De recta in Deum fide is also noteworthy since, if ultimately dependent on Marcion's Antitheses, it rein forces the guiding antithetical principle of interpretation. In another example, Tertullian mines the scriptures to prove that Jesus' command to love your enemies is in keeping with the Hebrew Bible, not in opposition as Marcion claimed.52 This contrast between loving and hat ing your enemies is also found in the short pithy antithesis in De recta in Deum fide: "The lord in the law says: 'Love the one who loves you and hate your enemy' But our Lord, since he is good, says: 'Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you.' "53 In Adamantius's dialogue, Megethius merely offers these contrasting statements in order to show that the law and the gospel are dissonant. Although neither the Marcionite Megethius nor Marcus are given the scope to defend their positions in the De recta in Deum fide, the close similarities between Tertullian and Adamantius offer compelling evidence that the presentation of these statements (if not direct 51) Profectionem filiorum Israhelis creator etiam illis spoliis aureorum et argenteorum uasculo rum et uestium praeter oneribus consparsionum offarcinatam educit exAegypto, Christus autem nec uirgam discipulis in uiam ferrepraescripsit'(Marc. 4.24A [CCSL 1 607,28-2]); E . e e e a a e ?a A e e, , a e e , a a? a e , a a e ' a ? a a a a a a a a a e a e A , e a a , a a a a e , e ? e a a , e a , e a , e a a a . e a a a e a a a (De recta in Deum fide 81 la-b [GCS 4 22,1-9]). 52) Tertullian, Marc. 2.18; 4.16 (CCSL 1 495-496; 581-585). 53) e ? a a e a a a e, a e ? e , a a , e ? a a a e a e e e a (De recta in Deum fide 1 812d [GCS 4 26,18-21]).</page><page sequence="17">Marcions Antitheses and the Isagogic Genre 271 quotations from Marcion's Antitheses) owes more to this tract's argumenta tive strategy and format than to heresiological misrepresentation. Tertullian and Epiphanius also comment on the rejection of the law with the advent of the gospel in their discussions of Marcion's text of Gal 5.14, where Paul exhorts the Galatian community to love one's neigh bor as oneself. Both Tertullian's and Epiphanius's interpretations of this verse underscore Marcion's annulment of the law as a result of the separa tion of the law from the gospel.54 What is particularly interesting for our discussion here is the argumentative strategy used by Epiphanius to refute this interpretation. After citing the verse as a note ( ) from Marcion's Apostolikon, Epiphanius offers a simple straightforward refuta tion ( e ), wherein he often cites the Hebrew Bible or the NT and explains how this verse does not separate, but rather unites the law and the gospel.55 This style of refutation, unique amongst the heresies treated in Epiphanius's Panarion and utilized extensively in his polemic against Marcion,56 closely resembles the content and argumentative strategy of Tertullian's and Adamantius's discussions of Marcion's tenets and may perhaps be traced to the Antitheses.57 Since Epiphanius claims that he had in hand and used Marcion's own writings (his Gospel, Apostolikon, and Antitheses), it would be completely logical for him to refute Marcion not only with his own text, but also with his own style of argumentation, i.e. simple statements from the NT subsequently refuted by comparable state ments from the NT or OT.58 For these scholia and refutations, Epiphanius 54) Tertullian, Marc. 5.4.12-13 {CCSL 1 674,6-14); Epiphanius Pan. 42.12.3 (GCS 31 157.9-16). 55) See e.g. Pan. 42.12.3 (GCS31 157.9-16). 56) Epiphanius s typical style of argumentation consists of a brief overview and discussion of the indicted "heretics," often followed by citations from their writings (or oral reports of their errors) and Epiphanius's refutation of their practices, beliefs, or interpretations. This refutation often refers back to the primary "heretical" sources Epiphanius adduced, but only in the case of Marcion does he employ such balanced antithetical scholia. For more on Epiphanius' Panarion and his method of refutation, see Frank Williams tr., The Panarion of Epiphanius of Salamis: Book 1 (Sects 1-46), (Leiden: E.J. Brill, 1987), xvi-xviii. 57) Cf. e.g. . ? a o? a a a a e a ? a e a ?. ' e .

W Scherbenske I Vigiliae Christianae 64 (2010) 255-279 apparently drew upon an earlier notebook that he wrote against Marcion, in which he excerpted material from Marcions works in the form of scholia and grouped under specific rubrics.59 Epiphanius then incorpo rated these scholia into the Panarion, where he refuted them one by one. We have no definitive proof that, by grouping scriptural notes and refutations under broad rubrics, Epiphanius modeled his refutation on Marcion s Antitheses themselves; but since Epiphaniuss argumentative strategy and structure offer parallels to our investigation into the Antitheses, such modeling would neither be inconceivable nor surprising. At the very least, Epiphanius corroborates our findings culled from Tertullian and Adamantius. The antithetical statements from Tertullian and Adamantius (which in some cases are deliberately cited as being taken from Marcion s Antitheses) and Epiphaniuss notes and refutations (arguably modeled after Marcion's Antitheses) call to mind the following characteristics of the isagogic genre: simple straight-forward style and content, concern for definitions, discus sion of previous authorities, and intended audience. These statements con vey general themes and summarize Marcionite doctrine in a straight-forward antithetical format wherein the simple juxtaposition of these statements supplies the argumentative strategy. The definitions tendered in these state ments, however, are not like those found in Cleonides' E a a or Baccheius G?rons Isagoge, where one definition led to another, but rather apophatic. By contrasting the demiurge of the Hebrew Bible with Christ, Marcion defined negatively what true divinity was. In juxtaposing the baser attributes of the Hebrew Bible god with Christ's divine ones, Marcion defined God in accordance with contemporary philosophical conceptions of God.60 In so doing, Marcion's Antitheses deliberately cast 173), in contrast to Clabeaux who thought that Epiphanius did not have a copy of Mar cion's texts, but only used previous anti-marcionite works {Lost Edition, 14). There seems to be no reason to discount Epiphanius's assertion that he used Marcion's Gospel, Apostolikon, and Antitheses (or the Syntagma as he designates the latter). 59) Schmid makes a thoroughly compelling argument that in this notebook ( a ) Epiphanius grouped the scholia under rubrics ( a a a a , a a a, a a, a, a a a e ) which he himself identifies {Pan. 42.10.5-8 [GCS 31 106-107]); as Schmid points out {Marcion, 169-171), traces of one of the rubrics are still visible: e.g. a . e a a a e e ? e a e , e a , e e a ?. {Pan. 42.12.3 [GCS 31 171.14-15]). 60) On Marcion's awareness of philosophical currents, see Gerhard May, "Marcion in Con temporary Views," 143-48; and ibid., "Markions Genesisauslesung," 197-98.</page><page sequence="19">Marcions Antitheses and the Isagogic Genre 273 aspersions on the authority of the Hebrew Bible and Jewish perverters of the gospel kerygma.61 Thus the Antitheses were able to weave together implicit polemics and definitions in simple antithetical statements, possi bly grouped under broad rubrics.62 While these forementioned features of Marcions Antitheses resonate with the isagogic genre, the Antitheses focus on the intended initiate audience strongly supports the argument that Marcion composed the Antitheses to function as an introductory text. Tertullian, our principal early source for the Antitheses, explicitly indicates that he understood the Antitheses to function as an introductory work designed to instruct readers in Marcionite theology and interpretation: he identifies this work as the summo instru mento through which his disciples are "initiated and made obstinate in this heresy." The phrase in summo instrumento contains considerable ambiguity and could refer to the "main," "head," "most important," "chief," or "first document" depending on the preferred translation. If we are to under stand the description of the Antitheses as a "first document," this may sup ply evidence that it not only functioned as an introduction but was, perhaps, an introduction prefaced to Marcion's edition. Such a hypothesis may be corroborated by Tertullian's descriptions of the Antitheses-. But now we advance another step onward challenging, as we claim and thus even are about to prove, that the very gospel of Marcion has been adulterated. For clearly he assembled everything that he labored on, even setting up beforehand (praestruendo) the Antitheses, for this [purpose]: that he might establish a differ ence between the Old and New Testament, in the same manner his Christ sepa rated from the creator as of another God and alien to the law and prophets. Clearly, for that reason he erased whatever was contrary to his judgment, as 61) Both Tertullian (Marc. A [CCSL 1 550, 20-25]) and Adamantius (De recta in Deum fide 2 830e [GCSA 88.31-33]) relate Marcion's indictment of early Jewish corruptions and interpolations to the Gospel. 62) It is worth noting briefly the differences between Marcion's Antitheses and the Syllogisms of his one-time pupil Apelles. From what we can glean from the Antitheses and Apelles' Syllogisms, Marcion's pupil preferred an erotapokriseis format, where a question was followed by a more fully developed syllogistic argument, rather than simple statements with minimal commentary. The slightly more advanced character of the Syllogisms casts in relief the isagogic simplicity of Marcion's Antitheses. Despite the fact that erotapokriseis could be used for introductory works, Apelles seems to have developed this format in ways parallel to its use in Homeric criticism and informed by philosophical discourse (Katharina Greschat, Apelles und Hermogenes: Zwei theologische Lehrer des zweiten Jahrhunderts [Leiden: Brill, 2000], 46-50).</page><page sequence="20">274 E. W Scherbenske I Vigiliae Christianae 64 (2010) 255-279 though conspired with the creator [and] interwoven by his [i.e. the creator's] defenders; but those agreeing with his judgment he retained.63 While I have translated the word praestruo with the deliberately neutral "set up beforehand," Ernest Evans' translation "prefix" is apt and conso nant with the possible prefatory quality of Marcion's Antitheses for which I am arguing here.64 Tertullian's designation of the Antitheses as head docu ment {summo instrumento), coupled with his use of praestruo, suggest that the Antitheses may have in fact physically introduced Marcion's corpus. Furthermore, Tertullian's statement that the Antitheses "extend" or "dis play" (praefero) Marcion's theology supports the interpretation that at the very least this work functioned isagogically by establishing the terms of the interpretation for the following texts (and possibly introducing them physically).65 That this introduction may have been prefaced to Marcion's gospel accords well with the forementioned anonymous Syriac source's description of Marcion's book as a proevangelium. Although prefacing an isagogic text to an author's work may not have been common for the isagogic texts discussed here, the Antitheses introductory function clearly parallels the isagogic genre. By thematically laying out and supporting Marcion's interpretation at the beginning of his corpus, the Antitheses, in effect, set the terms of the argument, transmitted Marcion's hermeneutic, and prepared the reader to approach the following texts of the Gospel and Apostolikon through a proper Marcionite reading. Even if we bracket the possibility that summo instrumento and praestruo refer to the Antitheses as a physical introduction to Marcion's canon, the preceding argument clearly shows that this work had an isagogic function. Further confirmation of the Antitheses isagogic and possible prefatory role can be found in a passage where Tertullian contrasts this text with a 63) Sedalium iam hinc inimus gradum, ipsum, ut professi sumus, euangelium Marcionis prouo cantes, sic quoque probaturi adulteratum. Certe enim totum quod elaborauit, etiam antithesis praestruendo, in hoc cogit, ut ueteris et noui testamenti diuersitatem constituons constitu&gt;at, proinde Christum suum a creatore separatum, ut dei alterius, ut alienum legis etprophetarum.

In order to prove that Marcion rep resents a heretical deviation from his allegiance to the original Christian message, Tertullian argues: What now if, in contrast to his own letter (epistulam), the Marcionites deny his faith first belonged to us? What if they do not acknowledge the letter? They clearly acknowledge (fatentur) and even display (praeferunt) Marcion's Antitheses. My proof from these suffices. For if the gospel which is referred to as Luke is our repository?we will see whether it is Marcion's repository?is itself, that which Marcion denounced through his own Antitheses as interpolated by the defenders of Judaism to the bodily union of the law and the prophets, from which thereupon 66) Marc. 4.4.3-4 (CCSL 1 550). This letter is not to be confused with accusations that Marcion forged a letter to the Laodiceans or Alexandrians reported in the Muratorian Canon (Canon Muratorianus lines 1-3 Fol. iia). For a critical edition, see Samuel Prideaux Tregelles, Canon Muratorianus; The Earliest Catalogue of the Books of the New Testament (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1867). Rather, Tertullian relates that this letter was composed by Marcion himself (Marc. 1.1.4, 4.4.3-4; Carn. Chr. 2.4). In his treatise De carne Christi Tertullian claims that a certain letter (epistolam) written by Marcion relates how he was once a Christian believer before apostasizing. Tertullian also adds that Marcion's own fol lowers neither deny the authenticity of this letter nor the veracity of Tertullian's allegation (Carn. Chr. 2.4 [CCSL 2 875, 20-25]). Tertullian's reference to this letter in book one of his Advenus Marcionem follows relatively the same lines, with the exception that in this passage Tertullian refers to a littera rather than an epistola (Marc. 1.1.6 [CCSL 1 442,28-6]). Although littera does not need to be restricted by the definition of "letter" or "epistle" (v.s. littera in Lewis and Short, Latin Dictionary) and could theoretically refer to the Anti theses or other possible writings by Marcion, this is usually understood as a reference to the same writing designated epistolam. Similarly, while epistola!epistula could mean simply "written communication" (v.s. epistula, ibid.), it surely must be understood in the sense of "epistle." For previous discussions of this letter, see Harnack, Marcion, l6*-23*; Ernest Evans, Tertullian's Treatise on the Incarnation (London: S.P.C.K., 1956), 95; J?rgen Regul, Die antimarcionitischen Evangelienprologe (Freiburg: Herder, 1969), 182-83; Jean-Pierre Mah?, "Tertullien et l'Epistula Marcionis," RevScRel 45, no. 4 (1971): 358-71; and Joseph Verheyden, "The Canon Muratori: A Matter of Dispute," in The Biblical Canons (ed. J.M. Auwers and HJ. de Jonge; Leuven: Leuven University Press, 2003), esp. 539-541. This letter's content and authenticity represent two fundamental problems for interpreting Tertullian's reports about it. Despite Tertullian's admission that some may object to the let ter, its authenticity as a Marcionite composition has largely achieved scholarly consensus (Regul, Die antimarcionitischen Evangelienprologe, 182-83; Mah?, "Tertullien et l'Epistula Marcionis," 358-71). Evans, while not disputing its authenticity, maintains that its con tents are unclear (Tertullian's Treatise, 95).</page><page sequence="22">276 E. W.

Particularly noteworthy is the offhand comment that "they clearly acknowledge (fatentur) and even display (praeferunt)" this text. Interpretation of this passage hinges on the meaning of the word praeferunt, translated neutrally above as "display." Alternatively, one could also translate praeferunt as "they offer" or "they place before" in order to capture the prefatory aspect of this verb more precisely.68 Both of these translations support the interpretation that the Antitheses had an introduc tory function: the former aligns nicely with the catechetical aspects of the Antitheses designed to guide readers (neophytes or adepts) into the founda tional texts of the faith by means of a proper Marcionite interpretation; the latter reinforces the possible prefatory aspect of the Antitheses suggested by multiple passages in the Adversus Marcionem.69 In fact, when coupled with the description that Marcion "set up the Antitheses beforehand (praestru endo)"?it should be recalled here that Evans translated praestruendo as "prefix"?the use of praeferunt strengthens the argument that this work served as an elementary work designed to introduce his canon. While it is not necessary to insist that the Antitheses could only function isagogically if prefaced to Marcions Gospel and Apostolikon, this passage from book four of Tertullian's Adversus Marcionem speaks to the impor tance of the Antitheses for transmitting Marcion's foundational precepts. In this respect, we ought to situate Tertullian's statement that Marcion's fol lowers praeferunt the Antitheses alongside the report that Marcion com posed this "first document (summo instrumento)" so that his followers might be "initiated (initiantur) and cemented (indurantur)" in the faith.70 67) Quid nunc, si negauerint Marcionitae primam apud nos fidem eius aduersus epistolam quoque ipsius?

This pedagogical (or catechetical) aspect of the isagogic genre identi fied in the Antitheses would undoubtedly have been a great desideratum for spreading the faith through Marcion's ambitious (and obviously highly successful) evangelic campaign. Also fundamental for the introduction to Marcion's theology outlined in the Antitheses were the issues of scope and authenticity.71 In Marcion's interpretation the separation of the law from the gospel, the God of the Hebrew Bible from that of Jesus Christ supplied the telos of Paul's letters and the gospel. These excerpts from the Hebrew Bible and Marcion's NT, codified in the Antitheses, stood in sharp contrast with one another. Tertul lian himself perspicaciously realized that the purpose, and even the very title, of the Antitheses fostered Marcion's interpretation: Take away Marcion's title and intention as well as the main point of this work and nothing else remains except the demonstration of God, the best and judge, because these two align with God alone.72 Even though Tertullian rejects Marcion's interpretation and attempts to prove the unity of the God of the Hebrew Bible and the NT, he unmistak ably realizes the end point of his Antitheses and texts: to differentiate the 71) Although the issues of authenticity and scope appear to be prominent in Marcion's Antitheses, this work may have been somewhat deficient with respect to those seven intro ductory questions often covered before beginning a course of study investigated by Jaap Mansfeld {Prolegomena: Questions to be Settled before the Study of an Author, or a Text [Leiden: EJ. Brill, 1994], passim, cf. esp. 10-11). These introductory questions concern: 1) the scope of the argument ( ); 2) the arrangement of the work ( a a ); 3) the utility of the work ( ); 4) the reason ( a ) for title (e a ) of the work; 5) the authenticity of the work ( ); 6) the division of the work ( a e ); and 7) from what branch of philosophy the work derives ( ) (ibid. 10-11). Although the scope and authenticity apparently proved fundamental for articulating Marcion's theology and textual practices in the Antitheses, there is no way to know precisely how Marcion may have covered the remaining topics in this work or if he was even aware of systematic han dling of all these issues in introductory works. 72) Aufer titulum Marcionis et intentionem atque propositum operis ipsius, et nihil aliudprae stare * quam demonstrationem eiusdem dei, optimi et iudicis, quia haec duo in solum deum {Marc. 2.29.2 [CCSL 1 508,9-14]).</page><page sequence="24">278 E.

In this way, Marcion's Antitheses correspond with other ancient prolegomena in introducing the scope of its attendant corpus. Marcion's fundamental distinction between the law and the gospel also informed Marcion's treatment of authenticity. Nowhere is this more appar ent than in Marcion's castigation of "false apostles" as perverters of the gospel trying to turn believers back to Judaism?according to Tertullian, an issue explicitly addressed in the Antitheses.70 These "false apostles," in Marcion's mind, not only tried to corrupt the gospel preached to those in Corinth, Galatia, and elsewhere, they were also responsible for the corruption of the physical gospel and Paul's letters transmitted in manu scripts down to his day.74 The end-point Marcion saw in the gospel and Paul's letters was inextricably linked with the text critical activities he undertook in order to remove what he saw as the detritus of Jewish religion and to reestablish the original purity of the gospel message. Marcion was not haphazardly or arbitrarily manipulating the text; in his mind, he was restoring its original condition in accordance with his interpretation of the telos of these texts, a telos blatantly articulated in the Antitheses. In fact, Tertullian himself concedes that "they assert that Marcion did not so much create the principle by separation of the law and the gospel as he restored it after having been adulterated."75 Marcion's understanding of authentic Pauline and gospel teaching provided the starting point for his text-critical actions. The authorial constructs Marcion employed allowed him to justify his correction of the gospel and Paul's letters.76 Futhermore, the assertion that the Gospel and Paul's letters had to be cleansed of the corruptions of "false apostles," who had reverted back to Judaism, follows directly from Marcion's ultimate goal in the Antitheses: to differentiate the Hebrew Bible 73) Marc. 4.4.3-4 {CCSL 1 550,16-25). 74) See e.g. Marc. 1.20.2 {CCSL 1 461,19-24); Aforc. 1.20.4 {CCSL 1 461,4-8); Mzrc. 1.20.6 {CCSL 1 462,27-6); Mzm 5.3.2 {CCSL 1 668,16-23); Aforr. 5.12.6 {CCSL 1 701,18-21); Mzm 5.19.5 {CCSL 1 721,7-9). 75) Aiunt enim Marcionem non tarn innouasse regul?m separatione legis et euangelii quam retro adulteratam recurasse {Marc. 1.20.1 [CCSL 1 460,14-16]). 76) In essence, Marcion interpreted Paul from Paul, just as scripture came to be interpreted from scripture. This exegetical principle precedes Marcion; it was already employed for interpretation of Homer (" a e ). Grant made a cursory investi gation into Marcion's application of this exegetical principle ("Marcion and Critical Method," 211-212).

This fundamen tal issue highlighted in the Antitheses supplies one final connection with isagogic texts, wherein it was not uncommon to reject previous authorities or their doctrine as false. Conclusion By utilizing strategies and formats typical of isagogic texts, Marcion fash ioned the Antitheses in order to set out the fundamental rubrics and themes of his faith. Among those prominent features of the isagogic genre were the Antitheses straightforward antithetical format and an essential, rudimen tary content that was ideally suited for catechetical initiation into and rein forcement of Marcionite doctrine. Furthermore, the Antitheses transmitted Marcions hermeneutic, thus shaping subsequent readings of his authorita tive texts. Yet the Antitheses was not merely a pedantic introduction. As a pre-text read before (and perhaps even prefixed to) Marcions texts, it also supplied the pretext for his interpretation and (quite probably) textual alterations. In this respect, the issues of authenticity, scope, and "false apostles" found in the Antitheses were crucial for understanding the role of Marcions interpretation in transmitting his faith and his texts. Central to this interpretation was Marcions rejection of the Hebrew Bible and the God in it?an interpretation grounded in philosophical conceptions of God, as May astutely recognized.77 While this introductory text may have offered justification for Marcions text critical actions, it also catechetically introduced the reader to his hermeneutic so as to guide the reader's inter pretation in accordance with his understanding of the Christian faith. 77) "Marcion in Contemporary Views," 144-48; May writes that "Marcion made a distinc tion between the two Gods because he could not reconcile the anthropomorphic traits of the Old Testament God with the philosophical concept of an essentially good God" (145). May also connects this philosophical foundation to Marcion's rejection of allegory as a mode of interpretation: "[s]ince the Old Testament is not sufficient for his theological demands, he traces it back to a God of low rank. The rejection of allegorical interpretation is the consequence, not the presupposition, of criticism" (147). In the same issue of Second Century Drijvers also presents a compelling argument that Marcion's theology and thus his rejection of the Hebrew Bible ought to be framed against the backdrop of philosophical conceptions of God and cosmology in the second century of the Common Era ("Mar cionism in Syria," 158-72).</page></plain_text>
