<plain_text><page sequence="1">Genre and Structure: Toward an Actantial Typology of Narrative Genres and Modes Ronald Schleifer and Alan Velie The Logic of Discourse Claude Levi-Strauss is famous for ingenious solutions to literary puzzles-his explanation of the structure of the Oedipus myth is an example-but he has left some puzzles of his own to be de- coded. One of the most tantalizing is the Boolean matrix which he offers as "a structural model defined as the group of transforma- tions of a small number of elements" (S&amp;F, p. 183)1 to account for Vladimir Propp's linear formula for the structure of Russian won- dertales. In "Structure and Form: Reflections on a Work by Vla- dimir Propp," Levi-Strauss discusses the limitations of the formula Propp had propounded in Morphology of the Folktale. In place of the fixed order of the thirty-one "functions" Propp had isolated in the Russian wondertale, narrative events involving seven "dramatis personae" which always occur in the same order, Levi-Strauss sub- stitutes the following Boolean matrix: W -X IiY 1-Z ..... -W 1/X 1-Y Z 1/W 1-X Y -Z ..... i-W X -Y 1/Z ..... (S&amp;F, p. 183) Figure 1 Although Levi-Strauss simply offers the matrix as a "structural model," its elaboration can make the concept of "structure" clear in terms of positions. What the matrix does-what the structures of structuralism do-is to create empty slots or positions which are defined, "diacritically," in relations with other positions in a struc-</page><page sequence="2">M L N 1123 A ................. 1-A. . .... 1/A Figure 2 ture. In this matrix different symbols-W, X, Y, Z-representing different narrative events (Propp's "functions") are inscribed in a network which also defines a system of logical relationships-W, -W, 1/W, 1-W-among those events, a system of their possible transformations. Thus the matrix offers a paradigmatic network of logical relationships among narrative events-a logic of dis- course: W, - X, 1/Y, 1-Z-rather than the fixed chronological (syntagmatic) order Propp described and numbered in the Mor- phology. The network of logical relationships, of structural positions, has been defined by A. J. Greimas as the "elementary structure of sig- nification." He calls this structure "a double relation of disjunction and conjunction" and inscribes it in the "semiotic square."2 The semiotic square is a schema that inscribes three logical relation- ships (Figure 2): contrary relationships of the reciprocal presuppo- sition of binary opposition (A - A); contradictory relationships of the "absolute absence" of the elements of the binary opposition (A -1/A) in which the latter position (1/A) is categorically different from the former; and finally complementary relationships of simple presupposition or implication (A -1-A) in which the latter posi- tion (1-A) presupposes the existence of the former (A) ("Interac- tion," pp. 87-91). These three logical relations-which, in the con- text of phonology N. S. Trubetzkoy has denominated "privative," "equipollent," and "gradual" (or "arbitrary")3- exhaust the logical possibilities of binary opposition. A contrary (or "privative") rela- tionship creates a double relation of conjunction and disjunction in terms of the presence or absence of some shared feature; a contra- dictory (or "equipollent") relationship creates that double relation in terms of a shared function; and a complementary (or "gradual") relationship creates that double relation in terms of a shared situa- tion (that is arbitrarily defined). Thus in phonology, as Geoffrey Sampson notes, Trubetzkoy</page><page sequence="3">1124 RONALD SCHLEIFER AND ALAN VELIE distinguishes between (i) privative oppositions, in which two phonemes are identical except that one contains a phonetic 'mark' which the other lacks (e.g., If! - /v/, the 'mark' in this case being voice), (ii) gradual oppo- sitions in which the members differ in possessing different degrees of some gradient property (e.g. /I/ - /e/ - ae/, with respect to the property of vowel aperture), and (iii) equipollent oppositions, in which each member has a distinguishing mark lacking in the others (e.g. /p/ - It! - /k!).4 The Boolean matrix Levi-Strauss presents in "Structure and Form" elaborates these relationships to suggest a logic of narrative discourse. Following this suggestion, in Structural Semantics Greimas takes great pains to reduce Propp's thirty-one chronolog- ical narrative functions to the three logical categories. (It is in Structural Semantics that he first formulated the relationship that became the semiotic square ["Interactions," p. 88.]) To give one example of this reduction (Figure 3), we can note that Greimas argues that Propp's narrative function #5, information, is logically contrary to inquiry (function #4), and it is contradictory to recogni- tion (function #27), whose own contrary, marking (function #17) implies information. (In Structural Semantics Greimas' translations of the names of Propp's functions from the English translation of Morphology are not always precise; see SS, pp. 223-24). The four functions, related in this way, create one moment in what Greimas calls the discursive category of "communication" or "knowledge" that transcends the necessary temporal ordering that Propp claims for his numbered functions (see SS, Chapter 11, and p. xlvii). Greimas has related four narrative functions, W, X, Y, Z, in a logic of discourse, W, - X, 1/Y, 1-Z. In so doing Greimas creates the basis of an "actantial" analysis of narrative, what might be called a "semantic syntax" of narrative. Actantial analysis, however, delineates more than a grammar for the syntax of narrative events. What Greimas defines as "actants" information (A) ............. inquiry (-A) marking (1 -A).. ............ recognition (1/A) Figure 3</page><page sequence="4">M L N 1125 are constant narrative roles that recur in the discourse of narrative events and functions-roles which particular narrative actors as- sume in narrative in the same way that particular words and phrases in sentences assume syntactic roles (e.g. subject, object, etc.). "If it is remembered," Greimas notes, that functions, according to traditional syntax, are only roles played by words ... a proposition, in such a conception, is indeed only a drama which homo loquens produces for himself. The drama has, however, this peculiarity, that it is permanent: the content of the actions is forever changing, the actors vary, but the dramatic utterance stays always the same, for its permanence is guaranteed by the unique distribution of its roles. (SS, p. 198) Levi-Strauss' matrix and the logical relationships it describes can thus be seen to inscribe the roles assumed by the characters of nar- rative as well as the events performed by them. In fact, in his cri- tique of Propp Levi-Strauss says that each of the characters of nar- rative "far from constituting a single entity-forms a bundle of distinctive features like the phoneme in Roman Jakobson's theory" (S&amp;F, p. 182). The bundle of distinctive features are features which relate the characters to other characters diacritically (para- digmatically) so that the characters of Russian wondertales-and of myths as Levi-Strauss describes them-not only do not consti- tute single entities, but cannot exist outside of the relationships among the roles of discourse. Thus in terms of narrative roles-in terms of actants-Levi- Strauss' grid can be read two ways, as sets of individual roles desig- nated W, X, Y, and Z, and as a set of relationships between those roles designated W, - W, 1/W, and 1-W. Such a double reading, we will argue, can achieve what Greimas calls "the elaboration of a general theory of genres" by effecting the distribution of actantial roles (W, - W, 1/W, 1-W) to the characters or actors of discourse (W, X, Y, Z).5 It can do so, moreover, because, as Greimas notes elsewhere, genres do not constitute a particular "zone" of signifi- cation, but rather a realization of the structure of language. "The domain of literature," he writes, distinguishes itself from other domains (religion, law, etc.) not because it is characterized by a particular zone of content-substance. On the contrary, the content-"forms" which seem at first to define its domain (tropes and genres) are metalinguistic in relation to particular natural</page><page sequence="5">1126 RONALD SCHLEIFER AND ALAN VELIE languages [naturelles langues] and form a part of the general structural properties of language in general [langage].6 Greimas is asserting the relationship between genre and the ele- mental structure of signification. Actants are situated between what Greimas calls these "deep structures" and "discursive struc- tures" of particular texts, on what he calls the "semio-narrative" level, and as such, like genre, they mediate between meaning and manifestations Thus it is that genres can be "elaborated," struc- turally, in actantial terms. Actants Levi-Strauss himself did not intend to restrict the possibilities of his matrix to four elements-its purpose in "Structure and Form," in fact, is not to designate narrative roles, but narrative events- and no structural analysis reduces the basic roles of narrative dis- course to only four. Propp, as we have noted, designates seven narrative roles, which he calls the "dramatis personae" derived from their "spheres of action" in narrative: villain, donor, helper, princess or sought-for person and her father, dispatcher, hero, and false hero.8 In Structural Semantics Greimas reduces Propp's seven dramatis personae to six actants based on syntactic catego- ries (Figure 4), and he partially positions them within three rela- tional categories: sender vs. receiver, subject vs. object, and helper vs. opponent. Greimas claims that these six actants are found in all forms of narrative, including what he calls the "narrative pro- gram" of other forms of human relationships-a businessman's relationship to his firm, for instance, or a revolutionary's concep- tion of his relationship to the class struggle.9 Nevertheless, a com- parison of the "actants" of Propp and Greimas suggests that four of Greimas' actantial roles position themselves within a logical net- work which implies an actantial typology of literary genres. In this comparison there are four categories that Propp and Greimas clearly share: villain (false hero)/opponent, helper (donor)/helper, princess (sought-for person)/object, and hero/subject. In Greimas' actantial terms inscribed here are subject vs. object and helper vs. opponent. Propp completely leaves out Greimas' category receiver and doing so he confuses the role of the sender (which for Greimas is presupposed by the receiver) with that of object. This is quite suggestive because this last category, sender vs. re-</page><page sequence="6">M L N 1127 Propp Greimas Hero subject Princess (Sought for Person (and her father)) object Villain opponent False Hero Helper helper Donor Dispatcher sender (father) ---------- receiver Figure 4 ceiver, articulates the situation of linguistic activity, while the other actantial categories help describe semio-narrative relationships within a message. "Linguistic activity," Greimas writes, creative of messages, appears first as the setting up of hypotactic rela- tionships between a small number of . . . functions, actants, contexts. It is thus essentially morphemic and presents a series of messages as algo- rithms. However, a systematic structure-the distribution of roles to the actants-is superimposed on this hypotaxis and establishes the message as an objectivizing projection, the simulator of a world from which the sender and the receiver of a communication are excluded. (SS, p. 134) Linguistic activity begins with a relationship between sender and receiver, but the systematic structure of its message "excludes" that relationship. Thus it would seem to be legitimate to exclude the category sender vs. receiver from a general theory of genres de- termined by the systematic distribution of actantial structures. Nevertheless, throughout his work Greimas notes that what best characterizes literary genres are not the actants themselves which, as we noted, he takes to be universal categories that allow the apprehension of significance beyond the limits of the sen- tence'0-but rather the "fusion" or "syncretism" of actants. Thus Greimas notes that Propp does not "fill" the category of "receiver" in his description of the dramatis personae of the Russian folktale. "As for the receiver," he writes, "it seems that, in the Russian folk- tale, his field of activity is completely fused with that of the sub- ject-hero. A theoretical question that can be raised about this point, one that we will return to later, is whether such fusions can</page><page sequence="7">1128 RONALD SCHLEIFER AND ALAN VELIE be considered as pertinent criteria for the divisions of a genre into subgenres" (SS, p. 204). Later, he does argue such fusions are per- tinent: The first typological criterion . . . can well be the syncretism, often re- corded, of the actants. We can thus subdivide the models into genres, according to the nature of the actants which let themselves be syncre- tized: in the folktale, we have seen, the subject and the receiver consti- tute an arche-actant, in the model of economic investment, in turn, the arche-actant is realized by the syncretism of the object and receiver, and so forth. Taken in the nonaxiological domain, the example can be made clearer: thus the queen, in the game of chess, is the syncretic arche-ac- tant of the bishop and the rook. (SS, p. 211) While the chess example makes the syncretism Greimas is de- scribing clearer, it also obscures the generic property of this phe- nomenon. It does so because it obscures the fact that the actantial role of receiver is not one role among others that is simply exem- plificative, but that it is the particular syncretic position of actantial analysis. Thus, in order to distinguish between two texts in Mau- passant Greimas notes that he has to make "a fundamental point, that of the choice of the receiver."11i Moreover, Greimas notes repeatedly the special status of sender as an actant and thereby implies the special status of the receiver. "One major purpose of the actantial position Sender," he says in Maupassant, "consists in transforming an axiology, given as a system of values, into a syntagmatic agent [ope'ratoire]" (Maupassant, p. 62). The sender, he notes elsewhere, "properly understood, is only the incarnation at the level of anthropomorphic grammar of the universe of values."'2 The receiver, then, is a passive role dif- ferent from the others; it is "chosen" by the sender to receive what the sender never relinquishes, cultural values that are simulta- neously immanent-that is received by an actor-and transcen- dent, "inscribed within the very prescriptions of [the] language" which articulates them.'3 Thus the receiver is always syncretized with another actantial role while the sender both transcends the "objectivized" message and participates in it insofar as it designates one of the actants of its "systematized structure" as its receiver. Because of this, the linguistic message can never fully project "a world from which the sender and the receiver of a communication</page><page sequence="8">M L N 1129 are excluded." It is precisely this "supplemental" distribution of axiological, cultural values, as we shall argue, that creates the possi- bility of an actantial typology of genres. The Structure of Actants If the relation between sender and receiver articulates the situa- tion of linguistic activity, then the other actants establish the mes- sage as an objectivizing projection of a simulation of the world by superimposing upon the elements of language trans-sentential structural relationships that can be meaningfully apprehended. In other words, they allow discourse to be apprehended as a "mean- ingful whole" (SS, p. 59). In literary studies such "wholeness" is what is defined (more or less) by genre. Before turning to literary genres, however, we should look once more at the logic of Greimas' actants in relation to Levi-Strauss' matrix. "Analytical ex- perience," Greimas writes, -both our own and that of other semioticians-has convincingly dem- onstrated that to account for texts even a little complex, it is necessary to consider exploding any actant into at least four actantial positions which can be presented, following the terminology proposed by Jean-Claude Picard, as: Actant Antactant Negantactant Negactant (Maupassant, p. 63) Beginning with the subject we can invest this scheme with Greimas' actants from which the sender and the receiver are excluded (Figure 5). If we adopt the actants named in parentheses as four basic character roles, we can note that Levi-Strauss' matrix, in- scribing these actants defined relationally (W, -W, 1/W, 1-W), Subject Anti-subject W (hero) - W (opponent/villain) 1 -W (helper) 1/W (object/heroine [sought-for person]) Not anti-subject Not subject Figure 5</page><page sequence="9">1130 RONALD SCHLEIFER AND ALAN VELIE suggests four modes of discourse and four actantial structures of narrative genres. We will designate these four modes heroic, agonistic, synec- dochical, and ironic, and the four types of narrative melodrama, tragedy, comedy, and "ironedy." These generic terms obviously bear a relationship to the categories Northrop Frye designates in the "Theory of Myths" in the Anatomy of Criticism, and the nature of actantial modes we are describing is related to Frye's "Theory of Modes." In the Anatomy Frye describes modes in terms of the quality of the actants-what Propp calls the "spheres of action" of dramatis personae. Thus in the mode of Romance, for instance, the hero is superior in "degree" to "man" and "nature," while Frye describes the genre of Romance in terms of its formal relationship to theme.'4 The distinction between mode and genre implicit here corresponds to that of Alastair Fowler in Kinds of Literature. "The terms for kinds," he writes of genres, "perhaps in keeping with their obvious external embodiment, can always be put in noun form ('epigram'; 'epic'), whereas modal terms tend to be adjec- tival."'5 To determine a mode by the power of action of the hero describes the modal quality of a discourse, while to determine a genre by an "external embodiment" providesformal distinctions. In later sections we will see how Greimas' actantial terms allow the structural classification of both the modality and the formal, "external embodiment," of literary forms, but here we should ex- plore the important differences between Frye's categories and ac- tantial categories. The most important is the fact that Frye's cate- gories are based on content rather than the positions of logical relationships: Frye determines each genre by particular mythic content and each mode by positive attributes of the personae mea- sured against particular qualities in the world. In this Frye is for- malist rather than structuralist; he seeks to organize content for- mally rather than to apprehend a logical structure of its embodi- ment. As Levi-Strauss says in his critique of Propp, "Form is defined by opposition to content, an entity in its own right, but structure has no distinct content: it is content itself, and the logical organization in which it is arrested is conceived as a property of the real" (S&amp;F, p. 167). Thus Tzvetan Todorov notes that, in Frye, the structure formed by literary phenomena manifest themselves at the level of these phenomena-i.e. these structures are directly observable. Levi-</page><page sequence="10">M L N 1131 Strauss writes, on the contrary: "the fundamental principle is that the notion of social structure is not related to empirical realty but to the model constructed according to that reality." To simplify, we might say that in Frye's view, the forest and the sea form an elementary structure; for a structuralist, on the contrary, these two phenomena manifest an abstract structure which is a mental construction and which sets in op- position, let us say, the static and the dynamic. 16 By "abstract structure" Todorov means the kinds of logical rela- tionships that Greimas and Levi-Strauss abstract and respectively articulate in terms of the positions of the semiotic square and the Boolean matrix. In these terms, actantial categories are structural; they are posi- tions determined by the relationship between actants. Moreover, the logical organization of actants-the "abstract" logical relation- ships between actantial roles-"arrest" an organization of "con- tent," a typology of modes and genres. They do so because actants and the genres and modes they organize-are located between the abstract and the concrete just as structure for Levi-Strauss me- diates between content and logic. Thus the heroic mode is defined by the position of the hero in relation to other actants, and the nar- rative genre of melodrama "discursivizes" (as Greimas says) that position: the hero faces an opponent or series of them, defeats them and achieves revenge and glory. In the agonistic mode the hero is positioned differently so that, made discursive in tragedy, the hero's struggle with his opponent proves fatal to both because he shares some quality or "flaw" with the opponent. The other modes define the hero-subject through repositionings which imply different generic forms. In comedy hero and heroine are equal partners in the struggle with the opponent; they win and marry. In ironedy the hero lives with the realization of his failure, which is also the realization of self-division, a hero who is not a hero. The structural logic of these actantial positions becomes clear with the superposition of Levi-Strauss' vertical column on Greimas' square inscribed in Figure 5. Thus, in Figure 5, W is the subject-hero. - W is the opposite of the hero, the anti-hero or vil- lain. The relationship between W and - W is a contrary relationship of reciprocal presupposition. 1/W is the inverse of the hero, the heroine or sought-for person, that is categorically different from the hero: as we shall see, the heroine is not simply a female hero. The relationship between W and 1/W is a contradictory relationship.</page><page sequence="11">1132 RONALD SCHLEIFER AND ALAN VELIE 1-W is the complement of the hero, the helper. The relationship is a complementary relationship of simple presupposition. Hero - Villain (W - W). Both villain and heroine are in some sense in opposition to the hero, but the principle of opposition is different. Villain and hero are in contrary opposition in which the opposition is based upon the absence or presence of some feature. Hot and cold are such an opposition-cold is the lack of heat, heat the absence of cold-and neither element is conceivable without the other. The hero and villain are opposed on the basis of good- ness as opposed to evil, which is the lack of goodness. Still, as we shall see, the relative goodness and evil of the hero and opponent vary widely according to genre as the position of these actants in relation to the other actants changes. Hero - Heroine (W - 11W). The hero and heroine, on the other hand, are in contradictory (or equipollent) opposition. Tradition- ally, the hero and the sought-for person are opposed on the basis of sexuality, male vs. female, terms which are equivalent but categori- cally different. Greimas marks this categorical difference in terms of function in his analysis of Maupassant's "la Ficelle" in which he notes that "the category of sex" in the story divides "two distinct types of activity": men shop and bargain while women sell so that "masculine activity is in large part verbal while feminine activity is a quasi-physical activity of the economic order." "Such distribution of activity according to sex," Greimas continues, "is clearly not rel- evant to the 'referential' plane: another relevance, within the semantic organization of discourse, must be sought to account for it."'17 That is, sexual difference is neither an absolute and positive "content" nor is it simply a "formal" arrangement imposed upon experience to make it comprehensible. Rather, as Levi-Strauss says, it is the "logical organization" in which "content" is "arrested and conceived as a property of the real." As a "logical organiza- tion," it can be inscribed within the elementary structure of signifi- cation. This is why Greimas defines the "heroine" simply as an "object" of desire, not even a "sought-for person," but a sought-for "good" (SS, p. 232). But as "a property of the real," sexual differ- ence has palpable social and semantic effects, effects which cannot simply be "formally" eliminated by changing the terminology. Thus throughout our analysis we will use the traditional term "heroine" as well as more abstract designations since that very tra-</page><page sequence="12">M L N 1133 ditional employment will often clarify the "real" meaning-effect of this actantial role in literary genres. But even here the term should be understood to designate a structural position rather than a sexual stereotype, even when that position is inhabited by a female person, as it often is in narrative. Hero - Helper (W 1-W). Finally, the contrary relationship be- tween the hero and villain and the contradictory relationship be- tween hero and heroine are different from the relationship of hero and helper. Unlike both of these, the helper simply presup- poses and complements the hero whom he or she helps, and it is possible to conceive of heroes without helpers. Thus Greimas de- scribes the helper in terms of abstract "forces in the world" more or less realized, so that in some discourse it can be seen simply as the "power of acting" of the hero himself (SS, pp. 206, 280). Actantial Modes When Levi-Strauss' matrix is read vertically, column by column, the relationships among the actants change, and with those rela- tional changes the literary modes we have designated define them- selves. That is, literary modes define themselves when the matrix is followed from top to bottom (W, - W, 1/W, 1-W). (See Figure 9 below.) The first begins with W (the actantial "hero" in our invest- ment) and defines, or structurally articulates, the heroic mode; the second begins with - X (the "villain") and defines the agonistic mode; the third begins with 1/Y (the "heroine") and defines the synecdochical mode; and the fourth begins with 1-Z (the "helper") and defines the ironic mode. In this way each symbol in the matrix (W, X, Y, Z) defines an actantial role and each column describes a particular mode of narrative defined in terms of the relationships defining those roles. Actantial modes, then, simply classify texts according to their "focus" upon one or another of these basic actants. By "focus" we mean that in these narratives different actantial roles assume the position of Greimas' (syntactic) Subject. Thus when we described the structure of actants in Figure 5, we had, in fact, defined a par- ticular mode of narrative, the heroic mode of what we shall call W stories. In W stories, stories that "focus" on the hero, it is the hero standing by himself, as it were, that defines the relationships be- tween himself and the other actants and thus the quality of those</page><page sequence="13">1134 RONALD SCHLEIFER AND ALAN VELIE Subject Anti-subject - X (villain) 1/X (sought-for good) X (hero) I 1-X (helper) Not anti-subject Not subject Figure 6 actants and the value of the narrative. Such narratives are ex- tremely common. Most tragedies center around a tragic hero, al- though there are those like Richard III which focus on a villain. Epics like The Odyssey, romances like Parsifal, or modern thrillers like Raiders of the Lost Ark are all hero-centered stories, as are most narratives of initiation. What distinguishes these stories is the re- ciprocal presupposition of the hero and villain. Propp's wonder- tales fit the scheme of Figure 5, and the fact that he (and later Levi-Strauss) used such stories to attempt morphology and struc- turation of narrative seems appropriate from the fact that its rela- tional structure is privileged: both vertical and horizontal readings of Levi-Strauss' matrix position the actants in a way that corre- sponds to the semio-logical categories of Greimas' semiotic square. It is for the same reason that we used this narrative mode to articu- late the structure of actants. In the agonistic mode of X stories the opponent is the focal point (Figure 6). Here, in the relationship between the opponent and the hero the hero presupposes the opponent. Such stories would in- clude tragedies in which the hero is or becomes the villain, like Macbeth or Richard III. Marlowe's The Jew of Malta, which we would classify as melodrama, is another example. Comedies like The Mer- chant of Venice, Volpone, or Miles Gloriosus in which the blocking characters (opponents), Shylock, Volpone, and Pyrogopolynices, are more important than the lovers, are modally agonistic. Unlike W stories, in X stories the hero shares some negative quality with the villain or opponent. The synecdochical mode of Y stories focus on the heroine (Figure 7). These narratives must focus on the heroine as a sought-for Subject Anti-subject 1/Y (heroine) 1-Y (helper) - Y (opponent) Y (hero) Not anti-subject Not subject Figure 7</page><page sequence="14">MLN 1135 good, and not simply a female hero. By this criterion, The Duchess of Malfi or Mrs Dalloway would not qualify, but stories in which damsels in distress are rescued, of the Perils of Pauline sort, would. Clarissa is a novel which focusses on the heroine as heroine rather than female hero. Pamela is a heroine story and Shamela is a parody precisely because it transforms the heroine into a female hero. Gothic romances told from the point of view of the terrified her- oine are also examples. What distinguishes these stories is that the heroine is presupposed by the opponent, who is quite often a family member (e.g. New Comedy) or a suitor (e.g. Clarissa). A play like A Doll's House might be seen as either a heroic or a synec- dochical narrative, but we prefer to classify it as modally synecdo- chical because of the subordinate role Nora plays throughout the drama-even the title makes her into a "good," namely a doll- even though she becomes heroic in the end. A Doll's House is an example that helps to articulate the structural distinctions we are making: Nora is a "hero" whose sought-for good is not a "heroine" but the quality of heroism her society denies her but grants to her opponent, her husband. But he is the opponent only insofar as he is married to Nora, that is, only by presupposing the heroine. Can- dida, on the other hand, seems clearly to be simply a heroic drama with a female hero. There are narratives in which the sought-for good (Greimas' "object") is not the heroine but something else, but in these narra- tives the sought-for good is seldom in an equipollent relationship with the hero and they are usually modally heroic. Examples of works in which the sought-for good does share dominance with the hero to some extent are those in which that good takes on symbolic significance. These include Grail stories like Parsifal, or modern quest stories like The Treasure of Sierra Madre, or Raiders of the Lost Ark. Thus in calling this mode synecdochical we are following Kenneth Burke's description of the four major tropes in which metonymy is "reductive"-the either/or of the agonistic mode while synecdoche is "representative"-the inclusive both/and of symbolic and comic modes of discourse. For Burke metaphor is the trope of "perspective" which, like the heroic mode, measures all relationships from the vantage of the hero-subject.'8 The final actantial mode is ironic, Z stories in which the helper is the focal character (Figure 8). "Rumpelstiltskin" is a good example of a folktale in the ironic mode because it demonstrates the way the helper is presupposed by the heroine: the little man is more</page><page sequence="15">1136 RONALD SCHLEIFER AND ALAN VELIE Subject Anti-subject 1-Z (helper) Z (hero) l/Z (heroine) - Z (opponent) Not anti-subject Not subject Figure 8 important than the heroine. By "important" we mean that his nar- rative action functions more explicitly and more centrally in the un- folding narrative than that of the girl whom he helps weave straw into gold. Greek and Roman New Comedies which feature clever slaves may be classified as helper stories in the same way. Davos in The Woman of Andros is an example of a helper who is more impor- tant than the hero, who is unimpressive, and the heroine, who never appears on stage. The clearest examples of the ironic mode, however, are stories in which the helper appears as the sidekick. Famous sidekicks include Sancho Panza, Huck's Jim, Falstaff, Nick Carraway, and the Gabby Hayes/Andy Devine sort of geezer in Hollywood horse operas. In most cases this sort of helper is subor- dinate to the hero (that is, they are heroic stories [Figure 5]), but Sancho Panza is in a relationship of reciprocal presupposition with Don Quixote, and Falstaff overshadows Hal in the way the hero overshadows the villain in the heroic mode. In fact, Falstaff in many ways identifies the helper actant and also helps to define the identification of the actantial role of helper with the ironic. Thus Burke notes that "I would consider Falstaff a gloriously ironic con- ception because we are so at one with him in his vices, while he himself embodies his vices in a mode of identification or brother- hood that is all but religious. Falstaff would not simply rob a man, from without. He identifies himself with the victim of a theft" (p. 515). To put this in "positional" or structuralist terms, Falstaff de- fines the helper as an actant in an equipollent relationship with the opponent. Actantial Genres If actantial modes are defined by the relationships existing be- tween actants-if they are a function of the "focal" actant defined relationally-then actantial genres, like those of Frye and Fowler, are defined formally, in relation to the criteria for what Fowler calls their "external embodiment." Now the actants that "embody" such</page><page sequence="16">M L N 1137 external factors in Greimas' structural semantic narratology are, as we have seen, the sender and the receiver. The formal relationship that defines actantial genres, then, is the syncretic relationship be- tween one of the "internal" actants and the receiver. It is the re- ceiver that is left with the transcendental cultural values at the end of a narrative program. In the examples Greimas gives in Struc- tural Semantics, the subject-hero of the Russian wondertale is the receiver of the sought-for good-the Princess-while in the nar- rative of a capitalist, it is the object-the economic enterprise- that is syncretized with the receiver (SS, pp. 204, 210). In both cases the sought-for good embodies transcendental cultural values: receiving the Princess, the hero "receives" the state; while the en- terprise itself receives the values of the sender which Greimas des- ignates as the "economic system." What is most impressive about Greimas' actantial analysis is that it allows the structuration of "external" criteria; the actantial cate- gory sender vs. receiver inscribes within the "systematic structure" of discourse a category which "explodes" that systematicity. Unlike a linguist like Louis Hjelmslev, who attempts to articulate the logical relationships that obtain between the elements of language while bracketing the "content-substance" of language's referents, Greimas' semantics attempts to inscribe "content-substance" within language.'9 Such an aim is the project of genres altogether, which attempt to articulate and classify thematic-formal aspects of lit- erary discourse. That is, genre attempts what Greimas' semiotics attempts, to articulate structures of signification, of apprehended meaning. It is a form of what Elmar Holenstein calls "phenomeno- logical structuralism."20 Thus the controversies and arguments that surround generic studies reproduce those that surround se- mantics in general. Not only Greimas, but Levi-Strauss (along with Freud, Lacan, Marx, and even Frye and Fowler) can be said, in these terms, to be "semanticists." Greimas' semantics attempts to go, not only beyond the confines of the sentence, but beyond the confines of an abstract formalism such as Hjelmslev's and a con- crete formalism such as Frye's. Actantial analysis of narrative, he argues, describes both the qualities and the activities of actants. Describing qualities, it describes particular contents and delineates modes in terms of relational actantial positions; describing actions -he calls them "functions"- it describes narrative as such and de- lineates narrative genres in terms of the "action" of sender and receiver.</page><page sequence="17">1138 RONALD SCHLEIFER AND ALAN VELIE MODES: heroic agonistic synecdochical ironic GENRES I I I I melodrama W -X 1/Y 1-Z tragedy - W 1/X 1-Y Z comedy 1/W 1-X Y -Z ironedy 1-W X -Y 1/Z Figure 9 In this double reading-Levi-Strauss calls it "the double aspect of time representation" (S&amp;F, p. 183)-Greimas is following Levi- Strauss who inscribes his "structural semantics" in the Boolean ma- trix. That is, the matrix can be read horizontally as well as verti- cally (Figure 9), and here, rather than relationally defining actants, it defines narrative genres. Each horizontal line represents a dif- ferent genre: the top melodrama, then tragedy, comedy, and ir- onedy. The top line, melodrama, replaces Frye's category of ro- mance. Our objection to the term "romance" is not simply that it describes the mode of a work rather than a formal genre. More importantly, Frye believes "romance" implies particular content: he groups together works as diverse as Beowuif, The Faerie Queen, Pilgrim's Progress, and Uncle Tom's Cabin, because they exemplify some form or other of the quest myth. Genre, on the other hand, is an abstract semantic class of works-a "semio-narrative" classifi- cation-whose semantic structure defines a class independent of particular content. Rather than being defined by a positive content such as the presence of a "quest," it is defined by the logico-se- mantic relationships that inform its elements. Melodrama best describes that form of literature that embodies the heroic mode. The OED defines melodrama as a "dramatic piece characterized by sensational incident and violent appeals to the emotions, but with a happy ending"; Peter Brooks adds that it exemplifies an "aesthetics of excess" characterized by "heightened and polarized words or gestures." A popular definition in the Dic- tionary of Literary, Dramatic and Cinematic Terms defines it as a "drama wherein characters clearly virtuous or vicious are pitted against each other in sensational situations filled with suspense."2' These definitions are actantial, defining the melodramatic as we defined the heroic: as a confrontation of reciprocal roles (in which, from the "perspective" of the hero, the virtuous emerge victorious, and the vicious are crushed). Such a modal definition can be for- malized in actantial terms, in terms of the syncretism of one of its actants and the receiver. In melodrama the subject-hero is syncre-</page><page sequence="18">MLN 1139 tized with the receiver. This definition would extend the use of the term "melodrama" to include fiction and narrative verse as well as drama, and include the oldest extant example, The Odyssey, as a prototype of the form: the wily Odysseus (W) triumphs over or escapes from a series of opponents-Polyphemus, Circe, the Sirens, Scylla and Charybdis-before the climactic confrontation with the collective actant which serves as the major villain, the suitors (- X). With the aid of Eumaios and Athena who fills the role of helper (1-Z), Odysseus crushes the suitors and "receives" the heroine, Penelope (1/Y). In these terms, the Russian wonder- tale as Propp describes it-and the mythic discourse Levi-Strauss describes throughout his career-are melodramas: in fact, as Alan Dundes notes in the preface to Morphology of the Folktale, Propp's morphology accurately describes the second half of The Odyssey (p. ix). In the line which represents melodrama-W, -X, 1/Y, 1-Z- the hero of melodrama is positioned as W. This position is un- marked because the hero is properly heroic and triumphant: his triumph is embodied in the fact that he is also the receiver. In more general terms, when the matrix is read horizontally-that is, when it is read generically-the actant which is unmarked is the actant that is syncretized with the receiver. Melodrama has the sharpest differentiation between characters of any of the four actantial genres: the heroes are very heroic, and the opponents villainous and despicable. It is precisely the qualities of clarity and simplicity that allows Levi-Strauss and Greimas to reconceive Propp's description of a subset of melodrama, the Rus- sian wondertale, in structural terms. In fact, although Odysseus is an exception, the characters of melodrama are usually one dimen- sional, and their stereotypical nature is an important reason why so few melodramas are considered serious literature. The heroes are the essence of virtue, although what constitutes virtue differs dra- matically in different periods. Purity in the hero of a western film meant that the clean-cut cowboy drank sarsparilla, and blushed while talking with the schoolmarm. Today's cinematic heroes of melodrama, James Bond for example, are expected to drink liquor and womanize. What is most important, however, is that the hero embodies and receives in the end the cultural value, the sought-for good. All the examples of melodrama "focus" on the hero who defines the other actants in terms of himself: his degree of heroism de- fines the degree of villainy of the opponent; his worthiness defines</page><page sequence="19">1140 RONALD SCHLEIFER AND ALAN VELIE the value of the heroine or the sought-for good; his power defines the superfluousness of the helper. The opponent in melodrama, then, is the contrary to the hero, the essence of evil defined as the absence of virtue. He is a nightmare character who crystalizes our worst fears. Sometimes he is merely a human deficient in hu- manity, like Simon Legree or Lovelace; sometimes he is a monster from the depth of hell like Dracula or the shark inJaws. The her- oine of melodrama is beautiful and pure, the true essence of ste- reotypic femininity beset by evil, often explicitly or implicitly sexual. Nothing is so frightening as the scene in which the heroine lies asleep in bed while a monster prowls her bedroom. Whether the monster is a human who wants to shame her, like lachimo in Cymbeline, or a monster who wants to suck her blood in Dracula, the effect is the same. Often the dark figure grabs the girl and takes off over the rooftops, as in The Cabinet of Doctor Caligari or King Kong, and this iconic scene-helpless heroine, dark villain, hero watching in frustration below-is the essence of melodrama. In the end, the heroine, like the hero, embodies the cultural values of the work, and her receiver-hero obtains and realizes them. The helper of melodrama is a comic foil to the hero. In superficial terms at least, Falstaff appears to have set the pattern for modern helpers: he is funny, fat, bibulous, and cowardly. The modern sidekick of the western film, the Gabby Hayes, Monte Wooley, Andy Devine sort of clown are descendants of Falstaff, the imme- diate link probably being the drunk doctor and fat cowardly driver who make up the composite helper in Stagecoach, the prototype of the classic Hollywood western. Although most melodramas are subliterary, there are some great ones. Dickens favored the form: Great Expectations, Oliver Twist and David Copperfield, for example, are novels in which young heroes overcome formidable obstacles to eventually triumph. Shakespeare's Henry V is a classic example of melodrama, pitting the noble Henry and the brave English against the boastful Dau- phin and the despicable French. The showdown at Agincourt is the classic climax of melodrama. Both parts of Henry IV are melo- dramas, although they vary the pattern somewhat. In 1 Henry IV the moral distinction between Hal and the people loyal to Henry IV on the one hand, and Hotspur and the rebels on the other, does not seem to be a sharp one to us today. Hotspur certainly isn't evil like the villains of later melodramas. Nonetheless, when Worcester and Vernon keep Hotspur in the dark about the King's</page><page sequence="20">M L N 1141 offer of a truce and pardon, it becomes clear that the rebels' cause is wrong. Furthermore, Hotspur's speech on honor, which sounds so fine today, is less impressive in its context. Worchester, who hears it, remarks that "He apprehends a world of figures here, / But not the form of what he should attend" (I, iii, 209-10). In any case, 1 Henry IV climaxes with the traditional confrontation of melodrama. Hal tells Hotspur that England isn't big enough for both of them: "Two stars keep not their motion in one sphere; / Nor can one England brook a double reign" (V, iv, 65-66) and then kills him. 2 Henry IV is a weaker example of the form-it is a modally "agonistic" melodrama-but Shakespeare still follows the pattern of two opposed groups in a relationship of reciprocal pre- supposition. The next horizontal row of the matrix structurally articulates the genre tragedy which formally embodies the agonistic mode. Traditionally the term "tragedy" was used primarily for drama, but as a narrative genre we may use it to include novels like Lord Jim or Tess of the D'Urbervilles, romances like Le Morte D'Arthur or Le Chanson de Roland, or examples of minor narrative genres like the epyllion Venus and Adonis or Frost's narrative poem "The Death of the Hired Man." It is a critical commonplace that characters in tragedy are usually more complex than those of melodrama. Ex- amining the matrix may suggest a reason for this phenomenon. (See Figure 9.) As we move down the rows from melodrama to tragedy to comedy to ironedy, the differences between the actants become less distinct. The opposition between hero and opponent, based on virtue, is strongest in melodrama where the hero is ex- tremely virtuous, and the villain totally despicable. In tragedy the hero is a tragic hero, a figure Aristotle describes as a "man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error or frailty."22 The phrase "error or frailty" represents the critical disagreement as to what Aristotle meant by hamartia, but whether he meant a consti- tutional blemish or the commission of a grievous sin (that is what hamartia means in the New Testament), the tragic hero is more complex than the hero of melodrama because he is a combination of strengths and weaknesses, vices and virtues. He is a marked figure (- W). Here we can see that the two parts of Henry IV are melodrama disguised as tragedy insofar as Hal is apparently weak; his transformation, like that of the hero of the Russian wondertale Propp examines, is what Greimas calls the "revelation of the hero."</page><page sequence="21">1142 RONALD SCHLEIFER AND ALAN VELIE While there are tragic villains who approach the evil of those of melodrama-lago comes to mind-more often the opponent is complex and ambiguous, so that in Antigone and Creon, Romeo and Tybalt, Antony and Caesar, and even Hamlet and Claudius, we have a protagonist and antagonist rather than a hero and vil- lain. Even the exception, lago, helps define Othello as the most "heroic" of tragic heroes and the tragedy Othello as modally heroic. The line for tragedy on the matrix reads - W, 1/X, 1-Y, Z. If we observe the position of the terms in the lines as we descend through the rows, it is apparent that they rotate, much like players in volleyball. The hero, which was represented by the unmarked term in the top line (melodrama) is now the contrary. The villain is no longer the contrary to the subject-hero, but is in contradictory opposition to the unmarked term, now inhabited by the helper. The relationship of the first three terms indicates that the hero has declined from his flawlessly heroic state in melodrama. No longer are he and the opponent in a relationship of contrary opposition, one good, one not good, but in a relationship of equipollence, op- posed in what they want or stand for, like Antony and Caesar, Coriolanus and Aufidius, Jason and Medea, or Antigone and Creon. The heroine in tragedy often assumes more importance than she has in melodrama, which may be indicated by her desig- nation as complement, 1-Y. Tragedies are often stories of tragic pairs: Tristan and Isolde, Hero and Leander, Pyramus and Thisbe, Romeo and Juliet, Antony and Cleopatra. We cannot think of a single melodrama where the hero shares his billing with the heroine. The helper is represented by a unmarked term, and this indi- cates the syncretic fusion of helper and receiver. At the end of tragedy, unlike melodrama, it is the helper and not the hero that receives the transcendental cultural values. Horatio refrains from killing himself to help reestablish the state in Hamlet; Kent does the same in King Lear as does Creon in Oedipus. Very often, moreover, it is the helper, like Horatio, who lives to tell the tale: Ishmael in Moby-Dick, Marlow in Lord Jim and Heart of Darkness, Nick in The Great Gatsby, the wedding guest in "The Rime of the Ancient Mar- iner." It is as if what the helper receives is the ability to talk, the language that can convey cultural values even when everything is seemingly destroyed. Tragedy needs a helper precisely because it needs both to destroy what is-and the values "sent" to what is- and to assert its values discursively.</page><page sequence="22">MLN 1143 The third horizontal line on the matrix, 1/W, 1-X, Y, - Z, struc- turally articulates the genre comedy which formally embodies the synecdochical mode. Like tragedy, comedy is a term which tradi- tionally has referred primarily to drama, but may be extended to other narrative forms as well. The pattern established by Men- ander's New Comedy has been the dominant comic formula ever since the fourth century B.C.: a boy wants a girl but can't have her because of some obstacle, usually parental disapproval. By intrigue or luck the lovers overcome the obstacle to live together happily ever after. This formula was adopted by Plautus and Terence, and then disseminated thoroughly throughout Europe. Very few comic dramas in any subsequent period have used any other pat- tern, not simply because of this dissemination, but because of the semantic logic of the form. In Shakespeare's adaptation of the New Comedy formula sometimes the lovers are the focus of the play, as in The Taming of the Shrew or Much Ado about Nothing-both "synecdochical comedies"-and sometimes the opponent is, as is Shylock in the "agonistic comedy" The Merchant of Venice. At times the lovers are very minor characters who make an obligatory pres- ence for form's sake but play little part in the drama, as in the "ironic comedy" The Merry Wives of Windsor in which the story of Anne Page and Fenton provides the skeletal structure, but Falstaff provides the flesh and blood, so to speak. Ben Jonson's comedies of humors and Restoration comedies of manners follow the New Comedy pattern and, for all his insistence of the primacy of con- tent over form, Shaw uses the New Comedy pattern in plays like Major Barbara and Man and Superman. Broadway and Hollywood made it the basis of musical comedy, and in our day it remains popular in the works of playwrights like Neil Simon. Tom Jones, which Fielding called a "comic epic in prose," has many melodramatic moments, but is essentially an actantial comedy-an "heroic comedy"-constructed on the formula of New Comedy: after surmounting a series of obstacles, Tom marries Sophie. What distinguishes this from a melodrama is pre- cisely the nature of the marriage at the end. If Sophie is the sought-for good, Tom can hardly be said to inherit the state when he marries her, and if she "embodies" wisdom, it is a domestic rather than a transcendental wisdom. Such domesticity helps de- fine comedy. On the line of the matrix articulating comedy, the heroine becomes the unmarked term. The dominance of the her- oine is appropriate for a form which so often culminates in mar-</page><page sequence="23">1144 RONALD SCHLEIFER AND ALAN VELIE riage. More importantly, the softening of the oppositions which we had seen as we descended from melodrama to tragedy continues as we move from tragedy to comedy. In tragedy there are scat- tered examples of hero and heroine sharing the focus of the drama-Romeo andJuliet, Antony and Cleopatra-but in comedy it is the rule rather than the exception. Furthermore, the opponent is usually no longer the villain; more commonly parents are the op- ponent. There are exceptions: Volpone is a villain who acts as the opponent, but it must be noted that Volpone is modally heroic and very close to melodrama-in fact it might be argued from the se- verity of Volpone's punishment that Volpone is a melodrama. In opposition to melodrama-comedy is, in fact, the contradic- tion of melodrama-the hallmark of comedy is the roughly equal status of the characters. In both melodrama and tragedy the hero towers over the other characters and dominates the action and the audience's attention. In comedy the hero and heroine are a pair, the opponent plays a crucial role of opposition, and the helper is often of equal or even greater importance than the lovers, as in the case of Roman New Comedy, where the clever slave, who contrives the intrigue, is the center of interest in the play. Nevertheless, the heroine is the receiver: if tragedy asserts the cultural value of hu- manity in the destruction of the hero-a value that is verbalized (or "discursivized") by the helper-receiver-then comedy perpet- uates the natural value of humanity in the renewal of generation embodied in the heroine-receiver. She receives the hero not as statesman and warrior, but as husband. King Lear is the tragedy of growing old and having to relinquish the state, the supreme con- trary to melodrama; The Playboy of the Western World, whose "plot" in broad outlines repeats that of Lear, is the comedy of Christy's positioning himself to find a wife who will receive him. In these terms Tom Jones is a comedy precisely because Sophie receives Tom, not in order to articulate and pass on cultural values in dis- course as the helper-receiver does in tragedy, nor to articulate and embody human power as the hero-receiver does in melodrama, but to disarticulate the sharpness of actantial distinctions in a family constellation. It is a comedy because marriage softens the distinction between self and other. The last line of the matrix, 1-W, X, - Y, l/Z, formally articulates the ironic mode. We have chosen to call it ironedy as an obvious variation of Northrop Frye's genre of "irony," which suggests a mode rather than a form. In ironedy the hero faces obstacles, fails</page><page sequence="24">M L N 1145 to overcome them, and usually does not die but is trapped, and must live with his defeat. In ironedy, however, no helper of the hero is fused with the receiver: the values he embodies or seeks are "received" by neither the heroine, hero, nor helper, but by the opponent, the anti-hero. Ironedy is perhaps the most common form in modern fiction. Virtually all of Joyce's stories are ironedies, for instance. In "The Boarding House," a possible hero, Mr. Doran, believes he is se- ducing the heroine, Polly Mooney, while she is silently trapping him into a marriage he does not want. The story ends with his realization of the fact that he is condemned to a lifetime with a woman he may or may not love and he has a vague sense of "being had." (In Ulysses we see Doran again, roaring drunk and hiding from his family.) Here is ironedy disguised as comedy: the receiver is not the heroine, Polly, but rather the opponent, Mrs. Mooney, Polly's mother and the butcher's daughter. In "A Painful Case" James Duffy comes to the realization that "No one wanted him; he was outcast from life's feast." The last line of the story, "he felt that he was alone," could serve as the last line for "Counterparts," "The Dead," "Eveline," and indeed not only for all the stories in Dub- liners, but for any ironedy. In ironedy the focus shifts from hero to helper, who is usually an ineffectual parody of a hero. As in Joyce's epiphanies, there is really no story to tell-no narrative program -but rather sundry "epiphanies" that may or may not be taken as revelations. Ironedy is the contrary to comedy as it is the contradic- tory to tragedy: rather than sharp distinctions between actants al- most all distinctions are erased, so that it is difficult to distinguish between heroine and opponent, opponent and helper, helper and hero. In "A Painful Case," the opponent, Mr. Sinico, is also a kind of ineffectual helper, who "receives" the sought-for good in the end. "Captain Sinico," we are told, "had dismissed his wife so sin- cerely from his gallery of pleasures that he did not suspect that anyone else would take an interest in her." The striking fact of ironedy is that it so often approaches, as parody does, other genres: not only the comedy of courtship in these stories, but even the melodrama of the quest romance as in "The Dead." In the end Gabriel might become the receiver of Gretta (as, in his fantasies, he once had been) and achieve "heroic" stature in a westward quest; or his opponent, Michael Fury, may be the receiver (as he once had been) and Gabriel remain the "piti- able fatuous fellow" he sees in the mirror. The fact is, ironedy</page><page sequence="25">1146 RONALD SCHLEIFER AND ALAN VELIE gives no criteria by which to choose between these alternatives. It fails to do so not simply because, as Colin MacCabe has argued, Joyce eshews the metalanguage that authoritatively interprets the action in traditional fiction.23 Ironedy gives no actantial criteria precisely because it replaces the action of narrative with nonaction: "The Dead," like Ulysses (and like The Sun also Rises-which ends with the famous exchange "Oh, Jake, we could have had such a damned good time together." / "Yes. Isn't it pretty to think so."-), can only be authoritatively interpreted hypothetically, depending on what happens next, after the end of the narrative. Ironedy is a narrative genre, then, which replaces narrative with a kind of con- trary-to-fact subjunctive: it "explodes" narrative form so that the "functional" actantial analysis of narrative and genre approaches the qualitative analysis of modes. Here it is clear why Frye names this genre modally. Perhaps an example of ironedy's approach to tragedy ironedy disguised as tragedy-will make this clearer. Boswell's Life of Johnson can be read as tragedy: the helper Boswell receives and recites the narrative just as Nick does for Gatsby or Ishmael for Ahab. For years the Life has been read as Johnson's tragic en- counter with life in a corrupt world. Yet the receiver can also be understood as the opponent, Death, Johnson so feared throughout his life, and the whole can be read as the (ironic) story of Johnson being overwhelmed by life, of living for Death. Here again, the choice can only be decided by what happens next: by the quality of Johnson's afterlife. In a conventionally faithful age-or, in the case of Matthew Arnold, a desperately faithful one24 Johnson is the figure of modern tragedy; in an agnostic age, he is the figure of ironedy. Another ironedy approaching tragedy is Waiting for Godot. Drama is traditionally conservative in its adherence to forms, and until the middle of the twentieth century virtually all plays were tragedies, comedies or melodramas. The theatre of the absurd, however, has produced a number of plays which might be classed as ironedy. In Waiting for Godot Vladimir and Estragon are the joint hero, or perhaps hero and sidekick, there is no heroine, and the opponent, if there is one, could only be life or fate (but "fate" conceived as nonsensical, nondiscursive). Godot is the absent helper, and it is precisely the absence of the helper-who is the receiver in tragedy-that transforms tragedy to ironedy and dis- course into repetition. Without a helper for the hero, cultural</page><page sequence="26">M L N 1147 values-values beyond the individual-are impossible (which is why ironedy is the contradictory to tragedy). Godot, like Joyce's Dubliners and, perhaps, Boswell's Life, can be described as a non- agonistic tragedy, tragedy in which the opponent and the hero are indistinguishable. That is, with the progressive blurring of the oppositions between actants, actantial distinctions are at their weakest in ironedy. If Jake Barnes is the hero of The Sun Also Rises-and he certainly is in terms of the modal structure of the actants-then Robert Cohn would be the opponent. But the two are opposed less on the basis of virtue than style, the modern existential counterpart of virtue. Jake is heroic because he knows how to behave; he adheres to Hemingway's code of "manly" stoicism. Cohn's sin is that he is a whiner who has the bad form to inflict his misery on others. Bill Gorton, Jake's sidekick, is not so much a foil to the hero but an equal. And Lady Brett, the "heroine," is hardly distinguishable from her masculine counterparts: she refers to herself as a "chap," wears a man's hat, and adopts what Hemingway takes to be the masculine role of seducer. In this book that makes sexual differ- ence function to designate actantial difference such difference break down. Towards an Actantial Typology The position of the heroine in ironedy can help us to sum up the typology of narrative modes and genres in a final topology. In the Greimasian inscription of the ironic mode (see Figure 8), the her- oine inhabits the fourth position, which Fredric Jameson describes as "decisive" insofar as it forces a rethinking of the category as a whole, in which all the elements are seen in "a different frame- work of meaning."25 In each of the modes we have inscribed within the semiotic square this position helps to define the related literary form, the related genre. In the heroic mode, it is inhabited by the helper (Figure 5), which can be conceived of as an aspect of the hero, what Greimas calls "the heroic nature of the hero" (SS, p. 232). Such heroic power actantially defines melodrama, the lit- erary form in which characters are so relationally defined and so formally defined (in terms of the receiver), that the helper implies the hero who is the receiver of the sought-for good. In the ago- nistic mode the fourth position is inhabited by the "flawed" hero</page><page sequence="27">1148 RONALD SCHLEIFER AND ALAN VELIE (Figure 6) who implies the opponent and is in a relationship of reciprocal presupposition with the helper who is the receiver of the sought-for good. The position articulates, actantially, the flawed protagonist of tragedy. In the synecdochical mode it is in- habited by the opponent (Figure 7) who, in the purity of New Comedy, is a relative, usually a parent, of the heroine who, finally, is the receiver of the sought-for good. As such it creates the ob- stacles which, overcome in narrative, define comedy. And finally, in irony the fourth position is inhabited by the heroine who seems only a potential heroine, one about to be a sought-for good in a world where objects of desire are not clearly desirable. In this it describes a literary form, ironedy, in which possibility overwhelms action and destroys narrative discourse. Such, in any case, is a sketch of actantial modes and genres. What is most striking, we believe, is that Greimas' actantial catego- ries do, in fact, suggest a linguistic level of analysis, between the apprehended signification of the manifested discursive level, and the purely logical or structural analysis of the semantic level which allows the "semio-narrative" structures of actants26 to classify lit- erary texts in a generic structuralism.

To make the book more attractive, the editor replaced the word wondertale" with folktale. "But my intention," Propp continues, "was not to study all the various and complex types of the folktale; I examined only one strikingly distinctive type, viz., the folk wondertale" (p. 70). 2 A. J.

W. V. Quine notes that it is meaning beyond the limits of the sentence that constitutes the problem of meaning in linguistics; see "The Problem of Meaning in Linguistics," in From a Logical Point of View (New York: Harper, 1963), pp. 47-64. 11 A.

Francis Whitfield (Madison: U of Wisconsin P, 1961), argues that linguistics must establish itself as</page><page sequence="29">1150 RONALD SCHLEIFER AND ALAN VELIE a science of linguistic meaning-its content-"on an internal and functional basis" alone (p. 79), and to do so it must eschew all contact with "external" phenomenon. Thus for Hjelmslev, as Geoffrey Sampson argues, only content- form and expression-form are subject to linguistic analysis. The ostensible ref- erents or signification of language, what Hjelmslev calls the "content-substance" of language, and spoken sound or phonetics, what he calls the "expression-sub- stance," are "external" to language.
