<plain_text><page sequence="1">II.-THE USE OF ANALOGY IN METAPHYSICS. By DOROTHY M. EMMET. " THE procedure of rationalism," writes Prof. Whitehead,* " is the discussion of analogy. The limitation of rationalism the inescapable diversity." In this paper I shall consider metaphysics as a form of analogical thinking, and ask whether what we call a metaphysical system is not a Weltan- schauung based on analogy with something which has seemed significant in the experience of the metaphysician. I shall consider what is meant by " significance " in this connection; ask with what justification, if any, we draw these analogies from microcosmic to macrocosmic significance, and indicate where I should differ from the Thomistic view of the analogia entis. " In philosophy," says Kantt (introducing his Analogies of Experience), " analogies signify something very different from what they represent in mathematics. In the latter they are formulx which express the equality of two quantitative relations and are always constitutive, so that if three members of the proportion are given, the fourth is likewise given, that is, can be constructed. But in philosophy the analogy is not the equality of two quantitative but of two qualitative relations ; and from three given members we can obtain a priori knowledge only of the relation to a fourth, not the fourth member itself. The relation * Modes of Thought, p. 134. t See N. Kemp Smith's edition of the Critique of Pure Reason, p. 2 I I. A</page><page sequence="2">28 DOROTHY M. EMMET. however yields a rule for seeking the fourth member in experience, and a mark whereby it can be detected. An analogy of experience is therefore only a rule according to which a unity of experience may arise in perception. It does not tell us how mere perception or empirical intuition in general itself comes about. It is not a principle constitutive of the objects, that is the appearances, but only regulative- . . . By these principles, then, we are justified in combining appearances only according to what is no more than an analogy with the logical and universal unity of concepts." I shall reserve consideration of Kant's contention that analogies of experience are only regulative and not constitutive until I come to the general question of the justification of analogical thinking in metaphysics. In any case this is not a paper about Kant. But I want to draw attention to the point he makes in the first part of the passage I have quoted: that in philosophy analogy is used to suggest a qualitative, not a quantitative relation. By a quantitative analogy is meant a ratio such as 2: 4 :: 4: x, in which given knowledge of the three terms and the proportion we can determine the value of x. Does " qualitative " mean more than the looser way in which analogy is used as soon as we extend it from its mathematical sense of a relation of proportionate equality ?* As St. Thomas says,t " Proportio dicitur dupliciter; uno modo certa habitudo unius quantitatis ad alteram, secundum quod duplum, triplum et acquale sunt species proportionis; alio modo qualibet habitudo unius ad alterum proportio vocatur, et sic potest esse proportio creaturae ad Deum." I take quelibet here to mean " any " in the merely indefinite * C.f. Aristotle, Topics I, 17, where the formule of analogy are given as cO. -F pov irpor fTepOV rL, OVTcor &amp;XXo rpOS aXXo, and is erEpov Ev efr1p'c rTLv, vvTWS aIXXo ev iaXXo. Mr. Joseph (in his Introduction to Logic, p. 537) shows how when analogy comes to be used loosely to mean likeness it cannot be interpreted as pro- portionate relation without forcing the sense. t Summa Theologica, Ia, qu. 12, art. i.</page><page sequence="3">II.-THE USE OF ANALOGY IN METAPHYSICS. 29 sense of " any kind of relation of one thing to another" and not to mean " qualitative " in any special sense. This would answer to what is meant by analogy in popular and also in scientific use. In its popular sense an analogy is really little more than a metaphor; for example, the description of mind as a kind of telephone operator sitting somewhere in the brain receiving messages along the afferent nerves and transmitting messages down the efferent nerves to the muscles. This popular metaphor is misleading for the reason, amongst others, that there is no gap in the reflex arc which we can point to as the " seat " of the mind. But it is an instance of the type of popular analogy which is often advanced as though it amounted to an explanation. In the scientific use of analogy a partial resemblance between two different things is taken as suggesting a further resemblance. We reason from the presumption that if things have some similar attributes or functions or corre- lations of these, that certain of their other attributes or functions or their correlations will also be similar. But an analogy of this kind is used simply as suggesting a hypothesis needing further investigation, the probability of the hypothesis being strengthened, as every inductive logician knows, by the examination of instances of widely different types in which the similar characteristics occur or are correlated, and also by the relative importance of these characteristics. In this paper I am not proposing to discuss the scientific use of analogy as considered in inductive logic. The particular question I have set myself, namely, the metaphysical use of analogy, is one to which the treatment of analogy in inductive logic seems to me to be largely irrelevant. This is because in the inductive and scientific use of analogy we are reasoning from parallel cases, and are looking for a similarity of function or relation between different terms within experience. But the philosophical or metaphysical use of analogy seems to be peculiar in that the terms between which some likeness of relation is suggested belong essentially to different orders. For we are trying to draw analogies not merely between parallel A2</page><page sequence="4">30 DOROTHY M. EMMET. cases which are different elements within experience, but between something within experience and something about the nature of reality. The nearest approach to this jump from the part to the whole is the use of analogies in science not inductively, but to describe, e.g., the substantial nature of matter. Physicists presumably do not really believe that the ether is a sort of elastic fluid: when pressed they would probably say, as (I think) Russell does somewhere, that the " ether " represents the missing substantive of the verb " to undulate." But, nevertheless, such analogical models are of service in helping to bring a more intelligible unity into conceptions of the nature of the physical world. But when we come to metaphysical analogies, we are asking not only " How can we make the nature of the physical world more intelligible ? " (which might, as Kant says, only mean how can we find a rule for making a unity out of appearances), but " What is real? " And here what a metaphysician appears to do is to construct an imaginative theoretic model, drawn by analogy from whatever it is which has seemed to make most sense within his own experience. His system is a Weltanschauung, that is an intuition of and response to the world from the standpoint of some particular kind of intellectual or spiritual experience. So the first step in seeking to understand his system is to try to appreciate the kind of intellectual or spiritual experience through which he sees the world; and if we can enter into this with intellectual sympathy, if we gain nothing else, we should at least have the enlargement of imaginative vision which would come from seeing what the world looks like from this perspective. So we may see how Plato finds the key to metaphysics in a kind of intuitive perception of abstractions and the relations between them which is illustrated pre-eminently in mathematics ; Aristotle in a relation of " form" and "matter" to which he had evidently been led through his interest in tracing processes of change and particularly of biological growth. For Plotinus I think the key words would be "vision " and " intellectual beauty "; Spinoza writes his metaphysics to</page><page sequence="5">II.-THE USE OF ANALOGY IN METAPHYSICS. 31 explain the peculiar kind of peace which comes from accepting what you see to be necessary ; Hegel sees the world in terms of the movement of a sustained philosophical argument (would it be fair to say an argument which he believes must inevitably terminate in victory over all his predecessors and opponents ?). Bradley finds his clue in the unity of sentience; Whitehead (I think) in the feeling inspired' by the achievement of a certain kind of asthetic composition. It would be fascinating to pursue this further and to try and discover the particular kind of spiritual or intellectual experience which was evidently the most exciting and significant to each philosopher and which gave him the perspective from which he constructs his Weltanschauung, I believe that in addition to logical argument and criticism. in each case there will be found to be some such element, and it will be found that it is this element which gives its characteristic positive content to the system. I suggest McTaggart as a test case. Here, if anywhere, we have a sustained attempt to construct a rigorously demonstrated metaphysics. But even here, as Prof. Broad has shown, McTaggart has not really proved that the only kind of series which could form a determining correspondence hierarchy must be a series of minds perceiving each other. I suggest that the deciding factor leading McTaggart to this view was his mystical sense for affection, conceived as the perceiving of one mind by another, and that this part of his system is an analogical argument from this. All this might suggest that I am reducing metaphysics to a study of the psychological and temperamental idiosyn- crasies of metaphysicians. But I do not think this conclusion necessarily follows. For it is at least possible that meta- physicians who are capable of particularly vivid, though different, forms of intellectual experience, may in effect be able to appreciate certain aspects of reality to which those forms of intellectual experience are responsive. But this leads us directly to the question of the justification of drawing analogies from some selected microcosmic experi-</page><page sequence="6">32 DOROTHY M. EMMET. ence to the nature of the macrocosm. Can such analogies claim to do more than, as Kant says in the passage quoted above, provide us with a rule for making a unity out of appearances which is only regulative and not constitutive? In a paper in the Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society for 1937-38, Miss MacDonald complains that philosophers use words by analogy with their ordinary usage without giving the analogy any intelligible application. In this way they trade on our familiarity with the ordinary usage to make it seem that they are saying something significant. So concerning the Aristotelian distinction of form and matter she says (p. 306), " If the same gold is first a coin and then a ring we could say quite sensibly that one object has become another, though its material has remained the same throughout these changes. We might describe this by saying that ' This gold was a coin and is now a ring.' The use of the words ' matter' and ' material substance' is intended to suggest by analogy that an ' ultimate' something is related to different sets of ' essential " predi- cates at different times as a piece of gold is related to different shapes at different times." That metaphysical philosophy does use words in an analogical sense I agree; also that it is often guilty of not recognising this. But I do not believe that when, e.g., an Aristotelian analyses something into matter and form, or substance and attributes, he would say, if pressed, that he ever thought he was " discovering " its constituents in the same sense as a chemist does when he analyses water into hydrogen and oxygen (the word " analyse " is therefore in the former case clearly analogical). What he does think he is doing is something more like what Miss MacDonald says on p. 307: " What the philoso- pher does is to notice certain differences in our use of ordinary words which seem to require explanation by a theory about that to which the words are said to refer-" But whereas she continues, " but it may be that what is required is just a description of these different uses and their criteria " (meaning " criteria in sense experience" ?), I should suggest that what is required is a more explicit</page><page sequence="7">II.-THE USE OF ANALOGY IN METAPHYSICS. 33 recognition of the analogical character of such theories, and a closer inquiry into the justification of such analogical thinking. But I am sure that Miss MacDonald is right in saying that by using words which have well understood associations in ordinary usage, and not showing that he is using them analogically, a metaphysician may trick people into thinking that they understand something when they do not. What is needed is a closer study of the analogical element in the metaphysician's use of language, and a thorough attempt to see whether it can be justified. This paper cannot claim to be more than a preliminary sketch indicating the need for such an enquiry.* Of course, the most impressive attempt to show how by analogical thinking we can arrive at some positive metaphysical knowledge is the Thomist theory of the analogia entis. St. Thomas contends that we cannot predicate any property univocally of God and creatures, or as we might say, of transcendent and empirical being. " Similitudo intellectus nostri non sufficientur probat aliquid de Deo, propter hoc quod intellectus non univoce invenitur in Deo et in nobis." Nevertheless, predicates drawn from the relative perfections of creatures can be applied to God not merely equivocally but analogically. But the analogia entis which makes this possible is not the analogy of the properties of one thing to those of another (analogia proportionis seu attributionis) which, as we have seen above, may be merely metaphorical. It is an analogy of proportionality (analogia proportionalitatis) which asserts that there is a likeness in the relation of one thing to its properties and that of something else to its properties. * Mr. Mackinnon's recent Aristotelian Society paper " What is a meta- physical statement? " came into my hands after this paper was written, and so too late for me to take account of the important considerations he raises. But I think I find on page 21 of his paper a welcome independent support for part (though I suspect only part) of what I am trying to say here. The analogue through which Mr. Mackinnon would seek to see into the world is "-that highly complex unity which we call the self", which points, he holds, to a metaphysics of pluralistic realism.</page><page sequence="8">34 DOROTHY M. EMMET. So there is an analogy between the relation of the creature to its properties and of God to His properties, viz. Creature X uncreated Participated Being Non-participated Being If we ask how we know there is this proportionality in virtue of which we can say something by analogy concerning the relation of Absolute Being to its properties, there are as far as I can see two lines along which Thomistic philosophers justify this: (i) By the ontology of universals, as predicated of de- pendent and derivative beings through the " participation " of these in timeless and non-derivative Being. So a creature may be good or wise, but is not goodness or wisdom. God is not a member of a class of things of which we can predicate goodness or wisdom. But since goodness or wisdom in man are only possible through participation in God's timeless Being, which contains all universals formaliter, we can say that there is something in God which is to His Being as a man's goodness or wisdom is to his being. * This is said to be analogous to what we mean by goodness or wisdom in man eminenter. I am not clear what is meant by eminenter. The insistence by Thomists that words cannot be used univocally of God and creatures shows that it is not intended to imply the anthropomorphism of attributing, e.g., goodness or wisdom to God in the same sense as we attribute them to a man but in a superlative degree. But I am not clear just how this word enables their doctrine of analogy to steer its via media between the pitfalls of * The religious power of the theory of the analogia entis has been expressed most forcibly by Father Przywara in his book Polarity (English translation by A. C. Bouquet). He describes analogia entis as meaning that the nature of the creature, which is a process of becoming, may suggest similitudes of the nature of God on whom it depends, but that the essence of God, since it is not essence-in-becoming, but Necessary Being is in the end beyond the similitudes.</page><page sequence="9">II.-THE USE OF ANALOGY IN METAPHYSICS. 35 anthropomorphism on the one hand and of agnosticism on the other. (ii) Analogical argument is held by Thomists to be justified by the " laws of being."* Perfect Being, Ens Realissimum, is an ontologically necessary idea. This is not established by any form of the Ontological Argument (which in my opinion is the only way in which it might possibly be established-but to go into that would be far beyond the scope of this paper). It is arrived at from the empirical fact that something given exists, and that it might not have existed (is this empirical ?), from which we argue to the dependence of this contingent being on a prime cause which necessarily exists from its own essence, Ens Realissimum. But apart from any other difficulties we may raise concerning the Cosmological Argument,t the following special difficulties appear to me to be relevant in appealing to it as a justification for analogical reasoning. (a) Have we any prior non-analogical knowledge of Being which gives us a basis on which we can draw analogies as to its nature, or is not all our knowledge of Being analogical ? We meet Being in some determinate form of being and then describe it analogically, e.g., draw analogies from the mode of being of a man to that of a piece of coal or of a kangaroo. (b) Analogical reasoning permeates the metaphysical proofs of an Ens Realissimum, so that I find it difficult to see how they can claim an independent certainty which enables them to furnish a basis for analogy. For instance, St. Thomas' Five Ways+ imply the validity of causal analogies * Cf. for instance, Penido, Le rdle de l'analogie en theologie dogmatique, p. 53 ff., and 88 if.; and Garrigou-Lagrange, De Revelatione, Pt. I, p. 302 ff. t See, for instance, the article by Prof. Broad in the Journal of Theological Studies, vol. XL, number I. " Summa Theologica Ia, qu. 2, art. 3.</page><page sequence="10">36 DOROTHY M. EMMET. in stating the relation of God to the world. If we say that in expressions like " First Cause" the notion of Cause is used eminenter, I can only make sense of this by taking it to mean that it is used analogically, so we are back where we were. (c) The Cosmological Argument claims to show a basis for analogy in the dependence of contingent beings for the realization of their essences on Necessary Being whose essence is the same as its existence. According to Thomist ontology, this means that the exemplars of all created things are already contained in the essence of God on Whom they are dependent for the realization of the perfections proper to them. This enables us to draw analogies from these relative perfections to the necessary Being on whom they are dependent for their actualization. But I suspect that we may be misled here by interpreting " perfection" in too moral a sense. Does it say more than that there is an analogy between things which realize their ends qua realising their ends, and that this is what " Good " here means ? In fact, Thomism here appears completely to follow Aristotle in making " Good " an analogical con- ception,* meaning the realization by something of its end. But to say that Good as predicated of the Ens Realissimum means Ens Realissimum is the perfect realization of Being seems a tautology. I am led therefore to the conclusion that the Analogy of Proportionality can tell us nothing about the nature of transcendent Being. It can at most say an sit, not quale sit. (This agnostic interpretation of St. Thomas is, I believe, a possible one, and to take it is, of course, to recognize the force of my difficulty (a) above.) But Thomists do take analogical reasoning beyond this, using similitudes from the relative perfections of created things to say something about the nature of transcendent Being. And in this further use of analogy they would seem to be having recourse to the analogy not of proportionality, * Cf. Nicomachean Ethics, I, vi, 12. OVnK cOrtV Japa TO a'yaov oWvOV TI Kar 'a av .8es .... i7 ifXXov KaT' a'vaXoyLav.</page><page sequence="11">II.-THE USE OF ANALOGY IN METAPHYSICS. 37 but of proportion, or similitude of attributes, which, as we have seen above, is perilously near to metaphor. Moreover, it means making a selection of those types of function or relation which seem appropriate or illuminating as similitudes through which to try to see into the nature of transcendent Being. But on what ground is the selection made? According to Thomist principles, we should look on the universe as a hierarchical economy of things pursuing their ends without essential mutual frustration, and in this respect all things should be in their degree appropriate similitudes.* We should thus draw similitudes not only from the wisdom or goodness of a good man, but from good liver flukes and good mustard gas (that is, of course, so long as these are fulfilling a natural end-it might be argued that man's sinful ingenuity discovers unnatural uses for good mustard gas). But should we find ourselves (as I personally do) drawn to looking at nature as a study of the forms of process rather than of the procession of forms (to use a phrase of Whitehead's), we should have additional difficulty in using all modes of being in the fluent processes of nature as analogies of the nature of a necessary Being on which they depend. For, according to the medieval ontology, the necessary Being was held to contain the exemplars of the limited number of fixed kinds of which nature consisted; and the individuals of each kind actualized the end proper to them through the operation upon them of the necessary Being in whom that end was already formally realized. We thus have the processio ad extra of forms into the created * Przywara certainly appears to grasp this nettle when he says " The whole process of becoming from dead matter upwards to pure spirit, and from pure spirit downwards to dead matter, is the whole of it in the highest degree near to God and in the highest degree the similitude of God " (op. cit., p. 69). And again " The creature in its totality is a window whereby we see into the Being of God." But, nevertheless, like other Thomists, whern he comes to give illustrations of the types of perfection within the created world to be used as similitudes of the nature of God, he selects words like " wisdom," which he thinks appropriate.</page><page sequence="12">38 DOROTHY M. EMMET. world. But it may appear that the modes of being in the world of nature and of human life attain such relative perfections as they do attain as the result of some more fluent and experimental process than the procession of forms, and by a process moreover which appears to involve a considerable measure of conflict and frustration. In this case such analogies as we can draw from forms of experience within the process to the nature of the process as a whole, or as to the relation of the process to a trans- cevndent Being on whom it depends, would be more precarious. I have shown, moreover, that I cannot appeal to an independent knowledge of Being to provide the justification for metaphysical analogies, since any ontological statements I can make appear to be already to some degree analogical. I cannot therefore appeal to an independent knowledge of the " laws of being " to provide a basis for analogies, but must see into the laws of being, if at all, through analogies. And these analogies depend on selective judgments of what is significant. Then are they just creations of aesthetic imagination, or egoistic attempts to dominate the world in theory in terms of a merely personal reaction ? May they not deserve the stricture Bradley passes on those who claim to find their sense of significance in the experience of volition. " Volition gives us, of course, an intense feeling of reality; and we may conclude, if we please, that in this lies the heart of the mystery of things. Yes, perhaps ; here lies the answer for those who may have understood; and the whole question turns on whether we have reached an understanding. But what you offer me appears much more like an experience not understood, but interpreted into hopeless confusion. It is with you as with the man who, transported by his passion, feels and knows that only love gives the secret of the universe. In each case the result is perfectly in order, but one hardly sees why it should be called metaphysics."* * Appearance and Reality, p. 115 (2nd Edition).</page><page sequence="13">II.-THE USE OF ANALOGY IN METAPHYSICS. 39 What then should be called metaphysics ? If it were only in the end a man's personal reaction to the world, we might still ask why he reacts in this particular way, and, if he is a metaphysician, the answer probably in the end is because he finds he must. His reaction has not the immediacy of the artist, who is also concerned with precision in expressing his responses to experience. It is rather (to use a phrase of Kierkegaard's in another context) " an immediacy after reflection." The nearest approach to it in this respect is perhaps the judgment of the literary critic. A metaphysician must make as precise a clarification and critique as he can of forms of thought and experience and their categories. But when all this work of analysis and criticism is done he has somehow to convey his general impression of what it all comes to. This impression might be described as a " total assertion," to borrow a phrase of the late Professor Stocks'.* I do not know whether Stocks would have accepted the view I am suggesting here, but I find his distinction between total and partial assertions helpful at this point. A partial assertion is either a pro- position stating matter of fact or a logical proposition which can be brought into a coherent system with other propositions of the same type. A total assertion cannot be verified; it expresses a judgment concerning the nature of something as a whole. So we could make a number of partial assertions about a man, e.g., that he is bald, aged 45, keeps chickens, is an A.R.P. warden, etc., But if we say that he is a good man, we are making a total assertion which cannot be exhaustively analysed into a number of partial assertions of matter of fact. If we were asked why we think he is a good man, we might say that he looks after his old parents, gives away some of his eggs, spends his spare time on A.R.P., and the like. But it might be possible to make any number of partial assertions of this kind, and yet they would not mean the same as we mean when we * See his lecture On the Nature and Grounds of Religious Belief, reprinted in Reason and Intuition, p. 38 ff.</page><page sequence="14">40 DOROTHY M. EMMET. say that so and so is a " good " man. For it might be possible to enumerate a whole series of estimable acts and ways of behaving, and yet at the end of it all we might not be willing to say that so and so was a good man. (" Though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing "-" having charity " would appear to be of the nature of a total judgment, like saying .that someone is good.) The total judgment expresses our response to the man's character as a whole. Now metaphysical judgments seem to me to be some- thing of this nature. (Here again, I am driven to making an analogy.) The subordinate work of analysis and criticism is analogous to the statements about the way in which the man behaves, which we might cite as evidence if we were asked why we thought he was a good man. And in a sense they are evidence; and so also the critical and argumentative part of a work on metaphysics show considerations which point towards the final Weltanschauung. But the Weltanschauung expresses a total impression which is more than a strict inference from the subordinate critical discussions, just as the statement that a man is good is a response to his character as a whole which is more than a sum of the partial assertions which could be made about his behaviour. So in both cases there is a certain jump from the empirical evidence to the total impression. And because there is this jump, the total assertion cannot be proved ; it can only be exhibited and expressed in analogical language. So Parmenides, the father of metaphysics, speaks of Being as " complete on every side, like the mass of a rounded sphere, equally poised from the centre in every direction."* So also Plotinus speaks of creation in terms of inward vision, which with regard to the material world is combined with a ToAya or " act of rebellious audacity." Alexander speaks of the " restlessness of Space-Time" * Fragment 98, Ritter and Preller, Hist. Phil. Grace. (7th Edition).</page><page sequence="15">II.-THE USE OF ANALOGY IN METAPHYSICS. 41 McTaggart of the " perception" of minds by each other; Whitehead of the " appetition " of the world, and so forth. Some of these expressions are more boldly metaphorical than others, but we can surely only find any sense in any of them by regarding them as extrapolations to the world as a whole of analogies drawn from something within experience. But if we have no independent knowledge of the nature of real Being-the unknown fourth term to which our analogies point-we may well ask whether we have any criterion, beyond perhaps a sense of asthetic fittingness, to which we can appeal, and which may discipline our analogies. There must indeed come the point, as I said above, when they seem inevitable at least to the person who makes them. Beyond this, I recall what Whitehead says of metaphysical propositions in Modes of Thought (p. 66 ff.), that they cannot be proved; we can only appeal to their "self-evidence to civilized minds." I am not sure what " self-evidence" means in this context. It certainly cannot be meant in the rigorous sense of logical necessity. It may mean what Mr. Ryle has called somewhere the " Of course" with which we tend to greet a philosophical discovery. Possibly it also means that metaphysical propositions should make their appeal to reflective people as more than egoistic attempts to dominate the world in theory from the standpoint of some limited form of experi- ence, in that the analogies they contain should commend themselves as really shedding light (perhaps critical light) on the civilized thought, scientific, literary, religious, of an age, and should also show the power of exercising a certain creative influence on its intellectual imagination. This means that there is likely to be a certain shift in the philosophical analogies which will commend themselves as appropriate in different periods of thought. Therefore, as Whitehead says, a philosophical position is never disproved; it is only abandoned when it ceases to be relevant. Very few analogies can stand up to the criticism</page><page sequence="16">42 DOROTHY M. EMMET. of successive generations of thought; and since they must be disciplined empirically by the best that we can do in the way of scientific and historical thinking, we get a purging of the more fanciful analogies, such as those found in mediaval bestiaries, astrology, number mysticism, and the like. Nevertheless, metaphysical analogies still remain highly selective, and come back in the end to the meta- physician's own personal impression of what is significant. This selectivity is made still more abstract and partial by the demands of consistency. This is corrected to some extent by that interplay of theories which we call the " history of philosophy." It must also be corrected by coming back again and again to the more immediate kinds of response to the world, and the more concrete total assertions about it, which we find in poetry, religion, and every day practice. Such total assertions as these enshrine are not guided primarily by a demand for systematic consistency, but by a flair for appropriateness in the association of images and ideas. So, as Mr. Empson has shown,* to look for the mutually exclusive meanings which would be demanded by strict logical consistency is often to miss the point of poetic imagery. We have a kind of ambiguity which is the association of images meaning several things at once in one phrase; but this is the result of compression, not of vagueness of expression. The total impression left is a sort of " taste in the head " which conveys the sense of the image as a whole. There is thus a unity in the image over and above the associated meanings which can be analysed as entering into it. Half-way between these ambiguous images of poetry (and I think of religion) and the analogical concepts of metaphysics would be Bergson's " fluid images " by which he suggests we should try to express intuitions of life and movement.t These he says cannot really be represented * See his Seven Types of Ambiguity. t Cf. Introduction to Metaphysics, p. 15.</page><page sequence="17">II.-THE USE OF ANALOGY IN METAPHYSICS. 43 by images; the only way we can come near to doing it is by a clash of different images, so that we know that we can identify no one of them with the intuition itself. But when Bergson seeks to describe metaphysics as " the science which seeks to dispense with symbols," I cannot follow him. If metaphysics is, as it surely must be, a form of expression after reflection, it must use symbols of some kind (otherwise it would be not a form of expression, but of immediate experience), and it must therefore accept the rebuke of being to that extent selective and abstract. The symbols which it does use appear to move perhaps uneasily between the univocal language of logic and of science, and the ambiguities of poetic and religious imagery. It needs the former to discipline and criticize the vagaries of its analogies; it looks to the latter to correct their partiality. So metaphysics should spring from a critique of the sciences (in a wide sense of science) and point towards theology (again in a wide sense, in which a profession of atheism is a negative form of theology). Nor should I be prepared to state a general rule by which we can draw a clear line between metaphysics and theology, if to do so would imply that metaphysics is demonstrable in a way in which theology is not, since metaphysics includes the element of analogical thinking through which we record a personal response to the character of the world. This progression through metaphysical analogy to theological myth is illustrated in the avatXoyt'al of Republic VI. The Simile of the Sun, as Professor Ferguson has convincingly shown,* is based on the form of argument by diairesis and analogia, in which a similarity of function yields a logos by which diverse terms can be defined. The common nature of the Sun and Good is to be excellence actualizing perfections; their differentia the field within which these are actualized. So vision and knowledge are analogous in being dependent on an excellence other than * In the Classical Quarterly, Vol. XXVIII, number 3. B</page><page sequence="18">44 DOROTHY M. EMMET. themselves for their actualization. The Simile of the Divided Line keeps to the form of an analogical argument -as eucarToLM to i7rtTLc,T So 8&amp;aOLa to vo'747Lt. I have no space here to discuss the interpretation of the Line. I consider that Professor Ferguson has also shown convincingly that A Gercot should be taken to mean indirect vision. So the relation of tacvoLa to vo'qa-ts, which is to be determined, is proportionate to the relation of conjecture based on indirect vision to direct vision in the sphere of sense-perception. But neither the nature of the Good in the Simile of the Sun nor the nature of vo"qor- in the Divided Line can be determined in its essence; we can only indicate its relation to something else which is more familiar. It is thus an analogy in which the essence of the fourth term remains unknown; or rather we can only know how the third and fourth terms are related to each other, and as much about the nature of the fourth term as this relation suggests. Moreover, the analogies of the Sun and the Line prepare the way for the symbolism of the Myth of the Cave. I fully agree with Professor Ferguson that we cannot find a one to one correspondence between the analogies and the Myth of the Cave, so that the attempt to interpret the Line as the progression of stages of knowledge cor- responding to the ascent of the prisoner from the Cave is to miss the main point, both of the Simile of the Line and of the Myth of the Cave. But, nevertheless, the analogies between vision and knowledge drawn in the Similes of the Sun and Line prepare our minds for the symbolism of the Cave. The Cave is true Myth, and not allegory, in that we should not try to find a one to one correspondence between the details of symbolism and details of inter- pretation, but take the cumulative impression the image as a whole makes upon us after the way has been paved for its reception by analysis of the preceding analogies. That impression is one of the moral and intellectual</page><page sequence="19">II.-THE USE OF ANALOGY IN METAPHYSICS. 45 struggle of a soul undergoing conversion from the trickery of sophistic acrat8evo-ta. Plato's change of style to the myth form makes it apparent that the metaphysical analogies point beyond themselves. As we have seen metaphysics makes use of analogical thinking, drawing analogies between terms which are qualitatively different, viz., between elements within. experience and a fourth term which transcends experience. The fourth term in the analogy remains unknown in its essence, but we claim that our analogy tells us something about our relation to this unknown term. For, as we have seen, we express in the analogy the way in which we find ourselves impelled to respond to the impact of the transcendent term upon us. Nevertheless, I have shown such reason as I can for thinking that metaphysics can be something more than a chronicle of temperamental reactions, or flights of asthetic imagination. For in its attempts to arrive at some sort of intuition of things as a whole, on the one hand it must be disciplined by respect for the empirical sciences, and on the other hand it must be sensible to such more concrete responses as are witnessed to in poetry, moral experience, and the historic religions. But if we are alive as to how far our judgment of the importance or significance of different aspects of experience is affected by the selective nature of our own thought and by considerations bound up with the intellectual and sociological climate of the time in which we live, we shall hesitate to claim for any meta- physical system that it is a pihilosophia perennis, or a purely objective science of Being, or a through and through penetration of the world in thought. Our metaphysical analogies may serve so long as the total assertions they express help to throw light through some unity of intui- tion on the partial assertions which are accumulated empirically, and also if they help to exhibit the " inescapable diversity " in the character of the empirical. They may also serve so long as they exercise</page><page sequence="20">46 DOROTHY M. EMMET. a creative and stimulating influence on further thought. When they cease to do this, they will be not disproved but abandoned as irrelevant. But perhaps in the end the point at which we can say with most confidence that positive ground has been gained is in our better understanding, through its conscious articulation, of the experience from which the analogy has been drawn.</page></plain_text>
