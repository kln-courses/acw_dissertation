<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTTOR. THELLE CHRISTIANITY IN A BUDDHIST ENVIRONMENT Christianity has been through many ordeals. It has endured the fire of persecution, and has through two thousand years been exposed to various cultures and philosophies. It has been tried by the fire of science, philosophy, scepticism, and anti-religious thought, and has somehow survived. However, it has not yet been through the fire of Mahayana Buddhism. When that hap pens I have no doubt that Christianity will enter a melting pot in which it will be thoroughly transformed by Buddhism.1 My old Buddhist friend met Christianity as a student in a Christian uni versity around the turn of the century, and has ever since—with a profound Buddhist faith—been concerned about the role of Christianity in Japan. He deplored that Christianity had not yet really been in depth encounter with Buddhist spirituality, and was convinced that Christianity would have to change when such a meeting took place. Let this viewpoint be the challenge for our further considerations. The theme bears upon the problem of Christianity in a culture perme ated by Buddhist ideas. Buddhism in Japan, however, does not exist in cul tural isolation; its spirituality is fused with popular faith and folk traditions. Popular sentiments are sometimes just as relevant as philosophical reflec tions. I will attempt to question Christian theology and church life in rela tion to a few elements of the confusing variety of religions in Japan, using Buddhism as the main point of reference. Christianity: Repulsive and Attractive The Christian church in Japan is a "stranger in the land."2 This is usually stated, not as a personal opinion, but as a fact. And the fact is supported by a thousand impressions. The church is a place where you can learn English 'The statement was made by the late Saizo Inagaki, a prominent Shinto Buddhist from Kobe, in an interview with the writer. The expression if borrowed from Robert Lee, Stranger in the Land: A Study of the Church in Japan (London: Lutterworth Press, 1967). Dr. Notto R. Thelle was for many years a Lutheran missionary inJapan and an editor of Japanese Religions, where a slightly longer version of this articlefirst appeared in two parts.

There you can meet and converse with foreigners. The hymns are imported translations and the worship services adaptations of European and American models. The church buildings, too, strengthen the impression of foreignness: not only is the architecture alien, but the use of the buildings seems to be based on the strange idea that worship and prayer are expected only on certain limited occasions. The foreignness of the church is seen not only on the surface—in activi ties, buildings, and organizational structures—but on the doctrinal level as well. My Buddhist friend was untiring in his effort to explain how strange the Christian teaching appeared to the Japanese—not only alien and unfa miliar, but strange even to the point of being ridiculous. The late D. T. Su zuki also expressed the strangeness of Christianity: "Whenever I see the crucified figure of Christ, I cannot help thinking of the gap that lies be tween Christianity and Buddhism."3 Often Japanese Christians seem to feel a sort of religious alienation in their faith. They find themselves in a constant tension between what they experience as opposite poles: being a Christian and being a Japanese. The Catholic author, Endo Shusaku, has again and again described the tension between his Christian self and his Japanese self. "There was always a feeling in my heart that it [Christianity] was something borrowed." Christianity is like a foreign suit which is uncomfortable for those who are used to a Japa nese kimono, or even like a blood transfusion from a donor of a blood type different from one's own.4 There is one bewildering element in the almost unanimous testimony about the foreignness of Christianity. The church is a stranger in the land, but Jesus is somehow a friend. Even a dear friend. You can encounter him among young people who love to sing "What a friend we have in Jesus." I once saw an artist sing this hymn in a musical show on TV, with tears flow ing down her cheeks; she deeply moved her audience. Jesus is enshrined as one of the great spirits in many new religious movements. One can hear about him in Buddhist temples from priests who are inspired by his great example of sacrificial love. He appeals to people far beyond the narrow bor ders of the church.5 One also wonders about the fact that while official statistics show that church membership is less than one percent of the population, various sur veys indicate that from two to four percent regard Christianity as their reli gious affiliation. The Bible is widely read and spreading its influence. The gospel narration of Jesus actualizes a reality which people cannot but recog SD. Τ.

They discover something they would like to experience if they could just come in touch with it. Some people even go to church to find it, but are often turned off, disappointed. They hear sermons about fellow ship, love, and forgiveness, but do not experience through them the pres ence of Jesus' love. They prefer to remain outside the church, but are still, as it were, non-Christian friends of Jesus. A number of nuances and shades would have to be added to this black and-white sketch, but the rough outlines seem correct. The church is a stranger and will—if it continues its present development—remain foreign, even irrelevant and peripheral. And Jesus is somehow a friend who realized ideals, attitudes, and actions that have struck deep chords in Japanese spiri tuality. Christian doctrines, expressed in abstract Western concepts, seem utterly unfamiliar and strange, while the Gospel, with its Hebrew-Oriental concreteness and symbolic language, seems familiar and close. This is not, I am convinced, a superficial tension. The attraction to Jesus and the rejec tion of Christianity emerge from the deepest religious sentiments of the Japanese people. Buddhist-Christian Empathy If it is true that Christianity in Japan is both attractive and repulsive, fa miliar and strange, it seems natural to probe the reasons for this tension. Often it seems easier to find reasons why Christianity fails to appeal, but here I would rather draw attention to a few elements which seem conducive towards an understanding of the Christian way. Under the surface of irreli gion and distrust of established religions there exists in Japan, among other spiritual insights, a sensitivity which perhaps could be described as an ability to respond to truth whenever it is genuine and real. An optimistic Christian evangelist might claim this as an openness to Christian faith; on the other hand, in a subtle way it can also challenge Christian insights, and even ques tion the validity of Christianity. The Other Power The first insight I will mention is a vague sentiment which appears in many forms: a basic feeling that life is somehow sustained by someone or something, an awareness that life is given and supported by some life giving force, some Other Power. This is not necessarily expressed in religious terms. Even through their language, which reflects deep-seated attitudes, the Japanese seem to con fess a hidden and vague awareness of such a power. Hidden, because it is seldom spelled out in clear confessions; vague, because the Japanese lan guage itself often leans toward the vague. There is, for instance, a tendency in Japanese to omit both subject and object; one has to infer from the con text who is acting and who is the object of the action. The use of passive verbal expressions without subject is also characteristic. It sounds compli cated, but a few examples may help. SUMMER / FALL. 1985 175</page><page sequence="4">Sasaeru is an active verbal form meaning to "support." The passive form, sasaerarete iru, means to "be supported." Ataeru means to "give," and the pas sive ataerarete iru means to "be given," or to "receive." Ikiru means to "live," the causative ikasu means to "give life," "revive," or "restore," and the pas sive causative form ikasarete iru means to "be given life," to "be revived," or "life is created." Now, it is the wisdom of the Japanese language that such passive forms are frequendy used, but without an acting subject or an ob ject. A Westerner would say, "God is supporting me," or "I am supported by God," while a Japanese prefers to say, "[I am] supported . . .," sasaerarete iru. A Christian woman would confess that God gives her all his blessed gifts, and continually is renewing and supporting her life, while a Japanese is con tent to say that something "is given," ataerarete iru, or that life is sustained and renewed, ikasarete iru. She is not inclined to state who is the origin of the help and support, and it must be seen from the context that it is "I" who is the receiving part. Expressions of thanks often have the same lack of precision. When somebody greets you in the morning and asks how you are, the common answer starts with the words, Okagesama de. . ., "Thanks to. . ., I am tine." It is often said that the words originally expressed thanks to Buddha or to the gods, but there is no clear direction. Thanks to. . . whom? You? God? Bud dha? Other similar expressions also tend to lack clear directions, but obvi ously express the warm feeling of being under the care and protection of something or someone. As a Christian I have often asked myself whether it is possible to regard such expressions as hidden confessions to the creator. The expressions are certainly vague but reveal an awareness that we, together with all life in the universe, are sustained by some Other Power. It is ambiguous and perhaps unconscious, and may be weaker now than in the past, but it goes deep and resounds when the chord is struck. The feeling of dependence and divine protection is not always vague, but is provided with direction and name. The eight million gods of the Shinto pantheon, the flowering mythology of the Buddhist universe, and the numerous obscure saints and divine protectors of folk religion are in disputable signs of people's need to give direction to their devotion and prayer and clearly indicate an awareness of spiritual powers beyond the limits of human efforts and possibilities. The most conspicuous expression of total dependence is found in the Japanese tradition of Pure Land Buddhism, the so-called Shin Buddhism founded by Shinran (1173-1262). Here the concept of Other Power was coined in a radical rejection of all religious self-power as a means of salva tion. The Other Power is confessed against the background of total power lessness. The faithful realize their total lack of ability to break out of sin and passion, and rely one-sidedly on the Other Power. Only Amida Buddha's promise of salvation is the basis of hope and confidence. It is a religion for the powerless, who depend on faith alone and grace alone. Even faith is not 176 CROSSCURRENTS</page><page sequence="5">a result of our initiative—that would mean a vain reliance on self-power—it arises in the moment the calling from Amida Buddha's saving vow comes to us from outside. Since faith is expressed in terms so close to Pauline Chris tianity, many have characterized it as the "Protestant Buddhism of Japan." Because of its one-sided stress on the Other Power, many have ques tioned whether Pure Land Buddhism is representative of Japanese atti tudes. Moreover, it seems so remote from Buddha's original teaching that its Buddhist authenticity has sometimes been doubted. Its symbols and ex pressions certainly set it apart from other Buddhist currents, but it has deeply influenced Japanese religiosity; furthermore, the awareness of Other Power is not limited to this part of Buddhism. It can be argued that even Zen, which is usually regarded as the religion of self-power par excellence, has a deep awareness of other-power. Admit tedly, as a meditative tradition Zen is a religion for the few, for the elite who have the will and capacity to go through years of meditation and severe training. One may meditate for one year, five years, twenty years, or even a whole life, and still not break through to the great liberation. So Zen seems to emphasize the spirit of self-power. But does it really? Those who penetrate to the deepest levels of medita tion seem to discover that Zen is based on much more than self-power. In a sketchbook humorously portraying the life of Zen novices there is a moving picture of a monk who has finally reached the stage of enlightenment, "the wonderful moment of satori." He may have been striving for years, a pain ful way of toil and hardship—and self-power. But when he breaks through to the great illumination, he discovers that he is sitting in the great hand of the Buddha. In fact, he had been there all the time. He was carried.6 Even Zen, the religion of self-power, has in its basic insight a deep awareness of the Other Power. Sacrificial Love Another insight which seems to open the field of vision toward central Christian values could be characterized as Sacrificial Love. There seems to be among the Japanese an intuitive sense which make them stop when they encounter a genuine self-giving love. The Bible verses I have heard most quoted in Japan outside the Christian church, apart from the deflated "God is love," are probably the two sayings of Jesus, "For whoever would save his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it" (Mt. 16:25), and "Unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit" (John 12:24). Is that accidental? I think it is possible in Japan to detect a sore and almost vulnerable readi ness to grasp true values such as love, sacrifice, and self-dedication. It is vul nerable because it is a yearning which is so often betrayed. It is betrayed by 6Giei Satö and Eshin Nishimura, Unsui: Diary of Zen Monastic Life (Honolulu: University Press of Hawaii, 1973). SUMMER/FALL, 1985 177</page><page sequence="6">Buddhist monks and Christian preachers, prophets and charlatans, popu lar shamans and cultleaders who draw people's attention because they pro claim the new reality of love and sacrifice. Many are willing to dedicate their lives to it if they can only experience it as an actual reality. But no one knows how many are finally turned off, disillusioned and disappointed. Yet the openness and the yearning towards the ideals are intact. The ideals are still a latent force in many people's sentiments. Engraved in the facial expressions of popular saints and deities, they are transmitted in nu merous legends and fairy tales. An old story is told about the Bodhisattva Kannon, popularly called the Goddess of Mercy. A certain woman was so fervent in her devotion to Kan non that her husband became jealous. Once, while she was worshipping in front of the Kannon statue, he stabbed her and left her bleeding in front of the image. After a while his wife returned home as if nothing had hap pened. The confused husband rushed back to the place where he had slashed his wife, and discovered that the Kannon statue was sitting there with a bleeding wound. It may be significant that Kannon has appealed so strongly to the Japa nese. The two characters used for the name Kannon signify "the one who hearkens to the cries of the world." The beautiful facial lines reveal a deep sense of compassion. Sometimes she is depicted with eleven faces, merci fully regarding the pain in all directions of the universe, or with a thousand arms stretching out toward all suffering life. Is not the devotion to Kannon an expression of a deep awareness of the mystery of mercy and compas sion? Some time ago I attended a popular drama with members of one of the new Buddhist movements, Rissho Koseikai. Together with five thousand spectators I was drawn into the profound message of the simple story. A princess was fleeing from her enemies, and was taken care of by the poor peasants in a distant mountain village. It was winter, and they were waiting desperately for spring which never seemed to come. They shared their food as long as it lasted, but finally the storehouses were empty, and they faced starvation and death. The village was under the curse of the Spirit of the Lake, which was prolonging frost and snow and ice. Finally the princess made her great decision; without telling anybody, she vowed to sacrifice herself to the Spirit of the Lake. The audience heard only her distant voice as she proceeded out into the frozen landscape. Suddenly all nature was transformed: There were green fields, flowers, birds and fruit-trees. The drama was short and simple, but stirred deep emotions among the specta tors. In its popular appeal it was also good Buddhism. For some time I had the privilege of keeping close contact with a reli gious movement which convinced me that a fertile soil is prepared for the message of love and dedication. The leader, whom I met before he died a few years ago, was sometimes characterized as a dreamer and charlatan, and some of his ideas were rather fantastic; never in my life, however, had I 178 CROSSCURRENTS</page><page sequence="7">met anybody who was able to make love such a near and obvious reality. He was surrounded by an aura of radiating light and warmth, a magnetic field which drew people toward him. "I have never met a man with such a beauti ful heart," one of his disciples told me. "I couldn't but follow a man who talked about love in that way." And he often talked about Jesus, about his love and sacrifice for others. "A man who became totally an instrument of love like Jesus could not become old," he told me. "He had to die, but then he also had a magnificent resurrection." He had never read the Bible or been in a Christian church. Space does not allow me to go into details about other groups or individ uals. Let me just say that I am convinced that there is in Japan an unswerv ing sense for genuine love, a groping openness toward the sacrifice implied by love. Universal Solidarity Most readers might find it rather farfetched to talk about universal soli darity as a Japanese virtue. The hard realities of Japanese society seem to reject any solidarity that goes beyond the narrow limits of profit, group in terest, and national concern. The limited group takes precedence over the individual, and also seems to prevent the development of more universal attitudes, concerns vital to Christian faith. Is it possible, then, to talk about solidarity in Japan as a positive value which opens toward more universal ideas? And if so, does it represent any thing more than imported Western slogans and political or religious clap trap? I think so, even if it is often forgotten, suppressed, or suffers under the hard realities of life. The most remarkable expression of universal oneness and solidarity is undoubtedly found in Mahayana Buddhism. One may fail to find a practi cal realization of the ideas, but the vision itself is so magnificent and pene trating that it poses a great challenge to Christian thinking and may give rise to disturbing questions about our own understanding. A brief sketch is in adequate to describe the Buddhist vision in all its dimensions, but a basic understanding of the idea is important. For many decades Western study of Buddhism tended to stress the nega tive and passive aspects of Buddhism: life is suffering and human beings are bound in pain and passion; the point is to break out of the chain of cau sation and reach the peace of nirvana, etc. Beyond this narrow understand ing of Buddhism as world-negating pessimism, however, new horizons have opened. In Mahayana Buddhism the old insights have been devel oped into a vision of universal pain, solidarity, and salvation. The central axis of this vision is the idea of interdependence, or depen dent origination (pratitya samutpada). Everything in the universe comes into being, changes, and disappears due to an ever-continuing process of cause and effect. It is a movement which never stops, an eternal stream of change. Not one thing in the universe, not one person or one speck of dust exists SUMMER / FALL, 1985 179</page><page sequence="8">isolated and unrelated, but is in the process of becoming and changing due to innumerable influences, and each thing itself in turn causes change in other things and other situations. When Buddhists talk about impermanence, they are referring to this continuous process of change. There is no unchanging substance apart from the flow of change. And there is no unchanging essence or permanent soul apart from the process. Impermanence is the negative side of this in sight. It means suffering because people are blindly grasping for things as if there existed isolated egos and permanent situations apart from the flow of change. But beyond impermanence and pain there appears a magnificent vision of universal unity. If it is true that all things are in a process of change, depending on each other in a boundless web of cause and effect, the awareness of dependent origination points toward an inevitable solidar ity. Plants and nature, human beings and things are not merely dead mat ter, but a living whole, bound together in a limidess interrelation. In this perspective, Buddhism could be described as an ecstatic vision of universal unity. This awareness of unity is not only a bright and superficial sentiment, an optimistic soprano, but also has implications for the dark side of life, a deep tone in a minor key. For universal interrelation also means solidarity with suffering life. If the cosmos is an organic whole which develops in mutual dependence and causation, it is impossible to isolate oneself or anything from those who live in pain. There is no salvation for the individual alone, because no ego or substance exists in isolated independence from the wholeness. The effort of the individual to break out of universal pain and solidarity becomes an impossible egoistic escape. The real way to salvation does not lead out of the world, but back to the world. The world is not ne gated, but rediscovered as a place to give one's life in order to lead all life toward salvation. This is closely linked to the Buddhist understanding of sacrificial love, and expresses the deepest insight of Buddhist solidarity: the Bodhisattva who swears by his own salvation that unless all sentient beings are saved together with him, he will abandon salvation itself. Buddhist Challenges I have roughly sketched three insights which seem empathetic with basic Christian values: Other Power, sacrificial love, and solidarity. Do these have any bearing upon our way of thinking and living as Christians? I think so, and will, in a tentative way, indicate some possible implications concerning our understanding of God, Christ, and the human in the universe. God If there is a Japanese awareness that life is given, and that we are sus tained by some Other Power, some of our theological simplifications must go. For instance, one popular theological "trick" is to interpret till other reli gions as tremendous efforts of self-redemption, while Christianity alone is 180 CROSSCURRENTS</page><page sequence="9">held up as the teaching of God's graceful coming to humanity. This conven ient solution is often employed, even though abundant material from com parative religion all over the world has made such a conclusion dubious. The dependence on Other Power is seldom spelled out as clearly as in Japa nese Pure Land Buddhism, but often one can discern, on the deepest level, the basic insight that our lives are preserved by divine grace, a sort of gratia preveniens. This awareness may be distorted by a stress on self-power, legal ism, or self-redemption, which one also finds in various forms of Christian piety, but the basic sentiment may be closer to Christianity than we usually realize. A positive recognition of the Japanese awareness of the divine, both in its hidden forms and in clear language, may open ways of understanding that otherwise tend to be closed. Much more intriguing in this context is the question whether our names and expressions are the only meaningful ways of confessing God. At this point we need to reconsider the relative character of human language. The Word which became flesh was final and definite, but no word about him is absolute. Language is not static, but goes through a process of growth, de cay, and new life. Words can lose their meaning and die, or change charac ter and be replaced by other words. No language is absolute, not even reli gious language. This means, for instance, that no religious expression is absolute in the sense of being unique. All over the world people use similar symbols of God, without having been in contact with each other. In other cases, we share our religious language with other faiths as a result of contin uous intercourse with other cultures. God was never confessed in cultural isolation. In biblical history, rejection of heathen worship took place in a process which at the same time incorporated alien practices and ideas. In Christianity, the unique message of salvation was proclaimed in close con tact with surrounding faiths and cults; Christian theology received its classi cal expression in the encounter with Greek philosophy, which provided its orthodox language, although it reflected a universe quite different from the world of Jesus the Jew. It would be nothing but cultural provincialism to hold that the dogma expressed by the European spirit via the Greek and Latin languages is the only adequate framework for true theology. This does not mean that our classical theology has lost its meaning or should be discarded; but we must recognize that no language is indispensable. And it should be possible to accept the idea, at least theoretically, that new concepts and expressions may enrich our understanding. Another question follows from the above considerations: are our ex pressions always adequate? I doubt whether many people besides specialists find that the classical trinitarian doctrine, or the definitions of the two nat ures of Christ, adequately express what they believe. We may perhaps have a proper understanding of those doctrines, and affirm their meaning, but they do not really seem to function very well. This point relates not only to abstract theology, but also to the concrete symbolic language of faith. We SUMMER / FALL, 1985 181</page><page sequence="10">have consciously or unconsciously discarded many biblical expressions about God. They are no longer current and have lost their value. Even an avowed fundamentalist would be shocked if he realized how small a num ber of biblical expressions are functionally active in his life. Our God is not a jealous God in the same way as he was for the Israelites. And our under standing of God's lordship, fatherhood, and kingship is not only influenced by biblical understanding, but is in many cases changed by the social reali ties we experience. When Christianity reentered Japan after the mid-nineteenth century, there was one whole class of Japanese society that seemed to be able to grasp the meaning of the lordship of Jesus: the samurai or warrior class. When the feudal system was discarded after the Meiji Restoration (1868), many of the samurai who lost their masters found a new symbol of authority in Jesus Christ, and transferred their allegiance to their new Lord. This fact strengthened the image of Christianity as a religion of total subjection to the divine Lord. Bushido, the traditional "Way of the Warrior," was frequendy depicted as the true Christian way.7 This, of course, seemed a support for the Christian church; on the other hand, it strengthened the masculine side of faith. Japanese Christianity became a religion for the strong, with an em phasis on authority, righteousness, and active fighting spirit. The father image of God has also worked in the same direction. In many cases the symbol of the Father fails to convey the true meaning of the Gos pel. The Japanese father is an outsider, with a peripheral role in the life of the family. He is the final authority, and a power to be feared—like earth quakes, fires, and typhoons—but is not close enough to raise feelings of ten derness and affection. Hence it is no surprise that in reaction some Japanese Christians have stressed the maternal element of faith in God. Endo Shu saku, in numerous novels, short stories, and essays, has tried to soften the image of Christianity; instead of the harsh, severe, judgmental, "paternal" religion, his image of God is described in the Christ who stays with the worthless and shares their sufferings. This image, says Endo, is reflected in the face of a Japanese mother.8 An even better symbol in this context might be the word oya, meaning "parent," which was applied to God by the founder of Tenrikyo, one of the new monotheistic faiths which arose in the last century. The God of Tenri kyo was revealed as "God, the Parent," an expression which has been adapted also by many other religious groups. Perhaps it is not possible sim ply to replace "God, the Father" with "God, the Parent," or "God, the Mother," but it would be meaningful to speak about God in terms of parent or a loving mother. Traditional biblical symbols may have different conno 7 A famous example is Inazo Nitobe, Bushido: The Soul of Japan (Tokyo: Tuttle, 1964; origi nally published in 1900). 8Shusaku Endo, "Concerning the Novel 'Silence'," in Japan Christian (Quarterly 36 (Spring 1970): 100-103. 182 CROSSCURRENTS</page><page sequence="11">tations in Japan, and Japanese expressions may, in come cases, be more ad equate. Western Christians tend to regard it as indisputable that God is a person. Our expressions are thoroughly anthropomorphic and personal, and our faith would indeed be poor without this personal language, but it is ex tremely bewildering to the Eastern mind. Eastern religions have preferred to develop non-personal language concerning the Absolute, such as univer sal truth, dharma, nature, brahman-atman, Tao, Buddha nature, heaven (sometimes with a personal character), light and life, suchness, nothing ness, emptiness, etc. There are innumerable gods and divine helpers, Bud dhas and Bodhisattvas with a more personal character, but the assumption is that these are mere symbolic expressions of a reality which belongs to a totally transpersonal sphere. Christians are certainly aware that anthropomorphic expressions are symbols pointing toward the reality of God, who transcends all human cate gories. We know that God is not a person in the same sense as we are per sons, but it is hard for Eastern people to understand why Christians stub bornly maintain that God is a person, or at least personal. Although we do not feel God's personhood as a limitation, the equivocal Eastern reaction shows that the emphasis on God's personhood presents an important bar rier to understanding. In the Japanese context, the question arises whether the reality of God is adequately expressed through a one-sided stress on the personal. We expe rience non-personal categories as a diffuse world where not only personal community with God is negated, but also the human personality seems to be swallowed up by a vague universal identity. Or, even worse, the divine be comes just a cold, impersonal principle governing the world with merciless universality. Eastern people, however, do not seem to experience a rejec tion of personal categories as cold impersonalism or nebulous vagueness. The impersonal language is experienced, rather, as a dynamic means of ex pressing the inexplicable mystery of the divine. On the depth level, of course, not only personal categories, but also non-personal expressions are discarded. Nevertheless, Eastern religions find the impersonal expressions more suitable for conveying the mystery of the absolute. The encounter with Eastern thought may help us to a recognition of a truer meaning of personal language. In a discussion of Christianity and Buddhism, Heinrich Dumoulin states that "all that can be predicated of God in human speech must be complemented by a radical negation of the finite and an elevation to the unspeakable dimension of the absolute."9 With this background, both personal and impersonal language may be come meaningful ways of expressing faith in God, because both are func tioning as dynamic expressions of a reality we now "see in a mirror dimly" (I Cor. 13:12). 'Heinrich Dumoulin, Christianity Meets Buddhism (Illinois: Open Court, 1974), p. 167. SUMMER/FALL. 1985 183</page><page sequence="12">In a similar way we could reconsider the limitations and potentialities of our concept of God's transcendence. In our Judeo-Christian tradition tran scendence is a precondition for God's presence in the world. In the East, however, a radical stress on transcendence tends to create an image of a God who is totally apart from this world, governing from outside through arbitrary decisions and interventions in history. Along with impersonal cat egories, Eastern people prefer to understand the divine as an immanent reality, a life-force, an all-pervading power that sustains everything, or as a divine principle, a universal law, the true nature behind all phenomena. The divine thus belongs to a different, deeper level, but is not totally sepa rated from the human realm. The supernatural does not represent a radi cal break with the natural, but is rather a mysterious extension of the imma nent. Perhaps it could be characterized as an immanence with a depth dimension that Westerners have tended to ignore. Is it possible for Christians to speak more boldly about God in immanent categories? Even though we believe in God's continuous creation, his life giving presence, etc., we are often so afraid of pantheism and immanent categories that it is difficult to grasp the presence of God in the creative powers that pervade the entire cosmos and flow through every particle of the universe. And even if we recognize God's presence, it is certainly dif ficult to convey it meaningfully in a culture where our categories of tran scendence do not seem to function very well. There are possible pitfalls in the understanding of God as an immanent reality. God may fade away in a shallow belief in immanence. On the other hand, it is difficult to see that the misconceptions created by a one-sided stress on God's transcendence are much preferable to a distorted belief in his immanence. If Eastern thought does not always grasp the transcendent presence of the divine, our categories are often unable to express the transcendent presence in a meaningful way. Perhaps we should accept a complementary way of thinking, in which transcendence and immanence, personal and impersonal categories to gether, give a more valid picture of reality. Why should we not complement our belief in the Creator who governs the world with an understanding of God as present in the creative powers of the universe? The former will tend to be expressed in personal categories, such as father, king, creator, and lord; the latter in more impersonal terms, such as creative powers, life, light, nature, ground of being, creative presence, etc. Both sets of language are relative, and represent two symbolic models of the world, each with in herent limitations and potentials. I believe that they do not refer to two sep arate worlds, but are poles of the same reality. Held together, our under standing of God's presence can be more complete. Jesus Christ In contrast to the Christian church which is a "stranger in the land," I described Jesus as a sort of "friend," suggesting that there was in Japan a certain openness toward sacrificial love. The possible implication is that the 184 CROSSCURRENTS</page><page sequence="13">Gospel of Jesus Christ should be preached as a new, but not alien or unfa miliar reality. The immediate sense of genuine love, expressed in popular sentiments and grasped in the lives of some blessed spirits, the merciful presence of grace carved into the beauty of the Buddha statues, the Bodhi sattva ideal of sacrifice and compassion—are not all these signs which point toward the inner heartbeat of the universe, the central mystery we know as God's love in Jesus Christ? There is in the Bible a tension between the old and the new: the old pact and the new pact; the Word which was in the beginning and the Word which became flesh; the eternal, unchanging love of God and the love which was realized in Jesus as a new reality. The newness of Jesus is not that he preached a new truth. He pointed to the truth that every Jew was ex pected to know, "an old commandment which you had from the begin ning," "the word which you have heard." But at the same time God's love was actualized, or realized in a totally new way, "a new commandment, which is true in him and in you . . ." (I John 2:7-8). The Word which be came flesh is the same Word which was in the beginning. God's love which was in the beginning was realized in Jesus in a new way, which made Jesus' life, death, and resurrection the key to God's heart. The vision of divine love is not a radically new thing because in Japan too there is the creative Word which was in the beginning. This does not mean that Japan has grasped the wholeness of love. In the Old Testament, too, God's love is obscured by other ideas. But even in Japan it is seen, and the radical newness of God's love in Jesus Christ is not necessarily a negation of what was heard before. The problem in this context is how the uniqueness of God's love in Jesus is to be grasped. Because there is a deep sense of sacrificial love in Japan, the sacrifice of Jesus Christ can sometimes be grasped intuitively as the deepest realization of divine love; however, insurmountable difficulties seem to arise when this is expressed in traditional theological terms. In particular, the isolation of Jesus' suffering and death as the bloody sacrifice of expia tion is not only difficult to understand, but also tends to force upon the Jap anese the image of a cruel and capricious God who required blood and pain to appease his wrath. The sacrifice of expiation is in the New Testament just one of the central symbols used to express the meaning of Jesus' work. Used as the only key to interpret God's love, however, it easily lends support to the unbiblical idea that the suffering and death of Jesus changed God's mind and converted his wrath into love. The attempt to grasp the mystery of Jesus' suffering and death has to be continued, but I think it is important to devote more time and effort to de velop and deepen the understanding of other biblical interpretations of his coming as well. Other biblical expressions point toward the same center, God's love in Christ. If we discover the dynamic potential of the abundant material of the Bible, it may be easier to convey the meaning of Christ in its manifold richness. SUMMER / FALL, 1985 185</page><page sequence="14">One Japanese attempt to express this mystery is Kazoh Kitamori's Theol ogy of the Pain of God,10 which has been hailed as the first significant "Japa nese theology." I am not convinced that the idea of God's "love in pain" is especially Japanese, but it is important as an effort to express God's love against the background of the Japanese experience of suffering and hard ship. If other theologians could relate their understanding of Christ in the Japanese context with the same insight into and interest in Japanese sensi bility, Japanese theology would be more meaningful than it is at the present time. It is a challenge for Japanese theology, first, to grasp the true meaning of God's love as the eternal reality which "was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be," realized once and for all in Jesus Christ; and then, to discern how this love is related to the dreams, yearnings, and religious insights born out of the actual experience, suffering, and love of the Japanese people. The Human in the Universe How does the Buddhist vision of a boundless interrelatedness and soli darity affect our understanding of universality? In the first place, I think it is necessary to question our traditional understanding of individualism as a Christian virtue. The Japanese image of the Christian is the strong and in dependent individual who stands out from the crowd. On the one hand, people seem to admire the few who really become Christians and are willing to bear the burden of becoming alienated from the group. On the other hand, it seems difficult to understand why faith should estrange people from their society. It seems necessary to raise the question of what is genu inely Christian and what is merely a Western development in the image of the Christian as a self-assertive, aggressive individualist who perhaps can lead people, but finds it difficult to function as a part of traditional society. Individualism is not a biblical ideal, but rather a late development in Western culture. Jesus himself did not aim at creating individualists. He knew that faith could mean a break with friends and family, but basically he saw each person as a part of the people. Sent to the people of Israel, he restored broken relations. The kingdom he proclaimed was a community, not a gathering of individuals. Christians in Japan clearly see, and often criticize, the limitations and su perficial aspects of Japanese group-centeredness. The limitations of indi vidualism, however, are not seen so clearly. The strong individualism and lack of group solidarity is obviously one of the main barriers that isolate Christians in the Japanese society. The one-sided cultivation of individual ism is a Western invention which, in spite of its deep influence, certainly does not fit into most Eastern cultures. We should not take it for granted that Western individualism is closer to the biblical ideal than the Eastern stress on the solidarity of the group. l0Kazoh Kitamori, Theology of the Pain of God (Richmond, Virginia: John Knox Press, 1965). 186 CROSSCURRENTS</page><page sequence="15">According to Christian conviction, the human person is the center and head of creation. Hence the focus of theology becomes the relation between the human and God. The world tends to be only of secondary importance as the stage of the interaction between God and humanity. In contrast to this, Eastern spirituality understands the human more as an integral part of the cosmos. Humankind is not the lord of creation, but should find its place in harmony with nature. There is no need for Christians to conceal the primary importance of humanity in God's creation, but the Eastern stress on the human as a part of the cosmos could be a valuable reminder that the creation as a whole is cen tral to biblical faith. Human beings are not only socially related, but their lives are bound to the entire creation in a deep solidarity, whether they real ize this or not. The centrality of creation and the solidarity of all created things are vital issues in the Bible. The fall resulted in the curse of the soil and brought death into the world (Gen. 3). Paul refers to this when he says that "creation was subjected to futility" and "has been groaning in travail until now," and describes how "creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the sons of God" (Rom. 8:18-23). The great flood destroyed all life on earth because of the sin of humanity (Gen. 6:7). Not only human beings, but ani mals, and even the fields need a sabbatical rest (Exodus 23:10-12). In the Psalms nature is not only a passive testimony of God's glory, but is actively participating in the universal praise of God. And the kingdom which is to come is described as a new heaven and a new earth (Rev. 21:1). With our Western stress on the salvation of the individual soul, it is puz zling and almost incomprehensible that "the creation itself will be set free from bondage to decay and obtain the glorious freedom of the children of God" (Rom. 8:21). We tend to regard Jesus' words of forgiveness as more important than his healings, while both are equally genuine expressions of the creator's love. Or we distinguish between his healings and the so-called nature miracles, although there seems to be no natural distinction in the New Testament. A somewhat artificial distinction is also often made be tween the order of creation and the order of salvation. According to the Bible, however, the God who saves is none but the creator of the universe, who saves by restoring and recreating his world. These random examples may indicate that our theology of creation is limited and tends to bring about an isolation of the human from the rest of God's creation. Solidarity has been lost. The Eastern view of the human as an integral part of the entire cosmos is somewhat different from the Chris tian way of thinking, but may inspire us to a new appreciation of a central biblical concern. I would like to return to the question of solidarity on the human level, because this is somewhat familiar and because the Buddhist view of interde pendence challenges us to consider whether we have failed to grasp the depth of human interdependence and solidarity. The most articulate repu SUMMER/ FALL, 1985 187</page><page sequence="16">diation of Western individualism is found in Mahayana Buddhism, which rejects every effort to grasp the essence of the human person as an isolated individual. In Buddhism there is no permanent substance which can be called ego, soul, or self; every person, as all other things in the universe, is an integral part of a whole which comes into being and changes in a process of interdependence. There is no unchanging essence apart from, or inde pendent from others. As Christians, too, we are aware of the solidarity of humanity. Our lives are created and molded in the encounter with thousands of people, situa tions and happenings. And we ourselves have a hand in shaping and creat ing the lives of people we meet, for better or worse. My book of life is not written by me alone, but by my family, my neighbours, and people I meet. And I myself am not only writing my own book of life, but continually write my own story into the books of people I meet. We are bound to each other in an unbreakable relationship of solidarity. Perhaps the Mahayana Bud dhist vision of suffering and salvation ought to be taken more seriously. Ac cording to Mahayana Buddhism, there is no salvation for the individual iso lated from the rest of sentient beings. For all life belongs together in unbreakable solidarity. The enlightened cannot leave his friends who are bound in suffering in order to enjoy the peace of Nirvana. For he is a part of their lives, and their lives are part of his life. They are bound together by a thousand strings. Hence the enlightened Bodhisattva vows to abandon the peace of nirvana in order to stay with all suffering life. Does not Paul point in the same direction when he makes his vow, "For I could wish that I myself were accursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brethren, my kinsmen by race" (Rom. 9:3)? And his final understand ing of the inscrutable ways of God is that he "has consigned all men to dis obedience, that he may have mercy upon all" (Rom. 11:32). There is obvi ously a tension in the Bible between the proclamation of a Hnal judgement leading to salvation or damnation and, on the other hand, the vision of the ultimate consummation in God, when everything will be united in him (Eph. 1:9-10; Col. 1:15-20; Phil. 2:9-11; I Cor. 15:27; etc.). It is my convic tion, however, that the purest thoughts and prayers of most Christians go in the latter direction, which, in this context, is also supported by Buddhist insights. God's love knows no limit. Salvation is not complete until the hard est hearts are transformed and recreated by love. God's love has not won before He has called his "Let there be light" in every hell, overcome the powers, and transformed the frozen heart of the Evil. Is this not the final consequence of Paul's vision of anakephalaiosis, God's unifying all things? The reluctant acceptance of causality in Western theology had ambigu ous implications. It could serve as evidence of God's existence as creator, or "first cause." But it also created problems for a proper theology. Where the law of causality was accepted unconditionally, God was easily reduced to a pale, unbiblical prima causa, an immovable mover, a deistic God bound by the laws of nature. And human beings seemed to lose their free will, deter 188 CROSSCURRENTS</page><page sequence="17">mined by a merciless causality. The Eastern version of causality is devel oped in a somewhat different direction; not as a linear development of cause and effect, but rather as an immense net in which all the meshes are direcdy related to each other by innumerable lines in all direcdons of dme and space. The theological implicadons of this Eastern causality, with its un limited universal interdependence, cannot be exhausted in a brief essay. I have merely touched some aspects of the issue, well aware that a serious theological grappling with the problems may lead to farreaching and un forseeable consequences with regard to our understanding of God and hu manity. But it has been a constant temptation for Japanese theology to avoid the problems raised by the Buddhist insights sketched above. One consequence of such neglect is, of course, that this theology has failed to relate Chrisdanity to a vital part of Japanese culture. I began my consideradons by quoting my Buddhist friend who prophe sied that a real encounter with Buddhism would lead to a radical transfor mation of Chrisdanity. There is no doubt that if Christianity had encoun tered Eastern thought in the same way as it encountered Greek and Roman thought in the first centuries, it would have gone through many changes. I think changes will come. If the encounter with Buddhism could sdmulate a process of search and reconsideradon of theological foundations, it will benefit the universal church. For Chrisdanity is in need of new insight and new modes of theology. The challenges sketched above have been pre sented as problems rising from the context of an alien religion, in this case Buddhism, but they are not created by Buddhism. The encounter with Buddhism has only actualized problems that are also inherent in the Chris tian faith, and may help us to sharpen our quesdons and deepen our in sight. - Anti-Blackness in English Religion 1500-1800 by Joseph R.
