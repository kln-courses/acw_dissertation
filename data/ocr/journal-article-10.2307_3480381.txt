Rubint If ever a constitutional doctrine has fallen from grace, it is the doc- trine of procedural due process. By far the oldest of our civil rights,' its content seemed so clear to prior generations that they included the term "due process" in the fifth and fourteenth amendments virtually without discussion.2 Although great controversy arose about the applicability of due process to nonprocedural or substantive matters, procedural due process doctrine evolved quietly and steadily, surviving the demise of its controversial cognate without notable impairment. Even the ex- panded reliance on procedural due process during the loyalty-security crisis of the 1950's and the welfare rights movement of the 1960's did little to disturb its charmed stability. All of this has come to an end during the past decade. The proce- dural due process doctrine is now the subject of intense debate, with its central meaning regularly questioned by both courts and commenta- tors. This descent into uncertainty is largely the result of the Supreme Court's conscious effort to define the interests to which the due process clause relates. While the answer seems clear enough for criminal and civil trials, it has proved to be a dark conundrum for newer forms of government activity, such as benefits programs, licensing, mass em- t Acting Professor of Law, Boalt Hall School of Law, University of California, Berkeley.

The Court's answer in these ar- eas has been that procedural protections must be triggered by some underlying "liberty" or "property" right-a right that is generated either by the state's positive law or by constitutional provisions other than the due process clause itself.3 Dissenters on the Court, and virtu- ally all of the early commentators, objected vigorously, arguing that this underlying rights approach undermines the essential nature of the protection that procedural rights provide.4 Recently, a revisionist mood seems to have developed, however, with several commentators maintaining that the Court's position makes sense after all.5 The Court, meanwhile, has been less certain. In Vitek v. Jones,6 Justice White conceded that the due process clause itself cre- ated the right to avoid being stigmatized by government activity.7 And in Hewitt v. Helms,8 Justice Rehnquist, principal architect of the under- lying rights approach, wrote: "Liberty interests protected by the Four- teenth Amendment may arise from two sources-the Due Process Clause itself and the laws of the States."9 The procedural due process doctrine's fall from grace may be ascribed to an excess of ambition. In content, the Court's new ap- proach relies on other sources of law; in form, or methodology, it strikes off largely on its own. The notion that the scope of due process protection can be derived from definitions of the terms "liberty" and "property" is unprecedented.

Both notions, moreover, indicate a desire to start from first principles and proceed by means of logical argument. Although an admirable effort, such an approach aspires to a level of certainty that is generally denied to legal doctrine and raises risks of unexpected consequences to which legal doctrine is uniquely subject. Combined with the Court's unconstrained ambition, as so often is the case, is a substantial element of naivet6. The Court seems to have assumed that it could reach solid ground by invoking the terms "lib- erty" and "property." Unfortunately, these terms have had no fixed boundaries since the decline of legal formalism, and they lack even an intuitive core when applied to modem administrative situations." As a result, the effort to determine whether a prisoner can be subjected to solitary confinement by discussing "liberty"'2 or to determine whether a student can be suspended from school by discussing "property""13 is little more than arid conceptualism. It either conceals the real issues behind a screen of unrelated terms or, worse still, uses the unrelated connotations of those terms to control the real issues. What it clearly fails to do is to provide a coherent, realistic doctrine for applying our notion of procedural due process to the recently developed features of the administrative state. As this Article will show, there is little need for the Court's ambi- tion to transform either preexisting due process doctrine or the modem legal theory that underlies it. Since virtually all recent due process cases involve administrative agencies, the Court does not have to aban- don the received tradition; the basic problem is simply to translate a protection developed for judicial trials into the administrative context. And since the terms liberty and property are used in the Constitution in connection with that protection, there is no reason to rely upon contem- porary interpretations of their literal meaning when analyzing adminis- trative action. The Court could determine what the effect of this language was in its original context, and then interpret it to achieve the same effect in administrative cases. In other words, modem procedural due process issues lend themselves to assessment by analogy. Rather than starting from first principles and then resorting to textual literal- ism in their application, the Court could start from existing doctrine and develop new solutions by an incremental approach that is more congenial to the case-law method. 10.

It traces the development of pro- cedural due process strands that have appeared and disappeared over time. Of particular significance is the relationship between the Supreme Court's theory of due process and the administrative actions that it has attempted to subject to or shield from constitutional scrutiny. Part II analyzes the scope of the due process clause, maintaining that the Court's use of the terms "liberty" and "property" is concep- tually incoherent in the context of modem legal theory, and largely meaningless in relation to the modem administrative state. The start- ing point for due process analysis, it argues, should not be liberty, prop- erty, or any other individual interest. Instead, the inquiry should focus on the fairness of the governmental action. Our generally accepted standards for fairness are that the government must follow applicable rules and provide a minimal level of procedural protection. The neces- sary limit on the scope of procedural due process in administrative con- texts, then, is most readily captured by the familiar, albeit imperfect, distinction between legislative-type action, or rulemaking, and judicial- type action, or adjudication. This limit helps clarify the "procedural" and "substantive" nature of various due process decisions, as well as the differential legitimacy of these two uses of the clause. It is, more- over, precisely what the terms "liberty" and "property" imply when their effects are translated from the judicial to the administrative context. Part III then initiates a direct inquiry into the content of due pro- cess protection. It suggests that this content can be determined by the familiar methodology of applying procedural archetypes to particular categories of governmental action. The crucial issues that arise in utilizing this methodology can be analyzed in terms of standard admin- istrative law notions about the permissible scope of agency discretion. Such analysis reveals, rather than obscures, the policy choices that are truly at stake in modem procedural due process cases. The basic choice is whether to defer to state law on the matter of administrative discretion, or to impose federally based limitations. The Article does not attempt to resolve this debate, but it concludes that a coherent set of federal limitations can be derived from existing case law in proce- dural due process and related areas. I THE EVOLUTION OF CURRENT DOCTRINE A. The Rise and Fall of the Right-Privilege Approach Despite the many controversies about the "cryptic and abstract</page><page sequence="5">1048 CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 72:1044 words of the Due Process Clause,"'14 it has always been clear that the clause applied to the conduct of criminal and civil trials. The origin of the clause lies in Chapter 39 of the Magna Carta,'5 although the actual phrase "due process of law" first appeared as part of a later revision.'6 Well before our Constitution was drafted, British jurists had defini- tively associated this phrase with a variety of protections inherent in the trial process, most notably trial by jury.17 The framers of the fifth amendment could not have doubted that the due process concept in- cluded such protections, whatever they may have thought about its ef- fect on substantive legislation.'" The framers of the fourteenth amendment were certainly of the same view.19 The extent to which the fourteenth amendment's due process clause was intended to incorpo- rate the Bill of Rights may be disputed, but it was at least intended to incorporate the due process clause of the fifth amendment. And no subsequent interpretation of either provision has seriously called its ap- plicability to judicial trials into question. 1. The Administrative State and the Problem of Dre Process The rise of the administrative state in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries created major complexities for the procedural due process doctrine. To begin with, some administrative agencies were empowered to make decisions in areas previously governed by the common law.20 The Supreme Court applied the concept of due process 14. Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co., 339 U.S. 306, 313 (1950). 15. Chapter 39 of the Magna Carta provides: "No free man shall be taken, imprisoned, disseised, outlawed, banished, or in any way destroyed, nor will We proceed against or prosecute him, except by the lawful judgment of his peers and by the law of the land." A. HOWARD, THE ROAD FROM RUNNYMEDE 388 (1968) (translation of selected portions of the Magna Carta); see also R. MoTT, supra note 1, at 30-36. 16. See R. MOTT, supra note 1, at 4-5; Miller, supra note 1, at 5. Since the Magna Carta was a personal treaty between the king and the barons, it had to be reissued in each successive reign. The term "due process" first appears in the reissue of Edward III (1354). By this time the provi- sion that contained it was Chapter 29 of the document. 17. See 4 W. BLACKSTONE, COMMENTARIES *342-43; 1 E. COKE, THE SECOND PART OF THE INSTITUTES OF THE LAWS OF ENGLAND 45-56 (4th ed. London 1797). 18. See A. HOWARD, supra note 15, at 326-31; R. MOTT, supra note 1, at 143-61. 19. See H. FLACK, THE ADOPTION OF THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT 151 (1908); R. MoTT, supra note 1, at 163-66. Before the adoption of the 14th amendment, a number of leading cases and commentaries had linked the term due process to the guarantee of fair procedure established by the Magna Carta. See, e.g., Murray's Lessee v. Hoboken Land &amp; Improvement Co., 59 U.S. (18 How.) 272, 276 (1855); Dartmouth College v. Woodward, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 517, 581 (1819) (argument of D. Webster); 2 J. STORY, COMMENTARIES ON THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES ? 1945 (5th ed. 1891). The framers of the 14th amendment can hardly have intended to exclude such traditional and authoritative interpretations, particularly since they regarded the meaning of "due process" as obvious. 20. The most familiar example is fixing rates for a particular industry. The administrative agency determines the charge for goods or services that would previously have been determined by private contract and enforced at common law. See, e.g., Arizona Grocery Co. v. Atchison, T. &amp;</page><page sequence="6">1984] ADMINISTRATIVE DUE PROCESS 1049 to these proceedings with great rigor. In essence, it held that the agency's decisionmaking must meet the procedural standards of a civil trial,21 and that even when the standards were met, only certain types of questions could be definitively decided by the agency. If the ques- tion went to the agency's jurisdiction, as in Crowell v. Benson,22 or to the constitutionality of its action, as in Ohio Valley Water Co. v. Ben Avon Borough,23 due process required de novo review. Thus, the Court not only found that due process imposed traditional procedural restric- tions upon administrative decisions, but also that it imposed absolute limits on the scope of an agency's power. During the 1940's, however, the latter part of this doctrine was significantly eroded.24 Perhaps the New Deal had persuaded the Court, if by no other means than by having populated it, that adminis- trative agencies were essential to the operation of a modem state. To put the matter in more principled terms, the Court had accepted the notion that an administrative agency, when subjected to procedural standards, could function as fairly as a judicial decisionmaker.25 S.F. Ry., 284 U.S. 370, 384 (1932); Transportation Act of 1920, ch. 91, ? 410, 41 Stat. 456, 483 (repealed 1978). 21. Eg., Ohio Bell Tel. Co. v. Public Utils. Comm'n, 301 U.S. 292 (1937); United States v. Abilene &amp; S. Ry., 265 U.S. 274 (1924); ICC v. Louisville &amp; N. Ry., 227 U.S. 88 (1913). Unlike civil trials, however, agency adjudications did not require formal rules of evidence, see, e.g., Opp Cotton Mills, Inc. v. Administrator of the Wage &amp; Hour Div. of the Dep't of Labor, 312 U.S. 126, 155 (1941); Louisville &amp; N. Ry., 227 U.S. at 93, and did not require a jury, see, e.g., NLRB v. Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp., 301 U.S. 1, 48-49 (1937); Wickwire v. Reinecke, 275 U.S. 101, 105-06 (1927). 22. 285 U.S. 22 (1932) (trial de novo required for "jurisdictional facts," i.e., facts that are conditions precedent to operation of administrative program). Croweil relies largely on a separa- tion of powers rationale rather than a due process rationale, possibly because it involved a federal agency and the former rationale was readily available. Although the Court did not need to rely on due process, some language in the opinion suggests that it might otherwise have done so. See id at 56; cf Jaffe, Judicial Review. Constitutional and Jurisdictional Fact, 70 HARV. L. REV. 953, 974- 75 (1957) (similarity of separation of powers and due process rationales). 23. 253 U.S. 287 (1920) (trial de novo required where company appealed from agency ratesetting on ground that rate effectively confiscated company's property without due process). 24. See, e.g., Federal Power Comm'n v. Hope Natural Gas Co., 320 U.S. 591, 602 (1944); Federal Power Comm'n v. Natural Gas Pipeline Co., 315 U.S. 575, 586 (1942); South Chicago Coal &amp; Dock Co. v. Bassett, 309 U.S. 251, 257-58 (1940); see also Northern Pipeline Constr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U.S. 50 (1982). 25. But see Northern Pipeline Constr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U.S. 50 (1982) (Congress may not delegate determinations of "private rights" to courts established under arti- cle I). While Justice Brennan's majority opinion distinguishes the scope of the delegation in Northern Pipeline from that in Crowell v. Benson, 285 U.S. 22 (1932), 458 U.S. at 80-86, the deci- sion seems to be a throwback to earlier views of the administrative agency. However, it is based entirely on a separation of powers rationale and not on due process concerns with the fairness of the adjudication. In fact, Justice Brennan virtually conceded that the opposite result obtains under the due process clause. After stating that Congress has the power to transfer adjudication of public rights to article I courts, he wrote: "Doubtless it could be argued that the need for in- dependent judicial determination is greatest in cases arising between the Government and an individual."

Yet everyone agrees that this consideration does</page><page sequence="7">1050 CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 72:1044 Besides traditional adjudicative powers, administrative agencies were granted two other types of power that raised procedural due pro- cess issues. First, agencies could make rules governing the substance of their adjudicative decisions. Second, agency adjudicative powers in- cluded decisionmaking about matters that had never before been adju- dicated by courts, but that resembled judicial adjudications in certain ways. This posed the question whether the requirement of due process should extend to either of these powers, as it had to the agency's powers to adjudicate traditional judicial questions. Courts ultimately decided that the due process clause was not applicable in either context. Ad- ministrative rulemaking was treated as equivalent to legislation, and was thus exempt from procedural requirements.26 The problem was to distinguish such rulemaking from the adjudications to which proce- dural due process applied. Addressing this question in Londoner v. City of Denver,27 the Supreme Court held that the enactment of a street- paving ordinance was not controlled by due process standards, even though the legislative body had apparently violated legally established rules in passing the ordinance.28 In contrast, the assessment of the cost to individual property owners was held to violate the clause, because the property owners had not been given notice and a hearing before the assessment became final.29 The Court clarified the Londoner principle several years later in Bi-Metallic Investment Co. v. State Board of Equalization.30 Bi-Metallic involved a due process challenge to an order of the State Board of Equalization that increased the valuation of all taxable property in the City of Denver by forty percent. In rejecting this challenge, Justice Holmes wrote: "Where a rule of conduct applies to more than a few people it is impracticable that every one should have a direct voice in its adoption."3 Londoner was a different case, he continued, because a "relatively small number of persons was concerned, who were excep- not yield a due process right to an article III judge. The reason, presumably, is that a deci- sionmaker does not need all the accoutrements of an article III judge to be sufficiently independ- ent of the government for due process purposes. 26. See Bi-Metallic Inv. Co. v. State Bd. of Equalization, 239 U.S. 441 (1915); Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line Co., 211 U.S. 210 (1908). 27. 210 U.S. 373 (1908). 28. Id at 378-79.

Londoner, 210 U.S. at 385-86. The assessment was also fixed by the city council, sitting as a board of equalization. Londoner thus quite clearly distinguishes rulemaking from adjudica- tion on the basis of governmental function, rather than the nature of the governmental actor.

Thus, a generally worded provision that applies to only a few persons need not conform to due process requirements, but governmental action determining the rights or obligations of nu- merous specified persons is invalid unless the mandates of due process are satisfied.33 As for the powers of administrative agencies to adjudicate matters not traditionally dealt with by common law courts, the Court again held that the due process clause did not apply. The rationale for this conclusion was the now notorious right-privilege distinction.34 As Pro- fessor Stewart has described, common law causes of action were re- garded as defining the fundamental rights of liberty and property, the natural law entitlements of individuals.35 These rights received proce- dural due process protection against government deprivation,36 just as they received substantive due process protection against regulation.37 If a matter lay beyond the limits of these rights, however, any interest that the individual could claim was necessarily a government creation that could be abolished by the same power that created it.38 It seemed chimerical to hold that a person had a right to such contingent, tempo- ral creations. Conversely, it seemed heretical to hold that the govern- ment could place whatever restrictions it wished on a person's 32. Id at 446. Justice Holmes had dissented without opinion in Londoner.

DICKINSON, ADMINISTRATIVE JUSTICE AND THE SUPREMACY OF LAW 21 (1927). The modem case that raises this issue, and invokes Londoner and Bi-Metallic, is United States v. Florida E.

Elliott, 167 U.S. 409 (1897) (deprivation of property without trial violates due process). 37. The most notable example is the "liberty of contract" doctrine. See, e.g., Adkins v. Chil- dren's Hosp., 261 U.S. 525 (1923); Adair v. United States, 208 U.S. 161 (1908); Lochner v. New York, 198 U.S. 45 (1905). 38. See, e.g., Hamilton v.

Selling ice, the courts knew, was not a privilege, but a fundamental right.39 Although the right-privilege distinction was deeply ingrained in the judicial consciousness, it was not followed with absolute consis- tency. By the beginning of this century, the Supreme Court had held that resident aliens were entitled to procedural due process protection before they could be deported,40 even though they had been granted entry as a privilege and were subject to the rules of an administrative agency. Similarly, courts concluded that certain types of licenses, al- though granted as a privilege by the government, could not be revoked without a hearing.41 Perhaps courts felt these situations involved interests that were suf- ficiently independent of the government, like the fundamental rights of common law adjudication, to require due process protection. Resident aliens had not simply been given permission to enter the United States; they had made use of that permission to develop careers, personal rela- tionships, and social reputations, all indistinguishable from those of their nationalized compatriots. Similarly, license holders were often professionals or entrepreneurs who had amassed assets and built repu- tations that went well beyond the original benefit. It was difficult for courts of this era, given their solicitude for private enterprise, to deny protection to such interests. Neither the Bi-Metallic distinction nor the right-privilege distinction was developed with great precision dur- ing the first half of this century. Perhaps the Supreme Court was too preoccupied with the stormy subject of substantive due process to devote much thought to other applications of the clause. More likely, neither doctrine addressed major social issues the way substantive due process did. Although some administrative rules may have been so specific in their application and some licensing authorities so arbitrary in their decisions that they seemed unfair, there was no general pattern of behavior that appeared outrageous to the Court or to society at large.42 There was thus little need to clarify these two doctrines, and even less need to question them. 39.

Despite the uproar over the invalidation of state legislation on substantive due process grounds, judges of this era were not particularly hostile to the government.

The Loyalty-Security Cases The advent of the loyalty-security programs of the 1940's and the 1950's marked the great watershed in the application of procedural due process to administrative agencies. These programs were designed to rid the government of subversives, and to express society's general con- demnation of leftist activity.43 Their basic strategy was not to bring criminal or civil actions, but to deny or terminate government benefits, positions, and required licenses. Federal judges-the Supreme Court Justices in particular-were frequently incensed by the vague grounds and arbitrary procedures that characterized so many of these administrative actions."' An obvi- ous solution was to apply the due process clause to the denial of bene- fits with the same rigor that it had been applied to adjudications of traditional common law rights. But the courts could not do so as long as they remained unwilling to declare that people had a right to gov- ernment benefits.45 Instead, they relied on three principal rationales to translate their concerns about loyalty-security programs into legal doc- trine: the doctrine of unconstitutional conditions, an inquiry into the government's compliance with applicable legislative or administrative authorization, and the concept of arbitrary action. a. The Unconstitutional Conditions Doctrine The unconstitutional conditions doctrine states that if the govern- strictures of due process. Courts thus invalidated legislation only when the acknowledged power of government conflicted with their more strongly held belief in liberty and property rights. 43. See generally R. BROWN, LOYALTY AND SECURITY EMPLOYMENT TESTS IN THE UNITED STATES (1958); W. GELLHORN, INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM AND GOVERNMENTAL RESTRAINTS (1956); Note, The National Security Interest and Civil Liberties, 85 HARV. L. REV. 1130 (1972). 44. This sense of outrage can be seen in the Court's use of doctrinal innovations to invalidate loyalty-security dismissals, see cases cited infra in notes 46, 50, 53, 56, 59, 61, and from the general tone of the opinions. The Justices often indicated their dismay by reproducing in their opinions transcripts of the loyalty-security investigations, many of which contained questions that would grate on virtually anyone's sensibilities. See, e.g., Greene v. McElroy, 360 U.S. 474, 489 n.16 (1959) (asking witness: "Did you ever hear it said that [petitioner's former wife] slept on a board in order to keep the common touch? ... When you were [a guest] in [her] home did she dress conventionally when she received her guests?"); Vitarelli v. Seaton, 359 U.S. 535, 541 n.4 (1959) (" 'I was wondering whether you had ever heard of Consumers Union?' "); id at 542 n.5 (" 'What were your feelings at that time concerning racial equality?' . . . 'I think you indicated . . . that you at times voted for and sponsored the principles of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Norman A. Thomas, and Henry Wallace?' "); Sweezy v. New Hampshire, 354 U.S. 234, 244 (1957) ("Did you in this last [invitational] lecture on March 22 or in any of the former lectures espouse the theory of dialectical materialism?"); id. at 260 (Frankfurter, J., concurring) (same quotation). 45.

Randall,47 invalidating a California requirement that claimants for a veteran's tax exemption swear that they did not advocate overthrow of the government, and Sherbert v. Verner,48 a free exercise case. As Jus- tice Brennan wrote in Speiser, "[t]he appellees are plainly mistaken in their argument that, because a tax exemption is a 'privilege' or 'bounty,' its denial may not infringe speech."49 The unconstitutional conditions doctrine, of course, can only be invoked when the government infringes some independently protected right.50 Most crucial questions, however, involve the way in which in- dependent rights are interpreted. Had the Supreme Court of the 1950's been prepared to hold that people had a first amendment right to join the Communist Party or to advocate the overthrow of the govern- ment,5' it could have used the doctrine to terminate the entire range of loyalty-security programs. Had it simply been prepared to hold that people had a fifth amendment right to refuse to answer questions about Communist Party membership, it could have terminated many of these programs.5 Since the Court was unwilling to reach either conclusion, its use of the doctrine was necessarily limited."3 46.

(footnote omitted). 50. In addition, the doctrine's coherence has been questioned on the ground that the govern- ment's action should be analyzed directly, rather than on the basis of its connection with other constitutional provisions. Westen, supra note 46; see also Van Alstyne, supra note 34, at 1448. 51. The Court was clearly unwilling to take this position. See Scales v. United States, 367 U.S. 203 (1961); Dennis v. United States, 341 U.S. 494 (1951). 52. The Court was also unwilling to take this position. It consistently held that the govern- ment could require answers to questions about Communist Party membership as a condition of employment. Nelson v. County of Los Angeles, 362 U.S. 1 (1960); Lerner v. Casey, 357 U.S. 468 (1958); Beilan v. Board of Educ., 357 U.S. 399 (1958). Curiously, the Court did not even rely on the unconstitutional conditions doctrine in Slochower v. Board of Higher Educ., 350 U.S. 551 (1956), which involved a dismissal from public employment for the specific reason that the em- ployee had invoked the fifth amendment. The Court did invalidate the dismissal, but it did so on the ground that invoking the fifth amendment was not evidence of guilt, and that dismissal of an employee without any evidence of wrongdoing violated due process. 53. But see infra note 82 (Court's subsequent willingness to hold loyalty-securtiy program unconstitutional on first amendment grounds).</page><page sequence="12">1984] ADMINISTRATIVE DUE PROCESS 1055 b. Improper Legislative or Administrative Authorization The second and most frequently employed rationale for attacking loyalty-security programs was to find that the government's action was improperly authorized. Again, this argument was not universally available, but it was a genuine issue in a surprising number of cases that reached the federal courts.54 When federal agencies were involved, the improper authorization analysis could have taken several forms. The most obvious approach would have employed separation of powers considerations to invalidate administrative adjudication as an exercise of the judicial function.55 Such an approach, however, would have constituted an application of the Crowell v. Benson rationale,56 and would thus have treated govern- ment benefits like common law rights.57 The Supreme Court eventually adopted an alternative, nonconsti- tutional approach that acknowledged that the legislature could delegate broad powers to administrative agencies, but that held the agency to the scope and terms of the specific delegation.58 And the Court applied the same rationale to delegations of power from the President to execu- tive agencies, where no separation of powers argument was available.59 54. See cases cited infra in notes 63-68. 55. To hold that administrative action was invalid as an exercise of improperly delegated legislative power would have struck at the heart of the administrative state, which depends on such delegations. The Supreme Court so held once, in response to the most far-reaching of the New Deal programs, The National Industrial Recovery Act, ch. 90, 48 Stat. 195 (1933). See A.L.A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. 495 (1935); cf Panama Ref. Co. v. Ryan, 293 U.S. 388 (1935) (invalidating one provision of same act). But modern courts have recognized broad congressional power to delegate legislative authority. See, e.g., American Power &amp; Light Co. v. SEC, 329 U.S. 90 (1946); Amalgamated Meat Cutters v. Connally, 337 F. Supp. 737 (D.D.C. 1971). 56. See supra note 22 and accompanying text. 57. The Court in Crowellexplicitly distinguished privileges from the rights with which it was concerned. In Chief Justice Hughes' view, "the distinction is at once apparent between cases of private right and those which arise between the Government and persons subject to its authority in connection with the performance of the constitutional functions of the executive or legislative departments." Crowell v. Benson, 285 U.S. 22, 50 (1932). With respect to the latter, all factual determinations may be delegated to legislative courts. But Crowell was a case "of private right, that is, of the liability of one individual to another under the law as defined." Id at 51. It was with respect to those cases that the Crowell doctrine of jurisdictional facts applied. See supra note 22. 58. The leading cases were Greene v. McElroy, 360 U.S. 474 (1959) (Department of Defense not authorized by Congress to deny security clearance to employees of private company on the basis of confidential information); Kent v. Dulles, 357 U.S. 116 (1958) (Secretary of State not given "unbridled discretion" to grant or withhold passports to citizens); and Cole v. Young, 351 U.S. 536 (1956) (Food &amp; Drug Administration not authorized to apply loyalty program to inspector). 59. Any general question of improper delegation of presidential power was eliminated in 1950 by the provision that is now 3 U.S.C. ? 301 (1982) (authorizing "delegation" to federal ad- ministrators of powers President received from Congress).</page><page sequence="13">1056 CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 72:1044 In other words, even if Congress or the Constitution itself had granted the President plenary power, the President had not necessarily trans- ferred that power to the agency, at least not in its pristine condition.60 An implicit principle of the delegation doctrine is that an agency must obey any rules that are applicable to it. By extension, then, an agency's own rules, as well as rules imposed by its superiors, should constrain it. Since rational administration generally requires standards of some sort, an agency will often promulgate rules in situations where its discretion is otherwise unlimited. If such rules bind the agency, courts can construe them like congressional or presidential delegations to determine whether they authorize the particular action in question.61 By the 1950's the notion that administrative agencies must follow their own rules had already been established with respect to substantive rules affecting traditional property rights.62 The principle was then ex- tended to require an agency to obey rules governing the manner of its adjudications. United States ex rel. Accardi v. Shaughnessy63 involved a procedure voluntarily adopted by the Attorney General under which requests for the suspension of deportation were first submitted to an appointed Board of Immigration Appeals. The Court held that the At- torney General, although he initially had absolute discretion to grant or deny suspensions, could not circumvent the procedure he had estab- lished by sending the Board a list of "unsavory characters" whom he wanted to deport.64 Accardiwas followed by two loyalty-security cases, 60. See, e.g., Peters v. Hobby, 349 U.S. 331 (1955) (Loyalty Review Board not authorized to hear appeals from favorable determinations of employee loyalty at the department level); Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Comm. v. McGrath, 341 U.S. 123 (1951) (Attorney General not authorized to list organizations as "communist," unless he has factual evidence, based on specific criteria, to support that designation). In Greene v. McElroy, 360 U.S. 474 (1959), the Court also held that the President had not authorized the denial of security clearances. Id at 507-08. By doing so, it avoided the question of whether the President would have an inherent power to authorize such denials without congressional authorization. 61. See generally Smolla, The Erosion of the Principle that Government Must Follow Self- Imposed Rules, 52 FORDHAM L. REV. 472, 477-81 (1984). 62. See Arizona Grocery Co. v. Atchison, T. &amp; S.F.

The Court described the ICC's power to set maximum rates as having "altered the common law." Id. at 384; cf. NLRB v. Wyman-Gordon Co., 394 U.S. 759, 765-66 (1969) (adjudicative precedents, unlike rules, may be changed by agency in appropriate circumstances).

The holding was that the Board must exercise its own discretion. This should not be read, however, as contradicting the established administrative law principle that the agency may limit adjudicatory discretion by adopting general rules.

Dulles65 and Vitarelli v. Seaton.66 Justice Harlan wrote in Vitarelli: "Having chosen to proceed against petitioner on security grounds, the Secretary here, as in Service, was bound by the regulations which he himself had promulgated for dealing with such cases, even though without such regulations he could have discharged petitioner summarily."67 Although all these cases involved pure privileges-mat- ters that were initially within the administrator's discretion68-the Court did not need to concern itself with the right-privilege distinction. Its argument did not depend on finding rights in the affected individ- ual, but in imposing limits on the agency-limits derived from the rules the agency itself had adopted. c. Arbitrary Action The review of agency decisions for their fealty to legislative, presi- dential, or internal rules proved to be a powerful tool, but it had two very obvious limitations. First, it could be circumvented by an outright grant of discretion by the legislature, coupled with an outright retention of discretion by the agency.69 Second, and even more important, fed- eral courts could not apply it to the states because the courts have no jurisdiction to interpret state laws or administrative rules, or to create a federal common law of state administrative agencies. Indeed, even the nondelegation doctrine does not generally apply when federal courts review the actions of state governments.70 The only federal basis for Instead, Accardi holds that when an agency does adopt a rule, that rule must be followed in particular cases. See Sofaer, supra note 62, at 1321-23. 65. 354 U.S. 363 (1957) (regulations for loyalty-security dismissals adopted by State Depart- ment must be followed, even for dismissal that would otherwise have been entirely discretionary). 66. 359 U.S. 535 (1959). 67.

Conn. 1981).</page><page sequence="15">1058 CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 72:1044 invalidating a state loyalty program was the Constitution. In state cases, therefore, the Court had to articulate a third way to invalidate loyalty-security programs, a constitutional one, based on the due process clause. The idea was that a state's arbitrary or irrational action is itself a violation of due process. By arbitrary action, the Court generally meant that the state agency had failed to follow applicable rules, or that it had failed to employ certain minimum procedures. Of course, invalidation of a benefit termination on this ground, the Court hastened to add, did not imply that people had a right to governmental benefits.7 Rather, it meant that due process constraints always apply to the manner in which a state carries out adjudications or similar de- terminations. Thus, even if the state could abolish a certain benefit entirely, it could not deny that benefit to individuals by arbitrary means. Although the arbitrary action doctrine represented a significant advance in due process jurisprudence, it was neither clearly articulated nor consistently employed. Nonetheless, it served as the basis of a number of significant decisions,72 and proved sufficiently vigorous to 71. Virtually every one of these decisions explicitly disclaims that forbidden notion. See, e.g., Slochower v. Board of Higher Educ., 350 U.S. 551, 559 (1956) ("This is not to say that Slochower has a constitutional right to be an associate professor of German at Brooklyn Col- lege."); Wieman v. Updegraff, 344 U.S. 183, 192 (1952) ("We need not pause to consider whether an abstract right to public employment exists."). The one area where the Court expressed some doubt about the state's plenary power was in the bar admission cases. See Willner v. Committee on Character &amp; Fitness, 373 U.S. 96 (1963); Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners, 353 U.S. 232 (1957). But even here the Court was unwilling to commit itself, see id. at 239 n.5 ("We need not enter into a discussion whether the practice of law is a 'right' or 'privilege.' "). Apart from its unsurprising empathy for attorneys, the Court's doubts may have arisen from the fact that bar admission is more akin to a license to pursue a private calling than it is to a public benefit. See supra text accompanying notes 40-41. But the real issue involves the nature of the government's actions. See infra text accompanying notes 465-75. 72. See, e.g., Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners, 353 U.S. 232, 239-44, 247 (1957) (unani- mous decision) (denying applicant permission to take bar examination on grounds of arrest rec- ord, use of aliases, and long-past membership in Communist Party, but without any evidence of bad moral character, is so arbitrary and irrational that it violates due process); Slochower v. Board of Higher Educ., 350 U.S. 551, 557-59 (1956) (automatic dismissal from teaching position for invocation of privilege against self-incrimination violates due process, because guilt cannot be inferred from exercise of privilege); Wieman v. Updegraff, 344 U.S. 183, 190-92 (1952) (unani- mous decision) (state law barring person from employment solely because of membership in or- ganization, with no requirement that the person have actual knowledge of the organization's goals, is so arbitrary that it violates due process). Four justices dissented in Slochower. Justice Harlan argued that a statute providing for auto- matic dismissal does not presume guilt, but rather punishes refusal to cooperate. 350 U.S. at 566 (Harlan, J., dissenting). This later became the Court's standard position. A possible distinction on doctrinal grounds is that in all the subsequent cases, the questions that the individuals refused to answer were posed by the affected person's actual employer or licensing agency. In Slochower, the statute provided that any invocation of the privilege against self-incrimination required dis- missal, and the particular case involved questions posed by a body totally unrelated to Slochower's employment. In that situation, the notion that the statute simply punishes a refusal to cooperate is less clear, and a stronger argument can thus be made for the arbitrariness of the</page><page sequence="16">1984] ADMINISTRATIVE DUE PROCESS 1059 resist, albeit in diluted form, a major congressional effort to limit the Court's jurisdiction.73 The reason for its appeal may have been its con- nection with two major themes of related Court decisions. First, the federal administrative cases had established the principle that an agency must follow applicable rules, whether such rules were generated by the legislature, the President, or the agency itself. To be sure, these decisions were based on nonconstitutional grounds, but it was only a short step to hold that due process also required obedience to rules. This principle generally appeared as a requirement that a state have some evidentiary basis for its adjudications, but such a requirement would be irrelevant unless the state was required to follow applicable rules in particular cases.74 What was explicit was the principle's inde- pendence from the right-privilege distinction, since its operation did not depend on the individual's right, but on the existence of a binding state enactment.75 dismissal. Cf Beilan v. Board of Pub. Educ., 357 U.S. 399, 423-24 (1958) (Brennan, J., dissenting) (timing of inquiry by employer suggests that actual concern was triggered by employee's refusal to answer questions before unrelated body, thus dismissal was totally arbitrary). 73. This effort, which provides a political explanation for the retreat from Slochower, was the Jenner-Butler bill. S. 2646, 85th Cong., 1st Sess. (1957). Originally introduced in 1957 by Senator Jenner to deny the federal courts jurisdiction over loyalty-security and bar admissions programs, the bill was reintroduced the following year with the cosponsorship of Senator Butler, S. 3386, 85th Cong., 2d Sess. (1958), as a more limited proposal to deny the Supreme Court jurisdiction over state bar admission cases. The latter bill was defeated by a close vote. See generally W. MURPHY, CONGRESS AND THE COURT (1962). Following these events, a series of Supreme Court decisions came down sustaining employee dismissals and bar admission denials for loyalty-secu- rity reasons. See, e.g., Cafeteria &amp; Restaurant Workers Union, Local 473 v. McElroy, 367 U.S. 886 (1961); In re Anastaplo, 366 U.S. 82 (1961); Konigsberg v. State Bar, 366 U.S. 36 (1961); Nelson v. County of Los Angeles, 362 U.S. 1 (1960); Lerner v. Casey, 357 U.S. 468 (1958); Beilan v. Board of Pub. Educ., 357 U.S. 399 (1958). It is not clear how extensively the Jenner-Butler bill affected the Court. There had been several cases sustaining loyalty-security programs prior to 1957-58, see, e.g., Barsky v. Board of Regents, 347 U.S. 442 (1954); Adler v. Board of Educ., 342 U.S. 485 (1952); Garner v. Board of Pub. Works, 341 U.S. 716 (1951), and there were several important decisions striking down loy- alty-security actions shortly after that date, see, e.g., Willner v. Committee on Character &amp; Fitness, 373 U.S. 96 (1963); Greene v. McElroy, 360 U.S. 474 (1959). Moreover, almost all the decisions upholding loyalty-security actions after Jenner-Butler were based on the ground that an em- ployee's refusal to provide information about his political associations was a valid, and thus nonarbitrary, basis for dismissal. This position did not conflict with the existing due process ra- tionale. To reject it, the Court was required to articulate a new first amendment right to have such inquiries regarded as invalid. See, e.g., Shelton v. Tucker, 364 U.S. 479 (1960); infra note 82 (citing cases that ultimately accepted this position). 74. See Konigsberg v. State Bar, 353 U.S. 252, 261-74 (1957); Schware v. Board of Bar Ex- aminers, 353 U.S. 232, 238-46 (1957); Slochower v. Board of Higher Educ., 350 U.S. 551, 558-59 (1956). 75. Another significant case based on a similar rationale is Sweezy v. New Hampshire, 354 U.S. 234 (1957). The Court's somewhat obscure opinion seems at certain points to espouse the forbidden position that a state legislature's delegation of power can violate the federal Constitu- tion, see supra note 70, but it ultimately abjures that position, 354 U.S. at 255. The real holding seems to be that the Legislature's delegation of power to the Attorney General was so broad and uncertain that it was impossible to determine whether he was following the rules and requirements</page><page sequence="17">1060 CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 72:1044 The second notion was that fair procedures were a "fundamental right," central to a "scheme of ordered liberty."''76 This was the prevail- ing rationale by which procedural requirements for criminal trials and investigations were imposed upon the states. Sentencing an unrepre- sented defendant to death,77 interrogating him for thirty-six hours with- out respite,78 or pumping his stomach to obtain essential evidence7" were held to violate fundamental principles of fairness implicit in the concept of due process. Similarly, the Court reasoned, reaching factual conclusions without a hearing constituted a due process violation.so Such a practice smacked of Star Chamber Courts, bills of attainder, arrests without trial, and other measures that constitute our historical image of oppresssion. Again, by viewing minimal procedures them- selves as a fundamental right, courts avoided the distinction between rights and privileges. 3. Goldberg v. Kelly and the Welfare Rights Cases By the 1960's, loyalty-security programs had ceased to be a major social issue.8' The dampening of the controversy occurred at the same time, and was possibly a reason for the Court's increasing willingness to hold that loyalty requirements violated the first amendment.82 As the Legislature had established. Id. at 253-54. Strictly speaking, Sweezy is not an administrative case, since the Attorney General was acting, under the statutes, as a "one man legislative commit- tee." Id at 237.

Updegraff, 344 U.S. 183, 191 (1952) ("In- discriminate classification of innocent with knowing activity must fall as an assertion of arbitrary power. The oath offends due process."). By the 1960's, the Court was more specific about the requirements of due process. In Willner v. Committee on Character &amp; Fitness, 373 U.S. 96 (1963), the Court held that an applicant was entitled to notice and a hearing, including the right to cross-examine adverse witnesses, before being denied admission to the bar. Id. at 106.

Naturally, the desire to prevent the termination of benefits sug- gested an appeal to the courts on procedural due process grounds. Lower federal courts decided a number of these cases, using the ap- proach followed in the loyalty-security decisions. Though doggedly maintaining that there was no right to government benefits, they struck down a variety of administrative procedures as arbitrary or irrational.85 As in previous cases, agency failure to follow preestablished rules and to provide certain minimum procedures in reaching factual determina- tions was found to constitute arbitrary action. The problem was the potential scope of the welfare rights cases. While the loyalty-security decisions had concerned only a single administrative program, whose primary importance lay in its political and symbolic implications, the new trend implicated virtually the entire range of administrative de- cisions. In 1970, the Supreme Court finally decided a paradigmatic welfare rights case. Goldberg v. Kelly86 addressed the specific issue whether the due process clause required New York City to give welfare recipients an evidentiary hearing before terminating their benefits. With the crea- tive spirit that comes from ultimate authority, the Court ignored its loyalty-security decisions and advanced a new rationale to decide the tion). Some loyalty requirements continued to pass constitutional scrutiny. See, e.g., Law Stu- dents Civil Rights Research Council v. Wadmond, 401 U.S. 154 (1971). But when the Court did strike down a loyalty provision--and it did so with increasing frequency-it tended to rely directly on first amendment grounds. 83. See generally J. AXINN &amp; H.

The opinion, written by Justice Brennan, began with the familiar declaration that "[t]he constitutional challenge cannot be answered by an argument that public assistance benefits are 'a "privilege" and not a "right."' "87 The opinion suggested instead that the entire distinction be abandoned, since "[i]t may be realistic today to regard welfare enti- tlements as more like 'property' than a 'gratuity.' "88 The proper basis for decision, the opinion continued, should be "whether the recipient's interest in avoiding [the] loss outweighs the governmental interest in summary adjudication."89 Applying this test, Justice Brennan con- cluded that even a temporary deprivation of one's welfare benefits is sufficiently serious to require an evidentiary hearing before termination.90 There are probably several reasons why the Court did not use the doctrine of the loyalty-security cases in Goldberg. First, the welfare rights movement had produced a change in emphasis. Commentators were focusing on the instrinsic importance of the benefits themselves, instead of the unfairness of government procedures for determining these benefits.91 Moreover, neither of the basic elements by which pro- cedural unfairness had been judged in the past seemed relevant in Goldberg. Fidelity to applicable rules was not an issue, because New York City had followed its rules in every detail,92 and there was no suggestion of specific animus toward the individuals involved.93 As for the fundamental right to minimum procedures, intervening judicial de- velopments had rendered the notion somewhat quaint by 1970. The fundamental rights approach, central to the Court's criminal procedure rulings at the time of the loyalty-security cases, had long been criticized by Justice Black as conceptually identical to substantive due process.94 87.

Reich's basic argument was that government benefits were now as economically important as private possessions (hence the term "new property"). To distinguish between them, he pointed out, was to revive the discredited idea that free enterprise was a constitutionally preferred activity. Instead, the protections of constitutional law should attach equally to both types of property. Reich viewed procedural due process as simply one of these constitutional protections. His central point was the importance of the benefits to individuals. 92.

This approach was basically adopted, albeit incrementally;96 by 1970, it was essentially complete,97 and fundamental rights language had virtually disappeared from the Court's procedural due process opinions." Having labored so long to eliminate this approach in the field of criminal procedure, the Court was understandably reluctant to resurrect it in administrative cases. Perhaps the most significant reason why the Goldberg Court ig- nored the arbitrary action rationale, however, was that the question whether welfare benefits merit procedural protection was not presented in the case. New York City had already conceded that point and pro- vided a post-termination hearing that generally complied with due pro- cess requirements." The only issue, as Justice Brennan emphasized, was whether a hearing was required prior to the termination. I' On the crucial question whether an individual is entitled to any hearing, or to due process rights in general, the opinion is essentially silent. Its direct contribution in this area was only to deal one more blow-the fatal one, as it turned out-to the already moribund right-privilege distinc- tion. Indirectly, of course, Goldberg was profoundly influential. It sig- naled the Court's willingness to extend due process protections to the daily operations of virtually every state and federal administrative agency, and thus to a vast range of government benefits that had not been explicitly protected by due process prior to that time. Goldberg and its immediate successors are sometimes portrayed as articulating an "interest" standard for determining the applicability of the due process clause.'01 But Goldberg, as noted, deals with the issue of timing, not applicability. Arguably, some notion of an applicability 95. See Adamson v. California, 332 U.S. 46, 90 (1947) (Black, J., dissenting). 96. The doctrine that emerged was termed "selective incorporation." The case that began the process was Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643 (1961), which recognized the incorporation of the fourth amendment's exclusionary rule. 97. See Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145 (1968). 98. Of course, the Court did create a "fundamental rights or interests" strand to equal pro- tection analysis. See, e.g., Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U.S. 618 (1969) (interstate travel); Harper v. Virginia Bd. of Elections, 383 U.S. 663 (1966) (voting); Douglas v. California, 372 U.S. 353 (1963) (access to courts). Perhaps the Court felt less uncomfortable using an open-ended standard to interpret the equal protection clause, since that clause had not played a major role in the pre-1937 rejection of state legislation. It is suggestive that Justice Harlan, for whom substantive due process held no terrors, see Poe v. Ullman, 367 U.S. 497, 548-55 (1961) (Harlan, J., dissenting), argued that Douglas should have been decided solely on due process grounds. Douglas, 372 U.S. at 361 (Harlan, J., dissenting). 99.

In fact, the Court apparently did not consider the problem, probably because the cases did not re- quire it to do so. 03 The interest standard for the applicability of the due process clause came somewhat more to the forefront in Fuentes v. Shevin.' Fuentes did not involve welfare rights, but arose from the related con- sumer rights movement.050 The issue in the case was whether state agents could repossess goods purchased through a conditional sales contract if the buyer was not provided with prior notice and a hearing. As in Goldberg, only the right to a prior hearing was involved; no one questioned that the buyer was entitled to the full range of procedural rights in a subsequent challenge to the repossession. Justice Stewart, writing for the Court, tracked Goldberg by focusing on the individual's interest as the crucial question in determining the timing of the hearing. 102. See Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254, 262-63 (1970), where the Court stated: "The extent to which procedural due process must be afforded the recipient is influenced by the extent to which he may be 'condemned to suffer grievous loss .... .'" (quoting Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Comm. v. McGrath, 341 U.S. 123, 168 (1951) (Frankfurter, J., concurring)). The language sug- gests that individual interest helped determine the extent of due process protection, rather than the clause's applicability in a particular case. 103. Wisconsin v. Constantineau, 400 U.S. 433 (1971), for example, involved a state law that permitted officials such as police chiefs to post notices in liquor stores forbidding the sale of liquor to specified persons engaging in "excessive drinking." The Court had little difficulty holding that the state could not attach the sobriquet of drunkeness without notice and a hearing. Justice Douglas' opinion required only four paragraphs to establish the point, id at 436-37, and the Court was unanimous on it. Three justices dissented from the decision, believing that the Court should have allowed the state courts to consider the validity of the statute first, but they made clear that they would have joined the majority had they been willing to reach the merits. Id at 439-40 (Burger, C.J., dissenting); id at 443-44 (Black, J., dissenting). The Court's rationale was that the notice was "a stigma, an official branding of a person." Id at 437. While Justice Douglas referred to the individual's interest, the thrust of the decision was the nature of the state's action in posting the notice. In essence, the Court held that the action was arbitrary for lack of minimum procedures, although the Court again eschewed the language of its previous decisions. Cf Jenkins v. McKeithen, 395 U.S. 411 (1969) (board of inquiry's action iden- tifying violators of criminal law in labor relations action violated due process clause). Another case that has been described as articulating a generalized interest standard for due process is Bell v. Burson, 402 U.S. 535 (1971). See Monaghan, supra note 4, at 407-08. The case involved suspension of a driver's license. While the Court's opinion does acknowledge the essen- tial nature of a driver's license in today's society, Bell, 402 U.S. at 539, the decision turns on the preclusion of various issues from the suspension determination. In fact, Bell is an irrebuttable presumptions case, not a true procedural due process case. See infra note 384. 104. 407 U.S. 67 (1972). 105. On the consumer rights movement, see generally D. CAPLOVITZ, THE POOR PAY MORE (1963); E. Cox, R. FELLMETH &amp; J. SCHULTZ, "THE NADER REPORT" ON THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION (1969); W. MAGNUSON &amp; J. CARPER, THE DARK SIDE OF THE MARKETPLACE (1968); R. NADER, UNSAFE AT ANY SPEED (1965). This movement spawned a number of Supreme Court decisions in addition to Fuentes. See, e.g., Swarb v. Lennox, 405 U.S. 191 (1972) (confes- sions of judgment); Sniadach v. Family Fin. Corp., 395 U.S. 337 (1969) (wage garnishment).</page><page sequence="22">1984] ADMINISTRA TIVE DUE PROCESS 1065 But to Justice Stewart, it was not immediately apparent whether the buyer had any interest at all. He acknowledged that the buyer did not have title to the goods,'06 and that repossession was not a final judg- ment.107 However, he found the requisite interest in the conditional sales contract. "Clearly," he wrote, "this possessory interest in the goods, dearly bought and protected by contract, was sufficient to in- voke the protection of the Due Process Clause."'08 Since Justice Stewart found the property interest he sought, this aspect of the deci- sion received relatively little notice. But the straw man that he so read- ily disposed of in Fuentes was about to become a figure of considerable substance. B. The Rise and Falter of the Liberty-Property Approach 1. Board of Regents v. Roth The current approach of the Supreme Court, and the current ag- ony of procedural due process, began a few weeks after Fuentes v. Shevinl'09 in Board of Regents v. Roth."l0 At issue in Roth were the procedures that administrators of a public university had to follow before refusing to renew an untenured faculty member's contract. Justice Stewart's opinion for the Court proceeded in three basic steps. First, he declared that only certain types of interests constituted the sort of "liberty or property" protected by the due process clause."' Next, he defined the liberty interest and concluded that Roth's interest in re- newal did not qualify."2 Finally, he defined the property interest and concluded that Roth did not have a property interest either."'3 In declaring that due process protection applied "only to the depri- vation of interests encompassed by the Fourteenth Amendment's pro- tection of liberty and property,""ll4 Justice Stewart seemed simply to restate the text of the amendment itself. The district court, he wrote, had held due process protection applicable "by assessing and balancing the weights of the particular interests involved.""' But Justice Stewart found that approach unacceptable: "[T]o determine whether due pro- cess requirements apply in the first place, we must look not to the 106. Fuentes, 407 U.S. at 86. 107.

More- over, the interest in Goldberg was the hardship of a temporary financial deprivation, which did not fit very well under the rubric of either lib- erty or property. But Roth did much more than repudiate Goldberg. Goldberg had assessed the individual's interest only to determine the proper timing of due process rights whose basic existence was con- ceded. In shifting from the weight of the interest to the nature of the interest, Roth also shifted from the question of when the hearing was required to the question of whether the hearing was required at all. Although this shift was obviously crucial to Justice Stewart's anal- ysis, he did not offer any reason for it. The shift was hardly compelled, since the explicit issue in Roth, as in Goldberg, was whether the individ- ual was entitled to a hearing before termination. One possible explana- tion is a sort of linguistic one. In deciding to move from the weight of the interest to its nature, Justice Stewart shifted from a relative to a categorical standard. It may thus have seemed natural to apply the standard used to analyze the categorical question of whether a hearing was required, rather than the relative question of when the hearing was required. But this does not explain why Justice Stewart made the shift from weight to nature in the first place. For that answer, Roth's doctri- nal predecessors provide at least a clue. The Roth opinion cites only Morrissey v. Brewer"' for the proposi- tion that the nature of the interest determines whether due process re- quirements are applicable. Morrissey, decided the same day as Roth, held that informal hearings were required before termination of a con- victed criminal's parole. Because a valid criminal conviction obviously restricts an individual's right to be at liberty, the Court posed the threshold question whether the parolee had any legally cognizable in- terest at all."" Only then did it consider whether that interest was suffi- cient to justify the imposition of minimum procedures. Morrissey itself cited only one precedent for this analysis-Justice Stewart's opinion in Fuentes v. Shevin.119 And as noted, Justice Stewart was quite con- cerned in Fuentes about whether a person buying goods through a con- ditional sales contract had any rights at all. 20 Thus, in Roth's doctrinal predecessors, one decided the same day and the other a few 116.

This possibility tended to suggest an either-or, categorical determination, rather than a sliding-scale, balancing approach. Justice Stewart had previously shown a predilection for individual interest analysis in Cafeteria &amp; Restaurant Workers Union, Local 473.121 Writing for the majority, he denied due process protection to a cook excluded from the military facility where she worked by focusing on the minimal interest the cook had in the position, as well as the strength of the government's interest in summary exclusion. But Cafe- teria Workers assessed the weight of the individual interest, not its na- ture.122 By taking the additional step in Roth, Justice Stewart essentially obliterated the arbitrary action rationale that had domi- nated the Court's due process thinking for two decades. Instead, he employed an approach quite similar to the right-privilege distinction, establishing one category of individual interests to which due process applies, and another to which it does not. This seems particularly odd since Justice Stewart had clearly restated the Court's repudiation of the right-privilege distinction in the paragraph of the Roth opinion that im- mediately followed his articulation of the applicable standard.123 The real explanation for the Roth analysis may lie in the extent to which the Burger Court majority, which was just taking shape at this time,124 was troubled by the expansive nature of the Warren Court doc- trines it had inherited. Its response was to limit rather than overturn these doctrines, by establishing well-defined boundaries that restricted the number of cases in which they would operate. The Court's deci- sions on standing are perhaps the most notable example of this re- sponse.125 Others include the reinvigoration of the state action concept,'26 and the elimination of various grounds for habeas corpus 121. 367 U.S. 886 (1961). 122. See id. at 894 ("[The] question cannot be answered by easy assertion that, because she had no constitutional right to be there in the first place, she was not deprived of liberty or property by the Superintendent's action."). Although Justice Stewart did refer to the "nature" of the em- ployee's interest, id at 895, 896, he did so in the process of balancing that interest against the government's interest. 123. Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 571 (1972) ("[T]he Court has fully and finally rejected the wooden distinction between 'rights' and 'privileges' that once seemed to govern the applicability of procedural due process rights.") (footnote omitted). 124. President Nixon's four appointees--Chief Justice Burger, and Justices Blackmun, Powell and Rehnquist-were all on the Court when Roth was decided, although Justice Powell did not participate in the case. The other three, together with Justices Stewart and White, comprised the Roth majority. Justices Douglas, Brennan and Marshall dissented. 125. See, e.g., Simon v. Eastern Ky.

NLRB,</page><page sequence="25">1068 CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 72:1044 review. 27 Given this general predilection for restrictive boundaries, the Court's search for a limitation on the categories of interests protected by due process seems natural. Conscious of the power that administra- tive agencies wield in the modem state, it was not prepared to revive the right-privilege distinction and thereby insulate most administrative actions from due process review. But it was also clearly anxious to limit Goldberg, whose vast implications for administrative law were al- ready being felt. Consequently, the Roth majority followed its right- privilege predecessors, refusing to equate due process requirements ap- plicable to administrative agencies with due process concepts associ- ated with court adjudications. Having established that only certain categories of individual inter- ests merit due process protection, Justice Stewart assumed, without dis- cussion, that those categories are identified by the terms "liberty" and "property" as they appear in the text of the fourteenth amendment. He then proceeded to consider whether Roth could assert any such inter- est. He defined liberty expansively,128 quoting the resounding language of Meyer v. Nebraska,'29 a noneconomic substantive due process case. In assessing the factual situation of Roth, however, he identified two more discrete and carefully defined strands of protected liberty: the right to one's good name, and the right to pursue one's chosen occupation. 130 Turning to the property interest, Justice Stewart adopted a notably different approach. Instead of articulating specific illustrations of inter- ests inherent in the concept, he assessed the nature of the property con- cept itself: "To have a property interest in a benefit, a person clearly S. . must have more than a unilateral expectation of it. He must, in- stead, have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it."'3 1 Justice Stewart was then able to define the sort of entitlements that would constitute property interests with surprising ease: "Property interests, of course, are not created by the Constitution. Rather they are created and their 424 U.S. 507 (1976) (Stewart, J.); Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co., 419 U.S. 345 (1974) (Rehn- quist, J.); Moose Lodge No. 107 v.

Had the case presented the issue, Justice Stewart would un- doubtedly have identified a third element: the right to be free of bodily restraint. Although no particular textual support exists in the 14th amendment for any of these elements, they are cer- tainly more precise than the term "liberty" itself. 131.

Being unwilling to do so, for rea- sons stated above, he was compelled to recognize that administrative regulations were as much a source of law as judicial decisions. He then had to create a new, and indeed unprecedented distinction: not be- tween private and public rights, but between rights defined by some positive law and rights, or nonrights, that were not. 2. The "Underlying Rights" Cases of the Mid-1970's The Roth opinion had an immediate impact. It was new, it was written in definitive terms, and it served the Supreme Court's purposes. What was not apparent at the time were its far-reaching implications. Two years after Board of Regents v. Roth,134 in Arnett v. Ken- nedy,'35 the Court had to decide whether a federal civil service em- ployee could be dismissed without a prior evidentiary hearing. 132. Id 133. Justice Stewart did state that "[c]ertain attributes of 'property' interests protected by pro- cedural due process emerge from [prior] decisions." Id at 577. Of the six cases he cited, however, five held that an individual had a right to procedural due process in a given administrative con- text: Connell v. Higgenbotham, 403 U.S. 207 (1971) (dismissal from public employment); Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254 (1970) (termination of welfare benefits); Slochower v. Board of Higher Educ., 350 U.S. 551 (1956) (dismissal from public employment); Wieman v. Updegraff, 344 U.S. 183 (1952) (same); Goldsmith v. Board of Tax Appeals, 270 U.S. 117 (1926) (denial of permission to practice law before a public agency). All of these cases involved interests created by state law, but the Court's willingness to extend procedural protection to these interests does not necessarily imply that there is some other set of interests not based on state law to which such protection would be denied. While the cases Justice Stewart cited support his statement that the right-privilege distinction had been rejected, they hardly support the creation of another some- what similar distinction in its place. The sixth case cited, Flemming v. Nestor, 363 U.S. 603 (1960), was the only one that denied the individual relief. Nestor involved a challenge to a federal law that terminated the Social Se- curity benefits of certain deported aliens, particularly those who had been deported for being members of the Communist Party. While the Court denied relief on the ground that the benefit termination was validly enacted general legislation, it acknowledged in dictum that the individ- ual's interest in the benefits was "of sufficient substance to fall within the protection from arbitrary governmental action afforded by the Due Process Clause," id at 611, and this was the page Justice Stewart cited. See Roth, 408 U.S. at 576. That language hardly requires the conclusion that there is some closed category of property rights that qualify for due process protection, particularly since the Nestor Court emphasized that the individual's interest, although qualified for such pro- tection, was not "property."

He held that such an interest clearly was created by the civil service statute that prohibited dismissal of em- ployees "except for such causes as will promote the efficiency of [the] service.""36 But he also found that this same statute also specified the procedures to be followed in divesting the employee of that interest. These procedures defined the limits of the employee's interest, and thus the limits of its constitutional protection; the employee could not obtain the benefits of the statute without being subject to its limitations. As Justice Rehnquist wrote, he must "take the bitter with the sweet."'37 The bitterness that the Arnett plurality would inflict is an under- standable extension of Roth. If the government can control the crea- tion of property, it should be able to create property that is subject to various limitations, either substantive or procedural in nature. This would, in effect, eliminate one of the two elements of due process that had been identified by the arbitrary action rationale:'38 the clause would no longer impose minimum procedures on adjudications, and would only require that government decisionmakers follow applicable rules. Six members of the Court, whose positions were most fully stated in Justice Powell's concurrence, found this view unacceptable.139 They 136.

Presumably, however, the Court's concern is with the decision's extensive discussion of the amount of process due. But see infra note 142. The process due discussion is problematic on the basis of the Court's recent decisions, see, e.g., infra text accompanying notes 388-439, whereas the discussion of the due process clause's applicability is consistent with the weight of recent authority, see, e.g., Vitek v.

Consequently, the government could neither reduce procedural rights directly, nor do so indirectly by conditioning a substantive right on their reduction. 40 To this extent at least, the pur- pose of the due process clause was to make life somewhat more sweet, without permitting the government to make it once again more bitter. The result, of course, was to concede that the due process clause itself generated concrete and absolute requirements: the minimum proce- dures that had been regarded as a fundamental right in the loyalty- security cases.141 The resolution achieved in Justice Powell's concurrence in Arnett v. Kennedy, and reiterated in several other cases, 42 was not, however, a stable one. This became apparent two years later in Bishop v.

Id at 565. 140. Id at 164-67 (Powell, J., concurring). 141. The approach used in Arnett, and the more general approach initiated by Roth, are often described as "positivist." See Mashaw, supra note 4, at 888-95. The term is meant to indicate that the Court requires some underlying positive law right before the due process protections apply. This is not the same as the legal philosophy of positivism, however. Positivism, roughly speaking, maintains that all true legal rules originate from some authoritative source. See generally H.L.A. HART, THE CONCEPT OF LAW (1961). The due process clause obviously has such a source. Being part of the Constitution, it is itself a positive law right in the jurisprudential sense. The Court has held that this positive law right should be interpreted as creating procedural protections for rights generated by other positive laws, i.e., substantive rights, rather than creating procedural protec- tions that exist independently of those rights. This is not positivism, but the Court's own due process philosophy. There is nothing in positivist theory to suggest that the lawmaking authority cannot create purely procedural rights, unattached to any underlying right. In fact, the notion that there is any constraint upon that authority in doing so, as the Supreme Court may believe, see infra text accompanying notes 275-83, would be a natural law argument of sorts, in direct conflict with the positivist approach. As a result, this Article describes the Court's theory of procedural due process as an underlying rights approach, rather than a "positivist" one. 142. See, e.g., Goss v. Lopez, 419 U.S. 565, 573 (1975) (since state law created entitlement to education, student could not be suspended from school without prior hearing, even though sus- pension was pursuant to state law); see also Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 332 (1976). Curi- ously, Justice Powell rejected his own Arnett approach in Goss, and adopted Justice Rehnquist's. His dissent argued that "the very legislation which 'defines' the 'dimension' of the student's enti- tlement, while providing a right to education generally, does not establish this right free of disci- pline imposed in accord with Ohio law." Goss, 419 U.S. at 586 (Powell, J., dissenting). He then labored to distinguish his Arnett concurrence, arguing that termination of employment and sus- pension (as opposed to expulsion) of a student were qualitatively different. Id at 587 n.4. How- ever, the distinction he draws goes to the weight of the interest, not its nature; presumably the latter is decisive in Justice Powell's approach in Arnett. Justice Powell's shift here might be indica- tive of the doctrinal instability. Perhaps, therefore, the Court will address the Arnett issue in Loudermill v. Cleveland Bd. of Educ., 721 F.2d 550 (6th Cir. 1983), cert.granted, 104 S. Ct. 2384 (1984), rather than merely discussing the amount of process due. See supra note 138.

The applicable city ordinance set out several bases for dismissal of a permanent em- ployee and specified certain procedures, not including a pretermination hearing. The Court conceded that such an ordinance might create a prop- erty right for fourteenth amendment purposes. "However,. . . the or- dinance may also be construed as granting no right to continued employment, but merely conditioning an employee's removal on com- pliance with certain specified procedures."'" Indeed, the Court fol- lowed the district court by construing the ordinance in just that fashion.'45 As a result, the policeman was entitled only to those proce- dures specified in the statute. The Bishop opinion is closely related to the "bitter-sweet" rationale of the Arnett plurality, as all four dissenters charged.'46 Although Bishop does not allow the government simulta- neously to create a property right and the procedures to eliminate that right, it does allow it to declare that a property right was not created, and then prescribe procedures governing deprivations of the underly- ing and now-demoted interest.147 This tends to eliminate most of the limits that the Arnett concurrence would impose. Statutes governing benefit programs generally include both criteria for granting the benefit and procedures for taking it away; only rarely do they contain explicit declarations that a property right has been created. Unless the state concedes the existence of a property right, therefore, the Bishop ap- proach would allow courts to deny it in most situations. There was, however, even more to come. When Justice Stewart held in Roth that the due process clause's property interest was deter- mined by positive law, it apparently did not occur to him that the lib- erty interest should be similarly determined. Instead, he invoked a substantive due process case to define the fundamental interest in lib- erty'48 and then articulated two aspects of liberty that were clearly fed- 144.

The importance of this grant of power to the government, in practical terms, will depend upon the way the applicable statute or regulation is interpreted. Bishop allows the government's negation of a property right to be implicit as well as explicit.

In fact, the Court contrasted the specification of procedures with the creation of a constitu- tionally protected property right. Id. at 347. 148. See Board of Regents v.

But it is also not surprising, given the rhetoric of Roth and the predilections of the Burger Court majority, that the view of what constitutes liberty would begin to move toward the prevailing view of what constitutes property. The case that initiated the movement toward a positive law defini- tion of "liberty" was probably Wolff v. McDonnell,'53 though the hold- ing actually extended the scope of due process protection. In Wolf, prison officials had denied inmates good-time credits that they would otherwise have been entitled to, on grounds of misconduct. The Court conceded that there was no constitutional guarantee of good-time credit. But "having created the right to good time and itself recogniz- ing that its deprivation is a sanction authorized for major miscon- duct,"L54 the state acknowledged the liberty interest involved and could not deny the credit without minimum procedures. The Court could have found that the state's failure to employ its own procedures ren- dered the state's action arbitrary."55 Instead, the Court reasoned that the existence of rules governing good-time credits had created a liberty interest, and that "[t]his analysis as to liberty parallels the accepted due process analysis as to property."'56 What Justice White probably meant was that liberty interests over and above those inherent in the due process clause could be created by state law, just as property interests of all kinds were created. But once the parallel between liberty and property interests had been articulated, it was a small step for the Court to find that the liberty interest, like the 149. See Board of Regents v.

Davis 1'57 and Meachum v. Fano.'58 These cases modify Wolff much the same way Roth modified Goldberg. In both, the Court began by extending the guarantee of minimum proce- dures to additional, statutorily created interests, and ended by holding that it applied only to such interests. Paul v. Davis'159 is one of the most peculiar opinions in due process jurisprudence. A police department had compiled a list of "active shoplifters" largely on the basis of arrest records, and had distributed it to local merchants. It seemed apparent, based on the existing prece- dents, that such an action would be held unconstitutional as arbitrary "stigmatization" of an individual. But Justice Rehnquist's majority opinion insisted that a positive law liberty interest was required before due process protection applied, and he found no such interest. State law, he wrote, "does not extend to [an individual] any legal guarantee of present enjoyment of reputation which has been altered as a result of [the police department's] actions."'60 Admittedly, the plaintiff might have been able to sue the police department for defamation, a state law cause of action. But to regard this as a due process interest, Justice Rehnquist argued, "would make of the Fourteenth Amendment a font of tort law to be superimposed upon whatever systems may already be administered by the States."161 The most obvious difficulty with Paul was the unbroken line of cases, extending back to the loyalty-security era, that had imposed due process requirements on government action when that action stigma- tized a person. Justice Rehnquist expended substantial energy distin- guishing these cases by asserting that they all had involved the loss of something more than reputation.162 This argument was at its most ba- roque when discussing two other cases that involved an administrative agency's "undesirables list"-Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee v. McGrath'63 and Wisconsin v. Constantineau.'64 The third such case, Jenkins v.

Roth involved dismissal-admit- tedly something more than reputation-but it discussed stigmatization as a government action quite distinct from dismissal.167 Because Roth spoke the same language as Paul, its delineation of stigma avoidance as a separate interest established by the Constitution was quite clear and quite difficult to explain away. Justice Rehnquist did not succeed in doing so. His opinion, in fact, represents a new departure-the appli- cation of Roth's property analysis to what was previously the federal preserve of liberty. The true peculiarity of the case, even accepting this state law based approach to property interests, is its notion that a tort cause of action does not qualify as a state law interest for due process purposes. After all, the state did grant individuals the right to sue for defamation. But, in Justice Rehnquist's view, such a tort interest is somehow different from a job-essentially a contract law cause of action-although he did not really explain the distinction. One might well ask whether any common law right would qualify under this approach, since the princi- pal indication of such a right is the existence of a cause of action. Paul would thus appear to be much more restrictive than any of the right- privilege cases, all of which granted protection to common law rights. The effect is to eliminate many situations for which minimal proce- dures are required, and to shrink the scope of due process to the re- quirement that the government follow applicable rules. Paul may thus be regarded as another effort by Justice Rehnquist to effect that shrinkage, thereby achieving the long-sought goal of his Arnett opinion. The Court was back on statutory ground in the other liberty inter- est decision of 1976, Meachum v. Fano.168 Pursuant to statutory au- thority, correction officials transferred a prisoner from one state facility 167. The Roth Court addressed the issue as follows: The State, in declining to rehire the respondent, did not make any charge against him that might seriously damage his standing and associations in his community . Had it done so, this would be a different case. For "[w]here a person's good name, reputation, honor, or integrity is at stake because of what the government is doing to him, notice and an opportunity to be heard are essential." Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 573 (1972) (quoting Wisconsin v. Constantineau, 400 U.S. 433, 437 (1971)) (citations omitted). Justice Rehnquist claimed that he was following Roth, but he quoted the case's discussion of property rights, which was of course quite different from its discus- sion of liberty rights.

The real meaning of Constantineau, he insisted, was to safeguard the person's state law right to purchase or obtain liquor. Paul, 424 U.S. at 708.

The Court upheld the transfer, observing that the legislative scheme gave prison officials complete discretion to transfer prisoners without requiring any specific factual determination. Thus, the pris- oner had no state law right, no fourteenth amendment liberty interest and, as a result, no due process protection.'69 Meachum is notable for its clear refusal to give the liberty notion any independent force. The state may eliminate any liberty interest, and thus escape any minimum procedures requirement, by statutory negation or by not specifying positive criteria for decision. To be sure, the result is less controversial in relation to prison inmates-which is the way subsequent cases deal with MeachumV'0-but the language of the opinion suggests no such qualification. Meachum treated liberty just like property; both interests had to be created by a positive state law or an independent constitutional provision. This submersion of the liberty concept proved to be too much for Justice Stevens, the author of Bishop v. Wood,"'7 who replied in dissent: "I had thought it self-evi- dent that all men were endowed by their Creator with liberty as one of the cardinal unalienable rights."'72 3. Partial Retreat from Underlying Rights Bishop v. Wood, Paul v. Davis, and Meachum v. Fano represent the high water mark of the underlying rights approach to the due process clause. All three were close decisions, drawing spirited dissents,'73 and subsequent fact patterns have made their specific holdings appear un- tenable. This is not to suggest that the Court has abandoned the lib- erty-property analysis, for it has not. But it has ceased to maintain that liberty is exclusively the product of state law or independent constitu- tional provisions, as it did in Paul and Meachum; it has ceased to read statutes the way it did in Bishop; and it has certainly abandoned Paul's view that a common law right is not sufficient to constitute a fourteenth 169.

Instead, the Court has fashioned criteria that, while maintaining the underlying rights framework, provide a signifi- cantly broader scope for due process protection. The first major departure from Paul and Meachum came one Term later when the Court acknowledged that the due process clause itself gives rise to certain liberty interests. In Ingraham v. Wright,174 the Court held that the corporal punishment of school children constitutes a deprivation of liberty, and thus requires minimally adequate proce- dural protection. Justice Powell's opinion cast away the underlying rights requirement with a rousing citation of Meyer v. Nebraska,"5 Blackstone, and the Magna Carta'76--only the Almighty was absent from the list. "It is fundamental," he wrote, "that the state cannot hold and physically punish an individual except in accordance with due process of law."'77 The Court was unanimous on the point.'78 Indeed, it seems inconceivable that the Court would permit a state to establish an administrative scheme where people were restrained and beaten simply because the state legislature declared that there was no positive law right to avoid such treatment. Subsequent cases have confirmed and extended Ingraham's basic principle. In Vitek v. Jones,179 the Court reiterated that the right to personal security was inherent in the due process clause. Moreover, it found a right to avoid being stigmatized by the government in the clause,180 and gave Paul v. Davis'8j a taste of its own medicine by ig- noring it. In Hewitt v. Helms,182 Justice Rehnquist conceded that the due process clause itself creates certain liberty interests, although he declined to find that those interests include a right to parole.

Wakinekona,183 the Court explained Meachum as holding that "an intrastate prison transfer does not directly implicate the Due Process Clause."'84 Thus domesticated, the case leaves room for the conclusion that some protected liberty interests exist apart from statu- tory law and independent constitutional provisions. Another major change since the mid-1970's was the Court's more charitable interpretation of administrative statutes in areas where it continued to employ the underlying rights approach. In contrast to its analysis in Bishop, the Court became willing to read statutes that estab- lished procedures and criteria for decisions as creating liberty or prop- erty interests, holding that these procedures and criteria constituted a "legitimate claim of entitlement" within the meaning of Roth. Quite possibly, the Roth opinion used this language to refer only to claims that the state itself would recognize.185 But the Court had now con- cluded that the existence of such a legitimate claim is a federal ques- tion, to be determined by an independent reading of the statute. The central idea in the Court's approach was that a statute must specify criteria for administrative action in order to create any liberty or property rights. Without statutory criteria the administrator has complete discretion, and the individual, absent a separate liberty inter- est, has no cause for complaint. In Leis v. Flynt,'86 the Court held that an out-of-state lawyer had no property right to appear pro hac vice be- cause "the rules of the Ohio Supreme Court expressly consign the au- thority to grant a pro hac vice appearance to the discretion of the trial court."'87 Similarly, in Connecticut Board of Pardons v. Dumschat,88 the Court held that a person had no liberty interest in a state's pardon- ing process, because pardons were within the " 'unfettered discretion' " 183. 103 S.

Justice Blackmun described Vitek as applying the Meachum principle. This is true of Vitek's first rationale, which relied on state law, but not of its second rationale, which went beyond Meachum by deriving the prisoner's interest directly from the due process clause. Wakinekona does not specify the standard it is using, but categorical statements to the effect that "an inmate has no justifiable expectation that he will be incarcerated in any particular ...

Paul continued to be ignored. This emphasis on statutes, particularly statutes governing adminis- trative agencies, yielded an important result. In interpreting these stat- utes the Court naturally focused on the presence of decisionmaking criteria and conversely, on the scope of discretion that the agency had been granted. Thus, it came to grips once more with the administrative nature of the governmental action under review.'91 Questions of ad- ministrative discretion had been prominent in the loyalty-security cases, but they had been somewhat forgotten since Roth had begun the search for individual interests. The cases after Paul and Meachum rep- resented the Court's renewed awareness that it was dealing with a type of government that had emerged relatively recently, and marked the Court's renewed willingness to explore specific agency operations in the effort to define due process. Several of these post-1976 cases have granted due process protec- tion on the basis that the relevant statutory criteria for agency decision- making created a property interest. In Memphis Light, Gas &amp; Water Division v. Craft,192 for example, the Court found such an interest in the requirement that a public utility not terminate service " 'except for good and sufficient cause.' "193 In Barry v. Barchi1'94 the Justices all agreed that a property interest arose from a licensing statute that per- mitted revocation "only upon proof of certain contingencies."'5 A 189.

Zimmerman Brush Co.,196 merits particu- lar attention. Logan had filed a complaint with the Illinois Fair Em- ployment Practices Commission, pursuant to a statute that gave the Commission 120 days after the date of the complaint to convene a factfinding panel. When the Commission failed to meet its deadline, the Illinois Supreme Court held that the statute's mandatory language deprived it of jurisdiction. Thus, Logan had no remedy because the Commission had delayed. This result was obviously untenable, and the Supreme Court reversed it unanimously as a violation of due process. The Court held that Logan was deprived of a property interest because "a cause of action is a species of property protected by the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause."'97 Another line of cases, mainly in the prison administration context, found that statutory limitations on administrative discretion created protectable liberty interests. Nebraska's parole statute was held to cre- ate a liberty interest in Greenholtz v. Inmates of the Nebraska Penal and Correctional Complex,'" although the Court ultimately found that the statute allowed administrators sufficient discretion so that no proce- dures beyond those already provided were required. Similarly, in Vitek v. Jones,'99 Nebraska's statute for transferring prisoners to a mental hospital was held to require due process protection because the statute grounded transfer on a finding of mental disease or defect.200 And Hewitt v. Helms20 held that a Pennsylvania statute created a lib- erty interest for inmates in avoiding administrative segregation. The crucial factor was that certain procedures were made mandatory by the statute, so that inmates were to be segregated only on the occurrence of "specified substantive predicates."202 196. 455 U.S. 422 (1982). 197.

" Id at 430 (citing Memphis Light, Gas &amp; Water Div. v. Craft, 436 U.S. 1, 11-12 (1978)). Since that would appear to be a definition of a state law cause of action, a cause of action certainly qualifies as property. 198. 442 U.S. 1 (1979). Chief Justice Burger's opinion reached this conclusion somewhat grudgingly. After noting that the prisoners' decision to sue in federal court had precluded a state interpretation of the statute, he wrote: We can accept respondents' view that the expectancy of release provided in this statute is entitled to some measure of constitutional protection. However, we emphasize that this statute has unique structure and language and thus whether any state statute provides a protectible entitlement must be decided on a case-by-case basis. Id at 12. No other analysis was presented on the point, but the Chief Justice's immediately pre- ceding discussion of Nebraska's statutory criteria for parole, id. at 11, suggests that these criteria created the perceived expectancy. 199. 445 U.S. 480 (1980). 200.

Their rationale, however, is as unstable as that of Bishop and Arnett, and for essentially the same reason. All of them are grounded on the Court's interpretation of state statutes. As doggedly as the loyalty-security cases disclaimed any right to government benefits, these cases abjure the notion that the fourteenth amendment creates property interests or liberty interests beyond the basic categories of re- straint and stigma. Consequently, their holdings are vulnerable to more authoritative statutory constructions. If the federal courts do not happen to get the case before a state court has interpreted the relevant statute, federal inquiry into administrative discretion will be precluded.203 That is precisely what happened in Olim v. Wakinekona.24 Ad- ministrative regulations for the Hawaii prisons required a hearing prior to prisoner transfers to out-of-state institutions, with review by the prison administrator. Wakinekona was transferred out of state after a hearing that was in apparent violation of the regulations. The Court, however, held that the regulations created no liberty interest, because the prison administrator could order transfers at his sole discretion. To be sure, the regulations specified criteria for the hearing. But the hear- ing result was deemed to be a purely advisory recommendation to the prison administrator, since the administrator could affirm or reverse any recommendation, and the regulations did not specify criteria for the administrator's review. Any doubts about this somewhat odd inter- pretation were resolved by the Hawaii Supreme Court, which had in- terpreted the regulation in precisely this fashion.205 Thus, once a state court has interpreted the statute, Wakinekona brings the Court back to its Bishop approach.206 Moreover, Court review of agency discretion is also subject to leg- islative declarations that apparent statutory limits on agency discre- tion--through, say, specified decisionmaking criteria-are advisory. 203. See P. BATOR, P. MISHKIN, D. SHAPIRO, &amp; H. WECHSLER, supra note 180, at Supp. 128. A subsidiary problem is that the Court's approach puts great weight on the distinction between substantive provisions, which are within the plenary control of the state, and procedural provi- sions, which are subject to federal requirements. See, e.g., Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co., 455 U.S. 422, 432-33 (1981) (distinguishing 120-day limit on Fair Employment Practices Act claims from a grant of immunity to state officials, because "[i]t is a procedural limitation on the claim- ant's ability to assert his rights, not a substantive element of the FEPA claim"). Articulating this distinction in the due process context does not necessarily present great difficulties, but the Court has not yet made the attempt. 204. 103 S. Ct. 1741 (1983). 205. Id at 1747-48 (citing Lono v. Ariyoshi, 63 Hawaii 138, 621 P.2d 976 (1981)).

See supra notes 143-47 and accompanying text.</page><page sequence="39">1082 CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 72:1044 While the legislature could simply eliminate the criteria, such an ap- proach has its costs, most notably the loss of control over the agency, and a simple declaration may be deemed preferable. The negation of due process implications is disturbing, however, because it again allows a state the power to establish any procedures it wishes, free of constitu- tional restraint. Finally, administrative agencies themselves interpret statutes. When an agency fails to provide certain procedural rights, it can argue that it is interpreting the criteria and procedures prescribed in its stat- ute as purely advisory in nature. It is not at all obvious why the Supreme Court should not defer to such agency interpretation of state statutes. If a state court would defer, the federal courts would seem obligated to do so, since they are supposed to interpret state statutes in accordance with state law.207 Even without a state court interpretation, it would seem that the federal courts should defer to state agency inter- pretations as a matter of federal law. Where federal agencies are con- cerned, the federal doctrine of Gray v. Powell208 provides that agency interpretations will be upheld if they have a rational basis, even though the court might have reached a different interpretation on its own. There would seem to be even more persuasive arguments for deferring to state agency interpretations: the agency has the additional argument of federalism on its side, and the court lacks any general power to con- strue the statute. The Supreme Court's unwillingness to adopt this def- erential stance undoubtedly derives from a lurking sense that there are constitutional values involved. But it is difficult to locate where these values lurk if state interpretation of the statute can preclude the crea- tion of a property or liberty interest, thus rendering the due process clause inapplicable. II THE NATURE AND LIMITS OF PROCEDURAL DUE PROCESS The procedural due process cases of the post-Roth (or perhaps the post-Goldberg) era, although not impressive examples of legal reason- ing, generally represent serious efforts to deal with a complex legal is- sue: the relationship between procedural due process and the activities of an administrative state. Prior to the 1950's, the Supreme Court tended to separate the two, insulating traditional common law issues 207. See Fox Film Corp. v. Muller, 296 U.S. 207, 210-11 (1935) (Supreme Court lacks juris- diction to review state interpretation of state law); P. BATOR, P. MISHKIN, D. SHAPIRO, &amp; H.

REV. 1 (1983).</page><page sequence="40">1984] ADMINISTRATIVE DUE PROCESS 1083 from definitive determination by administrative agencies, and other- wise leaving agency rulemaking and adjudication free from due process control. The loyalty-security cases, however hesitant their tone, represent the Court's first comprehensive effort to adapt procedural due process doctrine to administrative actions. The rationale of these cases was sig- nificant but imprecise, as became apparent when courts began to apply it to the broader range of actions implicated by the welfare rights movement. In response to this imprecision, Roth and its successors have sought to limit the breadth of the due process clause's application, and ultimately have come to grapple with the crucial issue of adminis- trative discretion. This is a necessary and important issue, and the re- sults the Court has reached-while often debatable-are rarely beyond the bounds of reasonable opinion. The difficulty with these cases lies in the rationale by which the Court reached its results. They take garden-variety constitutional is- sues and, in the process of rationalizing fairly unsurprising results, cre- ate a jurisprudential Armageddon. Of course, genuine controversy exists over the results in these cases, but that controversy is much more limited in scope. Decisions about whether notice and a hearing are required before a university can refuse to renew a probationary teacher's contract, or before a prison can transfer its inmates to another prison in the state, should produce minor variations in procedural due process doctrine, not shake it to its very foundations. This Part first explores why the Roth approach turned out to be so much more controversial and ambiguous than its purpose would sug- gest. It then advances an alternative rationale, based on more estab- lished due process concepts, that avoids the difficulties Roth created. Finally, it responds to Roth's true concern, namely the potential sweep of Goldberg's extension of due process into the administrative realm. It proposes an alternative limit, based on general administrative law con- cepts, that achieves a similar result within the framework of the due process tradition, and that does so without traversing the conceptual wilderness through which Roth and its progeny have wandered. A. Beyond the Roth Analysis 1. Beyond Liberty and Property It is perhaps useful to begin this discussion with a definition of procedural due process. The ultimate definition, of course, is what all of the cases and commentaries are striving for; but the concept must have some agreed-upon core, however debatable its boundaries and operation. Presumably, that core is the notion of "procedure," which is</page><page sequence="41">1084 CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 72:104, generally viewed as referring to governmental methods of adjudica- tion.209 To say that procedural due process is required, therefore, means that some set of standards must be imposed on those adjudica- tory methods. Binding legal rules that do not involve adjudication methods are generally referred to as substantive law;210 in fact, the term probably means little more than "nonprocedural." Standards imposed on such legal rules by the due process clause are therefore known as substantive due process.21' Because the term "due process" has been used for both purposes-and because it has such vague and awesome general conno- tations-it may be helpful to restate the procedural due process right as a right to fair procedures in government adjudications.212 The Roth opinion's starting point is that "[t]he requirements of procedural due process apply only to the deprivation of interests en- compassed by the Fourteenth Amendment's protection of liberty and property."213 This statement actually contains two distinct premises, each of which was relatively new with Roth: first, that some type of individual interest must be present before the due process clause is ap- plicable; and second, that this interest can be described by the terms "liberty" and "property." The opinion treats both premises as self-evident, but they are in fact problematic. First, there is a basic ambiguity in the way the terms "liberty" and "property" are used in the Roth opinion: their genera- lized invocation, without more, could have at least two entirely differ- ent meanings. The terms could refer to a federally defined standard, which would mean that federal courts will apply the clause only to those interests they themselves regard as liberty or property. Alterna- 209. See Hanna v. Plumer, 380 U.S. 460, 464 (1965); Sibbach v. Wilson &amp; Co., 312 U.S. 1, 14 (1940) (procedure consists of "the judicial process for enforcing rights and duties recognized by substantive law and for justly administering remedy and redress for disregard or infraction of them"); Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, 326 U.S. 99, 109 (1945) (procedure is "the manner and the means by which a right to recover . . is enforced"). 210. See, e.g., Hanna v. Plumer, 380 U.S. 460, 475 (1965) (Harlan, J., concurring) (substantive law includes "primary decisions respecting human conduct"); Mississippi Publishing Corp. v. Murphree, 326 U.S. 438, 446 (1946). 211. "Substantive due process" is a highly charged term, often leveled at one's opponents as the ultimate condemnation of their views. See, e.g., Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 174 (1973) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting); Epstein, Substantive Due Process by Any Other Name. The Abortion Cases, 1973 SUP. CT. REV. 159. It thus has a tendency to expand beyond its original constitutional contours to cover a multitude of legal sins. Most notably, it sometimes refers to the use of nontex- tual standards, even by the proponents of such standards, see L. TRIBE, supra note 4, at 525-26; Tushnet, supra note 4, at 279; Van Alstyne, Cracks in "The New Property" Adjudicative Due Process in the Administrative State, 62 CORNELL L. REV. 445, 487 (1977). For the distinction be- tween procedural and substantive due process, see infra text accompanying notes 485-87. 212. The term "fair" here has no greater content than the term "due." It is simply more neutral, permitting attention to be directed to the fact that adjudicatory methods are at issue. 213. Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 569 (1972).</page><page sequence="42">1984] ADMINISTRA TIVE DUE PROCESS 1085 tively, the terms could refer to a state-defined standard, which would mean that federal courts will apply the clause only to those interests that state courts recognize as within these concepts.214 One might expect that this ambiguity would have been resolved when the Roth opinion discussed the general meaning of liberty and property, and applied both of these concepts to Roth's claim. With respect to liberty, it was. Justice Stewart unquestionably referred to a federal standard in his discussion of stigma and opportunity.215 With respect to property, however, the ambiguity was carefully preserved. The crucial sentences read: "Property interests, of course, are not cre- ated by the Constitution. Rather, they are created and their dimen- sions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law . . . ."26 Again, this fails to specify whether the term "property" refers to a federal standard that serves to characterize state law, or to a state standard that derives its content from state law.217 Given the contrasting treatment of liberty, however, it seems likely that a state-law standard was intended.218 If the Court was relying on the state-standard approach, it must 214. Both of these views are theoretically, if not functionally, distinct from the view, adopted in Justice Rehnquist's Arnett v. Kennedy opinion, that the state has control over the nature of the procedures as well as the nature of the interest. See discussion supra in notes 135-41 and accom- panying text. 215. See supra text accompanying note 149. 216. Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 577 (1972). Perhaps the statement that an indi- vidual must have "a legitimate claim of entitlement" for a property interest to exist, id., was in- tended to establish a federal standard, see Simon, supra note 5, at 182-84. But this phrase is just as ambiguous as the sentence it is supposedly explaining, since it does not say whether state or fed- eral law establishes the legitimacy of the entitlement. As Professor Tribe notes, any effort to ground the concept on the justifiable expectations of the individual is inevitably circular, see L. TRIBE, supra note 4, at 525-26, since the justifiability of the expectation depends on the applicable law. 217. Roth's companion case, Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593 (1972), is equally unhelpful. There, the Court held that Sindermann, also a college professor, could not be dismissed without a hearing if he could prove his allegation that his university had a de facto tenure system under which he qualified. But the opinion was perfectly ambiguous about whether the de facto tenure qualified as property because the state would recognize it as such, or because it was being so interpreted by the Supreme Court. One crucial sentence reads: "A person's interest in a benefit is a 'property' interest for due process purposes if there are such rules or mutually explicit under- standings that support his claim of entitlement to the benefit and that he may invoke at a hearing." Id at 601. This formulation might have helped had the Court specified the type of hearing to which it was referring. If the hearing was in state court under state law, then the state standard was intended. If it was in federal court under the due process clause (or in state court under the federal due process clause, for that matter), then the federal standard was necessarily intended. Unfortunately, the opinion provides no further clue. 218. Whatever Justice Stewart intended, subsequent cases have read Roths seminal language both ways. The cases of the mid-1970's, most notably Paul v. Davis, Meachum v. Fano, and Bishop v. Wood, adopt the state-standard approach. See supra notes 143-72 and accompanying text. More recent cases, such as Vitek v. Jones, Greenholtz v. Inmates of the Nebraska Penal &amp; Correc- tional Complex, and Memphis Light, Gas &amp; Water Division v. Craft, adopt the federal-standard approach. See supra notes 179-202 and accompanying text.</page><page sequence="43">1086 CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 72:1044 have concluded that state law contains definitions of liberty and prop- erty. The most obvious place to look for such definitions is the com- mon law. But common law does not define liberty and property in any useful way. Instead, the decisions define legal causes of action. Once a cause of action has been established, the liberty or property label at- taches automatically, to the extent that such labels are employed at all.219 Nor can it be asserted that concepts of liberty or property serve as the origin of common law causes of action. The common law is a far more complex system than that, deriving its provisions from social pol- icy, tradition, and elaborated analogies.220 Moreover, whatever limited control the terms "liberty" and "prop- erty" exerted over legal issues has been largely eliminated by the de- cline of legal formalism. The legal realist movement rejected such doctrinal formulas in favor of social policy analysis,221 while those who defend the integrity of the doctrine regard it as composed of principles that go well beyond mere terminology.222 Thus, it is now common- place to acknowledge that property is simply a label for whatever "bundle of sticks" the individual has been granted.223 219. To cite just one example, common law courts had to decide whether the real owner of a stolen note (payable to bearer) should be the maker of the note or a good faith purchaser. This would seem to be a classic case in which the conceptual framework of property rights would be invoked. But the leading decision, Miller v. Race, 1 Burr. 452, 97 Eng. Rep. 398 (1758), makes no reference to property rights. Instead, the author of the opinion, Lord Mansfield, argues by anal- ogy to goods and cash, and invokes considerations of trade custom and social policy. This ap- proach was typical. See generally Gilmore, The Commercial Doctrine of Good Faith Purchase, 63 YALE L.J. 1057 (1954). 220. There are some situations in which common law courts use the terms liberty or property as a conceptual device for deciding legal issues. For example, when English courts granted buyers who had paid for undelivered goods the right to replevy those goods, they characterized this right by saying that title, the property right in the goods, had passed to the buyer. See C. BLACKBURN, A TREATISE ON THE EFFECT OF THE CONTRACT OF SALE 188-89 (1845); W.S. HOLDSWORTH, A HISTORY OF ENGLISH LAW 355-56 (3d ed. 1923); 2 F. POLLOCK &amp; F. MAITLAND, THE HISTORY OF ENGLISH LAW 210 (2d ed. 1898); Llewellyn, Through Title to Contract anda Bit Beyond, 15 N.Y.U. L.Q. 159, 182-83 (1938). It was subsequently decided that the risk of loss also passed to the buyer in this situation since the goods were the buyer's property. Tarling v. Baxter, 6 B&amp;C 360, 108 Eng. Rep. 484 (K.B. 1827). This rule was followed by Williston in drafting the UNIF. SALES ACT ? 22 (superseded generally by the Uniform Commercial Code in 1962); see also Lott v. Delmar, 2 N.J. 229, 232, 66 A.2d 25, 26 (1949); Skinner v. James Griffiths &amp; Sons, 80 Wash. 291, 141 P. 693 (1914). Apparently, use of the term "property" did determine the risk of loss issue. But the basic right in question, the right to replevy, was not derived from the concept of property; rather, it created "property" rights, and was apparently articulated to effectuate a social policy derived from other sources. 221. See, e.g., Cohen, Property and Sovereignty, 13 CORNELL L.Q. 8 (1927); Llewellyn, supra note 220; Pound, Mechanical Jurisprudence, 8 COLUM. L. REV. 605 (1908). 222. See, e.g., R.

Because such statutes create new types of legal relationships, even current common law concepts are often inapplicable, to say nothing of archaic ones. Consequently, the Court's efforts to characterize the rights created by these statutes as liberty or property have been notably strained. For example, in Vitek v. Jones,224 the Court described a pris- oner's statutory right to avoid transfer to a mental hospital as a liberty interest.225 That such a right was granted is perhaps significant, but it is difficult to perceive its connection with the common law concept of liberty. Similarly, in Goss v. Lopez,226 the Court treated a child's right to a free public education as a property interest.227 There is something ex- tremely unhelpful about such a description, however, since the right in question has few of the indicia that real or personal property possess at common law. It is not alienable, devisable, or descendible, and cannot be altered by the owner, or saved for later use. Indeed, Justice White, writing for the Court, seemed aware that the property designation was meaningless. The central statement in his property interest analysis was: "Having chosen to extend the right to an education to people of relations between persons exist and sometimes to denote the legal relations. The former of these two usages. . . does not occur in this Restatement. . . . The word "property" is used in this Restatement to denote legal relations between persons with respect to a thing. Common law courts have become quite comfortable with this discourse, as have statutory drafters. When the rules for replevying paid-for goods and for passing risk of loss were codified in the Uniform Commercial Code, for example, Karl Llewellyn, the principal draftsman and a lead- ing legal realist, simply eliminated the concept of title. U.C.C. ?? 2-401, -509 (1977); cf. id ? 9-202 (title eliminated as operative concept in secured transactions). See generally Corbin, The Uniform Commercial Code-Sales,; Should It Be Enacted? 59 YALE L.J. 821, 824-27 (1950). This enabled the Code to separate the two issues, retaining the buyer's right to replevy after seller's bankruptcy for one set of social policy reasons, U.C.C. ?? 2-501, -502 (1977), but eliminating the buyer's risk of loss before delivery for a different set of policy reasons, id ? 2-509. Interestingly, Justice Stewart made a legal error in Fuentes v. Shevin, 407 U.S. 67 (1972), when he pointed out that the buyers lacked title to the goods. Id at 84, 86.

Perhaps the most convoluted opinion of all is Logan v. Zimmer- man Brush Co.,229 where the plaintiff was deprived of a state-created cause of action by the challenged administrative rules. True to Roth, the Court held that a state law cause of action is a property interest, thus rendering due process protection applicable.230 In reality, all the Court needed to say was that the existence of a state law cause of action satisfied the individual interest requirement it perceived in the due pro- cess clause. To hold that the cause of action is a property right and that the property right then triggers the protection adds nothing useful to the analysis, since it is the cause of action that creates the property right in the first place.231 Even the state-law standard requires nothing more than the assertion that a federal cause of action under the due process clause exists only if there is an underlying state law cause of action. Liberty and property are simply not useful concepts in this context.232 228. Id at 574 (citation omitted). 229. 455 U.S. 422 (1982). 230. Id at 428-33. 231. There are common law cases declaring that a cause of action is property or its equivalent, but their reasoning proceeds in precisely the opposite direction. These cases hold that this right is the equivalent of tangible property in certain transactions between private parties. See, e.g., Union Collection Co. v. Buckman, 150 Cal. 159, 163-64, 88 P. 708, 710 (1907) (promise not to sue is sufficient consideration to support contract); Palmer v. Dehn, 29 Tenn.

JAEGER, WILLISTON ON CONTRACTS ? 135B, at 573-86 (3d ed. 1957). In other words, common law uses the existence of a right to trial procedures as an indication that a property-type right exists, as opposed to the Supreme Court's approach of using the property concept to determine whether there is a right to trial procedures. 232. In his dissent in Vail v. Board of Educ., 706 F.2d 1435 (7th Cir. 1983), affd by an equally divided Court, 104 S. Ct. 2144 (1984), Judge Posner may have succeeded in outdoing Logan. A school athletic director's two-year employment contract is not property, he argued, because the common law distinguished contract rights from property rights, and the framers, following this distinction, intended to protect only the latter. The difficulty, of course, is to determine what a property right is, particularly in this rarefied form. Judge Posner suggested that "[w]e infer the existence of a property right from the remedies the law gives to protect it. A right protected by an injunction, by specific performance or by criminal penalties is a property right." Id at 1453 (Posner, J., dissenting). This is plainly incorrect as a description of existing law. To take just one example, an employer can get a negative injunction against a breaching employee under certain circumstances, see, e.g., Lumley v. Wagner, 42 Eng. Rep. 687 (1852), but we might hesitate to say that it has a property interest in the other. If Judge Posner nonetheless wants to limit due process protection in the administrative context to cases where state law would grant equitable relief, why not simply base the due process requirement on the available remedy, instead of inferring the existence of property from the remedy and then holding that this property satisfies the due process requirement? Again, the term "property" is unnecessary, and it turns out to be so vacuous that it simply disappears from the analysis.</page><page sequence="46">1984] ADMINISTRA TIVE DUE PROCESS 1089 It is possible, however, that Roth was referring to a federal stan- dard for the underlying interest, and it is clear that a number of more recent procedural due process cases do so. That would seem to restore meaning to the terms liberty and property; even if state law creates only causes of action, federal law might employ the two terms to determine whether such causes of action merit due process protection. The diffi- culty here is determining the source of the federal definitions of those terms. They cannot really come from an analogy to common law, since common law, as previously indicated, does not provide adequate defi- nitions of the terms. Nor can they be derived from other provisions of the Constitution. Outside of the due process clauses themselves, the terms "liberty" and "property" do not appear anywhere else in the Constitution, except for the reference to liberty in the preamble,233 to the property of the United States in article IV,234 and to private prop- erty in the closely related and equally mysterious just compensation clause.235 There appear to be two remaining sources from which federal standards for liberty and property could be derived. The first is general jurisprudence, a realm in which these terms enjoy a primacy they lack in the workaday world of common law. The second is the due process clause itself. Perhaps Justice Stewart had some jurisprudential notion in mind when he conceded in Roth that "'[l1]iberty' and 'property' are broad and majestic terms."236 The difficulty is that their jurispruden- tial meaning is substantially too broad and majestic. By simply invok- ing these terms, the Court was plunging itself into a prodigious, age-old 233. U.S. CONST. preamble (Constitution established to "secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity"). It would require great daring to derive any specific meaning from this phrase. 234. Id art. IV, ? 3, cl. 2 (Congress shall have power to make rules "respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States"). To the extent that this conveys any specific information, it is obviously tied to a context quite different from the property rights of an individ- ual. For example, United States property that is within the boundaries of individual states may not be taxed by those states, Van Brocklin v. Tennessee, 117 U.S. 151 (1886), an attribute which unfortunately does not apply to the property of individuals. One recent property clause case, Kleppe v. New Mexico, 426 U.S. 529 (1976), is worth noting, however. In Kleppe, the Court unanimously held that the clause grants Congress the power to protect the wild horse population on federal land. Justice Marshall, writing for the Court, reached the conclusion by analyzing the nature of the government's role with respect to these lands. Id at 539-41; see also infra text accom- panying notes 465-73 (proper governmental role central consideration for due process analysis). There is no suggestion in the opinion that the case turns on whether wild horses are "property." 235. U.S. CONST. amend.

From a purely strategic viewpoint, this seems like an unpromising way to determine whether a probationary college teacher is entitled to a nonrenewal hearing. Even if the Court felt that there was some necessity to wander into the jurisprudential realm, it is unclear where the path would lead. The one major philosopher who could be regarded as central to our consti- tutional tradition is John Locke.237 Locke has much to say about the structure of our government, but, as Professor Mashaw points out, his general theory of private property sheds little light on the issue of pro- cedural due process.238 The Second Treatise of Government does con- tain a definition of property rights, which Locke regarded as resulting from the individual's labor.239 How one would apply this definition to a government job or benefit is a fascinating question. It would appear that Locke's definition directly contradicts the Court's reasonable ex- pectations test, since expectations would receive little protection under a labor-value regime. In any event, the Court has not invoked Locke to support its theory of property. 237. See M. WHITE, THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION 4-8, 61-69, 213-21 (1978); G. WOOD, THE CREATION OF THE AMERICAN REPUBLIC 1776-1787, at 282-91 (1969). White also emphasizes the influence of Burlamaqui, who followed Locke's general approach. M. WHITE, supra, at 36-41. 238. Mashaw, supra note 4, at 908-09. Precisely what implications Locke derived from the nature and distribution of property is a matter of some uncertainty. See J. GOUGH, JOHN LOCKE'S POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY 80-103 (2d ed. 1973); C. MACPHERSON, THE POLITICAL THEORY OF POS- SESSIVE INDIVIDUALISM: HOBBES TO LOCKE 197-220 (1962); M. WHITE, supra note 237, at 53-60. In any event, it seems clear that Locke treated the property right as a limit on the general lawmak- ing power of the government. J. LOCKE, THE SECOND TREATISE OF GOVERNMENT ?? 138-140 (1690). That view translates into the modem doctrine of substantive due process. Locke tells us why the state may take a portion of the property of all its members, see id. ? 139 (regulation), and ? 140 (taxation), but says nothing about the manner in which it may take a particular person's property. He does, however, derive a requirement that the state act generally from natural-rights considerations, and this is of procedural significance. See infra note 341. 239. See J. LOCKE, supra note 238, ?? 28-33. Locke's notion that one obtains property rights in a previously unowned good by virtue of one's labor, if taken at face value, might suggest the right-privilege distinction, with a further distinction between privileges that have been used to build businesses or reputations and those that have not. See supra text accompanying notes 40-42. But the nation's largest social welfare program, Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), is designed to assist parents in bringing up their children, see 42 U.S.C. ?? 601-615 (1982), a task which they must perform in order to remain eligible. In contrast, licenses to operate a business might go to an owner of capital, who then contributes no labor of his or her own. The reason government jobs pose a particularly difficult problem for this analysis is that the employee, absent the most egregious cause for dismissal, always adds his or her own labor. Professor Macpherson argues that Locke regarded his theory of labor as relevant only prior to the introduc- tion of money, the development of a market economy, and the consequent alienability of goods and labor. C. MACPHERSON, supra note 238, at 203-20. But government benefits are not really part of the market economy since they cannot be traded. Thus, Locke's translation of his labor theory of property into a market theory (in Macpherson's view) would not work in this context, and the problem of applying his concept of property to administrative situations would remain.</page><page sequence="48">1984] ADMINISTRATIVE DUE PROCESS 1091 One could speculate at length about the assistance that other phi- losophers could provide in defining liberty or property. Rousseau of- fers a definition of property,240 as does Proudhon.241 Mill discusses liberty at length,242 as do Hobbes,243 Nietschze,244 and dozens of other major philosophers. But there is nothing to suggest that any of these thinkers, even Mill, can be looked to as authoritative in any general sense. Their relationship to the Constitution is necessarily based on argument, not external evidence. Moreover, those arguments necessar- ily relate to the due process clause alone, since the claim that the entire Constitution can be interpreted through any one philosophy is too im- plausible to be sustained. Thus, the effort to invoke any particular philosophic system in defining liberty and property inevitably leads to the same problem of imposing the entire debate regarding man, mean- ing, and the state on due process doctrine. It leads, moreover, to the approach that the Court has apparently been trying to avoid; namely, that the due process clause itself creates certain liberty or property in- terests. For if there is no generally accepted system of constitutional jurisprudence to provide the necessary definitions, their source can only be the fourteenth amendment's "cryptic and abstract"245 language. With respect to property, the Court has refused to articulate any constitutionally based standards apart from the notion that property is not created by the Constitution. That is the reason the Court's effort to establish federally required procedures in property cases keeps collaps- ing back into the procedural nihilism of Justice Rehnquist's opinion in Arnett v. Kennedy.246 As Bishop v. Wood247 made clear, federal re- quirements could be negated if state law were interpreted to have cre- ated no property rights. Subsequent cases, such as Memphis Light, Gas &amp; Water Division v. Craft,248 attempted to reestablish the due process clause's independence from state law by developing a federal approach to state statutory interpretation, one that identified certain provisions as creating a legitimate claim of entitlement. Olim v. Wakinekona249 sug- gests, however, that this approach can be vitiated by a previous state interpretation, whether legislative or judicial. Thus, as long as the 240. J.

With respect to liberty, the Court has articulated an independently derived definition. It has held that state actions-administrative ac- tions in particular-that invade personal security or impose a stigma implicate the liberty interest. This approach, which originated with Board of Regents v. Roth 250 and Morrissey v. Brewer,25 avoids the col- lapse of procedural protection in those circumstances where it is used, but it raises the same question as the Court's circuitous treatment of state law causes of action. If the Court has decided to create a right to avoid certain types of stigma or restraint, what value is served by char- acterizing these rights as liberty? The term is nothing more than a label for rights that the Court has decided to recognize and protect, useful only if it has some independent force. It is, moreover, a confusing la- bel, for it has been used in due process doctrine to explain a multitude of sins, most notably the doctrine of substantive due process. Roth's identification of specific factors is preferable to reliance on the general term liberty precisely because it excludes some of the "liberties" that have previously been found in the fourteenth amendment.252 2. Beyond Textual Literalism In short, the second premise of the Roth decision seems difficult to maintain. The terms "liberty" and "property" simply fail to define the individual interest that triggers due process protection. There is, how- ever, an argument for the use of the terms "liberty" and "property" that is independent of their usefulness: the argument that the text of the due process clause includes them. And as Justice Stewart said in Roth, per- haps inadvertently, "the words 'liberty' and 'property' in the Due Pro- cess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment must be given some meaning.'253 One may well concede that every constitutional phrase must be 250. 408 U.S. 564 (1972). 251. 408 U.S. 471 (1972). 252. See Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 572-75 (1972). Using the term liberty for the concept of stigma partially vitiates this advantage. The primary link between stigma and liberty is that stigma affects one's employment opportunities. But the recognition of a general right to employment opportunity, particularly when characterized as "liberty," leads directly to the liberty of contract notion. See Shapiro, The Constitution and Economic Rights, in ESSAYS ON THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES 74 (M. Harmon ed. 1978). 253. Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 572 (1972) (emphasis added). Professor Monaghan reads this sentence as indicating that Justice Stewart was adopting a federal standard for property.

But it is not clear why the meaning Justice Stewart referred to could not have been based on state law.</page><page sequence="50">1984] ADMINISTRATIVE DUE PROCESS 1093 given some meaning, if only in the interest of maintaining the legiti- macy of the judicial enterprise. A further argument for treating the Constitution's language as the determinative factor is based on one the- ory of judicial review, sometimes referred to as interpretivism.254 Its underlying rationale is that modern courts should implement the intent of the Framers, as revealed in the constitutional text or other sources. Even if one accepts the theory-and it is a source of serious contro- versy255-it hardly compels reliance on the literal words of a provision like the due process clause. The clause was enacted twice, each time with little, if any, discussion or debate.256 While this does not necessar- ily suggest that the Framers were unaware of its meaning, it should caution against overinterpretation of the specific language. One might look to the general understanding of the guarantee at the time of its enactment, although even that is a matter of uncertainty. In all likeli- hood, the major external referent was chapter 39 of the Magna Carta, which would suggest that the emphasis was on the concept of due pro- cess, not on liberty or property.257 As soon as one moves away from a strict interpretivist approach, a literal reading of the terms liberty and property becomes decidedly un- tenable. There have been at least two major changes since 1791 or 1868 that preclude any direct translation of prior liberty and property ideas into modern legal doctrine. The first is the jurisprudential change in the concept of rights; the second is the historical change in the nature of government. When the framers used the terms "liberty" or "property," they 254.

HOWARD, supra note 15, at 388 (translation of the Magna Carta). The concern here seems to be on the nature of the state's adverse action, not the interest of the individual. The use of the words "life, liberty, or property" in the due process clause, which do not appear in the Magna Carta, may well owe its origin to Locke's natural rights philosophy, see id. at 17 n. 16, but this would hardly aid the Court's approach, see supra text accompanying notes 237-39. In any event, the evidence suggests that the dominant influence on the clause was the Magna Carta. This seems reasonable because chapter 39 of the Magna Carta describes a right closely related to our concept of procedural due process (the accepted core of the due process clause), while Locke has nothing to say about procedure.</page><page sequence="51">1094 CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 72:1044 probably had in mind some definitive set of interests fixed by natural law.258 But modem courts and modem jurisprudence, as suggested above, tend to treat these terms as legal conclusions, rather than as in- dependent arguments. As a result, their literal use now results in the abolition of fixed restraints, and gives the states extensive power to con- trol the scope of due process protection. A natural rights approach would do exactly the reverse; it would suggest a rather vigorous federal standard that places absolute limits on state power. Of course, we have lost faith in the existence of such natural-law rights, probably as a re- sult of the substantive due process doctrine, but we cannot conclude that this change in attitude about liberty and property requires an equivalent change in our attitudes about due process. That syllogism would hold only if the primary concern of the clause were liberty and property, rather than fair procedures. Beginning from the notion that the clause guarantees fair proce- dures, the logical approach would be to interpret the terms liberty and property by seeking some concept that fulfills the same function now as liberty and property did previously. Presumably, that concept would be the dominant view about the proper type of interaction between government and individuals. Those views, which are in some sense "natural" to this society, represent society's general sense of the fixed limits on state power. Second, adoption of the fifth and fourteenth amendments pre- ceded the development of the administrative state.259 When these amendments were drafted, adjudications by states-to which due pro- cess clearly applied-were carried out almost exclusively by courts. The words "life, liberty, or property" were sufficient to include the en- tire range of issues that courts adjudicated; their effect, therefore, was to describe, not to exclude. Today, most adjudications are carried out by administrative agen- cies rather than courts. And these agencies perform many functions that courts did not and probably could not fulfill, most notably the dis- 258. See M. WHITE, supra note 237, at 213-28; R. MOTT, supra note 1, at 149, 159-61; G. WOOD, supra note 237, at 282-91. 259. The Interstate Commerce Commission, generally regarded as the first modem adminis- trative agency, was created in 1887. Interstate Commerce Act of 1887, ch. 104, 24 Stat. 379 (1887) (codified at 49 U.S.C. ?? 1-11917 (1982)). The executive branch had carried out administrative functions before this time, and separate organizations, such as the Patent Office and the Comptrol- ler of the Currency, existed to carry out specific functions. For the pre-1887 history of administra- tive law in the United States, see generally J. DICKINSON, supra note 33; E. FREUND, ADMINISTRATIVE POWERS OVER PERSONS AND PROPERTY (1928); L. JAFFE, supra note 191. What is significant for present purposes, however, is that the concept of administrative law as a separate area of legal doctrine did not take shape until at least the late 19th century. See Frankfurter, The Task of Administrative Law, 75 U. PA. L. REV. 614 (1927).</page><page sequence="52">1984] ADMINISTRATIVE DUE PROCESS 1095 tribution of benefits.260 A literal reading of the terms "liberty" and "property" in this modern context excludes many administrative adju- dications from the scope of due process protection. Again, this makes sense only if some independent significance attaches to the fact that these adjudications involve issues that are not readily described in terms of traditional common law interests. If one focuses instead on the concept of procedural fairness, the fact is that due process originally applied to all government adjudications; the only adjudications were court decisions about "life, liberty, or property," as those terms were understood at the time. Consequently, a strong argument can be made to preserve that inclusive effect. Instead of reading "life, liberty, or property" as referring to a particular group of interests, it could be read as referring to the entire, now-expanded range of government adjudications.261 In fact, the combined effect of modern jurisprudence and the ad- ministrative state is so apparent that those commentators who want to read the phrase as specifying a limited set of interests have found it necessary to refer back to preexisting legal standards. Professor Williams recommends reliance on the scope of liberty or property in- terests as they were understood in 1925.262 That solves the problem posed by modern jurisprudence, but it still leaves the difficulties engen- dered by the advent of administrative agencies. As previously noted, the right-privilege distinction was already showing strain by 1925, be- cause it did not produce acceptable results where regulatory programs such as licensing or deportation were involved.263 Professor Easter- brook suggests we go back even further, to the scope of interest that existed in 1791 or 1868.264 That solves the problem of the administra- 260. The major limitation on courts is the case or controversy requirement of article III. See Muskrat v. United States, 219 U.S. 346 (1911); Hayburn's Case, 2 U.S. (2 Dall.) 408 (1792). See generally P.

See Williams, supra note 5, at 21 (referring to "classical liberty or property").

Even so, this use of an extinct legal standard proba- bly underestimates the tendency of a common law court in any era to look beyond liberty and property language to underlying policy when it created causes of action.265 But the real issue is one of values. Should the inevitably ambigu- ous language of the constitutional text be read to represent a fixed set of protections, whose content remains constant even when the surround- ing society changes? Or should it be read to create an open-ended prin- ciple, capable of expanding so that its relative scope remains constant as those changes occur? If one adopts the former view, one will read "life, liberty, or property" as words of limitation: that no interest should be granted constitutional protection unless the framers would have regarded it as falling within those terms. If one adopts the latter view, however, the same phrase becomes one of inclusion: that as large a proportion of government actions should be granted protection as was granted protection at the time the due process clause was enacted. The text of the due process clause itself does not inform us which interpretation is correct. It does not compel a particular definition of "liberty" or "property." Rather, it simply poses the issue for us, leav- ing us free to make the type of choices that all moral action requires. 3. Beyond the Underlying Rights Standard The unpersuasive nature of Roth's second premise-that "liberty" and "property" define a meaningful set of individual interests-natu- rally casts some doubt on its first premise-that the notion of an indi- vidual interest limits the applicability of the due process clause. Some minimal level of individual interest is required to confer standing on the plaintiff, of course, at least in a federal action. Article III as pres- ently interpreted prohibits federal courts from deciding a case unless a definable interest of the moving party is at stake.266 But in declaring that an individual interest is necessary for due process purposes, Roth woman."). The general view is that the Constitution changed at least this aspect of the English law. See Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137 (1803). It hardly seems reasonable to treat the due process clause differently from other clauses, such as free speech or free exercise, simply because it happened to have a direct English forebear. In any event, whatever the fifth amend- ment may have meant at the time, it is inconceivable that the framers of the 14th amendment wanted to exempt the legislatures of the southern states from its control.

Instead, the Court must have been saying that once a plaintiff has standing, some additional interest must be identified, some underlying right that will support the imposition of due process requirements. But why is this so? If one cannot rely on liberty and property to give content to the underlying rights concept, its link to the constitu- tional text disappears. So does its potential for restricting the open- ended character of due process decisions by means of the certainty of its limiting effect. Of course, it might be possible to identify some other underlying rights, and thus reinfuse this notion with preclusive force. But it seems like a large expenditure of effort to reconstruct an abstract principle without its main support. Nonetheless, the effort has been made. Dean Ely suggests that the individual interest or underlying rights notion should be reinterpreted to include any significant injury suffered by the individual.267 How- ever, since that virtually restates the standing requirement, its real ef- fect is to drain "underlying rights" of any content or significance. Ely virtually concedes this; the major question is why he felt the need to cast the argument in terms of underlying rights in the first place. Pro- fessor Van Alstyne makes a similar effort, although his solution leads in a somewhat different direction. He proposes that we treat "freedom from arbitrary adjudicative procedures as a substantive element of one's liberty."268 The idea of freedom from arbitrary action seems promising, but it is circuitous to relate that idea to the introductory phrase about life, liberty, or property. One would ordinarily think of the idea as a description, or at least a paraphrase, of the term "due process"-that is, of the essence of the clause's guarantee. Van Alstyne rejects this more direct approach, however. In his view, it is tanta- mount to rephrasing the clause to provide that citizens shall not be de- prived of "life, liberty, or property, or of due process of law, without due process of law."269 That argument, however, reflects the skewing effect of the underlying rights notion. It implies that some underlying right must be found, and that any standard of due process must be stated in terms of such a right. The more logical rewording of the clause to reflect Professor Van Alstyne's view is that government may not take certain types of actions--described as deprivations of life, lib- erty, or property-in an arbitrary manner, with arbitrary defined as the lack of due process protection. Another effort to locate underlying rights apart from liberty and property is derived from the dignitary theory of due process. This the- 267. See J. ELY, supra note 255, at 18-19. 268.

When Professor Kadish articulated this idea in the 1950's, he saw it as a basis for determining the content of due pro- cess itself.270 While various scholars have continued to advance this approach,27' the theory has also been enlisted as another interest of the individual that can be used to expand the scope of procedural protec- tion beyond the Court's liberty and property analysis.272 In reality, this latter notion is simply another product of the gen- eral obsession with underlying rights. In its pure form, the dignitary theory deals with the purpose and significance of procedural protection itself. To translate it into the idea that there exists an individual inter- est in "dignity" is to separate it from its due process moorings and re- duce it to a psychological observation of questionable validity. Some of our society's most "dignified" members, such as corporate presidents or cabinet secretaries, are entitled to no procedural protection; con- versely, the dreary realities of local court procedurea are often a contin- uing affront to the dignity of those involved in them.273 In fact, the dignitary theory has very little to do with the notion of the individual's interest in "dignity." Properly conceived, it is a theory about the stance that government should take toward the people it rules. The problem with the underlying rights standard, however, goes beyond the difficulty of defining it. There is an archaic quality about the whole idea; its implicit assumptions belong, at the most basic level, to a style of legal thinking that has been largely abandoned. The es- sence of the procedural due process enterprise, after all, is to identify those procedural protections to which individuals have a constitutional right. The insistence on finding an underlying right springs from the idea that such protections must be attached to some substantive inter- est. But this seems compelling only if one starts from the assumption that all rights are contained within the individual. That assumption 270.

If one starts instead from the assumption that rights usually repre- sent relationships between human beings, or between human beings and government, the need to find underlying rights within individuals simply dissolves. It is perfectly sensible to place limits on the govern- ment's behavior toward individuals, quite apart from any independent rights those individuals may possess. We may want to say, for exam- ple, that the government may not operate segregated golf courses or coffee shops,274 even though we recognize no independent right to pub- lic facilities of this nature. Similarly, we may want to say that the gov- ernment must provide notice and a hearing before it takes certain types of actions, regardless of the existence or nonexistence of an independ- ent right. We might even want the government to provide notice and a hearing before it takes any action at all. That may not be required by our common understanding of due process and it may not be advisable, but there is nothing illogical or incomprehensible about it. The notion that rights must be contained within the individual has no modern jurisprudential basis. At best, it is a restatement of the for- malist view that people have certain natural-law rights independent of the social order. It may be related to the view that Professor Macpher- son has labeled "possessive individualism"-the seventeenth-century notion that the individual should be regarded "neither as moral whole, nor as part of a larger social whole, but as an owner of himself."275 But the realist tradition, the methodology of which has been described by Professor Summers as our "dominant general theory about law," defin- itively rejects any notion of inherent rights.276 Like positivism gener- ally,277 it treats rights as products of the social order, that is, of 274. See, e.g., Burton v. Wilmington Parking Auth., 365 U.S. 715 (1961); Holmes v. City of Atlanta, 350 U.S. 879 (1955). 275. C. MACPHERSON, supra note 238, at 3. Even according to this approach, it is not incon- ceivable that purely procedural rights would exist. Although all rights would ultimately derive from self-contained individuals, social interaction might generate procedural protections under the right circumstances. In any case, and whether or not Professor Macpherson's interpretation is correct, his view seems similar to the Court's unstated assumptions. 276.

Professor Summers' characterization applies to realist methodology, rather than the realist program in its entirety. For the realists' rejection of inherent rights, see, e.g., J.

While the Court's use of the state standard is often described as "positivist," positivism does not yield the proposition that the due process clause creates only subsidiary rights and not independent ones.

Indeed, Professors Fuller, Rawls, and Fried, three of the leading proponents of the "rights" approach, all derive their catalogue of substantive rights from general notions about the manner in which people should be treated.280 All three recognize some purely procedural rights, typically in the form of rule obedience, that can be derived directly from the moral system they articulate.281 Even Professor Nozick recognizes the relational character of procedural rights, and agrees that such rights exist independent of substantive entitlements.282 This is quite remarka- ble, because Nozick is a true natural rights philosopher, who treats lib- erty and property as inherent and fundamental.283 The Court's view that procedural protection must be attached to 278.

NOZICK, supra note 279, at 101-08. The argument is that it is wrong to punish an innocent person by using an unreliable procedure because it violates the innocent person's liberty. (A reliable procedure does not do so, even if it produces the wrong result.) Guilty people have no right to reliable procedures since they deserve the punishment they receive. But if the deci- sionmaker does not know whether the person is innocent or guilty, he or she must use reliable procedures to avoid violating the person's rights. What makes Nozick "modern," and therefore allies him with Fuller, Fried, and Rawls, is his recognition of the problem of imperfect knowledge or uncertainty. It is precisely this problem that forges the link between the right to an accurate decision and the right to procedural protection. 283. Id. at ix, 10-12. Nozick's focus on inherent individual rights is so uncompromising that he rejects all forms of distributive justice, equality of opportunity, public taxation, and the entirety of the administrative state, see id. at 167-74, 235-38, yet he argues that "[a]n unreliable [i.e. inaccu- rate] punisher violates no right of the guilty person; but still he may not punish him. . . .

Nozick seems to qualify this</page><page sequence="58">1984] ADMINISTRATIVE DUE PROCESS 1101 some underlying right is thus based on a conception of rights that is at odds with modern legal and philosophic thought. Nothing supports the Court's position other than the natural rights philosophy of the Lochner v. New York era that modern doctrine has so definitively rejected. The Court realizes this difficulty, which is why it has been so hesitant to establish independent federal definitions of "liberty" and "property." But because it insists on the form, if not the content, of the underlying rights concept, it has continued to search for some method of defining those mythological entities. The only obvious place to find them, once the search begins, is positive state law, which has the previously noted effect of undermining the federal nature of the due process guarantee. Abandoning the notion of inherent rights, however, resolves this particular problem. Rights can be defined in terms of interpersonal relationships without being separately contained in, or owned by, any of the participants in those relationships. Such rights, including the right to procedural protection, can be found either in positive law or in social principles, depending on one's view. Fortunately, there is no need to choose a view at this stage of the analysis, because the right to procedural protection is grounded in the concept of due process, which is incontrovertibly both a positive enactment and a generally accepted social principle. The individual interest or underlying rights idea, therefore, can simply be abandoned. This is hardly an extreme position, since it con- stitutes the general state of procedural due process doctrine between the time the right-privilege distinction fell into desuetude and the artic- ulation of the liberty-property approach in Roth. Nor does it mean that the importance of the individual's interest need be entirely ignored. Courts might continue to treat that interest, in appropriate circum- stances, as one element in determining the extent of procedural protec- tion that would be imposed. What courts would not do, however, is give the individual's interest a preliminary and preclusive role in deter- mining the applicability of the due process clause. Finally, eliminating the underlying rights notion does not mean that the phrase "life, lib- erty, or property" must be read out of the constitutional text. It may simply mean that the phrase should be read as characterizing the na- ture of the government's interaction with the individual, rather than the nature of the nonprocedural right that triggers procedural protection. statement at the beginning of the following paragraph, but by the end of the paragraph he restates it.

The Basis of the Standard The Roth liberty-property approach, though heavily criticized, is so familiar as the foundation of due process doctrine that the possibility of its elimination may produce a sense of vertigo. It is not difficult, however, to articulate the requirements for an alternative theory. The starting point should be the prevailing modern view that rights are de- rived from relationships between people, or between people and gov- ernment, rather than from inquiries into the inherent qualities of either. The fourteenth amendment, at least if one accepts the state action con- cept in its present form, is exclusively directed toward relations be- tween people and the government.284 Thus, the basic enterprise of interpreting "procedural due process" is to determine the procedures that the government must employ in dealing with individuals. Despite the agonies of the past decade, a consensus exists about the purpose of these procedures: to ensure accurate decisionmaking in government adjudications.285 An accurate decision is defined as one that finds the facts as they actually are and applies the law to those facts in accordance with prevailing doctrine.286 Underlying this con- 284. The current doctrine is that due process applies only to government actions, specifically to government actions possessing some undefined quality of affirmativeness. See, e.g., Flagg Bros. v. Brooks, 436 U.S. 149 (1978) (law authorizing warehouseman to exercise lien against bailor, without notice or hearing, does not constitute state action). Most of the leading state action cases involve the equal protection clause, see, e.g., Moose Lodge No. 107 v. Irvis, 407 U.S. 163 (1972); Burton v. Wilmington Parking Auth., 365 U.S. 715 (1961), but the definition of state action is presumably the same for both clauses. 285. See, e.g., L. TRIBE, supra note 4, at 503-04; Grey, Procedural Fairness and Substantive Rights, 18 NoMos: DUE PROCESS 182-84 (1977); Kadish, supra note 270, at 346; Mashaw, The Management Side of Due Process.

REV. 772 (1974); Newman, supra note 261, at 219-20; Scanlon, Due Process, 18 NOMos: DUE PROCESS 98-100 (1977). To quote Professor Michelman, one of the leading proponents of the dignitary theory: "An obvious purpose of formal explanatory procedures is vindication of the private claims of individuals to have what belongs to them under the law." Michelman, supra note 4, at 127 (footnote omitted). 286. Some commentators deny that accuracy is a workable criterion, preferring the more gen- eral notion of "fairness." But their definition of fairness generally includes accuracy considera- tions. See, e.g., 2 K. DAVIS, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW TREATISE ? 10:4, at 317-21 (2d ed. 1978). See generally J. MASHAW, SOCIAL SECURITY HEARINGS AND APPEALS (1978). Many others believe that the clause is designed to serve additional goals, see supra notes 270-72, although the Court continues to insist that accurate decisionmaking is the only one, see, e.g., Olim v. Wakinekona, 103 S. Ct. 1741, 1748 (1983) (guarantee of procedural protection not designed to vindicate substantive right would be "needless formality"); Harris v. Rivera, 454 U.S. 339 (1981) (facially inconsistent bench trial verdicts, without any explanation by judge, do not create sufficient risk of error to violate due process); Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319 (1976) (granting procedural protection requires consideration of the extent of individual interest in underlying right, or risk of error in adjudication). At least one commentator believes that the clause serves fewer goals. See Easter- brook, supra note 264 (due process imposes no limits on legislature in designing adjudicative pro-</page><page sequence="60">1984] ADMINISTRATIVE DUE PROCESS 1103 cern for accuracy is a notion that inaccurate determinations are unfair to individuals. While accuracy may also be viewed as an ingredient of sound policymaking or efficient operations, our current view of the Constitution is that it is not directed toward matters such as these.287 Instead, it concerns what Deans Choper and Ely have described as the failures of representational democracy,288 or what others have de- scribed as the set of values that are to be protected from any operation, unsuccessful or otherwise, of the representational process.289 The con- cern, therefore, must be that an inaccurate decision impinges on some basic value, the constitutional significance of which is defined either independently, or in terms of other values, or in terms of a democracy's inability to protect it. This basic value is essentially the rule of law-that is, the treat- ment of individuals in accordance with legal standards. An accuracy requirement imposes standards on the decisionmaker, both as a finder of fact and as an interpreter of law. It thus limits the individual discre- tion of state agents. The danger of unfettered discretion is that individ- uals can be subjected to personalized tyranny, no matter how democratic the system as a whole may be. State agents may demand bribes, seek unreasonable obeisance, take revenge, or act on the basis of caprice or inadvertence. It is the one-to-one interaction between the state agent and the individual that generates the danger. Such interac- tions call forth emotions that would otherwise be absent: antipathy based on the individual's appearance or personality traits, antagonism based on the individual's general attitude or particular interaction with the agent, and-perhaps the greatest danger in a mass bureaucracy- annoyance based upon the mere necessity of having to deal with yet another individual. These one-to-one interactions, moreover, create the opportunity for the state agent to act upon whatever emotions are called forth. They generally occur in the obscure and dusty corners of cedures). In any event, the common element of almost all of these disparate views is that due process guarantees that the government will employ procedures sufficient to ensure that its deci- sions achieve a minimum standard of accuracy. 287. Some commentators have argued that the Court's instrumentalist view of due process reduces the concept from a right to a policy consideration. See, e.g., Mashaw, The Supreme Court's Due Process Calculusfor Administrative Adjudication in Mathews v. Eldridge: Three Fac- tors in Search of a Theory of Value, 44 U. CHI. L. REV. 28, 49 (1976); Note, Specifying the Proce- dures Required by Due Process. Toward Limits on the Use of Interest Balancing, 88 HARV. L. REV. 1510, 1524-27 (1975). On one level, that is probably true. There is, nonetheless, a difference between recognizing accurate decisionmaking as a right, even if that recognition is based on a utilitarian basis, and treating it as a mere matter of good policy. 288.

Procedure is our traditional method for ensuring that the decision in question is accurate, thus protecting individuals from the potential oppressions of direct interaction with state agents.290 The explanation for the special status that the Constitution confers on this protection, therefore, is simply that the danger of such oppression is too great and its consequences too severe to leave the matter to the political process. Under the Choper and Ely model,291 the Constitution establishes a representational democracy as the basic safeguard for individual rights, and then specifically protects the rights that such a system might under- value or transgress. Protection against individualized oppression is cer- tainly such a right. Relatively few individuals have any real access to the political process; it is only large groups or powerful individuals that can influence the legislature or the executive. Therefore, as long as the state oppresses people one at a time, their only serious protection lies in the judiciary's ability to impose due process requirements on state decisions.292 Having identified the generally accepted purpose of due process protection, the next question is whether identifiable limits on due pro- cess protection exist, particularly in relation to administrative decision- making. The Court's adoption of the liberty-property approach was almost certainly motivated by a desire to contain the genie Goldberg had released.293 Eliminating the underlying rights test as a trigger for due process protection necessarily raises that concern again. The prob- lem is to describe a boundary that is both workable and close to soci- ety's intuitive consensus about the appropriate level of due process protection. There is, of course, no need for the boundary to follow the precise contour of existing decisions; indeed, no consistent rationale could do so.294 290. See Kadish, supra note 270, at 340 ("[P]rocedural limitations proceed from historical insights, that the manner in which governmental power is exercised upon the individual, even in an area of legitimate governmental concern, requires limitations.") (footnote omitted). 291. See J. CHOPER, supra note 288, passim; J. ELY, supra note 255, passim. 292. Professor Easterbroook maintains that "[t]here is no logical reason why legislatures would underestimate the value of process" when they are designing legislation. Easterbrook, supra note 264, at 117. Even if this is true, due process rights are primarily designed to protect people against administrators, not legislators. The legislature may have no reason to undervalue procedural concerns rather than substantive ones, but if it happens to do so, the impact on individ- uals will be qualitatively different. A law with inadequate procedures will enable state adminis- trators to oppress individuals in a way that would not be possible through the enactment of any generalized nonprocedural law. Therefore, the due process clause must operate to forbid the legis- lature from enacting laws that give administrators power of that kind. 293. See supra notes 86-90 and accompanying text. 294.

Professor Smolla argues that courts must distinguish between protected and unprotected interests, presumably because due process, like other constitu-</page><page sequence="62">1984] ADMINISTRATIVE DUE PROCESS 1105 2. The Content of the Standard With these considerations in mind, it is now possible to explore what we mean by due process or fair procedure. In the loyalty-security cases of the 1950's, the Supreme Court began to articulate a workable due process doctrine. Subsequent developments have obscured the ba- sic theory of those cases, which are cited in the post-Roth decisions largely for their unintended implications about the individual interest issue.295 But the cases in fact dealt directly with the meaning of fair procedure and established two important principles. The first may be called the principle of rule obedience: that government decisionmakers must follow preestablished rules in adjudicative processes. The second is the principle of minimum procedures: that certain minimum adjudi- catory procedures must be followed in various situations. If the gov- ernment violated either of these principles, its action was deemed arbitrary, and therefore a violation of the due process clause. a. The Rule-Obedience Princiole The rule-obedience principle simply establishes our basic concept of legality. Suppose a decisionmaker announces: "I recognize that the rules, that is, the law, grant you a particular benefit, but I decline to apply those rules in deciding your particular case." As Professor Smolla has pointed out,296 such a decision is obviously improper-law- less one might say. By definition it violates the substantive rule that has been ignored. It also violates the principle of procedural due pro- cess; it is the very antithesis of accurate decisionmaking, since accuracy is the proper application of the law to the case at hand. Nothing leaves a state agent as much room for venality, hatred, caprice, or carelessness as the power to ignore the applicable rules. And from a dignitary per- spective, the failure to follow applicable rules subjects individuals to a totally arbitrary regime, thereby denying them any possible control over their fate. Therefore, even if the state provides no cause of action for the decisionmaker's violation of a substantive law, the federal Con- tional rights, must be contained within some recognizable boundaries. But categorizing types of interests is not the only way to establish such boundaries. Experience indicates that limiting due process protection based on the nature of some underlying right is unsatisfactory. See supra Part II, Section A. An alternative approach is to base the boundaries on the nature of the governmen- tal action. 295. See, e.g., Paul v.

If government is not obligated to enact rules, as it obviously is not, why should it be obligated to obey those rules it chose to enact? One answer described, but not advanced, by Professors Stewart and Sunstein is simply the common understanding of the word "rules": it would mislead people to declare rules if they did not carry with them the obligation of obedience.298 More important, since peo- ple might learn to be wary, such rules would also confer on the govern- ment's actions a legitimacy to which they were not entitled.299 A second answer is that the counterintuitive element results from a perception that rules generally contract the power of state officials by placing limits on their actions. In the modern state, however, this no- tion is often incorrect. Rules frequently expand official power, creating governmental functions that did not previously exist. It seems appro- priate, therefore, to require obedience to the limiting principles that accompany these general grants of power. Still another answer is that "the government" is a combination of different functional units, not a monolithic entity. In the traditional model of government, one unit-the legislature-makes the rules while another unit-the judiciary-adjudicates. Under this model, there is nothing problematic about permitting the legislature to alter preexist- ing rules while requiring the judiciary to obey them.3?" While the structural difference between rulemaking and adjudicatory units has disappeared in the modern administrative agency, the functional dis- tinction between the two activities remains.30' Requiring administra- tive agencies to abide by their own rules, therefore, preserves the appropriate separation of functions. The most basic answer, however, is the identified purpose of pro- 297. See Note, The Rule of Law and the States: A New Interpretation of the Guarantee Clause, 93 YALE L.J. 561 (1984) (interpreting the guarantee clause as a constitutional requirement that states follow their own rules when dealing with individuals). 298. Stewart &amp; Sunstein, Public Programs andPrivate Rights, 95 HARV. L. REV. 1193, 1258-60 (1982). The authors' basis for questioning this principle, which they characterize as either "legis- lative candor" or "honoring expectations," is that neither is definitively linked with recognized constitutional values. In fact, those themes can be found, but primarily in the context of adjudica- tion rather than rulemaking. See, e.g., Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 577 (1972) (entitle- ments); Vitarelli v. Seaton, 359 U.S. 535 (1959) (candor). See infra notes 336-49 and accompanying text (discussing the distinction between rulemaking and adjudication for due pro- cess purposes). 299. I am indebted to Professor Paul Mishkin for this idea. 300. Of course, the legislature might circumvent the constitutional provision by adjudicating cases, but this is just what the bill of attainder clause prevents. U.S. CONST. art. I, ? 9, cl. 3. 301. This explanation, by distinguishing the levels of government, demonstrates that the rule- obedience principle is applied only in adjudicatory contexts. See infra text accompanying note 330.</page><page sequence="64">1984] ADMINISTRATIVE DUE PROCESS 1107 cedural due process: to provide people with protection when state offi- cials act directly upon them as individuals. Due process applies, therefore, only when the state acts in this way--not when the state chooses not to act. And when it applies, it governs only the manner by which the state brings its force to bear. The failure to follow preexist- ing rules is an arbitrary use of that force, one that allows precisely the oppressive action that the clause is designed to prevent. Therefore, be- cause the legitimacy of state power is conditioned upon a norm that governs the legitimate exercise of power, it is hardly surprising that the rule-obedience principle takes effect only when that power is exercised. The rule-obedience principle tends to be overlooked because it is not typically a demanding requirement. Since it governs the way in which a state applies its own laws, primarily a question for the state to resolve, federal review is necessarily based upon a standard of mini- mum rationality.302 Either the state must concede that it is not follow- ing its own rules, or the interpretation of the rule the state claims to be following must be patently irrational. The rule-obedience principle is, therefore, essentially equivalent to the minimum rationality require- ment of equal protection.303 Of course, due process, like equal protection, imposes require- ments beyond mere rationality in certain situations. The basic due pro- cess situation that demands heightened scrutiny is the application of the criminal laws. Just as the minimum-procedures principle operates more stringently in criminal cases as a matter of explicit constitutional provisions, the rule-obedience principle operates more stringently as a matter of judicially articulated doctrine. The major aspect of that doc- trine is the void-for-vagueness notion,304 which is simply a special case 302. Cf Smolla, supra note 5, at 107-20 (analyzing Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co., 455 U.S. 422 (1982), as a minimum rationality decision). 303. See Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co., 455 U.S. 422, 438-42 (1982) (Blackmun, J., concur- ring). For a nondoctrinal expression of the same relationship, see J. RAWLS, supra note 279, ? 38, at 239. Equal protection requires that similar cases be treated in a similar manner, which means that the state must apply a rule to everyone who falls within its scope. And in the absence of a suspect classification or fundamental interest, the equal protection standard of review is minimum rationality. See, e.g., New Orleans v. Dukes, 427 U.S. 297 (1976); Railway Express Agency v. New York, 336 U.S. 106 (1949); Gunther, The Supreme Court, 1971 Term-Foreword: In Search of Evolving Doctrine on a Changing Court: A Modelfor a New Equal Protection, 86 HARV. L. REV. 1 (1972); McCloskey, Economic Due Process and the Supreme Court. An Exhumation and Reburial, 1962 SUP. CT. REV. 34. But see Note, supra note 297, at 577-79 (rule-obedience principle requires federal court to review state interpretations of state law where state interpretations result in neglect of constitutionally imposed duties). This suggests that a basic requirement of rationality underlies both the due process and the equal protection clauses, a requirement demanded by our basic sense of fair and just behavior by the state. 304. See, e.g., Hynes v. Mayor of Oradell, 425 U.S. 610 (1976); Papachristou v. City of Jack- sonville, 405 U.S. 156 (1972); Coates v.City of Cincinnati, 402 U.S. 611 (1971); Lanzetta v.

Viewed as a structural standard for drafting general legislation, vagueness fits awkwardly into our constitutional frame- work.305 But as Professors Amsterdam and Foote have suggested, the doctrine can be viewed as a restraint on executive discretion, since it forbids the vague grant of authority that would permit officials to en- force the criminal law selectively.306 In other words, rules must be stated with clarity sufficient to permit a more definitive judgment about whether the officials are following them. The doctrine is pointless un- less administrators are under an affirmative obligation to follow these rules. But once that obligation exists, the doctrine's additional require- ments become a means of applying the rule-obedience principle with something beyond the minimal rationality standard. Numerous cases extending into the post-Roth era affirm the princi- ple of rule obedience.3"7 Other cases rely on or reflect the principle, even though they do not state it as such, Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co.308 being the most notable example. Recently, however, the Court has called this principle into question with respect to internal agency (1974); Note, The Void-for- Vagueness Doctrine in the Supreme Court, 109 U. PA. L. REv. 67 (1960) (Professor Anthony Amsterdam's student note) [hereinafter cited as Note, Void-for- Vagueness Doctrine]. 305. Apart from the vagueness doctrine, there are virtually no constraints on the manner in which legislation is phrased. The Court's previous invalidation of statutes containing irrebutable presumptions was an attempt at such a constraint, but this approach has been repudiated. See infra note 380; cf Linde, Due Process of Lawmaking, 55 NEB. L. REv. 197 (1976) (argument for imposition of procedural standard on lawmaking process that could include vagueness concept). The cases invoke the procedural due process notion that a vague law fails to give a person notice of what the state forbids. See Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville, 405 U.S. 156, 162 (1972); Lanzetta v. New Jersey, 306 U.S. 451, 453 (1939). But this is obviously a very different use of the term "notice" from that found in procedural due process cases, where notice refers to specific information about an upcoming adjudication. Any notice requirement for general laws would involve constructive notice only, since individuals are expected to know the law. See Texaco, Inc. v. Short, 454 U.S. 516, 532 (1982); North Laramie Land Co. v. Hoffman, 268 U.S. 276, 283 (1925). 306. See Foote, supra note 304; Note, Void-for-Vagueness Doctrine, supra note 304. This ra- tionale was explicitly adopted by the Court. See Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville, 405 U.S. 156, 168-70 (1972); Cox v. Louisiana, 379 U.S. 536 (1965). 307. See, e.g., Morton v. Ruiz, 415 U.S. 199, 235 (1974); Yellin v. United States, 374 U.S. 109, 143-44 (1963); Kelly v. Railroad Retirement Bd., 625 F.2d 486, 491-92 (3d Cir. 1980); Mathews v. Walter, 512 F.2d 941, 946 (D.C.

Logan involved a state agency that was required to process claims within a fixed time period. The agency refused to do so, and the state court held that "failure to comply deprived the [agency] of jurisdiction," id at 427, thereby requiring it to dismiss the claim. The Court based its unanimous reversal on the rationale that the claimant had been deprived of property (her cause of action) without due process. But there is no denial of due process in setting a time limit upon individual claims. Merely reciting the claimant's right to a hearing, as the Court did, id. at 433-37, is not quite sufficient. On the one hand, the claimant is not entitled to a hearing on an untimely claim; on the other hand, she is entitled to a hearing on whether the claim was untimely, which the state court provided. The real problem with the state's action was that the agency failed to follow the applicable rule that hearings must be provided.</page><page sequence="66">1984] ADMINISTRATIVE DUE PROCESS 1109 rules309 and rules that are purely procedural in nature.310 As will be discussed below,311 these cases are more properly regarded as involving the scope of the rule-obedience principle. None of them really chal- lenges the constitutional notion that an agency must follow prevailing law in adjudicating individual cases, though these cases do contain some fairly ominous language. b. The Minimum-Procedures Principle The second principle that emerges from the loyalty-security cases is that a state must provide certain minimum procedures in various ad- judicatory contexts. These procedures are generally identified as no- tice, a hearing, and an impartial decisionmaker. The connection between them and the due process goal of accurate decisionmaking is virtually self-evident, since the trial-type interaction that these proce- dures establish reflects our basic model of decisional accuracy.312 Any substantive requirement for accurate decisionmaking would require us to decide how much accuracy we want, but setting accepta- ble accuracy levels is a daunting task-one for which courts are notably ill suited. Procedure eliminates this problem, at least in the nonadministrative realm, because we have a general consensus about the proper amount of procedure-specifically those procedures associ- ated with civil and criminal trials-that substitutes for the absence of consensus about accuracy levels. There are, of course, numerous other grounds on which the impo- sition of minimum procedures can be justified. While accurate deci- sionmaking has been characterized, quite properly, as "instru- mental,"313 it is not the only instrumental justification. Procedures might be imposed for heuristic purposes, either because they are them- selves instructive or because they provide the individual with sufficient information to alter future behavior. This might be particularly useful in certain contexts such as school suspensions. Procedures might also be employed to reconcile people to unfavorable decisions, thus serving the very instrumental purpose of keeping the decisionmaker alive. In 309. Schweiker v. Hansen, 450 U.S. 785, 789-90 (1981) (per curiam) (violation of precatory rule in agency manual does not invalidate agency action); United States v. Caceres, 440 U.S. 741, 753-55 (1979) (violation of internal rule that does not affect propriety of agency action does not require exclusion of evidence in criminal proceeding). 310. Olim v. Wakinekona, 103 S. Ct. 1741 (1983); Board of Curators v. Horowitz, 435 U.S. 78, 92 n.8 (1978). 311. See infra text acompanying notes 388-410. 312. Indeed, the trial model is so basic that the notion of accurate decisionmaking is probably derived from its provisions, rather than the reverse. Other models are possible, of course, as Pro- fessor Mashaw has suggested, see generally J. MASHAW, BUREAUCRATIC JUSTICE (1983); Mashaw, supra note 285, and some of these may have better claims to accuracy in certain situations. 313. L. TRIBE, supra note 4, at 501-03.</page><page sequence="67">1110 CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 72:1044 this context, they might be viewed as an alternative to compromise,314 thus freeing decisionmakers to act more definitively and speak more resoundingly in certain situations. Minimum procedures might also have noninstrumental or inher- ent justifications. The most common is the dignitary theory that these procedures indicate respect for human beings, and a commitment to treat people as ends rather than means. There is also the notion that Professor Rawls refers to as pure procedural justice: the use of proce- dures to reach a decision may be the most reliable way to define fair- ness in that situation, particularly if we have no external standard for the fairness of the result.315 c. The Due Process Cause of Action The two principles of rule obedience and minimum procedures es- tablish the basic content of "procedural due process" or, more pre- cisely, the elements of a due process cause of action. Since both are necessary, denial of either will constitute a constitutional violation. To state the cause of action, the plaintiff must allege that he or she was denied the protection that these principles afford: that the government failed to follow applicable rules, or to provide minimum procedures in a situation where such procedures are required. According to our gen- eral consensus, that is what we mean when we say that the person was denied due process of law. The current obsession with defining liberty and property has been so intense that the Court has, in a few cases, actually forgotten that the denial of due process rights is a necessary element of a due process cause of action. The two most notable examples are Paul v. Davis316 and Parratt v. Taylor.317 Justice Rehnquist's concern in Paul was essentially a "floodgates of litigation" problem. He saw the plaintiff's case as standing for the proposition that a person could maintain a due process claim over the commission of any common law tort by a government official. But that was not the nature of the plaintiff's claim in Paul. He was not com- plaining that the officials had defamed him by characterizing him as an active shoplifter; rather, he was complaining that they had denied him notice and a hearing on the accuracy of their characterization. In other words, he was claiming a deprivation of due process rights, not the 314. See Coons, Approaches to Court Imposed Compromise--The Uses of Doubt and Reason, 58 Nw. U.L.

His solution to this imaginary problem was an extremely odd definition of liberty. That would have been unnecessary had he realized that tort law claims by themselves are not actionable under the fourteenth amendment; whatever the interest involved, they fail to sat- isfy another element of a due process cause of action-a denial of procedures. The possibility that had seemed so troubling to Justice Rehnquist in Paul was actually presented to the Court in Parratt. Prison officials had negligently lost the hobby kit that a prisoner had ordered, and the prisoner sued for deprivation of property without due process of law. The hobby kit was undoubtedly property, Justice Rehnquist's opinion held,319 but state law tort remedies provided all the process that was due. Consequently, no federal remedy was required.320 But although the plaintiff did allege a loss of property, he did not allege a deprivation of due process rights, and thus failed to state a federal cause of action. The plaintiff did not want to claim that he was entitled to a hearing prior to the negligent action of the prison officials, presumably for the simple reason that such a hearing would be impossible for anyone to provide.321 In any case, negligent loss of property does not entail the 318. See Monaghan, supra note 4, at 427-28. Professor Smolla defends the Paul decision, arguing that the acceptance of plaintiff's due process claim would have enabled him to avoid the carefully balanced rules of common law defamation cases. Smolla, The Displacement of Federal Due Process Claims by State Tort Remedies: Parratt v. Taylor and Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co., 1982 U. ILL. L. REV. 831, 836-44. But since the claims are different, the balances are differ- ent. Truth is a complete defense to common law defamation, but the truth of the government's position is not a defense to a due process claim. A state could not justify denying criminal defend- ants their right to trial with an offer of proof that the defendants were really guilty. To challenge the denial of a hearing, the plaintiff need only prove that he or she has a colorable claim. The further proof of a winning claim is necessary only to challenge the result of the hearing, which is not what Paul was doing. In other words, the state could have defended against the plaintiff's due process claim only by proving that his factual assertions were not colorable, although it could have defended against his defamation claim by proving that its assertions were true. 319. Parratt, 451 U.S. at 536. The basis for the conclusion is actually not clear. If Justice Rehnquist were following the Roth approach, he would first be required to determine whether state law regarded tangible objects ordered and paid for by a prisoner as property. Presumably the state would be free not to do so. 320. Id at 544. 321. Id at 543. Justice Rehnquist presaged the problem presented by Parratt in his Paul opinion, when he stated that if the plaintiff's claim were granted, "it would be difficult to see why the survivors of an innocent bystander mistakenly shot by a policeman or negligently killed by a sheriff driving a government vehicle, would not have claims equally cognizable under ? 1983." Paul v. Davis, 424 U.S. 693, 698 (1976). By including the words "negligently" and "mistakenly," Justice Rehnquist went right past the crucial issue. His hypothetical case is indeed one that we would not want to recognize as a due process violation, but that is precisely because the actions are negligent and mistaken in the sense of being accidental. The state obviously cannot provide a</page><page sequence="69">1112 CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 72:1044 kind of particularized oppression that is the gravamen of a due process violation. Nor could the plaintiff have alleged the inadequacy of sub- sequent remedies, having brought his federal suit before pursuing any other remedy. Because the Court treated the individual interest as a precondition, and the only precondition, it found itself grappling with the merits of a case that should have been dismissed on other grounds. Of course, since Parratt's result is equivalent to a dismissal, and since that result is virtually unassailable, the question may seem aca- demic, at best. But there is an important difference between a dismissal and a decision on the merits. A dismissal means that a state official's negligent action does not implicate the due process clause because there has been no subsequent failure to provide required procedural protec- tion. The Court's decision on the merits means that negligent action does involve the due process clause, if the action is taken with respect to "liberty" or "property," but that the subsequent procedures satisfy the clause's requirements. The difference is that the Court's approach will tend to restrict the individual's right to due process in accordance with the state's ability to provide a remedy. Given the Court's self- imposed dilemma that any negligent state action can implicate due pro- cess, this restrictive tendency is likely to be a powerful one.322 This is precisely what happened this past Term in Hudson v. Palmer,323 where the Court extended Parratt to cases of intentional tort. At issue was an individual's claim that prison officers had intentionally and maliciously destroyed his personal property, thereby violating the prior hearing in such circumstances. By contrast, the state's action in naming the plaintiff in Paul was hardly accidental. It was, in fact, purposeful, although possibly incorrect. If one removes the crucial words "negligently" or "mistakenly" from Justice Rehnquist's hypothetical and replaces them with purposeful action, one gets quite a different result: [I]t would [indeed] be difficult to see why the survivors of an innocent [person] ... shot by a policeman [who had been ordered to gun down unsavory characters] or. . . killed by a sheriff driving a government vehicle [because they were jaywalking] would not have claims equally cognizable under ? 1983. See Screws v. United States, 325 U.S. 91, 106 (1945) (police officer who deliberately beat person to death violated person's due process rights). 322. Judge Posner's dissent in a recent due process case demonstrates the point. Vail v. Board of Educ., 706 F.2d 1435, 1449 (7th Cir. 1983) (Posner, J., dissenting), af'd by an equally divided Court, 104 S. Ct. 2144 (1984). Dissenting from the Seventh Circuit's holding that a fired school athletic director was entitled to damages for violation of his due process rights, Judge Posner states: "[S]ince the right Vail was allegedly deprived of is just a right to a particular remedy- damages-he cannot complain that he has been deprived of that right unless the state fails to provide him with a remedy." Id at 1453 (Posner, J., dissenting). But the law does not really create rights to remedies; rather, it creates rights to something else and provides remedies for the violation of these rights. Here, Vail was complaining that the state had violated his right to a predetermination hearing, not his right to any particular remedy for breach of contract, as Judge Posner suggests. Id at 1452-53 (Posner, J., dissenting). The mere fact that the trial court granted money damages does not alter the nature of the right. 323. 104 S. Ct. 3194 (1984).</page><page sequence="70">1984] ADMINISTRA TIVE DUE PROCESS 1113 due process clause.324 The Court held that post-deprivation remedies were adequate because the "State can no more anticipate and control in advance the random and unauthorized intentional conduct of its em- ployees than it can anticipate similar negligent conduct."325 To be sure, the Court conceded, the individual prison officers could anticipate and control their behavior, unlike the absent-minded behavior of the Parratt officers, but the "controlling inquiry is solely whether the State is in a position to provide for predeprivation process."326 Unlike Parratt, which reaches a reasonable conclusion by an un- justifiable route, Hudson seems simply wrong in its result. It is unclear from the opinion who possesses the mysterious quality of being "the state," but it is presumably various rulemakers, most notably the legis- lature. Now suppose a trial judge-not "the state" by this hypothesis- greets a criminal defendant by saying, "You look guilty as hell. I'm going to convict you without a trial." Presumably, this violates the due process clause, even though "the state" may have no more control over its errant judges than its errant wardens. Whether "the state" is really at fault in this case is an interesting question, albeit a metaphysical one. Whether the judge's improper be- havior can be prevented is more interesting because it is substantially less metaphysical. But it is unclear why either question should affect a person's right to be protected against particular kinds of action by state officials. There is nothing impractical about describing the behavior of the judge, or the prison officials in Hudson, as a violation of the due process clause. The claim is not that the prisoner was deprived of prop- erty, but that he was deprived of due process in particular circum- stances. If the federal court finds that the clause has been violated- and it would base the determination on the oppressiveness of the be- havior327--the state would pay damages for violating a constitutional right. The way for the state to avoid such violations in the future 324. Since the case was decided against the petitioner on the pleadings, his allegations had to be taken as true. The Court also held that prisoners have no fourth amendment rights against searches of their cells. Id. at 3200. 325. Id. at 3203. 326. Id at 3204. The Court was unanimous on the point. The fourth amendment holding drew a dissent from four justices. Id. at 3207 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). 327. The Court might conclude that summary seizure of a prisoner's property is justified be- cause of a "paramount interest in institutional security." Hudson, 104 S. Ct. at 3201; see also North Am. Cold Storage Co. v. City of Chicago, 211 U.S. 306 (1908) (summary seizure and de- struction of spoiled food justified by the state's interest in protecting human health). How this issue should be resolved is a difficult policy question that implicates one's ideas about punishment, rehabilitation, and governmental fairness. The point is that this is the question that the Court should have discussed. As it was, the necessity of balancing the rights of prisoners against the needs and objectives of penal institutions was discussed only in the fourth amendment section of the opinion. See Hudson, 104 S. Ct. at 3198-99.</page><page sequence="71">1114 CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 72:1044 would be by providing some sort of procedural protection before its agents destroy a prisoner's property, not by providing a subsequent remedy once the property is destroyed. If the state cannot control its prison officers, then it is in continuing violation of the Constitution. In Hudson, as in Parratt, the Court has difficulty because it has forgotten what due process is about. There is nothing objectionable about the result in Parratt; a post-deprivation hearing is perfectly satis- factory, not because it remedies a due process violation, but because there is no due process violation unless that hearing is denied. But in Hudson there was a violation: a prisoner was singled out and subjected to unconstrained, oppressive behavior by state agents. Having lost sight of the essential factor that distinguishes the cases, the Hudson Court was able to echo Parratt by going directly from the fact that the prisoners lost their property to the fact that the state provided post- deprivation hearings. But neither opinion considered whether the pris- oners had been denied due process of law. 3. Specijcity as a Limit on the Standard Even if the standard of procedural fairness, as embodied in the principles of rule obedience and minimum procedures, is a necessary component of a due process cause of action, it may not be a sufficient component. In addition, a due process theory must possess identifiable limits. This is not the misplaced concern of Paul and Parratt that all tort law might be subsumed under the due process clause, but the legiti- mate concern that due process analysis might be applied to the entire range of administrative actions. It was precisely this concern, of course, that started the Court down the garden path of defining liberty and property interests. That choice was unfortunate, but the Court's conceptual agonies do not obviate the need for a limiting principle. By focusing on the content of procedural due process, it is possible to generate a workable limiting principle. What makes a particular use of the due process clause "procedural," after all, is that it imposes stan- dards on the means of government adjudication. Procedural due pro- cess, then, is necessarily limited to adjudicatory contexts. Instead of determining whether the individual can assert a liberty or property in- terest, it is only necessary to determine the nature of the government's action about which the individual is complaining. If the action is adju- dicatory, the due process clause applies. That does not mean that gov- ernmental rules that must be obeyed necessarily exist, or that minimum procedures must be required; rather, it means that due process doctrine is the proper mode of analysis and that any decision to impose, or not impose, due process standards must be made by assessing the proper scope of those two basic principles.</page><page sequence="72">1984] ADMINISTRATIVE DUE PROCESS 1115 a. Adjudication as a Limit The same textual arguments that cast doubt on the preclusive use of the terms "liberty" and "property" lend support to the use of adjudi- cation as a limit. Such a limit is consistent with the view that the ambit of the clause should expand as the role of government expands. In 1791 and 1868, the phrase "life, liberty, or property" was sufficient to encompass all government adjudications.328 Consequently, one could reject the notion that it defines some limited set of individual interests, and conclude that it refers to the same totality. The fourteenth amend- ment version of the clause would then read: "nor shall any state take particular kinds of actions-namely adjudications-without due pro- cess of law." To be sure, there is something about the language that seems to imply an individual interest consideration. But our conceptu- alization of rights has changed from individual possessions to interper- sonal relations, and that change would account for the change in tone from the original text to the modern interpretation. Again, the ques- tion is whether we want to retain the clause's eighteenth- and nine- teenth-century scope, or whether we want to treat it as an expanding principle, translating its original concept of rights into our modern one.329 Limiting procedural due process protection to adjudicatory action is certainly consistent with the modern concept of rights. This is re- flected in the current law regarding rule obedience and minimum pro- cedures. There is no due process requirement that the government follow its own rules, unless it is performing an adjudicative function. Obviously a legislature's or an agency's rulemaking activities are not bound by the rules that it has previously promulgated. It can always change its own rules, subject to the restrictions on ex post facto actions.330 In fact, there is no due process requirement that administrative rulemakers follow rules promulgated by their structural superiors. Suppose, for example, that a state legislature duly instructs the welfare department to establish free medical clinics in rural areas and the de- partment refuses to do so, in apparent violation of state law. Rural residents may have a state law cause of action, but they have no federal cause of action for violation of due process. It is only when the govern- ment's failure to follow its rules involves adjudication that a due pro- cess claim exists. Suppose the legislation declares that every rural resident is eligible for free medical services, and a determination were 328. See supra text accompanying notes 259-60. 329.

That person would state a federal claim by alleging that the government had failed to fol- low its own rules for defining rural residents. Similarly, there is no due process requirement that minimum pro- cedures attend all governmental actions. Efforts have been made to articulate procedural standards for nonadjudicatory functions, such as legislation33 or rulemaking,332 but only the minimum procedures for adjudication have been recognized as part of established due process doctrine. Indeed, those minimum procedures for adjudications- notice, a hearing, and an impartial decisionmaker-have become so closely associated with procedural due process that they can serve as a limiting principle in their own right. As long as these requirements are imposed, the decision is likely to be regarded as a procedural, rather than a substantive, use of the due process clause. b. The Definition of Adjudication Procedural due process, then, is limited by its nature to adjudica- tory contexts. In order for the limitation to be precise, however, "adju- dication" must be defined with greater specificity. A century ago the definition would have been an intuitive and unchallenged one. Adjudi- cation was what courts did, as compared with rulemaking, which was what legislatures did.333 Legal doctrine both reflected and maintained this definition. The adjudicatory character of court activities was pre- served by rules regarding standing, mootness, ripeness, and case or controversy.334 Other doctrines maintained the nonadjudicatory char- acter of legislative action, the most notable being the bill of attainder clause, which prohibits the legislature from imposing punishments on individuals.335 331.

As a result, the distinction between these two basic modes of governmental action could no longer be based on the nature of the actor, and a more theoretical solution became necessary. Londoner v. City of Denver336 and Bi-Metallic Investment Co. v. State Board of Equalization337 provided the solution: rules are governmental actions affecting relatively large groups of people, whereas adjudica- tions are applications of the law or determinations of fact concerning specific individuals. Moreover, the cases explicitly linked this distinc- tion to the imposition of due process requirements.338 Londoner found that the absence of minimum procedures in assessing taxes against specified individuals violated due process, while the failure of the gov- ernment to follow its own rules in deciding to build a road did not.339 Bi-Metallic clarified this distinction, holding that an across-the-board tax increase, even if based on what purported to be a factual determi- nation, was not subject to the notice and hearing requirements of the due process clause.340 While Londoner and Bi-Metallic are not necessarily binding prece- that the Legislative Branch is not so well suited as politically independent judges and juries to the task of ruling upon the blameworthiness of, and levying appropriate punishment upon, specific persons." Id at 445; see also U.S. CONsT. art. I, ? 10, cl. 1 (prohibiting state legislatures from enacting ex post facto laws or impairing obligations of contract). A legislature is permitted to punish for contempt, which is a quasi-judicial act. But courts have increasingly required that any such punishment conform to the judicial model. See, e.g., Groppi v. Leslie, 404 U.S. 496 (1972); cf Watkins v. United States, 354 U.S. 178 (1957) (legislature may not punish for contempt unless individual has notice of his or her legal obligations). 336. 210 U.S. 373 (1908). 337. 239 U.S. 441 (1915). 338.

Atlantic Coast Line Co., 211 U.S. 210, 226 (1908): A judicial inquiry investigates, declares and enforces liabilities as they stand on present or past facts and under laws supposed already to exist. . . . Legislation on the other hand looks to the future and changes existing conditions by making a new rule to be applied thereafter to all or some part of those subject to its power. It is difficult to find cases that follow the Prentis test, however. The problem is not so much that legislation can be retrospective in certain cases, see, e.g., Flemming v. Nestor, 363 U.S. 603 (1960); De Veau v Braisted, 363 U.S. 144 (1960); Carpenter v. Pennsylvania, 58 U.S. (17 How.) 456 (1854), but that adjudication is so often prospective. Whenever a judicial decision states or im- plies a new rule, it operates just as prospectively as legislation. See, e.g., NLRB v. Wyman- Gordon Co., 394 U.S. 759 (1969). The only way to avoid this conclusion is to view the courts as discovering existing laws, rather than creating new ones. Justice Holmes was apparently some- what dubious of that approach even in Prentis, when he referred to "laws supposed already to exist." 211 U.S. at 226. Some 20 years later, in Black &amp; White Taxicab &amp; Transfer Co. v. Brown &amp; Yellow Taxicab &amp; Transfer Co., 276 U.S. 518 (1928), he definitively rejected the notion that court-declared rules are based on "a transcendental body of law outside of any particular State but obligatory within it unless and until changed by statute."

Florida East Coast Railway,342 the Court emphasized the general applicability of an Interstate Commerce Commission ratesetting regulation in holding that the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) and the Interstate Commerce Act required only the quasi- legislative procedures of informal rulemaking, rather than the quasi- judicial procedures of rulemaking on the record.343 Justice Rehnquist's opinion for the Court explicitly analogized this quasi-legislative/quasi- judicial distinction to the rulemaking/adjudication distinction Londoner and Bi-Metallic made in interpreting the due process clause.3" Similarly, a number of decisions, most recently Heckler v. Campbell,345 have held that an agency can use informal rulemaking to foreclose an issue from individual adjudication if, and only if, its rules are general ones. As Justice Powell wrote in Campbell: "the regula- tions afford claimants ample opportunity both to present evidence re- lating to their own abilities and to offer evidence that the [general rules] do not apply to them."346 Informal rulemaking foreclosed only a "gen- 341. The distinction figures prominently in modern zoning cases. See, e.g., Horn v. County of Ventura, 24 Cal. 3d 605, 596 P.2d 1134, 156 Cal. Rptr. 718 (1979); West v. City of Portage, 392 Mich. 458, 221 N.W.2d 303 (1974); Fasano v.

The state decisions in this area are generally based on statute or state administrative law rather than due process. However, the Supreme Court almost reached the due process issue in City of Eastlake v. Forest City Enters., 426 U.S. 668 (1976), a challenge to a city charter provision that required proposed land use changes for individual parcels to be ratified by referendum. Chief Justice Burger's opinion for the Court answered the charge that the referendum was an unconsti- tutional delegation of legislative power. The people, he held, were the source of legislative power, so that delegation standards did not apply to them. As the dissents by Justices Powell and Stevens pointed out, this formalist analysis misses the basic point, which is whether the action taken com- ported with due process. Both dissents argued that it did not, precisely because it determined the rights of a single property owner.

This potential is due to both the nature of the interaction, which permits illegitimate motives to arise, and the lack of other protections for the individual. In other words, the theoretical definition of adjudication that is needed in the modem administrative state is fully congruent with due process concepts. The central purpose of procedural due pro- cess-to provide protection against individualized oppression by the government-thus constitutes the limiting principle for the clause's op- eration by informing the definition of adjudication.350 347. Id at 1958. 348. One reason is that the APA uses adjudication as a residual category to describe every- thing that is not defined as rulemaking. See 5 U.S.C. ? 551(6)-(7) (1982). The APA defines a rule as "an agency statement of general or particular applicability." 5 U.S.C. ? 551(4) (1982). This phrase is probably intended to permit rules to apply to particular situations or groups of parties, but not to allow them to supplant adjudication in determining the rights of individuals. See Fed- eral Power Comm'n v. Texaco, Inc., 377 U.S. 33 (1964) (agency may make rules affecting rates of independent producers as a group, at least when it provides waiver procedure for particular appli- cants); 2 K. DAVIS, supra note 286, at 10-15; Schwartz, Administrative Terminology and the Admin- istrative Procedures Act, 48 MICH. L. REV. 57, 68-69 (1949); c. Heckler v. Campbell, 103 S. Ct. 1952 (1983) (agency may make rules generally affecting applicants for Social Security benefits, provided it gives applicants opportunity for individualized hearing on issues particular to them). 349. See Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402 (1971). The agency determination in Overton Park was quite specific with respect to a thing-the public property of the park-but its effect on individuals was only general. Under the APA, the agency's action is properly characterized as adjudication. It is notable, however, that the Court declined to impose any procedural requirements on the decision, despite its lack of sympathy for the result. Id at 417. This suggests that the generality of the effect was a determinative feature. Other illustrations are the cases involving ex parte contacts in rulemaking. Forbidding such contacts is an adjudica- tion-related idea reminiscent of, and perhaps an aspect of, due process. In deciding challenges to rulemaking proceedings on the ground that ex parte contact occurred, the courts have tended to distinguish between proceedings that determined the rights of particular persons and those that were more general in effect, without relying on the APA characterization of the proceeding in question. See, e.g., Home Box Office, Inc. v. FCC, 567 F.2d 9, 61 (D.C. Cir.) (MacKinnon, J., concurring), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 829 (1977); Action for Children's Television v. FCC, 564 F.2d 458 (D.C. Cir. 1977); Sangamon Valley Television Corp. v. United States, 269 F.2d 221 (D.C. Cir. 1959). 350. The idea that legislative enactments, i.e., "laws," must be general in effect is an extremely common one in jurisprudential literature. See, e.g., J. AUSTIN, supra note 278, at 94-98; 1 W. BLACKSTONE, supra note 17, at *44; L. FULLER, supra note 279, at 46-49; J. GRAY, THE NATURE AND SOURCES OF THE LAW 161-62 (2d ed. 1921); J. LOCKE, supra note 238, ?? 137-138. Some- times, the idea is presented in terms of a formalist view that a specific enactment is simply not a law; but other authors, including Blackstone, Locke, and Fuller, include the notion that law must not specify individuals.</page><page sequence="77">1120 CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 72:1044 This link between the general-specific distinction and the require- ments of the due process clause, which Professor Tribe has recently noted,35" is found in a number of modem Supreme Court opinions.352 In fact, the Court relied upon it in the midst of its conceptual miseries over the liberty-property standard. Texaco, Inc. v. Short353 involved a challenge to an Indiana statute under which a severed mineral interest reverts to the owner of the surface estate unless it is either used or a statement of claim is filed. Owners of mineral rights that had reverted under the statute alleged that they had been deprived of property with- out the constitutionally required notice, since the statute operated auto- matically in the absence of affirmative action by the owner. The Texaco Court, through Justice Stevens, began with the obliga- tory quotation from Roth that independent sources such as state law, and not the Constitution, create property rights.354 But the Court then proceeded to do precisely what Justice Stewart failed to do in Roth- apply the standard of procedural fairness to the facts presented by the case. The standard used was derived from the idea that procedural due process applies only in the adjudicatory context: Appellants also rely on a series of cases that have required specific no- tice and an opportunity to be heard before a driver's license is sus- pended for failure to post security after an accident, before property is seized pursuant to a prejudgment replevin order, or before service is terminated by a public utility for failure to tender payment of amounts due. In each of those cases, however, the property interest was taken only after a specific determination that the deprivation was proper. In the instant case, the State of Indiana has enacted a rule of law uni- formly affecting all citizens that establishes the circumstances in which a property interest will lapse through the inaction of its owner. None of the cases cited by appellants suggests that an individual must be given advance notice before such a rule of law may operate.355 351. L. TRIBE, supra note 4, at 503-04. 352.

The Court did not cite Londoner or Bi-Metallic. Instead, the opinion gives the impression that it developed the general-specific distinction anew, while struggling to distinguish the looming pres- ence of the recent due process cases. Justice Brennan, writing for the four dissenters, argued that the property rights of the land- owners could not be altered retrospectively without individualized notice to them. Unlike Justice Stevens, he seems to regard any vested property rights as existing independently of state law. This may be a reaction against the inclinations of the Burger Court majority. Conceivably, it explains Justice Brennan's somewhat curious revival of the public right-private right dichotomy in North- ern Pipeline Constr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U.S. 50 (1982).

Confusion in Application of the Standard Despite the familiarity of the general-specific distinction, the Court, and specifically Justice Stevens, seems to have lost track of it several times in recent years. The source of the confusion is the same as that in Paul, Parratt, and Hudson: the Court's treatment of the lib- erty-property concept-at best one element of the due process cause of action and arguably a subsidiary element-as the paramount consideration. For example, in Hampton v. Mow Sun Wong,356 the Court held that the Civil Service Commission's blanket exclusion of aliens from federal civil service positions violated the due process clause, possibly for lack of adequate procedures.37 Justice Stevens reasoned that "inel- igibility for employment in a major sector of the economy . . . is of sufficient significance to be characterized as a deprivation of an interest in liberty."358 But characterization of the exclusion's effect seems irrel- evant, because it was established by a general rule. From a due process point of view, the rule is no more objectionable than one that excludes college dropouts, convicted felons, or any other general class of persons from the civil service. What troubled the Court was that this particular exclusion "would violate the Equal Protection Clause if adopted by a State."359 This was not the minimum rationality aspect of equal pro- tection, which it shares with due process, but the heightened scrutiny that applies when a suspect classification is involved. The Court may well want to read this aspect of equal protection doctrine into the fifth amendment, but it cannot fairly characterize its reading as procedural due process. Nondiscrimination against aliens is a limit on the state's general actions, not one related to its methods for making factual or legal determinations about individuals. O'Bannon v.

The opinion uses both procedural and substantive due process discourse, as Justice Rehnquist pointed out in his dissent, id at 119-20 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting), so that its actual basis is somewhat uncertain. Procedural language seems to predominate, however. 358. Id at 102 (citing Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 573-74 (1972)). Justice Stevens continued: "By reason of the Fifth Amendment, such a deprivation must be accompanied by due process. It follows that some judicial scrutiny of the deprivation is mandated by the Constitu- tion." Id at 103. The Court may have meant that since no procedural due process protection was provided, a substantive due process analysis of the program was required. 359. Id at 103.

Justice Stevens held that decertification was only the indirect cause of the residents' transfer, and thus not a depri- vation of life, liberty, or property.36' But the usual legal test by which people are held responsible for the results of their action is foreseeabil- ity, not directness,362 and the transfers were certainly foreseeable. The better reason for not applying the due process clause to decertification is that decertifying the center had only a general effect upon the resi- dents, as opposed to its specific effect upon the center's owner (which was not at issue), or as opposed to an action transferring specified indi- viduals.363 Indeed, it was probably this notion that Justice Stevens tried to capture with his reference to the indirectness of the governmen- tal action.364 Curiously, however, Justice Stevens is also the author of a passage that not only links the general-specific distinction to due process con- siderations, but that also comes very close to using it as the Court's long-sought limitation on the scope of procedural due process. Dis- senting in Hewitt v. Helms,365 he wrote: Ordinarily the mere fact that the existence of a general regulation may significantly impair individual liberty raises no question under the Due Process Clause. But the Clause is implicated when the State sin- gles out one person for adverse treatment significantly different from that imposed on the community at large.366 That sounds like a major departure from his approach in Meachum, and a recognition of the relevance of his Texaco opinion to the admin- 361.

California, 444 U.S. 277 (1980) provides further evidence of this same confu- sion. In Martinez, the family of a woman murdered by a parolee sued the state officials who had granted the parole. Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice Stevens struggled with the question whether a state law providing absolute immunity for those officials violated due process. He con- ceded that immunity might have deprived the plaintiff of a property right in a tort cause of action, but found the state's interest in controlling its own tort law paramount to the interest of the plain- tiff. Martinez, 444 U.S. at 281-82. He also suggested that the property right had been created subject to the limits of the immunity defense. Id. at 282 n.5. All he needed to say, however, was that the immunity provision, being a general law, was not subject to procedural due process analy- sis. It is true, of course, that the parole decision involved the parolee in particular. But there was no particularized state action with respect to the plaintiff; the murderer could hardly be regarded as an agent of the state.

However, the very next sentence reads, "For an essential attribute of the liberty protected by the Constitution is the right to the same kind of treatment as the State provides to other similarly situated persons."367 Thus, Justice Stevens immediately de- moted the principle he articulated from a means of escaping the lib- erty-property debate to one additional argument to be invoked in continuing that debate. One can only marvel at the fascination which this dysfunctional concept has exercised over the post-Roth Court. Jus- tice Stevens in particular is deeply immersed in it. He seems incapable of perceiving that the right to fair treatment is best viewed, not as "an essential attribute of the liberty protected by the Constitution," but as an essential attribute of the due process that the Constitution guarantees.368 4. The Definitional DifIculties of the Specificity Concept Like every legal dichotomy, the general-specific distinction is not without its difficulties. First, there is the universal difficulty of fixing the boundary between the two parts of the dichotomy. Once that is achieved, there remains the possibility that general rulemaking can be equivalent to particularized adjudication in certain circumstances, most notably when a purportedly general rule applies to a very small number of individuals. There is also the possibility that certain types of general rules, although not equivalent to adjudication, can affect due process rights by altering the nature of all adjudications in a given area. In essence, the task is to establish a boundary between general and spe- cific action that is both sufficiently clear to be usable, and sufficiently fixed to withstand attempts at circumvention. a. Defining the Boundary The notion of general and specific action is fairly abstract. One way to fix the boundary between the two is to translate the distinction into operational terms. Professor Davis' dichotomy between legislative and adjudicative facts, now a fixture in administrative law, represents perhaps the leading effort to do so. Davis defines adjudicative facts as those that "answer the questions of who did what, where, when, how, why, with what motive or intent," and legislative facts as those that "do not usually concern the immediate parties but are the general facts which help the tribunal decide questions of law and policy and discre- 367.

First, it focuses on the nature of the facts, rather than the nature of the government action. While this does not create the same conceptual problems presented by focusing on individual interest, it does shift attention away from the modern view of rights as relation- ships, and toward the assessment of inherent characteristics. Second, this dichotomy has no real connection with the policy arguments for distinguishing general and specific action. Actions that affect a large group, which has full access to the political process, can be based on adjudicative facts, for example. Finally, Professor Davis' distinction provides little guidance in cases where the state claims the power to act in a purely discretionary manner, without reference to facts. A different operational principle can be generated by considering the nature of the government's action in reaching adjudicatory deci- sions. Such decisions generally involve two components: finding facts about an individual, and applying the law on the basis of those facts. In a true adjudication of the sort that we would generally want to sub- ject to due process requirements, the facts found must have direct and demonstrable consequences for the individual. Absent such conse- quences, the purpose underlying accurate decisionmaking disappears, since there can be no oppressiveness toward individuals when there are no particular consequences for them. Thus, no procedural protection is generally required when a person appears in a legislative hearing, even if a general statute is passed based on facts derived from that person's direct experience. The issue would arise only if the testimony had some adverse consequences for that person, as the loyalty-security hearings did.371 As another example, the most extensive factfinding ac- tivity of the federal government is the census, but since it has no direct effect on individuals, there is no due process right to insist on an accu- 369. 2 K.

Obviously, the adverse consequences must be specific to the person; they could not involve the person's profession, for example.</page><page sequence="82">1984] ADMINISTRATIVE DUE PROCESS 1125 rate assessment of oneself. On the other hand, a right to accuracy exists if the government is making factual assessments about an individual in order to grant benefits or impose burdens, or if the government action will have significant collateral consequences.372 The second aspect of adjudiction is the application of the law to a specified individual on the basis of the facts that have been found. Ac- cording to the rule-obedience principle, the law to be applied must be valid, and it must cover the case under consideration. Thus, due pro- cess requires that the individual have the opportunity to challenge the law on substantive grounds, although it does not provide any substan- tive grounds of its own force. In addition, it requires the opportunity to argue that the established facts do not justify the application of the legal consequences in question. General action, to which due process protection is not applicable, can now be operationally defined as action that neither makes factual determinations about a particular individual that have direct conse- quences for that individual, nor determines how the law is to be ap- plied to a particular individual. If these elements are present, however, the action is an adjudication and must be analyzed in due process terms. Many adjudications involve both these elements; in others, however, the facts will be stipulated or the validity and applicability of the law conceded, so that one element of adjudication will operate separately. b. A voiding Particularized Rulemaking This operational distinction between general and specific action may begin to break down as the group to which a general rule relates becomes increasingly small. At some point, such a rule effectively ap- plies the law to an individual, even if it purports to be achieving a more generalized effect. Once that point is reached, there is a danger that the action was motivated by a desire to punish that one individual. This possibility is unquestionably a real problem for procedural due process analysis. But the Court's underlying rights approach provides no solu- tion at all; it simply abandons the individual to the legislative will. Restating the scope of procedural due process in terms of the gen- eral-specific distinction suggests a possible solution to the problem. When the affected group is sufficiently small and the danger of im- 372. This consideration merges into the general concept of standing. People usually have no right to complain about factfinding regarding themselves, or anything else for that matter, unless it has some particularized effect on them. See, e.g., Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 508-10 (1975); Association of Data Processing Serv. Orgs. v. Camp, 397 U.S. 150 (1970); Flast v.

One limit is that the state may not engage in subterfuges to cir- cumvent constitutional rights. For example, a regulation denying an exemption from securities filing requirements to companies that are in reorganization proceedings may involve an acceptably large group at a time of economic stress, but may be equivalent to specification when reorganizations are rare.373 Courts should be capable of seeing through such "individual action . . . masquerading as a general rule."374 Among the indicia they can use are the facts that one person, or a very small number of people, actually fall within the affected group; that the rulemaker had or should have had sufficient information to realize this; and that the terms of the law are facially arbitrary.37" Another limit, more widely applicable but obviously more debata- ble, would be that any general action directed against a sufficiently small number of individuals must be justified by a demonstration that it is consistent with some broader pattern of administrative decision- making. A requirement of this sort would generally differ from the adjudicatory requirements of notice and a hearing. Most likely, it would consist of a general plan or designation of a hierarchical deci- sionmaking structure. This would reduce the danger of individual op- pression, in accord with the primary policy underlying due process. The problem is that the essence of the general-specific distinction is to impose due process standards on adjudications, not on rulemak- ing. But the suggested limit need not be seen as substantive due pro- cess. Rather, it emanates from, and is designed to protect, procedural due process rights. In effect, it would impose the requirement of regu- 373. Cf Philadelphia Co. v. SEC, 175 F.2d 808 (D.C.

But the court was careful to state that the CAB "has declared new ground rules available to the air carrying industry . . even though the occasion was the application of one company for pickup and delivery tariffs." Id. at 142-43. Perhaps more important, the party singled out was benefited, and particularized benefits can be conferred on individuals without violating due process. The plaintiffs in the suit were the applicant's competitors, and they were affected generally, not specifically, by the CAB's new rule. 374. American Airlines v. CAB, 359 F.2d 624, 631 (D.C. Cir.)

Presumptions and Procedural Fairness The general-specific distinction also breaks down when rulemak- ing alters the nature of adjudications subject to the rulemaking author- ity. This alteration can occur directly. In Goldberg v. Kelly,377 for example, the government had adopted general rules that granted a sub- sequent hearing but denied a prior one.37 A more subtle approach is to establish a factual presumption, as a matter of general law, essen- tially short-circuiting the factfinding stage of the adjudication process. Both types of actions take advantage of the government's control of the substantive law to achieve procedural effects. The first operates against the form of the adjudication, while the second operates against its un- derlying content. These cases cannot be resolved by refining the general-specific dis- tinction, or on any other definitional basis. The answer necessarily rests on the independent determination of what procedural fairness means: the content of the principle of rule obedience and, more signifi- cantly, the extent of minimum procedures. Once this determination is made, due process can be treated like any other constitutional right. A general rule that reduces procedural protection below the established minimum is invalid, just as a general rule that prohibits protected speech would be. Both answers are totally unsatisfying because they leave open the only important question: what is the required minimum of procedural protection, or what is protected speech? But that is pre- cisely the point: the problem posed by general rules governing adjudi- cation is to give content to our notion of procedural fairness. No particular difficulty is created because the primary focus of the guaran- tee involved is specific governmental action as opposed to some other 376. This is hardly an unprecedented technique. The first amendment is generally thought to require regular decisionmaking when free speech is threatened. See, e.g., Shuttlesworth v. City of Birmingham, 394 U.S. 147, 152-59 (1969); Freedman v. Maryland, 380 U.S. 51, 57-61 (1965); cf. Monaghan, First Amendment "Due Process" 83 HARV. L. REV. 518 (1970) (regular decisionmak- ing required by Court when free speech rights are affected). A general plan or regular decision- making is also required in administrative inspection cases to satisfy the fourth amendment's probable cause requirement. See, e.g., Donovan v. Dewey, 452 U.S. 594 (1981); Marshall v. Bar- low's, Inc., 436 U.S. 307 (1978); United States v. Biswell, 406 U.S. 311 (1972); cf FTC v. Texaco, Inc., 555 F.2d 862 (D.C. Cir.) (administrative subpoena), cert. denied, 431 U.S. 974 (1977). The fourth amendment example is particularly relevant because the purpose is exactly the same: to protect against the risks associated with action against specific individuals in cases where the state purports to be acting on a nonspecific basis. 377. 397 U.S. 254 (1970). 378. See supra text accompanying notes 86, 99.</page><page sequence="85">1128 CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 72:1044 area of law. Whatever due process governs, it shares with all other constitutional rights the power to invalidate governmental acts of any kind that conflict with the protections it provides. While this principle does not seem difficult, its application can be complex, particularly when presumptions are concerned. A rule that alters procedural protections is obviously subject to due process scru- tiny, but one that creates presumptions may be less distinguishable from general substantive enactments. In the early 1970's, a majority of the Supreme Court thought that any legislative use of presumptions, at least in their irrebuttable form, was unconstitutional.379 This approach was abandoned because it proved difficult to distinguish presumptions from categorizations, and invalidating categorization would have been tantamount to declaring that the passage of laws violated the Constitution.380 Cleveland Board of Education v. LaFleur38' provides an example of the irrebuttable presumption doctrine. There, the Court struck down an administrative regulation that required pregnant schoolteach- ers to take maternity leave in the fifth month of pregnancy. Justice Stewart's opinion for the Court conceded that the school could require maternity leave for physically unfit teachers,382 but held that schools could not irrebuttably presume that a teacher in her fifth month was unfit. The due process clause required that the school make a specific factual determination of fitness. The problem with the Court's analysis is that it would also prohibit a school from presuming that a teacher without a college degree was untrained. What LaFleur must mean, un- less it is simply incorrect, is that the pregnant teachers have an in- dependent constitutional right not to be dismissed for being pregnant,383 but that the state may overcome that right by making a factual showing that a particular teacher's pregnancy has rendered her physically unfit.384 379. See, e.g., Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. LaFleur, 414 U.S. 632 (1974); United States Dep't of Agriculture v. Murry, 413 U.S. 508 (1973); Vlandis v. Kline, 412 U.S. 441 (1973); Stanley v. Illi- nois, 405 U.S. 645 (1972). 380. See Weinberger v. Salfi, 422 U.S. 749 (1975). The irrebuttable presumptions doctrine was heavily criticized by commentators. See Mashaw, supra note 4, at 896-98; Note, The Irrebut- table Presumption Doctrine in the Supreme Court, 87 HARV. L. REV. 1534 (1974); Note, Irrebuttable Presumptions. An Illusory Analysis, 27 STAN. L. REV. 449 (1975). 381. 414 U.S. 632 (1974). 382. Id at 643-44. 383. Presumably this right would be found in the equal protection clause. See, e.g., Arizona Governing Comm. v. Norris, 103 S. Ct. 3492 (1983) (invalidating state pension plan which pays women lower benefits than men when both have made equal contributions); Weinberger v. Wie- senfeld, 420 U.S. 636 (1975) (invalidating law requiring wives, but not husbands, to prove spouse's dependency). LaFleur does not articulate this rationale, however. 384. See Bell v. Burson, 402 U.S. 535 (1971), which declares itself to be a procedural due process case, and is sometimes treated as such, see Monaghan, supra note 4, at 407-08, but which is</page><page sequence="86">1984] ADMINISTR4 TIVE DUE PROCESS 1129 The flaw in Justice Stewart's analysis in LaFleur is that he over- looked the need to find an independent basis for the right involved before due process protection would be appropriate.385 This is exactly the opposite of Roth, where he insisted on an independent legal interest when existing doctrine did not require one. It appears that Justice Stewart simply reversed the usual notion about general and specific governmental action. In LaFleur he assumed that the due process clause had some established, intrinsic relevance to rulemaking so that no independent right was required, while in Roth he assumed that it had no such relevance to adjudication, thus requiring an independent right in such cases.386 Rejecting Justice Stewart's view that irrebuttable presumptions are inherently problematic does not mean that presumptions can confer more power on the government than it would otherwise have. Rather, use of a presumption simply has no effect on the validity of the under- lying action. If the state may constitutionally dismiss all teachers who are five months pregnant, it may do so by presuming them to be physi- cally unfit, since there are probably no constitutional constraints on the format or wording of legislation. If it may not dismiss such teachers directly, it may not do so by creating the presumption. Certainly, if the regulation had declared that all black teachers were physically unfit, the Court would have experienced little difficulty in looking through the presumption and invalidating the regulation. Presumptions that infringe upon procedural due process rights can be treated in precisely the same way. If a procedural due process pro- tection applies, the state may not presume it away. If such protection does not apply, the state may presume whatever it wishes, at least as far really another example of the irrebuttable presumptions approach. There, the Court invalidated a law suspending the registration and driver's license of uninsured motorists involved in accidents unless they posted security to cover the damages claimed against them. The Court's problem with the statute was that "not all motorists, but rather only motorists involved in accidents, are required to post security under penalty of loss of the license," Bell, 402 U.S. at 539, and that there was no consideration of "whether there is a reasonable possibility of judgments in the amounts claimed being rendered against the licensee," id. at 540. In essence, the case holds that the state may not presume that the claim is a colorable one, at least if it applies the presumption to motorists in- volved in accidents. Since such motorists are a general group, the decision is substantive due process to the extent that it relies on the due process clause at all. 385. Justice Stewart was also the author of Vlandis v. Kline, 412 U.S. 441 (1973), another leading irrebuttable presumption decision. 386. Justice Rehnquist was more consistent, steadfastly refusing to grant relief in either rulemaking or adjudication cases. In his opinion for the Court in Weinberger v. Salfi, 422 U.S. 749, 772-73 (1975), he observed "the very section . . . which authorizes an action such as this" also places various limits on it, all of which could be regarded as irrebuttable presumptions. This sounds much like his Arnett v. Kennedy opinion, which was the product of the same Term. See supra notes 135-41 and accompanying text. Salf is more persuasive because general conditions in a general law are truly indistinguishable from the law itself, while conditions that affect individual adjudications of rights under that law strike at the heart of procedural due process.</page><page sequence="87">1130 CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 72:1044 as the procedural component of the due process clause is concerned. This is established doctrine from a number of pre-1970's cases, where the Court invalidated presumptions by holding that they were so irra- tional that they operated solely to eliminate procedural protection.387 As with rules affecting small groups of people, close questions will arise. But the Court's current approach results in greater confusion in other areas of procedural due process doctrine, without providing any compensatory illumination for the question of presumptions. The real answer to the presumption problem necessarily depends upon the way in which procedural fairness is defined. At the present level of generality, two observations may be made. First, if the facts from which the conclusion is presumed are procedural facts-facts which result from the state's interaction with a specified individual-the result is a complete elimination of due process protec- tion. For example, if the school board presumes that any teacher who receives a pink slip from the principal is physically unfit, there are clearly no constraints on the principal's behavior, not even obedience to applicable rules. Such a presumption is valid only if the situation is one where no procedural protection is required. Second, if general facts are presumed, the state must actually act on that presumption. The presumption is simply a roundabout way of stating a general law, and all noncriminal laws are procedurally valid, assuming that they do not prescribe procedures. But the presumption cannot declare a particular rule and then give state agents the unfet- tered power to find that rule inapplicable to particular individuals. That reestablishes the arbitrary power that due process is intended to forbid; in essence, it is nothing more than an effort to circumvent the requirements of the clause. Viewed from this perspective, it is the re- buttable presumption, not the irrebuttable one, that creates due process difficulties. The legislature, because it is either clever or perverse, may validly declare that snowmobiles may only be driven by careful people, and then irrebuttably presume that everyone is careful. But if it wishes to make the presumption rebuttable, it must provide a procedure for establishing carelessness that comports with due process requirements. To leave that determination to the sole discretion of an administrator would improperly circumvent the procedural requirements for such a finding. 387. See, e.g., Leary v. United States, 395 U.S. 6, 32-54 (1969) (invalidating presumption that possession of marijuana indicates knowledge that it was imported illegally); Tot v. United States, 319 U.S. 463 (1943) (invalidating presumption that person previously convicted of violent crime who possessed firearm had received it in interstate or foreign commerce); cf McFarland v. Ameri- can Sugar Ref. Co., 241 U.S. 79, 86 (1916) (Holmes, J.) ("[I]t is not within the province of a legislature to declare an individual guilty or presumptively guilty of a crime.").</page><page sequence="88">1984] ADMINISTRATIVE DUE PROCESS 1131 III THE EXTENT OF DUE PROCESS PROTECTION IN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW All of these considerations bring us to what is--or at least should be-the starting point of procedural due process analysis. A claim of procedural unfairness represents the central element in a federal due process cause of action. This claim relates primarily to the manner in which the government carries out adjudications, adjudications being defined as actions taken with respect to specified individuals. In that context, procedural fairness consists of two basic principles: govern- ment must follow applicable rules, and it must provide minimum pro- cedures in various situations. The content of these principles will determine the scope of permissible governmental action in adjudica- tions. In addition, it will necessarily place certain limits on general ac- tion, where such action resembles or affects the adjudicative process. The Supreme Court's concern about liberty, property, and individ- ual interest is irrelevant at this preliminary stage of the analysis. It serves only to confuse the nature of procedural due process as that con- cept is generally understood. This does not mean that the Court's effort to impose limits on the extent to which administrators are subject to due process constraints is necessarily wrong. Whether it is right or wrong is a policy question and constitutes the essence of the contempo- rary debate about due process guarantees. The point is that this debate should occur within the framework of the analytic considerations dis- cussed in the previous Part; it should be devoted to determining the content of the two principles of procedural fairness-rule obedience and minimum procedures. All of the real issues that the Court raised can be fully debated and assessed as part of that determination. This Part of the Article clarifies the terms of that debate, and suggests an alternative to the Court's present position. A. The Rule- Obedience and Minimum-Procedures Principles L Beyond the Supreme Court's "Needless Formality" and "Process Due" Criteria a. Rule Obedience Of the two principles of procedural fairness, the rule-obedience principle is by far the easier to define. There may be a statutory inter- pretation problem as to whether a particular pronouncement is prop- erly understood to be a rule, as opposed to a precatory statement,388 but 388. See Hewitt v. Helms, 459 U.S. 460, 471-72 (1983); Schweiker v. Hansen, 450 U.S. 785 (1981) (per curiam). In Hansen, the Court held that a government agent was not obligated to follow the rule in an internal manual governing interview procedure. The Court's rationale was</page><page sequence="89">1132 CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 72:1044 this is a matter within the government's power to determine. In this context, therefore, the Court's approach is entirely correct, subject to the understanding that rule obedience is itself a federal principle. If the government adopts a general rule, it is bound by that rule in particular adjudications.389 If it has not adopted a rule, it is bound only by the minimum procedures imposed by the other procedural fairness principle. The most significant question that has been raised about the con- tent of the rule-obedience principle emerged in Olim v. Wakinekona,390 the interstate prison transfer case.39' Justice Blackmun's opinion held that Hawaii had created "no liberty interest entitled to protection under the Due Process Clause"392 because the state had not placed any "sub- stantive limitations" on the prison administrator's discretion.393 This seems accurate enough as far as the rule-obedience principle is con- cerned, since there would be no rules to follow.394 But Hawaii had established a binding rule requiring that certain procedures be followed by the prison administrator's subordinates in the first stage of the trans- fer process, and these procedures were apparently violated in Wakinekona's case.395 This was unimportant to Justice Blackmun, however, because the rule was strictly procedural. "Process is not an end in itself," he wrote, "[i]ts constitutional purpose is to protect a sub- stantive interest to which the individual has a legitimate claim of enti- tlement."396 In other words, when a constitutionally protected liberty or property interest is not present, the government may disobey its own procedural rules in individual adjudications. The logic of this is diffi- cult to fathom. After all, Roth's definition of "substantive rights" in- cludes any rights created by state law.397 Even under the state-standard approach, a right that has been definitively created by the state would that the manual "is not a regulation. It has no legal force, and it does not bind the [agency]." Id. at 789. 389. See, e.g., Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co., 455 U.S. 422 (1982); Vitarelli v. Seaton, 359 U.S. 535 (1959); Service v.

Of course, there remains the question whether minimum procedures are required for interstate prison transfers. Justice Marshall's dissent argued that minimum procedures were in fact required for two reasons: first, the due process clause itself creates a liberty interest affected by qualitative change in confinement conditions; and second, the administrative rules created such an interest. Id. at 1748-52 (Marshall, J., dissenting). 395. So the Court of Appeals concluded, at any rate. See 664 F.2d 708, 709 (9th Cir. 1981), rev'd, 103 S. Ct. 1741 (1983). 396. Wakinekona, 103 S.

As Professor Smolla points out in his critique of Wakinekona, "the procedural entitlements are the pos- itive law of the state."398 But Justice Blackmun has now declared that certain rights can never qualify as liberty or property, because they are purely procedural in nature-not "procedural" because they are im- posed by the due process clause, but procedural because they are state- created rights that relate to the adjudication process.399 That purely procedural rights are specifically disfavored in due process analysis is a somewhat peculiar conclusion to derive from a constitutional provision that provides federal protection for the fairness of state adjudications. The due process clause is premised on the idea that there is something special about procedure, something worthy of explicit constitutional protection. That may suggest that procedure is more important than substance, or it may not-but it certainly does not suggest that procedure is less important. If a state chooses to create procedural rights, they should be at least as extensively protected by the due process clause as state-created substantive rights. Justice Blackmun's opinion does suggest one reason why proce- dural rights might be disfavored, although he does not relate it to the general concept of due process protection. By themselves, he observes, these rights would be a "'needless formality,' "400 which presumably means that they could not affect the outcome. But if Wakinekona had been given the opportunity to be heard by an impartial decisionmaker, the outcome might indeed have been different. He was suing for pre- cisely this opportunity to affect the outcome, an opportunity granted to him by state law.401 Many due process suits ask for nothing more than such an opportunity, and to interpret them differently is to make the error of the Paul v. Davis402 and Parratt v. Taylor403 decisions.4'4 The 398. Smolla, supra note 61, at 502. 399. See also Board of Curators v.

But that is very different from saying that the opportunity to present one's case can have no possible effect on the outcome, or that the procedures are a "needless formality."405 Had the Court focused on the relationship between procedural due process and adjudications it might have come to a different conclusion. This relationship suggests that the due process clause is designed to ensure that the state will act fairly when it deals with particular individ- uals. To deny one person the benefit of a right, whether substantive or procedural, that has been conferred upon the populace-at-large is the very essence of unfairness. It places in a state administrator's hands the power to oppress, to single out and to punish for unacceptable reasons. The rule-obedience principle protects against this possibility. It seems odd, albeit characteristic, for the Court to read this principle out of the due process clause by declaring that the clause protects only liberty interests, and that state procedural rules do not create such an interest. Liberty may mean many different things, but due process must mean that the state is obligated to follow applicable rules. Most of the other questions that have arisen with respect to the rule-obedience principle can be resolved by recognizing that the harm- less error doctrine applies to this principle, as it applies to most other procedural rules. For example, an irregularity in the process by which a hearing examiner was appointed has been held not to invalidate the examiner's decision. Though the agency failed to follow its own rules, the individual was not denied anything as a result.406 list. Rather, he wanted the Court to require that the police give him a hearing in which he would have the opportunity to prove that his name did not belong there.

Black Ball Freight Serv., 397 U.S. 532, 538-39 (1970) (hold- ing that failure to follow rules did not render action invalid because rules in question were not "intended primarily to confer important procedural benefits upon individuals"). The rules in question required that certain information be included in ICC applications for the purpose of information gathering and internal decisionmaking. In effect, these rules did not involve adjudi- cation at all, so they fall outside of the due process clause's operation. But Justice Douglas' opin- ion is relatively clear that rules conferring procedural benefits on individuals, with or without an underlying substantive right, must be followed. Wakinekona did not cite American Farm Lines. 406. United States v. Tucker Truck Lines, 344 U.S. 33, 35-36 (1952); see also Market St. Ry. v.

In United States v. Caceres,407 for example, an Internal Revenue agent recorded a number of conversations with Caceres, thereby violat- ing the agency's internal rules governing the authorization of such re- cordings. After establishing that the recordings did not violate the Constitution and that they would have been authorized if the proper procedure had been followed, the Court held that these recordings should not be excluded as evidence in the criminal prosecution of Ca- ceres.408 Caceres would have been prejudiced if the recordings had been the sort that would not have been authorized or if he had some- how relied on the IRS rule.409 As it was, he was "prejudiced" only by the Court's refusal to exclude the recordings, which is hardly the same thing. The decision is thus explicable in harmless error terms. It ap- plies only to an agency's internal rules, whose violation had no actual effect upon the way the individual was treated. Caceres, however, does contain some broader language that can be viewed as an adumbration of Wakinekona.410 Other ominous language can be found in Davis v. Scherer,41 decided this past Term. There, the Court held that violation of applicable state laws or regulations does not by itself make the state agent's behavior sufficiently unreasonable to defeat the qualified immunity defense. This does not necessarily suggest that such a violation is constitutionally acceptable; the doctrine of official immunity is designed to shield certain state agents who have in fact violated constitutional provisions.412 But the Court did declare that "[a]ppellee makes no claim that the appellants' violation of the behavior); Ward v. Village of Monroeville, 409 U.S. 57 (1972) (mayor whose budget is derived from traffic fines may not preside in traffic court); Tumey v. Ohio, 273 U.S. 510, 522 (1927) (mayor whose salary is derived from fees levied against traffic violators cannot preside in traffic court). 407. 440 U.S. 741 (1979). 408. It is significant that Justice Stevens' opinion for the Court limited the holding to its exclusionary rule context. Id. at 754-57. He emphasized that the purpose of the exclusionary rule was deterrence. The "[e]xecutive itself has provided for internal sanctions in cases of knowing violations." Id. at 756. He also emphasized the good faith of the IRS, see id. at 752, 757, a consideration that is presumably irrelevant outside of the exclusionary rule context. Indeed, the entire decision can be read as part of the Burger Court's general distaste for the exclusionary rule. See, e.g., Stone v. Powell, 428 U.S. 465 (1976); United States v. Calandra, 414 U.S. 338 (1974). 409. Caceres, 440 U.S. at 752-55. 410. Id. at 754 n. 18, 755. This implication is made somewhat more definite by the language of Justice Marshall's dissent, which states its disagreement by declaring the principle that obedi- ence to rules is an aspect of due process.

But there is something in the tone of Justice Powell's opinion that is disconcerting: can there really be a question that the violation of a substantive regulation is actionable under section 1983? Suppose the state in Roth had conceded that a professor could be fired only for cause, but responded to the federal due process suit by claiming that it had chosen not to follow this statute or regulation in his particular case. One can characterize this as a violation of either due process or equal protection, but it seems difficult to maintain that no constitutional violation has occurred.414 b. Minimum Procedures The second element of procedural due process, minimum proce- dures, is more complex. In fact, most procedural due process cases are properly understood as efforts to define the content of this principle. The Court's effort to do so is typically phrased in terms of "what pro- cess is due."415 In other words, once the Court has decided that the due process clause applies, it then turns to the content of the required pro- cedural protection. In administrative cases, the conceptual framework of the Court's current approach was established by Mathews v. Eldridge,416 which 413. Davis, 104 S. Ct. at 3019 (footnote omitted). 414. Other more ominous language can be found in Pennhurst State School &amp; Hosp. v. Hald- erman, 104 S. Ct. 900 (1984), where the Court declared that "a federal suit against state officials on the basis of state law contravenes the Eleventh Amendment where . . the relief sought . . has an important impact directly on the State itself." Id at 917. But the case was presented and analyzed entirely as a state law claim that reached the federal courts through pendent jurisdiction. Constitutional questions were held in abeyance as a matter of judicial restraint. Thus, the Court did not consider the idea that a state agent's violation of state law is itself a violation of the due process clause. That claim, although based on obedience to state law, is purely federal and lies outside the Pennhurst rule. Federal jurisdiction would continue to be available under the doctrine of Exparte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908), reaffirmedin Pennhurst, 104 S. Ct. at 909, which holds that an unconstitutional action is necessarily that of errant state officials rather than of the state itself. To be sure, the Court suggested that the doctrine should be restrictively applied, Pennhurst, 104 S. Ct. at 909, 911, but the restrictions would be no more applicable to procedural due process than they would be to any other constitutional provision. Even if they were, an 1 Ith amendment argu- ment goes only to the jurisdiction of the federal courts, not to the constitutional status of the cause of action.

The Court held that an assessment based on written submissions satisfied the due process clause, and that an oral hearing was not required. In reaching this determination, the Court identified "three distinct factors" that determine the minimum proce- dures required by the due process clause: [F]irst, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government's inter- est, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.417 The Mathews approach is certainly a heroic one. Although Justice Powell stated that the three factors had been dictated by the Court's "prior decisions,"418 they were largely new to due process adjudication. Like Roth, Mathews starts from first principles and attempts to con- struct an entire doctrine by means of logical analysis. And like Roth, its ambitions are rivaled only by its difficulties. Its premises are debat- able; its methodologies are impractical; and each of its three factors is of questionable relevance.419 The basic premise of Mathews is that there should be a separate theory for defining minimum procedures in administrative adjudica- tions. The Court has never suggested that the Mathews framework be used for determining due process requirements in traditional common law or other nonadministrative cases. In fact, the effort to do so would produce major dislocations in existing doctrine, since it would be very difficult to derive the components of criminal or civil trials from that framework. But there is no obvious reason why the administrative and 417. Id at 334-35. 418. Id In Goss v. Lopez, 419 U.S. 565 (1965), decided the previous Term, the Court used a more intuitive approach, adjusting the level of protection to its general sense of the competing demands for fairness and government efficiency. Id at 577-84; see also Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 485-89 (1972). Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254 (1970), also used this approach, but it relied more directly on the requirements in previous due process cases as a model for the requisite procedures. Id. at 266-71. 419. The Court seems to recognize this, given the frequency with which it has looked past the cumbersome Mathews apparatus and confronted the real issues involved in determining the con- tent of the minimum-procedures principle. See, e.g., Hewitt v. Helms, 459 U.S. 460, 473-76 (1983); Greenholtz v. Inmates of the Neb. Penal &amp; Correctional Complex, 442 U.S. 1, 13-16 (1979); Mem- phis Light, Gas &amp; Water Div. v. Craft, 436 U.S. 1, 17-18 (1978); Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U.S. 651, 675-76 (1977). In each of these decisions, the Court skipped from either a citation to Mathews or a citation followed by a recitation of the individual interest, administrative burdens, and risk of error involved, to a generalized discussion of the sort of procedures that seemed necesssary in each case, often relying on analogies to other cases. In fact, this is almost inevitable since the Mathews test cannot generate particular procedural devices. See infra notes 420-39 and accompanying text.</page><page sequence="95">1138 CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 72:1044 the nonadministrative realms should be treated so differently. The for- mer presents unique problems to be sure, so that any doctrine derived from common law would need to be extensively adapted. But aban- doning one's only source of precedent seems like an extreme approach. In any event such a decision should be made after careful considera- tion, and not by tacit assumption as the Mathews opinion does. Even if one accepts the Court's idea that administrative due pro- cess demands an entirely new methodology for defining minimum pro- cedures, the Mathews framework presents considerable difficulties. Establishing three distinct factors, two of which operate in opposition to each other, seems impressive, but it is unclear how to resolve the inevitable conflicts between them. The Court's frequent answer is to "balance" or "weigh" the various factors. This reliance upon "weight," which is a useful approach for dealing with bananas, leaves something to be desired where factors such as those in Mathews are concerned. The economist's solution would be cost-benefit analysis, but the task of assigning monetary values to these factors is not a promising one, and the Court has not had the temerity to attempt it. Related to the difficulty with balancing is the difficulty with a con- tinuously varying range of procedural protections. A continuum is generally constructed from a large number of precisely defined, incre- mentally different values. But the balancing process proposed by Mathews cannot really generate such a set of values. First, it is unlikely that a one-to-one relationship can be established between each value in the Mathews balance and a particular level of procedural protection. The same balance might lead to a requirement of cross-examination in one situation and a requirement that counsel be permitted in another. Even if that problem were solved, it would still be unclear whether the two requirements could be placed in strict ordinal succession. Gross orderings, as between a criminal trial and a school suspension hearing, are relatively easy, but the task becomes quite challenging when minor variations in essentially distinct requirements are involved. The impracticality of Mathews methodology alone is enough to cast considerable doubt on the value of its three criteria. But apart from this, the criteria themselves focus on subsidiary issues rather than the essence of the due process guarantee. The most notable of the criteria is the individual interest stan- dard-the very same consideration that serves as a precondition for applicability of the clause under current doctrine. There is no logical inconsistency, to be sure, in using this consideration once to decide whether due process applies, and again to decide how much process is due. But as a practical rule of constitutional decisionmaking, the dupli-</page><page sequence="96">1984] ADMINISTRATIVE DUE PROCESS 1139 cation is awkward. To the extent that individual interest is really used at this "process due" stage, it seems otiose at the applicability level. Even in the more modest role that Mathews assigns to it, individ- ual interest does not seem particularly relevant. There is a surface plausibility about the notion that the degree of process due should vary with the level of impact on the individual, but that notion is not really part of our procedural due process tradition. Indeed, a persuasive case can be made for an exactly opposite view: that whenever the govern- ment acts against an individual, it must act fairly. The purpose of the due process clause is to establish a uniform standard of fair adjudica- tion, not to create a market in which degrees of fairness can be ex- changed for levels of injury. In nonadministrative cases, procedural requirements are generally based on the nature of the adjudication in question, and they tend to be relatively insensitive to the magnitude of the individual interest at stake.420 Criminal procedure is essentially the same for any prosecu- tion, whether petty larceny or murder is involved. Civil procedure is similarly constant regardless of the number of zeros that appear in plaintiffs claim. To be sure, there are variations at the extremities. Small-claims cases dispense with many procedures that would other- wise be required,421 misdemeanors may be tried without a jury,422 and specialized protections are often required in capital cases.423 Nonethe- less, the basic principle is that the level of procedural protection is con- stant over the entire range represented by each major type of common law adjudication. Individual interest does play a role in common law procedure, however: it may determine the time at which required protections 420. As a practical matter, of course, judges will treat civil cases where $10 million is at stake differently from cases where $10,000 is at stake. These differences are a question of judicial man- agement, however, not due process theory. For better or worse, we have no theory in civil law by which required procedures can be varied according to the size of the claim. This does not pre- clude the creation of such a theory in the administrative realm. But the presumptions against this theory are, first, that it is discontinuous with the civil trial model; and second, that it has no judicial antecedent to rely on. 421. See, e.g., CAL. CIV. PROC.

But this may take a long time, and there is frequently a danger that intervening action by one party will alter the subject matter of the lawsuit in some irremediable way. To protect the court's power to grant meaningful relief at the end of the adjudication process, civil law establishes various pretrial reme- dies, such as preliminary injunction, attachment, garnishment, and re- plevy.424 The question then arises whether the individual is entitled to procedural protection before the state employs any of these pretrial de- vices, or whether the state may act first and provide procedural protec- tion only for the final resolution of the issue. In answering this question, the law generally looks to the individ- ual's interest. This consideration is appropriate because the issue is not the basic fairness of an adjudication, but the practical burden that will be imposed by attempts to preserve the status quo. If the burden is overwhelming, a pretrial remedy will be denied. If the burden does not exceed acceptable levels, the court will take precautions against irreme- diable change in the subject matter of the suit.425 In either case there is no question that a civil trial, fully comporting with due process, is re- quired for the final determination. Due process requirements thus re- main constant. All that varies with the individual's interest is the 424. See, e.g., C.

This was precisely the manner in which the individual interest no- tion was first used as a decisive factor in the constitutional doctrine of procedural due process. Indeed, the cases that first referred to it in- volved the specific issue of common law pretrial remedies.426 The com- mon law generally assumes that a person can be made whole for any temporary loss of money.427 This is why the common law's position on prejudgment remedies against potentially judgment-proof defendants is that the risk of irreparable change is great, while the burden on the defendant is insignificant. The consumer rights movement of the 1960's challenged this view, pointing out the dislocation, stigma, and privation that could result from the use of prejudgment remedies against individuals without suffi- cient legal or material resources.428 In Sniadach v. Family Finance Corp.,429 the Supreme Court adopted the consumer rights perspective. It held that wage garnishment imposed an enormous burden on a working person, and thus could not be utilized as a pretrial device to secure a creditor's potential recovery until procedural protection was provided.430 Goldberg v. Kelly431 presented a fact situation similar to Sniadach. Termination of welfare benefits has the potential for imposing severe hardship on the recipients until their eligibility is finally determined.432 It was therefore natural for the Court to employ an individual interest 426. See Fuentes v. Shevin, 407 U.S. 67 (1972); Sniadach v. Family Fin. Corp., 395 U.S. 337 (1969). 427. Common law compensation for breach of contract is based on two general principles: first, that "the primary if not the only remedy of the injured party is an action for damages"; and second, that "the general purposes of the law is ... to give compensation, that is, to put plaintiff in as good a position as he would have been in had the defendant kept his contract." 11 S.

These principles imply that money damages can in fact fully compensate the victim of the breach under ordinary circumstances. 428. See D. CAPLOWITZ, supra note 105, at 116-36, 155-691; W.

Goldberg represents an important extension of Sniadach, because Goldberg is an administrative case. The issue of prior hearings, and thus of the individual's interest, will arise much more frequently in these cases than it does at common law, since government administra- tors often act unilaterally to alter an individual's status. Nonetheless, even Goldberg restricts individual interest to its common law role of determining the timing of a required hearing. Mathews itself exemplifies the use of individual interest to deter- mine the timing of the hearing, since it was also a prior hearing case. By the time Mathews was decided, however, individual interest had come to dominate the Court's due process analysis. This may explain Justice Powell's promotion of individual interest from a consideration affecting the timing of due process protection to a basic factor deter- mining the content of the protection that is required. In doing so, how- ever, he mistook the specific issue in the case for a general principle of due process interpretation. Mathews' risk of error factor presents a related issue. Since risk of error is akin to accuracy, it would appear to be a central consideration for any theory of due process based on accurate decisionmaking. Mathews does not rely on the simple existence of a risk of error, how- ever, but on the computation of differential error rates for different levels of procedural protection. Such a computation, if usable at all, would appear to be as subsidiary as the individual interest factor. "Traditional" due process makes no such computation. It assumes that a serious risk of error is present, and then employs a range of trial- based procedures to protect against it. The more extensive protection of the criminal trial is not based on the idea that errors are more likely, but on the idea that they would be more serious. In administrative due process, this traditional approach seems the most feasible. Since considerations of accuracy stand behind all the protections due process requires, at least in the Supreme Court's view, they seem like the wrong tool to use for making qualitative distinctions among those protections. A better use for "accuracy" would be to fine- tune the protections that have been designed on the basis of some other factor. Even fine-tuning would require that we set acceptable error levels, arrange procedural devices on an error-prevention scale, and then match the two. Perhaps this could all be avoided by an intuitive judgment. At the very least, however, we would need to determine dif- ferential error rates for different situations, which the courts do not ap- pear able to do at the present time. Indeed, one of the principal arguments for relying on minimum procedures to implement the value of accurate decisionmaking is that it does not require determination of</page><page sequence="100">1984] ADMINISTRATIVE DUE PROCESS 1143 acceptable accuracy levels.433 In any event, if there is an administrative case with special features that suggest the traditional approach should be abandoned in favor of the risk-of-error factor, Mathews is not that case. Mathews concluded that disability determinations, based largely on technical data submit- ted by health professionals, could be made on a written record without oral argument.434 But courts regularly grant summary judgment in cases that depend exclusively on documentary evidence.435 The Mathews Court could thus have argued that this procedure was accept- ably accurate simply by analogy to nonadministrative law.436 There was no need to expand this specific principle into a general determinant of the due process guarantee. The final factor in Mathews is "the Government's interest, includ- ing the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens."437 Mathews placed its emphasis on the issue of burden. This is hardly insignificant, but once again, it seems like a subsidiary issue. Proce- dure always has its costs; it is difficult to think of a procedural device that imposes greater fiscal and administrative burdens than a criminal trial. Unless cost is to operate as a purely negative principle, the bal- ance should include some countervailing notion of benefit. But benefit cannot be computed in monetary terms because it depends upon our view of procedural fairness, precisely the point at issue. Stated another way, cost operates as a pragmatic constraint; it only comes into play after we have decided what we want or need. A more central consideration than burden is the effect of due pro- cess protection upon the government's substantive policy. Procedural controls limit government discretion. Thus, if a perfectly valid adjudi- cative action is based on grounds that are difficult or counterproductive to articulate, procedural controls may render the action unsupportable. If the difficulty with articulation is inherent in the administrative scheme as a whole, rather than being attributable to certain decisional 433. See supra text accompanying note 312. 434.

The concept of summary judgment already existed in administrative law when Mathews was decided, but it involved situations where there was no dispute about the facts, rather than situations where the dispute could be resolved by examination of documents.

Categorizing considerations such as these as an "interest" of the government represents a curious anthropomorphism, probably result- ing from the extent to which the individual interest analysis has infected procedural due process doctrine.</page><page sequence="101">1144 CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 72:1044 grounds, the imposition of procedural controls will not only preclude certain actions, but will discourage the entire program.438 Moreover, as previously indicated, purely procedural considerations can lead to ab- solute prohibitions on certain general actions, such as ad hoc rulemak- ing that affects small groups, or the formulation of presumptive rules.439 It is this impact on government, not costs and burdens, that raises the essential questions about minimum procedures. 2. Due Process Archetypes as a Methodology for Determining Minimum Procedures The Supreme Court's leading pronouncements on the content of due process principles, Olihm v. Wakinekona440 and Mathews v. Eldridge,441 both present substantial difficulties. The difficulty Wakinekona created for the rule-obedience principle is readily re- solved, however. If the distinction between procedural and substantive rules seems artificial in this context, it can simply be eliminated. The principle would then be that governmental decisionmakers must follow all applicable rules-hardly a disconcerting or extreme position. The difficulties Mathews created for the minimum procedures principle, however, cannot be answered as easily. If the Mathews framework is eliminated, the complex task of defining minimum proce- dures remains. In effect, this is the central question of modern admin- istrative due process cases. Mathews begins from the premise that an entirely new theory should be developed to determine the minimum procedures to be im- posed on administrative agencies. A more promising avenue is to look to the minimum procedures that have been traditionally imposed on common law adjudications, and that are almost universally recognized as legitimate. To be sure, these requirements would need to be adapted to the administrative context, but adaptation seems several degrees eas- ier than innovation. Much has been made of the fact that due process requirements are variable or flexible, a proposition that Chief Justice Burger describes as having been "said so often by this Court and others as not to require citation of authority.""442 But flexibility suggests that one begins with something that is then bent or altered to fit the circum- stances. To start anew, abandoning existing standards, breaks the mold rather than bending it. 438. See, e.g., Frug, Does the Constitution Prevent the Discharge of Civil Service Employees?, 124 U. PA. L.

Traditional adjudications are governed by the two due process archetypes of criminal and civil trial. These archetypes are applied whenever the government undertakes adjudicative action that fits the basic categories "criminal" or "civil." Thus, all a court needs to do in a due process evaluation of these actions is identify the nature of the ac- tion, and the level of protection follows automatically. Questions will naturally arise about the distinction between these categories, as with any legal taxonomy.443 But these questions will be less frequent and more readily resolved than questions arising under the Mathews framework, which attempts to generate a continuum of procedural protection by balancing three immeasurable factors. In identifying procedural archetypes for administrative law, the natural starting point is civil trial, since virtually every administrative decision would belong in that category if decided by a court.444 The main requirements for a civil trial are typically identified as notice, an opportunity for a hearing, and an impartial decisionmaker."445 The hearing is further described as the opportunity to appear in person, to 443. See, e.g., In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358 (1970) (juvenile delinquency adjudication is crimi- nal in nature, contrary to state characterization as civil, and requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt); Burgess v. Samon, 97 U.S. 381 (1878) (tobacco tax is essentially a criminal enactment, despite civil characterization, and therefore cannot be imposed retroactively). See generally J. GOLDSTEIN, A. DERSHOWITZ &amp; R. SCHWARTZ, CRIMINAL LAW: THEORY AND PROCESS 253-318 (1974). 444. An administrative agency may be constitutionally prohibited from deciding criminal cases. A few decisions can be read to suggest that an agency may be granted certain aspects of this power. See, e.g., Yakus v. United States, 321 U.S. 414 (1944) (agency's price control regulations cannot be challenged as unreasonable during criminal trial stemming from their violation); Falbo v. United States, 320 U.S. 549 (1944) (draft board's determination of nonexempt status not review- able at criminal trial for noncompliance with induction order). These decisions invoke the ade- quacy of the agency's procedure as a basis for the holding of constitutionality. See Yakus, 321 U.S. at 435-37; Falbo, 320 U.S. at 552. See generally P. BATOR, P. MISHKIN, D. SHAPIRO &amp; H. WECHSLER, supra note 180, at 341-44. In addition, such decisions come from an era where the reaction against the anti-New Deal Court conspired with the exigencies of war to produce an unusual degree of deference to administrative agencies. Modern cases not only limit these earlier decisions, see McKart v. United States, 395 U.S. 185 (1969) (draft board's decision reviewed to determine if based on a correct interpretation of the statute); United States v. England, 347 F.2d 425 (7th Cir. 1965) (validity of a tax assessment must be submitted to a jury), but tend to move in the opposite direction. They hold that something more than civil trial is required in certain noncriminal cases. See Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745 (1982) (clear and convincing evidence needed to terminate parental rights for neglect); Addington v. Texas, 441 U.S. 418 (1979) (clear and convincing evidence needed to confine person to mental institution). 445. See Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254, 266-71 (1970). Goldberg's lasting doctrinal contri- bution may well be the clarity with which it specifies the components of due process. For deci- sions establishing the need for specific elements, see Ward v. Village of Monroeville, 409 U.S. 57, 59-60 (1972) (impartial decisionmaker); Boddie v. Connecticut, 401 U.S. 371, 377-78 (1971) (op- portunity for hearing); Mullane v.

For many of these actions, requirements analogous to those of civil trials seemed excessively elaborate. Consequently, courts began to vary the requirements, principally by reducing their formality or by eliminating particular features of the hearing requirement.449 With this background, the real function of the Mathews analysis becomes apparent: its three factors serve as methods for adjusting the requirements of civil trials in particular types of administrative adjudi- cations, rather than as independent grounds by which due process re- quirements can be derived. Common law uses individual interest to determine the timing of due process protection.450 In the administra- tive area, that concern becomes a more important one, because admin- istrative agencies, unlike private parties, can generally invoke state power unilaterally. The appropriate role for individual interest, there- fore, is to determine whether the required notice and a hearing should be shifted to the preliminary stages of the agency's action. The fiscal and administrative burden that procedural protection will impose upon the government is relevant in determining the degree of formality that should be required, and this is, in fact, the way the Court has used it.451 446. See, e.g., Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. at 269-70. See generally Friendly, Some Kind of Hearing, 123 U. PA. L. REV. 1267, 1277-95 (1975). 447. Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. at 271. 448.

A case now pending before the Supreme Court, Loudermill v. Cleveland Board of Education,453 illustrates this use of Mathews. The case involves two public employees who were summarily discharged, one for not disclosing a prior felony conviction on his initial applica- tion form, and the other for failing an eyesight examination. Both were given post-termination hearings, pursuant to statute, but claimed that the lack of an informal, pretermination hearing violated their due pro- cess rights. In deciding whether such a pretermination hearing should be required, the Mathews factors-individual interest, governmental burden, and possible error of risk-are precisely the things one might reasonably consider. These considerations seem too abstract to pene- trate the procedural device of a hearing, but they seem quite practical for determining when that hearing should be held. On the merits, the Sixth Circuit seems correct in concluding that a pretermination hearing is indicated in these circumstances. Even a temporary dismissal from employment represents a serious disruption of a person's life, for which backpay and reinstatement provide only partial recompense. And the burden of such a hearing seems relatively minor, since the government must provide a hearing at some point, and since there was no indication that either employee presented an imme- diate danger.454 Interestingly, however, the most useful consideration seems to be precisely the one that was overlooked in Mathews: a refer- ence back to judicial analogy. The agency's case for the dismissal of both employees turned on what are essentially "paper" records, rather than on subjective judgments by their supervisors. These cases are thus equivalent to summary judgment proceedings, where the moving party presents documentary evidence and the defendant must either refute it or demonstrate that there is a material issue of fact to be resolved. The value of the analogy is that it not only resolves the issue of pretermina- 452. All the cases cited supra in note 451 except Wolffwere prior hearing cases. In Wolf, the timing of the hearing to withhold good time credit was irrelevant provided it occurred before the credits were to take effect. Risk of error is presumably relevant to the formality issue as well, although it is not easy to cite cases where this notion has served, or should have served, as an operative principle. 453. 721 F.2d 550 (6th Cir. 1983), cert. granted, 104 S. Ct. 2384 (1984). 454. See Loudermill, 721 F.2d at 562. One employee worked as a security guard, the other as a bus mechanic. The security guard, who had the felony conviction, might have been deemed to present a danger, but he was dismissed for dishonesty in filling out the application form, not because of the conviction, which had occurred 12 years before the application.

Lopez,456 represents such an extensive adaptation that it deserves to be recognized as a qualitatively different model. In Goss, the due process requirements imposed on short-term school suspen- sions were simply "that the student be given oral or written notice of the charges against him and, if he denies them, an explanation of the evidence the authorities have and an opportunity to present his side of the story."457 Professor Eisenberg characterizes this as the consultative process.458 It differs from more trial-related versions of administrative due process in that lawyers do not appear at the hearing, witnesses are not called, and records are not kept. Moreover, the decisionmaker is not limited to the facts and arguments presented at the hearing.459 What remains is a direct interchange between the private person and the government decisionmaker, with the opportunity for the private person to present legal arguments and tell his or her version of the facts. The Supreme Court has not applied this consultative archetype as extensively as it might have, perhaps because of Mathews' overarching influence. Justice Rehnquist's opinion in Hewitt v. Helms,460 however, may be regarded as a tacit recognition of the Goss analysis. In fixing the due process requirements for administrative segregation of a pris- oner, he held that the prisoner must "receive some notice of the charges against him and an opportunity to present his views to the prison offi- cial charged with deciding."46' Unfortunately, Justice Rehnquist at- tempted to derive these requirements from Mathews,462 and never cited Goss. Explicit recognition of Goss would have made the analysis clearer. It might also have provided a solution for some of the other 455. One might use the risk-of-error idea to reach this same conclusion but it is much more vague. The court used it to argue that a pretermination hearing was needed, since both employees ultimately made quite colorable claims, and one was reinstated. Id at 553-54, 562. One might also argue that the paper record minimized the risk of error, as the Supreme Court argued in Mathews. 456. 419 U.S. 565 (1975). 457. Id. at 581. 458.

Fano,463 where the Court's eagerness to deny relief due to the absence of a liberty interest seems to have been motivated, at least in part, by its belief that the opposite decision would necessitate trial-type hearings.464 Common law analogies thus suggest that the methodology for de- termining the content of the minimum-procedures principle in admin- istrative settings is to establish a few basic archetypes of fair procedures, and then adapt them to fit the various situations that arise. The two archetypes that emerge from the existing case law are civil trial, as adapted by the Mathews factors, and the consultative process of the Goss decision. The advantage of this approach over the Mathews framework is apparent. If the three factors identified by Mathews were physical characteristics, we would need a computer to utilize its meth- odology. Since they are in fact immeasureable and subjective, we need a seer. What we have, however, is a judge. In developing rules for judges, broad categories, flexible enough to meet the demands of equity and pragmatism, are preferable to quasi-scientific abstractions. Of course, adaptation still requires subjective judgment, but the basic model of fair procedures will be clear. Moreover, adaptation can pro- ceed incrementally where appropriate, rather than requiring grand reconceptualizations every time another case arises. 3. Governmental Action as an Operative Principle for Determining Minimum Procedures Determining the content of the minimum-procedures principle ob- viously requires more than a methodology. It also requires an opera- tive principle that will decide real cases. The Mathews criteria- individual interest, governmental burden, and risk of error-are prop- erly regarded as subsidiary considerations for reasons previously dis- cussed. What is needed is a criterion that captures the central concerns of the due process clause. Here too, traditional due process doctrine provides a useful anal- ogy. The application of the criminal and civil trial archetypes is based on the nature of the government action taken. This governmental-ac- tion consideration, to which Mathews made a passing reference,465 can 463. 427 U.S. 215 (1976). 464. See Eisenberg, supra note 458, at 419-20 (recommending prescription of consultative pro- cess in Meachum). Justice Rehnquist's opinion in Meachum is virtually explicit on this point: "Holding that [prisoner transfers] are within the reach of the procedural protections of the Due Process Clause would place the Clause astride the day-to-day functioning of state prisons. ... Our holding is that the Due Process Clause does not impose a nationwide rule mandating transfer hearings." 427 U.S. at 228-29 (citations and footnote omitted). 465. Mathews, 424 U.S. at 335, 348-49.

The due process guarantee is concerned with the fairness of the government's behavior toward specific individ- uals; the rule-obedience and minimum-procedures principles are de- rived from this concern. In giving content to the minimum-procedures principle, there is no reason to shift the focus. When we ask whether certain procedures should be imposed on government administrators, the central inquiry should involve the nature of the action that they have taken. Utilizing the governmental-action criterion to select due process archetypes is not a particularly difficult task. If the reviewing court finds that the governmental action should be unconstrained, it will ob- viously not impose any procedures. If it deems constraints appropriate, the civil trial model-our basic archetype of procedural fairness-will generally apply, with whatever adaptations seem advisable. In rare sit- uations, administrative action may be tantamount to punishment,466 in which case the criminal trial model would apply. The Goss v. Lopez467 consultative process represents the only qual- itatively different archetype.468 It is also relatively easy to apply, be- cause it was devised for a qualitatively different type of government adjudication. The adjudication in Goss involved an ongoing institu- tional relationship between state officials and private persons. This dif- fers from the usual image of state adjudications as limited interactions, where the participants come together solely for that purpose. In state- run institutions, there is a wide range of interactions between the offi- cial and the individual-from casual comments and ordinary instruc- tions to basic determinations about the person's presence there. The middle of this range consists of governmental action that involves some determination of facts or application of law, but not a determination that rises to the level of a major entry or exit decision. For these ac- tions, some sort of procedural protection seems appropriate, and the consultative process provides the most satisfactory solution.469 466. See In re Gault, 387 U.S. 1, 27-30 (1967) (incarceration in juvenile reformatory); Rubin, Generalizing the Trial Model of Procedural Due Process.: A New Basis for the Right to Treatment, 17 HARV.

The Court's unwillingness to extend this archetype to relevant institutional situations, such as those in Wakinekona or Meachum, may result from its failure to recognize the nature of the governmental action to which the consultative process applies. This is hardly surprising, of course, since the Court has tended to overlook governmental action as a consideration in its fasci- nation with individual interest, at both the applicability level of Roth and the "process due" level of Mathews. Another case in which the consultative process would seem particularly applicable is Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U.S. 651 (1977). Justice Powell was aware of this possibility, since Goss</page><page sequence="108">1984] ADMINISTRA TIVE DUE PROCESS 1151 The truly difficult issue, therefore, is to determine which govern- mental actions should be subject to due process requirements. Despite its individual interest language, the Supreme Court seems to be at least partially aware of the crucial nature of this consideration. In most of its decisions, the Court focuses on the scope of the administrator's dis- cretion. Use of the term "discretion," of course, is simply a means of characterizing the nature of a governmental action: Is it the sort of action that is, or should be, left to the administrator's discretion, or is it the sort of action that is bound by rules?470 The Court's answer to this question has been to interpret the appli- cable state law. When state law provides administrators with complete discretion, the Court holds that no minimum procedures are to be im- posed. By contrast, when state law limits discretion by establishing decisionmaking criteria, the Court imposes minimum procedures. Often, the Court's liberty and property analysis has meant nothing more than this, since it determines whether such an interest is present by inquiring whether administrative discretion is "unfettered" or constrained.47" involved the same basic situation and dated from only two years before; but he rejected it. Id at 682 n.55. The fact that the Court's use of Goss is so context-specific suggests that it does not regard the decision as being of general significance. 470. See Shapiro, supra note 191, at 1495-1500. Professor Shapiro sees this determination as having been derived from the judiciary's dominant political attitudes toward technocracy and the political process. When technocratic expertise was regarded as the preeminent value, the agency was permitted broad discretion. The notion was that the agency should use its skills rather than be bound by rules (or perhaps, that it should be bound by scientific rules that the agency itself could best discover, rather than by legal rules). With the development of a group politics orienta- tion by the courts, rules began to be imposed. Consistent with this philosophy, however, the rules were procedural in nature. 471. For example, in Boardof Regents v. Roth, the Court determined that no property interest existed because the state law left "the decision whether to rehire a nontenured teacher for another year to the unfettered discretion of university officials." 408 U.S. 564, 567 (1972). Similarly, in Meachum v. Fano, the Court found no property interest because "prison officials have the discre- tion to transfer prisoners for any number of reasons." 427 U.S. 215, 228 (1976). In Leis v. Flynt, the Court concluded that a lawyer did not have a liberty or property interest in appearing pro hac vice in Ohio because "the rules of the Ohio Supreme Court expressly consign the authority to approve [such an] appearance to the discretion of the trial court." 439 U.S. 438, 443 (1979). The Court reached a similar conclusion in Connecticut Board of Pardons v. Dumschat with respect to pardons because "Connecticut has conferred 'unfettered discretion' on its Board of Pardons." 452 U.S. 458, 466 (1981) (quoting Dumschat v. Board of Pardons, 618 F.2d 216, 219 (2d Cir. 1980), rev'd on other grounds, 452 U.S. 458 (198 1)); see also id. at 467 (Brennan, J., concurring) (no liberty interest because plaintiffs have failed to "show-by reference to statute, regulation, administrative practice, contractual arrangement or other mutual understanding-that particularized standards or criteria guide the State's decisionmakers").

In other words, are the minimum procedures a conditional requirement dependent on the state's administrative scheme, or are they an absolute, federal requirement for action of the kind in question? This is precisely the same as asking whether the existence of "liberty" and "property" is to be determined according to state or federal law, although the level of analysis is different. Instead of using this determination to decide whether the due process protection is required at all, it is used to deter- mine the content of due process requirements. Although the effect is largely the same, the resulting analysis be- comes substantially more coherent. For example, the real issue in Hewitt v. Helms472 was not whether a prisoner's continued incarcera- tion with the general prison population is a liberty right. And the real issue in Goss v. Lopez473 was not whether a child's continued attend- ance at school is a property interest. These questions are pure formal- ism, and counterintuitive formalism at that. The real issue is whether prison administrators should have uncontrolled discretion to place pris- oners in seclusion, or whether school officials should have uncontrolled discretion to suspend students. What is at stake is not the meaning of liberty and property, but the meaning of procedural fairness. To be sure, translating questions about the scope of administrative discretion into discussions of the terms "liberty" and "property," as the Court has done, achieves a certain linguistic economy. It takes a neces- sary concept with no direct textual reference, and attaches it to a phrase in the text with no other obvious function. But while that seems conve- nient, it does not work; the phrase and the concept are really unrelated, and one distorts the other. The scope of administrative discretion is part of the general concept of procedural fairness, to be determined in analyzing the constraints on governmental interactions with the indi- vidual. The phrase "life, liberty, or property" is best regarded as indi- cating the clause's concern with adjudicatory decisions-that is, with defining the set of governmental actions to which the clause relates. It thus provides us with no content for analyzing particular actions. That "expectation" of release). And in Barry v. Barchi, the Court found a property interest in a racehorse trainer's license, because "[u]nder New York law, a license may not be revoked or sus- pended at the discretion of the racing authorities." 443 U.S. 55, 64 n.l 1 (1979). 472. 459 U.S. 460 (1983). 473. 419 U.S. 565 (1975).</page><page sequence="110">1984] ADMINISTRATIVE DUE PROCESS 1153 analysis depends upon the principle of procedural fairness, not on the definition of the adjudicatory context in which that principle operates. Although the conceptual framework of the post-Roth cases is un- workable, the issues that the Court has confronted in these cases are real in that they represent a significant question about the way in which our government is structured-a question for which there is no existing political consensus. When magic solutions based on invocations of the terms "liberty" and "property" are abandoned, it becomes clear that the answer depends on one's views about a variety of issues: the proper role of constitutional courts, the proper balance between state and fed- eral power, the degree to which administrative agencies treat individu- als unfairly, the causes of such unfairness, the significance of such unfairness, and the ability of courts to provide a cure for it. These issues, obviously difficult to resolve, must be discussed in order to choose between state and federal standards for minimum procedures. The Court's choice has generally been the state standard, although it has been willing to declare a federal standard where physical re- straint, physical punishment, or stigmatizing action is concerned.474 It has articulated or implied four principal arguments in favor of this standard. First and most explicit is the Court's view that underlying substantive rights-particularly "property" rights-are created by state law.475 Second is the implicit notion that the federal standard would constitute a form of substantive due process.476 Third is the Court's view that the federal judiciary should defer to the expertise of adminis- trative decisionmakers, and to the authority of either the states or a coordinate branch of the federal government.477 The final argument, 474. See supra notes 148-58, 215 and accompanying text. 475. See, e.g., Leis v. Flynt, 439 U.S. 438, 441 (1979); Bishop v. Wood, 426 U.S. 341, 344 (1976); Goss v. Lopez, 419 U.S. 565, 572-74 (1975); Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 577 (1972). With respect to liberty, see Hewitt v. Helms, 459 U.S. 460, 469-71 (1983) (particular liberty right); Greenholtz v. Inmates of the Neb. Penal &amp; Correctional Complex, 442 U.S. 1, 12 (1979) (same); Meachum v. Fano, 427 U.S. 215, 226 (1976) (liberty in general); Paul v. Davis, 424 U.S. 693, 709-10 (1976) (same). See also Easterbrook, supra note 264, at 87-88 (liberty and property); Simon, supra note 5, at 171-74 (property). 476. The Court is presumably implying this argument when it states that the Constitution does not create property rights or that the due process clause does not itself create a particular liberty right. The creation of "liberty" and "property" interests that were not subject to reduction by general laws was, in fact, a hallmark of the substantive due process era. See, e.g., Truax v. Corrigan, 257 U.S. 312 (1921) (state anti-injunction statute for labor disputes deprives employers of property by allowing injuries to business); Coppage v. Kansas, 236 U.S. 1 (1915) (state law forbidding "yellow dog" (anti-union) contracts deprives employers of liberty and property rights to make contracts freely), overruled by Phelps Dodge Corp. v. NLRB, 313 U.S. 177, 187 (1941). Commentators have also advanced this view. See, e.g., Smolla, supra note 5, at 98-100; Tushnet, supra note 4. 477. See, e.g., Hewitt v. Helms, 459 U.S. 460, 470-74 (1983); Meachum v. Fano, 427 U.S. 215, 228-29 (1976); Bishop v. Wood, 426 U.S. 341, 349-50 (1976); Goss v.

The argument becomes irrelevant if the basic purpose of procedural due process is to place constitutional limits on administra- tive adjudication.479 Under this approach, a federal standard does not displace state substantive law; rather, it concedes the existence of that law, and then imposes standards on its adjudicatory operation. For example, in the case of school suspension, the issue would not be whether the Court should establish a federal definition of the property interest, or defer to a state-created interest; rather, the issue would be whether the Court should impose minimum procedures on school sus- pensions, given that state-created method of discipline. It must be recognized, however, that a federal standard for proce- dural due process imposes the affirmative obligation that states specify criteria for actions that are deemed nondiscretionary in character. This emerges from the limitation of due process to the goal of accurate deci- sionmaking.480 If minimum procedures are required, and the purpose of those procedures is to ensure an accurate decision, the requirement can be meaningful only if there are some criteria for accuracy. The federal standard does not require that any particular criteria be se- lected; it only requires that the state make its criteria explicit. Of course, the state may argue that it has no criteria for a particular deci- sion, but that is precisely what a federal standard forbids. To say that as a matter of federal law a type of administrative action is nondiscre- tionary means that the state may not leave the administrator free from any possible review. Requiring states to establish decisionmaking criteria does not im- pose a definition of property on them. Rather, it limits the discretion- ary power of state administrators over individuals, which is precisely the point of a federal definition of permissible discretion. Whereas this certainly constitutes a limit on the state's power, only the post-Roth Court would regard it as a federalized definition of property.481 The second argument, that a federal standard would constitute substantive due process, depends, of course, on one's definition of that 478. See, e.g., Parratt v. Taylor, 451 U.S. 527, 544 (1981); Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U.S. 651, 682 n.55 (1977); Paul v. Davis, 424 U.S. 693, 701 (1976). 479. See supra Part II, Section A, subsection 3. 480. See supra notes 285-92 and accompanying text. 481. In fact, limitation of the way in which the state may implement its substantive law is a quintessential 14th amendment concept. The equal protection clause, under present doctrine, op- erates in very much the same manner. It does not require the state to create any laws nor does it displace any state rules regarding the validity of those laws. It simply imposes the additional requirement that the laws must operate equally in certain areas or with respect to certain groups.</page><page sequence="112">1984] ADMINISTRA TIVE DUE PROCESS 1155 concept. The Court's opinions suggest that the federal standard is sub- stantive because its requirements are derived from the "Due Process Clause itself."482 But the direct derivation of legal guidelines from the due process clause cannot be sensibly regarded as inevitably substan- tive. If it were, there could be no such thing as procedural due process, since the due process clause is the origin of all procedural require- ments. The rule-obedience principle is derived from the due process clause itself. It is certainly not an inherent condition of governmental action, since current doctrine does not impose it on the states outside the adjudicatory context.483 The trial model for the minimum-proce- dures principle, which the Court has unhesitatingly applied, is also de- rived from the due process clause. As Professor Grey notes, this derivation can only be achieved by reference to tradition, and the tradi- tion can have no other link to the constitutional text.484 Even the state standard, which was specifically selected for its lack of content, is nec- essarily derived from the due process clause. The text of the fourteenth amendment, after all, makes no independent reference to state law. The federal standard does differ from the state standard in that it has significantly more content. And perhaps this content is difficult to derive from the constitutional text, and thus requires an exercise of ju- dicial discretion. That may make the federal standard undesirably vague, but it does not make it substantive. It is simply incorrect to define "substantive" as equivalent to vagueness or to the need to in- voke nontextual principles.485 To be sure, both vagueness and cavalier treatment of the constitutional text were particular sins of the substan- tive due process cases in the Lochner v. New York486 era. But their substantive nature was an additional sin, not the same one. It con- sisted, according to the common interpretation, of using the due pro- cess clause to invalidate general economic legislation.487 482. Hewitt v. Helms, 459 U.S. 460, 466 (1983). The Court cannot mean that a federal stan- dard would dictate choices about economic matters. As Professor Shapiro points out, many mod- em due process cases are as economic in nature as their substantive due process predecessors, no matter what standard they employ. See Shapiro, supra note 252, at 91-96. 483. See supra text accompanying note 330. 484. Grey, supra note 255, at 711, 715-17. 485. Nontextually based interpretation is a technique applicable to many constitutional clauses; it may affect the legitimacy of the decision, but it hardly changes its underlying nature. For example, Robinson v. California, 370 U.S. 660 (1962) (punishment for involuntary status is cruel and unusual) may have been a nontextually based eighth amendment decision, but it was an eighth amendment decision nonetheless. In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358 (1970) (criminal conviction requires proof beyond reasonable doubt) certainly goes beyond the text, but it would not be called substantive due process by most people. 486. 198 U.S. 45 (1905). 487. See, e.g., Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., 348 U.S. 483, 488 (1955); L. TRIBE, supra note 4, at 434-42. The distinction between general nontextual interpretation and substantive review is well illustrated by a recent case, Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745 (1983). In Santosky, the Court</page><page sequence="113">1156 CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 72:1044 There are, however, certain cases in which the federal standard is substantive in that it does affect general rulemaking. In situations where minimum procedures are required, due process demands that the legislature may not empower administrators to act in their unfet- tered discretion-that is, for no reason at all.488 But this prohibition arises directly from a procedural requirement; every constitutional rule prohibits actions in otherwise distinct fields that would reduce or elimi- nate the protection it provides. The federal standard for administrative due process, even with this qualification, does not require that any par- ticular rules be adopted. It would only establish that the state cannot vitiate the minimum-procedures requirement by granting an adminis- trator unfettered discretion. The procedural nature of prohibiting certain general grants of un- fettered discretion can be clarified by focusing on the meaning of the federal standard. In the present context, a federal standard determines as a matter of federal law whether or not governmental actions are le- gitimately discretionary. Since the standard necessarily rests on pre- vailing legal norms, it establishes that a particular state decision is really based upon articulable criteria. If the state asserts the contrary, according to this view, it is not really declaring as a matter of general law that the decision is to be left to unfettered administrative discre- tion. Rather, it is attempting to circumvent the requirements of the due process clause. Can a state really provide that welfare benefits are to be distributed, or parental rights terminated, without criteria in the ad- ministrator's unfettered discretion? Or would such a rule merely indi- cate that the state preferred not to articulate its criteria, thus escaping review of particular decisions? The federal standard forbids no sub- stantive result except the latter. It permits a state to declare any gener- ally operative criteria it wants, however irrational or inadvisable, and take its chances with the political process and the other provisions of required clear and convincing evidence before a state could terminate parental rights on the ground that the child was "permanently neglected." Justice Blackmun began his opinion for the Court by declaring that "freedom of personal choice in matters of family life is a fundamental liberty interest protected by the Fourteenth Amendment," id at 753, and by citing Moore v. City of E. Cleveland, 431 U.S. 494, 499 (1977). In fact, the statement is unnecessary and the citation concedes too much. Moore was a true substantive due process decision. It held that a state may not enact a general law forbidding family members from cohabiting. Santosky does not forbid any general law. It does not, for example, prescribe parental rights. All it does is prescribe the manner in which criteria the state chooses to use are to be applied in particular cases. The Court could have reached this result by stating that the nature of a neglect proceeding was sufficiently accusatory and punitive-that is, sufficiently closer to a criminal trial than the average administrative or civil proceeding-to de- mand a higher standard of proof. That may be a somewhat vague notion, and it certainly requires that something be read into the constitutional text, but it is genuinely procedural nonetheless. 488. See supra text accompanying notes 373-79 (prohibition against laws that apply only to specified individuals, or that presume occurrence of procedural events).</page><page sequence="114">1984] ADMINISTRATIVE DUE PROCESS 1157 the Constitution. What it cannot do is conceal its criteria behind a facade of discretion. The third argument, involving deference to administrative agen- cies and separate branches or sovereigns, has a certain force, but it also presents substantial difficulties. Deference to a coordinate branch of government seems singularly inappropriate where procedural due process is concerned. Due process requirements in the federal context originally applied to adjudications carried out by federal courts them- selves. The Supreme Court, as the supervisor and reviewer of these courts, could hardly be said to owe them very much deference. Today, the court-like process of adjudication is often carried out by executive agencies-but that shift of responsibility is generally viewed as a basis for added vigilance, not less. The Court cannot believe that the power to adjudicate an individual's status is uniquely committed to federal agencies. It is difficult to see what action of a coordinate branch the Court would find appropriate to review if not its court-like functions. Deference to the states has become an important theme in consti- tutional law, but it generates a certain tension when applied to the four- teenth amendment. On purely interpretivist grounds, it is reasonably clear that the framers of the fourteenth amendment did not share the present Court's solicitude for state prerogatives. "Their federalism" was more activist in nature. Convinced that at least one group of states simply could not be trusted to act fairly toward at least one group of its citizens, the framers sought to place at least some state action under the supervision of the federal courts and the federal legislature.489 The fourteenth amendment is essentially a vehicle for federal control over the states; it is one of the few provisions in the Constitution that estab- lishes such control, and one of an even smaller number that does so beyond the perceived needs of the federal government to maintain its own authority.490 The protection specified by this amendment, therefore, seems like the last constitutional guarantee to interpret deferentially. While the argument based on deference to a coordinate federal branch or the states seems weaker in the context of the due process clause, the related argument of deference to administrative agencies is directly applicable to the modern operation of that clause. It raises the policy issues concerning due process in their most direct form. There is 489. Even those who read the history most restrictively concede this much. See R. BERGER, supra note 254, at 169-80; Bickel, supra note 264. The doctrinal interpretation is much more ex- pansive. See, e.g., Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U.S. 641 (1966). 490. Cf U.S. CONST. art.

On the other hand, there is a reason why the methods by which state agencies adjudicate state claims are subject to constitutional scru- tiny. This reason is the unique potential for oppression when the force of the state is brought to bear on specific individuals. Administrative decisions, being both particularized and obscure, are rarely subject to extralegal constraints, and it therefore seems dangerous to leave them within the exclusive control of a single instrumentality of government.491 B. The Federal Standardfor Minimum Procedures The final objection to a federal standard for the minimum proce- dures principle is the apparent lack of guidelines for formulating such a standard. One possible response is that courts should develop guide- lines in the process of deciding cases, and that the way to provide con- tent for the federal standard is to begin applying it. But the Supreme Court could reasonably demand a bit more assurance of success before starting down that path. In fact, several sources of guidelines have emerged in the twelve troubled years of due process adjudication since Roth. A decision that no liberty or property interest is present can be viewed, and is in fact more comprehensible, as a decision that the administrator's action is properly discretionary under a federal standard. Decisions under the state standard can also be translated into federal equivalents whenever the Court bases its interpretation on the administrator's actual behavior rather than on the literal language of the prevailing legislation.492 Fi- nally, courts can adopt guidelines from other areas, such as state and federal administrative law, that present analogous considerations. More general guidance in formulating criteria can be obtained from the underlying values that due process serves. The basic value is to avoid the oppressiveness of particularized decisionmaking. This suggests the rough but significant idea that particular action should be allowed only insofar as it is necessary to carry out the state's estab- lished goal. A more specific value is that of accurate decisionmaking, which the Court insists should be the exclusive focus of the clause. Ac- 491. As a practical matter, legislators will not grant administrators unfettered discretion in most cases, but a doctrine that makes the scope of due process protection depend totally on state law would permit the possibility. To the extent that this possibility were realized, the essential purpose of procedural protection would be frustrated. 492. See supra note 471 (reliance of court on extent of administrative discretion in deciding whether to apply due process requirements).</page><page sequence="116">1984] ADMINISTRATIVE DUE PROCESS 1159 ceptance of this view leads to the conclusion that when procedural re- quirements are imposed, the state must articulate its decisionmaking criteria. Consequently, procedures should be required for all govern- mental actions where specified decisionmaking criteria seem appropriate.493 Accurate decisionmaking has its obvious limits,494 but one of its strengths is that it makes a federal standard easier to articulate. In de- termining whether criteria are required, rather than deciding directly whether procedural protection is required, one can call on several gen- eral notions of our legal system, especially notions of administrative law. Virtually any legal characterization of an agency decision is rele- vant to the question of criteria, whereas only procedural determina- tions shed light on the inherent value of procedures. Relying on our general legal culture, and particularly on adminis- trative law, to generate guidelines for the minimum-procedures princi- ple has the ancillary benefit of reducing the danger that due process doctrine will disrupt state agencies. It would mean that in many cases the federal standard, like the state standard, would derive its content from state law. The difference is that the federal standard would look to state law in general, rather than to the law that applies to the particu- lar governmental action under review. As with many legal rules, the federal standard demands no more than an acceptable level of behav- ior; but it defines acceptability itself, rather than leaving that definition to the participants. Thus, control is imposed upon the wayward and the vicious, while preserving the primacy of democratic decisionmak- ing with respect to overarching social policy considerations. The guidelines for a federal standard will be discussed below. None of them has been explicitly employed as a federal due process standard. An attempt to do so would require a more extensive under- taking than can be accomplished here, and might well be impossible absent an on-going interaction with the fact patterns of litigated cases. For present purposes, it is sufficient to note that a federally established standard is a possibility and to suggest the general considerations for that standard, without providing bright-line rules. What is important is that such a standard can be derived from familiar, reasonably well- accepted legal principles. This means that a federal standard for the minimum-procedures principle cannot be rejected as being impossible 493. Recognition of the inherent or dignitary values of procedure would yield an entirely different guideline. The emphasis would be on identifying those actions that seem to demand procedure itself, rather than those that seem to demand criteria. Thus, a sensitive but necessarily subjective decision, like placing a child for adoption or pardoning a convicted felon, would be subject to procedural constraints under the dignitary standard, but not under the accurate deci- sionmaking standard. 494. See supra notes 285-92 and accompanying text.</page><page sequence="117">1160 CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 72:1044 to define. The most controversial policy choice of due process analy- sis-the extent to which state administrative action should be subject to federally imposed procedural requirements-must be confronted. The potential guidelines for a federal standard governing the mini- mum-procedures principle are best explored by considering the various forms of administrative adjudication. For present purposes, four main types of adjudication can be identified: the distribution of benefits, the hiring and firing of government employees, the distribution of burdens, and the regulation of individuals in government-run institutions. There are other types of action, of course, but these categories cover the major ones and take account of the cases decided to date. 1. Government Benefits As used here, the term benefits refers to any positive consequence distributed by the government: social welfare, licenses, grants, and contracts.495 In constitutional litigation regarding government benefits, the principal issue has been whether the benefit can be terminated without a prior or subsequent administrative hearing. Of course, the recipient always has the due process right to go to court after a benefit has been terminated to complain that the termination did not comply with applicable law. The recipient may have no cause of action if the benefit is legitimately discretionary, but he or she at least has the right to go to court and obtain that determination.496 As far as administrative hearings are concerned, the Supreme Court has looked to the positive law regarding termination of the bene- fit to determine whether minimum procedures should be imposed. A federal standard would focus instead on the nature of the benefit itself, as determined by the manner in which we expect that benefit to be distributed. Our common understanding is that certain benefits, such as welfare payments or certificates of building occupancy, are distrib- uted according to specific rules. Generally, enabling statutes will spec- 495. Employment could be treated as a benefit, but it is somewhat different, given the impact of the jobholder on government operations. It will therefore be considered separately. See infra notes 512-20 and accompanying text. 496. Perhaps court review could be precluded if the administrative agency established its own subsequent hearing procedures, and if those hoary restrictions on the scope of agency adjudica- tion, see Crowell v. Benson, 285 U.S. 22 (1932); Ohio Valley Water Co. v. Ben Avon Borough, 253 U.S. 287 (1920); supra notes 22-23 and accompanying text, are no longer the law. But absent such a procedure, any prohibition of subsequent judicial review would violate due process. Moreover, under no circumstances could the employee be precluded from bringing suit in federal court on the ground that the agency's hearing procedures were improper. Even the decisions that grant agencies the widest scope in making initial determinations make it clear that some source of judi- cial review over the agency must be available. Estep v. United States, 327 U.S. 114, 122-25 (1946); Bowles v. Willingham, 321 U.S. 503, 516 (1944); see P. BATOR, P. MISHKIN, D. SHAPIRO &amp; H. WECHSLER, supra note 180, at 338-44 (H. Hart dialogue).</page><page sequence="118">1984] ADMINISTRA TIVE DUE PROCESS 1161 ify these rules. Benefit termination would thus require minimum procedures, based on the civil trial archetype, to determine whether ap- plicable rules had been obeyed. A legislative or administrative declara- tion that the distribution of these benefits was entirely discretionary would generally be void as an effort to circumvent the effect of proce- dural protection, because no state agency really distributes welfare without some eligibility rules that constrain its agents' discretion. A declaration to the contrary would be an effort to avoid due process scrutiny, not an effort to dispense with rules. A federal standard, therefore, would require the agency to articu- late its rules for the distribution of nondiscretionary benefits, and then grant the individual procedural protection to insure that benefit termi- nation occurred in accordance with those rules. Benefits whose distri- bution was legitimately discretionary, on the other hand, could be terminated without such procedures. Of course, the state might adopt rules to govern the distribution of discretionary benefits, in which case the rule-obedience principle would require the agency to obey its own rules in individual determinations.497 The distinction between those benefits that are legitimately discre- tionary and those that must be constrained by procedural protections and predefined rules has not been established by the case law. Indeed, this is the area where the various permutations of the right-privilege and liberty-property analyses have taken their greatest conceptual toll. The distinction is a common one at the administrative policy level, however, where it is based on the notion of competitive as opposed to eligibility-based distributions.498 497. Perkins v. Lukens Steel Co., 310 U.S. 113 (1940), is sometimes treated as establishing the rule that an unsuccessful bidder for a government contract cannot challenge the result of a pre- established bidding process because it has no legal right to the bid, and thus no standing. See Edelman v. Federal Hous. Admin., 382 F.2d 594, 597 (2d Cir. 1967); Gonzalez v. Freeman, 334 F.2d 570, 574 (D.C. Cir. 1964). But Lukens was actually a challenge to a general rule governing the bidding process (specifically, the Secretary of Labor's definition of "locality" for minimum wage requirements as two large sections of the nation). It was not a challenge to the rejection of a particular bid on particularized grounds. The opinion certainly contains broad language, see 310 U.S. at 125-28, but most of it is dictum, and the opinion dates from the period when the Supreme Court was uniquely deferential toward administrative agencies. When rejection of individual bid- ders has been at issue, most courts have simply refused to follow Lukens, often citing the interven- ing passage of the APA. See B.K. Instrument, Inc. v. United States, 715 F.2d 713, 720-21 (2d Cir. 1983) (citing cases). Thus, despite the language of Lukens, the holdings in the government bidding cases are consistent with the notion that once the government has established rules for the particu- larized distribution of a benefit, procedural protections are available to ensure that those rules have been followed. 498.

A research grant, a government construction contract, or the placement of a child for adoption would be obvious examples. Decisions to grant such benefits, and thus to ter- minate them, require complex, subtle determinations that do not lend themselves to predefined rules.499 As the benefit becomes the sort that is distributed to a group of "eligible" persons, such as social welfare benefits or public education, minimum procedures and predefined rules enforceable by those procedures become almost universal in adminis- trative law, and a federal standard would hold that they are constitu- tionally required. Determining eligibility, as opposed to excellence, is not the sort of task that would be hampered by established criteria. Requiring the ar- ticulation of rules would not limit the government's power to terminate all benefits after a fixed period of time, to limit the benefit to certain groups of people, or to adopt whatever other general rules it wishes. It would not even limit the government's power to use rules-such as first come, first served, or a lottery-that might be rgarded as irrational on other grounds. It would only prohibit the government from not estab- lishing rules at all and declaring the matter to be entirely within the discretion of its administrators. That one general prohibition circum- vents the protection that minimum procedures would provide. Licenses are the most difficult case, because they are awarded on the basis of both excellence and eligibility. Even here, however, most cases can be resolved fairly readily. Licenses involving allocation of a scarce resource, such as a broadcast frequency, or a consciously limited one, such as airline routes, may properly be granted and terminated on applying only to certain types of decisions, not to any decision.

Horowitz, 435 U.S. 78 (1978) (favorable academic evaluation in medical school); Apter v. Richardson, 510 F.2d 351 (7th Cir. 1975) (dictum) (research grant); Kletschka v. Driver, 411 F.2d 436 (2d Cir. 1969) (renewal of research grant). The notion was well expressed in Kletschka: Each [research grant] decision involves a determination by the agency [on] the relative merits of the many proposed research projects for which funds are sought. ... We do not believe it would be practical for the district court to review such a decision, resting on complex and subtle evaluation of the technical merit of plaintiffs project and the profes- sional competence of plaintiff himself.

The horse trainer's license in Barry v. Barchi?5' falls clearly into this latter category, since its purpose was to set standards for entry into an occupation. Attorneys are equivalent to horse trainers, at least in this context, so that cases involving bar admis- sion should also be regarded as a nondiscretionary determination, re- quiring minimum procedures.502 Leis v. Flynts03 would thus have been decided differently under a federal standard. Permission for an out-of- state lawyer to appear in the state courts is in no sense a scarce resource or a determination based on excellence. It is a question of eligibility, and the federal standard would hold that it is simply impermissible to characterize such a routine matter of judicial administration as discretionary."? Once the availability of a hearing to terminate benefits is deter- mined, the next question is whether the hearing must precede the revo- cation. Since this question involves the timing of due process rights, the proper consideration is individual interest. License revocations seem likely to disrupt one's business and impose a stigma; termination of social welfare benefits can create temporary but severe hardships on the needy persons who receive them; and exclusion from public educa- tion deprives the student of unique learning time. Consequently, prior hearings would be required in all these cases. In contrast, purely mon- etary losses, such as the termination of a corporation's tax exemption or an economically secure person's benefit, would require hearings only after the government has acted.505 In addition to terminating benefits, administrative agencies also make adjudicative decisions-that is, decisions with respect to specified individuals-when they reject applications for these benefits. The question of minimum procedures naturally arises with respect to these 500. The federal government has, however, adopted rules that must be followed in both cases, see, e.g., 47 U.S.C. ?? 307-310 (1982) (broadcast licenses); 49 U.S.C. ? 1371 (1976 &amp; Supp. V 1981) (airline routes), and a truly discretionary standard in the former would probably violate the first amendment. 501. 443 U.S. 55 (1979). 502. See Willner v. Committee on Character and Fitness, 373 U.S. 96 (1963); Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners, 353 U.S. 232 (1957). 503. 439 U.S. 438 (1979). 504. Strictly speaking, Flynt was not an administrative case since the only branch of govern- ment involved was the judiciary. It is, however, a case about judicial administration and thus raises issues analogous to administrative cases. When a judge interprets the law rather than runs the court, the concept of discretion obviously means something quite distinct. 505. See Phillips v. Commissioner, 283 U.S. 589, 596-97 (1931) (Brandeis, J.)

While cases on this issue are less common, it is estab- lished doctrine that people have the right to a judicial trial on the claim that an agency improperly rejected their application-that is, rejected it in violation of established rules.506 The applicant's right to review ex- ists regardless of the merits of his claim.507 The open issue is whether an agency must provide some sort of procedural protection before rejecting the application. Since the ques- tion is one of timing, inquiry should again focus on the individual's interest. There seems to be a substantial difference between the termi- nation of an existing benefit and the denial of an application for a new one, since the former has disruptive and stigmatizing effects that the latter lacks.50s In addition, the administrative and financial burden im- posed is relevant in this context. Given the obvious expense of provid- ing hearings before any application is rejected, it seems reasonable to require hearings only after the determination is made. The applicant's interest in receiving deserved benefits without re- sort to litigation or administrative appeal is not a negligible one, how- ever, and some protection seems desirable. Commentators have devoted considerable attention in recent years to a statement-of-reasons requirement.509 Even when a hearing is not required, they argue, the government should state the reasons for its action. With respect to dis- cretionary determinations, the notion is problematic. As previously noted, the most serious costs of due process protection are the con- straints it places on administrative judgment and the consequent distor- tions it produces in the state's substantive policies.51o If the decision is deemed discretionary, by whatever standard, these constraints and dis- tortions should not be imposed. With respect to nondiscretionary de- terminations regarding applications for benefits, the statement-of- 506. See, e.g., Scanwell Laboratories, Inc. v. Shaffer, 424 F.2d 859 (D.C.

Again, an agency might be able to preclude judicial review of its decision, but only by providing the equivalent to civil trial. 508. Judge Friendly has observed that "there is a human difference between losing what one has and not getting what one wants." Friendly, supra note 446, at 1296. The question is whether that human difference translates into a legal difference, and if so, by what rationale. 509.

See supra text accompanying notes 438-39.</page><page sequence="122">1984] ADMINISTRATIVE DUE PROCESS 1165 reasons requirement is more appealing, since it imposes substantially lower constraints and costs on the agency than the hearing requirement does. The reasons requirement need not be regarded as a novel depar- ture from due process precedent. In reality, it represents an adaptation of the trial model's element of notice. "Notice" has two different, al- though related meanings, both derived from criminal indictments and civil complaints. First, it can mean notice of the time and place of a hearing. Second, and more important, it can refer to an announcement by the opposing party of the basis on which that party will proceed. In private litigation, notice thus allows preparation and increases proce- dural efficiency. When the government initiates the action, as in crimi- nal prosecutions, it serves the additional function of constraining the government's exercise of power; it compels the state to limit itself to the grounds specified in the notice and to subject itself to challenges on those grounds.51 A requirement that the government give reasons for the denial of benefit applications is simply a requirement that the government give notice before taking any action, rather than simply giving notice prior to a hearing. While such notice is not particularly useful for aiding preparation, it does constrain the arbitrary exercise of power. Of course, it does not guarantee that administrative action will be taken for legitimate reasons, but it does mean that administrators must be able to articulate in advance some respectable explanation for that ac- tion. In addition, it informs the applicant that the action is nondiscre- tionary and that there may be a basis for complaint if the stated reason is incorrect. In other words, the interest of an individual applicant is not sufficient to shift the hearing to the time of the application's denial, but it does seem sufficient to shift the notice element to that time. This is what a reasons requirement would achieve. 511. The stated functions of a reasons requirement are those that are linked to the central purpose of the due process clause: to prevent oppression of individuals in their one-to-one inter- actions with state agents. From a policy perspective, a reasons statement serves additional pur- poses. See S. SUGARMAN, SCHOOL SORTING AND DISCLOSURES 4-1 to 4-2 (National Institute of Education 1982). In addition to the control-of-abuse function, Professor Sugarman discusses the purpose of information in terms of our economic values of individual choice (the marketplace), our political values of government by consent, and the individual's ability to take advantage of available entitlements. In the benefit-denial context, the individual's ability to take advantage of entitlements is par- ticularly important. Perhaps the person really is eligible, but filled out the form incorrectly; per- haps he or she is ineligible, but could become eligible by modifying some behavior. By not giving reasons, the government risks erroneous denials and denies itself an instrument for altering indi- vidual behavior to achieve a social policy objective. But since this failure affects the grantee group generally, rather than being directed against a particular individual, it lies beyond the constitu- tional ambit of due process and belongs to the realm of social policy, as Professor Sugarman suggests.</page><page sequence="123">1166 CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 72:1044 2. Public Employment In cases involving the termination of public employment, the Supreme Court has focused, its liberty-property discourse notwith- standing, on whether the government must demonstrate cause or whether the employment was discretionary, that is, could be terminated at will. This is certainly a relevant consideration; the difficulty in the cases is that the Court has looked to the state's positive law to deter- mine whether cause must be shown. A federal standard would base this determination on the nature of the position, not on a declaration of the legislature or the agency. In most cases that determination can be made on the basis of three criteria: whether the position is discretionary or ministerial, permanent or temporary, or unusually sensitive. At least two of these criteria are quite familiar in our general legal system. First, policy positions are generally discretionary, while ministerial positions are not. This dis- tinction originated in the common law512 and it is part of our constitu- tional doctrine as a result of Elrod v. Burns,"'13 which held that only policy-level employees can be dismissed on the basis of their political views. Extending the distinction to due process cases might generate a 512. In tort law, for example, judicial decisions and statutory schemes regularly distinguish between ministerial and policy-level state employees in determining whether an action will lie against the state. The Federal Tort Claims Act makes this distinction explicitly, 28 U.S.C. ? 2680 (1982) (excluding claims "based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty" from coverage under the Act), as does the Restatement, RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS ? 895(D)(3) (1979); id comment d ("[P]ublic officers are given an immunity from liability in tort when they engage in exercising a 'discretionary function.' "). For common law cases on this point, see Hansen v. City of Saint Paul, 298 Minn. 205, 214 N.W.2d 346 (1974); Jones v. State, 33 N.Y.2d 275, 407 N.E.2d 236, 352 N.Y.S.2d 169 (1973). An analogous, but less well-developed area of law, involves the judicial implication of a discharge-for-cause provision into employment contracts that, on their face, are terminable at will. Many of the leading decisions specify that such a term will be implied only for ministerial-level employees. See, e.g., Pugh v. See's Candies, Inc., 116 Cal. App. 3d 311, 171 Cal. Rptr. 917 (1981); Cleary v. American Airlines, I 11 Cal. App. 3d 443, 168 Cal. Rptr. 722 (1980); Toussaint v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield, 408 Mich. 579, 292 N.W.2d 880 (1980). 513. 427 U.S. 347, 367 (1976); see also Branti v. Finkel, 445 U.S. 507, 518 (1980); Gilbert v. Johnson, 419 F. Supp. 859 (N.D. Ga. 1976); cf Kletschka v. Driver, 411 F.2d 436, 442-43 (2d Cir. 1969) (transfer); Coyne v. Boyett, 490 F. Supp. 292, 295 (S.D.N.Y. 1980) (same). The National Labor Relations Act makes essentially the same distinction in excluding supervisors from its cov- erage. 29 U.S.C. ? 152(3) (1976); see NLRB v. Yeshiva Univ., 444 U.S. 672 (1980); NLRB v. Bell Aerospace Co., 416 U.S. 267 (1974). Moreover, the effect of this labor law distinction is equivalent to the constitutional cases, since unions generally demand and obtain the guarantee that their members may only be dismissed for cause. See UNITED STATES BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS, MAJOR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS, BULL. No. 1425-14, at 26 (1972). In fact, the guarantee is so universal that arbitrators generally imply its existence, even when it is not explic- itly provided in the collective bargaining agreement. See, e.g., Maclin Co., 52 Lab. Arb. (BNA) 805 (1969) (Koven, Arb.); New Hotel Showboat, Inc., 48 Lab. Arb. (BNA) 240 (1967) (Jones, Arb.); Cox, Reflections Upon Labor Arbitration, 72 HARV. L.

Second, probationary positions can be discretionary, even at the ministerial level, while permanent positions are not. This has been the effective holding of a number of federal due process cases, including Board of Regents v. Roth 514 and Perry v. Sindermann."55 What the Court perceived as creating a property interest in Sindermann's posi- tion, but not in Roth's, was nothing more than the nonprobationary nature of the latter. The rationale for these two criteria is fairly standard. Policy-level employees carry out the will of elected or appointed officials, and con- straints on their dismissal would conflict with that role. The problem is not so much that officials should be able to choose whomever they want for a given position; appointments are often subject to outside approval in American government,516 and unexplained dismissals appear to be a rare occurrence. Rather, the problem is that an employee at will is one to whom one can give orders that must be obeyed, regardless of their rationale, with dismissal serving as a sanction for refusal. Job security would disrupt this hierarchical relationship."17 But ministerial employ- ees, as we understand that term, are supposed to meet an independent standard, whether that standard is professional, as it is for a lawyer; technical, as it is for a horse trainer; or purely functional, as it is for a clerical worker. This independent standard provides a basis for objec- tive evaluation. More important, it suggests that the ministerial em- ployee's role is to carry out a predefined function, rather than to implement a political official's policies. With respect to the second criterion, the concept of a probationary appointment-necessarily at the ministerial level-results from there being more qualified applicants than available positions. The govern- ment is entitled to select the one who would function best, and this selection may involve subtle, subjective judgments that should be left to the decisionmaker's discretion. Once the employee has permanent sta- tus, however, he or she is expected to meet a defined level of behavior, 514. 408 U.S. 564 (1972). 515. 408 U.S. 593 (1972) (due process protection would be required before dismissal if college professor could establish that he had "tenure" under informal tenure system). Since the informal system did not specify any procedural requirements, or even a "cause" standard for dismissal, its only effect was to establish that certain faculty members were nonprobationary. Cf. Roth, 408 U.S. at 566-67 (respondents employed for one year; four such year-to-year appointments required for tenure). For other cases holding that probationary employees are not entitled to due process protection, see Codd v. Velger, 429 U.S. 624 (1977); Ryan v. Aurora City Bd. of Educ., 540 F.2d 222 (6th Cir. 1976), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 1041 (1977); Buhr v. Buffalo Pub. School Dist. No. 38, 509 F.2d 1196 (8th Cir. 1974). 516. See, e.g., U.S. CONST. art. II, ? 2, cl. 2. 517. See A. BICKEL, supra note 255, at 166-69, 186-87.</page><page sequence="125">1168 CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 72:1044 rather than excelling on a competitive basis. The determination that the employee has failed to achieve that level must generally be based on articulated criteria. The third criterion-the sensitivity of the position-is directed to- ward the nature of the government activity that the employee is carry- ing out, rather than to the employee's status or position. Certain functions, such as national security or public safety, may be sufficiently sensitive so as to warrant a more discretionary regime. Such was the Supreme Court's implication in Cafeteria &amp; Restaurant Workers Union, Local 473 v. McElroy,"'8 although the Court based its decision on the proprietary nature of the government facility involved.519 The point is that the ministerial and nonprobationary criteria should probably oper- ate only as rebuttable presumptions that the government could over- come by showing that a firing was essential to the sensitive activity the employee was carrying out. But since the sensitivity claim will always be advanced, it must be carefully evaluated. The Cafeteria Workers opinion, for example, grants the government too much, since there was no indication that the dismissed employee, a cook, had any connection with the facility's national security function.520 In the final analysis, there is an undeniable tension between the government's overarching power, which demands the imposition of procedural protection, and its role as employer, which demands flexi- bility and dispatch. The value of fairness to public employees is coun- terbalanced by the value of efficiency in government operations, which involves fairness to the public-at-large. Nonetheless, this sensitive function criterion should be narrowly construed. While the Constitution should not be read to sacrifice prac- ticality on an altar of principle, the marginal increase in procedural requirements that a federal standard would entail hardly represents a prescription for disaster. In fact, we do not really know whether the unconstrained power to dismiss employees is more or less efficient than the imposition of procedural protections. It does bring with it the pos- 518. 367 U.S. 886 (1961). 519. Id. at 896. The case does contain some references to national security, see id. at 887 (facility in question engaged in "development of weapons systems of a highly classified nature"), although the Court did not rely on this consideration explicitly. Certainly, the Court's proprietary notion sweeps too broadly, at least in view of subsequent decisions. See, e.g., Memphis Light, Gas &amp; Water Div. v. Craft, 436 U.S. 1 (1978) (municipal utility subject to due process restraint); Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593 (1972) (state college subject to due process restraint). Several com- mentators have argued for a variant of this notion, proposing that due process restraints apply to the government when it functions as a monopolist. See Terrel, supra note 5, at 901-11; Williams, supra note 5, at 23-24. 520. It also treats the plaintiff's interest in her job rather off-handedly. Cafeteria Workers, 367 U.S. at 898-99. Perhaps it is difficult for someone whose job security is guaranteed by the Consti- tution to empathize with a cook.</page><page sequence="126">1984] ADMINISTRATIVE DUE PROCESS 1169 sibility of rapid, decisive action and a decrease in administrative costs, as well as avoiding the limitations on the state's substantive program that procedural protections can involve. But it also creates the danger that errors will be made; that competent employees will be dismissed erroneously; that their replacements will be inexperienced and expen- sive to train; that the remaining employees will become demoralized, risk averse or job-security obsessed; and that new employees will be more difficult to attract-especially at government salaries. And in the final analysis, it should be recognized that a federal standard would not trench on the state's basic power to control its employees. The state could still establish any standard for dismissal it desired and exercise significant control over the dismissal procedure. All a federal standard would require is that the state articulate standards for ministerial, non- probationary employees in nonsensitive areas, and provide minimum procedures to ensure that a dismissal conformed with those standards. The implications of the opposite position-that public employ- ment should not be governed by due process-are presented by Judge Posner's dissenting opinion in Vail v. Board of Education.52' In firing an athletic coach, apparently in violation of a two-year employment commitment, a school breached its employment contract with the coach. This is no different, Judge Posner argues, from the breach of any other contract, such as a contract with "a supplier of paper clips."522 To advance this idea, Judge Posner struggled with the minor awkwardness of a direct Supreme Court holding that a permanent, in- formal employment contract is entitled to due process protection,523 but he avoided the major awkwardness that due process concerns the state qua state. If the state is permitted to act as a private contracting party-which is the case when it buys paper clips-then no process is due. But that is precisely the issue in public employment cases: should the state be treated as a private party, or should it be treated as the state? It is in the difference between the state and private parties, and between human beings and paper clips, that the argument for proce- dural protection for government employees resides. As with benefit terminations,524 the timing of the hearing would be 521. 706 F.2d 1435, 1449 (7th Cir. 1983) (Posner, J., dissenting), aff'd by an equall divided Court, 104 S. Ct. 2144 (1984) (per curiam). 522. Id. at 1449 (Posner, J., dissenting). 523. See Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 599-603 (1972). Judge Posner's argument is that Sindermann involved tenure, a lifelong right that is more akin to property than a contract. Vail, 706 F.2d at 1451 (Posner, J., dissenting) (discussing distinction between property and contract). But all Sindermann had was a contract, and an implied contract at that. Sindermann, 408 U.S. at 599-600. Some professors may have tenure through programs so definitive and well established that their tenured position can be called property, but that hardly seems like a proper characteri- zation of Sindermann's rights. 524.

While an em- ployee can be fully compensated for loss of salary by a subsequent award of money damages, the injury to reputation, the loss of work experience, and the disruption of career advancement lie beyond the power of a court to remedy in full. The need for a prior hearing will depend on the relative strength of these considerations. This, in turn, would seem to depend on the nature of the employee's position. 3. Negative Consequences or Burdens The third category of administrative actions is the distribution of negative consequences or burdens. The criminal law belongs in this category, of course, but its due process aspects are fully developed outside the administrative context. Most regulatory decisions can also be placed in this category in the sense that they impose limits or obliga- tions on those to whom they apply but economic regulation has not been an important source of modem due process cases.525 A much less important type of administratively imposed burden, but one that has figured prominently in recent due process cases, is the circulation of an "undesirables" list. The cases have involved the list- ing of active shoplifters, excessive drinkers, labor racketeers, and polit- ical subversives.526 According to the state standard, such a list could be circulated without any due process protection provided that there is a statute or regulation stating that an agency may, in its unfettered dis- cretion, list people as undesirables. 525. Often, regulation occurs by means of general rules for which due process limits are not relevant. See supra notes 328-55 and accompanying text; see, e.g., Texaco, Inc. v. Short, 454 U.S. 516 (1982) (sustaining state regulation of mineral interests); United States v. Florida E. Coast Ry., 410 U.S. 224 (1973) (sustaining regulation of rental rates for railway cars throughout railroad industry); North Am. Co. v. SEC, 327 U.S. 686 (1946) (sustaining general prohibition against ownership of more than one public utility system). Those decisions that are adjudicatory in na- ture frequently involve traditional forms of property, where the applicability of due process in general, and the trial model in particular, is not open to doubt. See, e.g., Crowell v. Benson, 285 U.S. 22 (1932) (compensation award); ICC v. Louisville &amp; N. R.R., 227 U.S. 88 (1913) (rateset- ting). Many adjudications, moreover, are governed by statutory schemes, such as the Administra- tive Procedure Act, ch. 324, 60 Stat. 237 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 5 U.S.C.), that provide at least as much procedural protection as the Constitution. Finally, since many regu- lations are purely economic in effect, the boundaries of governmental power, whether generally or specifically applied, are often tested under the just compensation clause rather than the due pro- cess clause. See, e.g., Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U.S. 419 (1982) (chal- lenge on just compensation grounds to law requiring landlords to permit installation of cable television wires in residential buildings); City of Pittsburgh v. Alco Parking Corp., 417 U.S. 369 (1974) (challenge on just compensation grounds to 20% tax on gross receipts of parking lots); Goldblatt v. Town of Hempstead, 369 U.S. 590 (1962) (challenge on just compensation grounds to prohibition of mining activities). 526. Paul v. Davis, 424 U.S. 693 (1976) (active shoplifters); Wisconsin v. Constantineau, 400 U.S. 433 (1971) (excessive drinkers); Jenkins v. McKeithen, 395 U.S. 411 (1969) (labor racketeers); United States ex rel. Accardi v. Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260 (1954) (general undesirables); Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Comm. v. McGrath, 341 U.S. 123 (1951) (political subversives).</page><page sequence="128">1984] ADMINISTRATIVE DUE PROCESS 1171 The federal standard would prohibit statutes or regulations of this nature. Listing a person as an undesirable is a governmental action that lies somewhere between indictment and conviction. Like both, it is accusatory, and it shares with the latter the claim that the govern- mental announcement represents the actual state of affairs.527 Our gen- eral view is that such action should not be discretionary. It should be based-indeed it virtually asserts that it is based-on a clear finding that the person listed possesses the announced characteristic. An ad- ministrator's intuitive sense that the person belongs on the list is not an acceptable basis for action of this nature.528 Thus, according to the federal standard, the equivalent of a civil trial should be required before the government lists a person as an undesirable. The argument could even be made for a criminal trial equivalent under certain circumstances.529 527. This characterization distinguishes the promulgation of an undesirables list from the publicity given to a person in the course of investigatory hearings. Such investigations may pro- ceed without procedural protections for the persons being investigated. See, e.g., Hannah v. Larche, 363 U.S. 420 (1960) (investigation of voting registrars); Uphaus v. Wyman, 360 U.S. 72 (1959) (investigation of suspected subversives). Of course, there may be a point at which the investigation becomes nothing more than a subterfuge for the announcement of names in conjunc- tion with an undesirable trait. That is a determination that the courts must make in each case. 528. In several cases, courts have held that a person may not be debarred from bidding on government contracts without due process, see, e.g., Old Dominion Dairy Prods., Inc. v. Secretary of Defense, 631 F.2d 953 (D.C. Cir. 1980); Gonzalez v. Freeman, 334 F.2d 570 (D.C. Cir. 1964), despite the view that there is no "right" to do business with the government, see, e.g., Perkins v. Lukens Steel Co., 310 U.S. 113 (1940). The reason is that the debarment cases really involve undesirables lists, not denials of benefits. The awarding of a contract is the sort of benefit that can legitimately be made discretionary, since the government may be seeking excellence-the most desirable bid. (Of course, if bidding rules have been established, they should be followed. See, e.g., B.K. Instrument, Inc. v. United States, 715 F.2d 713 (2d Cir. 1983)). But debarment from all contracting goes much further than mere denial of a contract. First, it denies the contractor a valuable opportunity to compete for future contracts. Cf. Eisenberg, supra note 401, at 649-51 (value of opportunity). Such opportunities, unlike the contract itself, are not inherently limited in number and are properly based on eligibility, rather than excellence, criteria. Second, debarment identifies the contractor as having committed a wrongful act of some sort, and thus imposes a stigma equivalent to that involved in the other undesirables list cases. 529. A case that has not arisen, but is worth considering, is a "desirables" list, such as a list of recommended products or government-approved physicians. According to a federal standard, the due process analysis of such a list would depend upon the implications of the government's description and the nature of the listing function. A list that simply recommended names-for example, knowledgeable experts in a certain field--could be promulgated within an administra- tive agency's unfettered discretion. As the list moved closer to a certificate of competence-for example, all doctors in a given area whose services are recommended-the need for preexisting standards and procedural protection would become more insistent. Only the equivalent of civil trial would be required, even for definitive recommendations based on competence, since exclu- sion from a desirables list would not create a stigma of the magnitude involved in criminal convic- tion. Another difference between lists of desirables and undesirables would involve the timing of the hearing. For an undesirables list, the hearing would be required before the list was promul- gated. The injury to individual interest is one that cannot be fully compensated by a money judgment. Nor would retraction compensate the person, since most of the damage is done when</page><page sequence="129">1172 CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 72:1044 Another type of burden that administrative agencies impose is the institutionalization of the individual. The prototypical institutionaliza- tion in nonadministrative law is imprisonment, and some general crite- ria for required minimum procedures can be derived from that example. Our basic sense of fairness, codified in numerous constitu- tional provisions, is that imprisonment requires an elaborate set of pro- cedural protections, including criminal trial. The federal standard would require that institutionalizations equivalent to prison, in that they are designed to punish a person for a blameworthy act, be subject to precisely the same protections. This is certainly the law at present.530 A general rule declaring that dangerous individuals could be placed in administrative incarceration for six months at the discretion of the FBI is obviously unconstitutional, although it does not violate the state standard for minimum procedures. A somewhat different case is presented by institutionalizations designed to help the individual (such as compulsory education or civil commitment) and institutionalizations designed to protect society from some blameless action of the individual (such as a quarantine). The absence of blame and punishment would seem to eliminate the need for criminal trial. But at the same time, institutionalization itself seems the sort of governmental act that requires predefined rules and a pro- cess at least equivalent to civil trial. The notion that administrators could institutionalize individuals on discretionary grounds offends our sense of fairness. Again, current due process doctrine has abandoned the state standard in such cases and recognized the need for procedural protection. In fact, the Supreme Court has required something more than a civil trial in the case of civil commitment,53' which can be ex- plained on the ground that commitment bears a closer resemblance to imprisonment than other institutionalizations such as public education.532 the list is promulgated, thereby linking the person's name with the undesirable characteristic. For a desirables list, a subsequent hearing would be the most that would be required. Omission from such a list would usually result only in lost opportunities, the sort of injury that money can make good, and a subsequent amendment would essentially repair the damage from that time forward. 530. See, e.g., In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358 (1970); In re Gault, 387 U.S. 1 (1967); cf.O'Connor v. Donaldson, 422 U.S. 563 (1975) (state may not incarcerate nondangerous person in mental hospital without providing treatment). 531. See, e.g., Addington v. Texas, 441 U.S. 418 (1979) (clear and convincing evidence re- quired for commitment); cf. Vitek v. Jones, 445 U.S. 480, 496-97 (1980) (transfer of prisoner from prison to mental hospital requires appointment of advocate for indigent prisoner, in addition to standard civil-trial type protections); id. at 497-500 (Powell, J., concurring) (advocate need not be an attorney). Of the administrative due process cases decided since 1970, Vitek is notable for requiring something beyond civil-trial requirements. Again, commitment to a mental institution was the crucial factor. 532. Placement in public schools generally does not require procedural protection because it is achieved by means of general rules. See, e.g., CAL. EDUC. CODE ? 48200 (West 1978). How-</page><page sequence="130">1984] ADMINISTRATIVE DUE PROCESS 1173 As for timing, it seems obvious that the hearing must come before institutionalization. The only exception would be when the purpose of institutionalizing the individual was to remove an immediate, demon- strable danger. In those cases, the best examples being communicable disease or violent behavior indicating mental instability, it seems fair for the government to act first since delay would frustrate the purpose of the institutionalization. The government would be obligated, how- ever, to hold a subsequent hearing as soon as possible after the institutionalization. 4. The Operation of Institutions The last category of administrative action is the regulation of the individual in government-run institutions such as prisons, mental hos- pitals, and schools. The general purpose of the institution is a matter of substantive law, and thus largely beyond the reach of procedural re- straints. But in the course of running such an institution, state officials necessarily make numerous adjudicative decisions-that is, decisions singling out specific individuals. As previously noted, these decisions do not fit comfortably into the familiar model of adjudications, which are conceived of as discrete, time-delimited events.533 The source of the difference, of course, is that noninstitutionalized citizens are infrequently subjected to governmental determinations, while those in institutions are under constant governmental supervi- sion. Thus, placement in an institution-a discrete event-can be treated as part of the general category of state-imposed burdens, whereas intra-institutional decisions must necessarily be analyzed in different terms. Nonetheless, decisions made by institutional supervi- sors regarding particular individuals are, in fact, adjudications, and any comprehensive theory of procedural due process must address them. Institutional cases have been a major source of Supreme Court procedural due process decisions during the last decade.534 The Court's approach has been largely based on the state standard. Again, ever, if a child alleged that he or she was outside the defined category and thus should not be required to attend, a trial or its equivalent would be required on the matter. Such hearings are rare because application of most school attendance statutes is relatively straightforward. If the state's rule were that all children whose home environment was not providing an adequate educa- tion must attend, application of the statute would be anything but straightforward and hearings would be held all the time. 533.

Unfortunately, a federal standard is somewhat more difficult to articulate in this area, due to the novelty of applying due process stan- dards to institutional management, and the resulting absence of com- mon law precedents. But nothing suggests that the standard could not be developed. The same unfamiliarity with the institutional context made adaptation of the trial model to school suspensions more difficult, but the Court solved the problem with one of its genuine doctrinal suc- cesses: the consultative process of Goss v. Lopez.535 In actuality, the Court has also been working toward limiting discretion in the interpre- tation of inherently ambiguous state laws. Its decisions, plus some sup- positions about our general notions of fairness, are sufficient to outline at least the rough contours of a federal standard for intra-institutional adjudications. First, institutional administrators must be afforded discretion in their day-to-day activities. The creation of a government-run institu- tion implies social approval of the on-going supervision of individual citizens by state agents. To require that every supervisory action follow predefined rules and be accompanied by procedural protection would do more than make the institution impossible to operate. It would be a rejection of the basic concept. Prison officials must have discretion to determine when prisoners may congregate and when they must dis- perse; school teachers must be able to decide when students should an- swer a question or fail a test.536 At the other extreme, granting supervisors absolute discretion would violate most people's notion of fair treatment. This is certainly true with respect to schools and mental institutions, where arbitrary action could turn the experience into the equivalent of punishment for (prison); Goss v. Lopez, 419 U.S. 565 (1975) (public school); Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539 (1974) (prison). 535. 419 U.S. 565 (1975); see supra notes 468-69 and accompanying text. For an effort to adapt traditional due process notions-such as notice, a hearing and an impartial deci- sionmaker-to the institutional context, see Rubin, supra note 466. 536. The Court has certainly been sensitive to this consideration. See, e.g., Board of Curators v. Horowitz, 435 U.S. 78, 90 (1978) ("We decline to further enlarge the judicial presence in the academic community and thereby risk deterioration of many beneficial aspects of the faculty- student relationship."); Meachum v. Fano, 427 U.S. 215, 228-29 (1976) ("Holding that [prison transfers] are within the reach of the procedural protections of the Due Process Clause would place the Clause astride the day-to-day functioning of state prisons and involve the judiciary in issues and discretionary decisions that are not the business of federal judges."); Wolff v. McDon- nell, 418 U.S. 539, 566 (1974) ("We should not be too ready to exercise oversight and put aside the judgment of prison administrators. . . . The operation of a correctional institute is at best an extraordinarily difficult undertaking.").</page><page sequence="132">1984] ADMINISTRA TIVE DUE PROCESS 1175 the individuals involved.537 In recent years, this prohibition on unfet- tered discretion has been extended to prisons. The post-Roth Court's clearest adoption of an absolute federal standard came in two prison cases, Vitek v. Jones538 and Hewitt v. Helms.539 Moreover, several opinions have sought to limit supervisory discretion by declaring that constitutional rights in general do not stop at the "prison door" or the "schoolhouse gate."'54 The metaphor suggests that the Supreme Court itself has felt compelled to enter what it previously regarded as a closed system, to impose constraints on the way institutional officials treat their charges. Between these outer limits on discretion and constraint, one can discern certain characteristic situations that seem to demand proce- dural protection. One is the imposition of unusual discipline. Teachers tell schoolchildren to be quiet every day, and prison officials lock the cell doors every night. Such discipline as this falls into the category of routine action, of necessity left to official discretion. It is less common for a child to be sent out of the room or a prisoner to be denied visiting privileges, although these are still fairly routine. But it is the extreme, unusual sanction that carries with it the greatest potential for oppres- sion and for arbitrary or vindictive behavior. Solitary confinement in the prison context, the issue in Hewitt v. Helms,54' and corporal punish- ment in school, the issue in Ingraham v. Wright,542 are two of the most notable examples. Of course, both methods of discipline have become unusual only relatively recently. This means that the criterion suggested here would not have required procedural protection in the harsher era when soli- tary confinement was standard prison practice and schoolchildren were struck as regularly as churchbells. Perhaps that seems unsatisfactory, 537. See Donaldson v. O'Connor, 493 F.2d 507, 520 (5th Cir. 1974) (mental institution), va- cated and remanded on other grounds, 422 U.S. 563 (1975); Rubin, supra note 466, at 81-85. In holding that corporal punishment of school children was not "punishment" in the eighth amend- ment sense, the Court emphasized the constraints on official discretion that existed in that context. Justice Powell observed that "[t]he openness of the public school and its supervision by the com- munity afford significant safeguards against the kinds of abuses from which the Eighth Amend- ment protects the prisoner." Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U.S. 651, 670 (1977). 538. 445 U.S. 480 (1980). 539. 459 U.S. 460 (1983). 540. See, e.g., Tinker v. Des Moines School Dist., 393 U.S. 503, 506 (1969) ("It can hardly be argued that either students or teachers shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate."); Jackson v. Bishop, 404 F.2d 571, 576 (8th Cir. 1968) (Black- mun, J.)

As a method of discipline becomes less routine, the unfairness of its arbitrary or vindictive use increases, even though the gross amount of physical suffering that it causes will de- cline. In addition, focusing on the atypicality of the decision-the nat- ural result of a due process standard that is guided by government behavior-avoids the practical difficulties of imposing procedural re- quirements on day-to-day activities. A standard based on individual interest, which would direct attention to the harshness of the punish- ment regardless of its generality, is significantly less workable in the institutional context. Another characteristic situation that seems to demand procedural protection is the determination of the individual's basic status as a member of the institution. Examples from recent prison cases include transfer to another prison,543 transfer to a mental institution,544 cancel- lation of good time credit,545 and denial of parole.546 The major public school example is suspension or expulsion.547 These determinations bear a structural resemblance to discrete adjudicative events in a noninstitutional setting. Indeed, the denial of parole inside a prison seems functionally indistinguishable from the revocation of parole 543. See, e.g., Olim v. Wakinekona, 103 S. Ct. 1741 (1983); Meachum v. Fano, 427 U.S. 215 (1976). 544. See, e.g., Vitek v. Jones, 445 U.S. 480 (1980). 545. See, e.g., Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539 (1974). 546. See, e.g., Greenholtz v. Inmates of the Neb. Penal &amp; Correctional Complex, 442 U.S. 1 (1979); cf. Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471 (1972) (revocation of parole). Pardons, as opposed to parole, probation, or good time credit, are special cases. See Connecticut Bd. of Pardons v. Dum- schat, 452 U.S. 458 (1981). The pardon authority is traditionally viewed as purely discretionary, at least when it is exercised by the chief of state. See Schick v. Reed, 419 U.S. 256 (1974); Hoffa v. Saxbe, 378 F. Supp. 1221, 1225-33 (D.D.C. 1974). Dumschat made passing reference to the point. 452 U.S. at 464. Thus, pardon decisions would be exempt from procedural requirements under a federal standard, just as day-to-day decisions by institutional administrators would be. Modern government being what it is, however, pardon decisions are often made, at least in the first instance, by an administrative agency. See Dumschat, 452 U.S. at 460 (summarizing CONN. GEN. STAT. ?? 18-26 (1981)); CAL. PENAL CODE ? 4801 (West 1982). Under this circum- stance, the propriety of unconstrained discretion becomes questionable. Pardon determinations, which involve exit, are precisely the type of decisions that should be subject to criteria, and admin- istrative agencies-unlike the chief of state-are precisely the type of governmental action that should be so subject. According to this view, Dumschat was wrongly decided. The Connecticut Board of Pardons may not have articulated any "objective and defined criteria," 452 U.S. at 467 (Brennan, J., concurring), but it seems virtually inconceivable that it had no criteria at all. The federal standard would require that it articulate these criteria. This would leave the executive's traditional power to grant pardons at will intact, but prevent delegation of that power in its unal- loyed form. The delegation could still be made, but the agency would be required to articulate its criteria, and to grant hearings when significant questions under those criteria arose. 547.

Lopez, 419 U.S. 565 (1975).</page><page sequence="134">1984] ADMINISTRA TIVE DUE PROCESS 1177 outside it, although the Supreme Court has decided the two cases dif- ferently.548 Moreover, the content of basic status determinations in an institution is closely related to the content of the initial entry and exit determinations that ordinarily require procedural protection. Finally, these status determinations overlap substantially with the unusual dis- cipline situations, since they are often used as. severe disciplinary measures. The argument is sometimes made that basic status determinations require subtle, intuitive judgments in institutional settings, and should thus be left to official discretion.549 This can be supported by the fact that sentencing, which initially determines the length of a person's sta- tus as prisoner, is legitimately discretionary under current due process doctrine.550 But the rules that confine official discretion in institutional status determinations can leave room for subtlety, as can the minimum procedures imposed. Our developing sense of government institutions as a regime of rules, rather than as specialized preserves secure from public scrutiny, suggests that these determinations should be based on some sort of articulated criteria. The potential for oppression in uncon- trolled determinations of the individual's status seems unacceptably high. Nor are the practical problems of requiring procedures particu- larly persuasive, since status determinations are generally outside the flow of day-to-day activities. Sentencing is admittedly an important analogy for administrative determinations, but its discretionary aspect developed in contrast to the extreme formality of criminal trial. Now that a model as flexible as the consultative process55' is available, the argument for unfettered discretion seems considerably weaker. In fact, discretionary sentencing has been heavily criticized as out of step with modem legal attitudes,552 and criminal codes are now being extensively 548. Greenholtz v. Inmates of the Neb. Penal &amp; Correctional Complex, 442 U.S. 1, 9-11 (1979), held that there is no due process right to procedural protections in parole determinations (although Nebraska had created such a right by statute). Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 484 (1972), held that the due process clause requires an evidentiary hearing before parole can be re- voked. The distinction is essentially little more than the observation that the parolee already has "liberty," but the prisoner does not. See Greenholtz, 442 U.S. at 9. That does not even pass muster under an expectation theory, since prisoners expect parole if they follow the rules, while parolees cannot justifiably expect continued freedom if they break them. The real distinction is probably that the initial parole determination is inextricably tied to prison administration, while the revoca- tion decision is not. Nonetheless, a focus on the nature of the government's action with respect to the individual suggests that the two situations should not be distinguished. 549. See cases cited supra note 536. 550.

This difference illustrates the general principle for determining when minimum procedures are required in institutional contexts. But the concept of nonroutine decisions is probably too abstract to provide much guidance without some of the detail suggested above. Moreover, future cases may suggest other situations that call for minimum proce- dures. A fully articulated federal standard can be developed only if the courts begin using such a standard in deciding cases. The point here is simply to suggest that this standard can be developed fairly readily and without major dislocations in the present configuration of due process precedents. CONCLUSION In the course of articulating his jurisprudential views, Professor Dworkin has invoked a concept he calls "Hercules."554 Dworkin's Hercules is a marvelous being: a superhuman judge who can look through the tangled surface of the law into its very essence, perceive the principles that operate there, and apply them directly to the case at hand. Hercules has no need to develop legal doctrine incrementally, altering what seems outmoded while retaining the remainder. He can dispense with a confused or inadequate set of precedents entirely, and fashion a new doctrine based on the underlying verities of our legal system. The problem with Board of Regents v. Roth, Mathews v. Eldridge, and their successors is that the majority that decided them imagined itself to be Hercules. It set out to clean the Augean stables of proce- dural due process and to construct a new doctrine in the clear space that remained, based on a clean, logical elaboration of principle. Not being Hercules, the Court found itself mired in a mess, one that was substantially worse than had existed previously. It has tried to dig itself out, with decisions such as Vitek v. Jones and Hewitt v. Helms; but as Olim v. Wakinekona indicates, it keeps slipping back. This Article suggests that a more modest approach to the problem of administrative due process would have yielded more appealing re- sults. The problem the Court faced, after all, was a limited one: how to form. Emerging Legal Issues in the Individualization of Justice, 73 MICH. L.

Prior law contained numerous ideas and analogies that the Court could have used in this effort. From the loyalty-security cases it could have de- rived the notion that due process is essentially concerned with the pro- cedural fairness of governmental action, and that fairness is defined by the principles of rule obedience and minimum procedures. From ad- ministrative law, the area in which virtually all the recent cases have arisen, it could have adopted the general-specific distinction between rulemaking and adjudication as the required limit on the scope of the due process clause. From common law due process doctrine it could have derived the use of archetypes as a means of giving content to the minimum-procedures principle. It could also have derived the role of individual interest in establishing the time at which these minimum procedures are required. And from all these areas, it could have devel- oped independent federal guidelines to determine which state actions require the protection of minimum procedures. As this Article sug- gests, these approaches would produce a more coherent doctrine of procedural due process in administrative law.</page></plain_text>
