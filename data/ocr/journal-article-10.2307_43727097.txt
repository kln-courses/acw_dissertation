Tamar KAMIONKOWSKI and WONIL KIM (eds.), Bodies, Embodiment, and Theology of the Hebrew Bible (Library of Hebrew Bible/Old Testament Studies 465; London/New York: Clark, 2010). Pp. x + 250. $120. This collection of essays addresses three categories of questions: (1) How extensively do biblical authors represent God as having a human body? (2) How do bodies mediate the dynamic of the human-divine relationship? (3) How would a more expansive approach to embodiment in the Hebrew Bible impact biblical theology and contemporary religious life? Thus, the collection is divided into three sections. In section 1, "God's Biblical Bodies," the contributors tackle several biblical portrayals of God's body: Amy C. Merrill Willis, "Heavenly Bodies: God and the Body in the Visions of Daniel"; Claudia Bergmann, "'Like a Warrior' and 'Like a Woman Giving Birth': Expressing Divine Immanence and Tran- scendence in Isaiah 42:10-17"; and Ilona Zsolnay, "The Inadequacies of Yahweh: A Re- Examination of Jerusalem's Portrayal in Ezekiel 16." The essayists in section 2, "Human Biblical Bodies," assume that human biblical bodies are legitimate subjects to study, since God is often described in human terms: Jeremy Schipper, "Embodying Deuteronomistic Theology in 1 Kings 15:22-24"; Hilary Lipka, "Profaning the Body: hll and the Conception of Loss of Personal Holiness in H"; Eve Levavi Feinstein, "Sexual Pollution in the Hebrew Bible: A New Perspective"; and Matthew R. Schlimm, "Emotion, Embodiment, and Ethics: Engaging Anger in Genesis." In section 3, "Divine Bodies, Human Bodies, and Today's Reader," the contributors explore how exegetical studies grounded in historical-critical methodologies impact contemporary life: Esther J. Hamori, "Divine Embodiment in the Hebrew Bible and Some Implications for Jewish and Christian Incarnational Theologies"; Gerald West, "The Contribution of Tamar 's Story to the Construction of Alternative African Maculinities"; and Howard Schwartz, "Does God Have a Body? The Problem of Metaphor and Literal Language in Biblical Interpretation." The volume is interesting, with essays that reflect sound and careful exegesis. Merrill Willis explores the development 'n r renting God's body throughout Daniel 7-8. Describing God anthropomorphically in chap. 7 elevates the character of the righteous com- munity, while chap. 8 masks the body of God in order to suggest divine withdrawal from historical events and absence from the community. According to Bergmann, to show that the divine one "transcends genuc. the conditions of the human body" (p. 55), Isa 42:10-17 uses the similes "like a warrior" and "like a woman giving birth." The passage portrays Yhwh as all-encompassing and capable of changing the created world. In Bergmann 's interpretation, God alters circumstances dramatically, bringing something entirely new to the suffering community. Zsolnay analyzes Ezekiel 1 6, taking into account previous interpretations but bringing new persuasive depth to the idea that Yhwh resembles a domestic batterer. Schipper interprets 1 Kgs 15:22-24 in light of a Deuteronomistic perspective on the body and disability. These few verses become more comprehensible in light of Schipper 's approach. Asa's foot disease, in Deuteronomistic perspective, reflects his social and political status. Through insightful exegesis, Lipka illuminates what occurs in the Hebrew Bible when a priest or his offspring is desecrated, losing holiness and becoming profane. A lay- person can also be profaned, if that person fails in the pursuit of holy living (it is through a person's actions that holiness is lost). Through Lipka's observation that holiness can be</page><page sequence="2">COLLECTED ESSAYS 42 1 acquired, lost, and regained, she concludes that "holiness is a sort of essence that adheres to the body, and desecration is the loss of this essence. If God is the essence of holiness, and all holiness derives from God, then attaining holiness involves the incorporation of some of the divine essence" (p. 113). Lipka reaffirms the corporeal nature of holiness for the reader. Feinstein offers new insights for the topic of sexual pollution. She reminds other exegetes to reconsider previous theories on the basis of an examination of texts, for she argues that it is more useful to view "sexual pollution as an independent category" (p. 144). Because of this position, Lipka explains sexual pollution as the result of behaviors that can "ruin" the actor in some sense. Schlimm scrutinizes the nuances of anger in the Book of Genesis, revealing a varied approach to the emotion. The protagonists in Genesis use anger in a variety of ways, some of which are justifiable and helpful, while others produce serious repercussions. Schlimm maintains that anger is an integral part of embodied experience, a contention borne out by his study of biblical passages. The most intriguing section, in my view, is the final one, delving into the implications for contemporary experience of biblical portrayals of the body. Hamori analyzes the con- notations of the 3Ã®s theophany, reasoning that the Christian concept of incarnation is a natural outgrowth of the Israelite idea of God appearing "in anthropomorphically realistic form for the purpose of divine-human communication in a way that is unattested in the literature of Israel's neighbors" (pp. 180-81). West recounts in a fascinating way the role that Tamar 's story in 2 Sam 13:1-22 has played in the search for "redemptive masculinities" among Africans. Through the Tamar Contextual Bible Study and its insightful questions for small- group participants, men and women have explored how the Tamar story can inform current understandings of gender and relationships. Finally, Schwartz argues that the interpreter's decision about the biblical depiction of God's anthropomorphic body, whether it is inten- tionally literal or metaphorical, is dependent on the a priori methodological stance of the interpreter, a very important insight. The volume ventures into a neglected but intriguing area of biblical studies, and it furthers the reader's understanding of biblical divine and human bodies. It is highly recom- mended reading, especially for Hebrew Bible scholars, biblical theologians, and those who study representations of the body in ancient texts. Sarah J.
