Treasures of Cyprus As a tribute to the Bicentennial, the government of the Republic of Cyprus has sent a remarkable collection of one hundred and seventy-eight objects of ancient art to be exhibited in major cities of the United States. Treasures of Cyprus was inaugurated on November 23, 1976 at the Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C. under the sponsorship of the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service. Among the museums who will host the show are The Minneapolis Institute of Art, Minneapolis, Minnesota (July 7-August 3, 1977); Fine Arts Museum of the South, Mobile, Alabama (September 9-October 23, 1977); Columbus Gallery of Fine Arts, Columbus, Ohio (November 18-December 31, 1977); Museum of Science, Boston (January 27-March 10, 1978); Charleston Art Gallery of Sunrise, Charleston, West Virginia (April 6-May 19, 1978); and Elvehjem Art Center, Madison, Wisconsin (July 15-July 28, 1978). Nearly eight millennia are represented in this exhibition, beginning with the oldest period in the Island's prehistory, the Neolithic or "New Stone Age," which is dated by Carbon 14 to the early sixth millennium b.c. and ending with nineteenth century folk art objects. The Island of Cyprus, the third largest in the Mediterranean, has had a long and adventurous history often conditioned by her strategic position in the eastern Mediterranean and by her wealth in copper. These two factors made Cyprus attractive to her mighty neighbors, who could easily dominate the Island. This historical destiny of Cyprus has characterized her artistic production, particularly during the Early Bronze Age, dating to the third millennium onward, when she started receiving influences from the neighboring countries. Ten objects from the Neolithic period constitute an important part of this exhibit since they are being shown in the United States for the first time. The rich Cypriote collections in American museums, mainly that of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, were formed at the end of the nineteenth century, well before objects dating to the Neolithic period were discovered some forty years ago. These early artifacts do not ¡n vitality and charm, although Cyprus s isolated during the three thousand years of the Stone Age. Grey river stones were used for making vessels, tools and anthropomorphic idols. The latter may well constitute the earliest phase of European sculpture. Using other stones as tools (metal was discovered three thousand years later during the Bronze Age) the Cypriote craftsman produced elegant stone bowls with thin walls, spouts and handles, which could be functional but which also please the eye with their graceful outlines and smooth surfaces. The Neolithic sculptor conceived of the human body as a highly stylized form with simplified facial characteristics and a flat violin-shaped body, not only recalling the marble idols of Cycladic art but also the tendencies of modern sculpture. Similar inclinations, though slightly more sophisticated, may be observed in the minor sculpture of the Chalcolithic period dating to the middle of the third millennium b.c. when steatite (a grey-green stone with a hard smooth texture) was used to produce cruciform idols. An impressive number of sculptures and vases of this period have come to light in recent years, mainly as a result of tomblooting in the western part of Cyprus. The period best illustrated in the exhibition is the Early Bronze Age, covering the end of the third and the beginning of the second millennium. Red-Polished and Black-Polished vases and terracotta figurines inspired by foreign influence highlight this period. During the Early Bronze Age Cyprus started exploiting her copper mines with far-reaching results for the economic, social and cultural development of her inhabitants. Copper replaced stone in the production of tools and weapons and was also exported to the Near East and Aegean. As a result, the Cypriots became prosperous and foreign contact opened new cultural horizons for their society. New artistic and religious ideas appear in the art of Cyprus, often influenced by the culture of Bronze Age Anatolia, with whom there must have been close links. There is exuberance and imagination in the forms of the Red-Polished vases which display a variety of incised and relief decoration. Some of the bowls are composite and others are richly decorated with figures around the rim. Impressive conical bowls and other exotic forms, which are usually associated with ritual, could perhaps owe their peculiarity to the desire of the potter to impress his clientele with 132</page><page sequence="2">Askos of fìed-Polished III ware in the form of a quadruped (donkey?). Height 10.5 cms.; Early Cypriote III. unusual forms. Flat terracottas, some of them with two necks and heads, are richly decorated with incisions; they may be models of larger wooden idols (xoana), which were placed in sanctuaries. Several of these clay models were found in tombs and dedicated to divinities associated with fertility. Three admirable plank-shaped idols are also included in the exhibit. No less vivid are the zoomorphic vases which demonstrate a spirit and sense of humor that are the main characteristics of Cypriote art throughout the ages. The cosmopolitan spirit which dominated Cypriote politics during the Late Bronze Age, dated to the second half of the second millennium b.c., is reflected in the art of this period. The Mycenaeans, first as traders and craftsmen and then as colonists, found their way to the shores of Cyprus. The Cyprus Museum in Nicosia possesses some of the finest examples of Mycenaean pottery in the world, some of which are included in the exhibition. Vases and other artifacts imported from the Near East or made under the influence of the Orient are to be found side by side with the Aegean works of art. The artistic creations of Cyprus herself are equally significant: bronze stands, terracotta figurines of the nude female goddess of fertility (who will become Astarte and Aphrodite in later times), vases of exceptional ceramic skill and beauty, constitute the Island's contribution to the art of the Late Bronze Age. One of Cyprus' most precious documents, the clay cylinder tablet which is inscribed with over two hundred signs of the so-called Cypro-Minoan script, is also in the exhibit. This is the only complete inscribed document discovered in Cyprus so far. Unfortunately its secrets still remain undeciphered despite numerous efforts to translate the text. The eleventh century b.c. initiates the Iron Age and forms a transitional bridge from the Bronze Age. Some recently discovered vases recalling the ceramic styles of Sub-Minoan Crete and Sub-Mycenaean Greece are to be found among the artifacts of this period. The fully developed Iron Age, represents the genuine face of Cypriote art which is based on the experience of the Bronze Age and elements from the Orient and Occident.

The vases of the pictorial style, decorated with birds, flowers and quadrupeds show a high artistic skill in stylization, an exuberance of color and a lively sense of humor. These vases are now considered some of the finest contributions of Cyprus to Mediterranean art and the traveling exhibition is adequately furnished with a representative group. Another class of objects which is prominent in the exhibit is the terracotta figurines of the Archaic period: the goddess with uplifted arms, recalling the well known divinity of Crete, priestesses of Aphrodite in the nude or clad with hieratic garments, votive figurines holding musical instruments or offerings to the god, armed soldiers, and horse riders. Some limestone heads of the end of the Archaic period illustrate the last phase of the liveliness of Cypriote art. In the Classical period, dating from the beginning of the fifth century b.c. onward, the culture is conditioned by a continuous battle for freedom from the Persian yoke. The works of Greek art offer prototypes in sculpture and the other arts and crafts, but the provincial Cypriote artisans could never match the perfection of classical Greece. Cyprus did not, however, lack monumental architecture during the Greek and subsequent Hellenistic and Roman periods. Sites such as the Palace of Vouni and the remains of Salamis and Kourion provide ample testimony to a distinct Cypriote style. A group of mediaeval glazed vases, mainly "marriage bowls," remind one of the Frankish rule over Cyprus at the time of the Crusades. The famous Gothic cathedrals of Famagusta and Nicosia, now both turned into mosques, and the castles on the summits of the Kyrenia mountain range were built by the Lusignans at this time. Interestingly, the figured decoration of these bowls bears a striking resemblance to the drawings of Picasso and other masters of contemporary art. } Finally, a collection of jewelry and folk art represent the final phase in this exhibition of eight thousand years of artistic creation. As long as life continues in Cyprus, the artistic creation of this small island will always be a challenge to the art historian and a treat for the lover of art because of its freshness, internationalism and originality.
