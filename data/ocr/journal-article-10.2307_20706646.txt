<plain_text><page sequence="1">SETTLEMENT PATTERN ARCHAEOLOGY IN THE SOUTHERN COOK ISLANDS: A REVIEW Richard Walter University of Otago INTRODUCTION The development of professional archaeology in the Pacific coincided with the emergence of settlement pattern analysis as a major paradigm in North American archaeology. Under the influence of early proponents such as Gordon Willey and K.C. Chang its introduction into the Pacific is closely associated with Roger Green and his pioneering work in Mo'orea (Green 1961). Since the 1960s, it has fluctuated in popularity, but there has been a steady flow of publications, especially from Hawai'i and New Zealand. The major thread which holds together what is actually a very diverse range of ideas is an interest in site distribution in relation to geographic, social and economic variables. Apart from an intrinsic interest in the issues raised by settlement pattern archaeology, there are also peripheral attractions which have contributed to the prevalence of this approach. First, the emphasis on survey and mapping of surface features means that adequate data for a worthwhile project can be collected reasonably economically. Not only is this important for archaeologists working on islands far from their institutional base but it also accounts for the number of such studies produced as graduate research projects by students in Hawai'i and New Zealand. Second, the importance of field surveys for development planning and cultural resource management means that there has been considerable demand and financial support for these types of study. Third, the gathering of settlement pattern data provides an excellent baseline for other types of archaeological analysis. As Green put it in 1970, 'these programs neither ignore other aims and orientations, nor fail to provide most of the additional data they require' (Green 1970:13). Summaries of progress in Polynesian settlement pattern archaeology have been produced regularly over the years (Green 1967,1984, 1993; Kirch 1982, 1989) and a number of trends are discernible. The most significant developments over the last decade have seen settlement pattern archaeology appropriate more of the theory and methods of a wider school of spatial analysis, as well as expand the frames of reference to include symbolic and ideational views. Green now advocates what he calls 'landscape archaeology' which incorporates all elements 'from the environmental to the symbolic' and which he feels has a strong and vital role to play in Polynesia for some time (Green 1993). 63</page><page sequence="2">64 Richard Walter Archaeology in the Cook Islands commenced with two large reconnais sance projects carried out by the Canterbury Museum and the University of Auckland in the 1960s and early 1970s (Trotter 1974a, Bellwood 1978). These projects resulted in the first summary of site variation and distribution in the archipelago and provided the basis for the first settlement pattern studies (Bellwood 1969,1971). Following these projects there was a period of inactivity in archaeological research until the mid-1980s. Since then sequences for a number of islands have been proposed (Allen and Steadman 1990, Chikamori and Yoshida 1988, Walter 1993), interpretations of colo nisation, culture change and the place of the Cook Islands within the wider arena of Pacific prehistory have taken place (Walter 1990), and palaeo environmental studies have been incorporated into a number of ongoing research programmes (Kirch and Ellison 1994, Kirch et al. 1991, Kirch et al. 1992) . One result of this resurgence of interest is a better understanding of the nature of the archaeological record: the range of sites present on the landscape and their environmental context. In this paper I summarise the site and settlement data from the Southern Cook Islands and discuss progress in settlement pattern analysis. My conclusions are that Cook Islands settlement pattern archaeology is underdeveloped, both substantively and theoretically. In the course of this summary I will highlight some outstanding issues in Southern Cook Islands settlement archaeology, summarise some recent research and outline a number of potentially rewarding directions for future work. THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL RECORD The Cook Islands consists of two groups: seven atolls make up the Northern Cook Islands and in the Southern Cook group there are six inhabited and two uninhabited islands (Manuae and Takutea). The Southern islands comprise the high volcanic island of Rarotonga, four raised coral reef islands (Mangaia, Atiu, Mitiaro and Ma'uke), an atoll (Manuae), a cay (Takutea) and a near atoll (Aitutaki) (Fig. 1). Each island has its own traditional political organisation based on the ariki system as described by Crocombe (1964). The islands of Atiu, Ma'uke and Mitiaro are known collectively as Ngaputoru and form a loose unity within which the major lineages and political titles are closely related (Siikala 1991). In the Southern islands site surveys have been carried out on Rarotonga (Bellwood 1969,1978, Duff 1965, Trotter 1974a), Aitutaki (Bellwood 1969, 1978, Trotter 1974a), Mangaia (Bellwood 1978), Ma'uke (Walter 1990, 1993) , Atiu (Trotter 1974a) and are currently in progress on Mitiaro (see below). The sites fall into seven broad categories: marae, paepae, agri</page><page sequence="3">Settlement Pattern Archaeology in the Southern Cook Islands 65 10?S I I I 165?W 160?W 155?W 0 Tongarava Rakahanga 10?S?] o Mani hi ki Pukapuka o * Nassau 0 Suwarrow COOK ISLANDS I5?s4 Aitutaki &amp; Manuae o Takutea. 0Mitiar0 Atiu 0 Ma'uke Rarotonga 0 Mangaia 165?W 160?W _I_I_ Fig. 1 Location map of the Cook Islands cultural sites, rockshelters, burials, stratified habitation sites and special function sites. Marae Southern Cook Island marae tend to be smaller and less complex than those found elsewhere in East Polynesia but there is surprising variability in form both within and between islands. The closest parallels to the Rarotongan marae lie in the pavement and ahu structures of the Society Islands (Bell wood 1971:147). The most detailed descriptions of marae are from the upper</page><page sequence="4">66 Richard Walter Fig. 2 Type 1 mame (RAR 51/1), Lower Maungaroa Cluster, Rarotonga (after Bellwood 1978: Fig. 5) slopes of the Maungaroa Valley. There Bellwood (1969) described six marae 'types', each defined according to a combination of variables such as terracing, pavements, platforms and uprights (Table 1). The marae are rectangular in form but differ widely in size with a range between about 30 m2 and 600 m2 and averaging approximately 140 m2. Most contain an area of stone-paved or coral-strewn courtyard, many contain platforms or ahu and most contain one or more stone uprights (Fig. 2). The Maungaroa classification accommodates most but not all Rarotongan marae. Many lowland forms are larger and more complex, with a greater number and range of internal attributes and ancillary features. Some of the larger sites are better described</page><page sequence="5">Settlement Pattern Archaeology in the Southern Cook Islands 67 Fig. 3 Manuka marne (RAR 22), Tupapa District, Rarotonga (from Wilkes 1974: Fig. 15) as ceremonial complexes consisting of low curbing enclosing stone alignments, courtyards, platforms, pavements and sometimes burials (Fig. 3). Rarotongans distinguish a particular site type falling into this category as koutu which were the traditional investiture places of the ariki (Parker 1974:28) and the best known of these is Arai-te-Tonga. This site contains curbing enclosing a rectangular area of at least 4000 m2 although the ceremonial part of the compound, the marae proper, is much smaller consisting of a stone paved ahu of about 30 m2 and several adjacent uprights (Fig. 4). Topography plays a major role in the variation between the coastal marae and those of the Maungaroa Valley (Bellwood 1969:524), but social differences and functional variables are also relevant.</page><page sequence="6">68 Richard Walter Fig. 4 Koutu site, Arai-te-Tonga (RAR 19), Tupapa District, Rarotonga (from Duff 1974: Fig. 4)</page><page sequence="7">Settlement Pattern Archaeology in the Southern Cook Islands 69 A1 T-shaped pavement A2 Square, rectangular of L-shaped pavement A3 Simple stone-faced earthern terrace A4 Stone-faced eathern terrace with paved verandah 1 Terraced with four steps B2 Terraced with two steps 3 Rectangular pavement with single upright B4 Rectangular pavement with single stone platform B5 Coral gravel pavement with several uprights and stone platforms B6 Stone-faced earthern terrace with multiple uprights Table 1. Stone Structures of the Maungaroa Valley (after Bell wood 1978) The marae of Aitutaki show little superficial similarity to those of Rarotonga and are characterised by the use of large stone uprights arranged in small groups or parallel rows (Duff 1965:58). Bellwood (1969) has provided a basic typology of marae and paepae of Aitutaki (Table 2). Of the five marae 'types' only the D5 structures, consisting of rectangular paving, bear any strong resemblance to Rarotongan forms and unfortunately none survive (Bellwood 1969:526). Other marae described by Bellwood consist of various arrangements of upright stones, atarau or a combination of both these structural elements (Fig. 5). The term atarau is used by Bellwood (following Buck 1944:308) as equivalent to ahu in the Society Islands context, that is, as the central platform on a marae (Bellwood 1978:93). However, several of the marae on Aitutaki contain features which differ significantly from the 'normal' ahu form. The D3 marae for example is defined as 'a group of structures corresponding to the atarau described by Buck' but the atarau on some D3 marae are rectangular cists of flat upright slabs of which the interior is left empty (Bellwood 1969:526). Bellwood suggests that these cists are structurally related to the Society Island (or Rarotongan) ahu form and cites examples from Emory (1933) in support. The Emory examples, however, do have an infilled interior thus forming a functioning platform although they are lower than the top of the walling (Emory 1933:Plates 16 and 17). The ahu is designed as a stable platform and if the Aitutaki structures are equivalent their interiors must have been denuded since construction. While this is possible, I suggest these may be a unique Cook Island monu mental form which had quite a different function from the ahu or atarau. This type of structure is also common on Mitiaro and contrasts there with the more standard ahu which are also present (see below). Atiu too has a characteristic stone structure which may be related to these Aitutaki types (see below). Paepae Marae</page><page sequence="8">70 Richard Walter Paepae Cl Entertainment house ('Are Karioi) C2 Dwelling paepae Marae Dl Single or paired uprights D2 Alignments of standing stones D3 Atarau of orthostatic construction D4 Alignments and atarau D5 Rectangular pavement Table 2. Stone Structures of Aitutaki (after Bellwood 1978) The most distinctive characteristic of Atiu marae is the use of large stalactites and flat slabs of limestone. Flat sheets of limestone occur naturally in several locales on Atiu and from these quarries the Atiuans cut slabs, shaped them with square sides, and sometimes incorporated anthropomor phic profiles into the final product (Trotter 1974b: 109). The slabs used are usually about 25 cm thick and up to 2 m in length. Although fewer than 10 marae have been recorded on Atiu those few show a diversity of shapes and sizes. Several marae consist of rectangular alignments of coral rocks enclosing areas of scattered coral gravel and ranging from 60 m2 to 400 m2 in size. Within the central courtyard stalactite uprights are sometimes found, either as isolated features or in simple alignments. Marae of this sort include Orongo (AT 11), one of the components of the Marau (AT 9) complex, and perhaps also Apiripiri (AT 16) (Trotter 1974b: 112). In addition to these, the Marau complex contains a square platform measuring 6 m by 6 m in size and lm high infilled with coral gravel (Fig. 6). The sides of this structure have been plastered in the historic era but it is undoubtedly of original prehistoric construction. Adjacent to the platform are five quadrangular or square enclosures made of limestone slabs and large stalactites. Like the cists of Aitutaki these have a hollow interior and are clearly not ahu. The most impressive marae on Atiu is Vairakaia (Site 20). This consists of a long slightly concave wall of about 50 limestone slabs retaining a coral strewn platform of about 500 m2 (Trotter 1974b:Fig. 50). The slabs rise above the level of the platform and several have anthropomorphic shapes cut into their upper surface. On the slope behind the platform living terraces have been cut into the hillside (see Fig. 9 below). Ma'uke marae are all badly damaged but it is clear that monumental stone work construction was not as highly developed there as on the other islands. Low square platforms infilled with coral pebbles of a style similar, though on a much smaller scale, to the Marau ahu on Atiu seem to have been the basic model, a form shared also with Mangaia (see below). As part of Ngaputoru, Ma'uke politics were tied very closely to those of Atiu, the dominant member</page><page sequence="9">Settlement Pattern Archaeology in the Southern Cook Islands 71 JJ 1 ! _^&lt;3 S lu pC&lt;?O / y &gt; ?

However, the contrast between Ma'uke and Mitiaro is startling. Mitiaro is the most impoverished and the least powerful island of the Ngaputoru group and its population smaller. Yet there, marae construction was surprisingly well developed. An archaeologi cal programme is currently in progress and a full description of Mitiaro stone structures will be forthcoming; a brief summary here will suffice. Inland marae come in two basic forms. In the first, low alignments of coral rubble enclose small platforms and uprights. Elsewhere there are coral lined platforms of about lm in height enclosing areas of up to about 500 m2 and with uprights or flat coral slabs of ceremonial significance. On the coast, complexes of structures include stone curbing and the open, coral cists similar to those of Aitutaki and measuring about 2 by 3 m and up to 1 m in height. A coastal structure similar to the Rarotongan, Type B4, quadrangular pavement with ahu and uprights is also noted. This marae, Te Rua Roa, measures approximately 115 m2 in area. Mangaian marae vary in size and construction methods but are all based on the model of a raised platform with coral slab facings (Bellwood 1978:161). Several were constructed by modifying a terrace and adding a stone facing while others were built on flat land by infilling a coral lined enclosure to form a platform (Bellwood 1978:Fig. 78). The major structural feature of the Mangaian marae is the raised platform and this distinguishes them from the Aitutaki and Rarotongan forms and places them closest to those of Ngaputoru. Paepae Paepae form the base for house structures and generally consist of a low, rectangular alignment of stone surrounding a pebble or stone flooring. Paepae sites of this sort have been recorded on Rarotonga and Aitutaki and less formally defined but functionally equivalent features are also present on the other islands of the group. On Rarotonga, the greatest variety of forms occur in the Maungaroa valley, and there the paepae also display the most elaborate use of stone and earthwork construction techniques (Table 1). The main explanation for the variety and elaboration of the Maungaroa forms is probably the steep topography of the valley. In Maungaroa, the paepae occur as rectangular, square and L-shaped pavements and simple stone faced terraces (Fig. 7). Some include paved verandah areas and several have additional alignments of stone running at angles to the main walls (Bellwood 1969:521). Some of the paepae are large, enclosing areas of up to 120 m2 but the largest actual houses so far excavated are around 40 m2 and most were probably smaller</page><page sequence="12">74 Richard Walter than that. On the coastal plain, paepae sites are not as well preserved but a number of quadrangular stone paved structures similar to some of the Maungaroa forms have been recorded, and several excavated, the largest containing a structure measuring about 54 m2 in area (Parker 1974). A unique Rarotongan variation on the paepae form found both in Maungaroa and along the coastal plain are T-Shaped paepae (Fig. 8). These stone paved quadrangular paepae have a long pavement running off one wall. These are thought to have been the verandah and pavement for chiefs' dwellings and were also used as sites for political meetings (Duff and Duff 1974). Few paepae of Aitutaki have been preserved but appear to be of basically similar form to those of Maungaroa, as stone lined terraces or quadrangular alignments with pebble interiors (Bellwood 1969). Bellwood (1969) also defined the 'Are Karioi as a specific paepae 'type'. This type of structure is described traditionally as a house of entertain ment and the excavated example on Aitutaki (AIT 3) is a 21 by 10 m rectangular stone enclosure with a pebble floor. At least three consecu tive structures were erected here, the largest measuring about 19 by 11 m (Bellwood 1978:129). In addition to the stone lined paepae, the remnants of structures are found on the coastal plains and valley floors of Rarotonga and amongst the agricultural zones of Aitutaki and the raised coral reef islands. These sites are defined by patches of coral pebbles exposed on the surface and are often associated with dark charcoal stained soils from umu or hearths. In Ngaputoru several of these features contain short coral alignments, perhaps the rem nants of curbs. Many of these sites are the remnant floors of dwelling houses or agricultural shelters but their function can not be determined with certainty without excavation. Agricultural Sites The most important crop in the Cook Islands was taro, which was cultivated in wet field systems using techniques based either on irrigation or on drainage, according to the conditions of the local environment. In valleys with large enough catchments to support semi-permanent water flows, taro production was carried out in irrigated pondfield systems. The most highly developed of these were on Mangaia, where Allen (1971) has recorded two major types of complex. In the steep upper valleys, artificial channelling conducts water through flights of terraces parallel to the stream beds. In the mid-valleys, low earthern embankments cross the valley floor creating a series of wet-field beds through which water is diverted via deep channels from the streams. Although smaller in scale, similar systems have been recorded on Rarotonga (Bellwood 1978).

These can be seen in most of the valleys of Rarotonga as well as on Mangaia. Elsewhere on Rarotonga and Mangaia, as well as on Atiu and Ma'uke, drainage channels are also cut through the low standing swamps and the fill piled up to form raised planting beds. The function of the drainage systems is to channel excess water out of the planting zone rather than introduce it as in the irrigated pondfield systems. When not in use, drainage systems in swampy zones silt up very quickly but on all four of the above islands remnants of large drainage channels and beds can be seen adjacent to the still extensive areas under cultivation. Other agricultural features recorded in Ngaputoru are stone boundary walls and pig pens. On all three islands, walls at least a kilometre in length with shorter side branches occur on the dryland soils along the inner margins of the makatea. Unlike some of the recorded systems on Hawai'i, these do not seem to demark specific plots and their exact function is unknown, although they are strongly associated with the dry agricultural soils. Small pig pens made of coral rubble are built just inside the inner edges of the makatea on all three islands of Ngaputoru. They are up to several metres in height and some have been sunk below surface level by using existing crevices in the upraised coral beds in which the entrances are blocked and walls heightened. Rockshelters A number of rocksheiter sites have been recorded on Aitutaki, Rarotonga and Mangaia. Two small rockshelters in the Maungaroa hills of Rarotonga may have been associated with the occupation of the Upper Maungaroa cluster of sites (Bellwood 1978:34). At the Tangatatau shelter on Mangaia a deep stratigraphie sequence spans the period circa A.D. 1000 to 1600. The site contains evidence of sporadic occupation and may have been used as a base for bush procurement activities, as well as for stone tool manufacturing. The large number of fishhooks suggests that it was permanently occupied during some stages of its use (Kirch et al. 1992). A small rocksheiter on Moturakau islet in Aitutaki lagoon was used as a fishing shelter and adze manufacturing site for several hundred years from the 13th century A.D. (Allen and Schubel 1990). Burials On the makatea islands of Mangaia and Ngaputoru the raised coral belt is riddled with caves and many of these were used as burial chambers. Such</page><page sequence="16">78 Richard Walter sites are best known from Mangaia and Atiu but both Mitiaro and Ma'uke also contain a smaller number of such sites. In these sites the body is usually placed in a crevice or on the cave floor, and many contain multiple burials. Some of the burials appear to be secondary interments. On Rarotonga, Mitiaro and Mangaia coastal cemetery sites containing multiple burials have also been recorded but no dates have yet been reported. These sites consist of shallow burials along the sandy beach ridges and no skeletons yet observed are associated with burial goods. Stratified habitation sites The archaeological record in the Cook Islands is dominated by surface features: agricultural systems, stone structures, scattered midden and related occupation debris. In addition however, a small number of stratified occupa tion sites have been recorded, mostly as a result of beach ridge erosion or industrial development. The Rarotongan site, Ngati Tiare (RAR 40), was reported by Duff (1974) and later excavated by Bellwood (1978). A similar site on Aitutaki, Urei'a (AIT 10), was excavated by Bellwood (1978) and later, and more extensively, by Allen and Steadman (Allen 1992a, Allen and Steadman 1990). Both sites represent small permanent coastal settlements and were occupied for several centuries from approximately the 11th century A.D. Each contained the remains of a variety of domestic activities and a range of shell and stone tools similar in form to those recorded from 'archaic' sites elsewhere in Eastern Polynesia. Similar sites have been excavated on Mangaia and Ma'uke. The Anai'o site on Ma'uke was excavated by Walter (1990, 1993) and produced a similar range of 'archaic' type artefacts. This small hamlet was occupied for about a century from the early 14th century A.D. Recently, a similar site, Vairorongo, has been excavated on the north west coast of Mangaia (Katayama pers. comm.). Specialist sites Other than the agricultural complexes, few specialist function sites have been recorded in the Southern Cook Islands. So far, no stone quarries have been located although the source areas are beginning to be pinned down (Sheppard et al. n.d., Weisler et al. 1994). The Moturakau shelter discussed above served as a fishing camp and adze manufacturing site from the 13th century A.D. and on Mitiaro a small fishing camp, Paraoa, has recently been excavated (see below). A stone flaking floor has also been reported from Tapuaeta'i motu in Aitutaki lagoon (Green pers. comm).</page><page sequence="17">Settlement Pattern Archaeology in the Southern Cook Islands 79 SETTLEMENT PATTERNS The field of settlement pattern archaeology is potentially wide and published studies in Polynesia cover a broad range of interests. Kirch (1989) has identified four different approaches which encompass most of the directions covered to date. These are 1) an ecological approach with a focus on the spatial distribution of sites as a reflection of social adaptation to the environment, 2) an approach dealing with social interpretations in which the aim is to reconstruct social groupings from distribution data, 3) an economic and political approach which looks at the spatial relation of sites and resources in terms of the manoeuvring for economic or political advantage, 4) a semiotic approach which examines the symbolic dimension of space and the social use and manipulation of space within a settlement or landscape. In the following summary, I have adopted these four categories as a useful means of discussing the settlement data from the Southern Cook Islands. The categories overlap in practice and few discussions of settlement pattern are or should be restricted to any one dimension (Kirch 1982:78). Environment At the simplest level, environmental adaptations are reflected in architec tural variation as a response to topography (see Weisler and Kirch 1985:152). The use of stone faced terracing in the Maungaroa complexes of marae and paepae is one such example. The steep terrain of Maungaroa required the builders to make use of artificial and reinforced natural terracing as founda tions for the stone structures which in themselves are not dissimilar to the lowland forms. Excavation of several paepae also suggest the use of raised flooring, a feature unknown ethnographically and archaeologically outside of Maungaroa (Bellwood 1978). Architectural adaptation to topography is also reflected in the Atiuan landscape, particularly the use of artificial or modified terraces as sites for house construction on the inner slopes of the central plateau. The major example is Vairakaia (see below) but many of the slopes above the inland swamps contain at least small scale terracing and this can also be seen on a much smaller scale on Ma'uke, particularly in the vicinity of Araki and Makatea swamps. A major study of Southern Cook Islands settlement patterns has focussed on the spatial distribution of sites as indicators of ecological adaptation (Bellwood 1971). Bellwood's analysis focussed on ecological variation between the islands of Aitutaki, Rarotonga and Mangaia and how this variation influenced settlement patterns as well as socio-political and economic organisation. He pointed particularly to the distinction between dispersed and clustered resources and the settlement pattern and socio-political responses to these alternatives. On the high island of Rarotonga the resource zonation</page><page sequence="18">80 Richard Walter is concentric. A sandy coastal fringe with limited tree cropping potential borders a 1-2 kilometre wide strip of coastal soils suitable for tree and dry root-crop agriculture. Between these soils and the problem soils of the hills, patches of swamp are available for taro production. Radial valleys cut into the hills and irrigated taro systems span the edges of several river beds. Resources are dispersed and evenly distributed and a highly dispersed settlement pattern emerged in response. An ancient, partly paved roadway known as the Ara Metua encircles the island between the coastal strip and the swamps of the inner coastal plain. Most lowland marae and paepae are strung out within 100 m of the edges of this road, close to the swamps and the dry crop soils. Bellwood has reconstructed a dispersed settlement pattern based on habitation along the ecotone between the major resource zones of the coastal plain. Communities thus maximised access to the most important terrestrial economic zones: the swamps, the dryland root-cropping soils and the arboricultural zones. On Aitutaki, where resource zonation is also dispersed, Bellwood has reconstructed a similar pattern of settlement to that of the Rarotongan coast. There the majority of sites, paepae and marae, are scattered along the ecotone between the sandy coastal soils and the inland terrace loams (Bellwood 1971:156). On both islands there is a relationship between dispersed resource zonation and a dispersed settlement pattern. These same ecological variables encouraged the development of egalitarian social systems. On Mangaia resource zones are clustered with a few extensive, high yielding taro complexes separated from each other and from the coast by rugged expanses of raised coral. A concentration of resources led to a clustered settlement pattern and influenced the development of highly localised, endogamous, and in many cases mutually antagonistic, ramages. The economy was based on the intensive cultivation of irrigated and swamp taro, the production of which fell under the centralised administrative control of the ruling ariki (Buck 1934, Buck 1944:250, Gill 1894, Sahlins 1958:60). The islands of Ngaputoru fall midway along a continuum from the even resource distribution of Rarotonga and Aitutaki to the clustered distributions of Mangaia (see Walter 1993). On Ma'uke, the basic zonation of resources is concentric, but within this zonation agricultural soils are unevenly distrib uted. Along the inner edge of the makatea which encircles the island to about 1.2 km there are small, localised pockets of the richer agricultural soils (the Taiki loams). The island slopes gently to the interior, where there are a number of swamp systems which drain under the makatea limestone to the sea. Between the swamps and the richer loams are soils of poor nutrient status but with some limited tree and root cropping potential (Wilson 1982). The Taiki soils are extremely localised and limited in area. It is likely that they</page><page sequence="19">Settlement Pattern Archaeology in the Southern Cook Islands 81 were always the most prized agricultural zones but during late prehistory they appear to have been under increased pressure, perhaps as a result of population increase and a decrease in swamp soils through erosion. As a response to limited availability, access became regulated through residence rules and thus these areas emerged as the central residential focus within late Ma'uke settlement patterns. The marae and associated habitation areas are scattered along the inner makatea edge in close association with the Taiki loams and in close proximity to a section of swamp land so that, as on Rarotonga, the community maximised access to both the dry and the wet crop lands. Although Atiuan settlement patterns have not yet been fully described archaeologically, on the basis of my own observations a basically similar pattern to that of Ma'uke is inferred (see also Crocombe n.d.). Atiuan swamps are larger than those of Ma'uke and there are extensive, localised patches of rich dryland soils on the slopes above these swamps (Campbell 1982). Settlement areas represented by terracing, scattered kirikiri, umu and midden are distributed along the ridges and flat land above the swamps in proximity to the high nutrient soils. This is most clearly indicated in the areas below the settlements of Tengatangi and Ngatiarua and above the swamp system around Lake Te Roto. On Mitiaro, the resources are much more clustered than on either Ma'uke or Atiu, tending towards the Mangaian pattern. Like Mangaia, the concentration of resources has led on Mitiaro to a clustered late prehistoric settlement pattern. The limited planting soils are restricted to small highly localised patches in the middle of the island known in English as the foodlands and there are five in total. Each foodland is spatially isolated from the others and was an independent economic and socio-political unit in late prehistory. Each foodland contains one or more marae with house floors (kirikiri patches) and associated habitation debris scattered over the planting soils within a kilometre or so of the marae. Social In the Maungaroa Valley, Bellwood has utilised ethnographic accounts and oral histories to assess the social groupings represented by these isolated and clustered site complexes. Each of the main residential complexes contains marae and paepae as well as a small number of T-Shaped paepae ,which had some form of political function. The implication is that these sites were autonomous settlements occupied by the full range of community members, from chiefs to commoners. The Lower Maungaroa settlement is divided into several clusters of paepae, each with one small marae. Using historic records as a model, Bellwood interprets each of the small clusters as the settlement of a minor lineage or rigati ( ell wood 1978:13). Each of these</page><page sequence="20">82 Richard Walter rigati would have been under a single rangatira and there would have been one mataiapo within the wider settlement complex uniting each group into a larger whole. On Ma'uke, Walter ( 1993) selected the community as a basic unit of social analysis and reconstructed the characteristics of community spatial organi sation at two phases of the known prehistoric sequence. The primary social unit of a community site is the household and archaeologically this is represented by the household cluster (see McCoy 1976). In the 14th century site of Anai'o, household clusters were represented by small dwelling structures and associated working floors and cooking facilities. The dwell ings were small with deep kirikiri floors. Shell and stone working areas were concentrated around the front of the structures, as well as in the vicinity of the cooking areas. These latter facilities were represented by umu pits, often enclosed in small structures situated adjacent to the larger dwellings (Walter 1993). Within the Anai'o site, the individual units were clustered to the point of nucleation and the site is described as a hamlet containing both private and public space. Private space is represented by the individual household clusters with their associated work areas. Public space includes the open and clear areas between the clusters, as well as communal cooking and food preparation areas. The clustered nature of the occupation suggests high levels of community cooperation at the level of everyday economic activities. The Anai'o hamlet would have been occupied by a single tribal group, probably a rigati with one or more resident mataiapo. The Rarotongan site of Ngati Tiare is similar in structure to that of Anai'o and was occupied at about the same period. There too a household cluster is represented by a dwelling and small adjacent cookhouse (Bellwood 1978:Fig. 40). Although only one such cluster was excavated, the site is large and there is good reason to suppose that it too was a settlement in which the basic parameters of social organisation were similar to that of Anai'o. In contrast to the nucleated settlements of Anai'o and Ngati Tiare, the community in the late period of Ma'uke prehistory is represented by much more scattered archaeological remains. Each of these settlement areas is isolated from the next and is interpreted as the residential base of a single community, probably a ngati. Within the wide settlement area, the marae was the central focus for the community and served to unite each group through its symbolic and political function. The scattered settlement patterns reconstructed for late Ma'uke prehistory appear to have been the norm throughout much of the Southern Group at the time. This is indicated archaeologically by the scattered settlement areas described above and is also reflected in a number of early historic accounts (Crocombe 1964, Gilson</page><page sequence="21">Settlement Pattern Archaeology in the Southern Cook Islands 83 1980, Williams 1838). The contrasts between the nucleated Anai'o type settlements and these later scattered settlements implies some differences in basic patterns of social organisation. It would be unwise to speculate too greatly on this but the dispersion of household clusters on Ma'uke does suggest that the household was more autonomous within the everyday economic system than during the occupation of Anai'o. At the time of European arrival in the Southern Cook Islands, there was a complex set of ritual activities centred around the marae which included the dedication of first fruits. These events served to reinforce group identity and the authority of the chiefs. This type of system would most likely have emerged in the dispersed settlement environment rather than in the clustered situation where chiefly authority and group identity would have been reinforced through patterns of everyday intercourse and social interaction. Although the marae is an essential feature of East Polynesian culture, the emergence of the marae complex as a principal and central component of Cook Island socio-political systems is very likely to have occurred when and where a dispersed settlement pattern was adopted. As this summary indicates, the social dimension of spatial patterning has so far been concerned with social reconstruction and in correlating spatial and social units (ranging from the household to community). While some progress has been achieved in the field, there has been no attempt to address gender as a conditioning factor in the social use of space. This is a serious shortcoming given the influence of gender roles in the definition of work patterns and spatial behaviour in Polynesian ethnography, and for this reason, gender issues are likely to feature strongly in future programmes. Economic and political A number of preliminary statements have been made about the economic and political significance of site distributions, but so far this has not been a major research issue in the Cook Islands. Elsewhere, I have pointed out that a high proportion of the early sites in the Southern Cook Islands are located adjacent to reef passages and that many of these, like Ngati Tiare and Anai , were large nucleated settlements (Walter 1994). I have argued that until approximately the 14th or early 15th century A.D. there was a high level of inter-island communication in the Southern Cook Islands (Walter 1993:83). This is documented particularly in the importation of pearlshell and volcanic stone to Ma ' uke but similar patterns of early importation and later decline are evident in the archaeology of Aitutaki and Mangaia (Allen 1992b, Kirch et al. 1992). The selection for reef passage occupation may be at least partly explained as an attempt to dominate nodes in the wider communication network. On the makatea islands and to a lesser extent on Rarotonga and</page><page sequence="22">84 Richard Walter Aitutaki, there are very few passages where it is possible to launch and beach large ocean-going canoes regularly and safely. In an environment of regular inter-island voyaging, such places achieve greater relative strategic value both economically and politically. On Mangaia, Ma'uke, Aitutaki and Rarotonga all such places contain early stratified occupation horizons and it is significant that at the time of European contact when inter-island voyaging was not commonly practised, none of these places had permanent settlements. The settlement complexes in the Maungaroa Valley have also been discussed in terms of their political implications. The occupation of these sites is seen by Bellwood as a matter of political expediency, a refuge for certain groups of the Arorangi district during times of warfare. This interpre tation has some validation in the oral and recorded history of Rarotonga (Williams 1838:172). Thus the selection of land is interpreted not in terms of ecological variables but as a direct response to political pressure (Bellwood 1971, 1978). The Raemaru cluster on the highest level of the Maungaroa ridge has been interpreted as a lookout point which may also have served to protect the passes between the Te-Au-o-Tonga and Arorangi (Puaikura) political districts. The dissolution of the nucleated settlements such as Anai'o and Ngati Tiare was accompanied by the move to dispersed occupation on the inland planting soils. I have argued that this reflects the increased economic importance of agricultural land as horticulture expanded and the trade routes declined. Land tenure is strongly tied to residence rules in the Cook Islands (Crocombe 1964), and the occupation of the agricultural soils represents the assertion of long-term and exclusive economic rights by specific polities. The establishment of the marae is also part of the process of demonstrating and asserting through symbolic and political means the relationship between bounded land units and specific social groups. Semiotics No direct statements have yet been made about the symbolic implications of settlement patterns in the Southern Cook Islands. In a study of settlement space in Kawela, Moloka'i, Weisler and Kirch (1985:154) discuss the structured spatial distinctions between activities as a reflection of cultural values. While recognising the presence of conceptual dichotomies in Polynesian world views it is premature to use these distinctions to explain settlement space in the Cook Islands context. Nevertheless, the spatial discreteness of the cooking facilities at Anai'o and Ngati Tiare is noted and this may have ideational implications as Weisler and Kirch suggest in the Moloka'i setting. The practice of maintaining burials at a distance from habitation and agricultural areas is also consistent with patterns of Eastern</page><page sequence="23">Settlement Pattern Archaeology in the Southern Cook Islands 85 Polynesian symbolic behaviour during the late prehistoric and historic periods. The spatial distribution of sites along the Rarotongan lowlands may also be interpreted in a symbolic framework. In each district the marae and settlement areas are spread out alongside the ancient road, the Ara Metua, which runs through each tapere or bounded land unit. The Ara Metua links the marae of each tribe and emphasises unity and inclusiveness at the social and ceremonial level. This provides a strong contrast with Mangaia where the steep cliffs and makatea reinforce the isolation and separateness of each tribal group. The Ara Metua then serves as both a physical and symbolic link between the dispersed tribal groups of Rarotonga. This is a reflection of the egalitarian nature of the Rarotongan political system and the strong histori cal, genealogical and symbolic links which unite groups throughout the island. Finally, I can offer some comments on this issue in respect of Mitiaro settlement patterns. Mitiaro in late prehistory and the early contact period was exposed to the sometimes brutal political ambitions of the Atiu chiefs, and as the economically most impoverished and militarily weakest of the Ngaputoru alliance it was least able to offer resistance. Atiu lies off the lee coast of Mitiaro, the coast which also contains the only sheltered passages where ocean going canoes can land, including war canoes. On the opposite side of the island the dry, barren and uninhabited windward coast has an unexpectedly high proportion of stone structures, including a stone-lined structure known as Te Pare which is described in oral tradition as a fortification. Oral traditions repeatedly associate the windward coast with the wider politics of Ngaputoru, and often in terms of refuge, safety and resistance. The windward coast appears to be symbolically associated with the power, dignity and prestige of Mitiaro within the wider political sphere and this is reflected in the high proportion of ceremonial sites on this side of the island. ISSUES IN COOK ISLANDS SETTLEMENT ARCHAEOLOGY As Kirch (1982) points out, the separation of settlement pattern studies into discrete paradigms is both unrealistic and undesirable and in most modern studies a somewhat more integrated approach is usually achieved. In the following section I review some attempts at integration and outline some of the outstanding problems in interpreting settlement patterns. Settlement subsistence systems It is customary to consider the major elements of the first three of the approaches discussed above as contributing to the study of settlement subsistence systems (Struever 1968). The interest here is in exploring the</page><page sequence="24">86 Richard Walter relationship between culture and environment as expressed through techno logical, economic and social adaptation and the settlement system adopted within the context of these inter-relationships (Fitzhugh 1972:7). Three units are involved in the investigation of settlement subsistence systems. First, a circumscribed territorial unit which is the base of a particular social group's residential and economic activities. Second, a definition of a particular social group and third, a suite of function-specific sites within that particular geographic territory. The relationship between these units is explored on a seasonal and spatial basis within the context of social and economic organi sation. In practice, the territorial and social parameters usually have to be inferred from the archaeological record and the boundaries of each will be very fluid. However, in the Southern Cook Islands, oral tradition and historic accounts provide good information about land tenure and social organisation and this should provide an excellent entr?e into settlement subsistence studies. The clearest, but not necessarily the most reliable, model for traditional land tenure and social organisation comes from Rarotonga (see Crocombe 1964). In brief, land tenure in late prehistory was based on wedge shaped units, tapere which ran from the coast to the hills each of which contained portions of all the important economic resources, including those of the lagoon and reef. Each tapere was occupied by one or several closely related ngati under the head of a title holder known as a mataiapo who traced descent from the founding eponymous ancestor of that ngati. Each ngati consisted of a number of extended family groups, kopu tangata, who were united under a rangatira and who collectively owed allegiance to the mataiapo. Each ngati and each mataiapo were members of a larger social grouping known as a vaka which had an ariki as overall political leader. Thus there was a very close association between circumscribed economic land units (the tapere) and particular social groupings (the ngati). In practice the system was flexible and varied slightly in time and place throughout Rarotonga. In the outer islands, this system was also followed but geographic variation resulted in greater deviations from the idealised model. Despite the fact that territorial and social organisation within an economic context is reasonably well understood, a brief review of Southern Cook Island's settlement archaeology indicates that there has been little progress in reconstructing any coherent settlement subsistence systems. The major problem is the requirement of defining a range of functional site types within a society's territorial boundaries. As indicated in the discussion of site types, this prerequisite is far from achieved. Starting with the basic residential components, the household unit has not yet been defined in more than a few times and places. In the context of the early coastal settlements of Ngati Tiare</page><page sequence="25">Settlement Pattern Archaeology in the Southern Cook Islands 87 and Anai'o, the household unit consists of dwelling, cookhouse and work areas all in close proximity but elsewhere there are few configurations of components that can be reconstructed to this level. The closest approxima tion are the paepae sites of the Maungaroa Valley, but while some dwelling structures have been excavated there, they have not yet been strongly correlated with other features. The scattered settlement areas of the Rarotongan lowlands and the islands of Ngaputoru and Mangaia contain house floors and some umu remains but no structures have been excavated, and the spatial form of the household is completely undefined. Agricultural sites have been examined and several mapped but there is little understanding of how these complexes articulate with other sites as part of a settlement subsistence system. There are several possibilities based on the Society Island pattern and on modern Cook Island agricultural practices. In Rarotonga for example, the irrigated valley complexes may have been operated at the household level by groups resident on the coastal plain and this is the interpretation offered by Bellwood (1971:151). In such a situation, small garden structures would have been erected for shelter during the day or for short-term occupation during phases of the planting cycle. Alterna tively, there may have been permanent settlement along the slopes above the rivers. In this case, we would expect to find terracing and associated household units and perhaps small marae in configurations similar to those of the Opunohu Valley of Mo'orea for example (Green et al. 1967, see also Lepofsky 1994) . To date, there is an insufficient archaeological basis for deciding between these options but I believe that the extent of prehistoric valley exploitation on Rarotonga has been underestimated and that either alternative is possible. In addition to agricultural structures, there is a wide range of other specialist sites that we might expect to find as part of a wider settlement subsistence system but so far these are represented only by a single fishing shelter and a few cave burials. Site types of particular archaeological interest are quarries and adze working sites. Although archaeologists are beginning to develop an understanding of the general range of basalt types used in the Cook Island adze industry (Sheppard et al. n.d., Weisler et al. 1994), no quarries or specific extraction sites have yet been located. In terms of settlement subsistence systems it would be interesting to determine whether stone working in the Cook Islands involved localised quarrying and special ist manufacture, in which case there are possibilities of restricted access and localised control over distribution, or whether it was a low intensity industry operated at the household level. Were Rarotongans, for example, using the local sources available in each taper-e, or were they competing for limited outcrops of the high quality flaking material found in some of the northern</page><page sequence="26">88 Richard Walter valleys? To this end the location of stone working and procurement sites is integral to the reconstruction of settlement subsistence systems. In summary, at present, no tapere or appropriate land unit has yet been described anywhere in the Southern Cook Islands within which a sufficiently full range of site types has been examined to allow an assessment of settlement subsistence adaptations. As a contribution towards developing models for settlement subsistence systems in the Cook Islands, some recent work on the island of Mitiaro is briefly summarised. Mitiaro is a raised coral reef island in Ngaputoru and the most resource poor island of the Southern Group. As discussed above, the study of settlement subsistence systems involves the identification of a circum scribed territorial unit which served as the economic and residential base for a particular social group and the location and explication of the sites utilised by that group as part of their exploitation schedule. Because of the highly clustered nature of terrestrial resource zonation the tapere, as a slice of land containing portions of each resource zone, is not appropriate and the foodland was the basic unit of a social group's land holding and economic activities (see above). The foodlands were the focus of all subsistence agricultural activities on Mitiaro. According to oral tradition, each of the foodlands was a spatially and economically independent unit in traditional Mitiaro society comprising the residential and agricultural production zone for one tribal group. Thus each foodland is associated with one tribe and with one ariki and subordinate title holders. In terms of settlement subsistence models, the foodland is the basic territorial unit and the ngati the basic social unit of analysis in late Mitiaro prehistory. Within each foodland there are one or two marae each surrounded over several hectares by low density scatters of kirikiri from prehistoric house floors. These areas form the residential and ceremonial focus for the ngati and probably also represent the main areas of root-crop agricultures. Oral tradition, however, makes repeated reference to locales on the island which were specifically associated with a particular foodland. The nature of these places varied, some were scenes of historic events and others were areas for specialist resource gathering, fishing or eeling sites for example. In order to reconstruct a late-phase settlement subsistence system on Mitiaro I selected the foodland of Mangarei and attempted to locate some of the special function sites recorded in contemporary oral form. According to tradition, each foodland maintained a coastal hamlet, which was occupied by members of the community for short times for the specific purpose of fishing. The Mangarei fishing settlement was traditionally located on the windward coast at Paraoa and a partly paved, prehistoric track was located which leads from the Mangarei foodland to the coast at Paraoa.</page><page sequence="27">Settlement Pattern Archaeology in the Southern Cook Islands 89 Restricted excavation near the termination of the Paraoa track revealed evidence of a small-scale coastal settlement containing, amongst other evidence, the first assemblage of shell fishhooks recovered from Mitiaro. This fishing settlement probably comprised only a small number of shelters and further excavation is intended to determine their spatial form and patterns of use. Historical and ethnographic accounts have allowed the reconstruction of sociopolitical organisation in late Mitiaro prehistory and each social group has been identified with a specific, and very well defined, territorial zone. Within this zone the marae and houshold clusters have been recorded and the basic outline of the habitation and agricultural zones have been identified. Finally, through a combination of historical and ethnographic accounts as well as conventional archaeological methods other components of the larger system are beginning to emerge. The project is ongoing, with an emphasis in following seasons on defining the spatial form of household and inter household space, dating of site components and the location and definition of other specialist sites belonging to the Mangarei system. Settlement Pattern Variation Another confusing element in Southern Cook Island settlement archaeol ogy is the range of variation in the described settlement patterns and particularly in determining their temporal relationships. In Rarotonga for example, at least four types (or fragments of types) of settlement pattern exist in the archaeology. The first three of these are the 'archaic' nucleated settlement(s) of the coast, the scattered inland settlements of the inner coastal plain and the clustered settlements on the high ridges of Maungaroa Valley. Finally, there are the as yet uninvestigated settlement areas adjacent to the irrigated systems along the valley floors. The questions of interest are, are these examples of discrete and different settlement patterns or is there a more complex historical relationship involved? Because of the emphasis on survey and the search for wider distributional patterns it is often easy to lose sight of historical context in settlement pattern archaeology. Any pattern on the ground, however, exists as an accumulation of events in a contemporary landscape and rarely reflects a genuine snapshot in time. This reinforces the need for excavation, tight dating and the incorporation of a diachronic perspective. Green has provided a good diachronic view in the evidence from the Opunohu Valley (Green et al. 1967). There a gradual expansion into the valley was documented involving a sequence of changes in site function, basic settlement organisation and exploitation practices. Studies such as this would be extremely useful in Rarotonga and elsewhere in the Southern Cook Islands. There is already a</page><page sequence="28">90 Richard Walter hint of the complexity of Rarotongan settlement pattern dynamics in the few dates that we have from archaeological contexts. The Maungaroa sites for example have been interpreted as a refuge settlement occupied in times of political stress (Bellwood 1971, 1978). Yet the dating evidence suggests at the least that construction activities in the Maungaroa hills spanned three or four centuries. This coincides with clearance activities along the Ara Metua which date to at least the early 16th century A.D. (Wilkes 1974:52). The sequence of development of these settlements, and their historic interrela tionships and as well as the construction and use of the irrigated agriculture systems of the valley floors is an important problem. An explanation for historic change in settlement patterns has already been put forward in the Ma'uke context. There, a shift from an early nucleated coastal settlement pattern to a later period dispersed, inland settlement pattern has been documented and explained on the basis of social, environ mental and economic factors (Walter 1990,1993). I have also suggested that this pattern may hold in general for other areas of the Cook Islands as well (Walter 1993:85). Nevertheless, the distinction between early-coastal and late-inland settlement patterns is not straightforward and the absence of early inland sites and late coastal sites is probably in part a result of preservation problems. Nor can the distinction between early-nucleated and late-dis persed be described as more than a general pattern. The settlements of Maungaroa (Rarotonga) and Vairakaia (Atiu) stand out in this regard. In total, four clusters of structures were located on the steep slopes of the Maungaroa Valley above Muriavai Stream. The Lower Maungaroa Cluster (RAR.51) of about 27 paepae and eight marae lies approximately 100 m above sea level and 80 m above the present stream bed. It consists of a cluster of sites covering a flat, but rocky section of ground of about four hectares in area. The cluster lies well above known planting land but some of the nearby fern-covered slopes may have been under cultivation in the past (Bellwood 1978:13). On a steep section of land to the north of RAR.51 lies a small cluster of seven paepae and one marae. This small residential cluster known as the Southern Lower Maungaroa Cluster (RAR.50) lies even further from the agricultural land but may have been an extension of RAR.51. The Upper Maungaroa Cluster (RAR.53) consists of a group of about 20 sites including several small marae in an area of approximately 1 ha. The sites are located on artificial terraces running between 170 and 270 m above sea level. The Raemaru Cluster is a group of about eight terraced paepae on the edge of a steep ridge over 300 m above sea level. Many of the paepae and marae are of elaborate construction and several show evidence of more than one phase of occupation. They come in a wide range of forms and the possibility of several phases of long term settlement in these hills with some nearby</page><page sequence="29">Settlement Pattern Archaeology in the Southern Cook Islands 91 cultivation should be investigated. So far, the archaeology does not lend support for the claim that these were nucleated, nor however does it preclude this possibility and an urgent priority would be to obtain tighter chronologi cal control over the Maungaroa occupation zones as well as further spatial definition of the settlements through areal excavation. At the Vairakaia marae site described above, Trotter recorded a single terrace on the ridge behind the marae platform which he thought may have been constructed as a base for habitation (Trotter 1974a: 112). The land was under heavy bush at that time, but in 19871 had the opportunity to partially map the site following clearance associated with the restoration of the marae by an Earthwatch team under the supervision of Sinoto, Kurashina and Stevenson (Altonn 1988). Approximately 2500 m2 of artificial terracing was recorded representing about a third of the visible terrace features (Fig. 9). Assuming much of this land was set aside as housing, this implies very dense occupation and is reminiscent of some of the open settlements of the North Island of New Zealand. At Vairakaia the living terraces are contiguous with one of the largest and most elaborate marae on the island. The marae itself lies only metres from one of the richest taro swamps and the upper terraces to the south back onto an extensive area of rich dryland soils. The site is certainly more clustered than other recorded habitation areas elsewhere on Atiu and the investigation of its internal spatial structure would be extremely worthwhile in defining the full range of settlement types and patterns of social and spatial organisation. Historical Process As well as a diachronic perspective it is also useful to consider the question of historical process in settlement pattern studies and this is one area which has been seriously underexplored in Cook Islands archaeology, and to some extent beyond (Crosby 1994:71 ). So far there has been a strong priority given to ecology and environment in settlement pattern studies and little thought to historical considerations. Bellwood (1978) attributes the Maungaroa settlement complexes to historical factors, namely the defeat of coastal groups and their retreat inland. Nevertheless, these sites were still seen as 'aberrant' because they fall beyond the type of adaptive response attributable to ecological factors (Bellwood 1971:151). Historical process is not advocated here as a new paradigm but simply as a means of providing a different perspective on the traditional approaches to settlement pattern archaeology. The importance of historical process in structuring and altering settlement patterns is well illustrated in the historical literature from the Southern Cook Islands and there is no basis for assuming that it was any less important before the arrival of Europeans. A cursory discussion of historic</page><page sequence="30">92 Richard Walter faro swamp ^ ' Fig. 9 Vairakaia marae (Site 20) Atiu showing marae platform and terracing</page><page sequence="31">Settlement Pattern Archaeology in the Southern Cook Islands 93 phase and modern settlement patterns on various islands illustrates the role of historical process in the spatial and social functioning of a modern settlement landscape. The point is most clearly illustrated in reference to changes in settlement pattern brought about by the arrival of the missions to Rarotonga. According to most accounts the settlements on Rarotonga were inland with no evidence for substantial nucleation. The description by Williams (the first official European visitor to Rarotonga in 1823) indicates the presence of a scattered coastal settlement pattern along the Ara Metua1. He does not mention villages, and it is noteworthy that with the establishment of the mission stations villages were actually founded. If they existed before, then surely the missions would have been located in them (Bellwood 1969:518). However, within several years of mission arrival, villages had been established at various points along the Rarotongan coast under the influence of the mission teachers who were faced with the 'difficulties of teaching diverse and scattered groups' (Crocombe 1964:65). These villages rapidly became the primary habitation zones in Rarotongan society and the earlier settlement patterns were all but abandoned. A similar process of nucleation and the abandonment of earlier settlement patterns occurred within a decade of mission arrival on Atiu, Ma'uke, Mitiaro, Aitutaki and Mangaia. This is one of the most commonly cited examples of the early influence of the mission in a number of parts of Polynesia (Davidson 1969 for example). But in the Cook Islands there are further examples of the role of history in settlement pattern change and internal dynamics right up until the present. Following the arrival of the mission, the scattered ngati of Ma'uke were gathered into a single village, Oiretumu (Rere n.d.). This settlement is internally, but subtly, divided into three named sections each corresponding to one of the major tribal groups on the island. The dynamics of village life over the last century and up to the present day are strongly determined by the nature of this internal structuring (Siikala 1991 ). So the changes in settlement pattern brought on by the historic influence of the mission are overlaid at the social and political level by earlier historic patterns. Neither the contempo rary spatial structure of Oiretumu, nor the social and political organisation and behaviour within the village, can be understood without reference to varying levels of historic process. Ecology is of relatively little importance. Furthermore, a single historic event in the first decades of this century brought about a major reorganisation in Ma'uke settlement patterns and social organisation. As a result of an internal dispute between two of the major lineages resident in Oiretumu, one segment of the community up rooted their belongings, changed their religious allegiance and established a</page><page sequence="32">94 Richard Walter new village on the north west coast. This new settlement, Kimiangatau, is the first known permanent settlement on the Ma'uke coast since the occupation of Anai'o six centuries earlier. This new division of the island brought about serious changes in internal politics and is also strongly implicated in the dynamics of Ma'uke religious organisation and practice. Kimiangatau is Catholic and Oiretumu Protestant2 and thus there is a strong religious dimension to modern settlement patterns reflected in belief, inter-village ceremonial practices and monumental architecture. I have commented elsewhere on recent changes in Ma'uke settlement patterns (Walter 1993). Briefly, as a result of political change and new airline schedules the possibilities for cash cropping on Ma'uke have increased and the inland soils have been rising in economic value. As a result, a new settlement pattern began to emerge from about 1987, when families started to move out from the villages and erect permanent structures on their scattered plantation lands. The Taiki soils were becoming, as they were in late prehistory, the prime resource on the island and a scattered settlement pattern like that of late prehistory was developing. This trend appears now to have declined as the logistics of export have become more complex. On Mitiaro too, historical process is crucial to understanding settlement patterns and the spatial and social organisation of life in the modern village context. The arrival of the missions in Mitiaro brought dramatic changes in Mitiaro settlement patterns as they did elsewhere in Polynesia. The two most significant features of these changes were the establishment of a village and the movement of the residential zones from the inland agricultural soils down to the coast. Nevertheless, despite the changes brought by the missions, aspects of the earlier settlement pattern and social organisation were im posed in the new spatial context. The single modern village on Mitiaro runs in a narrow strip for several hundred metres each side of the main landing with houses one deep on the coastal side, and up to three deep on the inland side of the road. Each household unit consists of a dwelling, a lean-to shelter of corrugated iron or coconut thatch used for cooking, a latrine and a variety of specialist outdoor work areas. Small stands of citrus, banana, breadfruit and a variety of other tree crops are planted around the houses but all other cultivation activities take place in the foodlands. To the outsider the village appears continuous, with no visual internal boundaries. But to the people of Mitiaro it is clearly delineated into four named sections each corresponding to one of the foodlands. Each named section is described as a 'village' in its own right and the traditional political offices are closely associated with these. The modern ariki system is largely ceremonial today with little political power invested in the title holders. Yet in overlaying the structure of an earlier political and</page><page sequence="33">Settlement Pattern Archaeology in the Southern Cook Islands 95 economic system on the modern settlement pattern Mitiaro society has preserved more than the symbolic trappings of traditional political organisa tion. Although the population of the island is small and the spatial layout of the settlement and the modern cash economy mitigates against the concept of economically independent units, each section of the village is represented in as many ways as possible as independent. This is apparent in such areas as sport, women's groups and cultural activities, including the performing arts, where groups are organised along 'village' lines. From the archaeological perspective one of the most interesting exam ples of the manner in which the structures of traditional Mitiaro society are overlaid on the modern settlement pattern lies in the large number of communal structures present within the settlement. Despite there being only 200 people on the island there are enough halls to accommodate 10 times this number, since each section of the settlement conceives of a need for a symbolic focus for their own particular group. Thus the church, scout and community halls function in a similar way to the marae in traditional Mitiaro society, as a ceremonial and symbolic focus, and a means of validating group identity. Again, this highlights the importance of considering historical process in the investigation of the spatial, socio political and economic organisation of community life in the Cook Islands. This point is well illustrated in Jennings' et al. (1982) study of Samoan district {nuku) organisation where a similar process of projecting prehistoric social practice on to a modern settlement pattern has been described. As a final point of illustration I would note briefly the latest development in Rarotongan settlement patterns. These involve the habitation zones of the new elite who are clearing the lower slopes of the inland hills to construct elaborate dwellings. This land had always been considered worthless be cause of the steep topography and the sterile soils. However, these zones have acquired a new economic value based on their spectacular views over the lowland plain and sea. This new concept of environmental value has developed in response to the new economics of the island. Clearly, it is easy to invoke and discuss historical process when dealing with a modern settlement pattern and with access to good oral and written histories. But there comes a cut-off point in the past where access to historical insights becomes limited. It is important however, to use historical informa tion whenever possible and in the Cook Islands there is a great potential for this. Where such information is not available it is still important to be aware of the importance of historical process in any diachronic settlement pattern study.</page><page sequence="34">96 Richard Walter CONCLUSIONS While there have been fluctuations in the perceived value of settlement pattern archaeology in Polynesia, it has been consistently shown to be one of the most useful approaches to the reconstruction of prehistoric sociopolitical organisation and economic adaptation. A review of Southern Cook Island archaeology shows that while progress has been limited so far, there are a number of interesting issues and a wide potential for future research. The range of variation in settlement patterns needs to be explored in a diachronic framework with less emphasis on purely ecological interpretations. The expansion inland, the development of wet field agriculture and the evolution of the marae complex holds the key to understanding late period sociopoliti cal organisation and land tenure practices. The spatial organisation of settlements including the definition of the community and household in time and space is also an important element of this question. The role of historical process is underdeveloped and the adoption of more ethnoarchaeological approaches is advocated, including the study of the spatial and social dynamics of modern and historic settlements. Finally, there is a need to integrate some of the settlement data into models of settlement subsistence systems and again, ethnography is an important component of this type of research. A major problem facing archaeologists in the Southern Cook Islands is the extent of damage suffered by the late period settlements. This is compounded by the acceleration of development activities, particularly on Rarotonga, and highlights the urgent need for more survey programmes. There is also a difficulty in locating early habitation sites such as Anai'o, Ure'ia and Ngati Tiare and subsurface survey along the beach ridges of the outer islands is also a priority. On the positive side, oral history and tradition is available and this provides powerful insights into historical process as well as in the areas of economic, socio-political and symbolic reconstruction.

The actual settlement areas referred to by Williams were located approximately 1 km inland.</page><page sequence="35">Settlement Pattern Archaeology in the Southern Cook Islands 97 2. The division is no longer quite that distinct with Catholic and Protestant representation in both villages. Nevertheless the stated pattern is still highly relevant in modern Ma'uke society.
