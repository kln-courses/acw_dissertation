<plain_text><page sequence="1">Hawthorne's Determinism: An Analysis PETER L. TI-IORSLEV, JR. IT HAS BECOME a commonplace observation that in the last thirty years or so in England and America a major rift has developed between academic philosophy and literary scholarship and criti- cism. Literary critics, on the one hand, accuse philosophers of wandering in the desert of linguistic analysis, a well-charted Sahara, to be sure, with clearly distinguished concepts and landmarks, but void of all significant life; philosophers, on the other hand, see literary critics as having been seduced by those Parisian sirens, Sartre or Camus, or that Schwarzwald Lorelei, Heidegger, into the stormy and uncharted seas of existentialism, where concepts and compasses frequently point in several directions at once. We can probably do nothing with the philosophers, except hope that creative writers will eventually entice them back to life or con- vince them that our stormy seas are real, but, in the meantime, I believe we can usefully borrow some of their analytic techniques to make our own critical terms and charts less equivocal and un- reliable. Fate, free will, and determinism are certainly terms used more frequently and appositely in the discussion of Hawthorne than in the discussion of any other writer in American literature, and per- haps no other terms in literary scholarship are used with such dis- concerting ambiguity and confusion. Yet these terms have been subjected to a great deal of critical analysis by academic philos- ophers in the last decades, and while few would maintain that all or perhaps any of the crucial metaphysical or moral problems have been solved, the basic terms have been considerably limited, and the issues much more clearly defined. Yet literary scholars, for the Peter Thorslev is an assistant professor of English, University of California, Los Angeles. [141]</page><page sequence="2">142 Nineteenth-Century Fiction most part, continue to use the terms with all their nineteenth- century equivocations. It may be objected that Hawthorne himself so uses them, since he was, after all, a nineteenth-century novelist, but this is not really a valid excuse. We do not deny the use of terms like "organic unity" to critics of pre-Romantic poetry, nor do we insist on discussions of Shakespeare's characters being car- ried on in terms of humor psychology. And the critic, moreover, as distinct from the novelist, has a right or even a duty to define his concepts as clearly as modern criticism and analysis will allow him. The most common difficulties in the fate-free will area of criti- cism arise, I believe, from three related confusions: (1) a vestigial faculty psychology, which results in the "Will," the "Reason," and the "Passions" being considered as separable and autonomous func- tions of the personality; (2) the use of the terms "free will" and "determinism" as if they were mutually contradictory, when of course one concept of free will, at least, is not only compatible with determinism, but indeed implies it; (3) the use of the terms "fatalism" and "determinism" as if they were synonymous, with the result, of course, that Calvinists, Hindoos, Freudians, and modern physicists are made incongruent bedfellows. These confu- sions could be illustrated in any number of otherwise excellent discussions of Hawthorne and his works, but perhaps a couple of examples will suffice. In an interesting account of the moral philosophy of The Scarlet Letter, for instance, Darrel Abel writes that in Hester's story "Hawthorne intimates that, tangled as human relationships are and must be, no sin ever issues solely from the intent and deed of the individual sinner, but that it issues instead from a complicated interplay of motives of which he is the more or less willing instru- ment." 1 Now it makes no real sense to speak of a difference be- tween a sin which issues from the intent of the sinner and one which issues instead from an "interplay of motives" unless one has hypostatized the Will as a separate and autonomous faculty of the self which "chooses" between possible motives for action. But as modern analysis teaches us, this is not the case: the "self" cannot be separated from its motives, nor can it be an "instrument" of them: motives are an integral part of the self, and intentions and deeds are necessarily effects of motives, and inconceivable other- 1 "Hawthorne's Hester," College English, XIII (1952), 303-309.</page><page sequence="3">Hawthorne's Determinism 143 2 wise. Abel then goes on to speak of the "moral determinism" of the Puritans, and to "justify" it in the light of more modern the- ories of "biological and economic determinism" which are, he maintains, no less "harsh doctrine." 3 Now I think the Puritans can more accurately be described as fatalists than as determinists, but in any case, what makes Puritanism "harsh" is not its "deter- minism" but its doctrines of original sin and total depravity, and these doctrines are by no means necessary concomitants of deter- minism, nor, of course, do they have any place in contemporary biological or economic theory. Modern determinism is far more likely to exonerate than to condemn. The Salem Puritans judged and damned Hester for a sinner while denying the efficacy of her free will; Clarence Darrow, on the other hand-surely among the most thoroughgoing of modern determinists-absolved his clients of all responsibility on the basis of determinism (however mis- takenly), and, what is more, succeeded in persuading jurists to absolve them, too. More recently, in an excellent and admirably concise "introduc- tion" to Hawthorne, Arlin Turner perpetuates some of the same confusions. For the most part Turner uses the terms "deter- minism" and "fatalism" interchangeably: "This inevitability, this dark necessity, is of major importance in ... Hawthorne's general thought and as a consequence in all his works. Roger Chilling- worth is the constant spokesman for this fatalism.... The entire action is caught up in this inexorable determinism.... Pearl serves as the agent of fate." 4 So far this seems quite consonant with the Puritan notion of the world as a working-out of a pre-conceived divine plan, but Turner later cautions the reader not to "equate the determinism so prominent in [Hawthorne's] works with pre- 2 See the classic analysis of these terms in Gilbert Ryle, The Concept of Mind (London, 1949), chaps. iii-iv; or the analysis in P. H. Nowell-Smith, Ethics (Pen- guin Books, 1954), esp. pp. 287-289: "This creative 'self' that sits above the battle of motives and chooses between them seems to be a legacy of the theory that a man is not free when he does what he wants to do, since he is then the victim or slave of his desires; and it is postulated to avoid the unplausible doctrine that all action is involuntary." 3Pages 308-309. Darell Abel has also, however, written a much clearer discussion of free will and responsibility in connection with Chillingworth in "The Devil in Boston," Philological Quarterly, XXXII (1953), 366-381. He still uses the terms "fatal- ism" and "determinism" interchangeably, however, and, although he asserts Haw- thorne's belief in free will, he does not distinguish between a libertarian or a deter- minist freedom. 4Nathaniel Hawthorne: An Introduction and Interpretation (New York, 1961), pp. 58-59.</page><page sequence="4">144 Nineteenth-Century Fiction destination"; there is no good reason, he writes, for maintaining that Hawthorne "believed in original sin and predestination." On the contrary, Hawthorne's characters "suffer the consequences of guilt through the operation of human, psychological forces" (p. 64). But if this is so, Hawthorne's determinism is no more than the presupposition common to all modern science, that every event, including psychic events, must have a cause, and there is no fatal- ism implied at all. Later still, however, Turner writes that the "deterministic bent of Hawthorne's thought left him no room to believe in the efficacy of reform" (p. 98). But this is again fatalism, not scientific determinism, and a malignant fatalism, at that; the determinism of modern psychology surely does not militate against reform: if anything, it facilitates it. And even in his own day, it could not have been Hawthorne's determinism which caused his pessimistic views of reform, or how account for the fact that two of the most intransigent determinists of the nineteenth century, Herbert Spencer and Ralph Waldo Emerson, were also the fore- most prophets of nineteenth-century optimism and melioristic reform? These and a great many similar confusions in Hawthorne criti- cism can be avoided, I believe, if one begins with a definition of basic terms. Any such definitions must to an extent be stipulative rather than purely descriptive, of course, since there is no denying that there is ample justification in common usage for any and all of the conflicting meanings of the terms fate, free will, and de- terminism as they are used in literary criticism. Nor, of course, can the following definitions lay any claim to originality: on the contrary, these are the definitions which have served for years in debates among academic philosophers as a common basis for dis- cussion.5 And that they do leave ample room for debate and dis- agreement must be admitted; still, they also help, I believe, to clarify some of the confusions illustrated above. Determinism is the hypothesis that for every event in the physi- cal or psychical world there must be a necessary and sufficient cause. Since some sort of causal relationship, however defined, is at the basis of all prediction except prophecy, determinism is there- 5See, for instance, the recent symposium Determinism and Freedom, ed. Sidney Hook (New York, 1958). The philosophers included disagree widely on the compati- bility of determinism and moral responsibility, but they are on the whole agreed on the following basic definitions.</page><page sequence="5">Hawthorne's Determinism 145 fore a presupposition common to all modern science (with the pos- sible exception of subatomic physics) and to most of our common- sense thinking, as well. Determinism does not preclude a belief in God, but it does have a tendency to make supernatural agency superfluous, since a consistent determinist would deny divine interposition in the causal chain of events. Furthermore, deter- minism does not imply either an optimistic or a pessimistic view of the world's ultimate destiny: some determinists (Spengler, for instance) have believed that the world is rapidly deteriorating; others (Hegel, Spencer, Emerson) have believed that the world is inevitably improving; a third group (Hume, J. S. Mill) merely speculated, hopefully. Free will has two contradictory meanings, and which one a per- son accepts depends upon the exclusiveness of his acceptance of determinism. Libertarians or "indeterminists" hold, of course, to an indeterminate free will. This implies that there is something finally inexplicable about some conscious and deliberate deci- sions: they can never be entirely resolved into instincts, motives, or desires. One can analyze influences only so far, and then one meets with a blank "causeless" cause. This view, although not rela- tively popular in contemporary academic circles, has been held by respectable philosophers from Duns Scotus to William James and Jean-Paul Sartre, but it is not difficult to see that any such contra- causal view of free will is very difficult to define, and not very congenial to scientific prediction.6 Determinists, on the other hand, see free will as "self-deter- mined," and inconceivable otherwise. The distinction between free acts and those not free lies not in anything ultimately uncaused in the former, but basically in the consideration as to whether or not the causes for the act come from within the self or from out- side, from motives and desires or from the pressures of external circumstance. Free will as self-determined does not, of course, deny conscious deliberation. Mature and rational human beings are capable of projecting imaginatively both ideals of conduct and possible consequences of courses of action, and these considera- tions become causal factors in any ultimate decision. (Yvor Win- ters has long been using "determinism" as a club with which to 6 For two recent analytic defenses of the libertarian position, see C. A. Campbell, "Is 'Freewill' a Pseudo-Problem?" Mind, LX (1951), 441-465, and Austin Farrer, The Freedom of the Will (London, 1958).</page><page sequence="6">146 Nineteenth-Century Fiction beat Romantics, since, he maintains, Romantics are determinists, and determinism implies "automatism." 7 But it is difficult to see that the doctrine that every psychic event must have a cause im- plies anything whatever about self-conscious or purposive action, much less the denial of these. Perhaps Winters means a naive mechanism rather than determinism, but in that case he is surely wrong about the Romantics, who were for the most part deter- minists, but who were not, for the most part, mechanists.) Just as a general determinism is a postulate of most modern sci- entific investigation, so free will as self-determined is a postulate of most contemporary psychology, including Freudianism. The psychologist must assume that his predictions of a patient's future behavior will not be interrupted by uncaused and therefore un- predictable acts of an indeterminate free will, and he must also assume that he can himself, by persuasion and analysis, "deter- mine" his patient's future action. More important for literary criticism, however, I think it can be cogently argued that free will as self-determined is a necessary assumption for the novelist, as well, whatever private libertarian beliefs he may hold as a man.8 Perhaps our most common criterion in the criticism of novels is a demand for consistency of character, and this demand surely presupposes a self-determined free will. If a novelist analyzes his character's deliberations and decisions, we demand that he give us sufficient motivation for the subsequent action, and that he pro- vide grounds for this motivation in the character's past environ- ment and inherited capacities. If he does not analyze, and reports the action objectively, then we as readers infer a character and background sufficient to determine these actions, and then demand that the character's subsequent behavior conform to our expecta- tions, based on the inferred character. In either case, it seems to me, both novelist and reader are operating on the assumption that a character's actions are fully determined by his character and cir- cumstances, just as a psychologist assumes that his patient's actions are completely explicable in terms of environmental background and inherited predispositions. However this may be, the determinist of course admits that there 7See the Preface to In Defense of Reason (Denver, n. d.). 8 This seems to me to be the implication of an acute and philosophically sophisti- cated article by George Levine, "Determinism and Responsibility in the Works of George Eliot," PMLA, LXXVII (1962), 268-279.</page><page sequence="7">Hawthorne's Determinism 147 are degrees of freedom and hence of responsibility, even presup- posing a self-determined free will. The extent of one's free will may be limited, first of all, by the number of possible alternative courses of action-a limitation imposed from without. Or it may be limited by ignorance, by neurosis, or by compulsions or pas- sions so strong as to leave little time or opportunity for conscious deliberation: the act may take place without premeditation or even conscious acquiescence. We do generally hold a person less respon- sible who has committed an immoral act under one of these limi- tations of his free choice, even though such acts are really fully as "self-determined" as any others. These distinctions are espe- cially important to the novelist, since he can lend pathos and incite sympathy for his characters, as Hawthorne so often does, by show- ing them being held responsible for "less free" decisions. Finally, one can argue that the hypothesis of the free will as self- determined, if carried to its logical conclusion, absolves a person of any final moral responsibility whatever.9 In other words, if all acts are determined, then if one follows the causal chain back far enough (as Clarence Darrow did, of course), one reaches outside the self-to heredity and to early environment, to factors for which the individual could never reasonably be held responsible. This is probably merely a misunderstanding of the concept of responsi- bility, as most philosophers maintain-of the same sort which makes us "feel" that the sun does indeed rise over a stationary earth, or that parallel lines can never meet, in spite of modern geometries-but there is nevertheless a stubborn irrational feel- ing in most of us that we should be able to hold a man accountable not only for his actions, but for his very character. This feeling, too, a novelist can use to good account, as I believe Hawthorne does. Fatalism, on the other hand, is ultimately not a scientific but a religious hypothesis, and as such it depends for verification not on empirical investigation but on intuition, revelation, or authority. The fatalist de-emphasizes the purely causal element in the se- quence of events and looks instead for extra-scientific and usually moral or theological "purposes." History is primarily a revelation of a divine idea, of divine justice, of preconceptions in the mind of Providence or of God. Man is "helpless before his fate," not be- cause all events are causally determined, but because he cannot 9 For instance, see in the above symposium (note 5) the articles by Paul Edwards and John Hospers.</page><page sequence="8">148 Nineteenth-Century Fiction depend upon the orderly sequence of cause and effect since this is constantly being modified, thwarted, or interrupted by the inter- position of a purposeful agency called God, Fate, or Destiny. The fatalist, then, is usually very much opposed to a purely scientific or "natural" interpretation of events, since such a view tends to obscure the picture of history as a revelation of the will of God. American Puritans, by this account, were pre-eminently fatalists, rather than determinists: they believed that the world and each individual in it is predetermined to damnation; that an individ- ual's desire for salvation is utterly inefficacious, by itself; and that each and every conversion is an interruption of a natural causal sequence by divine intervention or interposition. Taking these terms as defined, then, I think one can come to some clear-cut and definite conclusions about Hawthorne's prac- tice in his tales and novels. First, Hawthorne was not a libertarian; he portrays his characters as patently self-determined (as is perhaps inevitable in logically constructed novels). He was obviously, how- ever, much interested in the problem of moral responsibility, espe- cially in borderline cases, and perhaps for this reason he de-empha- sizes the moment of decision, and frequently seems to hold his characters responsible for immoral acts determined upon under very severe limitations of their freedom. Finally, he is not really a fatalist except in the rather attenuated sense in which all be- lievers in a God or Providence are fatalists; although, of course, many of his characters, especially in his historical tales and novels, are fatalists. But it is in this area-of fatalism or of simple and scientific determinism-that his famous device of "multiple choice" allows the reader a dual interpretation.'0 The "punish- ment" which a Hiawthorne character undergoes for his sin may be viewed, as a Puritan would, as evidence for God's intervention in human affairs to enforce moral absolutes; on the other hand, Haw- thorne almost invariably gives the reader the choice of seeing it as no more than the working out of quite amoral and scientific natural laws. One may view an alcoholic's nightmarish visions as prompted by demons let loose to punish him by an angry Providence, or one may view them as no more than manifestations of delirium tremens. It is this purposeful equivocation on Hawthorne's part 10 This is F. 0. Matthiessen's term in his American Renaissance (New York, 1941); Yvor Winters has called this the "formula of alternative possibilities" in Maule's Curse (New York, 1938).</page><page sequence="9">Hawthorne's Determinism 149 which allows Arlin Turner to say that Hawthorne's characters "suffer the consequences of guilt through the operation of human, psychological forces," and perhaps it is what Harry Levin means by saying that Hawthorne "remained a Calvinist in psychology, if not in theology." 11 Most of Hawthorne's tales and all of his finished novels are es- sentially studies of guilt and retribution, not of moments of deci- sion. For this reason perhaps his most usual method of de-empha- sizing the "moment" is to have it occur antecedent to the story's main action. In "The Minister's Black Veil," for instance, the secret sin not only happens antecedent to the tale, but is not even explained within it. Ethan Brand's decision to succumb to the particular "Idea that possessed his life," as well as most of the ac- tion dictated by that compulsion, are all antecedent to the action told in the tale. In The Scarlet Letter, Hester's and Dimmesdale's adultery also takes place a year before the action begins. Judge Pyncheon's sinful act of omission in The House of the Seven Gables, the act which caused his cousin to spend a life in prison, and which constitutes his re-enactment of the "original" sin of his Puritan ancestor, takes place some forty years before the novel opens. Another method of de-emphasizing the moment of decision is by having it reported, and thus not allowing the reader to enter the mind of the person acting and to follow the war of conflicting motives to its ultimate conclusion-an entrance otherwise so easily affected by Hawthorne's use of the author-omniscient point of view. The decisive act in The Marble Faun, the murder of the Ahasuerus-like Capuchin, is reported to the reader first through the conversation of the culprits themselves, and then confirmed in a conversation between Miriam and Hilda. In the narrative itself, Hawthorne leads up to the moment of the crime and then inter- rupts his story with the entrance of Hilda. In a similar manner, Dimmesdale's decision to confess his sin, in The Scarlet Letter, comes first as a surprise to the reader, and then is reported by the narrator. More important than these obvious instances of Hawthorne's evading the moment is his playing down of the degree of freedom involved in such decisions. He frequently chooses to show his 11 For Turner (see note 4 above), p. 64; Levin, The Power of Blackness (New York, 1958), p. 55.</page><page sequence="10">150 Nineteenth-Century Fiction characters having to accept full responsibility for acts committed with lesser degrees of freedom; he portrays the maximum of guilt with the minimum of moral responsibility. The simplest means of doing this, of course, is to limit by out- side circumstances the alternatives open to the will. Dimmesdale's final heroic decision to reject the temptation of happiness with Hester in a foreign country is made far easier by his realization that he is a dying man. His decision to reveal his guilt is still heroic, to be sure, but the alternative of a lasting happiness has been abrogated by impending death. Another and more important way to make the self-determined will seem less free is to give the character such a passionate nature that he seems to act almost without the exertion of his conscious mind. In The Marble Faun we are told many times that Miriam has inherited a passionate nature, as Hilda has not, and in the mo- ment of decision, the moment of the murder, Miriam does not even know, or is at least by no means fully aware, that it is her glance which bade Donatello commit the crime. She recognizes that "her heart consented," but her actual complicity must be confirmed by the witness of Hilda.12 Dimmesdale, we learn from Chillingworth's observations, "has inherited a strong animal na- ture from his father or mother" (p. 160), and of course the same is true of Hester. Hawthorne himself, therefore, makes a clear dis- tinction in moral responsibility between the first sin, prompted by passion, and Dimmesdale's later sin, a product of self-conscious deliberation. Hester's and Dimmesdale's adultery Hawthorne calls "a sin of passion, not of principle" (p. 203); Dimmesdale's second evil decision, however, that of determining to evade the issue of their joint guilt, was a crime with a difference: "Tempted by a dream of happiness, he had yielded himself, with deliberate choice, as he had never done before, to what he knew was deadly sin" (p. 216). A closely related method of lessening the freedom of the self- determined will is by the use of the concept of the "ruling pas- sion," a seventeenth-century notion which of course survived in popular psychology well into the nineteenth century. The ruling passion, probably what modern psychologists would call an obses- 12 The Complete Novels and Selected Tales of Nathaniel Hawthorne, ed. Norman Holmes Pearson (New York, 1937), pp. 689-690.

Generally we hold such persons less responsible for their ac- tions, as having a lesser degree of freedom of will, but it would seem that Hawthorne held such persons fully as responsible as others. There is a possible out in the fact that Hawthorne usually seems to make the ruling passion not innate or a product of early and uncontrollable environment, but at one time accepted con- sciously and deliberately. Hollingsworth, in The Blithedale Ro- mance, has a ruling passion in the form of a "philanthropic theory" which has made of him a "bond-slave," but the author assures us that this theory was one which "he himself had conjured up" (p. 471). Ethan Brand also makes it quite clear that his ruling passion, the thirst for forbidden knowledge without regard for common humanity, is "'a sin that grew within my own breast,'" and one which he accepted consciously: " 'Freely, were it to do again, would I incur the guilt'" (p. 1189). There are other cases, however, in which the self-incurred guilt of the ruling passion is considerably less clear. Chillingworth "had begun an investigation [into Dim- mesdale's heart], as he imagined ... desirous only of truth.... But, as he proceeded, a terrible fascination, a kind of fierce, though still calm, necessity seized the old man within its grip, and never set him free again until he had done all its bidding" (p. 160). In one further case, in "The Artist of the Beautiful," Hawthorne makes it quite clear that Owen Warland's ruling esthetic passion was not self-incurred: he describes it as "an innate tendency of hiis soul [which] had only been accumulating fresh vigor" (p. 1145). If this is not a slip of the pen, then it is perhaps significant that this ruling passion does not lead to any real sin-at least not to any described as such. If there is so much evidence of Hawthorne's emphasis on a rela- tively unfree will, however, there is also evidence that he did con- sider some acts consciously, deliberately, and responsibly com- mitted. We have already noticed his clear distinction between Dimmesdale's crime of passion and his deliberate and conscious crime of "principle." In an interesting episode in The Blithedale Romance, Coverdale listens to some stories of the influence which magicians supposedly exercise over other persons' wills, and con- cludes passionately: "It is unutterable, the horror and disgust with</page><page sequence="12">152 Nineteenth-Century Fiction which I listened, and saw that, if these things were to be believed, the individual soul was virtually annihilated, and ... the idea of man's eternal responsibility made ridiculous" (p. 556). Surely Hawthorne is here protesting not only the current fad of Mesmer- ism, but also the Puritan doctrine of possession, if not predestina- tion itself. If one cannot count on Coverdale's having expressed Hawthorne's ideas, however, he makes a clearer expression of feel- ing in the personal essay "Fancy's Show-Box, a Morality." Haw- thorne has a Mr. Smith undergo the gruelling experience of having his Fancy conjure up all the schemes of evil which he has imagined in his past life but has not executed. Then Hawthorne considers Mr. Smith's degree of responsibility for these fancies, but decides, after long consideration, that Smith is ultimately responsible for deeds, not ideas (although the latter do give him a certain "kin- ship" with all sinners), and, furthermore: "In truth, there is no such thing in man's nature as a settled resolve, either for good or for evil, except at the very moment of execution." 13 This is pos- sibly as close as Hawthorne ever comes to a clear affirmation in his own person of self-conscious free will and moral responsibility -and, incidentally, to a denial of the harsh doctrine of original sin.'4 If Hawthorne is relatively unambiguous in his presentation of free will as self-determined-albeit in circumstances in which the character's moral responsibility seems severely limited-he is far more ambiguous in his use of fate and fatalism. Most of this am- 13 Works, ed. C. C. Bigelow (New York, 1923), I, 218. 14That is, original sin as the term is understood in the Calvinist tradition, as implying an innate predisposition to sin such as to preclude an unaided choice of salvation, and an inherited guilt which predestines all, including infants, to damna- tion. It is Randall Stewart's influential attribution of this harsh doctrine to Haw- thorne (in his Preface to The American Notebooks) which earns him Henry G. Fair- banks' justified rebuke in his "Sin, Free Will, and 'Pessimism' in Hawthorne," PMLA, LXXI (1956), 975-989. But Fairbanks' contention that Hawthorne "goes back beyond the Magnalia and Pilgrim's Progress and Paradise Lost to an earlier tradition of which these were all fragmentized derivatives" implies that the doctrine of original sin as total depravity originated with Protestantism, when surely it is as old as St. Augustine. But perhaps this is another term which stands in need of some analysis. Roy R. Male, in Hawthorne's Tragic Vision (Austin, Texas, 1957), writes that for Hawthorne "the Original Sin [is] the mutual love of man and woman" (p. 8). This can be evaded, Male writes (presumably by evading sexual entanglements), but only with great peril: Ethan Brand, in his efforts to avoid it, succeeds only in committing the "ab- original sin" (p. 12), or what "might be called the 'unoriginal sin' in that it originates nothing" (p. 87); and "Zenobia and Hollingsworth succeed in evading Original Sin, only to commit an abortive form of it in the end" (p. 13). One might hope that this is mere punning, but Male's serious tone belies so happy an interpretation.</page><page sequence="13">Hawthorne's Determinism 153 biguity, however, is semantic rather than theological or metaphysi- cal. When it comes to the basic groundwork of the tales and novels, it seems to me that all of the important events, whether physical or psychic, can be comprehended in a purely natural and scien- tifically determined universe, and that, if fatalism is taken as de- fined to imply some supernatural intervention in natural events so as to shape them into a moral pattern, then it is used in the stories only as an alternative explanation, usually ironically undercut by a "scientific" explanation of events. The semantic confusion results when Hawthorne uses "fate" or related terms (as we all do, casually), not to describe any real state of affairs, but rather to describe the emotional tone or coloring which events acquire in the minds of the actors or in the narrator's mind. All of us have used these terms to describe the effects fol- lowing upon a decision taken in a moment of whimsy or a moment of passion-decisions which, as it turns out, have all sorts of un- foreseen and even unforeseeable implications. This is the situa- tion or chain of events which Frost describes in his poem "The Road Not Taken"; a whimsical decision, based on the most irrele- vant of issues (in the poem the leaves on the road he chose had not been "trodden black"), has "made all the difference." Or one thinks of that famous casual decision on the part of a German of- ficer which allowed the sealed train carrying Lenin to pass to St. Petersburg, with such "fatal" consequences for all the world. It is this sort of "fate"-springing from an act of passion rather than of whimsy, to be sure-which Chillingworth is describing in the passage in The Scarlet Letter which is most often used as evidence for fatalism in the novel. He tells Hester: "By thy first step awry thou didst plant the germ of evil; but since that moment, it has all been a dark necessity.... It is our fate." 15 Her first decision, taken in a moment of passion, has involved her in a lifetime of working out the implications of her deed-and purely "natural" implications they are, certainly, given the nature of her sin and the rigid social ethics of the Puritan community in which she lives. Her situation is similar, in this one respect, to that of the protag- onist of the brief sketch entitled "Wakefield." Hawthorne here 15 Page 187 (note 12 above). Darell Abel (note 3 above) interprets these and re- lated passages as no more than rationalizations on Chillingworth's part, evasions of his guilt and moral responsibility. This would be quite in the tradition of Gothic villains, most of whom at one time or another appeal to fatalism to excuse their crimes (see, for instance, Byron's Lara, Canto 1, 313-336).</page><page sequence="14">154 Nineteenth-Century Fiction elaborates a character to fit the newspaper anecdote of a man who, in a fit of whimsy, left his wife and home and took up residence in a house down the street, where for twenty years he lived in soli- tude, occasionally spying on his wife, only to return, behaving as casually as if he had never been gone. Hawthorne describes the first decision as perfectly free and self-determined on Wakefield's part, but a decision taken without any realization of its deep conse- quences, especially in its effects on Wakefield's personality, and Hawthorne concludes: "an influence beyond our control lays its strong hand on every deed which we do, and weaves its conse- quences into an iron tissue of necessity" (p. 924). This could in- deed sound like an affirmation of fatalism (although one should note that Wakefield's first decision was taken with self-conscious freedom), but as Hawthorne goes on to describe the "conse- quences" of this deed in its effects on Wakefield's personality- his self-imposed isolation from common humanity causes even- tually a radical loss of perspective, a kind of madness, as so frequently happens in Hawthorne's stories-the consequences turn out to be the perfectly natural psychological effects of Wakefield's absurd and whimsical action. They seem like the actions of a su- pernatural agency only because they are inexorable, as are the workings of any natural law, and because Wakefield remains quite unaware of them, both in his initial decision and in his years of exile. We also frequently in casual usage ascribe events to the actions of "fate" when they seem inexplicably haphazard or random, even "capricious" (and an anthropomorphism is already incipient in the last term). This casual use of the term is of course quite opposed to that which implies a divinely ordained moral plan in worldly events; such "fates" are malignant and cruel, or merely whimsical and purblind (as Hardy's "Doomsters" in his poem "Hap"). Haw- thorne, too, uses the term in this way in several stories and sketches. In "The Ambitious Guest" the narrator takes great pains to dis- tinguish the individual moral character of each of the guests in the wayside inn, but "Fate" treats them equally, and a cataclysmic avalanche annihilates them all. In "David Swan" the country swain sleeping in a grove comes close to love, to fame and fortune, and to robbery and murder, but in each case his "Fate" is averted by caprice.</page><page sequence="15">Hawthorne's Determinism 155 The semantic confusions in our use of these terms are of course endemic in everyday language, and there is nothing peculiar about Hawthorne's use of them, nor do they apply to the basic structure of his major tales and novels. It is here that we come up against Hawthorne's "ambiguous supernaturalism," his device of "mul- tiple choice." Hawthorne frequently gives his readers the option of accepting an event or a chain of events either as simply and scien- tifically "determined," or as instances of supernatural agency, of divine and fated intervention in human affairs. The scarlet letter which appears on Dimmesdale's breast at the moment of his cli- mactic confession is of course one of the most famous of these in- stances of ambiguity, although in this case, as in so many others, Hawthorne seems by irony to give the edge to the purely natural- istic interpretations. The letter might have been a self-inflicted wound or scar, it might have been a stigma induced psychoso- matically by Dimmesdale's agony of remorse, it might have been an illusion in the minds of the observers, caused by mass hysteria- or it might have been a "fatal" and providential judgment upon him for his unconfessed sin. So in The House of the Seven Gables the Pyncheon family history might exhibit the workings of a fate which blights each succeeding generation with guilt and with the sudden, inexplicable death of Maule's curse, or it might on the other hand be no more than the inheritance of a strong passionate nature inclined to sins of greed and pride, together with a physical organism especially susceptible to attacks of some sort of apoplectic hemorrhage. Perhaps, as most critics suggest, this ambiguous literary device was suggested to Ilawthorne by the fact that the characters in his historical fiction were for the most part Puritans and therefore were inclined to interpret events fatalistically, as divine interven- tions of Providence in the affairs of men. In any case, the device has two important esthetic effects. In the first place, an alternative fatalistic interpretation for events enhances the air of Gothic gloom and mystery so pervasive in his romances and so important for their effect. Perhaps more important, it helps to satisfy that craving which I suppose we all have, in some degree, to find significant moral purpose in the events of the world in which we live: frus- trated of finding it in the amoral and natural universe around us, we turn to fiction to find it, and novelists like Hawthorne supply it.</page><page sequence="16">156 Nineteenth-Century Fiction In his practice in his major novels and tales, then, Hawthorne was a determinist (as perhaps he was constrained to be by the very fact of being a novelist), but he was not, in the full sense of the term, a fatalist. To be sure, events do ordinarily so arrange them- selves that gross sinners are "punished," although, of course, as in all tragedy, the punishment is by no means made proportionate to the crime. Chillingworth meets his fitting damnation, for instance, but Hester and Dimmesdale are punished fully as harshly, al- though their offenses are by the narrator's admission immeasurably less culpable. Whatever the punishment, in any case, it comes about by the operation of perfectly natural psychological laws and causal sequences: frequently, as in stories like "Ethan Brand," the punish- ment comes about as a result of the sinner's having cut himself off from all normal intercourse with his fellows, and consequently suffering a "separation of the head and heart," and an eventual madness-but the annals of psychology are full of such tales, if less artfully told. One could argue that a universe so arranged to pun- ish sinners must have been providentially arranged-and, indeed, since Hawthorne was a theist, he would very probably so argue- but, in any case, the god or fate of such a system, who does not in- tervene but has merely set up a prearranged universe (like the proverbial clock) to run by its own rules, is rather like the god of Leibniz or of the eighteenth-century deists, and a far cry indeed from the active and emotional Judge of orthodox Puritan the- ology. Hawthorne's major peculiarity, then, in the larger worlds of his novels, is his use of his ambiguous supernaturalism, his al- lowing his readers an alternative and fatalistic interpretation of events otherwise adequately explained by natural means. In his description of the individual psychology of his characters Hawthorne is no less a determinist, but he is also a firm believer in self-conscious and deliberative choice and in consequent moral responsibility. Here, too, however, he shows a peculiarity, in his de-emphasis of the moment of decision and in his diminution of the relative freedom of the will, and I believe this peculiarity is in the long run more important in its esthetic effects than is his much- touted device of ambiguous supernaturalism. To a large extent it is this practice which lends his novels their pervasive gloom, their air of "dark necessity," and their tragic pathos. It is this practice which serves to place in stark relief the problem mentioned above in connection with the definition of free will as</page><page sequence="17">Hawthorne's Determinism 157 self-determined: the problem of "ultimate" responsibility for one's peculiar character. There does seem to be a sense in which every person is held ultimately responsible-whether to God, to society, or to himself-for his very personality, for his every existence as an individual with his own particular drives and emotional constitu- tion. Yet in any rational scheme of things this responsibility seems unjust, even unreasonable and absurd. It was of course the pathos of this "absurdity" which Clarence Darrow used to wring clemency from judges and juries, and it is the same pathos which lies close to the heart of some of the great tragedies in western literature. It adds immensely to our pity for Oedipus that he must accept re- sponsibility for a crime committed in ignorance of the implications of his deed, and, in a different way, the more we understand of Othello's passionate temperament, of his trials in being a Moor among the white patricians of Venice, and of the depth of Jago's duplicity, the more difficult we find it to judge him. So the more we understand of Hester Prynne's character and situation-her free and enquiring mind, her warm and generous heart, her Janu- ary-May marriage to the frigid Chillingworth-that is, the more we see that her "first step awry" was ultimately determined by her heredity and by her singular circumstances, the more difficult we find it to judge her, and the more genuinely pathetic the novel be- comes in its description of the harsh judgment of the Puritan com- munity around her.</page></plain_text>
