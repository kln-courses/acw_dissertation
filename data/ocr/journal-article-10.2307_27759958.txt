<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHAPTER 5 The Malleable Body: Headshaping in Greece and the Surrounding Regions by Kirsi O. Lorentz Headshaping1 is a form of body modification involving the intentional altering of human cranial form in infancy (Fig. 5.1). This modification is based on the rapid growth and plasticity of the human cranium during the first few years of life. Headshaping is permanent and irreversible once the rapid growth of the cranium ceases. Various devices including cradleboards, bindings, and headdresses have been used to intentionally modify infant head shape, and different types of headshaping arise from the differential restriction of the growth vectors of the cranial plates. The employment of headshaping indicates a profound understanding of the human body. It requires a detailed knowledge of the timing of cranial growth and devel opment. Headshaping is an ancient form of body modification far more sophisticated than plastic surgery today in that it does not cause pain or damage hard tissues. It simply redirects the growth vectors of the cranium. A current pediatric practice, the so-called dynamic orthotic cranioplasty2 employed for "correcting" plagiocephaly (cranial asymmetry) is a modern form of headshaping. Headshaping has been practiced on all continents over periods from prehistory to the present.3 It has been used to denote gender, ethnicity, high social status, or other group affiliations.4 Aesthetic reasons for headshaping have also been cited.5 Headshaping in its different forms has thus been used as a medium for ascribing various kinds of identities on the body, with no possibility of reversal or acquisition in later life.6 Physical anthropological studies of headshaping have concentrated on its effects on the craniofacial complex, the basicranium, the intracranial vessel form, sutural complexity in the form of increased interdigitation, premature sutural fusion, cranial asymmetry, and the expression of extra sutural bones.7 Headshaping practices and their physical anthropological effects have been investigated intensely in the Americas, but little work beyond mere identification or brief descriptions has been done in the Mediterranean and the Near East.8 Until recently, no substantial evidence for headshaping had been found in prehistoric Greece. Brief early mentions of recent practices of headbinding by Dingwall9 cannot be verified at present. Given the evidence for headshaping, both archaeological and recent, in the Balkans, 1. The term headshaping is pre ferred here over such terms as "artificial cranial deformation" in that the latter implies that this cultural practice of body modification was performed to "deform," rather than to shape accord ing to cultural aesthetics and social norms.

LORENTZ Italy, Turkey, and Cyprus,10 the lack of evidence from Greece has been a curious lacuna.11 MATERIALS AND METHODS The discovery of a series of crania of clearly abnormal shape from the Neolithic cave cemetery inTharrounia, Euboia,12 provided the opportunity to investigate the potential presence of intentional cultural modification of head form in Greece.13 Skotini Cave, in the locality of Tharrounia, is one of the most im portant Neolithic sites in Euboia. The excavations in the cave and the surrounding area took place over a period of five years (1986-1991), and were conducted under the direction of A. Sampson. During the 1989 field season, a cemetery located near the Skotini Cave was excavated, dating to the early phases of the Neolithic era.14 The majority of the graves at this cemetery at Tharrounia were affected by various destructive taphonomic processes, including erosion caused by long-term agricultural activities. The shape of the burial facilities was pen tagonal or roughly trapezoidal, constructed by placing flagstones upright. According to the excavators, the structure and shape are atypical, differing from the more or less rectangular cist graves of subsequent periods. Al though the burials at Tharrounia are contemporaneous with the burials at Kephala, on the island of Kea, they differ in structure, if not shape (Kephala burial facilities have similar trapezoidal and pentagonal, as well as circular, shapes). The large quantities of pottery found at Tharrounia date from the earlier Neolithic period (phase II). All excavated burial facilities contained skeletal remains from multiple individuals. The minimum number of individuals within the recovered skeletal series is 25.15 The number of crania recovered and available for study is 13, and these are of varying degrees of completeness (see Table 5.1).

HEADSHAPING IDENTIFICATION, CLASSIFICATION, AND ANALYTICAL METHODS The term "headshaping"16 is used here to denote modification of cranial form for cultural reasons. It should be differentiated from malformations and deformations due to genetic causes, trauma, or pathological conditions. Headshaping can come about either as an unintentional effect of cultural infant care practices?such as cradleboarding, or laying babies to sleep 16. See n. 1.</page><page sequence="4">yS KIRSI O. LORENTZ consistently in a certain position on a hard surface?or as an intentional effect of manipulation of the infant head using cradleboards or particular types of devices.17 In the former case where headshaping occurs as an un intentional secondary effect, this does not rule out its subsequent intentional usage for sociocultural differentiation, following the recognition of the modification. Thus, the term headshaping denotes here both intentional and unintentional modification of the cranial shape, of cultural origin. There are at least three main headshaping types (Fig. 5.2): the circum ferential or circular type, the antero-posterior type, and the post-bregmatic type. There is great variation in headshaping types and, at times, there is some overlap between their forms.18 The circumferential or circular type includes all modifications involving bandaging the head circumferentialry. Subtypes include the differential shapes that result from this process; for example, there are circular-erect, circular-oblique, and two-band circum ferential types.19 The post-bregmatic type is so far clearly attested only in Cyprus and consists of the superior flattening of the calvarium produced presumably by securing particular kinds of headgear on the superior aspect of the growing infant head.20 Antero-posterior headshaping denotes the flattening or modification of the occipital part of the cranium, the frontal part of the cranium, or both parts; but without a circumferential involve ment of the whole cranial vault. The various types and subtypes of antero posterior modification can be brought about by the use of cradleboards, with or without additional accessories, or by securing particular kinds of headgear on the growing infant head. Given the overall rarity of headshaping and the complexity of its expressions, it is important to be able to differentiate between pathologi cal conditions, unintentional positional causes, and intentional causes for altered head shapes. The following information can be employed: 1. Alterations of cranial shape due to environmental causes (including headshaping) rather than growth disturbances and genetic deficiencies do not result in reduction of the brain case volume. Thus, crania with greatly reduced volumes may be attributed to pathological causes.21 These individuals are often nonviable and die in infancy or childhood, and so these condi tions are evidenced more often in immature skeletal remains. 2. Pathological premature suture closure, for example in the lambdoidal or sagittal sutures, results in different morphological expressions (see discussion below) than unintentional or inten tional occipital flattening, which affects the same sutures.22 3. Unintentional environmental alterations of the cranial form are often asymmetrical and do not occur uniformly throughout a population. Positional plagiocephaly is an example of this phe nomenon.23 4. Intentional headshaping aims at symmetrical shapes (cross culturally attested) and may be uniform or patterned within a population. Cranial features indicating intentional cranial shape modification include pad and binding impressions, and particu lar features characteristic of various types of headshaping.24 17.

Intentional headshaping may involve differential degrees of severity of the alteration and/or different types of alterations within the same population.25 When the degree of headshap ing is employed to signal social difference, there are likely to be classes of severity (gradation) rather than a continuum. 6. Headshaping as an unintentional secondary effect of culturally specific infant care practices, such as cradleboarding,26 is likely to be expressed universally within a population, with a con tinuum of degree of severity without marked cutoff points or a large number of extreme cases (Fig. 5.3). Thus, it emerges that it may be possible to differentiate between the altered head shapes caused by pathological, environmental, positional, and cultural (unintentional and/or intentional) causes, provided that there is a large enough sample population available. This necessitates attention to detail on two different levels: the individual cranium and the population. At the population level, the degree of severity of headshaping, the variation expressed in this degree of severity, the nature of its expression (gradation or continuum), and the prevalence of headshaping all help to distinguish cultural from noncultural head shape modifications.27 Analysis of altered crania also entails some specialized procedures. In addition to complete descriptions, detailed data on the following features that are typically associated with headshaping are important: 1. Extrasutural bones. The etiology of extrasutural bones (sutural bones, supernumerary bones, and ossicles) has been debated. The main focus of the debate has been the extent to which the Figure 5.3.

Previous studies of the relationship between extrasutural bones and headshaping have provided ambiguous results, likely due their failure to investigate different headshaping types sepa rately. The most recent study by O'Loughlin28 indicates that both antero-posterior and circumferential types of headshaping affect the frequency of some types of extrasutural bones. In par ticular, these headshaping types exhibited significantly greater frequencies of lambdoid ossicles in O'Loughlins study. Presence and frequency of extrasutural bones can be assessed by record ing the number of extrasutural bones in the different cranial sutures, using the method presented by O'Loughlin.29 These include extrasutural bones at the coronal, pterionic, sagittal, apical, lambdoid, asterionic, parietomastoid, occipitomastoid, squamosal, and parietal notch regions (see Fig. 5.4). Hauser and Stefano30 present even more detailed divisions of the cranial sutures, allowing scoring of fragmentary cranial material. 2. Cranial synostoses. Craniosynostosis involves the premature fusion of one or more of the calvarial sutures.31 Following the method presented by White32 premature cranial synostosis can be scored as present or absent. Premature synostosis is identi fied by a marked differential fusion between one suture (or sutural region) and the other major vault sutures (i.e., the suture scored as displaying premature synostosis must be obliterated both endocranially and ectocranially when the other sutures are still open). Figure 5.4.

Sutural interdigitation. Interdigitation refers to another aspect of relative complexity of the cranial sutures, in addition to the presence and frequency of extrasutural bones. As in the case of extrasutural bones, it is debated whether the extent of sutural interdigitation is attributable to genetic factors, environmental factors (mechanical loading, such as headshaping), or both.33 A study by Anton, Jaslow, and Swartz34 indicates that different types of headshaping may have differential effects on the extent of sutural interdigitation. However, their results are ambiguous, and more studies are needed. The researchers quantified mea sures of sutural complexity (interdigitation and number and size of extrasutural bones) from digitized tracings of 13 sutures and compared these among three groups of crania showing antero posterior headshaping, circumferential headshaping, or no mod ification. This method requires complete crania, however, and as such is not applicable to fragmentary materials, including series like Tharrounia. The degree of interdigitation can be assessed in incomplete crania by scoring sixteen separate portions of the coronal (six, three on each side), sagittal (four), and lambdoidal (six, three on each side) sutures, according to the method pre sented in Hauser and Stefano.35 Using this method potentially allows for the comparative assessment of sutural complexity on fragmentary crania, where obtaining interdigitation data on the full length of a suture may not be possible. 4. Asymmetries. Some researchers have referred to a possible increase in cranial asymmetry in connection to antero-posterior headshaping achieved by cradleboarding.36 Kohn, Leigh, and Cheverud explored the vault modification of Hopi crania using finite element scaling, and found significant correlation of size asymmetry with direction of modification in the cranial vault.37 However, few satisfactory metric or morphometric methods38 have been developed allowing quantitative analysis of incom plete crania. The method presented by Zonenshayn, Kronberg, and Souweidane39 may provide a way forward. It is based on semiautomated, computerized analysis of digital images of the superior aspect of the cranium, surrounded by a headband with nasion and inion indicated. Cranial index of symmetry (CIS) can be calculated based on the shape and area of each hemi sphere. This method is applicable to both complete and incom plete crania, as well as living populations, potentially allowing quantitative comparisons of cranial asymmetry between archae ological and living populations exhibiting cranial shape modifi cations (such as headshaping, or positional plagiocephaly). Various other methods of shape analysis can also be applied to the analysis of headshaping. One of the recent methods is presented by Friess and Baylac.40 It uses elliptic Fourier analysis of Procrustes aligned outlines. The problem with this method, as with many other shape analysis methods, is that it is only applicable to relatively complete crania.41 33. Anton, Jaslow, and Swartz 1992. 34.

This cranium has been modified by pronounced headshaping. The curvature of the parietals is clearly increased. The superior aspect of the cranium appears sphenoid, and the sagittal suture is depressed, especially in the posterior half. The occipital squama curvature is decreased, and there is a depressed area on the Figure 5.5. Antero-posterior head shaping at Tharrounia. Cranium 9, left lateral (top) and superior (bottom) views.

LORENTZ occipital forming a clear concavity, a possible pad or binding impression. The frontal involvement is not clear. There is a small extrasutural bone at lambda (apical extrasutural bone), and at least two, but possibly three or four, joining extrasutural bones in a row in the right part of the lambdoidal suture, where fragmentation complicates further analysis. The expression of these extrasutural bones is similar to the conjoining extrasutural bones in the extrasutural bone bands occurring in the antero posteriorly shaped crania in the Neolithic Khirokitia series in Cyprus (Fig. 5.6).44 The width of the probable band of extrasutural bones on cranium 9 is ca. 27 mm. There is no clear post-coronal depression. Due to the incomplete nature of the crania available for analysis from Tharrounia, only broad estimates of age and sex could be performed (see Table 5.2). It seems that headshaping was practiced universally so that all individuals received the treatment in infancy at Neolithic Tharrounia. However, there are clear differences in the intensity or extent of headshap ing among the crania. Table 5.3 gives details of the extrasutural bone presence and number in the lambdoidal suture in the Tharrounia crania. It should be noted that full assessment of extrasutural bone presence in all sutures of all crania was also not possible due to the incompleteness of the crania. Within the Tharrounia series, premature cranial synostosis is pres ent in three examples, crania 8, 9, and 10. The premature synostosis in cranium 8 is asymmetrical, involving the left coronal suture only. Slight cranial asymmetry accompanies this asymmetrical synostosis. Crania 9 and 10 both display premature sagittal synostosis, assessed by the discrepancy between the fused and almost obliterated sagittal suture and the other cranial sutures, which are still open. In the case of cranium 10, the lamb dic part of the lambdoid suture is also fused. It is interesting to note that both of these crania display pronounced headshaping, occupying positions 1 and 3 in the headshaping extent seriation respectively. The extent of Figure 5.6.

The lack of secure associations between post-cranial elements and the crania prevent use of aging methods based on post-cranial elements. Assignation of individual crania to the broad category of "adult" is based on general morphological features (Schwartz 1995) and the fusion of the spheno-basilar synchondrosis. Sub-adult age estimates are based on morphology and the developmental stage of the dentition (Smith 1991; Moorrees, Fanning, and Hunt 1963; Ubelaker 1989; Lorentz and Manolis, forthcoming). Abbrevia tions: A = adult, SA = sub-adult. ** Sex estimations are based on cranial morphology (Schwartz 1995; Lorentz and Manolis, forthcoming).

Abbreviations: F = female, M = male. headshaping (Table 5.2) was qualitatively determined by visual inspection, following O'Loughlin.45 Several crania occupy the same position in the seriation as to extent of headshaping: crania 7, 9, and 12, for example, all display equally pronounced antero-posterior headshaping. Position 1 in the seriation denotes the most pronounced antero-posterior headshaping present in Tharrounia, while position 8 represents the least pronounced. Crania 4 and 13 could not be placed in the seriation, as they are not com plete enough for assessment. The lack of male individuals high up in the seriation could be taken as an indication of potential gender differentiation as to the extent of headshaping. However, due to the problems with sex estimation (the number of subadults and the fragmentary nature of the cranial remains) and the small sample size, it is not possible to arrive at conclusions on this. Pathological premature cranial synostosis can cause modification of the head shape, but in such cases the sagittal suture is often raised,46 not depressed as in the Tharrounia examples. Further, the lack of cranial synos tosis in the other similarly modified crania within the Tharrounia series negates the possibility that premature cranial synostosis would have caused the type of modifications seen in the sample. Instead, the fusion visible in crania 9 and 10 maybe the consequence of tensile forces on cranial sutures caused by headshaping.47 White48 suggests that headshaping devices cre ate tensile forces on the sagittal suture during the peak growth period of the parietals, and that these forces may induce an adaptive response that 45.

The asymmetry of the cra nial vault of cranium 10 may be the result of cradleboarding and induced premature sagittal synostosis. The etiology of craniosynostosis is unclear. O'Loughlin49 has posited a multifactorial etiology involving genetics, biochemical abnormalities, and environmental constraints. Further research into the possible connection between premature cranial synostosis and headshaping is needed. Table 5.4 details the interdigitation assessment conducted according to the method published by Hauser and Stefano.50 No assessments of inter digitation could be conducted on crania 7 and 13 due to high fragmenta tion, and Tharrounia cranium 6 allowed only one assessment. The rest of the crania allow between 5 and 11 assessments each, and in no cranium is a complete assessment possible. There does not seem to be any correlation between the distribution of the combination interdigitation scores51 and the severity of headshaping.52 However, it should be noted that the amount of missing data prevents sta tistical analyses.

LORENTZ Comparison of the Tharrounia and the Khirokitia (Cyprus, Neo lithic)53 series crania reveals significant similarities in headshaping type and prevalence, both showing antero-posterior type headshaping with universal prevalence. The Tharrounian series does not, however, contain such pronounced cases of antero-posterior headshaping as those found at Khirokitia, where some of the crania display almost fully concave occipital squama.54 DISCUSSION Other Evidence of Headshaping from Greece Is Tharrounia the only site in the area of modern Greece with evidence of headshaping? This is unlikely, but a lot of basic research is still needed to locate series that might potentially show evidence of headshaping. Further, due to the fragmentary nature of many of the skeletal series in Greece, restorations of at least the parietal regions are needed to enable the assess ment of the presence or absence of headshaping. In the following section, some notes on potential headshaping evidence from other sites and skeletal series from Greece are discussed. It should be stressed that what follows is by no means a final, comprehensive, or conclusive list. At least one cranium from the Athenian Agora shows modifica tion.55 Cranium 13AA56 dating from the Roman period displays clear antero-posterior headshaping, with slight plagiocephaly (the right side protrudes slightly more posteriorly).57 There is no evidence of premature suture closure, as all of the cranial sutures are of a similar fusion stage (mostly visible and unfused). The posterior flattening centers on lambda, but there are no clear localized depressions in this region, nor is there any clear frontal involvement, apart from slight asymmetry corresponding to the posterior asymmetry mentioned above. The posterior third of the pa rietals show lateral expansions, making the superior aspect of the cranium appear sphenoid. There is a clear post-coronal depression. There are no extrasutural bones present. The extent of antero-posterior modification is such that it would have been clearly visible with a certain kind of hairstyle. Cranium 14AA, belonging to an adult male of same date, also displays "clear cut lambdoid flattening"58 according to Angel. Angel59 also mentions that another cranium, cranium 27AA,60 of Neolithic date and from the same series, has "a sloping forehead, flat lambda region, and rising vertex profile" with "definite skull and face broadening." This description seems consistent with the shape modifications present at Tharrounia and begs the question of whether or not there is some antero-posterior modification present. Unfortunately, it has not yet been possible to locate this cranium. These preliminary findings would warrant the complete survey of the Athenian Agora series to assess the presence of headshaping within this important skeletal sample. Some of the crania collected from modern Athenian cemeteries seem to show signs of shape modification, possibly related to midwifery practices of binding the infant's head. This is consistent with the evidence for the 53. Angel 1953,1961. 54. Lorentz 2003b. 55.1 am grateful to John Camp for providing the opportunity to view this cranium. 56.

Sporadic and vague mentions of headshaping in Crete, both in recent and in archaeological populations, have also been made by Von Fiirst,63 Kurth and Rohrer-Ertl,64 and Dingwall.65 It is likely that the current paucity of secure evidence for headshaping from Greece is an artifact of the current research situation, rather than a real absence of the practice itself. However, if the practice really is unusual, the Tharrounia material is remarkable and would require a very specific kind of cultural interpretation. Headshaping in the Mediterranean and the Near East Table 5.5 presents some of the archaeologically known evidence for headshaping from the Near East. The areas with current unpublished and published evidence for headshaping from this wide region include Turkey, Iran, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and the southern Levant, as well as Cyprus, Greece, and Crete. It should be noted that it is only for Cyprus that we so far have a headshaping sequence researched in sufficient detail to begin to understand the cultural contexts in which the different types and combina tions of types of headshaping were employed.66 In Cyprus,67 headshaping occurs from the earliest known Neolithic mortuary series to at least the Early Iron Age. Interestingly, until the Late Bronze Age, and specifically until the Late Cypriot II period, there seems to be only one type of headshaping present in Cyprus, the so-called antero-posterior type. However, during the Late Cypriot, the headshaping practices become much more prolific, with as many as three different types of headshaping (antero-posterior, post-bregmatic, circumferential), as well as non-modified individuals. It is conceivable that headshaping in Greece or in Cyprus did not arise in isolation from practices in surrounding regions and links between the information about Near Eastern practices shown in Table 5.5 and evi dence from the Mediterranean should be explored. As the overall extent of skeletal evidence for headshaping in Greece is as yet poorly understood, the following discussion focuses on Cyprus and its interconnections as an example of potential avenues for future research. Although regions such as Iran may seem very far away from Cyprus, it should be noted that the Ubaid interaction sphere was vast, and many of the sites close enough to Cyprus to have an impact in some form, even if secondarily, were connected to this Ubaid sphere. The Ubaid phenomenon occurred in Mesopotamia between about 6000 b.c. or earlier, and 3800 b.c. It can be divided into six different chronological phases according to differences in pottery. Ubaid pottery is found in settled villages along the great rivers of Mesopotamia, the Tigris and Euphrates, but it seems that members of these communities traveled far in search of new lands and natural resources. Some went north, fol lowing the river systems to their sources. Others went downstream (south) as far as the Arabian Peninsula. By 4000 b.c. the influence of the Ubaid 61. Hasluckl947. 62.

Whether this spread involved an actual movement of peoples or mimicry of material culture is less certain. Ubaid pottery is found as far afield as Arabia and Iran.68 The evidence detailed in Table 5.5 seems to suggest that in addition to pottery and temple architecture, people living within the Ubaid sphere had another thing in common: circumferential headshaping. The evidence from sites such as Eridu in Iraq, the early Iranian sites, and the sites situated in the southeast of modern Turkey (Degirmentepe and ?eyh Hoyuk) seems to be consistent with this hypothesis, warranting its more detailed investiga tion in the future.69 The evidence from Byblos, at a reasonable distance from Cyprus, falls close to the latter part of this period (second half of the 4th millennium B.C.). The first archaeologically detected evidence for circumferential headshaping from Cyprus dates from the Late Cypriot period (1600-1050 B.C.), a couple of thousand years later than the very similar Ubaid related circumferential headshaping. This begs the question of a possible connection between these occurrences of the same form of headshaping in Cyprus and on the mainland. In order to fully understand whether there are cultural transfers involved or whether it is rather a ques tion of parallel innovation, it is paramount that the skeletal evidence for headshaping from sites dating to the intervening periods is analyzed in more detail in the future (e.g., Early Bronze Age evidence from Karata? in Turkey, and Ras Shamra and Minet el Beida in Syria). In this context it is interesting to note the iconographic similarities noted by many research ers between the anthropomorphic figurines of the Ubaid period70 and the later "Birdfaced" figurines found in Cyprus and dated to the Late Cypriot Bronze Age.71 Other potential geographical and temporal patterns of interest emerg ing from Table 5.5 include the early evidence for circumferential head shaping from the area of Iran and the possible cessation of circumferential headshaping by the Hellenistic-Byzantine period, although evidence for antero-posterior headshaping continues to be found. The above discussion and inferences are necessarily preliminary in nature due to the lack of detail in publications mentioning headshaping evidence in the region. SOCIOCULTURAL CONTEXT Headshaping is inherently tied up with sociocultural practices related to the care of children, which may be seen as traditional and slow to change. It thus has a heightened potential to serve as a cultural marker when investigating regional connections and, better still, to act as an indicator of the nature and intensity of culture contact, migration and population movement, cultural diffusion, and acculturation. Display artifacts (artifacts used to display socioeconomic and/or political prestige and power), such as daggers, earrings, and pots, are adopted and move much more easily between populations and areas than does headshaping. Further, the study of differ ential headshaping practices has the potential to aid our understanding of 68. Yoffee and Clark 1993, p. 265; Oates 1993, pp. 409-410, 414-415; Moorey 1994, p. 154. 69.

LORENTZ emerging complex societies, and the ways in which past societies employed bodily markers and modifications for denoting hierarchical positions, as well as other forms of sociocultural difference. How do cultural practices of body modification come about? How did it occur to people to begin modifying cranial shape? When a group of people adopt the practice of headshaping, two explanations can be invoked: culture contact and original innovation. First, let us consider the situation where a population adopts the practice of body modification through culture contact with a population that is already practicing headshaping. Due to the length of time needed to bring about a permanent modification of the head shape72 and the need to appreciate the rather narrow window of opportunity presented by the progress of cranial growth, it is improbable that headshaping was adopted through sporadic culture contact. Some kind of "apprenticeship," or a prolonged period of observation at least, would likely have been needed. So far, we have considered only the practical aspects of the acquisition of the knowledge of how to bring this body modification about. We also need to consider the intricacies involved in the conceptual acceptance, and the cultural context that would have allowed or indeed spurred the adoption of such a practice. Sociocultural practices related to the care of children rarely change abruptly, and often retain traditional aspects, even when other realms of culture show considerable malleability.73 In addition, many village-based societies are highly prescriptive in terms of individual appearance and dress. It is unlikely that headshaping was begun as a whim or fashion (thus, it is unlike many modern body modifications). It is conceivable that a cultural demand for a highly visual marker of sociocultural difference would be needed to motivate the adoption of this rather labor-intensive and time consuming modification, which requires detailed knowledge. This kind of demand could arise, for example, in a situation where the population already practicing headshaping occupies a higher social status in cultural exchanges, or its sociocultural (including ritual and religious) and/or eco nomic practices, material culture, or technology are seen as desirable and linked to headshaping practices.74 Headshaping has been used in various historical and archaeological contexts to denote status.75 Further, headshaping is done to one in infancy by others. It is not the kind of body modification that can be brought about at will later in life or instigated by the individual concerned. This aspect draws attention to the fact that it is the caretakers, and those who would have held power over the forms of care children received, who decided whether and what kind and intensity of modification was introduced. Thus, if headshaping was used for denoting status, it would have not been possible for an in dividual seeking power to bring about this modification later in life. This indicates a close link between the use of headshaping for denoting status and hereditary or ascribed status. Likewise, if headshaping was used to denote membership of a sociocultural group, be it ethnic or another kind of a group, it would not have been possible for an individual to instigate such modification on themselves upon joining such a group. This may indicate a certain rigidity for sociocultural groups using headshaping as a marker of difference. Headshaping would have been a barrier to change 72.

Thus, headshaping is unlike aspects of dress or bodily modifications that can be performed in adulthood (such as scarifications or plastic surgery) in that it has to be planned and instigated in infancy, by others. However, how does headshaping originally come about? It is unlikely that there was a single area of origin for the varied headshaping practices known from all over the world and from different time periods. The practice could have arisen independently at different time periods and locations. A significant cognitive leap is required to move from the detailed observa tion of the modificatory power of devices (for example, cradleboards) and practices (swaddling, laying babies to sleep on relatively hard surfaces in consistent positions), to the conscious and intentional exploitation of the observed plasticity of the growing human head. Further, only particular cultural conditions would have conceivably allowed the widespread adop tion and elaboration of intentional modification of the head shape by a whole population or significant groups within it. It seems probable that the use of cradleboards to transport and protect infants, as attested ethnographically, caused the first significant modifications of the head form. These effects were subsequently observed and then intentionally exploited by caretakers. Certainly in Cyprus, the earliest known type of headshaping, the antero-posterior type, is consis tent with this hypothesis. The earliest known evidence comes from the Kissonerga-Mylouthkia wells.76 The cranium found at this site is dated to the Cypro-PPNB period.77 It shows a moderate extent of antero-posterior headshaping that could have come about simply as a secondary effect of cradleboarding. However, already during the Khirokitian Neolithic (7000/6500 B.c-5800/5500 B.C.),78 the intensity and variation in antero posterior type headshaping within the skeletal series from the site of Khirokitia, together with large concavities on the posterior aspect of some of the crania, suggest clearly intentional modification of the head shape.79 Much later in the Cypriot cultural sequence new headshaping types are introduced: Late Bronze Age II sees the introduction and adoption of at least two additional types, the so-called post-bregmatic (also known as the "Cypriot" type) and the circumferential type. Indications of the different type of headshaping devices used to achieve these forms can be gained through the detailed analysis of morphological changes within the different types.80 The antero-posterior type features are consistent with the use of cradleboards: the occipital flattening is most likely a result of a consistent supine position while attached to a relatively hard, flat surface. The frontal impressions visible in some of the antero-posterior modified crania most likely relate to accessories used to bind the head to the cradleboard. It should be noted, however, that it is enough to swaddle the infant body tightly on the board to result in occipital flattening. Use of such devices is docu mented ethnographically as well as archaeologically.81 Cypriot coroplastic art also depicts cradleboards. The dating of these depictions of freestanding cradleboards is somewhat problematic due to their provenance from illicit excavations, but Karageorghis states the Early Cypriot period as a probable date for the freestanding cradleboards and the Middle Cypriot period for the depictions of plank figurines holding cradleboarded infants.82 76.

Karageorghis 1991.</page><page sequence="20">94 KIRSI O. LORENTZ It is conceivable that the two other general types of headshaping in Cyprus, the post-bregmatic and the circumferential types, were achieved with the use of a freestanding device, attached to the head only and un related to cradleboarding. This would be consistent with the changes in the anthropomorphic depictions of infants throughout time as well. Such freestanding devices could include bands, boards, or other artifacts secured to the head by bands.83 Thus, we see a trajectory from the use of a large artifact used also for other purposes?the cradleboard?to the use of freestanding devices attached to the head with the sole purpose of modi fying the head form, known archaeologically by the Late Cypriot II and continuing at least until the Iron Age. The fact that headshaping occurs in very rich Late Cypriot Bronze Age tombs, for example in Enkomi and at Kalavasos-Ayios Dhimitrios,84 indicates the possibility that headshaping during the Late Cypriot period was related to social status and illustrates the very crucial position of the young85 in realizing the socioculturally prestigious body form for privileged families. Due to the so far unique nature of the Tharrounia finds from Greece, and the fragmentary condition of the skeletal material, it is difficult to make far reaching conclusions on the beginnings of this practice in Greece. However, the type of headshaping present in the Tharrounia skeletal series is consistent with the use of cradleboards. All of the Tharrounia crania that can be assessed for the presence of headshaping display evidence of antero posterior modification, indicating that all individuals at Tharrounia were affected to some extent by headshaping practices. There is no artifactual evidence for headshaping devices from Tharrounia, but some of the features of morphology on the modified crania point to possibly intentional attempts to shape the infant head. These include the small concavities on the occipital bone and the lambda region. The pronounced extent of antero-posterior headshaping on crania 9 and 10 points to the possible intentionality of the practice at Tharrounia. However, until larger series of skeletal material are available, the evidence may be viewed as inconclusive although consistent with the hypothesis positing existence of intentional headshaping during the Greek Neolithic. Further research systematically assessing a wide sample of skeletal collections in Greece, starting from collections of similar time periods to Tharrounia and moving to the preceding and succeeding periods and surrounding regions, is needed to illuminate the full cultural context of headshaping in Tharrounia and in Greece. CONCLUSIONS The skeletal series from Neolithic Tharrounia displays the earliest substan tial evidence for headshaping in Greece. The type of headshaping attested is antero-posterior, and the subtype is occipital flattening. The occurrence of headshaping at Tharrounia is likely universal, with all individuals receiving treatment that resulted at least in a slight modification of the head form. Several crania show a pronounced form of modification. It is difficult to ascertain whether the practice of headshaping is intentional at Tharrounia, but several corroborative factors point to this possibility. These include the very pronounced extent of headshaping in crania 7, 9, and 12, and the 83. For photographs of actual head shaping devices constructed of boards and string, see Imbelloni 1932. 84.

The need to further investigate headshaping practices in Greece be comes clear when one considers that headshaping is known from various time periods and from all the surrounding regions, including Anatolia, the Balkans, Levant, Cyprus, and Italy. The analysis of the Tharrounia skeletal series shows that headshaping was practiced also in prehistoric Greece. It is suggested that the previous lack of evidence for headshaping on the Greek mainland and islands is more a function of the lack of research into such practices rather than the result of an actual absence of this cultural practice in Greece. The presence of headshaping at Tharrounia also indicates the existence of special kinds of infant care practices, relating both to the sleeping ar rangements of infants and to the intentional modification of their bodies. This type of intentional modification may have been used as a marker of social difference to denote differences in gender, status, ethnicity, and/or other social groups. The important discoveries at Tharrounia should spur us on to investigate the cultural employment of the human body and its modification in prehistoric Greece. REFERENCES 86.
