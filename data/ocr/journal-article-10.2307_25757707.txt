<plain_text><page sequence="1">Nuaulu Sacred Shields The Reproduction of Things or the Reproduction of Images? Roy Ellen University of Kent at Canterbury Introduction In an earlier published lecture (Ellen 1988c) I examined uses of the concept of fetishism in anthropology, Marxism and psychology as a particular case of the interplay between theories of cognition and collective representations. In summary, I argued that those classificatory end-products to which the word 'fetish' is often applied cannot be understood simply as special kinds of objects, or defined in terms of their generic functional attributes. Neither do they reflect a particular mental condition. Rather, they reveal a variable combination of four underlying features of categorisation and representation characteristic of all thought. These are concretisation; animation (including anthropomorphisation); conflation of signifier with signified; and an ambiguous relationship of control between person and object. All he on a processual continuum which begins with the identification of categories, relationships and phenomena, and proceeds - via reification and iconification - to their personification. In this sequence, what we might loosely describe as 'fetishization' appears with a shift from the balanced simultaneity of signifier and signified towards 'the thing in itself. This analytical exercise was an attempt, if you like, to deconstruct the notion of fetishism; not to dismiss it as a complete chimera, but to persuade that in identifying the component parts of that concept as others have apparently used it, we can locate a more precise and helpful way of describing certain objectified phenomena. In that same article I illustrated the attribution of the properties of living organisms with brief reference to Nuaulu sacred shields. In this paper I wish to explore this case in more detail, and in particular the sequence of events culminating in the replacement of an old shield as I witnessed them unfolding between April and December 1970 in the village of Rohua. I claim that while the term 'fetish' as it has been handed down to us is not an ultimately helpful ETNOFOOR, III (1) 1990, pp. 5-25 5</page><page sequence="2">scientific construct, the various characteristics to which it conventionally alludes do - once teased out - enable us to grasp better the role of certain objects in Nuaulu cultural life. And to do this we must begin with an examination of the ritual reproduction of descent groups. The social reproduction of clans and houses In 1970 the Nuaulu1 of south central Seram constituted a small population of about 500 individuals with a mode of subsistence focussed on swidden cultiva tion, hunting and foraging (this latter mainly comprising the extraction of palm sago); and occupying five villages in the vicinity of the Muslim kerajaan of Sepa. It remains to this day a collectivity of 12 patrilineal clans (ipan) in alliance with each other, and to a certain extent with other non-Nuaulu clans, preferentially through ties of bilateral cross-cousin marriage. Though in the past political or ganisation has occasionally encompassed all clans, such unity has generally been short-lived and fragile, for the most part a function of external circumstances and hegemony (Ellen 1988a: 118-19). The clans are, by common consent, the most durable and important political entities in Nuaulu internal politics (Ellen 1978:11-17), though they have now lost much of the secular autonomy they once had. This much has to be said to understand why it should be that so much time and effort is still invested in activities dedicated to their ritual reproduction. The clan is the focus of most Nuaulu ritual activity; even birth ritual has a clan dimension as the recognised means of ensuring recruitment, and therefore effective social reproduction and survival. The clan is at once a social and ma terial entity. It is a body of persons who are born, marry, have children, die, and so maintain its continuity through albeit tenuous mortal links of the flesh stretching from a mythically-defined, but barely measurable, beginning into an unknown and possibly infinite future. But the future is not automatically as sured. It has to be worked at; and that is a primary role of ritual. As a physical entity, the clan consists of a ritual house (or houses), plus an assemblage of sa cred material objects, which embody the essence of clan-ness in a way which living human persons do not, and cannot. But although what the objects con vey - their sacredness, their power, their embodiment of an ancestral presence - is continuous, the objects themselves, the vehicles, are like humans in having life-histories whose ultimate end-point is their destruction or decomposition. I shall return to this important point shortly. Clans are composed of two halves (clan sections) called numa (house); each of which is similarly and simultaneously social and physical, focussing on a particu lar ritual house, either numa onate or numa Jcapitane, and constituting a cultural category long recognised as characteristic of large parts of eastern Indonesia (Fox 1980, Van Wouden 1968). The sections are complementary: in traditional terms ritual authority being vested in the head of one (onate) and secular military 6</page><page sequence="3">authority vested in the head of the other (kapitane). This distinction might be held to be slightly misleading, as both heads are necessarily ritual specialists and ritual in the sense often understood cannot easily be separated from much else the Nuaulu do. However, the onate is structurally in a privileged position as head of the clan, primus inter pares, and with the added and ultimate ritual responsibilities which that entails. As with the clan, the social fate of the numa is in a very real way bound up with the physical fate of the house and its sacred contents. Over and above routine life-crisis ceremonies, most Nuaulu ritual is devoted to the building of sacred clan houses, and a considerable amount of time is invested in activities connected with this - activities which are themselves construed as sacred (Ellen 1986). But the 'house' is not merely the physical framework, nor the social group which lives in it or which focusses its identity upon it; it is also and essen tially its physical contents, particularly those sacred articles (monne) located, in accordance with Nuaulu symbolic calculus, towards the northeastern corner (ibid.: 18). Such paraphernalia includes certain spears, pots, head-dresses, the bark loincloths of male neophytes from past initiation ceremonies, European and oriental glazed wares and cloth obtained in bridewealth and other exchanges and offerings, and shields. In addition, there is the basket (sokate) which hangs un derneath the shelf at the east end, and in which dwell the ancestral spirits of the house. It is these objects and their spiritual congeners which provide the inner continuity of the numa and clan, which give 'breath' to what is openly and conventionally conceptualised as a living entity, and which link the generations of transient humanity. A concrete manifestation of these metaphysical asser tions is to be found in those rites in the house-building cycle which accompany the transfer of ritual paraphernalia from an old to a new house. The objects themselves are often time-worn, and like the house they are treated with the reverence properly accorded elders and ancestors. Their removal, certainly their destruction, and even in some cases the revelation of their presence to non-clan members, is a likely harbinger of misfortune, and undermines the very existence of the social clan or numa. Given this, a very practical problem for Nuaulu, and especially for those elders who guard them, and upon whose shoulders the burden of their protection rests heavily, is what happens when such objects get broken or suffer the vagaries of time. What, in fact, does happen very much depends on the kind of object in question, and in this respect we might usefully distinguish monne objects which originate locally, the reproduction of which the Nuaulu can more-or-less control, from those which come from outside, and over which ultimately they have no control at all. Certain key trade objects, such as Patola cloth of Indian origin and old porcelain, are irreplaceable at the present time; something which causes much anxiety. To some extent replacement by second best objects - cheap modern Chinese trade plates for porcelain and local eastern Indonesian textiles for Patola - is acceptable; where such replacement is not an acceptable alternative, the loss of items threatens to undermine entire rituals 7</page><page sequence="4">and ritual cycles (Ellen 1988b:131). Some objects, however, can be replaced - at least in theory - and these include barkcloth, head-dresses, baskets, even the houses which contain them, and - the focus of this analysis - sacred shields. Nevertheless, that the physical materials for manufacture are locally accessible, and the technical skills as well, does not necessarily mean that the process of replacement is not without risk. It is vital that everything be undertaken in the correct ritualised manner: no detail must be omitted, every operation must be in the right sequence, each stage accompanied at the right time with the right incantation and movements. Failure to comply with what is seen as ancestrally ordained decree, however minute the offence, may pose great dangers to the fortunes of the living. If the loss of sacred objects by whatever means, or failure to replace them, is seen as hazardous, it is no less so than the process by which they are re-made and re-vitalised. Nuaulu shields Before the onset of an effective Pax Neerlandica one hundred years ago, the shield (aniaue) served the very practical purpose of bodily protection and - perhaps more importantly - parrying during armed combat. Indeed, their size and shape alone suggests that shields could have offered little shelter, and so might more correctly be described as parrying boards (plate 1). Although this has long ceased to be their principal use, they were reportably employed during the short-lived Republic of the South Moluccas, when Nuaulu auxiliaries fought with other separatists a long-drawn out guerilla campaign against the Jakarta government from the forests of highland Seram. They have also been used more recently still in some hand-to-hand fighting arising from conflict between Nuaulu individuals, and between Nuaulu and outsiders. However, their main role at the present time is in the performance of the auwoti dance by young initiated males. This takes place at sunrise following a night of Aahuae dancing, and formerly heralded head-hunting or raiding. Nowadays, Jcahuae and auwoti are held to celebrate clan or village-based rituals, typically those linked to the life-cycle of clan ritual houses (numa) or the collective suane village ritual house. They may sometimes be held for their own sake, as when it is thought that the ancestors are angered that the dance has been neglected. Auwoti is also much in demand these days at state or other non-Nuaulu ceremonial events, in which context it becomes emblematic of Nuaulu ethnicity (Ellen 1988a:129). I collected detailed data on 16 ordinary Nuaulu shields in 1970-71,2 14 of which came from Rohua, and I have every reason to believe that this amounted to all those available in that village at the beginning of my fieldwork period, with the exception of the old and new sacred shields later discussed, and the five ordinary shields cut at that time. Ideally, there should have been one for every adult male in the population, at the time of my 1970 census, approximately 41 8</page><page sequence="5">PLATE 1. Basic features of Nuaulu parry shield: (a) oblique view of rear (note charm attached to top end), (b) rear and (c) front. Field cat. no. 1971-563. 9</page><page sequence="6">individuals (Ellen 1978:224). Integration into male society is, in theory at least, incomplete without the various artefactual accoutrements of manhood, which include a shield; and participation in an auwoti dance is impossible without one. But as is usual in matters pertaining to ritual production, there is always a substantial backlog of objects to make and ceremonies to be held. Ritual cannot - indeed should not - be hurried, even if the failure to undertake it, or to make the required hardware, itself invites every opportunity for ancestral displeasure, with the myriad misfortunes which that may bring. A shield is made from a single piece of sacred Jcawasa wood.3 If a clan does not possess a iawasa tree on its land it may approach another clan which does. If that clan is agreeable, a relation of ritual indebtedness is established which will have to be nullified at some future date with a reciprocal gift or similar request. The specimens for which I have measurements (table 1) varied between 105 and 124 cm in length (m=111.15), between 10 and 13.5 at greatest width (m=11.09), and between 8 and 11 at least width (m=8.94). The thickness at the outer edge is virtually constant at 1 cm, increasing to about 2 cm at the mid-rib. Shields are, therefore, at their widest at each end, narrowing towards the centre. In cross-section they give the impression of a broad-headed arrow. The front of the shield has running lengthwise three slightly raised ridges (muneka), while the back displays a single ridge which merges in the centre with the handle (ai mume). The edge is often faced on all sides with a strip of split rattan attached using wooden pegs and (nowadays) often wire and nails (plate 1). All shields have a correct and incorrect orientation, though this is not indicated by physical form and seldom in its design, where each half - whether drawn horizontally or vertically - is a mirror image of the other. Proper orientation is only visually apparent if there are zoomorphic or anthropomorphic elements in evidence, or when a protective charm has been attached (plate la). This latter is always tied with pineapple thread to the top of the shield, and consists of a small piece of red cloth (karanunu) containing Zingiber root (soiu) and, optionally, a small crest feather from the salmon-crested Cockatoo, Cacatua moluccensis. The front of a shield is inlaid with small pieces of Nautilus shell, broken porce lain or other glazed ware, secured with dammar resin and placed in a distinctive pattern. These are known as Jciiau, or kikau huna (lit. 'moon ornamentation') in the case of Nautilus shell. The whole is painted with mainly abstract motifs, for the most part multilined zig-zags and curves, using oil-based trade pigments. Occasionally, there are recognisable stylised figures, usually of totemic animals appropriate to the clan of the keeper, say a monitor lizard or a cuscus (e.g. specimens 1 and 7 respectively in table 1). Though the subject is not without interest, there is no space here to undertake a detailed analysis of design elements or variation in patterns and colour-schemes, or to discuss whatever significance they might have. It is sufficient to say that there is disagreement as to the lat ter. For some the patterns are merely decorative, without 'meaning', created to impress on the occasion of an auwoti, so that people will remark on its fine 10</page><page sequence="7">Table 1.

Such frustrating remarks are familiar enough in ethnographic studies of art, including those of shield designs from elsewhere (Sillitoe 1980). Others say that individuals 'give their own meaning' to shields, and others still that there are indeed similarities in the elements found on shields from a single clan. But whatever the position with regard to single specimens, designs in general reflect at most variations on a few highly-stylised themes, with limited opportunities for innovation; and in no case are there grounds to suggest that any elements repre sent (stand for) parts of the human body. I make this point here because later it will become evident that sacred shields at least are treated as anthropomorphs. Sacred shields Although all ordinary shields, having been made from kawasa wood, have mys tical properties, and by virtue of their age and history have original reputations (which include being attributed with various magical powers), they are never theless set apart from what I call here 'sacred shields', aniaue monne. These latter are generally deposited in a numa kapitane, the house of a war leader, from where they would in former times have been fetched by head-hunting and raiding parties. They are the focus of powerful forces, unpierceable by arrow or bullet, transmitting their power to righteous users, and attracting stories of glory 11</page><page sequence="8">and wonder. Current sacred shields are old enough to have seen active service during the separatist emergency, but were this not so they would anyway have inherited the reputations of their physical predecessors. But while protective of others, they themselves require protection and periodic ritual attention. It was for this reason that I was never able to photograph a completed shield. Not every clan possesses a sacred shield, and neither did they do so in the past. In Rohua, only two clans - Sonawe-ainakahata and Nepane-tomoien - have them; other clans possessing an inventory of other monne objects. But while not all clans have recognised sacred shields, all must at any one time have at least one shield, sacred or not, which is protected and cared for, if not venerated. The number of shields protected in this way depends on the total number in the possession of a clan at any one time. As Iako Matoke, the 'lord of the land' explained to me, if a clan has four shields, then two must remain in the numa onate, if three then one may be removed but two must remain, if two then one must remain; but if there is only one - even if it is not an aniaue monne in the strict sense - then it must never be permitted to leave the protection of the house. The beliefs underlying such practices seem to stem from an analogy with the reproduction of organic forms. In pragmatic terms, of course, if all shields were to be lost - say in battle - then there would be no model on which to base their replacements. More fundamentally, though, the line of organic continuity would have been severed and reproduction, following the organic analogy, would be quite impossible. In this regard I was asked how the sago palm could reproduce vegetatively if all existing sagopalms were to be destroyed. If they could not be re invented, then neither could shields. In those clans where there is a sacred shield this analogic of vegetative propagation is taken further, and the relationship between a sacred shield and ordinary shields is likened to that between the main rootstock of a mature sagopalm and the numerous suckers which it may throw out in the process of regeneration. Thus, when a sacred shield is replaced, from the same kawasa tree are cut as many ordinary shields as the trunk will comfortably yield. Thus, each sacred shield issues, as it were, so many other shields (its offspring: aniaue anae), as well as regenerating itself. The children themselves cannot reproduce and continue the line; this power is only vested in the aniaue monne. But while the cutting of a sacred shield may provide a highly appropriate occasion on which to cut ordinary shields, this does certainly not preclude cutting the latter at some other time, especially if events - such as an upcoming auwoti - require them. Shields cut at the same time as an aniaue monne are imbued with special qualities which other shields lack, having been cut from the same tree; but it would never be possible for all shields to be derived in this way. However, the most telling comparison, and this seems to be the basal referent, is with the social reproduction of clans, numa and individual personhood; a process materially embodied in physical houses and objects. If that physical link is broken then the clan as a corporate descent group cannot effectively be reproduced either (figure 1). 12</page><page sequence="9">FIGURE 1.

Hatarai remembers that the old Sonawe-ainakahata sacred shield was made in Aihisuru when he was only a small boy, which would put the age of the shield at about 50 years. In the light of other comments, 50 years seems about right for the cycle of replacement for such shields. That for a house is between 20 or 30 years (though timbers from previous constructions may survive), and that for a social clan or nuina as long as it takes biologically to reproduce the individuals and socialise them as effective clanspersons, within the necessary ritual constraints; say as little as 15 or 20 years. In figure 1 I have included an absolute chronology in years so that we may compare the length of cycles of ritual reproduction; though of course it would be quite misleading to suggest that this is a standard which the Nuaulu themselves employ. 13</page><page sequence="10">PLATE 2.

Note hantetane (ritual platform). 14</page><page sequence="11">Replacing the Sonawe-ainakahata sacred shield A few days before the cutting of the new Sonawe-ainakahata sacred shield, a clan meeting of adult males was called in the numa onate to plan the event. There had been much discussion prior to this as to the necessity of replacing the old shield, which had become quite blackened and rotten with age. The matter had become urgent as several illnesses amongst children were being attributed to fail ure to comply with what was now considered to be obvious ancestral impatience. Tapone, the clan onate, clearly thought that it was time to act. This meeting was itself a ritual event, and throughout an uninitiated youth beat a large drum in the suane village ritual house, with which the clan has a special relation of guardianship. On 2 April 1970 a group of seven adult males plus five youths approaching initiation assembled outside the numa onate, and then proceeded in single file to a pre-determined location in secondary forest about 1.3 kilometers outside the village, near the Awao river. They were led by Tapone, and were drawn from most Sonawe households in Rohua, except from among those residing in the numa kapitane. All carried bushknives and wore the prescribed dress for important ritual: barkcloth genital strips covered by decorated batik kilts. In addition, Tapone wore the red shirt of a clan chief, styled his hair and headcloth in the characteristic 'horned' mode demanded by such occasions (plate 4) and carried a special wallet containing betel-chewing requisites and tobacco. Significantly, throughout all this the kapitane (Hatarai) remained in the numa onate, the rules of Nuaulu numa complementarity requiring that provision of the symbolic wherewithal of a war leader come not from the war leader himself, but from his structural counterpart, the onate. On reaching the spot high up on a secondary forested ridge just above the gardens, all except the onate (who merely observes) assisted in clearing the brush from around a kawasa tree previously selected by the clan elders, a young tree with a diameter of about 20 cm, capable of yielding a suitable number of shields in series with a minimum of waste and effort. Though the kawasa itself is sacred, the land surrounding it is not, and adjacent tree cover had already been severely depleted for other mundane purposes and even manioc planted in open patches. Once sufficient space had been cleared, a platform (hantetane) was constructed of logs taken from the larger trees previously felled. On ground which is steeply sloping, this has the considerable advantage of providing a flat and trash-free area on which to work and rest. Two straight sticks with forked ends, the ai rimaia (lit. n. 'branch'), were placed between the logs of the platform, over which would later be placed first a measuring stick and then the sacred shield itself. When the platform had been completed Xerospermum leaves (used as tobacco wrappers) were brought to the platform and the party rested, smoked and chewed betel. Such platforms are obligatory for all ritual held outside the village (such as male initiation ceremonies), and apart from their practical role, symbolically 15</page><page sequence="12">PLATE 3. Trimming-up sacred shield to ensure concavity of the back, while standing on the hantetane, 2 April 1970 (Neg. 70-4-19). 16</page><page sequence="13">separate earth (forest, nature, the mundane) from the sacred practices of culture. In the village, most ceremonies take place inside houses, whose elevation also serves to separate nature (below) from culture (above). It is no co-incidence that hantetane is also the name given to the steps leading up to the clan ritual house, and to the suane (Ellen 1986:16). The hantetane in the forest thus not only differentiates nature from culture vertically (as in ascending the steps into a house), but horizontally by creating, as it were, an island of culture, a proxy house, within a sea of nature. The next stage of the proceedings begins when the onate approaches the tree, touches his forehead and stomach and bows five times. He utters an invocation addressed to the sionata (ancestral spirits) of the land on which the tree is growing, telling them what is about to be done, and to the spirits of the kawasa, imploring them to disperse and not trouble the makers and bearers of the shields. He strikes at the tree several times with a bushknife at chest height, removes a splinter and carries it to the platform. This is the ai mhaine monne, 'sacred breath of the wood', which is then wrapped in red cloth and hung from an upright of the ai rimaia. It is subsequently stored in the numa onate alongside the sacred PLATE 4. Sacred shield resting on supports during break in proceedings, 2 April 1970 (Neg. 70-4-26). Note cloth at right end of shield containing the first splinter. Tapone, the onate Sonawe-ainakahata is sitting on the extreme right of the picture. 17</page><page sequence="14">shield. Failure to do so would bring ill-fortune in hunting and gardening, even death. The felling of the tree is then completed by two other men, and the lower branches lopped off. A measuring stick (katenue) is prepared by the onate of one fathom in length (fingertip to fingertip). With this he measures up one length of the felled tree, sufficient to accommodate the sacred shield, which is then re moved. Lengths for a further five shields were cut away and all trimmed-down to blocks or rough-cuts of an approximately regular shape, reflecting the spinal curve, convex face and handle of the finished shield (plates 2 and 3). All this takes several hours (see table 2) and is interrupted by a meal (plate 5) of baked plan tains, manioc and cocoanut milk cooked in bamboo internodes by the younger men. During this interlude the sacred shield is placed on the ai rimaia (plate 4). When it is agreed that the blocked-out shields are ready they are processed back to the village with the clan chief carrying the sacred shield at the front. As they enter, the sacred shield is admired by the women. In theory, this is the only opportunity they will ever have of seeing it; and it is certainly prohibited for them to come into any physical contact, even with the chippings. It is placed carefully in the numa onate, at its northeastern corner, furthest from the seaward door, and the events of the day conclude with the ceremonial eating of betel. Three days later in the afternoon work began on the detailed fashioning of the sacred shield. This took place inside the numa onate and was undertaken by a group of Sonawe elders assisted by Iako, the onate Matoke. That Iako was present in this way to carve, instruct and act as a second opinion at every move, was triply appropriate; for not only was he 'Lord of the land', first among equals with respect to other clan chiefs, but also Tapone's wife's brother, and an acknowledged expert in the making of shields (see table 1). As on the previous day, Tapone did not participate, observing and advising only. The making of a sacred shield in particular is necessarily a cooperative effort, and it is quite legit imate to draw on the skills of non-clanspersons; so much depending on getting it right while the consequences of failure are awesome. At each turn, guidance, re-assurance and technical expertise is sought. Throughout its manufacture, the new shield (aniaue monne honue) is compared in detail with the old one (aniaue monne monae), of which it must be an exact copy. After the intense activities of 2 and 5 April subsequent work on the sacred shield occurred only intermittently and at a more measured pace up until almost the end of that year. The main crisis was deemed to be over; the new shield was at least in evidence and a degree of relaxation was permissible. The rough-cut was progressively refined, the ridges incised, the handle carved and the whole smoothed with fibrous leaves and sand. On the 15 April I watched as pieces of Nautilus shell (nakatua unue) were chipped into circles and lozenges and then ground with stone and water. These pieces would be used as Jriiau huna (see above), and had been collected years before and stored in readiness in the numa kapitane and numa onate. 18</page><page sequence="15">Table 2.

All that remained was the rite of installation. A special mat of Pandanus leaves (Jcoai) was laid on the floor of the numa onate and the sacred shield carefully taken down from the rafters and placed upon it, face upwards with a cup of cocoanut oil (wikatisie) alongside. The old sa cred shield was laid in the same way to the seaward side of the new one, and slowly iapitane and onate together raised the former and held it over the lat ter. The kapitane made an invocation to the ancestors and the new shield was moved in a clockwise circular fashion over the old shield, five times. Ancestrally blessed cocoanut oil was then first rubbed on the ends of the new shield, then its lateral edges and then its front and back. It was put in the eastward roof space (rine monne: 'sacred shelf) under the spot previously occupied by the old shield, and the old shield stood below, against the north east house post, never destroyed and allowed to disintegrate with dignity. A further invocation was uttered by the Jcapitane and the onate made a complementary gesture of respect to the ancestors. The immediate ritual ended with the chewing of betel, and the entire cycle was formally concluded by the holding of a feast (nasae) in the afternoon. The thing personified Nuaulu attitudes to sacred shields display the concurrence of those four un derlying features which I have previously identified (Ellen 1988c:229) as being typically present when certain objects are described as 'fetishes'. These are an imation, concretisation, conflation of signifier with signified, and an ambiguous tension between person and object in terms of control. The previous section of this paper has provided a bare description with little exegesis, native or otherwise, of the first feature listed above - animation. But even without much explanation it must be clear that at every stage in its manu facture the shield is treated not only as an animate 'thing', but (and this is more significant) as a thoroughgoing anthropomorph. The words used to describe it derive from the lexicon of the human body, the rituals to which it is subject are palpably perceived as homologous to human life-crisis rituals, and it is attributed with 'breath' and individuality. In short, it is personified. I have summarised some of the evidence in the earlier piece referred to, but I shall expand upon it further here. There is, inevitably, some repetition, but also some additional data and re-arrangement: 1. The shield has a proper orientation, the top being referred to as the 'head' and the bottom the 'foot'. It may never be held or placed 'head-down'. And when laying on its 'back' must adopt the setting sun, foot: rising sun, head orientation prescribed for sleeping. The raised strip running along the back is known as the spine (totu unie). 20</page><page sequence="17">2. The head of any shield (sacred or otherwise) is indicated by attaching a charm. These vary from clan to clan, but invariably include ginger and red cloth. In some cases the feathers of totemic birds may be added. The fragments of Nautilus shell or porcelain attached to the front of the shield in fixed patterns are compared to the head-dress (orane) worn by ritual specialists during certain ceremonies. The head-dress too contains Nautilus shell, as well as various kinds of feathers and red cloth. All such additive materials are regarded as being functionally equivalent to human bodily adornment. 3. A sacred shield, during its manufacture or at any point thereafter, is never laid directly on the ground, or even on the floor of a ritual house. At the point in the forest where it is detached from the 'mother tree', it is always placed on a platform (hantetane), and above that on the ai rimaia. Back in the numa onate, it is placed on a special Pandanus mat. Humans too must never sleep directly on the ground, only on raised platforms or in traditional-style elevated houses. 4. As the new shield progresses over the months its genesis is likened to preg nancy (tiai: pregnant). By contrast, the shield it replaces is spoken of as 'being close to death, ... no longer with breath ... or strength, ... too old'. 5. Cocoanut oil (wikatisie) is rubbed over the*tips, edges and finally the whole of a new sacred shield before it is considered complete, a process which may be repeated on occasions when the shield is brought out from its place of rest. In the same way humans are smeared in oil or pig grease in preparation for dances and ceremonies. The oil is said to heal the wounds caused by humans during the gouging and abrasion involved in its fashioning; it is analogous to medicines used for healing people. 6. Nuaulu shields are allocated a soul which passes from one generation to the next through a line of transmission activated in the ritualised replacement of one sacred shield by another. The spirit of the old shield is transferred to the new through a final rite of passage conducted on completion. 7. In many respects the entire ritual cycle reflects the structure of human rites of passage. The construction of the platform (hantetane) away from the village in the forest, the placing of the sacred shield on the hantetane, the procession back into the village, and the admiration from the women as it enters, all parallel closely elements in male initiation ceremonies, sometimes - it seems - almost to the point of parody. 8. The first chip to be cut is wrapped in a red cloth and stored in the ritual house of the onate. Although described as the 'sacred breath of the wood', it is arguably functionally equivalent to the placenta and umbilicus in a human birth, which too must be preserved. It contains part of the soul of the wood, as the placenta contains part of the soul of a new-born child. And as with a new-born child in a menstruation house, it may not be removed from the house until complete. 9. All the chippings created in the carving of a sacred shield are collected in a 21</page><page sequence="18">basket and then taken to a spot in the forest where they are buried. Again, there is here a similarity with human personal leavings subject to ritualisation, such as the hair removed at a first hair cutting ceremony. If the chips or the hair clippings are thrown away sickness will indubitably follow. None of this is particularly distinctive to shield veneration, though with shields it reaches its peak. We can see many of the same attitudes and practices with respect to Nuaulu ritual houses (Ellen 1986) and canoes, where, for example, a first splinter is also meticulously retained whenever a new construction is em barked upon. I have come across no accounts of the making of sacred shields in the compar ative ethnographic literature. Sillitoe (Sillitoe 1980) provides a detailed study of Wola shield making in the New Guinea highlands, but makes no mention of any ritual in their production, nor of any anthropomorphic attributions. How ever, Cranstone (Cranstone 1968:612), following Craig, reports that Telefomin shields bear individual names, have life essence, and other anthropomorphic and supernatural attributes. But for descriptions of comparable rituals of manufac ture in island southeast Asia we have to turn to, it would seem, the rituals of puppet-making on Bali (Hobart 1987:70-71), Toraja smithing (Zerner 1981) or boat construction (Horridge 1986). Things and the representation of things A Nuaulu sacred shield is clearly a concrete 'thing in itself, but it has no exis tence except as an artefact made by humans for a purpose; a product of culture, not of nature. Also, it is, I think, reasonable to assume that its prototypical function in Nuaulu culture was as an instrument of warfare, and that its overall conception was in the first instance technical. But to say as much may be rather academic, since even ordinary shields at the present time have as their primary context of display, ritual rather than warfare. And even if the emphasis were to be reversed, they can hardly be defined as functional objects wrought from nature with no other purpose that to protect or parry. Their shape is not self evidently ergonomic, and the design conveys messages apparently unconnected with the vanquishing of foes. By virtue of their role in warfare, shields acquire individual reputations and are attributed with magical properties. Material pro tection cannot be separated from spiritual protection. In the context of ritual display, they reflect through their decoration upon their owner, and secondly perhaps sometimes upon the clan. In all of these respects, ordinary shields - however undramatically - transcend object and become 'image'. In the case of a sacred shield identification is first and foremost with the prosperity of a particular collectivity - the clan. Like the Sabarl axe described by Battaglia (Battaglia 1983:294), it is a tangible anthropomorphic representation (a created substitute) of clanhood, but at the same time an embodiment of the 22</page><page sequence="19">ancestors themselves. In the Nuaulu case the sacred shield projects clan-ness not through any physical features (sculpturally it is not in any way humanoid), nor hardly through its painted and inlaid designs which, as I have stressed, are only minimally emblematic of the social group. It does so by being - as Battaglia puts it - 'a memorial to reproduction'. As we have seen, the shield undergoes a cycle of reproduction which closely models the ritual reproduction of clans; while the anthropomorphisation of the object underscores its identification with 'real' reproductive biology. The imagery here lies less in the 'thing itself than in the shared experience of it in ceremonial contexts, and most particularly during its rites of creation. It is during these rites that the inner link between shield and clan is at its most stark, when the shield most perfectly condenses clan values. They do so by structuring a dangerous liminal period with echoes of other, human, rites of passage, underlining the dependence of clan reproduction on their successful accomplishment, while their incorrect performance threatens that success. But this is not simply an elaborate metaphor. Sacred shields cannot - any more than other art objects - be reduced to their accompanying coding explanations (Strathern forthcoming: 15); they are a constituent and integral component of the clan, in many ways a more enduring vehicle than the more ephemeral lives of human beings. In them, signified and signifier conflate, metaphorical and literal merge; at one moment standing for themselves, at another interpretable only by reference to further images which - for that moment at least - have taken-for granted meanings (ibid.: 14). The shields are not simply objects, nor symbols which 'stand for' the clan, but the clan itself. In true Durkheimian fashion, by venerating sacred shields, the Nuaulu venerate their own organised sociality. Because a sacred shield is simultaneously part of the material collectivity of shields - of which it is the prime exemplar, and part of the totality of spiri tual forces associated with the clan, it well illustrates that ambiguous concept of power of which I have also spoken as being distinctive of a 'fetish'. On the one hand it has extraordinary power to protect; on the other it is vulnerable, and must be generally cossetted and guarded from ill-health (through, for example, the use of charms). Failure to do so may unleash malign ancestral forces and result in unpredictable events. Unlike most other spiritual forces, humans play a significant role in its manufacture and maintenance, and its power must there fore be seen as being at least partially subject to manipulation. With the tacit support of the ancestors, it can be made to do things for the living. In all this it becomes clear that the rites of their reproduction are central to any under standing of the cultural significance of Nuaulu sacred shields; that the context of their production is an important part of their meaning. To put it in familiar structuralist terms, and following Marilyn Strathern (ibid.:13), the key lies in the conjunction between the diachronic sequence of events which accompany its life-cycle and the synchronic contexts of association and use at any one moment; in other words in the connection between event and artifact. 23</page><page sequence="20">Notes 1. The fieldwork upon which this account is based was conducted for 18 months between December 1969 and May 1971. Though there have been, to date, four subsequent re visits, on none of these occasions did I again witness events similar to those described, and I have made no further enquiries on the subject. That original fieldwork was sponsored by Lembaga Ilmu Pengetahuan Indonesia (the Indonesian Academy of Sciences), and financially supported by a British Social Science Research Council Studentship, the London-Cornell Project for East and Southeast Asian Studies, the Central Research Fund of the University of London, and the Galton Foundation. I should also like to thank the Royai Anthropological Institute for permission to reproduce some text previously published in Ellen 1988c, and Marilyn St rat hern for allowing me access to an unpublished manuscript. 2. One of these (2) is illustrated here in plate 1 and is presently in the collection of the author (Ellen field cat. no. 1971-563); and a second (3) is deposited in the Museum of Mankind (BM As. 1.173). A third specimen (Ellen field cat. no. 1971-313) is in the Rijksmuseum voor Volkenkunde in Leiden, which because it was made in the non-Nuaulu village of Yalahatan is not listed in table 1. In most respects, Nuaulu shields conform to a type found widely on Seram, and reasonably well-represented in ethnographic collections (see e.g. Juynboll 1931:11-13; Martin 1894:table xxvii). 3. kawasa = n. 'right, proper'. Nuaulu recognise two types: Icawasa hanaie, lit. 'male Icawasa', with a reddish bark, that usually used for shields; and Icawasa pina, lit. 'female kawasa'. In addition to shields, Icawasa is also used for the carved repository (sokate enu: enu = 'turtle') of the totemic spirits of the clan Nepane-tomoien, for sacred spear shafts, and for the outrigger canoe of the head of the clan Somori - the only person who is permitted to use the wood for this purpose. Plant voucher specimens were variously identified as Albizzia falcata (L) Backer and Pithecollo bium clypearia Benth. These are closely-related trees in the Mimosaceae sub-family of the Leguminosae, and both are known in Ambonese Malay as 'kayu salawaku': shield wood. It was perhaps understandable, therefore, that Rumphius (De Wit 1959:344, 398, 424) should (translating the Malay) describe both by the binomial Arbor clypeorum (HA 3:192); 'clypeus' being Latin for shield. Elsewhere he appears to classify them together as Clypearia rubra (Herbarium Amboinense 3:176-77, tab. 112), though in one place distinguishes Albizzia retusa Benth. as Clypearia alba (HA 3:176, tab. 111). The most likely determinations are Albizzia falcata for kawasa hanaie (small round leaves), and Pithecollobium clypearia for Icawasa pina (larger long leaves). Curiously, while Rumphius (Van Slooten 1959:312) notes that Albizzia is used for shields on account of it being difficult to break or pierce, a more recent authority (Corner 1952:410) describes the wood as 'soft'.
