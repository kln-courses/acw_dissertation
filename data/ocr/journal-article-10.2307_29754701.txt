<plain_text><page sequence="1">Some Terracotta and Wood Votives of the V?rlis The V?rlis are an aboriginal tribe found all over the Western hills. They are found in large numbers in the Thana district and Dharampur and Bansda talukas (sub-dis? tricts) of the Surat district. They are also reported from Nasik and West Khandesh. Sporadic settlements are found in the Dang forests and Baroda district. (See fig. 1). They number about 285,472 with 144,255 males and 141,217 females (Indian Cen? sus 1941). The term V?rli according to Wilson (1878) comes from cVaraP a patch of cultivat? ed land, and means an uplander. Rajwade (1924) derives the word from cFar??p, a non-Aryan tribe referred to by K?ty?yana, a Sanskrit grammarian of the 2nd cent. B.C. The V?rlis themselves have only a vague notion of their origin from Konkan on the southwestern coast of India. Their ritual songs and mythology trace their origin from birds and plants with only a vague reference to their original homeland. The V?rli society is divided into four endogamous divisions, and a number of exo gamous clans (Kuls). They allow polygamy, but polyandry is unknown. Infant and adult marriage are equally common. The V?rlis of the Thana district are agriculturists, living in large settled villages. They own farms, large enough to support the growing family needs; and the city of Bombay has considerably influenced and changed their primitive life. The V?rlis of Dharampur and Bansda sub-divisions, on the other hand, lead a comparatively hard life. The hills and forests restrict the size of their fields, which are nothing more than small ter? races, where danger (Oryza sativa - Linn) and nagli (Ellusive coracana - Gaertn) are cultivated. Their primitive method of slash and burn cultivation leaves very little sur? plus for summer months, and thus they turn to food gathering and hunting. Some fa? milies wander considerable distances in search of cheap factory labour. This dependence on a primitive economy has kept them away from the surrounding Hindu Society. They are practically untouched by orthodox Brahmanism and preserve a primitive religion which revolves around a host of spirits, ghosts, tribal and village gods and goddesses. Their religion is chiefly spirit worship. Every place is under the care of a spirit, and every tree and stone is sacred. Most spirits are evil and unfriendly, but some are indifferent. They are much given to charms and magic and try to cure all social evils 69</page><page sequence="2">with magical rites. Illness is supposed to be the work of unfriendly spirits or tribal gods, and the usual cure is the sacrifice of a goat or a fowl. They have no religious canons and guides except mediums (bhagat) who are witch doctors, augurs and oracles at the same time. They have no idea of a supreme being or a creator, and all gods have an equal place. Tribal, clan and forest gods are also worshipped. Goddesses are also popular, and most family gods have a female counterpart. Some plants and trees are worshipped of which pipal (Ficus religiosa - Linn), Umber (Ficus racemosa - Linn), tulas (Ocimum sanctum - Linn) and bei (AEgle marmelos Corr.) are the most common. The worship of these plants probably has a totemic origin, for some families tabu their eating. Bharamdev, a tribal leader's spirit, a cattle god, a tribal hunter and a war god at the same time, receives over and above the usual food and blood offerings votive terra cotta animals and a shrine or a soul house. This offering is prevelant chiefly among the Dharampur sub-division O V?rlis. Bharamdev is a powerful tribal deity and if not properly propitiated causes un? told evil as well as a serious mental disorder (bharam). He lives near the roots of a Savar (Salmalia malabarica Schot and Endl.) tree on the village boundary. Any stone daubed with red lead represents the deity, but it is believed that until the god gets a terracotta shrine (ghumat) he has to lead an uncomfortable life, and thus may bring evil to the village. Bell-shaped terracotta soul houses are dedicated to give Bharamdev a place of rest. These shrines usually shelter the red lead daubed stones, representing the god. The soul houses are made by any village potter by hand on a wooden mould and are fired well in an open pit. The iron contents of the soil are responsible for the bright brick red colour. The base is round and about 3 cm. thick. The shrine rises up in a ball shaped dome with a large opening of about 10 cm. to 15 cm. diameter. The second bell pots is plastered on before firing, and resembles a buddhist funerary st?pa of the 1st and 2nd centuries A.D. The upper bell pot is usually wheel-made, but has a very rough finish. The shrines are decorated with two horizontal levels of stitches along the wall, about 13 cms apart. The lower level of stitches is about 2 cm away from the base. Between the two rows is a rectangular door, about 10 cm. x 5 cm. through which food and flower offerings are made. A small cup near the door holds an occasional lamp, dedicated by villagers on auspicious days. The lower dome is usually decorated with a vertical and semicircular stitch pattern. (l) Dharampur sub-division (taluk?) is included in Surat district (South) and has an area of 574.6 Sq. miles. The town of Dharampur is in the heart of the sub-division and lies 20?, 31' North latitude and 73?, 15' east ? longitude. 70</page><page sequence="3">Circles on the wall of the dome represent the sun and the moon-symbols of permanence. A lotus petal-like design surrounds the lower in addition to the stich pattern, votive cattle or horses plastered on separately. (Plate 1(a). The central Bharamdev cult is always accompanied by another minor cult of the spirit (Ran bhut), the former's companion and servant. A number of minor spirits, represented by stones coated with red lead and covered with wheel-made pots accom? pany the two deities (Plate 1(b). The minor shrines are marked with white or red flags tied on to tall bamboo posts. (Plate Ha). Old discarded shrines are either thrown into a river or piled up under a tree, where sometimes a secondary Bharamdev cult starts. Kosambi (1962) reports the use of similar soul houses in Maharashtra. He descri? bes two such cults, on the route of Pandharpur annual pilgrimage, one at the village of Bar?d dedicated to Mhasob? (Fig. II) and the other at Khand?li (Village) for Vait?l, both popular death gods. At times such soul houses are made for fertility or death god? desses. These shrines also have the usual stitch pattern on the wall. As no house or hut of this type is known anywhere in Maharashtra and Gujarat, Kosambi (1962) con? cludes that it indicates a cmoveable wigwam structure of some sort, rather solidly con? structed', a probable relic of a nomadic society. Bharamdev is also a fertility cum cattle god, and in many villages of Dharampur and Bansda sub-divisions, votive clay horses are offered ? sometimes as supplements to cattle and sometimes as substitutes for them. The horse is the main offering and has a special significance if offered on auspicious days or when family vows are fulfilled. Cattle figures are dedicated if the village is seriously attacked by a cattle disease. These votives are probably substitutes for similar sacrificial animals. The genitals are usually exaggerated, probably as fertility symbols. (See figures V and VI). These terracottas are made by the village potter as a religious duty, and are shaped by hand and fired in an open pit. Ferruginous contents of the soil give the figures a bright brick-red colour. The votives are 35 cm. to 40 cm. high. The hourse terracottas are well decorated with the saddle, reins and stitch pattern, all around the body. Small, undecorated and simple horse or cattle votives are also offered in addition to the large ones. Most of these represent sick animals, supposed to be cured by the deity and are usually unfired or half-baked and about 4 cm. tall. One Bharamedev cult may get more than 200 such figures within a year. (See plates 1(b) and 11(b), cA5 - 1 and 2). The large usually face away from the shrine, while the small ones normally face the god. (See plate Ha). These receive an occasional worship and are either daubed with red lead as a blood substitute or lime as a purificatory rite. Old shrines and votives are renewed every year on the fourteenth dark night of the 71</page><page sequence="4">Indian Calender month of '?s?' or 'Asvin' (October-November) a day before the po? pular harvest cum lamp (div?li) festival. Fresh cults are also established on this day. The tribal medium or witch doctor (bhagat) performs the renewal or establishment ceremony. The rite starts late in the evenng with a ritual drink of either rice (Oryza sativa - Linn) beer or mhowa (Madhuka indica - Gmet) spirits. The medium dances until he is possessed by the spirit of Bharamdev. At this he offers either a fowl or a goat and a clay horse. Blood sacrifice pleases the spirit, which immediately leaves the medium and enters the clay shrine, where it lives peacefully for a year, if regularly worshipped with food offerings. A feast at the headman's house ends the ceremony. Family and clan ancestors also receive a votive offering every year on the 14th dark night of ?s? (October-November). Some families make this offering every five years, the maximum limit allowed. A wooden anthropomorphic post (goval) (See Plate II (b) B) about 27 cm. long is burried near the ancestral grave. The post has no other details except the head sepa? rated by two notchs. The head is about 7 cm. long. The mouth and nose are carved and coloured either with lime or red lead. The heart is marked with a cross, across the upper part of the body. The head is daubed with red lead before the ritual burial. This rite is probably a survival of a forgotten human sacrifice to the ancestral spirits. Any neglect in the renewal of the post may mean total destruction of the family, clan or even the entire village. Though a fertility deity, females must keep away from the cult side. This probably is an example of inverted tabu, enforced by a usurped patriarchal priesthood. V. N. Sisodia and K. C. Malhotra BIBLIOGRAPHY Enthoven R. E. - Tribes and Castes of Bombay. (3 Vols).
