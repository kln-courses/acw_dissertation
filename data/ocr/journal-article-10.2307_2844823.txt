Hardcover: Price ?67.90. ISBN 0-691- 08356-8. In 1982, the Florence Center for the History and Philosophy of Science sponsored the Darwin Centenary Conference. Although it is not explicitly stated, the collection of papers published in the present volume under the title of The Darwinian heritage presumably stemmed from that occasion. To judge by the publication alone, it must have been an impressive event. The Darwinian heritage is truly a monumental achievement on the part of the contributors, the editors, and not the least the publishers, Prin- ceton University Press. The volume contains thirty-one papers written by an international community of scholars and in spite of its high price, the inevitable result of the length of the book and fine production, it will become an indispensable work of reference for the special- ists and the historians interested in the develop- ment of scientific ideas and theories. The volume is divided into four parts. Part I examines the evolution of Darwin's theoretical framework and methods from the time of the Beagle voyage (1831-36) to the full maturation of his ideas as presented in On the origin of species by means of natural selection (1859) and The descent of man, and selection in relation to sex (1871). Among the fourteen papers presented in this section there are some that deal with the technical aspects of Darwin's scientific contributions, but in general the emphasis is squarely laid on tracing out the context of his work and the contemporary recep- tion of Darwin's theories. The paper by Malcolm Jay Kottler, in particular, outlines the long debate between Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace over natural selection. In Part II the Victorian social scene and its intellectual nuances are examined in so far as these influenced Darwin and were influenced in turn. Robert M. Young concludes the section with a highly interesting discussion of 'social Darwi- nism' and the sinister linkage between evolu- tionary biology and the rise of virulent European racism in the twentieth century. Part III looks at the comparative reception of Darwinism in Bri- tain, America, Germany, France, Italy and Russia, while Part IV concludes the volume with seven papers on the historical assessment of Darwin and Darwinism. For the non-specialist reader, The Darwinian heritage leaves three unforgettable impressions. It may not be appreciated by the general public how intense is the interest aroused by Darwin as a man and as a scientific thinker among a very sizeable community of academic writers. The bibliography on Darwin and the scientific topics studied by Darwin (compiled by M. J. Kottler and appended at the end of the volume) is not numbered but it runs to no less than 76 pages. However, the editor of the volume, David Kohn, points out in his 'Introduction' that the interest displayed by historians and philosophers in Darwin as a major thinker of his time is fairly recent. When the centenary of the publication of the Origin of species was celebrated in 1959, it was primarily an affair organized by scientists interested in evolutionary biology. The event held in 1982 was entirely different in its qualita- tive appreciation, but it would not have been possible, Kohn thinks, to have organized a simi- lar exercise 23 years ago, as the wider historical studies simply did not exist at the time. The work also drives home the point time and again that Darwin was a controversial thinker and writer, who worked best against a constant foil of criti- cism, although his scientific conclusions were carefully supported by empirical evidence. Dar- win of course had his own inner circle of suppor- ters, among whom was Joseph Hooker, the great Victorian botanist and plant-collector. When Hooker applied for the post of the naturalist aboard H.M.S. Erebus (1839), he was told by Captain Ross that only a person as Mr Darwin would be acceptable for the appointment. Hooker knew Darwin's background and work sufficiently to have replied. 'What was Mr Dar- win before he went out?' (Sulloway, p. 121). The third aspect of the papers presented in the volume concerns the position occupied by Dar- win in the history of European science and thought. There is no question that Darwin was a 'revolutionary' thinker who tried to cut through</page><page sequence="2">Book reviews 593 the invisible chains with which scientists in every age and time bind and restrict their mental vision and he chose biology and zoology as his prefer- red fields of study. In this sense, Darwin was the last of a long list of significant thinkers beginning with Gallileo, Descartes and Newton, a line of inquiry and methodology that was to find in the social sciences exponents such as Adam Smith, T. R. Malthus, David Ricardo and Leon Walras. As Silvan S. Schweber points out (p. 58), Dar- win possessed an uncanny ability to raise the right questions and his powers of observation were such that the answers derived from empiri- cal findings could in turn be transferred to ano- ther set of theoretical problems. Nevertheless, in the context of the probability-orientated approach of our own times, Darwin represented the past rather than the future. Although Dar- win's present-day followers may disagree, the impression remains with this reviewer that Dar- win did not belong to the world of Karl Marx or George Cantor, his two near contemporaries, who were to transform completely future intellectual thought in politics, social organiza- tion, and mathematics. Cantor's mathematical discoveries in particular opened the way to the indeterminate methodology at twentieth cen- tury science, which is still bedevilled by the con- cept of infinity. What Darwin would have made of Kurt Goedel's incomplete theorem is hard to say but we know for certain that the question posed by Darwin of the evolution from 'Monad to Man' cannot be answered if one accepts Goedel's famous paradox. The 'intelligence' which characterizes life-forms and inanimate objects is one that lies beyond the comprehen- sion of anthropomorphic reasoning. K. N.
