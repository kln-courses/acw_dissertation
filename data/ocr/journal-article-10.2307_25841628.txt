Remarks on Inscriptions of Bonampak and Neighboring Sites in Chiapas, Mexico by Dieter Dutting The old thesis of the peacefulness of the classic Maya was shaken when in 1946 Giles Healey discovered the famous frescoes of Bonampak, Structure 1. In Room 2 a surprise raid on an unarmed enemy is vividly displayed together with the "judge ment" of the captives by the leader of the attackers, standing in the midst of his fel low noblemen. There might have been hostile invasions into the Usumacinta valley during the late-classic period. Particularly some of the "bat" glyphs found in the inscriptions of Bonampak, Yaxchilan, Piedras Negras and other sites could refer to invaders. The present paper asks the question about the ethnic identity of these "bats". My Fig. 1 Bonampak Stela 2 (photogr. by the author)</page><page sequence="2">Dieter Diitting hypothesis is that the "bats" mentioned in the earlier inscriptions of Yaxchilan and Piedras Negras, those characterized by the glyph 756a: 25.4, are vagrant foreigners or fugitives without a permanent residence, wheras the' 'bats'' referred to in the later inscriptions of Bonampak could be Tzotziles from the highlands of Chiapas. The contexts in which "bat" graphemes occur exceed the purely historical level and are loaden with features (human sacrifice by beheading, connection with food-plants, etc.) derived from mythical bat demons (cf. Barthel 1966; Thompson 1966). This intermingling of historical and mythical features heavily burdens the at tempts towards a deeper understanding. I start the discussion by considering two inscriptions of Bonampak1). (a) Bonampak Stela 2 (Fig. 1). Iconographically this stela presents a richly adorned lord flanked by two ladies, one facing him, the other behind him. The lord may be Lord Muan whose inaugura tion is recorded by the first glyphs of the main text. Both ladies hold bowls filled with stripes of bark paper, on which blood spent in self-castigation is collected (compare Yaxchilan Lintels 17 and 24). The lady in front holds in addition the thorn used for piercing parts of the body. I regard her as the lord's mother disguised as Great Goddess. She seems to be referred to by glyphs E6-E8 of the main text. The lady standing behind the lord, a "queen of Yaxchilan" (Dll, Ell), is probably his wife.

The main text conveys information on at least two levels, a primary one, which is historical in nature, and an implied supernatural one. Only the historical dimension was considered in the preliminary translation given above. In the following comment I shall point out the super natural level whenever possible. A1,B1 The glyph of the day 6 Muluc, VI.513, conveys the message uac.tzic, "emerging of the honorable one" (on the throne?), and, if one interprets T 513, formally a "jade disk", as symbol of water, as "emerging of the water". Cl Note Yucatec: hokol = salir; hok-z-ah = sacar afuera, manifestar, publicar. C2 With respect to T 188 = Je note Quiche: le - generation, rank age-group, order; leel = series of generations. Cakchiquel: lei = hilera, fila, serie; siglo, na ci6n, comunidad, tribu. Dl The name glyph of Lord Muan means literally: "he (126 = ah) the owner/ruler (168b) of the cloudy (748 = moan) sky (561 = caan)". This name could indicate that its bearer is a lord from the cloudy mountains of Chiapas, the homeland of the Tzotziles. It could indicate furthermore that the lord may have been regarded as earthly representative of the rain god. Note Yucatec: moankin = dia nublado y Uoviznoso. D2 Affix 12, interpreted by me as xol/xul, and the glyph 1.573:12, which intro duces distance numbers, are discussed in section n. Fig. 2 b Bonampak Stela 2, text above lady standing behind the lord (photogr. by the author)</page><page sequence="5">?Bats" in the Usumacinta-Valley D4,E4 The day 12 Etz'nab recalls the "blood-sacrifice" referred to by the icono graphy of the stela. The etz'nab grapheme 527 conveys the idea "flintknif e". The Long Count position of this date and of the initial date (Al/Bl) (Thompson 1955:36) is supported by the text on Bonampak Stela 3. There Lord Muan is ad dressed by the glyphs (Fig. 3): A1-B2 5Ahau3 Muan (9.17.15.0.0)/..../..../ A3 1.710:droplets, "his sprinkling water [for cleansing]", or "his casting lots [for divination]" / .... A5,B5 126.168a:561:23 - 748:116, Lord Muan, lit, "he (126 = ah) the lord (168a) there on high (561:23) - [on a] cloudy (748 = moan) day (116 = kin)" I A6 168a:197.512a?, "lord (168a) of Bonampak (197.512a?)" / B6 168a:756a?..., "lord (168a) of the bats/ (Tzotziles?)". D5 The glyph 60a:602.181 introduces the birth clause E5?D6, and seems to refer to the prospective blood-sacrifice indicated by the iconography of the stela. Previously I interpreted graphemes 586/602 as mac, "bury, hide" (Dutting 1972/74/76). Using this reading one could think at a translation "burying (602.181 = muc-ic) the [umbilical] cord (60a)", but the value tab, assigned by Thompson, Barthel and myself to T 60a, is not a Maya word for the "umbilical cord". Tab rather refers to the cord used in perforating the tongue and penis in self-castigation. T 98 is most likely the grapheme for the "umbilical cord". The translation of D5 given above makes use of Yucatec mucut, muctah, aguardar, Fig. 3 Bonampak Stela 3, glyphic text (photogr. by the author)</page><page sequence="6">6 Dieter Dutting esperar. In the Quiche of the Popol Vuh muc is a common term for "to see" (par ticularly the hidden things), in addition to having the meaning "bury, hide". A reading 602 = muc, "to see" could also be of interest in the present context2. As alternative I have considered a reading kul/kol(?) of graphemes 586 and 602. Kul means "divine, adorable" in Yucatec, "to receive, accept, consent, expect; find, meet, join, marry", and also "garment, cloth, cover, shelter" in the Quichean languages (roots k'ul and q'ul; cf. Dutting 1978a). On the basis of this Quichean k'ul one could interpret the glyph D5 as "consenting to/expecting (602.181 = kul-ic) the [punishment with the] cord (60a)". In Yucatec kol means among other things "to wound", and one could think at "wounding (602.181 = kol-ic) with the cord (69a)". E5 I suppose the date 12 Etz'nab 1 Ceh commemorates Lord Muan's own birth, perhaps being its 1 Katun anniversary. With respect to Barthel's T 607a = zih note Yucatec: zihil = nacer, nacimiento; zihaan = cosa nacida. Kekchi: sihac = originar, brotar; sihanc = originarse. D6 The glyph 187:743 can be regarded as an indicator for a theme of birth. I have considered a reading taz, "[celestial] layer", of T 187, butprefer now a reading pazel, "shelter". Barthel's choice is tz'ul[bal], "arbor". The latter ter mini refer in Yucatec to "ceremonial huts" and are intimately associated with lineage cults ' refer to chapt. 1 of the Book of Chilam Balam of Chumayel (Roys 1933:63) which starts: "...the first man of the Cartul family. The white guaje, the ixculun [and] the gumbo-limbo are his little hut (yixmehen pazel),... The logwood tree is the hut of Yaxum (quetzal) (ek u pazel yaxum), the first of the men of the Cauich family (u chun u uinicil Cauiche)." Of interest is also a passage in chapt. 4 of the Ritual of the Bacabs (Roys 1965:11): "Unique 4 Ahau is the day for the creation of the great fierce one. High is the door of his green arbor (can u hoi u yax tz'ulbal), where the origin of the lust of birth, the lust of creation took place (uch cu sihil u cool al u cool ch'ab)." I regard the glyph 187:743, pazel.ac or tz'ul[bal].ac, as metaphor for a "place of birth". In Maya thought the turtle was evidently linked with the young moon goddess, the patroness of the 17th month Kayab, who seems to be identical with the Mexi can "goddess on the tortoise seat", Mayauel or Ayopechtli. These deities were goddesses of childbirth. As revealed by Mayauel's picture in Codex Laud 9, the turtle was regarded as symbol of "female fertility" (cf. Dutting 1976:83). E6-E8 The probable reference to the "place of birth", 187:743, is followed on Stela 2 by glyphs addressing Lord Muan's mother disguised as Great Goddess, the patroness of childbirth. For a detailled discussion of this goddess see Dutting (1976). It is not entirely certain that T 1004 is the head variant of 630-181 (tzen.iq, "bearing sustenance", tzen-t-ic, "sustaining"; Dutting 1972). One could also think at another expression having this meaning. Evidence for regarding the lady in front of Lord Muan as his mother is given by the "twisted cord" ornament in her huipil which reminds at grapheme 98, the sign for the "umbilical cord". Tlaloc masks decorate the huipil of Lord Muan's wife. Fl This glyph might refer to the "birth of a bat" (Yucatec ahal, Kekchi ajc, "despertar"), but could also denote "he (126 = ah) the offspring (23 = [y]al) of the bats/ (Tzotziles)". Probably Lord Muan's own birth is meant. By making use of the Quichean termzutz', "cloud", a near homophonic term to zotz', "bat", one could interpret this glyph also as "birth of the clouds", a necessary prerequisite to the start of the rainy season. G2,F3 These glyphs may address Lord Muan as "captor" (G2) of a person named Ak-Ho-Tzek (F3). This capture is depicted on Bonampak Lintel 1 as re vealed by the accompanying glyphs. The linguistic base of Proskouriakoff's "captor" interpretation of the glyphs 1.764:106 or 1.108:764 is unclear. Primarily I understand T 764, formally a "snake's head", as chan or can, "snake" 2 The identification of the knot superfix as "single-band knot" 60a is not entirely certain.</page><page sequence="7">?Bats" in the Usumacinta-Valley (Cholan languages and Yucatec/Quiche, resp.). A "captor interpretation of T 764 could be based eventually on Cakchiquel: qan = cazar; qana = cautivo, esclavo de guerra; qanoi/qanonel = el cazador. Pocomchi (Zuniga): caneh = captivar en guerra, cazar animales. Kekchi: canoe = lazar. Alternatively one could understand the glyphs 1.764:106 and 1.108:764 as reference to a war-like "snake goddess", corresponding to the Aztec Tlazolteotl, who in turn symbolizes the "cantor". The following glyph may then refer to her "captive", or indicate a quality/activity of this goddess. Affixes 106 and 108 are emblems of women/goddesses in Maya art (Dutting 1976; Barthel 1977). G4 The name glyph 229.58:742 creates several problems. This glyph could address Lord Muan's father. On Bonampak Stela 1 (LI) this name is written 12.58:742. One could conclude that T 229 and T 12 correspond to the same phonetic value and are an integral part of this name. But since both affixes precede also other names it is more likely that they stand outside of the actual name or title, which in the present case is 58:742, interpreted by Thompson (1962:323) as zac-xicin, "ocelot" (this identification must be regarded as very tentative; I adopt it in lack of a better reading). Knorozov's reading T 12 = ah seems to be accepted by several American scho lars. Those who recognize the T 12/229 exchange extend the ah reading to T 229. My main argument against T 12/229 = ah is the following: The marker ah func tions not only as male prefix and agentive, but also as syntactical suffix in various Maya languages (for instance as past tense marker of transitive verbs in Yucatec). If T 12 and T 229 would correspond to the value ah, these affixes should occur not only as prefixes of nominal glyphs but also as suffixes of various graphemes representing verbs. This is not the case. The occurrence of T 12 and T 229 in suffix and postfix position is restricted to a few graphemes. On the con trary, affixes T 125/126, Barthel's ah, are widely used both as prefixes and suf fixes (postfixes). I interpret T 229 as ak, "new, fresh" (Dutting 1972), and assume for T 12 a com plementary meaning xul, "end, death", a reading which I extend to xol, "staff". A detailled discussion of graphemes T 12 and T 229 is given in section n. F5 This glyph could denote also "the death (12 = xui?) of the true/noble one or of the vulture (747 = kuch) comes forth (178 = el)"; note Yucatec: kuch = zopi lote; kuch/koch = cosa verdadera. This glyph could refer to Zac-Xicin. The reading T 178 = el, "emerge", originally proposed by Knorozov and widely used by Barthel and myself, is confirmed by the Kin variant 59.III:(VI-VI) :565a, which onNaranjo Stela 29 (F18) replaces the usual Kin glyph number. 178:565a. Note Yucatec: uacal = salir una cosa de otra (VI = uac). G5,F6 Glyph G5 addresses either Lord Muan or Zac-Xicin as "lord of the bats". The ethnic identity of these "bats" is open to question. They might have been Tzotziles who descended into the Usumacinta basin and gained control of sites like Bonampak. Adams and Aldrich (pers. comm.) transcribe glyph F6 as 36.168:765:130 and interpret it as "emblem" of Bonampak. I agree with the iden tification of F6 as Bonampak emblem, an idea put forward also by Mathews (1978), but prefer to transcribe the main element as 197.512aP; that means it con sists of a "bone" (197) attached to the head variant of 512a, chuc, "to seize, cap ture". Note Yucatec: baac = hueso; baczahil = captiverio; baczah.tah = captivar o rendir en guerra; chuc, ah = asir, prender, echar mano. H1,I1 Lord Muan's wife is termed Ix Yax Tul, which could mean "she the first rabbit", or "she the first one who follows the track". Since T 759 not only stands for t'ul, "conejo; seguir el rastro", butprobably also for t'ol, "poner en fila, en or den" (Yucatec), her name could also denote "she the first one of the lineage/or der", or "she who starts the lineage/order". This latter interpretation nicely fits together with the message of the following god K glyph. H2,I2 I interpret T 124 as kah[lay], "record, memory, history". H3,I3 This glyph designates Lord Muan's wife as lady from the royal house of Yaxchilan.</page><page sequence="8">8 Dieter Diitting (b) Bonampak Stela 1. A richly dressed Maya lord dominates also the iconography of Bonampak Stela 1. In the glyph blocks on his left side, which are partly destroyed, the final glyph 748.116 could indicate that he is the above mentioned Lord Muan. He holds a cere monial staff which is decorated wiht three pairs of knotted bands (T 60a, tab), inter cepted by diamond forms, and an elaborate serpent mask at the base. A remarkable shield, decorated with the mask of god K (T 1030o?)f is tied to his other arm. The forehead of this god K is covered with a T 23 (ai/yai)-sign above of which graphems T 150 (perz') and 145b? (tzatz) form a kind of headdress. The head is surrounded by two bands which together are the elements of T 614, tz'aml, "throne". Together th ese glyphic elements could denote "strong (tzatz) usurper (petz') on the throne (tz'am)". The head itself, 1030o[23]?, might denote nim-al, "the great one"3. The glyph band on which the lord stands (Fig. 4) is discussed below. Beneath this band a huge mask of the earth-monster (Itzam Cab) , decorated with T 528 (haab, rain)-symbols andT 511 (roh)-disks (also symbols for precious water), is carved. This monster could also be a version of the Cauac monster of the underworld, discussed in Diitting (1978b). The elaborate ear ornaments of the monster head are of the type 86:585a[165]:534v with heads of the young maize god emerging from the foliage of T 86. These ear ornaments probably convey the message: "origin/source (86 = wi'?) of the covering (585a = pix) and adorning (165 = wig?) with precious/beloved things (534 = coh/coohl)"4. T 534, the "inverted ahau" grapheme, is shaped here like a "tooth". The same is found in other iconographic designs. The context in which T 534- teeth occur reve als that they have been regarded as "something precious". The stucco reliefs on the Piers of Palace House D, Palenque, for instance, are enframed by glyphic elements which convey the idea "preciousness". The frame of pier f consists of alternating T 511 (roh)-disks and T 534-teeth. It is conceivable that these T 534-teeth represent "grains of maize". "Grains of maize" and "teeth" are termed co in Yucatec, coh in Itza and Lacandon. Furthermore we find in Yucatec coh/cooh = "precious, beloved, valuable, esteemed" (co'o) in Itza, cho/choh in the Cholan languages). In the Lacan don story of the "creation of the true men (hach winik)", the Lacandones, by Hachakyum (Bruce 1974:112) we read: "Los varones fueron creados por Hachakyum. Los hizo con barro (k'at). Nuestros ojos son de barro cocido. Nuestros dientes no son de barro ('ah koh-eex ma' k'at), sino de granos de maiz (... 'u koh rial)." In most other Maya languages the term for "tooth" is e. This term is related phonetically to el, the probable value of affixes T 178 and T 140. Main sign 534 seems to be only a variant of affix 178, el, "emerge, come forth, leave" (Quich?an and Mamean languages), but in contrast to T 178 and T 140 it can never denote elel, "burn" (Yucatec). I postulate now a primary value el, "emerge", of T 534; in addi tion I assign a secondary value coh/cooh to this grapheme. The shift from the general Maya term e, "tooth", to Yucatec co(h) may have triggered the arising of such a sec ondary value coh of T 534 (cf. Diitting 1978a). Previously I interpreted T 534 as lok, which means "beloved, esteemed; buy, purchase" in the Quichean, "emerge" in the Cholan languages (Diitting 1976:83). I follow now Barthel in attributing the value lok/luk to graphemes T 565a, c, read by me previously as cool. The expressions cool and Juk- are comparable semantically, both convey in Yucatec the meaning' 'release, liberate, save''. This was the meaning originally attributed by me to graphemes 565a, c (Diitting 1974:17). My main reason for rejecting now the old reading 565a, c = cool/col is the severe interference of this assignment with Barthel's T 251 = col/chol, which must be regarded as correct (cf. Diitting 1978a). 3 All these readings, besides T 145b = tzatzl (Dutting 1978a), are due to Barthel. 4 The superfix 86 is modified by droplets surrounding the spiral-element, comparable to T 579 in relation to T 578.1 do not think that this implies a change in meaning.</page><page sequence="9">?Bats" in the Usumacinta-Valley 9 The text beneath the standing Lord Muan(?) on Bonampak Stela 1 (I-O) is partly a repetition of certain passages of the Stela 2 - inscription. It starts by referring to the Great Goddess, then switches to lord Zac-Xicin(?) and closes with the Bonampak emblem glyph and the "bat" title, perhaps a reference to the Tzotziles. According to Mathews (ms. 1978) the largely destroyed upper part of Stela 1 probably recorded the IS 9.17.10.0.0 12 Ahau 8 Pax.

Likewise the glyph II can refer to Lord Muan's mother, mentioned by the following two glyphs, or can address a male partner of her. One could also translate "the one who sets in order (126-670) those who emerge (534 = el)", but I prefer the reading given above. In the Popol Vuh the names of impor tant lords are frequently preceded by the title qo. Edmonson (1971:210) writes on this tide: "Qo is an honorific prefix to the names of important lords, usually com bining with what appear to be the names of lineages or sublineages." It is possi ble that this honorific prefix is related to the term coh, "precious, beloved, es teemed", of the lowland languages, and therefore to T 534 (note also Quiche: kohoh = believe, worship honor, respect). ' Jl One could also translate "she (1000) the hidden one (202) who liberates (565a = lok) from T 60a.l042". Kl I interpret affixes T 82/83 as lab. Note the following expressions: Yucatec: lab = viejo, podrido, gastado, dahado. Manche Choi: lab = hechizo; laba = hechizar; alab = hechizero. Quiche (Brasseur): lab = agiiero, sueho; labalih = guerrear; labal - guerra. Cakchiquel: lab = agiiero, conseja, adivina cion; laba] = adivinar por agiieros, echar las suertes; labal = enemigo, guerra; labalij = guerrear, pelear. Kekchi: lab = envidia, malicia; labalinc = envidiar, perjudicar. Teco: lab'ax = sorcerer (Proto-Maya: *la .b'). Tzeltal: lab = nagual. (c) Yaxchilan Lintel 1 (Fig. 5). In the clause E6-F2 of Bonampak Stela 1 the glyph ahal.zotz'/zutz' appears be tween the references to the goddess and to Lord Muan. A similar construction is found on Yaxchilan Lintel 1 where the ahal. zotz glyph links a clause referring to the goddess with the name glyph of Shield-Jaguar. Yaxchilan Lintel 1 is devoted to the inauguration of Bird-Jaguar. Shield-Jaguar, his predecessor in the rulership of Yax chilan, was dead at this time (see section e).

These clauses are inscribed above (E1-G3) and behind (J1-J3) a lady who stands behind Bird-Jaguar and embraces her "sacred bundle or dowry" presented to Bird-Jaguar in a "sacred marriage rite" at or close to his inauguration (cf. Dutting 1976:60). The lady who is addressed by glyphs recalling the Great Goddess could be his real wife.</page><page sequence="11">?Bats" in the Usumacinta-Valley 11 This ritual marriage provided the future king with strength, and guaranteed prosperity for his country during his reign. The "giving of bread" in marriage prob ably was a custom widely spread in Mesoamerica. According to the Iroquois crea tion myth the heavenly marriage between the highest god Haohwengdschiawagi and the maiden Awenhai was fulfilled when the god took bread out of the breadfil led basket the maiden had brought (Krickeberg 1924:97, after J. N. Hewitt). Glyphs J1/J2 could also entitle Shield-Jaguar as ah.yal.zotz', "he the offspring of the bats". Grapheme T 4 and it allograph T 48 (monuments) correspond in my opinion to T 23inv of the Codices. The glyph for "north" (xaman in Yucatec) is given as 23inv.l037 in the Codices, and as 48.1008 on the monuments. I extend Knorozov's reading 23inv = xam(an) to 23inv/4/48 = xan-, "walk around", and translate the above mentioned glyphs for "north" as xan (23inv/48).xib (1037/1008), "where one walks around in fear". This "region of fear" probably is the "realm of death", thought to lie in the north. Likewise the Aztecs termed the north mict lampa, "hacia el infierno". The form of T 4 with infixed cross-bands, 4[153], could be a differ ent grapheme with another meaning, or could denote "walking around (4 = xan) and passing across (153 =ch'acat?)". In contrast to T 13 (zat), the prefix 13[153] of glyph El could be a distinct grapheme repre senting a pronoun.

Dibble and Anderson 1969:67 (note 1): "Besides 'divine sea, ocean', teuatl means the offering of blood; cf. Garibay, Historia, II, p. 407, on feuafi." Lit, agua divina. Es el nombre de la sangre vertida, sea en la guerra, sea en el sacrif icio. Con ella se nutre el Sol y se alimenta la Tierra'." Barthel suggested a reading lab of T 568 and a reading lab-bal - labal, "war, enemy" (Quich^/Cakchiquel) of 568:102. Such a reading accounts well for glyph V 3, but the principal meaning of lab, "omen, dream, sorcery" (section b), is difficult to reconcile with the primary meaning "sacrifice" of T 568 (see discussion in section g). A "blindfolding jaguar" (60c:751, kax-uich.balaml) plays a prominent role in the inscriptions of the early-classic Lintels 37 and 35 of Yaxchilan, and could have been an early ruler of that site. Yaxchilan Lintel 35: X2 125[?].168a:513:142, "he (125 = ah) the... ruler (168a) of the revered ones/of those who count (513:142 = tzic-oml)" I W3 60c:751, Blindfolding Jaguar / X3 228.168a:197.512a. Mathews (1978) understands glyph X3 as emblem of Bonampak. The compound 197.512a actually seems to be the main element of the Bonampak emblem glyph (see sections a and b). If Matitiews is right, Blindfolding Jaguar must have been ruler of Yaxchilan and Bonampak. Alternatively, the compound 197.512a could refer to a "captive", and glyph X3 could denote: "set in (228 = ac) is the ruler (168a) of the captives (197.512a)", or "the one with the grass (ac) [used in self-castigationalprac tices], the ruler of the captives". A comparable clause, referring to another lord, ap pears on Lintel 37 (T2-T3): 125[?]."168a:513:142 / 125.?.1013a, (name of lord) / 228.168a:197.512a. A "blindfolding jaguar" reappears at a much later time on Kund-Lacanha Lintel 1 (9.15.15.0.0), again followed by a glyph which either is the emblem of Bonampak or a reference to a "ruler of the captives" (see section j). After some intervening clauses (Dutting 1976:107) the text of Structure 44, southeast doorway, upper step, ends (Fig. 6b): Y5b,X6a 2 Chuen 14 Mol (9.14.17.15.11) / X6b 87.512a:25.181, "making? (25.181) a captive (512-87 = chuc [ul]te)" I Y6 622.580 - 520.126, (name of captive) / X7 229.586.126, ak.muC't-aM% "a new one is awaited"? / 582.279[534], "[by] the gatherer (582 = mol) of precious?

The last glyph, which probably addresses the captive, could also denote "leader of the... bats of the north (4 = xam[an]?)". Grapheme 279 represents formally a "muan feather". Muan-feathers charac terize the headdress of the old underworld god L, for instance on the East Sanctuary Jamb Panel of the Temple of the Cross, Palenque, on the Vase of the Seven Gods (Fig. 21, section n) and on Grolier Vase No. 42 (M. Coe 1973:97). The "gatherer of muan-feathers" may be god L himself, the ruler of the underworld6. An association of T 279 with death and underworld is likely. On Yaxchilan Lintel 25 (back) a kneeling lady offers a bowl with blood-stained strips of bark-paper to a deceased heroe emerging from the opened jaws of a raised "serpent of rebirth". Her hair is decorated with a 6 I withdraw my previous reading T 279 = muk (Dutting 1976:107) in favor of a reading T 575 = muk (Dutting 1978a/78b, and section e).</page><page sequence="14">14 Dieter Diitting Fig. 6 b Yaxchilan Structure 44, southeast doorway, upper step, glyphs Y5b?X7 (drawing by Ian Graham) smaller double-headed serpent of skeletal appearance, the front-head of which ist a skull with attached kan cross (T 281). Out of the opened jaws of its rear-head, to which grapheme T 19 (muh, "shadow, shade") is attached, feathers emerge, among them a muan-feather (T 279). Next to the given "capture" passage a captive is carved with the glyphs 622:580-501:102 inscribed on his loincloth. The glyph 501:102 might not only stand for naab.bal = naabal, but also forhaa.bal; note Yucatec: naabal = untarse, ungirse; haabal = pass, de haa, ah = lavar la cabeza con tal yerba o con qualquier agua. The glyphs on the loincloth thus could denote: "[the captive named] 622.580-520.126 is anointed (naabal) or washed (haabal)", possibly a reference to some act preparatory of a sacrifice. The same capture is recorded on Yaxchilan Stela 18: A2,A3 (9.14.17.15.11) 3 Eb 14 Mol (should be 2 Chuen 14 Mol) / A4 87.152a.25:181, "making?

The last two glyphs might refer to the forthcoming judgement of the dead captive in the underworld by the Lord of the Night, possibly god L. Glyph A10 could also denote "the bench/jurisdiction (91 = fem[el]?) comes down into the realm of shivering/coldness". I extend Knorozov's reading T 90/91 = tern (Codices) to T 89/92 of the monuments putting 1978b). Note Yucatec: tern = purse; bench, dais, altar; alleviate; satisfy. The reading tern probably can be extended to ten, and that of T 92 to tem-el I ten-el. Infixed to grapheme T 712, em, "de scend", is T 121/617a, mek, thus indicating em.mek = em.ek, "descent into darkness7. The reading 81 = cel/ceel was suggested by Barthel; cf. Yucatec: ceei = frio, espanto, asombro o turbacion que causa frio; u ceeli mitnal = el frio del infierno8. On Stela 18 the captive kneels in front of the Yaxchilan lord Shield-Jaguar who holds a lance and a "bag filled with poison". Glyphs above the captive (F1-F3): 229.622:580-520.126, (name of captive)9 / 756a:25.4, zotz'.cal/cay.xan?., "powerful/destroying bat who walks around". The last glyph clearly addresses the captive as "man of the bats". Yaxchilan Structure 44 and Stela 18 treat events belonging to Shield-Jaguar's life. He seems to be the captor of the captive 622:580-520.126. No birth- and no clear inauguration date of Shield-Jaguar have been found in the Yaxchilan inscrip tions, and Proskouriakoff (1963:161) raised the question if he was "a foreigner who usurped the rule of Yaxchilan by a military or political coup". Foreigners were also the "bats" who are distinguished by affixes 25.4 as "powerful or killing" (25) and as "walking around" or "being from the north" (4). Outstanding among Shield Jaguar's deeds as warrior seems to have been his capturing the "leader of the bats", the lord named 622:580-520.126. My previous assumption that Shield-Jaguar was a god, a deified ancestor of Bird-Jaguar's lineage, certainly was too simple. Possibly the historical Shield Jaguar, the immediate predecessor of Bird-Jaguar on the throne of Yaxchilan, was named after an ancestor god (?) having the same name. (e) Shield-Jaguar's reign. The inscriptions on the lower and upper steps of the middle doorway of Yax chilan Structure 44 are devoted to Shield-Jaguar's life. The text on the lower step (Fig. 7) starts by referring to the death of a Great Sun-Bat: 7 In recent papers (Diitting 1978a,b) I interpreted graphemes 121/617a as tz'ac, "cure, medicine; complete, adjust", with extension to tz'acab, "generation, lineage, descent in the mother's line". I withdraw this reading in favor of a reading mek, "embrace". Em.ek could also denote "descent of the star". 8 Instead of T 81 the suffix of main sign 712 could also be T 314, kikl, "blood" (cf. Diitting 1976:46). In this case the des cent would be into "the realm of blood". According to the Uaxactun-Vase (Fig. 23, section n) the deepest underworld is charac terized by a "lake of blood". 9 In A5 of the Stela 18- inscription affix 12 is prefixed to the captive's name, a clear indication thatT 12 and T 229 are ex changeable. Since these prefixes are absent from the same name glyph in Y6 of the above mentioned Structure 44- inscription, they probably do not belong to the actual name.</page><page sequence="16">16 Dieter Dutting M1,N1 (9.11.18.15.1) 7 Imix 14 Zotz', death of Sun-Bat(?) / 01 207.1030a, "it suffers misfortune (207 = tzap) god K (1030a)"? / PI IV:86:1012:142, ".the heavenly (IV = can) head (86 = wf) of the snakes/dragons (1012:142)" / M2 59.115:614:515?, ti.noh.tz'dm.cuch?, "on the great throne of office is" / N2 l:757v:24, u.bah-ill, "the first one of"? / 02 121.78:1000, mek.pepen.ix[oq], "the embracer, the Butterfly Woman" / P2 75:514:142, "passed has (74-142 = man-om?) to the heavenly realm of the dead (514 = yax-fzei?, blue bowl/heaven)" / M3 115:756[544]:116, noh.zotz'.kin, "the Great Sun-Bat" / N3 IV.28:548, can.katun, "the fierce warrior" / 03 12:1000f:130, "died has (12-130 = xuf-aan?) the lord (1000f)" / P3 IV:28:548:142, can.katun, "the fierce warrior". God K, the "guardian of the royal lineages" (the T 121, mek, elements on his body and forehead may designate him as "embracer", just as T 24, il, elements distinguish him as' 'seer, guardian"), suffers misfortune, because the Great Sun-Bat has died. Behind the name "great sun-bat" a mythical figure, a solar bat-demon is hiding who is re ferred to on the Palace [Ruz I]-Tablett Palenque, by the glyphs (P13/013): 115.756[544]:116, "great sun-bat" / 183:544.116, "[of the] east". Barthel (1966:110) drew attention to Codex Bor gia 49 where the bat-demon of the east wears the headband of the Mexican sun god Tonatiuh. Disregarding these mythical associations the Great Sun-Bat of the Yaxchilan inscription probably is a historical figure, but his relationship to Shield-Jaguar and Bird-Jaguar remains unclear.

The passage M5-P5 probably addresses the Great Goddess, the divine patro ness of childbirth. Alternatively one could hypothesize that this passage addresses Shield-Jaguar's wife who is referred to by titles of the goddess. The reading of glyph N5 makes use of Quiche muc,' 'to see''. Another possible interpretation of N5, "she (1000) who removes (178 = el) with force (25 = coJ?) the hidden one (602 = muc)", "she who extracts the heart", is unlikely in this context. The glyph P5 could also be translated as11 queen of Yaxchilan (511)", if one neglects the suffix 116. It fol lows a passage referring to Bird-Jaguar who, after Shield-Jaguar's death and some years of intermission, was raised upon the throne of Yaxchilan: M6 1:535:23 or 24, u.murt.al, "her tender son", or u.murt.il' "her slave"? / N6 IV:168b:28:548, "the fierce (IV = can) leader (168b) of the warriors (28:548 = katun)" I 06 12:VI:528:116, xul?.uac.haab.kin, "the one with the digging stick at the onset of the rainy season"? / P6 125:236:751:142, Bird-Jaguar / M7 36:168b:511, "the precious offspring of the lords of Yaxchilan" / N7 10301, nim.bat-te = nim.batel, "the great ball-player"10. One could conclude from glyph M6 that Bird-Jaguar was the son of Shield Jaguar and the lady referred to eventually by glyphs N5-P5, but only if the munal reading holds true. The text continues with a reference to two deities of hell, to the dangerous underworld bat (the Camazotz' of the Popol Vuh) and to the old god N (Mam), and closes then with a passage dedicated to the great goddess, the highest deity of Yaxchilan: 07, P7 683a:126, kal-ah "enclosing" / 1:669:82, u.kab.labl, "his destroying hand" / ?.756a, "...bat" / 08, P8 1014a, Mam (god N) / 1.1040, u.cimi, "his death" / 126.756a: 116, ah.zotz'.kin, "he the sun-bat" / Q4 630.181:178, tzen-t-ic.el, "it sustains those who emerge" / Q5 19:565a:88, muh.lok.tac?, "it protects the beloved/bought ones who are sent" / Q6 XII:2000[202]:245, "she (1000) the hidden one (202 = muc) of the 12th heaven (XII)..."11. 10 The reading nim.bate of 10301, derived from the Quiche of the Popol Vuh, was suggested by Barthel. In Quiche the ballgame is termed chaah. The gaming equipment consists of the "ball' (kiq'), "rings" (bate), "gloves" {pachq'ab) and"aprons (tz'um), according to the Popol Vuh (Edmonson 1971:lines 3411f).). The word bate, a widely used generic term of the Mesoamerican ballgame, is attributed to the Antillean Indians (op.cit., note 1856). 11 Barthel suggested to extend a reading 245 = ta to tat, "father", and to interpret Q6 as reference to "the mothers and fathers (hidden) in the 12th heaven". T 202 is the affix version of T 586/602.</page><page sequence="18">18 Dieter Dutting Glyphs O8/P8 probably refer to the death of the Great Sun-Bat. Could he have been the grandfather of Bird-Jaguar?

There is a slight possibility that T 582 itself not only stands for the values mol/mul, but in the context of blood-sacrifice also for kik/ch'ich', "blood" (cf. Dutting 1976:102). Previously I interpreted "capture glyphs" followed by 1.501:102 as "captures for birth" (Dutting 1976:101). This interpretation made use of a translation 1.501:102, u.naab.bal, "the mothers' hidden matter". I am not sure anymore that this interpretation applies to the forementioned texts. Shield-Jaguar's birth is nowhere recorded at Yaxchilan, and Proskouriakoff probably is right if she regards him as foreign usurper. He must have been quite young by the time of the "capture" on 9.12.8.14.1 which probably established his power at Yaxchilan. Assuming that he was 18 years old at 9.12.8.14.1 he would have died on 9.15.10.17.14 (Stela 12, see below) with an age of 79. Eight months (12 Uinals) after the capture on 9.12.8.14.1 he probably was inau gurated as ruler of Yaxchilan. The possible record of his accession follows the above mentioned capture passages on the upper step, middle doorway, Yaxchilan Struc ture 44, after a DN of 12 Uinals (D8-C9a): C10 (9.12.9.8.1) 5 Imix 4 Mac, (inauguration of Shield-Jaguar?) / D10 513:59, tzic. ti, ' 'place of honoring/counting''? 16:121:713:114?, "first (16 = yax) embracing (121 = mek?) all (713a = lah) designated ones (114 = chic)" I Cll ?:?/533?:565a, ahau?.lok, "the lords, the beloved / esteemed ones"/ Dll 679a. 121:713.181 "in the well (679a = ch'en) is the embracer (121 = mek?) and bearer (181 = iq) of all things (713a = lahYl / C12 IX.714, "the one who grasps many (DC) fishes/human embryos [for birth]" (= god K) / D12 122:563a, kak.zi', "burning firewood", or "fire is the gift" / 765a:102, oc.bal, "it appears/enters" /</page><page sequence="20">20 Dieter Dutting C13 1030o, nim?, "the great/honorable one" / 89 or 92.60b:757, "raised upon the dais (89/92 = tern) is the first one (757 = bah) after doing penitence (69b = kax)"12 I D13 93.672P.74, "smoke/honor is given and spreads (74 = man)"?. Superfix 122 of glyph D12 could also stand for toe, "burn" (Knorozov 1967). Shield-Jaguar is not mentioned here explicitely, but in the text preceding this clause he is referred to in the passage C7b-C8b, again after the glyph 765a: 102. The crucial glyph in this "inaugural text" is 89 or 92.60b:757; for a discussion of this glyph and of the compound 121:713.181 I refer to Dutting (1978b). Shield-Jaguar's possible inauguration clause, given above, resembles that of the Quirigua lord Two-Armed Sky on Quirigua Stela J (Fig. 9): H3,G4 (9.14.13.4.7) 12 Caban 5 Kayab, inauguration of Two-Armed Sky / H4 121:713.181:126, "embracer (121 = me/c?) and bearer (181 = iq) of all things (713a = lah), he (126 = ah)" I G5 IX.714.181, "who grasps many (IX) fishes/human embryos [for birth]" / H5,G6 1030a:102, god K / 1030o?, nim, "the great one"? / H6 89.60b:757, tem.kax.bah?, "raised upon the dais is the first one after doing penitence" / G7,H7 122.175:82:117 - 561c:23 - 115:761:59, Two-Armed Sky / G8 93.672:142, "smoke/honor is given to"?

Maudslay) 12 Note Quich6 (Basseta): tern = viga, assiento; temah = tomar assiento; ahauaribal tern = assiento de rey. In the Titulo C'oyoi (Carmack 1973:294), a major Quich? document of the colonial period, an account of the insignia of lordship is given (p.18): "... they had their throne (c'ok'alibal)... their little benches and stools (quitem quich'acat); they had their parasols (c'o quimuj rue'),Carmack (1973:320) remarks: "quitem, quich'acat." "Their benches and their stools." These were the seats of authority for the Quiche\ Vico (n.d.a.) states that tern was "a little bench that they gave, and (they) sat on it as a sign that they were heads of the calpul, (and) of great authority; and (they were) careful to incense it."</page><page sequence="21">?Bats" in the Usumacinta-Valley 21 The same inaugural date is accompanied on Quirigua Stela E (west) by the clause (A9a-B9b): 1:1030d:670r "his (u) setting in order (670 = tzol) the [insignia of] royal descent? (1030d)" / 122:175:561 - 1030ir Two-Armed Sky. The passage H4 -G6 of Quirigua Stela J expresses in my opinion the same idea as the glyph 1:1030d:670 of Stela E. Both describe the concept inherent in the bear ing of the god K- canhel- insignia. On Yaxchilan Lintel 25 (back) the suggested inaugural date of Shield-Jaguar accompanies a "serpent rite". A kneeling lady presents a bowl with blood-stained strips of bark-paper to "the spirit of a dead ancestor or heroe'' (Proskouriakoff), prob ably to Shield-Jaguar's deceased father, who emerges from the upper opened jaws of a rised "serpent of rebirth". The event glyphs refer to the "grasping of fishes/hu man embryos" for rebirth by godK(Fl-El): (9.12.9.8.1) 5 Imix 4 Mac/ 1:714:130 l:1030b:178.24?. I assume that the connection of a "grasping fish" - clause and of an "accession" - clause with a single date indicates the establishment of a new lineage, in this case the establishment of Shield-Jaguar's lineage. There are two lintels which depict a lady, a representative of the Great Goddess, offering a 1'sacred bundle or dowry'' to Shield-Jaguar in the proposed''sacred marriage'' rite on the occa sion of his inauguration to the rulership of Yaxchilan. The lintels are Lintel 32, dated (9.15.10.5.13) 12? Ben 16 Mac, andLinreJ 53, dated (9.15.18.7.13) 7 Ben 16 Mac. These dates are exactly 8 solar and 5 Venus years apart and enframe Shield-Jaguar's death on (9.15.10.17.14) 6 Hix 12 Yaxkin (cf. Dutting 1976:94f.). The date of Lintel 32 lies exactly 60 Haabs (solar years), 5 Jupiter-cycles a 12 years13, after Shield-Jaguar's proposed inauguration on 9.12.9.8.1, and therefore seems to commemorate this important event. In contrast to Shield-Jaguar's origin, there can be not doubt about his death, which is recorded on Yaxchilan Stela 12: A1,B1 (9.15.10.17.14) 6 Hix 12 Yaxkin, death of Shield-Jaguar / A2 793v:575, "it vanishes?

Grapheme T575 I translate now as muk, "suffering, labor j strength" (Yucatec, Manche Choi) (Dutting 1978a/78b). The text con tinues with a distance number which leads to the inauguration of Shield-Jaguar's successor, Bird-Jaguar: B5 1.573.181:25:12, u.keX'ic.cal?.xol?, "its changing the power of the staff"? / A6,B6 10.0.6 (DN) / 679a.513:59, ch'en(i).tzic.ti, "silent is the count at" / C1,D1 (9.16.1.0.0) 11 Ahau 7 Tzec, Bird-Jaguar's inauguration / C2 644a:116:130, "seated is (644-130 = cum/chum-aan) is the sun (116 = kin)" I D2 59.168b:188, "in (59) the line (188 = Je) of the rulers (168b)" / C3, D3 87:528:61 - 291:552:292 / 561a:23 - 1013a:23, "bird-claw clause" (priestly titles of Bird-Jaguar?) / 13 The Jupiter cycle of 12 years plays a great role in the ancient Chinese astronomy (Needham 1959:402).</page><page sequence="22">22 Dieter Dutting C4 1.108:764, u... chart, "his... snake" / 12:1:528, "vassal?

The glyph 12:1:528 is discussed in section n. Bird-Jaguar, whose usual name is 126.236:751, ah.ch'ich'?.balam, seems to be named here after the Great Sun-Bat (his grandfather?), who is mentioned on the backside of Stela 12 after a lengthy clause (F3-F5) referring to Shield-Jaguar: Gl V.28:548:142, "praised? (V) warrior (28:548)" / HI 125.168b:513, "the lord (168b), the honorable one (125-513) = ah-tzic)" I G2 1.17:676:142, "his first (1.17 = xx.yax).. / H2 10301, nim.bat-te = nim.bate?, "the great ball-player"? / G3 1.17?:510, "his first (1.17 = u.yax) star (510)" / H3 115:756[544]:116, noh.zotz'kin., "the great sun-bat", Bird-Jaguar's grandfather(?) / G4 V.28:548, ho.katun, "the revered? warrior". The "great sun-bat" is mentioned here in relation to a Venus phase and in rela tion to another cosmic phenomenon expressed by glyph G2. Bird-Jaguar is called 126.756a:l 16-751, ah.zotz .kin-balam, also onPiedras Negras Lintel 3, in the small incised inscription to the left of the depicted throne, on which he is seated. Ac cording to text and iconography he holds an audience at Piedras Negras on (9.16.6.10.19) 2 Cauac 2 Muan or (9.16.6.9.16) 5 Cib 19 Mac, shortly before the death of the Piedras Negras lord T 1018a on (9.16.6.11.17) 7 Caban 0 Pax14, probably to regulate the succession to the Piedras Negras throne (cf. Marcus 1976:87). On Yaxchilan Stela 11 (Deity side) the deceased Shield-Jaguar is seated in heaven together with a lady whose first title is T 1001 (= 182.1000:32). I interpreted this lady as goddess, this because of the wide distribution of the title 1001 in the Maya area. I think now that the situation is more complex. Possibly T 1001 was a general title of royal Maya ladies derived from the name of a goddess. In the Naranjo inscriptions this title is used to address a "princess of Tikal" who married a Naranjo lord named 122.765v:117.1 certainly was wrong when I attributed the title 1001 in this case to a goddess. Just as Maya lords were named after gods, so also noble ladies could have been named after goddesses15.1 assume the worship of a great goddess T 1001 who lent her name to female nobles of various Maya sites. Yaxchilan Lintel 27 (Fig. 10) records the death of a lady whose name clause be gins with 1001. The other more specific titles are difficult to transcribe because of the weathering of the text: A1.B1 (9.13.13.12.5) 6 Chicchan 8 Zac / A2 793v:575, "it vanishes? (793v) the strength (575 = muk)'l / B2 1.58[533].503:24, u.zac.ahau.ik'-ilr "the fainting lord's spirit" / 14 The clause referring to the death of the Piedras Negras lord reads (U1-V3): (9.16.6.11.17) 7Caban 0 Pax / 77:575, xik.muk, "it flies off/vanishes the strength" / destroyed glyph / 1018a, name of Piedras Negras lord / 32:115.168a:585c, "off spring (32 = pul?) of the great (115 = noh?) lords (168a) of Piedras Negras (585c)". - 15 On Naranjo Stela 24, west, E16 -E18, the Tikal princess is referred to by the glyphs: 1001 / 1000.VI / 284?:561a.24 / 1000.168a:569/ 757.25:501. In other texts 1000.168a:569 ("queen orprincess of Tikal") is replaced by 36.168a:569 ("precious offspring of the lords of Tikal") (cf. Dutting 1976:69). I assume now that all these glyphs address the Tikal princess.</page><page sequence="23">?Bats" in the Usumacinta-Valley 23 A B C D E F G H t-?-:-:-?-~_-? Fig.. 10 Yaxchilan Lintel 27 (drawing by Ian Graham) C1,D1 1001 / VI:28:548 - 1000:103, uac.katun-ix.bal?, "it emerges the warrior - the hidden mistress" / C2 1000:624[537v]? - 1000:?, "she with the war-shield - she ..." / D2 1000:168?:?.? - 1000:501.25:501, "she the ruler... - she the first one up to the border of the ocean"?. After a distance number the text records the death of Shield-Jaguar in a clause corresponding to that of Stela 12. The war-like lady mentioned here certainly is not the great goddess 1001, but a noble lady from Yaxchilan(?) who bears the deity name 1001 as title. This lady cannot have been Bird Jaguar's mother, since Bird-Jaguar was born on (9.13.17.12.10) 8 Oc 13 Yax (Lintels 29/30; Proskouriakoff 1964:178), and probably was not Shield-Jaguar's wife. The heavenly lady T 1001 who faces Shield-Jaguar in the upper part of the deity side of Yaxchilan Stela 11, is either this lady after her death, or - and I regard this as more likely - the great goddess T 1001 herself. She is accompanied by the following glyphs: VI 13?.60b:757:25?, zaLkax.wah/bah.call, "lost is the bundle with bread/the first things, the powerful one"? / V2,V3 1001 / 1000.281?:117? - 561:23, caan-al, "there on high" / V4 1000:12 - 36.1016:23, "the mistress (1000) of the deceased (12 = xuJ?) precious offspring (36) of the fathers (1016:23 = yum-ai)". This text does not allow to decide, whether we are confronted here with the deceased lady 1001 or with the great goddess 1001. The date accompanying this scene and Bird-Jaguar in front of three captives be low, 1 Imix 19 Xul (9.15.19.1.1), falls well after Shield-Jaguar's death and shortly before Bird-Jaguar's inauguration. On Yaxchilan Stela 10 (date unknown) the text beneath the scene, the sacrifice of a captive, starts again with a reference to the lady 1001, followed by a posthumous (?) reference to Shield-Jaguar: Dl 1.60b:757, u.kax.wah/bah, "her bundle with bread/first things"? / El 204.1:606:23, u?.hun.cux-t-al?, "her? unique life" / D2,E2 1001 / 1000?:? - 746:23, cot-al I Fl 1000:12 - 32:1016:60?, "the mistress (1000) of the dead (12 = xuJ?) offspring (32 = pul) of the fathers (1016 = yum)..." / Gl 1000.168b:25:764, "the queen (1000.168b) of the powerful (25 = cal) or destroying (25 = cay) snakes (764 = chan)" I F2 221 [5441:544:166, west / 10301, nim.bat-te, "the great ball-player"?.</page><page sequence="24">24 Dieter Dutting The fact that the lady 1001 is never accompanied by the Yaxchilan emblem glyphs argues against the possibility that she preceded Shield-Jaguar in the ruler ship of Yaxchilan. The foregoing text is in my opinion easier to reconcile with her possible role as goddess than with her being a deceased human person. In the fol lowing text (G2-J2) Shield-Jaguar is termed 168b:712:81 (G2b), "the lord (168b) who descends (712 = em) into coldness? (81 = eel?)", i.e. into the underworld. His name glyph is modified to 152:1014a-751:142 (H2), "Shield-Jaguar in the realm of the Mam/god N (1014a)", again a reference to Shield-Jaguar in the underworld. To account for this the assumption is justified that the Stela was erected shortly after Shield-Jaguar's death. In this and the preceding chapter a new interpretation of the "imix-bundle" glyph 501:102, Proskouriakoff's "prisoner" glyph, was given which contrasts to my older view of this glyph (Dutting 1976:42). This older position can be summarized as follows: On the Tikal Bones MT-51:A/B the glyph 11.501:102 appears in the clause "ideogram for paddling" / 1030b, god K/ 11.501:102. There 501:102 probably refers to the "fishes/human embryos", "the hidden ones" (102 = bed), god K is capturing from the "mythical lake" (501 = naab) he is paddling on. Since an extension of 501, naab, "lake, sea", to naab, "mothers", seems to be justified, the glyph 501:102 could also denote "the mother's hidden matter". This could be either a reference to that which is hidden in the mother's womb", the'1 embryo'', or to a "sacred bundle'' belonging to the mothers. The passage E6-E7 of Copan Stela A favors this interpre tation (cf. Dutting 1974:54).Considerations like these and the fact that the"captures" by Shield-Jaguar on 9.12.8.14.1 and by Bird-Jaguar on 9.16.4.1.1 fall both on a day Imix (= 501, naab) caused me to introduce the Nahuatl-derived "capture for birth" concept to explain passages in which "capture" glyph and "imix bundle" glyph follow each other. I would not be surprised if the contrasting semantic concepts, inherent in the simple reading nab-bal (= nabal) of 501:102, were intended by the scribes, that "captures in war" symbolized at least partly "captures for birth". (f) Piedras Negras Lintel 2 (Fig. 11). Piedras Negras Lintel 2 depicts an assembly of warriors. The largest and central person (in front-view) seems to be a Piedras Negras lord, named 64:626 or 60[202]:626 in the main text. He wellcomes a group of six kneeling warriors with mosaic-encrusted helmets of the type T 678. These helmets are crowned by the Fig. 11 Piedras Negras Lintel 2 (photogr. by H. Burger, courtesy of Peabody Museum, Har vard University)</page><page sequence="25">?Bats" in the Usumacinta-Valley 25 Mexican year symbol above a "knot", and a plume of feathers. Kubler (1973:173) re garded them as "warriors in Teotihuacan dress", and Barthel (pers. comm.) unters tands them as fugitives who left the destroyed Teotihuacan to find a new residence at Piedras Negras. The main text starts: Al-Gl 9.11.6.2.1 3 Imix 19 Ceh (IS + Lunar count) / HI 93.533:670:130, "ordered (in a line) (670:130 = tzol-aan?) are the famous?

The "eight powerful firstborns"16 are the eight lords depicted on the lintel. The glyph 12 could refer to the younger warrior standing behind the head-chief Pah-Coc. I consider a reading too/tool of T 678. Note Cakchiquel: too = proteger, ayudar, mirar por alguno, intereceder; tool = abogado, protector; toobal = ayuda, protection, intercesion. Quiche: too/tooh = favor, promote, protect, aid, help; tool - protector; toobal = help, protec tion, rite, cure. Pocomchi: tou = helfen; tool = Heifer. Uspantec: tou = helfen. Yucatec: tool = envoltura; too, ah = envolver con hojas, panos, yerbas. Following my suggestion Barthel has related T 678, toott, to the syllable tol in the Nahuatl words Tollan/Toltec. The Quiche* traced their origin to a certain Tula(n), which probably is identical with the Nahuatl Tollan, the "place of reeds", the home of Quetzalcoatl and the legendary Toltec people. The glyph 678.130 of the Middle Tablet of the Temple of the Inscrip tions, Palenque, tool-an, was related by Barthel (1978) to Tollan/Tulan. Probably several Tol lans existed, the oldest of them identical with the late Teotihuacan. The translation taq-yax, "help, aid", of T 18 (= 88[17]), suggested by Barthel, makes use of Chorti: takreyax = help, cooperation; takre = to help. Another possible interpretation of T 18, based onT 88 = taq, "send, call, command", could be yax-fag, "first message/call". The trans lation chij-el, "promise", of 671:140 is derived from Quiche: chiih = promise; chiihel = prom ising. I have considered to read glyph J2 as "the strong one (16) wellcomes/receives/meets (202/586 = kul) the first ones (501) of his blood (314)"; cf. Quiche: rax = green, blue, beautiful, new unripe, hard, strong, violent; k'ul- = receive, accept, consent, expect; q'ul- = find, meet, greet, receive, anoint, many; nabe = first; nabeyal = preceding, firstborn. The reading 586/602 = kul ist still a good possibility. But since it is hard to reconcile with the glyph 586:25.178 of the Chich'en Itza inscriptions, I returned recently to my old reading T 586/602 = muc. For T 314 = kik, "blood", see Dutting (1976:46). Ih Barthel (1978) extends the reading nab-al of 501:23 to naual, the Nahuatl derived Quiche term for a "magician".</page><page sequence="26">26 Dieter Dutting According to the first translation of J2, the kneeling warriors with the Teotihuacan helmet could be relatives of the Piedras Negras lord.

Each of the six kneeling warriors is accompanied by a group of six glyphs in the glyph panel directly above. I number these warriors sequentially from the one kneeling directly in front of Pah-Coc back to the last one of the row: 1) I'l-J'3: 19.603:100? / 586:59 / 122.712[504] / 16?.34:501[202] / 756a:25-178.4v / 168a:518a.l30. 2) G'l-H'3: 632:? / 561a:23 / 1030d / 19.anim.head.130 / 745 / 168a:518a.l30. 3) E'l-F'3: 19?:raised arms [764?] / 38?.1016 / 280:565a?.178 / 229.100 / 756a:25-178.4v / 747a. 4) Cl-D'3: 122?:712[504]? / ?.1040 / 122.712[504]inv? / 58.534:25 / 756a:25-178.4v / 747a. 5) A'l-B'3: III.?:124 / 122:712[504]? / 281:23 / ?.?:? / 299:561:23? / 747a. 6) Y1-Z3: 86:561a:140/ ?.671:67 / 134.776?.134 / 12.586?.126?:? / 45?.528:579? / 168a:756a[217]:25-178.4v. I shall not try to give a translation of these clauses, and shall discuss only the fi nal titles of the six warriors. Warriors 1,3 and 4 are entitled 756a:25-178.4v, "the bat (756a), the powerful one (25-178 = cal-el?) or destroyer (25-178 = cay-ell), who walks around? (4 = xcm?)". Warrior 6 is entitled 168a:756a[217]:25-178.4v, "leader (168a) of the killing? (217 = lah) bats (756a), the powerful ones (25-178), who walk around? (4v)". One could also translate "leader of all (217 = lah) bats...". This is one of the earliest records of "bats" in the Usumacinta valley. If Barthel's interpretation of these warriors as Teotihuacan fugitives holds true, the glyph 756a:25-178.4v could be a general expression for a homeless fugitive, for "one who flutters around like a bat". Warrior 2 is characterized by T 745, Thompson's "pelican" grapheme (mean ing?). The final title of warriors 1 and 2 is 168a:518a.l30, interpreted by Barthel (1968:127) as "leader (168a-130) of the scouts (518a, b =xac?)"; cf. Yucatec: ah xac = escucha o espia del campo, en tierra y en mar (Motul). This is a title appropiate of leading warriors. Warriors 3,4 and 5 are distinguished by the "vulture" head 747a, kuch, as final title. It may denote here kuch, "the true/noble one''. Occasionally 747a substitutes for 533, ahau "lord", in the glyph of the day Ahau (Piedras Negras Lintel 3, Copan Stela I). The smaller warrior standing behind the ruler Pah-Coc, probably his son, is ac companied by the glyphs: K'l 684 [757?], hok.bah?, "it appears/emerges the first one"? / L'l I000f:130, mehen.yan, "a son comes into existence"? / K'2 229.529, ak.haab, "new rainy season" / K'3 287:110, tz'u[h]-tan, "magician" / K'4 101 (= 33:115).100a:585a, Piedras Negras emblem (var.).</page><page sequence="27">,Bats" in the Usumacinta-Valley 27 The young lord is either termed tz'u[h]-tan, "magician", in K'3, or "the one in the midst of (119 = tan) drops of rain (287 = tz'uh)" (cf. Dutting 1974:11). The Tlaloc-ring around his eye17 and the glyph K'2 suggest some relationship to the beginning of rain-fall. According to the glyphs K'l/L'l he could be a son of the Piedras Negras lord Pah-Coc. (g) Piedras Negras Stela 12. On Piedras Negras Stela 12 with its nine bound captives in the lower part of the front scene the left standing attendant of the enthroned lord is accompanied by the following text in front of his face: 61.756[568], "the bat (756) who beheads (61-568 =hol-lom =holom)" I 1.23:565a, "a unique child (1.23 = hun.al) is bought [for sacri fice] (565a = iok?)"18 / 280.582:136, "as gift (136 = may) for the gatherer of muan feathers (280.582)", (i.e. for god L?) / 12.585a:77?:136, (name of victim?). The last glyph could also be a statement like'1 end (12= xul ?) of the way (585a = bix), it flies away (77 = xik) the gift / [soul]? (136 = may)". Fig. 12 a Glyph for "human" sacrifice by beheading" Fig. 12 b The Copan "emblem glyph" I unterstand the glyph 61.756[568] (Fig. 12a), following Barthel (1966) and Thompson (1966), as reference to a "bat who sacrifices humans by beheading", that is to a special type of "sacrificer". Anthropomorphised bats engaged in the behead ing of humans are depicted in Codex Vaticanus B 24 and Codex Fejervary-Mayer 41 (Fig. 13). According to the Popol Vuh a bat demon of the underworld, called Camazotz' (Death Bat), decapitates the heroe Hunahpu. On the famous "bat vase" from Chama (Seler GA III: 641, after E. P. Dieseldorff) the depicted "bat demon" of the underworld wears a T 12-death eye collar; two huge death eyes decorate his wings, flames (T 122, kak) emerge from his mouth. This bat demon is also referred to in the first glyph column (1-4) of the Nebaj Fenton Vase (Seler GA III: 718): 229.682:126, ak.kal-ah, "the new one is enclosed" / 1014a:88, "the Mam (1014a) calls (88 = taq)" I 1030.756a:595v, "the bat (756a) sucks the blood? (595v) of god K (1030)" / 61.77:585a, "Hawk (77 = xik) beheads (61 = hoi) the miserable one (585 = pix)". The bat is mentioned here together with two other underworld deities, the old god N (Mam), and the sinister Xik who beheads the newly arrived victim, the de ceased one burdened with sins. 17 Tlaloc was the "sorcerer" (naualli) par excellance in ancient Mexico. He is termed "magic prince" (naualpilli) in the Aztec Song dedicated to him (Sahagun, Florentine Codex, Cook 2, p.208). The production of the first fruits is his magic. 18 Lok' is the Quichean, Mamean and Kanjobalan term for "to buy''. In Yucatec, the Cholan and Tzeltalan languages we find man, "buy".</page><page sequence="28">28 Dieter Dutting With respect to Zimmermann's (1956) reading lorn of T 568 note Yucatec: lorn, ah = fisgar, harponear, dar estocada o puhalada, alancear, aguijonear; lorn = tiro de lanza o dardo. Man che Choi: lomte = lanza; lomo, lomtein - tirar con lanza. I suppose that T 568 can also stand for Yucatec olom, "sangre, sangre cuajada, las entrahas". With respect to 61-568 = holom note Quiche/Cakchiquel/Kekchi: holom - cabeza. The possibility has to be considered that only "T 568 pierced by an arrow or lance" (= T 568v), appearing in C. Dresden 46-50d6( corresponds to the value lorn, "pierce", and that T 568 corresponds to another value. This is the position presently held by Barthel. I am inclined to interpret T568v as lom-te, which according to the Cholti expressions can also refer to "lance; piercing"19. A well-known clause of the Chich'en Itza inscriptions, referring to the pulling of grass trough the penis in self-castigation, reads (e.g. Beyer 86, Three Lintels I, F2-G2): 35.568 - 228.608:188v - 130.506, "shedding (35 = pul) [blood] by piercing (568 = iom?) - [the pulling of] grass (228 = ac) through the phallus (608 = toon) [provides] the blood? (188v) - [for] the elotes (130 = ahan), the desired ones (506 =kan)". Thompson (1966:182) recognized the "sacrifice" grapheme 568 as "a somewhat conventionalised representation of the human heart" with infixed "eye-lash"-death symbol20. I have tried to assign to T 568 the Quiche/Cakchiquel expression k'ux, "heart, breast, spirit", but I am not convinced of such a reading21. Whereas the glyph 61.756[568] refers generally to "human sacrifice by behead ing", another glyph for "human sacrifice by extracting the heart" should be men tioned, which appears frequently in the Chich'en Itza inscriptions: 669a.604-586:25.178, kab.ku-muc.cal.el. "god's hand (= sacrificial knife) - remov ing/extracting (el) with force (cal) the hidden one (muc) [the heart]". "Heart sac rifices" are depicted in Codex Dresden 3 and on Piedras Negras Stelae 11 and 14 (bottom). On Stela 14 the extracted heart is completely "cross-hatched" (cf. Tozzer Fig. 13 The "batdemon", Codex Fejervary-Mayer 41 19 T 568 or T 568v corresponds to Landa's second L (Tozzer 1941:170). If these two graphemes denote basically the same, the expression attributed to them should start with L. 20 Thompson's "eyelash "-infix of T 568 is affix T 27, the inverted T 25. One could consider a reading T 27 = kup, "cortar sin golpe con cuchillo o pedernal" (Yucatec). Barthel suggested a reading puz, "slice, cut, sacrifice" (Quiche^. 21 In Yucatec and the Cholan languages kux means'' eat or bite (hard things); pain; hate, love". The primary meaning of kux seems to be "eat, bite", a meaning which is found also in the Quichean languages. The underlying meaning "sacrifice" of T 568 cannot be reconciled with the last-mentioned meanings of the term kux.</page><page sequence="29">?Bats" in the Usumacinta-Valley 1975: Fig. 389b), and therefore might correspond th T 586. The translation of 669.604, first suggested by Barthel (1964), is proven by the variant 501:25:112 - 586:25.178, Monjas Lintel la (I. Graham 1977). The compound 501:25:112 can be translated as nab.cay.tok, "besmeared death-bringing flintknife". By making use of my alternative reading 586/602 = kul one could interpret the compound 586:25:178 also as/cui.cay.ei, "the divine death/the death in front of the idols comes forth". The compound 586:25, kuLcayl, could correspond to the Nahuatl teomicque, "captivos sac rificadosy muertos antelosidolos" (sing, teomicqui; miqui = morir; teotl = dios) (Molina). The combining of 604, ku, with 586, kul?, in a single glyphic compound is not completely satisfac tory. (h) Piedras Negras Lintel 1 (Fig. 14). A bound victim, entitled 12.585a:77:140? directly above his head, is carved on the fragment of Piedras Negras Lintel 1. Behind his head the glyph 61.756[568] is visible, in front of him the following text is inscribed: 740.181:126, poc-ic.ah?, "washing the lord?" (for his forthcoming sacrifice) / 679a?.503:102, "the life/breath (503 = ik') is expiring (679a:102 = ch'en-bal)" I 12.585a:77:40?, name of victim? / 12.33.1016:23, xuU.pul.yum-aU, "it dies the offspring of the fathers". Note Yucatec: ch'enbal - cosa que esta a punto de cesar y de acabarse. The glyph 740.181:125 is used here in my opinion not as' 'birth'' glyph, but as reference to a ritual' 'wash ing", preparatory to the sacrifice indicated by glyph 61.756[568]. The last glyph could also re fer to the heavenly realm of the ancestors, the place where the dead victim is supposed to go. The many recordings of this "sacrifice" at Piedras Negras attest to its great importance for that city. Fig. 14 Piedras Negras Lintel 1 (photogr. by H. Burger, courtesy of Pea body Museum, Harvard Univer sity)</page><page sequence="30">30 Dieter Dutting (i) Panel with "lady in ceremonial robes" from Piedras Negrasf?). This panel from the Cleveland Museum of Art (Hawley 1963:50) portrays a richly dressed lady who holds on her right hand a god K-manikin figure which cor responds to the canhel-insignia, the god K-manikin scepter, a symbol of "royal des cent". Two short texts of four glyphs each accompany her. Both start with the glyph for "human sacrifice by beheading", and end with the "name of the victim"(?): (1) 61.756[568] / 544:116.?:142 / 503?.102 / 12.585a:77:140; (2) 61.756[568] / I.23:565a / 45.? / 12.585a:77:140. The main text is partly destroyed. Of the readable part the end of the inscription is of interest for us (Fig. 15): C4 1000.672:585a, "she (1000) who gives (672 = kub?) the awakening / coming to life or covering [with plants] (585a = pix)" / D4 1:526:246, u.cab.may-ih, "his offering to the earth" - 12:126:508, "finishes (12 = xui?) Ah Chic (Lord Pizote?)" / C5 89:756a:74, tem.zutz'.man, "it appeases the clouds which pass by" - 630:683[178], tzen.kal-el, "the sustaining principal" / D5 604.59:502, ku.ti.nup?, "the divine one is at the place of joining/marriage", or "nest for joining/marriage" C6 10.10. (distance number) / D6a 1:44:563b: 142, u. lem.nutz?.om, "its account is joined with"? / D6b-D7 4 Ahau 13 Ceh (9.18.5.0.0) / 4.v:528:116, "five rainy seasons/years marched along (4 = xan-)". For a previous account of this text see Dutting (1972:230). There I interpreted T 502 (= 501 [533]) as tz'ac, "cure, medicine; complete". This reading is still a good alternative. Another translation of the passage D4-D5 could be: "his (1) offering (246) to the earth (526) / the one with the staff (12 = xol?), Ah Chic (126:508) / raised upon the dais (89 = tern) is Fig. 15 Panel from Piedras Negras?, Cleve land Museum of Art, glyphs C4?D7</page><page sequence="31">?Bats" in the Usumacinta-Valley 31 the bat (756a = zotz') who passes by (74 =man/mal) I the sustaining (630) principal (683[178]) / the divine one (604) is at the place (59) of joining/marriage". I discuss the readings 502 = nup/nup', and 563b = nutz/nutz' in a forthcoming paper. Glyph C4 probably addresses the earth goddess to whom the offering (a human sacrifice by beheading?; see section 1) is made. The lady portrayed on the panel may be this goddess. With respect to Ah Chic one should note that Gucumatz, the Quiche Kukulcan, was termed Pi zote (Tozzer 1941:157). (j) Kund-Lacanhd Lintel 1 (Fig. 16). On Kuna-Lacanha Lintel 1, dated 9.15.15.0.0 9 Ahau 18 Xul (cf. Dfitting 1970), "bats" are mentioned twice.In the first part of the inscription the reference to a "blind-folding Jaguar", 60c:751:142, is followed by the reference to a "bat", 756[228?]. Both glyphs could be termini for "sacrificers": Dl 12.58:580, xol?.zac.bol, "the one with the staff, Zac-Bol" / C2 188.1040[520], "if rises the star (188.140 = le.tzek = letz.ek?), the punisher? (520 = ze/tze)" I D2 229.23:585a, ak.al.pix, "new heavy covering [with plants]", or "new offspring awakens/comes to life" / C3 93.672:74, "smoke/honor is given and spreads (74 = man)"?22 / D3 1:630-181, u.tzen,iq, "his bearing the sustenance" / C4 60c:751:142, kax-uich?.balam, "blindfolding? jaguar" / D4 168a:87 or 197.512a.130, "ruler (168a-130) of the captives? (87/197.512a)" / C5 756[228?], zotz .ac, "the bat with the grass"? / D5 12.79:145b, "it dies/ends (12 = xul?) 79:145b". Fig. 16 Kuna-Lacanha Lintel 1, the glyphic text (drawing by Michael D. Coe) 22 Following Barthel I interpreted affix 93 as "smoke prefix" with possible value zik', "smoke; shout, cry, invoke, call" (Quiche/Cakchiquel). I doubt this reading now, since zik' means primarily "cigar, cigarette" in the Mayan languages, a mean ing not to reconcile with the formal aspects of T 93. Perhaps T 93 refers to "something sparkling", and not to a "smoking ob ject" .For main sign 672 I consider a reading kub, "encomendar, entregar, ofrecer, dedicar" (Yucatec). This "hand" is disting uished by three circles, which probably can be related to the "three stones" of the koben, the "hearth" of the Maya. T 74 probably denotes man/mal, "pass by; spread". A metaphorical relationship of T 93 to "honor/fame" is likely.</page><page sequence="32">32 Dieter Diitting I understand glyph Dl as name of a lord or deity. One could consider also a translation "finished is (12 = xul) the payment (580 = bol) for the light/dawn (58 = zac)". With respect to glyph C2 note Choi: letsel = subir, ascender; ec' = estrella. Chorti: lets = a going up, a climb ing up. Yucatec: ek = estrella; ze = maltratar con golpes, cozes, azotes; tzeec, tah - castigar o corregir23. Glyph D4 resembles the emblem glyph of Bonampak (sections a, b), but I doubt that the jaguar glyph refers to a "lord of Bonampak". The bat glyph in C5 probably has T 228, ac, infix ed. The ac-grass was pulled trough the pierced tongue or penis in self-castigation, and there fore could be the symbol of a "sacrificer". T 145b (tzatz?) is the "skein"-affix of the Chich'en Itza inscriptions. The lintel depicts a bearded man who is holding a huge "ceremonial bar", ter minating on both sides in the head of god K. This holding of the ceremonial bar - in my opinion a symbol of "life, rebirth" - might have been thought to evoke the re newal, the creative forces of the earth, "the covering of the earth with plants", the "coming to life of human offspring" (glyph D2). The second reference to the bat 756[228?], the "sacrificer", is found in the last part of the inscription: L2-K3 (9.15.11.17.3) 4 Akbal 16 Xul / L3 644b.534:88-125, "the seating (644 = chum/cum) of the esteemed one (534 = coh?) is the message (88-125 = taq-ah?)" I K4 59.630-181:?, ti.tzen-iq..., "for bearing the sustenance" / L4 12.58:580, xoU.zac.bol "the one with the staff, Zac-Bol" / K5 188.1040[520], "it rises the star (188.1040 = le.tzek = letz.ek?), the punisher? (520 = ze/tze)" I L5 229.23:585a, ak.al.pix, "new heavy covering [with plants]", or "new offspring awakens/comes to life" / K6 93.672:74, "smoke/honor is given and spreads"? / L6 12.756[228?], xui&lt;?.zorz'.ac?, "death of the bat with the grass"?. I revise my translation of the small incised text in front of the ceremonial bar car rier as follows (cf. Diitting 1976:80): M1,N1 13 Men 18 Yaxkin (9.14.5.11.15)? / M2 740:126.181, poc-ah-ic, "being washed is [at birth]" / N2,M3 1000.23, ix.al, "the lady's child" / 1030c, title of child N3 19.565a:136, "shading/protecting (19 = muh) the beloved/bought (565a = lok?) gift (136 = may)". (k) El Cayo Lintel 1. On El Cayo Lintel 1 and on the Tablet of the Slaves, Palenque, the expression chac.zotz', "great/red/bloody bat", 109:756a, appears as name of a historical person. Red is the color of the beheading bat-demon in Codex Vaticanus B 24 who is distinguished as "sacrificer" by "knots" on his arms (cf. Diitting 1965). 23 Previously I considered a reading tzec/tzeec of T 520 (Dutting 1976:73). A reading 520 = ze/tze seems to me more likely now. I do not conclude from the Tzec glyph 25:520:130 and the name Cazeu of this month that suffix 130 stands for the value u(a)/wa, as proposed by Lounsbury. The second evidence cited by Lounsbury for such an assignment is the "cacao" glyph 25:25:130 of the Codex Dresden. As counterargument I refer to the glyph 551:130 of the month Pop, which I have related to the old Pokom name Kanhalam of this month (Dutting 1972:233). Grapheme 551 consists of the elements T 281, kan,' 'preci ous, desired", and 664, hal, "braid, weave", together kan-hal. Halam means "change" in Pocomchi/Cakchiquel, the whole name kan-halam therefore "change of the desired one", the year, which starts with the month Pop. According to this recon struction of the Pop glyph one could assign the value am to suffix 130, if one matches every syllable of the old, probably dis torted month name with an element of the glyph. In my opinion only the two initial syllables of the names can be matched safely with elements of the glyphs. I follow Knorozov in assigning to affix 130 the values aan/ahan/yan, and interpret the cacao-glyphs as "cacao (25:25 = ca-ca) is there (130 = yan)".</page><page sequence="33">lfBats" in the Usumacinta-Valley 33 The inscription of El Cayo Lintel 1 (Maler 1901-03: Plate 35) is so much de stroyed by weathering that only parts of the text are intelligible. The text starts with an IS-dater the birth date of a lord named 12.109:756a. A1-B9 9.16.0.2.16 6 Cib 9 Mol / A10 740:126.181, poc-ah-ic, "being washed is [at birth]" / B10 758[110], pay-tan, "the first one"? / All IV.586 or 602:23?.25F can.muc.yal? .calf B11-B13 533, ahau, "the lord" / (four partly destroyed glyphs) / A14 1000.769?:585a, "she (1000) who commands? (585a = pix) those in the cave [of origin] (769 = pec?)" / B14 1.533:24, yahaulil, "his reign" / A15 758.110:539, uaytan.balam-ahau, "magician - jaguar lord" / B15 12.109:756a, xol.chac.zotz', "the one with the staff, the great/ red bat", or xulchac.zotz', "it dies/descends to hell the great/red bat". The "birth glyph" (A10) is followed by the title 758 [110], translated by me as uay-tan, "magician" putting 1974:7), or pay-tan, "the first one" (Lacandon: pdytan = primero, antes). A title paytan could refer to a firstborn son. I am convinced that this title addresses the Chac Zotz' (B15). The translation of glyph A14 makes use of Quiche/Cakchiquel pixa = mandato, orden; ordenar, mandar; peg = cueva, caverna. The reading 769 = pec was suggested by Barthel. On the basis of the Cholan languages one could translate also "she (1000) who awakens (585a = pix) those in the cave (769 = ch'en?)", but the value ch'en is already occupied by grapheme 679 (Barthel 1964). The rationale behind the reading 769, "cave" (of origin), comes from the sides of Copan Stela N. There the two glyph columns rest in grapheme 769, opened on its top. Ancestors are seated above, one on each side. In E3-G3 of El Cayo Lintel 1 the "inauguration" of the lord Chac Zotz', at the age of 12, is recorded: E3,F3 (9.16.12.14.10) 5 Oc 3 Yaxkin (?) / E4 684a, hok.kal, "it emerges/appears the enclosed one" / F4 59.630-181[202]:24, "for (59) bearing (181 = fg?) the sustenance (630 = tzen), the hidden one (202-24 = muc-il?)"

Thompson (1962) wrongly transcribed the glyph in H2 as 12.58:742. The glyphs H2/G3 are repeated in N14/M15. Particularly the glyph 12.58:755 in N14 makes it clear that the main sign is the head of a "spider-monkey", maax in Yucatec/Manche Chol/Chorti/Tzotzil/Kekchi, and not T 742, as it appears on Bonampak Stela 1, LI. (1) Tablet of the Slaves, Palenque (Fig. 17). The Tablet of the Slaves, Palenque, records events in the life of a lord named Chac Zotz', "great/red/bloody bat". Unlike the names of other Palenque lords this name is never preceded by the title mah.kina(l), 74.184, of the Palenque rulers, and nowhere followed by a Palenque emblem glyph. This together with the negative content of the inscription could indicate that this Chac Zotz' is a stranger in the lineage of the Palenque lords. At the beginning of the text the event glyphs precede their particular dates:</page><page sequence="34">34 Dieter Dutting A4 740:246, poc.mayih, "washing [at birth] the gift" - 69:756a, cut?.zotz', "the bat whitened with chalk"?

Comments on the text. A4 Barthel interprets T 69, formally representing "downs", as "downs of an eagle (cot)", and considers a reading 69 = cut, "chalk, whitened with chalk" (Yucatec). In Kekchi we find cutan, "day, light, time"; cutanoc', "dawn". Alternatively the glyph could denote "the bat covered with downs". Captives selected for sacrifice were whitened with chalk and covered with (white) downs by the Aztecs. Eventually T 69 could denote both, "whitening with chalk" and "covering with downs". The bat-demon of Codex-Fejervary-Mayer 41 (Fig. 13) wears a "down" in his headdress. A5 "Inauguration clauses" of this type are discussed in Dutting (1978b). The "punishment with the cord" is presented in Codex Madrid 19. There a long cord passes through the phalli of five deities who are arranged in a world direction scheme. B5 The name glyph of this lord is given in other texts as 74.184. 229:528:140-238.244:522 (e.g. Palenque, Orator Tablet). I interpret T 522 now as uk, "drink", and ok, "weep, mourn". C2 I interpret graphemes 121/617a as mek, "embrace" (Yucatec/Chol/ChoruV Kekchi/Jacaltec), "heat" (Quiche/Cakchiquel/Mam). One meaning of 713a, lah, in Yucatec is "to slap with the open hand". One could translate also "the glorious one (122) has sent the cord [for punishment] (60a), the all-embracer (121-713a)". C3-E1 The compound 190-25 (= T333) is best interpreted with T25 = cal, "garganta, cuello", and T 190 = ch'ac, "cortar con golpe de hacha" (Yucatec), giving together "cutting the neck", "beheading". While I operated with the reading 190 = bat (axe)/ pat (form, shape, invent), Barthel suggested to interpret T 190 in the compound 190-25 as "action with the axe", ch'ac. A "be heading" as "offering (mayih) to the earth" reminds at the "beheading of the human victim at the Ochpaniztli festival, celebrated by the Aztecs in the 11th</page><page sequence="36">36 Dieter Dutting month in honor of the earth goddess Teteo innan (Sahagun, Florentine Codex, Book 2, ch. 30). Chac Zotz' plays here the same role in human sacrifice by be heading as the bat demon in C. Vaticanus B 24 or C. Fejervary-Mayer 41. E2 The "capture glyph" 87.532:25.181 seems to be a verbal substan tive consisting of a noun 87.532 = 5f5[528]-87 = chuc-cul-te, "captive" (Yucatec), and the verbalizer 25.181 which denotes something like "making" (one could think at the Yucatec ca-ah,' 'hacer, suceder, estar'', but such a reading cannot be reconciled with Barthel's 181 = iq,ic. It would work with Knorozov's andKelley's 181 = ah, but since I assign the value ah toT 126/1251 am not able to accept a reading 181 = ah). T 528 is used in this capture glyph with its secondary value cul (cf. Dutting 1976:107). To read T 25 alone as caah/cah seems to me un likely now. Gl The glyph 177.507:140? could also denote "songs/singing (507 = kay) come(s) down (177 = cub)". The readings 177 = cub and 507 = kay were suggested by Barthel. The text reveals that Chac Zotz' is not only concerned with "the offering to the earth", the sacrifice of humans by beheading, and with the "capture and killing of deers", but also with the results of these sacrifices, the "gathering of merchandise" and the "bearing of sustenance/food". The mythical qualities of the "bat demon" are attributed here to a historical person named Chac Zotz', a ruler of Palenque, pos sibly of foreign descent. The negative content of the text is carried on by the iconography of the Tablet of the Slaves which shows a lord seated on two bound captives. He is offered a helmet by a youthful man on his right who is seated on a crouched underworld deity with squint eye and T 121 markings on the body. On the left of the lord a woman, seated on a dead deer with the ear of rabbit24, offers him a war-shield of the type 624[537v], crowned by the longnosed skull of the dead god K(?). I understand the 537v-element, integrated into the shield (stretched human face skin according to Moises Morales), as tza, "pleito, pleitear, estorbar, inquietar" (Yuc). Note also Quiche: tza = frighten, war, opposition, enemy, enmity. The helmet and the shield can be regarded as insignia of rulership. Text referring to the male(?) attendant at the right of the lord (II-Kl): 59.67:616?:23 / 74:793a, "the lord (74 = mah) of Palenque (793a)" / 758:110, pay-tan, "the first one", or uay-tan, "the magician". Text referring to the female attendant at the left of the lord (L1-L3): 1000.102:592:117, ix.bal.lup-bil?, "she the hidden one who draws water for the plants" / 74:565a, mah.lok, "the lord, the beloved one" / 758:110, pay-tan, "the first one", or uay-tan, "the magician". At Quirigua the compound 190:25 is a constituent of an important event glyph which always follows the date 6 Cimi 4 Tzec. I agree with Marcus (1976:135) who suggested that this date refers to a successful raid of the Quirigua lord Two-Armed Sky,122:175:561-1030i, on Copan resulting in the hegemony of Quirigua over Co pan. The name glyph of the killed Copan lord is XVIII:757- 1030a: 178 (Copan Stela A, C10-D10). On Quirigua Stela E (West) this event is referred to by the clause (A13b, A14a): 6 Cimi 4 Tzec (9.15.6.14.6) / 513:190:25.757:136, tzic.ch'ac-cal.bah.may?, "the esteemed one's beheading, the first one's annihilation"25 / XVIII.l:757?:1030d, name of Copan lord. 24 A "deer with the ear of a rabbit" could metaphorically refer to a "fugitive". Of a fugitive is said by Sahagun (Book 6, ch. 43, p. 253): "Thou hast made thyself into a rabbit; thou hast made thyself into a deer. Thou hast made thyself a fugitive; thou hast hardened thyself. Thou hast taken to the road of the rabbit, the road of the deer." 25 Manche Choi: mayilez = acabar de. Pocomchi (Stoll): may = aufhoren. Pocomchi (Zuhiga): may = abrogar, aniqui lar, anular.

I follow Barthel (1966:111) in interpreting the main sign T 756[528] of the Copan emblem glyph (Fig. 12b) as zutz'.haab, "rain-cloud" (cf. Quiche, Cakchiquel, Pocomchi). A compound like Quirigua Stela F, B9, I unterstand as follows: 95:756[528].200:747a, "black (95 = [k]ek) circulating (200 = cu-cu) rain-clouds (756[528] = zutz'.haab) [brings] the vulture (747 = kuch)". (m) Yaxchilan Lintel 10 (Fig. 18). The great inscription of Yaxchilan Lintel 10 is the latest and one of the most challenging texts of this site. The lords mentioned in this text are members of a moo (macaw)-lineage or family which ruled Yaxchilan at the end of the classic period. A "bat" is mentioned only once in a "capture clause" where he probably functions as "captor" and "sacrificer". I pass over the initial glyphs of this text: A6a 544:12, kin.xul?, "the sun descends into the underworld/dies" (metaphor for a dying ruler?) / A6b 58:245:624[533v], zac.chay.pacal.ahau?, "white knife - the lord's recompense"? / B6a 1:108.764, u... chan, "his...snake" / B6b 122.563a:744b:53, kak.zi'.moo-..., (name of lord) / ABC D E F Fig. 18 Yaxchilan Lintel 10 (drawing by Ian Graham)</page><page sequence="38">38 Dieter Dutting A7a 12:XVI:570[109?]r xul?.uac-lahun.chac.baac, "death of numerous [persons], shedding of red[blood]"?

The sacrificial knife is termed "white knife" (zaqi tok) in the Popol Vuh (Edmonson 1971:115). T 624, the "shield" grapheme, can be translated as paced or chimed, "shield" (Yuc). Pac-al can also refer to "that which is returned", to the "recompense" in Yucatec. The interpre tation of A7b is very tentative. Baac-chac could also mean "shedding of rain". The "capture" clause B7/A8 could-besides indicating a historical capture event-refer to the death of a "sun-macaw", to the end of a period of drought, to the arising of 756a, zutz', "clouds". (A8b). Graphemes like that of the "macaw" and the "bat" are well suited to create an ambiguity of meaning which operates on two levels, the historical and natural one. Glyph B8 is unreadable, but then the text continues: Cl 89?:534:670, "setting in order (670 = tzol) the raising upon the dais/seat (89:534 = tem-ei?)? / 168?:?: 178 / Dla 60b:757, "the first one (757 = bah?) is doing penitence (60b = kax)'l I Dlb 58:751:12?, zac.balam,xul?f "the bright Balam descends into the underworld/dies" / C2a 671[544]:116, chi-kin, "[in the] west" / C2b 53:173:1040, "the place (53) where the dying (1040) never ends (173 = nuutz'?)", or "the place of completion (173) and death (1040)" / D2 12:281:23-501:23:25, "it descends into the underworld (12 = xul?) the star/the glorious one (281:23 = kan-al) - the powerful (25 = col?) firstborn (501:23 = nab[e]yal?)"

Glyphs Cl?Dla refer to a lord's seating, accession to power. It follows a passage (Dlb-D3) which probably refers to the descent of a dying lord into the underworld. With rex pect to glyph D2 note Quiche/Cakchiquel: q'anal = glory, splendor. Tzotzil/Chuj/Tojolabal: k'anal = star26. Barthel (1978) extends the reading 501:23 = nab.al to the Nahuatl derived Quiche expression naual, "magician". In a context of human sacrifice 501:23.25, nab-al.cal, could also denote "the one with the besmeared neck". A goddess (the Great Goddess of Yaxchilan?) seems to be addressed in the fol lowing passage D4-D6, which starts with the glyph referring to the "sacred bundle or dowry", probably presented by her to the newly inaugurated king in her "sacred marriage" with him: D4a l:60b:757, u.kax.bah/wah?, "her bound first things/her bundle with bread" / D4b 1:1:606:23, u.hun.cux-t-al?, "her unique life" / C5-D5a V:785?:? / 1000:582, ix.mol/mul, "she who collects [blood?]", or "she of the mounds/pyramids" / 1000:582, ix.mol/mul I 26 One could translate the compound 12:281:23, xul?.kan-al, also as "it tumbles down headlong the star".

Glyphs B6b and C7b name a Yaxchilan lord as "the Moo-... who burns (kak) the firewood (zi')", or "the Moo-... whose gift (zi) is the fire (kak)". The compound 744b:53 reminds at a name like Mo-Chel, known from postclassic Yucatan (Roys 1933:195). T 582 not only denotes mol, "gather, heap, pile" putting 1976:103), but also mul, "cerro natural, monton" (Yucatec), or "sin" (Cholan languages). The "descent of the goddess into the underworld" (D6b) seems to initiate the start of the rainy season which commences with the'1 disappearance of the Pleiades'' (D8b) on a day 5 Oc 18 Zotz': D7 l:IV:683a:53, u.can.kal..., 24 days (DN 1.4) / 679a?:513:59, "silent is the count at" / C8-D8a (9.18.17.13.10) 5 Oc 18 Zotz' (G9) / D8b 207:671:122, "the Pleiades (207 = rzab) are eaten (671 = chij) by the fiery one?

The disappearance of the Pleiades probably signalled to the classic Maya the coming of the rainy season. Comparable glyphs appear in the Codex Dresden and Codex Madrid (Diit ting 1976:50; 1978a). In the present text the coming of the rain is described by the glyphs F1-F2. The "water" compound 516b[281] (E2b) could also be transcribed as 513[281]. Graphemes 513 and 516b I interpret as tzic and noh- or hach-tzic, respectively (Dutting 1976: 50/64), but in combination with T 281 (kan, "desired, precious") they probably function as "water-symbol". The text continues with three lordly titles and a glyph referring to an "offering to the earth": E3b 16?:168a:743:130, "ruler (168a-130) of the green (16 = yaxj turtles (743 = ac)" I F3a 126:168a:513:130, "he (126 = ah) the honorable (513 = rzic) ruler (168a-130)" / F3b 245:168b:513?:130, "knife (245 = ta/chay?) of the honorable (513 = rzic) lord (168b-130)" / E4a 1:526:246, u.cab.mayih, "his offering to the earth" / E4b 1:108:764, u... chan, "his... snake" / F4a 229.568:744b, ak.lom?.moo, (name of victim) / F4b 32:168a:562, "the offspring (32) of the lords of Yaxchilan".</page><page sequence="40">40 Dieter Diitting The "offering to the earth" in E4a is preceded by a lordly title with the "knife" prefix 245. This is another argument for regarding this "offering" as "human sac rifice". The victim seems to be a Yaxchilan lord named 229.568:744b.

The name glyphs 229.568:744b (F4a) and 12.568-744b:53 (F8) probably refer to the same lord of Yaxchilan. Both are preceded by 1.108:764, which indicates that a captive's name is fol lowing. The compounds 229.568 (ak.lom?) and 12.568 (xol/xul.lom?) are directly comparable. A reading ah of T 229 and T 12 (see section a) would fit nicely here. The insertion of 568 (lorn?, "piercing") might indicate that the lord is the "victim who is pierced". Grapheme 173, either nuutz' or utz/otz, is discussed by me in a forthcoming paper. (n) Graphemes T 229 and T 12. In this section I present a more detailled discussion of graphemes T 12 and T229. In the foregoing examples were given for the exchange of T 12 and T 229 in names and titles of lords. Three possible explanations of such a substitution come into mind: 1) both graphemes correspond to the same phonetic value, as for instance to the value ah, assigned by Knorozov (1967:81) to T 12; 2) they correspond to differ ent phonetic values with at least one identical meaning; 3) they correspond to dif ferent phonetic values which are complementary in meaning. For formal reasons I do not think that possibility 1 is fulfilled. The mentioned name glyphs with initial T 12 suggest that T 12 (and likewise T 229) stands outside of the actual name, and that either possibility 2 or 3 must be correct. The solution suggested previously by me (Diitting 1974/76) is that these graphemes are complementary in meaning, that T 229 corresponds to a value ak/aak, "new, fresh", and T 12 to a value tz'oc, "end, death".</page><page sequence="41">?Bats" in the Usumacinta-Valley 41 Grapheme T 229. Formally T 229 comes very close to Landa's third A, but it is not easily distin guishable from affix 228. Of the three A graphemes given by Landa (Tozzer 1941:170) the first is T 743, the second T 238, the third T 228 or 229. T 228 substitutes in the Chich'en Itza inscriptions for T 743, the head of the "turtle", called ac in the Maya languages. Barthel suggested to extend this reading T 743 = ac to T 228, which could denote ac, "grass". To account for the relationship of T 228, T 229 and Landa's third A I considered a reading T 229 = ak/aak, "new, fresh" (Dutting 1972). In the Cholan languages this ak is changed to ac', in contrast to ak, "tongue", which re mains ak. Among the dislocated stucco glyphs of Temple 18, Palenque, the following var iants occur (Fernandez 1954: No's. 26 and 31): 1010b.743[528]:534, "time (1010b = kin) of setting in (743 = ac) the rainy season (528 = haab), the beloved one (534 = coh?)"; 1010a.229:528:534, "time (1010a = kin) of the new (229 = ak) rainy season (528), the beloved one (534)". Note Yucatec: ak/aak = cosa fresca, tierna o verde, reciente, humedo; ak yaabil = invier no, tiempo de aguas-, accunah = asentar; actal = asentarse. Kekchi/Pocomchi/Quiche: ac' = nuevo. Grapheme T 12. Affix T 12 consists formally of the "death eye" - grapheme (T 13 = zat; Dutting 1974/76) attached to a "rod or bar". In early classic forms (Tikal Stela 31, F15, 1.573:12) only "the short hair of the death god's wig" (the element between the two death eyes of T 13) is added to the bar. The death gods in C. Dresden 13-19, and the god Q's in C. Madrid 50-54/85-86 wear a "death eye collar", which has the form of affix T 12 (cf. Thompson 1950:189). In C. Dresden 39b (1st col.) the skirt of the old goddess O, who is poisoning the fields with floods of water, is held by a belt of the type T 12. To account for these formal aspects Thompson (1950) suggested a reading T 12 = hitz, Barthel (1963) a reading T 12 = tz'oc. Both terms mean "end, death" in Yucatec. Knorozov's (1967) reading T 12 = ah, "male prefix, agentive", is not in ac cordance with these formal aspects, and therefore is no serious alternative. I give two examples which strongly support the "end, death"-interpretation of affix T 12. Fig. 19 Tablet Temple of the Cross, Palenque, glyphs PI? Q3 (after A. P. Maudslay) The mythical section of the inscription on the Temple Cross-Tablet, Palenque A1-Q3), ends with the "accession" of the last mythical lord. The Palenque emblem glyph at the end bears the unusual suffix T 12 (Fig. 19):</page><page sequence="42">42 Dieter Dutting PI 679a.50?:522?:713, "finished is (679a = ch'en[i]) the dawning (50 = 58[582] = zac.mol, "gathering light") which ends (713 = lah) the mourning (522 = ok/uk?)"

Inauguration clauses of the type Pl/Ql are discussed in Dutting (1978b) to gether with my readings T 522 = ok/uk, T 89 and T 92 = temften(el). For T 757 = bah see Dutting (1976). The text continues with the genealogy of historical rulers who preceded the current Palenque lord Chan-Bahlum, 74.184.762:142, in the ruler ship of Palenque (P4-U17). In the "deer hunt" almanacs Codex Madrid 40-42 the glyphs 12.671 and 12.671:136 seem to refer to "the dead (12 = xui?) deer (671 = chij-, 671:136 = chij may)"-, chij and chijmay are Cholan (Chontalan) words for "deer". One of the constraints any reading of T 12 must fulfil is its occurrence in Codex Dresden 68b (2nd col.). There the rain god Chac copulates with the moon goddess Ix Chel (Fig. 20). Text above: 238.667:23, a(t).em-al, "your descent" / 12.238.552[95]:23, glyph referring to the "coition" / 668.103, Chac / 115.734:116 / 283:563b.104:731, "joining (563b = nutz or nup?) the bodies (183 = bak-) ..."

Fig. 20 Codex Dresden 68b, second col.</page><page sequence="43">,,Bats" in the Usumacinta-Valley 43 To explain the "coition glyph", Barthel (1977) extended his reading T 12 = rz'oc to the value tzuc, and suggested a reading tzuc-ach, "lascivious" (Yucatec), of 12.238. According to him the whole glyph could denote tzuc-ach.kat-al, "lascivious petitioner/bridegroom" (T 552 = kat, "ask"). , I do not think one grapheme can be used for the words rz'oc and tzuc. Instead I prefer a reading T 12 =xul/xol. In Yucatec xol means "staff; to stick something into the ground"; xul is another term for "end, finish, death", but could also mean "dig ging-stick". The introduction of the rain god's phallus into the vagina of the moon goddess can be compared with "the pushing of the digging-stick (12 = xol/xul?) into the ground of the earth". The glyph 12.238.552[95]:23 therefore could denote "it in troduces the digging-stick/(phallus) (12 = xol/xul?) your (238 = a[r]) bridegroom (552:23 = kat-al, "the one who asks")". Alternatively affix 238, at/ach?, could refer to the "phallus", and T 12, xol?, indicate its "pushing" into the vagina of the moon goddess. Finally one could interpret T 12 with the Yucatec termxol.pix, "kneeling'', the position taken by Chac in the coition. Grapheme T 563b I read tentatively as nutz/nutz'?. Note Yucatec: nutz, ah = encajar una cosa en otra y juntar encajando; nuutzul = encajarse o juntarse. Choi: huts = unir. Quiche: nutz = light a fire. In case T 173 corresponds to the value nutz', a reading 563b = nup/nup' could be considered. With respect to T 12 = xul/xol note the following expressions. Yucatec: xul = fin, cabo, paradero, termino, limite; u.xul.cuxtal = el fin de la vida; xul, ah = fenecer, acabar, dar cabo y fin de alguna cosa; xul = palo con que siembran los indios; xul/xulum = liza, pescado; xulel = acabarse; xol/xolte/xolche =baculo, bordon, estaca; xolcinah = afirmar una cosa en otra; xoi tah = afirmarse sobre algo, hincarse de rodillas; xol.pix = arodillarse, hincarse de rodillas; x ulab = especie dehormigas que atacanlas colmenas.

With respect to the use of the Yucatec term xul,'' end'', the following passages of the Book of Chilam Balam of Chumayel (Roys 1933) are of interest: p.l9C: "Four four-hundreds of years and fifteen score years was the end of their lives (can bak hab u xul u cuxtalob catac holhun kal hab yan); then came the end of their lives (cataci tu xul u cuxtalob), because they knew the measure of their days (tumen yohelob u ppiz kinob tubaob)." p.95C: "A parching whirlwind storm is the charge of the katun (kakal mozon chac u cuch ka tun).

Among the day prognostications in the Codex Perez (Solis Alcala, 1949) we find (cf. Thompson 1950:301): p. 118: 1 Men, lob, "bad" - u lob chetun cimil u xule, "bad sudden death comes to an end", p.276: 1 Hix, lob, "bad"-licil u cimil uinicob u xul ti, "in which the death of men comes to an end". The Lacandon use the term xul in an expression for the destruction of the world (Bruce 1974:149): Hachakyum uxul-ik tan, "Hachakyum su acabar-lo delante (de struir el mundo)". With respect to the first mentioned prognostic of the Codex Perez I refer to Codex Dresden 23c (2nd col.) where the death god with T 12-collar is shown as bridgeroom of the moon goddess Ix Chel.

The T 12 (death eye)-collar is worn not only by underworld deities in the Codices, but also by similar figures of late-classic pottery scenes. On Grolier Vase No. 46 (M.Coe 1973:101) the death god (1st figure) wears a T 12-collar. The front part of this collar is bent down by the weight of a pendant consisting of an Akbal vessel with death eyes attached to it.A death eye is added also to the raised right hand of the death god which has the form of T 713a, lah,' 'terminate''. On the Vase of the Seven Gods (Grolier No. 49; M.Coe 1973:107) (Fig. 21) the underworld monster above the throne seat of god L, on Grolier Vase No. 38 (M.Coe 1973:85) two under world jaguars and one other feline are decorated with T 12-collars. In C. Dresden 18c (2nd col.) the moon goddess Ix Chel carries on her back the kaz-demon, the symbol of "evil", a skeletal figure with a T 648 (kaz)-headandaT 12 (xul)-collar. Its head and collar together could denote kaz.xul, "evil end/death". Text above: 19.62, mu-hul, "the gift/dowry" / 1.528:87.601, u.haab.te-cuch, "her burden of the year" / 10.648:25,. ..kaz.cal, "... evil affecting the neck"? (= behead ing?) / 171.1026.103, Ix Chel. In C. Dresden 20a (2nd col.) the goddess holds the kaz-demon on her lap. Again the T 648 (&amp;az)-head is set directly onto the T 12 (xui) collar (Fig. 22). Fig. 22 Codex Dresden 20ar second col. In Codex Dresden 2a a headless man (god CH?) is depicted with arms bound behind his back. He wears a T 12 (death eye)-collar and has death markings on his body. One hand holds a "fan", ual in most Maya languages. The "fan", an insignia of lordship, could also designate its bearer as "enemy"; cf. Yucatec: ah ual = enemigo capital que mata y destruye; cosa muy dahosa y perniciosa. The T 12 (xuJ)-collar and the "fan" together therefore could denote "end/death of the enemy". The text above reads: 190.758[504], bat.pay "provocation to fighting", or bat.uay, "fighting and poisoning" / 715.91:671, pa.tem.chij, "the destruction of the bench/dais/altar is the promise"? / 1.1059, (god CH) / 15.736:140, ciz?.tzek-elf "stinking [place of] skulls". With respect to Knorozov's T 715 = pa note Yucatec: paa, ah = quebrar, des hacer cosas, derribar casas; paa - cerra de pared, tierra o piedras. I do not extend this reading to T 586. 27 the T 25-infix of T 267 could indicate that the death bat cuts the "neck" (25 = cal).</page><page sequence="46">46 Dieter Dutting Particular interesting are words of the Quichean languages based on the stem xul- which denote a "descending, coming down (headlong)". In Book 6 of Sahagun's Florentine Codex (Dibble and Anderson 1969:21) the Aztec death god is termed Mictlan tecutli, Tzontemoc, Cuezalli, "el dios del infierno, aquel que descendio cabeza abajo, al fuego". Cuezali, "red arara feathers", are a symbol for "flames". The T 12- collar of the death god in the Codex Dresden probably can be related to Pocomchixuia, "infierno", Quiche/Cakchiquel/Kekchixul-, "descend (headlong)", and the Aztec title Tzontemoc, "the one who tumbles down headlong", of the death god. The principal idea behind the expression xul, "the tumbling down headlong into hell", is beautifully depicted on the famous Uaxactun polychrome plate (Fig. 23). In the lower part of the scene beneath the vaulted serpent body - the roof of the underworld (cf. Barthel 1965) - a dead victim tumbles headlong into the deepest hell. A lake of blood surrounds his head and upper part of body. Two underworld jaguars jump on him from above. The great black figure at the right is god L, the ruler of the underworld, the master of the jaguars. He holds a long staff or stick (xoJ), set into the lake of blood. Fig. 23 Uaxactun polychrome plate (after A. L. Smith 1932, Fig. 8) Complementary to the Quiche/Cakchiquel xulan-, "descent", is Quiche aqan- (aq'an-), "climb", Cakchiquel ak'an, "subir, ascender". T 229, ak, therefore could also denote "as cend". The proposed complementary relationship between T 12 and T 229 is substantiated by these expressions.</page><page sequence="47">?Bats" in the Usumacinta-Valley 47 Of great interest with respect to a reading T 12, xul, "end; descent", are the texts on the Blocks VII and VIII of the Hieroglyphic Stairway No. 2, Yaxchilan Structure 33. On both blocks "ball-players" face a big ball above a stepped half-pyramid, which symbolizes the ball-court. In the sphere of the ball a "bound captive tumbling down headlong" is carved besides a short text, which on Block VIII reads: 291.561:23, "it ends the rest (291 =xulub =xul.lub) there on high (caan-al)" 112.?, "(headlong) descent (12 = xizJ)..." / ?. Grapheme 291 I interpret as xulub, "cuerno de venado o de otro animal" (Yucatec, Choi, Tzotzil, etc.). On Block VII the text in the sphere starts: 1?.764? / 95?.671:136, ek.chij-may, "the star - the deer", or "the black deer" / 168b:291v.?:?. The "diving captive" might represent "defeated stars", swallowed by the sun, the ball. The symbol of these stars was the deer, termed chij-may in Choi.

The CR date "9 Kan end of (T 12) Xul" demonstrates clearly that T 12 is an "ending sign". The question arises how one can account for the glyph 758:116 (monuments), and 758:116 or 765b:116 (Codices) of the 6th monthXuJ. Previously I presented evi dence for interpreting T 758 in other compounds as uay/way, "sorcery; sleep", and</page><page sequence="48">48 Dieter Dutting pay, "skunk; call, invoke" (Dutting 1974). I proposed that the head 758 might repre sent several "wild animals" which functioned as "animal spirit companions" (the wayhel's of the Tzotziles). T 765a, b, on the other hand, represents the head of the "coyote", oq. The 6th month is termedXul only in Yucatec, perhaps because in older times the Haab started with the month Yaxkin ("new sun") and ended with the month Xul ("end"). It seems to me now that T758 in the glyph 758:116, as well as T765c (= 765[544]) and T 765d (=765[623])r could represent the "dog (758,765) who leads the sun (116, 544, 623) to the underworld", iheXolotl orXulotl of the Aztecs. The glyph T 765d is used as Kin variant in distance numbers. The infixed "crossed bones", T 623, can be understood as bac.kat = pacat, "vista, luz" (Yucatec) or bakat, "fear" (Cholti/Chontal). Xul is not given as term for "dog" in the Mayan dictionaries, but in Kekchi it is a general term for "animal". Also Thompson (1950:109) assumed that in the classic period xul "may have been a ritualistic word used only to describe the dog which led the sun to the underworld". The Yucatec Maya celebrated in the month Xul a festival called Chic.Kaban (= chichaban?, "festival of the pizote and branches", after R. Roys) in honor of Kukul can-Quetzalcoatl, whom the Aztecs regarded as twin brother of Xolotl. Tozzer (1941:157) notes that Gucumatz, the Quiche Kukulcan, was called Pizote. It is not known whether the month name Xul is derived from the Aztec Xolotl/Xulutl, or whether the name Xolotl was derived from the Maya wordxui. The possibility has to be considered that the "sun'' suffix or infix shifted the value of T 758 from way/pay to xul, and likewise that of T 765 from oq to xul. That means 758:116 and 765[544] could denote xul.kin, 765[623] xul.pacat. By introducing the Quiche/Cakchiquel xul-, "descend", one can translate xul.kin, "descent of the sun", andxui.pacaf, "des cent of the light" (related to the Yucatec pacat is the Quiche paqal, "high, eternal, il lustrious", paqah = raise). I do not think that these special (Nahuatl derived?) read ings contradict my assignment T 12 = xul/xol. Particular interesting are the compounds 573:12 and 573:25:12, which together with a pronominal prefix (1, 11, 204) constitute the "distance number introducing glyphs". Main sign T 573 could denote eitherhei or kex, but the chance is great that it corresponds to the value kex. The contraction of T 573, kex, and T 12, xol/xul, would give the expressions kexol/kexul. Note Yucatec: kexah, kexultah = trocar; kexul = trueca, recompensa; kexulan = sucesor. Manche Choi: quexe = trocar; quexba, quextul = trueque. Choi: k'exol = namesake, replace ment, exchange; k'ex, k'extan = change, exchange, revenge. Quiche/Cakchiquel: q'ex = cambio, trueque; q'exel = paga, satisfaccion. Proto-Maya: *k'es- ? exchange, change. One could translate: 1.573:12, u.kex.xul, "the change comes to an end", or u.kex.xol, "their exchanging the staff", or u.kexul/kexol, "his recompense", "their exchange". Furthermore 1.573:25:12, u.kex.cal.xul,' 'the change of the power comes to an end", or u.kex.cal.xol, "their changing the power of the staff"; 13.573:12, zat.kex.xol, "finished/over is the exchange of the staff".

The text in front of the younger lord reads: C1,C2 109?:1043:? / 16?.666[544]?:116 / C3 229.168b:683bvar, "a new (229 = ak) lord (168b) is the bearer (683b = ig?)" / C4 12.VII:570[109], xul.uuc.baac.chac, "finished is the seventh shedding of rain", or "death of seven [persons], shedding of red [blood]". The staffs of the two lords have three open windows which suggest that the inside is hol low. Hal elements are visible in the windows; they could indicate that these staffs are insignia of rulership. It is possible to read glyphs C3/C4 in conjunction: "a new (229) lord (168b) is the bearer (683b) of the staff/diggingstick (12 = xol/xul), seventh (VII) shedding (570) of rain (109)". On Yaxchilan Stela 11 (human side) the exchange of the same staffs between Shield-Jaguar (left) and Bird-Jaguar (right) at 12 Cib 19 Yaxkin is depicted. This ex change precedes Shield-Jaguar's death on (9.15.10.17.14) 6 Hix 12 Yaxkin by about a year and the inauguration of Bird-Jaguar, Shield-Jaguar's successor, at 11 Ahau 8 Tzec (9.16.1.0.0) by almost 11 years. The relevant text in front of Shield-Jaguar reads: Fig. 24 Yaxchilan Lintel 9 (drawing by Ian Graham)</page><page sequence="50">50 Dieter Diitting JlfKl 12 Cib 19 Yaxkin (9.15.9.17.16) / LI 516b:102:683a, "enclosing (683a = kal) the very honorable (516b = hach-tzic/noh-tzic?) matter (102 = bal)" I K2 59:181.?, ti.iq..., "forbearing..." / 129?.561 / L2 V:168b:28:548, "beloved (V = ho) leader (168b) of the warriors (28:548 = katunl)" I K3,L3 152:751, Shield-Jaguar / 36:168b:562, "precious offspring, lord of Yaxchilan". Bird-Jaguar holds the staff with the opened windows also on Yaxchilan Lintel 33, dated 5 Cimi 19 Yaxkin (9.15.16.1.6). A part of his name clause runs as follows: A7 126.236:751, Bird-Jaguar / A8 III.168b:28:548, "great (III) leader (168b) of the warriors (28:548)"? / A9 1.108:764, u... chan, "his... snake" / A10 12.1:528, "vassal?

Perhaps it is not fortuitous that the CR dates of these three Yaxchilan lintels, de picting "lords holding staffs with opened windows", fall all in the month Yaxkin ("new/strong sun"). Of particular interest is the god B (Chac)-theme in the clauses following Bird Jaguar's name. The baac.chac, "the one who sheds the rain", could be the Chac (god B) of the Codices, and Bird-Jaguar could have been understood as his earthly rep resentative. Note Yucatec: baac = derramar agua o otro licor de vasija angosta; chaac, chaacil = lluvia, tempestad de agua, aguacero. A "diviner" named Xulu appears in the Popol Vuh together with a second diviner named Pacam (Edmonson 1971:128f). They help the heroe twins, Hunahpu and Xbalanque, to trick the Lords of Xibalba. The names xulu and pacam form a contrasting pair with pacam denoting "raised, distinguished", and xulu probably denoting "lowered, subordinate, vassal" in Quiche. The Nahuatl xolo, "paje, mozo, criado, esclavo", comes very close to this Quiche xulu. Edmonson (op.cit.) translates pacam, "rich", and xulu, "poor". The glyph 12.1:528 could denote alternatively "the one with the digging-stick (12 = xul) in the months (1 = u) of rain (528)". One should remind that this glyph could also designate a "captive" of Bird-Jaguar. On Aguateca Stela 1 the glyph 12:II:570[109]:102 is integrated into the name clause of a lord, shown divining on the stela. His "inauguration" is recorded by the clause (Fig. 25): B11-A12 (9.15.9.17.17) 13 Caban End of Yaxkin / B12 59.168a:684a, "place (59) of the lord's (168a) emerging from the enclosure (684a = hok.kal)" I A13 1030a.184.74, name of lord / B13 11:108:764, e?... chan, "your [pi]... snake" / 168a:626:142, "lord (168a) of the Coc-oms2 (626:142)" / A14 12:II:570[109]:102r xul.ca.baac.chac.bal?, "finished is the second shedding of rain/redfblood]"?28 /32.168a:716, "the offspring (32 = pul2) of the lords (168a) of Aguateca? (716)". T 12, xul, could denote here also "digging-stick".</page><page sequence="51">?Bats" in the Usumacinta-Valley 51 The glyph 168a:626:142 could also denote "lord of the poor/miserable ones (626 = coc)", or "owner (168a) of the turtles (coc)". Cocom is defined in Yucatec as "el que escucha con aten cion". I doubt that the later Cocoms of the early colonial Yucatan, the founders of Mayapan, have something to do with the Cocoms mentioned here. The "snake clauses" following the name glyphs of the Yaxchilan lords Shield Jaguar and Bird-Jaguar have been interpreted by Proskouriakoff (1963:152) as "captor clauses". She roughly interprets 1.108:764 as glyph referring to the "cap tor", and the following glyph as "name of the captive". Her interpretation is favored by the fact that the glyph 582[1040] (Lintel 33, A12) is inscribed on Yaxchilan Lintel 8 on the leg of Bird-Jaguar's captive. I understand Proskouriakoff's "captor" glyph 1.108:764 as reference to a war-like "snake goddess" (764 = chart, "snake") of the Tlazolteotl-type. In the translations given above I have treated the glyph following x. 108:764 as "title" referring to some "action or quality" of the snake-goddess. The glyph 582[1040], mol.tzek, for instance, could indicate "the gathering of skulls" by the goddess, but I admit that it could also name her captive "gatherer of skulls", or eventually kik.tzek, "bloody skull"29 (see also discussion in section a). Fig. 25 Aguateca Stela 1, glyphs All?B14 (drawing by Ian Graham) Shield-Jaguar, the deified king and predecessor of Bird-Jaguar, is accom panied by the following "snake goddess-clauses": Yaxchilan Lintel 32. A5 152:751, Shield-Jaguar / A6 1.108:764, u... chan, "his ....snake" / A7 229.533:102, ak.ahau-bal, "new kingship (ahau.bal = matter of the lords/rulers)". Yaxchilan Lintel 53. Dl 152.751, Shield-Jaguar / C2 1:108:764, u... chan, "his... snake" / 12.533:102, xul.ahau-bal, "end of the kingship". Shield-Jaguar may have been understood as earthly representative of god D, since the name glyphs of both, Shield-Jaguar (152.751) and god D (152.1009c:23), are characterized by prefix 152, which certainly does not represent a "shield"30, as erraneously suggested by the nickname "Shield-Jaguar". God D (Itzam Na) seems to have been the principal god of the nobility towards the end of the classic period, when he held a position formerly occupied by the sun god. 29 It could be that T 582 corresponds always to the values mol/mul, but that a "circle of droplets surrounding other graphemes", perhaps to be transcribed as 582v[... ], should be interpreted as kik/ch'ich', "blood". This would require the re writing of 582[1040] as 582v[1040]. In Codex Dresden 6c (3rd col.) the death god holds this glyph "bloody skull" in his out stretched T 713 (Jah)-hand. One could argue against this opinion that the "central jade-disc" of T 582 distinguishes the "sur rounding droplets" as "something precious", as the "precious liquid" blood. 30 Barthel (1977) interprets T 152 as chapat, "scolopender", and assumes a word-play with chac.pat, "great shaper/f ormer'', an appropiate title for a creator god like god D. If this holds true the correct name of Shield-Jaguar would have been Chapat (chacpat) Balam.</page><page sequence="52">52 Dieter Diitting The role of the sun god in classic times probably was underestimated by Thompson (1970), if compared with that of Itzam Na. Itzam Na in his anthropomorphic form as highest creator god plays a dominant role in the Codices, but not on the monuments where he appears more or less exclusively in the form of the rain-providing, double-headed celestial dragon or serpent. On the contrary, the sun god has only a negative, subordinate function in the Codices, but plays a profound role in the classic stone inscriptions. As patron of the number 4 and of the day Ahau he was the principal deity of the nobility and priests in classic times. The fact that k'in/k'ih not only means "sun, day", but also "time, season", demonstrates that he was understood as the driving force behind the cyclical revolution of time. (o) Another grapheme for "descending headlong". In Codex Dresden 58b the Venus-demon is depicted tumbling down headlong from a sky band with the glyphs 326[544] and 326[628], "light and dark clouds cov ering the sun and the moon"?, attached to its underside. The text above starts with the glyph 227inv.510b, "it tumbles down headlong (227inv) the star (510b)". T227 I have interpreted as nac (Diitting 1974:25). Among other meanings ("seat, throne", etc.) we find in Yucatec nacal, "ascend, climb up". T 227inv most likely refers to the opposite, "a descent, a tumbling down headlong". Thompson's (1972) readings 227 = ac and 227inv = noc cannot be accepted. In my opinion graphemes 743 and 228 stand for the value ac, and noc is not a Maya term for a "headlong descent". I regard 227inv, which occurs only in the Codices, as another grapheme for xul-, "descending headlong". A glyph referring to "the headlong emerging of the newborn from the mother's womb", 227inv.542:163, opens two glyph columns in Codex Dresden 20b. The first one reads (Fig. 26): 227inv. 542:163, "the headlong coming down [of the newborns](227 inv = xui?) from the womb (542 = ko) is completed/perfect (163 = 173)" / 758.110, uay-tan, "magician" (reference to moon goddess) / 152.1009c:23, god D's (Itzam Na's) / 24.533:24, ahaulil, "reign". Note Yucatec: ko = barriga; kohol = parir, y el parto; I extend Barthel's and Thompson's reading 542 =koh, "mask; give birth", toko, "womb, belly". The glyph 758:110 probably enti tles "the one who gives birth", the moon goddess Ix Chel, the patroness of childbirth, as uaytan, "magician". Fig. 26 Glyph column, Codex Dresden 20b</page><page sequence="53">?Bats" in the Usumacinta-Valley 53 (p) Conclusions. The present paper discusses a series of Maya texts, the common feature of which is the occurrence of one or several "bat" glyphs. The attempt was made to translate complete texts, whenever possible, using a' 'revised Tubingen key to Maya glyphs'' (cf. Barthel 1977b, and Appendix). Several factors complicate the translation of Maya texts. First the more or less severe question marks accompanying many of the supposed assignments. Secondly the fact that the "decipherment" cannot be accomplished on the basis of a single Maya language. Besides Yucatec the Quichean languages have been used exten sively. The different syntactical structure of these languages makes certain in terpretations doubtful. The Maya script is only a "partial script" with a content dic tated by the historical and ritual-religious interests of a small sophisticated nobility. It seems to make use of a "flexible minimal grammar", which probably can be re conciled with several Maya languages, but the clarification of this point needs further research. A third difficulty lies in the multiple meanings of many Maya words, which sometimes can be reconciled with totally different text interpreta tions. Intended ambiguity in meaning, enhanced by metaphorical expressions, seems to be one of the crucial features of the Maya texts. The loss of metaphors sev erely restricts all attempts towards decipherment. Despite these drawbacks I hope to have demonstrated how far the interpreta tion of whole Maya texts has been advanced in Tubingen by the end of 1977 by T. S. Barthel and myself. With respect to the "bat" glyphs I am not able to draw final conclusions. The negative deadly character of the "bat demon of the underworld", his qualities as ''sacrificer who beheads", are reflected in many texts in which' 'bat'' glyphs occur. A particularly nice example is the inscription on the Tablet of the Slaves, Palenque (cf. section 1). There historical events during the reign of a certain Chac Zotz' find their expression in qualities of the underworld bat-demon. A group of' 'bat'' glyphs in the inscriptions of Yaxchilan and Piedras Negras, the core of which is 756a:25.4, probably refers to invaders, foreigners in the Usumacinta valley, without permanent residence there. But since the interpretation of these ' 'bats'' strongly depends on the final decipherment of affixes T 25 and T 4, which are only tentatively translated as cal and xan in the present paper, a definite answer cannot be given. In some inscriptions "bat" glyphs seem to refer to "clouds", because of the near homophonous word pair zotz', "bat" / zutz', "cloud", of the Quichean languages. The most striking example is of course the emblem main sign 756[528] of Copan, translatable as zutz'.haab, "rain clouds". "Bat" glyphs with political implications figure prominently in the late inscrip tions of Bonampak, but not in a subordinate way as in Yaxchilan and Piedras Neg ras. The ruler of Bonampak around 9.17.10.0.0 (A.D. 780), Lord Muan, is entitled "lord of the bats", and I have suggested that these "bats" may have been Tzotziles from the highlands of Chiapas, who probably had gained control of Bonampak and other smaller sites(?) in the Usumacinta basin during this time. The discussion of some Yaxchilan inscriptions in this paper was a wellcome possibility for me to revise some opinions offered in my previous paper on the Great Goddess (Dutting 1976). In section e I have given a new account of certain events in the life of the great Yaxchilan lord Shield-Jaguar. Needless to say that this account owes much to the pioneering work of T. Proskouriakoff on the Yaxchilan inscrip tions.</page><page sequence="54">54 Dieter Diitting Graphemes T 12 and 229 occupy a crucial position in many texts.

In a forthcoming paper I shall demonstrate that only T 16 corresponds to a value yax, whereas T 17/575 have to be read as noh, "great, right; full, fill". The compound 17:510 or 575:510 (either a reference to Venus or Jupiter) thus denotes noh. ek, "great star". For affix 115, the former noh, I consider now a reading ual, "leaf; setup, stand up, arise; fan(?)". With respect to the prefix 115 of the "sun bat"-glyph note Chorti: war, warar, "light, brilliance, radiance", besides wa'ar, "standing, stood up, erect''. The glyphs 793v:575 /1.58[533]:503:24 of Yaxchilan Stela 12 (section e) could denote "the great (575 = noh) flight? (793v) / of the fainting lord's spirit". I have overlooked the mentioning of a Sun-Bat at Naranjo. References to the Naranjo lord Scroll-Squirrel, 122.765v.117, are occasionally followed by a clause referring to the emergence of a Sun-Bat from the earth; e.g. Naranjo Stela 30, frontside, dated (9.14.3.0.0), glyphs B1-B6: 1030m? / 122.765v:117, Scroll-Squirrel / 561:23 - 1030, (god K title) / 36.168a:278:553, "precious off spring of the lords of Naranjo" /VI.1005 or526P:178, "emerging (VI-178 = uac.el) from the earth (526)" / 756[544].116, zotz'.kin, "Sun-Bat".</page><page sequence="55">?Bats" in the Usumacinta-Valley 55 References Barrera Vasquez, A. 1965 El Libro de los Cantares de Dzitbalche.
