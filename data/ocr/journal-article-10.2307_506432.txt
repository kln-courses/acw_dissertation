ISBN 87-7288-545-9. Warfare and sacrifice are the major themes of this thought-provoking yet unconventional book. Hjortspring is an archaeological site on the island of Als (Denmark). A well-preserved boat was found there, containing a large number of weapons. In part 1, Randsborg shows that it is both a magnificent offering and a unique reflection of ancient warfare, thus symbolizing the quintessence of the book. The boat was ritually deposited in a small bog, some- where in the mid- to late fourth century B.C. It may be interpreted as the remains of a defeated enemy army from the North German region, offered to a god of the victo- rious Danish warriors. In part 2, Hjortspring is left for a pan-European excur- sus, analyzing sacrificial practices in the Mediterranean and central and northern Europe from the Middle Neo- lithic until the Iron Age. Especially in the chapter about the Nordic region, some interesting views are presented. Among other points, Randsborg argues that Danish ritual deposits show a basic bi- or tripartite division from the Neolithic onward, relating to the forces of the main ele- ments of sky, earth, and water. A major change should have occurred during the Iron Age, when under Mediterranean influence, elite-bound, institutionalized rituals performed at new cult places such as Viereckschanzen gained impor- tance. This may also have been the period that saw the introduction of anthropomorphic gods. The Hjortspring boat itself was probably sacrificed to this type of god. From the same European, long-term perspective, part 3 deals with the development of ancient warfare. It is ar- gued that major changes in its technique and sociology appeared during the Early Iron Age, inspired by both the Mediterranean phalanx technique and horsemen from the steppe. From the ratio of weapon types of the Hjort- spring army, Randsborg deduces that even armies in these remote regions must have been organized along princi- ples resembling the famous hoplite phalanx. Resuming his main arguments in part 4, he goes on to argue that by adopting this phalanx, societies in the north thus linked up with a renewed outburst of egalitarian ideas, which have greatly influenced European society. Concerning the processes that allowed all these influ- ences to spread over Europe, Randsborg remains rather vague. He is very convincing, though, in showing that the much-neglected themes of warfare and sacrifice are really helpful for understanding crucial aspects of ancient so- cieties. The ideas presented in this book may be a fresh and useful basis for more specific case studies on ancient beliefs and values. DAVID FONTIJN FACULTY OF ARCHAEOLOGY UNIVERSITY OF LEIDEN, P.O.
