<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Birth of the Gods and the Origins of Agricul- ture, by Jacques Cauvin. Translated by Trevor Watkins, from French. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000. xviii + 259 pp., 8 plates and 70 figures. Cloth. $59.95. Jacques Cauvin's first and second editions of this book were written in French (Cauvin 1994; 1997), and appar- ently outside of the French-speaking areas, the work cre- ated little impact. To correct this lamentable state of international illiteracy, Trevor Watkins has produced an excellent translation into English, and this new edition should at last bring Cauvin's provocative theoretical con- siderations on the development of the Levantine Neolithic the attention it deserves. The latest edition, six years later than the first one, maintains the structure-indeed, even the same text-as the earlier versions. The main changes were the addition of a "Postscript" chapter to include "the most important advances in research during the last two or three years" (p. xiv), as well as the inclusion of some new endnotes, references, and an expansion of the bibliography. An introduction precedes 18 chapters and a Conclu- sion that are distributed among three sections: Part I- The Origins of Agriculture (chapters 1-7); Part II-The Beginnings of Neolithic Diffusion (chapters 8-12); and Part III-The Great Exodus (chapters 13-18). Cauvin wastes no time in informing the reader of the intent of his book. In the introduction, a Durkheimian reference to the "collective psychology" (p. 4) begins the condemnation of the "anglophone New Archaeology" processual approach to the interpretation of archaeological developments. Cauvin rejects the "unverified 'materialist' premises concerning human nature" in which one con- fuses "science with ideology" (p. 7), preferring instead a "mentalist" (or "paleopsychic" to adapt the term of Perrot [Perrot 2001: 17]) assessment of the inspirations that led to revolutionary changes in the human relationships with the environment. Part I begins with a brief overview of the later Palaeo- lithic and early Epipalaeolithic developments in the Le- vant. In chapter 2 Cauvin concentrates on-and essentially demotes the importance of-the Natufian period, when permanent village settlement developed for the first time based on intensive hunting and foraging. Noting that sedentism was a major change in lifestyle, setting the foundation for later developments, Cauvin dismisses the increasing Natufian use of wild grains as nutritional re- sources since "harvesting of wild cereals thus appears only as a general characteristic of the Natufian economy ... [and] it appears that the harvesting of cereals did not play a part of the Natufian 'culture'"(pp. 19, 20). Further- more, "we can detect not so much as a single element that prefigures a techno-economic context still to come" (p. 20). This statement would seem to disregard the grow- ing importance of sickle elements, cereal processing equip- ment, and storage facilities that Flannery (1971: 56) cited as pre-adaptive developments that made later dependence on agriculture possible. The title of chapter 3 ("The Revolution of Symbols and the Origins of Neolithic Religion") introduces the reader to the most vital aspect of neolithization. The Khi- amian phase of the PPNA, with its typical arrowheads, hoes, bone tools, and architecture, "scarcely merit[s] being made the first stage of neolithization if it had not pro- duced.., .the revolution of symbols" (p. 22); no mention is made at all of the importance of agriculture to neoli- thization, a new and radical relationship between humans and their environment that spreads along the length of the eastern Mediterranean. The reason for this exclusion seems to be that Cauvin does not really see "cultural behavior" as pertinent to the physical environment, but "only with those aspects of it that contribute to a socially transmitted knowledge (the 'interior environment' of Leroi-Gourhan)" (pp. 19-20). The critical development in the Khiamian was the emergence of "the Woman and the Bull (the male comple- ment)," who took over "leading roles [in religion] throughout the whole of the Near Eastern Neolithic and Bronze Age periods" (p. 29). This statement has an ele- ment of exaggeration to it, for while the iconography of the later Neolithic cults in Qatal Hiytiik might support his claim in part, the range of religious symbols at early PPNB Nevali Cori (e.g., Hauptmann 1999), G6bekli Tepe (Schmidt 1998; 1999), and most recently at Kommagene (Hauptmann 2000; Verhoeven 2001), all in southeastern Anatolia, presents a considerably different perspective. Elevating the human female in Neolithic religion to a "Mother-Goddess," Cauvin emphasizes her central im- portance as "not just a fertility symbol, but a genuine mythical personality.., who crowned a religious system which one could describe as 'female monotheism' in the sense that all the rest remained subordinate to her" (p. 32). This again appears to be epitomized by the later sixth millennium bp (uncalibrated) throned examples at ?atal</page><page sequence="2">84 BOOK REVIEWS BASOR 326 H6yUk and perhaps at Sha'ar Hagolan (e.g., Garfinkel 1999), but this is hardly supported by the symbols at PPNB sites in the southern Levant and Anatolia. There certainly are female figurines-and even "monumental" female statues-but one can place them in another set of religious and ritual contexts that, while associated with spiritual powers, need not attain a goddess status (cf. Rollefson 2000: 167-68; Schmandt-Besserat 1998: 10- 11). Essentially, it is possible that some communities from different parts of the Near East, at different times in the Neolithic, may have worshipped goddesses, but the evi- dence is too weak, and even contradictory, that everyone throughout the region followed this religious reverence from its claimed sudden inception "right up to the time of the male-dominated monotheism of Israel" (p. 31). Chapters 4 and 5 cover the contemporaneous develop- ment of intensified neolithization processes (Sultanian, Aswadian, and Mureybetian "cultures"). In chapter 6 ("An Assessment") Cauvin tackles what he sees as the futility of understanding the emergence of agriculture under the "penury" (p. 62) promoted within the parameters of pro- cessual archaeology. Despite his earlier caution on the reliability of the archaeological record (p. 31), Cauvin denies that there is any evidence for environmental pres- sures necessary under Binford's nuclear and marginal model and claims that agriculture was a consequence of a mental revolution, a change in attitude between human society and its environment. He sets the stage in chapter 6, but in chapter 7 ("Transformation of the Mind") he goes back into earlier Neolithic research and agrees with Braid- wood's famous view, that agriculture didn't develop earlier than it did because "Culture wasn't ready" (pp. 65, 66, 72). Notably, Cauvin warns the reader that explaining how this mental, cultural inception of agriculture "will remain to be better supported in the future" (p. 8). Nevertheless, for him there was a "want" to change that emanated from a dissatisfied collective psychology, a want that was asso- ciated with a "revolution in symbols" (p. 66). In short, Natufian society had suffered from an "existential mal- aise" and desired a thorough change from top to bottom, a desire that truly led to a "cultural revolution" (p. 72). Part II describes the "motor" that results in the dis- persal of the desire to dominate nature across the Near East. Chapter 8 makes it clear that it was really in the de- velopment and manifestation of the PPNB that we see the inexorable conquest (see below) of the pre-Neolithic areas of the eastern Mediterranean, and in chapter 9 Cauvin stresses that the source of the extrusion of the Neolithic complex was from a single locality, a Neolithic expression of the "Eve Theory" of cultural innovations and migra- tions. The "PPNB was effectively born and matured in the northern Levant" (p.78), specifically in the "middle Eu- phrates, the only part of the Levant where the culture is indigenous, [and] is thus its true cradle" (p. 81). The be- ginnings of the PPNB culture are, to Cauvin, seen only in the area around his excavations at the site of Mureybet. Chapter 9 is called "The Birth of a Culture in the North- ern Levant and the Neolithisation of Anatolia." Cauvin ac- knowledges that his colleagues working in Turkey do not universally accept his model for the neolithization of Ana- tolia (p. 135; cf. Hauptmann 1999: 69; Ozdogan 1999). This model is one of "the acculturation of a local cultural background by a dominant, expansionist culture" (p. 89) from the Levant. The whole ensemble of the PPNB in Anatolia shows "the contribution of a new population, at least in part" (p. 93). There is a possible problem in this model, however: the acculturation is posited as proceed- ing unidirectionally from south to north, but since the Mureybetian (Early PPNB) spread in Anatolia "practically simultaneously with its emergence in the middle Euph- rates" (p. 92), is it not conceivable that the diffusion/ac- culturation may have actually proceeded in the opposite direction? In the case of Israel and Jordan, covered in chapter 10, where agriculture was already established in the PPNA, the appearance of the PPNB was a consequence of diffu- sion among a population clinging to a retarded Sulta- nian (PPNA) existence: "No site [in these areas] is dated earlier than 8200 B.C., and it is therefore only in its middle phase that the PPNB appears in the southern Levant" (pp. 97-98), disregarding undated parallels to the northern region at Jilat 7 (Garrard et al. 1994) and Abu Hudhud (Rollefson 1996) in Jordan and at Mujahiya (Gopher 1990) and Horvat Galil (Gopher 1997). The last site has a date older than 8300 B.C. (Gopher, personal communication). The nature of the diffusion toward the south involved considerable continuity in the local communities, so there was no replacement of one culture by another. But there was, in Cauvin's view, a considerable movement of popu- lation from Syria toward the south, a "gracile Mediterra- nean" group who "added themselves to form a racially composite whole" as seen by the skulls at Jericho, for in- stance. "The PPNB acculturation is in this case an unam- biguous result of an ethnic admixture" which even might have involved "an intrusion by force" (p. 104, emphasis added; also see p. 121). Chapter 11 treats the evidence of southern Levantine symbolism, including the occurrences of figurines, mod- eled skulls, masks, plaster statues, and ritual buildings. De- tails in this chapter are sometimes incorrect, as are some of the interpretations. Cauvin describes the statues from CAin Ghazal as "coarse" and "maladroit[ly made]" and con- cludes that they weren't made by "artists ... and the capa- bility of plastic art to reflect individual characteristics did not have the importance that it later acquired" (p. 112). This would seem to be an ethnocentric appreciation of what may have been the intention of the artists who crafted the statues; the "not very beautiful" bodily proportions may</page><page sequence="3">2002 BOOK REVIEWS 85 have had vital spiritual importance to the ritual leaders, if not to all residents of communities where such statues played a religious role. In his discussion on sanctuaries, Cauvin cautions against extrapolating too far, for "Is it not the ideology or personal preferences of the archaeologist or those of the current period that finally dictate his choice?" (pp. 119-20). The energy involved in the emergence and later distri- bution of the PPNB culture is treated in chapter 12: "Dy- namics of a Dominant Culture." Cauvin emphasizes here the critical importance of symbols in general, but he con- centrates on the male aspect of the "Woman-Bull" pair, for the associated virility was "the real internal dynamism of the PPNB culture" (p.125). In the section entitled "The Love-Affair with Weapons," Cauvin notes the attention to detail, symmetry, and "aesthetics" in the new type of ar- rowhead that began in the PPNB, one that may have been used in hunting, but probably was principally a prestige item, a symbol of a new "mental attitude that values weaponry" and leads to the question if the spread of the PPNB was, in fact, "through 'force of arms"'-although Cauvin admits there is very little direct evidence for war- fare (p. 126). Nevertheless, this new aggressive, virile, and even arrogant attitude to exert power and control over nature, Cauvin argues, is a more likely reason that animals became domesticated than simply an economic decision to ensure availability of food on the hoof (pp. 127-28). Part III presents Cauvin's account of the "exodus" of the PPNB from the heartland to the rest of the region, taking over both arable territory and the steppe and desert areas. Chapter 16 covers the "sedentary push east" throughout northern Iraq. In chapter 17 Cauvin expresses views of the emergence of pastoral nomadism that are very reminiscent of a model that appeared even earlier (K6hler-Rollefson 1992), one that he apparently hadn't seen since it is not cited in the bibliography. A review of various hypotheses to explain the spread of the Neo- lithic is offered in chapter 18, and all of the hypotheses are rejected because of the problem of supporting evidence, leaving the "psycho-cultural hypothesis" as the lone, be- lievable candidate. Of particular interest in the spread is the Neolithic col- onization of Cyprus, which was already populated by hunters. A strange situation developed there, for there are circular houses instead of rectangular ones, no images of the Woman or the Bull, and no "virility" expressed in weaponry. Cauvin offers the possibility that the new in- habitants were part of a sort of "sea-borne nomadism" ... originally from the interior of Syria... [The absence of character- istic PPNB features] was the effect of nomadic pastoralism... which had the effect of making people forget over several generations of mobility a good part of the sophisticated components of the comforts of their abandoned sedentary life. When they returned to sedentism, these groups reacti- vated their latent technical knowledge in order to make things that were entirely new. (p. 169) This "just so" story is difficult to accept, precisely because the appeal to paleopsychic explication waffles beyond the pale of credibility. It is certainly an example of the draw- backs that will "remain to be better supported in the future" (p. 8). Chapter 14 presents an overview of the continuation of PPNB diffusion throughout the Levantine "nucleus." Here there are some accounts that overstate, understate, or simply misstate circumstances. He claims, for example, that "the entire Jordan Valley was entirely empty for more than a millennium" (p. 144), which is contradicted by Ha- gosherim (Goring-Morris and Belfer-Cohen 1997: 86) and Garfinkel's research at Tell CAli (Garfinkel 1994). Cauvin goes on to claim that the whole of the southern Levant was virtually devoid of permanent settlement during the second half of the eighth millennium (equivalent to the PPNC at CAin Ghazal), which is refuted by the continued occupation at CAin Ghazal (Rollefson and K6hler-Rollef- son 1993), Wadi Shu'eib (Simmons et al. 2001), and at Atlit Yam in Israel (Galili et al. 1993; cf. Gopher and Gophna 1993). Kfar Hahoresh, evidently a ritual center in the Galilee (cf. Goring-Morris et al. 1998), "is almost cer- tainly late PPNB" (p. 231, n. 10); in fact, an unpublished radiocarbon date places the site in the center of the Mid- dle PPNB (S. Kangas, personal communication). Cauvin states that there was no transition to the Ceramic Neolithic (p. 150), although this transition, well documented at CAin Ghazal, was reported before the first edition of Cauvin's book appeared (Rollefson 1993). The explanation for the emergence and spread of the Neolithic as a result of an inherent need to conquer at times reaches hyperbole. PPNB colonists moved across the landscape with "a hardiness and spirit of adventure, for the danger lay before them and not behind them... [there was] a bubbling and boiling of the cultural sphere... [with a] messianic self confidence" (p. 205) in "an exodus that is indistinguishable from the spirit of the crusade" (p. 208). The teleological drive behind this departure from Rousseau's state of nature is the appearance of the Wo- man and the Bull, but it is still not at all clear what im- pelled the collective psyche to develop this new ideology, and despite an imaginative appeal, it is simply beyond our abilities to psychoanalyze architecture, stone tools, palaeobotanical remains, and goat bones. One certainly must ask if the messianic proselytizing was necessary in areas of independent Neolithic development in eastern and southern Asia, Africa, and the New World. Like Nietzsche, Cauvin clearly rejects the "ideology of scien- tific truth" (p. 210), but somehow I don't think "truth" has</page><page sequence="4">86 BOOK REVIEWS BASOR 326 been found in the mentalist approach presented in this book.
