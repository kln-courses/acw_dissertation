[SOI] The Formalism of Negativity Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak and Slavoj Zizek are two of our most energetic post-Marxist writers today. Both draw significantly on Marx-in particular on Marx's analysis of the commodity-for their work and both are concerned with the question of justice. In each case, we find a rigorous formalism that derives its force from negativity. What makes the juxtaposition of these two writers interesting is a basic antagonism that persists beyond what they have in common, while this antagonism is at the same time the indicator of their equally compelling ethics. I want first to recapitulate important points of their arguments in order to foreground the analytic energy at play. In the two long essays on Marx under consideration here as well as in many of the conversations that make up The Post-Colonial Critic, Spivak refocuses the attention of cultural politics on "value" and in particular on the hitherto precluded "use value." Her reasons for doing so are complex but justified: in the discursivist climate of "cultural studies," economics has been too easily written off as "economic reductionism." This dismissal of the economic text is part of the old binary opposition between "economics" and "culture," an opposition that is so deeply entrenched that any attempt to reopen the "economic" question runs the risk of being mistaken for an embarrassing instance of economic determinism. So why is it so important not to let go of this question? One explanation is that the "economic" occupies a place in Spivak's reading that is similar to "center" in Jacques Derrida. In contemporary poststructuralist critiques of Marx, what often happens is a rewriting of value as exchange value and exchange value alone. A notable example is the early work of Jean Baudrillard. In texts such as For a Critique of the Political Economy of the Sign and The Mirror of Production, Baudrillard's thesis is basically that, although Marx introduced the importance of exchange value, he nevertheless fell into the trap of (re)privileging "use" as what authenticates value. For Baudrillard, such a (re)privileging is the sign of an essentialism that lies at the heart of Western society's productionism, a productionism that Marxism further intensifies. However, the sweeping dismissal of "the West" that Baudrillard makes as a consequence of this thesis, a dismissal that was typical of the generation of avant-garde intellectuals writing in France in the late 1960s and early 1970s, did not make him any less Orientalist or less imperialist in his approach to non- Western ("primitive") cultures. Even though his critique of "use value" remains diacritics 23.1: 3-22 3 diacritics / spring 1993</page><page sequence="3">theoretically pertinent, Baudrillard has not succeeded in providing any genuine alterna- tive to the problems he describes. At the other extreme, we find Jean-Joseph Goux's attempt to account for the rise of money in "polysymbolic" ways. Goux's Symbolic Economies after Freud and Marx offers an understanding of the successful evolution of the general equivalent that is progressivist and respectably academic. Unlike Baudrillard, who denounces the West as a result of a similar kind of understanding, Goux rationalizes it by giving the ascendency of money the systematicity and inevitability of a philosophical tradition. Spivak astutely calls Goux's type of account "continuist" ["SSQV" 155 ff.]. So how should that "slight, contentless thing" (Marx's way of describing value) be theorized? While we must, if we follow Marx, accept "value" as an index of "labor," Spivak objects to the view that value is simply labor's "representation." She maintains that to think of value in these terms is to relativize it-to analogize it with narrative, metaphor, language, and so forth and thus to disavow its irreducible materiality. Such relativizing of value is mere postmodernist "culturalism" ["SSQV" 168]. Spivak's alternative comes from Derrida, whom together with Jacques Lacan I shall take as the two major cliches- commonplaces-that structure the writings of the two authors under review. Taking from Derrida's notion of writing as diffderance, Spivak concentrates on value not as the representation (that is, completed replication) of labor but as difference: [T]he basic premise of the recent critique of the labor theory of value is predicated on the assumption that, according to Marx, Value represents Labor. Yet the definition of Value in Marx establishes itself not only as a represen- tation but also as a differential. What is represented or represents itself in the commodity-differential is Value. ["SSQV" 158] "Value," in other words, functions in the same enigmatic manner as "writing." While it is supposed to be secondary (since it occurs as a result of labor, as writing is thought to occur after "natural" language-speech), it seems shamelessly usurping: it acts as a primary determinant, an agent that creates and stabilizes value/worth. Like writing also, value poses the question about origins: does the value/worth of value come from what "precedes" it, namely, labor, or does it come from itself? Isn't it scandalous to assume that value is self-originating when, supposedly, labor is? And yet we cannot think (labor) without thinking in value ... and so on. Reading Marx after reading Derrida, Spivak is thus able to force a heterogeneous and improper "economic text" to emerge: like writing, money is both outside and inside ["SSQV" 162]; its value comes from its being inside circulation/exchange, but in order to own it you have to take it outside circulation. It is both "Culture" (the agent of capitalism, the general equivalent overriding all others) and "Nature" (what is "originally" there), and it violates the clean conceptual boundary between the two. The return of value to this originary openness is what Spivak calls the "insertion into textuality" of the economic. It is not to be confused with economic determinism, which it resembles simply because it refuses to let go of the significance of the economic "text." Not letting go of the economic means not accepting the privileging of one term over the other in the binary opposition between economic and cultural, and thus not accepting the happy stability of either economism or culturalism (the latter being merely an inverted version of economism). Economic/use value is therefore the equivalent of "center" in Derrida's philosophizing. It is a function, a catachresis that results from a series of constructions, and, even though we must deconstruct it, we cannot do without it: "Claiming catachreses from a space that one cannot not want to inhabit and yet must criticize is ... the predicament of the postcolonial."1 1. Spivak "Poststructuralism " 228. See 241-42n20 for an explanation of "catachresis. " I cite part of this note in the section "Naming." 4</page><page sequence="4">The foregrounding of value as a problematic-as heterogeneity-enables Spivak to read Marx in a more nuanced way than he has hitherto been read: it is in Marx's basic critique of the suppression of heterogeneity that the Derridean analogy is to be found. Derrida 's analogy (and indeed all his work, most especially " White Mythology " and Limited Inc) discloses that the method of all logic... is allied to capitalism: exclusivism, a common mode represented as universal, suppression of heterogeneity. ["SRM" 51] The method of Capital-the title of a book-is the method of capital-the value form (as Marxpoints out) not by special dispensation but because making theory has something in common with capitalisation (as Derrida points out). ["SRM" 56] What is special about Spivak's reading is not simply that it is nuanced, but that it is through such nuancing that she returns us to the question of social injustice that was the primary basis of Marx's inquiry. In her reading, "heterogeneity" becomes a criticism not only of economic and/or cultural reductionism but also of philosophy's demand for purity. It is only when we give up the impulse to be philosophically pure, she writes, that we can see the point Marx is making about the social injustice brought about by capitalism, because there is nothing in this injustice itself which is philosophically problematic: Marx questionsphilosophical "justice " and "elegance " (and necessity) even as he uses them to establish his analysis. Otherwise Marx could not write of the extraction of surplus-value, the condition of possibility of capitalist exploita- tion: "This circumstance is a piece of good luckfor the buyer [of labour-power: the capitalist], but by no means an injustice towards the seller [of labour-power: the worker] " (Capital 301). A purely philosophical justification for revolution- ary practice cannot be found. It is because this heterogeneous concatenation of "knowing" and "doing", this possibility of a radical critique of philosophical justice, is most often recuperated within a reading in terms ofphilosophical justice and consistency, that the deconstructive moment in Marx is seen as a blind condemnation of what, according to Marx's own system, isphilosophicallyjust. ["SRM" 50; emphases in the original] The interest of this reading of Marx is that there is something philosophy cannot account for, no matter how "consistent" it is-or precisely because it is so "consistent." This something is the asymmetry between capital and labor, the accounts of which have to be settled outside the bounds of philosophy's sense of justice. In this regard, "Marx's use of the word 'value' may be seen as catachrestical to the philosophical usage" [Spivak, "Poststructuralism" 226]. While Spivak reads the asymmetry between capital and labor as catachrestical differance-the excess that is "outside" the system and that at the same time keeps it functioning, Zizek, following Lacan rather than Derrida, calls this asymmetry the "symptom" invented by Marx. This is the way Zizek describes it in The Sublime Object of Ideology: How, then, can we define the Marxian symptom ?Marx "invented the symptom" (Lacan) by means of detecting a certain fissure, an asymmetry, a certain "pathological" imbalance which belies the universalism of the bourgeois "rights and duties." This imbalance, far from announcing the "imperfect diacritics / spring 1993 5</page><page sequence="5">realization" of these universal principles-that is, an insufficiency to be abolished byfurther development-functions as their constitutive moment: the "symptom" is, strictly speaking, a particular element which subverts its own universalfoundation, a species subverting its own genus. In this sense, we can say that the elementary Marxian procedure of "criticism of ideology " is already "symptomatic ": it consists in detecting a point of breakdown heterogeneous to a given ideologicalfield and at the same time necessaryfor thatfield to achieve its closure, its accomplishedform. [SOI 21; emphases in the original] While Spivak would focus on the question of value-the place where the fissure and heterogeneity of the "equation"/"equivalence" between capital and labor occurs-Zizek too would return the "symptom" to the way Marx analyzes the commodity. Zizek's reference here is Alfred Sohn-Rethel, who argues in Intellectual and Manual Labor: A Critique of Epistemology that the groundbreaking point made by Marx with regard to commodities is that abstraction is located not in human minds but in the social relations conducted between human beings through the commodity. Sohn-Rethel's point, how- ever, is not that the commodity "conceals" the social exchange between men, but that the exchange is possible only with a certain nonknowledge, nonawareness. It is the action of exchange itself that is abstract. Sohn-Rethel thus not only overthrows the idealist assumption that mental activities are "abstract" but also the materialist assumption that actions are "concrete." Instead, real abstraction has nothing to do with what we assume to be "inner" or mental reality. As Zizekputs it: "the abstraction appertaining to the act of exchange is in an irreducible way external, decentred" [SOI 19]. Belaboring this point about abstraction is part of Zizek's effort to put across the thesis of his book, that there is a kind of abstraction/materiality which is neither simply mind nor matter, but which is a "sublime object." Using money as his primary example, Zizek writes in a way that reminds us of Saussure's description of language:2 we have touched a problem unsolved by Marx, that of the material character of money: not of the empirical, material stuff money is made of, but of the sublime material, of that other "indestructible and immutable" body which persists beyond the corruption of the bodyphysical.... This immaterial corporeality of the "body within the body" gives us a precise definition of the sublime object. [SOI 18; emphases in the original] Beginning with Marx's analysis of money, then, both Zizek and Spivak concentrate on that asymmetrical situation between the supposedly reciprocal exchange between labor and capital, and both point to surplus value as the "origin" of the social (the social as exploitation or the social as symptom). But while Spivak would go on from here to deconstruct value, that is, to return value to differance, to emphasize the indispensability of "use value" as a "master word," and to critique this indispensability, Zizek would 2. When he needed an example to make his point about language, Saussure too would use money: it is impossible for sound alone, a material element, to belong to language.... All our conventional values have the characteristic of not being confused with the tangible element which supports them. For instance, it is not the metal in a piece of money that fixes its value. A coin nominally worth five francs may contain less than half its worth of silver. Its value will vary according to the amount stamped upon it and according to its use inside or outside a political boundary. This is even more true of the linguistic signifier, which is not phonic but incorporeal-constituted not by its material substance but by the differences that separate its sound-image from all others. [Saussure 118-19] 6</page><page sequence="6">concentrate on surplus itself as the locus of the impossible encounter between rationality and trauma. To paraphrase Zizek, we may say that there is a traumatic kernel (the Real) which we cannot comprehend, but this noncomprehension is also what enables us to function. The negativity of this "kernel"-negative because we do not and cannot know it-is what gives our life its positive consistency (our ability to make sense of the world). Survival means a nonknowledge of the "Real"; conversely, knowing is lethal. This nonknowledge- cum-living-well is our symptom: it is at once what sustains us and what (potentially) can destroy us. The symptom itself might be a nauseous, verminous open wound such as the one growing luxuriantly on the child's body in Kafka's "A Country Doctor" [SOI 76], but it's also probably all you have-it's what makes you "you," what is "in you more than yourself." His elegant style notwithstanding, Zizek's message hits home primarily because of his repetitiveness and his at times dogmatic insistence on the force of "negativity." Whether he is reading literature, film, jokes, comics, science fiction, philosophy, or anything else, Zizek is seldom interested in the problem of aesthetic form and its relation to (the construction of) subjectivity as such. Rather, he is always looking for the moment when the symptom erupts, when the paradox reveals itself. Nor is he interested in the distinction between the individual and the social: the working of the symptom applies to individual organisms and collective bodies alike. This is why he describes the functioning of capitalism in the same terms he would use to describe individual consciousness: the evolutionist reading of the formula of capital as its own limit is inadequate: the point is not that, at a certain moment of its development, the frame of the relation of production starts to constrict further development of the productive forces; the point is that it is this very immanent limit, this "internal contradic- tion", which drives capitalism into permanent development. [SOI 52; emphasis in the original] By contrast, Spivak is concerned with subjectivity (which she sometimes calls "soul- making") in relation to its various forms of collective predication (for example, philo- sophical, historiographic, literary, aesthetic, and economic). The rough and unfinished quality of her rhetorical style is the sign of an impatience with deliberate conceptual refinement or coherence of any kind. This impatience stems from the old-fashioned Marxist view that the social rather than the personal is the place of struggle. The Roles of Error This recapitulation of the formalisms of Spivak and Zizek allows us to approach a major question in their texts, namely, the roles of "error." For Zizek it is simple: error is not a problem. In his texts we often find a kind of defense of the truthful role of error and of deception. Among his favorite stories about lying is the Freudian joke often quoted by Lacan, in which a Jew reproaches his friend: "Why are you telling me that you are going to Cracow and not to Lemberg, when you're really going to Cracow?" [SOI 197]. The Lacanian point is that we are so deeply ingrained in the belief that "truth" is something hidden, that even when it is frankly displayed in front of us, we will take it as a lie. Because of our perverse relation to truth-that is, our tendency to believe only in the "truth" we have a hand (consciousness) in establishing-there is little need for us to "expose" errors deliberately. Instead, we should trust that truth will always reveal itself through (the distortions of) human language/behavior, while deliberate exposure of error may often do no more than hide and distort the truth further. For Zizek, it is through that "surplus," that diacritics / spring 1993 7</page><page sequence="7">extra something which is not consciously calculable and which works as a limit from within (an organism and a system), that truth "unveils" itself. For Spivak it is not so simple. Her relation to error is more contradictory. ("I don't have a problem with something being a contradiction. I think contradictions can be productive" [PCC 127].) On the one hand, she sounds like Zizek when she insists that deconstruction is not ideology critique, that is, that it is not interested in the exposure of error: Theproblem with the idea of deconstruction as a form of ideology-critique is that deconstruction is not really interested in the exposure of error.... Derrida is interested in how truth is constructed rather than in exposing error.... Deconstruction can only speak in the language of the thing it criticises. So as Derrida says, itfallsprey to its own critique, in a certain way. That makes it very different from ideology-critique. [PCC 135; emphasis in the original] Indeed, in the writings of proper deconstructionists like Paul de Man, it is the errors-the misreadings, the aporias, and the failures-that are language's most truthful revelations. And yet if deconstruction is, as Spivak says, not interested in the exposure of error, where does her ethical charge come from? The burden that Spivak places on deconstruction- not that of reifying the text but that of producing difference and thus alternative histories, such as those of women and the oppressed in the "third world"-is often indistinguishable from the burden of a critical awareness and a permanent wakefulness. Her frequent use of the word vigilance warns that the critic must always be on the alert especially against her own (privileged) slippages. In spite of Spivak's disclaimers, then, her use of deconstruction can indeed be seen as a form of ideology critique (as for instance the critique of "first world" imperialism) that is in keeping with the reconstructive and reinventive spirit of the Enlightenment.3 There is nothing wrong with such a use, but there is a problem. The problem is that, caught between the deconstructive demand to be nuanced with regard to textual heterogeneity (a demand that is negative in force, because such is the force of language) and the rationalist demand to be "vigilant" to "errors" committed exploitatively against the disenfranchised, Spivak's writing must become more and more "self-conscious"-self-referential and self-subverting at once-even as, ironically, some of her readers charge her with being too theoretical and elitist (that is, deconstructionist) while others criticize her for being heavy-handed (that is, not paying enough attention to the fine turns of philosophical texts). 3. [T]he Enlightenment is defined, not so much by an adherence to a certain ideal or a doctrine, but by the choice of an ethical attitude. Foucault illustrates this with the example of what Baudelaire called "the heroism of modern life": the choice of a certain way of life, the style of a dandy, of a fldneur, an "aesthetics of existence," finding "eternity in the passing moment" etc. What makes this attitude typical of modernity is the constant reconstruction and reinvention of the present which goes along with the reconstruction and the reinvention of the self. Both elements-the subject and the present it belongs to- have no "objective" status; they have to be perpetually (re)constructed, and their status is purely "ethical." So modernity essentially results in an ethics of self-construction. [Dolar, "The Legacy of the Enlightenment" 46] This is an essay in which Mladen Dolar traces the origins of Foucault and Lacan 's interest in the Enlightenment back to Kant. Dolar argues that whereas for Foucault, the legacy of the Enlight- enment lies in Kant's new attitude toward the subject-"the ethical attitude in which he constructs himself as well as the age he belongs to " [53]-for Lacan, Kant's novelty lies in his pointing to the inner impossibility of an autonomous subject and thus to an inner limit to the project of the Enlightenment [54]. 8</page><page sequence="8">The problem indicated by Spivak's contradiction (a contradiction for which she is not personally responsible but which the intensities of her readings exemplify) is succinctly described by Zizek in what he considers to be the problem of poststructuralism. (However, it is important to remember that Zizek makes no distinctions among terms such as "poststructuralism," "deconstruction," and "discourse analysis.") Zizek thinks that the problem of poststructuralism springs from its (excessively) painstaking scrutiny of language. While poststructuralism denies that there is something called "metalanguage"-that is, a language which takes another language as its object, thus making itself the mastering subject-it nonetheless continues to speak as one (since this is the way language operates). And yet, precisely because of this denial of metalanguage (a "master narrative"), the poststructuralist "subject" must also speak as if it is fully conscious of itself, of its "position," of its limits-hence the endless self-referential digressions, qualifications, apologies, anticipations of criticisms, and so on. What Zizek advocates, therefore, is that no matter how self-conscious (that is, responsible) we try to sound, we will always be speaking in the metalinguistic mode about others as objects. The flip side of this is that we cannot completely control how our language would sound, nor can we always anticipate and thus outsmart the criticisms of others: the only way to avoid the Real is to produce an utterance ofpure metalanguage which, by its patent absurdity, materializes its own impossibility: that is, a paradoxical element which, in its very identity, embodies absolute otherness, the irreparable gap that makes it impossible to occupy a metalanguage position. [SOI 156] Interestingly enough, this is also Spivak's attitude toward language. Despite her "error-exposing" tendency, Spivak's other point is precisely that we need from time to time to risk essentialism. In no way can we absolutely avoid making "essentialist" or "universalist" statements (that is, avoid talking metalinguistically), because "universalisation, finalisation, is an irreducible moment in any discourse" [PCC 11]. Moreover, the ability to talk essentialistically, precisely because it ignores the puritanical demand of theory, can be politically useful: You pick up the universal that will give you the power to fight against the other side, and what you are throwing away by doing that is your theoretical purity. Whereas the great custodians of the anti-universal are obliged therefore simply to act in the interest of a great narrative, the narrative of exploitation, while they keep themselves clean by not committing themselves to anything. Infact they are actually run by a great narrative even as they are busy protecting their theoretical purity by repudiating essentialism. [PCC 12] This fearlessness vis-a-vis speaking "the universal"-a fearlessness that is firmly grounded in an understanding of the dangers of essentialism and metalanguage-is one of the most crucial traits in both Spivak and Zizek's ethics. Both are, in the sense described by Marx, ruthless.4 4. [I]f the designing of the future and the proclamation of ready-made solutions for all time is not our affair, then we realize all the more clearly what we have to accomplish in the present-I am speaking of a ruthless criticism of everything existing, ruthless in two senses: The criticism must not be afraid of its own conclusions, nor of conflict with the powers that be. [Marx, "For a Ruthless Criticism ofEverything Existing " 13; emphasis in the original] diacritics / spring 1993 9</page><page sequence="9">The Critique of Idealism Beneath the jokes and anecdotes in Ziiek's book is a consistent critique of idealism. Two senses of the word idealism are important here: (1) idealism as in idealist philosophy, which holds that the object of external perception consists of ideas. Marx's critique of German idealism, for instance, is that it privileges the mind; (2) idealism as the act of idealizing-of envisioning and asserting goodness and perfection in the thing or person perceived. While the first of these senses is familiar to those who know Marx and Marxist criticism, it is, I think, the second sense of idealism that makes Zizek's work a timely response to the cultural politics of the post-Marxist world. We can define this response in the same terms that Zizek uses to describe Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe's Hegemony and Socialist Strategy: as a "political project based on an ethics of the real ..., an ethics of confrontation with an impossible, traumatic kernel not covered by any ideal (of the unbroken communication, of the invention of the self)" ["Beyond Discourse- Analysis" 259; emphasis in the original]. It would be impossible to understand this criticism of idealism-as-idealization without coming to terms with the distinction Zizek makes between imaginary and symbolic "identification."5 Imaginary identification is identification with the image, or identification based on an imagined resemblance with the image that can be seen. Symbolic identification, on the other hand, is identification with the gaze, with the place from which we appear in a certain way-likable or contemptible-to ourselves. Because it does not rely on imagistic resemblance, the significance of symbolic identification is often neglected. For Zizek, however, symbolic identification is the more profound of the two. The distinction between symbolic and imaginary identification leads him to call authors such as Dickens, who wrote about the common people in an idealized form, false: wefind the Dickensian admiration of the "good common people, "the imaginary identification with their poor but happy, close, unspoiled world, free of the cruel struggle for power and money. But (and therein lies the falsity of Dickens) from where is the Dickensian gaze peering at the "good common people " so that they appear likeable; from where if not from the point of view of the corrupted world of power and money? [SOI 107]6 Zizek's point is that the truth reveals itself negatively, not in the visible picture or image of Dickens's discourse, but in the place where there is no image, the place from which such "good" images of the common people are seen. This is the place of those who need to legitimize their domination and exploitation of others, those who disguise their aggressivity through the active invocation of a positive image that becomes, for Zizek, the symptom, the excess, the secret enjoyment of their lives. Another example of Zizek's way of problematizing identification is his interpreta- tion of Judas. For Zizek, Judas, "the bad guy," is the real tragic hero in the Jesus story because he is the negative limit necessary for the Jesus character to unfold in its positivity. Without Judas's "betrayal," the Jesus story could not be told. And Judas's sacrifice is pure: unlike Jesus, who gets to stay on in our hearts as the hero who saves us from our sins, Judas does not receive an afterlife. Judas dies twice, first physically and then symboli- 5. I have already read Spivak's "Can the Subaltern Speak?" in this light [see Chow, "Where Have All the Natives Gone?"]. The discussion in this section will therefore focus primarily on Zizek. 6. It is beyond the scope of the present essay to consider the relevance of this critique to the "English tradition " as advocated by "pro-life " critics like F. R. Leavis or to English literature's complicity with England's imperialism and colonialism. 10</page><page sequence="10">cally, as the traitor in the grand narrative of Christianity. We identify only with the good image-Jesus-whom we are supposed to emulate.7 Zizek's critique of idealism as idealization does not pertain only to writers and artists like Dickens and Brueghel or only to Christianity but also to totalitarianism. The ingenuity of Zizek's critique lies in the way it speaks as compellingly to the operational fantasies of communist regimes as it does to those of "democratic" ones. Moving characteristically back and forth between the "symptoms" of the religious and the secularized worlds, Zizek draws parallels between them such as the following, in which Judas in the Jesus story is likened to the victims forced to confess to their "crimes" under Stalin: Jesus used Judas as a means to attain his goal, knowing very well that his own suffering would be transformed into a model imitated by millions (imitatio Christi), while Judas's sacrifice is a pure loss without any narcissistic benefit. Perhaps he is a little like the faithful victims of the Stalinist monster trials who confessed their guilt, proclaimed themselves miserable scum, knowing that by so doing they were accomplishing the last and highest service to the Cause of the Revolution. [SOI 128]8 7. Zizek's reading of the Jesus-Judas teamwork has its predecessors in Robinson Jeffers's poem "Dear Judas, " Nikos Kazantzakis's novel The Last Temptation, and Martin Scorsese 'sfilm The Last Temptation of Christ, which was based on Kazantzakis's novel. Zizek's comment on Scorsese's film is that its theme is simply the hystericization of Jesus Christ himself; it shows us an ordinary, carnal, passionate man discovering gradually, with fascination and horror, that he is the son of God, bearer of the dreadful but magnificent mission to redeem humanity through his sacrifice. The problem is that he cannot come to terms with this interpellation: the meaning of his 'temptations' lies precisely in the hysterical resistance to his mandate, in his doubts about it, in his attempts to evade it even when he is already nailed to the cross. [SOI 114; emphasis in the original] 8. See also Zizek, "ActAs theLimit of DistributiveJustice, " in which he briefly discusses the trials of the Stalinist era as an explicit form of "cynical-utilitarian sacrificial logic": [T]he answer to the question "Did the prosecutors really believe in their victim's guilt?" is far more difficult and ambiguous than it may seem. A "true" Stalinist would probably say that, even if, on the level of immediate facts, the accused are innocent, they are all the more guilty on a deeper level of historical responsibility since, by the very insistence on their abstract-legal innocence, they have given preference to their individuality over the larger historical interests of the working class expressed in the will of the Party. [73] This discussion ofsacrificial logic ispart of a larger discussion of the relation between "repetition" and ethical "choice. "In an interesting essay on the Stalin myth in Soviet cinema, AndreBazin makes a similar point by showing the sacrificial imperative of Stalinism to be "a retroactive purge of History ": According to the Soviet "Stalinist" communist perspective, no one can "become" a traitor. That would imply that he wasn't always a traitor.... It was necessary to proceed with a retroactive purge of History, proving that the accused was, since birth, a willful traitor whose every act was satanically camouflaged sabotage .... As confession is indispensable to divine absolution, so solemn retraction is indispensable to the reconquering of historical virginity. [Bazin 37] diacritics / spring 1993 11</page><page sequence="11">A subtitle of Zizek's book could have been something like "an analysis of fascism from Church to Party." The most obvious criticism of fascism in the book is, of course, his analysis of anti-Semitic discourse, in which the "Jew" is evil personified. (I will return to this in the last section.) Equally important, however, are his countless jokes, comments, and anecdotes about what was traditionally fascism's opposite-communism. In a way that would certainly make leftist intellectuals in the liberal West squirm (since the criticism of fascism often means, for such intellectuals, an affirmation of communism), Zizek's text gives us example after example of the absurdity of totalitarian regimes that reign under the name of Marx and the common good, as for instance the Yugoslav student who was ordered to sign a free oath [165], Rosa Luxemberg's description of the revolutionary process [84], and the invincible Stalinist Communist who operates with the same fantasy logic as the cat in the Tom and Jerry cartoons ("a cat whose head is blown up by a dynamite and who, in the next scene, proceeds intact his pursuit [sic] of his class enemy, the mouse") [145]. Totalitarianism suits Zizek's critique of idealism more aptly than it suits anti- Semitism, not only because it relies on positive images but also because it relies on the image as positivistic evidence for its manipulation. Typical of totalitarian rule's self- representation and self-legitimation is a kind of language, verbal or visual, that proclaims/ presents a noble, respectable idea/image of "the people." The point of this kind of language is to seduce-to divert attention away from the rulers' violence and aggressivity at the same time that sympathy/empathy with the good idea/image is aroused. Totalitari- anism thus exemplifies the problematic of privileging imaginary identification that for Zizek lies at the heart of idealism. This idealism functions as if the conscious level of articulation/representation is all there is: We say/show this (good image), therefore, we are this (good). The success of such idealism comes from the collaboration of those who spontaneously identify with the things they consciously hear/see. Naming As Zizek understands it, totalitarianism is not an anomaly but rather the most palpable instance of the way ideology works in the secularized modern world: "the case of so-called 'totalitarianism' demonstrates what applies to every ideology, to ideology as such: the last support of the ideological effect (of the way an ideological network of signifiers 'holds' us) is the non-sensical, pre-ideological kernel of enjoyment" [SOI 124]. The closeness between Zizek's and Althusser's understanding of ideology-a closeness that has its roots in Lacan-is unmistakable. Like Althusser, Zizek explains the "interpellation" of the subject through Pascal, who is for both a major reference in thinking about Marxism. Althusser puts it this way: we are indebted to Pascal's defensive "dialectic" for the wonderful formula which will enable us to invert the order of the notional schema of ideology. Pascal says more or less: "Kneel down, move your lips in prayer, and you will believe." He thus scandalously inverts the order of things.... ... where only a single subject (such and such an individual) is concerned, the existence of the ideas of his belief is material in that his ideas are his material actions inserted into material practices governed by material rituals which are themselves defined by the material apparatus from which derive the ideas of that subject. [168-69; emphasis in the original] The point of what Zizek calls the Pascalian-Marxist argument is thus this: even if I cannot prove that there is a God/Great Leader, my (material) acting as if there were one would 12</page><page sequence="12">give me great practical benefits. I pray, then I believe; I support the Great Party Leader, then he exists. The submissive practices of the believers-what Althusser refers to as "material"-are what authenticate the "idea" of the Leader. Hence Zizek writes: it is as if the totalitarian Leader is addressing his subjects and legitimizing his power precisely by referring to the... Pascalian-Marxian argument-that is, revealing to them the secret of the classical Master; basically, he is saying to them: "I'm yourMaster because you treatme asyourMaster; it is you, with your activity, who make me your Master!" [SOI 146] Zizek goes further: this "People" on which the Leader bases his power does not really exist except in the form of a fetish, the fetish precisely of the Party and its Leader. In other words, totalitarianism functions in the form of a kind of circular definition of "the People": "in the Stalinist universe, 'supporting the rule of the Party' is 'rigidly designated' by the term 'People'-it is, in the last analysis, the only feature which in all possible worlds defines the People" [SOI 147; emphasis in the original]. But if Zizek's argument resembles Althusser's up to this point, he also parts company with Althusser in that he is not primarily interested in the subject. For Zizek, the subject's ideological interpellation is simply a way of illustrating something else-the surplus he calls "desire." How does he arrive at desire? In the phrase "the People always support the Party," the word "support" operates linguistically as well as symbolically. Besides the meaning of upholding a ruler, "support" is also synonymous with the "rigid designator," the term Zizek takes from antidescriptivist philosophy to refer to that act of naming which depends for its authen- tication on something more than the objective properties of the thing named. Using Saul Kripke's arguments in Naming and Necessity, Zizek explains the traditional division between the descriptivists and antidescriptivists as follows: while descriptivists regard "names" as referring to the immanent meanings of things, antidescriptivists regard "names" as referring to an external causal link, which allows things to be transmitted from subject to subject [SOI 90]. Zizek sides with the antidescriptivists not because he thinks they are entirely right but because their theory contains "libidinal" implications [SOI 91]. Although Kripke does not deal with affect as such, his understanding of naming as more than a straightforward correspondence between name and thing is a sign that there is more involved in naming than pure designation. This "more" is what Zizek calls "desire." The introduction of desire in the act of naming enables Zizek to make what I think is his most important argument, which is that naming, an act that is radically contingent, is a retroactive constitution of identity. Naming constitutes (a thing or a person's) identity, beyond ever-changing descriptive features, backwards in time. This point about naming is the point at which all of Zizek's arguments come together: 1. We can now say that the "traumatic kernel," the "surplus enjoyment," "excess," and "symptom" correspond to the name/designator/determinant that, while being entirely arbitrary and contingent (that is, nothing), nonetheless stabilizes and constitutes identity in a (chronologically) retroactive and/or (spatially) extimate fashion. ("L'extimite"- external intimacy-was a term coined by Jacques-Alain Miller.) 2. The "name" is that objet petit a which, while enabling the subject to enter the symbolic (by taking something from him, by "barring" or crossing him), remains afield, afloat, accidental. Rather than the object catching the name, it is the name that catches (the object) and makes "it" an object. 3. The "name" is also that visible, material practice/behavior that confers meaning on nothing; it is the act of praying that makes me believe; it is the "People" that "supports" the Party and its Leader. diacritics / spring 1993 13</page><page sequence="13">4. Finally, the "name" is the sublime object, the "matter" that has a body/materiality other than its physical qualities, a reality that is conjured retroactively-literally, after the act/name. Furthermore, naming is the place where both Zizek and Spivak attempt to plot an alternative ethics. And yet, because of the tricky nature of the problem, it is also the place where the greatest confusion arises. Zizek, by associating Kripke with Laclau and Mouffe, thinks that Kripke's theory of the "rigid designator" offers a theory similar to Laclau's "anti-essentialism": We can now see how the Kripkean theory of "rigid designator"-of a certain pure signifier which designates, and at the same time constitutes, the identity of a given object beyond the variable cluster of its descriptive properties-offers a conceptual apparatus enabling us to conceive precisely the status of Laclau's "anti-essentialism." [SOI 98] Here, in spite of his dislike for poststructuralism, Zizek talks rather like an antiessentialist poststructuralist, when in fact his own point, that the "rigid designator" constitutes the identity of an object beyond its nameable properties, does not callfor dispensing with the name, a kind of "essence," itself. (This is why he always emphasizes, as does Lacan in his later writings, the importance of the Thing: some form of identity always takes place.) Even though it is impossible in its "designation," the act of "naming" is also, we may say, unavoidable. (We do not have a choice not to name.) That this, rather than Laclau and Mouffe's "anti-essentialism," is Zizek's real argument is indicated by the example he often uses, that of the name "democracy." Laclau and Mouffe's point is that while the name "democracy" seems to designate a certain kind of reality, it is impossible to know what democracy is. But, for Zizek, this does not mean that we should throw out the name, because, as Winston Churchill put it, democracy is our worst possible system, but none of the others is better [SOI 5; 148]. When it comes to naming, Spivak, a strong advocate of our necessity from time to time to "risk essentialism," also makes odd-sounding statements: A deconstructive awareness would insistently be aware that the masterwords are catachreses . .. that there are no literal referents, there are no "true" examples of the "true worker," the "true woman," the "true proletarian." [PCC 104] Basically I learned first from de Man and then from Derrida the importance of reading absolutely literally. And of course the word "literally" is like the word "history. "Like any master word, it is a catachretical word. [PCC 163] The subaltern is all that is not elite, but the trouble with those kinds of names is that ifyou have any kind ofpolitical interestyou name it in the hope that the name will disappear. That's what class consciousness is in the interest of: the class disappearing. What politically we want to see is that the name would not be possible. [PCC 158] As I was saying when you asked me, didn't I ally myself with the subaltern. I said by no means, I noticed myself as a namer of the subaltern. The subaltern is a name as "woman " in Derrida, or "power " in Foucault, and the name comes with an anxiety that if the political program gets anywhere the name will disappear. [PCC 166] 14</page><page sequence="14">In these passages, names-catachreses or master words-are regarded as merely strained, inadequate expressions; the supposition is that naming would lead to its opposite-the disappearance of the names. This, however, is quite different from the kind of argument Spivak otherwise makes when she is not specifically talking about naming. Consider the following passage, for instance: As Derrida says, and now I am quoting, "Logocentrism is not a pathology," it is the thing that enables us-except, if because it enables us, we say that it is correct, it would be a mistake. That is all he is saying. So that, in fact, all that he looks at is the way in which the subject centers itself. He is not decentering the subject.... There is no way that a subject can be anything but centered ... the fact that the subject is centered begins with that kind of an un-endorsable error. That doesn 't mean that the subject can be decentered. There is no such thing as the decentered subject. There is no such thing. [PCC 146] Isn't the point of this passage that the center is always necessary? Isn't Spivak's argument for risking essentialism that the essentialist moment is the irreducible part of any discourse? And isn't "naming" precisely the centering, the essentializing act? For a deconstructionist, names are not "simply" catachreses; catachreses are not "simply" catachreses: Whenever someone attempts to put together a "theory of practice " where the intending subject as absolute ground isput into question, catachrestical master- words become necessary, because language can never fully bypass the presup- position of such a ground. The particular word is, in such a case, the best that will serve, but also, and necessarily, a misfit.... It must be said, however, that these master-words are misfits only if the ordinary use of language is presup- posed to have fully fitting cases. [Spivak, "Poststructuralism" 241-42n20] In other words, since "misfit" is the general condition of all language, catachreses, while embodying this general condition, also perform the additional but indispensable task of posing as the "absolute ground." Yet, in spite of her careful articulations of the way language works, when it comes specifically to naming, Spivak, like Zizek, becomes strangely "antiessentialist," thus letting poststructuralism's discursivism, of which both of them are otherwise so astutely critical, gain the upper hand. Between Love and the Void The ambivalence about "naming," it follows, is also an ambivalence about "history." Here Spivak and Zizek embark on completely different journeys. In a moment when she is defending deconstruction, Spivak criticizes the popular view that deconstruction is decadent and negative, while Marxism is activist and about class struggle [PCC 130]. She shows, for instance, how the seeming negativity of Derrida's critique of anthropomorphism can in fact lead one back into history: When Derrida criticized Sartre's anthropomorphic re-reading of Heidegger, that critique of anthropomorphism was picked up in two ways, and over the last almost twentyyears, we 've seen itgoing in two directions within the deconstructive establishment. One has been for the critic to say, "Do not look in itfor a human story, but rather for the text's constitution of its own textuality or narrativity. " Another, which has been Derrida's track, has been to say: "Look here, it is diacritics / spring 1993 15</page><page sequence="15">almost as if the sign, anthropos, has no history." [PCC 53; emphasis in the original] In other words, either antianthropomorphism can lead to a reification of the text, or it can alert us to the limits of a specifically constructed history and thus to the possibility of other histories. Here, in her most persuasive defense of deconstruction, Spivak reintroduces something that one does not usually associate with it-a (Marxist) human- ism for which man is the original subject and object. The deconstruction of human history that Spivak calls for does not depart from the basic belief in humans as animals whose "productive" activity distinguishes them from the rest of the universe. Depending on the type of philosopher, that activity can be construed as "sensuous experience" or "con- sciousness," as "manual labor" or"intellectual labor," as "agriculture" or "language." But no matter how emphatic it is about the human condition as a "perverse" condition,9 deconstruction's stern gaze at words-human verbal language-means that it continues to operate within the parameters of a subscription to the primacy of human endeavor, human consciousness, human language, and human history."1 It is therefore not an accident that Spivak sees the absolute relevance of deconstruction to the work of the Indian Subaltern Studies historians. As writing, the lives of the subalterns are paradigmatic of the logic of "the dangerous supplement," the sign that not only adds but also substitutes." Even though Spivak must read the Subaltern Studies historians against their grain and demonstrate how, despite their apparently positivistic intention-to restore the voices of the oppressed classes and thus to instigate an alternative history of postcolonial India-these historians are already being thoroughly deconstructive [Spivak, "Subaltern Studies: Deconstructing Historiography"], the affin- ity between deconstruction and Subaltern historiography is clear once we understand that the practice of deconstruction itself is potentially humanistic. The writing of an alternative history from the perspective of the subalterns does not detract from the basic view of humans as the primary creators/producers of value. Rather than alerting us to humans as destructive instead of productive forces or to the frequent indistinguishability between human productiveness and destructiveness-as would be the case when deconstruction is exercised on such issues as ecological concerns or animal rights-the welding of deconstruction and historiography means that the negativity of deconstruction takes on a positive function. This is how Spivak speaks of Derrida's more recent "affirmative deconstruction": it is a deconstruction that obliges you to "say yes to that which interrupts your project," to the "political" that interrupts "theory" [PCC 47]. Most important, affirmative deconstruction enables the continual practice of "history."'2 Zizek's view of politics and history is decidedly different. He does not give the negativity of his formalism a positive affirmation. Instead, what he affirms is negativity 9. This, for instance, is Derrida's reading of apartheid in South Africa: "racism always betrays the perversion of a man, the 'talking animal"' ["Racism's Last Word" 331]. 10. "[l]n order to make any kind of ethical decision you have to assume that there is such a thing as just the human being .... If an ethical question cannot be entertained on that basis then it is not an ethical decision; then it is a decision that is in fact situational" [Spivak, "Reflections on Cultural Studies" 69; emphasis in the original]. 11. One is thus not surprised to find that the word "subaltern" is "already" in Derrida's formulation of the supplement: "Compensatory [suppleant] and vicarious, the supplement is an adjunct, a subaltern instance which takes-(the)-place [tient-lieu]." (TheFrench original: "Suppleant et vicaire, le supplement est un adjoint, une instance subalterne qui tient-lieu. ") [Of Grammatology 145; De la grammatologie (Paris: Minuit, 1967) 208; emphasis in the original]. 12. Joan Scott: "Once we recognize the limits of representation, is history possible? The answer ... is decidedly yes" ["Comment" 174]. Scott is responding to Spivak's "Feminism and Decolonization. " 16</page><page sequence="16">itself-or what he calls, after Laclau and Mouffe, antagonism. For Zizek negativity is an internal limit, a hindrance intrinsic to an organism and its drive. "Positive" social happenings in history are what give shape and form to this immanent negativity. Understanding the immanent nature of this negative limit amounts to an ethics that refuses to idealize the reconciliation of social antagonisms and that, instead, accepts their permanence. The ultimately irreducible character of such antagonisms is for Zizek the traumatic Real. Zizek's insistence on the immanence of negation is a compelling way of critiquing the "excesses" of human history. The paradigmatic case here is anti-Semitism, in which what we cannot afford to admit about ourselves we personify externally as the "Jew." In this age-old custom of collective discrimination, the "Jew" is the embodiment of whatever we must insist we are not. Like "woman" in Lacan, the Jew is for Zizek the figure of the impossible, the "symptom" of the reflexive determinant that is "man" or "non-Jew." We can add to the list of such "symptoms" the Japanese, the Moslems, patients with AIDS, and so forth. The point is, their "secret" lies in our desire not to recognize something about ourselves. The strength of Zizek's work, then, lies not in his offering us a model with which to think and act but in his absolute (general) attack on specific historical instances (anti- Semitism, fascism, totalitarianism). Because his point is not "history" in its specific forms (such as nations, periods, genders, classes, and so on), it would be uselessly tautological to fault him on that count. Instead, his point is a transhistorical one, namely, that there is a lack in the Other. It is transhistorical in the sense that this "lack" is present whenever history (in its specific forms) is present. This is how he puts it: Today, it is a commonplace that the Lacanian subject is divided, crossed-out, identical to a lack in a signifying chain. However, the most radical dimension of Lacanian theory lies not in recognizing this fact but in realizing that the big Other, the symbolic order itself is also barre, crossed-out, by a fundamental impossibility, structured around an impossible/traumatic kernel, around a central lack. Without this lack in the Other, the Other would be a closed structure and the only possibility open to the subject would be his radical alienation in the Other. So it is precisely this lack in the Other which enables the subject to achieve a kind of "de-alienation" called by Lacan separation: not in the sense that the subject experiences that now he is separated for ever from the object by the barrier of language, but that the object is separated from the Other itself, that the Other itself "hasn't got it", hasn't got the final answer- that is to say, is in itself blocked, desiring; that there is also a desire of the Other. This lack in the Other gives the subject-so to speak-a breathing space, it enables him to avoid the total alienation in the signifier not byfilling out his lack but by allowing him to identify himself, his own lack, with the lack in the Other. [SOI 122; emphases in the original] Zizek's is an ethics of limits, which is based on the understanding of the fundamental schism between God and man (and between man and language) as we find it in Judaism: is not the Jewish God the purest embodiment of this "Che vuoi? ", of the desire of the Other in its terrifying abyss, with the formalprohibition to "make an image of God"-to fill out the gap of the Other's desire with a positive fantasy- scenario ?... The basic position of a Jewish believer is, then, that ofJob: not so much lamentation as incomprehension, perplexity, even horror at what the Other (God) wants with the series of calamities thatare being inflicted upon him. [SOI 115] diacritics / spring 1993 17</page><page sequence="17">The "lack" of the Other is not simply a lack in the sense of an empty hole; it is also the impossibility/refusal of answer, the absolute limit that separates us and the Other, making the question "Che vuoi?" an unanswerable one. This "lack" of the Other is a question of/about the Other that remains fathomless and untamable, irreconcilable with and indifferent to symbolization, gentrification, or domestication through sacrifice and love as we find it in the dogmatic, missionary versions of institutionalized Christianity. We may safely say that Zizek is, ultimately, not so much concerned with "history" and "politics" as with human nature. Consider the notion of "antagonism," which he takes from Laclau and Mouffe, who use it to say "the social doesn't exist." The notion of "antagonism," we must remember, operates ambivalently, both as a negative charge and/ or as a voiding. It is, I think, the latter sense that speaks most closely to Zizek. This is why he emphasizes the distinction between social and radical antagonism: We must then distinguish the experience of antagonism in its radicalform, as a limit of the social, as the impossibility around which the socialfield is structured, from antagonism as the relation between antagonistic subject-positions: in Lacanian terms, we must distinguish antagonism as realfrom the social reality of the antagonistic fight. And the Lacanian notion of the subject aims precisely at the experience of "pure" antagonism as self-hindering, self-blockage, this internal limit preventing the symbolic field from realizing its full identity: the stake of the entire process of subjectivation, of assuming different subject- positions, is ultimately to enable us to avoid this traumatic experience. [Zizek, "Beyond Discourse-Analysis" 253; emphasis in the original] Radical antagonism is the pure Real that cannot be negated: the Real is something that cannot be negated, a positive inert datum which is insensitive to negation, cannot be caught in the dialectics of negativity; but we must add at once that it is so because the Real itself; in its positivity, is nothing but an embodiment of a certain void, lack, radical negativity. It cannot be negated because it is already in itself, in its positivity, nothing but an embodi- ment of a pure negativity, emptiness. [SOI 170; emphasis in the original] Putting it in another way: the reality of social antagonism is only a partial manifestation of radical antagonism. The historical and political events of conflict and struggle are mere fantasies that at once shield the Real and shield (protect) us from it: it is not the external enemy who is preventing me from achieving identity with myself, but every identity is already in itselfblocked, marked by an impossibility, and the external enemy is simply the small piece, the rest of reality upon which we "project" or "externalize" this intrinsic, immanent impossibility. [Zizek, "Beyond Discourse-Analysis" 251-52; my emphasis] In ways that remind us of the nonbeing/nothingness that is often taught in Eastern philosophies such as Buddhism, radical antagonism would thus seem to be the void of social/material life itself. But unlike the case argued by Laclau and Mouffe, "the social doesn't exist" not because the antagonisms persisting among social spheres are multiple and infinite, but because the sentient aspects of human life, the joys and sufferings we inevitably experience as parts of our social existence, are themselves illusory. According to institutional records of Buddhist history, it was precisely by alluding to this basic void of human life that the Chinese monk Hui Neng (better known as Wei Lang, 638-713 C.E.) proved that he had attained the Essence of the Mind. Hui Neng, an 18</page><page sequence="18">illiterate seller of firewood in South China, had traveled far to pay respects to the Fifth Patriarch at the time when the latter was looking for someone to hand over the robe (the insignia of the Patriarchate) and the Dharma (the esoteric teaching of the Dhyana School). The Fifth Patriarch's requirement was that this person had to have understood the Essence of the Mind. Shen Xiu, one of his outstanding disciples, tried to demonstrate his attainment of spiritual insight by writing the following stanza: The body is the Bodhi-tree, - a i The mind is the bright mirror-stand. , ,- , Take heed always to wipe it clean, i A h t4. di So that no dust collects on it. &gt;7 - /4 " By drawing an analogy between the material and immaterial aspects of life, Shen Xiu, we might say, establishes an ethics of achieving enlightenment through active intervention. In spite of Shen Xiu's brilliance, however, the Fifth Patriarch did not consider him to have attained the Essence of the Mind. By contrast, when the commoner Hui Neng unexpect- edly composed his stanza, the Fifth Patriarch knew he had, and made him the Sixth Patriarch. Hui Neng's stanza goes as follows: The Bodhi-tree is originally not a tree,4 Nor is the bright mirror originally a stand. it ,' -J t Since there is originally no-thing, - i , , I. - From where arises all this dust?'3 , ., The ethics established by Hui Neng's stanza is that of achieving enlightenment through recognizing the no-thing-ness of the world rather than through doing something to correct the world's problems. According to legend, then, it is Hui Neng's intuitive grasp of our original void that distinguished him from others. We might interpret the point of this story to be that life is beyond all human interventions, including (especially) well- intentioned and morally righteous ones. Hui Neng's stanza ends not with a truth but with a question. Zizek would call this "the eternal philosophical question," to which he thinks Lacan makes a response: in the final years of Lacan's teaching we find a kind of universalization of the symptom: almost everything that is becomes in a way symptom, so thatfinally even woman is determined as the symptom of man. We can even say that "symptom " is Lacan 'sfinal answer to the eternalphilosophical question "Why is there something instead of nothing? "-this "something" which "is" instead of nothing is indeed the symptom. [SOI 72] The symptom, we might say, is the avoiding of the void through desire. But as we also learn from the ancients, the void is unavoidable. That is why desire, which is often the desire to possess (things) as such, is always insatiable. 13. These events are told in the chapter "Autobiography" in The Sutra of Hui Neng. The two stanzas are on pages 15 and 18 respectively; translation from the Chinese modified. Wong Mou- lam, the first translator of the Sutra into English, described Hui Neng's Sutra in these terms: of all the Chinese works which have been canonized in the Tripitaka, this standard work of the Dhyana School is the only one that bears the designation of "Sutra," a designation which is reserved for the sermons of Lord Buddha and those of great Bodhisattvas. Hence, it is not without justification to call it, as some one does, "the only Sutra spoken by a native of China." [Sutra 9] diacritics / spring 1993 19</page><page sequence="19">Perhaps it is the perception of the unavoidability of the void-which also means, paradoxically, the eternal return of the symptom-that prompts Spivak to look to history for a possible freedom from the void's tyranny. History here is no longer the master narrative; instead it is differance, supplementary writing, and other-ing.14 History offers, however temporarily, the hope of reconstruction, reinvention, redemption. Hence even though her characteristic move when talking about texts, including the original texts of Marx, is that of voiding-of emphasizing postponement, deferral, failure, nonfulfillment, and "impossibility" ["SSQV" 175; "SRM" 58]-Spivak's final message is one of an ethical affirmation of the historical and social as the site of struggle against exploitation. This affirmative ethics leads Spivak to describe her own relation to both deconstruction and Subaltern historiography in terms of love: deconstruction ... is the critical moment, the reminder of catachresis, the reminder of the politics of the open end, or of the politics of great-narrative, depending on what the moment asks for, the reminder of the fact that any really "loving" politicalpractice must fall a prey to its own critique. [PCC 111] The only things one really deconstructs are things into which one is intimately mired. It speaks you. You speak it. [PCC 135] I really read the Subalternists with that kind of love that I was talking about ... so that some of the opponents of Subaltern Studies in India think of me as a Subalternist; on the other hand the Subalternists realize... that I don't endorse everything in their project. [PCC 142] This relationship of love, which is the deconstructive relationship-you cannot deconstruct something which is not your own language. [PCC 164] With equal energy, Zizek would call his relationship to the void/the Real one of "enthusiastic resignation": [T]he signifying field is always structured around a certain fundamental deadlock. This deadlock doesn't entail any kind of resignation-or, if there is a resignation, it is a paradox of the enthusiastic resignation: we are using here the term 'enthusiasm' in its strict Kantian meaning, as indicating an experience of the object through the very failure of its adequate representation. Enthusiasm and resignation are not then two opposed moments: it is the "resignation " itself, i.e. the experience of a certain impossibility, which incites enthusiasm. [Zizek, "Beyond Discourse-Analysis" 259-60; emphasis in the original] In other words, the apprehension of the world as void does not lead to existentialist angst and revolt or thereby a new assertion of the meaningfulness of human endeavor. Rather, the void stands as the source of a distinct form of passion, the passion of an indomitable "as if': although defeat is imminent, one goes on enthusiastically as if one doesn't know it-indeed, as if one's entire life force actually comes from this defeat. Between love and the void, between affirmative deconstruction and enthusiastic resignation, the question is neither one of choice nor of alliance. It is the confrontation 14. See Spivak's reading ofMarx's Eleventh Thesis on Feuerbach, in which shepoints out that Marx, in his callfor the need "to change " the world, had actually written zu verandern, the infinitive of the German verb which literally means "to make other" ["Subaltern Studies: Deconstructing Historiography" 208]. 20</page><page sequence="20">of ultimately incompatible but equally insuppressible logics, whose intensities are, at every juncture, provokingly instructive.
