<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ONE OF PLOT-IN US AND THE GOD OF ARISTOTLE JOHN M. RIST X LOTiNus criticized Aristotle for making a self-thinking mind the first principle of the universe.1 His major objection is that any mind, if engaged in thinking, must be thinking of something, and thus mind cannot be a simple entity. In the case of the Aristotelian mind Plotinus argues that not only is there the duality of subject and object, the thinker and the thought, but that the thought itself is a multiplicity. We recognize it as a limited plurality, that is, the Platonic world of Forms, the intelligible world.2 Like all else that is plural, it has a quasi-material component (as Aristotle had pre scribed) called "intelligible matter." 3 All this might be of only antiquarian interest, the ramifications of a supposedly long-outworn metaphysic. But Plotinus' critique of Aristotle and consequent development of his own position present a number of features of wider interest. First of all, in contrast to much preceding Greek "theology," Plotinus' One may not be anthro pomorphic. Early Greek philosophers, like Xenophanes, had criti cized the poets and mythologists on this score,4 but Plato and Aristotle, in their different ways, are similarly open to attack. For Aristotle mind is (or is primarily) what makes each of us a man, rather than an animal.5 Men cannot, it is true, use their minds on the non-contingent all the time; gods can. But the difference looks to be one of degree, not of kind. Mind may perhaps come "from outside," 6 that is, not be part of the body-soul complex, and have an eternal existence in some form, but that only emphasizes the essential similarity of the "human" and the "divine" mind. And in Aristotle all the evidence for the working of mind comes from an examination of human psychology, and from a theory about 1 Cf.

Cf. Met. 1070A24.</page><page sequence="2">76 JOHN M. RIST the way in which we think. The results of this analysis are then applied, in a perfect form, to God. Aristotle's active intellect, dif ferent in each individual man,7 looks so like the Prime Mover that the better commentators have often failed to distinguish them. Certainly they should be distinguished, but the commentator can hardly be blamed for failing to do so, when he is faced with the difficulty, very real to him at least, that otherwise Aristotle would come near to postulating a non-identity of indiscernibles?except that the Prime Mover is in some sense a bigger and better example of mind than the active intellect.8 And Aristotle's problem is Plato's too. No one has yet explained satisfactorily why Plato distinguishes so sharply?for example in the myth of the Phaedrus? between souls and gods. That there must be a difference is clear enough ; souls may fall, gods do not. But how can a fall be possible when a purified soul (conversant with the Forms and the Good) looks so like a god? Plotinus, of course, does not accuse Aristotle of anthropomor phism, but an attack on a form of anthropomorphism is one of the effects of his critique. Nous (the divine mind) is not like the One ; it does not live the same life ; it does not do the same things or, as Plotinus would put it, have the same activities. But surely Nous is identified with the One in the "Mystical Union," as uNous loving?"9 Only by abandoning its intellectual activity: Nous loving is dis tinguished from Nous thinking. Soul too and even our souls may "become like" the One in union, but here the language Plotinus uses is still more informative. The soul ceases to be itself (6.9.11. 11-12). When it sees the Forms, when it is "identified" with Nous, it is still itself. When it attains to the One, it has a different kind of life, a life which is inexpressible but can be experienced. I do not intend to explore the epistemological aspects of this idea. What I want to 7 Cf. J. M. Rist, "Notes on De Anima 3.5," CP 61 (1966) 8, reprinted in Essays in Ancient Greek Philosophy (Albany, 1971), p. 506. 8 Of course if Aristotle always postulated a plurality of unmoved movers and was consistently "polyth?iste" (as argued by P. Merlan, 'Aristotle's Unmoved Movers," Traditio 4 (1946) 1-30), the problem of indiscernibility arises more acutely,?Plotinus seems to have an inkling of this at Ennead 5.1.9.26?but most of his commentators, and normally Plotinus himself, have read him "tnonotheistically." 9 For the phrase see Ennead 6.7.35.24.

But, it may be objected, the One does have certain kinds of activity that are like ours; after all it is capable of "intensive think ing" (Karap?rjo-Ls) or higher thinking.10 But this kind of language, implied not uncommonly throughout the Enneads, in fact tells an unusual story. Where Aristotle's God is mind?and we too have a mind, though perhaps a less powerful one?Plotinus, agreeing of course that we have a mind, and that "thinking" tells us something about the nature of the One, insists not that the One has a better or more effective mind, but that its "mental" activity is of a different kind (vorjaei ?r?pws fj Kara tyjp vov v?rjtnv). In order to understand what Plotinus wants to do, and why he objects to the Aristotelian first principle in more detail, let us look back at the Metaphysics itself. After that we can approach some of Plotinus' criticisms in context. It has frequently been pointed out that Aristotle's concept of God depends on his following a single line of inquiry: he wants to account for the existence of motion. He thinks that he needs an unmoved first mover (or unchanged first changer) and he therefore posits such a being. Faced with determining its characteristics, he has little difficulty in deciding that it must exist in actuality (1072B) rather than as a mere potentiality. Its activity must be concerned with what is best and it must be the best kind of activity. This, the major assumption, for Aristotle is thinking. And since it must think of the most eternal and valuable thing (1074B25), it must only think of itself. There is no argument that thought is the most valuable activity, but we know the reason for Aristotle's view ; it is thought that separates us men from the higher animals ; it is a faculty which only men (and gods, if any) possess. Aristotle not only as sumes that thought is a sine qua non of human existence, but also that it is the most important activity of human existence. In its highest and purest form it is in contact with the unchanging ; hence it is the unchanging; hence it is divine (Oeiov) ; and (perhaps), if it is divine, the gods (or God) must possess it. 10 5.4.2.17; 6.8.16.33.</page><page sequence="4">78 JOHN M. RIST So far the argument looks direct, and simple, but on one point at least Aristotle has his doubts. Knowledge, perception, opinion and thought (?iavoia) seem to be of something else, he argues, and only in a subsidiary sense (?v wap?py ) of themselves (1074B36-37). Hence the problem: the thinking of God is of itself primarily; it would thus appear to be different in kind. But Aristotle regards this as soluble. In the contemplative sciences (?wl r v dec?pyjTLKcov) it is the act of thinking itself which is the object of thought. It is hard to see that this is argued, however, rather than assumed; indeed Aristotle seems to be assuming exactly what he needs to prove. We have already noticed one aspect of Plotinus' critique. Mind must have an object and that object is itself a plurality, the world of Forms. Let us now look at the second aspect of Aristotle's position, the matter of self-consciousness. Aristotle, as we saw, assumes that mental activities involving knowledge of externals involve (or perhaps may involve) knowledge of the process of knowledge incidentally. In the De Anima he raises the question of how we perceive that we see and hear, and decides that we perceive that we see and hear through the same organs as those by which we see and hear (425B12ff). But the question is not of great concern. He does not raise problems about the quality of our perceptions insofar as they may be affected (adversely) by our awareness of what we are doing. Perhaps this is because he not only thinks that the same organ is involved, but also that the activity (as an accidental) is comparatively unimpor tant.lt cannot disturb the quality of the perception itself. Certainly Aristotle does not seem to regard it as a matter of doing two things at once, for that could certainly be distracting, and Aristotle recog nizes it to be so in the Nicomachean Ethics. You cannot do philos ophy and enjoy listening to flute-playing at the same time (1175B4). It is curious to notice that Plotinus' position is exactly contrary to Aristotle's. According to Porphyry at least, it is possible in one important sense to engage in two activities at the same time, pro vided one is genuinely concerned with both of them. Plotinus himself was able to concentrate his mind on the real at the same time as he was performing various necessary but mundane duties of ordinary life.11 The justification for this attitude lay, for Plotinus 11 Porphyry, Vita Plotini 8-9; cf. Ennead 1.4.13.</page><page sequence="5">THE ONE OF PLOTINUS 79 and Porphyry, in the notion of the double psychology of man, the inner and outer man. As for- the question of awareness of one's behavior, there is an impressive discussion in Ennead 1.4.9. Plotinus begins with the seemingly paradoxical assertion that happiness is possible even if a man loses consciousness through illness or the effects of magic. Such things only effect his "outer" self, as does sleep. His inner self is active all the while and unaffected. The scene is thus set for the question : is the good man better off if he is aware (a?adap?fxepos) that he is good? No, says Plotinus, his aware ness makes no difference. A man is equally healthy or equally handsome whether or not he is aware of the fact. And with wisdom the case is similar. But surely, runs the objection, it is of the essence of wisdom to be self-aware. Plotinus' answer to this is that if wisdom were something introduced into a man from outside (eiraKrov), the argument might make sense, but since it is always present, and present as an active substance, it makes no difference whether our outer self, our body-soul complex, is aware or not. There is an awareness, apparently, at the level of pure soul, which "we," because of the body, cannot now apprehend. In the next chapter Plotinus pursues the matter further. So far it looks as though he is arguing unambiguously for a self-awareness of mind which "we," the body-soul complex, miss. He then pro ceeds to explain that awareness of intellectual activity arises "in us" when the mind is reflexive and when the soul is peaceful enough to exhibit mental-pictures (&lt;t&gt;apTacr?ai) of the workings of the mind. But these mental-pictures do not necessarily accompany the activity of the mind12?and when they do not, we obviously are not "aware" of our thinking. Does Plotinus then go further in the direction of a total rejection of the necessity of a "self-awareness" of the mind? That is, does he want to say that it adds nothing to the power of the mind if we say "N (Nous) is aware that it is thinking its objects" rather than "N is thinking its objects?" The move might look Aristotelian except that the Plotinian mind has content, the Forms. But it is not clear whether Plotinus wishes to make it. He does draw our attention to the fact that awareness of such an activity as reading when we read, or of courageous behavior when we are 12 Cf. 4.3.30.5.</page><page sequence="6">80 JOHN M. RIST courageous, may detract from and enfeeble the activity itself. It is when we are really concentrating on our activity that we cease to be aware that we are doing it. The stage is certainly set for the asser tion that self-awareness would indeed be unnecessary for Nous and would add nothing to the scope of its activities. For thinking is not merely of thinking but of objects of thought. Plotinus has in effect more or less banished the problem of self-awareness to the lower soul (to the faculty of perception), though he does not formally say so. The interest in the comparison with Aristotle is that Plotinus is fully aware of the problem of self-awareness, but argues that far from its being the major characteristic of mind, it ceases to exist on that level?at least in the variety we know at the level of perception.13 In Chapter six of his Concept of Mind (London 1949) Gilbert Ryle argued inter alia that we get to know ourselves in much the same way as we get to know other people ; and this is a thesis, which, with certain modifications which we need not discuss here, is both widely accepted and apparently useful. One of its implications is that we are able to objectify ourselves, and that the process of under standing is inseparable from such objectification. As we grow up from the infant who makes very little distinction between himself and the external world, our mental development is thus marked by an increase in our ability to distinguish ourselves, to be ourselves, both the subject and object of thought. Thus understanding neces sarily involves, in Plotinus' language, the development first in un conscious and later in conscious form of a strong sense of self-aware ness. If this thesis about human growth and the development of the understanding has merit, does it follow that Plotinus' account of the transcendence of self-consciousness is of its nature stultifying? Plotinus is certainly arguing that self-consciousness is something to outgrow. The comparison with Ryle brings Plotinus' theory out into clear perspective. For Ryle, whose concept of development is obviously less "spiritual" and more biological than Plotinus would like, we become aware of what we are, we grow as human beings, by recog nizing ourselves as like other people, but different existentially from them. For Plotinus such a process will certainly lead to an emphasis 18 For this see 5.3.3.</page><page sequence="7">THE ONE OF PLOTINUS 81 on the duality of the intellect and will thus ultimately be a hindrance to advance to union with the One. Yet it is important to notice that Plotinus does not reject the objectifying stage in human prog ress. Self-awareness, not in the sense of awareness of what we are doing, but in the sense of knowing our origin?and the consequent identification with Mind with its concomitant plurality?is a neces sary stage in human development. For while Plotinus disagrees with Aristotle about the primacy of mind, he agrees that the de velopment of mind in man is a sine qua non of human progress. Like Aristotle Plotinus holds that without intellectual life (with its ultimate limitations) man's highest capabilities cannot be realized. Just as when attacking the Gnostics, Plotinus insists that ordinary "bourgeois" morality, ordinary decent behavior, is a stage, a neces sary albeit limited stage, of the progress of man to intellectual life (2.9.15),14 so when concerning himself with a higher life than that of the mind, he refuses the seductive notion that the use of the mind is unnecessary. Self-knowledge is necessary, but it is a stage, and a mere aware ness of the self's existence still leaves us at the level of duality, unable to be in contact with the One. And, as we have seen, it is an activity which may impede other activities. In the One it is transcended ; hence it can be transcended in us. Mind thinking is an inferior state to mind loving, mind going out beyond itself, and Plotinus' frequent use of the notion of "divine drunkenness" serves to indicate the unselfconcerning nature of the higher reality. If there is to be anything which involves any kind of "intellectual" activity, any kind of knowing, at the level of the One, some term which suggests a total transparency, a state of being aware, will have to be pressed into service. Plotinus makes a number of suggestions along these lines. He toys with the term Karap?rjais (5.4.2.17), where the Kara could per haps suggest intensity, in a treatise which is number 7 of Porphyry's chronological list; and in the same treatise he says that the One is "transparent to itself" (waPTrj foaKpiriKbp ?avrov). In 6.8.16 (chrono logically 33) he proposes virepp?rjais,1* but perhaps again all that is 14 Cf. 1.2.3. 16 Cf. 6.8.18.26.</page><page sequence="8">82 JOHN M. RIST clear is that he wants to indicate that some kind of thinking different from that of mind and in some way self-perceptive (olop crvpcuaOrjaei, 5.4.2.18-19) is still available, and that it is not only different but different in kind. But there is no real explanation.16 Finally, in 6.7.3.8-9 he seems to settle on the Epicurean technical term "contact" (eTn?oXrj) to designate the unique mode of knowing that the One has of itself, and at 6.8.11.23 and 3.8.9.20 the experience that we can have of the One. But these passages hardly help us to see what precisely is involved, and though the notion of "contact" would certainly reflect Plotinus' view that the language of touch is often more appropriate than the language of vision to describe the rela tionship between the elevated soul and the One, the purely material variety of contact advocated by Epicurus in his use of epibole cannot help us to attain a much closer degree of precision. So let us now turn for help to some further implications of Plotinus' break with the tradition originating with Aristotle. For Aristotle, as we have seen, mind is the highest reality, both in the cosmos and in man. It is specifically said to be the most valuable. Hence Aristotle seems to believe, though we cannot not argue it here, that it is in virtue of their possession of intelligence that men possess whatever intrinsic value they have. For Plotinus the case must be different; for Plotinus it is in virtue of the ultimate derivation from the One that everything has value. This is exhibited in the notion that the mere existence of a subject indicates that it possesses good ness, and hence value,17 as well as something of the "contemplative" faculty which is not identified with intellect and hence can be shared by things both living and non-living, even those which do not possess intellect (3.8.1.1). The way is clear for a recognition of the value, derived from the fact that all is the product of the One, of everything that exists?this is precisely the point that Plotinus wishes to argue strongly against the Gnostics and other denigrators of the physical universe. For Plato such a position could only be adopted with less enthusiasm, for even in the Timaeus, where Plato is at his least dualistic, the fact that "matter" exists independently of the Demiurge, and of the Forms which are his models, militates against the good 16 Cf. J. M. Rist, Plotinus (Cambridge, 1967) 42-52. 17 5.5.9.36; cf. 1.8.6.27.</page><page sequence="9">THE ONE OF PLOTINUS 83 ness of material objects. Plotinus is enabled to overcome this ob jection by reading the Timaeus in his own unplatonic way as teach ing the derivation of matter from the One. Plotinus finds in the world other traces of the One than intellect. He is, of course, not prepared to say that the One is F, G, H,18 for he fears that to say "x is F" is to say that x is to be identified with F, or to exclude G, H, etc. Predication is a "logical" technique to be used primarily to describe the Forms whose Beauty is (perfectly) beautiful, where F-ness is F. But although Plotinus does not wish to say that the One is intellect or intellectual, he still wishes to associate some kind of "mental" power with it, though not exclu sively. Here is the real import of the rejection of Aristotelianism. For Aristotle, although "God" is reached as the last in a series of causes designed to explain the phenomena of movement?and in this Aristotle is following and developing the Plato of the Laws and the Phaedrus?he is immediately identified as mind. For Plotinus, now that mind is dethroned, it can be argued that other faculties and other modes of description may be useful, if not more useful, to the enquirer into the nature of a first principle. Now at last we should consider some of these and see what they add up to. The first and most obvious is that of maker or "creator." Plotinus does not, of course, believe in the creation of the cosmos in time, but in its eternity. Worlds come and go in endless succession. But they are held in existence by the One, and without the One nothing can exist. There is no pre-existent material substrate, the Timaeus notwithstanding. Or rather the Timaeus is re-interpreted. This doctrine cannot be over-emphasized. It separates Plotinus from the metaphysics of Plato and Aristotle, for whereas these "classical" thinkers are concerned with a metaphysic of order, of the imposition of pattern or form on the indeterminate or chaotic, Plotinus' arguments are concerned with existence. In the history of philosophical "proofs" of the existence of God this puts Plotinus midway between Aristotle and Aquinas. Like Aristotle, he is not concerned with creation in time ; like Aquinas he is concerned with a cause of existence, not only with a cause of movement or change. That is not to say that Plotinus is not concerned with a first cause of 18 Cf. 5.3.13.1.</page><page sequence="10">84 JOHN M, RIST motion. Like Aristotle, he is concerned with that, but not only with that. The role of the One is both to support existence rather than non-existence, and to organize and (indirectly) arrange the rational movements of what exists insofar as they are rational. Clearly since the One is the cause of existence, it is not limited to "moving" the world only in the Aristotelian sense as a final cause. Its activity must be direct, and must flow directly outwards. There must be, as Plotinus puts it, an activity from the One, as well as an activity of the One (5.4.2.27). The One must be "outgoing" as well as "inward looking." This is part of what he calls the power of the One, and it is this power which perpetually generates the cosmos and holds it in being. Plotinus would criticize the self-directed energy of the Aristotelian mind as an inadequate conception of the notion of power ; certainly it implies that such power is limited, and the limitation is imposed because of the artificial and schematic notion that, since God is mind, its thought must be directed exclu sively to the highest possible object, that is, itself. For from Aristotle's point of view anything else would imply the identity of the mind with what is inferior to itself. Such is the price of empha sizing that mind, so conceived, is at the top of the cosmic hierarchy. A further concern of Plotinus' is to emphasize the inevitability of the existence of the One, as against the contingent existence of other things. That is why he argues constantly that the One is not "as it happened to be" but "as it willed to be."19 When we say "inevitability," we do not mean that anything compelled the One (that would be out of the question) or that the One arises uncaused, i.e., at random.20 Since therefore the One is caused but not caused by or in any way subject to anything else, it has to be "cause of itself"21?perhaps the first, and certainly the first clear use of this kind of language in the history of metaphysics. But such a phrase needs to be fleshed out. In what sense is this noncontingent "being" a cause? How does this strange kind of causation occur? Plotinus' answer to this question is striking, and again "unclassical." He has to take over the language (and the spirit) not of philosophy but of theology. Christian writers (and presumably others) were already 19 Eg., 6.8.13; 6.8.21, passim. 20 6.8.13-14. 21 6.8.20-21.</page><page sequence="11">THE ONE OF PLOTINUS 85 talking about God's will.22 And indeed if it is not intellect, and not chance or (evprjuel) matter which brings the One into being, there is little other choice. Hence constantly in Ennead 6.8 we hear of the One being what it willed to be, not what it happened to be. A question arises. Does this kind of emphasis, particularly strong in the comparatively late Ennead 6.8 (chronologically 39) indicate an attempt by Plotinus to distinguish (or to point towards a distinction to be made by others) between a faculty of knowing and a faculty of willing? Normally such a distinction is unknown among the Platonists, for whom knowing good entails (as for the Demiurge in the Timaeus) an attempt to do good. Or has Plotinus' abandonment of Aristotle's worship of mind opened up a new line of enquiry? There seems to be no reason to suppose, and indeed good reason to deny, that Plotinus separated knowing from willing. But what he is doing by his emphasis on the willing of the One is emphasizing once again the indivisible nature of the One's activity. By empha sizing willing, Plotinus is showing how the One is not merely cogni tive like Aristotle's God, but productive. For the One to will is to achieve, and by emphasizing the notion of willing Plotinus reminds us of the Humean dictum that reason by itself cannot drive a man to act. True, "Platonic" knowledge does, but this is confusing and it is very easy to forget when we are dealing with "platonic" knowl edge or "platonic" thought.23 And although, by his use of the strange term epibole, as we have seen, Plotinus emphasizes the strange mode of the One's "knowledge," his emphasis on willing should give us further assistance to understanding the One's nature. The last "characteristic" of the Plotinian One which deserves mention is its Eros. I leave the word untranslated, for it is hard to know how it can be translated. It should mean "desire," and in a sense it does. The One desires itself (6.8.15). Yet normally "desire" to the Greeks implies a lack, a need, an incompleteness;24 22 Eg., Origen, De Principiis 2.9.1 and the followers of Pantaenus (Max. Conf., De Variis diff. locis Dionysii et Gregorii?Clem. Alex. fr. 7, p. 224, llff.) 23 David Hume, A Treatise of Human Nature, Bk. 2, part 3. Il 24 Yor Plotinus' normal view of the Eros of the soul, see especially 3.5.4.24-26. The basis of his treatment is the need to reconcile the Sym posium's account of Eros with that of the Phaedrus.</page><page sequence="12">86 JOHN M. RIST and the Eros of the One has none of these characteristics. Plotinus seems to want to develop the concept for at least two reasons : first of all because Eros is a mark of all that exists, and yet he has to purge it of the "need" which marks its appearance elsewhere in the universe. Here we find him following a path he is inclined to use more generally: compare the One with something and then strip off the more undesirable features of the image. Secondly Eros is utterly unselfconscious and, at least in the language of metaphor and imagi nation, devoid of duality. Hence, as we saw, Plotinus is able to contrast mind loving (pods ?p p) with mind thinking (povs powp) (6.7.35). The attractiveness of the i?ros-language is that it suggests a state in which the activity of the subject is in no way at all hindered by self-consciousness. The idea is built into all j&amp;ros-language and is explicitly sexual. As Aristotle put it, who can think of anything else when engaged in sexual intercourse? And although those who are more prosaic and less intense might disagree, we may safely conclude that, for Plotinus, .EVos-language best indicates (rather than expresses) the creativity and fecundity of the One. Creativity, will, power, non-contingent cause and supporter of existence, first cause irreducible to conceptual analysis ! It is a much more full-blooded concept of a first cause than Aristotle had proposed. But where does it leave Plotinus at the end? Could it mean that Plotinus has reverted to a more primitively anthropomorphic di vinity? Are many of these qualities merely the qualities of men (viewed, pace Aristotle, as more than the intellect alone) raised to the highest power? As Homer's Zeus is a Homeric man writ larger, bigger, stronger, and everlasting, is Plotinus' God the philosopher writ large? Should we still describe the Plotinian God as anthro pomorphic? One thing is clear: the sum of his characteristics certainly makes the ascription of an impersonal Absolute to Plotinus impossible to accept. For although the One is conceptually irre ducible, the "traces" we have of it seem to have a "personal" or "human" flavor. But if Plotinus' friends would say that his God is not impersonal, and others that it is anthropomorphic, how can we arbitrate between them and how far can we say that his conception is in any fundamental sense a new phenomenon in Greek thought? In at least one important respect Plotinus' descriptions of the One are not anthropomorphic. Consider the concept of Eros, for ex ample, or of causation. In men Eros marks desire and need ; in the</page><page sequence="13">THE ONE OF PLOTINUS 87 One it does not. In other words at the level of the One the most fundamental characteristic of human Eros is lacking. And in regard to creation and causation the One's actions, though they may look like the actions of human beings and be expressed through a similar vocabulary, are quite different. For to be the cause of existence, to hold beings in existence rather than to reconstruct them from inde pendent material, is uniquely the power of the One. It is impossible in both these instances to argue that the One is modelled on human beings ; rather human nature provides a pointer to something outside itself and different in kind from itself, namely, the One. We may argue that no such being exists ; we cannot dismiss it as a mere copy of human nature. Here the comparison with Aristotle is again useful ; for Aristotle we live briefly the kind of intellectual life that God enjoys all the time (Met. 1072B 25). For Plotinus the One's most fundamental activity is something which we cannot achieve for our selves, though whether we can share in it mystically Plotinus does not make clear. The total problem may be summed up as follows : are we to say that we are like the One, or that the One is like us (in which case we have to say that it is "anthropomorphic")? The formal answer is clear to any reader of Plotinus : he says again and again that we can attain likeness to the One and be like it ; he never says that the One can be or is like us.25 And what I have tried to suggest in this paper is that the formal answer is borne out at least to some degree by analysis. There are unique features of the One which are not merely human powers and human activities writ large ; human powers remind us of these features but cannot equal them. In this sense Plotinus has transcended the higher anthropomorphism of Plato and Aristotle.26 University of Toronto 25 It is, of course, axiomatic for Plotinus that the relationship of like ness is asymmetrical. 261 should like to thank Professor A. H. Armstrong, Dr. H. Blumen thal, for their helpful comments on earlier versions of this paper.</page></plain_text>
