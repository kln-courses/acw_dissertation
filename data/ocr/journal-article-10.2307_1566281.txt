<plain_text><page sequence="1">READING'S REASON IAIN MORLAND [W]e must first of all recognize [. . .] how modes of reasoning that were once necessary can spring out of particular situations and be put to new tasks. --Michel de Certeau, Culture in the Plural Introduction: Reading after Reason? Reading is unreasonable. If, as Theodor Adorno has contended, to write poetry after Auschwitz is barbaric, then surely reading--whether of poetry, philosophy, or news- print -is doubly obscene ["Cultural Criticism" 34]. For Adorno, such barbarism means inattentiveness to barbaric historical truths; it is the misuse of rhetorical reflexivity for the perpetuation, rather than the critique, of social conditions. In other words: to write poetry after Auschwitz is to reproduce, and thereby implicitly condone, a contradictory society within which lyric verse and mass murder are coexistent. By extension, read- ing--as a pastime within the culture industry--appears to achieve nothing but the ex- pression of such cultural reification. Reading is, as Adorno has written of criticism, "self-satisfied contemplation" in the face of systematized dissatisfaction ["Cultural Criti- cism" 34]. The Enlightenment had characterized reading as a process of educational reasoning, a dialogue with professional intellectuals about progress and truth. Although this idea carries a rather didactic undertone, as Michel de Certeau has pointed out ["Read- ing" 166-67], its representation of the book as a mobile repository of thought and criti- cism seems reasonable enough. Yet, in the face of such barbarism as Auschwitz, the practice of reading appears shamefully futile--a blindfolded refusal of historical truth, rather than an informed response to its implications. Reading is not alone in its unreasonableness: reason too has become unreasonable, Max Horkheimer has argued in Eclipse ofReason. Consequently, Horkheimer proposes that the "denunciation of what is currently called reason is the greatest service reason can render" [187]. Objective reason, Horkheimer suggests, has been eclipsed by its insipid, subjective counterpart, rationality. Rationality defines what is reasonable as what is useful; it does not seek truth as an end in itself. Reason has thus become merely a mental tool with which one can make effective plans in neocapitalist society. In short, rationality privileges means over ends. This subjective pastiche of reason, like poetry after Auschwitz, dumbly reiterates the status quo through devising ever more efficient procedures by which tasks may be carried out. It does not criticize the objective ends that are actually furthered by such procedures. Similarly, poetry (for example, that of James Fenton) invents ornate and affective representations of modern barbarism with- out removing the conditions within which barbarism thrives. In this regard, reading is I thank the editors and reviewers of Diacriticsfor their constructive comments.

The valorization of procedure, of means over ends, is why the practice of reading seems complacently to ignore the demands of society and culture. Insofar as rationality considers reasonable only those procedures that have instant, efficient results, reading remains in essence unreasonable. Reading is not a procedure whereby certain tasks may be accomplished--whether ethical demands for political change, or capitalist invita- tions to unlimited consumerism. Put differently, although reading has consequences, there is no procedural connection between the practice of reading and its consequences. Consider the case of ethical demands: reading may certainly serve as a preparation or grounding for future political activity. However, such preparatory reading is inevitably superseded by the activity that it incites. It is not itself a procedure for political change, but simply part of the means to a political end. This situation is mirrored in the opposite case, that of capitalist enticement: reading interrupts bookselling. A consumer's reading time extends indeterminably beyond the moment of expenditure, unlike their usage of a product with a predetermined life span. Likewise, when I wrote in the opening paragraph that it "seems reasonable enough" that a book ought to be a repository of thought and criticism, I too have employed reason in merely a rational sense. I have defined the process of reading a book as rea- sonable only if serves the end of promoting critical thought. In other words, reading has been incorporated into a procedure that I consider to be reasonable: critical thought. This argument can be pedagogically useful [Elam], but it necessarily reduces reading to the status of preparatory groundwork for such thought. The conflation of reason and procedure, and the ensuing demotion of reading, are two facets of the same cultural maneuver. My purpose in this article will be to think through the relationship between reading and reasoning without reducing either to a rational procedure. I also want to avoid any appeal to humanist arguments about the value of literature and its potential to "culture" any given individual [Bloom 21-29]; indeed, I wish to consider some instances of non- literary reading. Instead, I aim to explore the dialectical possibilities inherent in Adorno's idea of simultaneous participation and nonparticipation in culture. What would it mean for reading to be thought of in such a way? as a practice that simultaneously reifies and deconstructs its social conditions? I will argue that cultural criticism needs to attend to the embodied materiality of the situations in which we read in order to recognize read- ing as a truly reasonable, and therefore critical, end in itself. The Outside: Limitless Potential An important way in which reading appears to operate dialectically is its potential to promote a different way of understanding culture. The potentiality itself is more signifi- cant than its realization, and in this regard it offers a counterargument to the charge that reading after reason, like poetry after Auschwitz, is useless. The barbarity of such use- lessness is, one might suggest, balanced by a genuine potential for usefulness that comes into relief only when twinned with its opposite. Seamus Heaney has made such a point in his lecture "The Government of the Tongue." He describes the apparent futility of literature as "the great paradox of poetry and of the imaginative arts in general": Faced with the brutality of the historical onslaught, they are practically use- less. Yet they verify our singularity, they strike and stake out the ore of self 86</page><page sequence="3">V:1: 4 X. :.m ------------- A.., ??$:t . .. .. .. .. :m ?: ,a*P. -N :X M :':? ?: ? i?:i" NA _0,1.

It is like the writing in the sand in the face of which accusers and accused are left speechless and renewed. [107] Heaney's argument appears to be reassuring and inspiring, yet it is nonetheless thor- oughly rational rather than reasonable, and as such reveals problems within the idea of potentiality itself. Where Heaney writes "practically useless," read "procedurally use- less": having asserted that poetry fails in its task of halting brutality, he simply reapplies his imaginative art to another task- that of leaving people speechless. Here, poetry has become a tool that need merely be employed in the appropriate procedure in order to produce satisfactory results. The efficacy of reading seems to be a rational question of matching up means to ends. If a lyric doesn't work, why not try a sonnet? Moreover, Heaney's conflation of speechlessness and renewal is unsettling; is good poetry that which forecloses further speech? Surely reading ought to promote cultural dialogue rather than silence. The "accusers and accused" will neither transcend nor forget their dispute by being mutely mesmerized by artistic language. Even more fundamental to Heaney's rhetoric is the idea of "individuated life" founded upon an "ore of self," a metaphor that describes selfhood in terms of metallur- gic value. The metaphor presumes that ore is valuable, through the human labor ex- pended to extract it in dangerous conditions, in order to fortify individuation-itself a capitalist conceit. Heaney's rhetorical miners are exploited to stress both the connection and the discontinuity between proletarian and bourgeois subjectivity: the product of the proletariat becomes the "base" of bourgeois individuals. Means rather than ends; silence rather than speech; class conflict rather than fair distribution: Heaney's optimism about the potentiality of reading and writing transpires to be little more than a reiteration of the suppressed potentiality within culture at large [Horkheimer, Eclipse 128-61]. By attempting to resolve artistic potential into the "writ- ing in the sand" effect, Heaney actually removes the potential that he has set out to celebrate. Such potential, in order to be realized effectively-or, more precisely, in or- der to be identified as effective -has been considered as a means to something outside of itself. It seems that, unfortunately, once the potential of reading is realized, it be- comes neutralized. It becomes rationalized. The Inside: Limitless Meaning Academic literary criticism, on the other hand, largely searches for potential meanings within a text, rather than outside of it. Indeed, it has become a derisive cliche to say that academics "read too much" into the texts that they scrutinize. Contemporary academic reading seeks to uncover precisely what texts didn't know they knew, their submerged mechanisms and the conditions of their intelligibility [Belsey, Critical Practice]. As such, this kind of reading presumes that texts have some kind of latent content, a textual unconscious from which unexpected meanings can be extracted and displayed [Macherey 92]. The work of Sigmund Freud, of course, has been very influential here. "A gain in meaning," he wrote in "The Unconscious," "is a perfectly justifiable ground for going beyond the limits of direct experience" [168]. For the practice of reading, Freud's ethos means that criticism must surpass the immediate experience of a text by attentive re- reading. It becomes the responsibility of a careful reader to accumulate the greatest possible amount of meaning from a text. The reader becomes a literary entrepreneur [Adorno, "Cultural Criticism" 22]; the professional critic, a kind of textual technician. 88</page><page sequence="5">However, there is an important difference between reading the unconscious of an analysand and that of a text. While an analysand has a delineated, albeit obscured, per- sonal history, the history of a text is more nebulous: it is the history of its surrounding culture. To be sure, an analysand's identity is also formed by their culture, by their civilization and its inevitable discontents, but psychoanalysis--in contrast to analytic psychology [Jung] - works largely to identify the repressed remains of experiences within their personal lifetime [Freud, "Unconscious" 174-78]. Conversely, to read the uncon- scious of a text is to reconstruct a seemingly limitless number of meanings. Freud envis- aged that the unconscious had no concept of time, and that the experience of temporal- ity arose through the interaction between the preconscious, conscious, and unconscious ["Unconscious" 190-93; "Writing-Pad"]. It is as if the unconscious is read by the other elements of the mental apparatus in order to construct meanings as necessary. Academic reading similarly intervenes in the space of this interaction to produce patterns of mean- ing from the timeless cacophony of the text's cultural unconscious. The text, mute and unchanging, appears to obey. Here, in a maneuver of retrospective anthropomorphism, reading usurps the text's own consciousness with its critical tools. For example, such reading might attempt to make sense of the ideological tensions within a text. To do this, it would need to place the unconscious content of the original text within a consciously critical framework. In Freud's terms, this kind of reading would certainly effect a gain in meaning. However, by the same logic, there could be no immediate qualitative assessment of the meaning that was produced. To the degree that reading produces meaning from the text's unconscious, it performs a quantitative rather than a qualitative function. That is to say, within this model, the extraction of meaning is structurally prior to its evaluation. In like manner, for Freud, the timeless unconscious comes "before" consciousness and can thus be reached by going "beyond" and behind direct experience. Any qualitative, reasoned assessment of meaning is thus supplemen- tal to the actual practice of reading. In this regard, Freud's discourse inherits nineteenth-century models of scientific exploration - exemplified by Darwin's Beagle voyage - whereby scientists would ven- ture into environments "beyond the limits of direct experience" in order to make obser- vations that would subsequently be taxonomically arranged. The effect of this division between reading as the gathering of meaning, and reason as the appendant ordering of data, is similar to Heaney's idea of the "unlimited" efficacy of poetry. For Heaney, textual potentiality is measured by its quantitative ability to silence accuser and ac- cused, rather than by a qualitative judgment of the benefits of speechlessness. Funda- mentally then, the limitless search for meaning within a text appears to be simply a mirror image of the argument that reading is justified by its unlimited capacity to affect culture at large. Discursive Power Of course, scientific exploration and categorization have cultural authority where read- ing does not. Charles Darwin has been more important than Charles Dickens. Reading is ostensibly recreational, extraneous to social progress, whereas scientific activities are valorized as valuable [Adorno, "Free Time"]. Yet this is not a question of different procedures; even the most basic positivist experiment is a kind of reading. Experimen- tation involves making meaningful patterns out of data: of employing reason to analyze and articulate nature's unconscious [Rees]. In this way, Dickens and Darwin, although they seem to form a stereotypical antithesis, were nonetheless both producers of texts. Indeed, medical professionals sometimes refer to their patients as texts to be read [Daniel]. diacritics / summer 2001 89</page><page sequence="6">At stake here is the relationship between scientific "literacy and discursive power," in the terms of the linguists Halliday and Martin. How is it that reading and positivism, although they are procedurally so similar, have such an uneven weighting of discursive power? If, in the age of subjective rationality, procedural efficiency is celebrated, why does reading remain unreasonable, when it is capable of producing unlimited amounts of meaning? In the chapter "Conflicting Panaceas" in Eclipse of Reason [58-91], Horkheimer discusses and critiques the high profile of scientific positivism. By its overdetermined emphasis upon facts and common sense, positivism "restricts intelligence to functions necessary to the organisation of material patterned according to that very commercial culture which intelligence is called upon to criticise" [82]. It fails to engage critically with the material conditions through which facts are identified and within which com- mon sense appears to be sensible. Positivism, as an aspect of rationality, does not cri- tique the political ends that common sense is presumed to justify and that facts are made to serve. Consequently, reality, Horkheimer claims, "is conceived as devoid of all ob- jective character that might, by its inner logic, lead to a better reality" [83]. Reality's potential is, paradoxically, suppressed by the same scientific reading that sets out to disclose reality's hidden truths, as is exemplified by the rationalizing, neutralizing force of Heaney's apology for poetry. Can this paradox be explained? A key element in the heritage of positivism is the philosophical debate over divine ontology. Ren6 Descartes and Gottfried Leibniz con- sidered existence to be an essential quality of God, a necessary perfection possessed by a perfect being [Descartes 142-49; Leibniz 127]. With this supposition in place, they used logic to demonstrate that it would be contradictory for God to lack the "quality" of existence. Positivist rationality, I contend, has inherited this tautology in its assertion of the self-sufficient necessity of common sense: that is, that it is common sense to follow common sense. It would be contradictory to ignore it. Seen in this way, reading--par- ticularly of fiction and philosophy-- appears to be superfluous to sensible cultural progress precisely because it offers potentialities instead of preexistent facts. Moreover, reading may lead one to doubt the very possibility of facts in their scientifically constructed form. Certainly metafictions such as Dennis Potter's Karaoke and Cold Lazarus have this effect. Although the practice of reading after Auschwitz seems to fly in the face of common sense, reading can offer alternative visions of society that are powerful pre- cisely in their capacity to confound contemporary common sense. Conversely, as Immanuel Kant later argued, because Descartes and Leibniz presumed the very thing which they set out to prove-namely, the existence of a perfect being-they failed to consider the logical implications of saying simply, "There is no God" [477-86]. Put differently, Descartes and Leibniz failed to think beyond the limits of their theological common sense. Thus, in provocatively psychoanalytic terms, positivist dogmatism needs to secure its cultural authority by projecting its own unrealized potentiality outward, onto the practice of reading. Positivism charges reading with being unreasonable because posi- tivism is perhaps unreasonable itself. To return to Freud's essay on the unconscious: "The ego behaves as if the danger of a development of anxiety threatened it not from the direction of an instinctual [or, in the case of positivism, logical] impulse but from the direction of a perception, and it is thus enabled to react against this external danger" [187]. The danger for positivism is that of unverified invention, so it charges reading with its own crime. The effect of such projection is to reify the process of reading as a "fact" that may be perceived and reacted to, rather than a mechanism innate to modern scientific thought itself. 90</page><page sequence="7">While this defensive formulation approaches an account of reading as an end in itself, it also criticizes reading for that very quality. Now reading is represented as inad- equate because it is not a procedure for reaffirming the status quo. In particular, fiction and philosophy, by representing some of reality's unrealized potentialities, are unrea- sonable in their aimlessness. Unfortunately, in countering Descartes and Leibniz, Kant too devalued the essen- tial potentiality of reading. We cannot "become richer in knowledge by mere ideas," he wrote in the Critique of Pure Reason, just as "a merchant in capital, if, in order to improve his position [... .] were to add a few noughts to his cash account" [486]. Seen in this way, reading is hopelessly utopian. Indeed, two contradictory homonyms converge in the word "utopia": the Greek eutopia and outopia, "good place" and "nowhere" [Belsey, Desire 197]. What's the Use? The relationship between reading and unscrupulous accounting, which Kant employs as a metaphor, is culturally pervasive for Adorno in his essay "Cultural Criticism and Society." Adorno suggests that culture's lack of critical self-awareness is concomitant with its commodification; it has become simply a marketplace of "cultural goods" and "cultural values" [22]. Just as positivism objectifies reading, so too does culture objec- tify, rather than critique, itself. Thus, for Adorno, cultural criticism is in turn irresponsi- bly conservative because it thinks of culture in pregiven commercial terms; it fails to think through the actual commerciality of culture. If Adorno is right, an important and inevitable equivalence between objectification and commodification seems to bear upon the practice of reading after reason. Reading, in its reified and objectified position in rational culture, functions as a recreational opposite to serious activities. It serves to highlight the supposed usefulness of all that it is not: commerce, sport, information technology, engineering. While these "fields" are crudely drawn examples, they nonetheless together illuminate the peculiar cultural position of reading. That they broadly make sense as a collective example of what reading is "not" is a reflection of reading itself. Under the gaze of rationality, reading has become exaggeratedly unreasonable and derivative; it can make no claims for itself because it is popularly defined only through what it is not. In other words, it is precisely outopian, having no location of its own. The notion of such an opposition between reading and what is useful relies upon the cultural economy of goods and values that Adorno has identified. In the cultural marketplace, reading does not have use-value; rather, it has exchange-value. The cul- tural market has devalued the specificities of reading, such as its consideration of poten- tialities, and used reading as a figure of exchange. Specifically, reading's unreasonable- ness has become a point of comparison against which other activities are seen to be rational and productive. "When I read for enjoyment I want to be entertained and feel lifted out of my daily routine," commented a romance reader to critic Janice Radway [63]. The function of reading in this comparative exchange is, to borrow from Marx, "merely to serve as the material in which the value of the first commodity"--in this case, those other more useful activities-"is expressed" [49]. The objectification of reading is thus of a piece with its commodification. Having been reified as a recre- ational pursuit, reading now occupies an abject position within the cultural economy. Yet it is important here to avoid characterizing the practice of reading as a forlomrn hero of philosophy who is continuously being reproached by cruel rationality. Although the practice of reading is reified and oversimplified by positivism, reading nonetheless diacritics / summer 2001 91</page><page sequence="8">includes contradictions of its own. On the one hand, the cultural exchange-value of reading deconstructs itself, because, by its own logic, a particular amount of reading cannot ultimately substitute for serious, useful activity. On the other hand, reading cer- tainly does not originate outside culture; neither can it be retrospectively considered to operate prior to commodification. Reading generates a textual marketplace of its own, within which, as we shall see, meanings are traded and evaluated. Dialectics of Romance The idea of a textual marketplace was famously articulated by Ferdinand de Saussure in his Course in General Linguistics. "The value of any term is [. . .] determined by its environment," Saussure asserted [116]. He taught that linguistic value arises through the interaction of dissimilar units, which may be exchanged for each other, and similar units, which may be compared with one another. This is clearly a question of exchange- value rather than use-value [Baudrillard 143-63]. Indeed, in Saussure's model, linguis- tic use-value is an arbitrary, albeit culturally determined, effect of linguistic exchange. Thus, during reading, the meaning of linguistic units -whether syllables, sentences, or genres- is produced by their position within a larger economic structure. In the light of this theory, it is unsurprising that traditional academic reading--the extraction and ac- cumulation of meanings - is an inherently capitalist practice. "Even outside language," Saussure argued, "all values are apparently governed by the same paradoxical prin- ciple" of similarity and dissimilarity, of use and exchange [115]. Reading is irrevocably implicated in the commodification of culture. Nevertheless, reading may also be uncritically and intentionally recreational. Reading may flout the conventions of Saussure's textual economy by "wasting" and devaluing potential meanings, rather than by "responsibly" investing them in thought. This is in- triguing, because it is apparently through reading that linguistic exchange-value is ar- ticulated and sustained in the first instance. Yet it seems possible to read against read- ing. Consider, for example, the oft-decried genre of formula romance. Radway, in her study Reading the Romance: Women, Patriarchy, and Popular Literature, found that some regular romance readers often checked the endings of their novels prior to pur- chase. These women wanted to be sure of an optimistic and satisfying conclusion be- fore they committed themselves to reading the whole book [99]. Textual potentiality has here been supplanted by a kind of reading that seeks specifically to eliminate ambi- guity and uncertainty. For these readers, a prosaic confirmation of what is already known substitutes for the speculative potential of reading. As Catherine Belsey puts it, "what makes romances so easy to read, and consequently so easy to despise, is precisely their familiarity. We know all this already" [Desire 31]. There is no economy of difference, only a play of sameness. Indeed, some of the women interviewed by Radway claimed to read more than fifteen romance novels every week--consciously and continually en- suring that their expectations were textually articulated [60]. The potentiality of reading thus seems to encapsulate a dialectic of the utopian and the mundane. While the barrage of happy conjugal endings undoubtedly serves to reas- sure Radway's readers that culture is ultimately benign (and heterosexual), it also indi- cates that these women remain essentially unconvinced. That they read so much of the same suggests an anxiety concerning whether the optimistic novels actually depict the truth of their society. Put differently, insofar as they seek constant reassurance of the mimetic relationship between reading and "reality," such readers implicitly call this relationship into question. It is therefore indeterminable whether their reading substi- tutes for a romantically unfulfilling world, or whether it creates romantic fulfillment in itself. In Marxian terms: is such reading a question of exchange-value or use-value? 92</page><page sequence="9">The Difference of Reading It is, of course, a question of both and yet, to the degree that use and exchange are alienated from each other, neither. Reading is unreasonable because it not only reflects but also distracts from the unreasonableness of commodified culture. Consequently it is disruptive. Seen in this way, recreational and academic reading are analogous: they both disrupt supposedly discrete categories, namely, those of recreation and work. Quite simply, academic reading does not seem to count as rational work, while recreational reading seems to be a little too taxing to count as a hobby - even if it is "only" formula romance. For a pair of simple negative examples, consider these: engineering, unlike literary studies, is celebrated as outstandingly rational and profitable, while the cinema offers pleasures more passive, and by extension more relaxing, than reading. Reading is uncomfortable in either category, whether paid work or free time. Similar to Adorno's idea of cultural criticism, both academic and recreational reading participate in dialecti- cal culture by their ostensible nonparticipation, by their refusal to be easily located in the opposing positions of "good place" and "nowhere." However, it would be naive to attribute this misplacement to a mysterious essence of reading that disrupts its surrounding culture. As Heaney points out, no lyric has ever stopped a tank. The undecidable position of reading is, rather, symptomatic of the exist- ing bourgeois distinction between work and leisure. In his incisive essay "Free Time," Adorno identifies what he calls "a behavioural pattern of the bourgeois character": that, On the one hand, one should concentrate when at work, not be distracted, not fool about. [... .. On the other hand, free time should in no way whatsoever suggest work, presumably so that one can work that much more effectively afterward. [ 169] The practice of reading, regardless of reader, writer and text, brings this distinction into relief by pressing upon its logical boundaries. It is, however, also true that reading is able to problematize these categories only because they are already in place, already reified as inevitable and natural. This contradictory situation means that the same cul- ture that produces reading, and gives it no place of its own, is troubled by reading for that very reason. Heaney suggested that poetry acts as a cultural silencer, paradoxically renewing those whom it strikes even while it appears to do nothing. The truth of his statement is exactly its falseness, that reading may indeed have unlimited potential to affect individuals even while it owes its existence and intelligibility to the contradictory stability of the status quo. I want to argue that this negative dialectic is physically tan- gible during reading. Reading, I shall now propose, literally both distracts from and reflects commodified culture by rendering its contradictions explicit and implicit. Conclusions: Critical Reading Adono concludes "Free Time" by suggesting that free time could become freedom [175]. Might it be possible for reading-both because of and despite its paradoxical misplacement-to become reason? Such a transformation would need to avoid uncriti- cal prescriptions such as, for example, that politically committed works alone ought to be published [Adomrno, "Commitment"], or that academic interpretative skills should be somehow enforced upon society [Bloom]. It is in the nature of cultural criticism to be unable to "fix" (in both senses) reading by either of these means. Etymologically, "criti- cal" means not only crucial and determinant but also unfavorably judgmental, censori- diacritics / summer 2001 93</page><page sequence="10">ous, and fault-finding. Cultural criticism's location within dialectical culture means that it may operate in both these dimensions at once [Horkheimer, "Critical Theory"]. "Cul- ture," in turn, "is only true when implicitly critical," remarks Adorno, because it is explicitly paradoxical ["Cultural Criticism" 22]. With this in mind, I want to conclude by suggesting a way in which cultural criti- cism can approach the practice of reading. This approach must not elide the contradic- tions inherent to reading and criticism; rather, it must critically account for them. Fun- damental to the practice of reading, as I have been arguing, is the experience of disjunc- tion, in all kinds of ways, between the text that I read and the cultural location in which I read. I may, for instance, sit reading a lyric inside a tank. My cultural location is a knot that includes not only my geographic situation but also my social, economic, sexual, and historical positioning. In like manner, my reading is more than the comprehension of semiotic units; it includes, because of the configuration of my body, the turning of pages, an occasional glance away from the text, or a quick intake of breath at the last page. In sum, cultural criticism needs to pay close attention to the lack of attention with which we often read. Our locations (a crowded caf6, a soporific beach), our bodies (hunger, thirst), our technologies (a ringing telephone, a power cut) at once distract from reading and are also profoundly inescapable. I am, then, interested less in the physiological processes of reading, fascinating as they may be [Saenger 1-9], and more in everything but those processes, an "everything but" without which reading neverthe- less could not take place. One cannot read outside of culture, and one cannot read, as Jean-Franqois Lyotard might have said, without a body. There is also a degree of feedback between body and text. I sometimes smile or yawn or scratch my chin in time with the characters in my book; Marcel Proust and Michel de Certeau have recounted similar experiences [Proust, On Reading 23; de Certeau, "Reading" 175]. Clearly these phenomena, which are something like the "writing aloud" described by Roland Barthes in The Pleasure of the Text [66-67], occur most especially with sensation fiction, of which my preferred example is Wilkie Collins's Armadale. They also occur, quite simply, with our favorite books (mine is Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials, the plot of which itself turns on a somatic response to a story). I suggest that these situated experiences from within and without, which both dis- rupt and maintain our readerly attention, provide a motivation to read that is far more thrilling and pleasurable than the Enlightenment desire, inherited by the late Victorians, to be cultured and humanized. We read to forget our bodies; we read to remember them. I am not resorting to individualism here, to reading as a kind of onanistic therapy for synthesizing body and mind. These bodily events are wholly dependent upon culture, upon the body's placement within locations that are in excess of the individual reading subject: office furniture, trains, toilets, hospital beds.... We are susceptible to these things through the body, but they go beyond the body. They may be radically impersonal. The resultant juxtapositions are as diverse as read- ing George Eliot's Middlemarch while the radio quietly reports a massacre, of overhear- ing someone coincidentally speaking the words I am currently reading, or of trying to concentrate on Eclipse of Reason while listening to the intrusively loud personal stereo of a fellow bus passenger. These situations inform and constitute my experience of reading, however interrupted and fragmentary they may appear. They are, in both senses, critical. Reading is therefore always already critical- and this is why it confounds the explicatory structure of potentiality and realization. The suppressed dialectical poten- tial of contemporary culture is hereby rendered not only explicit but also implicit at the moment of reading. 94</page><page sequence="11">Cultural criticism needs to account for the dialectical complexity of such situa- tions. The juxtaposition of reading and situation is often bizarre, outrageous, alienating, unreasonable. Walter Benjamin, writing on formal techniques of interruption and situ- ation within epic theater in his essay "The Author as Producer," suggests that such strategies produce an arresting montage effect that enables dramatists "to expose what is present" in all its fragmentary strangeness [267]. The result of this alienating strange- ness? For Benjamin, "the demand to think," a demand upon both playwright and theatergoer. The same effect is, in a sense, inherent in all reading. Doubtless, Janice Radway's readers were painfully aware of the disjunction between the limitlessness of romance in fiction, and its meager availability in society. Likewise, the very unreason- ableness of reading after Auschwitz--of reading after reason--could catalyze reading to become dialectical thought: to become, through its situational contradictions, reason itself. In this way, then, cultural criticism might begin to respond to Certeau's charge to recognize "how modes of reasoning that were once necessary can spring out of particu- lar situations and be put to new tasks": reading's reason.
