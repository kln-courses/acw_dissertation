WILKES PETER CLARK and CRISPIN WRIGHT (eds), Mind, Psychoanalysis and Science. (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1988. Pp. xiv + 370. Price ?25.00.) I. INTRODUCTION1 Although I was originally invited to write a standard review of this book, the editors of The Philosopical Quarterly kindly acceded to my request to turn the review into a review article. I asked this for several reasons. First, the collection justifies an extended treatment. Second, I have my own views - often rather strong ones - about some of the issues discussed, and the framework of a regular review would have required me to downplay the self-indulgence of expressing them. Third, the context of a review article gives me greater freedom to concentrate specifically on one or two themes; if I had prepared a review, I should have felt greater obligation to reflect the wide range of topics discussed in this large collection. I shall however start with some review-style facts about the collection. It derives from a conference held at the University of St. Andrews in 1985. There is an introduction by the editors, which provides a brief, but generally accurate and informative, summary of the articles to follow. There are then sixteen articles, divided into six parts. Each part has first a 'target article', and then one or more articles written to a greater or lesser extent in reply to it. The first part, which includes the only previously-published article, is on 'Foundations of Psychoanalysis'; the aforementioned previously-published article is, not surprisingly, Griinbaum's (1986) precis of his 1984 book with that same title. It is wholly correct to reprint Griinbaum's paper - not only because there is a section devoted explicitly to his book, but also because virtually all the articles in other parts refer to, or presuppose knowledge of, it. The other five parts are entitled 'Psychoanalysis and Conscious- ness'; 'Psychoanalysis and Commonsense Psychology'; 'Psychoanalysis: its Eviden- tial Support'; 'Freud and his Influence'; and 'Psychoanalysis and Dreams'. The authors come from diverse backgrounds: there are of course the predictable psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, and philosophers, but also there are scholars of English and of law. Some readers might regret the omission of any paper arguing in 1 In what follows, quotations from and references to arguments in Mind, Psychoanalysis and Science will be given simply by page number.</page><page sequence="2">242 KATHLEEN V. WILKES any wholehearted way for the hermeneutic 'reconstructions' offered by such as Ricoeur and Habermas; since a large part of Grunbaum's precis-article is devoted to an assault on these reconstructions, someone should perhaps have been invited to defend the pass. The answer, of course (which I would share, thus showing that I belong to the same tradition as most of the contributors) is that these reconstructions are not worth defending, and that Grunbaum has in fact used his formidable sledgehammer to crack a somewhat fragile nut. Moreover, what some might regard as a more moderate variant of hermeneutic reconstruction - indeed, reflecting a much older line of thought than that of the 'hermeneuts' - is to some extent provided by Hopkins, Haldane, Sharpe, and Dilman; Grunbaum would wish to dispute their theses too, for some at least of the reasons he brings to bear against Ricoeur and Habermas. Moreover again, this book is in fact all about Freud, and '[w]hereas it may be possible to construct a hermeneutical psychoanalysis ... whatever such a psychoanalysis might be, it would not, in any interesting sense, be Freudian' (Caplan, 1986, p. 229). All the same, had there been greater representation from continental Europe at the St. Andrews conference, the reader might have had a chance to make such an assessment for himself. In this article I shall focus on two groups of themes that run, explicitly or implicitly, through many of the articles; they are strongly related. The first concerns those issues that belong, roughly, to the philosophy of science: theory and metatheory, evidence and probative or falsificatory support, causality, anthropomor- phism and metaphor, and Freud's own concern to keep to the norms and values of natural science. The second group of issues revolves around the relation between psychological (or intensional) statements and physical statements, and hence reductionism, and, again, Freud's actual position and its strength. This focus, though, means that I shall have little or nothing to say about two interesting and important strands of the collection; this needs explanation. (a) My neglect of Lamarque's article has nothing to do with its merits. His important argument is that neither the theory nor the practice of psychoanalysis can contribute to the special tasks of the literary critic. Although I am not competent to judge, it would seem to me that he is wholly right, and that Freud above all would agree. Freud consistently disavowed the influence he undoubtedly had on literature and its critics; his own discussions of literary works (e.g., the 1907 'Delusions and Dreams in Jensen's Gradiva') show indeed that he thought the influence was reversed; literature was yet another source for him to draw upon in his own speculation. (b) It is perhaps more surprising that I shall not say much about the final section, 'Psychoanalysis and Dreams'. Frankly, though, I do not believe that finding holes and inconsistencies in 'The Interpretation of Dreams', which is a game that anyone can play, has much to tell us about the feasibility of a neo-Freudian reform of the thesis - more especially as Freud, in his latest metapsychological works, came up with a bewildering diversity of new and confusing, and generally very vague, theoretical notions which would inevitably have forced, and to, some extent did force, him to recast his thoughts on dreams completely. But he would have needed an even longer life to do so properly. Hobson's article is a most enlightening description of current dream research, but it fails, to my mind, as a critique of Freud; he seems to blame</page><page sequence="3">ANALYSING FREUD 243 Freudian hypotheses of the 1880s for their failure to mesh with the neuroscientific hypotheses of the 1980s. Indeed, he seems to be blaming him for not having written a century later: Freud ... could not break free of his own intellectual history ... Freud's dream theory is highly derivative of the neurobiology of 1890 ... I will ... indicate those parts of the theory which are invalidated a priori because they are based upon invalid assumptions about how the nervous system works... Freud's 'Project' failed because his knowledge of the brain was far too incomplete and inaccurate to support the elaboration of the general theory that he envisaged. (pp. 278-9) However, one should surely comment (a) that none of us can nor should 'break free' of our intellectual history - we stand and have to stand on the shoulders of our predecessors, whatever we do with their findings; (b) Freud himself disavowed the 'Project' precisely because he knew that it was premature to try to make the links he had sought in 1895; (c) he saw biology and psychology co-evolving - he remarks, for instance: The phenomena with which we are dealing do not belong to psychology alone; they have an organic and biological side as well, and accordingly in the course of our effort at building up psycho-analysis we have also made some important biological discoveries and have not been able to avoid framing new biological hypotheses. (S.E., xxiii, p. 195) and (d), that Hobson's hypotheses too might be regarded one day in terms of being 'derivative of the neurobiology of 1980', and based on 'invalid assumptions about how the nervous system works', because 'his knowledge of the brain was far too inaccurate to support' his hypotheses. Yet that should not be a criticism of Hobson. Indeed, he admits on p. 296 that his model is 'both incomplete and controversial'. So surely he should extend to Freud the same charity he allows his own hypotheses. Squires' article is a gentle but useful corrective. In the section of his paper entitled 'How do Dreams get Organized?' (pp. 310-12), he argues that Hobson (and Hobson and McCarley, 1977, 1979) have failed to show that the way the brain synthesizes the signals sent to the forebrain is 'uncontaminated by motivation', and hence that 'the idea that dreams are "motivated" does not fall with the failure of Freud's physiology nor with the present success of Harvard's physiology' (pp. 311-12). These papers, and Pagnini's summary of the present state of play concerning the reconcilability of psychoanalysis and physiology, are important contributions to any post-Freudian examination of dreams; but the emphasis is on the 'post'. So much for the prologue and apologia. II. ISSUES IN PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE (a) Psychoanalysis and the philosophy of science To begin with a complaint. Apart from Griinbaum and Moore, nobody in this</page><page sequence="4">244 KATHLEEN V. WILKES collection takes contemporary work in the philosophy of science seriously enough. One or two contributors are themselves scientists, and hence take their own science seriously. The neglect however of the philosophy of science encourages neglect of relevantly-parallel issues in sciences other than psychoanalysis. It also encourages a distorted view of the purity and virtue of other sciences, by comparison with which psychoanalysis is debunked. Crews, for instance, sneers (I choose the verb deliberately: Crews does sneer) at Freud for satisfying 'his obsessional need for intellectual immortality' - here quoting Sulloway (1979, p. 217) - without having found... an accurate psychology' (p. 243; italics in original). Yet find me one experimental psychologist who would claim that any form of psychology, with the possible exception of highly specific hypotheses in physiological psychology, is 'accurate'! 2 Thus I do not believe that Freudian psychoanalysis is always given a true run for its money in this volume. It is judged by its failure to conform to the canons that allegedly hold in other sciences; and by its failure to conform to old-fashioned standards - largely imposed or invented by philosophers - which are not necessarily demanded elsewhere. This can lead to the suspicion that the attacks on Freud 'are conducted with a scrupulosity and attention to detail which does not seem to be applied to rival theories' (Kline, p. 231). I should however illustrate and defend these claims. We cannot deny that Freud was trained in rigorous science; for most of the time between 1874 and 1895 he was engaged in medicine, anatomy, neurology, neuropathology. Whatever else may be true of him, and however we rate his success, there is no doubt but that he knew what science was and required, and sought to make his own theories and hypotheses meet those requirements. (One of the great virtues of Grunbaum's book is that he recognizes this fully; his critique is that Freud's results failed to fit his own standards.) Science, and theorizing about science, has come a long way since Freud; and indeed a long way since - and largely because of- Popper. Thus one can go along with much of Griinbaum's critique of Popper's demand for falsifiability, even if one does not resiie from that into Griinbaum's inductivism. In general, and not least in that superego of the sciences, physics, the following claims have become widely recognized, or at least discussed very seriously. (i) There are whole hosts of methodological strategies, all sorts of sources that support or militate against individual hypotheses of a theory. (ii) Rejection of an hypothesis does not necessarily entail rejection of a theory. (iii) Rejection of metatheoretical claims3 have implications quite unlike those stemming from the rejection of lower-level generalizations. (iv) Relatively few hypotheses, still less theories, can be falsified or refuted by a single contrary datum. (v) All sciences, physics in particular, employ analogies and models ad hoc to describe, explore, test, and develop hypotheses and theories - and the models and analogies may be incompatible with each other. But models and analogies are not theories, but are called in to throw light upon various 2 I half remember, and may be misquoting, a comment of Hull's: 'No psychologist, of course, agrees with any other psychologist; but they all have strong views about learning, reinforcement, and John B. Watson.' 3 Freud termed what I have called 'metatheoretical' claims 'metapsychological'. This bit of terminology has caused hosts of unnecessary misunderstandings.</page><page sequence="5">ANALYSING FREUD 245 aspects of the phenomena under study; all have 'negative' (disanalogous) and 'neutral' aspects, as well as their 'positive' ones. Thus their lack of self-consistency does not matter. (This point therefore tells against Haldane's complaint on p. 115 about the range of analogies which Freud uses from sciences in other domains.4) (vi) Scarcely any causal claims require a necessary, still less a sufficient, relationship between cause and effect. (vii) Laws may be good laws even if they are statistical, and even if they are not employed centrally in explanations and predictions (cf. qualitative mechanics). (viii) Not all sciences invariably employ laws, but can resort to such relations as those expressed by symmetry-principles, or by narratives, as we often find in discussions of evolutionary theory.5 (ix) Theories may be supported by relatively-direct evidence, but also by such features as simplicity, capacity for extension to further domains, internal consistency, consistency with theories from related domains, fruitfulness, predictive power ... and of course also the degree of their amenability to falsification and inductive support, and their applicability - which in the case of psychoanalysis has generally been taken to be their therapeutic success. (x) The mere existence of alternative explanations does not necessarily impugn the target hypothesis; 'the availability of alternative explanatory hypotheses for a given body of data is a well- known feature of every reasonably complex scientific investigation' (Fine and Forbes, 1986; 238). (xi) Many mature and respected sciences have not so much 'a theory' as a set of theories, some of which are highly developed and thoroughly scientific, and some of which are speculative and/or low-level: experimental psychology (the sort of stuff that happens in white coats and laboratories in university departments) is but one example of this, but physics too is host to nests of theories whose mutual relationship is often problematic. None of this makes the task of establishing the scientific status of psychoanalysis, whether Freud's own theory, future developments of it, or rival non-Freudian theories, any easier - indeed, quite the reverse. It means that we cannot go along with Popper, the brunt of whose attack is to say that Freudian psychoanalysis is not falsifiable and thus not truly scientific. But nor can we go whole-heartedly along with Grunbaum, who argues that much of the scientific respectability of Freudian theory stands or falls, and in fact falls, with the Tally Argument ;6 as Hopkins points out (p. 50), there is more to Freud's claims - specifically 'interpretative considerations' - than the Tally argument alone can justify. Certainly we cannot go along with Cioffi, whose various complaints attempt to isolate single instances in which evidence does 4 For the general point here see the excellent discussion by Cartwright in her 1983, ch. 8. 5 Schafer (1980) discusses 'narrative' approaches to psychoanalysis. 6 The 'Tally argument' rests on two premises, which Grunbaum sets out as follows: 1. Only the psychoanalytic method of interpretation and treatment can yield or mediate for the patient correct insight into the unconscious causes of his neurosis. 2. The patient's correct insight into the conflictual cause of his condition and into the unconscious dynamics of his character is in turn causally necessary for the durable cure of his neurosis (p. 14). Consequently, the successes of psychoanalytic treatment can only be explained if the therapeutic interpretations 'tally with what is real' in the patient. The argument is distilled by Grunbaum from Freud's 'Analytic Therapy' (S.E., xvi).</page><page sequence="6">246 KATHLEEN V. WILKES not support an hypothesis, and to condemn Freudian theory (or rather, like Crews, Freud himself: the article rings as personally hostile) on this single basis. On the other hand, to turn to those more hospitable to Freudian theory, it also means that Hopkins' illuminating article in which (inter alia) he argues that psychoanalytic explanation should be seen as a modified extension of commonsense explanation cannot be quite right either. For this neglects the metatheory; and, whatever we make of them, Freud's 'metapsychological' claims are scarcely commonsensical. If Hopkins is right, psychoanalysis is no more of a scientific theory than is common sense, but is none the less valid for much the same reasons that common sense is valid. He is surely right about the low-level generalizations of psychoanalysis, if we considered them on their own merits alone. But (i) Freud undoubtedly wanted psychoanalysis to be a genuine science; (ii) common sense has little to do with the metatheory, and the metatheory is, in the eyes of the Freudian, inextricably bound-up with the lower-level hypotheses and explanations. Friends like Hopkins would be ousted by Freud even more firmly than Jung or Adler were ousted. Jung and Adler merely debunked the centrality of infantile sexuality; Hopkins' version would junk all the metatheory. (b) The language of psychoanalysis Failure to consider psychoanalysis as at least a candidate science, with all that that involves, weakens part of Dilman's article on unconscious intentions. Dilman, more strongly than Hopkins, 'tends to collapse Freudian claims into commonsense, or what are sometimes called folk-psychological claims about the unconscious' (Sharpe, commenting on Dilman, p. 187). For - I think - the same reasons as Hopkins, Dilman ignores the metatheory. Coruscating upon the increasingly thin ice of 'ordinary language' philosophy, Dilman is friendly to the idea of 'unconscious intentions'; but insists that these are intentions in an 'attenuated sense'. 'Attenuated', because they behave in many ways unlike our everyday, commonsense, intentions. But anyone who takes seriously the pretensions of psychoanalysis to be a genuine science would want to ask Dilman whether electrons have an 'attenuated' spin, or whether the physicists' notion of 'energy' is 'attenuated'. The point surely is that any science will adopt and adapt terms from everyday usage; unconscious intentions diverge considerably from everyday intentions, sure, but equally spinning electrons are substantially different from spinning tops, and the physicists' 'energy' diverges from the everyday notion of what we get if we eat a Mars bar. No attenuation: only adoption and adaptation, if we are talking about a science - which must develop and refine its own vocabulary. Precisely the same point diminishes the force of the comments (scattered throughout the volume) about Freud's 'anthropomorphic', or 'metaphorical', terminology; the personification of the ego or superego, for example. Now certainly there are clear cases where Freud does indeed use full-blown anthropomorphic metaphors (typically, though, flagging them as such); this is usually heuristic, to assist with the understanding of abstruse or abstract contentions. If their metaphorical status is not acknowledged, it is easy to be misled. For instance, Porte interprets the dream 'censor' much too literally (pp. 331-3) and not surprisingly finds its behaviour incoherent; if it were a human agent, it would indeed be bizarre. But most of the time it is a moot, and not a particularly interesting, question whether</page><page sequence="7">ANALYSING FREUD 247 a term is 'metaphorical' or not. To see the importance of this, consider this remark of Eagle (p. 101): to speak of unconscious repressed desires is to speak in an 'as if' metaphorical manner which does no harm so long as one is aware that one is speaking metaphorically and as long as one is aware that terms such as unconscious or repressed desires are extensions of and derived from (perhaps degenerate forms of) ordinary desires. Essentially, an unconscious or repressed desire is ... a neurophysiological phenomenon ... (Eagle's extended, derived, or degenerate desires are evidently analogous to Dilman's 'attenuated' intentions.) The immediate response to this is to say that it begs the question against a central and indispensable strand of Freud's theories: the strong claim that unconscious and conscious mental phenomena are equally real, interact and interlock, and that we must extend our conceptual framework - not worrying whether or not it fits everyday parlance - to accommodate them. This is not a small point but a major question. The question is to what extent, if at all, the use of and divergence from commonsense psychological notions weakens, or strengthens, psychoanalysis. If it is a science, neither: it makes no difference either way. If it is not a science - indeed, if it is to be an 'extension' of common sense - then any 'attenuated' or 'degenerate' use of an everyday notion is equally an attenuation of the value of psychoanalysis. The moral of this is: if individual psychoanalytic notions are to be judged by comparison to commonsense notions, rather than by comparing them to terms of undisputed science, then the pass has been sold already. 'Real' sciences care not at all how far the terms of their theories fit with everyday terms, and will wait to see to what extent their concepts are or are not 'metaphorical'. (c) Evidence and common sense The appeal to common sense brings in a further question that reverberates in one form or another throughout the book. Hopkins and others hope to defend psychoanalysis by stressing the continuity of the psychoanalytic vocabulary with that of common sense: we can cite as causes of behaviour unconscious motives or reasons much as we do with 'ordinary' motives and reasons in everyday life. (Thus they would not want to call them 'degenerate', or 'attenuated'.) But Grunbaum argues that unconscious motives are crucially unlike everyday motives and reasons; not because they are attenuated, but because they do not conform to the practical syllogism, and hence cannot draw on the evidential basis which that provides (cf. pp. 8-9). However Freud thought, according to Grinbaum, that both unconscious and conscious motives could be causes, and these claims can be assessed by standards common to any scientific causal hypotheses; and in psychoanalysis in particular we also have the Tally argument (see footnote 6). Grinbaum's objection to these claims, and hence part of his objection to the scientific status of psychoanalysis, is that the evidence is insufficient to validate them. So it is here that 'Hopkins and Grinbaum are most at odds. For Hopkins would use issues of 'consilience' (which we could, not too misleadingly, regard as 'coherence') to assist in the defence of a specific causal claim; this in part just because we do, routinely, use such considerations in everyday</page><page sequence="8">248 KATHLEEN V. WILKES psychological attributions. In other words, Hopkins would allow himself a more generous evidential latitude than Griinbaum; and might argue that a coherence theory of evidence is perfectly compatible with a correspondence theory of truth. If we restrict ourselves to the confines of the Tally argument, then causal claims in the clinical theory are inadequately supported; Griinbaum seems to think that where such support is lacking, defence could be provided if they could be assimilated to the practical syllogism; this fails to obtain in psychoanalytic explanations. But Hopkins (who is here surely true to Freud: the centrality of the Tally Argument to Freud is somewhat exaggerated by Griinbaum) points out that internal cogency or coherence, wholly familiar to us from our commonsensical explanations but yet not the same as an application of the practical syllogism, is 'dense, deep and extensive' (p. 39); it involves not merely determinist cause-effect relations, but also coherences, patterns, interconnections. Considerations quite independent of the inductivist strategy of the Tally Argument might or could show that 'psychoanalytic theory may... be cogent, but related to inductive methods no more closely than commonsense psychology itself (p. 37). This I think is where we can draw a line most clearly between the strategy of Hopkins and that of Ricoeur, or Habermas. For Hopkins is suggesting that considerations independent of inductivism and the practical syllogism can adequately determine or defend a specific claim in psychoanalysis as in commonsense psychology more generally. These considerations may be in part 'ineliminably interpretive' (p. 54); but whereas in hermeneutics you can choose your own interpretation, for Hopkins there will or could be one right answer, which is determined by these considerations. It seems to me that both Griinbaum and Hopkins are right and wrong. Griinbaum is right that the Tally Argument will not alone sustain the weight that - he claims - Freud laid upon it, and also that unchecked hermeneutic interpretation would not deserve to be taken seriously; Hopkins is right in downplaying the Tally Argument and insisting that we have a richer range of evidence for our interpretions. Both are also wrong, though; Griinbaum is over-restrictive about what can count as evidence for causal claims in the clinical theory, but Hopkins, by ignoring the metatheory, has to place all the weight on the parallel with commonsense psychology. This latter can sustain some weight, but not all of it; the substantial claims of the deep theory provide a basis for asserting a 'consilience' that goes far beyond common sense. Put another way, if the metatheoretical claims held good, then factors unknown to common sense (defence mechanisms, symbolism, the manifest/latent content distinction, transfor- mational processes, condensation, displacement, repression, resistance, overdeter- mination, etc.) could support, albeit indirectly, individual causal claims in particular instances. Naturally all these metatheoretical posits need support, and may indeed lack it; but such a debate would require different arguments. (d) Alternative theories Many of the contributors, particularly perhaps Erwin and Cioffi, complain that experimental evidence in support of Freudian hypotheses is weakened because one could always find an alternative explanation.</page><page sequence="9">ANALYSING FREUD 249 This is not a good argument. It is surely true that all hypotheses on 'the moving frontiers of science' have potential alternatives; and this is not per se a drawback. Ex postfacto, the ingenious mind can always dream up a rival explanation to any offered; this is as true in physics as it is in psychoanalysis. The existence of alternative and incompatible theories is a wholly healthy feature of all sciences, since it encourages those committed to one or the other of the competitors to devise experiments and observations that might come down in favour of one or the other. (This thought is common in the philosophy of science, and takes extreme form in Feyerabend passim.) What is intellectually dishonest, however (given that we are discussing a theory that purports to be comprehensive), is to argue that Freudian psychoanalysis is unsupported because: for Smith's neurosis we can offer X as an alternative explanation, for Brown's neurosis we can offer Y, for Jones', Z,... and so forth. This is ad hoc and more of a spoiling operation than an attempt to supply a real alternative; Kline (ch. 10 passim) is entirely right to stamp on it. Hypotheses can win support even where there are rivals. What is needed is, rather, something like Farrell's (1981, pp. 104-22) sustained illustration of how rival schools of Kleino-Freudian, and Adlerian, persuasions would treat the same patient. His example is imaginary, a thought experiment; but is based on an understanding of how two theories would treat and assess the same disorder. All are aware that there are competing theories in psychoanalysis; and even within 'Freudians', or 'Kleinians', there are distinct groups. Moreover many would accept some of the low-level claims of a given theory without accepting all the metatheoretical claims. Again, some see Freudian psychoanalysis as a collection of theories - cf. Kline (p. 231) - while at the same time working to test experimentally some of the key metatheoretical postulates. Each competing theory has its own such postulates, and therewith its favoured core notions which carry with them the preferred data bases: infantile sexuality, the Collective Unconscious, birth traumas, identity crises, mid-life crises, and so forth. They differ too in the extent to which they conform, or attempt to conform, to the standards thought to hold in other sciences (those who attack Freud as 'unscientific' would findJung a far easier target - indeed, a hermeneutic interpretation seems well-placed here); in fact, they differ in the extent to which they think theory matters. Related to this last is a difficulty specific to psychoanalysis: there are those who attend more to the therapeutic success of the theory's application than to any likelihood of its truth; cf. Storr: It is my belief that we shall soon see the disappearance of the analytical schools as discrete entities... the labels of 'Jungian', 'Kleinian', 'Freudian', will soon become less and less important as research discloses the common factors that lead to a successful outcome in psychotherapy, which, to my mind, is largely independent of the school to which the psychotherapist belongs. (1979, p. viii; note that the title of this book is The ART of Psychotherapy; capitals mine) Certainly it seems that evidence of therapeutic success is risky support for the theory from which the therapy derives (if any). For, as we know, the techniques for behaviour control and modification which grew out of behaviourism have long</page><page sequence="10">250 KATHLEEN V. WILKES survived the downfall of that strategy in psychology. On the other hand, of course, the data from the consulting room are an indispensable source for any would-be theory, even though - it should never be forgotten - Freud drew heavily from extraclinical evidence. Nothing seems to me more likely than that if, or when, we have a well-supported dynamic theory it will look very unlike classical Freudianism. What goes without saying is that the construction of such a theory will be an arduous and painstaking task. But the ambition remains a worthy one. III. REDUCTIONISM The problem of reductionism, otherwise known as the mind-body problem, has been with us for a very long time. Inevitably there is a rich and mixed literature, both scientific and philosophical, attempting to come to terms with it. But when psychoanalytic hypotheses are at issue, the charity extended to the 'traditional' problem is conspicuously missing. The untutored reader of this book is likely to get thoroughly confused, inasmuch as few contributors locate the problem in the same place. It would be helpful to begin by sketching the variety of relations which 'reduction' might suggest. (a) Reduction and elimination We can consider the overall question as one of the reducibility or irreducibility of psychology (and psychoanalysis) to physiology. But the notion of'reductionism' itself covers a multitude of sins and successes. Sometimes, when theory T1 is reduced to theory T2, this serves to validate and underpin T1; T2 explains why T1 is as successful as it is in its domain. T2 would not 'replace' T1 in such cases: T1 might be massively more convenient, simpler to use, indispensable. By identifying elements in the ontology of T1 with those in T2, T2 tells us more about them; tells us what they really are. At the other extreme: sometimes a new theory replaces and rejects its predecessor; cf. the rejection of the phlogiston theory of heat by oxygen theory. That reduction eliminated phlogiston. And of course there are all stages in between these two extremes; often, for example, T2 reduces a corrected version of Ti. To confuse matters a bit further, but necessarily: in psychology (including psychoanalysis) we do not have two theories to relate: psychology, and neuroscience. Instead, we have many levels of theories: psychology, neuropsychology, neurophysiology are three labels each of which comprise several 'reduced/reducing' levels of description. All of them will need to co-evolve, in the light of what each level is trying to explain, and in the light of what is likely to explain it. This is an argument with many implications. But my primary point here is to insist that even if psychology in general, or psychoanalysis in particular, is 'reduced to' neuroscience, this does not necessarily entail that we can thereafter do without it. (b) Exaggerating the mental-physical distinction I have already argued that it was both legitimate and necessary to extend common sense, ordinary language, terms to cover postulated unconscious states. If this is not agreed, then - as Moore points out - one tends with Eagle, and Rubinstein (1976), to</page><page sequence="11">ANALYSING FREUD 251 exaggerate the distinction between the everyday psychological terms used by the layman to describe normal human behaviour and all other sorts of terms; to 'portray the clinical theory as conceived in the vocabulary of persons and the metapsychology as conceived in the vocabulary of mechanistic causation' (Moore, p. 144). That cannot be right. Certainly it is false to Freud, since his metatheoretical claims are through and through permeated by intensional and purposive terms. Nor is such a large gulf respected in other sciences; neuropsychology and computer scientists use intensional terminology (and hence not blatantly 'mechanistic' terminology) in a wholly unembarrassed way to characterize the functions of subsystems of the brain or machine. The assumption that there is a broad and looming chasm, with no steps in between, separating 'personal-mental' and 'subpersonal-mechanistic' descriptions tempts one to the unworkable claim that 'unconscious wishes, emotions etc. must be conceived in terms of brain states' (ibid.). Schafer (1976) and Dilman (here but more markedly in his 1972) get to the same dichotomy by putting the weight of what it is to be mental on to privileged access or agency. This means (as Moore resumes on p. 148; I shall continue to quote him, because he has hit several nails firmly on the head): In short, for Schafer as for Dilman, Freud's metapsychology and its theoretical unconscious is caught in a dilemma: the mentalistic vocabulary of persons... is not a vocabulary in which it makes sense to construct a deep theory such as the metapsychology purports to be . But it also is true that any theory constructed in a non-action vocabulary ... cannot be a theory about the mind, for those features - agency and privileged access - constitute what is mental. It should be apparent that what we have encountered is the doctrine of category differences between the extensional, non-Intentional, observa- tion-dependent, mechanistic, causal vocabulary appropriate to explain movements of bodies... on the one hand, and the intensional, Intentional, non-observational, purposive, reason-giving vocabulary appropriate to explain human actions, on the other. As Moore points out, the doctrine of category mistakes gets in the way of theory construction (and not only in psychoanalysis, I would add, but in all theories). I find this such an obviously correct point that I see little to be gained by rehearsing all the arguments for it. Moreover it would be a waste of time given the manifest neglect - usually a highly profitable neglect - of such a 'chasmatic' distinction in the science of neuropsychology. Sokolov is scarcely being 'mechanistic' when he ascribes to the rat's amygdala the 'comparator function', which 'compares incoming with expected stimuli'. (The fact that a vast distinction between the causal-mechanistic and the anthropomorphic is hard to defend is amusingly shown in Haldane's attempt to contrast them. He claims that the following passage of Freud's illustrates the mechanistic conception: [The id] is filled with energy reaching it from the instincts but it has no organisation, produces no collective will, but only a striving to bring about the</page><page sequence="12">252 KATHLEEN V. WILKES satisfaction of the instinctual needs subject to the observance of the pleasure principle ... Contrary impulses may converge to form compromises. (p. 115) The italics, of course, are mine; they highlight expressions that by no stretch of the imagination could be called 'mechanistic'!) To sum up: neglect of the metatheory, and hence attention only to the low-level 'clinical theory', is inevitable once commonsense psychology is seen as the heart of psychoanalytic validation; hence it becomes increasingly tempting to draw an uncrossable wall between theory and metatheory, the mental and the physiological. This is something which Moore sees clearly (note that he does not endorse the view he here describes): Since the clinical theory and the metapsychology operate in different 'universes of discourse', it must be a mistake about the category in which such theories operate to conjoin the concepts of the clinical theory with those of the metapsychology into one overarching theory. Psychoanalysis, on this view, can only be the clinical theory. The other stuff, the metapsychology, is just that - other stuff, the concern of some other discipline, presumably biology, but not of a true science of mind. (p. 146) Since the metapsychology is through and through intensionally laden, such a picture must be radically wrong if, or in so far as, it is correct to think of biology as 'mechanistic'. (c) The intentional chasm Let us suppose that we accept the brute fact that Freud's metatheoretical claims purported to refer to 'mental' or 'intensional' phenomena. Then, however, this generates another strand of the mind-body problem, for, according to Haldane, 'it is impossible to succeed in the project of providing a naturalistic explanation of intentional phenomena' (p. 130). This conclusion is not justified by Haldane's arguments. He rejects as 'fatally flawed' (p. 128) the strategy discussed by many, but particularly by Dennett, of 'anthropomorphic homuncularism'. Essentially this strategy tries to explain a 'personal' capacity () by postulating 'sub-personal' sub-capacities or functions a, b, c ...; and then explains a, b, c, ... in terms of sub-sub-functions x, y, z ...; and so on, until we reach 'very stupid' functions which can be characterized in 'purely mechanistic' terms. These low-level stupid functions might be compared to (say) a thermostat; although we can say that the thermostat 'notices' the ambient temperature, we can alternatively describe and explain what it does in purely physical terms. Haldane objects that this strategy '[reintroduces the intentional] in the explanans in a wholly regressive way' (p. 129). This is because the powers which we suppose the subsystems to perform (the stupider homunculi) still involve representations, and the problem is not to show 'how things can have so much of them but rather one of explaining how they can have them at all' (ibid.). For Haldane, intensionality, or the existence of representations, is all-or-notl-ing.</page><page sequence="13">ANALYSING FREUD 253 I find this impossible to believe. I shall not try to argue this in terms of the computer analogy: that has, in connection with intensionality, too many problems of its own that do not concern us here. We need only look to neuroscience; where time and again the 'homuncularist strategy' is bearing fruit. Low-level functions can be called 'expecting/comparing', 'detecting', 'synthesizing'; as we go down the hierarchy the degree of intensionality fades, the representations do indeed (pace Haldane) become more limited (cf. the primary visual cortex, where cell-columns 'detect horizontals', or 'detect colour contrasts'). As Lycan puts it: there is no spot either on the continuum of teleologicalness or amid the various levels of nature where it is plainly natural to drive a decisive wedge, where descriptions of nature can be split neatly into a well-behaved, purely 'structural', purely mechanistic mode and a more abstract and more dubious, intentional, and perhaps vitalistic mode - certainly not any spot that also corresponds to any intuitive distinction between the psychological and the merely chemical, for there is too much and too various biology in between. (1987, p. 45) Possibly Haldane is derailed by Dennett's 'instrumentalism'; he treats this as Dennett's conviction that psychological states or events do not really exist, and turns him into an eliminativist. But first: Dennett has publicly regretted calling his strategy instrumentalistic. It was never a good label for his view; he chose as an analogy for his instrumentalism the centre of gravity of an object, and the equator - almost all the instrumentalists I know would be realist about both of those. Second, I would argue that what counts as realism in psychology (and in the program states of computer science) has not adequately been thought through. Here it is useful to consider computers; are 'virtual machines' real machines with 'real' states? This sort of question deserves much more attention than it has received so far. Dennett is not an 'eliminative materialist' of the Churchland stripe. Unlike most of the contributors to this collection, he does not think that all 'reductions' entail the 'elimination' of the reduced level of description; indeed, Dennett has done more than most to insist upon the indispensability of the 'Intentional Stance'. Put another way, no matter how much we know about electronic engineering, we had better go on treating the chess-playing computer as an intentional system, if we want to beat it. So I do not see any gulf or chasm here. More a Berlin Wall; high time it was demolished: it should never have been there in the first place. I agree with Moore that Freud had tried for a version of structural-functional analysis, long before anyone had so thought of, or labelled, it; Moore offers the fruitful suggestion that the metatheory provides the first of many levels of analysis at the subpersonal level. I agree too that Freud almost certainly got much of this subpersonal level wrong. The best philosophical/scientific materialist was and remains Aristotle. Yet he thought that the brain was there to cool the blood, and that the heart did the cognitive work. He got a lot wrong, but his method is the dominant method in psychology today. (He was the first functionalist.) Freud had fewer basic neurophysiological facts wrong. His ambition - which he never dropped, even though he dropped the 1895 Project - was to produce a science which would one day be validated or rejected on the</page><page sequence="14">254 KATHLEEN V. WILKES grounds of neuroscience. But he thought, quite rightly, that the day was not his: it should be made quite clear that the uncertainty of our speculation has been greatly increased by the necessity of borrowing from the science of biology. Biology is truly a land of unlimited possibilities. We may expect it to give us the most surprising information and we cannot guess what answers it will return in a few dozen years to the questions we have put to it. They may be of a kind which will blow away the whole of our artificial structure of hypotheses. (S.E., xviii, p. 60) Freud wrote that in 1920. The day may not yet be ours either.
