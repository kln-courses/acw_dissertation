<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARIEL, OR DAVID-CULTUS' BY ALLAN H. GODBEY Carrsville, Kentucky We read of David that "he made him a name when he returned from smiting the Syrians in the valley of salt."2 Comparing with the award of Geburah to other kings because of notable victories, we may feel sure that David's Geburah dates from this triumph. Does the passage mean that David's name was changed At this time? Change of name at accession to the chieftainship, or in consequence of a vic- tory, is found among many peoples.3 Mattaniah becomes Zedekiah; Eliakim becomes Jehoiakim;4 Temmujin becomes Genghis Khan; Pub- lius Cornelius Scipio becomes "Africanus," etc. Is the name "David" assumed at this time? For, as scholars know, El-hanan of Bethlehem is the slayer of Goliath in II Sam. 21:19 and I Chron. 20:50. This name may be "an El is gracious." What we have seen of the superstitions of David's time does not permit us to say what particular "strong spirit" is implied. The possession of unusual qualities, or the attain- ment of exceptional success, is all that is certain. If we read it "a gra- cious or successful Strong One," the suggestion of the title approxi- mates El-Gibbor. But David's supposed ability to summon good elohim and banish bad ones may be the implication, rather than his prowess in war. The title "DWID" suggests aided by DAd (DWD?). We have seen his connection with the Tammuz-cult, and he may have considered himself specially aided by this patron-baal on some occa- sions. Present data are not decisive. Omitting other questions, the immediate one is, Did not the masses extend cultus honors to David in his lifetime? He is a "messenger of the elohtm" to some.5 He had that reputation with Achish.A His prominence in popular traditions 1 This paper is the concluding section of a long one on the cultus of Hebrew kings (Ezek. 43:7-9), and other Gibborim; hence allusions to preceding material. A volume on the Hebrew cult of the dead is in preparation. 2 II Sam. 8:13. 3 E.g., in Mrs. Pringle, Mountains of the Moon, p. 152. 4 II Kings 23:34; 24:17. 5 II Sam. 14:17; 20:19-27. 6 1 Sam. 29:9. 253</page><page sequence="2">254 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SEMITIC LANGUAGES as a great military leader, and the long-cherished hope for another such suggest that more than any other El-Gibb6r king he received such acclaim. As to the cultus of his stele or cenotaph in various for- tress-cities, we have some decisive information. To make this clear, two important terms or phrases must first be noticed. The logic of Gibb6r-cultus requires that the mighty shade shall come with his spirit-hosts to the relief of his beleaguered petitioners; camp with them on every battlefield, be on guard at every frontier. We catch reflections of this popular thought. A messenger of Yahweh campeth round about them that fear Him,' and delivereth them ..... The young lions [choicest warriors; see following] shall lack and suffer hunger; but they that seek Yahweh shall not lack any good. The discomfiture of a mighty shade whose hero-bones were expected to assure victory (as the box of the elohim of Israel was expected to do in I Sam., chap. 4) is thus portrayed: "Do they not know [that they] are workers of nonsense, [these] eaters-up of my people [as] they eat bread?2 They are not invoking a God! There they seed-curse the seed --but there is no such seed-curse : for God is scattering the bones of him that is camping against thee!" And with the scattering and de- struction of his box of bones, the beleaguering shade is powerless. In II Kings 6:17 f. we have again the same popular expectation of spirit- warriors and horses and chariots coming to one's aid as in II Sam. 5: 24; and Josephus, some twelve hundred years after David's time, tells of spirit-camps and armies in the sky.4 We also notice that the spot where Danite warriors consult the baalim of Judah west of the "City of Groves" is a mahaneh-dan,"camping-place of the judging spirits."' Similarly, when Jacob encountered some elohtm-messengers, he said, "A camping-place of elohim is this."6 So we understand that the 1 Ps. 34:7-10. 2 A widespread war and hunter magic, to be seen in the "war-medicine" of many peo- ples today; devouring some victim ceremonially and prognosticating success from the ease and thoroughness of the performance; as with an ox; Tyler, op. cit., p. 114, quoting Sam- uelson: ceremony claimed to make the Zulu eaters invulnerable. 3 Three times the word pahad, "thigh, scrotum, testes," is used in this line. The curs- ing all one's family or posterity while laying hand upon scrotum is familiar still in the Arab world; as in Gen. 24:2 f. In the case of the ceremonial war-fetish victim, the eating of the testes means extinction of the enemy's race. To "eat up" the enemy is a regular Bantu and African-Arab idiom still. 4 Wars vi. v. 3. 5 Judg. 18:12. 6 Gen. 32:1-2; cf. 28:11-22. Probably similar experiences. The Mahanaim, "two camping places," may combine this with 32:22-32; the two experiences being at adjacent spots.</page><page sequence="3">ARIEL, OR DAVID-CULTUS 255 "spirit-camp" of the mighty David is expected by the populace at many an outpost, in every emergency. The second fact is the use of the word "lion" as the regular term for "valiant warrior," instead of the word gibbor. This seems to be regular in ancient Moab, throughout Gilead, among some South Ara- bian tribes, probably in southern Judah;' is known in modern Abyssi- nia and among some African tribes. Thus "Great Lion" is a title of Marotse kings;2 every Wasambara chief is "Lion"; the paramount one, simba mwenni, is "Supreme Lion" or "Lion of Lions."3 Lion is the complimentary title of a chief among Nigerian tribes;4 in South Africa in Mtoko's country is an order of lion prophets who maintain a lion-cultus (of hero ancestors), control lions, and bear the name "Lion.'"5 But this is a species of beatification, or Geburah. "All Africa," says Dan Crawford, "believes in the transmigration of living man into living lion," as well as in the reappearance of dead chieftains in lion form. The famous Matabele chief, Lo Bengula, was exhibited to his followers for a few days after death, then placed in a lion's den upon his royal throne, with various royal possessions, and a great cairn of stones raised over him, and a strong palisade made about the cavern. The lions returned to their den during this work and killed two chief- tains. This was eminently satisfactory. The dead king in lion disguise had chosen his own attendants for the spirit-world.6 The Zulu chief, Chaka, utilized this notion that lions were former chiefs of the tribe, and that the "inspired" could interpret their news from the land of the Amalemo, or "ancestor spirits." He hired a man to disappear for a time, while his wife would go about reporting that a lion had taken him from his hut in the night. After some months he would reappear, telling how the lion had taken him into the underworld, and shown 1 Gen. 49:9; Jer:12:8. 2 Coillard, p. 172. 3 Krapf, pp. 225, 302, 321. 4 Tremearne, pp. 31, 43. 5 Bent, Ruined Cities of Mashona-Land, pp. 326-31; Hall, Prehistoric Rhodesia, pp. 127, 357; Selous, p. 400. s M. Jalla, cited by Coillard, pp. 532-33. Since the African, like most savage peoples, is prone to consider the first animal that appears at a grave as a "resurrection" or reincar- nation of the deceased, this ancient widespread habit of cave-burial of notables is a leading factor in turning dead chieftains into the cave-haunting lions. The more warlike tribes do not bury common folks at all yet, in a number of African tribes.</page><page sequence="4">256 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SEMITIC LANGUAGES him all the delights of the land of spirits-which revelations were care- fully framed to further Chaka's schemes. (This "prophet" was even- tually killed by a leopard.)' But this means that the prophets of the hero-dead who have been lionized claim the power to summon and send such lions upon any errand they may name. A great forest-ravine upon the Lualaba is a vast whispering gallery; any sound echoes and re-echoes until it blends into an organ-like murmur. It is the Chivawa-"spot where spirits blend"-and the mighty dead from hundreds of miles around assemble there; the natives bring all knotty matters to this spirit council. Kavoto-"lurker to kill"-is supreme fetishman at this high court of appeal. He summons lions, sends them upon errands of ven- geance. They are familiars at his hut and table. Whatever mischief they may do to men is as spirits at Kavoto's command.2 No Luban would doubt this, any more than an early English or Scotch-Puritan would doubt that the familiars of the witches they hunted appeared in various animal forms. Arabs (and some white officials!) are regular customers of this lion-master. But this very notion we find in the records of ancient Palestine. The newcomers in II Kings 17:25 ff. are raided by lions, and decide that it is because they do not know the stipulations of the "elohim of the land," and the narrative shows that the various local gibborim, or "saints," are in mind; and that the priest furnished the complainants expects to control the lions by rehabilitating each bdamh-house or makom. The lions are either transformed heroes or are directed by them, and the priest claimed all the powers of Kavoto above. We glimpse like claims in the story of the two clashing prophets in I Kings, chapter 13: "A man of the elohim"3 of Judah assails the elohim of Bethel; and an old local prophet, whose elohim is not specified-the editors not wishing to give any credit to those of Bethel-first de- ceives the "man of the elohim" of Judah, invites him to a (ritual?) 1 Isaacs, I, 339-42.

It appears that the powers claimed by the Bethel elohim and their spokesmen are identical with those in II Kings, chapter 17; and the said Bethel eloh'm have proved themselves mightier than those of Ju- dah. The monument placed over the worsted prophet of the elohim of Judah must have recounted the tale and heralded the prowess of the elohim of Bethel; for the tale was well known in Josiah's time' and must have been dinned into Judah's ears a thousand times. But claim- ing the deeds of an earlier boaster for one's self or one's own gods is a familiar trick of the ancient Orient. So pious Yahwist editors had the last word. Seizing the monument's tale of lion-manifestation by Bethel elohim, instead of repudiating the incident as purely casual, they have suppressed the name of the Bethel elohim, and with an addi- tional touch or two have claimed the marvel for Yahweh. It is exact- ly what would occur when rival baalim were arrayed against each other, with later Yahwists as arbiters of the conflicting claims. Many Syrian and Palestinian peasantry-e.g., the Nusairiyeh-considered remnants of the ancient Canaanite population,2 still hold that the spirits of evil men pass into the bodies of mischievous animals, as they were thought to enter the swine.3 The excavations at Megiddo recov- ered a number of lion figures,4 and Sellin found a lion stamped upon a jar handle at Jericho, and several on cultus equipment at Taanach. The immediate significance is that these emphasize the importance of the foregoing lion-lore in the Bethel jurisdiction. And here must be noted the fact that Ashtart in Egyptian reliefs is pictured standing naked on a lion, holding a snake in one hand and a lotus flower in the other; and bearing the name Kedesh.5 The explanation that the lion and serpent "symbolize the danger of her cult" is too abstract and must be reversed. No god wins worshipers by advertising that it is dangerous to worship him. The portrayal in question simply announces that 1 II Kings 23:17-18. 2 Oliphant, pp. 34 ff., 39. 3 In Matt. 8:31, 32. Arab tales abound in such lore. So, also, Bliss, p. 309, for the Nu- sairiyeh belief. 4 Schumacher, p. 90. 5 Cited by Wood, pp. 261 f.</page><page sequence="6">258 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SEMITIC LANGUAGES Kedesh-Ashtart is "Mistress of Lions"; that "Thou shalt tread on the lion and adder: the young lion and dragon shalt thou trample under feet."' The foregoing old lion-master prophet of an unnamed elohim we may suspect to have been a prophet of Ashtart.2 This is supported in the Gilgame' epos by the charge that the ruthless ITtar destroys lions, at her whim, and by the promise to the dying Engidu that his enchantress, the Uhat, the impersonation of Ibtar, shall be hunted about the field at his funeral, "clad in a lion's skin;" in which we may recognize the belief that Ashtart or her priests, etc., could appear in lion-form. With this identical mode of thought concerning "lion-spirits" or "spirit lions" in Africa and ancient and modern Palestine compare the fact that in ancient Egypt Osiris is portrayed upon a lion-skin couch.3 This recalls the modern African chief sitting upon a lion skin, being buried in a lion's cave sometimes, and reappearing as a lion. Observe, also, that modern Moors and Arabs retain traces of the lion as an an- cestor-spirit. Thus a barren Algerian woman instead of a pilgrimage to some shrine of a sidi, or powerful "saint," may seek the opportunity to touch or invoke a tame lion.4 The Phoenicians also used the lion- figure or head as the emblem or badge of the dead; and inscriptions show the erection of pairs of "lions" at various altars.5 Remembering the intimate association of Phoenicia and Israel, and the employment of Phoenician artists upon Solomon's temple, etc., we may be sure that ion-decorations in Hebrew cultus would mean the same as in Phoenicia; and that a lion-headed post or stele, in some Hebrew shrine or sacred inclosure would be the visible imago of some heroized dead. Leaping across to the Euphrates, and Tigris, we observe that the Sedim, or "guardian spirits," of Assyrian architecture are sometimes in lion-form. We notice that Nergal, "great lion," is one title that the 1 Ps. 91:13. 2 Observe that the Old Testament scrupulously avoids naming the god of any "false prophet." 3 Budge, Osiris, Vol. II, passim. 4 Fraser, L V W, p. 78. 5 Cook, p. 56, compares Greek inscriptions dedicating two "lions" to Baal-zeus at Sidon; but, unaware of this lion-lore, concludes that the Phoenician arwm, where there is no parallel Greek inscription, must mean some sort of "hearth." What kind of altar needs two additional "hearths"; and where are they placed? The sides of a Palestine altar dis- covered by Sellin at Tell-Taanek were decorated with four lions: PEF (1902), pp. 301-4. Plaques of bronze would explain the "lions" that perplex Cooke.</page><page sequence="7">ARIEL, OR DAVID-CULTUS 259 ancient Sumerians bestowed upon their sun-god; suggesting that lesser divinities were also lesser lions. And a Sumerian myth of creation pic- tures that event in terms of the earlier agricultural settlements along the lower Euphrates. But the founder or "creator" of these begin- nings is Ug, the lion-god, in company with Nintu, "mistress of birth."' But this simply means that those ancient Sumerians, like the Africans, regarded lions as powerful "ancestors:" the Sumerians maintaining a highly organized and meticulous cult of the dead; and a lion-god as lord of introduction into the underworld is as logical as with the fore- going Bantu folk. There is but a step, psychologically, from the no- tion that a dead king reappears as a great lion at his cavern-tomb, or jungle-grave, to the notion of a "great lion" as lord of all the dead. And such is Ner-gal (Sumerian, "Great Lion"), the Lord of Kutha, the "Lord of the Land of No-Return," of war and plague; Allatu, "the Mighty;" goddess of the dead; Ere' Kigal," mistress of the Great Land" of the dead, are regularly pictured as lion-headed divinities, which simply means that lion-heads or lion-headed figures were early marks of the tombs of noted warriors, chieftains, etc. So lion-headed demons of the underworld are pictured along with Allatu, and lion- faced divinities recur repeatedly in their older art. Hedin2 and Kiese- ritsky observe that the lion-head medals found at Borassan in Turke- stan have a marked anthropomorphic character, some having a close resemblance to Gilgames. It makes us think of Gilgames as a mighty lion, or as a master of lions. Some of his portrayals show him handling them as mere puppies. The following Luristan lore and these lion- medals remind us that medieval Turkish chiefs and conquerors regu- larly boasted the title "Lion";3 Alp Arslan, "Valiant Lion"; Kizil Ar- slan, "Red Lion"; Kilidge Arslan, etc., while "Lion" remains a title of a valiant warrior in the mountain of Luristan, and his grave may be marked with a rude stone lion-figure. The living lion is still an intelli- gent hero-spirit, and Islam's only effect has been that some are held to be "true-believers," and others are "infidels." The Lurs have an im- 1 Barton, "Ancient Babylonian Expressions of the Religious Spirit," JAOS, XXXVII (May, 1917), 23-42. 2 Central Asia, II, 752 f., with illustrations. 3 In the Sumerian, "lion" is commonly written UR.MAH, "great dog"; UR appear- ing really an ideogram for all carnivores. Where we find this UR in a personal name, can it be an abbreviation, meaning really "Lion of N.N."? See "dog" and "lion" synonyms.

So a devout Lur, meeting a lion, will take off his cap and say, "0 cat of Ali, I am the servant of Ali! Pass by my house, by the head of Ali!"; an ad- juration that no lion who is a true believer will disregard.1 These hero- lions who will not harm their own believing clan are absolutely identi- cal with the African chieftain-lions who will never harm a fellow-tribes- man-unless they have been "bewitched." But the African can ap- peal to a lion-chief upon his own account-without waiting for the offices of a prophet-as easily as the Lur can. If lions come prowling around a night encampment attracted by the smell of fresh meat, there will be voluble abuse of a chief who would try to steal the meat of humble people instead of killing his own game! Should such tirade fail, the lion will be addressed more seriously. We are travelling peaceably through the country, back to our own chief. We never kill people nor steal anything. This buffalo-meat is ours, not yours, and it does not become a great chief like you to be prowling around in the dark, trying like a hyena to steal the meat of strangers. Go and hunt for yourself, as there is plenty of game in the forest!2 The absolute uniformity of this ancient lion-warrior lore, from Turkestan to Cape Colony, and its immemorial antiquity with similar modes of expression, make us confident that similar lion-terms in Pal- estine or Moab or Arabia must mean the same way of thinking. Now, in old Sabean inscriptions we read, "A hundred lions made an incur- sion upon the land of Himyar"; "And 200 lions of the clan of Humlan sallied forth"; "The lions and their wives, their proteges and all their children."3 All scholars agree that picked warriors (the Hebrew Gib- borim) are meant. But the same idiom appears in Hebrew: "the young lions roared against him; they gave out their voice, and ap- pointed his land for a desolation; his cities were burned to the last man."4 Of nearly a hundred lion-passages in the Old Testament some certainly suggest technical names for valiant warriors.5 These various 1 Layard, Early Adventures, II, 439-45. 2 Livingstone, Zambesi Expedition, p. 179. 3 Lidzbarski, Ephemeris, I, 234. 4 Jer. 2:15: "To the last man"; Hebrew, "without inhabitant."

To use the Sabean words, an asadu' lildhi, "lion of god," is as certain a term as an ish elohtm in the Hebrew, or an Ish elim in the Phoenician.' We can consider at this point Yaghfith, the old Arabian lion-god, of whom a poet sings, "Yaghfith went forth with us against Morad,"2 implying that the lion- image was carried into the battle. But Yaghfith, it has been pointed out, is the "Jeush" of Gen. 36:14, 18, A.V. This "Jeush" is the epo- nym head of an Edomite clan; and is the "son" of an Aholt Bamah- "My residence [tent] is a bamah."3 It must be that Yaghfith is a "lion- ized" Edomite hero, whose bamah was once well known-or who might "manifest" as a lion at any wilderness or cavern-bamah. Our data thus far make it certain that any valiant warrior, upon whom the spirit of some ancestral eloh~m is believed to have come, whom some "strong spirit" (El) inspires, will be hailed as "Spirit- Lion! Divine Lion! Lion of God!" Moslem tradition tells us that Mohammed's uncle, Hamzah, bore the foregoing title of "Lion of Al- lah," or god-lion. It is uncertain whether this heroization was attained before or after his espousal of Mohammed's cause. More definite is our information concerning Mohammed's young cousin, Ali, the first man to believe in him. He was rewarded with the rank of "Lion of God"; "brother," "delegate," "vicar of the prophet"; and "Lion of Allah," "Ali The Lion," he is named in the Moharrem passion-plays.4 The Nusairiyeh of Northern Syria declare that Ali's mother called him "Lion" at birth; and in their ritual repeatedly hail their divine Ali as "my lord the Commander of Bees, Ali The Lion."' Since the Nusairi- yeh hold all savage beasts to be the degraded incarnations of evil men, this laud of Ali comes from another age, when being a "lion of Allah" was but an acknowledgment of divinity, and of the lion's being a dele- gate or messenger of some elohtm. These added laud-epithets cast 1 Lidzbarski, Ephemeris, II, 278; replying to those whose neglect of this lion-lore leaves them perplexed by the Hebrew-Moabite Ariel. 2 Smith, RS, pp. 38, 209. 3 Aholi-bamah is a "daughter" of cAnah, who finds lost mules, Gen. 36:14, 20, 24 f.

So Mtesa of Uganda, in Speke's time, was acclaimed as "Great Lion" and endeavored to copy the stride of the beast, while Molitsane in South Africa was certain to re- sent it should one fail to address him as Mtonga (Motaung)--"Lion Man!"' And Abyssinians, claiming Israelite descent, still cling to "Lion" as a royal Hebrew title. Fit Owrari, "rhinoceros face," has become the honorary title of dashing pioneers or vanguardsmen.2 But the NegU^s, or "emperor," arrogates the supreme title of "Lion"; "I proclaim myself King of Kings, Conquering Lion of Judah."3 Since the "mighty men" of parts of ancient Palestine and Arabia were certainly known as "Lions," "Spirit Lions," etc., we can be sure that in their cultus some distinguishing features were necessary. We have already noticed that rude stone lions mark the grave of an excep- tional Bakhtiyari warrior; and all the data thus far suggest that we should regard the lion-figures discovered at Megiddo4 and elsewhere in Palestine in the same light-memorials of gibbor-baalim. Earlier masseb6th, or "steles," of such must have begun with rude reliefs or affixed plaques, indicative of cultus-rank. In Hebrew, Moabite, or Phoenician, the word aryeh, art, for "lion," would give us ari-el for such spirit-lion or El-Gibbor of kingly line or marvelous valor. The lion-headed figure supposed to be "Moloch" may be also considered. So we understand, then, II Sam. 23:20, Benaiah "slew two Ari-el of Moab"; "divine lion" warriors; perhaps "princes of the blood," like the El-Gibbor of Ps. 45; and the additional aryeh killed at the (sacred?) pit may have been a lion in a tomb, accounted the recrudescence of the entombed chieftain ; or he may have been a warrior-lion not yet hailed as a divine one. We find the idiom general in that region. In the collected saga-slogans in Deut. 33:20-21, the praise of a conqueror captain appears: Blessed the Enlarger of Gad, as a Lion abiding! And he rendeth the arm [shoulder] yea the crown of the head! 1 Arbousset, pp. 304-6. Since African tribes often change names, and often call them- selves by the name of some noted ancestral chief (Arbousset, pp. 261, 306-7; Livingstone, Last Journals, p. 493), the people of a noted lion chief might be hastily cited by someone as a case of totemism. 2 Parkyns, I, 155. 3 Vivian, p. 237. 4 Schumacher, p. 90. 5 Cf. the story of Putnam going into the cave after the wolf.</page><page sequence="11">ARIEL, OR DAVID-CULTUS 263 And he looked out the chief'-land for himself For there the portion [field] of the lawgiver would be well protected. When the heads of the people came, a Saddik2 covenant of Yahweh he made, And his decisions [are] with Israel. Now observe that Gad had notable reputation for brigandage. "Gad is a troop of plunderers! A troop of plunderers shall plunder him; but he shall plunder at the last," reads Stanley.3 Second: Some- where in their early marauding career they had seized the Moabite strongholds of Ataroth4 Dibon, etc. Ataroth-shophan in this passage must be a mispointing of Ataroth-sapun. For sap4n is the term for "well protected" in the foregoing Deuteronomy passage. Third: The unnamed "Enlarger of Gad" abides5 in this stronghold "as a lion"; strongly suggesting a lion-stele in his bamah. Fourth: In David's out- law days a band of daring Gadites joined him-some of them heads of "hundreds," some of "thousands."6 It will be observed that they are not members of David's warrior-council of II Samuel, chapter 23; but they are "Gibborim of the Hel"' and lion-faced; which recalls the lion-faced medals reported above by Hedin from Turkestan. The fact that low-relief plaques of clay or terra-cotta are the dominant form of art in Palestine as late as the time of David, and that Ashtart plaques are most numerous about same time, suggests that more ambitious art in stone or metal would copy the prevailing type. The lion-faced Gibbortm may have been pictured in the Hl1 by such plaques; the Cy- priote stele-portrayal prevails much later. 1 Capital city? 2 See chap. vii. 3 Sinai and Palestine, p. 320: Gen. 49:14; 30:11. 4 Num. 32:34-38. 5 Shokgn; whence the much-heralded Shekinah. 6 I Chron, 12:8-15. Such numerical statement of rank in the Orient approximates our lieutenant and captain. 7 The Masoretes point Hayil. The passage is one of those in which a fenced bamah must be meant. For an amusing illustration of the quibbling in the latest days of the na- tion as to what constituted a prohibited "image," see Josephus Ant. xv. viii. 1. 2. Herod celebrates his own victories by placing magnificent golden and silver simulacra trophies in the Holy City; and they were elegantly robed. A tremendous uproar arose. Herod played with the leading fanatics for a while; then removing the armor, masks, and robes, exposed plain wooden poles-no "graven" images! And the objectors acknowledged that the laugh was on them! So the Chronicler has no difficulty about lion-faced gibborim simulacra in the H~I of an earlier time. His hero Solomon has 300 "shields" of hammered gold (not "graven!") in the house of (the Baal) of the forest of Lebanon, I Kings 10:17; three minae to the "shield." It is fair to ask if these were not plaques, appudath, or "ephods," of vari- ous hero-baalim-such beaten plates as we have already noticed, and which Herod knew could not be objected to.</page><page sequence="12">264 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SEMITIC LANGUAGES For the Chronicler, the T0l referred to must have been the temple- inclosure at Jerusalem, connected with David's costly bamah there. But we can be certain that Ataroth or any other Gadite stronghold also had its h.l or bamah for the "Enlarger of Gad" and his lion- faced Gibborim. Fifth: In II Sam. 8:2 we have mention of a savage raid upon Moab by David. All local details are suppressed, but we have the story of ruthless slaughter by "odd or even" lottery. Drawing a number of lines upon the ground, and then erasing them, two at a time, to see whether one or two remain at the last, is a lottery still known in that region. There was "luck in odd numbers" for a Moabite then. And the above-cited fragments belong to the time of David; he is the "Enlarger of Gad" whose lion-plaque or colossus abides in the "chief land" as the residence or place of manifestation of his guardian spirit; giving forth omens favorable or unfavorable, as all other simulacra were expected to do. But his hideous massacres would leave a heritage of deathless hate among the survivors, and an ever nourished purpose to repay in kind when possible. And Mesha of Moab, "the Daibonite"-native of one of the towns plundered and held by Gad-tells us the sequel: And the men of Gad had dwelt in the land of Ataroth from olden time. And a King of Israel had built Ataroth for himself. And I made war on the city and took it. And I slew all the people of the city, as a spectacle' for Che- mosh and Moab. And I brought away from there the "spirit-lion" (Ariel) of Dawdo, and I dragged it before Chemosh in Kerioth. Thus David (Dodo) appears as the "Enlarger of Gad," the founder of the capital-fort of Ataroth, maker of Yahwist-covenants with Mo- abite chiefs, residing from olden time as a "Spirit Lion" or chief baal of the Gadite fort; and it is his ariel that Mesha triumphantly drags before Chemosh in Kerioth. The long guardianship of the lion-stele of the David-baal ends by his being added to the ghostly army of Che- mosh.2 But we must not overlook the famous seal of Shema, "servant of Jeroboam,"3 in which his personal insignia(?) shows us a vividly portrayed raging, striding lion. Shema may have been an Ariel him- 1 Reminding us of Roman gladiatorial massacres. 2 Mesha further destroys Nebo and drags from thence "Ariels of Yahweh (Yahwist Gibborim, steles or Yahweh-lions?) or "utensils of Yahweh"-the end of this line being broken, we may not be certain of the last three letters. See lions as the throne guards of Solomon (I Kings 10:20; II Chron. 9:19). There seems no reason to view these as dif- ferent from the guardian shedim of Babylonia or Phoenicia. 3 Lidzbarski, AS, title-page, and p. 11, K.</page><page sequence="13">ARIEL, OR DAVID-CULTUS 265 self in rank or in expectation; and we must recognize that the "Ariel of Dawdoh" may have been such striding lion-figure, instead of a lion- headed stele such as Babylonian art sometimes shows us. We may now recognize at a glance the significance of an attack that Isaiah makes upon the popular cultus of their warrior-king. David himself is the guardian El-Gibbor par excellence at many a camp or outpost. Because of his Saddik covenants with some chief- tains, and because of his Moabite ancestry and relationships,' his cul- tus has some Moabite popularity also, and the Moabite title Ari-el is a slogan that brings Hebrews and Moabites both to some of the annual cultus-festivals. The Hebrew text of Isaiah, chapter 29, is sadly dis- ordered by an explanatory gloss creeping into the text in verse 1, the exchange of terminal words at the end of two lines, and by the omission of the feasting with Moab, which is retained by the LXX. Recognizing the gloss, and accepting the LXX suggestion, the denun- ciation appears to be: 1. Woe to an ariel! There year by year assemble pilgrim-feasts! [Gloss: Ariel: any city where David campeth!] For Ye will eat, ye will eat with Moab! 2. But I will afflict ariel, and there shall be misery, there shall be moaning. 3. And I will encompass any ariel, and I will encamp against thee like David,2 And I will cast up a bank against thee, and erect forts against thee. 4. And thou shalt be brought low; from the earth shalt thou speak; And thy words be very low from the dust. And thy voice be like an 6b from the ground; and thy speech twitter from the dust, 5. And thy multitude of deceiver spirits shall be like small dust And like flying chaff the multitude of thy Terrible Ones! 6. And it shall be that in an instant thou shalt be visited of Yahweh of Hosts, With thunder and earthquake and a mighty noise; With storm and tempest and flame of a devouring fire. 7. And as a dream, a vision of the night, shall there be A multitude of all the nations, assembling in behalf of Ariel And [against] all her assailants, beleaguerers and oppressors. 8. But it shall be like the dream of a hungry man-and behold he eateth. And he awaketh, and empty is he! Or as a thirsty man dreameth, and lo he drinketh! And he awaketh and lo he is famished! and is terribly thirsty! Such shall be the multitude of all nations rallying in behalf of Mt. Zion!" 1 Ruth 4:17-22: I Sam. 22:3. 4. 2 So LXX: "DWD" instead of "DWR." It is the real retaliatory turn that Isaiah should take on those who pretend that David is coming to their aid with a mighty host.</page><page sequence="14">266 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SEMITIC LANGUAGES This scathing retort upon the charlatans who announce that David is coming to the aid of his people with a mighty spirit-host needs no comment. The superstitious populace was thus gulled times without number. Our immediate point is that here, three centuries after David's time, there are various cities where David is claimed to "camp"; each of these is distinguished by an Ari-el; a stele or cenotaph or relief of David is the natural inference. One of these military out- posts we have seen to be Ataroth in the southern border of Reuben. Since the "Enlarger of Gad" made a Yahwist treaty with the neigh- boring chiefs, he himself would be regarded as the baal of that treaty (Baal-berith), and would be a popular baal in some Moabite towns. David's Moabite antecedents would contribute to the same end, and Hebrews and Moabites feasting together at an Ariel1 shrine would be certain. But Mesha personally seems to have had no liking for the Dawdo cultus. Since Mesha names no ancestor of his own save his father, he may be the second representative of a dynastic and cultus revolution, repudiating Ariel, "Lion of Judah." 1 The lion sticks in Hebrew decoration: Ezek. 41:18, 19; 1:6, 10; 10:14. Danis a "lion," Deut. 39:22, and its earlier city-name, Laish (Judg. 18:7, 29), is "lion-city." See Yahweh as a "lion," Hos. 5:14; 11:10; 13:7-8; Amos. 1:2; 3:4, 8; Jer. 12:8; 25:30, 38; Joel 3:16; Isa. 3:14; suggesting plays on popular cultus: Solomon's Phoenician throne with fourteen guardian Lions, I Kings 10:19. The "Ariel" of Ezekiel's altar (Ezek. 43:15-16) must re- fer to its decorated sides or top, as with the lion-decorated Palestinian altar already cited as found by Professor Sellin at the Taanach of the Old Testament. Ezekiel thinks of "Lions of El"--lion-messengers of Yahweh; cf. his above-cited lion-cherubs, upholding the Mer- kabah-throne of Yahweh. The "David-lions" of Mesha's day are adopted, not eliminated. Feigin (JBL, XXX, 131 ff.) suggests that the Ariel of the altar may be connected with Bab. aralu =sheol; compares Aralim, "shades," in Isa. 33:7; hence the altar was original- ly a place of "offerings to the dead." This leaves no connection with "lion," and overlooks all the foregoing "warrior-lion" lore. W. F. Albright follows, p. 137 ff.: arallu =E.K UR. BAD. ="House of Mount of Dead." Ari-Ul is etymologically too unlike the Sumerian term. The lion folk-lore gives the simplest and most natural explanation of the Hebrew- Moabite word.</page></plain_text>
