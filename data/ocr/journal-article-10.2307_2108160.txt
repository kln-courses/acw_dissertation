<plain_text><page sequence="1">Philosophy and Phenomenological Research Vol. L, No. 3, March I990 Overtones of Solipsism in Thomas Nagel's "What is it Like to Be a Bat? " and The View From Nowhere KATHLEEN WIDER University of Michigan, Dearborn Thomas Nagel has been arguing for many years now that a physicalist account of consciousness can only provide an incomplete analysis of mind. It cannot, given the very nature of the account, capture the subjec- tive character of experience, i.e., what it is like to be a conscious creature, to have experience. According to Nagel, an objective physical account cannot exhaustively analyze subjectivity. What constantly eludes the stretch of the physical theory are the phenomenological features of experi- ence. The reason for this is "that every subjective phenomenon is essen- tially connected with a single point of view, and it seems inevitable that an objective, physical theory will abandon that point of view."' He has maintained this thesis, with some modifications, for two decades and con- tinues to argue in support of it despite constant criticism of both the thesis -and the positions he has developed in defense of it. He has been criticized for working with too simplistic a notion of consciousness, to which he attaches too much significance and about which he says too little.'

Norman Malcolm, Consciousness and OVERTONES OF SOLIPSISM IN NAGEL 48I</page><page sequence="2">addition commentators have criticized him for maintaining his subjective or introspective intuitions in the face of scientific evidence or theoretical considerations and arguments that conflict with them.3 The most wide- spread criticism from the physicalists has been that there is no good rea- son to suppose that a physicalist theory cannot provide an exhaustive analysis of mind either by accounting for the subjective character of experience4 or by showing that no such account is necessary.' These are only some of the criticisms brought against Nagel's position. There are of course other objections that have been raised against his view and more specific criticisms that fall under the broad ones I have men- tioned. I intend, however, to by-pass these more common objections to Nagel's view and focus instead on a problem which is alluded to here and there in the literature but of which there has been no real sustained discus- sion. This is the problem of what Anthony Kenny calls "an odd solipsistic strain"6 in Nagel. I want to explore this strain particularly as it manifests itself in two of Nagel's works: "What is it Like to be a Bat?" and The View From Nowhere. Nagel's concern that physicalist accounts of mind will fail to capture fully the nature of consciousness is reminiscent of the concerns about con- sciousness expressed in the early writings of both Ludwig Wittgenstein and Jean-Paul Sartre. Although both Sartre in Being and Nothingness and Wittgenstein in the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus deny the exis- tence of a transcendental ego, both agree that even if science could describe all there is in the world, there would still be something unac- counted for. What this something is is consciousness or subjectivity. For Wittgenstein in the Tractatus, you can describe the world completely, give all the propositions of natural science, state all the meaningful proposi- tions and still there is something left over. What is left over is the meta- physical self, life as consciousness, the fact that I occupy a point of view. Likewise for Sartre in Being and Nothingness, a completely objective and physicalist description of the world will never fully capture the nature of Causality with D. M. Armstrong (Oxford: Basil Balckwell, I984) makes a related criti- cism that Nagel fails to specify clearly enough what he means by 'the subjective character of an experience'.

It will never capture consciousness since for Sartre consciousness is nothingness. Each philosopher sees that solipsism threat- ens to follow as a consequence from his views and each one attempts to confront and overcome this threat.7 Although there are numerous impor- tant ways in which Nagel diverges from both Sartre and Wittgenstein, his similar concern with consciousness and the inability of science to account for its nature in any exhaustive sense brings with it the threat of solipsism. I will examine the arguments and positions in both "What is it Like to be a Bat?" and The View From Nowhere that I think give this solipsistic flavor to Nagel's position. My purpose in this paper is not to show how such a leaning toward solipsism can be avoided (or indeed even to show it should be avoided); my purpose is simply to show it is present in Nagel's work as a consequence of the claims he explicitly sets forth and that it needs both acknowledgement and defense. Nagel would not of course agree that there is a solipsistic strain in his work. He says in "What is it Like to be a Bat?" that "there is a sense in which phenomenological facts are perfectly objective: one person can know or say of another what the quality of the other's experience is" ("What," p. 172). He thinks there are mentalistic ideas that we apply without problem to ourselves and other humans ("What, " p. I 69, n. 5). In "Subjective and Objective" he claims that the subjective is in general intersubjectively available and that the subjective ideas of experience, actions, and the self are in some sense public (p. 2og). He talks at length in "What is it Like to be a Bat?" and in The View From Nowhere about our ability to enter imaginatively into the subjective viewpoint of others. In fact he argues in The View From Nowhere that it is precisely the view he opposes, the one that holds that a physicalist account can give an exhaus- tive analysis of mind, which leads to solipsism (VFN, p. zo). He develops a notion of mental objectivity which, although it too turns out like physical objectivity to give only an incomplete account of mind, does nonetheless allow us to at least form a conception of points of view which we cannot subjectively imagine. "We can have a concept of mind general enough to allow us to escape solipsism" (VFN, p. 2i). However, despite Nagel's stated rejection of solipsism, he never directly confronts or attempts to overcome what I will call 'epistemolog- ical solipsism', i.e., the view that the only experience I can know exists is 7 See my forthcoming paper "A Nothing About Which Something Can Be Said: Sartre and Wittgenstein on the Self," in Sartre Alive, ed. Ronald Aronson and Adrian van den Hoven (Detroit: Wayne State University Press, I989) for a comparative analysis of Sar- tre's and Wittgenstein's positions on consciousness and how they each understand and handle the problem of solipsism. OVERTONES OF SOLIPSISM IN NAGEL 483</page><page sequence="4">my own. Nagel simply assumes that others (including other non-human animals) have experience. He assumes that bats and roaches and spiders as well as other humans and perhaps extraterrestrial beings have an inner life of consciousness, i.e., there is something it is like for each of these organisms to be the organism it is and to have the experiences it has. He offers little defense for this view. At the beginning of his discussion of his famous bat example in "What is it Like to be a Bat?", he simply says "I assume we all believe that bats have experience. After all, they are mam- mals, and there is no more doubt that they have experience than that mice or pigeons or whales have experience" ("What," p. i68). Although he maintains that the subjective character of the experience of persons born blind and deaf would be inaccessible to those of us not so born, he sees this as no barrier to believing that there is a subjective character to their experience ("What," p. 170). While discussing, in The- View From Nowhere, the subjectively unimaginable mental lives of other species, Nagel claims that "we know there's something there, something perspec- tival, even if we don't know what it is or even how to think about it" (p. zi). So although there may be kinds of experience of which we can form little or no conception, it does not follow that we cannot believe such experience exists and has a subjective character. But he offers no justification for such a belief beyond simple intuitions. For Nagel, although I cannot conceive of, except in schematic form, what it is like to be a bat, for example, and so cannot know what it is like to be one ("What," p. 172, n. 8), I can still believe that it is like something. Nagel never directly addresses the question of the grounds upon which such a belief is justified. Am I justified in believing of others that they are con- scious and that their experience has a subjective character and, if so, is my justification strong enough to raise my belief to the level of knowledge? Nagel concerns himself not with this question but rather with the question of how we form the conceptions we have of the subjective character of others' experiences. "The interesting problem of other minds is not the epistemological problem, how I can know that other people are not zom- bies. It is the conceptual problem, how I can understand the attribution of mental states to others" (VFN, p. iv). Since Nagel's concern is not with establishing how we know that other creatures are conscious, but rather with explaining how we form a con- ception of their experience, I do not wish to rest my claim that there is a solipsistic strain in Nagel on his failure to address such epistemological questions. I will look instead at Nagel's account in "What is it Like to be a Bat?" and The View From Nowhere of how we form a conception of the 8 See Haksar, p. I 13 for a similar point. 484 KATHLEEN WIDER</page><page sequence="5">subjective character of another creature's experience and I will argue that it is precisely this discussion of how we form such conceptions that has solipsistic overtones. For Nagel there are subjective facts. These facts are "facts of experience facts about what it is like for the experiencing organism" ("What," p. 172.). They are accessible and fully comprehensible from only one point of view. These facts are "facts about what mental states are like for the crea- tures having them" ("Subjective," p. zoi). They embody a particular point of view. They are phenomenological facts, facts which are in one sense objective, i.e., "one person can know or say of another what the quality of the other's experience is" ("What," p. 172) but are in another sense subjective for Nagel, since I can ascribe experience to another only if the other is similar enough to me for me to be able to adopt her point of view, i.e., "to understand the ascription in the first person as well as in the third" ("What," p. 172). We grasp subjective facts about others, facts about what it is like for them to have the experiences they have, by enter- ing imaginatively into their point of view and by trying to see how things appear from their viewpoint ("Subjective," p. 2og). For Nagel, there are subjective conceptions as well as subjective facts.9 Indeed only a subjec- tive conception can fully capture what subjective facts are about for Nagel, if indeed any conception, subjective or objective, can do so com- pletely. The reason an objective conception cannot fully capture subjec- tive facts - facts about the phenomenological features of an experience - is that phenomenological features are connected to a single point of view and an objective conception will abandon that point of view ("What," p. i67). Subjective concepts are concepts that we learn in the first person and we can use them in the third person only if we can under- stand their use in the first person ("What," p. 172). For Nagel there are some subjective facts which are inconceivable to humans; they lie beyond the reach of our concepts, subjective and objec- tive. An example of such facts would be those that involve the specific sub- jective character of a bat's experience ("What," p. 17i). However, the problem of solipsism would not arise for Nagel simply from his belief in the existence of subjective facts that lie beyond the reach of human con- cepts. But a solipsistic strain would be present in his work if, as a conse- 9 See Colin McGinn's review of Nagel's The View From Nowhere, Mind 96 (1987): 264-65, for his criticism of Nagel's failure to disambiguate clearly the use of 'objective' and 'subjective' with regard to facts from its use with regard to concepts. This same ambi- guity is present in "What is it Like to be a Bat?" Peter Smith, "Subjectivity and Colour Vision," in The Aristotelian Society, supplementary vol. 6i (I987): 245-64; and A. W. Moore in his review of The View From Nowhere, Philosophical Quarterly 37 (I987): 3Z3-27, question the very existence of subjective facts. OVERTONES OF SOLIPSISM IN NAGEL 485</page><page sequence="6">quence of his stated views, it follows that the full comprehension of cer- tain subjective facts about other humans and the meaning of concepts which describe such facts is accessible only to the owner of the experience the facts are about. Nagel makes it clear in "What is it Like to be a Bat?" that when he describes subjective facts as facts that embody a particular point of view, he is not referring to a point of view accessible to only a single individual but rather to a type of viewpoint. So he claims I can take up a point of view other than my own and so I can comprehend subjective facts about experi- ence other than my own (p. 171). When he discusses subjective concepts, he claims that "even our most subjective phenomenological concepts are public in a sense" ("Subjective," p. 207). He agrees with Wittgenstein about the publicity of rules and so of concepts, even subjective concepts. However, subjective concepts are public in a different way than objective concepts (concepts used to describe the physical world). What underlies the publicity of objective concepts is different from what underlies the publicity of subjective concepts. For Nagel the publicity of objective con- cepts is connected with our ability to coordinate the points of view of dif- ferent individuals toward objects in the world. This is not the case with our use of subjective concepts since they are not about objects (they do not apply to objects). Sensations, Nagel holds in line with Wittgenstein, are not objects. A sensation is not the appearance of an object but is simply an appearance and as such it must be an appearance to someone; it is that which makes it subjective. This does not, however, make it private. I do not claim to fully understand what Nagel is after here; his remarks are tantalizingly brief on this point. But what seems to follow is that what underlies the public nature of our use of subjective concepts is not the coordination of the points of view of several individuals toward the same object but toward similar appearances. Nagel says that sensations are "publicly comparable and not private" ("Subjective," p. 207). What this means for Nagel, I think, is that I can adopt another's point of view (if it is enough like my own) and so I can imagine having an experience similar to theirs. This is the basis for my comprehension and use of subjective con- cepts as they apply to others. I maintain that despite these remarks there remains on Nagel's view facts about the subjective character of another human's experience, even another human very much like me, that are inaccessible to me. I will argue that given Nagel's use of the imagination in grounding our conception of how an experience is for another and given his view of the relationship between the mental and the physical, it follows that the true nature of an experience is fully comprehensible only to the experiencer herself. I think 486 KATHLEEN WIDER</page><page sequence="7">this comes out when we look at why we cannot conceive of the subjective character of a bat's experience except in a very schematic fashion. Nagel argues that what is required for me to be able to comprehend the phenom- enological features of another creature's experience is that I be able to take up or enter imaginatively into the point of view of the other. In the case of a bat, I am unable to meet this requirement because the perceptual apparatus of a bat is so different from my own. When I try to imagine hav- ing a bat's experience, I find failure. If I try to imagine having webbing on my arms, hanging upside down by day, and so on, I end up imagining (and not very successfully at that) only myself behaving as a bat behaves rather than imagining what it is like for a bat to be a bat. If I try instead to imag- ine having "the internal neuro-physiological constitution of a bat" ("What," p. i69), I fail as well since I cannot really attach any meaning to my possessing such a constitution. Even if I could be gradually "transformed into a bat nothing in my present constitution enables me to imagine what the experiences of such a future stage of myself thus meta- morphosed would be like" ("What," p. i69). At best we can only form a schematic conception of what it is like for a bat to be a bat because we nei- ther share the type of viewpoint a bat has nor can we imagine adopting that point of view. The reason for this failure seems to be, for Nagel, that a bat's neuro-physiological structure and hence way of perceiving the world is just too distant from our own. Any attempt to imagine having such a constitution will turn out to be impossible or simply incoherent. But is this the case when it comes to my attempting to adopt the point of view of another creature of my own species? Nagel often implies that types of viewpoint are species-specific, (for example, "What," pp. i69 and 175). Although Nagel is not sure about whether our imagination can take us beyond our species' viewpoint, surely it can allow us to adopt the viewpoint of other humans. But not other humans born blind and deaf. Nagel claims that the subjective character of their experience is inaccessi- ble to those not so born. His reason for holding this would seem to be, given his discussion of bat experience, that those humans' neuro-physio- logical constitution and hence perceptual experience would be different enough from sighted and hearing humans that individuals in neither group could imagine what it would be like to be a person in the opposite group. Why not? Presumably because if I try to imagine what it is like to have been born both blind and deaf, I will only end up imagining myself (a person not so born) relying on my sense of touch more than I do now, "hearing" silence, "seeing" darkness, and so on. But I will fail to imagine what it is like for the person who is born blind and deaf to be the person she is and have the experiences she has. As Sue M. Halpern remarks in her OVERTONES OF SOLIPSISM IN NAGEL 487</page><page sequence="8">review of Under the Eye of the Clock, a novel by Christopher Nolan, a severely disabled person, "empathy for the disabled is unavailable to most able-bodied persons ... for every attempt to project oneself into that con- dition, to feel what it is like not to be ambulatory, for instance, is mediated by the ability to walk."'0 This same situation appears to hold between hearing and non-hearing people. In a very moving review of the i98 8 stu- dent uprising at Gallaudet College, a college for the deaf, Oliver Sacks claims that the differences between the community and culture of the hearing and that of the deaf consist not just in different modes of commu- nication but in different modes of sensibility and being. He notes that neu- roscientists have begun to study neurological differences between the deaf and the hearing and they have found that the brain of a person who is deaf from birth and exposed early on to American Sign Language actually alters to adapt itself to a supervisual rather than a visual/auditory world." But why can't we imagine having a different neuro-physiological con- stitution and so having different kinds of experiences? To get clearer on what Nagel is after in both the bat case and the case of persons born blind and deaf, I would like to review Bernard Williams' discussion of imagin- ing in "Imagination and the Self." Williams points out two ways of con- struing the formula "imagining myself being Napoleon." One can con- strue it to mean something like playing the role of Napoleon or pretending to be Napoleon in the way Charles Boyer might play the role of Napoleon in a film. This construal of the formula makes sense. I have "images of, for instance, the desolation at Austerlitz as viewed by me vaguely aware of my short stature and my cockaded hat, my hand in my tunic."' This kind of imagining, although it is about myself, involves the elimination of my actual characteristics. It is, Williams says, what I do when I imagine being someone else.'3 There is, however, another way of construing the mean- ing of the formula "imagining myself being Napoleon" and this second way involves one in self-contradiction. Here I try to imagine myself just as I am being Napoleon. I try to imagine actually being or having been Napo- leon. But my being or having been Napoleon is logically impossible (or at least the notion is incoherent) and so I cannot imagine it. " Sue M. Halpern, "Portrait of the Artist," New York Review of Books, June 30, 1988, P. 3. " Oliver Sacks, "The Revolution of the Deaf," New York Review of Books, June 2, i988, P. 23.

'3 Ibid., p. 40. 488 KATHLEEN WIDER</page><page sequence="9">These two senses of imagining myself being another seem to be at play in Nagel's bat example. If I construe the formula the first way, then I try to imagine playing the role of a bat: having webbed arms, hanging upside down, etc. But since a bat is so unlike me, I do not have much luck with this imaginative task and I fail to imagine what it it like for a bat to be a bat. So I construe the formula in the second way and try to imagine myself actually being a bat; I try to imagine my switiching species. This imagina- tive task is impossible. Nagel concludes that since I cannot imagine being a bat on either reading of the formula "imagine being someone else," I cannot comprehend the subjective character of a bat's experience. What about when I try to imagine being another human with similar sensory modalities rather than trying to imagine being a member of another species? I should certainly have more luck here imagining myself being another (human) person. Although I would not have much luck pre- tending to be a bat or imagining myself playing the role of a bat in a film, I certainly could imagine being Eleanor Roosevelt for instance or playing the role of ER in a film. But although I can get much further in imagining being ER than in imagining being a bat, will that be enough to allow me to comprehend what it was like for ER to be ER? I think not. The same prob- lem that arose in the bat case will arise here although less pronounced. Does imagining being ER or playing the role of Napoleon allow me to comprehend how it felt for ER to be, for example, a woman in America in the 1930S and 1940S with power but always power subsidiary to the power of the men around her? No matter how much I know about Napo- leon, will my fantasies, my pretending to be Napoleon, ever allow me access to a full understanding of how it was for Napoleon to flee Corsica or lose at Waterloo? Even though we can go much further imaginatively in cases of beings more like ourselves (as a woman I can more easily imagine being ER than Napoleon and as a human I can likewise more easily imag- ine being Napoleon than a bat), still I think it will always turn out that I am imagining myself being the other just as in the bat case I succeed only in imagining myself behaving as a bat. Certainly I eliminate, as Williams notes, my actual characteristics in these imaginings but I cannot eliminate myself altogether as he also notes or I would no longer be imagining being Napoleon.'4 For Nagel what is required to fully comprehend the subjec- tive character of another creature's experience, what it is like for that crea- ture to be the creature it is, is that I be able to imagine being the other, that I be able to enter imaginatively into their viewpoint. On either construal of the meaning of the formula "imagine being someone else," we seem unable to ever satisfy this requirement. Fulfilling the formula given its first 14 Ibid., p. 43. OVERTONES OF SOLIPSISM IN NAGEL 489</page><page sequence="10">meaning is inadequate as a means of my comprehending, fully at least, what it is like for another to be the person she is and have the experiences she has. The second construal of the meaning of the formula is incoherent and so I cannot fulfill it.'5 Nagel would respond I think by pointing out that the reason we fail in the imaginative task in the case of bats and those born blind and deaf is that we do not share their neuro-physiological constitution and so we do not share their type of viewpoint but with most other humans this is not so. He says in "What is it Like to be a Bat?" that the more similar another is to me, the more easily I can adopt the other's point of view and so under- stand ascriptions of experience to the other (p. 17z). Since we are neuro- logically and physiologically like most other humans, we can imagine tak- ing up their viewpoint. But even if I am wrong in my claim that taking up their viewpoint by imagining myself being them or having their experi- ences will never allow me to fully comprehend what it is really like for another person to be the person she is, I think there are other problems with Nagel's position here. Do most humans share a similar neuro-phys- iological constitution in the sense needed to claim similarity of phenome- nological features of experience? At least one new and still controversial theory of the brain, Neural Darwinism, advanced by Gerald Edelman, director of the Neurosciences Institute at Rockefeller University, claims that the structure of the brain is not predetermined by an individual's genetic code; rather a person's experiences continually shape and alter the person's brain. According to this theory, the way in which an organism interacts with its environment affects and indeed creates the functional anatomy of the brain and hence affects the way the organism orders the world."6 In addition, there is still controversy among physiologists over the effect of male and female hormones on brain development and other neuro-physiological features of an individual that may affect how the per- son experiences the world. Even given the abundant evidence that most humans have similar neu- ro-physiological processes occurring within them when, for instance, they see, it would not follow given Nagel's view of the relation between the physical and the mental that similar kinds of phenomenological features attach to everyone's seeing. Nagel has always argued against psychophys- ical reductionism, although he does maintain that there are connections between the mental and the physical. For Nagel mental and physical prop- erties or processes are properties or processes of the same organism. Is I am grateful to comments made by participants at an NEH summer seminar at Cornell in I985 with regard to my ideas on Nagel's use of the imagination. i6 Gerald M. Edelman, Neural Darwinism (New York: Basic Books, i987). 490 KATHLEEN WIDER</page><page sequence="11">Indeed in his discussion of the dual aspect theory in The View From Nowhere, he leans toward the view that one's mental life depends on the states and activities of the brain, i.e., the brain may well be "both the bearer of mental states and the cause of their continuity when there is con- tinuity" (VFN, p. 40). The brain may provide the objective completion of the concept of self. However, Nagel treats this possibility as an empirical hypothesis for which there is at present insufficient evidence to establish its truth. He does, however, think this thesis is plausible. Yet he does not see psychophysical reductionism following from the truth of such a thesis. Rather if it turns out that mental states are dependent on brain states and if some form of the dual aspect theory is correct, then Nagel would argue that there must be brain states that are non-physical.'7 Nagel also admits, in The View From Nowhere, the possibility of nec- essary connections holding between the mental and the physical and yet that alone he argues is insufficient to allow an inference from the presence of certain physical processes to the presence of certain mental processes. The failure of such inferences is due to the fact that the mental and the physical may both be aspects of something more fundamental and so both the mental and the physical might be entailed by this more fundamental something and yet not entail each other. Even if it turns out that there is a necessary identity between mental and physical processes, as it would just in case the fundamental something which is the basis of the mental also has certain physical properties, still this possibility of necessary connec- tion does not allow us now, given our present knowledge, to draw any inferences from the presence of certain physical processes to the presence of certain mental processes (VFN, p. 48). Without a knowledge that there exists something more fundamental than either the mental or the physical and without a clear understanding of the nature of this fundamental something if it does exist, there is no way for us to know its connection with the mental or the physical and hence no way to know the connection, if any, between the mental and the physical themselves. Consequently we cannot, at present at least, infer from the presence of a physiologically described brain state the presence of phenemenological pain (VFN, p. 48). "No description or analysis of the objective nervous system, however complete, will ever by itself imply anything which is not objective, i.e., which can be understood only from one kind of viewpoint.. . . One can- not derive a pour soi from an en soi" ("Panpsychism," p. i88).18 That is, 17 Nagel, VFN, p. 41. See McGinn, pp. 265-67 for problems with Nagel's discussion of a dual aspect theory and his denial of psychophysical reductionism. I8 At certain points Nagel does seem to appeal to the behavior of other animals as evidence that they have a conscious inner life (VFN, p. 23). In his very vivid and rather moving description in The View From Nowhere of the spider caught in a urinal, his evidence (or OVERTONES OF SOLIPSISM IN NAGEL 491</page><page sequence="12">even if what it is like for a human to see is objectively similar for all of us, it would not necessarily be the case that seeing would be similar for all of us subjectively: that what it is like for me to see is similar to what it is like for another. [I am not claiming it is not similar but that Nagel has no grounds for the belief that it is given his other views.] So although I can attempt to imagine seeing as another sees, there is no guarantee that the imagining succeeds in properly grounding my concep- tion of what it is like for another as a subject to see unless I know that simi- larity of neuro-physiological constitution or activity insures similarity of phenomenological features of experience." Nagel claims in "What is it Like to be a Bat?" that "at present we are completely unequipped to think about the subjective character of experience without relying on the imagi- nation" (p. 178) and yet it seems that the reliability of this method is undermined by Nagel's position on the relation between the physical and the mental. " at least a reason) for his belief that the spider has desires and fears, indeed a whole range of conscious experience, appears to be behavioral. He also refers those who are skeptical about the existence of conscious experience in creatures quite distant from us in structure and behavior to an early twentieth century work by H. S. Jennings entitled The Behav- ior of the Lower Organisms (New York: Columbia University Press, I906). For Jen- nings subjective states are directly accessible only to their owners and so the only way to infer the existence of such states in others (including other humans) is by analogy with one's own case. Since the lower organisms he studies behave in some ways analogous to the ways humans behave and since in my case such behavior is accompanied by states of consciousness, I may infer that such behavior in other animals is also accompanied by such states. But such inferences are ultimately undermined for Jennings as they are for Nagel because nothing in the objective evidence bars the possibility that such behavior could occur unaccompanied by states of consciousness. See especially pp. 3 28-37 for Jen- nings' discussion of consciousness in lower organisms and VFN, p. 23, for Nagel's refer- ence to Jennings. '9 See Muscari for a good discussion of Nagel's predicament "caught precariously between his phenomenological and naturalistic ambitions. He is loathe to separate organic pro- cess from the organism's feeling of it in fear of endangering the subject by separating con- sciousness from body; yet at the same time he wants an explanation of what it is like to be an incarnate being without seeing things in terms of neurophysiology or behavior" (p. z8). Muscari traces the consequences of this predicament for Nagel's moral theory. I am interested in its consequences for his theory of mind. Nagel distinguishes perceptual from sympathetic imagination in "What is it Like to be a Bat?" pp. 175-76, n. ii and argues that-it is sympathetic imagination that is needed in forming a conception of the subjective features of another's experience. To imagine something sympathetically we are to put ourselves into a conscious state resembling the thing itself. Nagel tells us we can use this kind of imagination only to imagine mental states and events - our own or another's. So to sympathetically imagine the occurrence of a mental state, we put ourselves into a state that resembles it. But does this notion of sympathetic imagination clarify how we form a conception of the subjective features of experience? Take for an example an occurrence of pain - my own or another's. Let me 492 KATHLEEN WIDER</page><page sequence="13">In The View from Nowhere, however, he offers a different way to escape solipsism by introducing a notion of mental objectivity - a notion he only mentioned at the end of "What is it Like to be a Bat?" Mental objectivity offers us, given Nagel's account of it, a way of conceiving of points of view that is not dependent on the imagination. It is a way of con- ceiving of our own and others' viewpoints from the outside, but in mental not physical terms. Mental objectivity requires that we find ways to con- ceive of types of experience that do not depend on our being able to have those kinds of experience or imagine them subjectively (VFN, p. 25). Nagel offers us a way to form a conception of the experience of others, even members of other species, that does not rely on the imagination and so appears to avoid the problems I raised against his use of the imagina- tion in the grounding of such conceptions in "What is it Like to be a Bat?" In the end, however, his use of mental objectivity fails as a way to avoid solipsism. Despite his earlier characterization of mental objectivity, imag- ination does come into play at least in the first stages of objectifying the mental. To develop an objective concept of the mind, we must first grasp the idea of all human perspectives and to do this requires us to use "a gen- eral idea of subjective points of view, of which we imagine a particular instance and a particular form" (VFN, pp. zo-zi). However, Nagel claims we can go beyond the use of imagination in developing objective concepts that apply to the mental life of creatures very different from our- selves. But in the end imagination is still required to understand all the qualities of the experience of another. According to Nagel, no objective conception of the mind will ever be complete because its completion requires that we be able to imagine subjectively all points of view and that is impossible. "The exact character of each of the experiential and inten- tional perspectives with which it [an objective conception of the mind] deals can be understood only from within and by subjective imagination" (VFN, p. z6). It is his insistence on maintaining this reliance on the imagi- nation together with his position on the relationship between the mental and the physical that accounts for the solipsistic strain in Nagel's work. Perhaps Williams' warning "that at least with regard to the self, the imagi- imagine what the pain would be like if the knife which just now cut my finger had embed- ded itself in my bone instead. To do this, I must put myself into a mental state of pain that resembles the actual mental state of pain I would be in if the knife had cut more deeply. But what is this notion of one mental state resembling another? If I have never had the actual mental state created by a knife digging into my bone, how do I know that the one I have now put myself into resembles it? To sympathetically imagine another's pain, I do the same as in my own case, but here there are even more problems with knowing whether the mental state I have put myself into resembles the mental state of the other. These problems are accentuated by Nagel's position on the relationship between the mental and the physical.

There remains, given Nagel's analysis of how we form a conception of the subjective qualities of another's experience, a comprehension of one's own experience that is accessible to oneself alone. There remains a form of self-knowledge or self-understanding at least which is private. And this privacy is in the strong sense, the sense used by Wittgenstein in his argu- ment against the possibility of a private language for sensations - private in the sense that the full comprehension of certain subjective facts and the meaning of concepts which describe them is accessible only to the owner of the experience the facts are about or to which the concepts apply."3 Nagel suggests this consequence of his views when he remarks that "even for other persons the understanding of what it is like to be them is only partial" ("What," p. 172, n. 8). Nagel misses the radical nature of Witt- genstein's point in the private language argument that ascriptions of men- tal states to oneself, i.e., first person ascriptions, make sense only if they can make sense in the third person. It is only if others can understand my ascriptions of a sensation to myself that I can understand it as well. The use of concepts that apply to states of consciousness in the first person are dependent on the possibility that they could have a use in the third person. Nagel's position in "What is it Like to be a Bat?" is the reverse. Their use in the third person is dependent on their use in the first. The "objective ascription of experience is possible only for someone sufficiently similar to the object of ascription to be able to adopt his point of view - to under- stand the ascription in the first person as well as in the third" ("What," p. 17z). It is precisely this Cartesian view that the third person ascription of experience is dependent on the first person use that Wittgenstein thought led to solipsism and that he argued against in The Philosophical Investi- gations.14 " Williams, p. 45- " See Russow, p. 6o for an argument against Nagel's assumption that imaginability is a reliable indication of understanding. 23 Nagel's position is reminiscent of John Wisdom's view in Other Minds (Oxford, Eng- land: Basil Blackwell, I965) that although I can know another's mental states, I can never know them in the way I know my own and that ascriptions of mental states to myself will always mean more to me than to others. Both are drawn to a Wittgensteinian position but both ultimately take positions that are inconsistent with Wittgenstein's view about the meaning of mentalistic concepts. 24 Wilkes, p. 24o raises the point that Nagel's position stands in opposition to Wittgen- stein's private language argument and that Nagel offers no arguments against Wittgen- stein's argument. My claim is that he does not even see that his position runs counter to 494 KATHLEEN WIDER</page><page sequence="15">It is true that in Nagel's discussion of solipsism in The Possibility of Altruism, he takes a very Wittgensteinian stand in holding that first and third person statements share a common meaning. He claims that the sys- tem of objective reasons upon which altruism depends requires that one be able to conceive of oneself as a particular person among other persons and that this requires that one have a particular conception of persons. This conception must make it "possible to say of other persons anything which one can say of oneself, and in the same sense" (p. ioi). He main- tains that first and third person ascriptions of mental states share a com- mon element, and although there may be differences between first and third person statements in terms of their implications or the expectations they arouse, these differences can all be accounted for in a public way, i.e., from the impersonal standpoint. Nothing about the meaning of the attri- butions of states of consciousness, whether made in the first or third per- son, is private in any strong sense. The only personal element that cannot be grasped by the impersonal standpoint is the personal premise "which locates me in the world that has been impersonally described" (p. 103). But although this premise makes a difference in how the world is con- ceived, it makes no difference in the content of what is conceived. Solip- sism is thus avoided for Nagel in non-practical areas since "everything which can be stated, asserted, expected, believed, judged from a personal standpoint can be similarly viewed from the impersonal standpoint" (p. 114). There are indications, however, in both the 1978 postscript to The Possibility of Altruism and in The View From Nowhere that Nagel has abandoned his strong claim that all the content of a first person judgment can and must be captured in a third person judgment. Although he talks in terms of practical judgments in the postscript, he does imply that in gen- eral the personal does not need to be completely subsumed under the impersonal. "The personal standpoint may retain its power after the claims of the impersonal have been acknowledged" (p. viii) and thus Nagel says some degree of dissociation (Nagel's terms for selective solip- sism) may remain. The personal premise "I am TN" which Nagel claimed in The Possibility of Altruism affected only how the world was conceived but left untouched what was conceived, plays a much more significant role in The View From Nowhere. He rejects the semantic diagnosis of "I am TN" which claims it states no further truth about the world. Nagel argues that the personal premise does state a fact and that even when an objective conception has provided all the public information about TN, Wittgenstein's. See Lawrence Nemirow's "Review of Thomas Nagel's Mortal Ques- tions," The Philosophical Review 89 (I980): 473-77 (p. 476 especially) and Moore, pp. 3z5-z6. OVERTONES OF SOLIPSISM IN NAGEL 495</page><page sequence="16">"the additional thought that TN is me seems clearly to have further con- tent" (VFN, p. 6o). Although Nagel acknowledges Wittgenstein's point about the objec- tive nature of subjectivity in The View From Nowhere (pp. 32 and 35, for example), he misses the anti-Cartesianism of Wittgenstein's position by relying ultimately on the imagination in grounding objectivity. Nagel says that if one could understand how subjective experience can have an objective nature, one would understand the existence of subjects other than oneself. But Wittgenstein goes further. The objective nature of sub- jectivity grounds not just one's understanding of the existence of other subjects but it grounds one's ability to talk about oneself as a subject of experience as well. In The View From Nowhere Nagel does point out that the concept 'someone' is not a generalization of the concept 'I' and that neither can exist without the other (p. 3 5) and he does appear to agree with the Wittgensteinian position that first and third person ascriptions of mental states share the same meaning. In addition he develops a notion of mental objectivity which allows us to view mental life, one's own or another's, from outside and so allows for a conception of mind that can be grasped by more than oneself and by more than members of one's species. That is why Nagel sees mental objectivity as a way to overcome solipsism and anthropomorphism. He rejects as well the argument from analogy as inadequate to explain our knowledge of other minds and as unable to avoid solipsism because it implies that the attributions of mental states in the first and third person do not have the same sense (VFN, p. zo). How- ever, because he sees mental objectivity as incomplete, because he argues an objective conception of subjectivity can only go so far and because his development of a subjective conception of mind relies ultimately on the use of the imagination, a solipsistic strain remains in Nagel's work. For Nagel the extent of one's understanding or conception of what it is like to be another is dependent on the extent to which one can take up the other's point of view. "If one can take it up roughly, or partially, then one's con- ception will also be rough or partial" ("What," p. 172, n. 8). Given Nagel's general position with regard to the relationship between the men- tal and the physical and given his reliance on imagination in forming a full conception of what it is like for another creature to be the creature it is and have the experiences it has, it follows that our understanding or concep- tion of what it is like to be another human will always be partial. Despite his apparent acceptance of Wittgenstein's position with regard to the objective nature of subjectivity, there remains, given Nagel's account, a kind of private knowledge or access to private subjective facts, an access available only to the owner of the experience to whom the facts apply. 496 KATHLEEN WIDER</page><page sequence="17">This flies in the face of Wittgenstein's private language argument and the anti-Cartesianism it embodies. There is another notion Nagel relies on extensively in The View From Nowhere - that of the objective self - which appears to be a possible source of the solipsistic strain in his work. Indeed Anthony Kenny in his review of the book thinks this is the source of such a strain in Nagel. He reads Nagel as positing a self separate from his ordinary, empirical self and one that cannot be known or encountered by others."5 Nagel himself recognizes that to insist on the existence of two separate, non-identical selves is to hover on the edge of solipsism. But the real problem with Nagel's reliance on this notion of an objective self is not so much that it can lead to solipsism - he sees that danger although he is not always as careful as he ought to be in avoiding it- the real problem is that a belief in such a self results in an isolation not between oneself and another but in an isolation from a part of one's own self. Nagel's reliance on this notion of an objective self leads him to the acceptance of a quasi-Kantian noumenal self, ultimately unknowable not just to others but to oneself as well. Nagel discusses the objective self at length in chapter four of The View From Nowhere.26 The objective self is "the perspectiveless subject that constructs a centerless conception of the world by casting all perspectives into the content of that world" (VFN, p. 6z). It is the true self or the higher self which has no point of view but which includes the point of view of the ordinary, empirical self (TN in Nagel's case) within its conception of the world. It is the 'I' that steps back from an individual and even human viewpoint. It is the existence of this objective self which gives rise to the two questions Nagel focuses on in this chapter: 'How can TN be me?' and 'How can I be TN?' Each person can ask these same questions of herself. The amazing fact which the thought 'TN is me' expresses for Nagel seems to be that a person in the world (TN) can have an objective view of the world. It is the fact that TN is capable of drawing back from his particular perspective as an ordinary, empirical self and forming a perspectiveless conception of the world. It is the same human capacity for objectivity and distance which struck Heidegger and Sartre, among others, as amazing. How can something in the world have a point of view on the world? Nagel's amazement goes further than this though because he is struck not just by the fact that an empirical self (one situated in space and time, in his- tory) can take an objective view on the world but also by the fact 2 Kenny, p. 14. z6 He repeats, for the most part, material from "The Objective Self," in Knowledge and Mind: Philosophical Essays, ed. Carl Ginet and Sydney Shoemaker (New York: Oxford University Press, I983), pp. z][11-3z. OVERTONES OF SOLIPSISM IN NAGEL 497</page><page sequence="18">expressed in the thought 'I am TN' that the subject of such an objective view can be a person in the world."7 Nagel does speak at times in this chapter as well as in the chapters that follow, especially in the final one, as though the objective self is a separate self from the ordinary, empirical self. "The objective self functions independently enough to have a life of its own. It engages in various forms of detachment from and opposition to the rest of us, and is capable of autonomous development" (VFN, p. 65). But he warns us at the end of chapter four that although he will sometimes speak of the objective self as a distinct part of the mind that such talk should not be given a metaphysical interpretation. Although Nagel gives no real justification for talking of two selves rather than of the capacity of the ordinary self to see the world from two perspectives, objective and subjective, and although he frequently and irresponsibly falls into talking of the two selves as though they were distinct, he does recognize that an adherence to a belief in two distinct selves can lead to solipsism (VFN, pp. zIz-13). Although he acknowledges the similarities between his idea of an objective self on the one hand and Husserl's transcendental ego and Wittgenstein's metaphysical self on the other (VFN, p. 6z, n. 3), he contin- ues to reject the solipsism that belief in such selves can drag in its wake and he rejects it by affirming, at least some of the time, that the objective self is simply an aspect or faculty of an ordinary person, a part of that person's point of view on the world. So although Nagel comes dangerously close to the solipsistic tendency he repudiates, he is cognizant of this danger. What Nagel does not avoid and indeed acknowledges and embraces is an epistemic isolation from oneself that the objective self brings with it. Just as human knowledge of the world and reality will always be limited and incomplete on Nagel's view, so too will our knowledge of the objec- tive self. "Some knower must remain behind the lens if anything is to be known" (VFN, p. I 27). Although one's objective conception of the world can continually be enlarged, it will never include the subject whose con- ception it is. While one can acknowledge the existence of such a subject, knowledge of that subject remains, in principle for non-omniscient beings, an impossibility. There remains in Nagel, despite his rejection of Kantianism, a belief in a modified version of Kant's noumenal self. We cannot, in Nagel's words, traverse the path of self-knowledge in its entirety (VFN, p. i z8). A part of one's self remains ultimately inaccessible not just to others but to oneself as well. 27 There are those who fail to feel the intuitive amazement Nagel does over these 'facts.' See McGinn, pp. 267-68 and Moore, pp. 324-25. 498 KATHLEEN WIDER</page><page sequence="19">It turns out that Nagel acknowledges the most obvious source of the solipsistic tendency in his work - his use of the notion of an objective self. However, the real source of the solipsistic strain in Nagel lies in a more hidden place, one he fails to acknowledge. It lies in his ultimate reliance on the imagination to ground one's conception of the subjective features of another's experience conjoined with his rejection of psychophysical reductionism.
