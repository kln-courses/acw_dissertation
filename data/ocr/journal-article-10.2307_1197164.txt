<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE BIBLE IN THE ANCIENT CHURCH ROBERT M. GRANT* IN THE ancient church theology was generally regarded as the clarifica- tion and exposition of the word of God contained in scripture, in the light of the growth and experience of the church. The central theologians of an- cient Catholicism viewed their task as theological rather than philosophical. For this reason the fundamental prob- lems of theological method concerned the nature of exegesis and the interpretation of scripture. God's revelation recorded in scripture was both final and complete. Nevertheless, the foolishness of God was constantly being assailed by the wisdom of men in its pretense of being wiser than he. Under this attack, and under the in- fluence of their own philosophical train- ing, some Christians rationalized the difficulties of scripture through allegori- cal interpretation. Others in simpler faith insisted on the literal meaning of the word. It might be said that the alle- gorists took history as mythology and that the literalists took mythology (in the theological sense of the word) as his- tory. There was a third group, however, consisting of theologians of the church who revered tradition, which produced a * Dr. Grant teaches New Testament in the Uni- versity of the South, Sewanee, Tennessee, and is assistant to the dean.

This principle is worked out most clearly and deeply by Augustine in the first three books of his De doctrina Christiana. I One of my theology teachers once said to me, "Do not despise the foi du charbonnier." It is this simple faith which is reflected in the literalistic method of interpretation. Literalism was natural for those who came out of Judaism into Christianity. It had been the method of Jesus himself,' as well as, in most in- stances, of Paul.2 It was generally the method of rabbinical interpreters.3 And in the early church insistence on literal- ism was often called "Judaizing" by pro- ponents of other methods.4 Papias of Hierapolis, early in the second century, provides us with an excellent example of such interpretations.5 His Exegesis of the Dominical Oracles includes vividly ma- terialistic descriptions of the miraculous phenomena of the age to come.6 Papias' See B.

Similarly the principal center of literalistic exegesis in the later church was Antioch, where there was a large and influential Jewish colony.7 Not all literalists were close to Judaism, however; Marcion of Pontus8 insisted on a literal interpretation of the Old Testament in order to discredit it, as well as the Gospel of Matthew, which uses it.9 But the majority of literalists, then as now, were ordinary believers without a taste for theology. Clement and Origen had difficulties with them at Alexandria.10 Their simplicity was especially evident at two points. In the first place, they in- terpreted literally the anthropomorphic descriptions of God in the Old Testa- ment. They believed that God was corporeal;" in opposition to Stoic en- lightenment1" they held that his bodily form was like ours. OrigenI3 is horrified by their views: they think such things of God as they would not think of the most savage and unjust man. Relying on bib- lical teaching, they upheld the view that God is capable of wrath,I4 a concept re- jected by every philosophical school.'5 7 C. H.

In the second place, they took literally the promises of the Apocalypse of John and believed that in the millennium pleasures of the flesh would be bestowed upon Christians. Such a belief was very common in the ancient church.'6 Even Augustine, in the period soon after his conversion, accepted it in part.I7 Natural- ly certain theological values were pre- served by literalists which were likely to be lost by other interpreters; but, as we shall see, the less rigid exegesis of the church and its theologians preserved them as well. II Among Christians who had been edu- cated in Greek schools and found it diffi- cult to reconcile even elementary philos- ophy with Christian faith, the allegorical method was largely in use. The method was not new. As early as the sixth cen- tury B.C. Homer's descriptions of the im- moralities of the gods had proved un- palatable; Theagenes of Rhegium'8 wrote an "apology" for Homeric poetry, in which allegorization removed the diffi- culties. By the time of Plato all Homer was allegorized, and from his ideal state he rejects it, allegory and all. "These tales must not be admitted into our state, whether they are supposed to have an allegorical meaning or not. For a young person cannot judge what is allegorical and what is literal; anything that he re- ceives into his mind at that age is likely to become indelible and unalterable; and therefore it is most important that the tales which the young first hear should be models of virtuous thoughts."'9 I6 L.

I9I</page><page sequence="3">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION Among the Stoics the allegorical meth- od was systemitized. As Dio of Prusa20 points out, Zeno took his principle of in- terpretation from Antisthenes: "Homer says some things according to opinion, others according to truth." But Anti- sthenes was apparently content to state the principle; Zeno actually worked through the Iliad and Odyssey, reconcil- ing apparent contradictions, and inter- preting the gods as powers of nature. His successor Cleanthes also was an alle- gorist.2I But the greatest systematizer of the early Stoa, Chrysippus,22 was the philos- opher of the allegorical interpretation. Without his work it could not have achieved its later influence, for he based it solidly on two general principles, on both of which he wrote books. The first, and more general, is the principle of ambiguity. Chrysippus wrote nineteen books on ambiguities. In writings, he says, similar matters are expressed in dis- similar words and dissimilar matters are expressed in similar words. Moreover, every word is ambiguous; two or more meanings can be found in the same word.23 The logical conclusion to be drawn from this principle is that, when something irrational or unsuitable is, or rather seems to be, expressed by an au- thor, you have misunderstood his mean- ing. And since an axiom of Stoic thought is that God is not anthropomorphic, a writer who portrays the gods in human form must not mean what he says. "In those impious myths there lies an inter- pretation which is very much to the 20 Dio Chrysostom Orat. liii. 4=SVF, I, 274; see Cicero De natura deorum ii.63. 2 Macrobius Sat. i.

The myths themselves are ridicu- lous, but, when they are rejected, one can understand that the gods are immanent in all nature, and what the sphere of each one is.24 The second principle to be explained by Chrysippus was that of etymology. "A deep and ineffable ques- tion," says Origen, "is that concerning the nature of names-whether names are given, as Aristotle thinks, or, as the Stoics suppose, innate."25 And since, ac- cording to the Stoics, names are a part of the nature of things, we are justified in seeking in them the real meaning of the things they signify. The method we use is that of etymology, which unfortunate- ly in ancient times was highly subjective. But Chrysippus composed two works on etymologies,26 and those fragments of his which concern the gods are full of them. According to Cicero, in Chrysippus' second book on the nature of the gods he "wants to accommodate the tales of Orpheus, Musaeus, Hesiod, and Homer to what he himself had said in the first book [i.e., that the gods were powers of nature] .... so that the ancient poets, who did not even suspect these things, might seem to have been Stoics."27 In the handbook of Cornutus,28 a Stoic philosopher exiled from Rome un- der Nero, we find the allegorical principle very thoroughly worked out. Except for Homer and Hesiod, and the ancient philosopher Empedocles, the only au- thor to whom Cornutus refers is the Stoic Cleanthes, whose allegorical ex- 24 Cicero De natura deorum ii. 6i (with the notes of J.

"Thus you, O son, can refer the mythical traditions concerning the gods to the elements which are typified, in the belief that the ancients were not ordinary men, but that they too were able to understand the nature of the world and were disposed to philosophize about it through symbols and dark sayings."30 A very similar explanation is to be found in the second-century writer Maximus of Tyre. "The poets and the philosophers say just the same things; if you change the names you will find the similarity and become acquainted with the meaning of the narrative."3' In view of the popularity of the meth- od it was not to be expected that Greek- speaking Jews at Alexandria and else- where would be hesitant to apply it to the difficulties of their own ancient writ- ings. Even in the translation of the Old Testament into Greek we find an effort- unsystematic, to be sure-to avoid an- thropomorphisms in speaking of God.32 But something more thoroughgoing was needed in order to make the Old Testa- ment speak the language of contempo- rary cosmology and ethics. Such an aid was found in the method of allegoriza- tion, which we see for the first time in the Letter of Aristeas, probably in the second century B.C.33 According to Aristeas, the levitical commandments are symbolic of higher truths. Another Hellenistic Jew who interprets scripture allegorically is 29 Cornutus 3I (p. 64: 15 [Lang]). 30 Ibid. 35 (p. 75: 18). 3I Philosophumena iv. 8g-h (pp. 49-50 [Hobein]). 32 C. T.

Aristobulus, possibly the same man as the tutor of Ptolemy Euergetes men- tioned in II Macc. I: o.34 In a fragment preserved by Eusebius he states that scripture should not be interpreted lit- erally. The "hand" of God is his might, his "speech" is his influence on man's soul, his "standing" is the stability of the world, his" coming down" is unrelated to time or place, the "fire" and "trumpet" of Sinai are metaphorical, the "six days" of creation merely imply development, and the "seventh" reminds us of the cycle of hebdomads among all living creatures. In short, "Moses, using the figures of visible things, tells us the ar- rangements of nature and the constitu- tions of important matters."35 Philo of Alexandria,36 the most famous allegorizer of Hellenistic Judaism, was strongly influenced by Stoics. The al- legorical method, he says, is dear to the physici.37 To them he owes his explana- tion of Abraham and Sarah as "mind" and "virtue," as well as the observation that the seven-branched candelabrum is a symbol of the seven planets.38 These teachers, as Bousset39 seems to have demonstrated, were Stoics, for they dis- cussed questions of fate and necessity, believed in a boundless void surrounding 34 A.

After he had learned it, he went on to apply it remorselessly to scripture and was even able to find it suggested by scripture itself. "So we must turn to al- legory," he says,41 "the method dear to men with their eyes opened. Indeed the sacred oracles most evidently afford us the clues for the use of this method. For they say that in the garden there are trees in no way resembling those with which we are familiar, but trees of Life, of Immortality, of Knowledge, of Appre- hension, of Understanding, of the con- ception of good and evil." The apostle Paul is the earliest al- legorist whom we know in the Christian church. While, as he himself says,42 he was "a Hebrew of Hebrew descent," and therefore his exegesis is largely rab- binic,43 he was born or at any rate brought up in the Hellenistic city of Tarsus. Even if later he studied at the feet of Gamaliel,44 he need not have been unaware of Greek.45 And in one cele- brated instance Paul makes use not only of the allegorical method but also of the Greek word aXX?ryopoutLeva.

These things are meant allegorically: for they are two covenants, one from Mount Sinai, be- gotten for slavery, which is Hagar. Hagar46 means the present Jerusalem, which with her children is in slavery. But the Jerusalem above is free: which is our mother" (Gal. 4: 22-26). Most of the other passages in the New Testament which are at times cited as examples of allegorization are really ex- amples of " types," in which a New Testament event was foreshadowed in the Old Testament. The reality of the type is not denied. But other interpreta- tions close to allegorization are to be found in the Synoptic Gospels.47 These interpretations are clearly not the same as the allegorical explanations of the Stoics or of Paul. They are somewhat like the explanations which the rabbis oc- casionally appended to their parables.48 But Mark and Matthew are denying the simpler meaning of the parables in order to demonstrate their esoteric meaning. "To you is given the mystery .... but to them that are outside all things are done in parables, that seeing they may see and yet not perceive; and hearing they may hear and not understand; lest by any chance they should be converted and be forgiven" (Mark 4: II-I2). The fact that this statement is in part a quo- tation from Isa. 6:9-o1 should not pre- vent us from noticing that in essential meaning it is not unlike the view of Chrysippus. 46 Emending the text with Schott, as noted in E.

I94</page><page sequence="6">THE BIBLE IN THE ANCIENT CHURCH It was in a minority group that al- legorization reached its height. One of the most famous "gnostics" of the second century was Valentinus (ca. I40),49 who taught at Alexandria. He seems to have rejected the Old Testament and to have allegorized the Fourth Gospel. The basis for his interpretation is expressed in his book On the Discourse of Friends.50 "Many of the things written in ordinary books are found written in the church of God; for these are common words from the heart-the law written in the heart." Clement of Alexandria,5' who quotes these words, adds:" Whether by common books he means the Jewish writings or those of the philosophers, he makes truth common to all." Presumably Valentinus did not mean the Jewish writings, for in his opinion "all the prophets and the Law spoke from the inspiration of the Demiurge, a foolish god; they them- selves were fools, who knew nothing. For this reason the Savior declares, 'All who came before me were thieves and robbers' [John Io:8], and the apostle says, 'The mystery which was not known to former generations' [Col. : 26]. For none of the prophets declared anything concerning the things of which we speak."52 Evident- ly Valentinus rejected the Old Testa- ment. What use he made of the New Testament may be seen from the quota- tion above and from the story of his vision which Hippolytus relates.53 "Val- 490n Valentinian exegesis see C. Barth, Die Interpretation des Neuen Testaments in der Valen- tinianische Gnosis ("Texte und Untersuchungen," Vol. XXXVII [Leipzig, I9I1]); texts in W.

It answered and said it was the Logos. Then Valen- tinus, having added some tragic myth, wishes to construct from this the heresy which he had undertaken." The method by which the tragic myth was added was presumably the allegorical interpreta- tion. His follower Ptolemaeus valued the Old Testament more highly and studied it with greater care. In his Letter to Flora he gave an acute analysis of the Law, pointing out that some parts of it must be allegorized.54 He also interpreted the Fourth Gospel allegorically. In a com- mentary on the prologue to the Fourth Gospel which Irenaeus55 quotes, Ptole- maeus finds in the first chapter of John "the first ogdoad, the mother of all the aeons. For he said Father and Grace and Only-begotten and Truth and Logos and Life and Man and Church." Here for the first time we possess a completely al- legorical interpretation of a part of a gospel. Ptolemaeus reads into the Fourth Gospel all the Valentinian doctrine of emanations. Toward the end of the second century another Valentinian, Heracleon,56 pro- duced the first complete commentary on the Fourth Gospel. It survives only in fragments preserved by Origen in his commentary on the same book. Hera- cleon was a thoroughgoing allegorizer. The narrative of the Fourth Gospel never 53Ibid. 42. 2 (p. 173:22 [Wendland]; p. 59:13 [Volker]). 54 Epiphanius Haer. xxxiii. 3-7 (I, 450-57 [Holl]); A. Harnack, Sitzungsberichte ...

I95</page><page sequence="7">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION means what it says; there is always a deeper, more spiritual meaning. While we may agree with Heracleon's intention, we cannot accept his results, for they reflect the Valentinian world-view with all its fantasy and depreciation of matter in favor of pure "spirit." Like many a later commentator, while Heracleon claimed to be discovering a deeper meaning in the gospel he was simply reading into it his own views of the nature of the world and man. Other Valentinian commentators like Theodotus, from whose works Clem- ent of Alexandria made extracts, were equally extreme in their reinterpretation. It cannot be said that they went to greater lengths of allegorization than later interpreters whose orthodoxy was never in question. But the Valentinian world-view which they tried to read into the gospel was so fantastic, and indeed so difficult for the ordinary Christian to comprehend, that their exegetical work had little influence, except perhaps at Alexandria, and died with them. The Valentinians had sought to find what they considered the most advanced learning of their day in the pages of scrip- ture, much as nineteenth-century mod- ernists endeavored to interpret the six days of Genesis as geological periods. Their method, guided only by their fanci- ful theosophical doctrines, was unfortu- nate because it could be used by anyone to find anything. Pagan allegorizers ap- plied it to the Old Testament and found Greek gods and philosophy there.57 Christians in turn made use of it in in- terpreting Homer.ss At the same time Celsus,59 the late second-century critic of 7 Justin Ap. i. 54; Origen Contra Celsum iv. 5I; see Clement Stromata i.

Both sides had achieved what Geffcken6' called "a real chaos of inconsequential polemic." Por- phyry attacks Origen's allegorizations and allegorizes Homer.62 What measure of genuine rationality the allegorical method possesses is ana- lyzed by Origen in an important section of his De principiis.63 The scriptures were written for us and themselves clear- ly attest the necessity of allegorizing. They contain stumbling blocks64 and impossibilities, such as the "days" in Genesis before the sun had been created. There are many examples of this dif- ficulty even in the New Testament. Christ cannot have gone up to the top of a high mountain (Matt. 4:8) from which he could see all the kingdoms of the world. One could not see Persia, Scythia, India, and Parthia all at once from such a place. Moreover, many of the injunc- tions of the Mosaic law, and even of the sayings of Christ, cannot be carried out in practice. This proves that the "scope" or reference of scripture is not the simple literal meaning, since sometimes it is un- true or irrational or impossible. It is such an examination which the saying "Search the scriptures" (John 5:29) requires. All scripture has a "spiritual" (allegorical) as well as a "bodily" (literal) and "psy- chical" (moral) meaning. Unfortunately, even in Origen, whose 6o Aristides I3:7 (p. 21: 7 [Geffcken]); Tatian 21 (p. 23: 22 [Schwartz]). 6i J.

When he discusses the doctrines of creation, incarnation, and resurrection, he is often strongly in- fluenced by philosophical dogmas and inclined to empty Christian teaching of its meaning. The allegorical method can be just as dangerous as literalism if it is employed without reference to the pri- mary doctrines of the Christian religion. Moreover, in its way it is as much an exaggeration of truth as its opposite. Rightly it upholds the permanent and contemporaneous quality of the word of God; but wrongly it assumes that the literal interpretation of that word is in- tended to conceal rather than to reveal meaning. The Christian faith must be read out of the words of scripture, not read into them. Finally, the allegorical method is essentially a tool of apologetics. It can explain away difficulties in the face of attacks from the world outside. It is the method which Ambrose used to re- move the difficulties of the Old Testa- ment.66 But while at first the newly con- verted Augustine eagerly seized upon allegorization, he later realized that it provided no final solution for the prob- lems of Genesis and therefore re-wrote his interpretations. Originally he had found the literal meaning too difficult.67 Later, however, as his faith grew stronger, he ventured to believe that the Bible meant what it said. 65 E. de Faye, Origene sa vie son ewuvre sa pensee, III (Paris, 1928), 269-84; Hal Koch, Pronoia und Paideusis (Berlin and Leipzig, 1932), pp. 305-2I; De princ. i. praef.

III In view of the many conflicting opin- ions concerning scriptural interpretation at the end of the second century, we are not surprised to find attempts being made by those who stood in the main stream of Christian orthodoxy to deter- mine what was the proper method of exegesis. The most important exponent of theological interpretation, in harmony with the mind of the church, is Irenaeus.68 In his work of exegesis he often follows the lead of his own theological teachers, whose theories come out of the earliest anti-Marcionite controversies.69 Like Justin,70 they advise students of scrip- ture to seek the "type" intended by God in the Old Testament.7' Since Marcion had rejected the Old Testament and had refused to permit an allegorizing interpretation of it,72 some clear standard seemed necessary. Typology alone was proving inadequate as the faith of the church developed;73 it provided no real standard of interpretation, as far as theology was concerned.

I97</page><page sequence="9">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION Irenaeus lays down the lines which scriptural interpretation was generally to follow in orthodox Christianity until the end of the nineteenth century. The truth is the possession of the church. It was handed down to the church by the pupils and disciples of the truth, the apostles, who were sent out by Christ in the spirit of truth to proclaim it and to overcome ignorance. Through the spirit of truth the church possesses the knowl- edge of truth and is permanently to ap- proach the scriptures through it. This truth is expressed in the rule of faith (regula fidei), which is guaranteed through the episcopate in churches founded by the apostles.74 The apostolic succession, then, is clearly the guardian and preserver of truth, and in it alone is the truth to be found.75 Moreover, the truth is not confined to scripture, since it is also to be found in the oral tradition of the apostles, es- pecially in the baptismal symbol. This is not only the rule of faith but also the rule of truth.76 It is in the light of tradi- tional apostolic teaching that scripture is to be interpreted. Irenaeus praises Justin for insisting on the continuity and con- sistency of the truth. "Well said Justin in his book Against Marcion, 'I should not have believed the Lord himself if he had announced any other God than the Creator.' "77 In Irenaeus' view there was no essential difference between biblical teaching and the teaching of the church. 74 G. N.

"He who has the changeless rule of truth within him, which he received through baptism, will understand the names and expressions and parables in the scrip- tures."78 "Therefore, having this rule as truth, and a plain testimony concerning God, we ought not to reject the sure and true knowledge of God by turning here and there into solutions of problems. ... .79 We ought to yield such things as these to God who made us, knowing most certainly that the scriptures are com- plete, since they were spoken by the Word of God and by his Spirit."8? No other knowledge is necessary. The questions of philosophy, especially, are irrelevant.8' A very simlar solution to the problem of interpretation is given by Irenaeus' admirer Tertullian82 in his work De praescriptione haereticorum (" On Prescrip- tion against Heretics"), written about 200.83 In this work he does not present a system of interpretation but rather a legal brief to defend the rights of the apostolic succession. Three legal pleas are made against heretics: (I) the praescriptio veritatis: the truth is handed down in the apostolic succession from Christ; (2) the praescriptio principali- tatis: the truth is prior to the heretics' discordant variations from it; and (3) the praescriptio proprietatis: the books 78 See n. 76. 79 Presumably a reference to the debate between Tatian, who wrote a book of Problems, and Rhodo, who replied with Solutions (Eusebius HE v. i3. 8). 80 Adv. haer. ii. 28. 2 (I, 349 [Harvey]). 8I E.g., the cause of the rise of the Nile.

In the course of his writing he denounces philo- sophical learning. "What has Athens to do with Jerusalem? What has the academy to do with the church?"84 Only the heretics incessantly quote Matt. 7:7, "Seek and ye shall find."85 When we possess the truth, no further search is necessary; we possess it in the rule of faith. "To know nothing contrary to the rule is to know everything."86 Clearly if the rule of faith is the final authority in matters of interpretation, the debate between literalism and al- legorical interpretation can to a consider- able extent be disregarded, especially since, as Tertullian points out, the rule itself is based on the gospel.87 Some pas- sages in scripture will be taken literally and others allegorically, and decisions will be made not so much on the basis of philological or philosophical analysis as on the basis of agreement with dog- matic concepts. Those Fathers who most firmly uphold the unchanging super- natural and suprarational character of Christian faith insist most vigorously on the authority of the rule of faith. The most important work on interpre- tation in the ancient church is the De doc- trina Christiana ("On Christian Teach- ing") of Augustine.88 The first three 84 De praescr. haer. 7 (II, io [Oehler]).

An example of anti-Origenist interpretation which retains allegorization is to be found in the writings of Methodius. 88 Edited by H. J. Vogels, Florilegium Patristi- cum, Vol. XXIV (Bonn, I930). On interpretation see Vogels in M. Grabmann-J. Mausbach, Aurdius books, written in 397, describe the meth- ods and guiding principles of scriptural interpretation; the fourth, written thirty years later, is a handbook of Christian rhetoric. Our concern is only with the first three. After an exposition of the main points of Christian orthodoxy, Augustine characteristically points out that some of God's works are to be en- joyed while others are to be employed. For example, man is made in God's image and likeness. Is he to be enjoyed, or used, or both? "It is a precept for us that we should love one another; but it is a question whether a man is to be loved for himself, or for something else. For if it is for himself, we enjoy him; if for something else, we use him. For the happy life is to be found in that which is to be loved for itself."89 But obviously man is not to be loved for himself, since the rule of divine love90 says that you shall love your neighbor as yourself, but God with all your heart and all your soul and all your mind.91 "Whoever, there- fore, seems to himself to have understood the divine scriptures or any part of them, in such a way that by understanding he does not build up that double love of God and neighbor, has not yet understood."92 And "whoever finds another opinion Augustinus (Koln, 1930), pp. 4II-2I; C.

In his second book Augustine turns to special points which require exposition and insists on the need of a liberal educa- tion for their explanation.94 He proves the value of history, for example, from the fact that, since Ambrose knew Plato was in Egypt about the time of Jeremiah, he was able to make it probable that Plato had been instructed in our litera- ture.95 We should imitate those countless Christian writers who have "spoiled the Egyptians."96 We should even learn Hebrew, since many Hebrew words are untranslated in the scriptures.97 The third book takes up "ambiguous signs" which are not clarified either by the law of love or by erudition. As Augus- tine reminds us, the ambiguity caused by faulty translation has been considered in the second book, while the ambiguity found in the subject matter itself has been discussed in the first book, where the principle of consulting the rule of faith has been laid down.98 For example, the heretical interpretation of John 1:1-2 as subordinationist must be re- futed by the rule of faith, in which there is prescribed (i.e., laid down in advance) the equality of the persons of the Trin- 93 Ibid. 41 (p. I8:39). 94 The later influence of this idea may be seen in the works of Cassiodorus, Isidore of Seville, and Hugo of St. Victor. 95Doctr. ii. 43 (p. 39: 19); see F. H. Dudden, op. cit., I, 15-16. 96Doctr. ii. 6i (p. 46:30). The idea is found in Philo; see F. H. Colson in JTS, XVIII (I9I6-I7), 158, n. I. 97 Doctr. ii.

Honest morals pertains to love of God and neighbor; true faith, to knowl- edge of God and neighbor."102 Unfortu- nately, under the influence of this prin- ciple, Augustine decides that the story of the anointing of the Lord's feet with ointment is incredible as it stands in John 12:3 (see Luke 7:36-50), for it is suited only to luxury-loving and wicked men, "whose banquets of that sort we detest." Therefore, the good odor of the ointment must be a good reputation which one can acquire by good works, when he follows the footprints of Christ (vestigia Christi).103 Similarly the im- moralities of the patriarchs must be set aside in the light of the golden rule and the law of love.104 Not everything in the Bible has a literal meaning for everyone; but almost everything has a figurative meaning.?05 Augustine concludes his anal- ysis of allegorical interpretation by setting forth and commenting upon the 99 Ibid. 3; the rule is called praescriptio fidei (ibid. 5 [p. 49: 25]). o00 Ibid. 4 (p. 49: 4). 1?1 Ibid. 8 (p. 5I: 20). 0o2 Ibid.

It is obvious that these rules could not be applied mechanically, and, indeed, Augustine criticizes Tyconius' high claims for their effectiveness as leading the reader into a false hope.0?8 Scripture is too rich and complex for such rules to comprehend it. Elsewhere Augustine makes further analyses of allegorical in- terpretation.'09 But we have examined the subject sufficiently to see that the o16 Ibid. 42-55. On the rules see F. C.

There must be some final arbiter to free us from un- philosophical or philosophical subjec- tivism. This final arbiter is no mere human rule. The true interpreters, Aug- ustine declares,"' must, first of all-it is an absolute necessity-pray, that they may understand. IV What is the meaning of this principle of interpretation in our own day? For the Roman Catholic the answer is simple, the principle still retains all its ancient authority, though certain modifications are occasionally permitted."2 For the Protestant, however, with his traditional doctrine of the verbal inspiration of scripture badly damaged by the as- saults of a century of historical criticism and-more important-with the former unity of his theological outlook shattered as a result of modernism and liberalism, no such answer is possible. If the author- ity for interpretation is to be the common mind of the church, the Protestant can only ask, "Where is the church?" Fur- thermore, the Protestant is better able than others to observe the changes in Christian doctrine which have taken place in nineteen centuries of develop- ment; he cannot believe that Christian theology is crystallized in any one form or that it will be so crystallized.

And yet, in the ecumenical church of tomorrow or the day after, even the in- terpretation of scripture must play its part. If theology is to be understood as the relating of the insights contained in the ancient books of Christianity to the common life of Christians today, regard for that life must be considered as the first of the interpreter's obligations. Inter- pretation must be historical; it must seek to discover (in so far as it can) the mean- ing of the word for the age in which it was spoken; but it must go on to make that word relevant to the life of today. Pre- sumably the relevance will not be essen- tially different; and yet the interpreter will be aware of the varying needs of the ancient church and of the church in our times. Unless he has regard for the faith of Christians, he cannot properly under- stand the work he is endeavoring to in- terpret. The spirit must mean more to him than the letter. He must live and work in the environment in which the books were produced-which is the Christian community, the "faithful com- pany of all believers." 202</page></plain_text>
