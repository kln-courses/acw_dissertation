Geneva: Droz, 1995. Paper. Pp. xiv, 382; 2 black-and-white illustrations. In this revised edition of Wagner's anthology Collet aims at representing aspects of the most important literary traditions of the French Middle Ages while showing a philological interest that is not only linked to the grammatical content and cultural value of the texts but also to various issues such as text editing, formal and narrative techniques, text recep- tion, etc. Collet wants his edition to reflect the progress made within the fields of textual criticism and literary history since 1960. This involves a widening of the corpus and the substitution of numerous excerpts with "more fecund ones" with regard to the questions raised by medieval texts (p. xii). The corpus also benefits from the addition of texts that were not edited or rarely studied at the time of the first edition (e.g., Rene d'Anjou's Le Cuer d'Amour espris). Wagner's long preface is replaced with a witty foreword by Bernard Cerquiglini (pp. vii- ix), which actually offers readers better guidance than Collet's own preface. It is indeed not always easy to handle this very rich anthology of around eighty-five texts and excerpts (instead of sixty) ranging from the ninth to the fifteenth century and belonging to genres as different as courtly lyric poetry and a bourgeois's recommendations to his young wife (Le Mesnagier de Paris). Texts are accompanied by a short but comprehensive bibliography and by notes about authors, language, sources, dating, and base manuscripts. They are often but not always introduced by short summaries (e.g., there is none in the case of the Song of Roland, and the term "chanson de geste" is not mentioned, pp. 35-39). Wary of editorial errors, Collet carefully double-checked the editors' work with his own reading of the manuscripts (whenever possible). His bibliographical notices represent a considerable amount of work and are undoubtedly very useful. I have noticed, however, that some editions by English-speaking scholars are not mentioned (e.g., Sarah Kay, ed., Raoul de Cambrai [Oxford, 1992]). A potential problem lies in the fact that readers are rarely told why some excerpts are presented in a specific way and that they may then not be able to grasp the philological interest of the presentation. We are, for example, given several versions of the same text as presented in different manuscripts without being told why it might be of interest to us (e.g., three versions of Jean Renart's Lai de l'Ombre). Similarly, it is not always clear that some texts are linked to each other, for example, the two parts of the Roman de la Rose or the two versions of the conquest of Constantinople by Villehardouin and by Robert de Clari. In both cases these excerpts are separated from each other by several others. This is due to the fact that Collet, contrary to Wagner, pays a lot of attention to the date at which texts were composed. Excerpts are consequently organized in a very rigid chronological way, which might sometimes seem a bit forced since it is very difficult to date medieval texts with precision. In conclusion, although a certain level of expertise in medieval literature is necessary in order to manipulate the book in an optimal way, I would definitely recommend it. Collet presents a very comprehensive perspective on medieval French texts as well as a stimulating overview of contemporary philological interests.

In this book Ulrike Wiethaus compares Das fliessende Licht der Gottheit of the thirteenth- century beguine Mechthild of Magdeburg with models of consciousness and human de- Reviews 1220</page><page sequence="2">velopment of twentieth-century humanistic psychologists and psychophysiological theo- rists. This dual analysis is motivated by two goals: a commitment to making Western mysticism "intellectually accessible to a contemporary audience" and an interest in the debate about "the nature of religious experiences that occur during mystical states of con- sciousness." Yet the book is not a simple imposition of twentieth-century psychological theory upon a thirteenth-century text; Wiethaus repeatedly points to the limitations of those theories for analyzing the mystical life described by Mechthild. Furthermore, she is attentive to the significant cultural differences separating the two worlds in which her subject matter was produced. Wiethaus's work is grounded in feminist theory, which enables her to an- alyze some of the subtle gender issues in Mechthild's writing and illuminate very incisively the ways in which aspects of the psychological models she surveys tend to reproduce values that are generally constructed as male in twentieth-century Western culture. The book begins with an introductory framing of Mechthild's cultural context and the basic outlines of consciousness theory. After this the chapters alternate between discussions of Mechthild and discussions of what Wiethaus deems the modern theories most relevant to her analysis of Mechthild. She begins with an examination of Mechthild's descriptions of ecstatic experience. I found this chapter very suggestive yet also confusing at points. For example, Wiethaus mounts a strained argument that Mechthild's exhortation to read her book nine times is an evocation of the nine angelic choirs, only then to quote a passage in which Mechthild explicitly differentiates human from angelic experience. This passage is fascinating, but if anything, it undermines her earlier argument. In a puzzling interpretation Wiethaus characterizes Mechthild's role as sacerdotal because Mechthild writes that she can receive answers for all her questions. A comparison between the Song of Songs and Das fliessende Licht ostensibly illustrates a shared threefold process, but the stages de- scribed seem to suggest a different sequence. Wiethaus cites one section of the text as abounding in nonanthropomorphic imagery but mentions only one scene depicting God wooing the simple soul, a very anthropomorphic image. She offers a fascinating glimpse into Mechthild's view of evil (devils have been given circumscribed passageways in the air that can be blocked by beams of divine light connecting God and the saintly soul in ecstasy), yet she interprets this image in terms of fields or auras of energy surrounding people, an interpretation that seems to contrast with Mechthild's vectorial images of beams and pas- sageways. These and other questions about Wiethaus's interpretation of Das fliessende Licht may be due to the abbreviated scope of the discussion; the reader depends on Wiet- haus for both description and interpretation of a very rich text, and without detailed anal- yses of the text, Wiethaus's characterization of Mechthild's work sometimes seems arbi- trary. The discussion of ecstasy is followed by two chapters in which Wiethaus outlines two major models of humanistic psychology (those of Abraham Maslow and Roberto Assagioli) and two psychotherapeutic models (those of Arthur Deikman and Claudio Naranjo). The choice of Maslow and Assagioli is based on fundamental assumptions that they share with each other and with Mechthild: that reality is bipolar (i.e., there is a higher and a lower plane of existence), and that there is a dynamic process of human development in which a person can evolve to a more authentic state of being. Deikman and Naranjo are chosen for their efforts at bridging mysticism and science. Many of Wiethaus's most important points about Mechthild emerge in the comparison of Mechthild's description of ecstatic experience with these psychological theories. Mech- thild's view of self as complex and decentered is contrasted with Assagioli's model of a single, unified self that has successfully erased any "lower" drives and inclinations. Mech- thild's ecstasies, embedded in her Christian belief and practice, are experiences of union with another, in contrast to Maslow's emphasis on experiences of self. Wiethaus contrasts Deikman's sense of theistic union as a defective and oppressive model of the self with Reviews 1221</page><page sequence="3">Mechthild's love mysticism, which rejects a hierarchical vision of the universe. In Wiet- haus's elegant expression, for Mechthild, "the higher self is constructed in communion with an Other, not in opposition to it. As such, it sharply contrasts [to] the model of the isolated self of patriarchy that is coiled inward and incapable of peaceful and constructive inter- action with another." And Mechthild's struggle with hardship, suffering, and evil points to the somewhat facile views of Maslow, where peak experiences are always rewarding and evil is an illness-transient, manageable, and able to be transcended. The second part of the book includes an analysis of Mechthild's visionary experience and theories dealing with the relationship between visionary knowledge and psychophys- iological states. A theme sounded in the first section is further developed here. Despite the positive evaluation that the twentieth-century theorists attribute to what they variously call holotropic states, intuition, or peak experiences, they usually see those experiences embed- ded in religious traditions that they consider problematic. Charles Tart represents perhaps the extreme view in trying to rescue mystical experiences from the "ideological pollution" or cultural indoctrination imposed by those who actually experience them. Wiethaus's accomplishment in this book is to highlight the scientific biases in these approaches and to suggest the ways in which Mechthild's writing attests to a more complicated view of the relationship between culture and religious experience. Despite Wiethaus's desire to treat Das fliessende Licht as the product of a thirteenth- century beguine, there are aspects of her analysis that are troubling on historical grounds. For example, her discussion of perceptible changes in style and context as Mechthild ages seems to be based on an assumption of chronological arrangement of the chapters. Since Das fliessende Licht was compiled by Mechthild's Dominican confessor Henry of Halle, who collected and rearranged Mechthild's writings, a discussion of the production of the text or of its status as reflecting Mechthild's own voice would have supplemented this analysis. (One puzzling parenthetical reference to Mechthild's editor is given a footnote.) Also, Wiethaus repeatedly refers to Mechthild's precarious status because of her identity as a beguine, but she offers no discussion of beguine life that characterizes the nature of that general marginality. Such a discussion would also provide context for one incident in Mechthild's life that Wiethaus does discuss: a 1261 synod in Magdeburg that ordered beguines to obey their parish priests. It must also be said that the book suffers from careless copyediting: most significantly, many items cited in notes simply by author's last name and publication date do not appear in the bibliography. Wiethaus concludes her book with an acknowledgment that her book raises more ques- tions than it answers. This is both true and too modest. She has taken the risk of pursuing truly interdisciplinary work and, in so doing, has both illuminated some of the complex aspects of a profound mystical text and provided an insightful analysis of a range of psy- chological theories relevant to the study of mysticism.
