<plain_text><page sequence="1">GERMAN PHILOSOPHY IN i908.1 IN characterizing the philosophical literature of the past year in Germany, I would say, by way of preface, that it follows the lines suggested by the previous status of the problems of philos- ophy. German philosophy in the last ten years shows a contin- uous and clear line of development. The analysis of the intel- lectual situation and prognosis of its future development given in my last two articles have, on the whole, been justified. I took the ground there that contemporary German philosophy presents a revival of idealistic speculation, and I showed this in detail. What I said then is equally true of present conditions; philos- ophy is still taking its bearings from idealism. A gradual clari- fication continues, fantastic and mystical exaggeration diminishes, the force of tradition lessens, and the tendency to independence grows more evident. In this connection one cherishes the hope that German philosophy, strengthened and enriched by intimate contact with the great past, undisturbed by foreign factors, will again travel its own way. Perhaps this development may be stimulated by the interna- tional character of modern investigation, which prevents isolation and one-sidedness by the constant exchange of intellectual views. This international character of inquiry finds expression not only in the increased intercourse promoted by philosophical journals, but in still higher degree in the facilities for personal discussion. The Third International Congress of Philosophy met in Heidel- berg August 3' to September 5, 1908. Windelband, in his ad- dress of welcome, correctly emphasized the immense external development of all the forces of civilization, the gigantic progress of technical factors, and the fact that these demanded supple- mentary deepening of the inner aims and grounds of being, if the whole expenditure of energy is pot to assume the character of senseless, haphazard guess work. Philosophical cooperation, he went on to say, confines itself to the shaping and adjustment of ITranslated from the German by Wm. A. Hammond. 5 I4</page><page sequence="2">GERMAN PHILOSOPHY IN 908. 5I5 ideas, through which culture-ideals are expressed in a unitary view of life and the world. For this reason, interest in modern philosophy centers in epistemology, which does not, however, sever the connection between knowledge and reality. " One does not think of the relation of consciousness to reality, without thinking of the problem of reality itself; and in this sense there is no epistemology which does not imply a metaphysic. The in- vestigation of this relation, therefore, in the form of a revision of our conception of truth, is everywhere noticeable in the current philosophical program, and we welcome renewed opportunities of exchanging views on the subject." In this way Windelband pointed out that the opportunity for personal exchange of opinions is of great value to the philosopher, because every philosophy is, in addition to its being conditioned by facts, an expression of individuality. " We do not desire a synod or council to deter- mine dogmatically any doctrines. We come together to weigh principles with one another; we desire to learn through personal exchange of ideas how to be just to all views; we believe that in their being set in opposition they will be fortified and polished, and that in this personal reciprocity every one will take a step forward on the path, whose goal is in the limitless." In Windel- band's address the principal point is his reference to the organic connection between epistemology and metaphysics. He has correctly characterized the situation in contemporary philosophy, and the program of the Congress corresponds with this. Here we have renewed confirmation of the fact that interest in the problems of metaphysics is strengthened, rather than diminished, by epistemology.' Windelband expressed the foregoing view again in his im- portant address, " On the Concept of Law." The emancipation of the concept of law from anthropomorphism and its trans- cendental establishment by Kant cannot be made to furnish aid to subjectivism. The introduction of order into our perceptions and their elevation into experience by means of this concept, would be unthinkable unless order were ultimately given in the nature of things. I Attention was called to this fact in my report for the year of 1907.</page><page sequence="3">5P6 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XVIII. Windelband's interpretatation of the concept of law leans unmistakably towards realism. To the discussion of the concept he adds a brief review of the notion of phenomenon. Hitherto one has been disposed to regard this notion qualitatively, and has, therefore, made a fundamental distinction between phenomenon and thing-in-itself. The tendency of modern epistemology, on the contrary, is to convert the relation into quantitative terms; the phenomenal world is a part of the real world. As every per- ception presents a choice of the possibilities of sensation, as every notion presents a choice of the possibilities of perception, so every theory, under a determinate epistemological aim, presents a choice of the given. This interesting view, which in a certain sense is a synthesis of Kant's and Fechner's ideas, will, no doubt, be completely developed in Windelband's forthcoming mono- graph on the Concept of Law. Windelband's theory of truth thus approximates that point of view, which I said in my last annual report was characteristic of the present philosophical tend- ency, to which other philosophers, especially Simmel, incline. The absolute opposition between knowing and being is sur- rendered in favor of a view, which sees in knowledge, together with morality and art, only one aspect of the world. These ideas are suggestive of an inexhaustibly rich and many-sided view of reality. Undoubtedly this conception has something in common with the position of Nietzsche, which differs from the traditional scepticism, by denying, not the possibility of knowledge in general, but the possibility of a homogenous (unitary) knowledge. The importance of the problem of truth, in its mediatory posi- tion between epistemology and metaphysics, is indicated by the fact that it was the focus of discussion in the Congress. The immediate stimulus to the discussion was furnished by Professor Royce's address on Pragmatism in the first general session. The subject of the address was " The Problem of Truth in the Light of Recent Research." The distinguished savant characterized in a few words three conceptions of truth: the instrumental, the individualistic, and the absolutistic. The first regards truth as a product of biological adaptations, the second as the arbitrary product of the individual will, the third as an eternal, over-indi-</page><page sequence="4">No. 5.] GERMHAN PHILOSOPHY IN 1908. 5I7 vidual coherence in the essence of the logical spirit, to which the principles of logic and mathematics bear witness. Royce at- tempted to bring about a synthesis of these three views, by in- terpreting the absolutistic conception, not intellectualistically, but voluntaristically, as the form and norm of will. In this way he aims to convert transcendentalism into terms of Pragmatism, to reconcile epistemology with the claims of will. It is clear that Royce's position is intimately related to Neo-Fichteanism, which is at present influential in Germany. Common to both is the ac- knowledgment of the claims of pure logic to create absolute, eternal values, which include the autonomous and sovereign to- tality of the logical, viewed as the expression of an over-indi- vidual will. In this form, Pragmatism would not have challenged the oppo- sition of the exponents of logic; but inasmuch as the other advo- cates formulated Pragmatism in terms of the instrumental or bio- logical concept of truth,-the opposition of the aprioristic school was challenged, and all the groups of Neo-Kantians and Neo- Fichteans combined in combating the theory, which threatened to resolve the fundamental principles of knowledge into subjective relativity. The discussion of this topic was the climax of the Congress, and the issue was unquestionably favorable to the aprioristic position, which was supported by Royce. The congress was divided into seven sections: (i) History of philosophy; (2) general philosophy, meta- physics, and philosophy of nature; (3) psychology; (4) logic and epistemology; (5) ethics and sociology; (6) aesthetics; (7) philosophy of religion. In the second general session an ingeni- ous and valuable dialectic exposition of aesthetics was presented in Benedetto Croce's address on L'intuizione pura e il carattere lirico dell' arte. In the third general session Boutroux characterized concisely the general trend of philosophy in France since i867. Heinrich Maier gave an interesting and instructive address on David Friedrich Strauss, more particularly in his relation to materialism. The shorter papers in the special sections also brought valuable material to light.</page><page sequence="5">5i8 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XVIII. It is deserving of special mention that the celebrated Indol- ogist, Professor Deussen, presented to the second general session of the Congress his History of Indian Philosophy, just completed, with an appendix on China and Japan, and in a few expressive words pointed out the significance of the history of philosophy in general, and more especially of Brahrnanic and Buddhistic philosophy. This Congress, which brought together a body of the most eminent savants of the civilized world in the famous university city of Heidelburg, thus awakened the desire that philosophers might continue by the method of mutual contact to strengthen and enlarge the culture of the spirit. The international character of the Congress was again strikingly evident. That the evolution of civilization should not be determined by any particular national interest, that it should have unlimited cosmopolitan cooperation, was one of the chief notes struck in the Congress, and approved by loud applause. This feeling is a moral success of the Con- gress, in no way inferior to its theoretical success. The task of the Congress was not to convince its members of the validity of any particular view, but to present the possibility of mutual agreement on fundamental problems, within which the varying theories might be better worked out and so become more clearly differentiated from each other. Opposing theories in philosophy always constitute a stimulus to fruitful development. But the points within a given material where we must have clearness, are the selection of problems and the conception of ultimate aims and presuppositions. The Congress showed the power of Neo-Kantianism, in the use made of it to repulse external attacks. Also from within it has lost none of its influence. During the past year the Kant- studien has published a series of interesting and valuable articles, which concern us here mainly in so far as they touch upon the fundamental problems of methodology and epistemology. In a thorough analysis of Heinrich Gomperz's philosophy, Professor August Messer opposes Gomperz's attempt to introduce a new method, the " pathempirical." He points out that this method, with its derivation of pure epistemological values from the feel-</page><page sequence="6">No. 5.] GERMAN PHILOSOPHY IN 108. 5I9 ings, ends in psychologist. Messer's criticism, expressed in very subtle and precise argumentation, that Gomperz distinguishes too little between the subjective comprehension of values, substance, relation, identity, and their objective meaning, will scarcely apply in strictness to the second volume of Gomperz's Noologie, of which I shall have to speak later. Kant in the Lzght of Ultra- montane and Liberal Catholicism, is the title of an article by Bauch, which deals with two representatives of these two religious tendencies. Bauch rejects the ultramontane standpoint emphat- ically. He characterizes the liberal standpoint as a half-way place, in so far as it ignores the confessional, on the one hand, and on the other, recognizes the absolute, and not merely the historical, significance of dogma. H6nigswald treats epistemological problems in a notable article: Zum Begriff der kritischen Erkenntnistheorie, which takes issue with Uphues's work on Kant und seine Vorgiinger. He discusses primarily the relation between epistemology and metaphysics, and rejects the metaphysical interpretation of the categories in favor of an immanent theory of experience. Supplementary numbers of the Kantstudien appeared last year. I mention here Kant's Lehre vom innern Sinn in der Kritik der reinen Vernunft by Franz Rademaker, and Kant's Still in der Kritik der reinen Vernunft by Ernst Fischer. Riehl's comprehensive work, Der philosophische Kritizismus, the first volume of which in the second revised edition has come from the press of Engelmann, Leipzig, takes the reader back to the sources of Neo-Kantianism. Only about a third of the first edition reappears in the second; but the essential features of the work, the realistic interpretation of Kant, the insistence on the dependence of all experience on external things, receive even greater emphasis in the new edition. Riehl regards Locke as the first critical philosopher, and includes Descartes amongst the dogmatists. In this he differs entirely from the Marburg School, which classifies these two philosophers in the opposite way, as may be seen in Cassirer's lately published book Das Erkenntnis- problem. He regards Hume as the founder of modern positivism rather than as an exponent of scepticism. Both English philos-</page><page sequence="7">520 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XVIII. gophers are subjected to a searching analysis. The history of the development and completion of the critical philosophy forms the climax and conclusion of the book. At this point Riehl directs his criticism particularly against two interpretations of the tran- scendental methodology, the psychologistic and idealistic. Psy- chology, he says, covers merely a part, the inner part of experi- ence; consequently the whole system of experience cannot be based upon it. The idealistic position is equally untenable. In distinction from Berkeley, Kant never doubted the existence of external things; on the contrary, he made them the fundament of his philosophy, for the notion of phenomenon disappears with the notion of the thing-in-itself. Transcendental idealism asserts merely the ideality of pure space and pure time. He claims that these forms of perception represent merely the reaction of con- sciousness to the stimulus of external things. In this stimulus the reality of external things is clearly presupposed. For both of these theses, Riehl finds numerous historical confirmations in lately discovered sources. With Hume's principle of not ex- tending the use of reason beyond the field of experience, Kant combined the principle, which Hume did not grasp, of inter- preting the field of experience as not coincident with the vision of reason. The general tendency of the critical philosophy is finally characterized by Riehl in the sentence: The Critique of Pure Reason affirms the metaphysical, but rejects metaphysics. Riehl is an avowed Neo-Kantian. He preserves carefully the balance between the subjective and objective, and rejects em- phatically the one-sidedness, which has been the error of the great followers of Kant. Consequently, he opposes Fichte and Neo- Fichteanism. The Neo-Fichteanism, which goes back to Rickert and Win- delband, has found an interesting supporter in Miinsterberg. His psychological writings had already pointed in this direction, but his Pklosogphie der Werte, published last year,' a book of exten- sive proportions, aims avowedly to revive the fundamental posi- tion of Fichte. The work is divided into two parts, the first of which presents a theory of values, and the second part a system '-Leipzig, Ambrosius Barth, pp. viii, 486.</page><page sequence="8">No. 5.] GERMAN PHILOSOPHY IN 1908. 52I of values. The first division handles the problem of principles with great clearness. The boundary line between value and reality is nicely drawn, one of the best discussions of this difficult problem that has been published. It is particularly significant that Miinsterberg extends the concept of nature, reality, to in- clude psychical phenomena, the inner world. Psychology suffers from a peculiar vacillation in the interpretation of its problems. The meaning of inner purpose and aim in the psychical life, its characteristic of intention, does not fall within psychology. The confusion of the two realms of causal and voluntaristic psychology obscures the relation between value and reality. For causal psy- chology, which analyzes inner experience, similarly to the analysis of external bodies, into its elements, there is nothing to which one can immediately ascribe value, not even to the feeling of value; for in the objective system of nature, this phenomenon is quite as independent of value as is a feeling to which no value attaches. The world, conceived as psycho-physical nature, is fundamentally independent of value, whether in molecular move- ment human organisms are destroyed or preserved, whether in human organization joy or pain, feelings of value or valueless- ness, pass through the soul. This is the final word in the world of physics and psychology. But neither physics nor psychology exhaust the whole of reality. Rather the mere fact that we have physics and psychology is proof of the existence of an inde- pendent realm of values. For both of these denote an arbitrary transformation of immediate reality from an evaluating standpoint. While the content of physical and psychological reality is con- ceived as neutral, thinking itself acquires the character of in- tellectual evaluation. We may say in apparent paradox: the absence of value proves value.' Miinsterberg goes on- to show that in the concept of value there is implied an unconditioned, absolute value, which proves the relativistic, evolutionary, and pragmatic theories of value to be untenable. By these theories the world is dissolved in a dream. For every effort to attain I [" The objects of the scientific judgments are without value, but the scientific judgments themselves are affirmations of value." MUnsterberg, The Eternal Values, p. 23 -Translator.]</page><page sequence="9">522 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XVIII. logical, ethical, religious, and esthetic values rises above the per- sonal sphere into a transcendental, although not a metaphysical, world. It is neither a must nor ought that binds the human will to value. All values are derived from a pure will, which has no reference to the individual, but uses the individual merely as a means for the furtherance of the eternal reality. The will to value is an absolute, unequivocal, and pure will, independent of pleasure and pain. Mfinsterberg takes the case of a criminal to prove that ultimately the will even of a bad man aims at the good. A psy- chological analysis of an act of will shows that it is not at all de- termined by pleasure as an aim; the satisfaction of the will is not dependent upon pleasure or displeasure. There is a funda- mental act of will of an over-personal kind: the will that demands a world, i. e., that there be a persistent and coherent reality. We demand that there be a world, that the content of our experi- ence be more than just passing experience, more than dream or chaos. " That experience is not merely individual life but a valid over-personal world; this is neither a truth, nor duty, nor beauty, nor a sacred good; for all truths, beauties, duties, and holinesses of the world are themselves necessarily dependent on the demand that there be a world." The following are the several fundamental directions of evalua- tion: the value of conservation, the value of agreement, the value of realization, and the value of completion. Within these four directions we differentiate the immediate values of life and the purposive values of civilization. Further, in all these groups our experience may refer to three different fields, viz., to the outer world, our inner world, or our fellow-world. The system of logical, Aesthetic, ethical, and metaphysical values is discussed in the second part of the volume, in the theory of basic values, the cosmos, humanity, and the over-self, the aim of which is to for- mulate a philosophy of " eternal absolute deed of the over-self," an energistic optimism. Mfinsterberg is a follower and reviver of Fichte, not merely in his system of values and in the derivation of ethics, but especially in the epistemological basis of his concept of value. The doctrine of pure will, of will that demands that there be a world, in spite of the independent way in which Miins-</page><page sequence="10">No. 5.] GERMAN PHILOSOPHY IN 1908. 523 terberg carries it out, goes back to Fichte. The same advance beyond Kantianism is marked by it as characterized Fichte's philosophy. Reality in its complete fullness was for Kant an eternally foreign element, which the human spirit could master only in the form of intellectual statement. It could come no nearer to the inner essence of reality than that, and Kant's ethics and doctrine of freedom culminate in the idea of a complete iso- lation of the intellectual subject, his complete severance from the alien element of nature. Fichte, on the contrary, aimed from the standpoint of the ego to comprehend the non-ego, which for Kant was an impassable boundary. He (Fichte) regarded the non-ego as a necessary function of the ego, as its creation. He thereby overcame the dualistic opposition between two worlds. If one eliminates the metaphysical factor from this view, one dis- covers its real essence in the doctrine of the will that demands a world-identity. Jonas Cohn's interesting work' is also influenced by the spirit of Fichte. But Fichte's influence here is felt less in ethics than in the general field of logic. This is true of the doctrine of the knowing ego, which Jonas Cohn, like Rickert, regards as an over-individual ego. In knowing, the individual ego strives to attain the standpoint of the over-individual ego. The over- individual ego, however, is neither a metaphysical reality nor a mere relation, but the totality of the constitutive forms of knowl- edge. The emancipation from the component parts of the individual ego is the problem of knowledge. In so far as man solves this problem, he approaches the over-individual ego. In a very comprehensive analysis of judgment, which also discusses the nature of inquiry and other intellectual functions, the author bases thereon his proof that all knowing is judging. With this is connected an investigation of the nature and kinds of relation. Then follows a long section on mathematical matters, occupied with the concepts of number, space, and the geometrical axioms. This is succeeded by a very remarkable chapter on continuity and the antinomies of the limitless, in which the author furnishes interesting discussions of space and time, and devotes himself to 1 Voraussebzungen und Ziele des Erkennens, Leipzig, i908, pp. v, 526.</page><page sequence="11">524 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XVIII. the exposition of the difficulties involved in these concepts, amongst which the most important is the idea of a completed infinity. These antinomies are rooted in the tendency to think the world as a whole. The further discussions are occupied with the concepts of existence and reality, and with the foundations of the doctrine of the categories. The author also devotes atten- tion to the reciprocal limits of psychology and logic. In logic the crucial value of truth has to be investigated. Psychology, on the contrary, is the constructive presentation of connected experience with reference to the individual subject, and with the aim of making it knowable from an over-individual standpoint. The transition to a system of values forms the conclusion of the work. Here Jonas Cohn shows a freer critical attitude towards Neo-Fichteanism and Neo-Hegelianism.- He does not sub- ordinate logic to ethics nor ethics to logic. He rejects entirely the blind scheme of subsumption. The relation between these two fields of values is rather one of mutual supplementation. Similar conditions hold good of religion and aesthetics. The factor of immediate experience that characterizes the system, points from the philosopher to the artist. Consequently, it is Goethe's name that determines the direction of such a great system. The same motive that led Fichte beyond Kant, points from Fichte to Schelling. The material world of external nature is no longer to be regarded as a mere boundary idea, as an eternal foreign element, incomprehensible to the human spirit. Fichte made a beginning by interpreting it as the creation of the ego. But this was only a beginning. It is true, nature was no longer regarded as an impassable boundary, as Kant had regarded it. But it still retained for Fichte the character of a barrier that the absolute ego posits in order to overcome it. The whole of nature continued to be referred to the subject in a one-sided fashion, and so this system was a great anthropomorphic philos- ophy, which was unable to attain the ideal of pure knowing. Nature in its inwardness, in the fullness of its individual phenom- enal forms, could not be mastered in this way. It was reserved for Schelling to emancipate philosophy from these anthropomor- phic bonds, by interpreting subject and object as co-equal ema-</page><page sequence="12">No. 5.] GERMAN PHILOSOPHY IN 1908. 525 nations of the absolute, thus grasping the structure of being in its immanent logical character and necessity. The notion of emanation from the absolute, from the life of the pure idea is common to Schelling and Hegel. The point of divergence be- tween them is not so much in the formulation of the problem as in the methodological manner of its treatment. Schelling grounded his philosophy ultimately on intuition, Hegel on the logical movement of dialectic. Amongst the later philosophic movements, as I have repeat- edly pointed out, Hartmann's school is most closely related to Schelling's views. Here also we have as the basic factor an ab- solute world-principle, the Unconscious, which includes nature and spirit. Arthur Drews, whose recent writings were referred to in my last report, has emphasized this historical connection. In the second volume of a collection of monographs edited by Drews and entitled Der Monisrnus,1 the first volume of which was mentioned in my last article, this connection is again discussed. The second volume deals with historical matters, and contains essays by Liebert, Marie Joachimi, Otto Weiss, Max Wentscher, Wilhelm von Schnehen, Otto Braun, and an essay of especial in- terest by Alma von Hartmann entitled Eduard von Hartmnann's Konkreter Monismus, in which the relation between the monism of the Unconscious and the philosophy of identity is made plain. This connection is also clear from Otto Braun's Schelling studies, Hinauf zumn Idealismus,2 in which the attempt is made to present Schelling's personality and doctrine in their relation to the intel- lectual movements of the romantic period and the present. The difference between Schelling's philosophy of identity and von Hartmann's philosophy of the Unconscious, as shown by the above-mentioned writings, consists chiefly in the fact that for Schelling's aprioristic intuition, or dialectic method, von Hart- mann substitutes an inductive and empirical method. In this, one recognizes an approximation to Fries, which however is formal, for induction in Hartmann'? case is employed in the ser- vice of metaphysics, while in the Fries school it is employed in building up an epistemological psychology and phenomenology. 'Jena, Diederichs, pp. 201. -'Leipzig, Eckardt, I908, pp. 154.</page><page sequence="13">526 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XVIII. The clearest proofs of the foregoing are found, as one might expect, in Hartmann's own works, especially in his System der Philosophic imn Grundriss, now being published by Haacke (Sachsa im Harz), of which the third, fourth, and fifth volumes, containing Grundriss der Psychologie, Grundriss der Metaphysi;k, Grundriss der Axiologie, appeared in i908. IHegel's influence is at present less apparent. That the development of modern philosophy must ultimately take him into account, I have said repeatedly. Above all it is the purely logical, anti-psychological character of modern philosophical thought, the demand, if I may so say, of the theoretical spirit for a movement in terms of itself, that will naturally necessitate a return to Hegel. While this tendency in foreign countries, England, Italy, and Holland, has brought about a renaissance of Hegelianism, it has also found represen- tatives in Germany, amongst whom I may name Medikus and especially Ferdinand Jacob Schmidt. Meanwhile, it is precisely its extreme radicalism that makes it impossible to keep this movement in the ascendant. It is all the while evident that dia- lectic is powerless to create new knowledge; it can only so interpret the old knowledge, gained by way of experience, that it may be called a genial exposition of the world-process, but incapable of becoming a substitute for real investigation. And so in this year we have in the German language only Bolland's new edition of Hegel's Vorlesungen uiber die Geschichte der Phi- losophie.' However, new editions of other works of Hegel are announced in Germany. Although the influence of the dialectic has suffered constant diminution, owing to the growth of empiricism, it should be kept in mind that Hegel's influence on our time is not confined to this methodological point. On the contrary, his doctrine of the concrete spirit, which manifests itself in a manifold and yet unitary way in every sphere of civilization, has sunk much deeper into the consciousness of his successors. What is most characteristic of Hegel is his struggle to get beyond the stadium of the natural, to transcend the narrow limits of the subjective spirit. A higher spiritual being, richer in relations, which cannot be conceived I Amsterdam, Muller, i908.</page><page sequence="14">No. 5.] GERMAN PHILOSOPHI' IN 1908. 527 from a naturalistic standpoint, envelops as a totality the indi- vidual. For its laws are fulfilled, not in the individual's existence, but only in the communal life, as it expresses itself in society and history. This view, which Hegel developed much more clearly than Schelling on its philosophical-historical side, is re- vived amongst contemporary thinkers, especially by Eucken. The notion of the life of the spirit, which Eucken is constantly striving to explain in its significance for humanity, is approxi- mately the same idea as Hegel's notion of the objective and absolute spirit. This holds good also of the fact that both are concerned, not merely with a logical point of view, but with a metaphysical reality. The life of the spirit is not shut to humanity, neither is it a ready-made possession. Otherwise there would be no world-history, the very meaning of which is the gradual evolution and realization of eternal values in tempo- ral existence. What more than anything else reveals the kin- ship between Eucken's fundamental postulates and those of Schelling, is the fact that Eucken does not oppose the inner world as the totality of values to external nature, but regards both, subject and object, as two aspects of nature, which can acquire absolute value only by being lifted to the independent and absolute life of the spirit. This standpoint has been stated in Eucken's recent writings: Einfizhrung in die Philosophie des Geisteslebens, and Der Sinn und Wert des Lebens.' Only by faith in such an universal, spiritual world, including in itself man and nature, and transformed into historical reality by its unceasing movement, can one, in Eucken's opinion, escape pessimism and nihilism. In another sense, George Simmel approximates the spirit of Hegel. His Soziologie, a comprehensive analysis of the forms of human association, belongs here both by reason of its method and its matter. The fascinating peculiarity of Simmel's philos- ophy is that its form, by its own power, seeks and posits an ade- quate content. And so it is that the logical mode in which Simmel handles the social problem, gives to his subject-matter a philosophical significance. As a general characteristic, one must 'Leipzig, Quelle und Meyer.</page><page sequence="15">528 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XVIII. say that Simmel's sociology is not at all an atiological, but rather a strictly phenomenological presentation. He does not inquire into the ultimate moving causes and stimuli of social life, but rather into its inner structure and configuration, into the fullness of its characteristic relations. He gives greater prominence to mathematical than to dynamic factors. In the first chapter, im- portant for epistemology, entitled .Das Problem der Soziologie, which is stated in the Kantian fashion, How is Society Possible?, the fundamental preliminary questions are examined. It is not the subject-matter of the inquiry, but purely and simply the formal mode of looking at the problems, that determines the direction and nature of sociology. It is the doctrine of reciprocal human rela- tions; its territory is an inter-individual territory. " We are here concerned with the microscopic-molecular processes within hu- man society, which constitute, however, the real events, that are bound together into macroscopic, fixed unities and systems. That men look upon one another and are jealous of one another, that they write letters to one another and share their midday meal, that apart from all tangible interests they are moved to sym- pathy or antipathy, that gratitude for an altruistic act furnishes irresistible stimulus to further acts, that one inquires the way of another, that men dress and adorn themselves, all these thousand relations, momentary or lasting, conscious or unconscious, trivial or important, thus cited at random, bind us unceasingly together." An extraordinary sense for relations, that characterizes Simmel, enables him to state and solve his problem from this standpoint. Little as Simmel is a dialectician, there is nevertheless an element in the rhythm of his thought, that challenges comparison with Hegel. By stripping concrete objects of their relations and forms, by turning exclusively to their logical character, form as such acquires the character of a creative world-power, that dominates the structure of all matter, but is not enthralled by matter. The doctrine of form becomes the doctrine of the cosmos itself; limit- less thought discovers its stuff and its goal within itself; it hovers sovereignly over all individual being, as its only meaning and value. Simmel's works also form in a certain sense a Phenom- enologie des Geistes, to be sure with the great difference that Sim-</page><page sequence="16">No. 5.] GERMAN PHILOSOPHY ZN 1908. 529 mel is no rationalist, that the world for him is not resolved into abstraction, that his forms are psychical rather than notional, and that consequently for him the irrational and plural character of being persists. This circumstance brings him into near relation with that group of psychologists and phenomenalists, to which we have now to turn our attention. It also makes him akin to Friedrich Nietzsche. As I explained in my former report, Kant's influence is not exhausted by the line of development from Fichte to Hegel. While these thinkers aim to deduce the system of pure knowl- edge a priori, by way of pure logic, an aim adopted also by the Neo-Kantians, Fries turns from the objective proof to the sub- jective, phenomenalistic derivation of the categories. Amongst his modern followers one may name as preeminent Leonard Nelson, the founder of the new Fries School. The fundamental principles which he takes over from his master, were discussed in such detail in my report of i908, that a mention will suffice here. Nelson has formulated his ideas in a book, Ueber das sogenannte Erkenntnisproblern,' which presents his theory on a broader basis, but nothing essentially new is added. He attempts again to prove the impossibility of epistemology, or, more properly speak- ing, of epistemological criticism. His chief purpose is to show that the critique of reason can be understood only in a psycho- logical sense, which differs from psychologism in that the cate- gories are not derived from inner experience, but only exhibited in it. I have repeatedly called attention to the connection between the new Fries School, on the one hand, and the phenomenolog- ical inquiries and theory of objects (Gegenstandstheorie) of such pure logicians as Husserl, Stumpf, and Meinong, on the other. The ideality of logical activity is acknowledged, but the method of its discovery is inner experience. In this connection I should like to mention Heinrich Gomperz's Noologie, the second volume of his Weltanschauunigslehre, thp first half of which, Einleitung und Semasiologie, appeared last year.2 Gomperz distinguishes here I G5ttingen, Vandenhoeck und Ruprecht. 2Jena, Diederichs, pp. 297.</page><page sequence="17">530 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XVIII. more sharply than in his Me/hodologie between the logical and psychological treatment of thought. The purpose of the Noologie is to overcome the contradictions that arise from this two-fold objective and subjective mode of treatment. Its field is, therefore, limited. In the first place, uni- formity in the temporal process of the psychical is eliminated, be- cause this has no immediate points of content with logic. " And so one may say in general," Gomperz writes, " that No6logy has to do with the static view of thinking consciousness, the phenom- enological description of the intellectual psychical life, or in short, with classificatory investigation into the psychology of thought; for differences in objective thought correspond merely with the several kinds of thinking consciousness, without regard to the temporal aspects or conditions of their concrete realization." One sees that this field coincides, at least partially, with what Husserl calls phenomenology. Along with this classification of thoughts into subjective and objective, one may examine them with refer- ence to their meaning and validity. The Semasiologie contains the theory of meaning. Within the problem of meaning, there arise on the boundary between logic and psychology, four main questions, which Gomperz answers in terms of his " pathempiri- cal " method. Also an exhaustive historical development of the meaning-problem in Nominalism, Realism, and Rationalism is presented by the author, and he attempts in his explanation to reconcile the opposition in these extreme points of view. The work of the well-known thinker, Eugen Heinrich Schmitt, entitled Kritik der Philosophie,l falls apparently outside the range of our discussion up to this point, for, as the title indicates, it goes back to the presuppositions of philosophy in general, and aims to uproot them. One would, however, be quite mistaken, if one were to suppose that this were due to sceptical or positi- vistic motives, as in the case of Avenarius or Mach. It is rather mystical or gnostic points of view that determine Schmitt, the author of a work in two volumes, Die Gnosis. The fundamental error of philosophy, in Schmitt's opinion, lies in the fact that it has attempted from the start to explain knowledge in a one-sided I Leipzig, Eckardt, pp. 507.</page><page sequence="18">No. 5.] GERMAN PHILOSOPHY IN 1908. 531 way, as conditioned by the knowledge of nature, the knowledge of the outer world, and so has regarded it as an imitation, a copy of external reality. It is, therefore, closed to an understanding of the most valuable realm, the inner world, by regarding this as a copy of another reality and not as immediate reality. But here the distinction between phenomenon and reality is destroyed; the knowledge of the inner world is intuitive knowledge. There is, therefore, no opposition between illusion and truth. The in- finite that appears in man's inner self, is the most immediate and assured notion of which he can be conscious. Schmitt does not put this idea forth in an aphoristic way; he attempts to establish it by a careful analysis of human consciousness. He sketches a picture of its structure, of its rising to constantly higher dimen- sional altitudes from punctual sensation to three dimensional images and the endless forms of conceptual thought. Schmitt's mode of treatment is also psychological and phenomenological, an empirical mode. What distinguishes him from the Fries direction is that he revives Schelling's doctrine of intellectual in- tuition, and believes that in inner experience itself one grasps immediately the absolute and infinite. At this point, the gnostic and romantic element in his thought comes to light. Again we see how the several movements of thought appear to pass over into each other, and there is need of constant analysis to keep clearly in mind the ultimate conditions of knowledge, in their interconnections and distinctions. The philosophical movement in Germany grows in ever widen- ing circles. The Heidelburg Congress has again proved that interest in philosophy is not confined to the academic world. It has shown that in the most varied disciplines, especially in the investigation of nature, there is need of philosophical elucidation, and that wider strata of population are seeking deeper explana- tions of the ultimate principles of existence. The practical, ethical desire for the redemptive power of a great philosophy is stronger than the theoretical stimulus. And so it happens that a thinker like Nietzsche, by the greatness and impressiveness of his personality, has exerted a deep influence, although his crea- tions fall for the most part outside the realm of general discussion.</page><page sequence="19">532 TEE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XVIII. This affective impulse, this spiritual longing, is incalculably im- portant for the renaissance of philosophy, because the most inward stimulus to a comprehensive system is never merely theoretical. One of the most significant signs of the increasing influence of philosophical ideas is the large number of new editions of the works of great thinkers prepared for the public. In the first rank stands the publishing house of Dfirr in Leipzig, whose Philosophische Bibliothek represents a substantial collection of old and new works. Amongst them may be named Rene Des- cartes's Meditationen (vol. 27), translated by Buchanau, and ac- companied by a commentary; David Hume, Eine Untersuchung fiber den menschlichen Verstand, edited by Raoul Richter (vol. 35); Immanuel Kant, Kleinere Sclhriften zur Logik und Meta- physik, edited with an introduction by Vorlinder (vol. 46); Spinoza, Theologisch-Politischer Traktat, Abhandlung fiber die Verbesserung des Verstandes, Abhandlung vam Staate, translated with an introduction by Gebhardt (vols. 93, 95); Schleier- macher, Weinachtsfeier, with introduction and register by Mulert (vol. II 7). All of the volumes are sold at low prices, and are admirably edited. In addition to the foregoing, the following are also published in this collection: Vorlknder's instructive and extraordinary Geschichte der Philosophie in two volumes, Witasek's Grundlinien der Psychologie, which, after an introduc- tion on general preliminary problems, is divided into a psychology of intellect and psychology of feeling; Kirchner's Worterbuch der philosophiscizen Grundbegriffe, revised by Michaelis. Further, the collection of historical monographs on philosoph- ical concepts, planned by Winter in Heidelberg under the title of Synthesis, is a response to the growing interest in the principles of philosophical thought and their historical development. Of the collection, one monograph has been published, Julius Bau- mann's Der Wissensbegrff (pp, vi, 229), and others are in prep- aration by Windelband, Rehmke, Ziegler, Joel, St6hr, Menzer, Kiilpe, Drews, Vossler, BKumker, Bauch, Kabitz, H6nigswald, and Ewald. To the G6schen series a new volume has been added, viz., Bruno Bauch's Geschichte der Philosophie, covering more particu-</page><page sequence="20">No. 5.] GERMAN PHILOSOPHY IN 1908. 533 larly modern philosophy to Kant. The work combines the great advantages of a popular exposition, with rigid exactitude and the complete mastery of the present state of historical criticism and sources. Its arrangement of the subject-matter is at once clear and exhaustive. The five divisions are as follows: The period of the philosophy of morality and religion; the speculative-dog- matic philosophy of nature; philosophy dominated by rational- ism; philosophy dominated by empiricism; the philosophy of nature based on exact investigation. The brief exposition would serve admirably as an introduction to the philosophical problems of our time. The most tangible expression of the current struggle for philo- sophical insight continues to be found in neo-romanticism. Its centre is the publishing house of Diederichs in Jena, whose ac- tivity was described in detail in my last report. Lately the Leip- zig publisher, Eckardt, has issued works of importance to neo- romanticism. His selections from Schelling, mentioned last year, deserve the highest praise. Similar selections from the writings of Fichte and Hegel are in preparation. A series of interesting books is published by Diederichs, which in part go beyond romanticism back to classical antiquity. Die Vorsokra/iker, published in selections by Nestle, and Preisendanz's translations of Plato's Gorgias and Menon belong here. To the field of romanticism belong Steffen's " Lebenserinnerungen aus dem Kreise der Romnantik," published in selections by Gundelfinger; Schelling's SchOpferisches Handeln, edited with an introduction by Emil Fuchs; Rousseau's Kulturideale collected by Spranger. The two books, last named, present an epitome of the chief doc- trines of Schelling and Rousseau. Last year, writings occasioned by Darwin's centennial offered proof, even in this field, of the growth of idealism. Biological naturalism has lost ground both in epistemology and ethics. This comes clearly to view in Max Stirner's work, Die Leire Darwins in ihren letzten Folgen,1 a second edition of which was quickly called for. The work is to be recommended to the at- tention of everyone interested in philosophical and moral prob- 'Berlin, Hofmann and Co., pp. vi, 244.</page><page sequence="21">534 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XVIII. lems, especially to persons vacillating between naturalism and idealism. It offers a rigid demonstration that a genuinely human ethics cannot be based on the postulates of the theory of selection, and that the principle of the struggle for existence can establish only the brute morality of might. Stirner shows with logical care that wherever ethical ideas are developed from naturalistic postu- lates, contradictions and arbitrariness are involved. And so one may regard this book as an indirect support of idealism. The essence of neo-romanticism, viewed in this connection, appears to me to be in a transitional stage. It is characteristic of romanticism, that it represents a starting point rather than a con- clusion. Whenever a new field of spiritual life is disclosed, or hidden possibilities are revealed to the astonished gaze, they are at first experienced as strange and alien, characteristics which the fancy readily converts into the notion of the romantic. The business of philosophers and artists, however, is not to stop here, or indeed to heighten artificially the charm of the unknown, but to translate the unconscious into terms of consciousness, and to clarify the obscure. Therefore, real romanticism leads of itself to that synthesis of idealism and realism, which is the essential mark of classical art and philosophy. We must, con- sequently, expect that neo-romanticism will become crystallized into more complete and noble forms, will not sink into formless pseudo-mysticism, but on the contrary, survive in the transforma- tion and clarification of the mysterious and uncomprehended. Joel writes in his dialogical work, Der free Wille l "I see in classicism merely romanticism formed and comprehended, re- duced to determinations and thereby transcended. For roman- ticism lives in the undetermined, in the endless overstepping of boundaries, in the endless overcoming of the fixed, in endless flux, mutation, and variation." These sentences are found in a book, which one may regard, to a great extent, as an attempt to adopt the full import of romanticism, and by that very fact inwardly to overcome it. It is a, book, rich in matter, impressive, almost passionate, which the distinguished thinker of Basle wrote, not so much as an abstract formulation of a system of philosophy, 1lMUnchen, Bruckmann, pp. xvii, 724.</page><page sequence="22">No. 5.] GERMAN P1/ILOSOPHY IN i908. 535 as a personal expression of his own inner life. The mechanism of nature is to be understood in its mere relativity, which, far from en- slaving organic and conscious life, is dominated by it. Freedom rises above mechanical necessity, but freedom is not the highest word in the romantic vocabulary; on the contrary, it is subordinate to a still higher ethical and ideal necessity. Schelling, the phi- losopher of romanticism, attempted a reconciliation between free- dom and necessity. Goethe, the artist, who completed the transi- tion from romanticism to classicism, realized this reconciliation in his work and life. We may, therefore, expect that neo-romanti- cism will break away from its one-sided subjectivism and recognize freedom as the efflux of conformity to a higher law; that it will surmount its arbitrariness in seeing and fashioning, and will rise above the vacillating sport of idealizing fancy to a new all- comprehending reality.
