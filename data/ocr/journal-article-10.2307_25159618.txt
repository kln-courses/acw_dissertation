<plain_text><page sequence="1">Serpents, Sages, and Sorcerers in Cleveland A quarter century ago Mrs. Albert S. Ingalls presented to the Cleveland Museum a fragmentary Nepali painting on cloth (Figures 1, 2 on overleaf, and 13-18).1 Worn and no longer an arresting object of art, the new acquisition entered the Museum's study collection. When Stella Kramrisch as sembled her epochal exhibition of Nepali art for Asia House in 1964, she included it in her catalog. On the basis of some of the scenes, she entitled it Tirtha Mahdtmya, a name signifying "eminent places of pilgrimage." This was the first scholarly attention to the painting, and apparently the last until 1974 when I asked to examine it. It was at once evident that the Cleveland painting was in complete and pertained to a horizontal banner, a cloth scroll such as those occasionally exhibited in the Kathmandu Valley today. Among existing examples, the majority are on Buddhist themes, as is the Cleveland scroll. Thus normally they are only seen in the onetime monasteries, still called vihdras, when they are strung around the open courtyards for a few prescribed days each year (Figures 3 and 4). For the most part, as in the Cleveland fragment, the banners are of narrative intent. The story is related in successive vignettes arranged in two or more superimposed registers, regarded from left to right, top to bot tom. The individual scenes, each conceived as miniatures, are usually separated by clumps of trees or similar artifice, the horizontal registers by narrow bands of floral decoration or, more often, by ribbons of explanatory captions lettered in gold on black. Such banner paintings continue a long tradition familiar in India from at least Mauryan times, ca. 322 to 183 BC. Itinerant showmen, such as the yamapatika described later in Bana's Harsacarita, carried the rolled paintings from town to town where they served both to amuse and instruct the populace,2 even as they do in the Kathmandu viharas today. In ancient India such painted scrolls were apparently also sometimes strung across the gateways leading into the towns or on the ceremonial archways (toranas) erected in front of religious structures. Indeed, on the famous toranas of the Great Stupa of Snichi, it is these very banners (their ends rolled up) that appear to have been translated into stone (Figure 5). In India narrative painting also made its way onto the walls of private and public buildings, creating veritable art galleries referred to as painted rooms (chitrasalds).3 In Nepal certain rooms of palaces and mansions continued to be painted in this way into the nineteenth century (Figures 6 and 7).4 So also were Nepali monastery and temple walls.

Apparently influenced by the tradition of scroll painting, the manuscripts were similarly painted in successive scenes ar ranged in a number of superimposed registers (Figure 9).7 The Cleveland scroll, continuing as it does a long tradition in the history of Indian and Nepali painting, is of profound interest on quite another level, however. When whole, it sum marized in picture and caption one of the most intriguing legends in the legend-filled valley of Kathmandu. Both an oral tradition and consecrated in certain Buddhist texts, the legend consists of myriad threads raveled from a complex tapestry of history, religion, folklore, and more. Unlike many myths and fairy tales, however, the Nepali legend is not only concerned with gods, demigods, and events in imaginary realms, but also with historical personages and existing places. Moreover, it is a living legend made tangible in customs which concern the Nenalis and their gods even now. Of particular sienifi the Nenalis and their Rods even now.

A world where Mahisiddhas, the Great Perfected Ones, empowered by their hard won magical skills, controlled the very gods themselves and were the preferred counselors of kings. A world wherein the valley's holy serpents spoke and sometimes took the form of men, and where men betimes, in turn, took theirs. A world, however, not of such marvels alone but a marvelously creative one in which, under the nimble fingers of men, the gods took visible form in bronze and paint.

Whole colonies of Newars-as the principal Nepal, or Kathmandu Valley, inhabitants were then known-settled in Lhasa and other trading centers. They dealt in varied goods, not the least of which were the objects made in Nepal to serve the Buddhist faith. It was at this same time that Tibet, for centuries the recipient of Nepali influences in art and Bud dhism, began in turn to exercise a cultural influence on Nepal. To this the Cleveland banner bears ample testimony; for example, the stupas observed in the painting are not the Nepali hemispheres one would expect to find in a Nepali painting, but typical Tibetan chdrtens looking rather like up turned wineglasses. It is the Tibetans, too, who have contri buted the clouds, the horses, the style of the figures, and the distinctive headgear, textured fabrics, and fluttering scarves they wear. Nepali painters when not so influenced preferred figures in the Rajput style then popular in court circles, the familiar dress of Rajasthani and Pahari paintings. It is worn by the donors of the Preaching Buddha, by the king and musicians below, and by the same king illustrated elsewhere (Figures 11, 12, and 23). But despite the obvious Tibetanization of the banner frag ment. much is Nepali. The temples and shrines with upswept Figure 12. Detail of Figure 11 showing the third scene, bottom left, where the donors included a portrait of King Pratapa Malla, whose subjects they were. "pagoda" roofs are purely so. Nepali also is the treatment of the homa (a rite in which precious goods are sacrificed in flames), and unmistakably Nepali are the Hindu gods and Sivalingas included in a painting meant to be on Buddhist themes. Only in the Kathmandu Valley do Buddhism and Brahmanism, the stupa and the linga, exist side by side on such congenial terms. From Nepal also comes the language and script of the captions, the Newari of her traders.ll The synthetic character of the painting suggests that it may have been commissioned by one of them domiciled in Tibet, a well established custom at that time. But whether the painter was a Tibetan or a Nepali, he borrowed freely from both traditions to tell a Buddhist story dear to Nepal. The subject matter of the Cleveland scroll is drawn from the famous Nepalese Buddhist text known as the Svayambhu purdna [Traditional history of the deity Svayambhf]. This is a mahdtmya, a class of religious texts which both extols sacred sites and serves as a pilgrim's guide to them. The date of the Svayambhu-purdna is unknown, but it may have been redacted around the sixteenth century.12 Mythical in nature, it is ob viously a compilation of diverse materials long transmitted orally. Moreover, despite the text's apparently purely local nature-filled as it is with Nepali characters and places many of its legends may well have their roots in Central Asia. They seem to have come to Nepal by way of Khotan, a country with a parallel cycle of legends.13 As the title implies, the prin cipal thrust of the Svayambhu-purdna concerns the primordial Buddha-Svayambhu, the Self-Created or Self-Existent, a renowned deity of Nepal whose history and traditions it pur ports to tell. But in keeping with the mahatmya genre, it in cludes brief references to many other sacred places of less esteem in the Kathmandu Valley. A number of them are Brahmanical which, with typical Nepali eclecticism, it is con sidered fitting to include in an ostensibly Buddhist text. The majority of the secondary sites which the Svayambhu purdna extols are located on the banks of the Bagmati, the valley's chief river, or its affluents. One of these is the Vish numati or, as Buddhists prefer, the Keshavati, reminder of its miraculous origin in the hair (kesa) of the tonsured monks. As tributary to the Ganges, the Bagmati and its affluents share in that sacred river's mystique. Like it, the Nepali rivers have miraculous origins-differing in accordance with whether one is Hindu or Buddhist-and most bear the name of the gods. In their beds courses that divine substance, water, life-giving and life-sustaining. It pertains to a cosmic network, terrestrial, 72</page><page sequence="7">r~"under worship at Sankara-tirtha (top); 051 A ~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~unidentified riverine ~-? *:iiii:? ~ *~~~~,,~~~~~~~gods their devotees and an enshrined Sivalinga (center); Nidhanaka-tirtha as a spouting fountain ,? vis- avis a copiously ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~'.~ lustrated linga (bottom) ( Detailof Figure .2: A3, 9, 10, 13, 14). :r?:'.a~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~' '*:i ':'~;' Sankhapfila-nfiga :s? ;k" ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~under worship at i. ~~~~~~~III ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~~??i,. ~~~~~~~~Sankara-tirtha (top)' r: +I? .s ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~unidentified riverine .i ~ ~~~~~~~~~gods, their devotees, and an enshrined ~J~:~~i~-~~~~s~; ~E~~:l~;~efC~gsllss - Il~l~i~l !i' Sivalinga (center); N~dhfinaka-t~rtha as a spouting fountain :,....ff i-~-~t,~ vis-fi-vis a copiously Pf ~~~~~~~~lustrated linga (bottom) (Figure 2' A3, 9, 10, 13, 14).

It is also the substance of ponds and wells, issues from the fountains, and fills the sacred jar-the purna kaldsa. Water is also the preferred abode of the serpents, one of whose primary symbols they are, beings of profound veneration in Nepal. Beaded along the Nepali river banks, therefore, are countless eminent places of pilgrimage, the tirthas, which beckon the faithful, Hindu and Buddhist, to prayer and penance. Pilgrimage to them to bathe in their waters and worship their presiding deities is held to confer untold merit in this life and the next. It is one of the most com pelling of Nepali religious urges. Among the scores of riverine tirthas in the Kathmandu Valley, the Svayambhu-purdna extols the virtues of relatively few. They are grouped into two formal sets, twelve of primary and twelve of secondary importance. To these are added a few lakes, pools, or waterfalls in which bathing is also meritorious. Although it is the Buddha himself who enumerates these tirthas, they are neither Buddhist nor Hindu but are in charge of the serpents worshiped by all. The Buddha also lists eight other significant places of worship, Sivalingas which in the Buddhist tradition owe their origin to Svayambhu. Like the other tirthas, they are therefore non-sectarian. A number of them are also situated near streams or ponds. The painted version of the Svayambhu-purdna conserved in Cleveland consists of two registers framed by narrow plain bands and divided by another bearing a few inscriptions. The latter, together with captions inscribed directly on the illus trated fields, are somewhat effaced and cannot be fully de ciphered.14 The subject matter of the two registers is nonethe less clearly defined: the lower one is devoted exclusively to Svayambhu, the upper one to a number of the riverine tirthas and some of the Sivalingas. Indeed, the painting in effect serves them as an illustrated guide. More than a dozen riverine tirthas and four of the Sivalingas are illustrated in the upper register of the Cleveland scroll. Together they apparently represent more than half of the original painted complement since successive numbers in the inscribed band below begin with the figure four.15 As in the Svayambhu-purdna, each illustrated tirtha is characteristically situated at a confluence (veni, dobhdna), a mingling of waters conceived to augment the tirtha's virtue. Many are identified by captions which name the tirtha, the streams which sanctify it, and the deity who presides over it. Of the identifiable tirthas, more than half correspond essentially to those which comprise 73</page><page sequence="8">'A V I ..:.... :!:: :: Figure 14. Detail of Figure 1 .

Others do not figure in the Svayambhui-purdna at all and must represent the preference of the painter or his client (Figure 2: Al, 2, 16). In the painting, each tirtha is distinguished by a field of color, often contained by the meeting streams. In each field is a group of seated figures, one of whom is the tirtha's presiding deity. He is a serpent (naga) in anthropomorphic form, seated in royal ease, his consort by his side. Behind the naga and nagini, serving both as prabhdmandala and throne, are their alter egos in polycephalous serpent form. The nagas are dis tinctively colored and often named, in keeping with Nepali folklore. Some belong to a company of nine valley familiars and correspond to those that preside at the tirthas listed in the Svayambhu-purdna. Facing the naga pair and engaged in their worship are a number of persons, usually three. As at Sankara tirtha (Figures 2: A3; and 13), one of them is usually aureoled in gilt, while another, seated before a flaming brazier, a sacri ficial ladle (sruk, sruva) in hand, performs the homa. As identified by his headgear, this person appears to be a lama in some scenes, in others perhaps a crowned vajrdcdrya, the Vajrayana Buddhist Master of Absolute Power. Only a few of the tirthas clearly correspond to known sites frequented today. One exception, illustrated at the upper left corner of the painting, is the Mayuri-tirtha, depicted as the domain of Taksaka-naga, a serpent of valley renown (Figures 1; 2: Al; and 14).16 Another apparently represents the most famous Nepali riverine tirtha of all, a sacred place of many names (Figures 1 and 2: A16). One of them is Panchanadi (i.e., "five rivers") for the number held to meet there. Two of the five are the Bagmati and Vishnumati, three are mystic and invisible streams which secretly course from India. According to the caption, Vasuki-naga-one of the chief valley nine-is the presiding deity, but he is not illustrated. Near Panchanadi dwells the famous Bhairava of the south, Daksina Bhairava, as he is named in the painting, or Pacali Bhairava, his more familiar name today. A dread form of Siva, Bhairava is prominent in the painting as a seated corpulent figure aureoled in flames (Figures 1 and 2: A16). Immediately above him is a pond whose identifying caption is unfortunately effaced (Figure 2: A5). It may illustrate the Pond of Indra (Indradaha), a tirtha of continuing valley renown, or perhaps Taudaha, a pond of particular significance to the valley's serpents and to the legends which concern them. Indeed, their king, the Nagaraja Karkotaka, resides even now in a jeweled palace within its depths. 74</page><page sequence="9">'k" : . Figure 15. Detail of Figure 1.

Figure~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~" .i~..:,:,:.~j '-'~'.~.. .'Sae eieSaabusua udaSkauirltshshsoyt h osaddmgd Fgr : 5.~ In addition to the assemblies at the tirthas, the riverbanks are populated with other gods and demigods, and with Sivalingas, shrines, and temples, near which penitents bathe. But these gods and their devotees, interesting as they are, must not detain us from more intriguing matters illustrated in the register below. The primary legend among those intertwined in the Svay ambhii-purdna concerns the history of Svayambhu. Jataka like, it is explained to the other gods and demigods by the visiting Buddha Sakyamuni in one of whose former lives it began. At that time the Kathmandu Valley was filled with an immense lake, the Dwelling Place of the Serpents (Nagavasa) or Kal's Pond (Kalihrada), named for the serpent queen who dwelt therein. In the midst of this expanse, supported on a resplendent lotus, the primordial Buddha, the Self-Existent, Self-Created (Svayambhii), chose to manifest himself as a flame, or, as some say, an image of crystal. In time the Bodhisattva Mafijusri elected to drain the lake to make Svayambhfi-jyotirupa (Svayambhu-in-the-Form-of-Light) ac cessible to worship. Thoughtfully, he first transferred the Nagaraja Karkotaka, his queen Kall-nagini, their retinue and treasure to the pond of Taudaha. That done, he breached with his sword the enclosing valley rim through which the im pounded waters foamed away. With them glided some of the serpents, strangers to Karkotaka's court, but they later re turned to take up their abodes in the Bagmati and its tribu taries. Next Manijusricreated a city near Svayambhi-jyotirupa -the origin of Kathmandu-and peopled it with devotees. In time, as all Buddhists should, the Mahasiddha Santikara (or Santikaracarya) came to worship the renowned Svayambhu in-the-Form-of-Light. Through untold austerities this former king of a distant realm had become a Great Perfected One, half-sage, half-sorcerer, possessed of powers immeasurable. Thus, simply at his command, Visvakarma, the architect of the gods, enclosed Svayambhu, the flame, in a resplendent stupa. So originated the famous mound, premier beacon of valley Buddhism, raised for all to adore on a hilltop near Kathmandu. Although this legend provides the main theme of the Svayambhu-purdna, the painter of the Cleveland scroll barely alludes to it in some of the final scenes (Figures 1; 2: B14-15; and 15). Dispensing with the story altogether, he merely shows the Buddha Sakyamuni engaged in telling it to the gods and demigods. His auditors, as the inscriptions inform us, are "the monk Kasyapa, other monks, all the deities, the serpents, 75</page><page sequence="10">* '. . ?b:.? . ' .:i _ . , + .g? ;'. r - . ._:i. .... ?

The Buddha with Brahms on his right is depicted beside the stupa whose history he tells and on the opposite side are a very Nepali-looking Hanuman and Garuda. In the foreground are gathered the rest of the divine company, in curiously inattentive poses and each care fully identified by adjacent captions. In treating the main theme of the Svayambhu-purdna by means of this artifice, the painter cleverly reserved the rest of his canvas to a secondary legend of the Svayambhu-purdna which clearly interested him or his client far more. It is told in successive scenes, each defined as a geometric field of color (Figures 1 and 2: B1-13). Somewhat haphazardly arranged, together the colored squares and rectangles resemble a collage or a spread of slightly over lapping photos. In the Kathmandu Valley the successful raising of irrigated rice depends on the timely abundance of rain. Normally delivered in copious supply by the summer monsoon, the rains nonetheless sometimes arrive sufficiently late or in such scant supply as to entrain drought and famine, a threnody of Nepali history. Despite the apparent lushness of the Kath mandu Valley, drought is a real concern and the quest for rain an incessant preoccupation. It is little wonder, therefore, that in an essentially farming community some of the most im portant deities are rain givers and that so many customs and legends are rain related. So, indeed, are those which have come to be entangled in the Svayambhu myth. It is such a story which the painter of the Cleveland banner has chosen to tell. According to the popular legend, recounted in the Svay ambhu-purdna and embroidered in countless oral variants, there once fell upon the Kathmandu Valley a severe drought. The dry and crusted fields could not be planted and the ter rifying specter of famine loomed ahead. As the chief dispensers of rain, the nagas had all been properly worshiped and con stant were the pilgrimages to the tirthas where they dwelt. But despite the pleas of their devoted suppliants, the nagas obsti nately withheld their customary boon and no rains came. Even the prayers of King Gunakamadeva, the valley's compas sionate king, were of no avail. Realizing that in the face of impending calamity even kings were helpless, Gunakamadeva sought advice from the renowned Mahasiddha Santikara. This Santikara-among the contrivances which link the rain making legend to Svayambhii-was, to be sure, the same Santikara who had created the stupa. Now Mahasiddhas onetime kings and beggars, weavers and merchants, abbots 76</page><page sequence="11">Figure 16. Detail of Figure 1. Santikara, King Gunakamadeva, and the nagas, from the rainmaking legend (Figure 2: B1-3, 5, 6). and boatmen, persons of no matter what caste, class, or con dition-were those who through unimaginable efforts, physi cal and mental, had become Great Perfected Ones. They were in effect Great Magicians, tantric practitioners both sage and sorcerer, capable of performing extraordinary feats. They were thought to be able to fly, to see and hear over vast dis tances, to divine the most secret thoughts of others, and to know all things respecting the present, past, and future. They could live or die as they chose and be reborn when and how they pleased. And above all, they could command the gods themselves. Such was Ratnaraksita, a historical figure of the thirteenth century who lived for a while in Nepal. He had "encountered many yi-dams (tutelary divinities) face to face.... On one occasion he heard ... the music with which the Nagas and Asuras [demons] honour Avalokitesvara on his holy mountain.... He could impart knowledge through consecration and the ddkinTs came in person to receive the sacrificial cakes. He petrified a mad elephant by fixing his eyes in the appropriate glance...."17 Thus it is not surprising that Gunakamadeva should turn to a Mahasiddha for help. He was not deceived, for the omniscient Santikara, knowing full well at whose door to seek the arrested rains, immediately advised the king what to do. This is the subject of the first scene in the lower register of the existing part of the painting (Figures 1; 2: B1; and 16). It is Santikara who stands beside his creation, Svayambhu stupa, while Gunakamadeva, brandishing a sword, sets off on horse back to accomplish the task the Mahasiddha has set. If the nagas will not willingly give rain, as is their custom, Santikara has told the king, they must be coerced. Since even the gods are subservient to the Mahasiddhas, this Santikara will do. But first the king must assemble the nine principal serpents of his realm, many of whom preside over the tirthas depicted in the upper register of the painting. These nagas must be ranged in a mystic diagram, a mandala, so that Santikara can perform the tantric ritual known as ndga sddhana and through it pro cure the needed rain. To be effective, it is imperative that the exact number of nagas prescribed by the Great Magician be present. In due course, at the king's command, the required number of serpents assemble. All save one. This is the Nagaraja Karkotaka, who by his absence vitiates the mandala. Santikara therefore instructs the king by what magical means the recalci trant naga can be brought by force. This is probably the sub ject of the third scene in the painting, although the captions are illegible (Figures 1; 2: B3; and 16). In any event, the magic proves effective and in the next scene, as verified by the cap tions, we see the king laying hold of Karkotaka (Figures 1 and 2: B4). In the painting the mounted Gunakamadeva also seizes Vasuki-naga and brings him to Santikara; in the latter's presence, the captions affirm, the naga becomes a Siddha. This episode is pictured at the beginning of the first complete scene at the bottom of the painting (Figures 1; 2: B6; and 16). In the same scene are several of the other nagas assembled on Santikara's instruction. As at the tirthas above from which they have come, each naga, now without consort, is pictured in human form, each with serpent alter ego behind him. One of the naga assembly is the serpent king, Karkotaka, whom Santikara questions respecting the denied rains. Apparently no explanation is forthcoming, but since the mandala is now complete, Santikara proceeds with the naga sadhana. The serpents cannot withstand the powers of his mantras, and the released rains begin at once to drench the parched fields. To commemorate the event, the grateful King Gunakamadeva (or alternately Santikara) establishes beside Svayambhu a shrine known as Nagapura, "the mansion of the serpents." These events, the falling rain and the commemora tive shrine, are the subject of the vertical scene following the assembly of nagas (Figures 1 and 2: B7). The clever Santikara, however, has not quite finished with the nagas. Divining that the serpents might again capriciously withhold the rains, he refuses to release them until each has donated a little blood.18 With it he reconstructs the serpent mandala on cloth, in a manuscript, or both, after which he dismisses the nagas to their rivers and ponds. By means of the substitute mandala, he instructs the king, the serpents can be made to yield if at some future time they again withhold the rains. Against this eventuality, the mandala is carefully stored in Nagapura. In both text and the illustrated account of the Svayambhu purdna, the rainmaking legend closes with the abdication of Gunakamadeva in favor of monkhood and the installation of his successor, Narendradeva. Gunakamadeva's choice is a joyous one, and he departs with an escort of musicians (Figures 1; 2: B8; and 17). In the scene immediately above, the new king Narendradeva is introduced, seated on a dais in company with three ministers (Figure 2: B9 and 17). Below, we see his abhiseka, the ceremonial lustration by which king ship is confirmed (Figures 1; 2: Bll; and 17). It is accom plished by attendants who from auspicious vessels (purna kaldsa) shower him with that most precious and consecrating substance, water (Figure 18). In the painting the legend closes 77</page><page sequence="12">H~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~?...^'-:_.... ^.~~~~~~:'.:: .::. ,:......... :..~-~ :: : .: ,, ...........................:: ,d~ ~ ~ ~~~~. , ? k???.. .,... -:. .rc?"nit ? i~'l"4F~?:'{ i ...

In the legends of the Svayambhu-purdna, as with all Kath mandu Valley legends, only a tenuous line separates fact and fancy; for example, the geologists have now shown us that the valley soils are in fact of lacustrine origin and the subaqueous gases and flaming waters that characterize valley legend are a reality even now. The miraculous origin of Svayambhii stupa, however, is tempered with the almost certain knowledge that it was constructed in the fifth century AD by a Buddhist king.19 But then again, in favor of factual threads, there were three Nepali kings named Gunakamadeva, the dates of whose reigns and some of whose deeds are reasonably well fixed. Narendradeva also is a well-authenticated king of seventh century Nepal; his name is inextricably linked with the nagas and with the rainmaker par excellence, Rato Matsyendra natha, at once Mahasiddha and Bodhisattva. Moreover, in one instance at least, we know exactly when legend leaves off and history begins. It happened less than a quarter-century after the painter of the Cleveland banner dried his brushes on a spring day in 1635. 78</page><page sequence="13">Figure 17. Detail of Figure 1. Gunakamadeva's jubilant departure to become a monk (Figure 2: B8), the installation of his successor (Figure 2: B9-1 1), and Santikara preaching (Figure 2: B12). In that year Laksmi Narasimha Malla still wore the crown of the Kingdom of Kathmandu, one of three citystates into which the larger kingdom had splintered by that time. Although he wore the crown, he did not rule for he was quite mad. So much so, that in 1641 he was removed and his eighteen-year-old son Pratapa Malla placed upon the throne.20 Pratapa Malla proved to be a remarkable king, one of the most brilliant and interesting, if licentious and boastful, of all the grand procession of Nepali monarchs. He considered him self a linguist, a poet, and master of all the arts of peace and war. Artists, poets, and dramatists were welcomed in the palace. His court teemed with astrologers and priests, both Buddhist and Brahman, and among them was many a tantric of renown. The king's deeds were numerous, and he took care to record them on copperplates and stone steles, on the statues and paintings he commissioned, and at the many temples and public works which bloomed at his command.21 Even pious works commissioned by others in his reign often included the king's name and sometimes his portrait as well. The donors of Cleveland's Bejeweled Buddha Preaching, for example-a Kathmandu family who lived not far from the palace-recorded that it was painted "during the reign of the King of Kings, the Illustrious Pratapa Malla" and saw to it that his portrait occupied one of the border vignettes (Figures 11 and 12). It is quite possible that it is there because the king attended the consecration of the painting. From Pratapa Malla's reign, which ended in 1674, inscriptions abound. None perhaps is more interesting than the one he installed near Svayambhu stupa in the shrine known as Santipura. Santipura, the mansion of Santikara, is a mysterious place now guarded by locked doors and defended by fierce divinities of the Buddhist faith. Santipura originated as Santikara's dwelling place, so it is claimed, a cave excavated in the shadow of the stupa he had miraculously created. It is one of five mansions (pura), a set of renowned tantric shrines arranged around the stupa. Another of the set is Nagapura, a hypae thral shrine which lies between the two. This is the shrine which the Svayambhu-purdna affirms was built by Gunakama deva to honor the serpents and to house the rainmaking mandala inscribed in their blood. But Pratapa Malla believed, as most Nepalis do, that the mandala was in fact stored in Santipura where its owner, the Mahasiddha, had secreted it. In the seventeenth year of Pratapa Malla's reign, so the king recorded by Santipura's door on a stone stele, a merci less drought gripped the kingdom.22 As in Gunakama deva's time, the parched fields again could not be planted and the terrifying specter of famine stalked abroad. Even the pleas of the king, addressed with proper munificence to the most prestigious of the valley gods, went unanswered. Pratapa Malla therefore declared that the time had come to seek the serpent mandala whose need Santikara had long ago foreseen. Addressing himself to the vajrdcdryas, the Buddhist priests in charge of Santipura, the king bade them to go in search of the rainmaking charm stored within. Paralyzed by fear before Santipura's mysteries, the priests were unable to comply. Undaunted, the king determined to seek the charm himself. Entering the cave, he found it to be arranged in twenty-seven rooms in one of which he found the coveted rainmaking charm. In the Svayambhu-purdna the charm is a banner bear ing the blood-inscribed serpent mandala. But there are mani fold ramifications of the same rainmaking legend-one of which, The Twelve-Year Well, concerns a rainmaking tantra inscribed in serpent's blood by Santikara.23 In writing of his adventures, the king must have been influenced by this famous story, involving a number of places in his own realm. Thus he found not one charm in Santipura, but two, paubha and tantra. Returning with them to the light of day, the rains at once fell and joy again filled the land. Like Gunakamadeva's rainmaking adventures, those of Pratapa Malla are also memorialized in a painting (Figure 19). Prepared in water colors on a thick, handmade multi layered paper, the painting is a folkish one, purely Nepali in style. In the casual possession of a Kathmandu family, the unprotected painting is now ragged and torn, and parts of it have quite crumbled away. It purports to illustrate the interior of the mysterious Santipura and, aided by Newari captions, the king's adventures within. At top and bottom of the paint ing are two long inscriptions.24 One, in Sanskrit, duplicates the Santipura stele in which the king compresses his rain making adventures into a few verses. They follow the self-styled "King of Poet's" hymn to the gods, one of whom is Samvara, a fierce deity of tantric Buddhism. The other inscription, in Newari, enlarges upon the rainmaking quest, supplying many picturesque details that are lacking in the stone inscription. Because of the outrageously laudatory character of the king's titles (prasasti) which preface the Newari inscription, it is likely that the painting was prepared at the king's direction and dates from his reign. The only date on the painting, how ever, is the one concluding the facsimile stone inscription, viz., N.S. 778 (AD 1658). The compositional scheme of the painting of Santipura is very odd indeed. It is conceived in two adjacent sections, the 79</page><page sequence="14">...l~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~..... ....... it . .. . ...... . .. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ::?i-.. ?l.?ii~~: :i ii~ii:'?:ii.~~iiiiliii e i ii ::i..ii?~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. .... :: ::::::l::::ji;~~~~~~~~. . ....... gg ;;U;" 2 :;:..:: ?':?:::~~~~~~~~~~~..........

The king's adventures commence in the lower left corner of the painting, as viewed in Figure 19. There we see the audacious king, lamp in hand, preparing to enter Santipura. He carries with him, so the captions affirm, "fish, lentils, cow-milk, and other articles of worship." The door through which the king is about to step leads into a rectangular room, identified as "three rooms of the southern part con verted into one." Behind it lie six square rooms. In these, which compose the first of three levels, the king does not tarry but descends by a stone staircase to the middle level. Here he finds nine rooms; in the central one of which is illustrated a lotus mandala flanked by a lamp and other sacred parapher nalia. There the king met Mahasamvara, whom he worshiped, and found "concealed in a copper milk pail" a copy of the Samvara-tantra. Up to this point, the inscriptions inform us, Santipura's guardian priests-vajrdcdryas from Svay ambhu and Makhan-bahal, a Kathmandu vihara-have ac companied the king. But the second level, which they believed to be the end of the cave, is their customary halting place. Thus, they go no farther. By turning the painting upside down, we can view the third level to which by a broad staircase the king alone de scends. Again there are nine rooms, only four of which remain whole in the damaged painting. The stairway opens directly into a room occupied by three enormous butterflies whose flapping wings extinguish the king's lamp. He pushes on, nonetheless, into the next room. It is inhabited by terrifying spirits, illustrated by four creatures symbolizing rdksasa, bhita, preta, and pisdca. They cause the monarch no trouble for the clever king by providing himself with foods for the hungry spirits (the "fish, lentils, and cow-milk") is able to pacify them. Continuing his explorations, the king encounters nagas in another room (now missing) and in still another Santikara himself. Seated in meditation (samddhi), Santikara is pictured as a dessicated anchorite since "only his bones and spirit remain." Beside him is shown the paubha, the rain making charm and object of the king's quest. Now Pratapa Malla can go no farther. His way is blocked by an under ground pool. It can only be seen by means of a small hole, illustrated at the upper edge of the pond, through which "a cool breeze came." Here the king seats himself in samadhi, contemplating his companionable lamp, inexplicably re lighted, and "meditates and inspects everything before com pleting his task and returning" (Figure 19). 80</page><page sequence="15">Figure 19. A reconstruction of Santipura, in whose chambers lay the rainmaking charm. Opaque water colors on multi-layered paper. 17th century. Private collection, Kathmandu. According to Pratapa Malla's account, there were twenty seven rooms in Santipura. In the illustrated version, when whole, they were divided by levels into three sets of nine each, counting the "converted" foyer as three.25 Given this particu lar number, or sets of numbers, it is evident that the rooms are nothing more or less thanpadas, the units by which the ancient Indian architectural manuals, the vdstu-sdstras, organized terrestrial space in harmony with the cosmos.26 Optimally, towns and cities were to be laid out in a grid of padas, the most auspicious number of which was eighty-one, i.e., nine sets of nine. Such grids were in effect "mandalas to walk on," mystic diagrams in which everything had its ordained place in the cosmos. In capital cities, for example, the palace and its chief object, the divine king, occupied the central pada, the most auspicious point of the mandala. Thus the three levels of Santipura are also mystic diagrams, mandalas of nine padas each and together one-third of the most auspicious number possible. At the heart of one, moreover, reigned Samvara and in another, Santikara and the serpent mandala. The auspicious and mystic number nine also explains why Santikara insisted that Gunakamadeva assemble exactly nine serpents for the original rainmaking mandala. Viewed from the perspective of the twentieth century, it is difficult to judge the historicity of Pratapa Malla's adventure. It is obvious that much of it is directly inspired by the Svay ambhu-purdna in which many parallels may be demonstrated. It is a text the king must have often read or heard from his Buddhist councilors and illustrated versions of which he must have seen. It is not at all improbable that as a prince, and later as king, he was familiar with the Cleveland scroll, then perhaps yearly displayed in some vihara in the Kathmandu realm. However, many of the picturesque details of Pratapa Malla's quest are unique to the later accounts and must be sought out side the Svayambhu-purdna. Perhaps they only existed in the fertile imagination of the vainglorious king, but in his favor is the date recorded for the event. It occurred on the fourteenth day of the waning moon of Asadha, Nepal Samvat 778, viz., late June 1658. Since the monsoon rains on which the valley's rice culture depend normally commence in April or May, the date would be quite consonant with a delay in its normal onset. Thus that year there may have been good reason to coerce the inconstant nagas. What the king actually did in the three hours he is alleged to have been in Santipura, or what the terrifying noises were that reached the safely waiting priests and courtiers without, are beyond conjecture. The folk tradition, however, affirms that the quest was made in the way the king described, that the drought was ended because of it, and that the wonder-working charms were afterwards re stored to Santikara's care within. When again the capricious nagas withhold their boon, who will have Pratapa Malla's audacity to seek the paubha and the tantra in Santipura remains to be seen. MARY SHEPHERD SLUSSER Mary S.

The paintings which have survived in the seventeenth-century palaces of the Malla Period (and some which had survived until destroyed in 1969 [Figure 6]), for the most part adhere closely to the banner scheme described above. The surviving nineteenth-century murals of the Shah Period palaces and mansions are somewhat more freely executed and often conceived on a larger scale. Examples of the later works may be seen in Deepak Shimkada, "Nepali Paintings and the Rajput Style," Arts of Asia, iv, no. 5 (1974), 38-43, figs. 5-7. In all instances, it may be noted, the Nepali murals are not frescoes, but the pigments are applied to dry plaster. 5. The reference is probably to the well-known Kinnarl Avaddna, a tale still popular in Nepal. The monastery stood near the Dhar madeva stupa in Chabahil village, a Kathmandu suburb (Dhana vajra Vajracharya, Licchavikalakd-abhilekha [Licchavi Period in scriptions], [Kathmandu, 1974], inscr. 1). 6. Although now in lamentable condition, the best example of exterior painting in this style is to be seen on the walls of the "Bagh Bhairab" (Vyagesvara) temple in Kirtipur village; a good example of interior painting survives in the Brahman! temple, Panauti village. 7.

The term thanka (and its variants), often applied to such paint ings, should properly be reserved to the Tibetan counterpart. It is a term unfamiliar in Nepal where the word paubhd or paubd is the preferred designation for all banner paintings, vertical or horizontal. I have also heard Newars refer to the latter as bilampo. 10. The era employed is the Nepal Samvat whose epoch year cor responds to AD 879/880. The month Caitra corresponds roughly to the last half of March and the first half of April. 11. Newari is a Tibeto-Burman language distinct from the national language, Nepali, whose roots are Sanskrit. There are various Newari scripts, affinals of Devanagari. Often they are closely related to those once current in nearby parts of India, as testified by many Indian manuscript pages in the Museum collection. The script used in the scroll was the one most commonly employed during the closing centuries of the Malla Period in the Kathmandu Valley, i.e., from the sixteenth century almost to the end of the eighteenth. 12. The word purdna signifies "belonging to ancient times," an "ancient tale," or "traditional history." It also refers to a class of sacred books of Hinduism, the Puranas, of which there are some eighteen principal ones. The Svayambhi-purdna, a tardy imitation of these texts, is thoroughly discussed by Sylvain Levi, Le Nepal, Etude historique d'un royaume Hindou, 3 vols., Annales du Musee Guimet, xvII-xix (Paris, 1905-1908), I, 207-213. An English sum mary of one Nepali edition may be found in Rajendralala Mitra, The Sanskrit Buddhist Literature of Nepal (reprinted, Calcutta, 1971), pp. 245-255. A classic published version, in Devanagari, is that edited by Hara Prasad Shastri, The Vrihat Svayambhu Purdnam (Calcutta, 1894). 13. J. Brough, "Legends of Khotan and Nepal," Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, XII, pt. 2 (1948), 333-339. As I have discussed in my Nepal Mandala (Princeton University Press forthcoming), other specific influences in Nepali culture can also apparently be traced to Central Asia, probably by way of Khotan. 14. Gautamvajra Vajracharya has kindly read for the Museum all the captions which he could decipher. It is probable that more in tensive study would improve the readings and permit us to identify the subjects of the painting more fully. 15. It is this number which suggests that Cleveland owns about half of the original banner. However, most banner paintings are much longer than the approximate eight or ten feet this would make the original. Thus the numbered tirthas may have been preceded by many other subjects of which we are ignorant. 16. The tirtha is named for Mahamayuir, chief of the Paficaraksas, the set of five Buddhist spell goddesses. The tirtha once lay on the banks of the Tukucha Khola, a stream whose course has altered, and the site is now sacred to Kaumari, one of the Hindu matrkas and a form of Durga. 17. David L. Snellgrove, Buddhist Himalaya (Oxford, 1957), pp. 105-106. 18. There is another version, among many, in which the sorcerer's rite is ineffective until the nagas themselves proffer their blood and instruct him in its use. 19. This dating is substantiated in Nepal Mandala. 20. Pratapa Malla's birth date is verified for Nepal Samvat 743 Jyestha (AD 1623). 21. One of the stone steles is in the Museum collection: CMA 78.24 Stele with Padmapani. Stone, H. 18-1/4 inches (46.4 cm.). Nepal, dated 1674. Gift of Claude de Marteau. 22. The inscription, in Sanskrit, is largely devoted to hymning the gods but concludes with a few verses concerned with bringing the drought to an end. It was first published in the original, with a Nepali translation of the concluding verses, in Samskrta-sandesa, i, no. 12 (Kathmandu, v.s. 2010 [1954]), 86-93. It is discussed at length by Gautamvajra Vajracharya, "Pratapa Mallako Santipura prabesa" [Pratapa Malla's entry into Santipura], Purnimd 4, I, no. 4 (Kathmandu, v.s. 2021 Magha [1965]), 31-44. 23. Like Nagapura and Sfntipura, The Twelve-Year Well, whose story I recount in Nepal Mandala, is not merely the stuff of legend. It exists in Kathmandu where it is cleaned with ordained regularity, lastly in 1969. Between times, whenever the nagas choose to deny the rains, with the permission of the King of Nepal, the valley farmers open the well. Into it, from Santikara's tantra they intone 108 hymns in praise of Karkotaka, king of the serpents, who comes to hear them in the cool depths below. 24. The painting is discussed and the captions and part of the inscriptions transcribed in Newari and Nepali by Vajracharya, "Pratapa Mallako Santipuraprabesa," pp. 37-44. According to the author (p. 34) there are other similar paintings, but I have not seen them. I am indebted to Vajracharya for arranging for me to study and photograph this example. 25. It is possible that the "converted" room in the painting cor responds to Santipura's enclosed rectangular foyer, also on the south side, which is open to the public. Passage beyond is today defended by a locked and guarded entry. The facade through which it passes is covered with nineteenth-century murals, arranged in the traditional superimposed registers. 26. On the Indian concepts of the organization of space see, for example, D. N. Shukla, Vdstu-sdstra, I, Hindu Science of Architec ture (Lucknow, 1960), or Binode Behari Dutt, Town Planning in Ancient India (Calcutta, 1925). 82</page></plain_text>
