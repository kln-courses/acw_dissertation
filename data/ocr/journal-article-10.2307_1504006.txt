Tiny art work crystallized the essence of romance even as it posed a challenge to the painter. Miniature books tickled the fancies of those who produced them -typesetters, printers, binders, and papermakers as well as art- ists. Just how small could these craftsmen cut matrices, evenly ink the minuscule sheets, and sew the boards? The artist who illustrated miniatures asked similar questions about the space available on which to create his drawings, cut his en- gravings, or etch his plates. From the last decades of the past century until the close of the Second World War, illustrators throughout the world devoted some of their efforts to producing artwork in a variety of books, each measuring less than three inches (75 mm) in size. The subjects of these microtomes were diverse-from detective fiction to travelogues, political diatribe to advertising calendars. Most of the illustrations were unsigned, executed by artisans who re- main undiscovered today. Still, there were noted artists who drew for these lit- tle volumes. Louis Wain's "stump books" were issued as oblong miniatures on heavy paper with stories of his characteristically humorous dogs and cats. Kate Greenaway's bonneted children appeared in her miniature Alphabet (fig. 2), and Thornton Burgess pictured his anthropomorphic mice and woodchucks in a series of eight miniature story books. The height of illustration in miniature books came early in this century. In 1923, Her Majesty Queen Mary commissioned leading designers and craftsmen to create a splendid dolls' house as a gift to the people of England. Permanently located at Windsor Castle, Queen Mary's Dolls' House is built on a scale of one inch to one foot. It includes a library of two hundred literary manuscripts, which are beautifully bound books, as well as seven hundred drawings and wa- tercolors by noted artists of the day. The work of Eric Gill, A.D. Rutherston, Arthur Rackham, both Paul andJohn Nash, William Rothenstein, Charles Gere, and others are included. Each was invited to produce original artwork for the Dolls' House by Her Highness Princess Marie Louise, who acted throughout as the tutelary spirit of the project. She sent to each artist, as well as to each invited author, a little blank book in which drawings could be executed or poems and stories could be written out by hand. Consequently, most of the books remain unique, except for the handful of early printed miniatures which the Queen chose to include. One of these was a copy of the smallest book in the world printed from movable type. The Mite (fig. 3) was issued as a curiosity in 1891 and again in 1893 by E.A. Robinson of Grimsby, England. It contains six wood 88 DAPAWinter 1988</page><page sequence="2">(butterfly) 33 x 17/is", 86 x 37 mm; (roses) 37/16 x 17/", 88 x 47 mm; (Aux Galeries Lafayette) 23/16 x 1", 56 x 35 mm; lower (clock) 23/W x 17/is", 56 x 37 mm; (Au B6be Rose) 2% x 15/s, 60 x 41 mm; (black/turquoise rose) 21/ x 17I/i", 54 x 36 mm.

Printed on twenty-eight pages and measuring 9/16ths by 7/6ths of an inch, it remained the smallest printed and illustrated book until a 1932 American edition of The Rose Garden of Omar Khayyam was published. While miniature publications played an entertaining role for royalty, miniature travel albums and mementos became part of the common man's library (fig. 4). Most European cities and resort areas were photographed and reduced to form miniature keepsakes. These little albums were usually issued as foldout strips enclosed either in a locket or in a more exotic casing. For example, disc shapes forming paper-embossed coins were a popular means of presenting photo- graphs of royal families and coronations as well as important political figures of the day. At the St. Louis World's Fair in 1904, a panorama showing all the buildings and pavilions of the exposition in a "nutshell" was enclosed in an ac- tual walnut shell. And a few years later, a grouping of "downeast" views of Maine was clammed-up in a scallop shell. There were also enameled and ster- ling silver miniature lockets containing pictures of the period, one of the rarest being five albumen prints from Maoriland, New Zealand.

Photography displayed in a miniature format was also used in a more terrifying way during the 1930s in Germany. Mini-booklets were issued to propagandize the Third Reich with all photographs by Hitler's official photographer, Heinrich Hoffman. They were published annually under the title Der Fiihrer Macht Geschichte (The Fuhrer makes history) (fig. 5). Each booklet showed Hitler giv- ing proclamations, greeting German citizens, reviewing the troops. Published by the Nazi government, these miniatures were distributed as receipts for donations to the "Winter Help" fund. Each measured two by one and one half inches and contained an equal amount of text and photographs. Besides the 90 DAPA Winter 1988</page><page sequence="4">*4 Fig. 4.

These focused on a specific subject, such as The Fuhrer and the Youth, The Fiihrer and his Homeland, and later, the Fuhrer in specific victories of war. As late as 1942-1943, a final group under the heading Helden Der Wehrmacht (Heroes of the armed forces) was issued by the German government. The ugliness of the Nazi kleinbuchs stands in stark contrast to the great beauty found in miniature almanacs and calendars. The earliest recorded small al- manac was printed at Trent in 1475, and the most famous series of almanacs were those issued by the London Company of Stationers. The Company held a monopoly on the printing of English miniature almanacs for over two hundred years, with the last example published in 1887. Thereafter, an overwhelming number of tiny calendars were disseminated in England and throughout Europe. Tiny almanacs were in vogue at the turn of the century, giving a new direction to advertising concerns. From perfumers and chocolatiers in France (fig. 1) to patent medicine and soap manufacturers in the United States, firms who wanted to advertise produced little illustrated almanacs as giveaways. The almanac itself was most often made of paper with glazed or colorfully em- bossed wrappers. The usual contents for European almanacs included a calen- dar for each month with a profusion of information on most given days. This included Christian holidays, birthdays of famous figures in history, eclipses of the sun and moon, and seasonal changes. The American counterparts were simply printed as calendars with no further information. DAPA Winter 1988 91 i.:- ..J.. ??1?; ;??-- ..?;. ??&lt;?t:?C ) "" .'-Fi ??? ??? ? ?: i:j.

One of the most elaborate European series of almanacs were those produced by Eugene Rimmel, "perfumers by appointment to all the courts of Europe"(fig. 6). These were issued during the latter part of the last century, and each year was devoted to a theme. No expense was spared in printing every page full color. Heroines of Italian poets adorned the pages of the 1873 almanac while romantic images of German poets were the illustrations for 1874. A charming American series which kept the notion of annual themes was the Colgate &amp; Company almanacs issued from about 1890 to 1910 (fig. 7). No credit was ever given to the illustrators in these calendars, but the drawings deserve mention. These period pictures portrayed ladies in long skirts powdering their noses and men with loosened suspenders at the wash bowl. The background decorations might be floral wallpapers or art nouveau ribbon wreaths. Ameri- ca's oldest and largest soapmakers and perfumers, not yet having produced their famous toothpaste, printed these two-inch almanacs entirely in color. Contemporary with Colgate, and daring for 1913, was the Warner's Corset calen- dar (fig. 7). "Every pair guaranteed to shape fashionably, to fit comfortably. There is a Warner Corset that will fit you, and give your figure the lines of present fashion." All this, plus seven revealing drawings, were yours in this diminutive almanac. In pre-World War Two Vienna, Carl Fromme produced a series of Rokoko-Kalendars (fig. 8). These were ornately florid in their decoration, typi- cal of the period and appropriate to their name. These relatively tall, thin little books are referred to as "finger-size" miniatures. In contrast to other almanacs of the day, the Fromme Kalendars were bound in deluxe covers. In fact, some of the most imaginative bindings in leather, suede, silver, and mother-of-pearl appeared on them. New York's Tiffany &amp; Co. also presented handsomely bound miniature almanacs from about 1910-1940. They were slightly larger in format with most measuring about three and a half inches tall. 92 DAPA Winter 1988 51 -??' . E ,,I.?F?' _ "</page><page sequence="6">65mm, 1874. To illustrate a book less than three inches in size continued to fascinate leading artists during the latter half of this century Joan Miro wrote and designed Une Hirondelle for PA. Benoit in Paris in 1954. Pablo Picasso was so taken with le liure minuscule that he executed three for Benoit. In 1955, thirty copies of Nuit were published, and again in 1960 Picasso illustrated Benoit's poem, Meurs Later that same year, he did four original engravings forJacqueline Rogue's Temperature. Erte was also fascinated with the miniature format, which is reflected in the forty-four cover maquettes he produced during the years 1932-1937 Only two of them were ever enlarged and reproduced for the covers of Harper's Bazaar. In 1984, a miniature book edition of Erte s inniature maquettes was published, and for the first time his elegant miniature art deco designs were presented to the public (fig. 9). the public (fig. 9).

Similarly, Rockwell Kent's twelve miniature wood engravings for his 1922 fairy tale titled The Golden Chain were seen in just eight copies until recently In 1986, an eight-year-old girl from Texas, with the assistance of Stanley Marcus (once a good friend of Kent's), obtained rights to reproduce the story and its il- lustrations in a miniature book. There are now two hundred copies of Kent's story and engravings in its original format. Mir6, Picasso, Erte, and Kent saw beauty and challenge in illustrating the small book. Not only do the blemishes (often inseparable from seeing things life-size) disappear in miniature, but also a closeness and fineness of texture 94 DAPA Winter 1988</page><page sequence="8">Fig. 9.

"The production of very small books has always taxed crafts- men to the extreme and compelled them to give of their very best under most difficult and challenging circumstances" (Louis Bondy, Miniature Books, London, 1981, p. 3). It is perhaps for this very reason that wonderful beauty can be achieved in such a small size and that miniature books are treasured by so many collectors the world over. Major university collections both in the United States and abroad feature miniature books. There are even societies of minia- ture book collectors which sponsor annual meetings where they may gather and exchange information. The seriousness of collectors and libraries has raised illustrations and typography of miniature books from the realm of juvenile curiosities to a richly deserved place of honor in the world of book illustration. o SELECT BIBLIOGRAPHY Benoit, PA.
