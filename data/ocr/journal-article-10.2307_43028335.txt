<plain_text><page sequence="1">Eric Gans (Los Angeles) ORIGIN ARY AND/OR KANTIAN AESTHETICS 1. Kant's Originary Aesthetic Because the origin of the transcendental within the world of immanence is the ultimate problem, not merely of philosophy/metaphysics, but of human thought as such, we are obliged to rely on an explicit or implicit hypothesis concerning this origin. That by far the most common of such hypotheses are religious in nature does not justify our dismissing them as putting off onto God a problem we cannot solve ourselves. The truth is the reverse: God is nothing more or less than the guarantee, whether anthropomorphic or not, of the origin of transcendence. What I call generative or originary anthropology is the "science" of this transcendence, that is, the mode of thought that constructs a hypothesis, as parsimonious as possible, of the emergence within the animal world of "horizontal" appetitive relations of the "vertical", transcendental relation- ship between representation and its repre sentamen , the minimal mode of which is that between the signifiant and signifié in Saussure' s terminology. This emergence is the origin of the human, defined as the mode of life that participates in transcendence - in its simplest state, inextricably that of re- ligion and that of linguistic signification.1 The minimal originary hypothesis is that the representation of reality by the sign emerges as an alternative to animal modes of averting violence when the equalizing force of mimetic desire within the collectivity becomes too great to be maintained within the pecking order of animal hierarchy. Designation by the sign, which preserves the object of desire qua sacred centrality from the conflicting appropriative desires of the participants, then emerges as an alternative to unmediated possession that permits the central object to be shared and peacefully exchanged by the nascent human com- munity while preserving for the community as a whole its sacred signifi- 1 For a fuller development of the ideas of generative anthropology, the reader may con- sult my Originary Thinking: The Elements of Generative Anthropology , Stanford 1993 and Signs of Paradox: Irony, Resentment, and Other Mimetic Structures , Stanford 1997, as well as the Anthropoetics website at www.anthropoetics.ucla.edu.</page><page sequence="2">336 Eric Gans canee. According to this hypothesis, what Kant calls the "moral law" that commands us to recognize each other's transcendental status with respect to the world is at the origin of the language in which we are able to think this law, as well as of all other cultural forms. It is also at the origin of what we call the aesthetic, in which our solitary experience of a given object, beauti- ful or sublime, arouses in us the same feeling of communal unanimity as the moral law in the ethical sphere. The aesthetic is most simply defined as the form of experience in which a representational sign is perceived as a neces- sary constituent of its imaginary referent; the result is an oscillatory move- ment of the subject's attention between the sign and this referent. The fun- damental task of aesthetics is to demonstrate that this relation is not a mere contingency but implicit in representation and therefore in the human itself. Aesthetic oscillation is minimized in the linguistic sign; this minimiza- tion constitutes formal or "symbolic" (Peirce) representation. The efficiency with which the linguistic sign designates its referent allows the interlocutor to transcend the sign toward the referent. In Qu'est-ce que la littérature? Sartre referred to this characteristic of language as "transparency", but it is worth noting that he limited it to prose. The intuition, usually associated with Vico - it can be found in Rousseau as well - that the first language was (sacred) poetry reminds us that "transparent" linguistic minimization is not an a priori feature of representation but the product of a historical process of divergence from its diametrical opposite, the institutionalized reproduction of the originary scenic configuration in ritual. Standing between the mini- mality of language and the maximality of ritual, where representation ap- proaches full-fledged reproduction, the oscillatory movement of the aes- thetic affirms the mutual dependency of the sign and its sacred referent. In- sofar as the referent is made to depend on the sign, it must be understood as imaginary, that is, as manifesting itself on the individual's internal scene of representation. This imaginary staging of the aesthetic requires some degree of staging in the real world, the minimum being no doubt the silent reading of prose narrative - the characteristic mode of the egocentric, novel- dominated nineteenth century - that obliges the imagination to construct its scene wholly from language. Whereas the destiny of language is to inspire technologies that increas- ingly minimize its physical presence, institutional representation must oc- cupy the experience of human time in order to transcend it; Mircea Eliade' s in ilio tempore is founded not in an ideal past but in the evocation of this past within the ideal present of ritual. Aesthetic experience reproduces the collective dynamic of ritual within the experience of the individual, who, by submitting himself, as at the origin, to the authority of the intentional sign, experiences the mutual dependency of representation and its sacred com-</page><page sequence="3">Originary and/or Kantian Aesthetics 337 munal referent. Only on the imaginary scene that we derive from the "timeless" transcendent vantage point of ritual can we be made aware of time's passage. The recherche du temps perdu is characteristic of all aes- thetic experience. *** Western metaphysics does not describe aesthetic experience in originary terms. A philosopher who thought to define the aesthetic by the oscillation between sign and imaginary referent would take this definition as phenome- nological, that is, as a reference to pure experience. As such, its implicit anthropological basis would be that supplied by Kant, the theoretician of pure experience. In his third Critique, Kant situates "beauty" under the ru- bric of the "aesthetic judgment of purposiveness" ("ästhetisches Urteil über die Zweckmäßigkeit"), as the source of a pleasure that attends this judgment when there is no concept of the understanding to which the purposiveness can be referred, as, say, the purposiveness of a horse to the empirical con- cept "horse" (which would not prevent a horse from being beautiful if its appearance suggests a purposiveness unclassifiable under the empirical concept "horse"). We experience the object's purposiveness, its status as the intentional product of a will, outside the context of any specific purpose. The beautiful object gives the appearance of freedom, of being an end in it- self: When pleasure is connected with mere apprehension ( apprehensio ) of the form of an object of intuition, and we do not refer the apprehension to a concept so as to give rise to determinate cognition, then we refer the presentation not to the object but solely to the subject; and the pleasure cannot express anything other than the object's being commensurate with the cognitive powers that are, and insofar as they are, brought into play when we judge reflectively, and hence [expresses] merely a subjective formal purposiveness of the object. For this apprehension of forms by the imagination could never occur if reflective judgment did not compare them, even if unintentionally, at least with its ability [in general] to refer intuitions to concepts. Now if in this comparison a given presentation unintentionally brings the imagination (the power of a priori intuitions) into harmony with the under- standing (the power of concepts), and this harmony arouses a feeling of pleasure, then the object must thereupon be regarded as purposive for the reflective power of judgment. A judgment of this sort is an aesthetic judgment about the object's pur- posiveness; it is not based on any concept we have of the object, nor does it pro- vide such a concept. When the form of an object (rather than what is material in its presentation, viz., in sensation) is judged in mere reflection on it (without regard to a concept that is to be acquired from it) to be the basis of a pleasure in such an ob- ject' s presentation, then the presentation of this object is also judged to be con- nected necessarily with this pleasure, and hence connected with it not merely for the subject apprehending this form but in general for everyone who judges [it]. The</page><page sequence="4">338 Eric Gans object is then called beautiful, and our ability to judge by such a pleasure (and hence also with universal validity) is called taste. For the basis of the pleasure is posited merely in the form of the object for reflection in general, and hence not in a sensation of the object, nor with a reference to any concept that might involve some intention or other. Therefore, the harmony we are dealing with is only a har- mony in reflection, whose a priori conditions are valid universally, between the presentation of the object and the lawfulness [inherent] in the empirical use in gen- eral of the subject's power of judgment (this lawfulness being the unity between imagination and understanding). And since this harmony of the object with the powers of the subject is contingent, it brings about the presentation of a purposive- ness of the object with regard to the subject's cognitive powers. (Introduction, VII, pp. 29 f.)2 Wenn mit der bloßen Auffassung (apprehensio) der Form eines Gegenstandes der Anschauung ohne Beziehung derselben auf einen Begriff zu einem bestimmten Erkenntniß, Lust verbunden ist: so wird die Vorstellung dadurch nicht auf das Object, sondern lediglich auf das Subject bezogen; und die Lust kann nichts anders als die Angemessenheit desselben zu den Erkenntnißvermögen, die in der reflec- tirenden Urtheilskraft im Spiel sind, und sofern sie darin sind, also bloß eine sub- jective formale Zweckmäßigkeit des Objects ausdrücken. Denn jene Auffassung der Formen in die Einbildungskraft kann niemals geschehen, ohne daß die reflec- tirende Urtheilskraft, auch unabsichtlich, sie wenigstens mit ihrem Vermögen, An- schauungen auf Begriffe zu beziehen, vergliche. Wenn nun in dieser Vergleichung die Einbildungskraft (als Vermögen der Anschauungen a priori) zum Verstände (als Vermögen der Begriffe) durch eine gegebene Vorstellung unabsichtlich in Einstimmung versetzt und dadurch ein Gefühl der Lust erweckt wird, so muß der Gegenstand alsdann als zweckmäßig für die reflectirende Urtheilskraft angesehen werden. Ein solches Urtheil ist ein ästhetisches Urtheil über die Zweckmäßigkeit des Objects, welches sich auf keinem vorhandenen Begriffe vom Gegenstande gründet, und keinen von ihm verschafft. Wessen Gegenstandes Form (nicht das Materielle seiner Vorstellung, als Empfindung) in der bloßen Reflexion über die- selbe (ohne Absicht auf einen von ihm zu erwerbenden Begriff) als der Grund einer Lust an der Vorstellung eines solchen Objects beurtheilt wird: mit dessen Vorstellung wird diese Lust auch als nothwendig verbunden geurtheilt, folglich als nicht bloß für das Subject, welches diese Form auffaßt, sondern für jeden Urtheilenden überhaupt. Der Gegenstand heißt alsdann schön; und das Vermögen, durch eine solche Lust (folglich auch allgemeingültig) zu urtheilen, der Ge- schmack. Denn da der Grund der Lust bloß in der Form des Gegenstandes für die Reflexion überhaupt, mithin in keiner Empfindung des Gegenstandes und auch ohne Beziehung auf einen Begriff, der irgendeine Absicht enthielte, gesetzt wird: so ist es allein die Gesetzmäßigkeit im empirischen Gebrauche der Urtheilskraft überhaupt (Einheit der Einbildungskraft mit dem Verstände) in dem Subjecte, mit der die Vorstellung des Objects in der Reflexion, deren Bedingungen a priori all- gemein gelten, zusammen stimmt; und da diese Zusammenstimmung des Gegen- 2 All references to Kant's third critique make use of the following editions: in German, Kritik der Urtheilskraft , ed.

(Einleitung, VII, pp. 189 f) For Kant, the beautiful object arouses a pleasure distinct from that provided by the satisfaction of appetite or interest. Because the purposiveness of the beautiful object cannot be subsumed under a concept of the understanding, "the pleasure can express nothing but the conformity of the object to the cognitive powers brought into play in the reflective judgment" ("die Lust kann nichts anders als die Angemessenheit [des Objekts] zu den Er- kenntnißvermögen, die in der reflectirenden Urtheilskraft im Spiel sind"), that is, the object pleases us because it demonstrates our ability as free be- ings to grasp purposiveness in itself rather than merely as subordinate to a system of categories. ("For that apprehension of forms in the imagination can never take place without the reflective judgment, even when it has no intention of so doing, comparing them at least with its ability of referring intuitions to concepts." ["Denn jene Auffassung der Formen in die Ein- bildungskraft kann niemals geschehen, ohne daß die reflectirende Urtheils- kraft, auch unabsichtlich, sie wenigstens mit ihrem Vermögen, Anschauun- gen auf Begriffe zu beziehen, vergliche."]) The beautiful object displays its purposiveness as if it were free, and we take pleasure in its revelation of our own freedom by which alone we are able to recognize this purposiveness. Because it is indifferent to the worldly existence of its object, this pleasure is "disinterested" and, consequently, the judgment of taste declares an ob- ject beautiful, not subjectively, for me alone, but universally. The pleasure in the judgment of purposiveness derives from the sense of intentional formal closure that is first achieved in the performance of the sign. We need not deny the physiological component of this pleasure, but we must, in the spirit of an anthropologized Kant, respect the primacy of the representational, specifically human component of this satisfaction: the re- lease of tension attendant on participating in the communal representation of the central object rather than in mimetic conflict over its appropriation. The unanimity of this participation is the source of the universality of the "judgment of taste" (Geschmacksurteil); to take pleasure in a representation is to participate esthetically in a community from which violence has been deferred. The source of the "judgment of purposiveness" (Urteil über die Zweckmäßigkeit), which Kant attributes to our "cognitive powers" (Er- kenntnisvermögen), is more specifically our power of representation, under- stood not as a component of the individual mind awaiting the neurologist's reconceptualization as a module of the cerebral cortex but as a specifically human capacity derived from the originary scene. The source of Kant's disinterested pleasure is the originary deferral of violence through repre-</page><page sequence="6">340 Eric Gans sentation. The community is critically interested in this deferral, but this common interest depends on its individual members renouncing their mate- rial, worldly interest in the object, which their act of representation situates on the transcendent plane of the sacred. The oscillation between sign and imaginary referent by which originary thinking defines the aesthetic renews the originary pleasure in participating in the aborted gesture of appropriation that defers violence through signifi- cation. Beginning with representation, we conjure up a world of desire (a moment of the aesthetic experience not recognized by Kant), but once within this imaginary world, we are forced to recognize our dependency on the cultural sign with its burden of "disinterested" renunciation of desire. Whatever neuro-physiological pleasure we find in harmonious form - and the modernist aesthetic shows that harmonious form is by no means essen- tial - is recruited to this experience of cultural harmony that is heir to the originary sacred. * * * Kant locates the aesthetic effect, defined as "disinterested liking" (uninter- essiertes Wohlgefallen), in the power of judgment, which he situates mid- way between the understanding, whose concepts make sense of the natural world, and reason, which "legislates" practical rules to our free will. The normal function of judgment is to subsume the objects of the natural world under the concepts of the understanding. But the aesthetic defeats judg- ment's efforts; the object, explicitly or implicitly a representation, that pro- vokes the aesthetic experience cannot be subsumed under a concept. The concepts of nature, which contain a priori the basis for all theoretical cogni- tion, were found to rest on the legislation of the understanding. The concept of freedom was found to contain a priori the basis for all practical precepts that are unconditioned by the sensible, and to rest on the legislation of reason. [. . .] And yet the family of our higher cognitive powers also includes a mediating link between understanding and reason. This is judgment [...] [Th]ere is [...] another basis, namely, for linking judgment with [...] our presenta- tional powers [...] that seems even more important than the one involving judg- ment's kinship with the family of cognitive powers. For all of the soul's powers or capacities can be reduced to three that cannot be derived further from a common basis: the cognitive power, the feeling of pleasure and displeasure, and the power of desire. The understanding alone legislates for the cognitive power when this power is referred to nature, namely, as a power of theoretical cognition, (as indeed it must be when it is considered by itself, without being confused with the power of desire); for only with respect to nature (as appearance) is it possible for us to give laws by means of a priori concepts of nature, which are actually pure concepts of the understanding. For the power of desire, considered as a higher power gov- erned by the concept of freedom, only reason (which alone contains that concept)</page><page sequence="7">Originary and/or Kantian Aesthetics 341 legislates a priori. Now between the cognitive power and the power of desire lies the feeling of pleasure, just as judgment lies between understanding and reason. Hence we must suppose, at least provisionally, that judgment also contains an a priori principle of its own, and also suppose that since the power of desire is neces- sarily connected with pleasure or displeasure (whether this precedes the principle of this power, as in the case of the lower power of desire, or, as in the case of the higher one, only follows from the determination of this power by the moral law), judgment will bring about a transition from the pure cognitive power, i. e., from the domain of the concepts of nature, to the domain of the concept of freedom, just as in its logical use it makes possible the transition from understanding to reason. (Introduction, III, pp. 16-18) Die Naturbegriffe, welche den Grund zu allem theoretischen Erkenntniß a priori enthalten, beruhten auf der Gesetzgebung des Verstandes. - Der Freiheitsbegriff, der den Grund zu allen sinnlich-unbedingten praktischen Vorschriften a priori ent- hielt, beruhte auf der Gesetzgebung der Vernunft. [...] Allein in der Familie der oberen Erkenntnißvermögen giebt es doch noch ein Mittelglied zwischen dem Verstände und der Vernunft. Dieses ist die Urtheilskraft [...] Hierzu kommt aber noch (nach der Analogie zu urtheilen) ein neuer Grund, die Urtheilskraft mit einer anderen Ordnung unserer Vorstellungskräfte in Verknüp- fung zu bringen, welche von noch größerer Wichtigkeit zu sein scheint, als die der Verwandtschaft mit der Familie der Erkenntnißvermögen. Denn alle Seelenver- mögen oder Fähigkeiten können auf die drei zurück geführt werden, welche sich nicht ferner aus einem gemeinschaftlichen Grunde ableiten lassen: das Er- kenntnißvermögen, das Gefiihl der Lust und Unlust, und das Begehrungsvermögen. Für das Erkenntnißvermögen ist allein der Verstand gesetzgebend, wenn jenes (wie es auch geschehen muß, wenn es für sich, ohne Vermischung mit dem Begeh- rungsvermögen, betrachtet wird) als Vermögen eines theoretischen Erkenntnisses auf die Natur bezogen wird, in Ansehung deren allein (als Erscheinung) es uns möglich ist, durch Naturbegriffe a priori, welche eigentlich reine Verstandesbe- griffe sind, Gesetze zu geben. - Für das Begehrungsvermögen, als ein oberes Vermögen nach dem Freiheitsbegriffe, ist allein die Vernunft (in der allein dieser Begriff statthat) a priori gesetzgebend. - Nun ist zwischen dem Erkenntniß- und dem Begehrungsvermögen das Gefühl der Lust, so wie zwischen dem Verstände und der Vernunft die Urtheilskraft enthalten. Es ist also wenigstens vorläufig zu vermuthen, daß die Urtheilskraft eben so wohl für sich ein Princip a priori enthalte und, da mit dem Begehrungs vermögen nothwendig Lust oder Unlust verbunden ist (es sei, daß sie wie beim unteren vor dem Princip desselben vorhergehe, oder wie beim oberen nur aus der Bestimmung desselben durch das moralische Gesetz folge), eben so wohl einen Übergang vom reinen Erkenntnißvermögen, d. i. vom Gebiete der Naturbegriffe, zum Gebiete des Freiheitsbegriffs bewirken werde, als sie im logischen Gebrauche den Übergang vom Verstände zur Vernunft möglich macht. (Einleitung, III, pp. 176-179) What are we to make of Kant's three "powers of the soul" (Seelenver- mögen)? If knowledge results from the exercise of pure (theoretical) reason on the natural world, and desire is the mode of the free will's action on the practical (ethical) world, what, beyond its usefulness in Kant's triadic sys- tem, is pleasure doing between knowledge and desire?</page><page sequence="8">342 Eric Gans The justification of Kant's model is made more intelligible in the per- spective of originary anthropology. In the generative context, the practical- ethical must precede the theoretical. The possibility of conceptual thought depends on the inaugural act of human freedom: the deferral of mimetic violence through the abortion of the potentially rivalrous act of appropria- tion and its transformation into the originary sign or name-of-God. This act is also the origin of desire, which we distinguish from appetite by its me- diation through the sign. (In The Cognitive and Anthropological Origins of Narrative 3, Richard van Oort, adapting the Peircean schema of Terrence Deacon's The Symbolic Species 4, refers to this originary transformation as the passage from the indexical signs of the associative world of appetite to the autonomous semiotic world of the symbolic sign.) As a result of the emission of the sign, the participants experience the "pleasure" of the deferral of violence that is the foundation of all cultural pleasures. This moment also permits the dispersal of the newly constituted community, protected by the mediation of the sacred center they have col- lectively represented. The application to the natural world of the concepts of the understanding is dependent not only on the sign's prior existence but also on the persistence of the deferral of violence it inaugurates, and that we have just seen to be the source of aesthetic pleasure. In the passage from the originary ethical act to the emergence of a conceptual understanding of the natural world, the sign representing the central sacred object is transformed into an instrument of cognition; the name-of-God becomes an empirical concept. The aesthetic experience of representation is the moment of the originary event in which the unity of the two poles is affirmed; as in Kant's schema, it is intermediary between ethical and cognitive, sacred and pro- fane. The sign as aborted gesture is the first act of human freedom, but, as in Hobbes' model of sovereignty, each participant's emission of the sign ex- presses the free sacrifice of his appetite, which only then becomes "desire", for (the sake of) the sacred center. In contrast, the cognitive moment of originary signification transmits not sacrality but information concerning the worldly presence of the central object. The distinction between the cen- tral being as material object on the one hand and as the "immortal" subsis- tent signified of the sign on the other is the originary source of Kant's dis- tinction between the concepts of the understanding that make sense of the natural world and the concept of freedom that alone belongs to the kingdom of reason. 3 http://www2.bc.edu/~richarad/lcb/fea/mla0 lrvo.html. Cambridge, Mass. 1997.</page><page sequence="9">Originary and/or Kantian Aesthetics 343 What must be intermediary between the sacralization of the object that coincides with renunciation of the attempt to appropriate it and its cognitive classification under a concept (as "God") is the moment in which the sign is no longer an act of ethical solidarity and not yet a mere instrument, but in- dependently evokes its referent in the imagination, no longer as material object but as sacred being. The sacred sign is absolutely motivated; the for- mal closure that cuts it off from worldly action is alone the criterion of its significance for the community, not the specific form this closure in fact en- closes. On the contrary, at the cognitive pole, the sign is "arbitrary", capable of being recalled in its specificity as a signifier designating a signified. What assures the affective link between the arbitrary sign and the experi- ence of sacred interdiction is the possibility of imaginarily, that is, aestheti- cally , evoking the scene by means of the sign. The aesthetic moment is, so to speak, the becoming-portable of the sign. What makes this moment uniquely pleasurable is that it permits the indi- vidual subject to experience within his imagination the sacred deferral of violence by means of the sign. The aesthetic experience, however solitary, is always implicitly collective. The pleasure of the aesthetic effect is not merely affirmed as universal but implicitly shared by the human commu- nity; the peaceful sharing of the aesthetic experience is a guarantee of com- munal harmony, in contrast with the mimetic rivalry provoked by the "shared" desire for a real object. What Kant omits from this experience, along with the intuition of communal solidarity, is the concomitant experi- ence of the transcendence of desire through the oscillation between sign and imaginary object that defines the aesthetic experience. As soon as I come to desire the imaginary object, which is to say, to experience an implicit ri- valry with my fellows over it, I am obliged to recognize that the source of my imaginary conception is nothing but a representation, that is, something made possible by my existence within the human community constituted by the deferral of violence. The pleasure in the moment of sharing exists only against a constantly renewed background of "painful" desire that Kant does not mention. Kant recognizes the painful nature of the experience of the sublime, but never the oscillation between pain and pleasure, possession and dispossession. The aesthetic experience can best be conceived in Kantian terms as an oscillation between the pleasure of beauty and the pain of sub- limity. We may now revisit Kant's affirmation that aesthetic pleasure "cannot express anything other than the object's being commensurate with the cog- nitive powers that are, and insofar as they are, brought into play when we judge reflectively, and hence [express] merely a subjective formal pur- posiveness of the object" ("kann nichts anders als die Angemessenheit [des</page><page sequence="10">344 Eric Gans Objekts] zu den Erkenntnißvermögen, die in der reflectirenden Urtheilskraft im Spiel sind, und sofern sie darin sind, also bloß eine subjective formale Zweckmäßigkeit des Objects ausdrücken"). What is unintuitive in Kant's description of "being commensurate with the cognitive powers" is precisely what is unanthropological: the "powers'" commensurability to which pro- vides the subject's pleasure in the object's "subjective formal purposive- ness" are not individual and cognitive but collective and ethical. The ulti- mate source of our pleasure in the "formal purposiveness" of aesthetic rep- resentation is not our "cognitive powers" but our intuition that the commu- nity's shared participation in this purposiveness or representational inten- tionally will protect us from mimetic violence. The aesthetic performs a function analogous to that attributed by Durkheim to religious ritual: it rein- forces our solidarity with the sacred center and, through its mediation, with our fellow members of the human community. 2. The Aesthetic Social Contract Although the concept of "representation" ( Vorstellung ) occupies an analo- gous place in critical philosophy and in generative anthropology as an ac- tivity limited to what Kant calls the "rational being" (vernünftiges Wesen), Kant never specifically associates it with language. A minimal expression of the difference between originary anthropology and metaphysics, as repre- sented by its greatest minimalist, is that the former, but not the latter, takes the linguistic sign, doubly articulated as signifier/signified, as the exemplary form of representation. Although Kant is not unconcerned with the human reciprocity that is the foundation of the "moral model" inaugurated by the originary exchange of signs, the reciprocity that interests him is not that of empirical communica- tion but of the virtual communication through which all humans share the moral law and the judgment of taste. Of the two, the latter case, where an experience that is wholly individual and falls under no law is nonetheless implicitly universal, has greater anthropological pregnancy, as befits the intermediary position of the judgment between representation and worldly reality. In describing what he calls the "empirical" value of this experience, Kant outlines in a single sentence a scene of reciprocal exchange closer to that of the originary hypothesis than to those of the social contract theorists that preceded him: Only in society is the beautiful of empirical interest. And if we grant that the urge to society is natural to man but that his fitness and propensity for it, i. e., sociabil- ity, is a requirement of man as a creature with a vocation for society and hence is a</page><page sequence="11">Originary and/or Kantian Aesthetics 345 property pertaining to his humanity, then we must also inevitably regard taste as an ability to judge whatever allows us to communicate even our feeling to everyone else, and hence regard taste as a means of furthering something that everyone's natural inclination demands. Someone abandoned on some desolate island would not, just for himself, adorn either his hut or himself; nor would he look for flowers, let alone grow them, to adorn himself with them. Only in society does it occur to him to be, not merely a human being, but one who is also refined in his own way (this is the beginning of civilization). For we judge someone refined if he has the inclination and the skill to communicate his pleasure to others, and if he is not satisfied with an object unless he can feel his liking for it in community with others. Moreover , a concern for universal communication is something that everyone expects and demands from everyone else , on the basis, as it were, of an original contract dictated by [our] very humanity. Initially, it is true, only charms thus become important in society and become connected with great interest, e. g., the dyes people use to paint them- selves (roucou among the Caribs and cinnabar among the Iroquois), or the flowers, sea shells, beautifully colored feathers, but eventually also beautiful forms (as in canoes, clothes, etc.) that involve no gratification whatsoever, i.e., no liking of enjoyment. But in the end, when civilization has reached its peak, it makes this communication almost the principal activity of refined inclination, and sensations are valued only to the extent that they are universally communicable. At that point, even if the pleasure that each person has in such an object is inconsiderable and of no significant interest of its own, still its value is increased almost endlessly by the idea of its universal communicability. (§41, pp. 163-164. Emphasis mine, E. G.) Empirisch interessirt das Schöne nur in der Gesellschaft ; und wenn man den Trieb zur Gesellschaft als dem Menschen natürlich, die Tauglichkeit aber und den Hang dazu, d. i. die Geselligkeit, zur Erforderniß des Menschen, als für die Gesellschaft bestimmten Geschöpfs, also als zur Humanität gehörige Eigenschaft einräumt: so kann es nicht fehlen, daß man nicht auch den Geschmack als ein Beurtheilungs- vermögen alles dessen, wodurch man sogar sein Gefühl jedem andern mittheilen kann, mithin als Beförderungsmittel dessen, was eines jeden natürliche Neigung verlangt, ansehen sollte. Für sich allein würde ein verlassener Mensch auf einer wüsten Insel weder seine Hütte, noch sich selbst ausputzen, oder Blumen aufsuchen, noch weniger sie pflan- zen, um sich damit auszuschmücken; sondern nur in Gesellschaft kommt es ihm ein, nicht bloß Mensch, sondern auch nach seiner Art ein feiner Mensch zu sein (der Anfang der Civilisirung): denn als einen solchen beurtheilt man denjenigen, welcher seine Lust andern mitzutheilen geneigt und geschickt ist, und den ein Ob- ject nicht befriedigt, wenn er das Wohlgefallen an demselben nicht in Gemein- schaft mit andern fühlen kann. Auch erwartet und fordert ein jeder die Rücksicht auf allgemeine Mittheilung von jedermann, gleichsam als aus einem ursprüngli- chen Vertrage, der durch die Menschheit selbst dictirt ist ; und so werden freilich anfangs nur Reize, z.B. Farben, um sich zu bemalen (Rocou bei den Caraiben und Zinnober bei den Irokesen), oder Blumen, Muschelschalen, schönfarbige Vogel- federn, mit der Zeit aber auch schöne Formen (als an Canots, Kleidern usw.), die gar kein Vergnügen, d. i. Wohlgefallen des Genusses, bei sich führen, in der Ge- sellschaft wichtig und mit großem Interesse verbunden: bis endlich die auf den höchsten Punkt gekommene Civilisirung daraus beinahe das Hauptwerk der ver- feinerten Neigung macht, und Empfindungen nur so viel werth gehalten werden,</page><page sequence="12">346 Eric Gans als sie sich allgemein mittheilen lassen; wo denn, wenn gleich die Lust, die jeder an einem solchen Gegenstande hat, nur unbeträchtlich und für sich ohne merkli- ches Interesse ist, doch die Idee von ihrer allgemeinen Mittheilbarkeit ihren Werth beinahe unendlich vergrößert. (§41, pp. 296-297. Emphasis mine, E. G.) Having made this ur-anthropological connection between the "original con- tract" (ursprünglicher Vertrag) of humanity and the "universal communica- bility" (allgemeine Mitteilung) of aesthetic representations, Kant hastens in the following paragraph to deny its ontological significance: This interest, which we indirectly attach to the beautiful through our inclination to society and which is therefore empirical, is, however, of no importance for us here, since we must concern ourselves only with what may have reference a priori, even if only indirectly, to a judgment of taste. For if even in this [pure] form [of a judg- ment of taste] an interest were to reveal itself [as] connected with it, then taste would reveal [how] our ability to judge [provides] a transition from sense enjoy- ment to moral feeling. Moreover, not only would we then have better guidance in using taste purposively, but we would also be showing [that judgment is] a medi- ating link in the chain of man's a priori powers, the powers on which all legislation must depend. This much we can surely say about empirical interest in objects of taste and in taste itself: in such an interest taste caters to inclination, and no matter how refined this inclination may be, still the interest will also easily fuse with all the [other] inclinations and passions that reach their greatest variety and highest degree in society; and if our interest in the beautiful is based on these, then it can provide only a very ambiguous transition from the agreeable to the good. But whether taste, if taken in its purity, may not still be able to further this transition - this we have cause to investigate. (§41, pp. 164 f) Dieses indirect dem Schönen durch Neigung zur Gesellschaft, angehängte mithin empirische Interesse ist aber für uns hier von keiner Wichtigkeit, die wir nur da- rauf zu sehen haben, was auf das Geschmacksurtheil a priori, wenngleich nur indi- rect, Beziehung haben mag. Denn wenn auch in dieser Form sich ein damit ver- bundenes Interesse entdecken sollte, so würde Geschmack einen Übergang unseres Beurtheilungsvermögens von dem Sinnengenuß zum Sittengefühl entdecken; und nicht allein, daß man dadurch den Geschmack zweckmäßig zu beschäftigen besser geleitet werden würde, es würde auch ein Mittelglied der Kette der menschlichen Vermögen a priori, von denen alle Gesetzgebung abhängen muß, als ein solches dargestellt werden. So viel kann man von dem empirischen Interesse an Gegen- ständen des Geschmacks und am Geschmack selbst wohl sagen, daß es, da dieser der Neigung fröhnt, obgleich sie noch so verfeinert sein mag, sich doch auch mit allen Neigungen und Leidenschaften, die in der Gesellschaft ihre größte Mannig- faltigkeit und höchste Stufe erreichen, gern zusammenschmelzen läßt, und das In- teresse am Schönen, wenn es darauf gegründet ist, einen nur sehr zweideutigen Übergang vom Angenehmen zum Guten abgeben könne. Ob aber dieser nicht etwa doch durch den Geschmack, wenn er in seiner Reinigkeit genommen wird, be- fördert werden könne, haben wir zu untersuchen Ursache. (§41, pp. 297 f) The reference to "purity" (Reinigkeit) in the last sentence is a segue to the following section on the "intellectual interest" in the beautiful; for Kant,</page><page sequence="13">Originary and/or Kantian Aesthetics 347 following Rousseau, an aesthetic interest in nature, as opposed to art, is a sign of moral value. Now I am indeed quite willing to concede that an interest in the beautiful in art [...] provides no proof whatever that [someone's] way of thinking is attached to the morally good [. . .] On the other hand, I do maintain that to take a direct interest in the beauty of nature [...] is always a mark of a good soul [...] (§42, p. 165) Ich räume nun zwar gerne ein, daß das Interesse am Schönen der Kunst [...] gar keinen Beweis einer dem Moralisch-Guten anhänglichen oder dazu geneigten Denkungsart abgebe. Dagegen aber behaupte ich, daß ein unmittelbares Interesse an der Schönheit der Natur zu nehmen [...] jederzeit ein Kennzeichen einer guten Seele sei [...] (§42, p. 298) The "original contract" is characterized by reciprocal exchange, as empha- sized by the sentence structure, with its opposition between erwartet and fordert , ein jeder and jedermann. Yet the collective entity formed by this exchange is "of no importance for us here" ("für uns hier von keiner Wich- tigkeit"), and this because it is from the outset, and all the more so as hu- manity advances from the Caribs and Iroquois to the height of civilization, contaminated with society's "inclinations and passions" (Neigungen und Leidenschaften). Even considered a priori, taste cannot be "a mediating link in the chain of man's a priori powers" ("ein Mittelglied der Kette der men- schlichen Vermögen") because its "catering (frönen) to inclination" puts in danger the disinterested nature of the pleasure that it judges "in its purity". This passage illustrates perhaps more strikingly than any other both the kinship between the critical philosophy and generative anthropology and the divide that separates them. Kant's a priori derives, like Plato's realm of ideas, from the world of sacred representation, but where Plato simply hy- postatizes the products of representation, lifting human words up into the sky, Kant's a priori guarantees the vertical-transcendental realm of repre- sentation itself by separating it ontologically from the horizontal-empirical world of appetite. But the necessity of maintaining an absolute separation between the two worlds makes it impossible to conceive, let alone explain, the genesis of one from the other. Kant's dualism comes closest to synthesis in the aesthetic domain. The judgment of taste returns the "cognitive pow- ers" (Erkenntnisvermögen) from the conceptual analysis of the natural world to a reflection on their own originary nature; moreover, this operation depends on the existence of a community that at least virtually shares and mutually communicates this experience. It is but a short step from this con- figuration to a hypothetical scene of origin, yet this step is as impossible for Kant as the leap of an inhabitant of Flatland into the third dimension. In reality, Kant's Carib and Iroquois ornaments are of sacred character, like the sacred objects of the "Aranda" in which, in Durkheim' s analysis,</page><page sequence="14">348 Eric Gans the unity of the social order is incarnate, but Kant's Rousseauian privileging of the individual over society blinds him to the derivation of the "charms" of the aesthetic from the critical social function of the sacred. The aesthetic, even the sublime, are cut off from the discussion of the transcendental re- ligious questions that we find in the previous two Critiques. Aesthetic pleasure is a worldly experience that intuits transcendence directly, without the need for the transcendental guarantees - the existence of God, the im- mortality of the soul - required by the upholder of the moral law. Yet it is not coincidental that the texts we are discussing are found, not in the "Ana- lytic of Beauty" (Analytik des Schönen) where Kant defines the moments of aesthetic experience, but in the "Analytic of the Sublime" (Analytik des Er- habenen). This section in fact contains relatively little specific analysis of the sublime, but the sublime's liberation from the closure of beautiful form makes it the privileged locus not only of the awe before natural phenomena to which Vico attributes our first intuition of the sacred but also of the gene- sis of transcendence from immanence, whose mystery only anthropology, not metaphysics, can solve. *** Kant's system is the final synthesis of the classical metaphysical vision of the human that still remains the foundation of moral and aesthetic philoso- phy today (e. g., Rawls' Theory of Justice). Kant looks down from the height of the a priori of pure reason on what he considers the lesser empiri- cal science of anthropology; he never tires of reminding us that the subject- matter of critical philosophy is not homo sapiens but the non-empirical category of "rational beings" (vernünftigen Wesen). The goal of generative anthropology is to bring together in a single model, but not conflate, the worlds whose separation Kant was the first philosopher rigorously to re- spect - the a priori and the empirical, the domain of representation and the domain of reality - by providing a parsimonious model of the historical generation, from within the empirical world, of Reason and its "kingdom of purposes" (Reich der Zwecke). In the Kantian sense of the word, generative anthropology is critical anthropology. 3. The Kantian Sublime [...] the intrinsic and most important distinction between the sublime and the beautiful is presumably the following [...]: [...] natural beauty carries with it a purposiveness in its form, by which the object seems as it were predetermined for</page><page sequence="15">Originary and/or Kantian Aesthetics 349 our power of judgment [...] if something arouses in us [...] a feeling of the sub- lime [...] it may indeed appear [...] contrapurposive for our power of judgment [. . .] and as it were violent to our imagination [. . .] (§23, pp. 98 £) Der wichtigste und innere Unterschied aber des Erhabenen vom Schönen ist wohl dieser: daß [...] die Naturschönheit [...] eine Zweckmäßigkeit in ihrer Form, wodurch der Gegenstand für unsere Urtheilskraft gleichsam vorherbestimmt zu sein scheint, bei sich führt, [...] hingegen das, was in uns [...] das Gefühl des Erha- benen erregt, der Form nach [...] zweckwidrig für unsere Urtheilskraft [...] und gleichsam gewaltthätig für die Einbildungskraft erscheinen mag [...] (§23, p. 245) If Kant's analysis of the beautiful depends implicitly on the paradoxical re- lationship between representation and its object, in his analysis of the sub- lime, the paradox is made explicit. Although the beautiful object cannot be subsumed under a concept, its contemplation provides a pleasurable stimu- lation to our cognitive power, which grasps beautiful form as something meant to be perceived and cognized by it. The sublime, on the contrary, makes us realize the limitations of this power. The pleasure provided by this initially unpleasant realization is of a moral nature; the experienced excess of nature over our power of judgment makes us aware of the transcendent relationship between our reason and the everyday world. [...] the feeling of the sublime is a feeling of displeasure that arises from the imagination's inadequacy, in an aesthetic estimation of magnitude, for an estima- tion by reason, but is at the same time also a pleasure, aroused by the fact that this very judgment, namely, that even the greatest power of sensibility is inadequate, is [itself] in harmony with rational ideas, insofar as striving toward them is still a law for us. For it is a law (of reason) for us, and part of our vocation, to estimate any sense object in nature that is large for us as being small when compared with ideas of reason; and whatever arouses in us the feeling of this supersensible vocation is in harmony with that law. (§27, pp. 1 14 f) Das Gefühl des Erhabenen ist also ein Gefühl der Unlust aus der Unangemessen- heit der Einbildungskraft in der ästhetischen Größenschätzung zu der Schätzung durch die Vernunft und eine dabei zugleich erweckte Lust aus der Übereinstim- mung eben dieses Urtheils der Unangemessenheit des größten sinnlichen Ver- mögens mit Vernunftideen, sofern die Bestrebung zu denselben doch für uns Ge- setz ist. Es ist nämlich für uns Gesetz (der Vernunft) und gehört zu unserer Be- stimmung, alles, was die Natur als Gegenstand der Sinne für uns Großes enthält, in Vergleichung mit Ideen der Vernunft für klein zu schätzen; und was das Gefühl dieser übersinnlichen Bestimmung in uns rege macht, stimmt zu jenem Gesetze zusammen. (§27, p. 257) Kant's "mathematical" sublime is a reaction to the purely quantitative greatness of physical magnitude, which, by showing us the inadequacy of our "power of sensibility" (sinnliches Vermögen), reminds us of its "small- ness" in comparison with "ideas of reason" (Ideen der Vernunft). The con- ceptual movement from displeasure to pleasure may be understood from the</page><page sequence="16">350 Eric Gans perspective of originary anthropology as describing the passage from the conflict occasioned by the excess of desire for the object to the peace pro- vided by the promotion of this object to the status of a sign of transcen- dence. What we experience as too great for our (collective and individual) desire gives us pleasure as a sign pointing to the "supersensible" domain of signification that defers our conflict over desire. Kant's statement that this experience "arouses in us the feeling of this supersensible vocation" ("das Gefühl dieser übersinnlichen Bestimmung in uns rege macht") is tanta- mount to a claim that this experience generates this feeling. Where the mathematical sublime triggered by quantitative magnitude merely negates our faith in the understanding, the infinity of power ("qual- ity") we experience in the "dynamic" sublime provides a transcendent ob- ject of faith. The mathematical sublime is a negative moment between two forms of order, that of the understanding and that of reason, between the beautiful, which finds satisfaction in form, and the dynamic sublime, which substitutes for formal order that of an all-powerful divine will. We can, however, consider an object fearful without being afraid of it, namely, if we judge it in such a way that we merely think of the case where we might possi- bly want to put up resistance against it, and that any resistance would in that case be utterly futile. Thus a virtuous person fears God without being afraid of him. For he does not think of wanting to resist God and his commandments as a possibility that should worry him . But for every such case, which he thinks of as not impossi- ble intrinsically, he recognizes God as fearful. (§28, pp. 1 19 £) Man kann aber einen Gegenstand als furchtbar betrachten, ohne sich vor ihm zu fürchten, wenn wir ihn nämlich so beurtheilen, daß wir uns bloß den Fall denken , da wir ihm etwa Widerstand thun wollten, und daß alsdann aller Widerstand bei weitem vergeblich sein würde. So fürchtet der Tugendhafte Gott, ohne sich vor ihm zu fürchten, weil er ihm und seinen Geboten widerstehen zu wollen sich als keinen von ihm besorglichen Fall denkt. Aber auf jeden solchen Fall, den er als an sich nicht unmöglich denkt, erkennt er ihn als furchtbar. (§28, pp. 260 f) Kant's exposition of the relationship between the fearful and the sublime clearly owes much to Burke;5 but where the latter (as Kant points out) re- mains within the realm of empirical psychology, for Kant the dynamic sub- lime defines our relationship to transcendence. Kant's categories of the beautiful and the sublime correspond to the two relationships between rep- resentation and its referent that make up the paradox of signification. On the side of form, representation is a (beautifully) adequate substitute for its ref- erent, just as the originary sign was an adequate substitute for the inaccessi- ble central object; in contrast, on the side of content, representation is a 5 Edmond Burke, A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful (1757).</page><page sequence="17">Originary and/or Kantian Aesthetics 351 (sublimely) inadequate substitute for its referent, just as God is always more than the sign that designates him. The sign can function to defer mimetic ri- valry for the central object only if it is at the crucial moment an acceptable substitute for it. But the very peace brought about by this substitution trans- forms the relation to the central object and makes possible its appropriation within the framework of culture. Unlike the beautiful, which inheres in an object whose formal adequacy to our cognitive power is embodied in a universal judgment of taste, the sublime is a subjective attitude not inherent in the (natural) object that in- spires it. But the preceding passage suggests that this "subjectivity" defines a relationship to a necessarily inadequate figuration of an unfigurable divine transcendence. The experience of the sublime reflects the Judeo-Christian rejection of idols that cannot incarnate the sacred but at best suggest it by their very ontological distance from it. The object that provokes the experi- ence of the sublime is not a "graven image" but something that resists being experienced as a sign and is for that very reason experienced as a sign of the limitations of signification. * * * The concept of the sublime has played an eccentric role in aesthetic theory since Pseudo-Longinus in the first century. The opposition between the sublime and the beautiful is an artificial one. Aesthetic experience is an os- cillation between the sign and its referent caused by the necessary inability of either representation or imaginary reality to create a stable plenitude of signification; the experience of beautiful form includes the sublime within it as the moment of the representation's inadequacy. Kant describes this os- cillatory movement, but only with respect to the sublime, to which he con- trasts our "restful contemplation" (ruhige Kontemplation) of the beautiful: In presenting the sublime in nature the mind feels agitated, while in an aesthetic judgment about the beautiful in nature it is in restful contemplation. This agitation (above all at its inception) can be compared with a vibration, i. e., with a rapid al- ternation of repulsion from, and attraction to, one and the same object. If a [thing] is excessive for the imagination (and the imagination is driven to [such excess] as it apprehends [the thing] in intuition), then [the thing] is, as it were, an abyss in which the imagination is afraid to lose itself. Yet, at the same time, for reason's idea of the supersensible [this same thing] is not excessive but conforms to rea- son's law to give rise to such striving by the imagination. Hence [the thing] is now attractive to the same degree to which [formerly] it was repulsive to mere sensibil- ity. The judgment itself, however, always remains only aesthetic here. For it is not based on a determinate concept of the object, and presents merely the subjective play of the mental powers themselves (imagination and reason) as harmonious by virtue of their contrast. For just as, when we judge the beautiful, imagination and</page><page sequence="18">352 Eric Gans understanding give rise to a subjective purposiveness of the mental powers by their accordance, so do imagination and reason here give rise to such a purposive- ness by their conflict, namely, to a feeling that we have a pure and independent reason, or a power for estimating magnitude, whose superiority cannot be made intuitable by anything other than the inadequacy of that power which in exhibiting magnitudes (of sensible objects) is itself unbounded. (§27, pp. 115 f) Das Gemüth fühlt sich in der Vorstellung des Erhabenen in der Natur bewegt: da es in dem ästhetischen Urtheile über das Schöne derselben in ruhiger Contempla- tion ist. Diese Bewegung kann (vornehmlich in ihrem Anfange) mit einer Er- schütterung verglichen werden, d. i. mit einem schnell wechselnden Abstoßen und Anziehen eben desselben Objects. Das Überschwengliche für die Einbildungskraft [...] ist gleichsam ein Abgrund, worin sie sich selbst zu verlieren fürchtet; aber doch auch für die Idee der Vernunft vom Übersinnlichen nicht überschwenglich, sondern gesetzmäßig, eine solche Bestrebung der Einbildungskraft hervorzubrin- gen: mithin in eben dem Maße wiederum anziehend, als es für die bloße Sinn- lichkeit abstoßend war. Das Urtheil selber bleibt aber hiebei immer nur ästhetisch, weil es, ohne einen bestimmten Begriff vom Objecte zum Grunde zu haben, bloß das subjective Spiel der Gemüthskräfte (Einbildungskraft und Vernunft) selbst durch ihren Contrast als harmonisch vorstellt. Denn so wie Einbildungskraft und Verstand in der Beurtheilung des Schönen durch ihre Einhelligkeit, so bringen Einbildungskraft und Vernunft hier durch ihren Widerstreit subjective Zweck- mäßigkeit der Gemüthskräfte hervor: nämlich ein Gefühl, daß wir reine, selb- ständige Vernunft haben, oder ein Vermögen der Größenschätzung, dessen Vor- züglichkeit durch nichts anschaulich gemacht werden kann, als durch die Un- zulänglichkeit desjenigen Vermögens, welches in Darstellung der Größen (sinnli- cher Gegenstände) selbst unbegränzt ist. (§27, p. 258) The beautiful creates "accordance" where the sublime generates "conflict". This contrast, which effectively trivializes the beautiful with respect to the sublime, was revived in the postmodern era, where the sublime retained its intellectual prestige whereas the beautiful was considered an outmoded category, a quasi-synonym for kitsch. What is at stake is clarified by Burke's psychological analysis, which associates the beautiful with the feminine and the sublime with the masculine: the greater spiritual resonance of the sublime would reflect the fact that culture privileges the deferral of violence over the fulfillment of desire, since without the former there would be no opportunity for the latter. Yet it is desire itself that inspires the vio- lence; literature celebrates the sublimity of female desirability, from Helen of Troy to Laclos' Mme de Merteuil and Joyce's Molly Bloom. This artifi- cial segregation of the sexes guarantees the firewall between the "supersen- sible" world of the arbitrary sign and the world of sensuous forms, natural or man-made, the firewall that defines and protects the metaphysical world- view. As an experience of transcendence cut off from its immanent basis, the sublime is a psychological effect divorced from any cultural context; the</page><page sequence="19">Originary and/or Kantian Aesthetics 353 violence of storms and crags becomes a substitute for the human violence crystallized in the sacred. This was already the function of the sublime in antiquity; whereas Aristotle saw no need to separate off the experience of transcendence from aesthetic experience in general, by Longinus' time, the old gods had lost their credibility, not least in contrast with the God of Christianity, and could no longer implicitly guarantee this experience. The Enlightenment's rediscovery of the sublime reflects its ambition to put away the Judeo-Christian God as well and construct a wholly empirical anthro- pology. * * * Thus modern aesthetics is born in the conceptual splitting of its object into two parts, the sublime and the beautiful, neither of which is complete in it- self. In the place of the sublimely beautiful, we must choose between the pretty and the monstrous, between the sign that loses itself in mimetic iden- tity with its worldly object and the sign that bears its inadequacy on its face; the first provides a pleasure of the understanding, the second, the transcen- dent joy of reason. These dichotomies, and those of Kantian thought in gen- eral, situate within the categories of culture the split that culture is designed to mediate, and, in so doing, display the limitations of the Enlightenment's scenic imagination. For Kant, the aesthetic scene is either charmingly pa- cific or fearfully agitated. That the peace of the former in fact results from the fearsomeness of the latter is too radical an idea for even the greatest thinker of an era that could conceive the deferral of human violence as the source of human institutions, but not of the human itself.</page></plain_text>
