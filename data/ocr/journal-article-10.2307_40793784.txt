<plain_text><page sequence="1">Exhibition Reviews Paired Brothers: Concealment and Revelation. Iatmul Ritual Art from the Sepik, Papua New Guinea. University of Cambridge Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, 25 February 2004 to March 2005. Ever since Otto Finsch's 'discovery' of the Sepik in 1885, the art of communities living along the serpentine path of Papua New Guinea's largest river has been a source of fascination for Europeans. One of the most renowned cultural groups in the Middle Sepik are the Iatmul, whose ritual art is the focus of Paired Brothers, the first temporary exhibit in the University of Cambridge Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology devoted to the region. Drawing on the Museum's seventy-year connection with the Iatmul, the curators, Andrew Moutu and Anita Herle, have skilfully woven together both recent acquisitions and older pieces to tell several sets of stories that coalesce around the exhibit's central theme of 'paired brothers': concealment and revelation.1 Through its display of forty-eight objects and forty-nine photographs, the exhibition demonstrates that 'paired brothers' is an Iatmul metaphor that underlies many aspects of their life. The most explicit of the exhibit's pairings are the ritual systems, the bandi and the naven. A male initiation ritual, the bandi involves initiates being instructed on aspects of 'morality, interpersonal relations and endurance' (Herle and Moutu 2004: 24). Bandi initiates undergo extensive scarification, which signifies their transformation into men. Made famous by the Cambridge anthropologist Gregory Bateson's ethnography of the same name (Bateson 1936), the naven is a ritual involving pantomime, role-reversal and transvestitism. Performed by women (father's sister, mother's sisters, and mother's brother's wives) and men (mother's brothers), the naven celebrates a child's first- time achievements (finishing the male initiation cycle, a girl catching her first eel, obtaining a University degree, etc.). These two ceremonies - the former private and the latter public - form the pivot for the exhibit's central theme, and are dealt with at the exhibit's end. Drawing on the Museum's early Iatmul collection, which was principally obtained by Bateson, Paired Brothers examines Bateson's work (1929-30, 1932 and 1938) in light of Moutu's fieldwork among the Iatmul, which involved his bandi initiation (2000-1).2 Herein lies another of the exhibit's 'paired brothers'. It is primarily through the coupling of their observations, objects and photographs that the exhibit deals with the Iatmul 's past and present forms of cultural expression. Paired Brothers can be read as a dialogue between these two anthropologists about and with the Iatmul. This temporal twining turns Paired Brothers into a dynamic exploration of Iatmul ritual art in time. The exhibition occupies roughly half of the upper gallery space, beginning before the entrance to the museum's offices and continuing along the narrower walkway that runs along the gallery's far wall. Despite the awkwardness of this area's layout, the exhibit's design successfully guides visitors through the show. The exhibition's beginning contains the first eight sections of Paired Brothers, all of Journal of Museum Ethnography 1 7 (2005) 241</page><page sequence="2">Exhibition Reviews which deal with the broader contextualization of Iatmul social and cosmological life. This section's red coloured panels delineate the exhibit, and visually push forward the displayed objects and photographs. The exhibit opens with two carved slit gongs, a pair of water drums decorated with anthropomorphic carvings and an image of water drums being used. Adding to the exhibit's ambiance is a flute duet played by initiated men during the bandi ceremony. Recorded by the anthropologist Bob McLennan in the 1960s, this music is later contextualised in the exhibit's discussion of the bandi. Following an introductory panel that geographically situates the Iatmul and outlines the show's themes, visitors come to a section entitled, 'Artefacts of History - Stories from the Sepik'. A wooden storyboard from Kambot, an iconic object in the nexus of Sepik carvings made for the tourist trade, is prominently displayed. Within this object, narrative is encoded through the depiction of multiple carved scenes. Other objects, such as the contemporary carving of a crocodile made by an Iatmul man living in Port Moresby and the crocodile head-shaped canoe prow collected in the 1920s, demonstrate how narrative is more opaquely rendered in Iatmul art. These objects' associations are suggested by the curators' quoting long portions of the Iatmul origin myth told to Moutu by Keman Kama, a Yenjan villager. The myth relates how the opening of the primal crocodile male gave birth to the heaven (upper jaw) and the earth (lower jaw), as well as the Iatmul totemic moieties. The myth also relates the origin of the male scarification ritual, an integral part of the bandi, as being the result of marks made by the teeth of crocodiles. These two crocodile carvings, along with other objects displayed, possess multiple associations with this myth and give a material presence to these stories. The next two cases delve into the Iatmul moiety system and the role of the men's houses, both of which are understood in terms of 'paired brothers'. This section draws upon a range of objects to clearly present this complex material. Bateson's photographs, particularly of the elder- and younger-brother's men's houses, are displayed to great effect. These and the other images used throughout the exhibit are, however, not mere illustrations, rather like the other objects displayed, they have been thoughtfully chosen by the curators to convey the multiple layers of Iatmul social life. The following case, 'Iatmul Lifecycle, Kinship and Gender', focuses on the person. It unpacks the relational aspects of Iatmul gender through a display of a netbag, a spinning top, a paint tray, necklaces and a headdress. These objects, and the wide range of object types displayed throughout the exhibit, help counteract the often held assumption that Iatmul art is confined to their fantastic masks and carvings. Bateson's photographs of a mortuary effigy and of a bride-wealth assemblage also help present a more holistic view of the Iatmul material world and, within the confines of this case, its connections to personhood. The section's remaining two panels deal with the history of Cambridge's links with the Iatmul and with the nature Iatmul knowledge. The first panel contextualises Bateson's and Moutu's fieldwork through photographs and archival letters. The importance of Bateson's work is outlined within the scene of British Social Anthropology in the 1930s. Here we learn that Bateson collected over 800 Iatmul objects and took over 400 field photographs. While the focus on Moutu's 242 Journal of Museum Ethnography 17 (2005)</page><page sequence="3">Exhibition Reviews fieldwork is shorter, his experience of the bandi initiation, which is brought out later, points to the different, but related, ways in which both anthropologists had esoteric knowledge revealed to them. The adjacent case, 'Stories, Names and Esoteric Knowledge' delves into the connections between stories and names, and how both are owned entities passed down through the totemic moieties to men and women. The exhibit's final case involves a contiguous series of eight alternating panels that deal with the layers of concealment and revelation found within the bandi and naven. In one direction the case's panels are painted red and concern the bandi, while the other panel-set are light beige and refer to the naven. The most ambitiously displayed section of the exhibit, the effect of the alternating panels works well and highlights how these rituals interpenetrate one another. The Iatmul notion of concealment is elaborated by the display of two flutes used in the bandi ceremony alongside a contemporary carving of an initiate undergoing ritual scarification and a carving collected by Bateson behind a dark screen. While the concepts behind the screen's use (it is meant to mimic the bandi enclosure) might be lost on some visitors, I felt that this was a novel display of items that normally would be concealed from woman and uninitiated men. The bandi is made more immediate and personal by the inclusion of photographs of Moutu's experience of different phases of the initiation. Alongside images taken by Bateson in 1932, these photographs help show the extent to which the bandi is an enduring tradition. The naven is given a similar treated that includes informative text panels that deal with the ritual's intricacies and another set of Bateson's photographs. These images help present the kinetic liveliness inherent to the naven pantomimes, as well as the ethnographic moment that Bateson sought to frame. Viewers are reminded of the extent to which photographs were integral to Bateson's ethnographic project. While outlining aspects of the naven, Moutu and Herle focus on the activities (the completion of a mwai mask, or of a trading expedition) that the naven is used to celebrate. In doing so, aspects of Iatmul society not examined earlier are explored and a wider view of Iatmul cultural life is presented. Despite its small size, Paired Brothers convincingly conveys the complexity of Iatmul cultural life, and demonstrates the underlying role that their ritual art plays in sustaining revelation and concealment. The exhibit effectively demonstrates that these central themes are central to the Iatmul knowledge production and distribution. Moreover, Paired Brothers is a wonderful example of what ethnographically informed exhibits can and should be. Moutu's fieldwork-derived insights are successfully blended with Herle 's understanding of the museum and its history, to make Paired Brothers a challenging and rewarding show. Not only have they done a wonderful job in revealing aspects of Iatmul ritual art that have lain obscured in Bateson's rich but dense ethnography, they have also brought to light more of the wonderful pieces that have lain in the museum's storage facility. In this way, the exhibit itself can be seen as revelation of both the interconnections that the curators see within the art, as well as of pieces within the museum's collection not previously shown.

The exhibit aptly demonstrates Anthony Forge's argument about Sepik art, that the region's art 'is not ... a representation of anything in the natural or spirit world, rather it is about the relationships between things' (Forge 1973: 189). Throughout Paired Brothers, we see how this relationship, in the Iatmul idiom the pairing of brothers, plays out in different realms of Iatmul cultural life. Notes 1 . The exhibit is accompanied by a book of the same title, co-authored by the curators and published by the Museum. 2. The exhibit also displays material collected by E. W. P. Chinnery, C. B. Humphreys and J. A. T. Thurston. Chinnery studied with A. C. Haddon in Cambridge in 1919, and after working as a patrol officer became the Government Anthropologist for the Territory of New Guinea. Another student of Haddon's, C. B. Humphreys donated a collection from New Britain and mainland New Guinea to the museum in 1926. J. A. T. Thurston donated objects in 1929.
