<plain_text><page sequence="1">American Philosophical Quarterly Volume 35, Number 2, April 1998 TELEOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS Gregory Cooper Introduction V^/ver the last two decades, environmen? tal ethics has emerged as a distinct subfield in philosophy, and I think it is fair to say that no force has exerted a more profound influence on environmental ethics than the science of ecology. On balance, this has been good for philosophy and, though some might argue the point, it has been good for ecology as well. Still, interdisci? plinary work has its pitfalls. Sometimes extreme ideas from one field can show up as uncontroversial truths in another. As we will see, this has happened in the relation? ship between ecology and environmental ethics. In particular, there is a disturbing tendency in the environmental ethics lit? erature to rely on metaphysically rich, but scientifically controversial, ideas from the sciences of ecology and ethology. Three examples will be discussed; one from the animal rights camp, a second from the rev? erence for life perspective, and a third from the ethical holists (to use Callicott's (1980) phrase). In each of these cases, value theory helps itself to a kind of teleology that it is not clear the science is ready to yield. In an effort to better understand the relation? ships among these three examples, the pa? per concludes with a brief look at the concepts of teleology, design and function. Beyond Applied Ethics Before turning to the examples, I will make a few general remarks about the na? ture of the intellectual enterprise that en? vironmental ethics represents. These remarks are about broad tendencies and are intended only to fix the conceptual back? ground for the examples and to indicate why environmental ethics shows a special susceptibility to the kinds of hasty infer? ences discussed in the next section. On the face of it, environmental ethics sounds like a branch of applied philoso? phy. In particular, it sounds like another species of applied ethics, on a par with business ethics and medical ethics. What is applied ethics? Business ethics attempts to draw out the implications of traditional moral theory for decision making and policy formation in the business world. Medical ethics does the same sort ofthing for health care. If environmental ethics were a branch of applied ethics one would expect it to have a similar focus?to deter? mine the implications of moral theory and established moral principles for environ? mental decision making and the formulation of environmental policy. However, envi? ronmental ethics is, by and large, the name for a much more theoretically ambitious philosophical enterprise. Rather than ap? plying moral theory, environmental ethics 195</page><page sequence="2">196 / AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY has primarily been devoted to changing it. Of course attempts to apply moral ideas are bound to have an impact on the shape of those ideas, and this has been particularly true of medical ethics. But I am not talk? ing here about the ordinary interaction of theory and practice. If one surveys the lit? erature in environmental ethics one finds very little by way of application of ethical ideas to actual concrete decision making situations?the kinds of scenarios that are the lifeblood of medical ethics for example. The discipline is clearly pre? occupied with a different project. We can call this the extensionist project, and I will describe it briefly.1 Historically, moral theory has been about relationships among people. Using the ap? propriate term of art, we can say that the class of moral patients is confined to hu? mans. (To be a moral patient is to count morally.) The extensionist project, then, involves the attempt to expand the class of moral patients. Some versions of the project are more ambitious than others, and we can locate the various positions on a continuum of ambitiousness, depending on the degree to which they propose to swell the ranks of moral patients. At the conser? vative end are animal rights approaches such as that of Tom Regan (1983); they attempt to expand the class of moral pa? tients to include at least some animals. Further out are life-centered views such as Paul Taylor's (1986), which tries to broad? en the moral circle to include all life. Though the metaphor of an extensionist continuum breaks down to some degree, we can also find philosophers, such as J. Baird Callicott (1989) and Holmes Rolston III (1986), who extend the moral franchise beyond the realm of living individuals. They claim that we have moral obligations to entire ecosystems. As I said, the various extensionist projects are all substantive attempts to rework moral theory rather than simply apply it. At bot? tom, there are two potential strategies avail? able for the execution of such a project. The first, while leaving the core of the theory unchanged, argues that we have not been fully consistent in appreciating the conse? quences of the moral theory to which we are already committed. Peter Singer's (1975) utilitarian efforts to liberate animals is an example of such an approach. The central ideas in Singer's approach?that animals suffer and that suffering counts morally?date back to the last century. Singer is simply urging that we consis? tently apply them. The other, and far more common strategy, is to argue that our old moral ideas are simply out of touch with reality. Frequently, this newer view of re? ality, the view that is supposed to under? write the need to overhaul morality, is supplied by biological science, and espe? cially the subversive science?ecology. Unfortunately, in the search for ecological supports to undergird extensionist ideas, the pronouncements of the science have sometimes been distorted. I will now ex? amine three such cases. Wishing Doesn't Make It So The three cases I have in mind are asso? ciated with the three major stopping points on the extensionist continuum: other big brained mammals, life itself, and entire ecosystems. In each case I will urge that there is an empirical question which is, at best, still up for grabs, but which has been treated as fact in the development of the respective extensionist position. Case 1: The Minds of Animals Tom Regan wants to extend the class of moral patients to at least some animals. Toward this end, he articulates a "subject of-a-life criterion" as the criterion for membership in this class. Some of the nec? essary conditions for an organism being the</page><page sequence="3">TELEOLOGY / 197 subject-of-a-life include having beliefs, desires, self-consciousness, intention, a sense of the future, the capacity to experi? ence emotions such as fear and hatred, and preference and welfare interests (Regan 1983: 81, 243). Do any animals besides humans have these characteristics? Regan thinks there is room for debate about which animals get included, but that we can be sure at least that ". . . these are among the leading attributes of the mental life of nor? mal mammalian animals aged one or more." (Regan 1983: 81) Is this true? Does our best current understanding of animals allow us to conclude with confidence that other mammals have these characteristics? If we look at contemporary ethology and behavioral ecology?certainly a relevant place to look for an answer to this question? we find immediately that scientists cer? tainly talk as though animals have the kinds of cognitive properties Regan imputes to them. The emerging subfield of cognitive ethology, spawned largely by the work of Donald Griffin (e.g., Griffin 1976), to whom Regan refers extensively, appears to be self-consciously committed to the idea that animals have beliefs, desires, emotions, intentions, and the like. But mentalese is certainly not limited to cognitive ethology. One finds this kind of language across the whole spectrum of ethological research. The situation is similar in behavioral ecol? ogy, with its talk of strategies, search im? ages, and a variety of other terms that have their origin in folk psychology. But it is a mistake to move from this use of anthropomorphic language to the con? clusion that ethologists and behavioral ecologists are committed to the assumption that animals have the rich kind of mental life that Regan imputes to them. Such a move ignores the possibility that this an? thropomorphic language has a heuristic cognitive utility, but that it should not be taken literally. There is currently substantial controversy over this issue in ethology. As Bateson and Klopfer point out: Genuine benefits in terms of understanding flow from projecting ourselves into the ani? mals we study. This is not inconsistent, however, with a return to the full rigor of using operational or ostensive definitions when the time is ripe. Nor does attributing the power of thought to an animal, so that we can do more imaginative science, mean that, when our efforts are crowned with suc? cess, we have proved that animals think. This point lies at the heart of the difference be? tween the heuristic and the truth value of the attribution. (Bateson and Klopfer 1991: vi) Likewise, Kennedy (1992) warns that we should not confuse the heuristically useful strategy he calls "mock anthropomorphism," which he equates with adopting the inten? tional stance (Dennett 1987), with the pro? cess of giving a literal account of the causal details underlying animal behavior. Again, Beer (1992), in a survey of the conceptual issues raised by cognitive ethology which connects up nicely with various philosophi? cal analyses of intentionality and cognition, points to the controversial status of expla? nations of animal behavior which are couched in the mental categories which comprise Regan's subject-of-a-life crite? rion. He concludes his essay as follows: Advances in science have sometimes resulted from stepping back to a previously discarded position. Perhaps cognitive ethology will prove to be an advance in the study of be? havior in consequence of resuscitating questions of animal awareness. How far back it will be necessary to go to find the more fruitful formulation to these questions re? mains open to doubt however: to Darwin and Romaines who believed in animal aware? ness? or to Descartes, who did not? (Beer 1992: 105) It is not my intention to take sides in this debate; only to point to its existence. Regan claims it is an established scientific fact that (at least) mature mammals have the</page><page sequence="4">198 / AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY cognitive properties that make them sub? jects of a life; a less partisan look at the science suggests that the jury is still out. A second reason for caution in the inter? pretation of anthropomorphic talk, and this applies especially to behavioral ecology, traces back to the distinction between ulti? mate (i.e., functional) and proximate causes. Krebs and Davies warn that ... a great deal of misunderstanding can arise if functional and causal... explanations are confused. A simple illustration of this is an objection that is often raised to labels such as 'selfish', 'spiteful', 'sneak', transvestite', and 'rape' used by behavioural ecologists to describe the behaviours they observe. The objection is that the labels are too anthropo? morphic and are loaded with the implication that animals are endowed with human-like motives. The answer to this objection is that the labels are used not to describe the causal mechanisms underlying the behaviour but to describe its functional consequences. (Krebs and Davies 1981: 256) The functional discourse that Krebs and Davies refer to will be discussed in more detail in the final section; suffice it to say for now that it is the workings of natural selection, and not any kind of intentional agency, that is being referred to in such cases. Again, Dawkins, in response to psychologistic misreadings of his earlier work, attempts the following clarification: "When biologists talk about 'selfishness' or 'altruism' we are emphatically not talk? ing about emotional nature, whether of human beings, other animals, or genes. We do not even mean the words in a metaphori? cal sense. We define altruism and selfish? ness in purely behavioristic ways ..." (Dawkins 1981: 557, his emphases). In short, it is at best a matter of contro? versy whether or not animals have the kinds of cognitive properties Regan claims they have. Neither the anthropomorphic descriptions of ethology nor the intention alist talk of behavioral ecology provide unambiguous evidence for the new vision of reality that is supposed to undergird his extensionist project. It is, at any rate, not a solid enough plank on which to build a re? visionist morality that would have, among its practical consequences, the complete abolition of animal agriculture. Case 2'.Organisms as Teleological Centers of Life Like Regan, Paul Taylor tries to expand the class of moral patients by employing a cri? terion that turns essentially on our being able to adopt the organisms' point of view. Unlike Regan, he does not believe this re? quires establishing that organisms have rich mental lives that qualitatively re? semble the subjective experiences of hu? mans. Instead, he claims that it is sufficient to recognize that organisms are, in his words, "teleological centers of life." Since all or? ganisms are teleological centers of life, it follows that all organisms are moral patients. What is it to be a teleological center of life? What makes this a morally relevant characteristic? According to Taylor, to be a teleological center of life is essentially to have a good of one's own. Once we be? come fully aware of the nature of biologi? cal reality?and especially that portion of it revealed by ecology?we will be disposed to adopt the "biocentric outlook," from which perspective we will see not only that organisms are indeed teleological centers of life, but that that is sufficient for includ? ing them among the class of moral patients. This rather bald statement of Taylor's over? all position will have to suffice in the present context. I will focus only on one essential element in the argument?the idea that modern ecology (in this case, primarily evolutionary ecology) requires us to con? ceive of organisms in teleological terms. Taylor's primary argument can be recon? structed as follows. Teleological explana? tions remain essential to the biological</page><page sequence="5">TELEOLOGY / 199 sciences. Teleological explanations require reference to the good of the organism (i.e., its telos). Thus, individual organisms have a good of their own?that is, they are te? leological centers of life. There is, I think, a fairly uncontroversial sense in which this argument is sound. The teleological expla? nations that biology needs are the func? tional explanations referred to by Krebs and Davies above. The "good of the organ? ism" such explanations must involve is in? clusive fitness. Unfortunately, this is not the teleology Taylor has in mind. He explicitly says: "The concept of an organism's striving to preserve itself and realize its good is not identical with the more restricted concept of biological fitness, where fitness means the ability of an organism to ensure the continued existence of its genes in future individuals" (Taylor 1986: 121, note). It appears as though Taylor needs a teleologi? cal conception more suited to the biocentric outlook. As mentioned above, the teleologi? cal character of organismic existence is supposed to underwrite a kind of empathie projection into the life of the organism. Here is how Taylor describes the process: When our consciousness of the life of an in? dividual organism is characterized by both objectivity and wholeness of vision, we have reached the most complete realization, cognitively and imaginatively, of what it is to be that particular individual. We have let the reality of another's life enter the world of our own consciousness. We know it as fully and intensely as it can be known. (Tay? lor 1986: 127-28, his emphasis). Does the fact that we can talk about the fitness of a diatom but not of a stone suf? fice to underwrite Taylor's claim that when I imaginatively take up the point of view of the diatom I have enhanced my "reality awareness," but when I do likewise with the stone I am "moving away from reality, not getting closer to it"? It's not clear to me how one is supposed to decide these things, but it does appear that Taylor needs a stronger conception of teleology; fitness alone will do the job. What kind of teleology would underwrite the process of identification that Taylor needs? Can such a notion be found in con? temporary biology? These are difficult questions. Taylor clearly thinks he has found such a notion in what he calls "well being," however, he doesn't explicitly dis? cuss biological explanations that make use of such a concept. Instead he relies on sev? eral philosophical analyses of teleology, concluding (correctly) that the consensus view is that biology cannot do without the concept (Taylor 1986: 122, note). What Taylor doesn't mention is that the consen? sus is about the teleology introduced by natural selection; whether biology needs any stronger conception of teleology is, at best, a matter of substantial controversy. There is further consensus, I believe, on the fact that whatever forms of teleologi? cal explanation turn out to be biologically appropriate, they will at the same time be purely mechanistic (Brandon 1990). Whether this would cause further difficul? ties for Taylor's project is a question I will leave open. It is not my intention to evaluate Taylor's overall case for the view of organisms as teleological centers of life, but to make a more modest point. Part of his argument relies on the teleological character of con? temporary biology.2 But, Taylor needs a more robust concept of teleology than evo? lutionary ecology has to offer. Whether such a concept can be found remains a matter of controversy. Once again, we find a revisionist ethical proposal with dramatic practical implications?more dramatic even than Regan's?resting on a view of nature that has not been grounded in con? temporary biological science.</page><page sequence="6">200 / AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY Case 3: The Balance of Nature With Regan we have the teleology of self conscious intention, with Taylor the tele? ology of organismic life. However both of these accounts are individualistic. They are powerless to ground many of the values most closely associated with the idea of an environmental ethic?values such as bio? diversity and ecosystem integrity. What is needed, urge philosophers like Callicott and Rolston, is an extension of moral obli? gation to the land itself. Once again, the fruits of ecological inquiry contribute an essential element to the argument, and once again, it is an idea with an essentially te? leological flavor?in this case, it is the idea of the balance of nature. One of the earliest statements of this view is in Stephen Forbes' essay, "The Lake as a Microcosm." According to Forbes, "Perhaps no phenomena of life ... is more remarkable than the steady balance of or? ganic nature, which holds each species within the limits of a uniform average num? ber, year after year, although each one is always doing its best to break across boundaries on every side" (Forbes 1887: 549). What explains this balance? "Two ideas are thus seen to be sufficient to ex? plain the order evolved from this seeming chaos; the first that of a general commu? nity of interests among all the classes of organic beings here assembled, and the second that of the beneficent power of natural selection which compels such ad? justments of the rates of destruction and of multiplication of the various species as shall best promote this common interest" (Forbes 1887: 550). It is hard to overestimate the influence of the balance of nature idea in environ? mental ethics. It is equally hard to pin down the exact nature of the empirical claim that is being made. Forbes talks about the "com? munity of interests" and the way in which natural selection regulates populations of organisms so as to "promote this common interest." But there is a potential ambigu? ity here. On the one hand, the claim might be simply that every biotic community is a community of interests in the sense that each population in the community is "in? terested" in every other population because they all having a bearing on its survival and reproductive success. The balance of nature idea, on this reading, amounts to the claim that natural selection has produced a high level of coevolutionary relation? ship among the various species in the community?there is a great degree of in? terspecific interdependence in the determi? nants of fitness. It is as though natural selection has brought the whole group of populations to some adaptive peak in joint fitness space; since it is downhill in every direction, it is in the interest of each popu? lation that none of the species in the com? munity breaks its demographic bounds and moves the system off its peak. Notice that this interpretation is consis? tent with natural selection operating at the level of individual organisms. I mention this to draw a contrast with the second way in which Forbes' remarks might be taken. On the second reading, natural selection operates at the level of the community or ecosystem. Here "community of interests" is a matter of ecosystem fitness; the "in? terest" that the various populations in the community share is an interest in contrib? uting to this ecosystem level fitness. The balance of nature idea amounts to the claim that there is significant adaptation at the ecosystem level; the ecosystems that occur tend to be fitter?in this new ecosystem sense?than those that might have occurred. Both of these interpretations can be found in contemporary versions of the ethical holistic approach to environmental ethics. I offer the following brief examples?one for each reading. Consider first the follow? ing passage from Callicott:</page><page sequence="7">TELEOLOGY / 201 Ecological thought, historically has tended to be holistic in outlook. Ecology is the study of the relationships of organisms to one an? other and to the elemental environment. These relationships bind the relata?plants, animals, soils, and waters?into a seamless fabric. The ontological primacy of objects and the ontological subordination of relation? ships characteristic of classical Western science is, in fact, reversed in ecology. Eco? logical relationships determine the nature of organisms rather than the other way around. A species is what it is because it has adapted to a niche in the ecosystem. The whole, the system itself, thus, literally and quite straightforwardly shapes and forms its com? ponent species. (Callicott 1989: 87) In this, and numerous similar passages, Callicott is clearly expressing the view that natural selection has produced some kind of finely tuned, holistic balance in natural ecosystems. Unfortunately, the exact na? ture of the empirical claim being made is difficult to determine. In particular, there is evidence for the coevolutionary reading of the balance of nature idea discussed above when he talks about the various or? ganisms in the community (together with the abiotic environment) being bound to? gether into a "seamless fabric" of relation? ships. But his discussion of the way in which the system "shapes and forms its component species" could be taken as a reference to ecosystem level selection. I am persuaded by two considerations that the coevolutionary interpretation comes closest to what he has in mind. First, it seems to fit best with the passage. But more importantly, in a subsequent pas? sage, Callicott recognizes that ecology has largely abandoned the superorganism model of communities.3 The superorganism view, which attributes the same organic cohesion to communities that we find in organisms, lends itself rather naturally to ecosystem level selection (see, for example, Margalef 1963); the fact that Callicott does not see ecosystems in this way suggests that he is not making a claim about natural selection operating at this level. The second example comes from the work of Homes Rolston III. Here is what he says: An ecosystem is a productive, projective system. Organisms defend only their selves, with individuals defending their continuing survival and with species increasing the num? bers of kinds. But the evolutionary eco? system spins a bigger story, limiting each kind, locking it into the welfare of others, promoting new arrivals, increasing kinds and the integration of kinds. Species increase their kind, but ecosystems increase kinds, superposing the later increase onto the former. Ecosystems are selective systems, as surely as organisms are selective systems. The natural selection comes out of the sys? tem and is imposed on the individual. (Rolston 1991: 90-91). This passage, with its talk of ecosystems as "selective systems" comes very close to expressing natural selection at the level of the ecosystem. But an ambiguity remains; perhaps ecosystems are selective systems only in the sense that the collection of bi otic and abiotic factors that they represent constitute the selective environment (in the sense of Brandon 1990) for the various organisms living in the ecosystem. Equat? ing the entire ecosystem with the selective environment would involve the sort of pan adaptationism associated with the coevo? lutionary interpretation of the balance of nature just discussed, but it would not be ecosystem level selection. However, there are reasons for thinking that Rolston has a stronger view in mind. Elsewhere he says "... that an organism cannot be a good kind without situated environmental fitness. By natural selection the kinds of goods to which it is geneti? cally programmed must mesh with its eco systemic role" (1991: 81). The idea that organisms are selected for their "ecosystemic</page><page sequence="8">202 / AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY role" does seem to suggest a kind of eco? system level fitness. Two paragraphs later we find out a bit more about what this eco? system fitness is: "True, the vicissitudes of historical evolution do sometimes result in ecological webs that are suboptimal solu? tions, within the biologically limited pos? sibilities and powers of organisms. Still, such systems have been selected over mil? lennia for functional stability, and at least the burden of proof is on the human evalu ator to say why any natural kind is a bad kind and ought not to call forth admiring respect" (1991: 81-82). Apparently, then, Rolston is claiming a kind of ecosystem level selection for "functional stability." Though the interpretation has, at times, been rather tenuous, I think we can fairly conclude that both readings of the balance of nature idea are at work in the views of those who would extend moral obligations to ecosystems. I will not explore the argu? ments that are supposed to make the tran? sition from the balance of nature as a descriptive fact to the evaluative conclu? sions. Instead, as with the previous two cases, I want to ask the more modest ques? tion: Does the science really support the empirical claim? This time we must, in fact, ask two questions. Do ecological com? munities exhibit the high levels of inter? specific dependencies suggested in the first reading of the balance of nature idea? Does natural selection act at the level of ecosys? tems? Let us take these questions in turn. The core idea behind the first reading seems to be something like the following. If the various species in the community are connected in the way that is suggested, then changes in the population densities of one species will invariably have an impact on population densities of other species. Popu? lation regulation, on this view, is a func? tion of biotic interactions among the various organisms in the community. Typi? cally, this view is accompanied by the idea that natural selection has crafted this intri? cate web of biotic dependencies. Unfortu? nately, the extent to which this is true has been a subject of debate in ecology for at least the last 50 years (see May 1984, Pimm 1991, Cooper 1994). Most recently, the consensus seems to be that for some kinds of organisms (e.g., phytophagous insects) populations levels are determined pretty much independently of what is going on with other kinds of organisms around them; they respond to the vagaries of weather and other sorts of abiotic factors (see, for ex? ample, Andrewartha and Birch 1954,1984). Other kinds of organisms (e.g., many kinds of birds) are likely influenced more by in tra and interspecific interactions (see Lack 1954, Orians 1962). I should emphasize that neither side in this debate is prepared to argue for anything like the "seamless fabric" that Callicott has in mind.4 What about ecosystem level evolution? Once again, there is ? history of contro? versy. At times, ecologists have been rather indiscriminate in their views about the lev? els at which selection can operate (see Allee et al. 1949, Wynne Edwards 1962, Margalef 1963 for examples). However, in 1966 George Williams published an influ? ential work in which he argued that all evo? lutionary phenomena could be explained in terms of individual Darwinian selection (Williams 1966). This had a sobering ef? fect, and any selection above the level of the individual organism fell out of favor. Since then, group selectionist ideas have been making a comeback, and there is even some contemporary talk of superorganisms (Wilson and Sober 1988), but even this higher level selection, if it exists, is not ecosystem level selection. The latter re? mains a rather dubious notion in most quar? ters of ecology and evolutionary biology.5 We have arrived, once again, at a struc? ture erected on insecure footing (to keep the architectural metaphor intact). The ethical</page><page sequence="9">TELEOLOGY / 203 holist would have us extend moral stand? ing to ecosystems in part because ecosys? tems have been given certain sorts of special characteristics by natural selection?they manifest the balance of nature. Unfortu? nately, it is, at best, a matter of controversy whether ecosystems are even remotely like the ethical holist would have us see them. We have gone through three cases, rep? resenting the three major stopping points along the extensionist continuum. In each case, we have seen a tendency to read a kind of teleology into nature. In each case, the teleology is an important element in an argument for dramatically restructuring our moral world. Unfortunately, what the ex? tensionist takes as fact, the science sees as controversy. In the next section we will look at teleology from a philosophical per? spective with an eye toward better under? standing the relationships among these three cases. Teleology, Design, and Functional Discourse The notions of teleology, design, and function form a rather tight conceptual cluster. I will not attempt to tease apart the relationships in any detailed way here. The important connections, for our purposes, are as follows. Teleology implies a kind of goal-directedness; the goals impose con? straints on the trajectory of the system in the sense that a causally complete account of the phenomena must specify these goals. The goals, in turn, are the result of the sys? tem being designed in a certain way. This generic sense of design underwrites func? tional discourse in its various manifesta? tions. Philip Kitcher argues for such an interpretation of functional talk: On the view I shall propose, the central common feature of usages of function? across the history of inquiry, and across contexts involving both organic and inor? ganic entities?is that the function of S is what S is designed to do; design is not al? ways to be understood in terms of back? ground intentions, however; one of Darwin's important discoveries is that we can think of design without a designer. (Kitcher 1994: 2) I want to concentrate on this issue of func? tional attribution. What the three example have in common is the tendency to take literally a certain kind of functional dis? course, even though it remains an open question among the scientists whether such discourse should be taken literally. We have already discussed the case for scientific uncertainty; in this section, I will use the philosophical theory of functions to clarify the nature of the difficulties that each of these views faces. If the legitimacy of functional talk traces back to the existence of design, then the key question is: What are the legitimate sources of design? The above passage from Kitcher has already suggested the answer. As he puts it: "Contemporary attributions of function recognize two sources of de? sign, one in the intention of agents and one in the action of natural selection." (Kitcher 1994: 2) Thus we should confront each of the three cases with the following pair of questions: (1) Is there reliance on a legiti? mate source of design? (2) If so, is there sufficient justification for the design attri? bution in the case at hand? We begin with Regan. He takes, as his point of departure, the teleological lan? guage of the contemporary behavioral sci? ences. When we examine the discourse of ethologists, cognitive psychologists, be? havioral ecologists, and the like, we do indeed find talk of functions. What sources of design are supposed to underwrite the functional ascriptions? Just the two on our list, it seems. For the bulk of ethology and behavioral ecology, the source of design behind the functional discourse is natural selection. As mentioned above, sometimes the language of intentionality is used, but</page><page sequence="10">204 / AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY it is typically shorthand for an underlying story which, if told literally, would talk about natural selection and other forces of evolutionary change. In the field of cogni? tive ethology (and perhaps other areas of cognitive science) the functional language is more frequently based on the other source of design?the intentions of organ? isms. In any case, there is no appeal to il? legitimate sources of design. When we turn to the second question, however, problems emerge. Clearly, Regan needs functional talk grounded in inten? tions (and not just natural selection) for his subject-of-a-life criterion to be applicable. And if his moral extensionism is to have significant scope this intentionality, in the rather strong form in which he employs it, must extend well beyond the human do? main. The explanation of why the beaver cut the gnarly branch and jammed it into the stream bed?gnarly end downstream so as to hold fast in the current?has to be in terms of the beavers intention of building a dam, not, for example, in terms of the fitness enhancing behavior of sound engi? neering practices. We have already seen, however, that this is just where the scien? tific controversy is located. If we choose intentionality for the dam building, we must also explain, it seems, why the bea? ver plasters the loudspeaker playing the sound of running water with mud in terms of the intention to plug a leak. Some would urge that intentionality is merely playing a heuristic role here; I do not propose to par? ticipate in the debate, only to point out its existence. To sum up, then, Regan is not presup? posing a source of design in nature that is not recognized by the philosophical theory of functions?to that extent he is on solid ground. His troubles are with the second question. It remains a matter of controversy whether the intentionality he needs can be attributed over the domain he desires. With Callicott and Rolston the situation is much the same. The also have no prob? lems with the first question; the source of design they presuppose is natural selection. However, there is reason to doubt that natu? ral selection accomplishes the things they claim it does. In Callicott's case, assum? ing the correctness of the earlier analysis, there is little support from evolutionary ecologists for the existence of coevolution? ary relationships on the scale he seems to envision, though the notion of organis? mic coevolution is not itself problematic (Futuyma and Slatkin 1983). For Rolston, the situation is slightly different. His view presupposes a process?natural selection? that is unproblematic; but there are seri? ous questions about whether that process occurs at the level he claims?the level of entire ecosystems. Finally, we come to Taylor. He does not get past the first question. His teleology is grounded in neither intentionality nor natural selection. That does not entail, of course, that there is no source of design in nature that would underwrite Taylor's brand of teleology. Perhaps the list is in? complete.6 But it does mean that Taylor has two arguments yet to make: (1) that there does exist in contemporary biology a third kind of teleology, and (2) that it carves nature at just the joint that he needs to make his revisionist moral program work. Conclusion That we must rethink our relationship with the environment goes without saying. But we should enter such a process with an open mind: if the voice of science is uncertain, then we must be patient. It might be objected that the standards for scientific consensus are being set too high. Given the weighty moral issues in the balance, we should play it safe so to speak. If we are unsure about the cognitive lives of other organisms, about the extent to which there</page><page sequence="11">TELEOLOGY / 205 is teleology beyond intentionality and natu? ral selection, about the existence of a natu? ral balance in ecosystems, then we should be conservative; we should conduct our? selves as if these possibilities are true un? til we have established otherwise. But the objection is beside the point. None of the positions examined make that argument. They are not saying: "Here is an empirical possibility about which Sci? ence is uncertain, but owing to the signifi? cant moral implications involved, it is a possibility we should take seriously in our practical moral deliberations." In fact, it would be a step forward if this were the argument; it would focus more attention on those empirical questions that are es? pecially relevant to evaluative issues, and it would enhance the credibility of envi? ronmental ethics among the unconverted. My point has been that the arguments which have been made display disturb? ing tendencies toward partisan readings of the relevant science. Those who would use scientific results to reshape our moral world should be very careful not to let prior conceptions of what this shape should be influence their interpretation of the scien? tific findings. Duke University Received August 13, 1997 NOTES 1. A number of authors have used the extensionist metaphor in this way; see Johnson (1984), for example. 2. As one of the anonymous reviewers of this manuscript has pointed out, the nature of this reliance is itself a bit tricky. Taylor clearly does not believe that his normative position follows in any direct way from our biological understanding. Locating appropriate principles of conduct toward nature "... requires us to engage in ethical inquiry and not simply 'read off moral norms from a certain way of conceiving of the order of living things." (Taylor 1986: 9) On the other hand, the biocentric outlook, which supplies the ultimate warrant for his extensionism, is said to be " . . . firmly rooted in the findings of the physical and biological sciences . . . not flawed by obscure notions and vague abstractions" (Taylor 1986: 160). Again, "... the outlook contains no empirically false propositions, as far as can be ascertained on the basis of present knowledge in the physical and biological sciences. . . . Thus it will always present a scientifically enlightened way of understanding the system of nature. In its description of the order and objects of the empirical world, the biocentric outlook will be acceptable not only to the scientific community itself but also to all those who are scientifically informed" (Taylor 1986: 161). Whatever the ultimate relation between the normative theory and the relevant science, it is clear that Taylor wants his view to square with our best biology. 3. The idea that ecological communities are a kind of superorganism traces back to the work of F. E. Clements (1905). The view imputes to ecological communities the same kind of develop? mental integrity and organic cohesion that we find in organisms. 4. The literature on this controversy in ecology is voluminous. For an insightful historical ac? count see Kingsland (1985). 5 Since about mid-century, ecologists have been divided into two relatively distinct camps? those who study organisms and populations of organisms, and those who study ecosystems as physicochemical systems. The idea of ecosystem level selection, when it appears, usually comes</page><page sequence="12">206 / AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY out of the ecosystem ecology tradition. But even among this group, the contemporary attitude appears to be one of skepticism about the existence of ecosystem level selection (see Burns et al. 1991: 230). For a philosophical discussion of the differences, with respect to teleology, between population and ecosystem ecologists see Shrader-Frechette (1986). 6. Amundson and Lauder (1994) have attempted to break the tight connection that Kitcher sees between function and design. It is possible that their arguments provide the resources for distinguishing the third type of teleology that Taylor needs; however, I will not explore that possibility here. BIBLIOGRAPHY Allee, W.
