<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANCIENT EGYPTIAN ART IN MALTA* Alicia I. Meza As the ancient Eastern Mediterranean trading routes extended farther west, the Phoenicians secured important colonies along the coasts of Europe and Africa. The Carthaginians took control over most of these routes upon the decline of the Phoenician international trade, blending their culture and art with those left behind by the Phoenicians. Malta was no exception to this artistic and cultural symbiosis. Today it is almost impossible to discern among the large quantity of Egyptian and Egyptianizing objects unearthed in archaeological sites in Malta, whether they were really imported by Phoenicians and Carthaginians, or if they were crafted in Maltese workshops under Egyptian supervision. For instance, the extant part of a Punic building, now in a private garden in Zurrieq, is topped with a cavetto cornice (pi. 3: l).1 This building was once part of a structure which Maltese archaeologists believe to be a Punic temple.2 At the end of South Street in Valletta there is also part of a wall which is topped by a cavetto cornice (pi. 3: 2). Although the cornice and the building blocks are similar to those of the Zurrieq remains, this construction may have been built in more recent times. During excavations at Tas-Silg, carried out in 1969 by a team from the La Sapienza University of Rome, many stone reliefs and objects exhibiting Egyptian influence were uncovered. Among them is a stone block, part of a column, which presents a lotus flower carved in high relief similar to an Egyptian composite capital. This stone block was described by the expedition as a votive fragment, or perhaps as being part of an altar, since it was found in the sanctuary area.3 It is made of grey granite and measures about 80 cm in height and about 50 cm in width. The engraving conforms to the Egyptian connotation of the papyrus * I should like to thank Ms Suzannah Depasquale, Assistant Curator at the National Museum of Archaeology, Valletta, for providing me with the photographs and assistance for this work. I also want to thank Ms Maria Ellul for her patient help and advice during the preparation of the manuscript. 1 The elevation of the building is 5.64 m from ground level, the height of the courses varies around 0.66 m, and some of the well-dressed and jointed blocks exceed 1.83 m in length. The walls, all 48 cm thick, consist of a massive, well-fitted ashlar masonry laid without mortar. The walls are topped by an Egyptian cavetto cornice, a feature that recalls the statement of Diodorus Siculus (V 12) that local buildings were decorated in this manner. (See for this T. C. Gouder, 'Phoenician Malta', Heritage 10,1978, 181^, who mentions that the edifice was first described in the 18th century by Jean Houel, who also drew a plan of the building showing the state of preservation at the time, and that the same building was noted in 1909 by Albert Mayr who published a photograph of the surviving part; still according to Gouder ibid., Thomas Ashby considered it to be pre-Roman and more specifically belonging to the Phoenician period.) Archaeological soundings made by The National Museum of Archaeology, Valletta, in 1938 and in 1964 were not conclusive, but the building has been dated to the Punic period, since there existed in the area the well-known temple of Melkart or Hercules: see G. Holbl, Agyptisches Kulturgut auf den Inseln Malta und Gozo in phônizischer und punischer Zeit (1989) 146-7. Tombs found in the areas of the great ports of Ghajn Dwieli, Tal-Liedna, and Tal-Horr date from this period and are considered to be Phoenician and associated with the settlement of which the building was part, probably a temple: see A. J. Frendo-N. Vella, 'Les Iles phéniciennes du milieu de la mer', Dossiers d'Archéologie 267, 2001, 49-50; A. Bonanno, 'Egyptian Iconography in Ancient Maltese Art', in: Treasures of Malta, II/3 (1996) 43-7; id., Malta, an Archaeological Paradise (1991) 51-5. 2 The wall and cornice present the same type of construction as used in ancient Egypt. The rectangular blocks imitate the bundles of papyrus reeds used in the construction of prehistoric temple roofs, from which the cavetto cornice originated. These cornices were brilliantly painted on the temple of Thutmosis III. They had two wooden flag masts sheathed in gold: see W. C. Hayes, The Scepter of Egypt: a background for the study of the Egyptian antiquities in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, II: The Hyksos period and the New Kingdom (1675-1080 B.C.) (1990) 75-6. The stone adaptation was later adopted in Phoenician and Punic architecture, and above all in the Greek temple: see R. H. Wilkinson, Symbol and Magic in Egyptian Art (1994) 20^18. 3 aavv., Scavi a Tas-Silg: Missione archeologica italiana a Malta, Rapporto preliminare della campagna 1963-1970 (1973) pi. 11: 1-2; see also Holbl op. cit. 152-3.

Meza and the lotus flower as representations of the goddess Hathor and the sun god.4 An ornament with a similar design of palm volutes was also unearthed at Tas-Silg, within the sanctuary remains. The ornament measures 7.6 cm and belongs to the 7th—6th centuries bc.5 In the same area there were some limestone fragments that may have been part of an architectural design. They measure 11 cm in height and date from the 7th—6th centuries bc. They are similar to other fragments found at Rabat which seem to have been part of a thymiaterion rather than of an architectural element, since they present an Egyptian funerary design. These incense burners, made of local limestone, are shaped as 'djed' pillars, symbol of the god Osiris. Some of them are in the National Museum of Archaeology at Valletta; others are in the Museum of St Paul in St Agatha's House, Rabat (pi. 3: 3). A torch holder made of bronze presents a papyrus-like design. It was discovered in 1950 in a tomb at Ghajn Qajjet, Rabat, and is today in the National Museum of Archaeology, Valletta. It measures 14 cm in height and is of the same date as the ornaments and incense burners.6 A stone relief exhibited at the Archaeological Museum of Gozo depicts an enormous serpent with a triangular head, apparently a cobra.7 The slab measures about 120 cm in height and is some 50 cm wide (pi. 4: 1). It is made of pink granite and the serpent, carved in high relief at the front, coils upright covering the entire height (pi. 4: 2). Since in Egyptian iconography this serpent represents the goddess Wadjet from the north of Egypt, it seems likely that the relief had a ritual function. An almost identical engraving depicting an upright, coiling cobra was found in Egypt and belonged to a door jamb from a temple dedicated to King Djoser of the Third Dynasty.8 Amulets are, by far, the most numerous Egyptian and Egyptianizing objects found in the Maltese Islands. For instance, an amulet sheath containing a rolled-up piece of papyrus was found within a tomb which was accidentally destroyed during the construction of a water cistern at Tal-Virtu, Rabat. The amulet was recovered by Dr Daniel Micallef MP, and presented to the National Museum of Archaeology in Valletta. It is made of bronze and is shaped as a standing figure with a falcon's head, surmounted by a solar disc and a rearing uraeus. At the back of the head there is a ring attached behind the solar disc. Most of the upper part of the talisman has survived, but the lower tubular part is largely eroded and has been restored.9 The small rolled-up piece of papyrus bears the representation of the goddess Isis and a Phoenician inscription summoning the deceased to overcome the perils of the voyage to the 4 The Tas-Silg temple was dedicated to the goddess Astarte who was identified with Hera by the Greeks and with Juno by the Romans: see Gouder art cit. 175; Holbl op. cit. 152-3. These goddesses were also identified with Hathor, Isis, and the Nabatean AT Uzza: see A. Meza, 'An Egyptian Statuette in Petra', JARCE 32,1995,179-83. 5 It is made of ivory and shows traces of gilding on both sides: Gouder art. cit. 175,180. 6 Ibid. 176,179; Holbl op. cit. 170-1. 7 According to the archives of the Archaeological Museum of Gozo, the relief, which is unpublished, was found in Gozo and dates from the Neolithic period of Malta (between 5000 and 4100 bc). According to A. A. Rodriguez Casal, 'Megalithism in Spain', unpublished lecture given at the XHIth UISPP Congress in Forli in 1996, a similar stone relief was found in Spain near a megalithic temple. I also had the opportunity to observe a coiling cobra depicted on one of the walls of an unexcavated tomb located on the left side of the entrance to Petra, Jordan. No plan or drawings have been made of this tomb but the cobra is usually shown by the local tour guides. 8 Z. Hawass, Ά Fragmentary Monument of Djoser from Saqqara', JEA 80. 1994, 44-55. The door jamb was part of the exhibition on Egyptian Art in the Age of the Pyramids, held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York from September 1999 to January 2000. 9 The amulet measures 4.85 cm in height. The surviving piece of papyrus found inside the amulet measures about 7 sq. cm: see T. Zammit, Archaeological Field Notes I, 1905-1907; T. C. Gouder, 'Phoenician Malta', Heritage 16, 1978, 311-15. The cylindrical amulet may be a parallel in design to other falcon-headed amulets found in Sardinia, Spain, and Carthage. They all date from the 7th—5th centuries bc according to Holbl op. cit. 114-23.</page><page sequence="3">Ancient Egyptian Art in Malta 101 underworld (fig. 1). The goddess is depicted in typical New Kingdom iconography. She carries the Isis sign on her head and wears a sheath dress with a sash at her waist fastened by the 'Isis knot'.

A beautiful composite gold amulet representing the mummified figures of Anubis and Horus was found by T. Zammit in 1906 in a rock-cut tomb at Ghajn Klieb, west of Rabat (pi. 4: 3).11 The two figures stand back to back, each on a base of 5 χ 5 mm. Both gods wear a solar disc on their heads. In their right hands they hold a flail, and in their left an ankh}1 The solid gold amulet measures 2.5 cm and weighs 9.15 g. It has been dated to the 7th-6th centuries bc. The mixed Egyptian iconography indicates that the provenance of this artefact is not Egyptian, but that it was probably made in a Phoenician workshop.13 A pair of silver jewels covered with gold leaf and five gold beads were found in the same tomb. The jewels were part of a bracelet and are engraved on top with a winged sun flanked by a Phoenician motif of two rampant griffins. At their centre there is a multiple palm-leaf or perhaps a lotus flower (pi. 4: 4). Although these motifs are Egyptian, the bracelet was probably produced in Phoenicia. Near the composite amulet and the iron ornaments there was a green-blue glass bead, with dark blue spirals surrounding a raised spot, also in blue.14 On 3 December, 1926, Zammit opened another rock-cut tomb at Nigret, near Rabat, where he found several scarab rings, which were described in his report.15 The scarabs, all inscribed at the back, measure about 0.8 cm in length. One of the rings is made of bronze with a scarab of green faience. The inscription at the back reads: nb htp s3, i.e. 'the lord is peace and protection'. Another ring, also with a faience scarab, has the name Sebek-htp inscribed on the Figure 1. National Museum of Archaeology, Valletta.

No proper recording was made and the more attractive objects were distributed among visitors. The tomb had clearly been reused several times and it was impossible to date all the objects properly, but as some of them surely date from the 25th-26th Dynasties, the two jewels are believed to be of the same date. One of them is now in the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, the other in the National Museum of Archaeology, Valletta: see M. Murray, 'Egyptian Objects Found in Malta, Ancient Egypt 13, 1928, 45-51; Holbl op. cit. 98-9; Gouder art. cit. (η. 1) 178. 12 Although the figures are soldered together, it seems that they were originally two separate amulets. This could confirm my suspicion that the amulets are not the representations of Horus and Anubis, but of two sons of Horus, namely Qebehsenuf and Duamutef. 13 Gouder art. cit. (η. 9) 311, 313; A.

Meza back.16 A third ring with a white steatite scarab was found in a tomb at Kallilia.17 The inscription at the back reads: Hnsw m S, 'Honsw is protection'. This ring dates from the 26th Dynasty. Another ring from the same period, with a scarab made of blue faience, was found in another rock-cut tomb at Rabat.18 It is inscribed at the back H3 Hr, 'Horus of the papyrus bush'. At the Archaeological Museum of Gozo there are several amulets that seem to be Egyptian imports, since their craftsmanship is flawless (col. pl. I: 1). They range from 1.5 cm to 4.5 cm in height and are made of faience. Some amulets are of a green colour, others are blue. There are green and blue wedjat eyes, the god Bes, and the goddess Taweret, and the gods Ptah Patecus and Amon-Ra. This group was found at Tal-Horob, Xewkija, Gozo in 1951 and dates from the 5th-4th centuries bc.19 It seems they were strung together in a necklace of faience beads. There is also a djed pillar and a w3s sign, both made of faience, which were found in a tomb at Bingemma, near Rabat in 1927. They date from the 7th—6th centuries bc. A crook in blue and white glass could be an Egyptian import, but most probably it is a good Phoenician imitation of the Osirian implements held by the dead Pharaoh (col. pl. I: 2). A striding Horus figure with a back pillar, symbolizing the reigning king, carries in his right hand an ankh sign. The amulet has a loop at the rear to be strung on a cord or thread. Amazingly, this assemblage of amulets resembles, and almost conforms to, the one found in a tomb of the 26th Dynasty at Giza.20 Every amulet is similarly represented in the Gozitan assemblage, conforming to the spells of the Egyptian Book of the Dead, which prescribes how each amulet is to be positioned on the mummy's body. This corroborates the idea that the Gozitan assemblage is an Egyptian import.21 An uninventoried stone relief in the St Paul Catacombs depicts an assemblage of surgical tools (col. pl. I: 3; pi. 5: l).22 It is made of grey granite and measures about 80 cm in height and 60 cm in width. The carving is made in high relief and is divided into horizontal registers, of which the upper two are visible; the rest of the stone is erased. This relief is almost identical—except for a slight variation in the type of tools—with one on a wall of the temple in Kom Ombo in Egypt (pi. 5: 2; fig. 2). This temple dates from the Greco-Roman period; it was begun under Ptolemy V and completed under Macrinus. In the external corridor of the temple there is a scene in which the emperor Trajan is kneeling in front of two goddesses, a god, and a table covered with instruments. Among the instruments are knives, drills, saws, variously shaped pincers, incense burners, hooks, bags tied with strings, Horus eyes, a papyrus scroll without side knot, heavy shears, and spoons. Some of these instruments have been discovered in tombs. The instruments engraved on the St Paul Catacombs' relief can be matched with those mentioned above. For instance, the heavy shears, the pincers of various 16 Murray art. cit. 50-1 indicates that this scarab belongs to the 13th Dynasty. It was originally blue but is now bleached white. W. M. F. Petrie suggested that either the ring or the tomb had been reused. Petrie also indicated that there was a considerable amount of foreign intercourse with Egypt at this time and the ring probably did not belong to the burial found in this tomb, and that, although there was a well-known Cretan connection, this find may indicate an Egyptian trade with a more westerly region. 17 See Annual Report Malta Museum 1916-17,10. 18 Murray art. cit. 50-1; Holb op. cit. 84-90. 19 Gouder art. cit.

These tools are usually called surgical, which is probably correct, as the oldest depiction of a circumcision suggests: carved on a wall of a 6th-Dynasty tomb, it depicts a stone knife as being used for the purpose (see P. Ghalioungui, Magic and Medical Science in Ancient Egypt [1973] 100-2 pl. 17; J. Worth Estes, The Medical Skills of Ancient Egypt [1989] 52-5). 24 Hobl op. cit. 132-5 pl. 18. 25 The tombs are rock-cut shaft graves with inhumations of Phoenician type, with a sepulchral chamber hewn out of the rock at the bottom of the shaft: see Gouder art. cit.

The lid was fastened by clamps, probably made of lead, inserted into dovetailed cavities on the back of the head, at the sides, and at the feet. The sarcophagus is crafted in a typical Egyptian style and resembles the anthropoid sarcophagi found at Deir el Balah in southern Israel by a team of The Hebrew University and published by T. Dothan in 1967.26 This ancient Philistine town was a garrison under Egyptian control during the New Kingdom and the Deir el-Balah sarcophagi probably belong to ancient Egyptian government officials or to their military commanders. Similar Egyptianizing sarcophagi were also found 97 in Jordan and are today at the Amman National Museum. The torso of an Egyptian statue now in the National Museum of Archaeology at Valletta, comes from an unknown context (col. pl. II: 1-2). It is made of white limestone and, although it is very damaged, chemical analysis of its material indicated that its area of manufacture was the Egyptian Delta.28 The statue is the bust of a woman wearing a wig with a tripartite hairstyle and two long tresses framing the face. At the back the hair reaches the mid-torso. The bust measures 42 cm in height on the side, and 47 cm on the back since it is broken on the base, front, and side. This type of funerary bust had an amorphous torso and was part of an ancestor's burial ritual. The Valletta bust is similar to the one in the collection 9Q of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, which may come from Deir el Medina. In 1828, during the work for the foundations of the British Hospital at Bighi, labourers found three limestone stelae inscribed with hieroglyphs.30 The three stelae are now in the storerooms of the British Museum in London.31 The largest fragment (no. 233) measures 50 cm in height, is round-topped, and only partially preserved (pi. 6: 2). It dates from the time of Amenenhat III and belonged to the coppersmith Ankef and his wife Ifert. The second stele (no. 287) is very fragmented and presents part of an enthroned Osiris, an offering table, and a kneeling worshipper. It belongs to the scribe Tety. The last stele (no. 218, pi. 6: 3) is round topped and in much better condition than the others. It belongs to the deceased Har-Imit who is holding a lotus flower to her nostrils. These two stelai are early New Kingdom, and they are Egyptian imports since their material is Egyptian limestone. Although the stelae were found in the grounds of an ancient temple, they were perhaps discarded there by a much later visitor. Possibly the Romans or an early European traveller to Egypt brought them there. The context is unknown, as is their provenance. The last, but not the least, of the Egyptian objects in Malta is the statue of the priest Nefer'Abu from Deir el-Medina, which was long thought to be lost but has recently reappeared in the storerooms of the National Museum of Archaeology at Valletta. It is made of beautiful white limestone and measures 41.5 cm from the base to the top of the head. The sides of the base measure 13 cm in width and 16.7 cm in length. The upper pedestal measures 26 Excavations at the cemetery of Deir-el Balah, Quedem 10 (1979) 100-3; ead., The Philistines and their material culture (1982) 252-68. 27 Two types of sarcophagi were found in Deir ei-Balah. Type A has a mummiform shape, and the arms and hands are not shown on the body. This is the type that has been found in Malta and Jordan. Type B, however, is called grotesque and has very small arms and hands that are shown outside the shroud: see Holbl op. cit. 134-6. 28 Ibid. 195-9. 29 See A.

The priest is offering two figurines: one is the goddess Maat, the other Re-Harakhti.32 In conclusion, the great number of objects of Egyptian origin and those of Egyptianizing craftsmanship constitute a large collection in the Maltese Islands.33 The first objects appearing in the archaeological record are contemporary with the hegemony of Phoenicia and Carthage over the Mediterranean trade routes. These objects were, probably, all Egyptian imports. Afterwards, Phoenicians, Carthaginians, and even ancient Maltese began imitating these imports and incorporating Egyptian funerary rituals into their own mortuary practices, setting up their own workshops on the islands. During Hellenistic times the impact of the Egyptian pantheon continued to be felt as far as Spain. All sorts of Egyptian features, even if poorly understood, were introduced into Mediterranean mortuary practices. The Maltese shared with the Egyptians a real obsession with death. The difference is that for the Egyptians, death meant eternal life in the 'Field of Reeds', whereas for the Maltese death was an unknown and uncertain voyage. All the funerary material imported from Egypt, or crafted in Maltese workshops, aimed at giving ancient Maltese some reassurance in this rite of passage. The uncertainty about death remained in their culture for centuries to come, perhaps until the Maltese converted to Christianity, finally embracing a concept of eternal life, not unlike that of the ancient Egyptians. 32 This statue was first published in C. S. Sonnini, Travels in Upper and Lower Egypt (1799) 335-6, then by R. Moss, 'An Egyptian Statuette in Malta', JEA 36, 1949, 132-4. It is also described by M. L.
