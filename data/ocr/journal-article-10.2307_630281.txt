On the one hand, Hellenists lose interest in the Greeks after the classical period; on the other, Roman historians find it hard to avoid a Romanocentric perspective. This double prejudice becomes particularly acute when the issue is the religious language used by the Greeks to refer to the Roman emperor. For example, the Greeks called the living emperor both theou huios ('son of god') and also theos ('god'). The language looks odd from the perspectives both of classical Athens and of imperial Rome. One way to make sense of it is to treat it as a translation out of Latin. Thus the bizarre practice of calling the emperor theou huios is seen as perfectly natural because it is simply the translation of divi flius. Why natural? Because, as the heirs of Rome, we can attempt to ignore the cultural differences between us and the ancient world. But the tactic of treating Greek as a translation out of Latin does not always work. Calling the living emperor theos cannot be seen as a translation of divus, a term which applies only to dead emperors. Modern scholars are therefore forced to treat the usage as 'deviant', the product of either folly or flattery. In fact the failure of theos to translate divus undermines the first assumption that theou huios is a translation of divi flius. The first section of this article examines the usage of theos, both in general and in relation to the Roman emperor; it shows that theos is a very different term from divus and that its predication of the emperor must be understood in a Greek context. The second section explores some of the implications of this point by looking at other related aspects of the language used both in describing and in addressing the emperor in religious contexts. The third and final section reflects on the significance of this language for our understanding of Greek religion. Does theos compare unfavourably with 'God'? Does its predication of the emperor fit the common view of the Greek gods as anthropomorphic? I Theos, though a basic term of Greek religion, has never been given a detailed semantic study.2 Scholars, in their eagerness to examine what the Greeks thought about their gods, have generally not paused to consider the prior question-what does theos mean? There is, however, one point of general agreement: theos is not a name, like 'Tiberius'.3 Take, for example, the two sentences 'This is Tiberius' and 'This is a theos'. The first is, logically speaking, a statement of identity; it merely asserts the identity of 'This' and 'Tiberius' without adding any other information. By contrast, 'This is a theos' has the same grammatical form as the first sentence, but is logically different. It says something about the subject of the sentence; that is, theos is a (logical) predicate.4 So far so good. But what sort of predicate is theos? What were the conditions for its use? As a preliminary move I want to set out three possible types of predicate. There are, first, 1 I should like to thank Mary Beard and Lucia Nixon who have greatly improved this article. The analysis runs parallel to that of my book Rituals and power: the Roman imperial cult in Asia Minor (Cambridge 1984). I refer to corpora of inscriptions by the standard abbre- viations; those not listed by J. J. E. Hondius, Saxa loquuntur (Leiden 1938) are mainly to be found in the series Inschriften griechischer Stlidte aus Kleinasien (Bonn 1972- ). 2 See, however, W. P6tscher, Theos.

Straw- son, Subject and predicate in logic and grammar (London 1974). Of course it is possible to convert theos into a name by adding the definite article. 'This is the theos' is comparable to 'This is Tiberius'.</page><page sequence="2">80o S. R. F. PRICE predicates such as 'is a Knight', which are simply a matter of human ascription. X 'is a Knight' if and only if he has been made a Knight by the monarch. The predicate does not inform one of X's nature or characteristics. A second class of predicate is exemplified by Roman Catholic uses of'is a Saint'. The ascription of this status is unlike the arbitrary dubbing of a Knight. A decision is made by a body of the Roman Catholic Church (the Congregation for the Causes of Saints), but the elaborate procedure is designed to discover the facts of the case.5 Was the 'candidate' really a perfect exemplar of the holy life? The final ceremony, performed by the Pope, does not so much create as recognize a Saint. Thirdly, predicates like 'is a person' lack clear criteria for use. The paradigm case of'is a person' is an adult human being of 'normal' intelligence and physique, who has both rights and responsibilities. But when one or more of the features of the paradigm are absent (as with a foetus immediately after conception, or a patient suffering from irreparable brain damage) it ceases to be clear that the predicate still applies. Irresolvable arguments arise because the predicate 'is a person', like 'is a Saint', claims to recognize the way things are; but, unlike 'is a Saint', it has no institutional control. To which of these three categories does theos belong? No ancient source offers a semantic analysis of theos and we therefore have to tease out assumptions which were not normally made explicit. A Greek debate on the limits of polytheism shows that the term theos is in fact comparable to 'person'. Carneades, a member of the Academic school of philosophy in the second century BC, propounded a series of arguments about the gods, which proceed on a 'little by little' basis from secure premises to unacceptable conclusions. One specimen of these arguments, as reported by Cicero, runs:6 If gods exist, are the nymphs also goddesses? If the nymphs are, are the Pans and Satyrs also gods? But they are not gods; therefore the nymphs also are not gods. Yet they possess temples vowed and dedicated to them by the nation. Therefore the other gods who have had temples dedicated to them are not gods either.7 Cicero makes clear that Carneades did not advance these arguments 'with the object of establishing atheism ..., but in order to prove Stoic theology worthless'. One part of the Stoic project was a rational theology which proposed to justify popular polytheism by showing that the innumerable individual deities were aspects of one cosmic deity. Carneades' aim was to show that this project was a failure because of its inability to discriminate between deities such as Zeus, whose divinity was not in question, and other beings who were clearly not gods. He placed the Stoics in a fork: either nothing is god or everything is god. Carneades' concern was not to draw out the semantic implications of his 'little by little' reasoning, but his arguments are of interest in this context because they appeal to common Greek usage; his case against the Stoics was telling only if his own usage oftheos was not aberrant. Arguments of similar type can be used on numerous other predicates (e.g. ones concerning size or colour), but Carneades' arguments (the most celebrated ones of this type in antiquity) do help to characterize the term theos. They make clear that there were no uncontroversial criteria for the predication of theos. The boundaries of the concept were not unequivocally defined. The implication of this is that theos is the same sort of predicate as 'person'. Admittedly theos has sometimes been seen as 'a sort of rank or status achieved through merit, with no implication whatever of divine nature .... Essentially the conferring of divinity was a political act that s P. Molinari, New Catholic Encyclopedia iii (1967) 55-9. 6 Sextus Empiricus, contra mathematicos ix I82-9o and Cicero, de natura deorum iii 43-52, quoted from 43: 'si di sunt, suntne etiam Nymphae deae? si Nymphae, Panisci etiam et Satyri? hi autem non sunt; ne Nymphae [deae] quidem igitur. at earum templa sunt publice vota et dedicata. ne ceteri quidem ergo di, quorum templa sunt dedicata.' See on this type of argument P. Couissin, 'Les sorites de Carneade contre le polytheisme', REG liv (1941) 43-57; J. Barnes, 'Medicine, experience and logic', in Science and Speculation, ed. J. Barnes et al. (Cambridge 1982) 24-68; and esp. M. F. Burnyeat, 'Gods and heaps', in Language and logos, ed. M. Schofield, M. C. Nussbaum (Cambridge 1982) 315-38. 7 Cicero's use of the argument shows that deus is comparable to theos.</page><page sequence="3">GODS AND EMPERORS 81 granted honours due for benefactions.'8 In other words theos is like Knight-a purely honorific term. My argument places it in a quite different category. Unlike 'is a Knight' and 'is a Saint' there were no institutional controls and no uncontroversial criteria for the use of 'is a theos'. As with 'is a person', 'is a theos' makes a statement about the world which is not based on human fiat. There are unproblematic uses of both concepts (e.g. of Zeus or of healthy adults) but at the edges problems arose. Were the nymphs, or satyrs, or emperors theoi? The elasticity of the term meant that the emperor could be included. We need now to see in some detail how theos was predicated of the emperor. Was its predication of the emperor aberrant in comparison to its predication of the traditional gods? How are we to explain its seemingly random usage? Theos was predicated quite commonly of both Hellenistic kings and Roman emperors. As early as the fourth century Bc one Greek writer commented that it was easier for Philip of Macedon now to become a theos than it had been for him to reach his present position of political supremacy.9 Alexander and his successors were from time to time called theoi, both in their lifetimes and posthumously.1' In Egypt there were official cults of the Theoi Adelphoi ('God Brothers') and Theoi Soteres ('God Saviours'),"1 and Antiochos IV of Syria (175-164 Bc) placed, for the first time, the title of theos on his coins.12 The term was also applied sporadically in the second and first centuries BC to Roma, the personification of the power of Rome.13 The Roman emperors did not use theos of themselves when communicating in Greek with their subjects.14 The significant exception was Gaius who railed against a Jewish embassy because the Jews failed to recognize him as a theos.15 Claudius, Gaius' successor, reasserted the norm of imperial behaviour in publicly criticising Gaius' foolish and mad attempt to force the Jews to call him theos.'6 Despite the standard imperial attitude, the Greek subjects of the emperor repeatedly referred to him as theos. There are numerous uses in the lifetime of Augustus,17 and this continues through the first and second centuries AD.18 However, in the third century theos was rarely applied to a living emperor;19 instead the adjectival form theios ('divine') was used.20 The expectation that a ruler would be acclaimed as theos is neatly illustrated by the aspirations of an outsider. Both Jewish and Christian sources note that Herod Agrippa, the Roman client ruler ofJudaea, was called theos, and was immediately struck down by the True God for his presumption.21 The uses of theos in imperial contexts are similar to two of its uses in connection with the traditional gods. First, 'the theos' on its own could refer unambiguously to the emperor. For example, a text recording the building of imperial temples and the celebrating of imperial festivals by a local benefactor twice says that he displayed piety towards 'the god'.22 The reference to the emperor, Augustus, was clear. Similarly the assembly of the province of Asia when reforming the calendar to begin on Augustus' birthday talks easily about 'the birthday of the god' and about the earlier decision of the assembly 'that a crown be awarded to the one 8 D.

PRICE suggesting the greatest honours for the god'.23 There was no need for the assembly to spell out that 'the god' was Augustus. This use of theos to refer to whichever particular deity was in mind at the time can be documented as early as Homer.24 Secondly, theos was added to the name of the emperor (e.g. theos Nero).25 Some scholars have suggested that this usage was peculiar to imperial contexts and implicitly distinguished the emperor from the traditional gods, who did not need to be called theos.26 In fact the same usage is found in connection with the gods. By the imperial period it was common to refer to theos Dionysos or thea Aphrodite.27 While theos was sometimes used when the standing of the deity had been threatened28 or as part of a phrase in apposition to the name of the diety (such as 'the leading gods Artemis and Apollo'),29 in most cases theos is added to the bare name of the god without any discernible reason for emphasis.30 Thus the use of 'theos Nero' is not a mark of uncertainty about the emperor's status; it is in line with contemporary religious usage. There was considerable fluidity in the uses of theos. First, it was employed in both religious and non-religious situations. While the inscriptions below imperial statues in the sanctuaries of the gods sometimes called the emperor theos,31 statues erected elsewhere in secular contexts were described in the same way,32 and secular buildings such as porticoes, theatres and baths were dedicated to the theoi emperors.33 Secondly, within religious contexts the emperor was called theos in what seems a haphazard fashion. Priesthoods, for example, sometimes simply give the name of the emperor and sometimes add theos or another divine name. Thus only a quarter of the civic priesthoods of Augustus term him theos in his lifetime.34 The flexibility of usage is illustrated by the difference between the titles of the two priesthoods of Augustus held by one man from Bargylia in Caria in about AD 80.35 This man was high priest of the goddess Roma and of the god Sebastos Caesar (either in another town or in the provincial assembly), high priest of Emperor Titus and priest of Artemis Kindyas and Sebastos Caesar (both at Bargylia). This all seems very confusing, as if the Greeks used theos completely at random. In fact the reason for the variability in usage is that there were no institutional procedures nor established criteria controlling the predication of theos of the emperor. When a city came to pass a decree it was not concerned to debate the status of theos but to establish a cult of the emperor.36 The clearest expression of the procedure is a decree of the city of Acraephiae passed after Nero had restored freedom to Greece.37 23 R.

'Since Nero the lord of the whole universe, greatest emperor, holding the tribunician power for the thirteenth time elect, father of his country, dawned as a new Sun for the Greeks, especially chosen to benefit Greece, and revered our gods in return for the fact that they had always stood beside him for his care and protection; and, being the one and only emperor for all time, mightiest philhellenic Nero Zeus Eleutherios (Zeus of Freedom) gave, granted and restored the indigenous and immemorial freedom previously removed from the Greeks to its ancient condition of autonomy and freedom ...; therefore it was decided by the magistrates, councillors and people to dedicate for the present an altar by [the statue of] Zeus the Saviour, inscribing it "to Zeus Eleutherios Nero for ever" and to establish statues in the temple of Apollo Ptoiosjointly with our ancestral gods of Nero Zeus Eleutherios and of Thea Sebaste Messalina. ...' The city did not have an elaborate procedure with clear criteria, like that of the Vatican for canonization, which unequivocally judged that Nero was to be identified with Zeus Eleutherios. The emperor had made a magnanimous restoration of freedom and the city responded with a decision to establish a cult. The terminology and the associated procedure for divinizing an emperor were very different in Rome. There the official position was clear. The emperor was not a deus ('god') in his lifetime, but after his death he might be made a divus.38 In the Republican period divus and deus had been used interchangeably; two scholars of the first century BC (Varro and Ateius) attempted to distinguish between the terms, saying that divi were eternal but dei (like the dii manes, or spirits of the dead) were honoured because of their consecration.39 In fact their prescriptive definition was unsuccessful; the two terms were distinguished in official usage, but in the reverse sense. From the cult of the deceased Julius Caesar onwards divus referred exclusively in official terminology to former emperors and members of their family. They were thus distinguished from the traditional dei.40 There were a standard procedure and clear criteria for the creation of a divus. After the emperor's funeral the senate met and could decide to establish an official cult of the former emperor (or to do nothing, or to damn the emperor's memory). In the first century AD, five emperors and eight members of the imperial family received these 'heavenly honours'.41 This may all sound very 'political', but despite pressures, the procedure was not like the arbitrary dubbing of a knight. The senate, like the Vatican, was traditionally the supreme religious arbiter and in the case of former emperors it took a decision on the basis of the report of a witness who had seen the soul of the emperor rising to heaven.

It was also a definitive recognition. When the senate had decided, there was none of the semantic fuzziness about divus which is characteristic of the predication of theos. The Greeks did not create a category comparable to divus. It was not that they were ignorant of the official Roman system. Roman silver coinage, which circulated widely in the Greek world, featured the Roman titles. Milestones, put up by the Roman authorities, generally gave the emperor's titles.42 Letters from the emperor to Greek cities started with the full official titulature. For example, a letter from Nero to Rhodes begins: 'Nero Claudius, son of theos Claudius, grandson of Tiberius Caesar Sebastos and Germanicus Caesar, greatgrandson of theos Sebastos, Caesar Sebastos Germanicus, high priest, holding tribunician power, to the magistrates, council and people of Rhodes, greetings.'43 The emperor refers correctly to Claudius and Augustus, and not to Tiberius and Germanicus, as deified. The Greeks thus knew that in Rome the living emperor was not deus or divus and they could tell which emperors were divifilius. But they did not establish a simple term as a precise translation of divus. Occasional periphrases, such as 'the heavenly emperor' or 'the emperor among the gods', were employed, mainly in heavily Romanized contexts,44 but generally the term used was theos. It is therefore tempting to suppose that theou huios can be seen as a translation of divifilius. The numerous instances of the phrase theou huios in imperial titles in documents produced by the Greeks themselves might seem to be translations from Latin bearing the same meaning as the 'original'.45 They may indeed often function as equivalents of the Latin divifilius, but their meaning cannot be the same since they form part of a different conceptual system.46 The theos element of theou huios retained the elusivity of the common Greek usage of theos. So, while it was impossible to refer to the living emperor as divifilius divus, because he only became divus after his death, the Greeks could refer to the living emperor as theou huios theos ('god, son of god'). For example, a statue was erected of 'Emperor Caesar, son of theos, theos Sebastos, who has performed incomparable deeds for all people'.47 This modified phrase could even be used in conjunction with 'translations' of further Roman titles. In the lifetime of Augustus there was a 'priest of Roma and Emperor Caesar, son of theos, theos Sebastos, high priest and father of his country'.48 The fact that the Greeks could use theou huios theos, even in conjunction with other Roman titles, shows that they did not regard the simple theou huios in the same way as the Romans saw divifilius. It had a different range of evocations, forming part of a radically different conceptual system. 42 E.g. IGR iii 82, 138, 145; iv 267, 599-601.

W. Pleket, HThR lviii [1965] 338-41). It is also wrong to imagine that Sebastos is an exact translation of the Latin Augustus. It did indeed become the standard equivalent almost instan- taneously (e.g. SEG xxvi 1243 = I.Ephesos iii 902), but its semantic motivation is more strongly religious than Augustus. It also functioned differently; 'the Sebastoi' may refer to two joint Augusti, but it may equally refer to a sole emperor and his collective ancestors: e.g. IGR iv 1676 (Apollonia, Mysia; AD 40--); IGR iv 15o9 = Sardis vii.i 45 (c. AD 80); IGR iii 493 (Oenoanda; Trajanic); IG v.1 380 (Sparta; AD 15). 46 Thus the question whether theou huios was used of someone who was not divifilius is irrelevant to my case. 47 IGR iv 201 =I.Ilion 81: A3TOKpa70opa KaL'aapa OEoQ vUdv OE8v 2E[pa]UTordV, vd7rE#pfA-Tro ts 97rpaoEULtv KEX[P)IE'VOV KaL EUEpYEUlaLS9 7T1S EtS a"7TraV]TaS dv0pdnrovs. Cf.

The thrust of the Greek system was towards the figure of the reigning emperor, and cults (i.e. priests or temples) are attested for almost all the reigning emperors in the first century AD. In particular, as we have already seen (p. 8 i), theos was frequently used of the living emperor. The creation of a divus made little difference in the Greek world. Greek cults were generally not initiated specifically for a divus;49 indeed cults of the reigning emperor did not often outlast his reign, even if he was deified in Rome. When, as with cults of Augustus, they did endure, the Roman ceremonial made no difference. The titles of civic priesthoods of Augustus continued to refer to him in different ways, sometimes as theos, sometimes not.50 Some scholars tend to treat theos as meaningful only when it translates divus. This view of the relationship between the Greek and Roman systems seems to lie behind the modern dictionaries of Greek terms for Roman institutions.5 The Greek entries in such dictionaries are deemed to have meaning only as bits of ersatz-Latin. That is, correctness of translation is the sole criterion of significance. Of course, if a Greek wanted to say divi filius he would say theou huios, but functional equivalence is not the same thing as identity of meaning.52 Compare, for example, the French, German and Turkish words used in the same alcoholic context as 'Cheers!': sante, prost and gerefe are functional equivalents, but have quite different 'meanings'-'health', 'advantage' and 'honour'. Nor can the minds or intentions of the Greek speakers serve as a criterion of meaning independent of the two languages.53 Intentions may indeed be independent of languages, but they do not give meaning to words. Humpty Dumpty was wrong to say that when he used a word it meant just what he chose to make it mean. We should therefore not imagine that the Greeks were really thinking in Latin, but had the misfortune to express themselves in Greek. The predication of theos of the emperor, though it is in certain contexts equivalent to divus in Latin, has meaning in the context of general Greek usage of theos. II Theos belongs to a range of Greek religious terms which will repay analysis. In part this will fill out our understanding of theos. After all, no term can be understood on its own; comparison and contrast are essential.54 In addition, analysis of the whole set of terms will show how they locate the emperor between human and divine. The argument involves a challenge to our Christianizing assumptions. We have strong views about the nature of God and how He should be addressed, but our ideas about the invisibility of God and the importance of prayers do not necessarily apply to the Greek world. The analysis will fall into two sections: first, the religious terms used to describe the emperor and his cult; secondly, the religious language addressed to the emperor. (i) An analysis of the religious descriptions of the emperor may begin with the practice of assimilating the emperor to particular named deities.55 This practice, which we have already noted briefly (p. 83), is a stronger variant of the general predication of theos.

Ziff, Semantic Analysis (Ithaca 1960). An obvious area of contrast, which I do not discuss here, is between 'god' and 'hero': see Price (n. I) esp. ch. 2.

PRICE emperor and god are sometimes simply collocated ('Tiberius Claudius Caesar Sebastos Germanicus Zeus Saviour and Agrippina Sebaste Demeter Karpophoros [Harvest-bringer]');56 sometimes they are separated by neos ('new'): ('Emperor Caesar Trajan Hadrian new Dionysos Olympios Panhellenios').57 The most common assimilation (to give the figures for the evidence from Asia Minor) was between the emperor and Zeus (26), though twelve of the instances are for Hadrian alone. Next in frequency were assimilations with Helios (12) and Dionysos (8). Empresses were assimilated to female deities, especially Hera (18), Aphrodite ( 1) and Demeter (5). The practice of assimilating emperor and deity looks very odd to our eyes. We might be tempted to think that it implies that the emperor was an incarnation of the deity in question, but incarnation is a concept which only becomes important with the birth of Christ.58 Our difficulties arise because we cannot see how the collocation of two names (e.g. 'Tiberius' and 'Zeus') establishes a relationship between two separate beings. 'Zeus' is of course in some ways the familiar name for an individual anthropomorphic deity, but it is important to see that it can also operate as a predicate referring to a certain type of divine power (a point to which we shall return, section III). If 'Zeus' can thus operate like theos, it becomes possible to understand the addition of Zeus to the emperor's name as the predication of divine power of him. The range of such predications, which also seems confusing, is comprehensible in the light of the three-fold structures of Greek religion. First, at the most general level, there was the hierarchy of the Olympian pantheon which was recognized by all Greeks. The position of Zeus at the head of this pantheon explains why the emperor was so frequently assimilated to him; an additional reason in the case of Hadrian was his close contact with Zeus through his completion of the temple of Zeus in Athens. Secondly, at the level of individual cities, a particular deity might acquire through local cults and festivals greater importance than he or she held at the Panhellenic level. This explains many of the other assimilations. For example, it was natural to assimilate the emperor to Apollo and Asklepios in their sanctuaries on Cos.59 Thirdly, there is a small category of unique assimilations which were made in response to particular local circumstances but which did not relate to a local cult. For example, Hadrian was once assimilated to Zeus Kynegesios (Zeus of Hunting) as a result of his exploits in a bear hunt in Mysia.60 Assimilations of this sort also reflect a feature of Greek religion. It was always possible to respond to peculiar events by postulating an intervention by the appropriate deity. If assimilations tempt us to think of the Incarnation, the use of the next term theos epiphanes recalls the Epiphany-God made manifest in the world. Hellenistic kings from Ptolemy V onwards used Epiphan~s as part of their official titles, Antiochus IV of Syria combining it with theos (n. 12). The emperor too was often described as theos epiphanes or, in the superlative form, as epiphanestatos theon, 'most epiphanes of the gods'. For example, a statue base referred to Claudius as 'Tiberius Claudius Caesar Sebastos Germanicus theos epiphanFs, saviour of our people too'.61 Similarly Marcus Aurelius and Commodus were honoured as 'Emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus theon epiphanestatos, master of land and sea, and Emperor Commodus Caesar, theon epiphanestatos, master of land and sea'.62 Scholars have often seen epiphanes as 'a peculiarly 56 A.

But epiphanes is not a uniquely religious term; it has a broad range of uses in purely secular contexts, where it can best be translated not as 'manifest' but as 'distinguished' or 'prominent'. For example, countless inscriptions were set up 'in the most prominent' part of a square or sanctuary; people belonged to 'the most distinguished' (epiphanestatos) family;64 while epiphaneia could refer to the sudden 'appearance' of the enemy in battle.65 Epiphanes was thus a word with a convenient width of meaning which could refer to both divine and non-divine.66 Our preoccupation with the problem of God's presence in the world leads us to imagine that 'epiphanes' was particularly useful in solving the problem of the physical presence of the emperor in contrast with the gods who were generally not visible to human eyes. One might think that theos epiphanes was a response to the visible presence of the emperor in the provinces, but it could be used of an emperor who never visited the Greek world (n. 61). Alternatively, one might think that the use of the superlative was a way of handling the visible presence of the emperor in Rome; unlike the traditional gods, who were manifest only from time to time, the emperor was 'the most manifest of the gods'. But this idea is refuted by the fact that the traditional gods too were often described not only as theos epiphanes but also as epiphanestatos ton theon.67 Theos epiphan-s therefore seems to be applied to the emperor and the gods in the same way. Our Christianizing perspective is in danger of blinding us to the fact that the earthly presence of the emperor posed no problem for the Greeks. After all, the physical appearance of the traditional gods was always possible. For example, a second-century AD priestess at Didyma asked the oracle there for advice because she was worried 'since, from the time that I took up the priesthood, the gods have never appeared (epiphaneis) so much, both in the forms of girls and women and also in the forms of men and children'.68 These appearances which so worried the priestess were normally taken to be a sign of divine favour. An Ephesian decree of the same period claims that the worship of Artemis was extremely widespread 'because of the clear epiphaneiai that were made by her' (n. 28). The notion of epiphaneia was thus appropriate for the emperor's birthday and accession. The assembly of the province of Asia stated that 'the birthday of the god (sc. Augustus) marked for the world the beginning of good tidings through his coming'.69 The emperor's accession was described in similar terms: 'When the announcement was made of the rule of Gaius Caesar Germanicus Sebastos, which had been hoped and prayed for by all people, there was no limit to the world's joy; every people has been eager for the sight of the god, since the happiest era for mankind has now begun.'v7 The predication of theos epiphan-s implied that the emperor was present in the world like one of the traditional gods. The mortality of the ruler, like his physical presence, might seem to be another problem which needed solution. Ever since Homer the gods had been athanatoi ('deathless'). The gods did not die; the emperor did. In fact there was no real difficulty, as athanatos could be applied to the emperor in various ways. Immortality was predicated of the individual emperor.

PRICE decree describes an emperor making a benefaction 'so that the greatness of his immortality should be in this matter too the more splendid',71 and the emperor's rule was also said to be immortal.72 The emphasis on imperial rule offered an easy transition to the immortality of the emperors collectively. A priesthood on Cyprus was devoted to 'The Immortality of the Sebastoi';73 and Livia was praised in a decree because 'she created the race of the Sebastoi in accordance with the most sacred succession of the epiphaneis theoi, a house incorruptible and immortal for all time'.74 The assimilation to particular deities, the addition of epiphanFs to theos and the use of athanatos all tended to strengthen the primary predication of theos of the emperor. The terms used to describe the cult express more hesitation about the position of the emperor. The cult could be described as isotheoi timai, a phrase which is not easy to translate.75 'Timai' ('honours') was used not only in secular contexts, but also of divine cult, for which there was no specific Greek word; 'the timai of the gods' is thus, for what it is worth, the nearest Greek equivalent to 'religion'.76 An isotheos was one 'equal (isos) to the gods' and isotheoi timai can thus be paraphrased as 'honours equivalent to those paid to the gods'. As has often been observed, the phrase both compares and distinguishes ruler cult from the cult of the gods.77 Isotheoi timai were modelled on the cult of the traditional gods but were distinguished from them. The emperor could be called theos; his honours were equivalent to those given to the traditional gods, but they were not the same. Eusebeia ('piety'), which is what the imperial cult was designed to express, again classifies the emperor with the gods, but here too nuances emerge. Some scholars have attempted to deny the existence of the concept in the imperial cult; 'the provincial priesthoods were viewed as civic duties suitable for the wealthy and ambitious but in no sense a display of piety'.78 Ambition and rivalry on the part of individuals and communities were of course important, but they do not undermine the significance of eusebeia as the virtue which was displayed in the cults. Imperial priests and others were regularly praised for having displayed piety towards the Sebastoi;79 one local benefactor who performed imperial sacrifices and built imperial temples in his native city and in the provincial capital made 'not only the city but also the rest of the province witness to his piety towards the god' (sc. Augustus).80 The display of eusebeia was even enshrined in the oath of loyalty taken by the island of Cyprus at the accession of Tiberius: 'We and our descendants will heed and obey by land and sea and will regard with loyalty (euno-sein) and revere (sebasesthai, the verbal form of eusebeia) Tiberius Caesar Sebastos, son of Sebastos, with all his house'.sl 71 IGR iv I45= Syll.3 798 (Cyzicus): 'rrEL' vios "HAWLos F&amp;ibs KaLtap ZEflaar 6 rpptavLK3l avvavaAd atc - aLS 18ratl~ a a'ya a Kat rd~ 0opvo'dpovs S7)YEEPovlaS -qOEA7uEV A Pa(LA7a, 'va aivro- 7ro IE'yaAECov "rT- &amp;Oavauaas KatL v ro7T'WL rotEpvd-rEpoV S...

Eunoia ('loyalty') was what local citizens displayed towards their own communities. It was also sometimes called for in oaths of allegiance to the emperor, but eusebeia was a stronger term, not used of allegiance to local communities. The importance of the distinction between these terms is well illustrated by the honours awarded to a man on Samos 'for his eusebeia towards the Foundress Hera, Caesar Germanicus Sebastos son of Germanicus (i.e. Gaius) and his house' and also for 'the eunoia and munificent disposition' which he showed to the city and its association of elders (gerousia).82 Eusebeia was a concept which helped to define the religious domain of the Greeks, remaining important down to the end of antiquity.83 The display of piety to the gods through the regular performance of cult secured a stable order; it was even responsible for specific divine interventions.84 The display of eusebeia to the emperor emphasized that the subjects were dependent on the emperor as on the gods. Eusebeia was, however, compatible with honours not strictly divine.85 The city of Cyzicus passed a decree 'concerning eusebeia towards Sebastos (the emperor Gaius) and honours towards the kings' and we might expect that the decree offered the emperor divine honours in contrast to those given to his client kings. In fact this was not the case. The ritual prescribed by the decree for the visit of the client kings (and their mother) to the city was prayers by the priests and priestesses at the temples of the gods 'on behalf of the eternal duration of the emperor and the safety of the kings'.86 The formula raises the emperor above his client kings, but the prayers were to the gods on his behalf. The city's eusebeia did not raise the emperor to a par with the gods. The complex comparison and differentiation of emperor and gods which is implicit in the term isotheoi timai is also present in the term which sums up the aim of the imperial cult. (ii) The second type of language which I wish to consider is that addressed to the emperor in the cults. I leave to one side the ways in which subjects addressed the emperor in person.87 They are poorly documented in the early empire, though it is clear that the terms which we have just been discussing were unacceptable in Rome. There the emperor was treated as citizen, not as god. In the provinces, however, the forms of address employed in the rituals, like the individual terms discussed above, establish a complex relationship between the emperor and the gods. These forms of address fall into three main categories: oaths, praise and prayers. (a) Oaths promising loyalty and obedience to the emperor were sworn in the names of the gods and of the emperor. For example, the Cypriot oath to Tiberius (n. 81) was 'in the name of our Akraia Aphrodite', other local gods of the island 'and the descendant of Aphrodite Sebastos theos Caesar and the eternal Roma'. Here Augustus is invoked posthumously, but another oath, taken when Paphlagonia was incorporated into the Roman empire (3 Bc), called upon the living emperor: 'Zeus, Earth, Sun, all the gods and goddesses and Sebastos himself'.88 Augustus is. placed at the end of the witnesses to the oath and distinguished from the sequence of gods and 82 IGR iv 981: E Ev'oElEaS gpV [EVIEKEV 77"S [ELS9 [TIE r-iv [dpxrlYryE'w "HpaV Ka ' Kalaoapa FEpptavLKO3 UvL'V rEptzavLKOV ?E/ aauov KaG 7rv OLKOv aTO, EvvolaS 84% Kat LtAoo'dov StLaOE'uEWS Els 7riV 7ralpuS Ka at riv yEpovalav.

R. F. PRICE goddesses; after all, the oath expressed loyalty to Augustus as reigning emperor. Another way of handling the logical difficulty of invoking the emperor in oaths of loyalty was to swear by the Fortune (tyche) of the emperor. This was one of the demands made of the Christians. For example, when Polycarp, bishop of Smyrna, was brought before the governor, he was ordered to swear by the Fortune of the emperor, to repent and say 'Away with the Atheists'.89 Polycarp was not prepared to compromise his Christian principles, but could in good conscience say 'Away with the Atheists'. For him the Fortune of the emperor was unacceptably pagan, but the term did not imply the divinity of the emperor. (b) The offering of praise to the emperor at imperial festivals, like oath-taking, did not necessarily imply the divinity of the emperor, but it was clearly modelled on the praise given to the gods. Two different parts of the festivals are involved. First, at the celebrations of the actual rituals there were high-ranking officials whose specific task was to praise the emperor. A choir established by the province of Asia sang hymns in honour of Augustus90 and other officials praised the emperor in verse.91 In prose theologoi honoured the emperor at the imperial temples of Pergamum and Smyrna.92 They were sufficiently important for their name to serve as the model for a new official, the sebastologos, who served in the provincial cult of Gaius at Miletus.93 The offering of ritual praise to the emperor has sporadic precursors in the praise accorded to Hellenistic rulers,94 but behind this lies the cult of the gods. The titles of the imperial officials can all be paralleled in divine cults and the singing of hymns was important in many traditional cults.95 Praising both kings and emperors was calqued on the cult of the gods. Secondly, festivals included competitions, not only in athletics and music, but also in imperial encomia. We hear of one Coan who 'in all the most distinguished cities of Asia won competitions in encomia to the founder of the city Sebastos Caesar and the benefactors Tiberius Caesar and Germanicus Caesar and all their house and to all the other gods in each city'.96 Contests in praising the emperor in prose and verse were widespread in the Greek world, both at festivals in honour of the emperor and as part of the festivals of traditional gods.97 Unfortunately the encomia themselves do not survive, but these competitions do merit our attention. Again they are set in a religious context. Not only were some of the competitions held at festivals of the gods, but there were also, from the first century BC onwards, similar competitions in honour of the gods themselves, a development which may be due to the increased importance attributed to hymns in the cult proper.98 The religious context is also emphasized by the wording of the text in honour of the Coan, who recited encomia not just in honour of Augustus and his family, but also for 'all the other gods in each city'. Both ritual and competitive praise of the emperor located him in the company of the gods. (c) Prayers, like praise, have divine resonances, but it is much harder to establish either the 89 R.

It is generally accepted that no one prayed to the emperor for his aid in sickness or shipwreck.99 I want to argue that personal prayers were indeed made to the emperor, both living and dead, and that prayers had a prominent place in the ideology of the imperial cult. But first it is necessary to question the Christianizing presuppositions with which scholars usually approach the subject. Two opposing conclusions have been drawn from the alleged absence of prayers to the emperor: first, that the imperial cult was essentially political and not religious; secondly, that the imperial cult was of a higher spiritual type than the contemporary religions because the emperor was not bound by the mechanical and demeaning contract of the do ut des.100 Both conclusions depend on the assumption that personal prayers are a fundamental aspect of true religion.1'1 This assumption is peculiar to Christianity. Within the Christian tradition prayers are of fundamental importance. The New Catholic Encyclopedia (xi 672) describes them as 'a necessary means of salvation'. Heiler's classic comparative study of prayer is firmly rooted in this tradition. Setting out to 'write a history of religion by writing a history of prayer' he started by claiming that 'religious people, students of religion, theologians of all creeds and tendencies, agree in thinking that prayer is the central phenomenon of religion, the very hearthstone of piety. Faith is, in Luther's judgement, "prayer and nothing but prayer".'102 The ranking of different types of prayer, which lies behind the positive evaluation of the alleged absence of prayer to the emperor, is also a concern of Christianity. In the words again of the New Catholic Encyclopaedia (xi 667), 'the commonest type (of personal prayer) is the petitionary prayer, which, in accordance with primitive man's childlike selfishness, is concerned almost exclusively with his own material well-being'. But personal prayers are not a universal characteristic of religions. For example, the religious system of the Dinka, who live in the southern Sudan, is based chiefly on collective prayer. 'It is rare to see a Dinka pray individually. On occasions of difficulty or danger he may address a short petition for help to Divinity or divinities, but much the greater and more important part of religious practice is collective and formal." 03 There is no more reason to apply the criterion of private prayer to Greek than to Dinka religion. Prayers in the imperial cult must be analysed from the point of view both of practice and of theory. The aspects of practice which are particularly controversial are prayers by private individuals and the votive offerings made as the result of successful prayers.104 The emperor received a scattering of these votive offerings, of which the clearest example reads: To Emperor Caesar Trajan Hadrian Sebastos and the people the votive (euchin) was set up by Salmon son of Theon, priest of Zeus and sacrificer for the Sebastoi, along with his wife, at a cost of 200 denarii.105 Similarly an imperial procurator dedicated a votive to the emperor Commodus.106 Both these 99 A.

Letter- kunde xxxvi.4 (1973); he repeated the case in Entr. Hardt xxvi (1980) 36-41. 101 There has been a similarly misconceived discus- sion about miracles. Many have felt that their extreme rarity is crucial (Nock, 'Deification and Julian' [n. 99]), though S. Morenz (WiirzburgerJb.f.d. Altertumswissen- schaft iv [1949-50] 370-8) attempted to use one miracle to show that the imperial cult was not an empty shell. But it is arbitrary and ethnocentric to use the 'royal touch' as the criterion of significance; the practice is found almost exclusively in France and England and for peculiar historical reasons. 102 F. Heiler, Prayer (trans. 1932) xiii. H. S. Versnel, 'Religious mentality in ancient prayer', in Faith, hope and worship, ed.

PRICE votives were made to the living emperor, but literary texts also refer to the practice of private prayers to the dead emperor. Suetonius talks of the ritual at the column dedicated to Caesar in the forum at Rome: 'at this for a long time they used to sacrifice, undertake vows and settle disputes by swearing by Caesar'.107 So too in fifth-century Constantinople, it is said, people propitiated with sacrifices and lamps the image of Constantine set on a column, honoured it with incense and uttered prayers as to a god.l08 Votives must not be privileged in our evaluation of the imperial cult; after all, votives were not made to all deities equally. Asklepios, the healing god, received far more than Zeus, but he did not challenge Zeus' position at the head of the pantheon.l09 But on this, admittedly partial, scale the imperial cult does not appear absurd. Prayers also formed an important part of the public expectations of ruler cult. The poets assumed that the emperor both living and dead could be called on in prayer. 110 Horace, looking forward to the return of Augustus from Spain, describes the peacefulness of Italy: the countryman returns joyfully (from his vineyard) to his cups and invites your presence (Augustus) as a god at the second course; he plies you with many a prayer, with pure wine poured from the cups, and mixes your divinity with the household gods, like Greece in her memory of Castor and mighty Hercules."' Ovid also elaborates the theory of prayer to the emperor. Writing from miserable exile on the Black Sea after the death of Augustus he carefully proclaims his virtues, stressing that his piety was known to the locals. The foreign country sees that there is a shrine of Caesar in our house. There stand beside him his pious son and priestly wife (Tiberius and Livia), deities as important as him who has now been made a god. To make the household group complete, both of the grandsons stand there, one next to the side of his grandmother, one next to his father. When the day rises from the East I always offer to them prayers and incense.112 At the end of the poem is a prayer to Augustus, who was among the stars; the hope was that the deceased Augustus might mitigate the punishment which the living Augustus had given. This public expectation of prayers even involved a denial of the legitimacy of prayers to other people. The Sage Apollonius of Tyana was allegedly brought to trial before the emperor Domitian because people had called him a god and prayed to him.113 (Mytilene) may be a prayer to Zeus and Augustus, but the text is uncertain (IG xii suppl. p. 23); IG iv 584 (Argos), votive ? to Titus; PSI 1261, a private letter from Egypt (212-17), talks of the 'fortune' (rixrl) of the emperor saving someone, presumably following a prayer. 107 Div.

A second-century panegyric of Rome talks in elevated terms about how everyone, at the mere mention of the emperor's name, stands up and 'praises and worships him and utters a two-fold prayer, one on the ruler's behalf to the gods and one to the ruler himself about his own matters'.114 Two fourth-century speeches elaborate the idea of prayer to the ruler himself. A speech idealizing the late emperor Julian, written perhaps two years after his death in 363, includes a striking account of prayers to him: I have mentioned representations (ofJulian); many cities have set him beside the images of the gods and honoured him as they do the gods. Already people have requested some benefits of him in prayer, and it was not in vain. To such an extent has he literally ascended to the gods and received a share of their power from them themselves. They were right, then, those people who nearly stoned to death the first messenger to bring news of his end for telling lies about a god."5 A generation later (in 389) another panegyric generalizes the importance of these prayers: (The emperor) should be such as is adored by the peoples, to whom private and public vows are made by the whole world, from whom the future sailor seeks a calm sea, the future traveller a safe return, the future fighter good omens.116 The ideal ruler was the recipient of world-wide prayers. III Theos was predicated quite commonly of the Roman emperor (as earlier of Hellenistic kings). It was added to the name of the emperor and on its own it could refer to a specific emperor. Both uses were in keeping with the contemporary usage in connection with the traditional gods. The predication of theos was matched by other linguistic practices: the emperor was assimilated to particular named deities; he was described as epiphanis or epiphanestatos tin thein; the cults themselves were designed to express eusebeia towards the emperor. The whole linguistic system of which theos forms a part has to be interpreted primarily as the application of traditional Greek categories; theos has a different meaning from the Latin divus. The predication of theos does, however, remain puzzling to our eyes. We might wonder whether theos could be used of the emperor because it was a weak term in contrast with Christian 114 Aristides, Or. xxvi (K) 32 (with comments of J. H.

Nock, 'Dei- fication and Julian' (n. 99) argued for Christian influence on this passage, but my other parallels show that this is not a necessary assumption. 116 Panegyr. Lat. xii 6.4 (Bud6): 'talem esse debere qui gentibus adoratur, cui toto orbe terrarum privata vel publica vota redduntur, a quo petit navigaturus ser- enum, peregrinaturus reditum, pugnaturus auspicium.' Some scholars believe that language of this sort is merely metaphorical, a rhetorical commonplace found in Pliny, Pan. iv 4. I do not believe that the distinction between the literal and the metaphorical is clear or useful; still less do I accept that only the 'literal' is significant. A more helpful position, which I cannot argue here, is presented by D. Sperber, Rethinking Symbolism (Cambridge I975).</page><page sequence="16">94 S. R. F. PRICE uses of 'God'-while the Greeks played around with predicates, Christians have in 'God' the logically proper name of the Supreme Being. In fact this Christianizing denigration of Greek religion is based on an inadequate examination of Christianity itself. Theologians and philosophers from Aquinas onwards have recognized that 'God' is a descriptive, predicable term.117 It is otherwise impossible to understand how Christians and pagans can talk to one another. The pagan who says that his idol is God and the Christian who contradicts him must be using 'God' in the same sense; if 'God' were a proper name, it would be logically impossible, rather than merely wicked, to predicate it of lumps of stone. This point about Christian usage helps to explain how Greek theologians of the early Church were able to predicate theos of humans who were brought near to God, both in this life and in the next.118 Thus both pagan Greeks and Christians use theos/God as a predicative term. The predication of theos placed the emperor within the traditional religious system. He was located in an ambivalent position, higher than mortals but not fully the equal of the gods. The cult he received was described as isotheoi timai, and the eusebeia which the cult displayed was compatible with honours not fully divine. We might be tempted to conclude from this that the emperor was analogous to a Christian saint; saints receive elaborate cults without usurping the honours due to God. In fact the analogy does not hold. According to the official Roman Catholic position saints act as intermediaries for us with God. They do not themselves receive our prayers, but are invoked as intercessors with God on our behalf.119 But the emperor did not hold this position of intercessor with the gods. He was both in need of divine support and also god-like. Thus, in one of the panegyrics I cited above, there was a two-fold prayer, to the gods on behalf of the emperor and to the emperor himself. This clearly expresses the ambivalence of the imperial cult. Was the application of theos to the emperor a consequence of the anthropomorphism of the Greek gods? If the gods are conceived in human form, it is surely not difficult to conceive of the emperor as a god. Yet this modern emphasis on anthropomorphism is misguided. The Greek gods were not actually people; they were at most like people and picturing them in this way was merely one (dominant) strategy for making them comprehensible. Homer's gods, who are often seen as absolutely anthropomorphic,120 also have more fearsome elements in their makeup.121 Similarly the human forms of divine statues, partly a product of the epic tradition, obviously did not encapsulate the whole truth about the Greek gods.122 'The Greek gods are powers, not persons. Religious thought is a response to the problems of organizing and classifying these powers.'123 I have argued that in order to understand the Greek language of the imperial cult we 117 Aquinas, Summa Theologiae Ia 13. 9-10o; P.
