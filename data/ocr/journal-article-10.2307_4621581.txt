Geogr. Ann., 89 B (3): 203-217. ABSTRACT. Recent critiques of the nature-culture dualism, in- fluenced by diverse theoretical stances, have effectively destabi- lized the "naturalness" of nature and highlighted its pervasive and intricate sociality. Yet the practical, ethical and political effects of this theoretical turn are open to question. In particular, the em- phasis on the sociality of nature has not led to reinvigorated en- vironmental or landscape politics. Meanwhile, the need for such politics has if anything increased, as evident when ongoing and, arguably, accelerating landscape transformations are taken into account. These concerns are illustrated in the paper with an example from Iceland. In its uninhabited central highland, serious battles are now being fought over landscape values. Capital and state have joined forces in an investment-driven scramble for hydro- power and geothermal resources to facilitate heavy industry, ir- revocably transforming landscapes in the process. Dissonant voices arguing for caution and conservation have been sidelined or silenced by the power(ful) alliance. The author argues for renewed attention to the aesthetic, in- cluding the visual, if responsible politics of landscape are to be achieved. Aesthetic appreciation is an important part of the eve- ryday experiences of most people. Yet, enthusiastic as they have been in deconstructing conventional narratives of nature, geogra- phers have been rather timid when it comes to analysing aesthetic values of landscape and their significance, let alone in suggesting progressive landscape politics. A political geography of land- scape is needed which takes aesthetics seriously, and which ac- knowledges the merit of engagement and enchantment. Key words: social nature, landscape politics, landscape aesthetics, scenic values, Iceland, Kairahnjdkar power project Power politics: an introductory story You do not have to be interested in the high- lands or nature at all - If you are interested in earthmoving machinery, then this is heaven!' The hills are alive with the sound of diesel engines. At Kairahnj6kar, in the northeastern highland of Ice- land, the visitor is left gobsmacked. Anyone seek- ing tranquility and solitude would feel well and tru- ly out of place here these days. Relentlessly, the yel- low-coloured bulldozers, excavators and dump trucks work their way through the terrain (Fig. 1). Mountains are being moved - literally. One of the country's most furious, dirty and powerful glacial rivers is being dammed and diverted from its im- mense canyon through 50 km long tunnels to a val- ley further east, where an underground power sta- tion is under construction. Tall, grey, electricity py- lons are also being planted in that valley, towering over the humble birch trees. In a fjord not far away on the east coast, an international army of labourers is constructing a very large aluminium smelter. Owned by the American multinational Alcoa, the smelter is supposed to bring an abundance of jobs and general well-being to this previously stagnant part of Iceland. A true "megaproject" is taking shape. It involves large corporate actors such as the US aluminium company Alcoa and the contracting firms Impregilo and Bechtel, headquartered in Italy and the US respectively. The "developmentist" Ice- landic state is also a major player,2 promising cheap energy - and lots of it - to Alcoa, and to the global aluminium industry at large. In the process, some remarkable landscapes are being irrevocably transformed. Although the larg- est of its kind, the Kairahnjdkar project is only the latest, albeit probably not the final, chapter in a long history of struggle for the landscapes of Iceland be- tween the interests of capitalism and conservation. Most hotly contested are the landscapes of the cen- tral highland. In fact, the scramble for resources has greatly intensified in recent years, fuelled by the im- pending privatization of the power industry. The value of those landscapes is being determined in powerful units that are widely respected: mega/ giga/terawatts; and ultimately in monetary units that are widely understood: dollars, euros, kr6nur. Those arguing for caution and conservation have been effectively sidelined by a public relations ma- chine second to none, orchestrated by Lands- virkjun, the national power company. In a highly competitive market economy under the conditions of globalization, is there any space for alternative visions and valuations of landscapes, besides and beyond the economic bottom line? If found to be lacking, can that space be created? Can academics - geographers, for instance - play a role in bringing it about?

Landscapes transformed: The building of Kairahnjtikar dam, July 2005. Source: www.karahnjukar.is. me think long and hard about these very questions. Let us not beat about the bush. My own personal sentiment is probably clear already, but I will state it here just in case: I am simply appalled by what to me seems a short-sighted, unsustainable and recklessly exploitative project, decided upon in an undemocratic manner, which will in no way guar- antee the socioeconomic future of the communi- ties in whose interest it is purportedly undertaken. I am also, and no less so, appalled by the landscape transformations wrought in this part of my coun- try, which was not so long ago largely without di- rect evidence of human energies,3 but with the en- ergies of the various forces of nature all the more visible. Geographers - myself included - were in fact conspicuously absent from debates about the poli- tics of landscape conservation concerning the Kai- rahnjdkar project. Others fought the battle against the project - a motley crew of committed environ- mentalists of many persuasions, but not least art- ists, ranging from painters and writers to actors and musicians. That battle was eventually lost. It seems to me that part of the answer to the curious silence of critical human geographers (and many others from the social sciences and humanities, albeit with honourable exceptions; see e.g. J6nsson 2003 2004; Porgeirsd6ttir 2005) lies in the way in which critical geography has in recent years tended to sidestep the admittedly complex issue of landscape aesthetics. To some extent, I would argue, this is due to the very success of recent (and much-need- ed) theorizing about the ambiguous nature of na- ture. Socialized nature and its politics The sharp distinction between nature and society/ culture has been one of the central planks of the sci- entific endeavour for centuries, which is not sur- prising given the self-evident status this distinction has occupied during Western cultural history, espe- cially since the times of Descartes and Bacon (Gla- cken 1967; White 1967; Latour 1993; Harvey 1996). It is only in the past few decades or even years that this dualism has been subjected to extend- ed critique and indeed effectively destabilized in re- cent theorizing (see e.g. FitzSimmons 1989; Mac- naghten and Urry 1998; Goldman and Schurman 2000; Haila 2000; Castree and Braun 2001; De- meritt 2002; Castree 2004). The resultant "sociali- zation" of nature has been influenced by a number of theoretical strands. Roughly speaking, three main positions may be identified. The first highlights economic relations: the pro- duction of nature (Smith 1984). This is evident in the valuations placed on nature's material manifes- tations as resources and as raw material, as well as space for locating various "productive" activities. Marxist theorists have been among those most prominent in the new analysis of nature. Somewhat contradictorily, this is the one part of social theory 204 ? The author 2007 Journal compilation @ 2007 Swedish Society for Anthropology and Geography</page><page sequence="3">"SCENOPHOBIA", GEOGRAPHY AND THE AESTHETIC POLITICS OF LANDSCAPE which has always insisted that nature is social (Smith 1984; Pepper 1993; Harvey 1996), yet has been accused of utter neglect of issues relating to the natural environment, save for nature's values for economic accumulation processes. For Marx, the application of human labour to nature was a fun- damental process in the formation of social rela- tions, which is the essence of the idea of "produced nature". In practice, analysis of the social - or rather the economic - was nearly always foregrounded in Marxist analysis, or, as Castree (1995) puts it, the 'materiality of produced nature' was underplayed. The important interjection of FitzSimmons (1989) served as a wake-up call which has fed into an in- vigorated political ecology of either more Marxist flavour or less (Bryant 1992; Peet and Watts 1996; Arsel 2002; Hagner 2003; Porter 2004; Trudgill 2004). The second position emphasizes the social and cultural constructions of meaning in nature. They include, of course, a plethora of sociocultural valu- ations, manifested in items as diverse as the orna- mental plants many of us spend a great deal of time tending in our manicured gardens, and the tender blisters which the highland traveller has to deal with at the end of a strenuous day of hiking. The social constructionist work about nature has been strongly influenced by the "discursive turn" in social sciences in general. Instead of taking off from a solid ground of ontological and epistemological realism, it has questioned the "reality" of nature, highlighting instead the diversity of meanings and symbols associated with and afforded by nature: na- ture is only made knowable through the use of cul- turally coded concepts. Much of the academic at- tention has accordingly been directed towards ana- lysing the historical evolution of the various cultur- al conceptualizations of nature. A particularly pertinent example, given the central issue of this pa- per, is Cronon's dissection of the concept of "wil- derness", which has indeed animated much of the conservation discourse in Iceland in recent years (Benediktsson 2000). The "cultural logic" inherent in the spaces of conservation has also been similarly analysed elsewhere, for instance, in Sweden (Mels 1999, 2002). As frequently happens, the basic idea of socially constructed nature has been transformed into sever- al distinctive lines of thought. In an attempt to clarify the debate, Demeritt (2002) usefully distinguishes between two major forms of constructionism. First of all, he points to constructionist rhetoric being used simply as a device for unsettling some "truths" or widely accepted knowledges about the "natural" state of things. This is in itself not particularly rad- ical in terms of epistemology, as it more often than not entails a realist view of knowledge and its refer- ence to the "real world". The aim then is simply to replace an allegedly "false" version with a "true" version of the story in question. Often there is a po- litical agenda, - hidden or explicit, radical or con- servative - behind such accounts. It has certainly been put to work in the Icelandic highland debate, both sides accusing each other of misconstruing and misinterpreting the "facts". More fundamental constructionist critiques of the concept of nature itself, according to Demeritt, are those that discuss its philosophical underpin- nings. Such philosophical critiques can take many forms. One type of critique puts stress on the inter- subjective construction of social reality and the in- sistence upon separating that reality from actual physical conditions. In other words, the concern is to unravel through empirically based exposition the conditions surrounding the varied claim-making activities which relate to nature and environmental issues. A group of constructionists has looked spe- cifically at how scientific knowledge is constructed through negotiations taking place within scientific communities. Some of these sociologists of scien- tific knowledge have articulated a strong, ontolog- ically idealist position, in effect insisting on the complete bracketing of "reality" - physical as well as social - in favour of conventionalism. Not far away is a version which Demeritt (2002) calls "dis- cursive constructionalism". Its advocates pay spe- cial attention to issues of power and discursive prac- tices in the making of stories about nature, as well as the effects that such narratives have. As for what kind of progressive politics might follow in the wake of such a deconstruction, suggestions have been somewhat modest. A book devoted to the sub- ject (Castree and Braun 2001) thus simply ends with the advice that the inevitability of "paradox" be acknowledged (Proctor 2001; see also Proctor 1998). Turning now to the third major group of academ- ics working in the borderlands between nature and society, the actor-network theorists are in some re- spects the most radical. They go a step further and speak of active and mutual co-construction of so- ciety and nature. In this case, nature is envisaged as an active agent in the strange and hybrid entangle- ments - or collectifs (Callon and Law 1995) - of which the world is made, not merely as a neutral object on which humans can scribble their cultural @ The author 2007 205 Journal compilation @ 2007 Swedish Society for Anthropology and Geography</page><page sequence="4">KARL BENEDIKTSSON meanings and/or rework into monetary values. These theorists insist on a relational, "flat" ontolo- gy in which humans, plants and animals, and inan- imate things - society and nature - are equal co- constituents of the events that make up the world (Callon 1986; Latour 1993; Callon and Law 1995; Law and Hassard 1999). The attribution of "agen- cy" to non-humans as well as humans is central. Suddenly, a plethora of potential actors/actants, in- animate as well as animate - scallops (Callon 1986), trees (Cloke and Jones 2001, 2003, 2004), rivers (Eden et al. 2000), walking boots (Michael 2001) and so on - appear in an active role in net- worked assemblages which compose an ever-shift- ing world, not merely as a passive backdrop to hu- man actions. Agency is not a capacity possessed but an outcome of negotiations taking place be- tween heterogeneous participants in networked re- lations. While the provocative "radical symmetry" of ac- tor-network theorists has not been uncritically cel- ebrated by everyone (cf. Collins and Yearley 1992; Vandenberghe 2002), it is no exaggeration to say that ANT has stimulated a more nuanced story tell- ing about the world. For the purposes of this paper, the question is not least about its political implica- tions. Castree and MacMillan (2001) reason that ac- tor-network theory would find purely social con- structionist politics of nature just as untenable as the realist politics it seeks to destabilize. Instead, a 'hy- brid politics of nature' is advocated, to be based on relational ethics (Whatmore 2002). Politics of na- ture should not, Castree and MacMillan argue, be centred on a select few purified spaces of defined geographical extent, such as those officially desig- nated as "wilderness" or other protected areas, as 'these spaces are neither wholly natural nor merely zones where certain social actors impose their cul- turally specific ideas of what nature is supposed to be' (Castree and MacMillan 2001, p. 221). Howev- er, they do not see the strong version of ANT, which insists on a completely equal treatment of human and non-human actors (or actants), as leading to re- sponsible politics of nature. Instead they advocate a "weaker" form of ANT, which admits: that power, while dispersed, can be directed by some (namely, specific 'social' actors) more than others; and that a politics of nature attuned to the needs and rights of both human and natural entities must ultimately be orches- trated through putatively 'social' actors. (Castree and MacMillan 2001, pp. 222-223) To sum up: in different ways, these varied theoret- ical developments have destabilized the "natural- ness" of nature and highlighted its pervasive and in- tricate sociality. Similarly, many other dualisms fa- miliar to geographers have been exposed as shaky at best or destructive at worst: rural-urban; place- space; subject-object. Dualistic thinking is well and truly out of fashion, in academia at least, and justly so in these muddled and postmodern times. For our purposes, the absence of concern with the visual is remarkable, however, in discussions of social na- ture. Landscape in geography: from "scopophilia" to "scenophobia"? Similar to that supremely important and overarch- ing concept of nature, the old geographical chestnut - landscape - has been prised open. While German- ic and Nordic usage of the word (i.e. landskap/ Landschaft) has to some extent retained an earlier meaning of polity, as discussed below, its primary association - certainly in the anglophone world - has been with the visual. The very mention of land- scape automatically led one to think about a vista or scenery. It conjured up an image of someone - a geographer perhaps - standing on a hilltop and gaz- ing into the distance. A sharp distinction was main- tained between the viewing subject and the viewed object. The re-theorization of nature and dissolution of the subject-object dualism has led to a marked retreat of the visual paradigm in landscape geo- graphy. The critiques of the visual emphasis have been of several different, albeit related, kinds. I will now present a selective review of these critiques, to- gether with some counter-arguments. First, the "landscape-as-scenery" approach im- plicit in the above description has been faulted on grounds of being simplistic and superficial. Accord- ing to many critics, it is a gross oversimplification of the complex sensory and experiential encounters be- tween people and landscapes. I agree wholehearted- ly in principle. There is a great deal more to human encounters with nature in general, and to landscape appreciation more specifically, apart from and be- yond what the visual sense affords. Even so, I want to probe this a little. My main reason for concern is the boundary work often discerned in the writings of those who argue in this way, between "us" (academ- ics) and "them" (the public). Quite often, one dis- cerns a touch of elitism in the writings of those who oppose "the scenic" on grounds of shallowness. Take, for instance, the comments made by a person 206 @ The author 2007 Journal compilation @ 2007 Swedish Society for Anthropology and Geography</page><page sequence="5">"SCENOPHOBIA", GEOGRAPHY AND THE AESTHETIC POLITICS OF LANDSCAPE who, incidentally, was central in taking up aesthetics of nature as an academic issue in the 1960s: If we want to attach very high value to the ap- preciation of natural beauty, we must be able to show that more is involved in such appreci- ation than the pleasant, unfocused enjoyment of a picnic place, or a fleeting and distanced impression of the countryside through a tour- ing-coach window, or obligatory visits to standard viewpoints or (should I say?) snap- shot-points. (Hepburn 2001, p. 1) This seems to imply that everyday experiences, such as those of the picnicker and - heaven forbid - the coach tourist, cannot be expected to yield the same depth and quality of appreciation as does more rarefied academic contemplation. The tourist gaze is construed as trivial, not serious (cf. Urry 1990; Crawshaw and Urry 1997). This essentialization of the tourism experience hardly does justice to the plethora of practices and performances found under the rubric of tourism (cf. e.g. Crouch 1999; Coleman and Crang 2002; Beer- enholdt et al. 2004; Cartier and Lew 2005). Even coach tourists can and sometimes do have some quite profound experiences when confronted with unfamiliar and startling landscapes which they find moving, as my friends who have worked as tour guides have repeatedly told me (cf. Leddy 2005 for an interesting discussion of nature appreciation from within the car). As for photography specifical- ly, recent work has shown that this quintessential tourist activity is all but simple (Crang 1997; Craw- shaw and Urry 1997) - and in fact it is about many things other than visual representation (Larsen 2001, 2005). The act of photographing is an 'em- bodied experience' (Crang 1997). We might also do well to keep in mind that the appreciation of nature and landscapes is always mediated by technology of some sort or other (Leddy 2005), not only sophis- ticated optical or electronic gadgetry, but also more mundane technology such as the boots on one' s feet (Michael 2001; Ingold 2004). Second, the term landscape has itself been ac- cused of serving as merely a visual "masque", di- verting attention from much more "substantive" is- sues (Olwig 1996). The inherent "duplicity of land- scape" (Daniels 1989) endows the concept with the 'capacity to veil historically specific social rela- tions behind the smooth and often aesthetic appear- ance of "nature"' (Cosgrove 2004, p. 68; see also Mitchell 2000). Many authors have seen reason to dwell at length on the complex and intriguing his- torical evolution of the landscape concept, from its Dutch/German roots into English and other Ger- manic languages. The most extensive of these dis- cussions are found in Olwig's work (1992, 1996, 2002, 2005). According to Olwig, the original meaning of Landschaft in the Germanic cultural realm was that of a territorial polity, which entailed certain rights and duties for those living within its bounds (see also Setten 2003 for the "Nordic" con- text); a meaning Olwig terms "substantive" as op- posed to the scenic (by implication insubstantial?) meaning which later took hold, especially in Eng- land, i.e. of a visual representation of a particular kind, or a 'way of seeing' (Cosgrove 1984). This analysis is a highly pertinent and valuable reminder of the complexities which frequently lurk behind apparently simple and straightforward con- cepts. However, a rather restricted geographical reference is noticeable in the writings of Olwig and others about these conceptual developments, as there has been little discussion of corresponding concepts in non-Germanic languages, let alone non-European languages. This renders much of this discussion rather one-sided and even self-centred in cultural terms. I also profess to having some doubts regarding the continued need for extended etymo- logical expeditions, at least in rather well-mapped Northern European linguistic territory. Philological interests notwithstanding, a present-day scholar in this part of the world has to confront the fact that everyday understanding of the landscape concept among the common folks does tend to emphasize the scenic aspect. It may be helpful to put this in my own cultural context. Taking Germano-centric linguistic analy- sis a little further while we are at it, the emphasis on visual characteristics may be even more pro- nounced in the use of the term landslag in the Ice- landic language than with landscape in English, and certainly more so than in the case of the Ger- man Landschaft. Although the -lag suffix does in- deed relate to the legal sphere (cf. Olwig 1996), those antiquated connotations have been rather thoroughly forgotten by the people who are putting the concept of landslag to use in various ways in contemporary Iceland. What matters for an analy- sis of the present, I argue, is not only the genealogy of the concept and its varying trajectories in the past, but also how that concept is put to work "on the ground" in contemporary society, through eve- ryday use and practices. @ The author 2007 207 Journal compilation @ 2007 Swedish Society for Anthropology and Geography</page><page sequence="6">KARL BENEDIKTSSON The third set of criticisms of the visual under- standing of landscape relates to the pretensions in- volved in attempting to achieve a "detached" as- sessment of landscape by analysing its scenic char- acteristics. Such presumptions about detachment and objectivity have been accused of woefully eras- ing the history which is surely always part and par- cel of the landscape. Past power struggles and ideo- logical meanings associated with the landscape are overlooked. Such an approach therefore, it is ar- gued, has a disempowering effect on local inhabit- ants, at worst obliterating them from the history of the landscapes in which they live and from which they make their living. History provides many instances of this. A par- ticularly good example of such analysis is provided by Cronon's (1996) careful interrogation of the concept of "wilderness" - a concept which has an- imated conservation practices particularly in North America and Oceania, but also to some extent in Europe. Probing its meaning in the North American context, Cronon traced the intricate cultural history of this concept, which has come to stand for any- thing but culture in the conservation discourse. Far from being a space somehow beyond human soci- ety, "wilderness" was shown to be laden with a vio- lent past and some very particular ideologies, most notably that of the "frontier". This analysis touched a raw nerve, provoking a host of less than sympa- thetic responses from conservation-minded people (see e.g. Cohen 1996; Hays 1996; Curry 2003; Crist 2004), many of whom saw his work as a disabling and dangerous critique. It might be noted that the paper was written at a time when the blatantly eu- phemistic concept of "wise use" was being touted by corporations eager to get their teeth into hitherto relatively pristine areas in public ownership in the USA. Cronon's argument about wilderness is very clearly a social constructionist one. It might be not- ed that the emphasis on scenic beauty of landscape has also been attacked from the opposite position - that of natural science and ecosystem analysis4 - as unable to serve as a guide to responsible treatment of landscapes. Ecosystemic health of a particular landscape may have nothing at all to do with the aesthetic pleasures afforded by that landscape. So, the reasoning goes, we might simply have to forgo the aesthetic in favour of the ecological; an '"eat your spinach" mode of persuation' as Saito (2004, n.p.) aptly puts it. Alternatively, taking their cue from Aldo Leopold's "land aesthetic", which runs parallel to his "land ethic" (Callicott 1989), some theorists argue that it is the aesthetic judgement that is wrong. Our culture should learn to appreciate aes- thetically those landscapes that are ecologically sound. Leopold's land aesthetic thus: emphasizes less the directly visible, scenic as- pects of nature and more the conceptual - di- versity, complexity, species rarity, species in- teractions, nativity, phylogenetic antiquity - the aspects of nature revealed by evolutionary and ecological natural history. (Callicott 1989, p. 240) Therefore, what is needed is a reformed "aesthetic of the unspectacular". A noble thought for sure, for which I have great sympathy, but a great deal of "cultural engineering" would probably be required to achieve such a goal. This applies both to ethics and aesthetics - as Harvey (1996, p. 120) has some- what wistfully observed, 'Leopold's land ethic would necessarily entail the construction of an al- ternative mode of production and consumption to that of capitalism'. This apart, considerable ecological knowledge would be needed to discern between aesthetically worthy and unworthy landscapes under such an aes- thetic paradigm. Who should be the judge? Sepin- maa (1993) proclaims that 'the correct basis [for en- vironmental aesthetics] is given by contemporary scientific knowledge' (p. 78) and that 'lay opinion cannot carry the weight of that of an expert' (p. 88). This is also the gist of the well-known "natural en- vironmental model" of aesthetics advanced by Carl- son (1997, 2001), who assigns a central role to nat- ural scientists in matters of aesthetic judgement about nature: to properly appreciate a landscape's visual appearance, one has to know the formative processes which brought it into being. This is much too narrow from my point of view. Apart from being philosophically questionable as several authors have shown (Carroll 1993; Heyd 2001; Brady 2003; Led- dy 2005), it carries the very real possibility of exclu- sion of those from non-scientific backgrounds, even if such "lay" and/or local people may have intimate knowledge of, and deep moral connections with, the landscape in question. Farmers are an obvious case in point (cf. Setten 2002, 2004, 2005). Last but not least, the fall from grace of the vis- ual paradigm in landscape studies has been rein- forced by a forceful criticism of geography's long- standing "ocularcentrism" from a feminist stand- point. More than a decade ago, Rose (1993) fa- mously accused geography in general of "aesthetic 208 @ The author 2007 Journal compilation @ 2007 Swedish Society for Anthropology and Geography</page><page sequence="7">"SCENOPHOBIA", GEOGRAPHY AND THE AESTHETIC POLITICS OF LANDSCAPE masculinism" and, specifically addressing the cen- trality of landscape, asserted that '[t]he pleasures geographers feel when they look at landscape are not innocent ... but nor are they simple' (Rose 1993, p. 88). She linked the geographers' "phallo- centric gazing" at landscape to an exercise of male power over feminized nature. Needless to say, this blunt critique proved uncomfortable to many ge- ographers. One might, however, note that other feminist geographers have warned of the essential- ization inherent in assuming a single male/female gaze (Nash 1996). Don't get me wrong: I do think that all the cri- tiques mentioned above have a valid point to make. The dualism of nature-society and the hegemony of the scenic had to be dethroned. Yet there may - as always in conceptual critique - be a danger of suc- cumbing to the baby-bathwater syndrome. Geo- graphers seem to have flipped over from rampant "scopophilia"5 to rather pusillanimous "scenopho- bia". The socialization of nature has had the unfor- tunate side-effect of stifling serious discussion among geographers about the aesthetic politics of landscape. There is no denying the importance of the visual. What is more, there is no escaping the inherently political quality of the visual; of imagery; scenery; landscape (cf. Mitchell 2000). As an eminent geo- grapher (although not speaking specifically of land- scape) puts it, 'images are a key element of space because it is so often through them that we register the spaces around us and imagine how they might turn up in the future' (Thrift 2003, p. 100). My contention is that a serious engagement with the visual, couched in the terms of a more general philosophy of aesthetic engagement, should actual- ly be an indispensable part of a landscape geogra- phy which purports to have something to say about the politics of landscape. The question I would like to pose next is: What kind of aesthetic philosophy might best further the cause of an invigorated poli- tics of landscape? Reasserting the importance of landscape aesthetics A fine mess we're in, Jackie A clearing in the bush The trees are all tangled up, and they're the wrong shade of green. (Don McGlashan: 'Jackie's Song'. The Mutton Birds, Rain, Steam and Speed 1999) A number of possible options are open to geogra- phers for getting themselves out of the fine mess they're in with regard to the politics of landscape. The simplest of course would be to put up an am- biguous grin, continue with suitably opaque textual gymnastics designed to impress fellow academic travellers, and let the great roadshow of capital- driven landscape transformations continue its glo- bal tour unchecked. Landscape is just a matter of dubitable social constructions anyway, isn't it? As the reader should have gleaned by the reading thus far, I consider this path of "academic least resist- ance" to be untenable and equal to playing dead in both an ethical and aesthetic sense. Another option, and one which has received con- siderable attention, consists of following Galileo's famous dictum, to 'make measurable that which is not measurable'. Notwithstanding the contradiction inherent in this exhortation, repeated attempts have been made to establish an aesthetic reference for landscapes in observable and recordable "facts". The Visual Resource Management methods devised in the United States for managing federal lands are a case in point (Bureau of Land Management 2003). They involve the delineation and mapping of geo- graphical units that are rated and ranked according to various criteria pertaining to scenic quality, sen- sitivity to change, viewing distance and so on and analysed through overlay techniques. Similar meth- ods have been devised in other countries, including Canada (cf. critique in Dakin 2003) and Australia. In Iceland, this option for dealing with landscape has, belatedly, gained some momentum. In 1999, work towards a 'Master Plan for Hydro and Geo- thermal Energy Resources in Iceland' was started, modelled on similar planning undertaken earlier in Norway. Under the watchful eye of the Ministry of Industry, four groups of experts started assembling data about potential energy projects, and their en- vironmental and socioeconomic impacts (Land- vernd 2004). One of these groups - dealing with natural and cultural heritage - took up the formida- ble challenge of assessing landscape values and im- pacts. The group consisted mostly of natural scien- tists. A complex methodology ensued, based in part on methods for scenery management developed in the USA. Numerical values were systematically as- signed to various landscape features, which were intended to reflect aesthetic values (Rammaiaetlun um nytingu vatnsafls og jarivarma 2002). These were combined into a single "rating" which was then weighed against four other criteria with the help of a formal decision-making methodology - @ The author 2007 209 Journal compilation @ 2007 Swedish Society for Anthropology and Geography</page><page sequence="8">KARL BENEDIKTSSON the Analytical Hierarchical Process - to arrive at a relative measure of the importance of natural and cultural heritage in the areas that would be affected by the proposed projects. The various alternatives could then be objectively compared, or so it was reasoned, in terms of their landscapes. Now, in pragmatic political terms there is much to be said for this sort of work. The basic sentiment is laudable: the process was obviously intended to give landscape a "weight" hitherto denied in the corridors of decision-making. Questions loom large, however. To the social scientist, the "objec- tivity" of a process such as this is obviously highly debatable, as the methods clearly mask a great number of subjective judgements. Once again, numbers were supposed to work their magic of ob- jectification (cf. Rose 1999). Landscape values ar- rived at through "disinterested" methods could hence be brought to a table at which more classic measures of Nature's worth, such as measures of bi- odiversity, had been allocated a seat already. But even if objectivity was the goal, the expert group stopped short of attempting to translate this evaluation into economic calculation. The exercise nevertheless generated considerable interest and was well received - by nearly everyone except for the power industry and its political protagonists. The overall political effects were somewhat less than spectacular. The authorities in fact seemed to lose interest as soon as the results of the first phase of the master plan had seen the light of day: those projects already started or supposed to be the next in line actually came out the worst in this evalua- tion, all things considered.6 In my reading, this story serves to illustrate that plain empirical realism does not seem to offer much promise for a philosophically sound and politically astute geography of landscape, any more than does slick constructionism. For that, geographers need a language which would enable them to converse with the general public about heartfelt aesthetics matters. Visual values are bound to be central in such a con- versation. Shorn of simplistic emphasis on "the pic- turesque", the visual sense will continue as one of the major ingredients in an aesthetic appreciation of landscapes, if not the major ingredient, given the everyday flavour of the landscape concept. As an academic problem, the aesthetics of Na- ture and landscapes is a field of many contested the- ories, but several threads of discussion are found in environmental philosophy which may be very help- ful for that purpose. Some have already been men- tioned. Broadly speaking, philosophers working with environmental aesthetics have adopted either a stance of "disinterested" judgement, often associ- ated with Kant ([1790] 2000; see also Lothian 1999; Brady 2003), or an opposite pose of "engagement" and "existential insiderness" (cf. Bourassa 1991). The evaluation methods described above obviously presuppose that aesthetic judgements are made by detached observers who do not allow non-aesthetic interests to intrude. But how reasonable is such a presupposition? Many people think it is not reason- able at all (e.g. Bourassa 1991; Berleant 1992, 1997; Heyd 2001; Fenner 2003). Instead of the Kantian ideal of "disinterestedness", many of these authors look to American pragmatist philosophy for a basis, notably that of Dewey (1929, 1934). Dewey's project is holistic; he argues against the separation of body from mind, or of humans from nature (McDonald 2002). Shusterman (2000) draws attention to the central importance of what he terms "somatic naturalism" in Dewey's approach: in a similar vein as Nietzsche, Dewey emphasizes the bodily or somatic basis of the aesthetic. Shusterman also sees his views as compatible in this regard with the work of Foucault and Merleau-Ponty, for both of whom the body was central. Central in his theory is the concept of "aesthetic experience", which has a common-sense, intrinsic appeal, although some- what complex and difficult to pin down precisely. Such an experience has a beginning and an end: Dewey speaks of aesthetic experiences as "consum- matory experiences" which offer a deep apprecia- tion of the relatedness of things and persons: Experience ... is heightened vitality. Instead of signifying being shut up within one's own pri- vate feelings and sensations, it signifies active and alert commerce with the world; at its height it signifies complete interpenetration of self and the world of objects and events. Instead of sig- nifying surrender to caprice and disorder, it af- fords our sole demonstration of a stability that is not stagnation but is rhythmic and developing. (Dewey 1934, p. 23) An aesthetic experience is moreover made up of many strands of sense and emotion. It follows that it is not tenable to attempt to isolate single strands of the aesthetic experience as a whole and assign to them a specific role as carriers of aesthetic signifi- cance, as attempted, for instance, in the various "ob- jectivist" landscape assessment methods that have been devised. On the contrary, the aesthetic sense cannot be divorced from everyday life and practic- 210 @ The author 2007 Journal compilation @ 2007 Swedish Society for Anthropology and Geography</page><page sequence="9">"SCENOPHOBIA", GEOGRAPHY AND THE AESTHETIC POLITICS OF LANDSCAPE es. In opposition to Kant, Dewey does not think that judgements of aesthetic beauty can or should be re- moved from all considerations of function and use. Instead he reasons that aesthetic value lies in: satisfying the live creature in a more global way, by serving a variety of ends, and above all by enhancing our immediate experience which invigorates and vitalizes us, thus aiding our achievement of whatever further ends we pursue. (Shusterman 2000, p. 9) Dewey himself was mainly concerned with art, but subsequent authors have taken his ideas in several distinct directions. Particularly notewor- thy, in my judgement, is Berleant's phenomeno- logically based "aesthetic of engagement" (Berle- ant 1992, 1993, 1997; see also Bourassa 1991; Brady 2003), which has strong affinities with Dewey's pragmatist aesthetics. Berleant insists that aesthetics be "participatory", and strongly op- poses the separation between subject and object. The appreciator should be acutely aware of the context in which s/he interacts with the landscape, not in order to eliminate this context, but to high- light the value of deep and varied relations indi- viduals have with landscape and nature. This is clearly a very different viewpoint from that of the emphasis on scientific knowledge found in Carlson's "natural environmental model", out- lined above, and indeed from the objectivist lean- ings of much current landscape appreciation work in political circles. A consistent political corollary of the aesthetic of engagement would be the crea- tion of a discursive space where multiple, nuanced and inevitably contextual stories and appreciations of landscape are respected. Fenner, comparing the "detachment" position with that of "engagement", is sure that the latter holds more political promise: [I]f the point is to move aesthetic attenders to realise obligations on their part to defend and protect natural areas and objects, then clearly the greater call to action, or constraint of ac- tion, is found through the model of greater in- timacy, interest and relationship between na- ture and humans. (Fenner 2003, p. 7) Similar themes to those of Berleant are taken up by Heyd (2001), who makes compelling claims for multi-vocal story-telling. He believes there is a very real danger of closing the doors for meaningful and ethical politics of Nature, if the natural science mod- el of appreciating landscapes becomes entrenched: [I]n many cases scientific knowledge may be neutral, or even harmful, to our aesthetic appre- ciation of nature, because it directs our atten- tion to the theoretical level and the general case, diverting us from the personal level and particular case that we actually need to engage. (Heyd 2001, p. 126) Carroll (1993, p. 254) likewise stresses the capacity of Nature to provide moving emotional experiences of considerable richness, 'where our cognitions do not mobilize the far more formal and recondite sys- temic knowledge found in natural history and sci- ence'. Thus, we need 'an account that focuses on our capacity to become emotionally moved by nature' (Heyd 2001, p. 125). It is not reasonable, however, to demand that all senses are equally engaged at once (Leddy 2005). Without necessarily prioritizing "the scenic" in general terms, it is perfectly possible to refer to a particular sense - the visual - in account- ing for why one is emotionally moved in a particular context. So, the world needs more stories of Nature and landscapes - stories which could and should have political significance by virtue of their very exist- ence (cf. Cronon 1992); stories that have their roots in a diversity of sensual experiences in nature: vis- ual, aural, olfactory, somatic. Geography is itself a riotous discipline of many and diverse narrative tra- ditions. Geographers should be well placed to tell such stories about the beauty of landscape, and, just as importantly, to argue for their being respected in the halls of political and economic power. I now want to get back to Kairahnjdkar in the northeastern highlands of Iceland, and consider some of the stories which were told about natural beauty in the struggle between conservationists and developers - stories in which the visual land- scape figured prominently. Karahnjuikar: visual stories and their effects Solemn silence reigns in Iceland's highest and most rugged wilderness ... the birds fly silent- ly across, they have nothing to seek there and so speed across the deserts. It could be said that nature is dead and fossilized, with neither animal nor plant life able to persist. (Thoroddsen 1908, p. 165) @ The author 2007 211 Journal compilation @ 2007 Swedish Society for Anthropology and Geography</page><page sequence="10">KARL BENEDIKTSSON It is enough to look at photographs of the land which is to be submerged to feel pain in the heart. This pain is not measurable, which may be irritating for the men with the meas- uring instruments. Without wanting to deni- grate measurements, not everything is meas- urable. We have neither been able to measure the length of love nor the circumference of God. (Jokulsd6ttir 2002, p. 38) Nearly one hundred years separate these two quo- tations. Basing his assessment on his extensive trav- els in the highlands of Iceland in the late nineteenth century, PIorvaldur Thoroddsen7 tells of a bleak landscape - a "wilderness" of biblical propor- tions, with characteristics of terror, mystery and intrigue. Writer and environmental activist Elfsa- bet Jikulsd6ttir, writing in an Icelandic newspa- per during the height of the Kairahnjdkar contro- versy, also invokes religion, albeit in a very dif- ferent manner, in order to show the folly of one- dimensional engineering evaluation. The photographs that moved JMkulsd6ttir's heart occupied quite a central role in the national discourse for a while. Some of the country's most prominent photographers joined in the debate on the side of conservationists, telling visual stories of a part of the highlands which very few Iceland- ers had actually visited. Particularly notable was the work of J6hann Isberg and Ragnar Axelsson. Outdoor enthusiast and nature photographer Is- berg systematically photographed much of the area in 2002. His photos were published on a spe- cial website (Iceland Nature Conservation Organ- isation 2002) and have been widely used by those attempting to mobilize resistance to the Kirahn- jdkar project. He has now turned his attention to other parts of the highlands that are being consid- ered for hydropower development. Axelsson, an acclaimed photographer and photojournalist working at Iceland's largest newspaper Morgun- bladid, prepared a photo essay entitled LandiO sem hverfur (The land that will disappear). The essay was published late in 2002 in three Sunday issues of the newspaper, the photos accompanied by short captions highlighting both the landscape and biological conditions, and what would be lost if the project went ahead. The photographs were subsequently exhibited in Reykjavik's major shopping mall. They generated a lot of public in- terest and commentary, such as that by JOikulsd6t- tir quoted above. Many people seemed to be gen- uinely moved. Even the editor of the conservative newspaper was moved as well, judging from edi- torials he wrote following the publication. The pictures taken by both of these photogra- phers went beyond the conventional representa- tions of the picturesque and the sublime; of grand vistas, formidable canyons and waterfalls found in all pictorial accounts of the highlands (Haf- steinsson 1994). While amply illustrating the large-scale land forms and the overall scenic char- acter of these landscapes, the photographers jux- taposed this with smaller and gentler features, their photos revealing a great variety of colours, natural forms and forms of animal and plant life. This surprised many viewers who had not had any close encounters with the area and assumed that it was simply a grey and lifeless desert - a some- what similar assessment to that of Thoroddsen in the early twentieth century, but without the mys- tery. Rock formations, rivers, birds and animals appeared in these haunting photographs as glimpses of violated landscapes, the visual lan- guage silently exposing the shaky ideological premises of the hydropower project. A philoso- pher and cultural critic observed that Axelsson's photos really were: a reflection on a world that was - nature al- ready sentenced to death in the name of inter- ests which nobody is totally certain are the real interests in the long run. ... The decision has been made, but the sacrifice is neverthe- less obvious: a sacrifice of life. It therefore looks as if those who make the decision - those who speak for rationality, those who speak for industry and economy - have to make a leap of faith in the end: carry out the sacrifice in the blindness of one who really does not know what the future holds yet puts trust in one's religious conviction. (Olafsson 2003, pp. 80-81) One photograph, or rather one motif, proved par- ticularly capable of moving hearts and minds. This was a very distinctive rock (Fig. 2), situated right on the bank of the river, at the bottom of the future res- ervoir behind the dam at Kdirahnjuikar. Located in a spot very seldom visited by human travellers, this rock formation had been almost unknown previ- ously except to a few farmers from the valley be- low. Axelsson's photo effectively highlighted the anthropomorphic features of the rock. The caption to the photo invoked a connection with folklore: 212 ?

'The hermit by the river'. Source: Published with the permission of photographer Ragnar Axelsson. The mean-looking stone troll is one of nature's many artworks in the area. The troll, who is a little higher than a human, is on the western bank of JMkulsMi and looks towards the east. (Axelsson 2002, pp. 10-11) The photo became an instant hit. Conservationists found in this visually arresting figure a potent icon- ic symbol; a silent spokesperson who turned out to be particularly effective in conveying the message that the Kairahnj6kar project was an affront against Nature and landscapes. The anthropomorphic stone figure who "stood guard" on the river bank in- vested the landscape with a moral purpose. Inter- estingly, following the initial publication of Axels- son's photo,8 the figure was not generally presented as a 'mean-looking stone troll' but was referred to in somewhat gentler terms as 'Einbuinn viO Jiklu' (the hermit at river J6kla) or 'Gljtifrabiinn mikli' (the great gorge dweller), hinting at mental forti- tude and invoking romantic sentiments, with strong references to the old visual category of the sublime. This was "romancing the stone" through photo- graphic means. Now, it would be simple to dismiss these sen- timents as irrational emotion brought forth by simple photographic propaganda techniques, and/ or as yet another example of how landscape and its representations are never an "innocent" tabula ra- sa, but always a social construction (Hafsteinsson 1994; Friday 1999). But this would be to miss the point somewhat. Indeed, a critical deconstruction is both possible and appropriate. The power of the photographs was the result of plain scenic attrac- tiveness of the landscape seen through the eyes of the general Icelandic public, as well as of refer- ences to natural history, mythology and national- ism. A particular space was being produced and animated through their conscious use. But what I precisely wanted to highlight was the power of a story of landscape told with visual means to bring about deep emotional feeling (which is not to be taken lightly, even if that is all too often the case) and to activate moral sentiments of care. A story which, for a while, provided an effective and much-needed counterpoint to the reductionist sto- ries of engineering prowess and economic returns, that had dictated the terms of the debate about these landscapes. But back to the stone hermit by the river. Con- servationists and their opponents alike were stunned when Morgunbladid told its readers in May 2005 that he had ceased to stand his guard, felled by the river itself some time during the pre- vious winter. To many, this seemed highly symbol- ic of the defeat suffered by Iceland's conservation- ist movement in its struggle against the corpora- tions and "power politicians" during the Kairahn- jdkar conflict. Conclusion What I have tried to argue in this paper is that, de- spite dubious past connotations with superficiality and lack of substance, critical geographers cannot afford to dismiss the importance of the "scenic" - of @ The author 2007 213 Journal compilation @ 2007 Swedish Society for Anthropology and Geography</page><page sequence="12">KARL BENEDIKTSSON sensing and interpreting Nature in visual ways - when thinking and writing about landscapes. Rather than shy away from the visual substance of land- scapes on grounds of a timid and ill-founded "sceno- phobia", a geography of landscape is needed which takes visual values seriously, while simultaneously acknowledging the experiential complexity of land- scape appreciation. The "scenic" is an indispensable part of a more comprehensive aesthetic of nature which, in accordance with the Deweyan approach, does involve all senses and indeed the body as a whole (cf. Lund 2005). Attendance to the visual does not necessarily have to lead down the well- trodden path of objectification and detachment. On the contrary, it is a necessary part of democratic and inclusive politics of landscape where there is room for various interpretive takes. This is not to argue for a new metanarrative about universal aesthetic values and how to account for them. On the contrary, I con- cur with Godlovich (1998, p. 184), when he states: [t]here is no one final fitting affective or in- tellectual response, no definite hedonic or cognitive payoff, and with that no authorita- tive prescriptions from some master-race of nature critics and connoisseurs to be fol- lowed obediently by some underclass of adu- latory bumpkins. An "aesthetic of engagement" in the manner pro- posed by Berleant (1992, 1997) does acknowl- edge the emotional part of the aesthetic experi- ence, which is subjective through and through. But does this translate well into a politics of land- scape? Well, it could and should: 'Emotions pro- vide us with a vital means of attunement... to a sit- uation. And they have a message. They are what matters' (Thrift 1999, p. 314). Part of the project of a politically astute landscape geography would also be to reveal the subjective and emotional con- tent of the ostensibly "detached" sciences of en- gineering and economics, which usually provide political decision-makers with "objective" ration- ales for such large-scale landscape transforma- tions as that on which I have centred my discus- sion. One might here recall maverick economist McCloskey (1990) who some time ago insisted that economics was to a large extent a rhetorical exercise, or story-telling. On the subject of emotion, one well-worn and often disparaged aesthetic concept is particularly interesting, evoking as it does complex emotional responses. This is the concept of the sublime, which has a long pedigree in aesthetic discussion. Berleant has suggested that the sublime might af- ter all prove valuable for the aesthetics of engage- ment. As he puts it, its central idea is 'the capacity of the natural world to act on so monumental a scale as to exceed our powers of framing and con- trol' (Berleant 1992, p. 234), which may, if noth- ing else, provide a valuable counter-narrative to technological hyperbole. Cloke and Jones, taking due notice of the critiques of Nature-culture dualism mentioned earlier in the paper, have argued cogently for a renewed "ethical mindfulness" that would be 'both place-located and bound into wider relational matrices' (Cloke and Jones 2003, p. 212). They point to 'the importance of enchantment as a prompt to personal moral impuls- es' (Cloke and Jones 2003, p. 211, emphasis added). Perhaps what is needed for a geography of landscape politics is not only an aesthetic of engagement but of enchantment; an emotional state frequently and rath- er easily afforded by the sublime and grandiose, but also by less spectacular landscapes, once one allows oneself to dwell therein. Bennett (2001, p. 5) explains that enchantment involves: the temporary suspension of chronological time and bodily movement. To be enchant- ed... is to participate in a momentarily immo- bilizing encounter; it is to be transfixed, spell- bound. ... Thoughts, but also limbs.., are brought to rest, even as the senses continue to operate, indeed, in high gear. You notice new colors, discern details previously ignored, hear extraordinary sounds, as familiar land- scapes of sense sharpen and intensify. Sure, stories about enchanting landscapes are being told all the time. The trick is to foster a culture that will listen to and respect them. This may well prove to be a tall order, but I think geographers should try to do their bit.

This statement was made by a rural inhabitant in east Ice- land in June 2003 in an interview with Edda Ruth Hlfn Waage for a research project about the national parks and local community development (see Benediktsson and Por- variard6ttir 2005; Benediktsson and Waage 2005). 2. In a recent book, Flyvbjerg et al. (2003) observe that infra- structural "megaprojects" seem to have their own peculiar logic, which makes them irresistible to government. Al- though this is not the subject of this paper, the Kirahnj6kar project obviously lends itself well to such analysis. 3. This is not to say that these landscapes have not been affect- ed by human actions. Most notably, centuries of grazing have greatly changed the vegetation and contributed to se- vere soil erosion (cf. e.g. Arnalds 1987). 4. Cronon's many and erudite writings in environmental histo- ry (e.g. Cronon 1983, 1991) are in fact clearly grounded in ecological discourse. Interestingly, he has even been charged with overlooking the metaphoric character of that discourse: of conflating the concepts of ecology with Nature as such (Demeritt 1994). 5. I am using the term very literally here ('the love of looking') but not in its most common meaning, voyeurism, although such usage would, for example, chime well with Rose's (1993) feminist critique of "the gaze" in geography. 6. The second phase of the master plan is in progress when this paper is published. It will include a refinement and exten- sion of the work on landscape classification and evaluation. 7. Thoroddsen was a highly respected natural scientist and the first Icelander to study geography at university, in Copenha- gen in the 1870s. He was an inveterate traveller who surveyed and mapped much of Iceland's interior for the first time. 8.
