<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CEREMONIAL ROLE OF THE MAYA FLANGED CENSER MARILYN GOLDSTEIN Columbia University, New York The development of the composite censer can be traced from incipient forms found at La Venta, Chicharras Phase, flanged cylindrical bases from Middle Preclassic levels at Chiapa del Corzo and Izapa, and tall, three-pronged cylinders from Preclassic Kaminaljuyu. The form achieved its greatest elaboration in Late Classic Palenque. Thereafter, from the Post- classic through the ethnographic present, the composite censer, although decreasing in complexity, continued in use in rituals beseeching rains, fertility and health. The complex Late Classic composite censer bases are tall flanged cylinders decorated with deeply modelled tiers of figures. Iconographically, these figures display a consistent pattern: in the upper tiers, small bats, owls, serpent-winged birds, anthropomorphic insects, and other symbols of deified ancestors and the underworld; in the lower tiers, a large head or full figure representation oftheJaguar God of the Underworld stands on the old turtle-carapaced wind god. The ritualistic concerns suggested by these deities are rain, fertility and health, indicating a continuity of ceremonial role. Among American Indians, the burning of incense is an important ceremonial act serving as a means of communication between man and the supernatural. In the innumerable rituals of the Classic Maya, many kinds of censers were used. These varied in form from small undecorated bowls to ornately modelled five-part structures, and ranged from two inches in height and breadth to almost four feet in height and thirty inches in breadth. The largest and most elaborate of Maya censers are the flanged cylindrical censers with tiered figures (figs. I, 4, 5), found in caves, temples, and water sources. This suggests that they were used in rituals connected with the under- world, water and fertility (caves are considered entrances to the underworld and sources of both water and fertility). The elaborateness of their decoration-richly modelled tiers of figures and expanded flanges with additional motifs-permits of iconographic study that may serve to identify the specific deities to whom these censers were dedicated. In this study, an attempt will be made (a) to trace the historical development of the cylindrical censer with tiered figures, (b) to analyse its style, (c) to interpret its decorative motifs, and (d) to use the data thus obtained to determine its ceremonial role. The so-called 'flanged cylindrical censer' is actually the base of a composite censer; conical dishes for burning copal are placed on top of it (fig. 3a). The bases themselves, like many components of composite censers, hold no copal and show no evidence of smoking. Such components are difficult to identify as parts of censers and are frequently misclassified.

Eric Thompson uncovered a cache in San Jose, British Honduras, containing two obsidian points a nd a group of five ceramic objects: one cylinder, one smoke-blackened dish, and three prongs. The prongs were classified as chilli mashers, the cylinder a censer, and the dish a comale pan. It was not until I959, that Borhegyi, after studying Guatemalan censer forms, was able to demonstrate that all five ceramic objects were component parts of one 'Assemble- it-yourself' censer; the dish rests on the three prongs, which fit neatly into the slits on top of the cylinder. Since the copal was burned only on the dish, neither the cylinder nor the prongs had ever become smoke-blackened. Another example of the difficulty of accurate identification is a Preclassic ceramic object from Copan which Longyear (I952: fig. 42a) described as three- footed. It needed only to be inverted to be correctly reidentified (Borhegyi I959: fig. 86b) as the three-pronged base of an 'Assemble-it-yourself' censer. In I973, reports describing flat and conical dishes found resting on top of flanged cylinders decorated with tiered figures (Moises Morales' personal communication to Michael Coe), enabled cylinders of that type to be definitively classified, for the first time, as censer bases. However, a great number of composite censer com- ponents of other types still awaits proper identification. Composite censers are not limited to Maya examples; specimens have been reported from locations as distant as Ecuador (Borhegyi I95I: fig. 3) and Western Mexico (Pace Gallery, N.Y., Feb. I973), and periods as late as the Postconquest (Gann I934: fig. I3), and the ethnographic present (Frans Blom Museum, San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas, Mexico). Borhegyi (I950) was of the opinion that the composite censer form originated in Preclassic Kaminaljuyu. However, the shape of Kaminaljuyu censers (fig. 2) appears to be too complex to represent an initial stage of development. Moreover, the decoration reveals a well-established and complex iconography, suggesting an extensive earlier development. Two Olmec objects may be tentatively identified as precursory examples. Drucker (I952: I2I) classifies as 'pot rests', ceramic objects found in nearly all stratigraphic levels at the Olmec site of La Venta. He describes the objects as heavy discs of clay mounted on high, slotted, annular bases. Because of their structural similarity to later examples, these objects are better identified as early forms of the composite censer; the disc of clay serving as the copal plate, and the annular base as the censer base. In addition, at the Olmec site of San Lorenzo, Michael Coe (personal communication, I974) uncovered an even earlier example of a three- pronged composite censer which he dates to the Chicharras phase, I250-II50 B.C. Examples such as the foregoing indicate that many more early forms of composite censer await discovery. Borhegyi (I950: Iio) expressed the opinion that although examples of cylin- drical censer bases 'are widely separated in time and space, iconographic and formal similarities suggest that they all pertained to a single cult.' Lowe's study of Izapan censers led him to revise Borhegyi's theory. He suggests that although, A single and original religious motivation perhaps was connected with the concept of the three pronged incensario, its local elaboration must have been different ... prompted at least by parallel religious innovations which took place as regional cultures developed their peculiar characteristics (I965: 56).</page><page sequence="4">408 MARILYN GOLDSTEIN According to either theory, in tracing the development of the composite censer, we are also tracing the development of a single religious cult, or of related mytho- logical concepts. Although the early evidence is fragmentary, it may indicate great antiquity for both the composite censer form and possibly related religious con- cepts. FIGURE 2 II While the paucity of evidence precludes tracing the development of the censer base prior to the Middle Preclassic period, its development from the Middle Preclassic to the ethnographic present can readily be followed. Middle and Late Preclassic remains (900 B.C.-A.D. 300), principally from the side of Kaminaljuyu in Guatemala, and the surrounding area, have provided over two hundred composite</page><page sequence="5">MARILYN GOLDSTEIN 409 censer bases. All are tall, open cylinders crowned with three prongs. They can be divided into two types, on the basis of their decoration. In one type, the body of the cylinder is decorated with an open geometric pattern, and the prongs with modelled faces. In the second type (fig. 2), the prongs are undecorated; the body has narrow flanges, and modelled on one side, in vertical formation, are one or two super- natural heads, e.g. animals wearing knotted head-dresses and deities with prominent frontal incisors. Pronged cylindrical censers dating to the Middle Preclassic, have also been found at the site of Chiapa de Corzo (Lowe &amp; Mason I965: fig. 8), and at neighbouring Izapa, in Chiapas, Mexico (Lowe I965: 54, 55). In addition, Izapa stelae 5, i8, 24 and Kaminaljuyu stela ii contribute positive sculptural evidence of the Preclassic use of censers. The relief on Stela i8 at Izapa (Norman 1973: plate 28) includes the representation of a ceremony in which a tall cylindrical censer, decorated with a mythological head, serves as the focal point: Izapa Stela 24 clearly shows two cylindrical censers in ceremonial use. Early Classic (30o-600 A.D.) remains, on the other hand, have yielded surprisingly few censer bases. These are less complex in shape and decoration than the Pre- classic examples, e.g. they no longer have prongs, the copal dish resting directly on a shortened cylinder. In some examples the copal dish is given a cylindrical form and decorated as an integral part of the base. The cylinders continue being decorated on one side with supernatural images arranged in vertical columns. Although the phenomenon of decreased number and complexity of composite censers may be ascribed to insufficient archaeological investigation, it may reflect an Early Classic decrease in popularity for the composite censer and any associated rituals. The Late Classic (A.D. 60o-900), in contrast, witnessed a great fluorescence of the composite censer. Flanged-cylindrical bases are reported from a wide geographical area including both Highland and Lowland Guatemala, Honduras, Belize, Sal- vador, and Mexico. Many of these censers were even more complex in form and elaborate in decoration than Preclassic examples. The cylinders, although lacking prongs, were taller, some reaching 4 ft in height; the flanges wider, some measuring eighteen in. across. The decoration was more complex; the number of tiered figures increased from the Preclassic maximum of two to a maximum of seven, and the flanges were enriched with additional symbols. In some examples, notably from Tikal and Isla de Sacrificios (W. Coe I967: I8), the decoration continued from the base on to the incense bowl, while in other examples, principally from the Palenque region, decoration was limited to the base itself (figs. 3a and b). In the Postclassic (A.D. 900-1521), although composite censers continued to enjoy wide geographic distribution and increased height-a late Veracruz example is 5 ft. high-their decoration was greatly simplified. The wide flanges atrophied and the tiered mythological figures telescoped into a single image. The Postconquest (A.D. 1521 to the present), not surprisingly, witnessed a col- lapse of censer monumentality. The base was reduced by half in height; the flanges all but disappeared; the decorative figures, rather than being deeply modelled and greatly detailed, were merely suggested. This simple censer base continues in use in the ethnographic present, suggesting the possibility that the associated deities are still being propitiated.</page><page sequence="6">4IO MARILYN GOLDSTEIN Throughout its development, the modelled decoration of the censer base is closely allied to stone sculpture traditions. It is possible that the earliest censer bases were constructed of stone. Preclassic Kaminaljuyu remains include monumental (almost eight feet high) three-pronged censer bases carved of stone (Guatemala City National Museum collection). At Palenque, as well, stone counterparts of the ceramic flanged bases are found (Rands &amp; Rands I947). Furthermore, the closest parallels in both composition and style to the figures modelled on clay censers is found on stone reliefs. Parallels to the figures modelled on Early Classic censers are found on Early Classic jade plaques. Surprisingly, Late Classic Palenque bases show specific similarities to Early Copan stelae (Rands I968). FIGUE 3a</page><page sequence="7">MARILYN GOLDSTEIN FIGURE 3b</page><page sequence="8">4I2 MARILYN GOLDSTEIN In summary, the composite censer with associated rituals was apparently intro- duced by the Olmec in the Early Preclassic, and subsequently developed and en- riched by the Izapans and the Highland Maya in the Middle and Late Preclassic. During the Early Classic period, the form seemed to decline in popularity and complexity, but flourished again in the Late Classic period, reaching the apogee of its complexity and elaboration. From the Postclassic to the ethnographic present, the 'Assemble-it-yourself' censer continued in use in simpler form. Clearly, the Late Classic flanged-cylindrical censer bases, with their wide ornate flanges and tiered figures, were the high point of an artistic and ritualistic tradition which had great geographical breadth and historic depth. It should be noted that develop- ments outside the Maya area, although not discussed here, greatly influenced Maya censer traditions. III The present appearance of the Late Classic flanged censer bases differs from that at the time of their construction. They were made of a typical incensario ware, a coarse unslipped, reddish brown clay, fired at a comparatively low temperature and therefore, non-durable. The figures at the top and bottom of the cylinders tended to disintegrate, and whole sections of decoration fell off. The censers were richly coloured with post-fired paints. These have proven fugitive and only traces of colour remain. In addition, some censers were found heavily coated with white lime that had dripped from cave walls. The Late Classic cylindrical bases, ranging in height from i8 to 44 in., are completely open top and bottom with additional openings cut into the body of the cylinder. While one side is plain, the other is decorated with figures and/or heads. These are modelled or moulded separately and luted to the cylinder one above the other, forming a single decorative column. The second figure from the bottom is always the largest and most deeply modelled; those above and below it are smaller in size and more shallow in relief Wide flanges (occasionally with small tabs, e.g. figs. 4, 5) rise from a point near the bottom of the cylinder to the very top. A wide lip runs across the top of the flanges and continues around the cylinder providing a strong horizontal design element. The flanges are frequently divided into horizontal registers and richly decorated with appliqued figures and symbols. The parallelism of composition described above suggests the possibility of a correspondingly parallelism of theme. As there is a consistent pattern of relation- ships between the tiers of figures, it is predicted that the horizontal levels are con- sistent in meaning: that all bottom figures represent the same concept; that all figures in second position likewise represent the same concept; and that all suc- ceeding levels are equally consistent. In addition, it is assumed that a whole figure may replace a face or mask without effecting any change of meaning-in Pre- columbian tradition, a face, mask, or any distinguishing part of an image may represent the entire image. The motifs on each level, masks and figures alike, will be interpreted as cohesive, symbolic units. IV On the second level of most flanged censer bases is a dominant male figure with specific, easily identifiable characteristics: a 'cruller' which twists over the bridge</page><page sequence="9">MARlLYN GOLDSTEIN 4I3 W ~ ~ W I I~S -4 _~~i FIUE4</page><page sequence="10">414 MARELYN GOLDSTEIN 9 A&amp;D go, 4m MORWID - - d I .4 )r% I 6 I 1) I I a qw t RGURE 4b</page><page sequence="11">MARILYN GOLDSTEIN 415 of his nose, a pair ofjaguar ears above his human ones, a multi-pointed goatee, a large 'tau' shaped front tooth, and a great hank of hair tied in a top knot at the front of his head (figs. I, 3a, 4b). Other features which appear optional in his rep- resentation are: a five-spiked head ornament; crossed sky bands with a central dot somewhere on his personage; and below his eyes, a triangular motif composed of a horizontal band and two squared dots, the Maya notation for the number seven. NP FIGUE 5 These characteristics easily identify him as one of the better known Maya deities, the Jaguar God of the Underworld (Thompson I96o: I34). In Maya theology, each of the numerals and each of the twenty named days is a god. The Jaguar God of the Underworld is god of the number seven and of the third Maya day called Akbal (night, darkness) or Uotan (Thompson I96o: 73). A deity called Uotan or Votan was worshipped by the seventeenth century Yucatec</page><page sequence="12">4I6 MARILYN GOLDSTEIN Maya (Nun'iez de la Vega I702: 9, I0; Thompson I960: 73). Thompson argues, convincingly, that the Jaguar God of the Underworld is, in fact, Votan. Maya rites propitiating Votan (his name varies from area to area, but his attributes remain the same) and his subordinates have been reported from the seventeenth century to the ethnographic present, and these accounts correlate well with each other. In the seventeenth century report of Nitiez de la Vega (I702: 9, io), Votan is said to have created the cave in which he was worshipped, 'by blowing (wind), and in it place tapirs and a great treasure of hieroglyphic materials and jades (symbols for water), naming a woman with certain guardians to care for it,' (Thompson I960: 73). This cave concealed 'heathen idols' and 'pottery jars' sealed with pottery lids. The latter were probably composite censers, the 'pottery jars' being cylindrical bases and the 'pottery lids' dishes for copal. Later ethnographic reports describe Votan's treasure as including barrels of rain, animals, and vegetable seeds; and the servants who care for these treasures as being small, evil winds, called, in some accounts (Brinton I890; Roys I933), the Pauahtuns. They care for the animals and the plant seeds, and carry the rain waters around the world. Votan is seen as an ancient earth and underworld deity, progenitor of younger gods and of all the Maya. He is the powerful 'Master of the Mountains and Valleys', owner of the wild animals and the sacred corn seed, and thus responsible for providing an abundant food supply. He is also thought of as the primal potter who constructed the first censer and taught the Maya how to use it to communicate with the gods. Votan's servants, the Pauahtuns are also envisaged as ancient, ancestral deities. They are sometimes described as the children of Votan who, because they were evil-broke sexual taboos, were punished by being made eternal wanderers (winds). In spite of their punishments they remain malevolent creatures. All evil, illness, and death are brought by them. They must be actively propitiated by offerings and ceremonies. Like most Maya gods, Votan and the Pauahtuns were conceived as both single and multiple deities. In addition, the Pauahtuns were directional gods. Each Pauahtun was assigned a cardinal direction, an associated colour, and a corner of the underworld where he helped support the earth. As indicated above, Votan has been identified in Classic Maya representations as the Jaguar God of the Underworld. Like other Maya deities, he may be portrayed with sun attributes. On some censer bases (figs. 2, 3a), he is represented with the sun god's filed central incisor (Thompson I970: 292) and a halo of sun rays. Thomp- son (I960: I34) notes that the Jaguar God of the Underworld 'appears to be merged with the night sun'. Anders (I960: 202-5) concludes that the jaguar is a solar symbol. Michael Coe (I974: personal communication) suggests that thejaguar God of the Underworld may be considered during the day as the sun travelling from east to west in the sky, and in the night as one of the principal lords of the under- world returning from west to east under the earth. Thus, he would be seen to migrate daily between the world of the living and the world of the dead. While he is generally considered an ancient deity, on the censers he is represented, apparently interchangeably, as both mature and youthful (figs. 3a, 3b). The Quiche</page><page sequence="13">MARILYN GOLDSTEIN 4I7 Maya epic, the Popol Vuh, describes the sun as having been a young earth lord, one of twin hero brothers, sired by a supernatural being. After an early death, he rises to the sky to become the new sun. Therefore, portraying the Jaguar God of the Underworld, who may also be a personification of the sun, as both aged and youthful is consistent with Maya mythological ideas. In Maya thought, the concepts of sun and lord are interrelated. The same words express both concepts. The name of the twentieth Maya day, 'Ahau' or 'Ahou', means both sun and lord. On a few of the censer bases (fig. 4a), the second level figures, although portrayed in a manner similar to the others, have no super- natural characteristics. This may be an attempt to glorify Maya nobles by rep- resenting them in the position of gods. Furthermore, it is possible that some of the figures represented with supernatural characteristics are also portraits of Maya nobles represented in the guise of gods, 'god impersonators'. V At the base of the censers, a variety of images are found, such as tapir-like masks (figs. I, 5), turtles with turtle or human heads (figs. 3a, 3b), and cauac glyph monsters (fig. 4b). As predicted previously, all images positioned at the same level may represent the same deity or concept. The tapir-like mask appearing at the lowest level on the five censers found in the Temple of the Foliated Cross, Palenque (fig. 5), was identified by Ruz (i969: 58) as, 'la mascara de la deidad de la tierra'. All other lowest level images can, likewise, be related to the earth deity Votan, or his servants, the wind gods (the Pauahtuns). Support for the identification of the lowest of the tiered figures as Pauahtuns can also be derived from Maya hieroglyphics. A popular glyph figure, labelled God N, has been progressively identified as Votan (Schellhas I904; Forstemann I906; Thompson I950), the Bacabs (Thompson I970), and the Pauahtuns (M. Coe I973). God N is recognised in full figure representations, as well as glyphic forms. Full figure representations usually reveal a bent old man with either a turtle carapace or snail shell on his back. He wears a characteristic headdress with a large central knot which sometimes contains a 'tun' glyph. The two sides of the headdress are divided in half horizontally and frequently crosshatched in a significant netted design. Thus, the symbols used to identify God N are the turtle carapace, the snail shell, the headdress element, the netted design (frequently in a triangular shape), the 'tun ', and its substitute (Coe I973: I 5) the 'cauac' glyph. The glyphs for God N usually have the headdress element (double loop superfix) above a 'tun', a 'cauac , or a snail shell. They are often preceded by the numbers four or five, and associated with directional signs, and would be transcribed as 'the four God Ns,' or as, 'the God N of the South'. The association of number and directional signs with God N's name glyph supports his identification as either Bacab or Pauahtun, rather than as Votan who is not a direction-oriented deity. Thompson (1970: 276-80) interprets the symbols of the God N glyph as ideo- grams related to Bacab mythology; for example, the lopped headdress element with netted design as an ideogram for bees' wings. The component symbols of the God N glyphs, however, can also be related, as ideograms, to Pauahtun mythology; the carapace and shell, for example, as fauna associated with the Pauahtun's watery</page><page sequence="14">4I8 MARILYN GOLDSTEIN abodes, or the netted headdress element as hunting nets. Furthermore, as Michael Coe (I975: IS) points out, a phonetic reading of the God N hieroglyph may be pauotun'. Thus, data derived from two sources, Maya ethnographic studies and Maya hieroglyphics, permit the identification of all images that appear at the base of the censers-the masks of tapir-like creatures, tun or cauac monster masks, and turtles with human or turtle faces as symbols of Votan's servants. VI Linguistically, there is evidence of a relationship between Pauahtuns and censers. The Motul (I939 Dictionary) glosses words closely related to 'pauotun' as censer or censer maker. For example, the word 'pat om' is glossed 'ollero o alfarero en general oficial do cosas de barro'; 'pat cum' is 'hazer ollas'; 'patbal' 'ser hechas cosas de barro, cera, o massa'; and 'patbil' is glossed 'cosa hecha o formada de barro o masa'. As indicated above, the bottom tier seems reserved for symbols of Votan's servants; the second tier for representations of Votan himself The upper tiers are occupied by a variety of underworld deities. These include the Bat God, the Owl God (fig. i), the Long-lipped God, the Jester God, a deity with an empty car- touche in his forehead (fig. 4a), and a mythological bird with the head of a feathered serpent included in his wing design (figs. I, 5). The inclusion of these figures in the upper tiers is apparently optional, for in many examples none of them appears (fig. 3a), while in other examples, as many as three different heads mount one above the other (fig. 5). As the inclusion of these figures is optional, their significance is not deemed essential to the basic meaning of the censer. It should be noted, however, that the Bat God, the Owl God, and presumably the mythological bird, are deities who travel between the world of the living and the world of the dead, frequently bearing messages from one to the other. This fact gains in interpretive significance when one recalls that incense smoke is also understood to be a message-bearing traveller from the world of the living to the world of the spirits, and, furthermore, that the Jaguar God, himself, migrates daily between the same two worlds. The upper tier images seem to echo and lend emphasis to a theme suggested by the lower images, the com- munication between the world above and the world below. JL FIGURE 6. The Cib Hieroglyph Sometimes, at the top of these great columns of deity representations is a little anthropomorphic flying insect (fig. 5) or a 'Cib' hieroglyph (fig. 6). It is appar- ently connected with Votan as the head variant of the Cib glyph is the Jaguar God, while the symbolic variant is a section of a univalve shell, a Votan-Pauahtun symbol. The day Cib, according to ethnographic sources (Tax I947: 486), is the day on which ancestral spirits visit the homes of their descendants. The modern Maya are certain that the spirits of their ancestors are linked to the</page><page sequence="15">MARILYN GOLDSTEIN 4I9 censer bases. Some believe that their ancestors' spirits dwell inside the censers (Redfield I94I: 232); others believe that theinsect-like personifications of ancestral spirits are censers come to life. Past generations of Maya knew how to control the spirits of the ancient censer bases, e.g. They were only of clay, but they made them come alive. They burned copal in one, for nine days and nine nights, without sleeping at all. Then the alux came alive (Redfield I94I: I2I). The Maya of today no longer know how to control the ancient censers, and, therefore, fear and avoid them. In addition to the decoration on the cylinder of the censers, modelled motifs in low relief decorate the flanges. These flange motifs appear peripheral to the central theme. Various non-specific elements are introduced, such as crossed sky bands (figs. 4a, s), circular floral motifs (figs. I, 4), intertwining celestial serpents (figs. 4a, s)-these are closely related to Izapan celestial polymorphs-see Quirarte I973), serpent heads without lower jaws (figs. 4a, s), monkeys, and guardian figures (figs. 3a, 3b). The last are of special interest, standing as they do on either side of the Jaguar God of the Underworld, bearing spears and shields. They are characterised by the long upturned nose of a jester, a single filed incisor, a multi-pointed goatee, and a great hank of hair hanging forward over the forehead. While all the flange motifs require additional research, these guardian figures merit special attention. VII An image's position in the composition, its relative size and depth of carving are all indications of iconographic importance. Only two images are consistently represented on cylindrical censers bases, and, therefore, must express their central theme. These images are the Jaguar God of the Underworld (Votan) dominating in both size and position the evil wind deities. They may be interpreted as the victory of the forces of life and health (the sun) over the forces of evil and illness (the winds). Finally, Borhegyi's original contention that the composite censer, throughout its history was associated with a single cult appears supported. In the mythological past, Votan created the first censer and gave it to the Maya with accompanying ritual. In the Preclassic period, composite flanged censer bases were decorated with representation of a deity with prominent frontal incisors mounted above a mytho- logical animal wearing a knotted headdress (fig. 2). These motifs are so similar to the Votan-Pauahtun representations on Late Classic bases that it appears likely that Preclassic composite censers were also dedicated to a Votan-Pauahtun cult. Classic period flanged censers have been found only in temples, caves, wells, and other water sources, all known Votan-Pauahtun habitats. The Maya of today continue to conduct incense-burning ceremonies beseeching water, human health, and animal and crop fertility at similar locations. The ceremonial function of the composite censer may be basically unchanged after three thousand years of cultural evolution. REFERENCES Anders, Ferdinand I963. Das Pantheon der Maya.
