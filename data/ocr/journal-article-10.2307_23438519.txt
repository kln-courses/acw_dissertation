If we are to rely on the evidence provided in a variety of philosophical texts in India's post-Vedic period and to derive from them the diverse concepts of creation, the conclusion that will be inevitably reached on the subject is that the idea of creation of the world or worlds as an act of an anthropomorphic God is being gradually abandoned by the Indian philosopher. The legacy of the Rgveda with all its cosmogonie tales and theories, though many of their elements — expanded, enriched and further allegorized — find their respectable place in the purânic and epic literature as well as in later modified popular cults is receding into the mythological lore. Yet it is heeded by the Indian philosopher with as much respect and consideration (though oftentimes with ridicule) as it is regarded by most of us now. Although gone is the magnificence of Prajâpati, Indra, Varuna, Dhâtr, Agni, Purusa (in his Rgvedic form) and other deities whom the Vedas had acknow ledged as primary or ancillary architects of the worlds and their inhabitants,1 and although with the withering of the cult of their personalities was also fading the reverence of their demiurgical performances, many of their sym bolic potentials penetrated into the realm of later cosmogonie speculations even if the fundamental concepts of creation underwent a drastic or, indeed, revolutionary changes. There is little doubt that for a very long period the traditional veneration of the Vedic creator or creators lingered simultaneously with the 'philosophical' ideas. Evidence at our disposal indicates clearly that along with the mytho theistic concepts of cosmogony, other 'scientific' ideas were making their way. In their listings of the various theories of creation the SU, the MK and subse quently the GK2 almost completely refrain from direct references to the Vedas or at least to the Samhitâ texts.

Reidel Publishing Company, Dordrecht-Holland</page><page sequence="2">52 ARNOLD KUNST In SU (1.1 and 1.2) first a question is addressed to the experts (brahmavidas) about the origin of existence.3 Then the various current theories of world origin and life are listed. These are time (kala), natural selection (svabhava), the fixed determinism, 'Notwendigkeit' (niyati), contingency (yadrccha), the elements (bhûtâni), (universal) matrix (yoni), and purusa. The possibility of the individual âtman as an aggregate of these origins of creation is in the context of this list rejected, since âtman is subjected to empirical experience (sukha and duhkha) and is not a free agent. Nâgâijuna's Akutobhayâ to MK 1.1 enumerates similar theories but (acc. to Walleser's renderings from Chinese and Tibetan versions) the list adds Visnu and/or Mahes'vara and the vikara doctrine, and replaces bhûtâni by anu. The GK (I, 7-9) lists as existing theories of creation 'expansion' vibhüti, vision in a dream (svapnamâyâ), the artefact of God's desire (icchâmâtram prabhoh), time (kála), object of use (bhogârtha), object/(or result?)/of/(divine?) play (kridartha)', in GK II, 19—27 the list of the theories is continued, but it applies not so much to the origin of creation as to the 'false' views on creation itself. In this way the essence of creation is viewed as breath (prônas), elements (bhûtâni), constituents (gunâs), separate units (tattvani), parts (pâdâs), objects [of cognition] (visayâs), spheres (lokâs), deities-elements (devâs), vedâs, sacrifices (yajñas), consumer (bhokta), objects of use (bhojyam), fine matter (suksma°), gross matter (sthûla0), material object (mûrtah), non material object (amürtah), time (kalah), directions (dis'as), words (vadas), beings (bhûvanâni), intellect (manas), consciousness (buddhis), concept (cittam), merit and demerit (dharmadharmau), the 25th, 31st or the indefinite [scil. hypostases of Purusa] ,4 the worlds5 (lokâh), stages of life or castes (âsramâh), linguistic phenomena,6 the higher and the lower [scil. brahma] (parâparam), production and destruction (srsti and laya), stability (sthitis).7 However tedious these lists of theories of the world's origin may be, they may be worthy of attention as, on the one hand they show the current cosmogonie theories, and on the other, they indicate the gradual drastic changes in emphases on the ideas concerning the processes of becoming. The most interesting development shown in the lists is the virtual absence of any interest in the originator, who, as is also testified by other texts, (a) is com pletely redundant, (b) renders an ancillary service to a higher being by performing work which the higher being deems to be undignified. Creation itself is (a) a chain of progress from one stage to another without the help of any generator and follows the order established by natural selection</page><page sequence="3">MAN - THE CREATOR 53 and by the a priori established causal nexus between specific homogeneous objects or events, or is (b) a projection of the mind endowed with the urge to create for purely soteriologjcal purposes; it creates in order to destroy creation by using it merely as a platform on which soteriological processes can be played out. As in most instances, when crude divisions of ideas are attempted, the division suggested above tends to oversimplify matters. The concepts of creator and creation not infrequently contradict each other. In other cases they overlap or supplement each other giving a seldom justified impression of a syncretization of ideas. The examples of lists just presented show also a vast range of diverse con cepts of creation propagated by the so-called orthodox and non-orthodox schools. They include not only the Sâmkhya and the Yoga, the Vedânta, the Vais'esikas, the Naiyâyikas, the Buddhists, the Cârvàkas, the ÂjTvikas, the Jains, the Saivas, the Sàktas, and the Vaisnavas, but also many splinter groups which formed their own ideas hiding more or less blatantly behind the formally adopted siddhântas. As on many other questions of philosophical or religious import, divergent ideas of creation are not infrequently encountered within the confines of one school. As one of the best instances of such discrepancies may serve the older Upanisads which, in spite of Sankara's, Ràmânuja's, and Ànandatïrtha's (to mention only the most significant ones) commentaries and intimations to the contrary, not only expound contradictory theories, but further testify to the fact that anything but a uniform philosophy can be found in these early Upanisads.8 However, the liberties taken by the principal exegetes in their commentaries on the Upanisads, and their references thereto in the commen taries to the Vedântâsûtra show that the main trends in the development of ideas on creation were fixed on the s'ruti, in our case the Upanisads, which had become a useful and convenient authority as the only apparently genuine exposition of the Vedas.9 As mentioned before, loyalties to the Vedas in their Samhitâ form, the myths, the sectarian and regional cults, the up- and downgrading of individual gods and heroes linger on in as diversified a form as the vast variety of com munities which, like in the old days, continue to favour one deity over the other and are as unconcerned with the great philosophical structures moulded into more or less elegant systems propagated by the discourses of great gurus of the courts and of the intellectual élite.10 In the present note we are primarily concerned with these philosophical</page><page sequence="4">54 ARNOLD KUNST systems and their outlooks on creation along the patterns outlined above. Notwithstanding its adventurous and uneven vicissitudes, on the whole the doctrine of the Samkhya in both its ancient and classical forms was represent ing a well-balanced ontological system, in which the substantial elements of the machinery of creation remained quite steady for many centuries. The scope and purport of each of the evolutionary links in the system was occasionally open to changes but this is only too obvious for a variety of reasons, which cannot be discussed in detail here. The major reasons worthy of mention in this context are (1) the growth and the crystallization of the system engendered by strong extraneous influences, especially those arising from the simultaneous stabilization of the Vedântic and Buddhist thoughts; and eo ipso (2) the penetration of religious and soteriological concepts into a system, which seems to have its roots, similarly as the Vaisesika doctrine, in the urge to establish a positivist, down-to-earth, 'Naturgeschichte'. This urge was no doubt inspired by the powerful movement of the Càrvâkas, who either by their strong influence or by branching out into cognate systems have very likely been the forefathers or anyway, instigators, of the Samkhya and Vais'esika." It is noteworthy that the epithet of'svâbhâvika' has been used, among others, by the Vedantin for the denotation of both the Cârvâkas and the Sâmkhya.12 Since the time that the Sâmkhya has been analysed in detail by scholars like Garbe, Oltramare, Keith and others there has been a good deal of dis cussion as to whether or not the Samkhya was doctrinarily theistic or atheistic [due to the modern connotation of the term 'atheistic', it is now more appro priate to speak of a non-theistic attitude]. This whole discussion, as is the fate common to much of Indology, appears to show more concern for the opinion of the Western and Indian Indologist than for the subject of study. It equally shows more concern for the respectability of the definition of religion than for its substance and harks back to the time-honoured idea that nothing ex cluding the concept of God can be termed as religion. In fact, however, it is almost irrelevant whether or not the Samkhya philosophy did at some stage or another adopt God as the primo motore of creation.13 When it did and when the Patañjali Yoga introduced Is'vara for greater efficacy and 'utilitarianism' of the Samkhya system it is not unlikely that this was also an act of accommoda tion towards resolving the fundamental difficulty of reconciling the relation ship of the prakrti to the idea of purusa, a problem causing so much headache to Indian and Western philosophers and logicians. No investigation of the</page><page sequence="5">MAN - THE CREATOR 55 developmental stages of the concept and meaning of purusa, as we find it in SK, whether traced to the Purusasükta or the purusa as a psycho-physical person or as the Vedântin purusa = àtman has as yet brought about a plausible solution. Our present interest lies, however, with the idea of the purusa as the force behind creation and with the way in which it was grafted on the Sâmkhya theories. The significance of these theories must not be underestimated as, subject to due modifications, they have in time been adopted as a pattern by many of the Sâmkhyas' friends and foes. As is well known, even within the Sâmkhya system itself multiple modifications have been introduced under the influence of others, particularly the Vedânta, not to mention the Mahàbhârata (esp. Moksadharma), the Pañcaratra and the Bhâgavata-Purâna which, as Adalbert Gail14 has put it, became the 'Treuhânder' of the older Sâmkhya doctrines harmonizing the Sâmkhya and the Vedânta. Thus it seems that the rudimentary skeleton of the Sâmkhya psycho physical ontological system, a clear, elegant and self-sufficient scheme of creational processes could not survive as a purely mechanistic theory of creation without the subsequent addition of a monistic element. Conforming with the contemporary official thinking and with the religious dictates of the intellectuals and the 'theologians', it had to develop the way it did, the way the Vais'esika did and, while preserving its essential svabhâva-tenets, it had to embark on its soteriological teleology, still reluctant to admit God as creator. Theism, though popular, even vulgar perhaps for some tastes, continued to prevail as many contemporary cults show, and seemed to survive largely as a reaction against over-sophistication and over-intellectualization of once reformist thinkings in the same way as the established non-theistic soteriology was a reaction against the religions of the rank and file. This interplay between popular theism and non-theistic soteriology of the élite left a definite mark on the growth of both trends. The former was trying to emulate the 'philosophical' thinking by becoming ever more inclined towards the identification of divine creation with the absolute Brahma, while the advocates of the non-theistic trend held that the divine creative power was not necessary as a permanent feature of creation: in fact, god was more in conflict than in harmony with the idea of creation. The former trend can be traced, among others, in the development of speculations of the Vaisnavas, Saivas, Sâktas and partly in tàntrism, the latter mainly in those of the Sâmkhya, Vedânta and Buddhism. The position of Patañjali Yoga, in spite of the acceptance of ïsvara, remains ambiguous.</page><page sequence="6">56 ARNOLD KUNST The introduction of the purusarthatva into the mechanism of creation inherent in the prakrti changes completely the picture of creation behind the psycho-physical processes engendered by prakrti and its modifications as buddhi, ahamkâra, tanmâtras, manas-indriyas and bhutas. What was a tight system explaining the gradual sequence of originations as an end in itself, becomes now a means of religious aspirations. The student of evolution and causality turns into a mumuksu in quest of the truth lying beyond the burdens caused by creation and has to learn or intuitively to realize how to exploit the evolutionary hierarchy of world events to his own purposes. His social activities and his behaviour is no more dictated by the environment in which he participates; he must engage into activities by which, conscious of the invariable sequence of the phases of creation, he can manipulate them by correlating the flow of events and the laws governing them to his needs. The mumuksu does not have to be inventive. His dogma is laid down for him: he has been informed that empirical phenomena are per meated by suffering; that empirical reality {prakrti) is not to be mistaken through ignorance (avidya) for absolute reality (purusa); that fear, dying, and being born again to die again, are both the seed and the fruit of such ignorance; that he has in himself the spark (individual purusa) which, when freed from the contamination brought about by ignorance and wrong action, can lead him to the purpose of his quest. Briefly, he is made to realize that the sequence of cause and effect or, in other words, creation, is intrinsically ugly and oppressive and its destruction through the attainment of freedom from its bonds is meritorious and necessary. We have, in fact, in the Sâmkhya two modes of benign destruction: one is the laya and the other the moksa. The laya is of limited help to the moksa as, according to SK, it remains within the empirical sphere of creation; it is merely a temporary quiescence of guna activities. The moksa is the cessation of purusa's 'interest' in the operation of the prakrti and implies that creation is not necessary anymore.15 The structure of the Sâmkhya system with its pro vision for intricate interaction between the subjective and objective, and the intimate affinity and cooperation of the cognitive apparatus with the object, allows the individual purusa fully to subject the empirical phenomena to its own purpose and thus to realize the principle of purusarthatva. As something to be freed from, the world created is, as mentioned, of qualities not worthy of attachment or respect. Consequently there is little reason to invent an entity, much less so to revere and respect it, that has been the immediate cause</page><page sequence="7">MAN - THE CREATOR 57 of creation. The truth is that in the Sâmkhya the primordial cause of creation, of which purusa is no part, is not really explained: creation develops svabhâvena. Purusa's rôle and the reason for his adoration is not to sanctify creation but to offer it as the only possible platform, on which the ideal of human perfec tion through repudiation of ontological processes can be achieved. In this way creation becomes beneficial but only as the pathfinder helping man to escape beyond it thanks to the inspiration of a superior (purusa) who, of necessity, lies outside any empirical phenomena and is completely disengaged from creational activities. Buried under the weight of empirical phenomena lies the microcosmic purusa awaiting its release from the burden of creation. To apply a gross oversimplification the pattern of this type of duality is, mutatis mutandis, valid for the Vedânta, Buddhism, Jaina, and various forms of Visnuism and Sivaism: the soteriological spark lies in man, the obstacles and hindrances in creation, and the kinetisation of the spark generated by the realization of the dichotomy is enhanced by such variety of methods as each separate system has adopted within the framework of its dogmas. The Sâmkhya methodology seems to have integrated in its system so many helpful ontological elements that the adoption of the three gunas, the ahamkara, the süksmasarlras and the sthúlas'aslras (sometimes with varying nomenclatures) by other Indian schools has conditioned their methods of soteriological attainments. The versatile Yoga system as known from the Yogasütras has but reversed the processes of the Sâmkhya ontology and by their adaptation to the ex clusively psychological aspects has devised a way how to manipulate the intrinsic and extrinsic phenomena (the affinity of both through their common guna-structure has been established) to de-create creation and to con-struct the absolute by de-struction of the phenomenal. The gradually diminishing impact, through the astahga-yoga, of outer phenomena on the inner experience, leading to nirodha, amounts eventually to a situation when creation constitutes little more than a man-made stage for a series of soteriological exercises, manipulated by man in accordance with the deterministic laws governing the sequence of phenomena.16 The Yoga equivalent of purusa, the I s va ra, is not so much the god of creation, as man's ideal for whom his own creation, the bend ing of reality to his own aims, provides the causa cognoscendi, and, as it were, the Spinozian causa sui. As the astahga-yoga involves in its machinery the kaleidoscipe of all the phenomena of life, the social and the egotistic, action, participation, merit, demerit, emotion and speculation, and hatred and love, it</page><page sequence="8">58 ARNOLD KUNST acknowledges the full reality of all the world's scenery. It creates within the man-made framework of invariable laws and axioms and out of the corres ponding pre-fabricated material that primary reality which man believes to be the true reality resting at the bottom of the circus of empirical phenomena. The two realities stand side by side. Avidyâ ignores their differentiation, vidyâ or prajñá acknowledges their interdependence and realizes their otherness. The differentiation and the need for avidyâ is perpetuated until the vidya comes to fruition; with that no more creation occurs — it has worked itself out and would serve no further purpose.17 This Sârnkhya-Yoga gnostic approach is but a prelude to the further step of a more radical concept of man-made creation as it is represented by the advaita-Vedântins, and, allowing for certain differences, this applies equally to Gaudapâda, Sarikara, Mandana and SadSnanda, and to the Mahâyàna Buddhism at large, although it can be also traced to some movements in the Sthaviravâda Buddhism. As for the Vedânta school, for the purpose of the present paper, the Upanisads themselves may have to be frequently disregarded or treated only incidentally. It is now a well accepted fact that the Upanisadic texts served more as an excuse than a genuine source for the speculations of the Vedântists, among whom the emphasis on man as the springboard and focus of creation, is more pronounced and elaborate than in the Sâmkhya-Yoga system. The first basic question to be considered in the context of the advaita Vedânta is the distinctly discriminative treatment of Brahma, the demiurg, and Brahma residing in the body as the innermost personal âtman. In its purity of purpose Brahma (the nirgum) is free of any activity while Brahma or Isvara, the demiurg (the sagurn), serves a purpose similar to that of prakrti and is subservient to the nirguna Brahma as its artisan and messenger. The idea of âtman = brahman bears certain similarités to that of Zoipi'a, which, as des cribed by Irenaeus, represents, inter alia, the prototype of the human soul, whose pneumatic part became involved in matter.18 In the Vedânta the involvement of Brahman (and this goes also for purusa and ïs'vara) in matter, i.e. in creation of the empirical world, is on the whole of a reasonably discernible and clear-cut nature, though its complexities sometimes do escape definition not only on logical, but also on metaphysical grounds. One of the reasons of the vacillations is the lack of uniformity on the subject in the Upanisads themselves; the other is the undecisiveness of the individual exegetes. From the VedântasOtra, the notoriously obscure text,</page><page sequence="9">MAN-THE CREATOR 59 written in an exceedingly telegraphic style, nothing genuinely edifying can be learnt, and so Badarâyana's alleged intention can only be founded on the conjectural assumptions of the Sütra's organizer and commentator, Sañkara. A clear picture may also be gleaned from the GP, the VSâra and the Brahmasiddhi. The basic principles concerning the concept of creation as emerging from these texts may be summarized as follows: (1) Brahmajijñása (VS and VSB I.i) is the urge to know Brahman as the originator of all creation.19 This engenders the entrance upon the jñana-marga, which in turn results in the identification of Brahman with the âtman. (2) The intériorisation of the Brahman in the form of âtman untainted by any empirical phenomena, yet confronted with the latter, leads to the apprehen sion of two forms of Brahman, (a) one free from any contingencies (hence impredicable — pratisiddhasarvavisaya (VSB IV.3.14). (b) one qualified by plurality arising from nâmarûpa (VSB 1.1.2).20 (3) Brahma is not responsible for the good and the evil in the world. The responsibility lies with those who perform good karma and bad karma (punyo vai punyena karmanâ bhavati, pâpah pâpena, BÂU III.1,12 as cited in VSB II. 1.34). Here the stipulation is necessary that the empirical world is beginning less (ibid, 11.1,36) and as such, along with the human beings, is responsible for running its course, the parama Brahma being only indirectly involved in creation. (4) The indirect involvement is manifest through the equation of Brahman = mahâmâyâ. Such equation is possible due to and in spite of his sarvajñatva and sarvasaktitva. Much has been written about and speculated upon maya and little can be added to what has been said. Yet, perhaps one point has not been sufficiently brought out and that is the philosophical and religious fact that, because Brahman is identifiable with âtman and also with mâyâ, mâyâ is shared by both as a joint quality of Brahman and the âtman, and the plurality of the phenomenal world (creation and creativity) is equally attributable to both.21 Sankara's perplexity concerning the Upanisads' ambiguity as to when the para-and when the apara-Brahman is exactly meant is, from his viewpoint completely justified.22 While creation, according to VSB II. 1.3, has the appear ance of something important (gurutara) it is nevertheless the demiurg's (here paramesvara's) diversion (Jila). But, Sarikara continues, it is not really creation (na ceyam paramanhavisaya srstih); it applies to the empirical world only and</page><page sequence="10">60 ARNOLD KUNST takes place but in the sphere of mental construction born of mistaken identity of the real with the non-real (avidyakalpita.. . vyavahâragocaratvât). On this point there might arise some difficulty in the reconciliation of Gaudapâda's and Sankara's views on creation (the latter being less consistent than the former). Under the strong influence of the Mâdhyamika and the Yogâcâra, creation, i.e. becoming and un-becoming, is treated by Gaudapâda with benevolent contempt and conceded as necessary for soteriological pur poses only, even though it is merely a product of mâyâ = avidyà shared by god and man. This standpoint is easier for Gaudapâda to adopt, since along with the Buddhists he has, in fact, largely ignored the mythological lore as part of the avidyâ and has laid the full burden of creation upon the shoulders of man's ignorance and the working of his personality. Sankara's verdict on creation as the figment of mind and as the result of avidyâ is somewhat difficult to reconcile with his adulation of the creating Brahmâ, to whom avidyâ does not apply. The single reference (as far as I could ascertain) to Brahman manifesting himself as avidyâ (VSB 1.3.19)23 is too casual to be taken as more than a perfunctory 'apology' destined to justify Brahman's all-pervasiveness. The fascinating thing about the concept of the empirical world as the result of man-made creation, an occupation for which the human being can rely only on the cooperation of (as and if necessary) the lower stratum of the man-made pantheon, is that it operates according to strict rules of laws to which, possibly against the rules of logic, all the phenomena are subjected. Though projected by the mâyâ (= ajññna or avidyâ = mistaken identification of true reality for empirical reality) and superimposed on the âtman= Brahman, it follows strictly a sequence of processes, far from any chaos or incoherence, of which a mind-produced artifact could or even should rightly be assumed to be produced. Yet, as E. Conze has put it in relation to Buddhism (though this is largely valid for the advaita-Vedânta), this very aplana is the starting point of the chasm of causation, and in part a self-deception which, misdirecting our attention towards a manufactured world of our own making conceals the true reality to which wisdom alone can penetrate.24 As such orderliness defying all logic and experience (even if India's philos ophers may not have been acute observers of empirical facts, they were superb logicians) has been attributed to creation, it must have had as its support some thing else to back it up. For the absence of God it was the prajñá, the wisdom underlying all the mystery, around which human creativity, for better and for</page><page sequence="11">MAN - THE CREATOR 61 worse, was staging the pedantic mise en scène. Like a benevolent angel with both arms widely stretched and the tips of the fingers of one hand reaching into the manas of man in his earthly surroundings, and of the other held on to the 'body' of Brahman, prajfiá belongs to both worlds and divides and unites them. The vicious circle of the unreal mind projecting unreal images which, in turn, are impressed through the mind {manas) on the àtman and contaminate its immanent purity is, indeed, difficult to resolve by any rational means. But as in any system, ratiocination becomes free of difficulty, if it is reconciled to the primary axiom underlying the system. With the acceptance of this axiom the rest flows smoothly. An illogical axiom i.e an axiom which was laid down on the basis of intuitive knowledge and with no help of tangible evidence can easily serve as a proposition leading to a logical and rational flow of secondary propositions. In accepting the axiomatic tenets allegedly revealed by the sruti (in this context it is always the Upanisads) the VSâra has thus reconstructed or rather epitomised a system in which all the physio-psychological phenomena leading to the moksa are lined up in a neat formation. As a result of the acceptance of the traditional sequence of elements of creation from lighter to heavier sub stances, i.e. from psychological and mental to gross and concrete (some may call it — though less accurately — from conceptual to material), man has established himself as the centre of the universe, and divided his creativity in two fundamental activities: (1) tht adhyaropa and (2) the apavâda 15 The adhyaropa is the gradual envelopment of the àtman = Brahman, i.e. the created reality, in a web of empirical phenomena, while the apavada is the reversal of the process intended to disentangle the àtman from the net of involvements brought about by the adhyaropa. These two creative operations, enhanced by the increasing and decreasing ajmna, encompass everything that the empirical world contains and are responsible for all that this world encumbers, be it the oceans and the earth, the I and the non-I, the mind and the senses, pleasure and pain, the karma involving action, speaking and thinking, the samsara of being born and dying. The wonder of it all is that the entire apparatus of the man-made creation is flawlessly orderly and is steered in accordance with all the logistics of a well planned strategy. It retains all the appearance of concrete reality both in its microcosmic and cosmic aspect. Within the sphere of adhyaropa aided by the trigumtmakam ajñanam in its phases of the visva, taijasa and prajññ, prajm is,</page><page sequence="12">62 ARNOLD KUNST as has been mentioned before, still involved in the empirical orbit of creation. Ignorance is bliss in so far as it embraces wisdom, which is still within its orbit and which sets off the spark towards attainment of the turlya, the complete perfection consisting of the abolition of the discrimination between subject and object. The machinery of man's avidya engendering the adhyâropa, i.e. creation, consists, as has been mentioned, of the well coordinated sequence of realistic processes, which the viksepa, the mental ability to expand phenomena in accordance with the laws of causation, produces. The psychological and mental substance (tammâtra leading to süksmasañra) gives rise to the expansion of the corresponding material elements of existence (bhütaprapañca) and to the complex epistemological apparatus providing facilities for all shades of intellectual and emotional experience. What Patañjali-Yoga does for the Samkhya ontological process by reversing the creation and forcing it to disintegrate purusârthatattvena, the process of a pavada does for the advaita-Vedantin. Here also man by his own effort and sparked off by the prajña disintegrates step by step his own adhyâropa creation, until, in the same orderly manner the gross recedes into the subtle, the subtle is absorbed into the prajña = îsvara, and eventually the âtman slips back into where it genetically belongs, the Brahma. While the Sâmkhya-Yoga devotee has to manipulate an objective reality, which, though not of his doing, is under his ever increasing control, the advaitin has produced it all by himself, and has been responsible for the entire man-made complexity of phenomena. To those to whom God is the maker and creator, a man-made creation, acquitting God of his creatures' good and bad experiences and actions, may be heresy and offence. Yet, in the history of most religions doubts as to the compatibility of God with the creation of Evil have vexed humanity at all times and in all phases of religious development. As I have had the opportunity of remarking somewhere else, it was gnosticism that was the rule and ortho doxy rather than exception and heresy in post-Vedic thinking in India, while it was exception and heresy rather than rule and orthodoxy in Christian religions. The egocentricism of man was, no doubt, responsible for the emphasis on his soteriological aspirations, and on the setting of his moral and ethical code. The question was, how far this code included or excluded man's participation in society and how much stress it laid on solipsistic criteria as yardsticks of man's advancement as a member of a nation. An analysis of the concepts of creation and their impact on the well-being and advancement of society within</page><page sequence="13">MAN - THE CREATOR 63 the framework of man's insistence on 'spiritual' salvation rather than on secular aspects of development is too far-reaching to be even touched upon here. In ancient India, the transitional period from Vedic ritualism to soteriological speculations was generally marked by total or partial rejection of God's inter ference in man's quest for spiritual attainment. Buddha's reformist activities, possibly the most powerful rebellion against Vedic theocracy and in its original form a combination of social and religious revolution, had in time to surrender many of the social aspects of its reform and concentrate on meta physical and soteriological speculations and assertions to meet the propensities of the philosophically-minded élite. The various types of reform directed against Vedic ritualism, however diverse in their origin and their respective careers, shared at least one common feature. The Samkhya denied God because he denied the necessity or possib ility of God's participation in creation along with all its wrongs, and acquiesced at the inescapable and natural creative power, and the orderliness and purpose fulness of the prakrti which could be adapted to man's needs. The Vedántin — because he recognized man as the only possible spiritus movens who, in collusion with the demiurg, could bring his inherent perfection to fruition by means of the mechanics of the world he created himself; the Buddhist — because, in addition to his fundamental désintéressment in creation, he was depending on his own power and ability to create his escape from the falsehood of empirical reality. It sounds all so very pragmatic; but the pragmatism is of a type difficult to translate into social values. Modern India has tried to undo the social damage brought about by all this overspiritualization. It has tried to reintroduce God as the creator in order to unburden man of his cosmic responsibility and turn his attention to India as a society rather than a polymorphous church. The attempt, though formidable, is by no means uniform or unison. Non-theism has largely shifted to either agnosticism or to theism manifested by a host of a complex variety of cults difficult of classification; but the religious fervour of the majority of Indian populace still awaits a signpost showing man how rationally to translate religion into constructive precepts for social advancement. NOTES 1 Despite the various speculations as to who should be ultimately declared as the creator in the Rgvedic tradition, the final verdict, if any is possible, still encounters a number of difficulties. Among them is the fact that in many instances creation was presented as an</page><page sequence="14">64 ARNOLD KUNST act of cooperation of two or more gods; that the superiority of some gods over others was being 'henotheistically' attributed to deities currently addressed, rendering a number of individual gods not easily distinguishable from others, except by name. 2 Although active some five centuries after Nàgàrjuna, Gaudapàda seems to pursue in his Kàrikàs many of the Màdhyamika ideas not only in spirit but also in language. Even in the MU itself (verse 7) the expressions prapañcopasamam sivam would appear to be a loan from MK 1.1 and XXV, 24. In MK they are the epitheta of the pratïtyasamutpâda, while in MU they qualify the tuñya =âtman. S. Dasgupta (in his History of Indian Philosophy, vol. I, p. 425n.) believes that the Buddhists were the first to use this phrase. This observa tion, essentially correct, is even of greater interest than meets the eye as Dasgupta mistakenly attributes the phrase exclusively to Gaudapàda though the loan must have occurred earlier. These two expressions occur also together and separately both in MK, the Prasannapadà (cf. de la Vallée Poussin's edition, 18.9), and other commentaries (cf. D. S. Ruegg's La théorie du Tathàgata et du Gotra, passim) and are used by Gaudapàda (1.28 and 11.33). In GP other passages (IV.8, 20 and 22) identical with or close to those of MK IV, 8-9 and 1.1 respectively (cf. Walleser's Màdhyamikasàstra nach der tibetischen Version, de la Vallée Poussin's edition, and the translation and edition of MU and GK by Em. Lesimple). The rendition of the passages into Sanskrit by H. N. Chatterjee seems to be wide of the mark. 3 kimkâranam brahma or, as in some editions, kim kâranam brahma, can be understood in at least four ways (Deussen: was is Urgrund, was Brahman?; Hauschild: Woher stammt das Brahman?; Radhakrishnan and Tyàgïsànanda: What is the cause? (Is it) Brahman?; Max Miiller: Is Brahma the cause?). The two latter interpretations tally with that of the Sanskrit commentator who combines closely verse 1 with verse 2. This is, however, doubtful as the first verse would rather seem to wonder about the miracle of creation and life (kutah sma jatâh1\kena jîvàmah?-, kva sampratisrhâhT; kena vartàmahel) and, not unlike Rgveda X.129, is more of a ¡pi\ooo&lt;pmov davtiàÇew than a precisely formulated enquiry while SU 1.2 contains the rejection of some theories in favour of the doctrine propounded in the Upanisad's subsequent verses. 4 Rather so than 'consisting of 25, 26, 31 or an infinite number of parts' as suggested by Lesimple. Cf. GK 11.26 and Cùlikà Upanisad 14. By the inclusion of lattvani in the list the problem of the 'parts' has already been taken care of. s This is the second time that lokâs are mentioned. Apparently one is the I oka of the Lokàyatas and the other the spheres of the three worlds. 6 Actually the text mentions strïpumnapumsaka, i.e. the three genders. 7 There exist lists of theories of creation in other texts. Some are more systematically formulated than others. Cf. for instance Brhatsamhità 1.7, Mahábodhi-Játaka, Buddhacarita, Cùlikà Upanisad a.o. They are usually cited in an apologctic or derisory manner in order to strengthen the theses propagated by the authors concerned. (Cf. also B. Barua, A history of pre-Buddhistic Indian philosophy, pp. 196ff.) " Cf. for instance Sadánanda's references to various phrases in the Upanisads which, he claims, were likely to serve as starting points of some of non-Vedàntic and heretical doctrines. So the atiprâkrtâs are alleged to have used the passage in the Kausltaki Upanisad II. 11 (àt ma vai jay ate putrah - v. also SB XIV.9,4,26) to form their atiprakrti theory. [Incidentally the expression atiprâkrta does not seem to occur anywhere else; it is probably a name for a radical svàbhàvika, though not perhaps a Càrvàka as in the same paragraph the VSâra refers to the Cârvàkas explicitly. To judge by the context the ex pression is more likely to apply to a Vedic fundamentalist. In the Subodhim an atipràkrta</page><page sequence="15">MAN - THE CREATOR 65 is explained as one of atisthülabuddhi-, in Râmatîrtha's tïkâ as atimïidhamati.] The Cârvâka, says VSàra, could have found the source of his materialistic outlook, based on the sense-relation to the world, in the Taitt.Upanisad 11.2-3 and 12 and ChU V. 1,7 (àtmà prâna°, manomaya etc.); the sources for the vijnànavâdin and the sûnyavâdin respectively are said to have been Taitt.Upanisad 11.4 and ChU VI.2,1 (T: alma vijñána mayah ; ChU : asad evedam agra âsit). The Pûrvamfmâmsakas seem to have drawn on MU 1.5 and Taitt.Upanisad 1.2,5 (.. . ànandamaya). On completion of these clumsy quotations and paradoxical assumptions Sadànanda comes up with an almost unprecedented assertion that passages in the Upanisads helpful to the opponents are recompensed by passages at variance with their views and carry great weight (prabala). To prove his points he cites a host of epitheta of the àtman from BAU, KU, SU, the Mundaka, Maitrf, ChU etc. and these are alleged to serve as the genuine authority reaffirming the advaita position of the Vedànta. * Cf. Renou's The destiny of the Veda in India (ed. by D. R. Chanana), pp. 19, 40-41: "The Vedic attachment [of the first Upanisads, their] adherence to a determinate school hardly goes beyond honorary mention a few times; the allusion to the Veda, the citations of the mantra, become far more rare." "Since then [sell. Madhva's theistic interpretation of the Vedânta] the Veda has had no more than one meaning, namely to indicate the ultimate aim of all activity, as of all knowledge, that is to say, God." "As for their [the Vedas'] hymns, their notion is totally obliterated. Mïmâmsâ manoeuvres with the fragments, with the Vedic dust." ,0 Many of the philosophical exegetic as well as literary works in verse, prose and dramatic form testify to this adherence. The literary aspect has been pointed out by Prof. Aalto in his (yet unpublished) paper on the development of Indian religions as reflected by non-religious literature. 11 It is characteristic to note that much of the Cârvàkas and the pre-Is'varakrsna Samkhya philosophy, and this goes partly for the Vaisesikas, is known to us from second-hand sources, while authors, no doubt all of them historical personages, like Kapila, Pañcasikha, Varsaganya and others have receded into virtual oblivion as authors and were revered as sages for merits contrary to those which they would have been likely or willing to claim. It is not too bold to assume that their works, heretical as they may have appeared to the then prevailing 'theology', were either destroyed, heavily censored or suitably tailored (cf. the Vaisesikasûtra) to the contemporary demands. " For interesting comments on this subject cf. E. H. Johnston, Early Samkhya, pp. 67ff. 13 A strong defence for theism in pre-Is'varakrsna Samkhya was put up by K. B. Rama krishna Rao in 1966. Most of his argumentation, however, is not easily acceptable. Professor Rao draws generously from S. Dasgupta's History of Philosophy. But his quotations of Dasgupta's statement from p. 220 of the 1 st volume are misleading. Dasgupta's admission that Kapila's doctrine was probably theistic is coached in careful words and placed in a context expressing doubts on the fidelity of the rendition of the Sastitantra by the Ahirbudhnya Samhitâ. Dasgupta, it is true, equally speculates on the possibility that Pañcasikha modified Kapila's work in an 'atheistic way', and draws further conclusions on the various strata of the Samkhya doctrine. He offers, however, a much more peremptory view when he says (on p. 259 of vol. I), that.. . the Yoga and Samkhya are distinguished as Sesvara Sámkhya and Nirisvara Samkhya. As the term Sesvara Samkhya is being referred to by various Sanskrit authors (e.g. Vijñánabhiksu, Sântaraksita a.o.) there must have been Samkhya groups including Tsvara in their system other than in combination with Yoga. The references to Tsvara in the Svetasvatara</page><page sequence="16">66 ARNOLD KUNST Upanisad show, however, unmistakably the Yoga influence with the reservation that Tsvara is more closely identified with Rudra whereas quotations from Ahirbudhnya indicate Vaisnava inclinations. 14 Cf. Adalbert Gail, Bhakti im Bhâgavatapurâna, Wiesbaden, 1969, pp. 25f. 15 This tclescoped description of the laya and moksa does not take into account the variety of phases of the interpretation of the relationship between the prakrti and the purusa though it may be found generally applicable. The variety of these interpretations and what they involved is too complex to be analysed here. 16 This is perhaps not a far cry from the efficacy of tapas as encountered in SB and Jaiminîya-Bràhmana, where the rsi endowed with the power of austerity shares the creative urge with gods. Cf. Prof. Gonda's description of such power in his Religionen Indiens I, p. 185: "Tapas ist. . . eine gewaltige Macht die der 'Asket' in sich und fiir sich hervorbringt. Er fiihlt sich selbst als aus dem irdischen Dasein herausgehoben und dazu fahig, die angehàufte Kraft in beliebiger Richtung zu entladen ... und die hôchsten Geheimnissc zu erkennen." 17 Cf. SK 65 and 66: ... arthavasàt. . . prakrtim pasyati purusah preksakavad avasthitah svacchah. drstâ maye'ty upeksaka eko [= purusah ], drstfiham ity uparamaty anyâ [= prakrtih];sati samyoge 'pi tayoh prayojanam nâsti sargasya. 18 Cf. J. Zandee, Die Person der Sophia in der vierten Schrift des Codex Jung. Le Origini dello Gnosticismo, p. 203. Far be it from me to discuss the vicissitudes of the term Zoipia, which, as has been pointed out by R. Mc. L. Wilson, Gnosis, Gnosticism and the New Testament, ibid, p. 520, has presented special difficulties in its application to various theological and gnostic contexts. " VS 1.1,2: janrnàdyasya yatah. Cf. also Sankara's reference in this context to the Taittirîya Upanisad III. 1. It is not always crystal-clear, particularly in compounds, whether a text refers to Brahmá or Brahma, the theistic demiurg or the cosmic principle. Sankara's Bhàsya on this point in J. 1.1 and 1.1.2 is ambiguous, but generally the meaning of the term becomes the one he chooses to ascribe to it. 20 References purporting to support this division may be found in the ChU VII, 24.1,i, BÂU IV,5.15, Taitt.Âr. 111,12.7, and many others. Cf. also the discussion in VSB IV,2.7: ity atra vicikitsyate: kirn kâryam aparam brahma gamayaty âhosvit param evavikrtam mukhyam brahmeti. 21 Cf. GK 11.12: kalpayaty àtmanàtmànam âtmà devah svamâyaya; and GK 11.19: mâyaisâ tasya devasya yayâ sammohitah svayam; also GK 111,24 attributes to Indra his 'multiple' existence as one brought about by (his own) màyà. It is worth noting how this latter passage based on the quotation from BÂU 11,5.19 twists the meaning of mâyâ intended in that Upanisad. 22 Cf. note 19 above. Incidentally, in his commentary of the BhG 8,25, Sankara distin guishes between the pitryàna as a way leading through the moon and back to earth, and the devayàna leading to the highest Brahman, while in his remark on VS IV,3,7-14 the devayana is confined to the journey to the lower Brahman. 23 paramesvarah. .. avidyayâ màyayâ màyâvivad anekadhâ vibhâvyate. 24 Buddhism and Gnosis, Le Origini dello Gnosticismo, p. 653. 25 The participle adhyàropita is frequently used by Sankara in the VSB;adhyaropa and apavàda in VSára roughly correspond to what is indicated by Gaudapâda as vaitathya and advaita, to both of which as a corollary the idea of alâtasânti can be added. Gaudapâda's method of presentation of his concept of creation differs from that of Sadananda; it is more subtle and much more intimately related to the ideas expounded by the s'unyavâdins.</page><page sequence="17">MAN - THE CREATOR 67 BIBLIOGRAPHY Barua, B.
