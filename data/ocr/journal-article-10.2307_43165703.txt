Is it possible to teach reading during the part of your daily schedule devoted to science and to teach science outside of its delegated time slot? We think the answer to all of these questions is yes. In this, our second article on science and reading/ we offer guidelines for select- ing nonfiction books on scientific sub- jects and suggestions for incorporating these books into a curriculum. First, however, a look at what you can hope to accomplish by using science trade books in the classroom. Why Use Science Trades? The objectives identified below are basic and encompassing - they might stand as a summary of what elemen- tary education as a whole should aim at achieving. But they are also specific to science trade books. Well-chosen and intelligently used, these books can assist in (1) giving children knowledge about the world; (2) helping them experience the excitement of discovery; (3) intro- ducing them to the scientific method and helping them to appreciate the atti- tudes of people who employ this meth- od; (4) stimulating them to explore on their own; (5) encouraging them to develop critical reading and thinking abilities; and (6) stretching their minds, enlarging their vocabularies, and stimu- lating their imaginations. (1)** Choosing the Best How can a teacher faced with the enormous number of attractive books on science choose wisely? We have found helpful both the guidelines sug- gested by the American Association for the Advancement of Science (2) and those suggested jointly by NSTA and the Children's Book Council.*** The fol- lowing list combines recommendations from the two groups. All facts should be accurate. This means more than simply supplying reliable information. Ask the following ques- tions when evaluating the accuracy of information: 1. Does the author have the scien- tific qualifications to write a book on this subject? 2. Are significant facts omitted? 3. Are facts and theories distin- guished? Authors should say whether a statement is a fact or a theory formu- lated to explain a particular set of facts. 4. Are differing views presented on controversial subjects? Ecological sub- jects, for instance, frequently have pro- ponents on both sides of an issue. 5. Is the information as up-to-date as possible? In the many areas where knowledge is rapidly changing, pay close attention to copyright dates. 6. Is information presented without relying on anthropomorphism? There is no consensus that all anthropomor- phism should be avoided in children's literature, but science educators gener- ally agree that nonfiction science books should not attribute human thoughts, motives, or emotions to animals and plants. Stereotypes should not be used. Contempo- rary books probably will not be guilty of the blatant biases common in the past. However, they may suggest ste- reotypes through inclusion or exclusion of certain groups in certain professions or fields. illustrations should be accurate. Do the il- lustrations clarify the text? Drawings and photographs should have captions, and legends keyed directly to the text. Texts should encourage analytical thinking. Are children challenged to solve prob- lems? Are they encouraged to observe, gather data, experiment, compare, and formulate hypotheses? Are they encour- aged, also, to withhold judgment until enough data have been gathered or rel- evant facts explored? Good books will often lead children to experiment fur- ther and will stress the value of addi- tional reading. *See S&amp;C, January 1983, for the first. **See References. ***See the following article in this issue for the 1982 list of Outstanding Trade Books for Children.

Good books frequently progress from the simple to the complex, from the familiar to the unfamiliar, from early to later stages of development. Are organ- izational aids included to assist children when they are looking for information? A table of contents, glossary, index, and appendixes are all helpful in this respect. The writing style should be lively and clear. The style should be appropriate for the intended age group, as should the vo- cabulary and general complexity of treatment. Skillful writers often appeal to children's senses with vivid descrip- tions or clarify ideas through compari- son and analogy. Designing Activities Once you have decided what topics and concepts you wish to teach and have identified books that are appro- priate, you can begin to design appro- priate activities. We suggest that you devise the activities for use by individ- ual students because it is easier to scale up an activity than to modify one de- signed for a whole class so it can be used by smaller groups. To give you an idea of some ways in which books can be incorporated into classroom study, we have identified objectives and designed activities based on Th√© Amazing Dandelion by Millicent E. Selsam and Jerome Wexler, a 1977 Out- standing Science Trade Book for Chil- dren that is appropriate for use in the third-grade curriculum. The text of The Amazing Dandelion , which examines this common plant and explores possible reasons for its success, lends itself well to several teaching ob- jectives. The book relates plant struc- tures to their functions; it discusses plant life cycles, thus linking plants to other living things; and it discusses the several ways in which plants reproduce. In addition to presenting these con- cepts, The Amazing Dandelion gives chil- dren experience with some important processes: observing, classifying, mea- suring, and communicating. And finally, it helps in achieving affective goals such as arousing curiosity, inspiring respect for living things, and developing aes- thetic awareness. We have come up with 18 activities based on this book. Try them with your students and make up similar ones for use with other books. 1. The first one is obvious: read the book to your students or have them read it. 2. Gather lots of dandelion seeds. Place 20 seeds apiece inside a number of moist paper towels, and put the tow- March 1983 Science and Children 47</page><page sequence="3">The possibilities of using a good book to awaken scientific curiosity are practically limitless. els in a warm, dark place, being sure to keep them damp. After two or three days, have students count how many seeds in each sample have germinated. You might want to have them diagram the results on a bar graph. 3. Plant 3 seeds in each of 50 differ- ent containers; use milk cartons or sim- ilarly inexpensive materials. Fill the con- tainers with commercial potting soil or garden soil that has been sterilized to eliminate harmful bacteria or unwanted plant material. After the dandelions sprout, thin them to one per container. Twice a week, say Tuesdays and Fri- days, have students carefully remove the soil from one plant. They can ob- serve, measure, and record changes in root development, leaf proliferation, and other stages of growth such as overall height and the appearance of flowers. 4. Use a hand lens or dissecting mi- croscope to locate the parts of the plant identified in the book. 5. Make a flower arrangement using dandelions and other wild plants. (Stu- dents may want to present it to a class- mate who is ill or to some other house- bound person.) 6. Prepare and eat a salad containing dandelions. (There are probably other wild, edible plants, like purslane, grow- ing in your neighborhood. Check your library for reliable resources or locate a knowledgeable horticulturist.) 7. Compare and contrast several other plants with the dandelion. What do their flowers look like? Their leaves? Their seeds? 8. After discussing the process of seed reproduction, identify and, if pos- sible, grow some plants that reproduce by other means. 9. Grow a different kind of flower- ing plant from seed. How does the growth rate compare with that of the dandelion? How do the plant parts compare with the dandelion's? 10. Plant a garden of seeds obtained from weeds. Are the plants attractive? What insects visit which plants? 11. Plant some milkweed seeds. Mon- arch butterflies are often attracted to milkweed. What flying insects are at- tracted to dandelions? 12. Pretend you are a dandelion seed. Write or tell a story about how and where you travel. Describe where you started to grow into a plant and how you developed. 13. Develop a word search game using the terms found in The Amazing Dandelion . 14. Ask accelerated students (or oth- ers, with your assistance) to determine how long it takes a dandelion to com- plete its life cycle. Have them count or estimate the number of plants that could be produced from that initial seed in one year if all the seeds germinated and grew. 15. Pretend you are an ant and de- scribe a dandelion plant from that per- spective. How might the plant be use- ful to you? 16. Investigate where dandelions most often grow. Describe these loca- tions, as well as places where they are seldom found. What conclusions can you draw from this? 17. Will dandelions grow in the class- room in winter or only during the times when they also grow outdoors? Inves- tigate this. 18. Dandelions are often looked down upon as troublesome weeds. Write a paper in defense of the dande- lion. As you can see, the instructional pos- sibilities of using a good book to awaken scientific curiosity and increase scienti- fic skills and knowledge are practically limitless. Good science and good litera- ture can be strong partners and valuable allies to imaginative, energetic teachers. References 1. Norton, Donna E.
