<plain_text><page sequence="1">CONCEPTUAL IDEALISM REVISITED NICHOLAS RESCHER i^ome twenty years AGO I wrote a small book entitled Conceptual Idealism, which ultimately saw the light of print in 1973.1 In the wake of its appearance, a considerable number of reviews were pub lished in the philosophical literature, and their perusal, as well as discussions with various colleagues, brought home to me how easy it is to misunderstand and misconstrue a position which, to its ex ponent, seems quite clear and straightforward. In due course, I have come to think it useful to exploit the benefit of distant hindsight to try to restate the position more clearly and to try to safeguard it against various misunderstandings that have come to view. The present essay is the result of this endeavor. Idealism, broadly speaking, is the doctrine that reality is some how mind-correlative or mind-coordinated. However, the specifi cally conceptual idealism which concerns us here stands in contrast to an ontological doctrine to the effect that mind somehow constitutes or produces the world's matter. Instead, it maintains that an ad equate descriptive characterization of physical ("material") reality must make implicit reference to mental operations?that some commerce with mental characteristics and operations is involved in explanatory exposition of what is at issue "the real world." The central thesis of this position is that the mind is responsible for nature-as-we-understand-it, through making not nature itself, to be sure, but rather the mode-and-manner determining categories in whose terms we conceive of it. On its approach, the constitutive role of mind is accordingly to be thought of neither in ontological nor in causal terms, but hermeneutically by way of concept-expli cation. 1 Conceptual Idealism (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1973).

Rather, it is conceptualization: the ability to consider things in the light of self-provided conceptions. This ability to traffic in ideas is a capacity of minds alone. It is a talent the mind puts to work throughout the sphere of information processing. Seeing, for ex ample, is always seeing-that: we never experience seeing something without seeing what is at issue as such-and-such and so seeing that it is such-and-such. Symbolism is one key paradigm: not only sym bols per se (A, a, and the like) but everything that we apprehend is grasped by us in terms of meaningful conceptions?and meaning is, of course, the fundamental category of mind. However, what is noteworthy is that the concepts in terms of which the mind processes its information about the real standardly include some element of reflexivity?some admixture of ideas based on the mind's view of its own role in the scheme of things. Against this background, conceptual idealism's central thesis is that certain key properties ascribed to physical things in our standard conceptual scheme are fundamentally relational properties, with some facet of "the mind" (or of minds-in-general) as one term of this relation. Specifically, it holds that the conceptual scheme we standardly use to construe our experience ascribes to "material" objects properties and characteristics that involve some reference to mental operations within the very meaning of the terms at issue. Even the physical properties of things are yet mind-involving in the analytic sense that their explicative conceptual unpacking calls for a reference to minds and their capabilities. Conceptual idealism demands attention to the important dis tinction between conceptual mind-involvingness and explicit mind invokingness, illustrated in the contrast between a book and a dream. To characterize an object of consideration as a dream or a worry is explicitly mind-invoking. For dreams and worries exist only where there is dreaming and worrying, which, by their very nature, are the sorts of things that belong among the thought-processes of mind endowed creatures: where there are dreams or worries, there must be mind-equipped beings to do the dreaming and worrying. A book, by contrast, seems at first sight entirely nonmental: books, after all, unlike dreams or worries, are physical objects. If</page><page sequence="3">CONCEPTUAL IDEALISM REVISITED 497 mind-endowed beings were to vanish from the world, dreams and worries would vanish with them?but not books! Even if there were no mind-endowed beings, there could certainly be naturally evolved book-like objects, objects physically indistinguishable from books as we know them. Nevertheless there could not be books in a world where minds had never been in existence. For a book is, by defi nition, an artifact of a certain purposive (that is, communicative) sort equipped with pages on which "reading material" is printed. Such purposive artifacts all invoke goal-directed processes of a type that can exist only where there are minds. To be a book is to have writing in it, and not just marks. And writing is inherently the sort of thing produced and employed by mind-endowed beings. To explain adequately what a book is we must thus make reference to writing and ultimately to minds. The point is not that the book is mentalesque as a physical object, but rather that to explicate what is involved in characterizing that object as a book we must eventually refer to minds and their capabilities. A world in which there are not nor ever have been minds can contain objects physically indis tinguishable from our books and nails, but books and nails they could not be, seeing that only artifacts created for a certain sort of purpose can currently be so characterized. And so, while physical objects are (of course) not mind-depen dent as such, their conceptualization or characterization can nev ertheless be?and, as is here maintained, standardly is?cast in mind-involving terms of reference. This conception of the mind involving (as contrasted with the mind-invoking) will be central in these deliberations. The overall message of conceptual idealism is, accordingly, that we standardly think of reality in mentalesque terms. It rests on two basic theses: (1) that our world is?inevitably?the world as we conceive it to be, and (2) that the concepts (thought-instrumentalities) that we standardly use in describing the world contain in their makeup, at some point, a reference to the operations of mind. Observing that our "standard conception" of the world we live in is that of a multitude of particulars, endowed with empirical properties and positioned in space and time and interacting causally, conceptual</page><page sequence="4">498 NICHOLAS RESCHER idealism goes on to maintain that all of the salient conceptions op erative here?particularity, spatiotemporality, causality, and the possession of empirical properties?are mind-involving in exactly the sense explicated above. It is axiomatic that reality, insofar as apprehended by intelli gence at all, can be apprehended only through the mediate employ ment of conceptual mechanisms of representation. As conceptual idealism sees it, these mechanisms as we have them here and now are inherently mind-referring. It holds that the conceptual instru mentalities we use for the characterization of "the real world" are committed in their ideational content to an involvement with actions and accomplishments that minds also can realize. Its pivotal con tention is that our world-model, the world as we depict it in thought and cognition, is a mental artifact that is constructed (in part) in mind-referential terms?that the nature of the world as we conceive it reflects the nature of mind. For the salient thesis of conceptual idealism is that we must recognize as mind-involving all of the stan dard elements of our usual coordinating world-picture, namely: ?particularity/individual identity ?causality and process ?property possession ?space-time emplacement. It is sometimes said that idealism is predicated on a confusion of objects with our knowledge of them and conflates the real with our thought about it. But this charge misses the point. The only reality with which we inquirers can have any cognitive commerce is reality as we conceive it to be; our only informational access to reality is through the mediation of our mind-devised representations of it, and we achieve this devising by means that are not only mind supplied but also mind-patterned. Conceptual idealism's thesis is not the trivial one that mind makes the idea of nature. It is not open to Santayana's complaint against Schopenhauer that "he proclaimed that the world was his idea, but meant only (what is undeniable) that his idea of the world was his idea." Rather, what is at issue is that mind-patterned con ceptions are built into our idea of nature, that the way we standardly conceive of nature is in some crucial respects patterned on our mind.</page><page sequence="5">CONCEPTUAL IDEALISM REVISITED 499 Of course, in speaking of mind-involvement or mind-invocation, no reference to any particular mind is at issue. The mental aspect operative here is not private or personal: it is not a question of whose mind, of this or that mind rather than another. The dependence at issue is wholly generic and systematic in nature. Again, the mind-relatedness in view is not something volun taristic, something over which persons have power and which can be changed around by their thinking ("wishful" or otherwise). To say something (for instance, a color) is mind-involving2 is not to say that it is illusory or delusory or otherwise "unreal"; it is not to say that it is psychological in any subjective, person-relative sense; it is certainly not to say that it is arbitrary, choice-related, or change able by human discretion. The idealist view of reality is not a do it-yourself position that lets us shape the world in any way we please. Historically, idealists have never made reality a matter of wishful thinking that lets thought shape the world without objective con straints. Constraints have always been recognized: God (by Berke ley), the faculty-structure of the mind (by Kant), biological and per haps ultimately Darwinian considerations (by Bergson). Conceptual idealism correspondingly acknowledges the restrictive role of an objectively given conceptual scheme. Thus the items we charac terize as "mind-dependent" can be perfectly interpersonal and ob jective; they need not be subjective at all?let alone be something over which people have voluntary control. This conceptual idealism sees mind not as causal source of the materials of nature, but as furnishing some of the interpretative mechanisms in terms of which we understand them. It maintains that we come to cognitive grips with nature on our own terms?that is, in terms of concepts whose makeup involves some reference to minds and their operations. Conceptual idealism is predicated on the view that reality as we standardly conceive it?in terms of ma terial objects characterized by empirical properties and relations with one another in a setting of space and time?is actually in some respect involved in making reference to the operations of mind. As this sort of idealism has it, the mind understands nature in a manner 2 Phenomenal colors are mind-involving in that they have to do with the looks of things, and only mind-equipped beings can perform looking in a literal sense; the language of looking is only figuratively applicable to mirrors or receiving instruments.</page><page sequence="6">500 NICHOLAS RESCHER that in some ways reflects its own operations in some fundamental respects. It cannot be emphasized sufficiently that such a conceptual ide alism does not take the form of spiritualism or panpsychism; it need not and does not maintain that only minds exist and that all there is is somehow the work of mind in any productive or causative sense. Rather, this idealist position sees our characterizations of the real as proceeding in mind-referring terms. The position rests squarely on the classical idealistic doctrine that mind contributes essentially to the constitution?as well as the constituting?of our knowledge of reality, achieving this by characterizing things in its own terms, in using inherently mentalistic conceptions and categories. The conceptualistic idealist sees mind as an explicative para digm for our understanding of the real, rather than as a productive source in the causal order of its genetic explanation. This position does not see mind as the causal source of reality, but as making a formative contribution to the shape?as well as the shaping?of its characterization of the real. There may well be a realm of mind-independent reality. Indeed, a commitment to its existence is undoubtedly part and parcel of our standard conceptual scheme for thinking about the real. But this mind-independent reality is not something about whose nature as such we can secure any descriptive information. Reality as we know it is cognitively accessible only through the mediation of our con cepts; it is an empirical reality because it is accessible to us through experience alone, and this experience is always interpreted experi ence. There just are no mind-untouched experiential building blocks that the mind first receives and then assembles, because mind from the very start touches and pervades everything experiential. The mind-untouched reality underlying the world of our experentially grounded knowledge is something to whose existence (whose that) we stand committed but about whose nature (whose what) we neither do obtain nor can obtain any knowledge. II Let us begin the survey of conceptual idealism's main theses by considering particularity. To be a particular is to be identifiable as an individual item with an identity of its own: to be distinguish</page><page sequence="7">CONCEPTUAL IDEALISM REVISITED 501 able as one discrete item in contradistinction to others. In its very nature, particularity consists in identifiability, distinguishability, and discriminability. But all of these processes (identifying, dis tinguishing, discriminating) are fundamentally mind-involving; each involves the sort of thing that mind-endowed beings, and only mind endowed beings, can do. The impact of this argument that identification is mind-involv ing is tempered by the following line of objection: Let it be granted that your argument has shown that to say "X is identified" is to make a mind-referential claim. But this does not mean that "Xis identifiable" is mind-involving. Your approach slurs the crucial distinction between actuality and possibility. Consider the pairs: described/describable, mentioned/mentionable, indicated/ indicatable, and identified/identifiable. If one grants that the first member of such a pair is mind-involving, one does not thereby concede that the second member is. Thus, saying that a certain particular is identified may well carry a covert reference to a mind, but this does not show that its identifiability is mind-dependent. Consequently, since generic particularity demands only identifiability, and not actual identification, your argument that actual identification is mind-in volving does not show that identifiability is, and so does not suffice to establish the conclusion that particularity is. This objection is to some extent well taken, specifically insofar as its aim is to make the point?a surely correct one?that actual iden tification is not a necessary requirement for being a particular, since there is no contradiction in saying that there are particulars which are not identified (though obviously one cannot give an example of one). But the harmfulness of the objection can be deflected by rec ognizing the fundamental difference between identification on the one hand, and description, indication, and the rest on the other. Identification is, in the present context, entirely unique and sui ge neris in a way that impedes straightforward application of the anal ogy of actual and potential on which the objection rests. It makes perfectly good sense to say of something that it is describable but not described or indicatable but not indicated. The actual/potential distinction is indeed operative in these cases. But this is not so with identification: we cannot in principle meaningfully say of something that it is identifiable but not identified, because to say this is literally nonsense. One would be saying explicitly that one doesn't know of what one is speaking. Until it has been identified (however imperfectly) we simply are not dealing with a particular individual thing; we cannot appropriately be held to say anything</page><page sequence="8">502 NICHOLAS RESCHER about "it"?not even that it is identifiable. To say this is not, of course, to deny that we can speak of otherwise unspecified partic ulars, as in a statement like "One of the trees in this forest has treasure buried beneath it." But cases of this sort pose no difficulty for our position. Note that if indeed there is treasure under just one tree, then we have, in effect, succeeded in making an identifying reference to it (as "the tree that has treasure beneath it"); but if there are several trees above the treasure (or none) at all, then there just is no "it" about which we can be said to be speaking: our pur portedly identifying reference fails to refer, so that our statement becomes?under these circumstances?semantically unviable. It is useful at this stage to recall once more the distinction between ontological mind-dependency (mind-invokingness) and con ceptual mind-dependency (mind-involvingness). Granted, only identification is mind-dependent in the strong sense of mind-in volvingness, and not identifiability. But this does not prevent iden tifiability from being conceptually mind-involving?as it indeed is. To say of something that it is related to minds in a certain way (specifically in the way of admitting being identified by them) is obviously to characterize it in conceptually mind-referring terms (even as describing it as visible would be to characterize it in con ceptually sight-referring terms of reference). Again, consider the following objection: "It goes without saying that a critical distinction exists between the thing identified on the one hand, and the identification of the thing on the other. Your argument overlooks this key distinction. Surely, to establish the mind-involvement of the identification of the thing does not show the mind-involvement of the identified thing as such." This objec tion hits wide of the mark. It rests on a wholly improper compar ison. There is a crucial disanalogy between identifying on the one hand and seeing or describing on the other, for we can only consider "the thing identified" once some "identification of the thing" has been given: any possible entertainment of the former (the thing identified) is contingent upon the latter (the identification of the thing). The conceptual viability of "the thing identified" as an item of consideration is inextricably bound up with the identification of the thing at issue. By contrast, nothing whatever about the de scribability of something rests upon the description of this thing. The hypothetical removal of its identification removes the thing in view in a way that the hypothetical removal of its description would not. This critical disanalogy is fatal to the objection.</page><page sequence="9">CONCEPTUAL IDEALISM REVISITED 503 Of course, any such talk of specific things still leaves open the issue of generic identifiability. It obviously makes sense to say ge nerically that "Something is identifiable but not identified" even though it can be admitted that one cannot meaningfully say (spe cifically) of something that it is identifiable but not identified. And this point is relevant to our purposes, because the task of the present discussion is not to maintain merely that the actual identification of particulars is mind-dependent, but that particularity in general is. But since it is conceptual mind-involvingness that is here at issue, the fact that identification is a mind-invoking process suffices to show that identifiability (that is, admitting to the possibility of identification) is also of this nature. The key fact is that individuatability is not a somehow incidental feature of a thing but is crucial to its very existence as an individual thing. Consequently, to show that mind-invocation enters in at this specific point is to establish that the very standing of a thing as the individual particular it is rests upon a resource the very concept of which involves essential reference to the workings of minds. To summarize: only two conceptual routes lead into the realm of the particular, that of actual identification and that of potential identifiability. The former?identification?is conceptually mind invoking because identification is an attention-directing, and thus overtly mental, process. The latter?identifiability?is implicitly mind-involving both because of the mentalesque nature of identi fication itself, and also (to foreshadow) because of the mind-involving nature of possibility as such. The mind-dependence of particularity has far-reaching conse quences, for not only does it affect particular things/substances, it also affects particularity in other categories. Specifically, consider the following: ?the attribution of a particular physical property to something ?the attribution of a particular spatiotemporal feature (for example, shape) ?the specification of a particular cause or effect ?the specification of a particular process. Each of these involves a fundamentally mind-invoking transaction, because in each case the particularity at issue is enmeshed in an invocation of mind that is of just the same general sort that is at issue in item-identification.</page><page sequence="10">504 NICHOLAS RESCHER III Reality and causality are inseparably coordinated. To be phys ically real is to be a part of the world's causal commerce. But the conception of causality itself is, quite obviously, inseparable from that of causal principles or laws. Now, causal laws are more than mere generalizations. They have counterfactual force and char acterize not just what does happen when but what would happen if. The element of causal necessity and counterfactual force is inherent in their nature, and they encompass not only the actual but the hypothetically possible as well. But this realm of mere possibility? of what is not present as part of nature's realities but accessible only via supposition, assumption, and hypothesis?is part and parcel of the realm of mind-involvingness. For hypothesizing and its cog nates (supposing, assuming) are one and all things that mind-en dowed beings alone can do. Reality is simply factual and actualistic. Figuratively put, it talks the language of is and knows nothing of maybe. It contains no mere possibilities and admits of no element of the merely hypothetical (over and above comprising mind-en dowed beings who can project hypotheses). The only access route to the purely possible is that of supposition, assumption, and hy pothesis?all of which call for mind-endowed beings to come upon the scene. One salient argument for the mind-involvingness of mere pos sibilities runs as follows: To explain what a mere possibility is, one has to contrast it with a real possibility. A real possibility is one that can come to be realized through developed processes producing changes in real things (the possible oak tree that may emerge from this acorn). A mere possi bility is one that cannot come about (be realized) through the mach inations of the real; it can only be assumed (supposed, hypothesized). The concept of a mere possibility is accordingly mind-invoking in the standard, explanatory ordered sense of that term. Possibilities as such can be either real or mere; it is the mereness of a mere possibility that is conceptually mind-invoking. To explicate what it is to be (merely) possible we thus need to involve the operation of minds, for the merely possible is not a part of the world's furnishings; it is something that can only be imagined, sup posed, conjectured, hypothesized. That is, it is by its very nature something whose status is correlative with something that only</page><page sequence="11">CONCEPTUAL IDEALISM REVISITED 505 minds can do.3 The concept of the "merely possible" is accordingly an instance of a mind-invoking conception. Its adequate explanation requires a reference to the sort of thing that only minds can do. Real possibilities are possibilities de re: "It is possible for Felix the cat to be on the mat." Hypothetical possibilities are de dicto possibilities: "It is possible for a cat (even a merely hypothetical cat) to be on the mat." Their status and condition in the explanatory nature of things is based on assumptions, suppositions. To explain adequately what mere possibility (in contrast to that of a real pos sibility) is all about, we must bring mental operations (assuming, supposing, hypothesizing) into the discussion. In view of this, hy pothetical possibilities are inherently mind-involving. And this has important consequences for laws. Consider the following exposition of one of conceptual idealism's key theses offered by one acute critic: Reseller's argument here rests on two points. First, he maintains that fictional [i.e., nonexistent, "merely hypothetical"] things must exist in some sense because they are said to be real possibilities; and then he argues that the only sense in which they could be said to exist is as the object of certain mental processes such as imagining or sup posing.4 There is a substantial misunderstanding here. The position at issue is not the old Parmenidean/Platonic doctrine that even nonexistents must "exist" in some sense because they can be talked about (as sumed, supposed, and so on). Our theory does not propose to es tablish the link between fictionality and mind-dependency by using existence as a middle term as in the argument: 1. Fictional objects must have an existence of some sort. 2. The only sort of existents that fictional objects can have is a mind-correlative one. Therefore: Fictional objects have a mind-correlative existence. 3 The point is not that only the merely possible be supposed (assumed, conjectured); it is that the merely possible can only be supposed?it cannot be positioned in reality's scheme of things in a mind-independent way. 4 Dennis Temple, "Conceptual Idealism and Unrealized Possibility," Philosophy and Culture: Proceedings at the XVI World Congress of Philosophy (Montreal: Congress Publications, 1988), 44-50; see p. 46.</page><page sequence="12">506 NICHOLAS RESCHER This sort of ontological argumentation is not at issue in the concep tual idealism envisioned here. For the fact is that the linkage be tween a fictionality (that is, assumptive or suppositional or hypo thetical status) and mind-involvingness is not enthymematically mediated but immediate, because fictionality (and its assurative cognates) are inherently mind-invoking in their conceptual makeup. The point is that to make proper use of "merely possible objects" we must characterize them as fictions, and thereby characterize them in mind-referring terms of reference, seeing that fictions are, of necessity, the creatures of a mind. But does not conceptual idealism's thesis that hypothetical pos sibilities are mind-invoking run into difficulty because of a failure to distinguish between what is supposed (the hypothetical possibility in question) and the supposing of it?this latter alone being mind invoking? Are we not committing with reference to supposition the same old error that Berkeley committed with reference to perception, by refusing to distinguish what is perceived with the perceiving of it? By no means! The cases are quite disanalogous. With existents we are (ex hypothesi) at liberty to distinguish the thing at issue from the perceiving of it. Precisely because it exists: it is (ex hy pothesi) there to be so distinguished. But with nonexistents this prospect is all too plainly absent. Berkeley was wrong; with existents we cannot maintain that to be is to be perceivable (let alone per ceived) by us, simply because there can or might be actual things existing entirely outside our perceptual reach (gravity waves, for example). But with nonexistents the case is very different; here, to be is to be conceivable exactly because the item itself, being non existent, is no more (but also no less) than an object of assumption or supposition, and is constituted as the thing it is through the as suming or supposing of it. In this domain, to be is indeed to be conceivable. To make the transit from the mind involvement of mere pos sibility to that of laws we have to note that laws encompass the realm of possibility at large. There are three distinct sorts of pos sibilities. 1. real potentialities of actually existing things (if circum stances are favorable, that acorn will grow into an oak tree). 2. fictive possibilities for actually existing things (if that acorn were a cat, it would have a backbone).</page><page sequence="13">CONCEPTUAL IDEALISM REVISITED 507 3. mere possibilities (if a bolt of lightning hit here?not a re positioning of any of the actual ones, but a somehow addi tional one?then a thunderclap would sound here).5 But laws of nature apply to the sphere of possibility across the board, as the case 3 example shows. And it is crucial to their status as genuine laws that their application outruns the limits of the real into the realm of the merely hypothetical. (If a supposed "law" did not admit type 3 implementation, we would have to reject it as such.) If it is indeed a law of nature that mice have tails, then this will still hold good when I imagine (assume, suppose) that there is a mouse in my pocket. For if it is indeed a mouse that is there, then a tail has to be there as well. But to explain and expound this absolutely essential feature of laws (that they support counterfac tuals relating to mere possibilities) we will have to bring assump tions (suppositions) into it?we will have to make use of conceptions that relate quite explicitly to the operating of minds. Again, the thesis that "Oak trees are (lawfully) deciduous"?that is, "Oak trees have to be deciduous" in a sense that warrants "If that pine were an oak, then it would be deciduous"?does not deal with actuality alone, but frames its claims about "the facts" in such a way as to bring in a realm of the hypothetically possible which, by the very nature of the hypothetical, is inherently mind-involving. To be sure, mere regularity calls for no more than a universal generalization of the type: (1) AUX is Y. But genuine lawfulness goes well beyond this to call for stipulations of the form: (2) All Xis Y, and if any Z that is not an Xwere an X, then Z would be a Y. Here (1) is simply an issue of existential fact: if it is in fact the case that "All (pure) mercury solidifies at ? 150?F," then this circum stance could continue to be operative even if one abstracted from all reference to minds, overt and covert alike. But a type (2) generalization?a lawful generalization?would fare differently. Its reference to Z's which are not Jfs having to have certain 5 The first two sorts of possibilities are unproblematically de re, but the third has to be cashed in through an ultimately de dicto reformulation.</page><page sequence="14">508 NICHOLAS RESCHER characteristics if they were JTs involves claims outside the domain of ontological fact, claims of which sense can be made only by the use of mind-invoking conceptions of possibility. The mind's ability to use its concept-apparatus to project the specification of entities that, as it fully recognizes, have no standing in the world's scheme of things is one of its characteristic capacities?one that is crucial to operate the conception of lawfulness as we have it. The implicit projection of merely hypothetical possibilities is crucial to lawfulness and represents an element of intellectual artifice that is among the most obviously self-provided constructions the human mind af fords us. But, as another critic complains,6 does not a law simply char acterize what does happen in this world irrespective of any reference to mere possibilities? The answer is neither yes nor no. A law of nature indeed characterizes what does happen in the world, but it does so in terms of what must happen in the world?and thus does not effect its characterization without reference to possibilities. Laws are?and qua laws have to be?more than mere generaliza tions. For the crucial point is that laws support counterfactuals; they not only hold for the real things of this world but also for those mere possibilities which we project into it by means of suppositions, hypotheses, and assumptions. Lawfulness is the product of the well-founded imputation to em pirical generalizations of nomic necessity and hypothetical force, whose nature is inherently (albeit implicitly) mind-involving. Both pivotal factors, the essentially factual element of well-foundedness and the essentially decisional element of imputation, are necessary to laws. Well-founding is essential because the very spirit of the scientific enterprise demands reliance only upon tested generaliza tions that have a solid observational or experimental basis. But the element of imputation is also essential since?as emphasized above?we can only observe what is, that is, what forms parts of the realm of the actual, and not what corresponds to the modally necessary or the hypothetically possible. The nomic necessity and hypothetical force characteristic of lawfulness thus represent factors that a generalization cannot conceivably earn for itself on the basis of observational or experimental evidence alone: it has to be endowed 6 Baruch Brody, "[Review of] Conceptual Idealism," The Philosophical Review 84 (1975): 580-2; see p. 581.</page><page sequence="15">CONCEPTUAL IDEALISM REVISITED 509 with these factors. The basic aspect of a lawful proposition is on this view not the qualitative aspect of being-a-law but the relational aspect of being-maintained-as-a-law. Lawfulness is in the final analysis a relational rather than an absolute and purely descriptive feature with minds playing a key part in the relationship at issue, although, to be sure, a part only. Lawfulness involves possibility, and the gulf between the actual and the merely possible is one that can be bridged?and can only be bridged?by minds.7 There is a crucial difference between a claim's being a descrip tive truth about the real world as such and its being of the sort which?like a law?in its very meaning and purport goes beyond the real world. Descriptive statements about the real are embodied in assertions that do indeed appertain only to the real world. But statements about what is necessary or what is (merely) possible have to be construed in terms of reference to the domain of mere possibility as well. That something is necessary (holds in all [phys ically] possible worlds) or that it is merely possible (holds in some other [physically] possible world) are claims which by their very nature transcend the descriptive characterization of the real. The truth conditions of such facts do not turn simply on the descriptive constitution of the actual world, but invoke reference to the situ ation in "other possible worlds" as well?worlds to which our only mode of entry lies (in the very nature of the situation) only through the route of supposition, assumption, and hypothesis. It is clearly only through thought?through the imagination as deployed in as sumptions, suppositions, and hypotheses?that we can get cognitive access to other possible worlds. It is necessary to face one rather immediate consequence of the doctrine of the mind-involvement of lawfulness, namely, that cau sality will stand on exactly the same footing. To speak of causation is to invoke (however tacitly) the operation of causal laws. (That heating the water caused it to boil can only be maintained on the basis of some thesis of the general type of the causal law "Water boils when heated to 100?C at sea-level altitudes.") That any dis cussion of causation in the scientific context is coordinate with an 7 While laws are indeed man-made, they are?of course?not thereby made as man wants them to be. In maintaining that the necessity and hypotheticality of lawfulness are matters of imputation, we thus have no wish to suggest that the issue is one of indifferent conventions or arbitrary decisions.</page><page sequence="16">510 NICHOLAS RESCHER at least implicit reference to causal laws is a part of general agree ment among present-day philosophers of science. The very idea of a causal connection between events is deployed in a generalized way that envisions their relationship as governed by a law, a causal law. In this way, the argument inherent in our analysis of lawfulness as conceptually mind-dependent leads inexorably to an acceptance of the traditional idealistic view that causality is mind-dependent. Thus relative to our standard conceptual scheme, the mentalistic resource of counterfact is required, via lawfulness, for our concep tualized apprehension of the realm of causally interrelated fact. In somewhat Kantian terms, our experience of the real as a network of causality involves and presupposes a wider realm governed by the category of possibility. To consider a relationship among actual occurrences within the space-time framework in terms of a causal linkage is to regard it in a setting of powers and potentialities that inevitably ramify into the fact-transcending and mind-involving sphere of "what would happen if." If lawfulness is consensually mind-involving, then so is causality. Here, then, is the picture of what conceptual idealism carries over to its main points. IV What sorts of things are at issue when we ascribe properties to things? There are two principal prospects here: (1) The property at issue may be an empirical property that is ascribed in virtue of the way in which things affect us?how they impact on our own senses or their instrumental extensions, or (2) the point at issue is a dispositional one that serves to explain how things affect (or appear to affect) one another. But both roads to property-ascription are mind-invoking. In the former, sensory (phenomenal) case, the situation with respect to mind-involvement is clear since only mind-endowed beings can have experiences. By an "empirical property" we shall here understand?quite in the literal sense of this term?one whose as cription to something reports the result of experiential contact (be it direct or indirect) with this item. Such properties by their very nature indicate how experiencing agents or the instrumentalities they employ normally or standardly react to or interact with the thing to which the property is ascribed in observation and analogous</page><page sequence="17">CONCEPTUAL IDEALISM REVISITED 511 processes. A manifest color predicate like "red" affords a paradigm example, because quite clearly any predicate that states how a thing standardly looks (feels, smells, and the like) is patently mind-ref erential. But not only these "predicates of sense-observation," as we may call them, but those of any mode of "observation" whatso ever, however complex the procedures and instrumentalities involved may be, are of this sort. All such predicates that embody a claim as to how something is standardly-observed-to-be are clearly mind referential, because of the inherently mind-referential nature of ob servation per se. Observation, after all, is in its essential nature a process of interaction in which a mind is necessarily one of the items involved: it is inherent in the very concept that "observing" is an interaction between a mind and some sector of reality. Thus even apart from the fact that complex modes of observations are (like measurement) dispositional and law-correlative?and so mind-in volving?they are also mind-invoking because by their very nature they report the results of experiential interaction. We turn now to dispositional properties that react to the ca pacities of things to elicit characteristic responses from others. By their very nature, all such dispositional properties are law-correl ative and consequently mind-involving (in accordance with the pre ceding argument that dispositionality and lawfulness in general represent mind-involving conceptions). And so, while theoretical descriptive terms may, admittedly, fail to be directly observational (and so not mind-invoking in the dispositional manner at issue above), they are still inherently dispositional: since scientific pred icates are inevitably applied only to characterize some lawfully in teractional aspect of things.8 The mind-involvement of dispositional properties as inherently lawful suffices also to establish at once the mind-involvement of all 8 Note that with people we might well draw a distinction between those properties they have "in themselves" (for instance, being intelligent or Spanish or music-loving) and those properties that merely indicate their impact upon others (such as being confidence-inspiring, repulsive, amusing, or likeable). This clearly carries over into our talk of things (a statue can be bronze and Venus-representing on the one hand and life-like and awe inspiring on the other). Now the point is that those scientific predicates that are not essentially classificatory (felix leo) or composition-indicative (carbon, gold) are for the most part of the sort that indicates an impact upon other things (conductor, acid, predator).</page><page sequence="18">512 NICHOLAS RESCHER of our standard groupings of classification with respect to the lawful behavior of things. This has vast repercussions as regards the groupings of the classificatory system we standardly employ in our thought about nature. Thus the ascription to particulars of such classificatory features as "being made of iron," "being made of glass," "being a lion," or "being a maple" is just as dispositional (and hence mind-invoking) as being malleable, being fragile, or being a con ductor.9 The conceptual mind-involvement of dispositions is the "thin end of the wedge" that can be used to establish the comparable status of all the empirical properties of the things of our ordinary, conceptual scheme that represent classifications linked essentially to lawful behavior. V To have a position in space and time is to be locatable in space time?to be relatable to other things in terms of placement (above, below, right, left), distance (nearer, more remote), and timing (now, earlier, later). But all positioning of things (be it in relating them to one another observationally or with reference to a coordinate placement scheme of some sort) involves a mental process. The very idea of location and placement in particular identifiable posi tions is conceptually mind-invoking. To locate something is to note or indicate its spatial or temporal placement in relation to something else, and this clearly involves identifying things and their positions, which, as we have seen, is something that is inexplicably bound up with the machinations of mind. Whenever a structure of particular (identified or identifiable) positions is at issue, mind-involvingness comes upon the scene once again. If particular-identification is geared in mind-invoking (as we have seen), then so is space-time positioning. Moreover, spatial and temporal positioning by their very nature involve measurement. But observational mensuration of all sorts? Chronometrie included?requires the specification of concrete indi viduals. It is crucial that in the measuring process we deal at each given stage with one selfsame measuring implement, with the same 9 Cf. K. R. Popper, Conjectures and Refutations (New York: Basic Books, 1962), 387.</page><page sequence="19">CONCEPTUAL IDEALISM REVISITED 513 measuring rod or the same clock (or other periodic mechanism), reidentifying it and its parts as particulars. And, of course, such reidentification demands and indeed surpasses the demand for the identification of particulars. Thus if our case for the mind-involve ment of particular-identification has any merit, it works also to es tablish the mind-involvement of mensuration in general and chro nometry in particular. VI It may seem plausible to object to conceptual idealism with the following contention: How can one sensibly maintain the mind-dependency of matter as ordinarily conceived, when all the world recognizes that the operations of mind are based on the machinations of matter? (As Mark Twain asked: "When the body is drunk does the mind stay sober?") To be an idealist in the face of this recognition is surely to be involved in a vicious or at least vitiating circle. This objection simply gets things wrong. There is simply no ques tion of any real conflict when the proper distinctions have been drawn, because altogether different sorts of dependencies or re quirements are at issue in the following two theses: (1) Mind is causally dependent upon (that is, causally requires) matter, in that mental process demands causally or pro ductively the physical workings of matter. (2) Matter (conceived of in the standard manner of material substance subject to physical law) is explicatively dependent upon (that is, conceptually requires) mind, in that the con ception of material processes involves hermeneutically or semantically the mentalistic working of mind. We return once again to the crucial distinction between the concep tual order with its essentially hermeneutic or explicative perspective upon the intellectual exposition of meanings, and the causal order with its explanatory perspective upon the causal rationalization of physical processes. In the hermeneutic framework of consideration, our concern is not with any facets of the causal explanation of in tellectual processes, but upon understanding them from within, on their own terms. The issue is not one of causal explanation at all,</page><page sequence="20">514 NICHOLAS RESCHER but one of the understanding to be achieved through an analysis of the internal meaning-content of concepts and of the semantic in formation conveyed by statements in which they are operative. Be cause of the fundamental difference between these two perspectives, any conflict in the dependency relations to which they give rise is altogether harmless from the standpoint of actual inconsistency. The circle breaks because different modes of dependency are involved: we move from mind to matter in the conceptual order of under standing (of rationes cognoscendi or rather concipiendi) and from matter to mind in the explanatory order of causation (rationes es sendi). Once all the necessary distinctions are duly heeded, any semblance of vicious circularity disappears. No doubt, this calls for a certain amount of care and subtlety, but then so do many issues of intellectual life. Conceptual idealism's view is that the sphere of matter is mind involving in that the concept of material objects, located in space and time and interacting with one another, is shot through with mind-invoking conceptions. But this entire argument that mind is basic for matter is carried through in the conceptual order, based on the idea that a mind-invoking conception is one whose ultimate analysis demands a reference to minds or their capabilities. The "mentalistic" or mind-referring sector of a conceptual framework is accordingly spanned by those of its conceptions whose rational exposition can only be accomplished in ultimately mind-invoking terms, that is, by means of concepts relating to characteristically mental capabilities. Conceptual idealism stakes no claims to prior ity of mind over matter in the causal order; its position leaves open entirely the prospect that mind could hinge on matter in point of causation. Accordingly, the conceptual idealist's thesis that one specific direction of dependence (that of the physical upon that of the mental) is built into the view of reality at issue in our standard conceptual scheme must not be seen as conflicting with the debatable (but by no means thereby negligible) prospect that the scientific explanation of causal relationships might envision a reversal in the direction of dependence. When different perspectives are involved, seemingly conflicting theses are perfectly compatible. (I can say without con flict that my car is economical in point of gas mileage and uneco nomical in point of maintenance costs.)</page><page sequence="21">CONCEPTUAL IDEALISM REVISITED 515 But even if no vicious circle arises, do we not arrive at an equally vicious infinite regress that altogether precludes under standing? For is understanding not ruled out from the outset if an adequate understanding of mind requires reference to its causal origins in matter and an adequate understanding of matter requires reference to its functional presuppositions of a mind-invoking sort? The answer is negative. Avoiding regress would be necessary only if one adopted an essentially linear model of understanding. But this is quite inappropriate in the case of coordinated concepts such as the present instance of mind/matter or the simpler case of cause/ effect. To say that we cannot fully understand the cause until we understand its effect, and that we cannot fully understand the effect until we understand the cause, is not to show that there is a vitiating regress with the result that we cannot understand either one. All it shows is that two such coordinated and interrelated concepts can not be set out through a sequential explanation but must be grasped together in their systematic unity. An analogy may be helpful at this point. Take a knife and its blade. If that object is to count as a knife, then that shiny thing attached to the handle must be a blade, but this thing cannot count as a blade unless the whole it comprises together with that handle is a knife. The two items stand in conceptually symbiotic apposition: X cannot be properly characterized as X unless it is duly related to Y and Y cannot be properly characterized as such unless it is duly related to X. We cannot pick up either end of the stick in separation from the other, but must grasp the whole in one fell swoop. Just such a cognitive coordination of mentalistic and materialistic con cepts holds with respect to our present analysis of their mutual interdependencies. By maintaining proper distinctions, any collapse into vicious circularity or vitiating regress can be avoided. Conceptual idealism is thus even compatible with a causal ma terialism maintaining that matter is basic to mind in the causal order. On the causal issues of the origins of mind, conceptual ide alism is silent and so compatible with various theories, materialism itself not excluded. Conceptual idealism is not an explanatory the ory regarding the causal mechanisms of the mind's processes or mode of origination; it is an analytical theory regarding the nature of the conceptual mechanisms of the categories of understanding. It can thus coexist with any theory of mind that is articulated along</page><page sequence="22">516 NICHOLAS RESCHER strictly causal lines, be it a materialistic view that sees the causal origin of mind in matter of a Cartesian-style dualism of reciprocal influence or even an epiphenomenalism. The conceptual idealist thus has no vested interest in denying that mind and its functioning may be somehow causally emergent from the processes of matter. His point is simply that our standard rational account of the world?its material sector specifically in cluded?is given in terms of reference that are at bottom mind involving. It is the analytical issue of how we think of the world, not the explanatory issue of its causal occurrences, that constitutes the focus of concern. This position does not need to be argued through an attack upon causal materialism; it is quite compatible with the idea that mental functioning has its material basis and causal origins in the realm of physical process. Another critic has offered the following objection: [Reseller's] argument [for the compatibility of materialism and con ceptual idealism] is that, for the materialist, there is a causal depen dence of mind on matter, whereas for the conceptual idealist there is a conceptual dependence of matter (reality-as-we-know-it) on mind. But I wonder if the issue is as clear as the simple recourse to a con ceptual-causal distinction would suggest. If "matter" bears the same sense in both dependency claims, then the matter on which mind causally depends is itself conceptually infested with mind. Now, it is often said that, to make a genuinely causal claim, cause and effect must be independently describable. But if Rescher is right, then of course matter cannot be wholly described in terms independent of its supposed effect, mind.10 The fly in this objection's ointment lies in its construing of the "in dependent describability" of cause and effect. The validity of the causal thesis hinges on independent characterizability in the causal sense of independence. But any purely conceptual dependency will be quite immaterial as long as it does not intrude upon causal mat ters?as purely conceptual relationships would surely find it difficult to do. A purely conceptual role ("infestation") of mind in matter is accordingly quite perfectly innocuous. But what of an "identity theory of mind" that identifies mental processes with the operation of certain material configurations, 10 David-Hillel Ruben, "[Review of] Conceptual Idealism," Mind 85 (1976): 138-40; see p. 140.</page><page sequence="23">CONCEPTUAL IDEALISM REVISITED 517 namely, our brains? Is our conceptual idealism not incompatible with such a theory? Not necessarily. It depends upon whether the identity is seen as a factual one (like the identity of the morning star with the evening star or that of the tallest man in the room with the poorest man in the room), or as a conceptually necessary one (like that of Smith's only brother with Smith's only male sibling). Our idealism will encounter no difficulties with a thesis of contingent identity. An incompatibility will arise only if the identity theory of the mental with the material is taken to obtain in conceptual terms, as holding the essentially concept-relative thesis that men talistic talk is eliminable, in that it can be translated without con ceptually viable residue into talk about the behavior of matter. Such a conceptually eliminative reductionism is incompatible with con ceptual idealism. For if "mentalese" were analytically altogether reducible to materialistic discourse, then mind could not be concep tually basic to matter in the sense of our theory. But, of course, since our theory is based on an analysis of the ordinary conceptual scheme, this goes no further than to show that this ordinary scheme is incompatible with a conceptually reductive materialism, and this upshot is perhaps not surprising. (If we point out to the reductive materialist that he violates the ordinary conceptual scheme, he may well reply that he is only too ready to do so. In taking this stance he is, to be sure, not inconsistent, but he does cut himself off from participation in those discussions that take place within the men talistic framework of our standard conceptual scheme.) Conceptual idealism pivots on the fact that the conceptual in struments that the mind uses in forming its representations of real ity are seen not only as mind-made (this point, though true, is altogether trivial), but also in various respects as mind-patterned, and so reflective of their mentalistic origin. The conceptual devices mind deploys for constructing its view of reality are themselves heavily imbued?in the final analysis?with reference to the work ings of mind. It is this fact of the analytical fundamentality of mind-invoking conceptions, and not any considerations regarding its causal origins, that renders mind basic to matter in the concep tual order. One critic complains as follows: If, as Rescher seems to imply, it is just a matter of fact that we have experience of our own minds, then why should we find our factual</page><page sequence="24">518 NICHOLAS RESCHER experience of "mind-endowed individuals" more intelligible than that of non-mental particulars, or of "mind-inaugurated agency" more in telligible than that of non-mental causes?11 The difficulty that this objection poses is readily met. As Cicero noted (Egomet mihi proximus sum) and Descartes reemphasized, we are experientially closer to our own selves. A philosophy that re spects the standpoint of empiricism in emphasizing the primacy of experience clearly does well to begin here with our own selves, with the mental processes that are the stuff and substance of our thought-life. VII The most common objection to idealism in general centers on the issue of the mind-independence of the real. "Surely," runs the objection, "things in nature would remain substantially unchanged if there were no minds. Had intelligent creatures never evolved on the earth, its mountains and valleys would nevertheless be much as they are, and the sun and moon remain substantially unaffected." This contention is perfectly plausible in one aspect, namely, the causal one?which is just why causal idealism has its problems. But it is certainly not true conceptually, for the objector must face the question of specifying just exactly what it is that would remain the same. "Surely roses would smell just as sweet in a mind-de nuded world!" Well. . . yes and no. Agreed: the absence of minds would not change roses. But rose-fragrance and sweetness?and even the size and shape of roses?are features whose character hinges on such mind-invoking operations as smelling, scanning, measuring, and the like. For something really to be a rose it must, unavoidably, have various capacities to evoke mental responses. It must admit of identification, specification, classification, and prop erty attribution, and these, by their very nature, are all mental op erations. The situation is substantially the same with respect to those "objects" we call the sun and the moon. To be sure, the role 11 Leon Pompa, "[Review of] Conceptual Idealism," The Philosophical Quarterly 25 (1975): 85-7; see p. 87.</page><page sequence="25">CONCEPTUAL IDEALISM REVISITED 519 of mind is here hypothetical. ("If certain interactions with duly constituted observers take place, then certain outcomes will be noted.") But the fact remains that nothing could be discriminated or characterized as a definite particular "object" in a context where the prospect of performing suitable mental operations is not pre supposed. Even in projecting a (hypothetically) mindless world we still make reference to the mental when we characterize a situation in mind-involving terms?in depicting things, for example, in terms of how minds would respond in interacting with them. And so a conceptual idealism remains in order. On conceptual idealism's telling, there is something indelibly anthropomorphic (man-patterned) or, more accurately, noomorphic (mind-patterned), in the way in which we think about the world. Against this view, someone may urge the objection that, "Surely, this does not show anything about the world itself, but rather about us." However, this objection loses sight of the fact that there is no clean and sharp separation between reality and the domain of thought, because our only possible route to cognitive contact with "the real world" is through the mediation of our conceptions about it, so that, for us, "the world" is inevitably "the world as we conceive of it." And in consequence, how we conceive of the world (namely, in noomorphic terms) has to be seen as a fact not just about us, but about "the world" as well. To be sure, all that our specifically conceptual idealism shows? and all that it is by its very nature in a position to show?is that reality as we standardly conceive of it is conceived of by us in mind involving terms of reference. It is a doctrine regarding our con ception of reality rather than one about the constitution of reality per se, about its descriptive rather than substantive makeup. The conceptual idealism envisioned here is accordingly not a transcendental thesis about how matters must stand in general and in abstract. It does not maintain that any possible way of conceiving nature must proceed in mind-invoking terms of reference (difficult though it is for us to imagine how things could be otherwise). Its mission, rather, is to discern and characterize the role of mind invocation operative in the standard conceptual framework that we in fact use to recognize and interpret our experience. Conceptual idealism is not a doctrine about any and every pos sible conception of reality, but only one regarding what has here</page><page sequence="26">520 NICHOLAS RESCHER been characterized as "our standard conception of reality." Its strictures need not and will not apply to other possible conceptions of the real. Specifically, it does not apply to a contingent regularity view of the world that dispenses both with laws (and thus lawful processes) and with the disposition-demarcated particulars to whose conception lawfulness is indispensable. And while it is not easy to conceive in detail what such a kaleidoscopic reality that dispenses both with particulars and with laws would be like, nevertheless, that does not render it impossible. All this must be conceded. Is this concession damaging? Does it mean that conceptual idealism, with its focus in the ideational mechanisms in whose terms "we standardly think" of the real, really has no more than a socio logical significance? The answer is clearly negative. For while how we act is simply a reflection of sociological matters, how we think of things is, clearly, an issue of deeper and more far-reaching ontological ramifications. There is, ultimately, no way of limiting the consequences of "how we think of things" to appertain merely and wholly to facts about us rather than facts about them. Still, must not a genuine idealism ask for more? Must it not argue transcendentally that every possible conceptual scheme for exploiting experience to form a picture of objective reality must be mind-involving? Can it rest content with what is so standardly rather than inevitably'! As one critic has objected: Rescher tries to handle the problem by an appeal . . . to . . . the standard conceptual framework. But . . . the real and unavoidable problem is to determine the conditions of the possibility of any con ceptual framework whatsoever.12 A splendid Kantian ambition, this?but very much misguided. We surely cannot use the mechanism of our conceptual scheme to project from within the confines of that very conceptual scheme what the essential lineaments of other, different conceptual schemes must of necessity be. No state of science, no genre of art, no style of life or framework of thought can possibly manage to encompass all the rest. This sort of necessitarian thought-imperialism is just not in the cards. Our own cognitive position cannot at one and the same 12 Robert E. Inn?s, "[Review of] Conceptual Idealism," Foundations of Language 14 (1976): 287-95; see p. 294.</page><page sequence="27">CONCEPTUAL IDEALISM REVISITED 521 time be?as it must?just one position among others while encom passing them by embracing their essential features. A state of knowledge or doctrinal position can never find the grail of self-tran scendence; it can never transmute itself into being more than some thing that has been presumed to be just one particular alternative among others. The envisioned quest for a self-transcendingly tran scendental basis of "conditions under which alone conceptualization is possible" must accordingly be seen as a futile endeavor destined to failure from the very outset. (Why the implications of this fact are, for us, innocuous and in fact something positive rather than skeptically nihilistic will have to remain the object of discussion for another day.13) That standard concept-scheme of ours has to be taken at face value. No doubt, it is, in theory, simply one alternative among oth ers, without any inevitable foothold in the very structure of human intellect. No doubt, its status is the product of natural and cultural evolution. Let all this be as it may. Still, for us the fact remains that this scheme is what we have and is all that we have. What matters in the end is that this alternative is our alternative. Our intellectual dependence on it is as absolute as our physical depen dence on the air we breathe. For us there are no options. If this is "mere contingency" we have to make the most of it. VIII As long as one is prepared to draw the Kantian distinction be tween actual reality as such (reality as characterized descriptively by the real truth) and our putative or empirical reality, reality-as we-think-of-it (reality as characterized by the presumptive truth of our opinions about it), then the present conceptualistic perspective has a useful and informative role to play. In particular, it precludes our embarking on the hopeless task of discussing "things in them selves" as a peculiar and mysterious sort of objects. They do not exist as a separate category that imposes on us the trouble of a 13 The issue is treated in Nicholas Rescher, The Strife of Systems (Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press, 1985).</page><page sequence="28">522 NICHOLAS RESCHER separate consideration. To be sure, we can ask: "What can be said (appropriately and warrantedly) about the realm of existing things as we know it when we adopt the self-denying ordinance of abstain ing from using any of the terms associated with the sorts of concepts we have characterized as mind-invoking: individuality, experientially accessible properties, causality, spatiotemporal features, and so on?" This is a meaningful question that demands an answer. And the answer is that we can say precious little. We can?perhaps even must?presume that there is existence in such a domain, but we cannot say what it is like. With all of our standard descriptive categories in abeyance, we are pretty well rendered mute with re spect to the characterization of this realm?once we have presumed its existence and its existential essentiality to our familiar world. We are, in sum, in just about the position that Kant is in with respect to the thing-in-itself. The point, of course, is not what we can do for Kant, but what Kant can do for us, namely, provide us with a conception essential to formulating a sensible idealistic approach. For as Kant stressed, the reflexive "I think" is able everywhere to accompany our repre sentations. We know full well that whatever information we have about the world's arrangements is information that has come to us through the workings of the mind?that our knowledge of the world's facts is inevitably and invariably mediated by mental operations. In the final analysis we cannot avoid altogether facing the impli cation of the fact that, in our case, this mediation proceeds via con cepts which, while inevitably mind-supplied, are also de facto im plicitly mind-referring. But is an idealism worth having if, like our conceptual idealism, its endorsement does not preclude one's being a causal materialist? The answer here depends very much on one's standard of what counts as worthwhile. If antimaterialism is one's prime standard of philo sophical acceptability, then, clearly, such an idealism is not worth bothering about. But if one is sympathetic to idealism in its tra ditional sense of stressing the primacy of mind in the larger scheme of things, then conceptual idealism's emphasis on the centrality of mind is something one can regard as both illuminating and acceptable. In sum, then, conceptual idealism as here understood maintains the mind-involving nature of the concept-scheme we standardly em</page><page sequence="29">CONCEPTUAL IDEALISM REVISITED 523 ploy in the characterization of physical reality. But its stress is on the hermeneutic rather than the causal role of mind. Its claim is staked not to the transcendental mind-involvement of every possible concept-scheme for characterizing the real, but to the defacto mind involvement of our standard scheme. Its necessities are not cate gorical but conditional, geared to how things have to be relative to and conditional upon certain basic defacto givens. It is the mundane realities of our ordinary concepts that this mode of idealism ad dresses, and not the ethereal region of necessary and inescapable "conditions under which alone." And this circumstance is some thing which, though deserving of remark, requires no apology. To quote Cicero once more, Ridiculum est quaerere quod habere no possumus.14 The University of Pittsburgh 14 "It is absurd to ask for what we simply cannot have."</page></plain_text>
