Although research problems are identi fied, Chapter 4 does not really qualify as a re search design because it neither specifies data requirements nor explicitly links methods to the stated objectives. Nonetheless, this chapter does review the aims of CSUB's work and considers a number of topics that merit archaeological at tention in the project locality. Sutton's im pressive knowledge of the prehistory and current archaeological research issues in the western Mojave Desert is evident in this and subsequent chapters. Archaeological work and findings at eight small sites are reported in Chapter 5. Seven of these sites (CA-KER-2209, -2210, -2212, -2214, -2215, -2217, and -2218) are lithic scatters with fire-altered rock, groundstone, and faunal re mains. Temporal control is elusive, depending upon a single radiocarbon date of 2,490 ? 300 for CA-KER-2218 and a few time-sensitive shell beads and projectile points. Some of the latter are equivocal, however, given the evident mis identification of a "Desert Side-notched" point from CA-KER-2210 (Fig. 15a) and an "Elko Eared" point from CA-KER-2214 (Fig. 24b). Sutton concludes that the tested sites were most ly small camps, a lithic workshop (CA-KER 2212), and a special-use site (CA-KER-2217) dated variously to Gypsum, Rose Spring, and Late Prehistoric times. These tentative inter pretations reflect the very small samples of re covered data. Some sites (e.g., CA-KER-2212 and -2214) produced few archaeological re mains; others (e.g., CA-KER-2218) had substan tial data potentials but were sampled inadequate ly (possibly due to time and/or funding con straints?). The eighth site (CA-KER^2219H), a home stead dating perhaps to the 1930s, was mapped and recorded but not test-excavated because "vandals had dug into the trash pits and their depth and content were observable" (p. 81). Historical archaeologists will not be pleased with this brief account, which offers no historical research to identify former occupants, does not relate the site to historic contexts or themes, and describes the structural remains and material culture with considerably less detail and preci sion than is customary in historical archaeologi cal reports. The centerpiece of OPA No. 1 is Sutton's re port of investigations at CA-KER-2211, an ex tensive artifact scatter of variable density in a plowed field near Cache and Cottonwood creeks. The site was mapped, surface artifacts were col lected, two loci were defined, and cultural depo sits were sampled by surface scrapes, "post holes," and a total of 15 test units. Excavations in Locus 1 revealed numerous features (hearths, a rock pile, an obsidian cache, and a structural floor), and produced 4,449 pieces of debitage and 495 other artifacts (predominately mano and metate fragments, cores, projectile points, and Olivella beads). Although stratification was dis turbed, Sutton was able to show?through analy sis of artifact provenience, recovery of time sensitive projectile points, and four radiocarbon dates?that Locus 1 witnessed at least two sepa rate occupations after ca. A.D. 1200. Locus 2 yielded 695 artifacts, including 351 pieces of debitage, but no features. An abundance of mil ling equipment and silicate cores in Locus 2 par allels that of the late prehistoric component in Locus 1. Although one might quibble with some dubi ous type ascriptions (e.g., Figs. 50b, e-f, 68d) or fret over the rather superficial debitage anal ysis, the CA-KER-2211 report is mostly well written and informative. Artifact descriptions are generally good, data are presented economi cally in tables, and interpretations are reason able. While not all research objectives can be met with the recovered data, conclusions are tied</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 293 to the project's research design. In a final chapter, Sutton considers project results in the broader context of Fremont Valley archaeology. Intersite comparisons permit infer ences about adaptive systems during the Rose Spring and Late Prehistoric periods. The former "probably was focused on the exploitation of la custrine resources and hares," while the latter "shows a shift in the settlement pattern to habi tation near streams and/or springs, and an appa rent . . . shift in resource exploitation" (p. 181). Sutton also refers to climatic changes at ca. A.D. 1000, and suggests plausible economic and demographic consequences. He is careful not to overstate his conclusions but does raise some interesting possibilities for future research. Completing this monograph are four appen dices: a brief oral history transcript prepared by K. K. Swope; a summary by P. Bouey of XRF analysis of 35 obsidian specimens for which Sugarloaf Mountain was the principal source area; a detailed analysis of faunal remains from CA-KER-2211, by R. M. Yohe II and J. D. Goodman II; and M. Lyneis's brief but expert description of seven plain brown sherds from CA-KER-2211. OPA No. 2 is a collection of 11 papers deal ing with the Goose Lake locality, midway be tween Tulare Lake and the Buena Vista/Kern lakes system, in the southern San Joaqu?n Val ley. This monograph is focused mainly on the results of test excavations in 1989 by a CSUB field class at CA-KER-766 on the northeastern edge of Goose Lake. Five papers report investi gations and findings at this site. These are pre ceded by two chapters, respectively providing a cultural background and describing the natural environment of the study area. Also included are reports of: archaeological materials re covered in 1926 from CA-KER-46, just north of CA-KER-766; minimal testing in 1990 of CA KER-2107 near Lost Hills, just north of Goose Lake; sampling in 1977 of CA-KER-511, -512, and -513, south of Goose Lake; and human re mains found in 1978 during the excavation of an irrigation ditch near Lost Hills. In the first chapter, Sutton summarizes local ethnography, history, and prehistory, and calls attention to the enigmatic dearth of previous ar chaeological work and absence of a cultural chronology for the southern valley, even though the remarkable data potentials of this region have been known for nearly a century. This brief chapter adequately introduces the papers to follow. One may question, however, its applica tion of the Central California Taxonomic System to the lower Kern River area and its dating of the "Early Horizon" to 8,000 B.P. Complementing the Introduction is William Preston's overview of the natural setting (geol ogy, landforms, climate, hydrology, and biota), interspersed with vivid historical accounts, of the Goose Lake locality. This chapter amply shows that historic Goose Lake was a Yokuts oasis, "a unique valley environment where biological di versity and economic opportunities not only flourished but helped fashion a unique culture" (p. 9). In Chapter 3, Sutton describes the Goose Lake site, CA-KER-766, a scatter of artifacts and ecofacts on a low mound associated with an alkali sink plant community identified by the Bu reau of Land Management as an Area of Critical Environmental Concern. Additionally, he sets forth research objectives (acquiring data on chro nology, site formation processes, subsistence, and lithic procurement), and recounts field and analytic methods. Four subsequent chapters in clude discussions of: the 95 recovered artifacts of flaked and ground stone, clay, and shell (Chapter 4, by G. Laframboise, D. J. Scott, and B. Lewis); hydration measurements and geologic source ascriptions, mostly Coso Volcanic Field based on XRF analysis, for 32 obsidian speci mens (Chapter 5, by K. Moreland); temporal implications of projectile points, shell beads, and obsidian hydration measurements (Chapter 6, by S. Ptomey); and zooarchaeological analysis of</page><page sequence="4">294 JOURNAL OF CALIFORNIA AND GREAT BASIN ANTHROPOLOGY molluscan, fish, reptile, amphibian, bird, and mammal remains?an assemblage dominated by aquatic species (Chapter 7, by S. R. Jackson, M. Q. Sutton, and K. W. Gobalet). Chapter 8 (G. Clift, M. Q. Sutton, and E. G?bet) describes 31 artifacts and provides anthropomorphic data for 11 burials excavated by E. W. Gifford in 1926 at CA-KER-46, a small artificial mound used as a cemetery, but evidently not as a habitation site, "perhaps . . . repeatedly for several thousand years" (p. 87). Farther north, at CA-KER-2107?a small, dif fuse lithic scatter on the edge of old Goose Lake Slough near Lost Hills?evidence of extensive disturbance and recovery of 13 lithic flakes from a single test unit are reported in Chapter 9 by R. E. Parr and S. R. Jackson. In the next chapter, M. Peterson and G. Clift describe and analyze cultural and faunal remains from eight units excavated in 1977 by Robert Schiffman and his Bakersfield Community College field archaeol ogy class at CA-KER-511, -512, and -513 on Buena Vista Slough, south of Goose Lake. Each of these sites appears to represent transient occupation during late prehistoric or protohis toric times. One site, CA-KER-513, contained burned cow bones, perhaps indicating aboriginal use of cattle taken from a mission or other set tlement. Completing the monograph is a de scriptive summary by R. Novickas of 40 human bone fragments, representing at least five indi viduals, discovered in 1978 at CA-KER-2421 near the Buena Vista Slough, north of Goose Lake. The presence of "cloth" and hair with some of the burials, observed at the time of dis covery, may imply that the remains are of late prehistoric/protohistoric age and, therefore, pos sibly Yokuts. Although this set of papers achieves three of the four explicit research objectives (p. 28), the topic of site formation processes?as might be elucidated by geomorphology, archaeological stratification, and the definition and dating of geoarchaeological analytic units?is not ad dressed. Also conspicuous by absence are the description and analysis of lithic debitage, of which 3,380 pieces (97% of the artifact collec tion) were recovered, or any interpretive synthe sis of the work and findings at CA-KER-766. The critical reader will find in this monograph a lack of theoretical orientation and no general summary or conclusions, even for the set of re ports on CA-KER-766. None of the many tables or figures is listed in the Table of Contents; edit ing and proofreading are uneven; and the sepa rate reference listings for each chapter, instead of a single integrated bibliography, is distract ing. Nonetheless, there is much of archaeologi cal value in this collection of papers. In sum, Sutton and his colleagues and stu dents have published the first monograph on the archaeology of the Goose Lake locality. This report not only describes recent investigations by CSUB in this area but also makes available sub stantive data collected by others beginning in the 1920s. This information is especially valuable, since some of the sites have been destroyed and are no longer available for study. Moreover, the volume provides faunal analyses, assemblage descriptions, and obsidian data suitable for com parative studies, as well as an excellent environ mental overview that will benefit fiiture archaeo logical studies in the Goose Lake locality. Sutton and his associates are commended for their contributions to the prehistory of the Goose Lake and Fremont Valley areas, and for launch ing the Occasional Papers in Anthropology. This series reflects the growing influence of CSUB in south-central California archaeology, particularly in the upper San Joaqu?n Valley, adjacent mountains, and Mojave Desert. Sutton, together with Gerrit Fenenga and their students, is active in a previously neglected but archaeo logically important region. As this work con tinues, we look forward to the publication of additional volumes in the OPA series.</page></plain_text>
