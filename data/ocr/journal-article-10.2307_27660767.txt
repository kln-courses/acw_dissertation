<plain_text><page sequence="1">Knowing God1 Gabriel Daly To talk about God requires two basic states of mind and heart: the spirit of adoration and a lively sense of futility. The two go closely together and complement each other. 'If God does not exist then all is possible', said Dostoyevsky. But there is a converse proposition which might run: 'If God does exist, then not to adore him is an absurdity'; while to talk about him is always a presumption. We are therefore faced with an either/or. It requires courage to be either a real atheist or a real believer. This is why there are so many floating voters. The real atheist affirms the non-existence of God and sets about living bravely in the absurd flux of existence without ultimate meaning. He has to make his own meaning. If he fails, he will be hard put to it to avoid the psychiatrist's couch. If he succeeds, he will in a sense have made his own God, because God is meaning. To the believer God discloses himself as love, which is supreme meaning. The real believer affirms God and thus commits himself to a life of prayer and an unremitting search for the God he affirms. He would not be seeking God if he had not already found him. BLAISE PASCAL I want to turn for a moment to the man who made that last observation. Blaise Pascal has been shabbily treated by many of his fellow Christians. The predominantly Aristotelian cast of the Catholic mind from the 13th to the 20th century had little time for mystics, those men and women who saw too deeply to see clearly. It therefore excluded them by promotion. We were encouraged to admire them, from afar, but not to introduce their thought into theology. Blaise Pascal was that most fascinating of religious persons, a scientist who was also a mystic. As a mathematician of genius he constantly demonstrated the elegant clarity of his mind. Descartes (with the careless arrogance that philosophers can some times display) had said that a vacuum was repugnant to reason. 1. A paper given at the Maynooth Summer School on 26 June 1978. Gabriel Daly is an Augustinian priest of the Irish Province. Address: Good Counsel, Ballyboden. Dublin 16.</page><page sequence="2">KNOWING GOD 437 Pascal, as a good scientist, said that the only way to find out was to carry out an experiment. The question for him was not whether a vacuum was a priori possible but whether it did exist in certain circumstances. Philosophers have a way of muddying the waters of life. Instead of swimming they discuss the possibility and the conditions necessary for swimming. By the time they have finished, the water looks so uninviting that you don't want to swim anyway. Pascal was a scientist who proclaimed the limits as well as the autonomy of science. He distrusted the philosophers who prevailed in the Church because he considered many of them to be bad scientists and bad religious thinkers. They told scientists what could and could not be found in nature; and they told believers what could and could not be found about God. In both cases they were often proved wrong by the facts. At the age of thirty-one Pascal, already internationally famous as a scientist, an honoured member of French society and a celebrated commentator on many aspects of French life, underwent an experience which he came to regard as the most important event in his life. He describes it thus: 'The Year of Grace 1654. Monday, 23 November. . .. From about half past ten in the evening until half past midnight. Fire "God of Abraham, God of Isaac. God of Jacob", not of philosophers and scholars. Certainty, certainty, heartfelt, joy, peace. God of Jesus Christ.' The document just quoted is known as Pascal's Memorial, and he carried it with him wherever he went. It was the record of his conversion, not from a life of spectacular sin, but from a life of what he himself called 'worldliness' and what Bultmann would have called 'inauthenticity'. The terms which Pascal chooses to describe God are an index to what he saw as the crucial element in his conversion. Putting it a little brutally we might say that he was converted from the God of the philosophers and scholars to the God of Abraham. It was not a view of conversion likely to endear him to philosophers and scholars. Why should their God have been so peremptorily excluded? Nor was it the sort of remark calculated to win him a place in the text-books of Catholic spiritual theology. (French Neo-thomists used to refer to 'le funeste Pascal'). Might not the kind of distinction he was making very easily rend the seamless robe of the Catholic system, extending from the proof for God's existence right through to the powers exercised by the Roman Congregations? How could there be a difference between the God of philosophy, i.e., of 'natural</page><page sequence="3">438 THE FURROW reason', and the God of historic revelation? It is the same God, said the Catholic Aristotelians, only he is approached in a different manner, from a different standpoint. Natural reasoning procedures can lead me to the one true God. When, still by natural reason, I become convinced that God has revealed 'himself and the eternal decrees of his will', I exchange this natural knowledge for faith which gives me supernatural knowledge. At this point natural knowledge becomes largely superfluous except to appeal to whem I am trying to commend my faith to other would-be believers or to defend it against attack, or perhaps occasionally just to reassure myself and other believers in moments of 'difficulty' (believers were not allowed any 'doubts'). Pascal knew perfectly well that the God postulated by reason and the God embraced in faith are not too different Gods. What then was he trying to say by his distinction? The answer quite bluntly is that what Pascal was saying is that speculative reason can indeed point us to God, but its God is an object merely to be talked about. Philosophy can give us a God who exists ? but to what purpose? A century later Voltaire was to put forward the credo of his fellow deists: 'Believe in God but refuse to speak of his nature'. That was not what Pascal meant. (Voltaire disliked Pascal intensely.) Pascal's God is revealed through man's commitment to him; and Voltaire had no time for anything so vulgar and inelegant as commitment. Let there be a cool and dispassionate acknowledgement that there is a God, but keep him strictly uninvolved with his creation. 'God created man', said Voltaire, 'and man returned the compliment'. Just look, he says, at the God which Christianity has given us ? a God of war and bloodshed, a God in the service of whom Christians are prepared to butcher each other. Of course Voltaire can be answered. We all know Chesterton's remark about Christianity's not having failed but rather not having been tried. It is an answer of a kind; but it does not meet the full thrust of Voltaire's objection. When I say 'I believe in God', I can quite reasonably be asked to say what sort of God I believe in. There have been presentations of God put forward, even by Christians, which would make one glad to be an atheist. What kind of God? will always be an important, indeed the important, question. A practical conclusion from this observation can be utilized when someone says to us 'I don't believe in God'. A fair, and perhaps pastorally helpful, reply to this would be 'What kind of God do you not believe in?' PROBLEM AND MYSTERY Pascal's distinction is important to our context because it makes all the difference whether we are discussing God (1) as believers with</page><page sequence="4">KNOWING GOD 439 other believers, (2) as believers with non-believers, or (3) as a philosophical question in which belief is irrelevant. In the circum stances which have brought us together here in Maynooth it is reasonable to assume the first of these three categories: we are meeting as believers who want to ponder and discuss the mystery of Gpd while not overlooking the fact that there is also a problem of God. (I am here utilizing Gabriel Marcel's distinction between a problem and a mystery. A problem is a phenomenon viewed from the outside; a mystery is the same phenomenon lived in and viewed from the inside.)The existence of evil and suffering in the world can be made into a powerful argument against the existence of a good God. If someone withholds belief in God until he has found an answer to this argument, he is attempting to confront a problem. If he believes in, and says 'yes' to, God, then such problems as suffering become for him a mystery; but this does not make them less problematic or less scandalous. Faith in God makes it possible for the believer to accept that evil and suffering have an ultimate meaning even though he cannot say what that meaning is. A mystery is a problem of ultimate concern made habitable by faith. The problem remains; but instead of being employed as an argument against faith it is accepted with loving incomprehension. Faith does not enable the believer to give a rational justification of evil and suffering to a non-believer. Purely philosophical attempts to give evil a justification are usually unsatisfying, while purely pious ones are often insensitive and shallow. In no matter more than this is a wise and anguished silence the fittest response. Christian mysteries do not exist to be solved but to be lived in; and there is no way we can justify this stance by purely rational argument. This is where the scholastic distinction between faith and 'natural' knowledge was so seriously defective. It treated faith as additional knowledge provided by God on the strength of his revealing authority. Faith is not additional knowledge; it is a new perspective on the knowledge we already have. This is precisely the point that Pascal was making. On the night of Monday, 23 November 1654, he did not receive an additional quota of knowledge about God. He was enabled to see life and to approach God in a different way. The landscape of his mind remained unaltered; but it was now lit by a new light. He knew better than anyone that the piece of paper he carried around with him was not like one of his mathematical or mechanical papers, open to scientific or philosophical inspection and verification. It was the fragmented and haunting record of an experience which changed his life. This is why he made his famous distinction between the esprit g?om?trique and the esprit de finesse. The esprit de g?om?trie was his term to describe the working of the speculative, logical mind. He continued</page><page sequence="5">440 THE FURROW to have the highest regard for its competence in science and philosophy, but he proclaimed its impotence in matters of faith. In these matters it is the heart that counts; and the heart makes cognitive use not of the esprit de g?om?trie but of the esprit de finesse. 'We know the truth not only through our reason but also through our heart'. The heart has its reasons which remain incomprehensible to speculative reason. THE HEART'S REASONS The coeur of Pascal's argument has often been seriously misunder stood. It is not a flight into irrationalism. Still less is it pure sentiment. Least of all is it sentimentality or emotionalism. It is an intuitive faculty, not unlike Newman's 'illative sense', which functions in a different manner from the speculative intellect. Pascal is in the Augustinian tradition of redeemed pessimism. He bequeathed to French theology, spirituality, and even philosophy a concern with the fait int?rieur, the interiorly given fact. In a splendid phrase Laberthonni?re described Pascal as a 'positivist of interior reality'. He looked into himself and into human society and saw there a divided self which makes nonsense of the claim that God can be encompassed by the esprit g?om?trique. He also discovered a hunger for God which no amount of speculative reasoning would assuage. Pascal was supremely aware of the ambiguity of the verb 'to know'. He does not deny that God can be 'known' by philosophy or discursive reason; he simply observes that this use of 'know' is of no religious significance. Faith is 'God perceived by the heart, not by the reason'. It cannot be sufficiently emphasized that by 'heart' Pascal does not mean mere feeling, as his scholastic opponents often claimed. His ordre du coeur is a genuinely mental one, but it refers to the intuitive rather than the discursive use of the mind. When Pascal says that God is apprehended by the heart and not by the reason, he means that in the tilings of God the mind must be used in a particular mode. It must be allied to the affections and the will so that the whole personality if involved in the process. Now this is a point with which Catholics have been made generally familiar only since the Second Vatican Council. That was the council which brought Pascal, Newman and J. A. Moehler into the mainstream of Catholic thought. All three had existed previously only on its periphery. I have dwelt on Pascal because an awareness of what he was saying is particularly important in any discussion about God. To respond to God in faith is to embrace God, problems and all. Faith does not make it easier to speak about God, All the problems of 'God talk' remain even after one has made a profound and thorough submission of faith. This is why it is so important to distinguish faith</page><page sequence="6">KNOWING GOD 441 from theology and even from doctrine. We can listen and talk to God and still share in all the difficulties which contemporary man experiences in talking about God. Facing these difficulties honestly and fearlessly need be no threat to faith. On the contrary, faith is deepened by our willing acceptance of the asceticism involved in facing the challenges of our own age. The reflective believer has to wrestle with God and sometimes agonize over God's plan for the world we Uve in. He can do this and yet meet God just as profoundly as any believer did in previous ages which took God's existence virtually for granted and felt able to speak about him with confident clarity and without stress or strain. Once upon a time the Holy Spirit operated within this world-view where God seemed to be so easily found. There is no point in our trying to recapture the security of that world. Even if we were able to do so, we would not meet the Holy Spirit there; because the Holy Spirit, in pursuit of his own creative processes, has moved into the restless world of our time. God spoke to Job out of the whirlwind, and he is doing the same to us. The question of God has become an increasingly difficult one in the course of the last two centuries. The origins of the difficulty lie still further back, but the problem assumed critical proportions only nearer our own time. CHANGE OF WORLD-VIEW One very important reason for the rise of this problem is the change of world-view which has taken place since the scientific revolution. The classical, especially the Greek, world-view has been replaced by one based on science and technology. Many of the early formula tions of Christian belief depended greatly upon, and made much use of, Greek philosophical ideas. The trouble with philosophical ideas, however, is that they go in and out of fashion. The Bible, on the other hand, does not present a philosophical view of God. It speaks of God in a very human, even homely and anthropomorphic way. (This is one reason why the Bible rides out the ebb and flow of philosophical and cultural fashions.) Protestantism has always been less bound to philosophical positions than has Catholicism. Protestants were more alive to the changes which began to take place in the world in the centuries which followed the Reformation. They were less tied to the culture of the ancient world than was Catholicism with its heavy doctrinal investment in the culture of the past. Catholic theologians continued to emphasize the changelessness of Catholic truth, meaning by 'changeless' not merely the content but the mode of presentation. During the period in which Catholic doctrine had taken shape the world had, by our present-day standards, changed very little. To be sure, empires had risen and</page><page sequence="7">442 THE FURROW fallen, but this had not changed the world-view of either participants or onlookers. In the last four hundred years empires have continued to rise and fall; but something immensely more profound and far reaching in its consequences was also happening. The ancient world-view was rapidly corroding. Science and technology were making it impossible to go on placidly looking out on the world through classical spectacles. This change in world-view has had serious repercussions upon man's view of God, of himself and of the relationship between both. The God of Greek philosophy was eternal, omnipotent and, above all, unchangeable. But these abstractions, often made him seem very remote from the world of human experience. The world (and we have to remind ourselves that this meant the planet earth) was seen as a colony founded to serve as a theatre for man's redemption. Platonic exile became the Christian's vale of tears. The world was a place to be endured until death rescued one from it. When science revealed this redemptive colony as a speck of dust in an apparently infinite universe, it began to seem rather wasteful of God to have gone to so much cosmic trouble just to produce one little penal colony. Most serious of all, scientists were producing natural explanations for phenomena which were previously attributed to the direct intervention of God. The great early scientists, in particular Newton, made their own peculiar contribution to this regrettable state of affairs. Newton could explain the earth's passage around the sun by his laws of motion but he could not explain the earth's revolutions on its own axis, so he appealed to the finger of God. This deplorable procedure, as bad theologically as it was scientifically, had the curious result of making nature responsible for the seasons and God responsible for day and night. Laplace was a much better scientist and theologian when he told Napoleon that the reason why God did not figure in his astronomy text-books was that he did not need God as an hypothesis. Newton seemed to be the more religious of the two. But Newton's appeal was to 'the God of the gaps', i.e. the God to whom we appeal to fill the provisional gaps in our scientific knowledge. This procedure is of course the perfect recipe for eventual atheism. As science plugs more and more of the gaps, God is increasingly shut out of the world. We have come to realize that God is either in all nature or he is not in it at all. Good science and good theology get on perfectly well together. Bad science and/or bad theology will often come into conflict. When Gagarin announced that he had not found God in space, a Russian army officer was heard to say (presumably sottovoce): 'If he has not found him on earth, he won't find him in space'.</page><page sequence="8">KNOWING GOD 443 There are no cheap presences of God. God allowed himself to be found in past ages in ways which are no longer a truthful option for us. He is the same God; but man has changed. Primitive man could find God in a eclipse or a thunderstorm. We today can give a totally natural explanation of the eclipse and the thunderstorm. That should be a warning to us about the right and the wrong ways of seeking and finding God. God is in the eclipse and the storm, but no more so than in a fine summer's day or a starry night in winter. OUR IMAGE OF GOD When in 1962 the Bishop of Woolwich received banner headlines in The Observer saying that 'our image of God must go', many Christians were shocked, while others could not see what the fuss was about. Sixty years earlier a great Christian thinker, Fr George Tyrrell, preaching to the Catholic undergraduates in Oxford, had said 'Our best God is an idol'. What he meant was that we always approach God through the image we have of him. That image is not God but only a pale, and possibly distorted, representation of God. One of the functions of prayer and theology is to remind us constantly of this fact. It is a dangerous, indeed blasphemous, business to confuse our image of God with God himself. There is for us Christians only one reliable human image of God ? Jesus of Nazareth. And when you look at some of our devotional pictures and statues you can see what we have occasionally done with even that God-given image. The danger of images is not so much that they will be worshipped instead of the Being they represent; rather it is that they can so distort the Being they represent that they point not towards but away from him. Protestant iconoclasm has sometimes seemed to overlook the fact that mental images and philosophical constructions are no less liable to mislead than material images. The Judaeo-Christian tradition commands us to destroy idols. What the material inconoclasts have often failed to see is that the business begins in our own hearts and minds. No man can see the living God and live himself. Therefore God is always mediated to us through thoroughly human channels and vehicles. There is no short cut to God, no route which by-passes human experience. In speaking to us and in asking us to respond to him, God, as it were, accepts thatthe lines of communication will often be scrambled. Some believers will interpret his voice as a command to oppress their fellow men and women, always of course in his name. Others will claim to find him where he is not to be found; others again will fail to find him where he really is, because their ecclesiastical script says he shouldn't be there. God freely allows his message to enter the tangled and sin-stairfed world of human intellectual, social, and religious thought and</page><page sequence="9">444 THE FURROW communication. No wonder some theologians deeply concerned with the sovereignty of God have warned so strenuously about the dangers of religion. Religion can indeed become idolatrous when it is used to speak comfortably to Jerusalem when Jerusalem ought to be* experiencing acute discomfort, and to cry peace when there is no reason for peace. Religion can therefore expect to be subjected to the chastisement of personal and institutional insecurity. Is not this perhaps a constructive way of understanding, and coming to terms with, the difficulties which our age is experiencing in its attempts to think and speak about God? An age in which religion is now more ready to accept the autonomy of the secular, the free and mysterious character of faith and the relinquishing of political and social props, has to be prepared also to submit to the asceticism of an apparent withdrawal of God from the world he is creating. A few years ago the 'Death of God' theologians got a lot of mileage out of Nietzsche's Madman; but not content with declaring God to be dead, they made the fatal mistake of dispensing with the Madman too. They thus destroyed the only link between their spiritual malaise and the source of its healing. The Madman had said 'God is dead: you have killed him'. Altizer, Hamilton, and Van Buren proclaimed God's death but forgot that the death had taken place in circum stances which demanded a post-mortem. Executioners make bad coroners. God, being God, reads his obituary notice with the patience and amusement of one who has time on his side, since he made it. The twentieth century has seen a profound change in human awareness of nature and history. Physicists, once the leading practi tioners of a 'hard' empirical science, now find themselves in the realms of mystery, where empirical language, the language of one-to one description, can no longer do justice to their insights and intuitions. They now freely recognize that their own subjectivity is an integral part of the universe they are investigating and that there is no such thing as a detached observer who can stand outside the arena of his investigations. What a supreme irony it would be if physicists were to become the mystics of the future, while theologians were busy trimming their sails to a wind which has ceased to blow! TALKING ABOUT GOD All of which brings us back yet again to Pascal. The God of the philosophers and savants will always be a problem because of the unstable and fashion-ridden character of the means by which he must be approached. Such a God has to be talked about, and the very talking will always tend to rob him of his Godhead. 'If you have understood', said Augustine, 'then it is not God'. This was Karl Barth's great insight when he said that we don't talk about God</page><page sequence="10">KNOWING GOD 445 merely by talking about man in a loud voice. But Bultmann was more realistic when he described theology as sinful but necessary. We have to talk about God, says Bultmann, so that God may talk to us. Only let's do it in fear and trembling with the tax collector at the back of th? church. That is perhaps the lesson we are being painfully taught today. The only proper academic gown for theologians and catechists is sackcloth and ashes. God's willingness to inhabit our creeds and formularies, our sacraments and our institutions, is provisional upon our being prepared in our turn to let him be God and not to imagine that we can control him by even the most sacred of authoritative means or formulations. He is just as ready to inhabit our cultural and intellectual difficulties as he is to inhabit our creeds and sacraments. He became Abraham's God when Abraham was prepared to journey at his behest into the unknown. When Abraham's descendants found cultic security in the performance of their liturgies, and moral satisfaction in the observance of their taboos, the prophets arose to interpret their national misfortunes as a call to repentance. What am I to do with you, Ephraim? What am I to do with you, Judah? This love of yours is like a morning cloud, like the dew that quickly disappears. This is why I have torn them to pieces by the prophets, why I slaughter them with the words from my mouth, since what I want is love, not sacrifice; knowledge of God, not holocausts. (Hosea 6:4-6) In the past fifteen years or so we have become aware that something like the prophetic situation is abroad in the Church and world of our time. Our institutional security is gone and we are being summoned by a divinely-inspired disquiet into an unknown future. Once again God is recalling us to knowledge of him and to love. The felt sense of his absence and the difficulty we experience in thinking and speaking about him are our equivalents of the political and cultural setbacks of Ephraim and Judah. This, then, is not a time for the licking of wounds, for the counting of institutionalized heads or for flight to the past. It is a time for interpreting these difficulties and this disquiet as God's gracious summons into a humanly uncertain future. It is a time for rediscover ing what, for want of an agreed term, I can only call our mystical heritage. We have to exchange the cognitive clarities and artificially induced certainties of the past hundred years for something perhaps less clear and less systematically satisfying but more authentic and responsive to our real situation. If we find it more difficult to talk about God, to preach his word, to draw up satisfying theological and</page><page sequence="11">446 THE FURROW catechetical programmes, we have to understand that these straitened circumstances reflect not the death of God but his plan to be reborn in a more authentic way in human hearts and minds. It is my submission that our response to this divine initiative cannot be primarily or directly theological or philosophical. Theology is a reflec tion on the whole experience of faith; therefore we must undergo the experience before we are in a position to reflect on it, The experience, however, is a many-faceted one, and it comes to us from the real world in which we live, If this real world is troubled and insecure, then the trouble and insecurity must form part of our religious self awareness, Christianity can no longer serve as a refuge from the world's agonies and sinfulness. Instead, Christians must be able to find stillness, tranquillity, meaning and redemption in the eye of the world's storm. FRIEDRICH VON HUGEL Baron Friedrich von H?gel, one of the great Catholic masters of the twentieth century, gave much time, prayer, and theological reflection to the question of God and to the mode of God's contact, with man. By way of conclusion ? want to draw on the wisdom and spirituality of this great religious thinker, I know of no other Christian theologian who was so attentive to the spiritual implications of doing theology critically. He was both a biblical critic and a religious philosophy. He was also a man of deep and simple prayer. How he combined these two activities carries a great deal of interest and relevance for us today. In a letter to Wilfrid Ward, von H?gel wrote: Is it not this, that minds belong, roughly speaking, to two classes which may be called the mystical and the positive, and the scholastic and theoretical? The first of these would see all truth as a centre of intense light losing itself gradually in utter darkness; this centre would gradually extend, but the borders would ever remain fringes, they could never become clear-cut lines, Such a mind, when weary of border-work, would sink back upon its centre, its home of peace and light, and thence it would gain fresh conviction and courage to again face the twilight and the dark, Force it to commit itself absolutely to any border distinction, ?r force it to shift its home or to restrain its roamings, and you have done your best to endanger its faith and to ruin its happiness.2 These sentences go far to explain how von H?gel was able to engage in all the troubled questions of his age, including, especially, the question of God, and yet to retain the spirit of profound and quiet 2. Cited in M. Ware, The Wilfrid Wards and the Transition (London, 1936). p. 301.</page><page sequence="12">KNOWING GOD 447 prayer. Talk about God was for von H?gel 'border-work' carried oiit in darkness or, at best, in twilight. To talk to God one retires momentarily to the still centre of intense light, there to be refreshed and strengthened for the next foray into the outer darkness. Notice however that von H?gel makes it perfectly_plain that the reflective believer cannot remain indefinitely in the inner sanctuary. That would be a cheap grace. To rest in the God of Abraham one must wrestle with the God of philosophy. In the world to come all will be light, and the God of faith-inspired speculation will be finally merged in the God of light and peace, because faith and hope will be swallowed up in love. In the meantime, however, God must be sought and met in the realm of 'dim experience'. Von H?gel believed that the quest for 'deceptive clarities' paralyzed both faith and prayer. (This was of course a comment on the scholasticism of his period but it continues to have relevance in our own time.) 'Dimness' and 'richness' were the words he used to describe the mode of contact between God and man. Be as clear as you can in your conceptual analysis of what happens when God discloses himself to man, but do not project your conceptual clarity on to the event itself; for this is always indirect, dim and impressionistic. We have here, I believe, an interesting comment on a question much canvassed today when prayer, especially in its more enthusiastic forms, is very much to the fore. EXPERIENCING GOD? Do we 'experience God'? The whole Roman Catholic tradition of the past century or so would have answered that question with a resound ing 'no'. It smacked of 'Ontologism', and as every theology student knew, without necessarily understanding why, Ontologism was condemned. The word 'experience' was virtually banned from the Catholic vocabulary in 1907. Such an artificial - and draconian measure was bound to produce an eventual reaction. Once the reforms of Vatican II had begun to affect theolo|y and spirituality that reaction began to happen. It is now commonplace for Catholics to speak of experiencing God. There is I suggest, some danger here of over-reaction against the dry abstractions of scholasticism. There is a sense in which one can be rightly said to experience God; but there is also a sense in which the phrase could be seriously, and even dangerously, misleading. God's Spirit can break into human experience whenever and wherever he chooses, but the mode of his entry is always profoundly human. This was one of von HiigePs central insights. He warned against what he called 'a specifi cally distinct, self-sufficing, purely mystical mode of apprehending reality'. For von H?gel, mysticism is always incarnational: God has</page><page sequence="13">448 THE FURROW first descended the ladder which man must ascend. Von H?gel is therefore able to extend the term mysticism to cover the religious experiences of ordinary believers, thus freeing it from its exclusive application to specially favoured contemplative saints. We experience God, says von H?gel, in the 'sting of contingency', when we cease to be satisfied by the superficial delights or clarities of everyday life and thought. God comes to us, above all in Christ, through the contingent and the finite. Holiness is born of contact with concrete things. God is present in the realities of everyday life. He is present in the sense of incompleteness and disquiet we feel in even the noblest and best of human experiences. He comes to us as the horizon of life, always seemingly receding because always beckoning onwards. Von H?gel therefore postulates a 'theory of Spiritual Dynamics' for discerning the presence of God in human experience. 'Stop the machinery to look, and you must not expect to see it moving; there is no such thing as a science of statics for the living forces of the soul .. .'3 The experience is always fleeting. Von H?gel employs a haunting figure to describe our awareness of the infinite in daily life. It is like our awareness of 'a broad-stretching mist-covered lake, only on occasion of the leaping of some fish upon its surface and of this momentary splash accompanying the momentary glimpse of the shining silver'. Von H?gel was no starry eyed romantic. His analogy of the lake shrouded in mist makes a theological point of considerable importance and profundity. With fewer poetic overtones one might say that some things can be seen only with peripheral vision. As soon as you try to focus on them they disappear. This is a useful model for talking about God. God can be 'seen' at the edges of a pure-minded search for the truth of things and of a genuine care for the subjectivity of other people. It is only the peripheral character of our apprehension of God which makes the theology of God such a seemingly self-contradictory pursuit. Theology is a second-order, reflective, activity. It seeks focus, and rightly so. Therefore what it sees is not God but only man's varied responses to God. God himself always evades the focussed vision of ?systematic study. Once this truth is recognized, theology can not .merely analyse, but actually promote, the unthematized awareness of Ood which is prayer and which takes place in the darkness of faith. Discomfort, disquiet and an occasional sense of insecurity will be familiar spirits in the life of the reflective believer but they will have the beneficial effect of preventing our awareness of God from becoming a cheap grace. The theologian practises faith to some ?xteut by mortifying his desire for the kind of clarity which is the 3 a?* J. J. Kelly, 'Von H?gd on Authority', in The Tablet. 6 May 1978, p. 446.</page><page sequence="14">KNOWING GOD 449 proper aim of most academic pursuits. This clarity will consist in the recognition that many of the best things in life have a richness and depth which escape definition. If he refuses to allow himself to be academically embarrassed by the circumstances in which he must practise his craft, he may find that his colleagues in the 'harder' sciences will be more ready to listen to him than when he used language which pretended to the same standards of accurate reportage as theirs. If we learn to couple this intellectual asceticism with the heart-hunger which is only partly satisfied by the many beauties and the solaces of the world we live in, we shall have learned how to make nature, art, and theology serve the ends of prayer.</page></plain_text>
