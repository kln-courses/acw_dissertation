<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> DARWIN AND DEEP ECOLOGY CHRISTIAN DIEHM This essay explores connections between Charles Darwin’s thinking and  the writings of theorists in the deep ecology movement. It begins by plac- ing Darwin’s thought in the context of Western attempts to reject tele- ological descriptions of nature. It then shows that while some authors  cite Darwin’s naturalistic view of human origins as a positive contribu- tion to deep ecological thought, the fact that his work also helped elim- inate teleological explanations of natural phenomena is problematic for  non-anthropocentric environmental ethics. Because of this, the argument  is made that the significance of Darwin’s work for deep ecology theorists  is not simply that it views humans as a part of nature, but that it asserts  a basic continuity between humans and other living things. The essay  concludes by suggesting that an outlook grounded in a Darwinian sense  of continuity does not necessarily issue in a strictly bio-centric under- standing of nature’s value. Upon first encountering the writings of deep ecology theorists, people  are sometimes surprised to learn that, despite its moniker, deep ecology is  not a branch of the natural sciences. It is, rather, a branch of the environ- mental movement that was formally introduced to the English-speaking  world by Arne Naess in his essay “The Shallow and the Deep, Long-Range  Ecology Movement: A Summary” (Naess 1973). Naess’s goal in this ar- ticle was, as its title indicates, to contrast more conventional, “shallow”  approaches to environmental issues with a new and ostensibly “deeper”  perspective that some environmentalists had been expressing. He did not  intend, however, to suggest that this emerging perspective was directly  associated with or derived from the scientific study of natural systems.

Nevertheless, it is true that many deep ecology advocates have voiced  interest in the science of ecology. As Naess himself explained in his intro- ductory essay, scientific ecology has “suggested, inspired, and fortified” a  number of ideas about humans and nature that theorists of deep ecology  typically have been keen to promote (Naess 1973, 98). In light of this, it  is not surprising that the relevance of scientific ecology for thinkers in the  deep ecology movement has been widely discussed. The like relevance of  evolutionary biology, though, and specifically the work of Charles Dar- win, has not received such close attention. Thus while it has become fairly  clear that there is, so to speak, something “ecological” about the perspec- tives of various deep ecology supporters, it is less clear if there is anything  comparably “biological” about them. We are therefore led to ask: What  connection, if any, is there between Darwin and the philosophies of deep  ecology?1 This essay examines this question in detail. It begins with an extended  commentary situating Darwin’s work in the context of Western scientific  attempts to reject teleological accounts of nature. It then shows that while  some authors cite Darwin’s naturalistic view of human origins as a pos- itive contribution to deep ecological thought, the fact that his work also  helped eliminate teleological explanations of natural phenomena is prob- lematic for non-anthropocentric environmental ethics. Next, the writing  of Hans Jonas is enlisted to argue that the real significance of Darwin’s  thinking for deep ecology theorists is not simply that it establishes that  human beings are a part of nature, but that it asserts a basic continuity  between humans and other living things, the acknowledgment of which  can be regarded as vital to the development of non-instrumentalist envi- ronmental attitudes. The essay concludes by briefly considering the ques- tion of whether or not an environmental outlook rooted in a Darwinian  sense of continuity issues in a strictly bio-centric understanding of nature’s  value. FROM ARISTOTLE TO MECHANISM Darwin’s writings on the origins of species stand at the near end of  a long line of attempts by Western natural science to sever its ties with  Aristotle. Aristotle’s thinking about nature was thoroughly teleological,  and had as one of its central tenets the claim that certain kinds of motion  74 ETHICS &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT, 19(1) 2014 </page> <page sequence="3"> or change were the result of tendencies intrinsic to things themselves. In- deed, for Aristotle the term “nature” signified just such an inner impetus  to move or to act, and he used craftsmanship—that familiar human ac- tivity so clearly driven by desire and guided by purpose—as the starting  point for understanding everything from the movements of the material  elements toward their proper places in the cosmos, to the growth and  development of living things (Aristotle 1991b). It was this latter class of entities, however, that appeared to be most  in need of the sort of teleological explanation that Aristotle supplied. For  as he noted in his Physics, the only time that the generation of things with  complex, highly organized physical structures was observed to occur with  any regularity was when the generative process itself was informed by a  goal, or guided by some purpose. Thus it seemed quite impossible that  entities as structurally and functionally complex as living things could  come into being, time and time again, in the absence of some end or goal  actively informing their generation (Aristotle 1991b, Book II, chapter 8).  Aristotle therefore offered what many agreed was the only plausible ac- count of the matter, and argued that just as an artisan uses the knowledge  of her or his craft to orchestrate the manufacture of artificial things, so too  each organism has within it a “form” or immaterial soul that guides its  coming-into-being, a soul that both prescribes the end towards which its  growth and development are oriented, and spurs it to change, move and  act in ways that allow that end to be realized.2 Aristotle’s compelling, intuitive way of looking at the natural world  dominated the intellectual climate of the West for nearly two millennia.  Of course, long before Darwin there had been a number of challenges  to its scientific authority. Among these was Copernicus’s substitution of  a helio-centric model of the solar system for the older geo-centric one, a  substitution that plainly contradicted the prevailing wisdom regarding the  natural movements of the material elements.3 But it was not until the sev- enteenth century that one of the most serious blows to Aristotle’s physics  was leveled, and it came in the form of the new mechanistic philosophy  of nature. The hallmark of the mechanistic view as developed by thinkers like  Marin Mersenne, Rene Descartes, and Isaac Newton, was the idea that  the motion of matter had nothing to do with an impetus or tendency in- trinsic to matter itself. Instead, matter was regarded as inert, and whatever  movement it underwent was attributed to its having some external force  CHRISTIAN DIEHM DARWIN AND DEEP ECOLOGY 75 </page> <page sequence="4"> applied to it.4 Rejecting Aristotle’s claims about the inner motive powers  of the elements, the mechanists typically argued that a material body’s  movement was the effect of its being impacted by other material bodies,  bodies that could begin to move in the first place only by virtue of the  outside agency of God.5 In this way the universe came to be envisioned as  a vast machine, a realm of fundamentally lifeless particles that, once set  in motion by a divine craftsman, proceeded to generate nearly everything  one could encounter in the physical world. The mechanists did not stop, though, at dismantling the Aristotelian  view of elemental motion. They also sought to replace teleological expla- nations in biology with accounts that were more in keeping with the new  mechanical principles. Yet the study of living things raised two especially  challenging questions, and in neither case was there complete agreement  that simply referencing the machinations of matter would suffice as an- swers. The first question centered on the problem of how to explain the  basic operations of organisms, a problem that forced one to ask whether  or not the full range of biological phenomena—including those associated  with consciousness, thought, and the sphere of the mind—could be under- stood exclusively in terms of the causal interplay of material bodies. The  second question concerned life’s origins, a perennial problem no doubt,  but one made all the more perplexing by the immense difficulty of believ- ing that entities as intricate as living things could emerge, unaided, from  the otherwise lifeless material stuff of the cosmos. As one might suspect, different theorists addressed these questions  in different ways, but it was Descartes who set the tone for later debates  when he proposed answers that drew on his sharply dualistic conception  of mind and matter. Thus, in explanation of the operations and behaviors  of living things, Descartes argued that while non-human organisms could  properly be regarded as machines or “automata,” humans could not be  viewed in the same way, since their supposedly unique abilities of speech  and communication attested to the possession of an incorporeal mind  or soul that stood outside the mechanical order of things (1993, 32–33).  Moreover, in his account of the origins of organic life, Descartes made  a similar distinction between intelligent mind and mechanical matter,  claiming that although material causes could explain the generation of the  physical universe, they were insufficient to explain the appearance therein  of living things. Hence he suggested that the bodies of organisms had been  formed in an act of special creation by an intelligent deity, the same God  76 ETHICS &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT, 19(1) 2014 </page> <page sequence="5"> who, not coincidentally, had placed rational souls within human bodies  and first set the universe in motion (Descartes 1993, 26, 32; 2000, 35–42). The net effect of such answers to fundamental cosmological and bio- logical questions was that they allowed thinkers like Descartes to restrict  the notions of desire, planning, purpose and agency solely to humans  and to God. Though there was still room within dualistic mechanism for  teleological description of certain distinctively human activities, and for  speculation about the ultimate purposes for which God had created liv- ing things, the Aristotelian notion of “immanent teleology,” of purposive  activity emanating from within the natural world itself, was excluded en- tirely. By virtue of the presence of mind there could be purpose in what  humans did, and by virtue of the intelligent craftsmanship of God there  was a purpose for the existence of living things. In every other respect,  however, life was operating blindly. DARWIN AND CREATIONISM Creationist ideas about life’s origins remained highly influential in  scientific circles well into the nineteenth century. In fact, the belief that  species were in one way or another God’s creations was one of the princi- pal obstacles that Darwin had to overcome, and nowhere had this belief  been stated more convincingly than in William Paley’s Natural Theology.  First published in 1802, Natural Theology contains what is certainly the  most famous version of what has come to be called the “teleological argu- ment” for God’s existence, the “argument from design” that asserts that  the apparent design of things in nature is evidence for the existence of an  intelligent creator-God. What is sometimes forgotten in discussions of the  theological dimensions of this text, though, is that it is also written as a  scientific treatise, one with a line of argumentation rooted in the mecha- nistic natural philosophy. Natural Theology opens with the example of a man who finds a watch  and, noticing its complexity, is compelled to infer that a craftsperson pro- duced it with some end or purpose in mind. The comparison is then made  between the watch and the eye of an organism, the point being that the  intricate and functionally integrated structures of organisms, no less than  those of artifacts, require an inference to an intelligent designer (Paley  2006, chapters 1–3). In both cases, however, the inference is justified by  two key premises. The first is that, whether one is talking about artifacts  or organisms, material causes alone cannot account for the complex fea- CHRISTIAN DIEHM DARWIN AND DEEP ECOLOGY 77 </page> <page sequence="6"> tures that such things so evidently possess. The second is that there is  nothing in the natural world equivalent to an Aristotelian “nature” or  “principle of order” governing the generation of things. As Paley put it,  the man who finds the watch “never knew a watch made by the principle  of order nor can he even form to himself an idea of what is meant by  a principle of order distinct from the intelligence of the watch-maker”  (2006, 9). Therefore, since matter itself cannot explain the elaborate con- struction of organisms, and since planning and purpose are attributes of  mind and mind alone, Paley believed the only reasonable conclusion to  draw regarding the origins of living things was to say that they are prod- ucts of the creative intelligence of God.  For many years after it initially appeared, Natural Theology was  regarded as an important text, so it is not surprising that Darwin was  exposed to it while studying at Cambridge in the late 1820’s. In his auto- biography he recalls taking “much delight” in Paley’s work as he prepared  for his exams, and says that he was “charmed and convinced by the long  line of argumentation” that Natural Theology provided (Darwin 1958,  19). Nevertheless, the position that Darwin went on to develop ultimately  convinced him that both the teleological argument and the biological cre- ationism it entailed were incorrect. “The old argument from design in  Nature, as given by Paley,” Darwin later wrote, “which formerly seemed  to me so conclusive, fails, now that the law of natural selection has been  discovered” (1958, 63). The basic framework of the theory Darwin presented in On the Or- igin of Species is well known. In short, Darwin contended that since all  living things will at times have to compete for limited resources or “strug- gle for existence,” variations in their inherited traits will inevitably lead to  differences in their rates of survival and reproductive success. Beneficial  variations, then, will be passed from parents to offspring, and when this  cycle is repeated many times, certain variations will accumulate, causing  organisms to diverge from their remote ancestors. Thus identifying the  activity of “natural selection” as the means by which descent with modi- fication could occur, Darwin was able to conclude that organisms do not  just have, once and for all, the characteristics that they do, but instead  gain them in successive stages over long periods of time. He was able to  conclude, in other words, that organisms had not been created; they had  evolved (Darwin 1996). Contrary to what is sometimes assumed, this theory was not entirely  78 ETHICS &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT, 19(1) 2014 </page> <page sequence="7"> disagreeable to all of Darwin’s scientific peers, though often their open- ness to it was based on the belief that there remained within its broad out- lines room for talk of design. Yet Darwin insisted that the process he had  described was non-purposive at its two most critical points. On the one  hand, he thought that inherited variations did not come about in order to  benefit the organisms that received them, but rather arose “accidentally”  or by “chance.”6 On the other hand, he did not think that some type of  intelligence oversaw the selective process itself, acting either directly with  an eye to improving organisms, or indirectly by structuring natural laws  to guide evolution towards pre-ordained ends.7 Hence the term “natural  selection,” while clearly loaded with teleological connotations, was re- ally just a metaphor referring to the unplanned appearance of traits that  were either retained or eliminated from species’ lineages solely by virtue  of their ability, or lack thereof, to issue in reproductive success. Biological  complexity undoubtedly arose from relative simplicity, but the process by  which it did so was, in the end, aimless. To be sure, one of the more controversial implications of the position  just sketched is that humans, too, have wholly naturalistic origins, and as  one might imagine, this was an idea at which some of Darwin’s contem- poraries balked. Alfred Russel Wallace, for example, had independently  developed a theory nearly identical to Darwin’s, but was convinced that  the brain and associated mental, moral, and creative faculties of Homo sa- piens could not be accounted for by the action of natural selection alone.  Consequently, he claimed that intelligent design must have played some  part in the genesis of humans (Gould 1980). In The Descent of Man,  however, Darwin clearly stated his opinion that both the “mental powers”  and the “moral sense” of humans were products of the same evolutionary  process that shaped the rest of the living world.8 Rejecting appeals to de- sign or supernatural causes, as well as the residual dualism they implied,  he asserted that “the difference in mind between man and the higher an- imals, great as it is, is certainly one of degree and not of kind” (Darwin  1981, 105). Surely much more could be written here, but what we have said  suffices to show how Darwin’s work contributed to eliminating what  Francisco Ayala has called the “conceptual schizophrenia” of nineteenth  century science, a condition brought about by scientists’ steady commit- ment to describing nonliving nature in terms of material causes, while at  the same time enlisting entirely different sorts of causes to explain the  CHRISTIAN DIEHM DARWIN AND DEEP ECOLOGY 79 </page> <page sequence="8"> origins and structures of living things (2007, 8567). Evolutionary theory  eliminated the perceived need for teleological explanations in biology, and  even though its appearance did not immediately put an end to the search  for design in nature, it did at last lend intelligibility to the idea that all of  nature, animate as well as inanimate, could be understood in terms of the  non-purposive interactions of the physical stuff of the universe.9 It was in  this way, then, that Darwin helped Western natural science divest itself of  one of the last remaining vestiges of its Aristotelian heritage. In Ayala’s  words, “Darwin’s greatest contribution to science is that he completed the  Copernican revolution by drawing out for biology the notion of nature  as a system of matter in motion governed by natural laws” (2007, 5867). BELONGING TO NATURE AND THE DILEMMA WITH DARWIN Without question, evolutionary biology has had a profound impact  on contemporary thinking about the environment. However, as we turn  to examine the connections between the preceding and the work of theo- rists in the deep ecology movement, we would do well to recall what we  mentioned at the outset, which is that when these thinkers have looked to  the sciences, ordinarily the science to which they have looked has not been  biology. Rather, it has been ecology, and if we take a moment to consider  why this is the case, we will not only gain a better understanding of what  some theorists in the deep ecology movement are saying, but also a better  idea of where their thinking intersects with that of Darwin. Perhaps the best place to start this examination is to note that, in  accord with Naess, many deep ecology theorists contend that one of the  root causes of environmental problems is that we in the West have become  largely “alienated” from nature (Naess 1985, 261; 1995, 227), adopting  what Frederic Bender has characterized as “dysfunctional notions of self  and false ideas about humanity’s place in the order of things” (2003,  393).10 They contend, that is, that we have come to regard ourselves as  beings who are fundamentally disconnected from the natural world, on- tologically discrete entities who somehow stand outside and above bio- spheric or ecological realities. Of course, the trouble with this way of  thinking is not simply that it seems patently false metaphysically, but that  it can also be linked to a number of environmentally destructive attitudes  and behaviors, among which is a strongly instrumentalist or anthropo- centric value orientation. Hence, in part due to its conceptual inadequacy,  and in part due to its highly undesirable ethical implications, these deep  80 ETHICS &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT, 19(1) 2014 </page> <page sequence="9"> ecology supporters encourage us to replace this vision of ourselves with  one that is significantly environmentally-expanded, to develop our nar- row, alienated sense of “self” into a far more comprehensive ecological  “Self” (Naess 1995, 227).11 As a corrective to alienation, therefore, the development of our eco- logical Self involves recognizing the true extent to which we are a part of  the natural world—a recognition that deep ecology theorists usually claim  is the result of a process of “identification” with nature (Naess 1985).  Such identification, in turn, entails an existential affirmation of our em- beddedness in and belonging to the natural environment; it requires culti- vating a lived sense of ourselves not as discrete entities or substances, but  as beings whose very identity is a product of relationships to the more  encompassing natural world. As Warwick Fox succinctly expresses it, to  identify widely with nature is to come to a “deep-seated realization that  we and all other entities are aspects of a single unfolding reality” (1995,  252). Consequently, to achieve an ecological sense of Self via the process  of identification is to move away from the mistaken notion that human  beings are self-contained, isolated individuals, and towards an apprecia- tion of the ways in which we are intimately connected to the more-than- human natural world, members of biotic or ecological communities that  are constitutive of who and what we really are.  These points could be summarized by saying that many deep ecology  theorists have viewed reality in terms of an “interconnectedness thesis”  (Mathews 1994, 239), and given their over-arching interest in the met- aphysics of interconnection, it is not difficult to see why they would be  drawn to the science of ecology. As J. Baird Callicott explains, not only  has ecological science “made plain to us the fact that we are enfolded,  involved, and engaged within the living, terrestrial environment...” (1989,  101), but it has done so in a way that is as philosophically suggestive as  it is scientifically compelling. Ecologists regularly depict natural systems  as webs of trophic relations, interactive communities of life, or streams  of energy flowing in and between organisms, and all of these models  make some use of, and thereby lend some degree of scientific credibility  to, broader notions of interconnectedness, interdependence and the rela- tional character of things. Indeed, scientific ecology has emphasized these  themes so effectively that Bill Devall and George Sessions cite it as one of  the principal wellsprings of deep ecological attitudes in the West. “The  major contribution of the science of ecology to deep ecology,” they say  CHRISTIAN DIEHM DARWIN AND DEEP ECOLOGY 81 </page> <page sequence="10"> straightforwardly, “has been the rediscovery within the modern scientific  context that everything is connected to everything else” (Devall and Ses- sions 1985, 85). Thus deep ecology theorists have regarded ecology as significant in- sofar as it encourages identification with nature—specifically that form  of identification that I have referred to elsewhere as “identification-as-be- longing” (Diehm 2007)—and recognizing this leads back to Darwin, since  Darwin, too, is sometimes cited as one whose work encourages us to see  ourselves as part and product of the natural world. Sessions, for example,  counts Darwin among those scientists who, like contemporary ecologists,  have helped “to ‘decentralize’ humans from their preeminent centrality”  in the Western worldview (1988, 67). This is because Darwin rejected  the idea that we Homo sapiens have separate, super-natural origins, and  advocated instead a thoroughly naturalistic perspective, insisting in The  Descent of Man and elsewhere that we come about in the same ways as  every other living being. Hence Sessions and other deep ecology support- ers rightly believe that Darwin’s work points away from a conception  of ourselves as distinct, privileged entities, and towards a metaphysical  vision in which we are embedded within the more-than-human order of  things (Sessions 1988; Haq 2009). As Bender encapsulates it, “Darwin’s  greatest philosophical breakthrough” was “his reframing of humans as  thoroughly natural beings...” (2003, 94).  In addition to this interest in the naturalism of Darwin’s view of hu- mans, Bender also stresses the egalitarian or non-hierarchical conception  of organisms that he believes is conveyed by Darwin’s work. As Bender  explains, Darwin did not view human beings as “evolution’s apex or goal,”  and he clearly asserted that evolution “displays no telos towards humans”  (2003, 94). For this reason, Bender links Darwinism to what Naess and  other theorists of deep ecology have called “biospheric egalitarianism”  (Naess 1973, 95–96). On the evolutionary model, organisms “are neither  higher nor lower than, nor superior or inferior to, one another.” Rather,  every species “simply is what it is: a life form adapted to its ecospheric  niche and valuable to the extent it contributes to ecospheric integrity”  (Bender 2003, 94). Now, it is unquestionable that Darwin counted humans among the  natural kinds. The problem with leaving things at this, though, particu- larly for non-anthropocentric environmentalists, is that it glosses over  82 ETHICS &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT, 19(1) 2014 </page> <page sequence="11"> the fact that Darwin’s explanation of the origin of species was aimed at  overcoming what had been, to that point, one of the chief impediments  to developing a non-teleological, fully materialist natural science. Darwin  did situate Homo sapiens squarely in nature, yet it was a nature in relation  to which talk of striving, purpose, and planning was deemed out of place,  since even its most complex achievements could be accounted for without  them. It appears unremarkable, then, that the evolutionary process would  display, as Bender put it, “no telos towards humans.” With Darwin, finally,  nature displayed practically no teleology at all.12 Framing the issue this way, we may very well think that theorists like  Bender and Sessions would want to qualify their assessments of Darwin’s  great idea. For although the theory of evolution surely undercut argu- ments for human exceptionalism, it also assisted in purging from nature  notions of agency, desire, and purpose, a move that many eco-philoso- phers believe is aligned with attitudes of human arrogance, domination,  and control of the more-than-human world. Val Plumwood, for example,  contends that when nature is conceived in mechanical, non-agentic terms,  it “lies open to, indeed invites the imposition of human purposes and  treatment as an instrument for the achievement of human satisfactions”  (1993, 110). Likewise, Andrew McLaughlin says that the reductive mate- rialism of Western science has “created an image of nature that makes the  project of its domination appear to be a reasonable response to a mean- ingless reality” (1993, 99).13  It seems, therefore, that insofar as Darwin’s way of situating humans  in nature also participated in the project of situating nature outside the  sphere of purpose and agency, theorists of deep ecology would have, at  best, a somewhat ambivalent relation to his work. Still, despite the gen- uine tension here, I believe that if we step back to consider additional  aspects of both the position advanced by Naess and of Darwinism, we will  find not only that the difficulty we have highlighted can be resolved, but  that evolutionary theory itself can play a lead role in doing so. THE CONTINUITY OF KINDS At the outset, it should be observed that Naess does not always de- scribe alienation from nature as a matter of denying our connectedness  to the more-than-human world. On the contrary, in many places he char- acterizes alienation as a matter of seeing ourselves as fundamentally “un- CHRISTIAN DIEHM DARWIN AND DEEP ECOLOGY 83 </page> <page sequence="12"> like” or different from other-than-human entities, something that, like the  lack of a sense of belonging, can be a serious impediment to developing  morally sensitive environmental attitudes (Naess 1995, 227). The reason  for this, he suggests, is that regarding others as basically dissimilar from  ourselves inhibits our ability to make empathic connections with them,  which consequently also inhibits our ability to think of them in moral  terms similar to those that we apply to ourselves. Thus Naess holds that  being alienated from nature in this way leads both to instrumentalist  views of other-than-human beings, and to the careless, destructive behav- iors that those views can motivate (Naess 1985, 261–62; 1989, 171–73). In order to redress this situation, Naess again proposes that we “iden- tify” with nature, though in the present context this does not refer to  making an existential affirmation of our ecospheric belonging. It refers,  instead, to affirming the commonalities or similarities that exist between  ourselves and other-than-human beings. As he puts it, this form of identifi- cation involves experiences in which “we recognize something of ourselves  in the other creature, or something of the other creature in ourselves”  (Naess 2002, 114). Hence this second type of identification entails coming  to a deep-seated awareness that human and other-than-human beings are  alike in certain respects, an awareness that not only facilitates empathetic  and sympathetic responses to our other-than-human kin, but also fosters  the moral insights about intrinsic value that such ways of relating to them  afford.14 Usually, Naess is somewhat vague about what, exactly, is the com- monality that this “kinship identification” recognizes (Diehm 2007). The  suggestions he does make, however, are not hard to connect back to the  sorts of teleological notions we have been discussing. In “Identification as  a Source of Deep Ecological Attitudes,” for example, he says that we often  identify strongly with others when we witness their suffering, presumably  because this powerfully conveys to us that their lives, no less than our  own, are imbued with feeling and purpose (Naess 1985, 264). Similarly, in  Ecology, Community, and Lifestyle he describes a scene in which children  are killing insects with bug spray, but experience an “instance of momen- tary identification” when an adult points out to them that “those animals  might, like you, prefer to live rather than to die” (Naess 1989, 171–72).  Expressing an idea readers often encounter in his texts, Naess writes in  Life’s Philosophy that identification leads us “to regard other living crea- tures as genuine fellow creatures with a need for self-development” (2002,  115). 84 ETHICS &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT, 19(1) 2014 </page> <page sequence="13"> Comments like these illustrate Naess’s belief in the importance of rec- ognizing the subjective or agentic character of other-than-human entities,  and his related concern about over-exaggerating their differences from  ourselves to the point where we come to view them as mindless material  things lacking goals of their own. We have yet to see, however, what Dar- win might add to this conversation. In fact, given what was said above,  we might suspect that Darwin’s work would be more a bane than a boon  to Naess on this particular point. But evolutionary theory does have a  significant contribution to make here, and the writings of Hans Jonas help  us to understand just what it is. In Jonas’s remarkable text The Phenomenon of Life he notes that,  since natural philosophers like Descartes conceived of mind as wholly  discontinuous with material nature, they were able simply to set aside  the question of how the latter could produce the former. Indeed, the most  pressing question for dualists was not how matter engendered mind, but  how an immaterial mind could interact with something as foreign to and  fundamentally dissimilar from itself as physical matter (Jonas 1966, 53- 6). In the wake of Darwinism, though, such dualism became as scientifi- cally untenable as it had been metaphysically suspect: the human being in  its entirety was now to be viewed as a product of natural selection, which  meant that the human being as a whole had to be understood as contin- uous with the rest of biological nature. Hence, by showing that Homo  sapiens had its genesis not in an instant of creation but in natural history,  Darwin “made it...impossible to regard...mind, and mental phenomena  in general, as the abrupt intrusion of an ontologically alien principle in the  total stream of life” (Jonas 1996, 63). Darwin thus established “qualitative continuity” among living things  as the rule (Jonas 1996, 63), and in so doing presented a choice: either  extend the realm of mindless matter and eliminate even the seemingly tel- eological dimensions of human existence, or take the existence of purpose  and striving in humans as evidence of their presence in the larger biolog- ical order out of which humans had evolved (Jonas 1966, 37). Now the  first option, to be sure, has always been regarded as problematic insofar as  it requires denying some of the most salient features of human self-experi- ence. The latter option, on the other hand, had traditionally resulted in the  charge of “anthropomorphism.” Yet overweening concern about anthro- pomorphism was itself largely a product of the same dualism that evolu- tion had supplanted; it made sense only on the presumption of a radical  CHRISTIAN DIEHM DARWIN AND DEEP ECOLOGY 85 </page> <page sequence="14"> discontinuity between mindful humans and mindless nature. In mending  this split, evolutionary theory tacitly readmitted what Jonas aptly calls the  “evidence of common sense” (1996, 63). That is, it lent credibility to what  many had suspected all along, which was that the sphere of mind—with  its associated capacities of feeling, desire, striving and purpose—could  not be denied, in varying forms, all throughout the branching tree of life.  As Jonas puts it, with evolutionary theory “the province of ‘soul,’ with  feeling, striving, suffering, enjoyment, extended again, by the principle of  continuous gradation, from man over the kingdom of life” (1966, 57).15 Of course, that evolutionary theory could operate in this way is, as  Jonas reminds us, “in opposition to the theory’s own tenor” (1996, 63),  since its scientific success was due in large part to its ability “to credit  the automatism of material nature with the generation of the branching  and ascending life forms” (1966, 53). Nonetheless, in speaking against  human-nature dualism and for human-nature continuity, Darwin’s work  ultimately supports, and even encourages, our native sensibilities about  the “mindfulness,” conation, and purposive character of other-than-hu- man beings.16 Truly, it is not too much to say that an understanding of  the continuity between human and other-than-human life forms is funda- mental to the Darwinian world-view, and that evolutionary biology there- fore represents one of the major intellectual forces in the West capable of  fostering the kinship-identification that Naess considers essential to the  development of non-anthropocentric environmental attitudes. Accordingly, Jonas’s commentary puts us in a position to see that Dar- win’s work is indeed able to contribute to deep ecological thought, even if,  as we have already said, this is not simply because it confirms that humans  are a part of nature. Its contribution lies, rather, in the fact that by virtue  of its insistence that we belong to nature, it validates a basic sense of kin- ship between ourselves and others who are other-than-human—a sensibil- ity that runs counter to the material reductivism that, perhaps ironically,  Darwin himself helped to advance, and that characterizes much of the  modern scientific enterprise. CONCLUDING REMARKS With this, we have reached the end of our inquiry. We began by asking  what connections there might be between Darwin’s thinking and that of  theorists in the deep ecology movement. To that end we have argued that  evolutionary biology, like scientific ecology, surely can serve to suggest,  86 ETHICS &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT, 19(1) 2014 </page> <page sequence="15"> inspire, and fortify some of the core ethical and ontological ideas that  deep ecology theorists have promoted. More precisely, we have shown  that Darwinism’s potential to contribute to the development of deep eco- logical attitudes does not lie solely in the stress that it places on humans  belonging to nature, but also in its related emphasis on human continuity  with our other-than-human kin. One of the more provocative questions that this conclusion raises,  however, has to do with exactly what type of environmental outlook such  a comprehension of kinship might motivate. If identification is, as Naess  contends, a “source of belief in intrinsic values” (1985, 259), then what  environmental value orientations are supported by an evolutionary sense  of “qualitative continuity”? The most likely answer, it seems, would be  some form of “bio-centrism,” a kind of “reverence for life,” since affirming  the relatedness of living things would presumably result in one’s placing  moral focus on just that: living things. But is this the only, or the fullest  response one can give to this question? Could an existential acknowledg- ment of biological kinship and shared origins somehow result in height- ened respect for more than just what is living?17 While a complete examination of this issue cannot be provided here,  it is fitting to bring our discussion to a close with a brief comment on it,  and to do so we can again take our cue from Jonas. As we have seen, Jonas  accepts that evolutionary processes produced Homo sapiens. He also ac- cepts that, at some point in the earth’s history, life emerged from abiotic  matter, and in his estimation all of this is occasion to re-consider not only  how we conceive of living things, but how we regard the physical stuff of  the universe as well. As he explained in an interview conducted near the  end of his life: My own conjecture is that everywhere within the depths of matter  there is a kind of waiting for the opportunity to also unfold the po- tentiality for life.... [T]he fact that [this] opportunity...opens itself has  been demonstrated here on earth, and there is no reason to assume  that it is not something for which there is original readiness in the  nature of substance itself, in the nature of matter itself, but in that  case matter is not merely that which physical science confines itself  to describing. It has, from the beginning, something more to it than  what is necessary for its description as long as life is not there. But  it must have this something more so that, given the opportunity, life  will come forth from matter, and with life will open up a dimension  of subjectivity. (Scodel 2003, 356) CHRISTIAN DIEHM DARWIN AND DEEP ECOLOGY 87 </page> <page sequence="16"> Certainly, Jonas’s use of the word “conjecture” cautions us not to make  too much of this statement. Yet even a cautious reading shows that, for  Jonas, the fact that matter is related to life and to subjectivity suggests that  it is “something more” than physics describes. Matter, as the foundation  on which the realities of organic existence are built, is no mere mechanical  stuff. It appears, instead, to be the bearer of a creative nisus or tendency  towards life. Interestingly enough, Jonas is not alone in pursuing a line of thought  like this. Holmes Rolston, for one, suggests in several places that our ideas  about matter-energy and the characteristics of the physical universe may  need to be updated in light of the two “big bangs” of life and mind (2010;  2006). Even more directly to the point, Pierre Teilhard de Chardin asserts  unequivocally in The Phenomenon of Man that re-thinking the nature of  matter is positively required by a scientific view of life and an evolutionary  understanding of human origins. “Taken at its lowest point,” he writes,  “...primitive matter is something more than the particulate swarming so  marvelously described by modern physics. Beneath this mechanical layer  we must think of a ‘biological’ layer that is attenuated to the uttermost,  but yet is absolutely necessary to explain the cosmos in succeeding ages”  (Chardin 1961, 56–57). Assuredly, these very preliminary remarks do not allow us to start  drawing any firm conclusions on this subject. Yet they do at least leave  open the possibility that, beyond biology, the implications of evolutionary  theory extend to our ways of conceiving of material nature, the stuff from  which life has come and of which we and all our living kin are made. It  may be, therefore, that a deep affirmation of evolutionary kinship really  does urge something more than a strictly bio-centric ethical orientation,  or a respect only for that which is biologically alive. If so, then we could  say, borrowing from Darwin and in the spirit of so many supporters of the  deep ecology movement, that there is more “grandeur in this view of life”  than even Darwin himself imagined (1996, 396). NOTES  1 Commentators usually point out that the term “deep ecology” refers to a  branch of the environmental movement, and not to any particular environ- mental philosophy. For this reason, most writers distinguish between deep  ecology as a philosophically pluralistic social and political movement, and the  individual “ecosophies,” or eco-philosophies, of various thinkers. Through- 88 ETHICS &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT, 19(1) 2014 </page> <page sequence="17"> out this essay, I have attempted to use terminology that maintains this dis- tinction, acknowledging both that there are diverse theorists who identify  themselves as deep ecology supporters, and also that there is some conceptual  convergence among their views.  2 See Aristotle 1991b, Book II, chapters 1–3; Aristotle 1991a, Book II, chapters  1–4.  3 Concise discussions of this topic are found in Henry 2001 and Dingle 1959.  4 The historical development of this viewpoint is described succinctly in  Mathews 1991, chapter 1, “Atomism and Its Ideological Implications.”  5 As Carolyn Merchant points out, not all mechanists resorted to God to ac- count for the initial motion of matter. Pierre Gassendi, for example, held a  view of material motion much more like Lucretius and other early atomists,  who saw movement as intrinsic to matter (Merchant 1983, chapter 8, “The  Mechanical Order”).  6 For discussion of this notion in Darwin’s thought, see Gillespie 1979, chap- ter 6, “Variation and the Problem of Design.”  7 Quite the opposite, Darwin felt that postulating such an intelligence was, at  best, unnecessary, and at worst, an affront to the scientific adequacy of his  theory. As he wrote to Charles Lyell shortly after On the Origin of Species  was published: “I entirely reject as in my judgment quite unnecessary any  subsequent addition ‘of new powers, &amp; attributes &amp; forces’; or of any ‘prin- ciple of improvement,’ except in so far as every character which is naturally  selected or preserved is in some way an advantage.... If I were convinced that  I required such additions to the theory of natural selection, I would reject it as  rubbish.... I would give absolutely nothing for [the] theory of nat[ural] selec- tion, if it require miraculous additions at any one stage of descent” (Darwin  1991, 343).  8 Chapter II of Darwin 1981 contains Darwin’s analysis of “mental powers,”  and chapter III provides his discussion of “moral sense.”  9 The significance of this was not lost on Darwin himself, who appears to have  struggled personally to come to grips with the notion of a purposeless natu- ral world. In The Descent of Man he acknowledged the great difficulty that  people had in accepting non-teleological explanations of biological events,  writing that “[t]he birth both of the species and of the individual are equally  parts of that grand sequence of events, which our minds refuse to accept as  the result of blind chance. The understanding revolts at such a conclusion...”  (Darwin 1981, 396). Years earlier, in a letter to botanist Asa Gray dated May  22, 1860, he explained his belief that there was no design in nature, but im- mediately followed his comments with the remark that “On the other hand I  cannot anyhow be contented to view this wonderful universe and especially  the nature of man, &amp; to conclude that everything is the result of brute force”  (Darwin 1993, 224). In another letter to Gray dated July 3, 1860, he ex- CHRISTIAN DIEHM DARWIN AND DEEP ECOLOGY 89 </page> <page sequence="18"> pressed the same point, writing that “If the death of neither man or gnat are  designed, I see no good reason to believe that their first birth or production  should be necessarily designed. Yet as I said before, I cannot persuade myself  that electricity acts, that the tree grows, that man aspires to the loftiest con- ceptions all from blind, brute force.” He signed this letter “Your muddled and  affectionate friend, Ch. Darwin” (Darwin 1993, 275).  10 It should be reiterated here that these remarks are not about the deep ecology  movement (i.e. the social and political movement outlined in the eight-point  platform of deep ecology), but about aspects of the eco-philosophies of some  of the theorists who have voiced support of it.  11 Though Naess himself does not always do so, many commentators distin- guish between the more narrow, individualistic sense of self and the wider,  more expansive sense of Self that Naess promotes by capitalizing the “S”  when referring to the latter. In what follows I have followed this convention.  12 As is well-known, near the end of On the Origin of Species Darwin makes  some suggestive remarks about the role that God may have played in creating  the original life forms from which all other species have evolved. See Darwin  1996, 391, 396.  13 In her oft-cited formulation of this idea, Merchant claims that the historical  rise of mechanism signaled “the death of nature,” rendering it “effectively  dead, inert, and manipulable from without” (1983, 214). It should be men- tioned that it is probably not an accident that many thinkers who convey  this idea focus on the ways in which mechanism stripped nature of purpose  and agency, and not on how Darwin’s work may have done so. Arguably, the  mechanistic contribution to this view of nature is more substantial than is  Darwin’s, yet as we have shown in the second section of this essay, Darwin’s  thinking has played an important role here as well.  14 For more detailed discussion of this point, see Diehm 2007, section IV.  15 Summarizing this same cluster of ideas, McLaughlin writes that “evolution  provides a single framework for understanding humanity and the rest of na- ture” (1993, 148), and that because of this more unitary framework we are  able to “remain faithful to our own experience of ourselves as centers of  action, and we can, in our approach to the rest of nature, be open to the ex- istence of other comparable centers of experience and agency” (1993,149).   16 For discussion of the historical import for the natural sciences of the evolu- tionary notion of continuity, see Rollin 1989, chapter 2.  17 I should emphasize here that I am not trying to address the very broad ques- tion of how evolutionary biology in general, or Darwin’s work in particular,  can be used in the context of environmental ethics. I am addressing the much  more narrow question of whether or not the sort of kinship-identification  that Naess describes, taken in conjunction with the evolutionary emphasis  on the relatedness of living things, necessarily results in an outlook that is  focused only on living things. That evolutionary biology can be used in ways  90 ETHICS &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT, 19(1) 2014 </page> <page sequence="19"> that outstrip this discussion is, I think, beyond question.
