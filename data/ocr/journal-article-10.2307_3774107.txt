<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE USE OF HUMAN IMAGES ^ IN YORUBA MEDICINES1 4k Norma H. Wolff B Iowa State University Indigenous healers among the Yoruba of southwestern Nigeria regularly utilize small carved and molded three-dimensional human figures in their medicines. These fwlgures are used by individuals in purposeful acts of magical mimesis to manipulate the social world. Four major types of Yoruba medicine fwlgures act as surrogates, messengers, and the Yoruba everyman/woman to activate forces affecting individual lives. (Nigeria, Yoruba, medicine, art, magic) The centrality of the human body to cultural thought makes it a powerful mimetic referent that zmediates all reflection and action upon the worldX (Lock 1993). This is clearly seen in indigenous medical systems throughout the world where the unseeable powers of nature are anthropomorphized in the form of two- and three- dimensional human figures used as ingredients in magical medicines, charms, and amulets.2 Usually discussed in terms of sympathetic magic, the figures act to direct or store these powers for a variety of positive and negative purposes. In replication of the human form as artifact, supernatural powers are encapsulated and controlled to be brought into the cultural realm where they can be manipulated to benef1t individuals or groups. In the tradition described here, the Yoruba of southwestern Nigeria carve and mold human images as part of their technology of indigenous medicine in a system in which both natural and supernatural causation are recognized. Medicine figures3 in the shape of the human body are one type of the many essential ingredients, natural and artifactual? used by Yoruba medical practitioners to diagnoses cure, protect from, and, in some cases, cause illness and misfortune. THE NATURE OF MEDICINE FIGURES Medicine f1gures are commonly used by practitioners in those medical systems that have strong elements of what Foster (1976) labels the personalistic.- In a personalistic medical system illness and misfortune can be caused by the purposeful manipulation of supernatural powers so that the religious and medical systems are intermeshed. A deity, a human witch or sorcerer, or a nonhuman agent such as an evil spirit, ghost, or ancestor can use powers beyond those of everyday experience to harm living human beings or control their behavior. Conversely, the same powers can be protective and assure success in life to those who possess them. The medical practitioner in a personalistic system, whether healer or sorcerer, is an agent who is knowledgeable in culturally determined rules of procedure that can be used to control supernatural powers to bring about predetermined effects for self or client. The assumption is that these forces are part of a coherent interconnected universe in 205 ETHNOLOGY vol. 39 no. 3, Summer 2000, pp. 205-24.

Sorcery, Stevens (1996:724) suggests, is an attempt to interfere with the course of natural forces and cause them to act contrary to their 'inatural program." It is important to note that Stevens ( 1996:723) conceptually separates the forces of nature that can be magically programmed for a specific action from the powers of the anthropomorphized deities, ancestors, ghosts, and spiritual heings who also inhabit the universe. Medical practitioners in personalistic systems are skilled in controlling natural forces, and some also can capture the services of spirits. Among the many ingredients utilized in the preparation of medicines in a specialist's repertoire are human images molded c)r carved from natural materials and used as conduits to channel the powers of nature toward cultural goals in acts of zmagical mimesis . ' Mimesis, according to Taussig ( 1992: 1 1), involves "both copy and substantial connection, hoth visual replication and material transfer." Magical mimesis Taussig (1992, 1993) proposes, involves products of human intent that portray something over which the maker desires power. When linked to artistic production, Taussig (1992:11) argues, magic, in its ability to mimic and control, has the ;'stupendous ability to blend aesthetics with practicality." Magical mimesis is used anot only to express but to manipulate reality by means of its image" through the act of replicatlon (Taussig 1993:57). This process is clearly seen in the act of fashioning human images tO tFocus and direct unseen but controllable powers to affect specific living persons for good or evil motives (Taussig 1993:13). In a discussion of the medical practices of the Cuna of Panama, where woodcarved flgures are used in curing ceremonies, Taussig (1993:16) suggests that the medicine figures illustrate "the magical power of replication' to capture and create power by making an "ilnage-ful partlcularity.' Taussig presents his study of Cuna medicine figures tO show how, with Cuna acts of magic, 'the image affect[sl what it is an image of, wherein the representation shares in or takes power from the represented' (Taussig 1993:2). Having established the link between power and image, Taussig (1993:8-9) goes on to pose three basic questions: 1) how do such Elgures function in medical practices 2) why carve such forms when the Cuna claim the power is in the wood itself, and 3) why is embodiment necessary? Posing questions about the use and lorms of Cuna medicine HIgures provides an approach for exploring why the embodiment of the human image is practiced in the magical medicines of many cultures. MEDICINE FIGURES IN AFRICAN CONTEXT Three-dimensional human images used ln sub-Saharan African medicines are usually carved of wood, bone. lvory, or molded from clay. These artifacts, part of the technology of indigenous medical systems, have been examined primarily as works of art by anthropologists and art historians who are concerned with their function and aesthetic qualities. Considered as art, medicine figures are created with</page><page sequence="3">THE USE OF HUMAN IMAGES IN YORUBA MEDICINES 207 special skill in a recognizable ethnic style and have a culturally significant meaning. They have the ability to stimulate the senses and affect the emotionsv even though the practical ends that such flgures serve may override considerations of aesthetics. As technology medicine figures are part of the tool kit of indigenous medicine. Africanist art historian Rubin (1989: 17) has argued that all art be examined as part of the Ztechnology of belief,- those zsystems of tools and techniques by means of which people relate to their environment and secure their survival.t As tools, art forms allow interaction with environmental and universal forces, making the intangible concrete, and communicating information about spiritual energies or beings (Rubin 1989:17). African sculpture in terms of the technology of belief, has two major filnctions: display and power. Display refers to public presentations of art in religious and political contexts where it serves to enhance the reputation of sponsoring individuals or groups by presenting a zvisible, tangible resolution of psychic vigor and strengthX (Rubin 1989:20). As such, display objects tend to be highly symbolic and their message is multivocal. Power refers to the instrumental role that art objects can play in channeling intangible supernatural forces for the benefit of individuals or the community (Rubin 1989:20). While many ritual art objectss such as masks and shrine sculpture, combine the qualities of display and power medicine figures function primarily as power objects. Most are not publicly displayed but are secretly made and activated. Created through acts of magical mimesis they function to call forth and channel supernatural forces for the beneElt of their owners. In their mediating function to link the supernatural and the cultural world, medicine filgures can be described as "transformers" that tap into the ahidden order and structure of the universeX (Rubin 1989:49). For making medicines, all of the natural world is a source of power. Practitioners incorporate plant and animal parts and other natural objects, as well as artifacts, in varying combinations to draw upon the unique powers of each. The parts of plants and animals used tend to be Zsignature elementsX (Rubin 1989:20). These include the leaves and roots of plants, and in the case of animals the distinctive survival equipment which characterizes each: for birds, their beaks, talonss or feathers; for the various types of antelopes, their horns; for snails or tortoises their shells, and so on. Imitations in carved wood or other materials may, it seems, also serve. (Rubin 1989:20) The crafted human figures used in medicines are, of course more than imitations; they are transformers that embody and channel the powers of the natural materials from which they are fashioned. In other words, the creation of the medicine figure is an act of embodiment with the intention of concentrating powers of nature for social goals. Most medicine figures must be further empowered before they fulElll their instrumental function, either through putting them in contact with additional magical ingredients and/or by having powers called into them through sacrifice and incantations. The act of empowerment can change the form of the figure or even totally conceal it. ';Accumulative sculpture, where the form created by the artist is</page><page sequence="4">208 ETHNOLOGY hidden under layers of natural and artifactual materials that serve to enhance its power, is common in the African context (Rubin 1975). For example, among the Dogon in the Western Sudan, "sacrificial patinaX resulting from the residue of periodic sacrifices can with time totally obscure the form of ancestral shrine figures but add immeasurably to their power (e.g., Laude 1973:pls. 8, 22, 56). Alternative- ly, a power object may be treated with incantations and put into contact with power sources that do not affect its surface, so that the form itself appears benign. In sub-Saharan Africa one of the best-documented traditions of the medical use of human images as power objects is that of the Kongo of the lower Zaire River. Kongo medical practitioners make minlcisi Elgures with magical ingredients inserted into the wood or applied as thick mantles to the surfaces. Carved in human form, minkisi (sing. nkisi) can be charged with positive curative or protective forces, or conversely with destructive powers to bring misfortune or disaster to enemies (e.g. MacGaffey and Harris 1993). Another well-documented tradition from the Togo- Benin area of the Guinea Coast of West Africa involves medicine f1gures called bocio (from the Fon bos empowered, and cio, cadaver). These are - instruments of empowerment that both directly and indirectly influence community and societal relationshipsX (Blier 1995:5). Less well known is the figurative sculpture that serves a similar function in the medicines of the Yoruba further to the east on the Guinea Coast. THE USE OF HUMAN IMAGES IN YORUBA MEDICINES In the larger inventory of Yoruba sculpture in which the human H1gure is the leitmotif, the carved and modeled human images used in indigenous medicines form a small and obscure category. In a wide range of sculptural types, Yoruba artists deal with the human themes of fecundity, productivity, youth, health, wealth, and power in single and group sculptures that portray everyday and important ritual activities. This preoccupation with the human image is indicative of a H1xation that permeates Yoruba philosophy and ideology. Buckley (1985a:55), who has worked intensively on the philosophical underpinnings of Yoruba medicines, states, The human body may be regarded as an expression of some of the most fundamental categories of Yoruba thought It is at once both the most familiar of all the objects known to man, and yet it is the most mysterious, containing a complexity of which we can only be dimly aware. While a huge body of literature deals with the richness of the Yoruba sculptural arts, medicine Elgures have been ignored in discussions of both Yoruba art and medicine. There are several reasons for this neglect. The very richness of the Yoruba art tradition mediates against their recognition. When such Elgures appear in Western art collections (a rare event), they do not tend to be identiEled for what they are. As sculpture, they lack outstanding iconographic features so thats when carved from wood, they are often mistaken for miniature or full-sized ere ibefi ritual twin figures that are the most common form in the Yoruba woodcarving repertoire. The aesthetic</page><page sequence="5">THE USE OF HUMAN IMAGES IN YORUBA MEDICINES 209 bias of Western collectors provides another reason medicine Elgures receive little attention. Medicine figures are oiFten crudely executed by nonartists, and so do not attract the eye of collectors. Finally, medicine figures are seldom seen. They are comparatively rare as ingredients in Yoruba medicines and tend to be used in the most secretive types with formulas and contents that are closely guarded secrets of healers and sorcerers. As a product of this esoteric knowledge that grants power over others, medicine flgures are not a public art. They are usually hidden, discarded, or destroyed in the ritual process. Even when incorporated in medicine charms (onde) that are worn or used in public contexts, the f1gures are commonly concealed in leather- or cloth-covered bundles. As power objects, medicine figures are difierentiated from sculpture used in display contexts by the labels applied. Images used in shrines and religious ceremonies are referred to as ere. For example, ere Sango or ere Osun are carvings that decorate the shrines of the god of thunder and lightning and the goddess of the River Osun, respectively. As discussed by Adepegba (1983), ere sculptures have all the characteristics of display objects. Ere are created with aesthetic intent to serve as a form of adornment, oriented toward the enhancement of the prestige of the votaries, the deities with their surroundings and the activities put up in their honourX (Adepegba 1983:21). When used on a shrine, ere sculpture normally depicts worshipers of the deity carrying emblems of that god. The sculpture functions to add to the efficacy of the shrine by providing tangible proof of worshipers' devotion (Drewal, Pemberton, and Abiodun 1989:230-31). Ere are not objects of worship in themselves, nor are they even necessary to the worship of the Yoruba deities (orisa). Rather, they are optional paraphernalia that act to excite the admiration and appreciation of an audience of worshipers (Adepegba 1983:19-20). The display function is paramount, and they are often subject to indigenous aesthetic evaluation and criticism (Thompson 1973; Lawal 1974). In some cases, ere sculptures are thought of as a focal point to which invocations and ritual actions are directed a "faceb to alert the deity to the supplicant's request (Drewal, Pemberton, and Abiodun 1989:230; Lawal 1985:101). In addition, a few categories of ere are created with ritual process to make them function as power objects so that they can act as direct channels of communication to a supernatural entity. For example, an ere ibeji is carved at the death of a twin infant to contain and control the potentially dangerous special spirit of the twin. Throughout the carving process, beginning with the selection of the living ire tree that supplies the wood, the carver draws upon his secret knowledge of proper sacriElces and incantations to empower the carving. When the ere ibeji leaves the hands of the carver, it is imbued with iluti (the ability to hear and respond) so that it can function to transmit the supplications of the living to the indwelling twin spirit. The figures are placed on household shrines and receive daily ritual attention and act as both display and power objects. Medicine figures do not function in the same way and are not included in the category of ereO They are not public objects, and are not openly displayed on shrines. Rather, as part of the technology of the Yoruba medical system, they are strictly</page><page sequence="6">2 10 ETHNOLOGY power objects used in oogan, a variety of techniques and materials that draw upon supernatural forces for healing as well as for sorcery. At the heart of the efficacy of oogun 1S a profound and pervasive belief in magic.... The Yorubas use magic in every facet of human life from the womb to the grave. There are no activities, even in this day of technological advancement, with which magic is not associated. (Dopamu 1987:20) Oogun takes many forms, both intangible and material. Oogun refers to the knowledge needed to capture and concentrate powers drawn from nature's products, the verbal incantations and formulas necessary to activate and command the powers, and the f1nal products that result. The skilled practitioner has a large repertoire of formulas for making medicines which take the form of ingestible liquids and powders salves, soaps, charms, and incantations. Whatever forms it takes, oogun is imbued with the energy or power present in the natural features of the landscape such as hills and rivers, animals, plants, human beings, and the deities (Abiodun 1994:72). By putting this vital force in all he created, the Yoruba supreme deityS Olorun, provided a power to be used as ase zthe power-to-make-things-happen, morally neutral power, power to give, and to take awayv to kill and to give life" (Thompson 1983:5-6). Oogun, including incantations, employs ase to concentrate the powers of nature to perform specific tasks; i.e., to cure, harm, protect, and attain a life goal. In the indigenous context, oogun enters into all aspects of human life. Every Yoruba man and woman has access to knowledge of herbal remedies and magical formulas that help one cope with the misadventures and hazards of day-to-day living. According to the indigenous Yoruba worldview, life can be disrupted or cut short by the actions of other human beings such as witches (aje) and malicious sorcerers (oso) or by deities and evil spirits (anjonu). With oogun one can protect oneself and family from such attacks control individual destinyS assure success andS if of a vindictive natures place obstacles in the paths of rivals while protecting self and family from retribution. The procedures and formulas of oogun are part of a large body of esoteric knowledge that can be inherited, purchased, or received as a gift from one who is knowledgeable. The formulas and incantations needed to assemble and activate the most powerful types of oogun are not easily come by and are most often in the hands of specialists who are frequently both healers and sorcerers. Those who do not own the needed formulas can hire a medical practitioner such as an oloogun to implement their desires.4 This research has drawn heavily from the knowledge of Ayo,5 an oloogun healer- sorcerer who until his death 1n the late 1970s lived in Abeokuta an Egba Yoruba city known for its particularly powerful and dangerous medicines.6 As an oloogun he specialized in retaliatory medicines, although most of his clients came for healing herbal remedies and charms for protection and success in life. When he was younger Ayo had been active as a woodcarver, but when his physical powers declined with</page><page sequence="7">THE USE OF HUMAN IMAGES IN YORUBA MEDICINES 211 age he devoted most of his time to making and selling oogun Ayo's pride in his reputation for wickedness was evident when he said, Because of the many medicines I have people fear mes no matter how big or important they are, they must fear me. This is because if I am angry, the result will be fatal for them. People believe that money is the god of this world but money is not as praiseworthy as medicine. An oloogun can make a three- storey building fall down. Can a rich man do that? His reputation was built on his extensive knowledge of medicines that could be used to cure or cause misfortune and on peopleSs perception of his success in using them. The formulas for what he considered his most powerful medicines were inherited from ancestral hunters and warriors of his patrilineage and learned directly from his grandfather. Among these were several medicines calling for the types of human images described here. TYPES OF HUMAN IMAGES USED IN OOGUN Four types of human images are used in oogun: 1) aworan, small wood figures created speciElcally as medicine ingredients; 2) omolangidi, wood dolls ordinarily considered toys; 3) sigidi, clay figures, and 4) okuta stone figures. None of these images can enhance or channel supernatural powers until they are put into contact with additional natural ingredients to fully empower them. The practitioner alternatively rubs the figure with medicine ingredients such as leaves in their natural or burnt form, puts it in contact over a longer period with such power sources to absorb their energies, or wraps the figure together with power substances in a charm bundle. Aworan Aworan7 are small often tiny-HIgures carved ffom wood to be used as ingredients in different medicines. The wc)od used to carve the figures is dictated by the use to which the image will be put. Female or male aworan represent the Yoruba everyman, and are carved in the recognizable Yoruba style. The figures are rendered with oversized head with large eyes and protruding lips, arms close to or attached to the sides of the body, shortened, straight legs and large, spatulate feet. Aworan vary in height from one to eight inches. The females are generally depicted naked with exaggerated breasts and braided hair, while males have explicitly carved genitals and bald heads associated with ritual cleansing.8 Aworan are commonly carved as standing figures, but can als{) be kneeling flgures or half-Elgures when the image is to be incorporated into a charm bundle that covers the lower half of the body. Aworan are the tnost common form of human image created for use in medicines. In oogun ika (evil medicine), aworan can contribute to adversely affecting victims by making them fall sick or preventing them from having any good fortune in life. Alternatively, they are used in oogun which can protect against harm, induce</page><page sequence="8">212 ETHNOLOGY popularity, and promote success in all areas of life. Medicine formulas that utilize aworan include ones that cure barrenness in women, induce love in members of the opposite sex, ensure popularity, punish unfaithfulness of sex partners, win or delay court cases, wtie" people so that they cannot carry out certain activities protect warriors in battle, guarantee safety during travel, help a person to zget upt (i.e., to succeed in any venture undertaken), bring money to an individual, send messages (good and bad) to people while they sleep, make people sick, prevent thieves from entering a house ensure good health, Elght witchcraft and implant the powers of witchcraft in a person's body for tilture use. While medical practitioners and their clients can make the aworan they use in their own medicines, the figures are often commissioned from professional woodcarvers. The clients usually bring the wood to be used to the carvers to prevent any error since the efficacy of the medicine is dependent upon the materials used. The carvers are usually aware of the use to which the client will put the imageS but no special rituals sacrifices, or incantations are performed in the making of aworan carvings, nor is any secrecy practiced. While some aworan are carved with care by the professional carver to conform to the aesthetic canons of Yoruba woodcarving others are crudely conceived. According to the carvers, these differences are economically determined; i.e., the customer gets what he or she pays for. However, crude or beautiifully detailed, aworan flgures are efficacious once combined with other oogun ingredients by a specialist. Occasionally, when the figure itself is the core of the medicine it demands a carved likeness of the person to be affected, necessitating the talents of a trained carver. An example of an individualized aworan is illustrated in fFaggs (1970) Miniatare Wood Carvings of Africa. While Fagg does not identify the function of the carving, he notes the idiosyncratic features of the piece. The Yoruba have a broadly naturalistic form of arts but this piece is naturalistic in a special way and remarkably true to life. Evidently it shows a woman of large proportions, with plenty of fat about the shoulderss and the skirt is untidily arranged, which is most unusual. The style suggests an origin near Lagos and one is irresistibly reIninded of the great market women of Lagos, who formerly wielded great power in the land. . . The function of the string [wrapped around her lower arms and across below the breast] is unknown. (Fagg 1970:fig. 24) The cord (string-) binding the arms to the body is the crucial clue that identifies the piece as aworan. It is a well-known type of Yoruba oogun ika used to zfastenb people,9 preventing them from doing anything until the cord is untied. Other types of carved aworan in which the figure itself is the focus of the medicine are aworun ibCi and alawo. Aworan ibeJi are eight to twelve inches high and more carefully carved than the small figures used as one of many ingredients in medicine formulas. They are often mistaken for ibeji figures used in ritual contexts, but the two sculpture types differ signiElcantly in their function and power; a difference signaled by the labels applied to the carvings by medicine practitioners: ere ibeji and aworan ibeji. The ere ibeji is created by professional carvers with ritual</page><page sequence="9">THE USE OF HUMAN IMAGES IN YORUBA MEDICINES 213 process to be a channel of communication to the twin spirit for whom it was created. The aworan ibeji, on the other hand, has no power when it leaves the hands of the carver. Indistinguishable from the ritual ibeji in formal attributes, such a figure gains power only through contact with oogun substances that are applied to it by the medical practitioner who prepares it for a specific task. Some ibeji figures which have been collected have cryptic incised patterns on the bottom of the base. These appear to be associated with their use in oogun. An aworan ibeji used by Ayo for medicines has a triangular mark. A similar incised mark occurs on the bottom of Ifa divination trays. In reference to aworan ibeji, Ayo explained We must put the mark there because we rub it with medicine so that it can work.- This is similar to the practice of making incisions on the human body that are rubbed with medicine. Aworan ibeji are kept in the house of the oloogun and used repeatedly. For example, in the past they were used in a medicine to protect warriors in battle. An aworan ibeji was treated with medicine ingredients and placed on its back before a man went into battle. This action prevented all but one of his enemies from being able to stand up to H1ght at any one time, thereby equalizing the odds of winning. In the contemporary context, this same medicine is said to be used by thieves to cause all of the occupants of a house to sleep deeply throughout a burglary. Alternatively, an aworan ibeji can be buried in the floor of a house to prevent thieves from stealing. Oruene (1985) suggests that ibeji are used in rituals that call upon the powers of Esu, the messenger of the deities, and Sango, god of thunder and lightning (to whom they are closely tied) to track down and punish thieves and other wrongdoers. In another use, a healing medicine can be prepared by washing ibeji figures in a mixture of water-plant juices and the water of snails (suggesting a link to Osun a river goddess); the resulting medicine is used to wash the body (Oruene 1985:214). The second subtype, alawo (five to eight inches tall), differs from other aworan in form and function. According to Ayo7 the alawo is particularly powerfill. Carved from hardwoods such as iroko and apa (which have strong powers in themselves), with a deep cavity gouged into the body to contain medicine ingredients, the alawo is a surrogate and messenger used to harm the intended victim. The flgure is given the name of the person to be affected and sent on its punishing errand to a named place where the victim resides. For exampleS an alawo may be carved in the image of a pregnant woman and be sent to prompt a spontaneous abortion. * - Omolangzda A second type of woodcarved medicine flgure has functions similar to aworan images. This is the omolangidi, a stylized doll (six to eight inches tall) used for play. Girls wash, clothe, feed, and carry the dolls about to imitate their mothers (Drewal, Pemberton, and Abiodun 1989:229). The diagnostic attribute of omolangidi dolls is that the body is usually a rectangular block with no indication of limbs. Today, simple omolangidi are made in carving compounds and sold in quantity to market</page><page sequence="10">2 14 ETHNOLOGY traders. These market dolls are made from flat slabs of wood with the head and body divided by a notch on each side with no or little indication of body or facial features. In collections one can see older, more carefully conceived omolangidi in which the head has well-defined features, a carefully Elnished elaborate headdress, and with elaborate incised designs added to the body block (Drewal, Pembertonl and Abiedun 1989:pl. 264). Stylistically, it is impossible to distinguish an omolangidi that is used as an item of play from one used in medicines. zDolls for play and for magic have multiple and constantly changing meanings depeIlding on the userX (Dagan 1990:24). ss rs . * * s wnen usec ln mec wlclnes tne omo angldl, 11ke the aworan figure, must be ritually infused with power to be effective. The real-life function of omolangidi as child surrogate carries over into the medicine. Characteristics of children are alluded to in incantations that activate medicines that use omolangidi. Carrying a charm that includes an omolangidi as one of the ingredients will assure popularity for an individual, because zomolangidi does not enter a town without having friends, a mother and father.- On the other hand, an omolangidi can be used in an antisocial medicine that causes barrenness, and is also used by thieves, when the omolangidi is placed on its back as if asleep to prevent members of the household from waking when intruders enter a house at night. In this case, the deep sleep of the child is called forth, as well as the lack of authority associated with the child. The various types of aworan and the omolangidi are good examples of Taussig's (1993) wmagical power of replication'; the image is a generic reminder of the human condition and through a labeling process can become a surrogate figure linked to the person to whom powers are directed. However, replication alone does not empower the image; the figure is empowered only when combined with other magical ingredients In Taussig's terms the magic of mimesis does not stop with the creation of the f1gure. Full embodiment and empowerment comes when it is put in contact with other ingredients which contain the power of the living universe. While aworan and omolangidi are imbued with power aifter the carving process, two other types of medicine figures sigidi and okuta gain their power in the creative process itself. As power objectss they are thought to be mobile and can act as messengers and avengers in carrying out the wishes and commands of their owners. . . . Slgldl Sigidi is the best-documented type of human image used in Yoruba oogun and is also the most terrifying to believers. As early as 1894 a British observer described sigidi as aa deified nightmare" (Ellis 1964:64). A Yoruba eyewitness account of the use of sigidi conE1rms this belief. Name, fame, liberty, and all that make life worth living, and all that a man possessed, were at stake. The man concerned imported two medicine men from the up-country, hoping to improve the situatlon and pending gloom. Every effort was made, and there seemed no hope unless someone</page><page sequence="11">THE USE OF HUMAN IMAGES IN YORUBA MEDICINES 215 important and dangerous was done away with. One of the men went to his country and returned bringing with him the necessary clay, mixed with dmgs, and the irnage was made. It was then placed in a separate room, and for seven days the men were engaged in "developing" their man. I peeped in occasionally to see how the Elgure progressed, and it appeared quite the same to me dunng the whole time. As the Elgure is "developed' by the way, the men go to the cemetery every day to perform certain ceremonies. At the appointed time when the "Sigidis' was to go out an announcement was made, and all the inhabitants were warned to stay indoors from ten o-clock in the evening until dawn. And so it was observed. About midnight I awoke and called to the men sleeping on the mat at the foot of my bed. Suddenly my head began to swim and I heard a sound, unlike a manes footstep, a heavy jump, then another, in the direction of the door leading outside. Then the sound faded away. The '&amp;Sigidi" had gone. The men told me they must not sleep again until its return, otherwise they would be in danger. After about two hours "the thing" returned; there was the same heavy sound at intervals in the direction of its own apartment. The men all the while murmured words of welcome in concert. (Delano 1937: 100-01) Babalawos (Ifa diviners) and olooguns create their own empowered sigidi figures in the form of solid, unE1red clay figures. Sigidi are usually amorphous and crudely fashioned with limited delineation of human features (Morton-Williams 1960:pl. 2). However, Poyner (1990) reports having seen sigidi associated with palace personnel in Owo that were carefully and elaborately sculpted. Sigidi differ from aworan and omolangidi Elgures in the material used to shape them, their stylistic characteristics, and way they are used. Sigidi are more than mere components of medicines; a sigidi is the medicine, with powerful ingredients mixed into the clay from which it is createde The figures harbor an indwelling spirit given anthropomorphic torm by the clay Elgure. It is in this form that it is visualized: One morning about six o-clock, the Elrst woman who came out of e house raised an alarm. All the inmates and neighbours rushed out to see what was the matter. A "Sigidis' was staIlding there with a short black cudgel in its hand. I saw it. A "Sigidi' is made with clay in the fol-ll. of a mans about a foot and a half high. The general belief was that it had been sent by the husband to kill the seducer.... (Delano 1937:99-100) The sigidi spirit can move about in the real world and appears to have the quality of iluti; it responds efficaciously as messenger and avenger for the owner. It can deliver threatening messages cause illness beat and kill victims in their sleep, destroy property as its owner commands, or feed his greed by stealing. Sometimes the mere sighting of a sigidi is sufficient to bring about the desired eifect. An Ibadan traditional doctor employs a sigidi to get back a wife who has left her husband. After lighting an oil lamp and placing it in front of the sigidi he chants an Ifa odu Ia verse from the highly complex Ifa divination systeml. The woman sees sigidi and returIrs to her husband. (Simpson 1980:88) Sigidi unlike other forms of medicine f1gures may act on its own volition. To be known as an owner of sigidi adds to the reputation of a medical practitioner; only a "toughX man can control the sigidi spirit. As alaase (owner of power), he is both admired as one who can control the powers of nature and the spirit world but at the</page><page sequence="12">216 ETHNOLOGY same time feared for the purpose to which he can put those powers. The sigidi can be used not only to intervene in interpersonal disputes but also play a role in chieftaincy and kingship disputes (Poyner 1990). Ayo, who took pride in his reputation as an alaase had a sigidi which he claimed to have modeled from clay over 40 years before (c. 1930). It was one of his most powerful implements of sorcery. Despite his skills as artist, the sigidi was crudely modeled a torso with large head molded from unfired clay. Cowrie shells had been pressed into the wet clay of the torso and used to indicate eyes. A stick of abo wood had been pushed horizontally through the clay to support the original clay arms which had crumbled. According to Ayo, both cowries and wood are essential elements to make a sigidi. Cowries are important because they are emblematic of Esu, the Yoruba trickster, who acts as a messenger for the deities and can alter people's fate. Abo wood, which is also used to make magic whips to punish thieves, has the power to stand up and close the victim's eyes." When Ayo wanted to activate the sigidi, he prepared a mixture of leaves and pressed it into an opening in the top of the figure's head or into its mouth to release the power. An incantation then sent the sigidi on its errand of malevolence. Once activated7 a sigidi of this type is a savage, nondiscriminating force for evil. If a sigidi is deflected from its mission (if, for example, the proposed victim has protective medicines powerful enough to deter the attack), it may return to inflict punishment upon its owner or upon innocent passers-by who cross its path. The messenger sigidi, whatever its assignment, is sent out in the late afternoon or night. It is invisible on its missions and appears to the victim in nightmares. According to Ayo, aWe give it a whip and ask it to go and be beating a person. It will go and beat the person when she or he sleeps. It will beat them and the marks of the beating will show on their bodies." If the victim survives the initial visitation, he or she can seek help from an oloogun to repulse the next attack or, more commonly, go to beg for relief from the medical practitioner or his client thought responsible for the attack. 4'If sigidi beats a man todayS tomorrow he will go to the oloogun for rescue. He must give money to him before sigidi will stop beating him.t In addition to acting as messengers, sigidi can be created to act as surrogates for specific individuals to be punished. The sigidi is made to order for a client who wishes to harm some other person or when the owner himself wishes to punish someone. For example, Ayo prepared a sigidi for a man whose wife left him for another man. The crudely modeled female bust had a distinctive hairstyle to identify the woman to be affected. Oogun ingredients were inserted into a hole in the top of the head and palm oil (a sacrif1cial material preferred by Esu) was poured over the flgure. The woman was said to have been afflicted with violent headaches which would have driven her mad if she had not come to beg for relief and returned to her husband. A similar medicine is labeled apeta (come and shoot) (Abraham 1958:59). To prepare apeta a mud effigy is made to represent the victimS whose name is then called three times in the night. After each summons, the f1gure is shot three times using a miniature bow and arrow. The victim is supposed to die from the attack,</page><page sequence="13">THE USE OF HUMAN IMAGES IN YORUBA MEDICINES 217 which will show up as arrow wounds on the body the following day (Abraham 1958:59). A type of sigidi that is both messenger and surrogate played a more public role in controlling the actions of palace officials in the courts of indigenous Yoruba rulers, as well as acting as a symbol of their power (Johnson 1921:60-63). In the Oyo kingdom of central Yorubaland, the Alaafin (king) was surrounded by ilari (male palace messengers and bodyguards). Each ilari had a clay image (shugadu) made to represent him when he was initiated into office. Hair cut from the initiate's head and medicine ingredients were pounded into the wet clay used to create the f1gure. Part of the prepared medicine was also rubbed into incisions on the occiput and left arm of the initiate to give him powers to fulfill rpsponsibilities indicated by a new name taken at initiation, such as Moaboludigbaro (I join the king in standing) or Fenunfoba (allow the king to issue orders) (Johnson 1921:60-63; Abraham 1958:19-20). Identical incision patterns were made on the clay sigidi, which was given the same name as the initiate and left in the care of a palace woman who was initiated as zmother" to the new ilari. She was charged with caring for the sigidi and keeping it empowered by rubbing medicine into its incisions (Johnson 1921:62; Babayemi 1991:11 1). The regular ritual application of medicines to the sigidi not only strengthened the ilari for the tasks at hand (Babayemi 1991:11 1), but also provided a means of controlling him since the power of a man's sigidi could rebound on him. The element of control was important becauseS as officers of the court, ilari played a variety of administrativeS ritual, and domestic functions that opened avenues of considerablepolitical and economicpower (Johnson 1921:62). The ilari served as links between the Alaafin and people of the town in the everyday administrative framework. More than that, they played a significant role in the rituals surrounding the divine king. [Tlhe functiows of the ilclri . . . are Elrst to perforrn rituals to reinforce the supernatural powers of the Alaafim and themselves as his agents. The ilari are the communicating links between the AlaaEln alld the spirit world and between the palace and the world of men. By their ritual functions, they are assuring the community that the Alaafin is taking every measure to control the spirit world, thereby catering for the spirituals economic and socio-well-being of his people. (Babayemi 1991:114) The power vested in the use of sigidi was displayed publicly at rituals where the king appeared in state accompanied by his court officials. At such occasionss each ilari displayed his sigidi at his seat (Johnson 1921:62). WJust as security guards keep their watch dogs with them on duty, so the Ilarl were expected to take their magical watch dogsX (Oduyoye 1983:63). The public showing of the sigidi flgures was a potent visual reminder that the ilar1 could spring into action and protect the king at any time. The openly exhibited sigidi were perceived as an almost invincible army ready to descend upon any persons who plotted against the king and his officials (Oduyoye 1983:63). Poyner (1990) discovered such an army of sigidi in palace storerooms in Owo.</page><page sequence="14">218 ETHNOLOGY As a kind of medicine figure, the sigidi obviously operates differently from the aworan and omolangidi. While it is oogun and gains its power ffom those natural ingredients from which it is shaped, the sigidi is visualized in a human, yet terrifyingly different form with agency that can move about the living world. The powers are truly embodied for both practitioner and victim. Sigidi has been linked to Esu, the only Yoruba deity directly portrayed in Yoruba sculpture (Wescott 1962). Idowu (1963), in his discussion of Yoruba religion, suggests that sigidi may actually be a manifestation of Esu. EsuS the Yoruba trickster and messenger to the deities, is described as the keeper of the supreme deity's ase (the power to make things happen). Anyone who draws upon ase must propitiate Esu H1rst because of his unpredictablebehavior-bothafriendandfoeatthesametimeX (Lawal 1985:99-100). While primarily the divine messenger, Esu can also be employed to injure an enemy through his supernatural powers. The suppliant goes before the emblem of Eshu, taking with him palm-oil and palm-kernel oil. It is said that Eshu delights in drinking palm-oils while palm-kernel oil is tabu to him. The suppliant therefore pours the palm-oil on the emblem saying, "This is palm-oil, O Eshu: I know that it is your food, and so I have come to give it to you. Grant me your favour and protection.'? Then he takes the palm-kernel oil and says, '*0 Eshu, this is palm-kernel oil; I know that it is not your food and I dare not give it to you. But so-and-so (here he names the enemy) has asked me to give it to you even though he knows that it is not your foods in his name Go now and avenge yourself." It is believed that immediately after the ritual is completed, Eshu will rush off to deal the enemy a blow, or stir him to some action which will bring upon him a calamitous consequence. The suppliant must observe certain precautions, however. He must not go to sleep until he has made sure that Eshu has completed his errand.... But supposing the enemy is stronger and has protected himself agaiwst the suppliant's probable designs with some magic which may ward off Eshu, or some propitiatory remedy which may change the wrath of Eshu into favour towards him? Then, since the cudgel of Eshu once raised must not be lowered unused, Eshu will return to demand why the suppliant had sent him out on a fruitless pursuit, and that means that the blow will now be dealt at him. (Idowu 1963:83-84) The violence of the punishment, the use of a cudgel, and Esu's punishment of the sender if his task is thwarted is reminiscent of the actions of sigidi. It is also significant that the Esu shrine is usually made from laterite soil or clay. An emblem of Esu can be a piece of laterite or stone stuck in the ground or into a mound of earth, an image of clay or wood with or without a knife and club, an earthenware pot turned upside down with a hole to receive sacriE1ces or a piece of hard rock kept in an earthenware dish where oil is poured on it regularly (Idowu 1963:85). Okuta Images carved from stone (okuta) also act as messengers and draw upon the power of Esu and other indigenous deities such as Saponna, the god of smallpox. Stone images are a relatively rare form of Yoruba sculpture. Most examples occur in archaeological context and are considered as something out of the ordinary by Yoruba people. The best-known examples are the hundreds of stone flgures found in a sacred grove in Esie in northeastern Yorubaland. Their origin is unknown. Local</page><page sequence="15">THE USE OF HUMAN IMAGES IN YORUBA MEDICINES 219 history states that the figures were there when the fbunders of the town arrived in the late eighteenth century (Stevens 1978:82). Until recently a festival of images (odun ere) was held each year at Esie to appease the ancestral spirits the figures were thought to represent (Drewal, Pemberton? and Abiodun 1989:88). In the oral traditions of Yorubaland, it is common to link stone images with the spirits of powerful warriors of the past. For example, Idowu (1963:13) discusses Baba Sigidi, a human image carved from stone that can be seen in the town of Ile- Ifes the point of origin for the Yoruba peoples according to indigenous history. The young visitor would be taken to see Baba Sigidi . . . an Ife warrior of antiquity who, instead of dying in the normal way, converted himself to stone. Baba Sigidi is tne granite bust of an aged personage wearing a rafEla hat.... [Ilt would be explained further to the young visitor that in the old days several of the great and strong men did not die in what had now become the normal way, but changed themselves into stone or waLked through a cave into heaven. There are other accounts of warriors turning to stone and disappearing either into the ground or a cave, but only Idowu mentions the name of such a Elgure, which in this case translates as zthe father of sigidi." According to Ayo, stone medicine figures do not have a generic name but are referred to by the name of deities who lend power to the image. Okuta, which translates as stone was used by Ayo to refer to all stone images, but may not have broad currency as a label. Ayo referred to the human images carved from stone and used as medicine figures by the names of specific Yoruba deities such as Esu or Obaluaiye (King of the World), a reference to Saponna, the god of smallpox who can cause serious sickness and madness. Such avoidance names are used to elude the attention of the "hot godst who are easily offerlded and capricious (Buckley 1985b: 189).1° The forces called up by okuta Elgures are considered to be particularly powerful because of their association with these punishing deities. The stone images act much like sigidi but are seen as even more dangerous. Sent out like sigidi in the late atternoon or night, okuta inflict physical punishments on specified individuals that often result in death. When the messenger returns to its master, he compensates it with a generous sacrifice? such as a chicken lest he share the punishment inflicted upon his victim. Once appeased, the spirit of the okuta image will go away without trouble until called again. As with sigidi attacks, victims lucky enough to survive can only halt the assaults by seeking help from an oloogun often the very one who is the owner of the okuta figure. Unlike sigidi, which are activated by the application of oogun, okuta appear to draw directly upon the powers of specific deities. Sacrifices to the deity need to be offered to energize and control the flgure. The stone image appears to be the focus of the activating process, but it is not clear whether the apparition is anthropomor- phized like the sigidi. For example, in the case of Saponna, the deity is reported to have servants (eburu and woroko) who take the form of wind to inflict sickness and madness upon people (Buckley 1 985b: 189).</page><page sequence="16">220 ETHNOLOGY Eburu and woroko are the children of Sonpomo, and there are more of them than there are people in the world. They have no other work than to be used by Sonponno as tools for fighting. Some of them he may send against human beings, animals and trees. They usually nde on air. (Buckley 1985b:193) CONCLUSION In the above description of how fabricate(l human images take on the quality of agency to function in the Yoruba indigenous medical system aworan, omolangidi7 sigidi, and okuta can be seen as different manifestations of magical mimesis which attempt to Zmanipulate reality by means of its image," in Taussig's terms. Through embodiment of diffuse natural forces in the form of the human image, the medical practitioner can create a surrogate, a messenger, or a Yoruba everyman/woman so that those powers are grounded and operate in the cultural world. Unlike most indigenous medicines they are oFten finely tuned to affect specific individuals for good or evil. The person who has the knowledge to create and use such power objects is also socially empowered, as in the case of Ayo, who was respected and feared for his use of powerful medicines, particularly sigidi. Taussig's remaining two interrelated questions -1) why do the indigenous practitioners feel the need to carve or mold such forms when they claim the power comes from the materials used, not from the formal attributes of the object itself, and 2) why is embodiment necessary?-must be answered together. In the personalistic medical system of indigenous Yoruba beliefS everything (animate and inanimate) has a latent power, an innate forceX that is Zthe quintes- sence of the thing itself" with "its own personality, specific, limited in definite ways, and very much like the object it inhabits" (Ayoade 1978:50). The formulas that dictate the materials used in any particular medicine draw upon the variegated personalities of the ingredients depending upon the goal to be achieved. The choice of the materials from which medicine f1gures are fashioned depends upon the practitioner's knowledge of these personalities and the desired results. The medicine figures personalize and concretize specific latent powers of nature's forces as manifested in minerals, plants, animals, and spirit beings, so that the intangible takes human form. Medicine figures are further strengthened and focused when put into contact with other ingredients such as plant and animal parts with their own special qualities and then activated by incantations. Anthropomorphizing the powers of nature through the fabrication of human images can be seen as an act of magical mimesis to assure control over potentially dangerous forces. Horton (1965), in his analysis of sculpture among the Kalabari of the Niger Delta, made a similar observation. Kalabari shrine sculpture functions to control a spirit by fi1xing its positionb (Horton 1965:9). The sculpture acts to "imprison and confine" the spirit and acts to restrict its active movement. According to one of Horton's informants, there are dangers in dealing with spirits without the fixing sculpture:</page><page sequence="17">THE USE OF HUMAN IMAGES IN YORUBA MEDICINES 221 If you invoke a spirit without a sculpture to act against someone who has wronged you, where will you call it off? Maybe, the place where you invoke, the spirit will not be there; and the place where you do not invoke, the spirit will be there. (Horton 1965:8) In Yoruba medicine the necessity of fixing the power source is obvious. In dealing with a diverse force that is everywhere in nature the practitioner is called upon to focus this power for specililc social goals ohen directed toward single individuals. Crafting medicines both mixes and Elxes the powers so that they can be utilized by individuals and groups. Medicines store power and act as transformers to direct the force; using a medicine figure sharply focuses the several forces that go into the medicine through embodiment of the power in human shape, thus positioning it in the living human world. In magical mimesis, control over the power embodied or fixed in the human image is further strengthened through naming the medicine figure through the force of incantations that guide the powers toward the desired results.1l For example, in the case of aworan the incantation that climaxes the act of magical mimesis olten labels the image with the name of the person to be affected Once linked to an individual, the medicine figure is then placed where it will be in close contact with that person or put into contact with other power sources that can bring about desired results. In one sorcery medicine, the aworan, linked to the intended victim named by incantation, is tied to an apa tree (which is considered a meeting place for witches). Generic labels such as omolangidi (child) can also be called in incantations as a reminder of the behaviors associated with the role, as in the medicine used to induce deep sleep during a robbery. The fixing of the powers in the form of a medicine figure and the necessity of incantations and naming to call forth and direct a power are even more important in the use of the sigidi and the okuta types of images where the spirits called forth are capricious. Beyond serving the instrumental needs of fixing and focusing a power source through embodying natural forces in human shape, the medicine figure reflects Yoruba beliefs about humans and their place in the larger universe. The human body expresses some of the most fundamental categories of Yoruba thought (Buckley 1985a). In Yoruba philosophy an individual feels caught Win the centre of a web of personal and spiritual relationships" in which the central figure of man is seen to be continually interacting with spiritual principalities and powers. The ancestors, the gods and the spirits of place, plants and animalss all have an influence on his present existence and are capable, conversely, of being manipulated to his advantage. (Maclean 1971:50) Yoruba sculpture does not portray the deities themselves (except for Esu, who acts as intermediary between the deities and the living) but depicts humans in their many economic political, and religious roles. For example, genre multifigured sculpture shows people of social importance surrounded by retainers. Beyond acting as a social mirror, Yoruba sculpture in its stylistic features reveals a concern for the metaphysical signiElcance of the human body. The spiritual self, which is the source of human personality is located in the inner head (ori inu), which is the locus of the</page><page sequence="18">222 ETHNOLOGY vital forces of ase in the body that control individual destiny (Idowu 1963:169-85; Lawal 1985). It is athe most important force responsible for human success or failure" (Abimbola 1975:390). The Yoruba woodcarver sculpts the human head proportionately larger than in life and gives it special attention in H1nishing details. Yoruba figurative sculptures including most medicine flgures with the head on a 1:4 or 1:3 ratio with the body, are a reminder of the melding of the spiritual and the physical body in a world where the powers of nature are continually in the service of humans with the knowledge to control them. Attention is drawn to the importance of the head as the home of the human spirit by the fact that a shrine to the deities is called oja'bo (face for worshiping the spirit) In a statement about shrines and sculpture that is similar to that of Horton, Lawal (1985: 101) notes: The face oju, connotes access. Thus what can be solved "has a face" (o l'oju); the unsolvable "has no faceS' (to l 'oju); an entanglement "has a blocked face" (o di ju). To tame or pacify is to S'cool the face" (tu l'oju). Therefore providing the symbel of an vrisa with a face facilitates the paciElcation of that orisa; for what has a face is controllable. In Yoruba religious practice, placing carved or molded human figures on a shrine draws further attention to the spiritual essence of humans shared with the deity. The ere provide a focus for the dialogue between worshiper and deity by acting as ua surrogate that smasksS the actual presence of the orisa" (Lawal 1985). Just as the shrine is the face of the deity that focuses power to and from the deityz the human image used in oogun positions and directs powerv The acts of embodiment and empowerment that are revealed in the creation and use of human images in Yoruba medicines described here illustrate Taussigs (1993) concept of magical mimesis. The replication involved in the creation of Yoruba power objects in the form of a powerful cultural metaphor is more than mere imitation; it is an attempt to manipulate reality. Through the image a link is forged between what is and what is desired, thus socially empowering the individual who uses it. In the act of replicating a human image in Yoruba medicine, the supernatural potency of the Inedicine ingredients, the laheled medicine flgures and the named individual are brought together; at this point there is an interpenetration that bridges the naturaI, supernatural, and the social worlds.

Small, highly stylized female human images dating to 20,000 to 25,000 years ago from the Upper Paleolithic have been found in sites stretching over much of Europe and as far wesr as Sibena (Campbell 1985-454). They are usually identiEled as "fertility Elgures," suggesting their use 1n some type of ritual mag1c (e.g. Marshack 1972), although there are other interpretaelons . 3. Medicine Elgures, as used here, are artifacts in the shape of the human body that are used as containerss surrogates, or devices used in medicines (charms, amulets, etc.) to channel powers of nature</page><page sequence="19">THE USE OF HUMAN IMAGES IN YORUBA MEDICINES 223 and the universe. Eliminated from consideration are medicines that incorporate actual body parts and residues as the operative agent. 4. Oloogun is one of several terms for Yoruba medical practitioners, and is distinguished from onisegun erbalist), babalawo (Ifa diviner and priest of Orunmola), and oso (wizard or sorcerer). 5. In an earlier publication (Wolff 1978), I used the pseudonym Sodikare to protect his identity. Here I call him Ayo, a name closer to his own, since he later told me that he was proud of his reputation and wanted to be identified in anything I wrote. 6. It is necessary to be specific about the source of knowledge when dealing with the Yoruba The complexity of the Yoruba knowledge system, plus the political fragmentation of indigenous Yoruba into over 50 kingdoms, has resulted in recording conflicting data on religious beliefs. The data here describe the use of medicine figures among the Egba people of Abeokuta. 7. Aworan also is a generic name for any image, whether two or thres dimensional. 8. The head is often shaved when individuals are being treated so that medicines can be rubbed into cuts on the scalp. The head is also shaved as part of certain rituals associated with religious cults. 9. This type of binding charm was used as early as Greco-Roman times (Faraone 1991) and is widespread over West Africa (see Blier 1995). 10. I was able to gather little information about the category of stone medicine figuress perhaps due to the reluctance of individuals to offend those harsh deities by speaking of them. 11. Horton (1993) suggests that the efficacy of medicines or ritual is due to the incantations ("the magical power of words"). From this point of view, medicine figures are nonverbal symbols that are given direction and significance by the verbal incantations (Horton 1993:224-26). BIBLIOGRAPHY Abimbola, W. 1975.
