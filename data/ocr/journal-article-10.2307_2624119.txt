<plain_text><page sequence="1">On specialness ALEX DANCHEV 'Specialness' in international relations-above all, one particular 'special relationship'- is an idea much used and much abused but little analysed. Alex Danchev here interro- gates its meaning, and its usage, and asks if we can, after all, specify specialness.* It is not our policy continuously to try to be one-up, as a nation, on other nations; but it is our aim to rub in the fact that we are not trying to do this, otherwise what is the point of not trying to do this?' We limeys have a peculiar position to keep up, you know. ...We can't all be at the top of the tree but we are all men of responsibility.You never find an Englishman among the underdogs-except in England of course.2 'The Special Relationship'-the very idea of 'specialness' in this sphere-is a notion now over half a century old, yet it remains radically under-thought and under-theorized.The terms themselves are commonly tricked out with invert- ed commas, as here. The well-read, well-respected collection edited by Wm Roger Louis and Hedley Bull is a classic case in point. This book, entitled The 'special relationship', might be described as a treatise on inverted commas. It is prefaced as follows: The 'Special Relationship' was not the theme of the conferences [on which the book is based].. .In discussions designed to study contemporary problems at least as much as the historical background, the label 'Special Relationship' seemed to prejudice the debate...Yet the idea of an intimate connection, a 'Special Relationship', would not go away. Indeed it haunted the discussions. Eventually it was referred to as the ghost, ever * This article originated in presentations to the i995 Fulbright Conference at the University of Hull and the I996 Commonwealth Fund Conference at University College, London.

Why was it 'special'? Was it a good thing? What has become of it? Has it run its course?3 These little marks, the inverted commas, are evidently meant to convey some- thing important: a certain coolness-scepticism, perhaps, or irony; a post- modern awareness that words are playthings, ideas are constructs and nothing is as it seems. The little marks promise more: if not explication, then at least interpretation. Yet the cupboard is bare. The inverted commas are not short- hand but sham.The scholarly evasions offered above are no more illuminating than the politician's categorical imperatives. 'It is special. It just is. And that's that.'4 In the literature of the special relationship, attitude trumps analysis. 5 There has been some refinement. We have long since discarded the Evangelical mode so expertly satirized in Stephen Potter's'Hands-Across-The- Seamanship': First lessons concentrate on the necessity of always using the same phrases, and using them again and again. No harm in the general reader memorizing one or two of them now: We have a lot in common. After all, we come from the same stock. We have a lot to learn from each other.6 The Evangelists had a sense of mission. Equally important, they also had a point of reference: the greatest Anglo-American experience of their lifetimes, the Grand Alliance of the Second World War. For them, specialness was like the scriptures. It required not examination but exegesis, or simply revelation. The Evangelist-in-Chief was, of course, Winston Churchill. 'The natural Anglo- American special relationship' (not to mention 'the fraternal association of the English-speaking peoples') was his coinage and his dream. 'I cannot help reflecting that if my father had been American and my mother British, instead of the other way round, I might have got here on my own,' he told an enrap- tured Congress in December I941.'In that case this would not have been the first time you would have heard my voice.' Famously, the voice carried. For the wartime generation and its offspring specialness was articulated in a distinc- 3 Wm Roger Louis and Hedley Bull, eds, The 'special relationship' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, I989), p. vii.

The same speech expressed his hope and faith,'sure and inviolate, that in the days to come the British and American peoples will for their own safety and the good of ali walk together side by side in majesty, injustice, and in peace'.7 More than any other individual, it was Churchill who advertised the benefits of the relationship and dramatized its possibilities in his own life. Except as apostrophe, it did not sur- vive him. For some two decades now, the dominant mode has been the Functional. In sharp contrast to the earlier work, this is neither militant nor inspiring. Functionalists aim to reconstruct, not convert. They take their cue from the plain-speaking Dean Acheson:'I shali not bother you by doing what is done so often on occasions like this, of talking about all that we have in common: lan- guage, history and ali of that. We know ali that. What I do wish to stress is one thing we have in common, one desperately important thing, and that is that we have a common fate.'8 A common fate entails common enemies, and a com- mon interest in defeating or containing them. On this reading the Anglo- American relationship was not a sentimental attachment but a combination for a purpose: first a pax anti-Germanica, then a pax anti-Sovietica.9 The relationship was special (as Acheson himself privately conceded), but it was also seamy. It did not arise naturally from an existential sense of community. It had to be nur- tured and, above all, negotiated. The great exemplar of this mode was the late lamented Christopher Thorne, his magnum opus the dense, punning Allies of a kind (1978), a brilliant disquisi- tion on the hybridity and complexity of the wartime relationship after Pearl Harbor, perhaps best encapsulated in his own words as 'remarkably close and yet particularly strained'.'0 With Thorne's untimely death in I992 the mantle passed to David Reynolds, whose strikingly assured debut, The creation of the Anglo-American alliance (I98i), focusing on the formative period I937-4I, was subtided 'a study in competitive co-operation'-the epitome of functional- ism-and whose recent work on the immediately following years, Rich relations (1995), is a masterly examination ofjust how special and also how foreign it was to get'somewhat mixed up together' in such a fashion." 7 The locus classicus is his 'Sinews of peace' speech at Fulton, Missouri, on 5 March 1946, printed in Robert RhodesJames, ed., Churchill speaks (London:Windward, i98i), pp. 876-84.

In keeping with the multiple fractures of the post-Cold War world-as witness the former Soviet Union and the former Yugoslavia-it posits a former Anglo-America. This is not reconstruction but deconstruction. Inverted commas litter the page like ticks.'Specialness' is, and always was, self-deception,'the special relation- ship' not so much a creation as a construct-a British construct, or, to person- alize, a Churchillian one.'3 In this mode Churchill figures more as conjurer than as evangelist. For those of a Terminal persuasion the mythicality is the real- ity. They are interested in Anglo-American make-believe. As at public school, games-playing reveals character. One game in particular has caught the imagi- nation, largely because of its popularity with Harold Macmillan and later, diminuendo, with Margaret Thatcher. The name of the game is Greeks and Romans. At Allied Force Headquarters (AFHQ) in Algiers in I943 the rules were explained to the young Richard Crossman by a worldly-wise Macmillan: 'Remember', he said,'when you go into the Hotel St George, you will regularly enter a room and see an American colonel, his cigar in his mouth and his feet on the table. When your eyes get used to the darkness, you will see in the corner an English cap- tain, his feet down, his shoulders hunched, writing like mad, with a full in-tray and a full out-tray, and no cigar. 'Mr Crossman, you will never call attention to this discrepancy.When you install a sim- ilar arrangement in your own office, you will always permit your American colleague not only to have a superior rank to yourself and much higher pay, but also the feeling that he is running the show. This will enable you to run it yourself. 'We, my dear Crossman, are Greeks in this American empire. You will find the Americans much as the Greeks found the Romans-great big, vulgar, bustling people, more vigorous than we are and also more idle, with more unspoiled virtues but also more corrupt. We must run AFHQ as the Greek slaves ran the operations of the Emperor Claudius.' In another variant from the same period:'These Americans represent the new Roman Empire and we Britons, like the Greeks of old, must teach them how to make it go.'And in the fraught circumstances of I956-7:'We are the Greeks of the Hellenistic age: the power has passed from us to Rome's equivalent, the United States of America, and we can at most aspire to civilise and occasional- ly to influence them.'"4 '2 Christopher Hitchens, Blood, class atid tiostalgia (London: Chatto &amp;Windus, iggo);John Dickie, 'Special' tio tnore (London:Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 1994); and, more ambiguously, Christopher Coker, 'The spe- cial relationship in the I99Os', Ititertiatiotnal Affairs 68: 3, 1992, pp. 407-22.

I If ever there was a Roman, it was George McGhee, Assistant Secretary of State for the Near East, South Asia and Africa I949-5I. In April I95 I these two began talks in the State Department on the ticklish issue of the Iranian oil crisis: that is to say, the Iranian threat to nationalize the Anglo-Iranian oil company, popularly known as 'Anglo-Persian', the forerunner of British Petroleum (BP). Half a century earlier Lord Curzon had written propheticaliy that, once British rule in India was ended,'your ports and your coaling stations, your fortresses and dockyards, your Crown Colonies and protectorates will go too. For either they will be unnecessary, as the toll-gates and barbicans of an Empire that has vanished, or they will be taken by an enemy more powerful than yourselves."6 Anglo- Persian was a toll-gate of Empire. For the British, the oil concession was eco- nomically vital (as a source of foreign exchange as well as oil), though not indis- pensable. For the Americans, locked in the Cold War, Iran itself was a strategic asset. The Iranians for their part wanted the maximum benefit from their own bounty.'7 Here were all the makings of a test case, and one that the British might easily lose. Hence the Anglo-American talks. To all outward appearances, Franks and McGhee were completely incompat- ible. Just thirty-nine, oil-savvy and oil-rich himself, the Assistant Secretary's invincible self-assurance and sharp tongue were enough to give British officials conniption fits. In the privacy of their correspondence, they calied him 'the infant prodigy'.'8 A later generation might have had recourse to 'Indiana Jones'. Like the intrepid archaeologist, however, there was more to George McGhee, D.Phil., than met the eye. A former Rhodes Scholar, he had spent three years as a graduate student at Queen's College, Oxford, completing his doctorate in 1937. After Dallas,Texas, the Southern Methodist University and the University of Oklahoma, immersion in Oxford had a profound effect on him, as it did on the many Rhodes Scholars propelled into government service during the Democratic cycles of the I940S and I96os-Philip Kaiser and Dean Rusk, to name but two. In McGhee's case, one aspect in particular left its mark. At Queen's, as at most Oxford colleges, each student had a'moral tutor' whom he would see regularly, if infrequently, and to whom he could go in case of need, moral or otherwise. McGhee was allocated to an energetic philosophy don hardly older than himself, and yet, as it seemed, infinitely knowledgeable and infinitely wise. This paragon was Oliver Franks, then plying his trade as a disci- ple of John Locke and lecturing, appropriately enough, on God.'9 15 The following section borrows from Alex Danchev, Oliver Fratnks (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1993), pp. I2Iff. i6 Lord Curzon,'The true imperialism', Niteteetnth cetntury 43,January i908, p. 157.

Was this not the very essence of Greeks and Romans-the former, a philosopher, as moral tutor of the latter? Alas, it was not to be. By that time, after a long period of havering by Anglo-Persian-described by their own Labour Advisor as confused, hidebound, small-minded and blind-there was no decent way out. McGhee was genuinely sympathetic, but characteristically direct. The United States was neither willing nor able to pull Britain's chestnuts out of the fire. Anglo-Persian was duly nationalized the following month. In London there was some reflex rattling of sabres-a tinny sound-but over Iranian oil, unlike Egyptian water, the sabres stayed sheathed. In Washington there was only the silent calculation of future dividends. Greeks and Romans was a British conceit,20 shared (or connived at), for a while, by some Americans.As an analogy it leaves a lot to be desired. Historically, it makes no sense. As Robin Edmonds has reminded us-one Greats man reproving another-'not only did they speak different languages. The Romans acquired their eastern provinces by defeating the Greeks in war; and they went on to pillage the immense riches of the Greek world on a vast scale.'2' Moreover, it is inescapably patronizing. The analogy assumes that the Greeks (that is, the British) know best. The central point about the encounter between Franks and McGhee over Anglo-Persian, however, is that it was McGhee who knew better. In reality the American matched none of the stereotypes for which he was so eagerly fitted in London. He was not anti-British, he was not a sim- ple-minded anti-colonialist and he was not (as the Foreign Office charged) an 'appeaser' of Iran. He was simply the expert-a rare bird in Britain, as Correlli Barnett never tires of pointing out.22 Macmillan's conception was pure fantasy. In reality, a civilizing mission was not enough. True Greeks had to get their hands dirty. Even a sub-special conception of this sort carried a further obliga- tion-the capacity to act as well as the audacity to advise. Oliver Franks himself observed wisely that 'in the Anglo-American relationship British policy has to pass the test: can the British deliver?'23 This was an obligation acutely felt. If there is a touchstone of British foreign policy in the pOst-I940 period, it is reli- ability vis-2-vis the United States. Nevertheless, there have been some embar- rassing defaults. In plain truth the British did not have the wherewithal to meet either their obligations or their aspirations..'Never forget the Greeks, Forster,' the poet Constantine Cavafy once admonished E. M. Forster, as if to anticipate the analogy,'Never forget.. that we are bankrupt... .Pray that you-you English with your capacity for adventure-never lose your capital, otherwise you will resem- ble us, restless, shiftless, liars...'24 20 Even Ernest Bevin, that most unlikely Greek, was not immune. 'The United States is a young country and the Administration was too apt to take unreflecting plunges," he told the Indian Prime Minister.'We had made it our business to try to restrain them.'

It is wonderfully revealing of a certain native mentalite, but as a hypothesis on the special relationship it is either irrelevant or redundant. This is not unex- pected. All three modes of scholarship canvassed here-Evangelical, Functional and Terminal-tell us many interesting things about the Anglo-American rela- tionship. None provides us with an adequate account of specialness, and cer- tainly not one that is readily transferable. By common consent the seminal Anglo-American experience was the Second World War, or at least (according to the former element) that part of it which the latter eventually deigned to share.25 Was the Anglo-American relationship special, therefore, in I941? Potentially. In I 942? Emphatically. In I 943? Mostly. In I 944?Vestigially. In I 945? Hardly.That is a summary of the received wisdom. But how can we tell? On what basis can we say that the relationship was special in I942 and not in I945, or even that it was more special in the early I940s than in the early iggos? We have nothing to go on but inverted commas and the two broad categories sug- gested by David Reynolds-quality and importance.26 Can we do better? Is it possible to specify 'special'? The Oxford English Dictionary offers, inter alia,'of such a kind as to exceed or excel in some way that which is usual or common; exceptional in character, quality or degree... admit- ted to particular intimacy; held in particular esteem.. .marked off from others of the kind by having some distinguishing qualities or features; having a distinct or individual character'. Its Anglo-American examples appear under the last of these variants; disappointingly, the earliest is dated I945.What then are the dis- tinguishing features of a special relationship? Are there, in effect, criteria? I pro- pose ten: I. Transparency 6. Clandestinity 2. Informality 7. Reliability 3. Generality 8. Durability 4. Reciprocity 9. Potentiality 5. Exclusivity io. Mythicality Some generalizations about these criteria will be readily apparent. They are derived from the Anglo-American avatar.27 They are highly subjective. To go further, the greatest are perhaps the first and the tenth, transparency and myth- icality. They are purely qualitative. As H. C. Allen has remarked, specialness is a term of art.28 And they are inescapably relative. Notwithstanding the definite 25 For recent interpretations see David Reynolds, et al., eds, Allies at wvar (NewYork: St Martin's, I994). 26 In Reynolds's schema importance relates to the partners themselves and the world at large.

International relationships, like any other kind, may be more or less special. It is a matter of degree; and also a matter of comparison. 'We don't go around saying, yah boo sucks, my relationship is more special than yours,' said a British Foreign Secretary recently.29 Perhaps not. But that is exactly what we' have been thinking, or protesting, for over fifty years. Explicitly or implic- itly, in other words, evaluation makes reference to others. And others are by no means disinterested. In 1993 the US government accidentaliy released a league table of states ranked by 'importance to US interests', according to a State Department study completed the previous year (shortly before the election of Bill Clinton). In order of importance, the top ten were Germany, France, Britain, China,Japan, Russia, Mexico, Israel, Canada, Iraq.3? Clearly one can be important-or be considered important-but not special. Clearly, also, there are a bewildering variety of cases. Some claim specialness Japan).3' Some disclaim specialness (Canada).32 Some are born special (Israel).33 Some have specialness thrust upon them (Germany).34 Some are special, it might be said, in spite of themselves (Russia). If the competing claims can be substantiated-and they are advanced in uncomfortably familiar terms, complete with affinities, aspersions and the obligatory punctuation35-then having a special relationship is not the cultured and culture-specific pastime that the Anglo-Saxon aristos have always imagined. That notion and that type, skewered mercilessly by John le Carre in novel after novel-'Church and Spy Establishment, with uncles who sat on Tory Party committees, and a rundown estate in Norfolk... a strand of the fine- ly spun web of English influence of which we had perceived ourselves the cen- tre';'callow Yale men in button-down shirts who believed they could outwit the worst cut-throats in Latin America and always had six unbeatable argu- ments for doing the wrong thing'-are now out of fashion, perhaps for ever.36 The special relationship is 'our game' no longer. It may be a game of gover- nance, in Richard Neustadt's term, but it is a game that anyone can play-any- one with the right cards and a cool nerve: more Happy Families (or Unhappy Families) than Greeks and Romans.37 But can anyone play?

Where away England, steersman answer me? We cannot tell. For we are all at sea.38 The reductio ad absurdum of such a proposition is that everyone has a special rela- tionship with the United States, because of the overwhelming power or over- weening influence of the latter;39 or that there is no country with which the United Kingdom has not claimed a special relationship at some time in its his- tory;40 or, worse still, that all bilateral international relations are special:4' insights of a kind, no doubt, but analytically barren ones. There is no general theory. At the back of a book on the special relationship between Israel and (West) Germany-two of the more unlikely candidates- Lily Gardner Feldman has attempted'a theoretical framework for special rela- tionships', drawing chiefly on that case history, with some brief reference to others, including the Anglo-American one.42 Feldman is almost alone in try- ing to ground her argument in the existing literature on alliances and integra- tion-a praiseworthy endeavour-but sets about it in a highly self-conscious and mechanistic fashion.43 The result is unrevealing. Though she makes some sharp observations about terminological inexactitude and conceptual confu- sion, often wilful, her strongest suit is exasperation.When it comes to her own analysis, she is more therapist than evangelist. Specialness for Feldman is rather like an affective disorder. It is founded upon 'mutual preoccupation','psycho- logical resonance' and (felt) need. The emphasis is on the emotional over the ideological, the societal over the governmental, the affiliational over the insti- tutional. This is psychic rather than bureaucratic politics, a helpful corrective to the dominant Anglocentric assumption that the parties to a so-called special relationship are either frauds or dupes, and a salutary reminder that sentiment, properly conceived, has a role to play even in a world peopled by the likes of Henry Kissinger-who, incidentally, has more to say for the Anglo-American special relationship than his Bismarckian alter ego might lead one to expect.44 As criteria, however, or simply as characteristics, preoccupation, resonance and need are at once diffuse and differentiated, for Feldman's analysis of the singu- 38 Joyce Cary, To be a pilgrim [1942], reprinted in Triptychl (London: Penguin, i985), p. 498. 39 In a little-noticed passage in his 'Sinews of peace' speech, Churchill made reference to the 'special rela- tions' enjoyed by the United States with both Canada and the South American republics.

This is of course perfectly under- standable, and in the nature of the case almost certainly unavoidable, but it imposes severe restrictions on the general applicability of any theoretical frame- work so derived. Interestingly enough, Feldman's treatment finds an echo in another putative special relationship involving Israel. In the course of his investigation of Israeli-American relations, Abraham Ben-Zevi has constructed a 'special rela- tionship paradigm', juxtaposed with a 'national interest paradigm', in an effort to capture that elusive something for which exponents of the art are always searching-the holy grail of specialness-in this case something more than cold-eyed geo-strategic (or geo-economic) calculation on the part of the United States. According to Ben-Zevi, the elements that merge into the special relationship paradigm reflect a widespread fund of goodwill toward Israel that is not restricted to the Jewish community, and an equally strong and persistent commitment to Israel's continued national existence, integrity, and security. Comprising a cluster of broadly based attitudes that underscore the affinity and similarity between the two states in terms of their pioneering nature and commitment to democracy, this paradigm emerged as a legitimate and pervasive precept as soon as Israel was established in I948.45 For this author, therefore, the key criteria are durability, pervasiveness and legit- imacy. Ben-Zevi, too, holds that the affective domain is crucial. He is investi- gating a relationship that he takes to be special-there is a strong element of circularity here-albeit one undergoing what he calls 'a continuous process of erosion and evaporation', or, in Camille Mansour's word, 'trivialization' (a process both link to the exhaustion of the Manichaean struggle between the United States and the Soviet Union).The peculiar character of this relationship cannot be understood in terms of instrumentality or realpolitik alone. Neither the Soviet ogre nor the Jewish lobby will suffice.The contention here is Martin Wight's:'There are associations between powers that seem to be deeper than formal alliances, to be based on affinity and tradition as much as interest, to be not so much utilitarian as natural.'46 A new paradigm must be called in to redress the balance of the old. These paradigms have their uses, but in Ben-Zevi's work they begin to assume a life of their own. An insidious substitution process takes place, such that it is the paradigms themselves that are said to change, rather than the phenomena they purport to describe. Thus it is not the Israeli-American relationship (or its specialness) that is subject to erosion and evaporation in his account, but the spe- cial relationship paradigm. This is worrying. Paradigms are not politics.They are merely the pets and playthings of political scientists. Abraham Ben-Zevi's pets 45 Ben-Zevi, Utnited States and Israel, pp. 15-I6. 46 Ibid., p. 24; Camille Mansour, Beyotnd alliatnce (NewYork: Columbia University Press, I994). 746</page><page sequence="11">On specialness are inadequately house-trained. Furthermore, the enquiry is as unequal as the relationship. Ben-Zevi's paradigms are paradigms of American behaviour and atti- tudes. Nothing comparable is offered for the other partner in the relationship, and surprisingly little analytical attention is given to the complex question of how the two interact. Ben-Zevi is interested in motives; at any rate, in American motives. He tends to ignore modalities. The effect is to suggest that the charac- ter of the relationship is determined unilaterally, not to say arbitrarily, by the United States. Specialness is like a scarce commodity (or perhaps an illegal sub- stance): rationed and confiscated, hoarded and looted, used and abused, and trad- ed on the black market.Washington is the dealer and the only source of supply. The habit is expensive and hard to break. Cold turkey is worse than Cold War. The peace process holds the fragile hope of eventual detox. Much of this is extremely valuable. At the very least there is an intuitive ten- sion between quality and inequality, as one might say, and it is well to affirm that an international relationship can be at the same time special and unequal. Except perhaps for a certain equality of esteem-if a place can be found for more sentiment-parity is not necessary for speciality. Indeed, inasmuch as the original conception of the special relationship is a twentieth-century hyphen- ation involving the United States (call it x-American), then parity was always more pipe-dream than premise. The closest approximation to full parity ever experienced is the Anglo-American relationship of I94 I-2. American potential was infinitely greater; but the Americans themselves saw that it would take time to realize. Rarely has a great power gone to war in such a state of comprehen- sive unreadiness.The British, by contrast, were already organized, mobilized and tyrannized-but benignly-by the wildcatWinston.47 In their mutual predica- ment, Anglo-American needs matched. Their respective contributions, if not exactly equal, were complementary and necessary. For a long moment London and Washington were totally interdependent, and they knew it. Here was reci- procity in action, the foundation of the pax anti-Germanica.'The perfect alliance would show equality of interest and commitment between the two parties, with a reciprocity of advantage.' Here too was the moment to redeem the expectant promise of the combination from the British point of view: nothing less than a realignment of their relationship with the United States-'no longer a client receiving help from a generous patron, but two comrades fighting for life side by side', in the Prime Minister's post-Pearl Harbor invocation.48 Churchill was always hopeful.'It is difficult to go anywhere in London with- out having the feeling that Britain is now Occupied Territory" wrote George Orwell in December I943.49 He was a good barometer. The British have been occupied in one way or another ever since,'intravenously', in Angela Carter's marvellous metaphor, or otherwise.S?

It is normal to be unequal; yet it seems that prolonged, gross inequality will eventually vitiate speciality. For all Tel Aviv's much-advertised intransigence, there is no denying the pronounced patron-client (or rather client-patron) flavour of Israeli-American relations. It is in fact a highly dependent relationship: a crippling handicap that may well be held to weaken any wider claims. When all is said and done, mendi- cants must mind their manners.The United States has endowed Israel with many things, including life itself. In Washington, Israel may be considered special, just as it was (and is still) considered important. But that is not enough. The character of a relationship cannot be determined unilaterally. If it could, either the relationship would not be special or the specialness would not be a relationship, but merely an imposition. Contrary to popular apper- ception, specialness is not a matter of grace and favour. It is not in the gift of one partner, however strong. It cannot be administered like a drug or a pun- ishment. It is not a commodity or a crime. It is a process: a process of inter- action, laced with expectation. As in life, so in international relations: expectations are crucial. 'There are great possibilities for strain and disappointment in a special relationship, as many can attest, but nothing is resented quite so much as the unfulfilled expectation of being consulted.'5' A willing engagement each with the other, an openness to inspection and objection, and ultimately to influence-in a word, transparency-is an exacting requirement, as the Anglo-American wartime experiment served to demonstrate.52 Notwithstanding the extraordi- nary consonance achieved and sustained, Churchill's high expectations of 'righteous comradeship' were disappointed. His characteristic reproofs to the US President were all variations on the same theme. As early as February 1942: 'The keynote of our relations must surely be equality.' As late as July 1944: 'It is, I am sure, the duty of those who bear our responsibility...to place themselves in a reasonable and equal relationship'.53 But these reproofs were never sent. Certainly Churchill felt resentment, much more than we have supposed. He kept it bottled up, except among his inner circle, because he had to. Squeezed uncomfortably between a great American buffalo on one side and a great Soviet bear on the other, the little British donkey might be the only one that knew the way home (so it thought)-but no one was listening.54James Gould Cozzens's fictionalized portrait is a cruel exposure.

Except as a piece of pohlteness, he did not even sit as an equal. His real job was to palter.'55 The circuit from conjurer to palterer runs the gamut of scepticism about the very idea of specialness. Curiously, scepticism predates specialism. It was not yet I938 when Neville Chamberlain declared his belief that 'it is always best and safest to count on nothing from the Americans except words.'56 The sceptics have always been uncommonly assertive. Their belief-or rather unbelief-is absolute. And be these juggling fiends no more believ'd, That palter with us in a double sense; That keep the word of promise to our ear, And break it to our hope. Macbeth, v.vi. As to the prospect of a special relationship, their expectations are best described as trivial. Their attention wanders. The process of interaction congeals. The resulting relationship is not so much ordinary as absent. With the possible exception of Edward Heath-at a time when it mattered rather less-no British Prime Minister this century has been so conspicuously neglectful, not to say scornful, of the process of interaction with the United States as was Nevilie Chamberlain. The contrast with his successor could not have been more marked. Where Neville was inert, Winston had to be forcibly restrained. No sooner had the Japanese done the dirty deed at Pearl Harbor than he leapt into an ocean liner bound for Washington to confabulate with the President. Alarmingly, he lodged at the White House. The consequences were unpre- dictable, but it worked out well enough. Anglo-American relations were suc- cessfully domesticated. Bath-time at the White House in December 1941 was the apogee of specialness in a hostile world. One morning the Prime Minister wanted to dictate while he was in his bath-not a minute could be wasted-He kept submerging in the bath and when he 'surfaced' he would dictate a few more words or sentences. Eventually he got out of the bath when his devoted valet, Sawyers, draped an enormous bath-towel around him. He walked into his adjoining bedroom, followed by me, notebook in hand, and continued to dic- tate while pacing up and down the enormous room. Eventually the towel fell to the S5James Gould Cozzens, Guard of honour (London: Harcourt, Brace &amp; World, 1948), p. 394.
