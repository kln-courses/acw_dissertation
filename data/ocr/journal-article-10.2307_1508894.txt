<plain_text><page sequence="1">SUMERIAN THEOLOGY AND ETHICS SAMUEL NOAH KRAMER UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA THE SUMERIANS failed to develop a systematic philosophy in the accepted sense of the word. In particular it never occurred to them to raise any questions concerning the fundamental nature of reality and knowledge, and therefore they evolved practically nothing corresponding to the philosophical subdivisions commonly known as metaphysics and epistemology. They did, however, spec- ulate on the nature and, more particularly, the origin of the uni- verse, as well as on its method of operation. And there is good reason to infer that in the course of the third millennium B.C. there emerged a group of Sumerian thinkers and teachers who, in the course of their quest for satisfactory answers to some of the problems raised by their cosmic speculations, evolved a sys- tematic cosmology and theology carrying such high intellectual conviction that they became the basic creed and dogma of much of the ancient Near East. Unfortunately for us these cosmological ideas and theological speculations are nowhere explicitly formulated in philosophical terms and systematic statements. For our ancient Sumerian phi- losophers had failed to discover that all-important intellectual tool which we take more or less for granted: the scientific method of definition and generalization, without which our present day sci- ence would never have reached its acknowledged prominence. To take even so relatively simple a principle as cause and effect, while fully aware of the innumerable concrete examples of its operation, the Sumerian thinker never came upon the idea of formulating it as a general, all-pervading law. Almost all our information con- cerning Sumerian philosophy and theology, cosmology, and cos- mogony, has to be ferreted out and pieced together from the Su- merian literary works, particularly their myths, epic tales, and hymns, and this is a complicated task which permits considerable difference of opinion.' 1 Cf. especially my detailed review of Frankfort, Wilson, Jacobsen, and Irwin's</page><page sequence="2">46 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW First, then, what were some of the "scientific" data at their dis- posal which underpinned their assumptions and led to the narrow- ing down of their philosophical speculations to theological certain- ties? In the eyes of the Sumerian teachers and sages, the major components of the universe in the more narrow sense of the word were heaven and earth; indeed their term for universe was an-ki, "Intellectual Adventure of Ancient Man" (1946) in JCS (Journal of Cuneiform Studies), 2, pp. 39-70. This divergence of views results not so much from differences in translation and interpretation of the texts themselves, as from opposing psycho- logical appraisals of the minds of the ancients. Because our primary source material for Sumerian philosophy and theology are myths rather than philosophic essays, scholars tended to confuse the metaphysician with the theologian, though by and large they are poles apart psychologically and temperamentally. The mythographers were scribes and poets whose main concern was the glorification and exaltation of the gods and their deeds. Unlike the philosophers they were not interested in dis- covering cosmological and theological truths; they accepted the current theological notions and practices without worrying about their origin and development. The aim of the myth makers was to compose a narrative poem in an effort to explain one or another of these notions and practices in a manner that would be appealing, inspiring, and entertaining. They were not concerned primarily with proofs and arguments directed to the intellect; their first interest was in telling a story that would appeal primarily to the emotions. Their main literary tools, therefore, were not logic and reason, but imagination and fantasy. In telling their story, these poets did not hesitate to invent motives and incidents patterned on human action which could not possibly have any basis in reasonable and speculative thought, nor did they hesitate to adopt legendary and folkloristic motifs that had nothing to do with rational cosmological inquiry and inference. It was this failure to distinguish between the Sumerian mythographer and phi- losopher which confused some of the modern students of ancient Oriental thought and led them to both under- and overestimate the minds of the ancients. On the one hand, they argued, the ancients were mentally incapable of thinking logically and reflecting intelligently on cosmic problems. On the other hand they were blessed with an intellectually "unspoiled" mythopeic mind, which was somehow naturally profound and intuitive and which could therefore penetrate cosmic truths far more perceptively than the modern mind with its analytic and intellectual approach. Which, by and large, is just stuff and nonsense. The more mature and reflective Sumerian thinker had the inherent mental capacity of thinking logically and co- herently on any problem, including those concerned with the origin and operation of the universe. His stumbling-block was the dearth of scientific data at his dis- posal. Moreover he lacked such fundamental intellectual tools as definitions and generalizations, and had practically no insight into the processes of growth and de- velopment, since the principle of evolution which seems so obvious now that it has been discovered, was entirely unknown to him. Just so, no doubt, in some future day, with the continued accumulation of new data and the discovery of hitherto undreamt of intellectual tools and perspectives, the limitations and shortcomings of the philosophers and scientists of our own day will become apparent. There is this significant difference, however: modern thinking man is usually prepared to admit the relative character of his conclusions and is sceptical of all absolute an- swers. Not so the Sumerian thinker; he was no doubt convinced that he had the truth "by the tail," and that he knew exactly how the universe was created and operated.</page><page sequence="3">SUMERIAN THEOLOGY AND ETHICS 47 a compound word meaning "heaven-earth." The earth was a flat disk consisting of a vast hollow space enclosed top and bottom by a solid surface in the shape of a vault. Just what this heavenly solid was thought to be is still uncertain; to judge from the fact that the Sumerian term for tin is "metal of heaven," it may have been tin. Between heaven and earth they recognized a substance which they called lil, a word the approximate meaning of which is "wind, air, breath, spirit"; 2 its most significant characteristics seem to be movement and expansion, and it therefore corresponds roughly to our "atmosphere." The sun, moon, planets, and stars were taken to be made of the same stuff as the atmosphere, but endowed, in addition, with the quality of luminosity.3 Surround- ing the "heaven-earth" on all sides, as well as top and bottom was the boundless sea in which the universe somehow remained fixed and immovable. From these basic facts concerning the structure of the universe, facts which seemed to the Sumerian thinkers obvious and indis- putable, they evolved a cosmogony to fit. First, they concluded, was the primeval sea; the indications are that they looked upon the sea as a kind of "first cause" and "prime mover," and that they never asked themselves just what was prior to the sea in time and space. In this primeval sea was somehow engendered the universe, in the narrower sense of the word, the "heaven-earth," consisting of a vaulted heaven super-imposed over a flat earth and united with it. Between them, however, there came the moving and ex- panding "atmosphere" which separated heaven from earth. Out of this atmosphere were fashioned the luminous bodies, the moon, sun, planets, and stars. Following the separation of heaven and 2 In short it has to a certain extent the semantic range of the Hebrew ruach. ' For the origin and nature of the luminous bodies, moon, sun, planet, and star, there is practically no direct evidence at all. But from the fact that as far back as our written sources go, the Sumerian considered the moon-god, known by the two names, Sin and Nanna, to be the son of the air-god Enlil, it is not unreasonable to infer that they thought of the moon as a bright, air-like body which was fashioned in some way from the atmosphere. And since the sun-god Utu, and the Venus- goddess Inanna are always referred to in the texts as children of the moon-god, the probability is that these two luminous bodies were conceived as having been created from the moon after the latter had been fashioned from the atmosphere. This is also true of the remaining planets as well as the stars, which are described poetically as "the big ones who walk about (the moon) like wild oxen," and "the little ones who are scattered about (the moon) like grain."</page><page sequence="4">48 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW earth and the creation of the light-giving astral bodies, plant, ani- mal, and human life came into existence.4 Who now created this universe and kept it operating day in, day out, year in, year out, throughout eternity? From as far back as our written records go, the Sumerian theologian assumed as axio- matic the existence of a pantheon consisting of a group of living beings, man-like in form but superhuman and immortal, who, though invisible to mortal eye, guide and control the cosmos in accordance with well-laid plans and duly prescribed laws.5 Be it the great realms of heaven and earth, sea and air; be it the major astral bodies, sun, moon, and planet; be it such atmospheric forces as wind, storm, and tempest; and finally, to take the earth, such natural entities as river, mountain, and plain, or such cultural entities as city and state, dyke and ditch, field and farm, and even such implements as the pickax, brickmold, and plow - each was 'For fuller details cf. my SM (Sumerian Mythology), pp. 30-75 and JCS, 2, pp. 43-44- 'The Sumerian myths illustrate vividly the anthropomorphic character of the Sumerian gods: even the most powerful and most knowing among them were con- ceived as human in form, thought and deed. Like man they plan and act, eat and drink, marry and raise families, support large households and are addicted to human passions and weaknesses. By and large they prefer truth and justice to falsehood and oppression, but their motives are by no means clear, and man is often at a loss to understand them. They were thought to live on the "mountain of heaven and earth," "the place where the sun rose," at least presumably when their presence is not necessary in the particular cosmic entities over which they had charge. Just how they travelled is by no means certain from the available data; the sun-god in a chariot or, according to another version, by foot; the storm-god, on the clouds; other gods, by boat. But the Sumerian thinkers seem not to have troubled them- selves too much with such "practical" and "realistic" problems. And so we are not informed just how the gods were supposed to arrive at their various temples and shrines in Sumer, and in what fashion they actually did perform such human activi- ties as eating and drinking. The priests presumably saw of course only their statues, which they no doubt tended and handled with great care. But just how the stone, wooden and metal objects were to be conceived as having bone, muscle, and the breath of life - this kind of question never occurred to them. Nor did the Sumerian thinkers seem to be troubled by the inherent contradiction between immortality and anthropomorphism - although the gods were believed to be immortal, they never- theless had to have their sustenance: could become sick to the point of death; fought, wounded, and killed, and presumably could themselves be wounded and killed. No doubt our Sumerian sages developed numerous theological notions in a futile attempt to resolve the inconsistencies and contradictions inherent in a poly- theistic system of religion. But to judge from the available material they probably never wrote them down in systematic form and we will therefore never learn much about them. In any case it is hardly likely that they resolved many of the incon- sistencies. What saved them from spiritual and intellectual frustration was no doubt the fact that many a question which, according to our way of thinking, should have troubled them, never came to their minds.</page><page sequence="5">SUMERIAN THEOLOGY AND ETHICS 49 deemed to be under the charge of one or another anthropomorphic, but superhuman, being who guided its activities in accordance with established rules and regulations." How did this divine pantheon function? In the first place it seemed reasonable to the Sumerian thinker to assume that the deities constituting the pantheon were not all of the same impor- tance or of equal rank. The god in charge of the pickax or brick- mold could hardly be expected to compare with the deity in charge of the sun. Nor could the deity in charge of dykes and ditches be expected to equal in rank the deity in charge of the earth as a whole. Then, too, on analogy with the political organization of the human state, it was natural to assume that at the head of the pan- theon was a deity recognized by all the others as their king and ruler. The Sumerian pantheon was therefore conceived as func- tioning as an assembly with a king at its head, the most important groups in this assembly consisting of seven gods who "decree the fates" and of fifty deities known as "the great gods." But a more significant division set up by the Sumerian theologians within their pantheon is that between creative and non-creative deities, a no- tion arrived at as a result of their cosmological views. For accord- ing to these, the basic components of the cosmos are heaven and earth, sea and atmosphere; every other cosmic phenomenon could exist only within one or another of these realms. Hence it seemed reasonable to infer that the deities in control of heaven and earth, sea and air, were the creating gods and that one or another of these SBehind this axiomatic assumption of the Sumerian theologian no doubt lay a logical if perhaps unformulated inference, since he could hardly have seen any of the human-like beings with his own eyes. Our theologian took his cue from human society as he knew it, and reasoned of course from the known to the unknown. He noted that lands and cities, palaces and temples, fields and farms, in short all imagi- nable institutions and enterprises are tended and supervised, guided and controlled by living human beings; without them lands and cities become desolate, temples and palaces crumble, fields and farms turn to desert and wilderness. Surely, therefore, the cosmos and all its manifold phenomena must also be tended and supervised, guided and controlled by living beings in human form. But the cosmos, being far larger than the sum total of human habitations, and its organization being far more complex, these living beings must obviously be far stronger and ever so much more effective than ordinary humans. Above all they must be immortal; otherwise the cosmos would turn to chaos upon their death and the world would come to an end, alternatives which for obvious reasons did not recommend themselves to the Sumerian metaphysician. It was each of these invisible, anthropomorphic, but at the same time superhuman and immortal beings which the Sumerian designated by his word dingir and which we translate by the word "god."</page><page sequence="6">50 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW four deities created every other cosmic entity in accordance with plans originating with them. Consequently the heaven-god An, the air-god Enlil, the water-god Enki, and the earth-goddess Nin- hursag were treated as the four leading deities of the Sumerian pantheon, and are frequently grouped together as a quartette of deities in a class by themselves.7 As for the creating technique attributed to these deities, our Sumerian philosophers developed a doctrine which became dogma throughout the Near East, the doctrine of the creative power of the divine word. All that the creating deity had to do, according to this doctrine, was to lay his plans, utter the word, and pronounce the name. Similarly the Sumerian theologians adduced what was for them a satisfying metaphysical inference to explain what keeps the cosmic entities and cultural phenomena, once created, operat- ing continuously and harmoniously, without conflict and confu- sion; this is the concept designated by the Sumerian word me, the exact meaning of which is still uncertain. In general it would seem to denote a set of rules and regulations assigned to each cosmic entity and cultural phenomenon for the very purpose of keeping it operating forever in accordance with the plans laid down by the deities creating it.8 But to return to the gods. In the course of the third millennium, we find that there existed among the Sumerians, at least by name, hundreds of deities. We know the names of many of these, not merely from lists compiled in the schools but also from lists of Cf. especially Arno Poebel in his "Historical Texts" (Publications of the Baby- lonian Section of the University Museum, IV, part i), p. 24 ff. and JCS, 2, pp. 47- 48, note 16. s In short, another superficial but evidently not altogether ineffective answer to the insoluble cosmological problems, which merely hid the fundamental difficulties from view with the help of largely meaningless words. In the case of the me's gov- erning man and his culture, we actually have considerable direct evidence of their supposed number and character. For fortunately for us, one of the ancient Sumerian poets, in the course of comparing or redacting one of his myths, found it desirable to actually list all these cultural me's. He therefore divided civilization as he knew it into over one hundred elements. Unfortunately only some sixty-odd are at present intelligible, and even of these some are only bare words which because of lack of context give but a hint of their real significance. Nevertheless enough remains to show the character and import of this first recorded attempt at culture analysis resulting in a considerable list of what are now generally termed culture traits and complexes; as will be seen, these consist of various institutions, priestly offices, ritualistic paraphernalia, mental and emotional attitudes, as well as sundry beliefs and dogmas.

Many of these deities are secondary; that is, they are the wives and children and servants of the major deities, thought up for them on the human pattern. Others are perhaps names and epithets of well known deities which we cannot at present identify. But quite a large number of deities were actually worshipped throughout the year with sacrifices, adoration, and prayer. Of all these hundreds of deities, as already stated, the four most important were the heaven-god, An, the air- god, Enlil, the water-god, Enki, and the great mother-goddess, Ninhursag. They usually head the god-lists and are often listed as a group performing significant acts together; at divine meetings and banquets they take the seats of honor. An, the heaven-god, there is good reason to believe, was at one time conceived by the Sumerians as the supreme ruler of the pan- theon, although in our available sources reaching to about 2500 B.C. it is the air-god, Enlil, who seems to have taken his place as the leader of the pantheon. The city state in which An had his main seat of worship was called Uruk or, as it is vocalized in the Bible, Erech, a city which played a preeminent political r1le in the history of Sumer and where, not long before the Second World War, a German expedition uncovered hundreds of small clay tab- lets inscribed with semi-pictographic signs, which date from about 3000 B.C., not long after writing was first invented. An continued to be worshipped in Sumer throughout the millennia but he lost much of his prominence. He became a rather shadowy figure in the pantheon, and he is rarely mentioned in the hymns and in the mytho-epic tales of later days; by that time most of his powers had been conferred upon the god Enlil.9 By far the most important deity in the Sumerian pantheon, one who played a dominant r61e throughout in rite, myth, and prayer, was the air-god, Enlil.

But from the earliest intelligible records, Enlil is known as "the father of the gods," "the king of heaven and earth," "the king of all the lands." Kings and rulers boast that it is Enlil who has given them the kingship of the land, who has made the land prosperous for them, who gave them all the lands to conquer by his strength. It is Enlil who pronounces the king's name and gives him his scepter, and looks upon him with favorable eye. From later myths and hymns we learn that Enlil was conceived as a most beneficent deity who was responsible for the planning and creating of most productive features of the cosmos. He was the god who "made the day come forth," who took pity on humans, who laid the plans which brought forth all seeds, plants, and trees from the earth. It was he who established plenty, abundance, and pros- perity in the land, and who fashioned the pickax and the plow as the prototypes of the agricultural implements to be used by man.10 One of the most important hymns to Enlil and indeed one of the most remarkable of all Sumerian hymns is now being pieced to- gether from a number of tablets and fragments by Thorkild Jacob- sen and myself. Several years ago, while working in the Istanbul Museum of the Ancient Orient, I was fortunate enough to identify the lower half of a four-column tablet whose upper half is in our Museum in Philadelphia, and had been published many years ago by the late Stephen Langdon." And several years ago, the joint 10 I stress the beneficent features of Enlil's character in order to correct a mis- conception which has found its way into practically all handbooks and encyclopedias treating Sumerian religion and culture, that Enlil was a violent and destructive storm deity whose word and deed practically always brought nothing but evil. As not infrequently happens, this misunderstanding is due largely to an archaeological accident. For it happened that among the earliest Sumerian compositions published, there were an unusually large proportion of lamentation type, in which of necessity Enlil had the unhappy duty of carrying out the destruction and misfortunes decreed by the gods for one reason or another. As a result he was stigmatized as a fierce and destructive deity by earlier scholars and he has never lived this down. Actually, when we analyze the hymns and myths, some of which have been published only in recent days, we find Enlil glorified as a most friendly fatherly deity who watches over the safety and well-being of all humans, and particularly of course over the inhabitants of Sumer.

The third of the Sumerian leading deities is Enki, the god in charge of the abyss, or as the Sumerian word for it reads, the abzu. Enki is the god of wisdom par excellence; it is primarily Enki who organizes the earth, in accordance with the decisions of Enlil who only makes the general plans, as it were. The actual details and execution are left primarily to Enki, the resourceful, skilful, hardy and wise.12 Fourth among the creating deities is the mother-goddess Nin- hursag, also known as Ninmah - "the exalted lady." In an earlier day this goddess was even of a higher rank and her name often precedes that of Enki in the various god-lists. There is reason to believe that her name had originally been Ki "earth," and that she was thus taken to be the consort of An "heaven," the couple that presumably were the parents of all the gods.-3 She was also known as Nintu, "the lady who gave birth"; all the early Sumerian rulers like to describe themselves as "nourished by the trustworthy milk of Ninhursag." In brief, Ninhursag was conceived as the mother of all living things, the mother-goddess par excellence.'4 Turning from theology to ethics, it will not be surprising to find that, as in the case of philosophy, the Sumerian thinkers and sages evolved no explicit system of moral laws and principles, and pro- duced no formal treatise on ethics. What is known about Sumerian ethics and morals must be ferreted out of the extant Sumerian writ- ings, primarily hymns in this case, rather than myths, and such varied documents as votive inscriptions and law-codes.

They were firmly convinced that man was fashioned of clay and created for one purpose only: to serve the gods by supplying them with food, drink and shelter, so that they might have full leisure for their divine activities. His life was beset with uncertainty and haunted by insecurity, since he did not know beforehand the des- tiny decreed for him by the unpredictable gods. When he dies, his emasculated spirit descends to the dark, dreary nether-world where life is but a dismal and wretched reflection of its earthly counter- part. One fundamental moral problem, a high favorite with Western philosophers, never troubled the Sumerian thinkers at all, namely the delicate and rather slippery problem of free will. Convinced beyond all need for argument that man was created by the gods solely for their benefit and leisure, they accepted their dependent status just as they accepted the divine decision that death is man's lot and that only the gods are immortal. All credit for the high moral qualities and ethical virtues which the Sumerians had no doubt evolved gradually and painfully over the centuries from their social and cultural experiences, was attributed to the gods; it was the gods who planned it that way, and man was only follow- ing divine orders. The Sumerians, according to their own records, cherished good- ness and truth, law and order, justice and freedom, righteousness and straightforwardness, mercy and compassion, and naturally abhorred their opposites: evil and falsehood, lawlessness and dis- order, injustice and oppression, sinfulness and perversity, cruelty and pitilessness. Kings and rulers in particular boast constantly of the fact that they have established law and order in the land, protected the weak from the strong, the poor from the rich, and wiped out evil and violence. In one unique and precious document, the Lagashite ruler, Urukagina, who lived before 2300 B.C., proudly records that he restored justice and freedom to the long- suffering citizens, did away with ubiquitous and oppressive offi- cials, put a stop to injustice and exploitation, protected the widow and the orphan.15 Less than four centuries later, Ur-Nammu, the " Cf. now my "Sumerian Historiography" in Israel Exploration Journal, 3, pp. 227 ff.</page><page sequence="13">SUMERIAN THEOLOGY AND ETHICS 57 founder of the Third Dynasty of Ur, promulgated his law-code which lists in its prologue some of his ethical achievements: he did away with a number of prevalent bureaucratic abuses, regu- lated weights and measures to insure honesty in the market place, saw to it that the widow, the orphan, and the poor were protected from ill-treatment and abuse.16 Some two centuries later Lipit- Ishtar of Isin promulgated a new law-code in which he boasts that he was especially selected by the great gods An and Enlil for "the princeship of the land in order to establish justice in the lands, to banish complaints, to turn back enmity and rebellion by force of arms, and to bring well-being to the Sumerians and Akkadians." 17 The hymns of quite a number of Sumerian rulers abound in similar claims of high ethical and moral conduct.'s The gods too according to the Sumerian sages preferred, of course, the ethical and moral to the unethical and immoral, and practically all the major deities of the Sumerian pantheon are extolled in their hymns as lovers of the good and the just, of truth and righteousness. Indeed, there were several deities who had the supervision of the moral order as their main function; the sun-god Utu, for example.19 Another deity, a Lagashite goddess by the name of Nanshe, had also been sporadically mentioned in the texts as particularly devoted to truth, justice and mercy. But it is only now that we are beginning to get some adequate idea of the sig- nificant r1le played by this goddess in the sphere of man's ethical and moral conduct. At this moment a Sumerian hymn,20 consisting of approximately 250 lines, is being pieced together by Jacobsen and myself from 19 tablets and fragments excavated in Nippur; it includes some of the most explicit and detailed ethical and moral statements as yet found formulated in the Sumerian docu- ments.

In a passage the meaning of which is still largely obscure, she is pictured as judging mankind on New Year's day; by her side are Nidaba, the goddess of writing and accounts, and Nidaba's husband Haia, as well as numerous witnesses. The evil human types who suffer her displeasure are: (People) who walking in transgression (?) reached out with high hand .... , Who transgress the established norms, violate contracts, Who looked with favor on the places of evil,.... , Who substituted (?) a small weight for a large weight, Who substituted (?) a small measure for a large measure,.... Who having eaten (something not belonging to him) did not say "I have eaten it," Who having drunk, did not say "I have drunk it," ...., Who said "I would eat that which is forbidden," Who said "I would drink that which is forbidden." Nanshe's social conscience is further revealed in lines which read: To comfort the orphan, to make disappear the widow, To set up a place of destruction for the mighty, To turn (?) over (?) the mighty to the weak,.... Nanshe searches the heart of the people. Unfortunately, although the leading deities were assumed to be ethical and moral in their conduct, the fact remained that in ac- cordance with the world-view of the Sumerians, these were the very gods who, in the process of establishing civilization, had also planned evil and falsehood, violence and oppression, in short, all the immoral and unethical mode of human conduct. Thus, for example, among the list of me's, the rules and regulations devised by the gods to make the cosmos run smoothly and effectively, there are not only those which regulate "truth," "peace," "good- ness," "justice," etc., but also those which govern "falsehood,"</page><page sequence="15">SUMERIAN THEOLOGY AND ETHICS 59 "strife," "lamentation," "fear," etc. But then why did the gods find it necessary to plan and create sin and evil, suffering and mis- fortune altogether --so much so that one Sumerian pessimist could say: "Never has a sinless child been born to his mother"? To judge from our available material, the Sumerian sages, if they asked the question at all, were prepared to admit their ignorance in this respect: the will of the gods and their motives were at times inscrutable. The proper course for a Sumerian "Job" to pursue was not to argue and complain in the face of seemingly unjusti- fiable misfortune, but to plead and wail, and lament and confess his inevitable sins and failings. But will the gods give heed to him, a lone and not very effective mortal even if he prostrates and humbles himself in heartfelt prayer? Probably not, it seemed to the Sumerian teachers - as they saw it, gods were like the mortal rulers the world over, and no doubt had more important things to attend to; and so, as in the case of kings, and kings of kings, man must have an intermediary to intercede on his behalf, one whom the gods would be willing to hear and favor. As a result the Sumerian thinkers contrived the notion of a personal god, a kind of good angel to each particular individual and family-head, his divine father who had begot him, as it were. It is to him, to his personal deity, that the individual sufferer bared his heart, wept bitter tears, and made his prayers. Just how this personal god was selected by a particular individual is uncertain, but we actually have the names of the personal gods of a number of Sumerian rulers from the second half of the third millennium B.C. Moreover, only recently, a Sumerian poetic es- say 21 has been pieced together from five Nippur tablets and frag- ments which deals to some extent with the problem of human suffering, and which reveals the all important r6le played by the personal god in the life of the individual. The tablets, to judge from their script and other criteria, were actually inscribed, roughly speaking, about 1700 B.C., but the date of the original composition of the essay may have been considerably earlier, per- haps as early as the Third Dynasty of Ur, about 2000 B.C. 1 Cf.

To prove his point our author does not resort to philosophical speculation and theological argumenta- tion. Instead, with characteristic Sumerian practicality, he cites a case: Here is a man, unnamed to be sure, who had been wealthy, wise and righteous, or at least seemingly so, and blest with both friends and kin. One day sickness and suffering overwhelmed him. Did he defy the divine order and blaspheme? Not at all! He came humbly before his god with tears and lamentation, and poured out his heart in prayer and supplication. As a result his god was highly pleased and moved to compassion; he gave heed to his prayer, de- livered him from his misfortunes, and turned his suffering to joy. Structurally speaking, the poem seems to consist of four sec- tions. First comes a brief introductory exhortation that man should praise and exalt his god and soothe him with lamentations. The poet then introduces the unnamed individual who, upon being smitten with sickness and misfortune, addresses his god with tears and prayers. There follows the sufferer's petition which consti- tutes the major part of the poem. It begins with a description of the ill-treatment accorded him by his fellow men - friend and foe alike; continues with a lament against his bitter fate, in- cluding a rhetorical request to his kin and to the professional singers to do likewise; and concludes with a confession of guilt and a direct plea for relief and deliverance. Finally comes the "happy ending," in which the poet informs us that the man's prayer did not go unheeded, and that his god accepted the en- treaties and delivered him from his afflictions. All of this leads of course to a further glorification of his god. To illustrate the mood and temper of the poem, here is a tenta- tive translation of its more intelligible passages. Part of the suf- ferer's petition runs as follows: "I am a man, a discerning one, (yet) who respects (?) me prospers (?) not, My righteous word has been turned into a lie,</page><page sequence="17">SUMERIAN THEOLOGY AND ETHICS 61 The man of deceit has covered me (with) the Southwind, I (am forced to) serve him, Who respects (?) me not has shamed me before you.

They say - the valiant sages --a word righteous and straightfor- ward: 'Never has a sinless child been born to its mother, .... a sinless youth has not existed from of old.' So much for the man's prayer and supplication; the "happy ending" follows and reads: The man - his god harkened to his bitter tears and weeping, The young man - his lamentation and wailing soothed the heart of his god.
