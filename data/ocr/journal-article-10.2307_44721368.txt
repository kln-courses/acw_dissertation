Shatsky Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute, Defense Nuclear Agency THE USE OF X-RAY CINEMATOGRAPHY for the study of movement of the internal organs of the human body is an old concept, initially proposed by Maclntyre in 1897, less than two years after Roentgen's discovery of the x-ray. (1)* To- day, cinematography has become a routine procedure in med- ical radiology; however, the use of x-ray cinematography for the study of high-speed events, such as impact trauma, is quite recent. It differs significantly from other cinematographic procedures in radiology in that the main emphasis is on record- ing and resolving displacement of structures over small dis- tances and during very small intervals of time. This requires ultrashort exposure times, high frame rates, and high radia- tion dose rates. BACKGROUND METHODS OF X-RAY CINEMATOGRAPHY - There are two general approaches to x-ray cinematography, a direct and an indirect method (2). The direct approach, cineradiography, consists of sequentially exposing full -sized x-ray plates. The indirect method, referred to as cinefluorography, is the record- ing of changing fluorescent screen images with a motion cam- era. The essential difference is where the final image is stored, on full-sized x-ray plates, or cinefilm strips. The chief advan- tage of the former is the production of high-quality radio- graphic images, while the latter is more suitable for high rep- *Numbers in parentheses designate References at end of paper. etition rates and normally produces usable radiographic images at approximately an order of magnitude lower radiation dose per frame (3). The direct method is the older and simpler, and was tirst in- vestigated by Maclntyre (1). Fig. 1 diagramatically illustrates such a system, which consists of an electronic pulse genera- tor, a remote x-ray tube, and a rotating drum or other device for moving full-sized x-ray cassettes into position between se- quential exposures. These systems require 100-500 nC/kg (400 uR-2mR) at the film plane, depending upon specific film and screen combinations, to produce correctly exposed radiographic images (3). They have the advantage of high resolution (typically 6-14 lp/mm), large format or image size (8 X 10 to 14 X 17 in), and ease of film readability (4). The direct method is widely used and is the standard procedure for vascular radiology in which low repetition rates are suffi- cient. It is not, however, easily adapted to high-frame -rat e applications due to the physical problem of moving large x-ray cassettes in short time intervals. This severely limits both the maximal repetition rate and the total number of films avail- able for information storage. The present maximum for a functional cineradiographic device is four to eight films at a 250 frames/s repetition rate (5). The second form of roentgen cinematography system re- cords radiographic images by indirect techniques. The earli- est of these was the cinephotography of changing fluorescent screen images and had the major disadvantage of requiring high radiation dose rates with even the most efficient optical systems and film emulsions available (2). The introduction by Coltman, in 1948, of the fluoroscopic image intensifier dras- ABSTRACT This paper discusses flash x-ray cinematography techniques and equipment used to record high-speed motions occurring during impact injury. Cineangiography studies of the aortic arch, cardiac ventricle, and intracranial arteries are presented. The paper gives a brief review of x-ray cinematography sys- tems and various high-speed applications of them, and the need for quantitative information of visceral and vascular movements during impact trauma is emphasized. 3235</page><page sequence="2">3236 S. A. SHATSKY tically reduced the radiation dose requirements to produce in- formation-carrying photofluorographic images and allowed these systems to become much more widely applied (6). Such systems require approximately 2.5-25 nC/kg (10-100 uR) at the x-ray detector to expose an informational frame, depend- ing upon the specific film format (16-70 mm) and speed, as well as the conversion efficiency of the fluorescent screen, light gain of the image amplifier, and speed of optics (3). The minimum usable dose is determined by the quantum noise or statistical fluctuation of image forming x-ray quanta. The overall system resolution is determined by this, as well as the resolutions, or more properly, modulation transfer functions of the fluorescent screen, image amplifier, lens, camera, and film at the frame rate utilized (4, 7). Typical system resolu- tions vary from 1 .5-4.0 lp/mm, the highest using large film formats and higher radiation doses to minimize film grain and quantum mottle. Fig. 2 shows the conceptually simplest modern cinefluoro- graphic system. Its key components are an electronic pulse generator, a remote x-ray tube, a fluoroscopic screen, a light- amplifying device, and a high-speed recording camera. Such indirect cinefluorographic systems have many inherent advan- tages: film transport is simple and rapid, low radiation doses are required, large fluoroscopic screens can provide extensive viewing areas, and large numbers of frames may be exposed.

Image amplifiers may be used to augment the low-level screen brightness and minimize radiation requirements Use of these systems in high-frame-rate applications, however, requires specific equipment modifications. The most critical modification is that the fluorescent screens and image ampli- fiers must erase rapidly enough between successive frames to avoid ghosting or image stacking. This can be accomplished by using a calcium tungstate or alkali halide fluorescent screen, and one of three types of image amplifiers: a one-stage micro- channel plate with the standard P-20 output phosphor, or either a three-stage electrostatic or magnetic focus device mod- ified with short decaying phosphors, such as P-15, 16, 36, or 37 (7). Many cameras are now available for high-speed appli- cations, and the exact frame rate and film size required deter- mines selection. Fig. 3 illustrates a physically simpler cinefluorographic sys- tem in which an x-ray image intensifier incorporates the fluo- roscopic screen and a one-stage electrostatic image amplifier into a single vacuum envelope. It is the design of the present system and is adaptable to high-frame-rate operation. The camera and x-ray source can be identical to the previous de- sign, and some modern alkali halide x-ray image intensifiers may be used unmodified for rates in excess of 1000 frames/s, although their transfer functions and therefore resolution di- minish at these rates. Fig. 4 shows a more advanced, standard medical fluoro- graphic system, combining the direct x-ray image intensifier with a television pickup and monitor. In practice, it usually X-RAY IMAGE p*.

The basic advantages of the television system are that it allows remote viewing, wide image contrast and gain control, and ease of image storage, retrieval, and reprojection. They have limited application, however, to high-speed opera- tion chiefly because of the slow response time of antimony trisulfide, which is the normal photosensitive layer of the vidicon pickup tubes (3). This may be replaced with the more rapid lead oxide, but the television's electron scan, or writing rate will still limit the maximum frame capability to 60 images/s. Above this rate, conventional television systems are no longer usable, and either electrostatic storage tubes or specially designed scanning systems must be used to record images, with later video projection at normal rates. HIGH-FRAME-RATE SHUTTER MECHANISMS - In order to record motion events on film, a shuttering mechanism must be used to separate sequential frames. In the cine system illustrated in Fig. 2, the different design alternatives can best be seen. The simplest possibility is to operate the x-ray beam in the d-c mode or continuously expose the subject as in visual fluoroscopic examination. As the subject moves, chang- ing radiographic images are presented to the fluoroscopic screen and visible images are presented to the intensifier and camera. Photographing the intensifier screen with a shutter camera will provide separation of the sequential images or frames. Another choice is to have the image amplifier gated or electronically turned on and off, functionally acting as a shutter for cinefilm on a streak or shutterless camera. In both alternatives, the subject is receiving radiation from which no recording is done nor information gathered. The longer the interframe period compared to the frame exposure time, the more needless subject radiation exposure. However, there exist other available alternatives. The x-ray source itself may be used as a strobe to stop motion and become the overall system shutter. There exist three present methods to accom- plish this. The source may operate in the d-c mode and be physically shuttered by a rotating lead shield, it may be elec- tronically pulsed as in standard equipment, or it may be repet- itively flashed. The latter two are the most desirable alterna- tives from a radiation hazard standpoint. FLASH X-RAY CINEMATOGRAPHY - A fundamental dif- ference between x-ray generation from a gated d-c system versus a flash x-ray unit is the inherent submicrosecond pulse duration in the latter, with a fixed radiation output per pulse. The former is capable of producing essentially a continuum of pulse durations, with the radiation output inversely propor- tional to pulse width. The minimum usable repetitive pulse width for cinefluorographic exposures is approximately 0.1 ms for the gated d-c mode, whereas flash systems normally produce this quantity of radiation in 10-100 ns pulse widths (8). The ultrashort pulse duration allows these beams to be used for the radiographic study of hypervelocity events covering velocities of a few millimeters per microsecond, such as charge detonations, in-flight ballistics, and shock wave propagation. While these velocities far exceed those occurring in blunt im- pact trauma, the same stop motion effect is desirable for the resolution of interior small structure movements. For example, for a subject traveling at right angles to and immediately in front of an x-ray screen, the motion blur, or distance traveled during the exposure time, must be smaller than the diameter of the smallest interior structure to be resolved. Consider an acceleration sled subject moving 50 mph, or 20 mm/ms. If the interior line structures, as 0.2 mm intracranial blood ves- sels are to be resolved, the maximal allowable exposure time would be 10 ¡is. This would just allow the blood vessel to travel its own diameter during the exposure time. For sharper resolution, the distance traveled should be maximally 10-50% the diameter. The feasibility of a cine flash x-ray system was originally discussed by Sellier in 1965 and Mattsson in 1966 (9, 10). However, the first workable system was designed by Char- bonnier in December 1971 , and assembled by our group at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in April 1972 (7, 8). This initial prototype was a 150 kVp system operable to 500 images/s for 10 frames. It suffered, however, from severe X-RAY IMAGE ř J INTENSIFIER J X.RAY PULSE / ( ļ e GENERATOR 'Vf V J.L ' I TV MONITOR Fig. 4 - A vidicon tube scans the output of an x-ray image intensifier.

A. SHATSKY image stacking above 200 frames/s in which discrete double and triple images were present on cineframes, rather than blurred single images. The second device was a 350 kVp sys- tem, assembled in December 1972, which demonstrated that image ghosting could be eliminated for operation to 1000 frames/s by the use of a rapidly erasing alkali halide x-ray image intensifier. The third and most advanced prototype incorporated both the 150 and 350 kVp pulsers into a single system and extended the number of usable frames to 100. It is shown in Fig. 5 and consists of four major components: an electronic pulse generator, a remote flash x-ray generator, an x-ray image intensifier, and a high-speed camera. The electronic pulse generator is specially designed Field Emission 760/273 and includes the high-voltage power supply, LC charging networks, and the control, synchronization, and trigger circuitry (11). The remote flash x-ray generator con- tains two separate flash x-ray pulsers and their respective tubes. The 150 kVp puiser is the Field Emission 815 which delivers 125 nC/kg(0.5 mR) at 1 m with a median energy of 35 keV in a 30 ns pulse duration (8). The 350 kVp puiser is the Field Emission 273 which produces 500 nC/kg(2.0mR) at 1 m with a median energy of 50 keV in a 50 ns pulse dura- tion (8). The radiation is detected by a 9 in Varian VXI 155 Cesium Iodide x-ray image intensifier, which has a measured light gain of 8650 and a resolution of 2.9 lp/mm (12). The final image is recorded on 1 6 mm cinefilm by a high-speed Photosonics 1W pin register camera operating at up to 1000 Fig. 5 - The prototype flash x-ray cinematography system has four components. At right foreground is the Field Emission 760/273 con- trol cabinet with high voltage power supply, pulse generator, syn- chronization, and trigger circuitry. At right rear are the two flash x-ray generators with the 150 kVp tube mounted above the 350 kVp unit. At center, is a Varian VXI 155 x-ray image intensifier, and at left is the Photosonics 16-1 W high-speed pin register camera.

The camera shutter is electronically synchro- nized to trigger the x-ray generators. The present flash x-ray cinematography system was as- sembled as a prototype with each component subsystem rep- resenting the existing state-of-the-art technologies. Each major component, the pulse generators, flash x-ray generators, image intensifier, and pin register camera have separately limited the system to a maximum rate of approximately 1000 frames/s (8). The Field Emission 760/273 pulse generator uses an LC charging network with an 800 ps time constant (11). This limits its maximum repetition rate to approximately 1250 pulses/s. Use of shorter time constants would allow higher repetition rates, but would also require major changes in cir- cuitry. The Field Emission flash x-ray pulsers are based upon mul- tiple-stage Marx surge generators. These are limited by the refire times of their spark gaps to operational rates of 1200/s (7), though their maximum achievable rates are at least 5000/s. X-ray image intensifies are presently the major repetition rate-limiting component of this cinefluorographic system. Their response to short-pulse intense radiation fields is still unknown and is presently being evaluated here for the first time. The modern alkali halide devices excite and decay, or form and erase images, rapidly. Typically, these have less than 0.8% initial brightness retained at 1 ms following 100 pR/30 ns flash irradiation. Previously tested Gd2C&gt;2S:Tb de- vices were 1.5 orders of magnitude slower, and suffered severe image stacking above 200 frames/s (7). The present CSI image tubes exhibit no discernible image stacking at 1000 frames/s; however, at both high-frame and high-dose rates (&gt;100 juR/frame), complex defocusing phenomena occur which result in progressive image degradation. This effect must be understood more adequately before higher frame rates are attainable. The final repetition rate-limiting factor is the camera de- sign. The most optically efficient motion camera design with the best resolution characteristics is the pin register or in- termittent type. The fastest existing of these is the 16 mm Photosonics 1W (13), which we are presently using at its maxi- mum rate (1000 frames/s). Above this, many 16 mm rotary prism cameras are usable to 10,000 frames/s and several drum cameras to a few million frames per second. However, both of these latter designs have inefficient optical systems with decreased image steadiness, peripheral image degradation, and lower resolution. They would be required for cinefluo- rography above 1000 frames/s. METHODS The MB3 impact sled shown in Fig. 6 was used to induce graded impacts in small primates for these studies. The cine- fluorographic system is aligned at its terminal end, with the x-ray beam perpendicular to the direction of travel. This allowed cinearteriographic studies in the lateral projection for forward and backward motion and A-P or P-A studies for motions along the coronal plane.</page><page sequence="5">FLASH X-RAY CINEMATOGRAPHY 3239 Fig. 6 - The MB3 impact sled is 3.0 m long. Accelerating weights of 1-15 kg produce terminal veloc ities to 7 m/s. Decelerations in the primary axis are measured on the skull vertex by miniature Entran EGB accelerometers, and range 20-1000 g for 1-2 ms. Force of impact is mea- sured on a BLH 2CM1 load cell and ranges 50-600 lb for head impacts and 100-300 lb for chest impacts. Both sensors are radiation hardened, and data are recorded directly on a Visicorder Oscillograph. The prototype flash x-ray cinematography system is aligned at the ter- minal end of this sled, perpendicular to the axis of travel Three healthy adult Macacca mulatta monkeys weighing 2.5-4.0 kg were anesthetized with chlorolose and prepared under sterile surgical conditions with plastic femoral arterial and venous catheters. A single soft plastic catheter was placed in the common carotid artery. Under direct fluoroscopic con- trol, the soft plastic catheter was advanced to the aortic arch in the first primate, the cardiac ventricle in the second, and the internal carotid artery in the last. The animals were then restrained in plastic chairs and placed on the impact sled. They were slowly accelerated to a terminal velocity of 5 m/s. One-half second prior to impact, 20% thorium dioxide was pressure injected into the carotid catheter. Ten milliseconds prior to injury, a 1000 frames/s cine arteriogram was begun and continued for 100 ms. Following injury, each animal was clinically examined and later sacrificed for correlative pathology. RESULTS It was technically feasible to demonstrate by high-speed cinefluorography, rapid small anatomic changes which oc- curred during experimental impact sequences. Contrast media-filled blood vessels were resolved to a minimum diame- ter of 300 jLtm during these sequences. Large, relatively slow displacements of the anterior chest wall, cardiac ventricle, and aortic arch were demonstrated during two sublethal thoracoab- dominal impacts. Smaller, more rapidly occurring distortions of the intracranial vascular anatomy were seen during a non- lethal, nonfracturing, blunt head impact. Fig. 7 shows six selected cineframes of a laterally viewed aortogram, recorded during deceleration sled impact trauma. The primate sustained a blunt thoracoabdominal impact of 175 lb peak load for 25 ms at the level of the diaphragm. The films demonstrate an initial posterior superior displacement of the contrast media-filled aortic arch, followed by a later tem- porary occlusion of the midthoracic aorta.

Fig. 8 is a series of six cineframes of a lateral cardiac ventric- ulogram. It demonstrates well the relationships between the anterior chest wall, cardiac ventricle, aorta, thoracic vertebrae, and the diaphragm during anterior chest impacts. The impact load is 205 lb peak for 22 ms. The anatomic sequence shown is an initial inbending of the anterior chest wall, followed by a progressive posterior displacement of the cardiac ventricle. The ventricle is distorted and finally pressed against the verte- bral bodies before the compression phase ends and the thorax returns to nearly normal volume. Fig. 9 is an anterior posterior projection of an internal corotid arteriogram, examined during a temporoparietal head impact. The g load was 550 g of 1 .5 ms duration. The in- tracranial anatomy appears normal in the cinephoto graphs prior to impact. However, within the first millisecond, (frame D) a change in the contour of the midline anterior cerebral artery is visible. This indicates an acute herniation of the cingulate gyrus under the falx cerebri, which is maintained, in the next frames as the skull begins a complex pattern of rota- tion and lateral flexion. The corotid arteriogram returns to its Fig. 9 - An anesthetized primate traveling 5 m/s impacts at the tem- poro parietal skull. The normal anatomy, including midline anterior cerebral artery (arrow), and candelabra pattern of the middle cerebral artery are well visualized in the three frames before impact. Less well seen are the bilateral posterior cerebral vessels. The impact is dem- onstrated at frame D, labeled as time zero. A very early change is the bowed configuration of the anterior cerebral artery (arrow). Follow- ing this the head begins a complex pattern of rotation and lateral flexion, during which all vascular patterns remain identifiable normal preimpact anatomy within 10 ms of injury, demon- strating the herniation is a transient phenomena and would be undetectable radiographically following injury. DISCUSSION The primary purpose of x-ray cinematography of impact situations is to directly observe, record, and analyze the se- quence of internal organ injury. The precise mechanisms of injury can now be worked out by documenting and quantita- ting the interior visceral movements which occur. Actual dose response curves may then be developed relating biomechanical impact parameters to specific organ displacements. These may be computed directly by projecting the cineframes on amo- tion analyzer and recording two-dimensional organ coordinates frame by frame throughout the impact sequence. Displace- ments are calculated directly on a millisecond time scale, and electronic differentiation of these data will give the changing velocities and accelerations of the interior structures during injury. One weakness in this analysis is that inferences about three- dimensional motions are being made from two-dimensional observations. This may be eliminated with the use of a bi-</page><page sequence="7">FLASH X-RAY CINEMATOGRAPHY 324i plane radiographic system, with two x-ray beams and two detectors oriented at right angles to one another. However, there are technical problems with such a system in that it would greatly limit subject movement, worsen geometric reso- lution, and introduce scatter radiation to degrade final image quality. While it is possible to construct a biplane flash x-ray cinematography system, an alternate, intermediate approach would be to rigidly quantitate only those movements which are known to be coplanar. The cine sequences presented are preliminary studies, repre- senting not only our earliest efforts at examining impact in- jury by these techniques but the first sequential flash radio- graphic observations made of such events. Undoubtedly, resolution will improve as the best image intensifier, lens, and film combinations are determined. However, they do demon- strate the technical feasibility of recording small internal move- ments of anatomic structures in live primates during moderate velocity impacts. This technique is one that can easily be applied to study a whole group of other impact situations in which the mecha- nisms are not recordable through visual photography. It is not limited to animal research as the radiation levels are not hazardous to human volunteers and since the x-ray penetra- tion is adequate for both human chest radiography and exami- nation of anthropomorphic dummies. In addition, it can be used in transitional ballistic and shock wave studies which re- quire the stop motion effect of short pulse flash radiography. The present procedure is most directly applicable for the radiographic visualization of contrast media-outlined vascular and visceral anatomy. As demonstrated in Figs. 7 and 8, it can also outline the vertebral bone detail. It may, therefore, have use in the study of pilot ejection mechanisms which pres- ently result in large numbers of thoracolumbar fractures with neurologic deficits. The present work has concentrated on the use of positive contrast radiography because these techniques are superior to others for the demonstration of interior anatomy. The structures outlined possess both physiologic and clinical as well as anatomic significance, in contradistinction to radi- opaque pellets or markers. The latter, when surgically im- planted, immediately alter the precise normal anatomic rela- tionships and are physiologically meaningless. However, markers do provide a finite number of high-contrast points, rather than the infinite number of low-contrast points, lines, and surfaces which are radiographically characteristic of ana- tomic structures. There are two areas of impact research in which we are presently attempting to apply these high-speed cinefluoro- graphic techniques: closed head injury and blunt thoracic in- jury. One primary effort is in the analysis and documentation of interior brain movements during impact trauma, specifically those occurring at the brainstem and at the foramen magnum. There is need for these data, since at present there exist at least seven separate theories describing how brain and neural tissue damage occur: cavitation (14), pressure gradient forma- tion, skull deformation, skull shell vibration, sulci rotation, translational mass displacements, and the transmission of waves of force (10, 15, 16). None of these can be either wholly refuted nor supported, primarily due to the lack of data discribing how the brain anatomically responds to trauma (15). It is now technically feasible to record and quantitate these interior movements in response to graded impacts, linear and rotational accelerations of varying magni- tude, direction, and duration. Our thesis is that, irrespective of the impact forces acting upon the head and neck, it is the measurable interior displacements and distortions of the nor- mal central nervous system anatomy which determine the clinical, physiologic, and pathologic alterations following head trauma. The second area of our studies is the genesis of cardiac and large vessel pathology during thoracic trauma. Two specific goals are to document radiographically aortic transection and to record the distortions occurring about the aortic arch prior to the development of traumatic aneurysms. It has long been observed that aortic transections occur primarily in two locations- in the ascending arch above the aortic cusps and at the isthmus below the origin of the left subclavian artery at the insertion of Botalli's ligament (17, 18). As it is now technically feasible to observe this region during impact radiographically (Fig. 7), it should be entirely feasible to measure the aortic arch displacements necessary to produce this pathology. SUMMARY 1. A flash x-ray cinematography system has been developed which is operable to 1000 frames/s. Repetitive flash x-ray ex- posures of 30-50 ns per frame provide essentially absolute stop motion for biomechanical research. 2. Design features of this and alternate high-speed systems are compared. Instruments using full size x-ray plates provide the highest resolution but are limited to low frame rates and small numbers of images. Devices using image intensifiers and cinefilm recording provide much higher frame rates and yield usable images at approximately an order of magnitude lower radiation exposure per frame. 3. X-ray exposure can be minimized during high-frame-rate cinefluorographic operation by utilizing the x-ray source as a strobe, using all radiation to both stop motion and produce radiographic images. 4. Thousand-frame-per-second cineangiography studies of the aortic arch, cardiac ventricle, and intracranial arteries were performed during moderate velocity chest and head impact injuries. Each anatomic structure was well visualized radio- graphically and underwent acute rapid transient displace- ments over a millisecond time scale. 5 . This instrument can be utilized to provide quantitative information of interior visceral and vascular movements oc- curring during impact trauma. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The author would like to thank Dr. S.

These techniques, however, introduce a series of artifacts which must be thoroughly understood before infer- ences may be made from film data obtained with them. These are: increased density and increased viscosity of the radi- opaque contrast media with respect to the blood or other fluid it replaces, and an increased intraluminal pressure with de- creased vascular distensibility during the vascular injection process. These artifacts are only occasionally of clinical significance during routine angiographic procedures but can become important during dynamic or shock events. In order to assess anatomic movements within the cranial cavity, rotary artifacts should be excluded, or at least mea- sured and minimized. Blood vessels within the brain are not linear, though their courses may appear so on cross section in radiographs. Their movements will have to be understood in three dimensions before accurate quantitative data on shear or strains may be obtained. The resolution of the present system is maximally 2.0 lp / mm for repetitive test patterns; however, single high -density lines smaller than 500 micrometers are normally photographed. The final image quality can be improved with computer en- hancement techniques, and simple edge enhancements have proved effective. It is likely, however, that very specific en- hancement programs will have to be constructed for the radio- graphic-intensifier film imaging process. High-speed x-ray cinematography is not a technique limited to medical radiography. It is equally usable in many diverse areas which require documentation and analysis of transient interior movements through opaque bodies. Specifically, ballistic transitions, fragmentation events, and interior me- chanical motions may be studied by these techniques. The differential x-ray attenuation characteristics of the subject and surrounding opaque medium will determine the energy spectrum or penetrating ability of the x-ray source required. Flash x-ray generators are currently available from 50 kVp to 2 MV, and above this pulsed linear accelerators may be used. In each case, the absorption of the radiation-detecting surface must be matched to the energy spectrum of the source.</page></plain_text>
