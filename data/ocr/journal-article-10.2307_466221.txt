<plain_text><page sequence="1">Subjectivity, Marxism, and Culture Theory in China LIU KANG Subjectivity as a humanist concept has been under assault in the current debates about contemporary "postmodern" culture in the west. Its fate in China, however, seems to have taken just the opposite direction. Follow- ing the resurgence of the humanist May Fourth (1919) tradition in litera- ture and the arts in the wake of the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) and the subsequent debates in philosophical and economical circles about modernization, the concept of subjectivity has gained a centrality in recent debates about culture in China, starting in the mid-1980s. The May Fourth Movement, a watershed in modern Chinese history, was initiated by the demonstration of Beijing students against the government's humil- iating concession to Japan after World War I. It then turned into a nation-wide cultural movement for a radical break with the Confucian tradition, as well as for a transformation of Chinese culture into a modern and global one.' As western humanist values of "democracy" and "sci- ence" were hailed as liberating forces by May Fourth intellectuals, radical social theories such as marxism and anarchism made a tremendous im- pact, ultimately leading to the establishment of the Chinese Communist Party in 1921.2 The Chinese communists under Mao, however, gradually abandoned the humanist goals of the May Fourth Movement in the course of their struggle for and consolidation of power. The recent debate about China's cultural heritage and about the problems of tradition and moder- nity can be seen as a strong critique of Mao's legacy through the recovery and continuation of the incomplete cultural enlightenment of the May Fourth Movement. The debate has taken place largely in the realms of literature, history and philosophy, but its impact has been felt in many sectors of social life. A central issue in the debates has been the place of subjectivity in marxist cultural theories. Despite the fact that Chinese marxism, preoccupied with political and economic struggles, has never had a separate cultural theory, the problem of subjectivity has remained central to marxist literary thought. For instance, Hu Feng's theory of a "subjective fighting spirit" in realism, formulated at a critical juncture of the Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945), linked the concept of social revolution with that of individ- ual consciousness. And in the 1980s, Li Zehou, a leading philosopher and cultural critic, and Liu Zaifu, a major literary theorist, who is now in 114</page><page sequence="2">Liu Kang 115 effective exile in the U.S., initiated a resurgence of interest in subjectiv- ity. Hu Feng's task in the 1940s had been to stake out a site of revolution and resistance at the level of subjective experience and consciousness, an arena that the Chinese marxist ideology of class struggle and national salvation deliberately ignored or suppressed. In Hu Feng's view, subjec- tivity is a key to realist representation, a mediation of political reality and lived experience. As such it pertains to the aspect of cultural critique as a major objective of the May Fourth New Cultural Movement, for the question of subjectivity is as much a preeminent instrument of rejuvenat- ing China's culture as it is a relentless critique of the Confucian tradition that subsumes subjectivity and consciousness within an ethic of universal kinship and communality. To be sure, Hu Feng's theoretical work is eminently representative of the May Fourth Enlightenment projects. Un- fortunately, the debate about the 1940s ended in a virulent political assault on his deviant and "counter-revolutionary" stance. The increasing attacks against bourgeois subjectivism and idealism, and various forms of "revisionism," such as Lukacsian theory and western marxism as a whole, further consigned subjectivity to the enemy camp of anti-socialist ideol- ogies. Only after Mao's extremist "Cultural Revolution" had undone its own myth of creating a brand new cultural formation could the once-stifled voice of May Fourth humanism, and its enlightenment project of cultural critique again resonate in China. In the realm of culture, Li Zehou's and Liu Zaifu's initial reflections on subjectivity in the late 1970s and early 1980s crystalized a cultural ethos of "recovery" and "return": a recovery of once-denounced humanist values and a return to the May Fourth En- lightenment projects. In this respect, the connection between the two debates over the span of some forty years becomes apparent. In what follows, I will begin with a brief account of Hu Feng's theory of the '40s in order to recapture the historical specificity of the question of subjectivity in Chinese marxist thought. I will then move to the cultural debates of the '80s, focusing on Li Zehou's appropriation of idealist German philosophy and historical materialism, and on Liu Zaifu's rein- vention of humanist and marxist aesthetic thinking in their respective undertakings to reconstruct subjectivity in Chinese culture. This histori- cal recontextualization is necessary, for later debates can be fully compre- hensible only in the light of the earlier ones. I will argue that while Hu Feng's theory of subjectivity bears an urgency of political commitment directly supportive of the politics of cultural activity during the War of Resistance, in the theories of Li Zehou and Liu Zaifu of the 1980s there is an aestheticizing and depoliticizing tendency, which attempts to dis- tance cultural activity from political reality by valorizing culture over and above other aspects of social life. This tendency, akin to that of western</page><page sequence="3">116 Subjectivity, Marxism &amp; Culture Theory in China contemporary cultural theories and western marxist theories in particular, must be contemplated within the global perspective of contemporary cultural reconfigurations. By tracing these thinkers' appropriations of marxist categories in reconstituting subjectivity, I hope to bring this experience to bear on present western theory. I want to demonstrate, through this rather rudimentary and less-than-adequate description of the debates, that categories such as subjectivity, culture, and consciousness have a very complex relationship with politics and cannot be reduced or attributed to an all-encompassing "culturalism." These recent debates on culture must be examined with respect to China's historic emergence as a new social formation following from the long process of political plural- ism and economic decentralization over the last ten years. The suppres- sion of this civil society in the wake of the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown indicates the vulnerability of the cultural domain and the interdependence of political, economic, and cultural spheres. I Hu Feng had always been at the forefront of controversy and debates in left-wing literary circles. His writings, as Theodore Huters puts it, "came increasingly to chronicle the internal dynamics of the leftist liter- ary scene itself," and "there was to be no debate in literary circles after 1938 in which Hu Feng did not take an active role."3 In the debates of 1936, Hu Feng insisted that May Fourth new literature, inspired by the realist literature of the west, was the only correct mode of expression in educating and mobilizing the masses. In the next debate regarding na- tional forms which took place in 1939 and 1940, Hu Feng stood up firmly again to defend the May Fourth legacy of realism. The proponents of national forms promulgated a populist and nationalist literature for the sake of war propaganda, whereas Hu Feng insisted on the absolute neces- sity of May Fourth realism to demystify the traditional Confucian ideol- ogy and enlighten the masses (hua dazhong), rather than popularize (dazhong hua). As both Li Zehou and Liu Zaifu acknowledge, the ques- tions of national forms and of May Fourth realism are essentially an issue of enlightenment and cultural critique. The masses, composed mainly of illiterate peasants, need to be educated and enlightened by intellectuals armed with revolutionary consciousness.4 But politics cannot be ruled out in considering this literary debate. The real agenda of the proponents of the national forms was to rally the peasants around Mao's revolutionary army through traditional and popular forms of entertainment. In his re- fusal to compromise the goal of transforming Chinese culture with the expediency of communist propaganda, Hu Feng revealed his non-con- formist political stance. The debate on subjectivity in 1945 was a continuation of these previous discussions. The earlier controversies over national forms and western</page><page sequence="4">Liu Kang 117 influences, enlightenment and popularization, boiled down in the subjec- tivity debate to the philosophical question of subject-object relationships in literary representation. This debate took place largely in the non-com- munist territory of Sichuan and Hong Kong, three years after Mao's Yanan Talks codified Chinese marxist literary criticism. Almost the whole leftist literary circle, both in the Communist-controlled area and outside it, became involved in the debate. The issue was not settled until several years after the establishment of the PRC. Not surprisingly, the settlement came in the form of political repression. When Mao sensed the real threat that Hu Feng's aberrant position might pose to his cultural and literary orthodoxy, he intervened by denouncing Hu Feng as the captain of an anti-communist, counterrevolutionary clique. After the ruthless political assaults against the "Hu Feng clique" that swept across the whole country, Hu Feng was arrested in 1955. Thereafter the issue of "subjectivity" only received negative characterizations in literary history, and Hu Feng and all his colleagues were imprisoned or banished from the cultural circles. The official rehabilitation of the "Hu Feng Event" would come as late as 1987.' Hu Feng's theory of "subjective fighting spirit" was mainly concerned with the problems of form and representation in the realist mode. By concentrating on the relationship between subjective experience, or class consciousness on the one hand, and representation on the other, his theory encompasses critical problems of ideology and hegemony, body and de- sire, domination and resistance. "Subjective fighting spirit" for Hu Feng serves as a powerful weapon to combat both "subjective formulaism" - gongshi zhuyi, which means dogmatic adherence to literary "formulas" - and the "objectivism" then in vogue. The Japanese invasion and the national crisis caused writers to have an emotional crisis. A subjectivism prevailed which did not lead to truthful representation of social reality but to formulaic, stereotyped literary work. It remained divorced from the concrete world and individual lived experience, and derived its inspira- tion only from abstract idealism and romantic sentimentalism. On the other hand, the ethos of national defense and political imperative was so overwhelming that the writer "felt himself completely given over to the demands of the time, and found solace in a state of selflessness."6 Objec- tivism thus dominated the literary work, preventing the writer from real- izing the broad significance of the war in its daily events. "Objectivism" appears to be a coded term in Hu Feng's usage, like "naturalism" in Lukacs's vocabulary, referring to the narrow-minded, partisan, and utili- tarian views of art held by the commissars of the Red Army's propaganda teams.' Hu Feng finds that both "subjective formulaism" and "objectiv- ism" are but two sides of the same coin. He argues that only a "subjective fighting spirit" can lead to realism: "The unity or combination of subjec- tive spirit and objective truth has produced a militant new literature. We</page><page sequence="5">118 Subjectivity, Marxism &amp; Culture Theory in China call it realism."8 There is an eminent Hegelian overtone in Hu Feng's emphasis on the unity of the subjective and the objective in the conscious- ness of the individual as a way to grasp the totality of meaning. The "subjective fighting spirit" hence bears a striking resemblance to Lukacs's "class consciousness." Just as Lukacs insists that the proletarian class consciousness is the only way to ensure that the proletariat over- come alienation and reification through comprehending social reality as a historical totality, so Hu Feng regards "subjective fighting spirit" as the foremost means for understanding social reality and realizing the poten- tial of the people, which he ascribes to realist literary representation. It is no coincidence that Lukcs, too, takes the literary form of narrative as the most privileged means of fulfilling revolutionary class consciousness.9 Realism serves as a powerful ideological critique and counter-hege- monic strategy. In his seminal essay of 1944, "Situating Ourselves in the Struggle for Democracy," he emphasized the combative character of the creative process by which an authentic work of realism is produced. He calls this process the "interfusion" of the "subject" with the "object," a term synonymous with social life itself in his vocabulary.'0 The "interfu- sion" of the author's self with the object-Other by which subjectivity is constituted is made possible only through revolutionary practice, which includes "opposing fascism and feudalism, lashing out at all forms and measures of slavish ethics, unearthing the potential power of the people, and articulating the people's desire and struggle for liberation" (22-23). The key to the successful constitution of revolutionary subjectivity is the power to combat the "spiritual slavery" of the masses and to uncover their revolutionary potential: "Although their [the people's] desires or strug- gles of life embody the demand of history, they take on myriad and malleable forms as well as complicated and tortuous paths. Although spiritually they were given over to liberation, the scars of thousands of years of spiritual slavery are always inherent or expanding in their mind. If the writer does not want to drown in the ocean of such a sensuous existence when engaging himself deeply into it, he has to foster a critical power in combating the content of their life" (21). Hu Feng locates "spiritual slavery" at the internal unconscious level of sensuous exis- tence, as an ensemble of cultural constituencies of domination through consensus rather than coercion." The "subjective fighting spirit" thus takes on a counter-hegemonic character, in the sense that its task is to combat the deeply embedded and internalized cultural values installed over thousands of years by the holders of power. This is precisely the primal objective of the May Fourth Enlightenment projects of cultural critique, to which the Li Zehous and Liu Zaifus of the 1980s were to return with a deep sense of belatedness and vengeance. Yet this subjectivity of resistance stems from the sensuous and bodily experience of the masses. In the same 1944 article, Hu Feng characterizes</page><page sequence="6">Liu Kang 119 the dialectics of the formation of revolutionary subjectivity as a "struggle of one bloody mark after one scourge," the passion and affliction incurred in the course of artistic creation being "not simply the reaction to pres- sures of the time or burden of life, but the internal process of conscious expansion, accompanied by the pain of the body" (22). Literary represen- tation, or realism, is entwined with this bodily experience, and made possible only through the "passionate expansion," spiritual "embrace," and "penetration" of this powerful subjective experience, will and feel- ing, into its object of representation. In a somewhat phenomenological or Hegelian synthesis of subject-object relations, Hu Feng describes the genesis of artistic creation as "stemming from the struggle with the real life of flesh and blood. The real life of flesh and blood, of course, means the sensuous object. " "The struggle with the real life of flesh and blood is a process of embodying, and absorbing the object, as well as a process of overcoming, and critiquing the object .... The critique . . .must grasp the social significance of the object from its concrete, lively, and sensu- ous experience, and instill into this experience the author's positive, affirmative or negative viewpoint" (18-19). Four years later, in a much longer and more elaborate treatise, "On the Path of Realism" (1948), Hu Feng made the most explicit connection between subjectivity, sensuous experience, and reality: "The Real as such is simply the glowing and painful historical content, in which flows the people's burden, awakening, potentiality, and desire and longing for life; ... the author must internal- ize this historical content into his own subjective demand."'2 In Hu Feng's theory of "subjective fighting spirit," the dialectic of domination and resistance can be resolved through transforming the people's desire and potential for liberation from the state "in-itself" into the state "for-itself."'3 Hu Feng links this transformation with the ques- tion of literary form. The so-called "national forms" of the vernacular tradition are the bearers of the old ideology, or "spiritual slavery." There- fore the transformation of the people's mind and the uncovering of revo- lutionary potential can only be realized by adopting new forms of May Fourth realism: "When feudalist culture (popular culture) still exerted its power through the 'sluggishness of history,' the urban class emerged in China as a powerful material force, and this class led a great literary revolution."'" While Hu Feng's outright denunciations of popular culture and "national forms" may seem elitist, what he underscores is the notion that form and ideological content are inseparable, and that the form is a true bearer of the author's subjectivity. He wrote: "Form is the rational expression of the objective reality unified with the author's subjectivity " (Hu Feng's italics)."5 Hu Feng's subjectivity in literary creation is essentially a social agency of revolution and resistance. It is a thoroughly historical and political concept, free from transcendental universals. He insists on a critique of</page><page sequence="7">120 Subjectivity, Marxism &amp; Culture Theory in China traditional culture as the essential task of modem enlightenment, refusing to subjugate cultural critique to the political agenda of popularization and massification. In the 1980s, Li Zehou hailed Hu Feng as one of the foremost Chinese marxist thinkers who insisted on the theme of enlight- enment as an absolute task for Chinese social revolution and transforma- tion.'6 However, in the same essay, Li Zehou, reflecting on the failure of Hu Feng's theory to exert any major impact on the cultural and literary scene, acknowledges the ultimate determination of political reality. In a comparison of Hu Feng's theory and Mao's Yanan Talks, Li Zehou con- cedes that Mao "talked about literature and the arts from a socio-political perspective, which is higher than the laws of literature and the arts per se" (85). Mao's view, therefore, triumphed and dominated the Chinese cul- tural domain for the next three or four decades. The triumph of the theme of "national salvation" over "enlightenment" since the late 1930s is, according to Li Zehou, a "great sacrifice" that China had undergone in its way to modernization. The fundamental task for the 1980s was to renew the discontinued May Fourth enlightenment project of cultural critique in order to reconstruct Chinese culture in the future. This, of course, is occasioned by that "higher" level of political reality of post-Mao China. II The culture debate of the 1980s was as much a strong reaction to and negation of Maoist cultural policy as a passionate desire for the recon- struction and revitalization of Chinese culture. The scale and style of the debates, mostly occurring from 1985 to 1989, were such that the expres- sion "cultural fever" most vividly conveys their emotional dimension. However, under the prevalent optimism and hope for China's reconstruc- tion which characterizes the theoretical works of the Li Zehous and Liu Zaifus, the creative works of writers and artists, and also the student movement at Tiananmen Square in the Spring of 1989, there has been a very complex political reality fraught with contradiction and confusion. The cataclysmic Cultural Revolution (1966-76) not only shattered the entire social formation, it also scrambled those ideological codes funda- mental to the operation of the Party and state. One of the serious conse- quences was a legitimation crisis in China's social life, especially in the realm of culture and ideas. In the 1980s, however, a crucial development in Chinese political reality was the emergence of a civil society in this realm. With the ending of the "Cultural Revolution," institutional changes gradually and steadily took place in cultural domains. If the earlier de- bates, such as the so-called "Emancipation of the Mind" movement of 1979, still bore a strong official imprint, then the recent cultural reflec- tions of Li Zehou, Liu Zaifu, Jin Guantao and Su Xiaokang, etc., have a much more independent character. The debate about culture was kindled</page><page sequence="8">Liu Kang 121 by a host of intellectuals striving to obtain independence or at least a semi-autonomous status from the Party's control." The incipient social formation of civil society is both a solution and an outgrowth of the legitimation crisis in post-Mao China, permeating every corner of social life.'" A major part of this crisis concerns the identity of the Chinese "cultural workers" or intellectuals, as a consequence of the separation of cultural activity from the Party's political agenda. Having been simultaneously captives as well as guardians of the Party cultural apparatus for decades, intellectuals now feel immensely liberated from its fetters, and as such, are disoriented as to their new social identity in an increasingly open, commodified and contradictory society, where power still remains in the hands of the Party. There is, then, an urgent need to establish a new identity, an independent and autonomous rationality for intellectuals themselves. This identity must be sought in the Lebenswelt , or cultural system, resistant to bureaucratic control and autonomous from the power structure of domination and subordination. Subjectivity thus becomes a key issue to the new rationality in the post-Mao China. Put in the context of institutional changes occurring over the years, reflections on subjectivity can first of all be seen as a self-conscious effort to redefine the intellectual self as an autonomous, self-determining, self- regulating and free subject. The philosopher Li Zehou took up the burden of recovering the inde- pendent subject. Li Zehou (1930- ) studied at Bejing University's Philos- ophy Department. He first made himself known in the late 1950s by his polemical articles on aesthetics against Zhu Guangqian, then China's leading aesthetician. Li Zehou has worked in the Institute of Philosophy at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences since the 1950s, where he is now a senior researcher. As perhaps China's most important marxist thinker in the post-Mao decades, Li Zehou has authored in the last fifteen years a number of highly influential books and articles on philosophy, aesthetics, Chinese classical philosophy and intellectual history, art crit- icism and literary criticism. Since the late 1970s, he has emerged as an eminent intellectual leader, whose status and influence in China is prob- ably comparable to that of Sartre in France. Li's appeal to the younger generation - college students in particular - is enormous. Many con- sider him a "mentor of spiritual enlightenment."'9 He earned this honor by first of all breaking a new ground in the study of marxism, the foremost subject of learning in China. He went all the way back to Marx's intellec- tual origins, German idealist philosophy, to search for a solid theoretical ground for a marxist theory of subjectivity. This ground is to be sought in Kant, rather than in Hegel, for Kant laid the ultimate foundation for modern "self-reflection" of subjectivity, Nature, and society. In 1979, Li Zehou's Critique of the Critical Philosophy: A Study of Kant (hereinafter Critique) was published. The second revised edition came out in 1984,</page><page sequence="9">122 Subjectivity, Marxism &amp; Culture Theory in China with the appendix of his important 1981 lecture, "The Philosophy of Kant and the Theses on the Construction of Subjectivity." Critique, Li Zehou's major philosophical work, is a critique of Kantian philosophy from the historical materialist point of view of "practice." The main goal is to spell out a marxist practical philosophy, which would lay the philosophical foundation for a notion of subjectivity as the main conceptual framework with which to examine Chinese culture and history. The book is difficult. Li admits that "probably my book is really affected by the style of The Critique of Pure Reason, notorious for its repetitiveness, monotony, and obscurity."20 But surprisingly, the first edition of 30,000 copies sold out quickly, and the second edition of some 40,000 copies, was as popular as the first edition in the market. The book indeed induced a "Kant Fever" of no small scale in China's intellectual circles. (In order to comprehend the magnitude of the interests in theory and philosophy and the impact of Li Zehou's work, one must take into account the intellectual hunger of the post-Cultural Revolution generations.The author of this article has been also a product of that particular intellectual environment.) Li Zehou tries to establish connections between historical materialist categories and Kant's reflections on human rationality and consciousness. The emphasis on historical materialism, as he later acknowledged, was aimed at Maoist radical idealism and subjectivism, which violated the inevitable law of History.2' Kant, according to Li Zehou, for the first time places the issue of subjectivity at the center of philosophical thought by examining three essential constituents of human nature: knowledge, will, and feeling, in his three critiques of epistemology, ethics, and aesthetics. The a priori representations or concepts of understanding in Kant's first critique, the Critique of Pure Reason, function as a mediation between human mind and sensory data. The transcendental synthesis forms the kernel of Kant's "Copernican Revolution," which reconciles the idealist insistence on speculative consciousness as the sole resource of under- standing, and the empiricist dependence on sense perception for knowing the world. Kant tries to establish a rationality that redefines man's trou- bled relationship with Nature, the relationships between reason and sen- suousness, mind and matter. The way Kant solves this problem is, in short, to give man a superior legislative power over Nature. Kant's second critique, in the realm of ethics, concludes by postulating a moral Law as a pure form of universal legislation. Man's supremacy over Nature is then guaranteed with the inscription of rationality in ethics. The second cri- tique, therefore, reinforces Kantian rationality in the domain of ethics and will, approximating more closely the relationship between the phenome- nal and the noumenal worlds, and glancing over once again the unknow- able and mysterious ding-an-sich.22 Kant's greatest contribution to the philosophy of subjectivity is, in Li Zehou's view, his reflections upon the complex formation of human</page><page sequence="10">Liu Kang 123 rationality. These reflections lead to an "anthropological ontology of subjectivity," as opposed to the various "idealist ontologies based on experience [desire], language, or logic."(258) Hence, the Kantian "an- thropological ontology of subjectivity " will serve as a point of departure for a marxist theory of subjectivity. Drawing on historical materialist assumptions, Li Zehou separates subjectivity into a material and a psy- chological component. He calls the former the world of science and technology, the latter, "cultural-psychological formation"(wenhua xinli jiegou) (94;209;258;429). Li Zehou insists on the determination of the material component and the secondary character of the psychological, for he considers the distinction of base/superstructure central to historical materialism. But his original and creative move is to place great emphasis on the constitutive character of "practice," defined as material production and practice of tool-making, rather than "praxis," which is used most frequently in western marxist writings to include theoretical and cultural productions. Engels characterized man's tool-making as the defining fea- ture of man's humanity which separates man from Nature and constitutes his subjectivity and self-consciousness. But how exactly subjectivity is constituted through tool-making and material practice is not explained. Kant, on the other hand, uncovered the complex process of the constitu- tion of subjectivity. However, Kantian philosophy is known for its eclec- ticism, compromising materialism with idealism. In order to overcome Kant's idealist impasse and to restore Kantian rationality to its "true" material basis, the reinvention of a historical materialist concept of prac- tice is necessary. Significantly, Li Zehou's reinterpretation of historical materialism ap- pears in a negative characterization and critique of western marxism. He mounts his severe criticism of the Frankfurt School and western marxism in the chapter on "Kantianism in Social Theories": [In] western marxism...some stress the priority of thought, and some consider cultural revolution and cultural critique more important pre- conditions for economic reform- and political revolt. Some, like Marcuse, escaped to aesthetics, or, like Habermas, to education, as their shelter of 'revolutionary' or reformist theories. Therefore they like to use the term 'praxis' to include man's every activity, as op- posed to historical materialism" (362). In defense of historical materialism, Li Zehou insists that "practice must be defined in terms of the use and making of tools, in order to unify the philosophy of practice and historical materialism" (362). Western marx- ism, as Li Zehou puts it, "severs [the marxist] philosophy of practice from historical materialism," with serious practical consequences in political reality. Drawing on the Chinese lessons, he admonishes: the Chinese Great Leap Forward of 1958 was indeed a grand practice. But it violated the historical law and had only negative consequences. Thus a philosophical presupposition may look far removed from real-</page><page sequence="11">124 Subjectivity, Marxism &amp; Culture Theory in China ity, it in fact always has significant bearings on social reality. The Cultural Revolution was another grave instance. The momentous stu- dent movement of the 1960s in the west did not yield any accomplish- ments either" (363). It is thus no coincidence that Sartre, Althusser and other western marxists touted the Chinese Cultural Revolution as a great praxis, because of the fundamental affinity of "impetuous, petit-bourgeois ethical utopianism" inherent in Maoist radical leftism as well as western marxism (362). Clearly, Li Zehou's critique of western marxism is based primarily on the historical experience of Chinese marxism, Maoist subjective idealism and voluntarism in particular. His emphasis on tool-making and material practice is also overshadowed by post-Mao China's overriding concern with modernization projects. Contrary to the western marxists' fascination with the young Marx's Hegelian conception of the overcoming of alienation as the ultimate end, Li Zehou sees a genuine historical materialist solution to the future of the humankind in Marx's formulation on the humanization of Nature in the Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts. Marx suggests that it is the material practice of man that constitutes a humanized Nature, thereby leading toward man's complete and fully-developed subjectivity." Li Zehou seizes on Marx's formulation, and further elaborates on how prac- tice finally humanizes Nature. Here he draws not only on Kant, but also on the cognitive psychology of Piaget and on Wittgenstein's theory of language-game as social practice.24 Key elements of Li Zehou's theory of subjectivity are the concepts of "internalization"(nehua) and "sedimentation"(jidian).The notion of nehua (internalization) is derived primarily from Piaget. Although the term jidian(sedimentation) has a far more influential currency, it is largely a variation of the concept of internalization based on Piagetian theory of cognitive and affective development (53-55; 76-79; 119; 425-6). Li Zehou gives Piaget a prominence unparalleled by any other 20th century western thinker in his system of thought: I value Piaget highly, because he almost repeats in the micro-field of child psychology what Marx and Engels discovered in the macro-world of history in the nineteenth century: it is not a priori internal rationality, nor logic and linguistic grammar, but practical and operational activity [sic], that forms the basis and origin of a human being's intellect, reason and thought.25 Piaget...notices the key determination of [physical] action and oper- ation in the formation of logical thinking as well as the whole open structure of cognition. He thus provides the important materialist basis for a scientific description of cognitive origin and develop- ment. It is interesting to note that Habermas, whose "reformist" position is rejected by Li Zehou, also draws heavily on Piaget in his rationalist social analysis, which is eminently Kantian. Habermas rules out the radical</page><page sequence="12">Liu Kang 125 contingency of the world in his communicative reason, and favors a vision of political order based on a somewhat idealized classic model of bour- geois stability. The appeal to Piaget is indeed very curious and symptom- atic. It may represent a tendency within contemporary marxism to resuscitate certain materialist positions from rationalist and scientist models, without confronting the unnerving issue of identity and non-iden- tity in materialism that the Frankfurt School philosophers brought up in their rethinking of Freud's psychoanalysis.27 As regards the other key concept, "sedimentation," an effort to inte- grate rationalist discourse with historical materialism is also evident. According to Li Zehou, the material practice of man gives birth to his ability for symbolic production - i.e., language - and in the meantime, this material practice has internalized man's sensuous experience into a psychological deep structure at the level of unconscious. In other words, the material practice has made possible a very long, complex process by which man's sensuous experience, his intuitive faculty of conceptualiz- ing, knowing and understanding - the categories of time and space in Kant's parlance - has sedimented, or congealed, into a rational, cultural- psychological formation (wenhua xinli jiegou). Li Zehou's "cultural-psychological formation" roughly corresponds to the notion of "unconscious."28 But there is a fundamental difference between his "cultural-psychological formation" and the Freudian "uncon- scious": Li Zehou's psychic formation is a thoroughly rational and cul- tural product, while in Freud and Lacan the "unconscious" signals an irreconcilable hiatus between cultural constraints and natural instincts and drives. In Lacan's view, only the mediation of the symbolic, that is, of language, can establish rational order to the chaotic and undifferenti- ated unconscious, but at a high price: the formation of subjectivity through the mediation of language involves essentially repressive pro- cesses of condensation and displacement, whereby the Real is absent, and can never be fully grasped. Li Zehou, on the other hand, relying on Piagetian, biologically-oriented cognitive and developmental psychol- ogy, denies the decisive role of linguistic mediation. For his sedimenta- tion process, rationality always has its full presence of totality. The mediation of the symbolic does not appear critical in the constitution of subjectivity.29 The notions of sedimentation and of cultural-psychological formation are a development of the marxian notion of the humanization of Nature. Although Kant described this process with great phenomenolog- ical rigor, supplemented by Hegel's historical and dialectic reflections, it is historical materialism that brings out the convergence of subjectivity, nature, and history.30 The seeds for the final convergence, or completion, of a thoroughly anthropomorphized and psychologized subjectivity, however, were sown by Kant in his third critique, on aesthetic judgement. Li Zehou regards</page><page sequence="13">126 Subjectivity, Marxism &amp; Culture Theory in China The Critique of Judgement as the keystone of Kant's philosophical arch: "As a middle point between Rousseau and Hegel, the social Man is the true center, the true point of departure and basis of Kant's thinking."3' The Critique of Judgement constitutes Kant's wholesale resolution of the contradictions, antitheses, and antinomies between the particular and the general, sensuousness and rationality, Nature and society, freedom of will and law of morality. In the two preceding critiques, Kant had wrestled with those antinomies strenuously without a successful resolution. Since Kant's goal is to prove that man is the final purpose of Nature in his complete freedom, only aesthetic judgment can fulfill this objective. Aesthetic judgment is the moment whereby man's meditation of his own purposiveness without utilitarian purpose is fully realized. This realiza- tion amounts to nothing less than the ultimate fulfillment of man's self- regulating, self-referential, autonomous and free subjectivity, which coincides perfectly with the final purpose of Nature. The Kantian aes- thetic not only guarantees the universality of man's freedom, but also establishes the condition for the complete humanization of Nature or naturalization of Man. This condition, obviously, lies at the heart of Marx's Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts. Marx's fundamental propositions are that humanness comes into being through humanizing Nature, and that the exercise of human senses, powers and capacities is an absolute end in itself. In his seminal lecture of 1982, "The Philosophy of Kant and the Theses on the Construction of Subjectivity," Li Zehou not only uses aesthetic subjectivity as the master trope to define his whole theoretical enterprise, but also to constitute the paramount paradigm for a creative transformation of Chinese culture.32 Having recovered the crucial link between Kantian aesthetic subjectiv- ity and marxian humanized Nature through hypostatizing the concept of practice, Li Zehou then proceeds to examine a wide range of cultural issues in China. He has demonstrated, through rigorous analyses of Chi- nese classic texts of philosophy, ethics, and art, that Chinese traditional thinking exhibits a highly sophisticated practical or pragmatic rationality. This rationality represents a sober, optimistic, pleasure-oriented and aes- thetic view of life. In contrast to the Judeo-Christian cultural assumptions of the fundamental conflicts of desire, sinfulness, and redemption, as well as to the hedonist legacy in the west, the pleasure-oriented Chinese classical philosophy takes delight in the rational life itself. This rational- ist worldview interfuses sensuous experience with a naturalist rationality, embodied by the principle of "unity of man and heaven (tian ren he yi)." In this sense, classic Chinese thinking is also essentially aesthetic: it takes the unity of sensuous experience with the rational order of the universe as its ultimate goal, to be fulfilled in a profoundly psychological and inter- nalized mode of life. The stress on harmony and equilibrium, however,</page><page sequence="14">Liu Kang 127 has its negative aspects. It severely hinders the development of man's capacity to conquer Nature and to realize his own humanity. Furthermore, as history evolves towards the modern period, traditional rationality lapses into an ossified doctrine. Chinese society is gradually eroded by the presence of the powerful western modern world. The west, with its advanced sciences and technology, and more open, dynamic social struc- tures, outshines China's ancient civilization. Li Zehou's account of traditional culture then moves to its modern phase, where the drama of intense conflicts between Chinese tradition and western influence unfolds. His most famous formulation about China's painful struggle towards modernity is the "dual variation of enlighten- ment and national salvation.""33 Briefly, his point is that the May Fourth Movement as the turning point in modern China started from a cultural critique, an enlightenment movement aimed at transforming Chinese ways of life into modern forms already existing in the west. However, this cultural enlightenment ended up in a political struggle for national salva- tion, when the country was besieged by imperialist invasions and domes- tic corruption. The enlightenment themes of individuality, subjectivity, freedom, and democracy were then superseded by the militant imperatives of collective class struggle mandated by the predominant theme of na- tional salvation. The success of communist revolution in China reinforced the militarism and hierarchy of the national salvational movements. The high cost is the absolute subordination of the individual to the state, reinstituting the tradition that May Fourth iconoclasts set off to chal- lenge.34 The incomplete project of the Chinese Enlightenment ought to be fulfilled, as Li Zehou suggests, by reinscribing the May Fourth thesis of "westernization" in a marxist vein, which radically alters the ideological content of the original concept. This proposition of "western substance/ Chinese function," (xiti zhongyong) is very controversial. It is opposed to the early reformist formulation of "Chinese substance/western function" (zhongti xiyong). The fundamental difference between the two theses, Li Zehou argues, lies in the different definition of "substance" - ti. Li Zehou's ti has a broad meaning of social existence, including both mate- rial, scientific-technological society and cultural-psychological forma- tion. On the other hand, the Chinese ti that the old reformists insisted on preserving is merely Confucian ideologies and its cultural systems. As Li Zehou himself admits, the definitions and arguments about ti and yong, including his own thesis, are extremely imprecise and can be very mis- leading. His point, however, is to argue that what constitutes ti in modern times is nothing less than a subjectivity fully spelt out, if not completely realized, by the development of the modern west and its thinkers. Li Zehou's powerful plea is to create a modern Chinese subjectivity by revitalizing the classic rationality of "unity of man and heaven" based on</page><page sequence="15">128 Subjectivity, Marxism &amp; Culture Theory in China the marxian humanization of Nature.35 He harshly censures the "pessi- mism, anti-historicism and anti-psychologism" in modern western thought, including analytical philosophy, structuralism, phenomenology, psychoanalysis, and the Frankfurt School of marxism (1986:296). Educa- tion and psychology, as Li Zehou predicts, will ultimately replace the language-centered humanistic pursuits of the twentieth century in the near future, in order to fully restore humanness to humankind.36 Having thus outlined the main features of Li Zehou's thoughts on subjectivity, I will make a few observations. I have said that historical materialism is central to Li Zehou's whole project of cultural reflection. His unflagging insistence on a marxist, dialectical, and historical materi- alist method is evidenced first of all by his consistent cross-examination of social thought on the one hand, concrete political conditions and historical experience on the other. Another distinct characteristic is a passionate yearning for cultural reconstruction and regeneration. His tireless endeavor to promote a constructive marxism does not simply stem from his personal conviction. It reflects the general ethos of China in its post-revolutionary era, which is characterized by a combined optimism for the future, deep remorse for the agonizing past, and strong anxiety about the disoriented present. Its optimistic, constructive spirit makes Li Zehou's cultural marxism an attractive alternative to the ultra-leftist legacy of Maoism. However, as I have said, an essential dimension of the generally for- ward-looking ethos of the time is a determined desire of recovery and return: return to the May Fourth humanism and enlightenment, return to the Chinese cultural tradition, and return to classic marxism. Despite his appropriations of certain modern conceptions of, say, Wittgenstein, Piaget, and Clifford Geertz, Li Zehou's reflections remain locked in the categories of classical German thought. The term "reflection" (fansi) has a preeminent currency in the recent Chinese debate about culture, and the metaphysical connotation of the term is unmistakably reminiscent of classic German philosophy. By "metaphysical" I mean the paradoxical lack of self-reflexiveness in what is designated by some as a "cultural self-reflection" movement. This movement by and large remains oblivi- ous to the specific historical contexts in which the conceptual models on which it relies are generated. In Li Zehou's case, the metaphysical dimen- sion lies primarily in his relentless privileging and absolutizing catego- ries of the aesthetic. And despite his frequent appeal to hermeneutical paradigms for interpreting culture and tradition, his arguments about modern Chinese history do not seem to transcend the old historicist paradigms of tradition vs. modernity, westernization vs. Chineseness, or western impact and Chinese reaction. Furthermore, I think his insistence on historical materialist categories is problematic. First of all, fundamental here is the distinction of man</page><page sequence="16">Liu Kang 129 from Nature defined by mankind's ability for tool-making. But this dis- tinction has been discredited by the recent anthropological discoveries.37 Li Zehou, however, seems to prefer the old definition of Engels, rather than heeding new counterarguments. On the other hand, Li Zehou rejects western marxist notions of "praxis" because the term includes cultural and theoretical work as part of material production. This rejection is based on what he believes to be the absolute value of the base/superstruc- ture distinction for historical materialism.38 There is at least some confu- sion, if not outright misunderstanding, in his insistence on the base/superstructure distinction. In the late capitalist society of the west, the information revolution has broken down the barrier between tool- making material production and communicative and informational pro- duction, so that materialist practice (or praxis) has to take into account the destabilized and restructured relationship between economic infra- structure and cultural and ideological superstructure. The long history of political and ideological interference and overdetermination that have negatively affected China's socio-economic growth perhaps induced Li Zehou to reinforce the classic marxist tenet of the ultimate determination of the economic base, and to dismiss the western neo-marxist revisionism of the original distinction of Marx and Engels. What is curious and paradoxical, though, is Li Zehou's own rationalist "culturalism," which tries to reintegrate the Kantian aesthetic subject, marxian humanization of Nature, Piagetian developmental psychology, and Confucian ren (be- nevolence) and tian ren heyi (unity of man and heaven) into a final grandiose resolution of the dilemma of China (explicitly) and the contem- porary world (implicitly). At any rate, the historical materialist distinc- tion of base/superstructure seems to be dissolved or undermined by Li Zehou's own predominantly culturalist resolutions. Secondly, his theory refuses to grant any ontological immanence to language and insists on the absolute secondary character of symbolic production of language as a result of material tool-making. His position contains insights indispensable to a critique of the idealist language philosophies prevalent in the west. But by denying the materiality of linguistic and symbolic production as the mediation of the subject/object relationship, a crucial link in cultural production is missing.39 Thirdly, the anthropomorphic impulse in his stress on the humanization of Nature as the ultimate end simply ignores what Freud has revealed: nature has persistently refused to be subsumed entirely by civilization. A notion of subjectivity has to take into account this profound non-identity of nature, discovered by Freud but neglected by Marx. As Fredric Jameson puts it, following the insights of Adorno, subjectivity must be characterized in "violent eclipse of the subject itself" in the moment of the subject's encounter with "that baleful fearful thing henceforth called Nature."40</page><page sequence="17">130 Subjectivity, Marxism &amp; Culture Theory in China Serious questions thus arise in respect to Li Zehou's relentless privi- leging of rationality. A Kantianism relying exclusively on rationality cuts across the whole of Li Zehou's thought, from the Chinese classical tradi- tion to the future of Chinese culture. His account of rationality precludes the problematic terrain of the unconscious as an antagonistic Other to the rationality of the Subject. Both Kant and Freud discovered that subjectiv- ity is predicated on the split and conflict between desire, sensuous expe- rience on the one hand, and law and reason on the other. A rationality unifying the two essentially incompatible domains cannot be achieved simply by a pre-linguistic, tool-making material practice which causes the former to congeal into the latter. In fact, Li Zehou's laborious effort to wed Piagetian cognitive psychology with historical materialism betrays a serious internal contradiction. At least it does not seem to lead to a tenable alternative either of the poststructuralist aporia of linguistic predetermi- nations or the dominance of the Lacanian Symbolic.41 The dismissal of important recent discoveries concerning language is a very serious flaw in Li Zehou's thinking. What he has belabored painstakingly to demon- strate in the constitution of subjectivity, namely the process of internal- ization and sedimentation, errs at the critical moment, where the antagonistic nature is embodied in symbolic and linguistic practices. Li Zehou himself, however, is acutely aware of this lack of engagement on the part of Chinese thinkers with the western contemporary philosophy of language, power, and history.42 Surprisingly, his historical materialist and dialectical method seems to be suspended when he comes to define subjectivity and the humanization of Nature in exclusively aesthetic terms. Aesthetic subjectivity from Kant to Marx has had strong political bearings. The Kantian universal subjec- tivity, however versatile and ambiguous, is, as Terry Eagleton puts it, a projection of the late eighteenth century German middle class, "in image if not in reality, as a truly universal subject." This bourgeois subject has posed "an ideological challenge to the ruling order," and served as a "counter-strategy to the political dominance."43 Li Zehou is not unaware of this political and ideological specificity of the Kantian notion of aesthetic subjectivity. But when he applies it to the Chinese condition, he seems to bracket the historical particularity of the concept by valorizing the aesthetic over the political. Despite Li Zehou's strong reservations about the Frankfurt School, he actually practices a kind of supradisciplinary critique analogous to that of this tendency. His is a mixture of philosophy, intellectual history, aes- thetic theory, art criticism, and anthropological analysis (his psychologi- cal interventions, however, remain the weakest). He tries hard to shy away from direct political involvement. He also maneuvers his often aberrant propositions adroitly to comply, at least superficially, with the official decrees of the so-called "construction of material civilization and spiri-</page><page sequence="18">Liu Kang 131 tual civilization." The Party has launched incessant campaigns to combat "western bourgeois spiritual pollution," and lately the "capitalist peaceful evolution," by means of promoting "socialist spiritual civilization," namely the official marxist ideology. Very often the slogans of these ideological campaigns are thinly veiled charges against unorthodox think- ing. Thus, Li Zehou's constructive way of promoting and protecting cultural criticism is altogether admirable, given the intense political pres- sure under which he has worked. But it also betrays a certain degree of naivet6 and idealism, common to Li Zehou's colleagues and students. Although Li Zehou's writings, especially his numerous occasional essays, are charged with a strong sense of commitment, fundamental to his think- ing is a sustained philosophical meditation operating on high levels of abstraction. In Liu Zaifu's literary theory of subjectivity, the inherent contradiction between political engagement and depoliticizing and aestheticizing tendency is most evident. III "On the Subjectivity of Literature," the manifesto of Liu Zaifu's project to overhaul Chinese marxist literary criticism, appeared in 1985. At that time, literary criticism in China stood at an intersection, bewildered by the busy traffic of new styles and trends, yet unable to locate its own position in the cultural coordinates of the post-Mao era. The dominant Maoist criticism was much despised and maligned. By 1985 the terroristic "literary criticism" of the Cultural Revolution was no longer dominant. But Chinese criticism under the straitjacket of Soviet "socialist realism" suffered a fatal deficiency: its embarrassing inability to engage literary texts as literature, rather than as political and ideological documents. Liu Zaifu's critical study of Lu Xun, published in 1979, shows his self-con- scious attempts to do away with the sociological platitudes. Inspired by Li Zehou's thinking on subjectivity, Liu Zaifu wrote his landmark essay on literary subjectivity, which ignited an enormous controversy in critical circles. Under the leadership of the liberal-minded Party General Secre- tary Hu Yaobang and Premier Zhao Zhiyang, who were then backed by China's paramount leader Deng Xiaping, Liu Zaifu was appointed the Director of the Institute of Literature Research, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, and the editor-in-chief of Literature Studies, the leading scholarly journal in the field. With such powerful positions, Liu was expected to be a spokesman of the Party's literary policy. But his subjec- tivity essay contained unmistakable criticism of the Party's interference in the realms of literature and the arts, while advocating a humanist, independent literature of subjectivity as an alternative. The Party loyalists smelled a whiff of dissent and deviation in Liu' s work. The majority of Chinese writers and critics, on the other hand, hailed the article for its bold challenge to the Party's literary orthodoxy.</page><page sequence="19">132 Subjeclivity, Marxism &amp; Culture Theory in China Liu Zaifu acknowledges his indebtedness to Li Zehou on many occa- sions. However, the difference between their philosophical and method- ological points of view is quite remarkable. If Li Zehou's propositions on subjectivity are resonant with Kantian presuppositions, Liu Zaifu's theo- retical framework has a much stronger Hegelian bent. Liu Zaifu is most explicit about his objectives of dialectical recovery or return: a recovery of creative subjectivity and a recovery of literature itself ("return to the subject and return to the text," so to speak).44 The effacing of the individual subject in official marxist criticism is politically and ideologically determined in ways that cannot be explained in purely literary and cultural terms. As a reaction to Maoist rejection of individualism, Liu Zaifu's aesthetic reconstruction of subjectivity must be seen as an ideological strategy. From an Althusserian view, the aes- thetic is ideological. The aesthetic centers the human subject in an imag- inary relationship to a pliable, purposive reality, thereby granting it a delightful sense of its immediate, sensuous, and concrete experience.45 By equating the aesthetic with the essence of the human being and then defining literature as that which embodies the level at which the human being understands itself, Liu Zaifu's formulation endows the aesthetic with a power to transgress the border of the imaginary and the real, thus challenging the notion of aesthetic representation. As for his theory, the sociopolitical reality of China which denies the very existence of subjec- tivity is not real; the real is the aesthetic being, or the subject in Liu's terms, which has been totally alienated and which must therefore be reconstructed by literature and the arts. Liu Zaifu writes: "The signifi- cance of the thesis that 'literature is the study of human beings' (wenxue shi renxue) is self-evident," for it restores the practical subjectivity of mankind and spiritual subjectivity in the realm of literature. The enrich- ment and development of subjectivity marks the progress of history. As a study of human beings, literature develops itself at a pace paralleling the level at which human beings understand themselves.t46 In Liu Zaifu's frame of reference, "the progress of history" as a marxist teleology maintains the romanticist utopianism that characterized the young Marx in the Economic and Philosophical Manuscript. Liu Zaifu transfigures marxian utopian vision into the contemporary world, asserting that mankind nowadays has already left the immediate daily process of labor behind them. Labor and aesthetic activity come to unite into one, and human nature has continued to enrich, develop and perfect it- self.... Never has the self-consciousness of human subjectivity as a whole become so manifest. Human beings are longing to modernize themselves as they demand the modernization of society (6:15). Liu Zaifu thus elevates subjectivity to an ontological immanence never accorded to it by Chinese orthodox marxist criticism. Liu Zaifu emphasizes the emancipatory function of the aesthetic expe- rience of reading. From a Schillerian-marxian perspective of aesthetic</page><page sequence="20">Liu Kang 133 education, he describes the aesthetic experience of reading as a process by which man realizes his free, complete and self-conscious being. Read- ing is equated with the unfolding of humanity and human essence of freedom and self-consciousness (7:3). For many years in China, aesthetic judgement was subordinate to the cognitive function of literature and arts in the interest of political propaganda and ideological indoctrination. Liu Zaifu's aesthetic experience of reading as a return to humanity challenges the Maoist politicization of reading in China's official marxist criticism. After "On the Subjectivity of Literature," Liu Zaifu published several books and numerous articles, further developing his view of literary subjectivity. In a book co-authored with the young critic Lin Gang, Tradition and the Chinese Person (1988), the emergence of individualist values and subjectivity is identified as the hallmark of Chinese moder- nity.47 His historically accurate description about modern Chinese intel- lectual development, however, gives way to an aestheticized account of universal subjectivity, following Li Zehou's theory, as the ultimate goal of China's project of Enlightenment and modernity. Also, Liu Zaifu char- acterizes modern and contemporary Chinese literature as essentially a process of discovery of humanity and human subjectivity at different historical conjunctures. He views literature as part of a profound cultural reflection upon Chinese tradition. The centrality of this cultural reflection is the question of subjectivity.48 Liu Zaifu's theory of subjectivity consti- tutes a cultural theory from which to study modern Chinese literature. In a 1986 interview, Liu Zaifu proposes cultural studies as a new approach to modern Chinese literature as opposed to the dominant political and sociological approaches. He contends that the most important feature of modern Chinese culture is the transformation of cultural conceptions, characterized by recognition of the primacy of individuality and subjec- tivity.49 Liu Zaifu's theory of subjectivity rests on a humanist view of subjec- tivity embodied in Hegelian metaphysics. He criticizes mechanical theo- ries of reflection by valorizing creative subjectivity and literature as an embodiment of the human essence of freedom. But Liu Zaifu is keenly aware of the immense incompatibility between historically different so- cial conditions and abstract systems of thought. At the heart of his theo- retical reflection is a distinction between politics and culture. As I indicated earlier, much of Li Zehou's and Liu Zaifu's works were intended to stake out or relocate an autonomous site for the displaced intellectuals themselves. In this respect, their philosophical and literary reflections can be seen as strategies of reterritorialization in post-Cultural Revolution China. Such a project necessarily entails a staggering degree of difficulty and of internal contradiction. What is remarkable about Liu Zaifu's think- ing, then, is a high degree of self-consciousness of the internal contradic- tions in his own thoughts. This is another major difference between Liu</page><page sequence="21">134 Subjectivity, Marxism &amp; Culture Theory in China Zaifu and Li Zehou. Li Zehou's more carefully wrought and rigorously argued statements within a systematic framework often conceal their enormous difficulties and logical inconsistencies. Liu Zaifu's critical reflexivity has to do with his unique sensitivity to contradictions. In a recent essay, Liu admits that one of his main objec- tives is to counter the dominant philosophical discourse in China, namely "the dualism of mind and matter." This "dualism" refers specifically to historical materialism. Liu Zaifu strives to combat this historical materi- alist viewpoint.50 But ironically, it also characterizes the kind of thinking habits in which Liu Zaifu is deeply entrenched. He has wrestled with this dualistic mode throughout his work. His book of prose poems, Tragic Songs of Quest, is replete with contradictory romantic yearnings for love, harmony, universality, not to mention trepidations about strident reality.51 In Lu Zaifu's theoretical musings, antagonistic dichotomies seem to per- meate every corner of life: at the level of social life, there are binary oppositions such as politics/culture, tradition/modernity, westerniza- tion/sinification; at a theoretical level, those of mind/matter, feeling/rea- son, conscious/unconscious, cut across his work. One of his famous formulations is the "dual composition of literary character." He insists that the literary character is not a homogeneous monad, but possesses complex, dual characteristics. In another celebrated essay, "On Desire," Liu Zaifu deals with conflicts between human instincts and desires and social orders and norms."5 A careful reading of Liu Zaifu's major state- ments on subjectivity indicates the hybrid resources of his theoretical arguments.53 His main frame of reference, however, remains that of the traditional marxist categories, and his classic literary examples come primarily from the nineteenth century European romanticist and realist works and classical Chinese tradition.54 The prime impulse of Liu Zaifu's aestheticizing enterprise is a desire to counter the dominance of political theories of reflection and represen- tation with an aesthetic theory of subjectivity. His generation of intellec- tuals has become disillusioned with politics, and they try to distance themselves from it as much as possible. Yet politics inevitably intervenes at the very moment of depoliticization. Liu Zaifu tries to transcend poli- tics by proposing aesthetic universals, but his aesthetic enterprise betrays the political intent he is unwilling to acknowledge. IV The project of Li Zehou and Liu Zaifu to a large extent continues Hu Feng's thinking. The differences between Li Zehou, Liu Zaifu, and Hu Feng lie primarily in the politics underlying their respective theories. While all of them insist on the May Fourth tradition of enlightenment and realism, Li Zehou and Liu Zaifu wish to stake out a territory of culture in which the enlightenment theme and western individualist and humanist</page><page sequence="22">Liu Kang 135 values are privileged. Hu Feng, by contrast, was more determined to put May Fourth realism and the enlightenment theme to the test in the battle- ground of lived, sensuous experience. His account of the creative process in which a militant, oppositional subjectivity takes shape grasped the historical difficulty and complexity of the issue. He also made tireless efforts to relate the theoretical and epistemological question of subjectiv- ity to the practical issues of realism and form. Owing to historical limita- tions, however, Hu Feng's solutions and conclusions were partial and incomplete. Although he paid close attention to the problem of mediation of form, his theory fell short of probing the complex discursive formation in representing subjectivity. How the subjective fighting spirit can actu- ally combat the feudalist popular culture and "spiritual slavery" and create a new, alternative revolutionary discourse is never clear in Hu Feng's theory. Neither Li Zehou nor Liu Zaifu successfully engage the problems of form and language in their reflections of subjectivity. Never- theless, the central concern of both Li Zehou and Liu Zaifu is a formal one: it has to do with the structure of perception, or the form of aesthetic experience, be it psychological (in the case of Li Zehou) or ontological (in the case of Liu Zaifu). There is generally a lack of self-consciousness of the formal constraints in their own cultural reflections. Both exhibit a strong aesthetic inclination in their conceptualization of culture, litera- ture, and subjectivity. The aestheticizing impulses of Li Zehou, Liu Zaifu, and other contem- porary Chinese cultural critics seem to parallel a tendency in western contemporary cultural theories. The tendency in the west is to model social and historical analysis on aesthetic modes, and increasingly to distance cultural and literary criticism from social engagement.55 In the west, it is a question of the paradoxical phenomenon of escalating inter- penetration and fragmentation of social life. It has bewildered western intellectuals and made radical social engagement increasingly difficult. The recent debates about modernism and postmodernism have touched on fundamental issues in contemporary late capitalist society; but the de- bates themselves remain confined within the academy, with little impact upon social and political life. Such is also the fate of marxist cultural theory in the west. The political and ideological consequences and effects of academic cultural criticism, then, have become the central preoccupa- tion among many critics, especially those who identify with marxist critical approaches. In China, the recent bloodshed at Tiananmen Square serves as a pow- erful reminder as to how politics - that is, political struggles at the level of power structures, social institutions and daily life - has been en- tangled with every single instance, be it cultural, economic, or otherwise. Compared to this Chinese experience, the debate in western academia as to which side of culture is more important, the rhetorical or the pragmatic,</page><page sequence="23">136 Subjectivity, Marxism &amp; Culture Theory in China often seems trivial and inconsequential. I do not mean to belittle the important insights generated by recent theoretical debates in the west. But I think the obsession with language and discourse in the realm of culture has obscured more grievous issues in the non-linguistic social practices. Yet, Chinese cultural critics can benefit from western cultural theories in terms of rethinking the questions of ideology and power, domination and resistance, science and ethics. What can be learned from western cultural debates and theories is a new way of looking at the relationship between culture and politics. Cultural practices are inseparable from politics. Indeed, cultural events should be seen as political interventions. Just as the 1966-76 "Cultural Revolution" is indisputably a political intervention of Mao's faction within the Party and state, so too are the Chinese civil society and cultural debates of the 1980s forms of political intervention of the forces outside and against the Party and state. Contemporary western critical theories are shifting their attention in- creasingly to critiquing modern western ideological myths such as "mo- dernity," "democracy" and "humanism." These western assumptions are also deeply embedded in the attempts of Chinese thinkers such as Li Zehou and Liu Zaifu to establish a new cultural myth for the future of China by disengaging marxism from its political contexts and aestheticiz- ing, or culturizing, marxism. But the humanist, aesthetic "essence" of marxism that the Chinese thinkers try to recover is precisely the kind of ideological myth that is now subject to rigorous demystification. We then must ask ourselves: what shall we do, both in China and elsewhere, to carry on the project of cultural critique in this post-revolutionary age?

These two articles inaugurated the subjectivity debate. Hu Feng's "subjective idealist"views were then under fierce attack by orthodox communist critics. In a report at the 1949 Congress of Chinese Cultural Workers held in Beijing, China's foremost leftist writer Mao Dun summarized the debate as follows: "They [Hu Feng and his colleagues] on the one hand stressed the defects of the people caused by feudalist rule, and took as their</page><page sequence="24">Liu Kang 137 fundamental task to combat these defects of the people. On the other hand, they valorized uncritically the individualistic and spontaneous struggles of the people. They regarded these struggles as healthy primitive vitality, and as the driving forces of history, rather than the conscious struggles of collectivism.... These are in fact petit-bourgeois fantasies departing from the real life of the people. The discussions of literary subjectivity must therefore boil down to the problem of writer's ideological standpoint and attitude, as raised in Comrade Mao Zedong's Yanan Talks. If a writer cannot totally abandon his petit-bourgeois standpoint in order to become one with the people, then the issue of literary popularization cannot be fully resolved." (quoted from Wang Yao, Zhongguo xin wenxue shi gao - A history of Chinese new literature, Shanghai, 1982:596-97) Ironically, by 1949, Mao Dun, once the main proponent of May Fourth realism, having given up creative writings and assumed the official post of the cultural minister in the new government, had to recant the "petit-bour- geois flaws" in that realist tradition. 6.

Periodicals such as the highbrow Dushu (Reading), Beijing wenxue (Beijing literature) and Shanghai wenxue (Shanghai literature), academic journals like Wenxue yanjiu (Literature Studies), Shehui kexue zhanxian (Front of social sciences) and Dangdai zuojia pinglun (Review of contemporary writers) carried articles that challenged fundamental precepts of the official cultural and literary policies. The 1989 Democracy Movement in China that ended in bloodshed was directly linked to the emergent civil society, where the ideas of democratic society and individual freedom were spawned. Little of the literature hitherto about the '89 Democracy Movement, however, has discussed the relation between the two from theoretical perspectives. A most recent discussion in English of Chinese marxist thoughts between 1978 and 1986 is Bill Brugger and David Kelly, Chinese Marxism in the Post-Mao Era (Stanford, 1990). But as the authors of this book acknowledged, the debates in aesthetics and literary theory, as well as the important developments since the mid-80s, remain unexplored. 18. For a recent discussion of civil society in Post-Mao China presented by one of its most prominent figures, namely Su Shaozhi, the former director of the Institute of Marxism-Le- ninism-Mao Zedong Thought at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, see Su Shaozhi, Barry McCormick, and Xiao Xiao Ming, "The 1989 Democracy Movement: A Review of the Prospects for Civil Society in China," The Chinese Intellectual, vol.6, no.3 (New York,1991), p.8-16.

Gilles Deleuze's Kant's Critical Philosophy (Minneapolis, 1984) p.49-50; p.68-75 offers a critique of Kant's anthropomorphic tendency, which serves as a good reference to Li Zehou's characterizations of Kant. Also see P.van De Pitte, Kant as Philosophical Anthropologist (The Hague, 1971). 23. Marx, Karl Coletti ed. Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts ,(1975) p.351-354. 24. Li Zehou is mainly interested in Wittgenstein's later thoughts on the interrelation of language and social practice. But he is quick to point out the basic difference between Wittgenstein and Marx: the former errs precisely in prioritizing language over social practice. See Li Zehou (1984) p.57; (1986) p.284. Ironically, it is the same later Wittgenstein who reversed his early notion of the determination of pre-linguistic reality over the structure of language, and placed greater emphasis on language as a constituting force rather than a constituted entity. For Wittgenstein, language and social practice are inseparable, whereas Li Zehou insists on the absolute determination of material practice over language. See Susan Easton, Humanist Marxism and Wittgensteinian Social Philosophy (Manchester, 1983) p.83-96, and David Rubinstein, Marx and Wittgenstein (Boston:1981). 25.

I owe the point on Habermas's connection to Piaget to Fredric Jameson, who has kindly offered his incisive comments on this paper. For a deconstructive critique of Habermas's Kantian rationalism and his appropriations of Piaget, see Michael Ryan, Politics and Culture: Working Hypotheses for a Post-Revolutionary Society, chapter 1, "Critical Theory and Social Policing" (Baltimore, 1989) p.27-45. Terry Eagleton also maintains that "it is possible to see in Habermas's ideal speech community an updated version of Kant's community of aesthetic judgement." See his The Ideology of the Aesthetic (Oxford, 1990), p.405. 28. Li Zehou, (1984) p.56-58; 160; (1986) p.281-296; 274-280. 29. Li Zehou, (1986) p.84-290. For the Lacanian notion of the unconscious, see Lacan, Ecrits (New York, 1977) p.2-7; 192-199. It must be added that aside from his reliance on Piaget, Kant, and Marx, Li Zehou belabors to relate the psychologically oriented Confucian notion of ren (benevolence - -as it is inadequately rendered in English), to the process of sedimentation and the constitution of "cultural-psychological formation." Briefly, Li Zehou interprets ren as a psychological internalization of li (propriety, rite), the external rules governing human behavior, which are derived from the rules and regulations of the rituals of ancestor worship. Fundamental to these two pivotal concepts in Confucianism - li and ren - is the emphasis not so much on the corporeal pleasure of sexuality and its attendant tension and guilty conscience, epitomized by the Oedipal Complex, as on kinship, parental love and care, related essentially to procreative, anthropological and biological aspects of sexuality. As the development of the highly sophisticated and elaborate Confucian system of li- system of rites and rituals - indicates, sexuality has from very early on been rationalized and anthropomorphized in Chinese society. Apparently, this has certain signif- icant bearings on Li Zehou's almost complete disregard of Freud in his discussion of sedimentation and cultural-psychological formation, since Freudianism always looks sus- pect in view of the Confucian rationalist psychology (reinterpreted, of course, through Li Zehou's appropriation of certain western models). 30.

Li Zehou admits that "Piaget's final resolution in his genetic epistemology lies in biology rather than in history" (1984:55). But he does not discuss further how to overcome this inherent gap between biological and genetic models of human psychology and historical consciousness of mankind. Some critics point out that ultimately it is language, or symbolic formation, that seems to provide a meeting ground for Piagetian biological, developmental models and Freudian psychoanalysis. See Hans Furth, Knowledge As Desire: An Essay on Freud and Piaget (New York, 1987). Fredric Jameson, on the other hand, tries to recover from Lacanian notions of the subject formation a Utopian site for reinscribing subjectivity into history.

Liu Zaifu has borrowed freely from existentialism and phenomenology to reinforce his ontological characterization of the aesthetic subjectivity. He is receptive to archetypal criticism, structuralism, reception theory, and psychoanalysis, engaging Heidegger, Freud, Lacan, and Derrida. In his recent article, Liu Zaifu writes:"Subjectivity is not simply consciousness...it is being itself." "Subjectivity is first and foremost a question of ontology rather than epistemology." "The highest value is man's ontological value of being...no matter whether it exists in the temporal form of 'present' or in the 'past,' the highest value of his being is always already embodied in the meaning of being here and now."By treating literature as "the symbolic world of man's spiritual freedom," Liu Zaifu actually repeats Heideggerian aesthetic existentialist propositions on literature and arts. Liu Zaifu also suggests that human subjectivity has a dimension of opposition and transcendence over cultural and symbolic construct, which will enable him ultimately overcome the aporia of</page><page sequence="27">140 Subjectivity, Marxism &amp; Culture Theory in China the language prisonhouse and cultural constraints he himself has built.
