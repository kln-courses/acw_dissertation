E2 Od. 4A11, var. 1. Zenodo- tus, HQ) and supported by some moderns,3 but the form itself is unex- pected. Even supporters of the usual interpretation admit that 6u- is a very odd way of saying "from Zeus," which should be expressed by a 1This interpretation goes back to the scholia ad locc.

DREW GRIFFITH genitive of source:4 indeed, when Euripides wants to characterize a statue as having "fallen from the sky," he uses 6iojtexr|g (77977; cf. fr. 971 Nauck2). They account for 5ll? in one of three ways: either as chosen on the analogy of 5ii(()iAog where the dative is appropriate,5 or as a compen- dious expression meaning "by (the command of) Zeus,"6 as an Arcado- Cypriot use of the dative as an ablative.7 This last approach relies in turn on the hypothesis (itself controversial) of an Achaean stratum of the Homeric language, in which are alleged to persist forms specific to the Mycenaean dialect.8 Second, the final element, -Jtexr|g, is elsewhere in Homer derived from Jtexopm (vijiutexrig //. 12.201, etc; (bxujtexrig //. 8.42, etc; cf. 'Qxu- jtExri Hes. Theog. 267). Unlike 5iut8xr|g, these words are accented par- oxytone (but note jtccXijiJEexeg //. 16.395, Od. 5.27, which means "falling or flying backward"; i)i]JiJEexr|g Pind. Pyth. 3.105; and &amp;njtexr|g Aesch. Supp. 782), but this shows only that during the Alexandrian period, when the written accents were devised, scholars associated them with a different root from 6iutexr|g. Leaving our word aside, for examples of -jtexrig derived from Jiijtxco we must look to Aeschylus, Pindar, and sub- sequent authors.9 (Words with -Jtexrig from jtexdvwjn are attested in later Greek.)10 Third, the earliest post-Homeric uses of 6iutexr|g (Eur. Bacch. 1267, Rhes. 43, Hypsipyle fr. 1. sp. IV, 1.31 Bond; Hippoc. Morb. Mul 1.24) demand the translation "translucent" vel sim. (Etym. Magn. s.v.), and Zenodotus (apud schol. //. 17.263) glosses the word in its Homeric use as diouyrig,11 yet the semantic development from "fallen from Zeus, etc." (on the usual interpretation) to "translucent" can only be seen as "en- core inexplique."12 4E.g., Chantraine 1968-, I 282; J.

Sen. Q.Nat. 4.2.28-30, 6.8.3-5; schol. Ap. Rhod. 4.269 = p. 277 Wendel). The application of the epithet to the Nile would have, therefore, to be classed among Homer's (admittedly numerous) formulary illogicalities.13 Not all scholars accept the usual view. In 1958 M. Treu pointed to a then newly discovered papyrus fragment of Alcman containing the ad- jective 5iaucexf|g in the phrase [&amp;]xiq dyXdfeJvTog aoxrjQ / d)Qavcb 5iai- Jtexrig (III66-67 PMG, PMGF = fr. 26.66-67 Calame), which was taken to describe a star "falling through ..., less prob. ... flying through" heaven (LSJ Suppl. s.v.),14 to hypothesize that the Homeric instances of 5iut8xf|g are all miscorrections of an original 5iaucexf|g, "flying through." This theory has won few adherents,15 and R. Renehan (1972b) has with more probability argued exactly the opposite case, that Alcman's 5iai- Jtexf|g is a dialectical variant of Homer's 6ieutexr|c; (sic); but there is an- other alternative to the usual view, which Treu rejects in arguing his own position. The sense in which 6iutexr|c; is used in its first nonformular oc- currence, olcovoijg xe duxexeac, (Hymn. Hom. Ven. 4; cf. Nonnus Dion. 5.200, where the adjective is applied to winds), is "flying in the sky," which implicitly derives -Jtex- from Jtexojxai and takes 5u- as a locatival dative, and the Sanskritist H. Lttders ([1951] 1959, I 11) translates the word in the phrase 5iutexeoc; Jtoxa^ioio in this same way as "am Himmel fliegend oder fliessend." A flying river should cause no surprise. As Treu remarks (1958, 269), "der metonymische Gebrauch von Tliegen' im Griechischen weiter verbreitet als bei uns": for examples, Greek thun- derbolts "fly" (Aesch. fr. 160.2 TrGF = Ar.Av. 1246, Soph. OC1460, Eur. Her. 179, Suppl 860, Bacch. 90). Some have mooted a derivation of 13Aegisthus is "blameless" although an adulterous murderer (Od. 1.29); ships are "swift" when beached (//. 16.123) and even when turned to stone (Od. 13.168), as are very slow horses (//. 23.301-12); bronze is "shining" when in a fire (Od. 10.360); stars "seen in all their glory" when the moon is out (//. 8.555); and a river "lovely" when clotted with corpses (//. 21.218). See Combellack 1965. 14But see Zudini 1975-76; Renehan 1972a, 44 and 1972b. Renehan sees Alcman's word as Laconian for the Homeric Sieutexf|g (sic), which he translates as "bright." 15E.g., Hooker 1979, 115-17; Van der Valk 1963-64, 256 n. 278; Chantraine 1968-, 1282.</page><page sequence="4">356 R. DREW GRIFFITH jtoxajiog from Jtexojiai16 (the communis opinio derives it from mjcxco),17 and in the Rigveda we read that "the rivers run by Varuija's command- ment_swift have they flown like birds in air around us" (xtdm sin- dhavo varuqasya yanti.... vdyo nd paptu raghuyti pdrijman 2.28.4).18 A Plautine sycophant tells a false tale of a journey ad caput amnis, quod de caelo exoritur sub solio lovis (Trin. 940, no equivalent in the meager remains of Philemo Thesaurus frr. 32-33 PCG). Although rejected by Treu, Luders's view has been accepted by R. Schmitt and V. Pisani,19 and I would follow these scholars in arguing that Homer's phrase describes a "river flying in the sky," that is, a "celestial river."20 But what could possibly be meant by this? Liiders believed that Homer's formula and the Vedic passage might be vestiges of an Indo- European poetic formula comparable to the celebrated pair xXeog a&lt;()0i- xov (//. 9.413, Hes. fr. 70.5 Merkelbach-West, Sappho fr. 44.4 Lobel- Page, Voigt, Ibycus I 47 PMG = S151.47 PMGF, fr. 2.1 Hansen, CEF) and srdvas dksitam (RV 1.9.7, 1.40.4, 8.103.5, 9.66.7). Yet despite the probably cognate origin of pat and Jtexopm, the specific formulations sindhavi.. .paptu...parijman and 6iutex8og Jtoxa^ioto are not espe- cially close; in particular, parijman, here translated as "in air around us," means "going (V gam) around (pari = JteQi)," hence "ubiquitous," and derives its connection with air from the present context. Furthermore, K. Hoffmann observes that Vedic birds, to which the rivers are com- pared in RV 2.28.4, do not fly in heaven (divi), which would answer to Homer's 5u-, but in the air (antdrik?e, antdrik?ei}a, e.g., RV 1.25.7ab, 10.80.5c).21 The Vedic image of flying rivers is in any case more likely to have been inspired by the mighty Indus than by any stream in the Indo-European Urheimat, wherever exactly that may have been. In view of the application of the formula to the Nile at Od. 4.477 and 581, we might look to Egypt rather than to India for an explanation. For the ancient Egyptians, the Nile had no name: it was simply the "river" (itrw &gt; Hebrew ye'or [Gen. 41:1, etc.]) or in the appropriate sea- son the annual "inundation" (tipy).22 This same river, they believed, flowed through heaven, with its course mirroring its earthly path.

How effective they are, thy plans, O lord of eternity! The Nile in heaven (hcpy m pt), it is for the foreign peoples And for the beasts of every desert that go upon (their) feet; (While the true) Nile Qipy) comes from the underworld for Egypt.23 The celestial Nile by day was the course along which the sun god, Ra, traveled in his barque (mcndt),24 and by night it was visible as the Milky Way (Book ofthe Dead Spell 99).25 The Homer scholiasts already knew that the Egyptians believed the Nile to flow from heaven (xov jtoxajxov xouxov... xaxa xovq Aiyuitxioug ouQavoBev qeiv, schol. Od. 4.477). The Nile is, therefore, truly a "celestial river." At first, this conception appears to be wholly alien to Greek cos- mology, in which heaven is a solid vault of bronze (//. 17.425, Pind. Nem. 6.3-4) or iron (Od. 15.329 = 565) across which the Sun rides in a horse- drawn chariot,26 while his barque (usually described as a cup or bed) does not cross the sky but carries him around the River Ocean from his place of setting to his rising place (Stesichorus 185 PMG = S17 PMGF, Aesch. fr. 69 TrGFf Mimnermus fr. 12 IEG, Pherecyd. 118 FGrHist.).27 Yet the Greeks were interested in the appearance of the earth as viewed from the sky (cf. Ar. Av. 46-48, Pl. Phd. 110b) and a passage in Pindar de- 23Pritchard 1969, 371. The original text is printed in Davies 1908, pl. XXVII cols. 9-10. Liiders ([1951] 1959,1140-43) quotes this passage as well as Rigveda 2.28.4, but nei- ther Treu (1958), who rejects his view of diutetrig, nor Schmitt (1967) and Pisani (1969), who accept it, makes mention of it (but see Humbach 1967, 277; Zudini 1975-76, 22 n. 51). 24Ions 1965,42.

Hesiod described the constella- tion Draco as being itoxa\i(b Qeiovxi eoixobg (fr. 293 Merkelbach-West; cf. Verg. G. 1.245), and the constellation simply called Hoxa\i6q (Aratus Phaenomena 358-60) was identified either with the legendary river Eri- danus (Hes. Theog. 338, etc), or with the Nile (schol. Aratus Phaeno? mena 359 = pp. 254-55 Martin).29 Hesychius seems to suggest that even the foremost river, Ocean, sometimes followed a celestial course (s.v. 'Qxecxvolo jcoqov xov &amp;eq(x, Eig Sv al ijruxai xoov xeXeuxcdvxcdv djco- XCdqowiv).

Celestial and earthly rivers may be connected despite the lack of any visible links, as the Arethusan Spring in Syracuse and the River Alpheus at Olympia were believed to be one and the same (cf. Pind. Nem. 1.1, Paus. 5.7.2-3, Verg.?c/. 10.1, Aen. 3.694-95). The Mycenaeans were in contact with Egypt,31 particularly during ^Wilamowitz 1913,131; cf. De Vries 1956, 445. The idea of the earth and sky as mu- tual reflections is enhanced by the perception of the epic poets that the sky is not a dome (as in later cosmological thinking, e.g., Ar. Nub. 96, Av. 1000-1001) but rather is as flat as the earth and parallel to it (see West 1966,198 ad Hes. Theog. 127). 29The presence of water in the heavens is further suggested by the fact that part of the sky was occupied by aquatic constellations: Capricorn, Cetus, Pisces, Aquarius, and Argo; see Rudhardt 1971, 79-80. Babylonian astronomers were familiar with a river (= halo?) around the moon; (see Gelb 1964-, XI.l 376 s.v. naru 3b), and Babylonian myth speaks of waters above the sky (Enilma elish tablet IV w. 137-40); see Barton 1890-93,11 and Heidel 1951, 42; cf. Gen. 1:6-7, 7:11, 2 Kings 7:2,19, Psalms 104:3,13,148:4, Revelation 4:6. 30The statement at //. 14.309 that Hera goes to the home of deep-flowing Ocean is appropriate in part to the anthropomorphic, in part to the naturalistic conception of the god. Fowler (1987, 122 n. 46) writes that "the imaginative power of the ancients which en- abled them to see the person behind the phenomenon cannot be underestimated." 31Evidence for contact between Mycenaean Greece and Egypt includes the occur-</page><page sequence="7">HOMERIC AIIIIETEOZ IIOTAMOIO AND THE CELESTIAL NILE 359 the Amarna period,32 at the time when the epic vocabulary was being formed. While the possibility of coincidence between two independent phrases can never be ruled out completely, the evidence considered here leads me to suggest that on the model of the Egyptian hcpy m pt, the Greek poets coined the phrase Siutexeog Jtoxa^oto to modify Ai- yxmxoTo, as at Od. AA11 and 581, and that it referred specifically to that river (ancient commentators associated the anonymous river of the sim- ile in which the phrase occurs at //. 17.263 with the Nile).33 The formula will early have been given a wider application, for, as the constellation noxa^iog and the above-cited passages from the Rigveda and Plautus suggest, other rivers as well as the Nile could be thought of as flying in the sky.34 The history of the formula would thus be parallel to the idea, manifested in epic in various forms, of "black earth," which, I have ar- gued (1996), was coined as a tribute to the introduction by the Danaans of irrigation technology into Argos, with its conspicuously reddish- brown soil, from the "Black Land" (Xr]|iia, Plut. Mor. 364C) of Egypt. We can now see that Alcman applied the word, in the different spelling of his dialect, appropriately to his heavenly star, and the transition of meaning from "celestial" in the epos to "translucent" in Euripides and Hippocrates now need rely on no hypothetical Umwertung of the Ho? meric expression,35 for brightness and purity are the foremost qualities of all bodies of heavenly origin.36 Queen's University klngston, ontario, canada e-mail: Griffitd@post.queensu.ca rence of the word "Egyptian" on the Linear B tablets (Ventris and Chadwick 1973,136), the discovery of Egyptian objects in Greece (Pendlebury 1930), the discovery of Greek ob- jects in Egypt (see note 32 below), and the mention in the Odyssey of Egyptian Thebes as a place from which visitors could bring back rich presents (4.126-27) and of the River Ae- gyptus, which men visited for trade or piracy (14.257-65,17.423-34).
