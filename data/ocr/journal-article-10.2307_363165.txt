<plain_text><page sequence="1">EDWARD TAYLOR'S POETRY EVAN PROSSER THE world of Edward Taylor's poetry is essentially a closed one, limited by the framework of Taylor's religious vision. As a Puritan clergyman Taylor was committed to a scheme of values, an outlook on the created universe, from which he could deviate very little. My purpose in this essay is to examine his poetry to determine how its structure and central imagery reflect major themes of his theological framework, and par- ticularly to discover in what way peculiar to Taylor poetry it- self is a religious expression. I One of the most important underlying themes in Taylor's verse is evident in the very presentation of the Preparatory Meditations. That each poem is preceded by a scriptural pas- sage upon which it is based indicates that the poet is not en- gaged in independent inquiry so much as in contemplation of an already revealed truth. The universe of this poet is closed to searching after novel interpretations of reality. The truth behind the world and his experience is given him in the Bible; he takes as his task the explication of scriptural revelation in terms of daily life on earth. Taylor's conviction that analogies of Biblical doctrine can be found in his immediate surround- ings is founded on a generally held Puritan idea that, as John Cotton put it, the world is a "mappe and shaddow of the spir- itual estate of the soules of men." As far as Taylor's poetry indicates, the discovery of analogies was only as difficult as reading a map. By and large, any struggle involved in the dis- covery of the unity of doctrine and experience remains out- side the poem. What we are given in the verse is a vision of a world in which God, Nature, and man are in blessed harmony. Intimacy with God is shown to exist on many levels. Taylor is enough in tune with God to be part of an immediate cause- and-effect relationship with Him, as in "The Return" (p. 9)1, 1 References to Taylor's poetry are to the texts in The Poems of Edward 375</page><page sequence="2">376 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY where Taylor refers to his "Rich Grace, thy Image bright, making me pray," or, more extravagantly: When thou dost shine, a Sunshine day I have: When I am cloudy then I finde not thee: When thou dost cloud thy face, thy Face I crave. The Shining of thy face enlivens mee. I live and dy as Smiles and Frowns take place: The Life, and Death of Joy Lodge in thy face. -97(II) Sometimes the feeling of extreme closeness to God is expressed in the assurance that man can be higher in the scale of being than angels: Such Mortall bits immortallized shall ware More glorious robes, than glorious Angells bare. -46(I) At times his feeling of intimacy comes out in a general affirma- tion of the inevitability of his glory in heaven, despite difficul- ties he may experience on earth: May my Rough Voice, and my blunt Tongue, but spell My Tale (for tune they can't) perhaps there may Some Angell catch an end oft up, and tell In Heaven, when he doth return that way, He'l make thy Palace, Lord, all over ring With it in Songs, thy Saint, and Angells sing. -23(I) Intimacy is the natural relationship between man and God in the closed world where, in Taylor's theology, man and God necessarily interact at close quarters. The "container" theme in Taylor's imagery is the most persistent one running through the poetry that serves to create a closed-world atmosphere. Taylor, edited by Donald E.

(p. 458) The central idea here and throughout this sort of very common imagery is that one is enclosed by and with Christ, united and forever living together. Characteristic of this is the explicit "lodging" theme: ... make my flesh thy Tent, and tent with in't. -24(11) Thou art my Refuge City, and shall bee. -28(II) Another set of associated images having the same general function is that of box, lock and key, used separately or to- gether, as in A Divine key unlocks these trunks to lay All spirituall treasures in them open Cleare. -103(II) Among the many homely containers such as cabinet, still, bottle, vessel, bag, barrel, there are echoes of Biblical usages, as with the ark: Life thus abusde fled to the golden Arke, Lay lockt up there in Mercie's seate inclosde ... -33(I) and the concept of being clothed in glory: They'r Gods Elect, and thy Selected Ones, Whose Inward man doth ware rich robes of Grace. --109(11) Taking its inspiration largely, though not exclusively, from the Canticles, another of the prominent container themes, that of the garden, is also expressive of the life that can go on</page><page sequence="4">378 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY within a world whose basic organization is not to be ques- tioned. Particularly in a Christian context, where "garden" calls to mind the Garden of Eden, "garden" is an appropriate container image for Taylor, carrying with it the idea of an enclosed plot carefully organized and tended by an agent from the outside. Just as the static quality of the box-lock themes is often relieved by a "key's" introducing change and interplay, Christs Key of grace this Cabinet unlocks And offers thee, -123(A) (III) so with the garden theme the feeling of growth imparts vitality to the concept. Taylor can be the garden wherein growth takes place ("Lord, make me th'Vally where this Lilly grows" -69(11) ), or he can be the growing flower taking real nourish- ment from "Spice Divine" and achieving thereby a lively felt motion, as in the sailing image here: Com'st thou to get thy Lillies? Get me so. Then I shall be well fed, and made all fine. Thine Ordinances then brieze Spicy gailes Filling of thy, and my Delights the Sails. --131(II) In theological terms this freedom of movement within a de- termined framework has its basis in covenant theology, where freedom and authority were not considered incompatible for the soul which had entered into the Covenant of Grace. In the "Speech to the General Court," John Winthrop opposes this kind of liberty to "natural" or pre-covenant liberty: The other kind of liberty I call civil or federal; it may also be termed moral, in reference to the covenant between God and man in the moral law ... This liberty is maintained and exercised in a way of subjection to authority ... The woman's own choice makes such a man her husband; yet being so chosen, he is her lord, and she is subject to him, yet in a way of liberty, not of bondage.</page><page sequence="5">EDWARD TAYLOR'S POETRY 379 Later we will see the importance of this doctrine for Taylor's conception of man's response to God's grace. Here let it suffice to note that Taylor's contained universe is not necessarily static or sterile. In a universe contained and organized by God, Taylor seeks to discover truths about God's universe by explicating isolated elements of God-given reality. We have already noted an out- standing example of this procedure, the prefixing of a scrip- tural source to each of the poems. Characteristic of the minute consideration that Taylor gives these revelations of truth is his tendency to linger over his texts. It is as though he were inlay- ing his closed universe with fragments from the scriptures, laboriously pasting them up piece by piece, just as we have seen him ask Christ's Spirit to his "Soule Inlay With such rich lining, Graces Web." He writes a series of seven Medita- tions on I Corinthians 3: 21-23. Each of these Meditations, 31-37(I), takes as its basis a single phrase from the short scrip- tural passage; and even then the bulk of the quotations are from one of the three verses only. Similarly in the Second Series, three Meditations (96-98) are based on Canticles 1:2, "Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for thy love is better than wine." Taylor dwells with prolonged attention on the significance of the number seven in a way characteristic of his process of reading significances into events from the scripture or from everyday life. In the Twenty-first Meditation of the Second Series he speaks of the wonder instilled in him by the perfec- tion of the number seven and follows his usual practice of singing praises of what he feels to be expressive of God's en- compassing perfection: What Secret Sweet Mysterie under the Wing Of this so much Elected number lies? What Vean can e're Divine? Or Poet sing? Doubtless most Rich. For such shew God most Wise. I will adore the same although my quill Can't hit the String that's tun'd by such right skill.</page><page sequence="6">380 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY Probably it is not coincidental that Taylor chooses to speak of the mystery of the number seven in the twenty-first Medita- tion of the Series. Multiples of seven have a special mystery. Taylor builds a tidily packaged, closed system, analogous to his vision of a closed universe when he takes the square of the perfect number for the number of poems in the First Series of Meditations. Taylor's use of typology, whereby events and personages of the Old Testament are interpreted as prefigurations of events in the New Testament, is straightforward and thoroughgoing. The main body of the specifically typological poems begins with the Second Series and takes up most of the series through the Thirtieth Meditation. While the particular aim of each of the Meditations in this group is to bring out foreshadowings of Christ in such Old Testament figures as Moses, Abraham, Jonah, and Isaiah, Taylor suggests that the real focus of typol- ogy and allegorical reading in general is the mystery of God. Types reach beyond their immediate subject to give evidences of a glory they cannot actually present: The glory of the world slickt up in types In all Choise things chosen to typify, His glory upon whom the worke doth light To thine's a Shaddow, or a butterfly. The glory of all Types doth meet in thee. Thy glory doth their glory quite excell. --1(II) In the fourth Meditation of the Series the distance between man's portion of the truth and the actual glory is put in terms of types: The brightest Saints that rose, do Star like, pinck. Nay, Abrams Shine to thee's an Allegory, Or fleeting Sparke in th'Smoke, to typify Thee, and thy Glorious Selfe in mystery. Allegorical reading is not confined to the Scriptures. In some</page><page sequence="7">EDWARD TAYLOR'S POETRY 381 of the "Miscellaneous Poems" Taylor interprets natural events just as he does those of the Bible and winds up with the same kind of partial vision we have just seen. In "Upon a Wasp Child with Cold," Taylor hopes to "view thy Divinity" through observation of the wasp "In whose small Corporation wee A school and a schoolmaster see." (p. 465) "Upon a Spider Catching a Fly" contains descriptions that have the same kind of allegorical application as is usual in a typological comparison. The spider's web is said To tangle Adams race In's stratigems To their Destructions, spoil'd, made base By venom things Dam'd Sins. (p. 464) Taylor's use of the typological approach both in typology proper and in the allegorical reading of nature introduces a central problem in the poetry. God has provided man with truths of existence that apply to both his everyday life and his relations with the divine. He presents these to man in the Book of the Bible and the Book of Nature for him to read. The only problem is, is man able to read these accounts accurately? Taylor answers that without grace man cannot interpret God's revelations. It is possible to mistake Taylor's position here if we fail to see the two distinct frames of reference within which Taylor speaks. Sometimes he speaks from the world as seen by the sinner, and sometimes he speaks of the world as seen by the saint. Confusion between these two can lead to a misunder- standing of the respective roles of man and God in man's salvation. Statements made from the point of view of the definitely saved soul necessarily feature visions of close cobperation be- tween man and God. Partly because of the inevitable limita- tions of human language and partly because of Taylor's special doctrine, which we shall see outlined in the Christographia, it is also necessary for Taylor to describe their co6peration in anthropomorphic imagery, as in Meditation 131(11):</page><page sequence="8">382 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY Here thus is Entertainment sweet on this. Thou feedst thyselfe and also feedest us, Upon the spiced dainties in this Dish. Oh pleasant foodl Both feed together thus; Well spicde Delights do entertain thee here. And thou thine entertain'st with thy good Cheare. When such intimacy is indicated by what appears to be an actual bargaining between man and God, as later in the same Meditation, it is particularly difficult not to begin to believe that for Taylor God was not very much exalted above man: If I'm thy lilly made by Grace's Art I shall adorn thy Palace fragrantly. And when thou mee thy spic'de bed interst in I'le thee on my Shoshannim Spic'de Songs sing. But we should bear in mind that such expressions of joy are made by a soul who either has a vision of the graceful state or for some reason has very high hopes. Representative passages from parts of the poetry where Tay- lor is in less exalted moods make clear that anthropomorphic imagery is dictated more directly by the necessities of lan- guage than by a feeling of natural affinity to God. Especially in a passage dealing with divine as opposed to human wisdom we get a glimpse of the tremendous gap that can exist between God and a sinner, a gap that can be closed only by supplication. Unlock thy Locker, make my faith Key here To back the Wards. Lord ope the Wicket gate And from thine Emerald Shelves, and Pinchase there A beame of every sort of Wisdom take And set it in the Socket of my Soule To make all day within, and night controle. -45(II) In the Christographia Taylor states explicitly the relation between human apprehension and apprehension aided by grace. In this series of sermons Taylor discourses on the dual nature of Christ, his humanity, and his divinity. It is because</page><page sequence="9">EDWARD TAYLOR'S POETRY 383 of Taylor's strict belief in the humanity of Christ that in the poetry he applies human attributes to God's actions, a habit which, as we have seen, can be a source of some confusion. The doctrinal basis for this habit is expressed in the first sermon, "The Human Nature," where Taylor explains the importance for man of God's assuming a human form: For instead of rendering of Humane Nature by Sin less than a Worm, and viler than the Earth, it prooves the opening of a doore to Advance it higher than Angells, and into a Personality with the Son of God. Oh! then how is mans nature hereby advanced, when a body is prepared of it for the Son of God?... Here then is unspeakable advantage brought to our nature in that God prepares of it a Body for his Son. (p. 25) In the third sermon, "The Personal Union," Taylor describes the Fall of man as the occasion by which man was exalted even over his innocent glory in Paradise. He speaks of the personal union that took place in the salvation of man: whereby it (human nature) is as much advanced above its first Glory in innocency, in bright- ness of Honor, and highness of excellency, as it was cast below that State in darkness of Sin, and dolefulness of Sorrow. (P- 95) This exaltation of humanity can mislead one to minimize the role of grace in Taylor's thought. It may seem that man by his own rational efforts, by way of wisdom, can attain to blessed- ness. However, the wisdom that Taylor refers to is complete only with the aid of the divine. He says of the wisdom that is Christ's: ... all Created Wisdom is in Christ: This Created Wisdom is that light that is Seated in the Intellectuall Faculty filling the Eye of the Soul with a Cleare Sight into all things that are the proper Objects thereof. (p. 122)</page><page sequence="10">384 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY Although this attribute of Christ is spoken of as human "wis- dom," what Taylor means by wisdom comes entirely from God, usually described (as above) in terms of light coming from Christ. In the twelfth sermon of the Christographia we are told just how man makes use of the given light in an image that also recurs in the poetry: The onely begotten Son, that is in the bosom of the Father hath declared God unto us, and Paul in the person of all the Prophets, who have lighted their Candles at Christs flame saith 2 Cor. 4.6: God, who hath commanded the Light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the Light of the knowledge of Glory of God in the Face of Jesus Christ. (p. 369, underscoring mine) With this doctrinal background we are in a position to lay proper emphasis on the respective roles of human and divine action whenever the two come into contact. Although descrip- tions of scenes and activity, both secular and divine, are given in metaphors of human activity, understanding of them is finally to be derived from the light of Christ. Like to a Sparkling Carbuncle up Caskt Within a Globe of Chrystall glass most cleare Fills't all with Shine which through its sides are flasht And makes all glorious shine: so much more here These treasures of thy Wisdom shine out bright In thee. My Candle with thy Flame, Lord, Light. -45(11) To emphasize the importance of humanity's efforts over the grace of divine intervention in the struggle for salvation is to distort Taylor. Taylor is always sensitive to the perilous bal- ance that exists between man's efforts and God's gift of un- merited grace. One result of the combination of this sensitivity with the intimacy with God that Taylor feels is that he is very much aware of the comings and goings of grace and worries about this: Yet pardon, Lord, give me this word again:</page><page sequence="11">EDWARD TAYLOR'S POETRY 385 I feare to wrong my self, or Gracious thee. This I can say, and can this say mentain, If thou withdrawst, my heart soon sinks in mee. Though oftentimes my Spirits dulled, grow, If so, I am, I am not always soe. -97(11) If Taylor is continually concerned about his having grace, about being able to participate in the ordered reality as uni- fied by God, he is also quite aware of where he stands in rela- tion to that desired state and what means he must employ to prepare for grace. In a Meditation on the sacrament of the Lord's Supper, the metaphorical event upon which all of his Meditations are focused, Taylor speaks of the distance between man's cognition and God's in terms of two kinds of "sense" (much like the two kinds of wisdom ("light") we have seen be- fore). The text for this Meditation is John 6:53: "unless ye eat the Flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, you have no life in you." This Sense of this blesst Phrase is nonsense thus, Some other Sense makes this a metaphor. This feeding signifies, that Faith in us Feeds on his fare, Dished in this Pottinger. Faith feeds upon this Heavenly Manna rare And drinkes this Blood. Sweet junkets: Angells Fare. -81(11) Implicit in this poem is the doctrine presented in the Chris- tographia that for the soul which has attained grace the an- thropomorphic description of the divine is meaningful. As it is stated in this poem, the seeing of metaphoric truth in the Bible or in nature necessitates that divine and human appre- hension aided by grace differ only in degree and not in kind. The universe cannot be discontinuous, but must be a con- tained whole unified by the dual nature of Christ. It is as though divine truth were a communicable virus. Man with grace is constitutionally similar enough to God to receive and nurture a germ of truth when Christ carries it from God to</page><page sequence="12">386 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY saved man. In other words, there is a continuum of inspiration and response that keeps the world unified. This continuum and its importance for Taylor's use of typology are clearly brought out in Meditation 14(II), with the familiar image of divine light and a candle: Shall not that Wisdom horded in thee (which Prophetick Types enucleate) forth shine With Light enough a Saving Light to fix On my Poore Taper? And a Flame Divine? Making my Soule thy Candle and its Flame Thy Light to guide mee, till I glory gain? It is a consequence of Taylor's vision of the continuity of human and divine experience that reason and faith are not so mutually exclusive as it might seem from such passages as these, written from the sinner side of Taylor's consciousness: Why didst thou thus? Reason stands gastered here. She's overflown: this Soares above her Sight. God's only Son for Sinners thus appeare ... -41(I) My Faith therefore doth all these Pleas disdain. Thou kindness art, it saith, and I am thine. Upon this banck it doth on tiptoes stand To ken o're Reasons head at Graces hand. -_36(I) In the One Hundred and Eighth Meditation (II), where Tay- lor is confronted with the miracle of the Lord's Supper, he states his belief in the interdependence of faith and reason for the Elect. While some theologians can simply deny the rele- vance of human reason to things of the spirit, Taylor holds for a unified reality where ultimately reason and faith work together: The Christian Faith cannot abide at least To dash out reasons brains, or blinde its eye. Faith never blindeth reasons Eye but cleares Its Sight to see things quite above its Sphere.</page><page sequence="13">EDWARD TAYLOR'S POETRY 387 II Usually it is quite clear whether Taylor is speaking as a sinner or a saint. What confusion there is comes not from any deliberate obscuring of the point of view, for Taylor usually gives clear indications of the speaker's position at any point in a poem, as in Meditation 41(I): "we whose blot's as black as inke." Confusion is more likely to arise from the constant juxtaposition of the two voices in the verse. Such juxtaposition is functional in Taylor's poetry, as the opposition between voices is the main source of dramatic tension. The two points of view are constantly being opposed and then brought into a resolution. Because both are seen as a part of a continuous sys- tem, the resolution of their conflict is always in terms of a flow from one to the other. In this opposition and its resolution we have the basic pattern behind the reciprocal processes of man's supplication for grace and his receiving of it, as Taylor sees them. The supplicating element, so evident in all of Taylor's verse, is given dramatic quality primarily by means of contrasts based on the opposition of the earthly and the heavenly. In the Thirty-fourth Meditation (I), based on the text from I Cor. 3.22 "Death is Yours," the central contrast is between life and death. Characteristically, the poem does not hold together as an organic whole, as the themes of life vs. death and self-ex- pression are not sufficiently integrated. A loose coherence is achieved, however, simply by virtue of the oppositions that similarly affect the distinct parts. In the first stanza the usual opposition of earthly means and heavenly ends ("Thy Glory far Surmounts my thoughts, my thoughts I Surmount my Words: Hence little Praise is brought."), though a stock con- ception for Taylor, made fresh many times by new conceits, does contribute to the pattern of oppositions for the body of the poem. The second stanza brings the theme of expression a bit nearer the central one of the poem, and we begin to see the kind of interaction of opposites that customarily functions in the verse. Being unable to find words to express himself, Taylor likens himself to a child whose nonsense talk is ad-</page><page sequence="14">388 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY mired by its parents. There in one word, "enfoild," ("hoping thou in this I Will finde some hearty Praise of mine Enfoild") he gives a hint of what Christ can do with a supposedly value- less thing, that is, throw light on it from a new angle and dis- cover value where there was thought to be none. This is the same treatment that death is subjected to in the four main stanzas of the poem. There death suffers eight re- versals, each one sufficient to annihilate it. In the third stanza Death is dealt a bit of its own treatment and killed by Christ. The next four reversals occur in the fourth stanza: And still thou by thy gracious Chymistry Dost of his Carkass Cordialls make rich, High, To free from Death makst Death a remedy: A Curb to Sin, a Spur to Piety. Heavens brightsom Light shines out in Death's Dark Cave. The Golden Dore of Glory is the Grave. First the chemistry of grace makes medicinal drinks from death's body, and makes the medicine effective against death itself. Death's cave becomes a source of heaven's light, and the grave is reinterpreted as the entrance into glory. In the next stanza Christ washes "Deaths grim grim face And made his Chilly finger Ends drop grace." The sixth stanza sees the grave reinterpreted again, this time as a down bed, while the seventh stanza summarizes the situation, telling how death is now a help to grace and a spur to duty. Just as with the reason-faith problem, Taylor here sees no definite separation of natures where we normally distinguish two distinct entities. In this poem, as in all of his best Medita- tions, the tension between opposites is resolved by a flowing of one into the other. There is not metamorphosis so much as there is reinterpretation, a process which reflects a basic whole- ness of a universe where all things need only to be given their proper position to participate in the unity of the whole. Throughout the Meditations Taylor is imploring that grace be given him and that the world he knows be thereby trans- formed for him into a divine environment. He describes this</page><page sequence="15">EDWARD TAYLOR'S POETRY 389 envisioned state as an intensification of the world he already knows. My branch make green: my Rose ware vivid hew An Holy and a fragrant sent out give. My kirnell ripe shall rattle out thy praise And Orient blush shall on my actions blaze. -47(1) So complete is his vision of the continuity of reality, that not only does he speak of mundane things flowing into heavenly, but he uses the same metaphor to describe the movement of grace itself from Christ to man. It can come in the form of light rays which flow ("pour"): Or as the Sun within its Azure bowre That guilds its Chrystall Walls with golden rayes It from its bowl like body, light out poures Exiling darkness, making glorious dayes. -45(11) Or it might be even the less concrete "love" which flows from heaven to man: Oh, Matchless Love! filling Heaven to the brim! O're running it ... Oh! that thy Love might overflow my Heart! To fire the same with Love: for Love I would. --1(I) Significantly the "flowing" theme is allied with firing of the poet's heart, a metaphor that is subsidiary to the flowing motif and partakes of its associations. It appears in the First Medita- tion (II) ("Oh Leaden heeld. Lord, give, forgive I pray. I Infire my Heart: it bedded is in Snow") and is the central metaphor of the poem entitled "The Ebb and Flow," which is specifically concerned with the goings and comings of grace (p. 470). An extreme of "inflame" imagery is found in Meditation 12(1), where a veritable fusing takes place upon contact with divine love by way of grace:</page><page sequence="16">390 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY Oh! Let thy Beauty give a glorious tuch Upon my Heart, and melt to Love all mee. One of the most pervading image themes of the poetry, that of the conduit, plays a large part in presenting the ideas of supplication and response. Essentially it is a metaphor for any means by which flow between man and God is facilitated. The great frequency and variety of its use give a sense of the great possibility that Taylor sees of communication between the human and the divine. The central concept of the "conduit" is brought out in the Tenth Meditation (I) on the scriptural passage from John 6:55, "My Blood is Drinke indeed," where it is allied with the principal mystery of the sacrament and its transmission of grace. Speaking of the Deity's "Aqua-Vitae" running to him from the "top of Heav'ns high Hill," he says, But how it came, amazeth all Communion. Gods onely Son doth hug Humanity, Into his very person. By which Union And rather than my Soule should dy by thirst, These Golden Pipes, to give me drink, did burst. The range of reference for this metaphor is as wide as the con- text of Taylor's poetry. A conduit can be ethereal or muddy. In the Thirty-fifth Meditation (II) we have perhaps the acme of abstraction, where in meditating on the text, "Without me yee can do nothing," Taylor sees fit to intoxicate himself on a deep draught of the word "my," which he conceives to be a mediary a conduit, between him and his Lord. My Blessed Lord, that Golden Linck that joyns My Soule, and thee, out blossoms on't this Spriuce Peart Pronoun MY more spiritous than wines, Rooted in Rich Relation, Graces Sluice. On the other hand, going to the extreme of the homely con- ceit, Taylor describes God, who has been upset because of a lack of sustenance for his Bird of Paradise, In this sad state, Gods Tender Bowells run Out streams of Grace. -8 (I)</page><page sequence="17">EDWARD TAYLOR'S POETRY 391 Some idea of progress or achievement is given to the conduit theme by the subsidiary image of "filling." There is the picture of Loveliness lifting up the joys of Saints and angels in Medi- tation 30o(I). In Meditation 8(11) we get a feeling of what one aspect of the contained, continuous universe might be for Taylor. Here the "filling" theme suggests that the absence of grace is always the presence of evil: Poore sinfull man lay grovling on the ground. Thy wrath, and Curse to dust lay grinding him. And Sin, that banisht Love out of these bounds Hath stufft the world with curses to the brim. "Filling" imagery provides a transition from the conduit con- cept to the idea of a "Fullness" of existence, wherein man and God's grace perfectly and completely interact to form a heav- enly image of the truly contained and continuous world. With the "fullness" theme we have in a way been brought full circle and can see the kind of existence there would be in God's created contained world if the supplication made for grace were completely responded to. In Meditation 47(II) Taylor allies the "filling" and "fullness" themes and gives some indi- cation of the origin of fullness in "grace oreflowing." I strike mine care not in the golden Sea Of Godhead Fulness, thine essentially. But in the Silver Ocean make my way Of All Created Fulness, thine Most high Thy Humane Glass, God wondrously did build: And Grace oreflowing, with All fulness Filld. As indicated in the phrase "thine essentially," this vision is at least partially apocalyptic and unrealizable in the human sphere. Man's inadequacy, his unfitness for participation in such a complete showering of grace, makes most references to fulness primarily descriptive of an eschatalogical state, en- visioned but not yet attained. This is the case in Meditation 51 (II), where in the fourth stanza Taylor makes it clear that he is speaking of a place outside of the earthly realm, "with grace</page><page sequence="18">392 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY out shining cleare I And brimfull full of what the World ere lackt," and then goes on to characterize it: This gracious fulness thus runs to and fro From thee to them: from them to thee again: Not as the tides that Ebbe, as well as flow. The Banks are ever Full, and so remain. What mystery's here. Thou canst not wanty bee. Yet wantest them, as sure as they want thee. In the Forty-sixth Meditation (II) Taylor makes a protestation of inadequacy: Thy Fulness, Lord, my Filberd cannot hold How should an acorn bowle the Sea lade dry? and then in the final stanza goes on to give a hint of what the vision of fullness meant for him, an apocalyptic vision which his faith requires that he hold to, even if the only promise of its fulfillment is his own hopes: All, Lord, or None at all! this makes mee dread. All is so Good, and None at all so bad. All puts faith to't: but none at all strikes dead. I'le hope for all, lest none at all makes sad. III "Gods Determinations" essentially follows patterns char- acteristic of the Meditations. The dominant imagery has the same importance and function.2 The drama in the poem, as in all of the other verse, is concerned primarily with man's rela- 2 In the first lyric of the poem is the classic example of Taylor's use of an- thropomorphic metaphors to describe divine activity. Here God is an artisan, a worker employing human methods to his work of creation. Conduit imagery is echoed here in familiar terms: "On God in Christ Call hard: For in him hee Hath Bowells melting." (p. 449) And the container theme is evident in such images as the "coach" of the clos- ing lyric (p. 458) and in the garden where it is coupled with the idea of "flowing" grace. Whence Come these Cloudy Pillars of Perfume? Sure Christ doth on his Garden blow Or open Graces Spice Box, I presume From whence these Reechs doo flow... (P. 451)</page><page sequence="19">EDWARD TAYLOR'S POETRY 393 tion to the divine, the effects of grace on him and his response to grace. Because the greater detail of this longer poem makes the connection between the giving of grace and man's re- sponse to it more evident than it is in the relatively compressed Meditations, an examination of it yields a more distinct idea of the importance of man's response to grace within the created universe. In particular, we can better determine the relevance of Taylor's own response, his songs of praise. Taylor divides the poem into three sections in the extended title: "Gods Determinations touching his Elect: and the Elects Combat in their Conversion, and Coming up to God in Christ together with the Comfortable Effects thereof." Essentially what we have here are the elements of the Meditations some- what expanded. In the first section, "Gods Determinations touching his Elect" (pp. 387-401), the basic oppositions of the poem are set up between the divine ("All") and the mundane ("Nothing"). Gave All to nothing Man indeed, whereby Through nothing man all might him Glorify. In Nothing then imbosst the brightest Gem More pretious than all pretiousness in them. But Nothing man did throw down all by Sin: And darkened that lightsom Gem in him. (P. 388) The long second part, "The Elects Combat in their Con- version" (pp. 401-451), is concerned with the crux of both this poem and Taylor's poetry in general, the effect of grace upon man. Patently he is dealing here with saved man. He says so in the title, referring to the "Elect." In "A Dialogue between Justice and Mercy" (p. 391) from the first section, the distinc- tion between the damned ("You that Extenuate your sins") and the saved ("the Humble Humble Soule") is decisively made, and the next section and rest of the poem speak of saved man only. This is the same situation we find in the rest of Taylor's poetry. Though he often speaks from the point of view of the sinful man in the Meditations, we have seen that he</page><page sequence="20">394 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY always has a feeling for God's closed universe with its inherent possibility for ultimate fullness. The wavering, the uncertainty about being saved, which we have seen expressed in the Medi- tations either in mild forms or in the extremes of degradation and exaltation of man, here come out in the dialogues recorded between the "Saint" and the (saved) "Soul" (e.g., pp. 433-444). In both cases the doubts are those of an elect soul; in "Gods De- terminations" the opposition is dramatized as the confronta- tion of two individuals. Other characters in the drama such as the "Inward Man," the "Outward Man," the "Traitors," the "Cowards," and the "feeble-hearted," function also as aspects of the poet's own sensibility. Indicative of their being parts of a single personality is the fact that they have no individuality of their own, as the response to Christ's last discourse illus- trates. Here the "Cowards" and the "feeble-hearted" ("the second, and third Ranks") answer their Savior with identical diction and feeling (pp. 450-451). As is usual in the Meditations there is no progression from unconvinced to convinced in this long section, but resolutions are indicated from time to time throughout. The kind of reso- lution offered is also characteristic of Taylor's general poetic practice. It amounts to what we have described as a reinterpre- tation of the earthly which reveals its proper role in the divine scheme. Thus in "Christ's Reply," addressed to the suffering souls, the trials of Satan are reinterpreted as mechanisms of cleansing: These White Frosts and the Showers that fall Are but to whiten thee withall. Not rot the Web they smote. If in the fire where Gold is tride Thy Soul is put, and purified Wilt thou lament thy loss? In the third and final section, "Coming up to God in Christ together with the comfortable Effects thereof" (pp. 451-459), man's proper response to the gift of grace, the singing of praises to God, is spelled out and the subtleties of the conception and</page><page sequence="21">EDWARD TAYLOR'S POETRY 395 nature of his response are indicated. In outline, the process of spiritual fulfillment involves being changed gradually by grace, ultimately being taken up into heaven and there being able to participate in the divine song of praise, in which all fulfilled creation naturally expresses itself. The gradual change in the individual effected by the workings of grace is described as occurring on two levels. As usual grace works by reinterpretation. Before the soul reaches heaven the change is only partial, as in this poem an insect remains an insect while some of its characteristics are altered: Thou didst us mould, and us new mould when wee Were worse than mould we tread upon. Nay Nettles made by Sin wee bee. Yet hadst Compassion. Thou hast pluckt out our Stings; and by degrees Hast of us, lately Wasps, made Lady-Bees. (P. 452) Once the soul has been introduced to the heavenly church ("Christ's Curious Garden fenced in With Solid Walls of Discipline"), his final transformation by grace is stated simply, "Desire converts to joy" (p. 455), but significantly with no indi- cation of causal factors and hence no temporal referent. The desire for grace is turned into the joy of having attained it with no indication of what point in the process of receiving grace is being referred to. We know that the individual men- tioned has already received a good deal of grace just to be where he now is, but the point at which grace-hoped-for be- comes grace-attained is left obscure. Throughout the poetry this is a significant ambivalence, expressed, as we have noted, in the continual wavering of the poet between certitude and doubt about his saved state. We shall see the same ambiguity affecting Taylor's role as a singer of praises. In "The Glory of and Grace in the Church set out" (p. 456) Taylor portrays in detail what heavenly singing entails. A number of elements common to much of his verse here con- verge and are set singing. It is significant that not one of the</page><page sequence="22">396 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY heavenly elements mentioned here is used elsewhere in Tay- lor's poetry in an anthropomorphic metaphor. Usually they function as expressions of means whereby Christ flows into the world, or makes his presence felt in the world. They are ele- ments of the natural scene, as flowers and pearls. They are em- bellishments to objects in the world, as perfume and gold decoration. And they are commonly recognizable intermedi- aries between the spiritual and human realms such as the Bible and the doctrine of Faith, Hope, and Charity. Yet in this poem they merge and codperate in a human activity, the sing- ing of praises: But as they stand Like Beauties reeching in perfume A Divine Hand Doth hand them up to Glories room: Where Each in sweet'ned Songs all Praises shall Sing all ore heaven for aye ... (P. 457) The use of the anthropomorphic image (singing) here to describe a definitely nonanthropomorphic, abstract heavenly unity suggests that for Taylor expression of praise in song can be more than just the making of earthly poetry. In moments inspired by grace the poet in his singing is not just expressing his own thoughts but expressing divine unity to the point of actually participating in it. The necessity for the codperation of God in this latter kind of expression is implied in the last lines of one of the last poems of "God's Determinations," where a feeling of real dependence upon God is evident: What Use of Uselesse mee, then there, poore snake? There Saints, and Angels sing, Thy praise in full Cariere, which make The Heavens to ring. Yet if thou wilt thou Can'st me raise With Angels bright to sing thy praise. (P. 458) This is the ideal, the fulfilled expression depending upon the</page><page sequence="23">EDWARD TAYLOR'S POETRY 397 attainment of the graceful state. As we have noted, Taylor in his continual wavering about the certainty of his graceful state speaks sometimes from the point of view of the sinner, some- times with the surety of a recipient of grace. These shifts in his point of view are reflected in his attitudes toward his singing of God's praises. In his less exalted moods his songs are praises sung to God. As a saved man, on the other hand, he has a vision of singing with God and thus participating in the fullness of God's contained universe. We have seen the basis for the co- operation of the Elect and God in covenant theology. It is evident now that singing in "Glories room" is a metaphor di- rectly parallel to that of growing in the garden of God's con- tained universe. Both describe the intimate interaction of man and God in the graceful state. Examples of both points of view, the sinner's and the saint's, are presented in "God's Determinations" in such a way as to indicate their respective positions with regard to the achieve- ment of grace. The instance we have just examined from the third section of the poem shows clearly the close codperation between man and God that is characteristic of the singing of praises after the achievement of grace. Earlier in the same sec- tion, before the soul has been presented with a complete vision of heavenly unity, man's singing is represented as a flowing out of song from man to God given in exchange for God's grace: Though er'e our Tongues thy Praises due can fan A Weeale with the World may fly, Yea fly away: and with a span We may out mete the Sky. Though what we can is but a Lisp, We pray Accept thereof. We have no better pay. (P. 453) With the achievement of grace, however, man's singing shifts its direction. As he is now one with God, his singing can be an expression of God's own self and is characterized as part of God's flow to man. In terms of conduit imagery the position of man in this state</page><page sequence="24">398 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY is clear. Having achieved full grace, he becomes a conduit of divine flow: I force my Tongue to tattle, as you see. That I thy glorious Praise may Trumpet right, Be thou my Song, and make, Lord, mee thy Pipe. -22(I) In effect, the fully graceful man becomes an agent of grace in the same sense we have seen Christ become a means of God's flowing toward man: Gods onely Son doth hug Humanity, Into his very person. By which Union His Humane Veans its golden gutters ly. And rather than my Soule should dy by thirst, These Golden Pipes, to give me drink, did burst. --o(I) Just as Christ, whose soul expresses itself in love, can at once achieve self-expression and participate with the divine as a conduit, so Taylor's soul finds self-expression and full par- ticipation with the divine in his singing, his poetry: Am I a bit, Lord, or thy Body? Oh! Then I do claim thy Head to be mine own. Thy Heads sweet Influence let to mee flow, That I may be thy fulness, full up grown. Then in thy Churches fullness thou shalt be Compleated in a Sense, and sung by mee. -51(II)</page></plain_text>
