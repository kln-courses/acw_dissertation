Introduction One of the objectives of the Society for Conservation Biology is "the education, at all levels, preparatory and continuing, of the public, of biologists, and of managers, in the principles of conservation biology." Education certainly promotes understanding of conservation is- sues (see Jacobson 1990), but it can also alter people's attitudes. In order to explore this hidden dimension of conservation education, we tested students' attitudes to nature at the start and end of a lecture course in con- servation biology. Methods Subjects consisted of third- and fourth-year undergrad- uate students who took a 10-week, 27-lecture under- graduate course in conservation biology at the Univer- sity of California, Davis. Between 1990 and 1992 there were 34 female students and 17 males. Forty were un- dergraduates, 29 of whom were biology majors, 7 were science-related majors, 4 were nonscience majors, and 11 were graduate students. Paper submittedJuly9, 1993; revised manuscript accepted December 5, 1993. 846 Conservation Biology, Pages 846-852 Volume 8, No. 3, September 1994 On the first day of class students were asked to re- spond to a list of 45 statements or questions and bring them to the second lecture two days later (see Appen- dix 1). The standard methodology in understanding people's attitudes to wildlife is that developed by Kellert (1976, 1980, 1991), who constructed nine attitude scales as a result of questioning a random sample of Americans (see Table 1). Initially we adopted his meth- ods and drew up five statements to address each of Kel- lert's attitude scales. Subjects could respond to each question in one of seven ways on a Likert scale: they could strongly approve, approve, mildly approve, be in- different, mildly disapprove, disapprove, or strongly dis- approve of the statement. On the last day of the course subjects completed the same questionnaire again. Con- sequently, quantititive changes in attitude from the start to the end of the course could be determined by com- paring answers to each statement on the seven-point scale. At the end of the third year, the instructor (Tim Caro) also filled out the questionnaire. Initial tests of our versions of Kellert's scales proved unreliable at both the start and end of the course as determined by the unweighted Cronbach's alpha. Alpha is a multivariate measure of correlation across the items in the scale that measures how tightly each subject is grouped across questions.

Alphas were slightly higher in the postclass survey but were only greater than 0.5 on these same scales. The maxi- mum value for alpha with any particular question was also calculated, but again no other scale came close to 0.5. We therefore abandoned Kellert's scales and instead performed a regression search procedure to determine which set of variables were most highly associated with any other set of variables. A stepwise regression was performed for each statement in the survey, with every other statement as a potential regressor. Although this approach would be unwise for hypothesis testing, it al- lowed for a comparison of all the variables and their association with other variables. Tolerances were also checked to avoid the colinearity problem that can plague stepwise procedures, but none was evident. We then took the six equations with the highest fit (r2 &gt; 0.7) and reanalyzed them with the same reliability anal- ysis we had used previously on Kellert's scales. Results By the criterion of 0.6 or above on the alpha loadings, only one scale was evident before the course (Table 2). This was a biocorrect scale that contained a constella- tion of items generally concerned with human ascen- dance over species and the environment. Several of these concerns, such as the use of styrofoam cups, had received media attention, and students were probably familiar with them. Before the class, items in this scale fitted together reasonably closely but became more dis- parate afterwards. Once the course was over, five new scales emerged with the 0.6 criterion indicating that students could now articulate new attitudes. The first scale was exploi- tation, which centered on human activities that inter- fered with natural areas and species, such as oil explo- ration in parks and use of frogs in biology teaching. The second was natural stewardship, or guidance of natural resources and captive populations. It included building tunnels for amphibians under highways. The third scale was pest rights, which was concerned with killing ver- tebrate and arthropod pests for convenience and was similar to Kellert's negativistic scale. Items in the pest rights scale became much more closely clustered after the class, suggesting that attitudes had become more coherent. The fourth scale was controlled breeding, in which students were opposed to using stray animals or animals in shelters for research or to breeding animals for research or sport. Items on this scale showed a greater association after the class. The last scale was animal rights, which involved use of animals in medi- cine and science. In the preclass survey, students had already formed biocorrect opinions and were somewhat biocentric in their attitude, indicating that the sample of students was self-selected (Fig. 1). By the end of the course, however, they had become significantly more biocorrect, show- ing greater opposition to using nature to human ends. For example, approximately 30% became more adverse to consuming hamburgers and 40% became disapprov- ing of dolphin performances. Students started out being moderately antipathetic to exploitation of wildlife but exhibited a significant increase in their disapproval of exploitation following the course. For instance, 50% of students became more adverse to oil exploration in parks and 45% to multiple use of forests. A change was also seen in students' attitudes toward natural steward- ship from being reasonably sympathetic to looking after the environment at the start to being significantly more sensitive to the issue afterwards. Most marked was the change in attitude to pest rights, with students being indifferent initially but becoming significantly more sup- portive after the course. Finally, students showed little change in attitudes toward breeding animals for re- search or sport or toward animal rights, but their atti- tudes to these issues became more coherent over the course as seen in the change in mean alphas (Table 2). To explore the possibility that students were mimic- ing their instructor rather than developing new or con- solidating latent attitudes, students' attitudes were com- pared with those of their instructor. On average, students started out with much more moderate posi- tions (Table 3); although they moved towards the in- Conservation Biology Volume 8, No. 3, September 1994</page><page sequence="3">848 Conservation Education and Attitudes Caro et al.

In general, males showed a greater percentage shift toward the attitude of their professor than did females (11.5 versus 6.7 average percentage shift across scales), al- though this was partly due to males starting further away from the instructor at the beginning of the course. Female students were more biocentric than males when they entered the course, being significantly less sympathetic to controlled breeding and marginally more supportative of biocorrect issues and predisposed to animal rights (Table 4). By the end of the course, differences between the sexes had narrowed because males became more biocentric in relation to controlled breeding and animal rights. Nevertheless, women were still more biocorrect than men were after the course. Table 3. Instructor's scores and mean scores of male and female students before and after the course for each scale.

In general, the course made both sorts of student more biocentric, except in regard to pest rights. By the end of the course differences between the groups had increased markedly, with undergraduates being more biocorrect, more strongly opposed to ex- ploitation, and greater proponents of pest rights. Grad- uate students moved in the opposite direction on the last scale. Students' attitudes differed little according to their scientific background before the course, with the ex- ception of those with science-related backgrounds who were antipathetic to controlled breeding and were pro- ponents of animal rights (Table 6). The difference in attitude to the former disappeared as a result of the course, with nonscientists becoming less biocentric and other students becoming more so. Initial differences in attitudes to animal rights were little affected by the course. Discussion Our findings suggest that an education in conservation biology helps crystallize students' attitudes toward the natural world. Principally, we found that five new atti- tude scales appeared as result of taking the course. These attitudes centered on exploitation of habitats and species (exploitation), being responsible towards na- ture (natural stewardship), concern about the well- being of noxious or nuisance species (pest rights), consideration of breeding animals for human use (con- trolled breeding), and general use of animals by humans (animal rights). Nevertheless, we cannot unequivocally attribute these changes to the course itself because we had no control group of students. Thus other factors, such as onset of spring weather that encouraged visits to wilderness areas or media coverage of endangered spe- cies controversies, might conceivably have played a role. That students moved toward the attitude of their instructor makes these possibilities remote, but they cannot be discounted. It is difficult to determine whether attitudes were la- tent in the students before the course or formed de novo during the class (Kinder 1983). From the magni- tude of change in the maximum alpha scores (Table 3), one could argue that students already had attitudes to- wards natural stewardship and animal rights but that these were unfocused at the beginning of the class. In contrast, the greater change in alpha scores suggests that concern over pest rights, controlled breeding, and exploitation may have formed afresh as a result of learn- ing about conservation biology. Women were more sympathetic to nature than men when they entered the course (as found in other stu- dents; Steger &amp; Witt 1989). The course served to dimin- ish these initial differences primarily by making men more biocentric. Undergraduates were more affected by the course than were graduates, although graduate atti- tudes changed too. Undergraduates maintained their biocentric edge over graduates during the course; they Table 5.

Because grad- uates already had some knowledge of conservation biology, the differential response may result from undergraduates being exposed to a greater amount of new material. Conservation education may therefore be more effective in changing attitudes when people are exposed to it earlier. Although our findings are preliminary given the small sample size, we found that in a short period of time education in conservation biology made students more biocentric. This was particularly true in relation to their ideas about the rights of pests, ascendance over nature and its exploitation, and in the realm of environmental stewardship. The extent to which these changes in atti- tude lasted beyond the end of the academic year are unknown, however. Although one would hope that stu- dents would be more predisposed to "green" careers and to use resources wisely, the speed at which their attitudes changed suggests this may be too optimistic an assumption.

Would you agree with, say, your parents buying these antiques? (11) Frogs are ideal models for teaching students about cardiac, pul- monary, and neuromuscular physiology. Although teaching pro- cedures are humane, continued collection is reducing wild pop- ulations. Do you support continued use of frogs in the sphere of education? (12) "The dog is a man's best friend." It has been argued that the love a human has for a dog is better than humans have for each other because it is more selfless. Do you agree?

However, some argue that these "tame" wilderness areas. Do you approve of trail signs?

Do you approve of such breeding? (16) Many people put one bird seed in their gardens to help nonmi- gratory species survive northern winters. Do you support this practice? (17) Mice are nuisance pests in people's homes. Do you think it is reasonable to set deadbait traps for these animals if livetrapping results in new recruits entering your house? (18) The plight of many rare species is exacerbated by last-minute collections by museums and zoos on the premise that it is im- portant to gain knowledge about these species in case they go extinct. Does this seem an acceptable practice? (19) In Europe, many frogs and toads get run over in spring when they move to their mating sites in ponds. Tunnels have now been made under highways to allow safe passage of amphibians to breeding sites. It is argued that construction should be ex- tended to other species in new areas, but this entails substan- tially greater costs to taxpayers. Do you agree with new tunnels? (20) National forests in the U.S. are usually multiple-use areas that allow hunting and some timber companies to log selectively. These groups argue that their utilization of the area ensures its long-term survival because it will "pay its way." Do you sub- scribe to this doctrine? (21) Styrofoam coffee cups and food containers produce chlorofluo- rocarbons when they degrade, which contributes to ozone de- pletion at the earth's poles. This allows more ultraviolet radia- tion to reach the earth's surface, potentially causing cancer and deformities in newborns. Aside from stopping your own per- sonal use of these products, do you support hassling your friends about using styrofoam every single time you see them use it? (22) Zoological institutions see their role as encompassing education of children, conservation of certain species, and research and entertainment activities, but keeping animals captive dramati- cally limits the freedom of wild-caught animals, which still con- stitute a significant portion of zoo animals. Do you support the idea of zoos? (23) Pet foods are made from animal organs not deemed fit for human consumption. In the past these have included parts of whales and kangaroos, as well as domestic animals, providing some ad- ditional incentive for hunting them. Do you approve of them being used as a source of food for pets? (24) "It is dangerous to turn an animal into a machina automata, a cow into the automation for the production of milk. By so doing man cuts the thread binding him to Paradise and has nothing left to hold or comfort him on his flight through the emptiness of time" (Kundera 1984). Do you agree? (25) In Texas, there is an annual round up of rattlesnakes primarily to reduce incidents of snake bits in the state. Do you favor this practice? (26) In California, there is a ban on hunting mountain lions. However, walkers, usually children, are occasionally attacked and if this occurs the individual lion is pursued and shot to prevent repeat occurrences. Do you agree with this practice? (27) Among certain indigenous cultures in East Africa, men who kill large, dangerous animals such as elephants or lions are given special status and gifts by other tribal members, enabling them to acquire wives as is the custom of their society. Do you con- done the practice of killing animals in this context? (28) Extensive tourism in national parks can lead to new roads and facilities being built, erosion of hiking trails, and disturbance of animals. Should it be common park policy always to limit tourist numbers in sensitive areas, even though this will decrease park revenue and hence economic incentives for maintaining parks? (29) Raptors are often hit by vehicles but not killed. In some places, animal hospitals care for wounded birds, whether they are com- mon or rare, but during convalescence many laboratory rats and mice are used to feed birds before they can be released. Do you support raptor centers? (30) In southern states, horses are bred and trained to run in a high, prancing manner not seen in domestic or wild horses. The train- ing apparently involves no discomfort but is regarded as an el- egant way of running. Do you approve of this practice? (31) Ultraviolet lamps are used to attract and destroy insects and moths which cause annoyance at night. Do you approve of their use? (32) Game birds are bred in Britain on farms and then released to moorland habitats in the fall so that sportsmen can shoot them. Sportsmens' presence injects much-needed money into the Scot- tish economy. Do you approve of breed-and-release programs? (33) Animal welfare groups illegally enter scientific laboratories to destroy equipment and release experimental animals. Do you support this practice? (34) Cheap beef in many hamburgers comes from cattle in central America, and raising cattle for this purpose is a direct cause of deforestation in the region. How do you view continued con- sumption of hamburgers given the present source of meat? (35) One of the most popular acts in circuses is the lion tamer who coaxes lions or tigers to jump through hoops or perform tricks. Do you enjoy this spectacle? (36) Some argue that management personel in national parks should take steps to reduce the number of wild animals killed by pred- ators by feeding predators with domestic animal carcasses killed in a humane manner. Do you agree? (37) To make ski trails, swathes of forest are clear-felled, disturbing unspoilt wilderness areas. Given the number of ski resorts al- ready in the Sierras, would you support a ban on developing new resorts? (38) Laboratory animals are bred for the purpose of medical and scientific research which has very important ramifications for our society. Do you support breeding animals (primates, dogs, rats) for this purpose? (39) Mink and sable are farmed in North American and the Soviet Union to supply the pelts for women's fur coats. Animals are well cared for because coat quality is sensitive to stress, and they are killed humanely. Do you agree with mink farming? (40) If you find a black widow spider in your home would you agree that killing it immediately is a reasonable response?
