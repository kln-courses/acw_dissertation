<plain_text><page sequence="1">PAUL CHENAVARD' JOSEPH C. SLOANE ON AN April evening in 1 848, M. Ledru-Rollin, Minister of the Interior in the new French revolutionary government, had two visitors.2 In the midst of his pressing duties he had found time to grant an interview to his friend Charles Blanc, the Director of Beaux-Arts, and the painter, Paul Chenavard. It was their hope that the minister would commission Chenavard to decorate the Pantheon with a cycle of historical subjects, the sketches for which the artist had under his arm. Ledru-Rollin looked at them one by one, listening to the exposition of each with careful attention. It was a long recital, for the dawn had come up over the city before it was done, but a deep impression had been made. Two days later, apparently on his own authority, the minister signed a decree awarding the gigantic task to "Citizen Chenavard," the mysterious and really almost unknown artist from Lyon.3 Thus was begun one of the most bizarre and ill-fated enterprises in the history of western art. Had this panorama of human destiny been installed, it could not thereafter have failed to attract the attention of the learned, while simply mystifying the casual spectator. Instead, its forgotten fragments lie rolled up in the basement of the Musee des Beaux-Arts in Lyon, while the name of its author can scarcely be found in any of the innumerable histories of nineteenth century French art. Yet only an accident of history prevented its being placed in its intended location, the accident of the return of the building to the Church at the time of the coup d'Xtat in 1851. Its substance was far too unorthodox, not to say heretical, for acceptance by the clergy. When, in 1885, St. Genevieve once more became the Pantheon, Chenavard was too old and angry to take up the task again. But the reasons for the oblivion into which his work has fallen lie deeper than this. The sub- sequent movement of French art was in a direction away from his esoteric historical romanticism toward a concept of art for art's sake which effectively ruled out any continuing interest in painting of this kind. Nevertheless, the series is still worthy of attention for a number of reasons, among which are the facts that it represents the only full-scale pictorial expression by a Frenchman of a type of mystical thinking much in vogue in Europe in the early nineteenth century, and that when completed, it would have formed the largest single architectural decorative scheme ever achieved by one man. The following account is an attempt to reintroduce the paradoxical figure of the Lyonnais painter and give a summary idea of the scheme of human affairs which he earnestly hoped would be an enduring monument to the greatness of his own country and the nobility of mankind generally. This visual exposition of universal history is too formidable an effort to be allowed to remain permanently effaced from the record of the art of the last century. i. An article submitted for the issue in honor of Charles Rufus Morey as listed in THE ART BULLETIN, December x 950. 2. The following article represents a preliminary survey of the life and work of this unusual painter. Many conclusions in it must remain tentative pending a careful study of material available only in France. A brief mention of Chenavard's significance is included in the author's recent book, French Painting Between the Past and the Present, Princeton University Press, 1951; but in view of the almost complete obscurity into which both the artist and his work have fallen, it seemed wise to present a somewhat fuller account here. Further information or suggestions as to interpretation will be most welcome. 3. The text of this decree reads as follows: "I1 sera execute dans l'interieur du Pantheon une suite de peintures murales par le citoyen Paul Chenavard, et sous sa direction, conformiment aux projets et aux esquisses qui ont et6 mises sous les yeux du ministre. Sur la demande du citoyen Chenavard, il lui est allou6, pendant toute la duree des travaux, une somme de 4,000 francs par an.

Quoted from Ph. de Chennevibres, Les dicorations du Panthion (extrait de L'artiste), Paris, 1885, p. 63.</page><page sequence="2">PAUL CHENAVARD 241 Paul Marc Joseph Chenavard was born in Lyon on December 9, 1808, of a bourgeois family in comfortable circumstances.4 This financial security probably had an important effect on the course of his life, for since he never had to earn a living by his art, he remained free to follow the dictates of his varied interests, thinking a great deal but painting rather little. Along with a certain wealth, he inherited from his father a strong liberal inclination coupled with a distaste for the Bourbons. He grew into an intelligent, studious, moody young man whose inquiring mind led him to con- sider various possible careers such as those of writer, mathematician, traveler, and even ascetic, abandoning the latter after some personal experimentation. The final decision was in favor of art, a choice which brought him to Paris in 1825 to begin his studies. He entered the 1cole des Beaux- Arts and tried the studios of Hersent, Ingres, and Delacroix, but much of his time was spent in museums and libraries. Eventually, on the advice of Ingres, he betook himself to Italy in 1827 for an intensive examination of the masters in Milan, Florence, Rome, and Venice. His notebooks were soon filled with copies of nearly every important fresco in the country, sketches which remained so fixed in his prodigious pictorial memory that his work was filled with them ever after. He may have met Hegel in Rome, a spur to his historical interests which were growing steadily. In addition, he took a considerable interest in the work of the German school, even copying Overbeck's murals at the Villa Massimi. After about two years he returned to Paris, soon attempting his first "peinture d'histoire," a large canvas depicting Luther Before the Diet of Worms, which Silvestre reports was good in parts but lacking in compositional unity.5 At this time he appears to have associated with the famous group of the C6nacle, a rather surprising distinction for so young and unknown a man, but there is reason to believe that he already possessed the brilliant conversational powers which were later to become almost legendary." Certainly the influence of romanticism is very clear in the sketch for a picture of the National Convention which he painted for a competition held in 1831 for the decoration of the Salle des Seances de la Chambre in the Palais Bourbon. Gros and Delacroix both gave warm praise to its companion piece, Marat Apostrophizing the Marquis of Dreux-Breze, although it was not acceptable to Louis Philippe for political reasons.7 The rough brushwork and shadowy handling of the Convention sketch reveal a genuine talent clearly influenced by the bold technique of Delacroix. Unfortunately, Chenavard presently abandoned this manner in favor of a colder one modeled on the Germans, a change which was in keeping with his growing philosophical preoccupa- tions, but had an unfortunate effect on the artistic merit of his later work. His romanticism took the form of historical speculation rather than pictorial individualism. This interest in the story of society was rapidly becoming a dominant force in his life, leading him to declare that contemporary art was in a fatal decline because it had ceased to concern itself with great concepts and had descended to the exploitation of the inferior mode of landscape. To develop his ideas still further, he returned to Rome and the influence of Overbeck and Cornelius whose intellectualism seemed to offer the perfect vehicle for his plan to compose a vast scheme of universal history. He searched everywhere for pertinent material, storing up a profusion of ideas which, as will be seen later, were eventually fused into a somewhat bewildering whole. Mythology, 4. In addition to the short notices in the standard reference works such as Thieme-Becker (which, incidentally, incorrectly gives the date of birth as 1807 instead of I8o8), the material for the facts of Chenavard's life have been drawn mainly from the following: Theophile Silvestre, Histoire des artistes vivants franCais et etrangers, Paris, 1856; Charles Blanc, Ville de Lyon. Exposition des cartons de Paul Chenavard pour la decoration du Pantheon, Paris, I876; Joseph Buche, L'icole mystique de Lyon. 1776-1847, Paris, 1935; Eugene Vial, "Chenavard et Soulary," Me'moires de l'Acade'mie des Sciences, Belles-lettres, et Arts de Lyon, 3me. s'r., xvII, I921, pp. 95-iz5; Paul Marilton, Jostphin Soulary et la pleiade lyonnaise, Paris, 8 84. Apparently Marilton had a large collection of notes which he intended to use for a biography of his friend, but the book was never written and he left directions for the destruction of the notes at the time of his death. 5. The present location of this picture is not known. 6. cf. Silvestre, op.cit., p. 1 3. Marieton, op.cit., pp. 138- 139, mentions his friendship with the literary great of the day. 7. The exact history of these pictures is not clear. Louis Philippe objected to the representation of Philippe-tgalit6 con- versing with Marat in the scene with Dreux-Brez6. The canvas later came into the possession of M. Thiers, then of M. Ledru- Rollin, and finally of Napoleon III. See Silvestre, op.cit., p. Ix4, and Vial, op.cit., p. 103. The painting of the Convention is in Lyon.</page><page sequence="3">242 THE ART BULLETIN science, religion, and history were all called upon for evidence of a circular movement of events beginning with Adam and ending in destruction followed by rebirth, infused, apparently, with an underlying theory of metempsychosis. In 1841, some time after returning from Rome, he exhibited a Martyrdom of St. Polycarpus,8 followed five years later by a painting of Hell which was seen and admired by Th6ophile Thor6 and Baudelaire.' Possibly this design was the same one later used for one of the projected mosaics in the Pantheon series. He was now in the prime of life, and, judging by the somewhat fragmentary descriptions of his character which are available, was a most unusual man. He had exhibited so little that he was hardly known to the public and the majority of Parisian artists, but Delacroix, Baudelaire, Charles Blanc, Gautier, Theophile Silvestre, and later Courbet counted him as a friend, taking keen pleasure in his conversation.10 He possessed an immense fund of information backed by a memory so perfect that he quoted continually from a wide variety of sources. Imaginative, pessimistic, quixotic, he was the source of an endless sequence of unusual ideas which delighted and entertained his intimates. Baudelaire reports that there was no one with whom Delacroix loved so much to talk, in spite of the fact that the two were seldom, if ever, in agreement." The very brilliance of his mind was the cause of a major weakness: he could never settle down to one pursuit or line of action for very long. Silvestre says he continually erected systems merely for the pleasure of destroying them at once, a habit which led to his being nicknamed "The Great Desolator."12 His melancholic, cynical attitude is revealed in his later remarks to the Lyonnais poet Soulary on the subject of the preservation of his paintings in his native city.3 He had planned to leave his money and pictures to the local museum, and Soulary advised him to put in the deed of gift a provision for the perpetual maintenance of the cartoons in the room which was to be set aside for them. The artist replied gloomily, "I am perfectly aware of what will be the result of [my] carelessness [i.e. in omitting such a provision], but what would you? I consider myself a negligible quantity and quite naturally forgettable. When I read that I hold a good position among con- temporary artists, I am only astonished at the sagacity of the critic. It's because, at heart, I incline to think that everything men do amounts to very little along with that which is called glory." He is reported to have frequently remarked, "Why bother? Nothing is worth any trouble ... everything must be done so as to do nothing and be nothing."' The plan for his historical cycle was the great exception to his lack of purpose, but at the same time it was a justification of his pessimism, for in the end it indeed "amounted to very little" in the world's opinion. He was, in short, something of a nihilist, though he apparently stopped short of its most drastic conclusions by hinting at the coming of a better age when the present one had passed away. His ideas on painting were not such as to endear him to our own times, for he despised "colorists" and felt that the mere creation of pictorial beauty was a very slender excuse for the creation of art. The murals and mosaics for the Pantheon were, except for the Social Palingenesis, to have been executed in grisaille, a decision which naturally resulted in widespread criticism to the effect that he might be a thinker but was obviously no painter. He later confessed that this objection was probably well taken, but he still felt that monochrome was most suitable for his purpose: "I planned not to paint the compositions but only draw them, and, to amuse the eye, to color the architecture in the fashion of the ancients in such a manner that I came back to their system of framing monochrome pictures by means of colored and gilded columns, capitals, etc. [This] system had the advantage of absolutely separating the character of the decoration of philosophic pantheons from that of 8.

Even Charles Blanc, a devoted friend and admirer, pointed out that philosophy had led him into abstractions too far removed from life to be effective, so that some of the cartoons were only pictorial without being spiritual.'" The artist admitted the strength of his speculative tendencies: "The inconvenience of my type of mind," he said, "is that it makes all my ideas encyclopedic to such an extent that they become impossible to execute without a great deal of time and many assistants or pupils ...."T When he was old he decided that his work had been "too exclusively devoted to the pursuit of ideas, and too little to their professional execution."'s Considered purely as a painter's painter he would, therefore, deserve little consideration even though he could sometimes design effectively (Death of Socrates, Virgil Reading His Eclogues) and had a certain mastery over the human figure in every conceivable pose (The Deluge [Fig. I], Hell). Many critics pointed out at the time that a number of his forms had appeared previously in the work of Michelangelo, Correggio, and others, an objection which can be readily substantiated by comparing the figure of Venus in the lower right-hand corner of The Divine Tragedy (Fig. 2) with Correggio's Antiope or the Eve in the scene of the Fall on the Sistine ceiling. The central group of the Trinity is likewise reminiscent, being based generally on Diirer's famous painting in Vienna. It would, however, be a mistake to put these reused figures down to simple plagiarism, for Chenavard was above any practice so petty. As mentioned previously, he had what amounted to a photographic memory charged with a multitude of details from the works of the painters he admired, and he made heavy demands on it."9 A more correct interpretation of Chenavard's practice would be to say that these poses constituted a repertory acquired by diligent study, not so much of the model as of other paintings, for use as a pictorial language, just as educated men used to employ apt quotations from Horace, Ovid, or Plato. The great defect was not plagiarism, nor even a lack of color sense, but an overwhelming aesthetic dullness. The odor of the lamp hangs about his work; the wiry line which bounds each contour has so little life that the figures seem more like lay forms than living beings. Their interest derives from symbolic significance, and since this significance is often obscure, the uninstructed observer is left with very little to attract his eye. In 1848, as described above, he received the great opportunity for which he had so long been preparing, and plunged into the work with a zeal quite different from his usual cynical inactivity. He gathered several assistants, all former students of the Academy in Rome, on whom he thrust a sort of anonymity, controlling and correcting their work after his sketches until the separate hands virtually disappeared.20 He apparently felt that he was a sort of priest in the new religion of his philosophic art, dedicated along with his helpers to the service of the state.21 Thirty thousand francs had been placed at his disposal, but not all of even this modest sum was ever spent, for he asked only ten francs a day for his labor. The news of this selfless devotion to his "philosophic pantheon" created something of a sensation among the other artists who maintained that he was cheapening the profession by working for so little. They complained for other reasons as well, since Chenavard was an unknown, an outsider, and they could see no reason why he should have been chosen over them for this most important of all commissions under the new government. A petition 15. ibid., pp. 107-Io8. The reference to "philosophic pantheons" is interesting, for Chenavard had conceived of a whole series of provincial pantheons to accommodate the re- mains of the great of each locality. After a hundred years the greatest ones could be voted into the chief pantheon in Paris. To each local center of this cult of the dead was to be attached a university so the young might not only be educated but spurred on by the examples of their illustrious predecessors whose graves were thus near by. 16.

Chenavard's religious beliefs were of a pantheistic rather than an orthodox sort. Vial quotes him as saying "Le panth6isme malgr6 ses prodigieuses difficultbs est la thborie la plus inevitable de l'esprit humain" (Vial, op.cit., p. x 7).</page><page sequence="5">244 THE ART BULLETIN bearing hundreds of names was circulated asking for his removal, but the government stood fast and the work went on. It was, however, destined for failure. A movement, headed by Montalembert, was inaugurated to have the building returned to the Church, and after the artist had been at work for some four years, this was successful. On hearing the news, Chenavard, fearful for the effect it would have on his project, called on the Archbishop of Paris, who treated him with the utmost suavity, even coming to see the cartoons in the painter's studio.22 The ideas involved, however, were far too anticlerical to be acceptable, and the whole enterprise was shortly discontinued. The size of this disappointment would be difficult to exaggerate, and Vial says that it made a confirmed anti-Catholic out of Chenavard, who was already none too religious.23 A number of the cartoons were shown in the Salon of '53, the first opportunity the public had had to see them, although they had heard something of the sensation they had been creating in various quarters. The reaction was, in the main, very favorable, although some critics, noting their obvious obscurity, referred to them as "rebuses." The painter was made a Chevalier of the Legion of Honor, and two years later at the Exposition Universelle, when a still larger number of his pictures was shown, he received a first class medal, but all this praise did not repair the ruin of his life's hope. Vial reports that he was still working on some of the designs as late as 1885, unable to let them alone even though he knew they would never grace any public wall outside of a museum.24 His next, and last, Salon picture appeared in 1869 under the title, The Divine Tragedy (Fig. 2). It was, in a way, the key to his philosophic position, an epilogue to the Pantheon cycle, expressing in veiled terms his antireligious sentiments and his faith in human reason. Originally placed in the famous Salon Carrie where it attracted much attention, it was later moved-probably at the instiga- tion of the clerical authorities-to an obscure gallery in the rear where only the persevering could find it. With this last disappointment, the public career of Chenavard virtually came to an end.- There is mention of a Judith and a Love and Death from the later years,25 but their present whereabouts is unknown. He retired to the life of a gentleman of leisure in Lyon, traveling from time to time, but painting very little. His cartoons, first destined for the museum at Amiens, were finally assigned to Lyon where, in 1876, they were shown together for the last time, accompanied by a brochure written by the devoted Charles Blanc.26 When the Marquis de Chennevieres-Pointel, the Director of Beaux-Arts in the 'seventies, planned a new mural scheme for the church, he offered the decoration of the apse to Chenavard, but the invitation was declined-having had the whole as his province, a little piece was not enough.27 And so both painter and pictures were lost sight of, presently to be forgotten by all except his friends in Lyon. Victor Laprade, Soulary, Marieton, and a few others formed a circle with whom he met on Saturdays for his beloved con- versation, being known to them as "le vieux chne."28 To the city he left his money, his prints, and his own works, the latter to be shown in a room set apart for the purpose, called the Pantheon Room. Soulary's advice in regard to this bequest, which has already been referred to, was prophetic, for six years after the painter's death in 1895 the cartoons were taken down, rolled up, and put in the basement. It was indeed a modest finale for so ambitious a drama. Space does not admit of any detailed account of the Pantheon or the decorative schemes which were successively adopted and discarded according to the shifting purposes for which the building was to be used.29 The plan and elevation must, however, be briefly described in order that the 22zz.

Essen- tially, the plan is that of a Greek cross with the addition of a sort of narthex at the entrance and an extra oblong bay in front of the apse. It measures one hundred and ten meters by eighty-four and a half. At the crossing is a central dome resting on pendentives supported by four massive piers, and lesser domes cover each arm of the cross. A continuous Corinthian colonnade runs clear H H. lFrT7?. 1-R Lli Plan of the Pantheon, Paris. around the interior except across the entrance and in front of the apse, while in each of the arms, additional columns are set forward in a second rank to support the domes above. Matching each support of the colonnade, is an attached column in the wall between which are rectangular panels to the number of forty. Adding the three panels in the apse and the two which flank the central entrance, there are forty-five such spaces along the whole length of the wall. Each one is divided a little over half-way up by a horizontal string course forming two rectangles, the lower one of which is eleven feet by eighteen, the upper, eleven feet square. The main sequence of subjects was tury. Probably no other building ever had as many different plans for its decoration. Prior to Chenavard's effort, the most ambitious cycle was the one proposed by Quatremere de Quincy during the revolutionary period.</page><page sequence="7">246 THE ART BULLETIN to have been placed on the lower panels surmounted in the upper section by a continuous frieze-like composition running right around the interior. The area of this part of the decorative scheme alone was in excess of fourteen thousand square feet. On the sides of the main piers which faced the arms of the cross were additional panels which were to be filled as well as the main pendentives. Only the dome itself, previously painted in 1824 by the Baron Gros, was not included in the total project."? Under each dome was to have been a mosaic, the largest and most important being the representation of "Social Palingenesis"3" at the crossing, while statues were intended for the center of the end wall of each transept, and in front of each main pier facing inward. As a final sculptural adornment, a huge monument to all religions was to be placed on the floor in front of the apse. All told, the scheme called for one hundred and eleven painted panels, five mosaics, six statues and the monument to universal religion. The majority of evidence so far available deals with the mosaics and the lower panels along the walls, but the problem of assigning definite locations to the latter is somewhat difficult, for there are quite a number more than there are spaces to accommodate them. Gautier attempts a placement, but comes out with too many pictures, even allowing for the fact that he states correctly that some subjects such as the Trojan War and the Christians in the Catacombs occupy more than one inter- columniation. At least six designs exist for the five mosaics, pointing up the difficulty of making any accurate guess as to what the final arrangement was to have been. The extra subjects were, of course, alternates awaiting a final choice which was probably never made, and since the two best descrip- tions, those made by Gautier and Silvestre,32 were written about seven years apart (1848 and 1855), it can be assumed that the artist was not sure of the relative importance of some events, whereas others which appear in both accounts, were definite choices from the beginning. Thirty-six of the designs were photographed by Braun in the 'seventies, so that these, plus the verbal accounts of the others, give a very fair idea of the general nature of the entire plan. Furthermore, since every scene, whether it was to have been used or not, was a partial illustration of the historical scheme employed, the extant designs probably are more informative than the finished set would have been. No effort will here be made to analyze each scene in detail, but an idea of their character can be obtained from Figures I and 4. The sequence of subjects, however, is essential to an understanding of the artist's thought, and the central mosaic which sums it up will have to be described rather fully. The following list includes all the wall subjects so far known, arranged in approximate order reading around the building from left in a clockwise direction. With each is included a tentative suggestion of its intended significance: I. Adam (doorway). The male principle; one-half of the divided sex. 2. Eve (doorway). The female principle, the other half."3 3. The Deluge. History begins, earth cleansed of the misbegotten offspring of giants, pre-Adamites, etc., as well as sinful men.34 (Fig. 2) 4.

This work was to have represented the chasse of St. Genevieve, being borne heavenward by angels while below watched Clovis, Clothilde, Charlemagne, St. Louis, Napoleon, and Josephine. Following the exile of the emperor, however, a change was made which substituted Louis XVIII for the imperial couple and the saint herself for the chasse. Further minor changes were made after the accession of Louis-Philippe. Gerard was commissioned to do the pendentives, and apparently his work there was to have been removed to make way for Chenavard's designs. For illustration of the present murals see Jean Monval, Le Pantkhon, Paris, 940. 31. Discussed in detail below. Palingenesis here means "re- birth." 32.

It seems probable that both of these ac- counts were the result of personal examination plus conversa- tion with the artist himself. Chenavard, being a great talker, was doubtless able to explain each picture in the most interesting terms. Gautier in particular makes many references to obscure interpretations which may have been clear enough in conversa- tion with the painter but are far less so now. Silvestre makes more of an attempt to describe the system of thought behind the whole project. Blanc's account, while useful, is superficial in the sense that it describes the subjects but gives little attention to their significance. 33.

Pre- Adamism attracted considerable attention in the early nine- teenth century.</page><page sequence="9">248 THE ART BULLETIN The frieze contained a procession of figures quite fully described by Gautier who explained that the artist believed in a sort of evolution of divinities similar to the development of mankind itself."3 Thus in pre-history when the social world was formless and uncertain, the Gods were monstrous hybrids, but as time wore on and civilization advanced, they became more and more human, since man was, after all, formed in the image of God. The gods, demigods, the heroes of Greece were all anthropomorphic, leading eventually to the greatest man-god of all, Jesus Christ. This strange parade was related in a general way to the corresponding scenes below, gods and heroes being replaced, in the sections devoted to the Christian era, by the great men whose work and thought had been notable in human affairs, ending with Saint-Simon and Fourier. The piers were dedicated to the four great divisions of culture exemplifying four stages of society: gold was the age of religion, silver the age of poetry, bronze the age of philosophy, and iron that of science. This arrangement does not seem entirely in agreement with Chenavard's thesis that the age of poetry was the greatest of all, but his ideas were not always entirely consistent. Each age was symbolized by a great man, the statue of whom stood against the inner face of each pier. Moses was the embodiment of religion, Homer of poetry, Aristotle of philosophy, and Galileo of science. On the panels of the outer faces of each pier and in the pendentives above were other illustrative figures and scenes carrying out the idea of each main division. Gautier notes in passing that nearly all these characters were either unhappy in their lives or came to tragic ends--possibly their choice was to some extent influenced by the artist's personal pessimism. The decorative scheme was continued in mosaic on the floor in a series of circular panels dealing with the afterlife and the significance of history. In the nave was placed a representation of Purga- tory, strangely blended of Christian and pagan elements as were the other three smaller scenes. In the left arm was Hell, in the right, Paradise, and in the "choir," the Elysian Fields. By the time of Silvestre's description, the last-named had been replaced by the Crucifixion, possibly a concession to the Church's objections to the paganism of the cycle as a whole. Before describing the central mosaic, it will be well to consider the time scheme reproduced by Silvestre with the simple caption: "P. Chenavard. Calendrier d'une philosophie de l'histoire.""' Al- though no further information is given regarding its origin or meaning, it is clear that it represents the basic framework of the artist's views on history and must be regarded as at least a partial guide to the entire cycle as executed. The two must be studied together. As reproduced in Figure 3, the diagram published by Silvestre has been expanded to include certain material taken from that author's account of Chenavard's ideas, while the circles beyond the heavy line constitute an added concordance with the actual paintings. At the center is a circle symbolizing the span of individual human life from birth to death at the age of eighty-four. This is divided evenly into seven year periods, grouped by threes, each trio making up a quarter of a life. The characteristics of man at each age are indicated, and to these correspond the greater ages of history in a ratio of I:Ioo. Thus the infancy and youth of society is spent in passing through a patriarchal stage during which the earth is peopled by the sons of Noah and various religions develop. Society is in a rather formless state during this epoch. Man's life from the age of twenty-one to forty-two is the period of his greatest powers in Chenavard's view, and so it is with society. In common with many historians of his day, he felt that the great cultures of Greece and Rome sprang ultimately from Egypt with some influence from the cultures of the Near East and Persia. Thus from the legendary Nimrod (the first important ruler according to Genesis) to Christ, society forms itself with great force and vigor. Law, science, art, philosophy, medicine, politics, literature were all initiated and carried to very considerable degrees of excellence. Indeed, poetry, architecture, and sculpture never were as fine again. The climax of this age was the reign of Augustus Caesar in the pagan world, and the life of Christ in 35.

This joint eminence marked the divide which separated growth from decay, and since this is so, it is clear that Chenavard was no believer in the almost universally accepted idea of progress. The third quarter opens with the Roman Empire and the spread of Christianity. The latter, seemingly, is viewed not as a growth of human spiritual power, but rather in terms of the rise of the Church. Chenavard felt that Christianity was the best among religions, but its development in the hands of the clergy was not a growth, but a vitiation of its intellectual and moral force.3 He gives it some credit, however, for it is Leo who opposes barbarism in the person of Attila rather than the secular power of Europe. Clovis and Charlemagne act under the moral power of the Church, but Mohammed and the culture of Islam are also given prominence (the court of Haroun-al- Raschid was assigned two spaces). The scenes of the coronation of Gregory VII and the Crusades conclude the list of Catholic events, and Luther's defiance at Wittenberg is the last religious theme. Human skills and science increase, but man's nobility is on the wane, along with his spiritual power as indicated by the "decadent" arts of painting and music characteristic of the period. This section closes with Napoleon and the great question mark which was America, a force whose effect the painter could not clearly foresee. In the last panel, Bonaparte climbs into the bark of history with Charlemagne and other great leaders of the past; an era is drawing to its close. The last quarter, not illustrated in the Pantheon series except in the central mosaic and in the scene of the feast of nations mentioned only by Gautier as standing over the Adam and Eve at the entrance, is the old age of man and the ruin of society. Capitalism apparently unites the world through science and industry, the races of the world unite with a common language, but these are not hopeful signs, for religion disappears and mankind is destroyed. On this gloomy note, the calendar stops and history with it; the whole circuit having lasted just eighty-four hundred years. The mosaic under the dome, called by the critics "Social Palingenesis" seems to illustrate the whole scheme in condensed form.3s In the reproduction (Fig. 4), it will be seen that only about three-fourths of the circle remain, the lowest portion having been cut off. It was in this part that the final dissolution of society was depicted, but whether or not it still is preserved in Lyon is not as yet known to the writer of this account. Fortunately, Gautier saw it, so with his help the entire subject can be briefly described.39 The figure at the top with arms outstretched is explained by most commentators as that of Christ, a natural hypothesis since about his feet are grouped the four symbols of the Evangelists, but Gautier maintains that this is the personification of "the Word," the divine spark which is in all mankind everywhere at all times. Possibly it is Christ as well, but there is no halo to signify divinity. On either side are the elders of the Apocalypse holding up their crowns, while to the right the four Cardinal Virtues lead forward the divinities of the East and the Mediterranean: Chronos, Isis, Jupiter, etc. In a corresponding position on the other side are the three Theological Virtues bringing in the Norse gods-Odin can be seen kneeling in the fore- ground with the ravens on his shoulder. The figure of Hope, strangely enough, is represented as a skeleton, a fact which Gautier explains by saying that Chenavard believed death to be the desire for another life, and as the soul leaves the body it hopes for immortality. This would be in accordance with the painter's known interest in the transmigration of souls. It is possible, in fact, that he felt that the succeeding characters in history were reincarnations of earlier lives, and that the same held true for societies which disappeared to be reborn again in other forms. If this is true, 37. The pessimism reflected here found a similar somber statement in the poetry of Leconte de Lisle, who was himself concerned with the romantic epic of man's destiny. Such poems as "Dies Irae," "Le Nazareen," and "Le Dernier Dieu" reflect a spirit quite close to Chenavard's. 38. This title probably came from the painter himself. At all events, most critics used it and it was so titled in the Salon of 1855 (Exposition Universelle). According to Joseph Buche (L'Pcole mystique de Lyon, p. 263 n. I) a colored print of the mosaic was published by a certain A. Rey with an explanatory legend by the artist, but a copy has so far not been found. 39. A recent letter from M. Vaillant, Director of the Palais des Beaux-Arts in Lyon, suggests that the lower portion may no longer exist. The author wishes to express his very real grati- tude to M. Vaillant for much helpful material. The description given here is from Gautier's Art moderne.</page><page sequence="11">250 THE ART BULLETIN it is unusual that he failed to find evidences of progress in these rebirths, for in most such speculation each soul travels an ascending path (in spite of temporary reverses) while in Chenavard's scheme the sum total of all such transmigrations was eventual decay and ruin. Again, this may merely be evidence of a certain inconsistency in his thought. Directly below the figure of the Christ-Logos, in the central intercolumniation, is a strange object symbolizing the unity of all religions. The primitive stage of worship is represented by the Brahminic cow, the Persian gryphon, and the Chaldean sphinx, on whose backs rests the Egyptian Bark of the Dead. In this boat is placed the Ark of the Covenant protected by its winged cherubim, while on top of it, surmounting the whole, is the chalice of the Last Supper. This group, executed in marble and granite, was to have stood on the floor before the apse, a sort of altar at which all faiths could worship. One can only speculate as to the reactions of the archbishop of Paris to this portion of the plan. Returning to the mosaic, in the right side of the colonnade are found the characters of the ancient world who were possessed of the divine word or spark: Zoroaster, Confucius, Homer, Plato, Solon, the sibyls and many others. On the other side are the great figures of the Old Testament from Adam and Eve down through Noah and Moses to the prophets. The floor on which they stand, viewed as a chronological symbol, would mark the mid-point in history, the moment of division between the old world and the new revelation, for on the stair at the left the Virgin starts down- ward, with the infant Christ in her arms, accompanied by John the Baptist. Below are various saints and fathers of the Church symbolizing the early spread of Christianity, while across from them the life and decline of the pagan world is represented by Ptolemy, Alexander, Caesar, Attila, etc. At the extreme right, the Mohammedans are shown bursting forth to be met by the resolute form of Charles Martel. The Middle Ages occupy the lower steps where Peter the Hermit can be seen preaching the Crusades, Merlin witnesses the crowning of Charlemagne, and so on. In the fore- ground stand the great men of modern times from the beginning of the Renaissance down to Napoleon and George Washington. Gutenberg, Raphael, Bossuet, Cromwell, Peter the Great, Luther, Mozart, Dante, Spinoza, and Lavoisier are there among others who represent the arts, philosophy, letters, science, and politics of recent centuries. At this point, the bottom of the existing picture, history has arrived at the end of its third quarter on the time calendar, the start of the final stage. In Armbruster's lithograph of the picture,40 which is clearer in the details, Washington (left center) is shown with his left foot on a lower rocky step, the upper part, apparently, of a defile which extended downward to the bottom of the circle. According to Gautier's description, the path leads into the bowels of the earth where an incredibly ugly person-no longer divine in any sense--counts gold and banknotes, resting his elbow on a bale of cotton. Around him lie the scattered broken fragments of the arts. As the trail descends, the figures become increasingly brutish until at the bottom they perish. In the lowest register of all burns a fire from which rises a Phoenix, the promise of a new cycle and the counterpart of the figure of the Word at the top. In this extraordinary fashion Chenavard attempted to sum up the course of history, past, present, and future. As a pictorial framework for his design, he called upon Raphael's Disputa and School of Athens, placing one above the other (albeit somewhat flattened out) with great ingenuity. Even in the poor photograph available, it would seem to be superior in conception to such contemporary "machines" as Couture's Decadence of the Romans. The sources from which the substance of his cycle was drawn have not, at this writing, been entirely uncovered, so that the present account will only point out certain of the more striking similarities which may serve to explain its general nature, leaving the details for later study.

Stylistically, the scenes exhibit numerous borrowings from the work of other artists, most notably Michelangelo's frescoes in the Sistine Chapel which were admittedly an inspiration to Chenavard,42 but the under- lying ideas come rather from literary sources which were, for the most part, contemporary, or nearly so.43 Apparently no one of these furnished the full scheme-one would hardly expect so simple a solution to this particular painter's search for an intellectual basis-but several were drawn on for ideas later united in a loose and not entirely consistent whole which covered human activity from Adam to St. Simon, foretelling, as we have seen, a dire future. In the earlier part of the last century, France was a center for an unusual kind of romantic think- ing which concerned itself with man's fortune interpreted in a number of esoteric ways. Illuminism, Martinism, Orphism, Swedenborgianism, and several types of Neo-Catholicism were all involved in a widespread effort to find a new path to the truth about history, the meaning of religion, and the place of humankind in the cosmos. The jumble of concepts emerging from this rather intuitive search is so confusing that even the specialist in the field of late eighteenth and early nineteenth century ideas has difficulty in bringing it into a semblance of order. Its shifting alignments have been analyzed by Auguste Viatte in Les sources occultes du romantisme,"4 while its literary effects have been ably discussed by Herbert J. Hunt in The Epic in Nineteenth Century France,45 but neither author can give it coherence, for by nature this particular form of the romantic spirit remained varied, unstable and even irrational. But it was precisely here that Chenavard's thought was formed, for he was temperamentally suited to it, obviously fascinated by its mysticism, and learned in its lore. His views on the relation of the individual life to that of society, the concept of rebirth or palingenesis, the importance of all religions, and the startling mixture of historical and mythological events are all characteristic of this unusual approach to history favored by a wide range of writers including philosophers like Ballanche, cultural historians like Buchez, and poets like Vigny, Lamartine, and Hugo.41 Hunt, in his lucid summary of the general nature of this phenomenon, says that it arose in an atmosphere of doubt and instability engendered by the breakdown of orthodox religious belief occurring before complete confidence in the rationalism of natural science had been established.47 Such an age, in his opinion, is "open to wild forms of cosmic speculation"-a very apt description of Chenavard's scheme. Theosophy, which in this context can be associated with illuminism, con- tributed materially to these semireligious notions, particularly by means of the idea of successive revelations through the medium of great figures like Orpheus, Zoroaster, Moses, and Christ-just as suggested in the historical calendar already discussed. To this notion of multiple revelation was 41. The work of Peter von Cornelius is perhaps the closest. Like Chenavard he was impressed by Michelangelo, approached art through the intellect, and dealt with "great" historic themes in his work at Munich and Berlin. The exact nature of the connection between the Frenchman and the German school must await a more detailed study, but he was clearly influenced by them at several points. 42. cf. the artist's own account of The Divine Tragedy as quoted in Vial, op.cit., pp. io6-io8. 43. Writers on the artist have suggested various persons to whose ideas he was presumably indebted: Bossuet, Herder, Hegel, Saint-Simon, and others, but in spite of some general similarities they do not afford much evidence of close connec- tion, and better sources are to be found elsewhere. It is interest- ing that the published historical chronologies of the time, such as Chas. C. Hamilton's An Epitome of Universal Chronology, History, and Biography (London, 1826) or Chas. L. Deyss' Chronologie universelle (Paris, 1858), show a similar use of exact dates for such events as the building of the Tower of Babel or the life of Homer as well as the free mingling of fact and fable. The author wishes to thank Professor Jean Seznec for suggesting that the origins of these concepts might be found among the literary figures of the day rather than among the professional historians. 44. 2 vols., Paris, 1928. 45.

Ballanche even went so far as to start his account in the mind of God and end it in the same place.48 Such concepts were useful in the interpretation of the meaning of religions other than the Christian, such as those native to India, Persia, and Egypt, which were felt to have a bearing upon man's continuous spiritual development, while, as a further aid in the study of all cults, use could be made of such contemporary scientific studies of mythology as the great work by Jacob Grimm." Since new theories about evolution and the antiquity of various forms of life were challenging the literal interpretation of Genesis, most of these romantic cosmological systems made some attempt to reconcile the two views by means of essentially mystical explanations. In short, history was widened to include nearly any and all forms of evidence, real or imaginary, which could be em- ployed to support a projected interpretation. Evolutionary zoology, Hindu mysticism, demon- ology, orphic symbolism, sociology, and Catholicism, all being useful, were applied with a lack of discrimination which is almost staggering. The long path which stretched from the Divinity in which all things had their beginning to the nineteenth century condition of man, and onward into the future, could thus be explained and commented on with the greatest possible freedom without much regard either for orthodoxy or the strictures of historical and scientific accuracy. As a con- sequence, many of the resultant structures were indeed strange. Their strangeness, however, did not deprive them of a certain grandeur, a majestic beauty which can still be felt today, providing one does not bring to the reading a demand for demonstrable truth. The spiritual content of Ballanche or Quinet remains impressive, and sometimes very moving. It was the former, a Neo-Catholic philosopher from Lyon, who emerged in the second and third decades of the century as probably the most considerable figure in the whole movement. Recent studies have shown the extent of his influence on romanticism in France and the genuine importance of his thought.50 In all his published works he was concerned with the interpretation of society which could, he felt, be improved by a reconsideration of its own decisive forces. The source of most of the trouble was inequality, a condition arising from the androgeny of Adam, a sort of Platonic concept of the primal division of the sexes suggested in Genesis (5:2): "Male and female created he them, and blessed them, and called their name Adam in the day they were created." From the Fall in the Garden of Eden onward, the story of human affairs was that of a series of rebirths each of which was marked by "tests" (6preuves) followed by periods of expiation during which men gradually worked off the failure of the first great moral "test" under the Tree of Knowledge. His views on the working out of this system through the centuries are summed up in a small volume entitled La vision d'Hebal, chef d'un clan ecossais which was published in 1831. Here, as in his other books, the precondition for a true grasp of history is the awareness of an exact parallel between the life of the individual and that of the whole of mankind.5' Both are born, mature, grow old, and die throughout a series of metempsychoses leading eventually to a final perfection preceding the end of the world. In this vision, the full cycle of time is revealed to Hebal (obviously Ballanche) through scenes chosen to illustrate the underlying thesis of palingenesis.52 The scale of the division by centuries is not identical with Chenavard's, nor are the same events chosen, but in both cases the course of history is conceived as a full circle rather than the more common upward spiral which implied progress.53 Ballanche, being fundamentally a Catholic, even 48.

One of the attributes of this perfect creature of the future was his again becoming one when the sexes-at least as sources of social inequality-had ceased to exist. The result of this unification was universal harmony.54 As will be seen later, the painter made interesting use of this concept in his painting of The Divine Tragedy. Thus the artist, while not following the lead of his friend and fellow-Lyonnais at all points, adopted his theory of social rebirth, even going so far as to refer to his great central mosaic as La palingendsie sociale, a title borrowed from the most extensive of Ballanche's published works.55 More important still was the use of the idea of history as equaling a single human life. Since, how- ever, Chenavard believed that nearly three-fourths of it had already passed, the future could only be a period of increasing decline, though beyond it rose the dim form of a new cycle symbolized by the Phoenix at the bottom of the mosaic. If he was optimistic about the remote future, his pessimism found ample support in the more immediate prospect. As suggested above, Ballanche's literary influence was considerable, coloring the ideas of a number of other writers, among whom was Philippe Buchez.56 Although usually regarded as a follower of Saint-Simon, he was markedly affected by the ideas of the Lyonnais philosopher. His most revealing historical work was the Introduction a la science de l'histoire, an interesting title for a volume containing many evidences of the romantic attitude with which we are here concerned. In its own right the book is not important, but its choice of historical episodes parallels that of Chenavard more closely than the one in La vision d'Hebal. Noteworthy is the selection of the following for illustration, all of whom figure in the Pantheon project: the anchorites, Clovis, Charlemagne, the rise of Islam, Gregory VII, the Crusades, Luther, the discovery of printing, and the finding of America. Buchez also imagines a future unification of the nations, though he views it optimistically rather than as a sign of decadence. Most interesting of all, perhaps, is his lengthy discussion of the descent of men from gods, demigods, and heroes, an idea which serves as the ideological basis for the whole first section of the frieze. There may also be significance in the fact that he terms his review of history an "androgeny," thus implying that it is the clue to the whole story. It will be recalled that the figures of Adam and Eve begin the mural series, and Gautier describes them as "the two separated portions of the primordial androgeny."57 The circle of those affected by the romantic view of history also included the historian and man of letters, Edgar Quinet.58 Of his many writings, at least two seem to have a particular bearing on personnages universels. L'6tude de la science physiognomonique sert merveilleusement " cela, comme elle sert a nos juges et "a nos magistrats. C'est une grande faculti instinctive qui a cre6 le Jupiter-Olympien, Hombre, tous les types antiques. Voyez le Moise et le Christ de Michelange! Voyez les figures tradition- nelles du Sauveur des hommes! Il faut faire attention a une chose; c'est le peuple qui fait une physionomie, qui lui imprime son vrai caractere individuel, ce qui la rend type historique ou mythique. Jusqu'a un certain point une physionomie n'est pas par elle-meme; elle est par ceux qui la regardent, qui en sont impressiones, dirig6s, inspires ou fascin6s. "Cette habitude du symbole 6leve nos artistes, developpe en eux la faculti n6cessaire pour saisir les figures historiques, les individualitis po6tiques. Notre statue humaine, c'est a l'homme seul, c'est a tout l'homme a retrouver en soi le caractere de la ressemblance divine, et il faut en toutes choses de P'inspiration pour trouver ce qui est. En un mot, ce sont toutes les sympathies reunies qui crient une ressemblance id6ale, et l'artiste est tenu de se rendre l'expression de toutes ces sympathies. ...." 54. The importance of the division of the sexes is stressed in several of Ballanche's books. Amand Rastoul, in his introduc- tion to the edition of La ville des expiations already cited, points out (pp. lxxvff.) that in the philosopher's mind they stood for the two castes in society, the male being the plebeian group, the female, the patrician. The evil of this inequality will disappear when the active and passive principles are finally reunited. 55. Essais de palingenesie sociale, Paris, 1827-29. The con- nection between the two men has been pointed out by several writers including Buche and Vial. George, in his life of the philosopher, overstates the case somewhat when he says simply: "Paul Chenavard the painter conceived and composed from the Palingenesie an immense synthesis of the history of human- ity .. . ." (George, op.cit., p. 127). 56. Philippe Joseph Benjamin Buchez, i796-i866. A physi- cian and ardent republican, he wrote on philosophy, history, and politics. In 1848 he was President of the National Con- stituent Assembly. First a follower of Saint-Simon, he later became a Catholic Socialist. His views on history include the ideas of multiple revelation, palingenesis, a belief in progress, and an interest in pre-Adamism.

The first is a brief essay, written in 1828, called De l'origine des dieux, and the second, Le gmnie des religions, which appeared in 1841, is a further amplification of the same general theories.59 Quinet's dependence upon Ballanche at several points has been pointed out by Hunt, a fact which suggests the possibility that he, too, may have influenced Chenavard. This hypothesis seems to be justified, for close resemblances between the thought of the two men can be found, resemblances of a somewhat unusual nature. The G"nie des religions is written with the avowed purpose of "deducing political and civil society from religion,""6 to which end the author marshals evidence not only from Christianity, but the oriental and Graeco-Roman cults as well, followed in modern times by Germanic my- thology, Catholicism, Protestantism, and Mohammedanism-a significant division corresponding exactly to the choice made by the painter. The last act in the great drama of religion is thus described: "But the men of the north take a dislike to it [Catholicism]; the Germanic spirit revolts first; the Reformation bursts forth, man once more takes up the search for truth which he believed he possessed. Having thought himself safely arrived in port, there he is once more plunged into the storm. Doubt takes possession of the world, eternal God vacillates in human hearts; but this sceptical shudder does not remain fruitless: everything is in motion; philosophy and political revolutions together open up the future, and we, who appear momentarily in the middle of this spectacle, await the lightning which must dazzle us all and bring back the peace which the world has lost.""' Here, surely, is evidence of a spirit akin to that of the author of the Pantheon designs. Two specific examples will have to suffice in this brief account to illustrate the connection more concretely. The first concerns art itself.62 Quinet sets the artist above all others since God himself was the first of them. Only the artist is connected with what is ageless because his work is connected with divinity and based upon the eternal, dying only with civilization itself. Art, therefore, arises from the religious condition of each historical period with the result that each brings forth a form suitable to its nature. At this point, Quinet proceeds to explain a parallel between stages of culture and their art forms which appears in identical form in Chenavard's time scheme. The early period of Asiatic "visible pantheism," dominated by nature cults, could only express itself in architecture, the greatest of the arts and the support for all the others. It is the product of a society of castes, the work of continuous generations rather than individuals. But later in Greece, humanity for the first time worships itself, requiring for its expression the use of sculpture which remains the dominant mode down through Roman times. With the advent of Christianity another revolution occurs in religion; man becomes a particular individual of a particular moment, the prey of innumerable effects of chance. What is needed here, therefore, is an art to fix him in his time and place, that is, painting, the only form which can show him in his environment. Music, says Quinet, was also truly revealed by Christianity, but belongs more properly in a philosophical age: Mozart and Beethoven are paralleled by Kant and Hegel. Given Chenavard's pessimism, it naturally becomes the art of decadence. The second example concerns the influence of Dante which is everywhere apparent in the iconog- raphy of at least three of the four auxiliary mosaics surrounding the central Palingenesis. The extent of the painter's indebtedness to the Divine Comedy has been pointed out in detail by Irene de Vasconcellos in L'inspiration dantesque dans l'art romantique frangais.63 This analysis shows that a large part of the thematic material for the Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise was borrowed from this one source, but the reason for so doing is not made clear. An explanation for the juxtaposition of Dante's epic and the summary of palingenetic history contained in the central design is suggested along these lines is the mystic drama Ahasverus, first published in x833. 59. The two works cited here are published together in Oeuvres complites de Edgar Quinet, ed. Pagnerre, Paris, x857- 58, I. 60. Quinet, op.cit., under "Avertissement." 61. ibid., p. x3. 62. ibid., pp. 9off. The similarities of this view to the posi- tion taken by Hegel will be obvious, but the determination of his exact influence upon Chenavard must await further study. 63. Paris, 1925 (a doctoral dissertation).</page><page sequence="18">PAUL CHENAVARD 255 by the closing paragraphs of Quinet's De l'origine des dieux.64 The author says that in the Middle Ages Christian symbolism, through the Church, dominated all other cults, and became the basis for a new art. In the synthesis thus achieved all previous conflicts between mythologies are resolved in one great harmony which exists in the universal human conscience. He continues: "The Divine Comedy of Dante will thus be the first act of a sort of last judgment in which will be explained and recognized in the light of universal understanding, the mistakes, the false alliances, the groups scattered by an action whose design the centuries themselves have complicated. In its abstract character, the Divine Comedy will not have for its issue the taking of a city, nor the venge- ance of a tribe, nor the migration of a people, but the progressive law of the secular world, an ideal Troy, the City of the Eternal. "Previous epics were the work and picture of a race or nation; the epic of Dante, which opens a new cycle, will appear to us as the creation and likeness of the human race. And now, when a man can do as he will with the annals of humanity as Homer did with those of the Greeks, when for unity he chooses the unity of history and nature, when he draws real beings together through the centuries in the marvelous path of the infinite, when scenes follow each other forming a chain-no longer in the shadows of Hell, Purgatory, or the Paradise of the Middle Ages, but in a limitless space shining with a fuller light, when man, I say, has done this, he will have arrived at the possible and necessary form of the epic in the modern world. Less finished in its contours than the Homeric poems, it will surpass them in grandeur and loftiness. His purpose is to disengage the real aspect of humanity from the mystic veils of the Divine Comedy, of Paradise Lost and the holy books of Christianity, just as the Iliad extracted the Greek form from the symbolic epics of the Achaeans and Pelasgians." From the evidence at hand, it would seem very probable that Chenavard set himself this very problem: the creation of the "epic in the modern world" contrasting it with the epic of the previous Christian epoch. Being opposed to the Church, unorthodox, and devoted to the problems of what seemed to him to be a new age, he wished to compose in pictorial form what others were attempting in literature, the story of the world to the full scale of all history, adjusted to the modern point of view. He, along with the other romantics of this persuasion, sensed a grandeur in man, and although he felt that it was fading rapidly, what better task could he perform than to set it forth on the walls and floor of the national shrine of his country? Further investigation may well bring to light other possible sources for his theories, but until more evidence is forthcoming, a number of questions will have to remain unanswered. Among these is the problem of why America, of whose social ideals he must have approved, symbolized the beginning of the final stage of decline? And why was world unity a sign of the same thing? These questions and many more remain to be answered, but even without their solutions, it is evident that his was a most unusual, and in some places possibly prophetic, reading of the story of mankind. Yet its very uniqueness defeated the purpose for which it was intended, since if its author wished to instruct and inspire his fellows, he could hardly have hoped to succeed by means of a system so complex and obscure that probably his own friends could not follow it entirely. Possibly he thought that this very obscurity would arouse men to the neglected study of the past and its meaning for the future, even though that future, paradoxically, was dark and foreboding. It was unfortunate that his general intentions in regard to history, pantheons, and human grandeur apparently got somewhat lost in the clouds of his detailed personal speculations on the drama of society. Silvestre and others who knew him suggest that this was the case, pointing out that his systems were not only often ephemeral, but frequently inconsistent and self-contradictory." Following the collapse of the Pantheon project, he became even more pessimistic and anti- Catholic. As mentioned above, he exhibited only once more-in I 869-causing a considerable stir 64. Quinet, op.cit., pp. 436-437. 65. cf. Thbophile Silvestre, Histoire des artistes, p. 105.</page><page sequence="19">256 THE ART BULLETIN with The Divine Tragedy (Fig. 2). This canvas was both large and somber, but aside from a rather finely complicated design of figures drawn mainly from the work of other artists, it doubtless deserved, on aesthetic grounds, to be forgotten along with numerous other history paintings of the day. But unlike them it had a meaning of considerable significance to anyone interested either in the artist's intellectual career or the subject of history painting in general. This meaning was concealed under a carefully calculated ambiguity which was, unfortunately, insufficient to prevent its being subjected to a peculiar form of censorship. Explanations of historical subjects were customarily supplied in the official catalogues of the Salon, and the description of Chenavard's picture stated that it represented the destruction of the various pagan cults in the triumphant presence of the Trinity."6 Odin, Thor, Apollo, Diana, Jupiter, Ammon, Typhon, and Maia, with other gods of the Norse and Eastern pantheons, were dying or performing final acts preparatory to death in the presence of God the Father who held his Son in his arms while the Holy Ghost fluttered beside them. Death, accompanied by an angel with a flaming sword, brandished the huge scythe with which destruction was to be accomplished. A brief examination of the painting, however, shows that this account does not explain certain peculiar features of it. Above the head of God are cherubim (not visible in the illustration) whose heads, instead of being those of infants, are skulls. Since they float directly over the Trinity, the official explanation that they refer to the divinities arranged along the bottom and on the sides of the composition seems hardly adequate. Furthermore, in the lower right-hand corner, Venus, possibly the most un-Christian resident of Olympus, is being borne away to safety in the arms of Love and Bacchus. Why should she escape? Most peculiar of all, in the upper left-hand corner, above all the other figures, is a nude hermaphrodite seated on a hippocamp, holding a lyre. The account in the catalogue mentions its presence saying that it symbolizes the "harmony of two natures or contrary principles," which is true enough, but does not explain what it is doing in this particular scene. Furthermore, although no halos grace the Trinity, this unusual figure has an aureole of light behind the head, the only personage so honored in the entire scene. Obviously there is more here than the catalogue cared to discuss. A different explanation is suggested in the postscript to a review of this Salon by Paul Casimir Perier. Here he charged flatly that the description offered was not correct, claiming further that the Church forced its publication rather than the true one which it found unacceptable.67 In short, the Index had been invoked to censor the artist's meaning, a procedure which Perier found ominous in 66. The subject matter here is sufficiently obscure so that it may be helpful to have the full account given in the catalogue: "Vers la fin des religions antiques et " l'avenement dans le ciel de la Trinite chritienne, la Mort, aidee de l'ange de la Justice et de l'Esprit, frappe les dieux qui doivent perir.

The author was undoubtedly right, for the significance of the picture as he states it is much more in keeping with the painter's ideas, which had already encountered clerical opposition during the years of the Pantheon project. When the picture was actually removed from the Salon Carrie to an obscure gallery in the rear, the power behind the action was doubtless the same. Chenavard him- self remained silent, though he said later that he had painted it only to be given to the Luxembourg, a gift which was at first refused. Perier's interpretation is to the effect that what is depicted is the downfall of all religions including Christianity itself, and from this position all details fall into a coherent whole. Composi- tionally, the scythe of Death threatens the Trinity as much or more than the other gods, while above hover the winged skulls presaging universal catastrophe. Under these circumstances the divinities of Christianity need not be marked with halos for all gods are now equal."8 The absence of these special attributes in the scenes of Christ's life in the Pantheon series adds credence to this hypothesis, as do Chenavard's well-known anticlerical views, now doubtless more pronounced than ever. But if all religion be lost, what will remain? The rescue of Venus and the hermaphrodite offer an answer. The goddess of beauty--dear to the mind of even so didactic a painter as Chenavard-thus saved by Love and the God Bacchus (who may here symbolize the element of genius in man) conveys the artist's belief in her immortality, as well as her independence of religious dogma. When superstition is gone, love, beauty, and genius will remain-the great inheritance from the classic past which Chenavard admired so much. This leaves the nimbed hermaphrodite to be explained. The significance of this figure can be supplied from a knowledge of the influence of Ballanche's writings on the artist. It will be recalled that he had not only described the division of Adam into two sexes, but had forecast the eventual reunion of the two, at which time the castes in society would disappear. In one sense, the tragedy in Eden had been a loss of unity, and unity to Ballanche was one of the fundamental principles of the universe. Assuming that Chenavard had adopted this idea, the hermaphrodite would signify the restoration of man to wholeness, to a state of reason and adjustment from which he had been removed so long ago. If religion, especially Catholicism, were considered as a powerful means for the perpetuation of castes, it would only be when it was overthrown that this solution to the problem of human misery could be achieved. With man, as man, once more triumphant, and love, beauty, and genius still abroad in the world, the future would indeed seem bright. It may be objected that this was far too optimistic for Chenavard, but as he apparently saw no immediate chance of such a liberation from the dogmas he disliked or any interruption of his grim cycle, he could remain as gloomy as he wished. In the calendar, religion ceases only a scant seven hundred years before the final extinction of mankind. If the choice before society was either to do away with religion or perish miserably, many would be unable to draw much comfort from his message. Since he intended the picture as a gift to the nation, it may be that it was his final, if ambiguous, statement to his fellow citizens, a sequel to the lessons he had been prevented from teaching in the Pantheon. Curiously enough, he reported that two offers of purchase came to him, one from a Saint-Simonian and the other from the Church!19 In its interest in mankind as such, and in its persistent agnosticism, the content of his art was modern, even if expressed in terms which were almost painfully anachronistic, but the world of the later century was in no mood to understand this, even had the pictures remained on view. Although The Divine Tragedy was eventually received by the Luxembourg and exhibited there, it seems to have aroused no great interest. What France would have thought of the Pantheon series had it been permanently installed is difficult to guess, but almost certainly it would have been regarded 68. In a letter to Paul Marieton, quoted by Vial ("Chena- vard et Soulary," pp. xo6-io7), he said that it had been painted "without enmity toward any of these divinities who all seem to me to have equal merit. .. ." 69. Vial, loc.cit.</page><page sequence="21">258 THE ART BULLETIN as unsatisfactory because the reading of history which it presented was too difficult and mystical to be readily understood even if the premises on which it rested could be accepted, which was also unlikely. And yet the cycle remains, in spite of being forgotten in the history of nineteenth century painting, as the one large scale effort ever made to put into pictorial form the majestic ideas of human destiny which had occupied the attention of so many literary figures in the romantic move- ment. The fact that Chenavard was a poor painter does not invalidate the fact that he was endowed with a sweeping vision, an epic imagination, and an enormous familiarity with both myth and history as it was understood by the intellectual circle in which he moved. His monumental pessimism can possibly be somewhat better appreciated in these days than in those of the materialistic optimism of the not-too-distant past. BRYN MAWR COLLEGE</page></plain_text>
