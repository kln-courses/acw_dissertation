<plain_text><page sequence="1">Henrietta Mondry, Political Animals: Representing Dogs in Modem Russian Culture , Leiden: Brill, 2015, xviii, 432 p. Reviewed by David N. Wells, Curtin University, Perth, Western Australia The animal most closely associated with Russia by foreigners is undoubtedly the bear, as witnessed by countless political cartoons and other cultural references over a period of centuries. On the other hand, Henrietta Mondry's detailed and compelling investigation of the role of the dog in Russian consciousness and thought places that animal firmly at the centre of Russian self-perception, and makes the case that 4 the dog is modern Russia's most representative and most political animal' (1). This is a broad claim - and this book is not just about the representation of dogs, but is in fact a cultural history of Russia taking the dog as its centre. The claim, however, is plausibly sustained and justified by the wealth and complexity of Mondry's examples. The source material for Mondry's investigation comes mostly from high literary texts of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, although the project also embraces culture in a more general sense by referring extensively to other media as well: notably film, painting and performance art, and also to the use of dogs in science, specifically to</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 163 Pavlov's behaviourist experiments, and to the use of dogs in Soviet space exploration. Most of the literary works discussed are prose fiction, though the verse of Mayakovsky, Khlebnikov and indeed Zabolotsky also receives due attention. The construction of the dog in folk belief is outlined in the book's introduction and provides a recurrent counterpoint to the discussions of historical dog imagery in the main part of the book. One of Mondry's central tenets is that dogs are almost inevitably treated as surrogates of humans. The Aesopian tradition provides a key to this phenomenon. The animal world either provides a simpler more transparent version of humanity, or else helps avoid the restrictions of censorship (tsarist or Soviet) by giving a story with a surface meaning different from the hidden meaning which is available to those who have the key to its understanding. This automatically gives dogs a 'political' status, as highlighted in the book's title, in that dogs are used to refer to the ways in which groups of people interrelate with each other. It also gives them a 'psychological' aspect, as reference to dogs is used to explore the workings of the human mind. Mondry organises the huge range of dog-related material which she has identified in a series of thematic clusters, which allows her to examine selected images and topoi in considerable detail. This approach to some extent inevitably treats as secondary the development of dog imagery in its historical aspect, though in fact the clusters are simultaneously organised in approximately chronological order. The structure is also intentionally loose, reflecting a considerable degree of both conceptual and chronological overlap, and indeed the close readings of individual texts are a particularly valuable part of the book. Mondry's earlier chapters are concerned with cruelty and injustice - either cruelty to dogs and other animals, or cruelty towards people at the expense of dogs, and an instability in the relative status of dogs and humans. One key text here is Dostoeveskii's Bra≈•ia Karamazovy , which includes both the story of a rich landowner using dogs to hunt down a serf boy who had offended him, and also a lengthy subplot about children's cruelty to one particular dog and its broader consequences. Both episodes serve to highlight the novel's broader moral and religious preoccupations. Another key theme is the relation between dogs and human underdogs. This can often be complex, as Mondry's reading of Turgenev's Mumu shows - the mute servant Gerasim is mistreated by his mistress just as she mistreats the puppy Mumu, but at the same time also exhibits cruel tendencies of his own. Much attention is given to the role of dogs in the penal and national defence systems, both in tsarist Russia and more importantly in the Soviet period: the use of the dog's perspective in stories like Georgii Vladimov's Vernyi Ruslan, for example, highlights the ambiguities and deficiencies of human self-management. The role indeterminacy seen here appears a fortiori in a series of 'transformation narratives' concerning dogs, from werewolf stories, through Fedor Sologub's 'Belaia sobaka' with its dog-woman, to the surgical experimentation described in Bulgakov's 'Sobach'e serdtse' and, mediated by the heroic anthropomorphism applied to dogs in the service of science, to Oleg Kul ik' s provocative reconstruction of himself as a dog in the 1990s. Whether or not you accept the premise that the dog is the central point of Russian culture, Mondry's book has a great deal to say on many different levels and will be read</page><page sequence="3">164 REVIEWS with profit by anyone interested in Russian literature and culture (whether dog lovers or not). A detailed index of themes is provided to allow for further exploration, though it is curious that this does not include either works or names of authors.</page></plain_text>
