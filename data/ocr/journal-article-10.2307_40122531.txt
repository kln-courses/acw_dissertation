Before World War I a poetic renaissance swept over Hungary: a whole generation made its appearance in the new literary review Nyugat ("West"). The best poets of the Nyugat have</page><page sequence="2">314 BOOKS ABROAD since become Hungarian classics but even its second- and third-rank poets have written memorable, often excellent poems. Anna Lesznai belonged to this second rank but her poetic career, after a few years of creative flourishing and domestic happiness, was bro- ken and upset by wars, revolutions, and emi- grations. In fact, she died in exile in the United States, but fortunately not before she was belatedly recognized and published in Hungary. Her "Selected Poems," a collection spanning more than half a century and com- prising the best of Lesznai's entire lyrical ceuvre, appeared last year shortly after her death. This poetry is very feminine in its exuberant, passionate love of life and sensuous pantheism. Lesznai is related to everything and everyone: she regards nature as her sister; her attitude to males is sometimes motherly, sometimes that of an eager young bride; even her prayers to God are permeated with feminine expectations and desires: "And in drunken awe I faint / on the ornate robe of your living world"/. The richness of the universe is the constant theme of her early poetry, but she perceives this rich- ness mainly as a woman: through the senses, without the ambition to control it through patterns of thought. Her pantheism, often anthropomorphic in the extreme, is out of fashion today and many of her poems seem dated with their forced alliterations, glaring adjectives, and artificial simplicity of diction. Yet, having sifted out the inadequacies and failings of this poetry, we find a woman im- posing in her womanhood, a human being full of the desire to give, and if we regard her poetry as a sacrificial offering, a spontaneous gift to everybody, we might come close to understanding the remarkable human phe- nomenon that was Anna Lesznai.
