<plain_text><page sequence="1">"The Meanest Thing that Feels": Anthropomorphizing Animals in Romanticism ONNO DAG OERLEMANS Theorizing an understanding of the "Other" has been a major impetus of philosophy and literary criticism this century, especially over the past several decades. Even a casual survey of such writing (think of Levinas, Derrida and Foucault), though, reveals that the concept of the Other is commonly assumed to include only the human, the foreignness of other individuals, races or cultures. Outside of explicitly environmentalist writing, and perhaps, indirectly, Heidegger's writing on "Being" (which need not be specifically human), the Otherness of the natural world in general, and animals in par ticular, has been overlooked. While those who write on envi ronmental and animal rights issues often make use of the ethical and political implications of abstract and human-centered no tions of otherness, there is no real scholarly dialogue between those with ecological concerns and those who speak for (or as) excluded or oppressed voices within political or literary realms. The importance of establishing such a dialogue can espe cially be seen in the scholarship on Romanticism. That Roman ticism explored alterity in a profound and original way used to be an article of faith for scholars of the field. One way or another, it was felt, Romantic poets and artists uncovered and made known forms of otherness within nature, society and consciousness itself. For at least the past fifteen years, however, this easy generalization has been challenged by feminist and new historicist critics. Both argue that the alterity supposedly uncovered by writers of the period (nature in Wordsworth and Shelley's "Epipsychidion" being nearly paradigmatic examples) is in most cases an idealized projection of the writer's ego; Mosaic 27/1 0027-1276-94/010032S01,50©Mosaic</page><page sequence="2">2 Mosaic Volume 27/1 (March 1994) worse yet, they argue, the apparent otherness of women, the working classes, ethnicity and material social forces is only further obscured, driven deeper into alterity as it were, by Romanticism's foregrounding of the all-knowing, visionary con sciousness of its white male authors. It has become very nearly a given of recent criticism of Romanticism that it has feminized nature so that it may be characterized as both nurturing and infinitely malleable, a body or entity whose creative powers may be usurped even as it is literally inscribed by male desire. As a necessary feature of this move, it is argued, women are "naturalized," made a part of the landscape and so assumed to be part of an otherness which, finally, denies them the possibil ity of becoming self-possessing subjects. Feminist-environmen talists like Carolyn Merchant have demonstrated that this association is not so much a feature of Romanticism as it is a characteristic of Western male thought. Yet it is fair, I think, to say that Romanticism represents a peculiar climax of these ideas, because it is a period in which the idea of nature comes under intense scrutiny. While the revisionist view of Romanticism's reification of self and its mystification of nature is not exactly in danger of becoming a new hegemony yet, I would like to complicate it by exploring a little-studied area of concern within the Romantic period. It seems to me that representations of animals in Ro mantic art and poetry reveal a profound interest in a genuine otherness in nature (the sentience of animals) which potentially stands outside the nature/femininity equation as understood by feminist critics of Romanticism. That is, femininity is far less different from masculine consciousness than the kinds of "be ing" Romantic writers and painters found in animals, which afforded them an explicit means of exploring their own being in terms of species rather than covertly through gender. This interest, furthermore, anticipates the efforts of contemporary environmentalism to de-center our view of the world, to place human beings firmly within, rather than outside or on top of, nature—with nature here being understood as a complex and interdependent web of living beings. My argument begins with the realization that the act of rep resenting animal life is, like most acts of representation, a phe nomenon whose real complications we ignore. Most of us trained to even a high-school level of sophistication in the biological</page><page sequence="3">Onno Dag Oerlemans 3 sciences know that in representing non-human sentience we are too prone to anthropomorphize, to ascribe human characteristics of emotion or thought to animal appearance, behavior and con sciousness (about which, elementary science teaches us, we can actually know almost nothing). Anthropomorphism at its most obvious, as in much children's literature, strikes us as naive or quaint, a sign of a charming delusion, perhaps. Yet it is difficult to imagine a perfectly neutral representation, one which prohib its or forestalls this kind of imagining; perhaps only the most grotesquely neutral of representations, say a map of a specific animal's anatomy, succeeds, but only by literally exploding the object. Abstractly considered, the problem of how we are to view animals neutrally, to see them as they are and not as they are like us, probably has no solution. We cannot, finally, distin guish those features of their being (emotions, desires, etc.) which are truly theirs from those with which we are familiar because we experience them ourselves. Thus it is that the prohibition against anthropomorphizing might itself be seen an instrument of anthropocentrism—that world view which turns all that is not human into an otherness subservient to human needs. The sheer volume of representa tions of animals in popular and high art attests to our interest in animals; and so it is striking that the general prohibition against anthropomorphism has very nearly prevented serious analysis of this interest. Such representations are very often strikingly ideological. It is not difficult, for instance, to see in many depictions of horses and farm-animals (which spans both high and popular art, and has done so since the early 18th century) the valorization not simply of human domestication of nature, but the association, even the co-opting, of this value by the aristocrat, land-owning class, so that paintings or other representations of the hunt, the race, or simply the ride simul taneously display conspicuous leisure, wealth and dominance (in all senses of the word). Similarly and equally obviously, the anatomy chart is ideological in that it turns the rat we are to dissect into a collection of parts, of mere objects, which we may manipulate at our pleasure. The rat's life, or even the question of what that life is worth, is subsumed in the high gloss of scientific factuality. What is striking about the Romantic representations of ani mals that I will explore below, however, is that they force</page><page sequence="4">4 Mosaic Volume 27/1 (March 1994) Fig. 1. George Stubbs. A Horse Frightened by a Lion (c. 1790-95). Yale Center for British Art, Paul Mellon Collection readers or viewers to confront the problems raised by the issue of anthropomorphism (which existed in the 18th century as a matter of the accepted hierarchy of species rather than science education), as well as ideologies inherent in certain acts of representation. Romantic depictions of animals force us to acknowledge that animals are a kind of life in nature that is at once much like our own, and which is yet different from it, not capable of being reduced to merely human designs or desires. The Romantic representation of animal life suggests, finally, that we must move beyond the notion that every such act of representation must be anthropomorphic; we must stop think ing that whenever we imagine animal life we are necessarily projecting onto it characteristics which are the sole province of humanity. Indeed, an examination of the representation of ani mals in Romanticism can enable us to see that the concept of anthropomorphism, and the consequent prohibition of it, are inherently a feature of anthropocentrism.</page><page sequence="5">Onno Dag Oerlemans 5 Animals appear in literature and art of all periods, of course, but even a casual survey of the art and literature of the Romantic movement reveals that there is increased attention given to animals and the "animal." In such a survey, we might think of the magnificent horses of Delacroix and Gericault, or Stubbs's widely imitated images of a lion attack ing a horse (see Fig. 1)—which have become visual clichés for the many vague ideas associated with romanticism. Although we do not stop to think about it much, the poetry of the Roman tic period is also rife with descriptions of, references to, and meditations on, animals, many of which have become, like Delacroix's horses, paradigmatic or exemplary moments of the literature of the period. The most famous animal of English Romantic poetry is of course Coleridge's albatross, while Keats's "Ode to a Nightin gale," Shelley's "To a Skylark," and Coleridge's "The Night ingale," are amongst the best known poems of the period. Coleridge was almost as well known to his contemporaries for his naively Utopian "To a Young Ass," which addresses a donkey as a "Poor little Foal of an oppressed race" and "hails" it as a "brother." Shelley spent considerable energy in Queen Mab and in two pamphlets on "the vegetable diet" in explain ing how humankind's abuse of animals (most of all through eating them) was a palpable "root" of evil, and that its elimi nation would necessarily be a key to the establishment of a genuine Utopia. Blake is probably most prolific of all the poets in his references to animals of almost all kinds, though we need look no further than The Marriage of Heaven and Hell—in which he asks "How do you know but ev'ry Bird that cuts the airy way, / Is an immense world of delight, clos'd by your senses five?"—to get an immediate sense of the complexity of his interest; it includes both a striking awareness of animal sentience, and a sense that the variety and complexity of life is a profound metaphor for the disunity of nature after the Fall. Wordsworth also displays a frequent interest in animals and their relation to man; The Excursion's Wanderer, for instance, is said in Book II to have "loved" all animals "In his capacious mind," and, more radically yet, to "acknowledge" that they have "rights" (41-47). The existence of animals in Romantic art has been assumed simply to be part of the landscape, as obvious and relatively</page><page sequence="6">6 Mosaic Volume 27/1 (March 1994) uninteresting perhaps, as Wordsworth's love of trees and flow ers. When they are noted at all, animals in poetry and art have been immediately converted to figures, as symbolic devices signifying the poets themselves (for instance, in the many poems which emblematize birds as solitary singers) or as syn ecdoches of nature and the spirit that animates it. This is a step so automatic that we barely pause to reflect on how or why this is done, what it means to say that animals represent, or even are, nature. For instance, recognizing animals as a part of the landscape can distance humanity from nature in allowing us to regard the "bestial" and instinctive as being other than culture; or it can bring us closer to nature, since countless similarities between animals and humans have been recognized, even above the protestations of religious thinkers like Descartes (who ar gued that animals were equivalent to machines). Recognizing the complexity of seeing and representing ani mals can revitalize our understanding of what nature was for the Romantics. Like Jonathan Bate in his recent book on the pragmatics of Wordsworth's "environmental imagination," 1 dispute the assertion by Alan Liu and others that concepts of nature are always used in Romanticism in general and by Wordsworth in particular to validate the supremacy of indi vidual (human) consciousness, and are always framed by and reducible to definitions of culture (Bate 56-57). What is cen trally important about the animal to the Romantic artists and poets I examine below is that it presents them with an otherness that stands at the boundaries of understandings of the human. My first example of the representation of animals, a painting by George Stubbs, titled Freeman, the Earl of Clarendon's Gamekeeper, with a Dying Doe and a Hound (1800), highlights the historical complexities surrounding the representation of animals (see Fig. 2). The painting depicts a gamekeeper who is lifting the head of a dying doe by the ear, and who holds in his other hand a knife with which he is about to slit the doe's throat. Blood oozes from a bullet wound—the gamekeeper's gun lies on top of his hat just behind him. The doe stares pathetically and directly at the viewer; so too does the gamekeeper, whose look seems rather to be of defiance, or at least, complete indifference toward the act he is about to finish.</page><page sequence="7">Onno Dag Oerlemans 7 Fig. 2. George Stubbs. Freeman, the Earl of Clarendon's Gamekeeper, with a Dying Doe and a Hound (c. 1800). Yale Center for British Art, Paul Mellon Collection The superbly painted hound seems almost a mirror image of the doe, and stares up at the gamekeeper with its ears back. The dog may simply be excited by the kill; yet it does appear to be looking pleadingly at its master, as if asking him to spare the doe. To the modern viewer, I think, the painting seems unam biguously to suggest the cruelty of killing the doe. The painting's dark background, which suggests both the gloom and perhaps the furtiveness of the act, also helps to highlight the trio of living creatures in the foreground, at the very center of which is the doe's apparently anguished face. The painting frames the moment of taking an animal's life; the gamekeeper is poised as if to ask the viewer what he or she makes of the killing of an animal, with the glory and thrill of the hunt utterly removed. The doe's eyes appear to plead directly with us to intervene, while the placid expression of the gamekeeper points to a tension typical in Stubbs between the apparent naturalism of</page><page sequence="8">8 Mosaic Volume 27/1 (March 1994) the scene and its animal life, and the pose or artifice of the humans in it. Moreover, simply by looking up at us the game keeper appears to want to remind us that what he is doing is simply and only a job—he is culling the herd for his master in order to maintain its health (so that, not incidentally, he may continue to hunt it with his hounds). The painting allows us to anthropomorphize the suffering of the deer, and at the same time, to question the nature of that anthropomorphizing. The painting's extraordinary ambiguity neatly puts it at the center of two different controversies in such a way as to appeal to audiences on both sides of both debates. The most inflamed of the controversies had to do not with the cruelty of hunting (to which I shall return below), but with the control of hunting. The Game Laws, first written in 1671, prohibited all hunting of game except by landowners. The aim of these laws, beside the obvious one of preserving game so that the wealthiest would always have something to hunt, was also, according to Steven Deuchar, to keep guns out of the hands of the lower classes (79ff). Equally important, the laws were a way of strengthening the very act of "owning" land. Not only did landholders own the soil and stones and trees, but they had rights to whatever animal happened to wander onto their property. The wild products of nature were effectively made property by these laws, which ran directly counter to the much older belief that the fruits of nature, particularly game, were made for everyone to exploit. Thus at the center of opposition to the Game Laws was the common under standing that nature was, or included, undomesticated animals, whereby they were seen as a sort of "public" property, and so could be hunted for food by anyone. By the time of Stubbs's painting, opposition to the Game Laws had reached a height. Poaching was considered a right by many of the working class, and wealthy Londoners considered that all forms of hunting ought to be a privilege open to them as well. The controversy put the gamekeeper in a peculiar and uncomfortable position. He was a symbol of the country gentleman's right of ownership and, moreover, was a mere laborer with rights that otherwise only these gentleman had. To all those whom the Game Laws had turned into poachers or poachers-in-waiting, the gamekeeper was the -real poacher. This was supported by the fact that the black market for game was largely supplied by gamekeepers.</page><page sequence="9">Onno Dag Oerlemans 9 For the patron of Stubbs's painting, the work presents an image of the gamekeeper as efficient and boldly indifferent, and it emphasizes the duty of the responsible landowner, even when it is unpleasant, to maintain the health of the herd by culling it. The image also speaks of the generosity of the Earl who allows himself and his interests to be represented by one of his servants. To the public who could buy the print of the composition, however, the painting suggests that the gamekeeper, who ap pears to be alone in the woods at night, is a poacher. His look of indifference becomes one of explicit insolence. He is only a servant, and yet he is able to hunt; the Game Laws have put him in a situation in which he is exceeding his station in life; his affectation is perhaps suggested by the way his gun is pomp ously posed on his hat. To the non-landholding viewer, nature in the painting appears wild and free, as represented in the dark and foreboding background. There is, moreover, no sign of ownership here, and the animal's anguish in death, and the hound's apparent sympathy for it, suggest that the gamekeeper ■ and his actions are somehow contrary to nature and to natural sympathy. The fact of culling itself would surely have been seen as a painfully obvious reason to liberalize game laws by those who opposed them; landowners have so many deer that they brutally eliminate excess. A legitimate source of food, and pos sibly excitement, is explicitly wasted. The controversy over the ownership of game highlights for us the way that an animal painting can point to politically opposed ideas of nature. For those who commissioned paintings by Stubbs, for instance, the animals painted, whether highly bred horses or the animals of the hunt, represented the country gentleman's control over nature; he is revealed as being com fortably atop an apparently natural hierarchy. It is not hard to imagine that, like the actual animal itself, the painting conferred on its owner a sense of possessing the energy, grace and power of the original. What makes Stubbs's paintings distinctive, however, and what makes them noteworthy in a study of the representation of ani mals in Romanticism, is that they also very often attempt to render the animal as strange, distant and "other" than its would-be owner. That is, they represent animals as having an energy and presence not possessed or even understood by the humans around them. Paradoxically, this is achieved by attempting to give the</page><page sequence="10">10 Mosaic Volume 27/1 (March 1994) animals expression, by painting them as possessing and commu nicating emotion, which we might recognize as a form of anthro pomorphizing. They are made to look different, that is, by making them look remotely human; they seem different from what we perhaps expect, because they suddenly seem somewhat like us, instantly blurring in the minds of their viewers hierarchies and distinctions as old as the Bible. This is especially remarkable because in 18th-century England most animal painting was stiff and two-dimensional. The opposition of animal naturalness to human woodenness occurs in nearly all of Stubbs's paintings that show humans and animals together. Almost without excep tion, the animals have expressions which reveal real intensity, fear, courage or sympathy, while the humans are stiff, placid and relatively indifferent to those around them. (Notable examples include The Grosvenor Hunt [1762], Lord Grosvenor's Arabian [1765], Gimcrack on Newmarket Heath [1765], and Warren Hastings [1791].) To begin to allow animals expression in this way, even to raise the issue of anthropomorphizing, is also to begin to entertain the possibility that animals can be considered to exist as individuals, to possess some kind of consciousness and self-consciousness, or, more simply, to be subjects. This apparent bias towards animals brings us to the second controversy which the Freeman painting highlights or exploits. That is, this painting too is clearly capable of arousing its viewers to feel sympathy for the animal as suffering by the hand of man. By 1800, Stubbs could not have been unfamiliar with the debate concerning cruelty to animals, especially suf fering caused by hunting. That it was possible to be cruel to animals was not in itself a new idea (Plutarch, Pythagoras, Montaigne and St. Francis, and less famously, Margaret Newcastle, had all written against cruelty to animals), but the late 18th century gave rise to the organized movement against cruelty, which attempted to define precisely what cruelty to animals would be, and introduced the more radical idea that non-human animals could have rights. The history of this movement has been the subject of consid erable recent research by such historians as Harriet Ritvo, James Turner and Keith Thomas, and there is not space to rehearse it here. It will suffice for my purpose to note that the first laws against cruelty to animals were passed in England in 1822, and that the debate existed so visibly that by the 1830s (when the</page><page sequence="11">Onno Dag Oerlemans 11 RSPCA was formed) to advocate laws on the behalf of animals ceased to be considered the work of revolutionaries or madmen. For some the idea of eliminating cruelty to animals was a consuming passion, but for many others a concern for animal welfare was a self-evident extension of moral sympathy. To give just a few examples: William Hogarth's engravings The Four Stages of Cruelty (1751) depict the origins of a murderer in the tormenting of animals; Samuel Johnson wrote in The Idler against vivisection (53-56); James Thomson's The Sea sons argues in favor of vegetarianism and against hunting, as does Cowper's The Task (10-11, 52-53, 103-06; 271-77); in Emile, Rousseau preaches vegetarianism as a way of countering widespread cruelty to animals (153-56); in his Dictionary Voltaire attacks Descartes's argument that animals were mere machines (64-66); and in a footnote made famous by animal liberationists, Bentham in his Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation (1780) argues that animals must be accorded certain rights simply because they, like humans, can suffer pain (412). As Deuchar argues, the painting of hunting scenes enjoyed a kind of renaissance in the mid-18th century, and one reason was that such paintings were designed to give hunting credibility and respect as a pastime for gentlemen, since in the (urban) public mind it was not associated primarily with nobility and vigor, but with drunkenness, rowdiness and prodigality (45-62). By 1790, however, opposition to hunting had come to include the argument that it was cruel to the animal. One would have expected, then, that in painting a picture commissioned by a landholder, Stubbs would have avoided scenes of animal suffering and possible cruelty. That Stubbs risked showing hunting (or the maintenance of a herd for hunting) in an unglamorous light suggests again that he had a fine sense for appealing to all possible audiences. Pro-hunting viewers might see in the painting simply the realism of the act, which confers upon them a sense of their understanding of and proximity to nature "red in tooth and claw." For these same viewers any sympathy for the animal which the painting seems to invite is to be overcome (Freeman's bold gaze seems almost to demand it), as such sympathy must likewise be suppressed in the act of hunting itself, written off as the product of a new and artificial sentimentality which encour aged the belief that animals could feel. Moreover, pro-hunting</page><page sequence="12">12 Mosaic Volume 27/1 (March 1994) viewers could easily take comfort in the still widely held and orthodox belief that animals could not feel fear or even pain. And, of course, viewers who opposed hunting, as I have sug gested, could see in the painting a dramatic statement which likens hunting to murder. If the work of Stubbs raises the issue of anthropomorphizing without answering it, or by playing to both sides of it, we can find within Romantic poetry a serious attempt to confront the issue directly; put another way, poets like John Clare, Robert Burns, the early Coleridge, and most of all, Wordsworth raise the possibility that it is the concept of anthropomorphism itself that is at fault. In seeing signs of subjectivity in animals, we are not necessarily projecting human qualities onto them, but recog nizing in them natural attributes which we share with them. Writing this sympathy off as merely the projection of human characteristics—which the very introduction of the concept of anthropomorphism has the effect of doing—errs not only in its underestimation of animal being, but in its extraordinary exag geration and deification of human being. One of the effects of this anthropocentrism is to cut us off from the animal, and perhaps the entire natural, world, to turn it into a purely material and phenomenal realm, set in contrast to the spiritual one of human being. The Romantic poets provide us with early textual examples of what Margot Norris has called a "biocentric" imagination, one which attempts to collapse the "cardinal distinctions be tween animal and human." More radically, such a biocentric vision aims not simply to justify feeling/or animals, but to open up the potential for feeling like animals. Animal life is seen as possessing a purity of desire, a fullness and self-sufficiency, that humans lack. As Norris explains, there is a difference in natural and cultural ontology: the animal's desire is direct and appropriative while the human's is mediated and directed toward the recognition of the "other"; the animal's natural power is sufficient for its kind while the human's biological power is inadequate to capture recognition and achieve prestige and must be supplemented by signifiers and symbols; the animal is autotelic and lives for itself in the fullness of its being while the cultural man lives in imitation of the desire of the "other," driven by his</page><page sequence="13">Onno Dag Oerlemans 13 manqué-a-être; the animal surrenders to biological fate and evolutionary destiny while the human disregards the physicality of what is and reads his fate in the gaze of the "other." (3-4) To say that Romanticism questions the prohibition against conceiving of animal sentience will perhaps seem surprising to both those who, with Geoffrey Hartman, have interpreted its "return to nature" as enacting primarily the discovery of individual human consciousness, and those who, with Hartman's histori cist critics, argue that this return effects only an escape from social and historical awareness. As Bate suggests, for both Hartman and his critics nature is a cultural fiction which allows for an artificial and remote space where the self may become, or appear to become, independent and self-actualized (55-57). To find, or perhaps rediscover, the biocentric strain in English Romanticism, let us turn to some examples. We might begin with Burns, who wrote a number of animal poems, including "The Auld Farmer's New-year-morning Salutation," the anti-hunting poem "On Seeing a Wounded Hare," and the more famous "To a Mouse." The stark contrast of man and the "Wee, sleekit, cow'rin, tim'rous beastie" in this last poem will perhaps initially be read as the comic and naive thinking of its narrator's peasant persona, the point of which is to disarm sophisticated criticism of the homey saw at the poem's conclusion that "foresight may be vain: / The best laid schemes o' mice an' men / Gang aft a-gley" (11. 38-40). But we can also read the poem as an attempt abruptly to undermine our sophisticated and immediate sense that the travails of a mouse are not worthy poetic matter. Most of the poem's readers, then and now, think of^mice as vermin, pathetically small scaven gers. The poem bluntly invites the reader to put oneself into the position of one who has spontaneous sympathy for the mouse, to imagine briefly the thoughts of the speaker, who is in turn capable of imagining the world of the mouse and so is able to be truly sorry man's dominion Has broken Nature's social union, An' justifies that ill opinion Which makes thee startle At me, thy poor earth-born companion, An' fellow mortal. (11.7-12)</page><page sequence="14">14 Mosaic Volume 27/1 (March 1994) Anthropomorphism (which the OED reminds us originally meant the ascribing of human characteristics to God) here is either muted by, or made to seem identical to, the process of adopting the perspective of the peasant narrator. This has double impli cations, especially since, as Keith Thomas explains, part of the rhetoric of social domination by one class of humans over others has always included that of portraying the masses as animals that needed to be controlled or domesticated (45-46). The poem suggests, that is, an uncomfortable analogy between the narrator's compassion for the mouse and the reader's com passion for the narrator, or peasant-farmers in general. Readers perhaps initially recoil at the realization that they have in some way reduced peasants to mice (what we might call the trick of the poem), assuming them to live blindly in the present, buffeted by fate, just as the narrator describes the mouse in the final stanza of the poem. The way out of this bind is to do as the narrator does, which is momentarily to invert the hierarchy—to imagine and even celebrate the life of the animal as sharing a root identity with humans in nature (here simply the struggle to live). The final effect of this, it seems to me, is to reforge "nature's social union" to include animals, as well as all classes of humans, in the realm of what we might simply call life that is to be respected. What Roderick Nash has described as the progressive ex pansion of natural rights to include not only oppressed classes of humans, but also animals specifically and nature in general, was not an unknown strain of revolutionary thought in the late 18th century. The idea was that a truly reformed society would liberate not only the unenfranchised, but also oppressed and exploited animals. There were several publications during this period which called attention to the plight of animals, and these are undoubtedly a source for Shelley's similar arguments in his vegetarian tracts published over a decade later. Both Thomas Paine and Mary Wollstonecraft reflect an occasional interest in animal welfare in their writings on general, societal change. As the radical vegetarian John Oswald wrote, since the "barbarous governments of Europe" were "giving way to a better system of things...the day is beginning to approach when the growing sentiment of peace and goodwill towards men will also em brace, in a wide circle of benevolence, the lower orders of life" (Thomas 185).</page><page sequence="15">Onno Dag Oerlemans 15 It is in this spirit, certainly, that Coleridge wrote his poem "To a Young Ass" which presents the poet's encounter with a chained ass and her foal. The asses are described as being part of "an oppressed race," and the bulk of the poem is given to a description of the speaker's sympathy for the plight of animals who are made miserable by overwork and neglect. Like Robert Burns and John Clare, Coleridge connects the fate of animals to the fate of the working poor, and the poem ends with an explicit comparison of the animals' imagined owner with the asses themselves: Poor Ass! thy master should have learnt to show Pity—best taught by fellowship of Woè! For much I fear me that He lives like thee, Half famished in a land of Luxury! How askingly its footsteps hither bend, It seems to say, "And have I then one Friend?" Innocent Foal! thou poor despised Forlorn! I hail thee Brother—spite of the fool's scorn! And fain would take thee with me, in the Dell Of Peace and mild Equality to dwell, Where Toil shall call the charmer Health his bride, And Laughter tickle Plenty's ribless side! How thou wouldst toss thy heels in gamesome play, And frisk about, as lamb or kitten gay! Yea! and more musically sweet to me Thy dissonant harsh bray of joy would be, Than warbled melodies that soothe to rest The aching of pale Fashion's vacant breast. (11.19-36) The plight of animals in the poem can easily be read simply as an allegory for the situation of the working masses in England, a topic which it would have been dangerous for Coleridge to write about explicitly in 1794. Yet the plight of the poor is made explicit; the speaker fears that the asses' master "lives like thee, / Half famished in a land of Luxury!" (11. 21-22). These lines suggest that the poem's sympathy for the foal is to be taken literally, as an example of the poet's (not unproblematic) spirit of compassion and egalitarianism that fired his early zeal for the Revolution and his Utopian scheme for a Pantisocracy. As Richard Holmes has suggested (81-82), we can find in Coleridge's sympathy for animals an early source for his idea of the "one life within us and abroad," a sense that individual</page><page sequence="16">16 Mosaic Volume 27/1 (March 1994) spirit is reflected or circumscribed by a spirit of and in nature. We are always ready to think of this later idea Platonically, that the "one life" is an abstraction sensed or understood only by the deepest inward reflection (an idea which is indeed encour aged by "The Eolian Harp," and much other writing by Coleridge on the topic), but the early poem encourages us to take seri ously the possibility that the idea of a conscious spirit in nature is partially evinced by signs of consciousness in animals. So in "To a Young Ass" the speaker unabashedly imagines in detail the spirit of the foal, now diminished by a society increasingly cut off from nature, and as Harriet Ritvo demonstrates, notori ously abusive to animals and the poor alike (125). The "Dell of Peace" is Edenic, nature returned to an imagined pre-industrial state in which every spirit would, like the foal, take spontane ous pleasure in its natural setting. The utopianism of the poem will still appear to most of us, no doubt, as embarrassingly naive. Certainly Coleridge was ridi culed for the poem when it appeared, and became the obvious target of much satire. Yet we can take it, I think, as a sign of how his thinking about nature and animals begins. Coleridge did write a few more poems that include significant references to animals. One of these is "The Nightingale," a poem about how to ascribe meaning to the apparent sentience of a bird. Of course, the poem is also a meditation on the process of interpreting external signs in general, of creating symbols, and of understanding the (im)possibility of spontaneity within the form of the lyric. Yet this meditation takes the form of a debate over the nature of anthropomorphizing; the speaker wants to know the song's mean ing for what it is, and not project onto it the melancholy of literary tradition. The bird in the poem, and, indeed, in all of the great bird poems of the English Romantic tradition, is itself part of the "presence" of nature, a sign that consciousness can be something other than human. Nature is neither impenetrable nor entirely material, but contains "a Life, a Presence like the Air," as Wordsworth puts it in "The Green Linnet." While birds and animals are never equivalent to the totality of the "spirit" in nature, they are the most palpable sign of its existence. Indeed, the Romantic gesture of putting the self into nature, of sensing that individual consciousness is a part of a larger spirit, seems to have roots in, or is at least reflected by, the undermining of the hubris of anthropocentrism. In "The</page><page sequence="17">Onno Dag Oerlemans 17 Nightingale," and even in such poems as Shelley's "To a Sky lark," and Keats's "Ode to a Nightingale," which are much more explicit in their desire to transform the bird into a symbol for something human or supra-human, the song of the bird is the immediate evidence of other life that can take the poet beyond the confines of his life and his art, allowing him to understand an ideal process in which the poet would, as Coleridge writes in "The Nightingale," have stretched his limbs Beside a brook in mossy forest-dell, By sun or moon-light, to the influxes Of shapes and sounds and shifting elements Surrendering his whole spirit. (11.25-29) Loving nature, or knowing it, has as a preliminary requirement the realization that there is Life beyond human life that is worth considering. In the light of such evidence for Coleridge's early thoughts on animal consciousness (noting that, as with most ideas in Coleridge, the complete evidence is far from consistent), it is perhaps possible to offer new insight into the most famous "animal poem" of the period, The Rime of the Ancient Mariner. The poem is revered because, like "Kubla Khan," it is supremely uninterpretable, or rather, over-interpretable. Most contempo rary readers have given up the search for a single and complete interpretation of the poem, arguing that the poem self-consciously confounds the very idea of singularity. The reading which most of us will find the least satisfactory is the one that is most obvious, the one that students will often turn to desperately as a way of giving meaning to the poem's inscrutable images. That is, the poem is to be understood as an elaborate and ornamental account of the wanton killing of an innocent and noble creature and the rightful (if extreme) punishment of the mariner for this act. The poem is to teach, as the prose gloss tells us, "love and reverence to all things that God made and loveth," a moral made equally explicit in the final stanzas: Farewell, farewell! but this I tell To thee, thou Wedding-Guest!</page><page sequence="18">18 Mosaic Volume 27/1 (March 1994) He prayeth well, who loveth well Both man and bird and beast. He prayeth best, who loveth best All things both great and small; For the dear God who loveth us, He made and loveth all. (11.610-17) The homily is unsatisfying because it seems utterly incommen surate with both the punishment the mariner endures for his crime of killing the bird, and with the self-consciousness of the poem's symbolism. Most of us, I think, either ignore these lines of the poem, or read them as a sign that the mariner has not yet grasped the full significance (even the horrifying sig nificance) of his story. The poem provokes us because of the ease with which we can convert the bird, and the apparently unmotivated act of killing it, into symbols for far larger and more profound themes, so that, for instance, the albatross becomes a symbol for Christ, or the act of killing it an act of defiant (and romantic) heroism; or that the poem as a whole becomes a deliberately uninterpretable object, the careful reading of which brings us vividly before the great irresolvable questions about the nature of sin and guilt and knowledge. In short, none of us would accept that the poem is in any sense an anti-hunting poem. And yet I would like to propose that it is possible to read the poem as an "animal" or anti-cruelty poem, one which allows us to take its proffered moral seriously. Indeed, it seems to me that the strangeness of the poem, its deliberate supernatural ness, can in part be taken as a strategy for making unfamiliar— and thereby allowing us to reconsider—a moral that would be found merely childish by the majority of its readers. Moreover, the supernatural aspects of the tale—the details of the voyage, the spirits which direct the ship and the punishments of the narrator—have the effect of blurring the boundaries between human and non-human in both directions of the traditional hierarchy. Thus the imagery of the poem throughout appears bent on making humans appear beast-like, and aspects of na ture appear conscious, or filled with spirit. The mariner's drive to tell his tale seems almost instinctive, and he is often de scribed as appearing beast-like and strange; he is called a "loon" (1.11) and is described as being "long, and lank and brown" (1.226) by the wedding-guest (who himself "beat[s] his</page><page sequence="19">Onno Dag Oerlemans 19 breast" attempting to break free of the hold of the tale). Like wise, his strange appearance frightens the Pilot and Hermit. The most dramatically strange and consistent feature of the poem is the degree to which nature is personified. Every aspect of nature—from the sun and moon and wind, to the ice and the currents—is inspirited, described as conscious entities who appear to choose to behave as they do. Examples abound: "The sun came up upon the left, / Out of the sea came he"(ll.25-26); "And now the storm-blast came, and he / Was tyrannous and strong; / He struck with his o'er-taking wings, / And chased us south along" (11.41-44), and so on. The poem is a tour de force indulgence of the so-called pathetic fallacy. That nature is imbued with spirit is made to seem an increasingly literal truth in the poem, the overwhelming effect of which is to make humanity appear frail and small. Another effect is to make less strange the idea of the spirited albatross, and its apparent con nection to the rest of nature (the sailors think it is responsible for the weather, a superstition which the poem makes terrify ingly real). Because the poem can make us believe that spirit is everywhere, we accept too that the mariner's blessing of the water-snakes is a significant moment, even if it does not end his punishment. At this point the poem makes literal the act of forgetting that it is attempting to enact on the reader; we are encouraged to suspend disbelief so that we may engage in the speculation that nature is spirit as humans are, and consequently bless, and find beauty in, all living things as the mariner does. The poem aims boldly to assert that human spirit is animal spirit, as implied too in the stunning moment when the spirits of the sailors seem to be transformed into birds: For when it dawned—they dropped their arms, And clustered round the mast; Sweet sounds rose slowly through their mouths, And from their bodies passed. Around, around, flew each sweet sound, Then darted to the Sun; Slowly the sounds came back again, Now mixed, now one by one. Sometimes a-dropping from the sky I heard the sky-lark sing;</page><page sequence="20">20 Mosaic Volume 27/1 (March 1994) Sometimes all little birds that are, How they seemed to fill the sea and air With their sweet jargoning! (11.350-62) By the end of the poem we are to believe, if only momentarily, that to kill an albatross is to kill a spirit, to offend all of nature. Even if this is an idea that will not survive the cold light of reason, the poem has perhaps made us unsure of the traditional distinctions between human and beast and angel, which may help us to understand nature not as culminating in human consciousness, but as filled with spirit and life. Coleridge conceived of his greatest contribution to Lyri cal Ballads as pursuing the same ends as those of his collaborator, which include conveying the "truth of nature," and "the loveliness and the wonders of the world before us" (qtd. in Jackson 314). In the poetry of Wordsworth, more than that of any other poet of the period we find animals represented as sympathetic beings, to be considered both as a means to an awareness of spirit in nature, and as sentient beings that are ends in themselves. As I have already noticed, in Book II of The Excursion Wordsworth matter-of-factly praises the Wanderer's recognition of the "rights" of animals. Although the possibility that animals had rights seems to extend natu rally from the pre-Revolutionary rhetoric of the rights of man and woman, it was a step taken by relatively few (including, most notably, Bentham). Indeed, most who wrote in favor of humane treatment of animals did so with the explicit premise that humans are far superior to animals, and that cruelty to animals needs to be avoided primarily because it reflects poorly on our moral supremacy. As far as I know, Wordsworth does not explicitly refer to "rights" of animals anywhere else in his prose or poetry. Yet the fact that he mentions it at all ought to alert us to the possibility that his love of nature includes a specific concern for animals, and is not immediately or prima rily an abstraction—a figure for a deity, or an antidote to (and thus an idea circumscribed by) culture. Much of Wordsworth's poetry about animals is not often read, probably because it can appear to be overly sentimental. Such is the case, for instance, with "The Pet Lamb: A Pas</page><page sequence="21">Onno Dag Oerlemans 21 toral," composed in 1800 and published in the edition of the Lyrical Ballads of that year. It records the poet's encounter with a young girl and her tethered pet lamb, whom she has just fed. The girl begins to leave the lamb, but is stopped by its plaintive cries. She turns back to the lamb with an expression so filled with beauty and compassion that the narrator imagines what she might say "If Nature to her tongue could measured numbers bring" (1.19). The device is awk ward and unusually artificial for a poet keen on representing the authenticity of the voice of others. Yet the poem fore grounds the act of the poet imagining the love of the child for its lamb, which is very like the child's imagined speculation on what ails the lamb. Poor creature, can it be That 'tis thy mother's heart which is working so in thee? Things that I know not of belike to thee are dear, And dreams of things which thou canst neither see nor hear. (11.49-52) Both the act of the poet and the child are a kind of anthropo morphism, the projection of spirit and feeling. But the child's love for the lamb is spontaneous and sincere, and in the context of Wordsworth's understanding of the holiness of childhood, is a sign of her spiritual ascendancy. She demonstrates a primal sympathy with nature that adults have lost, but which the poet regains through her. (In this sense, the poem is very like "An ecdote for Fathers," and "We are Seven," which attempt a similar recovery of childhood imagination.) Indeed, the child here serves to negate the possibility of mere projection. That children love and sense the "humanness" of animals is for Wordsworth the discovery of something that is real and fundamental, rather than a delusion of anthropomor phism (which is nonetheless how most adults react to children's feelings toward animals).That the child's sympathy is expressed through a love for a lamb will perhaps seem accidental, or will resonate as being primarily symbolic—the lamb of course rep resents Christian innocence and purity that the child shares. But to leap into the interpretive habits of adult consciousness is to miss the point in Wordsworth's poems about children. We have first to recognize the unself-consciousness of the child's behavior (even as we do so through the self-consciousness of</page><page sequence="22">22 Mosaic Volume 27/1 (March 1994) the adult narrator), which is evidence for the existence of a primal sympathy with the spirit of nature that grows dim with the development of self-consciousness. Such poems as "To a Butterfly" or "The Kitten and the Falling Leaves," represent a similar relation between children and animals. The most profound of these is of course "There Was a Boy," which poignantly juxtaposes an account of a boy who "Blew mimic hootings to the silent owls, / That they might answer him" (11.10-11 ), and the description of the poem's adult speaker standing mute over the grave of the boy. Hartman's classic reading of the poem emphasizes its figurativeness, how its two episodes display Wordsworth's memory of "the shock of self-consciousness" (Wordsworth's Poetry 22). Such a read ing perhaps leaps to the second paragraph too quickly, ignoring the uncanniness of the owls' "responsive" hooting. Their mim icry of the boy, and the silence which follows, have the effect of suddenly expanding the boy's awareness to the entire scene around him, and are palpable but haunting signs of a con sciousness in nature that is both like and unlike human being, what Hartman calls a recognition of "nature's...separate Iife"(20). The voice of the owls joins the "jocund din" of the boy's "mimic hootings" and the "redoubled" echoes, but it is not the same as the boy's voice—it is not mere mimicry or echoing. The nature that the boy perceives here is not a benign projec tion, infinitely yielding or comforting to human consciousness; instead it is at least partially different, other, and even indiffer ent. The boy's mind is impressed with the image of an "uncer tain heaven." More often though, Wordsworth's poems about animals de pict the narrator engaged directly in the activity of imagining the mind of an animal. The best of these is probably "The Green Linnet," though "To the Cuckoo" and "To a Skylark" are similar. Also notable are "Fidelity," "Incident Characteristic of a Favourite Dog" and "Tribute to the Memory of the Same Dog," which unabashedly celebrate the apparent humanity of specific dogs. The effect of these poems is to show that the act of sympathy to animal being is not a projection, but a natural and easy perception. A more substantial poem which makes a similar case for a biocentric sympathy is "Hart-Leap Well," composed and published in 1800. As in the case of The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, the relatively few critics who have</page><page sequence="23">Onno Dag Oerlemans/^o examined the poem in detail have converted its concern for the death of an animal almost instantly into a relatively abstract sympathy for nature. That is, it is read immediately as prima rily figurative, representing what Hartman calls "Wordsworth's animism, his consciousness of a consciousness in nature, [which] is the last novel superstition of a demythologized mind. All nature-spirits are dissolved by him except the spirit of Nature" ("False Themes" 296). This is no doubt true, but readings of the poem which convert its content to Wordsworth's general theory of nature ignore the fact that the poem is so aware of its figurativeness that we need to be wary of turning the poem into allegory or symbol. The poem is in part about the danger of creating symbols, of how art can be against nature. Indeed, "Hart-Leap Well" seems to me to be much like "Simon Lee," in the degree to which it aims to make the reader uncomfortable with the act of figuration. Although the earlier poem is also about a huntsman, "Hart-Leap Well" aims to inspire a profound sympathy for the hart. Like "Simon Lee," "Hart-Leap Well" begins confidently and jauntily in the ballad mode, so that the reader expects a celebration of the apparent heroism of Sir Walter's gallant hunt. He rides "with the slow motion of a summer's cloud," and mounts another horse, "the third / Which he had mounted on that glorious day" (11.2, 7-8). The hunt is a neat allegory for the narrative thrust of the ballad that Wordsworth exploits, in order to frustrate, in many of his Lyrical Ballads. That is, the end of the hunt is like the expected fulfillment of narrative, the climax that bestows a sense of completeness to the chase itself. The reader is drawn by the thrill of the hunt, and the "purpose" or moral of the tale, common to ballads. Yet by the fourth stanza the thrill and riotous excitement of the mass hunt has turned already into a solitary, and slightly ominous, pursuit. A rout this morning left Sir Walter's Hall, That as they galloped made the echoes roar; But horse and man are vanished, one and all; Such race, I think, was never seen before Where is the throng, the tumult of the race? The bugles that so joyfully were blown? This chase it looks not like an earthly chase; Sir Walter and the Hart are left alone. (11.13-16; 25-28)</page><page sequence="24">24 Mosaic Volume 27/1 (March 1994) The end of the hunt fails to deliver, both for the reader and Sir Walter. What began in joy has come down to the elemental final moments in which the hart must die. Oddly, and again like the narrator of "Simon Lee," the narrator here breaks in to announce that he will not describe how the hart dies, but says simply that "now the Knight beholds him lying dead" (1.30). Part of the reason for the omission is no doubt to allow Sir Walter to describe in his own words how the hart leapt to his death, so that his celebration of that fact will seem even more isolated, more his responsibility alone; in part too, there is an increasing reluc tance on the part of the narrator to share the game of the hunt, or its narrative, which breaks off completely in the second part. By the ninth stanza, Sir Walter alone searches for the proper and necessary conclusion to the hunt, which in an actual hunt was to be the killing of the stag by the dogs as the riders stood by (as in Stubbs's painting The Grosvenor Hunt), an act which was to bestow upon the whole process a meaning that went far beyond the single death of the hart. That Sir Walter is alone is one of his problems. By the mid-18th century, stag and fox hunting had become "conspicuous" (to borrow Veblen's sense of the word), and explicitly were not regarded as a mere means of putting meat on the table. Hunting (as opposed to "shoot ing") amounted to chasing dogs who were chasing game, and so was defined in terms of seeing the kill, and even more, by the hunter being seen as watching the kill. Hunting was a public gesture. As Deuchar explains, the country gentlemen who almost solely formed the hunting class sought to represent hunting as a sport that lent nobility to its participants, one that was not only connected to the historic recreation of kings, but also was virtuous because it was manly and vaguely martial (43-50). Moreover, it represented a kind of return to nature, was evidence of a vigorous relationship with the wilderness— much as Izaac Walton's Compleat Angler had argued for fish ing in the previous century. Hunting was an act of leisure which revealed the physical and spiritual health of the hunter, a man at the top of society who could yet easily descend to and return from an apparently primal activity. And yet part of this descent also involves an enactment of the supremacy of man over beast, and by extension, nature. There is, of course, an uneasiness here between the emphasis on the nobility of the sport and its primal aspects, which is reflected in part by the</page><page sequence="25">Onno Dag Oerlemans 25 very fact that, as we saw with Stubbs, paintings were commis sioned by hunters in order to lend to their activity the prestige and gloss of art. Hunting can easily be seen not as a return to nature, but an abuse of it, as yet another way in which man attempts to assert his domination over the natural world. Unlike the Stubbs paint ing, which is deliberately ambiguous about hunting, "Hart-Leap Well" is clearly a critique—the first part is a parody of hunting and the art which celebrates it. Sir Walter understands the hunt, and particularly the final great leap of the hart, as a sign of his power and supremacy. That the hart's final act was a great leap is not a sign of its vitality or desire to live, nor for a power or spirit in nature that exists independently of humankind, but is for the hunter a spectacle that might be used to signify the hunter's uniqueness: '"Till now / Such sight was never seen by human eyes'" (11.55-56). Thus Sir Walter celebrates having seen the kill by building an elaborately artificial "pleasure-house" and a "small arbour, made for rural joy," which are clearly to be monuments to himself and his pursuit of pleasure. We see in retrospect too that Sir Walter's treatment of his horses (the last of which is initially filled with joy, but is by the end a "dumb partner") and his dogs (who appear to die of exhaustion) foreshadow his ex ploitation of the natural world. Hunting as represented here is defined by the absence of sympathy for the being of animals in particular, and nature in general. It is a failure of sympathy and understanding, signified as well by the fact that Sir Walter thinks his monuments will last "Till the foundations of the mountains fail" (1.73). Unlike the Shepherd and the narrator-poet of the naturalistic second part of the poem, Sir Walter does not feel a connection through the animal to nature as a whole. The poet and Shepherd can easily connect the lifelessness of the site to the sympathy of a Being that is in the clouds and air, That is in the green leaves among the groves, Maintains a deep and reverential care For the unoffending creatures whom he loves. (11.165-68) These are the words of the Shepherd, the idealized example of one who lives within nature, and understands himself to be a part of it, in contrast to Sir Walter, who defines himself and his art against it. Put simply, the relationship between the Shepherd</page><page sequence="26">26 Mosaic Volume 27/1 (March 1994) and nature is reciprocal, while that of the knight is purely self-interested and exploitive. Unlike the hunter, the Shepherd can imagine specifically what might have driven the hart to return to the well, to make the great leap. Here on the grass perhaps asleep he sank, Lulled by the fountain in the summer-tide; This water was perhaps the first he drank When he had wandered from his mother's side. In April here beneath the flowering thorn He heard the birds their morning carols sing; And he, perhaps, for aught we know, was born Not half a furlong from that self-same spring. (11.149-56) This projecting of human consciousness onto the animal looks a lot like anthropomorphism, of course. Indeed, as John Hodgson argues, the "humanity" of the hart is underscored by the resem blance of its death to that of Herbert in The Borderers (77). But the force of the poem, the switch from parodied ballad to the more familiar and naturalistic mode of what Frederick Garber has aptly called the "poetry of encounter," and the contrast between the egotism of the knight and the self-effacing Shep herd, work to blur the distinction between projection and what we might call seeing naturally, and. finally, make the act of imagining the being of an animal a profoundly moral one. Wordsworth's critique is not a sentimental cry against cru elty to animals, but an assessment of hunting as an act of violence against nature, a failure of the imagination. A neat corollary of this is also a critique of ballad as stimulating that "degrading thirst after outrageous stimulation," that Wordsworth objects to in his Preface to Lyrical Ballads. As Andrew Griffin has argued for "Simon Lee," Wordsworth parodies the ballad form as a kind of narrative that appeals only to the immediate gratification of the reader's desire for sensory delight and ex plicitly delivered meaning (much like Sir Walter in the hunt). Wordsworth's aim in both poems is to turn narrative into some thing less pre-determined, a process of active sympathy which engages the complexity of another's consciousness. With its moral—"Never to blend our pleasure or our pride / With sor row of the meanest thing that feels" (11.178-80)—"Hart-Leap Well" is perhaps more explicit than "Simon Lee," because the call in the former poem to recognize the feeling of animals is</page><page sequence="27">Onno Dag Oerlemans 27 in itself a challenge to conventional anthropocentrism; it is also a challenge to enact a sympathy as complex and as self-effacing as that which the poet demonstrates for Simon Lee. Another ballad which might concern us here is Peter Bell, which tells of the moral reform of a (socially) humble and thought less man through his abuse of an animal. Summarized this way the poem of course reminds us of Coleridge's Rime. That this specific similarity has received little critical attention is surpris ing, since the unusual Prologue and mawkishly "humble" story of Peter Bell, together with the introductory letter to Southey in which Wordsworth explains that the poem was composed to show that "the Imagination...does not require for its exercise the intervention of supernatural agency," clearly make the poem a kind of reply to Coleridge. The poem has never been popular, of course, in part because it is too faithful to the ballad-form as Wordsworth understood it, and in part because it is too self-consciously a poem that aims for a naturalism opposed to Coleridge's super-naturalism. But while the poem is not particu larly subtle or complex, it is surely noteworthy that Peter Bell's villainy is exemplified by his repeated and explicit cruelty to an animal, and that his salvation is brought about by the example of sympathy and virtue provided by the faithful ass. Like "Hart-Leap Well," a natural sympathy is demonstrated as developing through a sympathy for animal being, and this sympathy does not simply reflect well on human character, but is part of an enlarged con ception of the proper arena of one's affections. Both poems attempt to personify a move out of mere egotism through a recognition not only that the individual self is not supreme and isolated, but that human consciousness in general is not supreme or isolated, that it is but a species of consciousness. I hope that by now what I have been rather blandly calling Wordsworth's "concern" for animals will be taken as more than merely a kind of pity. It is a complex sympathy that at once recognizes a deeply rooted commonality between humans and animals, and a respect for the individuality and even incomprehensibility of non-human consciousness. That his idea about animality is not a casual byproduct of his reverence for nature, but is an integral part of it, is further suggested by his long poem The White Doe of Rylstone. A full-length study of the poem is not warranted here, but it is worth trying to under stand both why Wordsworth thought the poem was "in conception,</page><page sequence="28">28 Mosaic Volume 27/1 (March 1994) the highest work he had ever produced," and how at the same time it demonstrates what he called the "Apotheosis of the Animal" (qtd. in de Selincourt 548, 547). The poem tells the story of the destruction of the Norton clan in an ill-fated rebellion against Elizabeth and the new Anglican church. As John Danby has noted, the story of the rebellion is subtly handled, capturing both the piety of Norton and its incongruity with his aim of starting a civil war to achieve this end (132-33). The story focuses on the passive resistance to his plan by two of his children, Emily and Francis, whose friendship and mutual support is the central bond of the poem. Indeed, it is Francis who, in a scene rife with Freudian implications, explains to Emily where her duty lies now that the rebellion is begun and the death of the entire family certain. Her task is simply to endure and to survive, to continue to live devoutly after Rylstone is destroyed. "If thou art beautiful, and youth And thought endue thee with all truth— Be strong;—be worthy of the grace Of God, and fill thy destined place: A Soul, by force of sorrows high, Uplifted to the purest sky Of undisturbed humanity!" (11.581-87) Through Emily, the poem celebrates the consolation of a wise indifference to fate, of a consciousness that finds its home in an immanent divinity that reveals the transitory nature of human history (particularly that of sectarian conflict). Like many of the animal poems I have examined, however, this one also flirts with mere sentimentality; the vehicle for the representation of Emily's awareness of what we might call the sympathy of nature is the doe, a pet of her brother's which does not finally return to the forest after the destruction of Rylstone as he had predicted (11.560-66), but which comes to Emily, and continues to visit the ruins after she dies. The appearance of the doe at the beginning and end of the poem suggests the pervading and enduring spirit of the animal, in contrast to the whirlwind events that destroy the male Nortons. The end of the poem insists on the naturalism of the encounter between Emily and the doe, even as it risks preciousness. The doe is not immediately to be taken as figurative, or rather, Emily is the</page><page sequence="29">Onno Dag Oerlemans 29 one who must interpret its presence, even as it becomes emblem atic of her docile stoicism. Wordsworth spends several hundred lines describing the new relationship between the doe and Emily, in which the doe replaces human companionship; the doe, al though an "inferior Creature" (1.1831), becomes almost human: she hath ventured now to read Of time, and place, and thought, and deed— Endless history that lies In her silent Follower's eyes; Who with a power like human reason Discerns the favourable season, Skilled to approach or to retire,— From looks conceiving her desire; From look, deportment, voice, or mien, That vary to the heart within. If she too passionately wreathed Her arms, or over-deeply breathed, Walked quick or slowly, every mood In its degree was understood; Then well may their accord be true, And kindliest intercourse ensue. (11.1714-29) In one sense, the consolation provided by the animal is simply that of a companion—Emily is, after all, utterly alone. But the doe also brings Emily to an Edenic consciousness in which she is attuned to the being of God everywhere, and takes satisfac tion in the immediate fullness of her "communication" (1.1829) with the doe. The doe is literally a "Presence" (1.1744) that speaks of the larger presence of god. The apotheosis of the animal in the poem culminates in the apparent alignment of Emily and the doe; both, in a sense, are raised from their ordinary state to one where they are attuned to an apparent unity of being, and which separates them from their own species. Everything is idealized at the end of this poem, which tries hardest of any of Wordsworth's works to find consolation in thoughts of "undisturbed mortality" (1.1858), and its naturalism will seem very forced to most readers. None theless, like the other poems I have examined, here an aware ness of animal being has the effect of countering the myopic view that humanity is alone among creatures important and sentient. Indeed, true sentience, for Wordsworth, includes foremost the ability to sense life beyond merely our own, and</page><page sequence="30">30 Mosaic Volume 27/1 (March 1994) for him doing so is not merely to anthropomorphize. Emily is consoled because this awareness at once makes her feel part of an apparently natural community, and diminishes the importance of merely human affairs. As Danby writes, "the Doe points to a super-harmony also into which the human must ultimately incorporate itself. Being is unitary" (142). While The White Doe of Rylstone is Wordsworth's most significant attempt to include a representation of the animal in a poem whose purpose is explicitly to counter a kind of anthropocentrism, it is probably not his most successful. Part of the problem is generic; few readers are likely to see the end of the poem as naturalistic because so much of the rest of the poem insists on being conventional historical tragedy. In contrast to the story of the Nortons, the end will no doubt seem saccharine. It may even seem escapist—we avoid human suffering, it sug gests, by turning to a celebration of a more innocent life. This does not mean, however, that the strain of biocentrism I see here, or in Romanticism generally, is a version of willed blind ness or misanthropy. Such biocentrism is based on enlarging one's sympathy, not undermining it with charges of anthropo morphism. The stark contrast between The White Doe's historic content and its nearly Utopian ending is perhaps better seen as a deliberate strategy, not unlike that of "Simon Lee," and "Hart-Leap Well," which also attempt to startle the reader into thought through the uneasy conflation of genres. Tragedy is relentlessly anthropocentric; fate and nature are hostile, and our only consolation lies in recognizing individual nobility, the supremacy of human achievement. The achieve ment of Wordsworth and the other poets and artists I have examined, I think, is to wrench us from this too familiar mode, and to make us recognize the wider boundaries of life. What the representation of animals in Romanticism suggests, too, is that the conception of nature by individual poets and artists is not entirely a cultural or intellectual construction, but can be seen to begin, and even end, in an awareness for palpably living beings that are not human. By undermining easy distinc tions between nature and culture, being and non-being, these artists suggest, furthermore, that it is not so much the cultural construction of nature but rather the construction of a concept of culture that has reified human being to the exclusion of all other life in nature.</page><page sequence="31">Onno Dag Oerlemans 31 WORKS CITED Bate, Jonathan.
