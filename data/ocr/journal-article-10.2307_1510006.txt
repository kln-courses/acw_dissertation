Rather, Augustine was unable at this point to conceive of a com- pletely incorporeal, spiritual being and therefore found the corporeal but nonanthropomorphic God of the Manichaeans quite attractive. Reply to Kim Paffenroth's Comment David L. Paulsen Brigham Young University Kim Paffenroth's comment on my article "Early Christian Belief in a Cor- poreal Deity: Origen and Augustine as Reluctant Witnesses" provides oc- casion to reinforce some points made in the article and to clarify some apparent misunderstandings.1 First, my claim about fourth-century Christians is more modest than Paffenroth has made out. For instance, he writes, "Paulsen attempted to show that Christians as late as the fourth century 'commonly (and perhaps generally) believed God to be corporeal"' (my emphasis). This is a misquo- tation. The larger passage from which he quotes actually reads as follows: "In this article I show that ordinary Christians for at least the first three centuries of the current era commonly (and perhaps generally) believed God to be corporeal" (my emphasis).2 Of fourth-century Christians, I make a much more limited claim, namely, "In his Confessions, St. Augustine 9See Gerard Watson, Saint Augustine. Soliloquies and Immortality of the Soul (Warminster: Aris &amp; Phillips, 1990) 12: "He [Augustine] had been told as a child that God was a spirit and therefore did not act as we with our bodies act.... Was there any reality other than body of some sort? It seemed the more honest course to go along with the Manichaean view that God is in some sense a body composed of fine and luminous matter.... It seemed to him more honest to think that 'anything not a body is nothing whatsoever.' This was the position which the Stoics and Epicureans had felt themselves forced to take against the 'spiritualism' of Plato and Aristotle six hundred years before." Notes to the reply: lTwo colleagues at Brigham Young University, Professor James Siebach and Dennis Potter, have contributed significantly to the preparation of this reply. 2David L. Paulsen, "Early Christian Belief in a Corporeal Deity: Origen and Augustine as Reluctant Witnesses," HTR 83 (1990) 105.</page><page sequence="2">236 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW provides substantial evidence that belief in a corporeal deity was still com- monly held at least in some Christian quarters as late as the fourth cen- tury" (my emphasis).3 The "Christian quarters" to which I refer is Augustine's own North Africa. Furthermore, I use the term "common" (and its cog- nates) in the sense of "not at all unusual." Thus the claim that a belief was "commonly" held is weaker than the claim that it was "generally" held. I use the term "corporeal" in its primary sense of "having a material body"; here, I use it even more restrictively, in the sense of having a material body, humanlike in form. Paffenroth apparently takes the term in its more inclusive sense of "material." Thus, correctly understood, my claim is that it was not at all unusual for Christians in the fourth century in North Africa at least to believe that God had a body which in form resembled those of human beings. Second, Paffenroth's claim that "it does not appear that anything in Augustine's writings would allow us to speculate that Christianity in the fourth century taught that God is corporeal" seems mistaken, that is, if he intends "Christianity" to include "Christians." Quite apart from the circum- stantial evidence I take from the Confessions, Paffenroth overlooks the direct evidence I draw from elsewhere in Augustine's writings. Since Paffenroth challenges my conclusion, it is necessary to rehearse the evi- dence cited more fully. In his Against the Epistle of Manichaeus called Fundamental (cited in my article in note 40 as C. epist. fund. 23.25), Augustine discusses "the carnal and weak of our faith, who, when they hear the members of the body used figuratively, as, when God's eyes or ears are spoken of, are accustomed, in the license of fancy, to picture God to themselves in a human form" (my emphasis). Although Augustine finds these Christians' belief that God has "a human form which is the most excellent of its kind" laughable, he nonetheless finds it more "allowable" and "respectable" than the Manichaean alternative. Moreover, Augustine says that these "carnal" Christians, unlike the Manichaeans, are educable and with proper instruc- tion in the Church may gradually come "to understand spiritually the fig- ures and parables of the scriptures." Furthermore, in his De Haeresibus (also cited in note 40), Augustine provides a catalogue of heretical Christian communities or sects.4 In chap- 3Ibid., 114. 4See Liguori G. Muller, The De Haeresibus of Saint Augustine: A Translation With An Introduction and Commentary (Washington, DC: Catholic University of America Press, 1956). Muller says (p. 50), "It becomes evident immediately in the De haeresibus that Augustine envisioned a heresy as a concrete sect, not a heretical proposition, since he speaks of the individual members of the sect rather than of the tenets they hold."</page><page sequence="3">NOTES AND OBSERVATIONS 237 ter fifty, he identifies two5 contemporary Christian communities who taught specifically that God is embodied in humanlike form. Members of the first community were called Audiani (sometimes Vadiani), were followers of a Christian deacon, Audius of Edessa, and were located primarily in Syria and Mesopotamia. Members of the second community were called "the Anthropomorphites" and were located in Egypt. John Cassian corroborates Augustine's testimony with respect to Egyptian anthropomorphism. Indeed, Cassian gives us reason to believe that for fourth-century Egyptian monks, anthropomorphism was the norm rather than the exception.6 According to Cassian, in 399 when Theophilus, bishop of Alexandria, sent a letter to the Egyptian churches to set the dates of Lent and Easter, he included a con- demnation of anthropomorphism. Cassian reports that this was received very bitterly by almost every sort of monk through- out all Egypt .... The majority of the older men among the brethren asserted that in fact the bishop was. .. corrupted by the most serious heresy,. . . someone who denied that almighty God was of human shape-and this despite the clear scriptural evidence that Adam was created in His image. (my emphasis)7 Even the monks in Scete "who were far ahead of all the [other] Egyptian monks in perfection and knowledge" and all the priests except Paphnutius- an Origenist-denounced the bishop's letter. To Sarapion,8 Cassian reports, the concept of a nonembodied God "seemed new-fangled.... It was some- thing unknown to his predecessors and not taught by them" (my empha- sis).9 5Augustine apparently thought there was only one group, identifying the Audiani with the Egyptian anthropomorphites. See ibid., 178 n. 7. 6Otto Meinardus (Monks and Monasteries of the Egyptian Deserts [rev. ed.; Cairo: Ameri- can University in Cairo Press, 1989] 53) asserts that "the anthropomorphite heresy was so widespread that the anthropomorphists appear to have outnumbered the liberal party [the Origenists who preferred allegorical to literal interpretations of the scriptures] by at least three to one." 7John Cassian Conferences (trans. Colm Luibheid; Classics of Western Spirituality; New York: Paulist, 1985) 10.2 (pp. 125-26). 8See Paulsen, "Corporeal Deity," n. 41 and accompanying text. 9Cassian Conferences, 10.3 (pp. 126-27). In his biography of Cassian, Owen Chadwick claims that Cassian downplays the resoluteness of Egyptian resistance to Theophilus's con- demnation of anthropomorphism. He says (John Cassian [2d ed.; Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1968] 28-29), "The consequent events we can trace, though obscurely, in Sozomen, Socrates, Palladius and the letters of Jerome. Were Cassian the sole authority, the impression would be left that, despite the fierce opposition of great numbers, the decrees of Theophilus were ultimately accepted by the Egyptians. We hear nothing in Cassian of the riots in Alexandria, of the bishop's submission, of the explusion of Origenism."</page><page sequence="4">238 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW Finally, Augustine also provides evidence that fourth-century Christian anthropomorphism was not confined to monks and laity. For instance, in "A memorandum to his holy brother, Fortunatianus," (Epistula 148) Augus- tine discusses a brother bishop, not named, who was teaching that we are able, or at least will be able after the resurrection, to see God with our physical eyes. In a prior letter, without mentioning the bishop by name, Augustine had sharply rebuked those who held this view, and the bishop had been offended. Augustine seeks Fortunatianus's intercession on his be- half in seeking the bishop's forgiveness and in effecting reconciliation. Nonetheless, apart from the letter's tone, Augustine says he has no regrets in having written it. His intent was to "prevent the belief that God is Himself corporeal or visible in any locality or space relation-for the eye of this body can see in no other way-and also to prevent the expression, 'face to face,' from being taken to mean that God is limited by the parts of a body" (my emphasis). Thereupon, Augustine argues at length (about fif- teen pages in my text) against the bishop's view. This would certainly be inordinate concern for one unacquainted with any Christians contemporary with himself who taught that God is embodied. In sum, Augustine was aware of fourth-century Christians who taught that God is corporeal, and the evidence that he was aware of it is drawn from his own writings. Third, Paffenroth takes me to task for a problematic depiction of the Manichaean alternative, quoting me: "At first, unable to accept Christianity because of (what he took to be) its doctrine of a corporeal deity, Augustine was much attracted to the Manichaean sect."'0 From this quotation he con- cludes, "This statement seems to imply that the alternative before the young Augustine was between a corporeal, Christian God and an incorporeal, Manichaean God. ... Of course, the Manichaean concept of God was highly material/corporeal." Paffenroth is right about the materiality of the Manichaean God, but this I did not intend-even implicitly-to deny. The misunderstanding here arises out of our using the term "corporeal" in two different senses. In the sentence he quotes from me as well as throughout my article, I use the term to refer to a material body humanlike in form, while he simply uses the term synonymously with "material" (see above). As young Augustine saw it, his option was between a Christian God with a humanlike body and a nonanthropomorphic yet still material Manichaean God. Finally, what evidence can we credibly draw from the Confessions re- garding fourth-century Christian belief in an embodied deity? That young Augustine believed that Christians held this view, and not merely (or even '?Paulsen, "Corporeal Deity," 114.</page><page sequence="5">NOTES AND OBSERVATIONS 239 especially) in the context of the Incarnation," seems beyond dispute. The only point at issue is where he got this impression. Possibilities include: (1) from Christians with whom he was acquainted; (2) from Christian scrip- tures (especially passages from the Hebrew Bible, including Gen 1:26-27) literally construed; and (3) from misrepresenting Manichaeans intent on discrediting the Christian faith. Paffenroth apparently opts for the third possibility. I say all of the above; except that, in light of all the evidence presented, it is by no means clear the extent to which the Manichaean detractors misrepresented Christian belief. 1 According to Augustine's own account, the scriptural warrant for Christian belief in divine embodiment was largely found in the Hebrew Bible and hence was not based upon the Incarnation. For instance, in the Confessions, Augustine reveals that it was only after he met Ambrose in Milan that he understood that "the text concerning man being made by you in your image (Gen 1:26) not to mean that they [Christian Neoplatonists] believed and thought you to be bounded by the form of a human body" (Augustine Confessions 6.3.4; see also 5.14.24). In addition, Augustine wrote Epistula 148 (see above p. 238) to prevent a fellow bishop from taking literally passages where prophets from the Hebrew Bible report face-to- face encounters with God. See Gen 32:30 ("I have seen God face to face"); Exod 33:11 ("the Lord used to speak to Moses face to face"); see also 1 Cor 13:12. Finally, the Christian anthropomorphites to whom Augustine refers in Contra epistolam quam vocantfundamenti (see above) find their scriptural warrant not in accounts of the Incarnation, but in scriptural references to the parts of God's body-eyes, ears, and so forth.</page></plain_text>
