<plain_text><page sequence="1">RESPONSE Janet Martin Soskice I find myself to be so much in agreement with Tim Jenkin's article that there is little I can say by way of a critical response, other than to thank him for the care which he has taken with my arguments in Metaphor and Religious</page><page sequence="2">240 METAPHOR AND RELIGIOUS LANGUAGE Language and applaud him for developing some of those in new and interesting ways. I was particularly interested in his development of the two levels of the referential process which I differentiated as 'the initial one in which sense does circumscribe the denotation of a term in a language, and the secondary one at which a term with a specificable sense can be used by speakers or a community of speakers to refer to states and relations we only partially understand.' (Metaphor and Religious Language, p. 124). He is right to seize on this distinction for it is at the heart of what makes metaphor possible and indeed, at the heart of all language use. Metaphor, as he rightly points out, is concerned with singularity, yet we must express singularity with terms held in common. This is one of the most important paradoxes his paper describes, 'that language needs to be formal in order to establish the possibility of communication, and yet that formalism continually must break down in order that anything worth saying—in other words, about "the world as it is"—may be said. Definition underwrites reference, and reference undermines definition' (Tim Jenkins, p. 230). It is this mobility which is of the essence to religious language, and to metaphor therein; traditional terminologies facilitate reference or access, yet the new referential occasion and the new context of the community using the language subverts, or undermines definition at the same time. Tim Jenkins is quite right to suggest (p. 226) that to understand how Christians speak of God we must look to the believing community. In this respect, I was surprised that he did not put more emphasis on the final chapter of the book. Admittedly this concerns our talk of God, not his main interest, but it is also there that I try to point, embryonically, to a social theory of referring and knowing akin to the position for which he seems to argue. In particular in the last pages where I use the example of Japanese court poetry, and one of Donne's poems to show the complexity of religious metaphor and how very inadequate it must be to regard metaphors as redescribing 'things'. It is this final chapter which I take as my defense against the stasis of which he accuses me in the arguments on reference and theory construction. I am more than aware that there is not a single object called 'language', or Wittgensteinianly, that language has not just one use. Similarly, as I point out, the purpose of discussing realism and reference in scientific theory construction is not to say that theology is just like science, or a subvariant of it. Nor would a realism appropriate to scientific theory be desirable or even useful to theology—there may, however, be useful analogues. There are different sorts of discourse even within the language of science—the language of theory construction and the language of practical science, for instance. For the most part practising science aims at a stasis which would be</page><page sequence="3">TIMOTHY JENKINS 241 undesirable in religious language. For practical science it can be vital that 'the real' is reasonably static, or if you prefer, that our access to the real is reasonably static. It may be the case that in many of the most interesting examples 'The real is not simply static, literal, fit for description, but has an aspect that is in fact mobile, creative, indistinct and proliferating' (p. 239) but there are also cases where one wishes just to say that which is the case in the least ambiguous and most stable way possible. For example, even the most outre French philosopher of language might want to know exactly which staphyloccocal infection was threatening the life of her newborn baby, and exactly which antibiotic would knock the infection on the head. Precision is what we want from the language here. Just as literalism ought not be the enemy of figuration, so Heraclitan semantics should not be the enemy of actual linguistic accuracy in contexts where that is what we want language to do. There is one final difference in Mr. Jenkins approach and my own which may be just a difference of expression, or may be something more. I am particularly concerned to emphasise the social character of language, almost a truism but, alas, readily overlooked. In particular I stress, with Putnam and over and against the traditional theories, that it is not words which refer but speakers using words who refer. This is why I prefer to speak of a social, rather than causal, theory of reference; language is social, reference is social, knowledge is social—even our knowledge of God. That it is not words, but speakers who refer is, as I have said, what makes metaphor work, and intimately involved with the distinction of the two levels of reference outlined above. Language makes sense, has meaning, in human life. To paraphrase, it is not language which means, but people using language who mean. It is true that language is to a great extent independent of each of us, but language is not independent of the human condition in toto. Metaphors, words, meanings, only are such because of their place in human life. For this reason I am chary of the anthropomorphic language which Mr. Jenkins uses when expounding Deleuze, for example in speaking of metaphor as the paradoxical element which 'circulates', 'glides' and 'produces' meaning or of the 'life' of the signifier which 'threatens' signification, 'draws' the interlocu tors into its movements, etc. This way of speaking, quite common amongst some contemporary critics and reminiscent of the 'word magic' approach of some of the theologians, seems to me in danger of suggesting the same spurious autonomy of language over and against the world of language users as do some of the traditional theories. In both one can sometimes get the impressions that language is a semiotic system, or an agent, entirely independent of the human world where people eat, drink, fall in love and so on, and this is both to me both linguistically and theologically unacceptable. But this may be a cavil.</page></plain_text>
