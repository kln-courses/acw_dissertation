<plain_text><page sequence="1">IsMEO ACTIVITIES 1979 has been a year of readjustment for IsMEO, following upon the various changes that have taken place within the institute itself, as well as those affecting its legal status. Prof. Sabatino Moscati, who in 1978 succeeded Prof. Giuseppe Tucci as president of IsMEO, was unfortunately compelled to resign on account of poor health. In his place the Board of Directors elected Prof. Gherardo Gnoli, Professor of Iranian Philology at the Istituto Universitario Orientale of Naples and former Rector of the same univer? sity, who had been Vice-President to Prof. Mo? scati, while Prof. Lionello Lanciotti, who holds the chair of Chinese Language and Literature at the Istituto Universitario Orientale, was appointed as the new Vice-President. Prof. Tucci, as Honorary President of IsMEO, has continued to take an active interest in the affairs of the Institute. As well as continuing as Editor of East and West, he is also General Editor of all the publications of IsMEO. After being awarded the Jawaharlal Nehru Award for International Understanding in 1978, this year Prof. Tucci was honoured by the award of the Balzan Prize for history, as a tribute to his work in the field of historical research on the Eurasian continent. In honour of Prof. Tucci, IsMEO arranged a meeting in which friends and colleagues paid tribute to him for his long and fruitful scientific activity, which he still carries on indefatigably (fig. 1). Speakers on this occasion included Prof. Sabatino Moscati, then President of IsMEO, H.E. the Ambassador Enrico Cerulli, Vice-President of the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei, the Minister Sergio Romano, Director General for Scientific and Technical Cooperation, Dr Gilberto Bernabei and Prof. Gherardo Gnoli Vice-Presidents of IsMEO, and Prof. Antonio Gargano, General Secretary of the Institute. In 1979 the special government committee that was appointed to examine the real usefulness of all the public bodies in Italy recognized IsMEO as an "Organization of considerable importance", amongst those already included in the Act 70/75. In view of the increase in the costs of the administration and the activities of the Institute, the Cabinet, in its session held on 14th December, passed a bill to increase substantially the govern? ment contribution from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The bill is expected to become law in 1980. Grants were obtained, in particular for the archaeological and restoration campaigns and foi publications, from the Ministry of Education (50 million lire), the Ministry of Cultural Heritage (16 million lire) and from the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR) (40 million lire). During 1979 IsMEO drew up two agreements, with the CNR and the Istituto Universitario Orientale of Naples, concerning respectively his? torical and philological studies and archaeological activities. It is expected that they will come into force in 1980. Cultural activities: Lectures, Missions, Conferences In spite of the economic difficulties in which IsMEO has found itself this year, its cultural activities have continued successfully in various sectors. In November a seminar, organized by the Indian Embassy, was held at IsMEO as a tribute to the memory of Mahatma Gandhi. The Indian Ambassador, His Excellency A.K. Damodaran, and the President of IsMEO took part in the seminar, together with four Indian scholars who spoke on Mahatma Gandhi (fig. 2). Under the auspices of the Centre for Sinological Research of IsMEO and the Italian Association for Chinese Studies (AISC), a conference was held in December on "La Cina a sessant'anni dal Movi mento del 4 maggio, analisi critica e bilancio della trasformazione politica, sociale e culturale". The conference was attended by more than 120 scholars from Italian universities. Nineteen papers were read on various aspects of the political, social and cultural transformation of China in the last sixty years. The papers will be published in vol. 16 of Cina. The sessions of the conference were also attended by diplomats from the Embassy of the People's Republic of China in Italy. The President of IsMEO, Prof. Gherardo Gnoli, together with Prof. Raniero Gnoli, Pro? fessor of Indology in the University of Rome, and Prof. Maurizio Taddei, Professor of Indian Archaeology and Art History at the Istituto Uni? versitario Orientale of Naples, visited India, Nepal and Pakistan in Decembre 1979-January 1980 for the purpose of contacting local authorities and institutions about drawing up new cultural agree? ments in various sectors. The aims of the visit had previously been determined in talks held with Prof. Tucci and experts in the several fields. In Nepal, IsMEO was granted permission by the authorities to send experts to carry out a preliminary survey. The purpose of the survey will be to investigate the possibility of conducting archaeological and restoration campaigns, with special reference to the Kathmandu Valley. The 293</page><page sequence="2">initial research will eventually be extended to include historical and epigraphic studies. In India meetings were arranged with the Institute of Indian Culture, the Embassy, and with Indian authorities in order to examine the possibility of establishing a branch of IsMEO in India, to serve as headquarters for the Institute's research work as well as being of use to other scholars and students visiting India. Discussions were also held with the Indian government body responsible for the Nehru Prize awards concerning Prof. Tucci's desire to employ the sum of money awarded to him for the publishing of Sanskrit manuscripts, which he has requested be carried out by the University of Shantiniketan. An arrangement was made with the Italian Embassy in India concerning the opportuneness of the President of IsMEO being included in the committee that is to meet in the near future to draw up a cultural agreement between Italy and India. The President and Prof. Raniero Gnoli made a short visit to Benares, where they had the opportunity of meeting the Maharajah of that city, who is keenly interested in Puranic literature and promotes studies and publications through the All India Kashiraj Trust. The Maharajah ex? pressed a desire for future cooperation between the Trust and IsMEO, that could also be facilitated by the fact that the Trust counts among its members Dr Giorgio Bonazzoli, an Italian scholar of ancient texts. In Pakistan permission was obtained from the local authorities for an archaeological survey in the Darel valley, to which access is usually forbidden on account of its being a military area. An agreement was also reached with the Archae? ological Department of Pakistan about the terms of the request which is to be made by the Pakistani authorities to the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs for IsMEO's cooperation in the restoration project at the archaeological site of Saidu Sharif. The friendly talks that were had with the Pakistani authorities competent in the field of archaeology and restoration made it clear that great interest is taken in IsMEO's activities in Pakistan, which in 1980 will have been taking place for 25 years. Visitors to IsMEO During the year several visits were made to IsMEO by personalities from political and cultural circles abroad. Of particular importance was the visit in October of a delegation composed of four Chinese archaeologists and an interpreter, who were the guests of the Italian government and of cultural and scientific organizations. The delegation was led by Dr Lu Zhaoyin, who specializes in research on the Han-Tang period and is the editor of the journal Kaogu. He was accompanied by Dr Wang Shimin, Head Librarian of the Library and Archives of the Institute of Archaeology of the Academy of Social Sciences, Dr Yang Xizhang, Vice-Director of the laboratory of radiological and chemical analysis of the same Institute. IsMEO organized a round-table conference in the hall of the Museo Nazionale d'Arte Orientale, with the participation of Italian scholars (fig. 3). The meeting gave rise to an interesting exchange of experience and the possibility of future collaboration between Italy and China in the field of archaeology was taken into consideration. IsMEO welcomed on separate occasions two Indian Foreign Ministers: in April Mr A.B. Vajpaee, who was presented with publications of IsMEO to be placed in the library of the Indian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and in October Mr S.N. Mishra (fig. 4), who was accompanied on his visit by the Indian Ambassador and who expressed great interest in the various spheres of the Institute's activities, especially its publi? cations, restorations and archaeological excavations. The Chinese delegation, in Italy for the meeting of the Italo-Chinese committee to draw up the cultural agreement between the two countries, paid a visit to IsMEO in October. Its members were favourably impressed by the In? stitute's desire to work together with Chinese cultural organizations as part of the aforesaid agreement. In October IsMEO also welcomed a delegation of Chinese journalists composed of the director of the Xin Hua (New China) Agency, Mr Mu Qing, who was accompanied by two journalists from the Peking office, Mr Sun Zhen and Mr Liu Xian Wen, and an interpreter. The delegation was joined by the director of the Xin Hua in Italy, Mr Tan Tai-Sheng. The Vice-President of IsMEO, Prof. Lionello Lanciotti, who is also co-director of the Centro di Ricerche Sinologiche of IsMEO, welcomed the guests and spoke to them of the Institute's activities. Another visitor to IsMEO was Prof. Karl Jettmar, Professor of Ethnology at the University of Heidelberg. Prof. Jettmar had talks with Prof. Giuseppe Tucci, Prof. Gherardo Gnoli, Prof. Luciano Petech and Dr Patrizia Zolese about his historico-archaeological research in Pakistan, whose results coincide with those of Prof. Tucci's studies on the Dards, published in East and West. 294</page><page sequence="3">Archaeology and Restoration The archaeological and restoration missions of IsMEO were able to continue in full force in Pakistan only, whereas work necessarily slackened in Iran and came to a complete standstill in Afghanistan on account of the turn of events in those countries. The members of the missions in Afghanistan have carried on their study of the material resulting from previous campaigns, for publication in East and West. The excavation campaigns of the Centro Studi e Scavi Archeologici of IsMEO, of which a brief survey is given below, were carried out with the cooperation of, and a grant from, the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche. Archaeological Mission in Pakistan The Italian Archaeological Mission conducted excavations at three different sites in the Sw?t District, Loebanr, Aligr?ma and Saidu Sharif, in the period August-November 1979. Loebanr III The excavation at Loebanr III, led by Prof. Giorgio Stacul, with the participation of Mr Mohammad Mehrban of the Archaeological De? partment of Pakistan, was carried out near the areas that had been excavated in 1968 (see EW\ XXVI, 1976, pp. 13-30) and 1976 (see EW, XXVII, 1977, pp. 227-253). The excavation consisted in Trench F (12 X 5 m.), Trench G (12 X 8 m.) and Trench H (13 X 7 m.). Some dwelling and storage pits were revealed, similar to those excavated in previous years and ascribed to the cultural period IV in the Ghaligai sequence (c. 1700-1400 B.C.). Some of the pits intersected one another (fig. 7). Post-holes were located around them (fig. 6). The filling of almost all the pits contained fragments of daub with stake-impressions on one side (fig. 8). Of particular interest was the excavation of Trench H. Here seven shallow pits were located, some of them with a stone-walled room built over them (fig. 5). The two occupation layers belong to the same cultural period. Some small pits, biconical in shape, were almost completely filled with earth mixed with ashes. On the bottom of these pits fragments of large storage-jars were recovered. The pottery consisted of grey to brown gritty ware, black to grey burnished ware, and black-on red painted ware. Some pottery types ascribed to the latest phase, connected with the stone-walled structures, are peculiar to this phase only. As in the previous excavation (1976), terracotta figurines representing the humped bull were recovered at the bottom of some pits. Copper objects were also found. An incised potter's mark can be clearly recognized on a fragment of a red bowl (fig. 9). Loebanr II About 200 m. west of the aforementioned area, on a flat-topped hill opposite Loebanr III, some exploratory excavations were made near the graveyard of Loebanr II (on this site see EW, XXVI, 1976, p. 13). Here stone-walled structures and occupation layers ascribed to Period VII (4th century B.C.) were revealed. The finds included two terracotta human figurines. Struc? tural remains ascribable to this period had so far been discovered at Bir-k?t-ghundai only (EW, XXVIII, 1978, pp. 148, 150). Aligr?ma Excavations were conducted at the protohistoric site of Aligr?ma in September-October 1979 under the leadership of Mrs Patrizia Zolese, with the participation of Mr Mauro Cucarzi from the Institute of Geophysics of the University of Trieste, who carried out electromagnetic prospec? ting at the site. The Archaeological Department of Pakistan was represented by Mr Aftab Ahmed Khan. The dig was extended in the northeastern zone of the main part of the site, that had been ex? cavated in the 1972-76 campaigns. This peripheral area yielded interesting evidence on the expansion of the village, and on its occupation in the various periods. Trenches O and P, that had been begun in the previous year, were widened, and Trenches Q and R were begun, so that the total area covered 100 sq. m. Three different phases were identified: 1) a phase corresponding to the burials (4th century B.C.), and 2) two building phases, one immediately on top of the other, that correspond respectively to Periods IV and V of the Sw?t valley chrono? logical sequence (9th-5th centuries B.C.). In Trench O were discovered two graves that gave evidence of two different types of funerary rites being observed in the same period (fig. 10). Grave 18 is a simple inhumation, whereas grave 17 is a cremation burial in a square stone cist grave, made out of four large stones. Both graves lie on top of structures that form small dwellings, in which a large number of pottery finds were made (figs. 11, 12). In Trenches P and Q the structures and the finds belong to Period VI only, there being a total absence of the burial phase. 295</page><page sequence="4">In Trench R (5 X 5 m.), under remains of walls belonging to Period VI, there came to light a beaten earth floor with which was associated with material belonging to Period V, including a fragment of an anthropomorphic statuette dec? orated with an incised pattern (fig. 13). During the excavation, earth samples were taken for the purpose of botanical research, which is now under way. A detailed electromagnetic survey was carried out in some parts of the graveyard. Saidu Sharif I, Monastery The second excavation campaign in the Mon? astery at the archaeological site of Saidu Sharif I (Sw?t) took place in October-November 1979. The work was directed by Dr Domenico Faccenna, with the assistance of the field supervisors Dr Pierfrancesco Callieri and Dr Francesco Noci and the draughtsman Mr Giusto Almerigogna. The team enjoyed the collaboration of Mr Mohammad Mehrban, who represented the Archaeological Department of Pakistan. The excavation that had been begun in 1977 (EW, XXVII, 1977, pp. 460-63) was continued as follows: 1) excavation of the rest of the Mon? astery; 2) excavation of the southern part of the area to the west of the Monastery; 3) excavation of the area to the south and the southern part of the area to the east of the Monastery. The Monastery (fig. 14) was built on a rectangular ground-plan (N side 38 m.; S side 37.80 m.; E side 32 m.; W side 32 m.) with two rows of cells on the E and W sides, whereas there are no buildings on the N and S sides. A corridor runs along all four sides, in front of the cells to east and west and in front of the outer wall to north and south. This corridor is bordered by a socle that supported a colonnade, as is shown by the preservation of some schist slabs that served as bases to the columns, undoubtedly wooden ones. Up against this socle there is a low, narrow wall bordering the courtyard area which lies 0.40 m. below the level of the corridor. In the SE corner of the courtyard there is a platform (2.90 X 2.80 m.) built of stone slabs with a border of small slabs placed on edge (fig. 15). A gutter runs southwards along the W side of this platform. The area inside the Monastery is c. 3 m. higher than the level of the Sacred Area. The two levels are connected by a double flight of steps rising against the western sustaining wall and converging in the centre (fig. 16), where access is gained to the portico and courtyard of the Monastery by passing through a room which is larger than the cells. During this campaign the group of structures built on to the outer southern side of the Mon? astery (fig. 17) and communicating with it by means of doors, proved to be particularly interesting. Very little is left of the complex, which was bounded by the terrace edge, this having been deeply cut into by the khwar and carried away by run-off and landslides due to the erosion of the slope. A similar state of preservation is seen in some other structures that were brought to light on the southernmost part of the eastern side. These include drainage-channels and paved passage-ways that communicate with the Monastery through a door in ER7 which was later walled up (fig. 18). The structures obviously underwent alterations which involved the building of new walls, the walling-up of doors, and the continuous raising of the level of beaten earth floors, which some? times had basins or fireplaces made in them. The Monastery is thus seen to have had a long and eventful life which did not even come to an end when a large part of it had been abandoned and had fallen into ruins, as is evidenced by some traces of occupation. Some trial-trenches that were dug for the purpose of finding out the profile of the terrain on which the Monastery stands gave interesting results. It was discovered that the Monastery was built on a terrace that was formed by levelling off part of the hillside. The levelled top of this terrace forms the ground-level of the inner court? yard, while around it, at least on the S and W sides, an arrangement of sustaining walls was built on to the terrace sides, so as to form the ground on which the outer structures stood (fig. 19). Another interesting discovery was that of two graves (one of which is shown in fig. 20) that had been dug in the natural soil beneath the layers related to the Monastery. These graves, together with other bone fragments that have been found frequently in the foundation trenches of the Monastery, lead to the supposition that the area on which the Monastery stands, and undoubtedly the Sacred Area as well, may have been occupied by a protohistoric graveyard. The finds made in the excavation of the Mon? astery, besides the pottery which was mostly in a very fragmentary state, consisted in iron objects that were used to join the wooden structures together (nails, clamps, grapplings, hooks, etc.) (fig. 25), stone objects (discs, grindstones, pestles), terracotta and carnelian beads, sea-shell bangles, copper and iron pins (fig. 26) and iron arrow-heads (fig. 27). The copper objects include, in particular, a pendant (S 2087) (fig. 21) and a lotus-blossom (S 2146) (fig. 22), the latter having been discovered 296</page><page sequence="5">Fig. 1 - Prof. Giuseppe Tucci addresses friends and colleagues at the meeting held in his honour.

Also noteworthy is an unbaked clay moulding of a hunter facing a bird (S 2129) (fig. 23), and a globular vase coated with unbaked clay (S 2098) (fig. 24). The coins, like those discovered in the previous campaigns, are ascribable to Kaniska, Huviska and V?sudeva-type (fig. 28). The finds were inventoried continuing the previous numbering. The inventory nos. of the present campaign go from S 1987 to S 2159, 173 objects in all. On account of the structures that are falling into ruin, particularly on the W side with the large sustaining wall and the walls of the cells built on it, and also on account of the continual erosion of the terrace slopes to S and E, the monument is in a very precarious state and is consequently in urgent need of conservation. To this end a project for the restoration of the present archaeological area (Sacred Area and Mon? astery) is being considered by the Italian Archae? ological Mission, in agreement with the Archae? ological Department of Pakistan. Restoration Mission in Iran In consequence of the political situation which had already begun to take shape towards the end of 1978 and which came to a climax in January-February 1979, official relations between IsMEO and the Iranian authorities in charge of the protection of monuments have inevitably been interrupted. Nevertheless, upon learning that repair work had begun again at some sites, particularly in the religious buildings, IsMEO, with the collab? oration of the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, felt bound to send some of its experts on the spot, with a twofold aim: namely, to resume contacts with the authorities and the technical offices in charge of preservation, and to find out the extent and the quality of the repairs that had been undertaken in our absence under direct local control. Prof. G. Tilia's first exploratory mission to Tehran and Persepolis from 9th March to 9th May 1979 was followed by a second one which lasted from 23rd June to 23rd August, with most of the the time being spent in Tehran. Prof. Tilia was constantly in contact with the new technical administration that was established after the dissolution of the Ministry of Culture and Arts, with a view to examining the possibility of IsMEO's resuming its advisory activities. A third mission was conducted by the architect E. Galdieri, co-ordinator of the whole restoration programme. This mission had two distinct aspects. The first was mainly of a political nature, through meetings with the Iranian authorities (especially with the Under-secretary for Culture and the Director of the Organization for the preservation of historical monuments), with the Italian diplo? matic staff, and with some workers' committees involved in the restoration work that had been entrusted to us in the past. The second aspect was essentially of a technical and scientific nature and involved checking the work being done on some sites, particularly in the Masgid-i Gumca at Isfahan, as well as gathering further information for the study of the different episodes of con? struction in the historic building and for the drawing up of the third interim report on the restoration and consolidation work that has been done in the last five years. Upon completion of the three aforesaid missions, we have reason to believe that the regular continuation of our collaboration in an advisory capacity and our research in the field of the restoration of monuments is not only desirable from our point of view but is also looked forward to by the Iranian authorities and skilled workers. During his stay at Isfahan, E. Galdieri was invited, as in December 1978, to give a brief course of lectures on the consolidation of ancient buildings at the local branch of the Farabi University, the only one in Iran that gives scope to the problems of restoration. The Iranian authorities in charge of the preser? vation of monuments, in spite of financial diffi? culties in this field, have had translated into Farsi the latest volume published by IsMEO - Centro Restauri (E. Galdieri, Esfah?n: cAli Q?p?; an architectural survey, Rome, 1979) and are about to bring out an edition in Modern Persian. Restoration Mission in Afghanistan On account of the political situation in Afghanistan, IsMEO was compelled to cancel the programme which the restoration mission at Ghazni had planned for 1979. The programme consisted in going ahead with the survey, in the checking of the static conditions and the consoli? dation of the minaret of Bahram Shah, and in the continuation of the construction of the new archaeological museum that is being built over the last few years. The aforesaid situation, as well as bureaucratic difficulties, made it impossible even to purchase the necessary materials for 297</page><page sequence="14">completing and putting into function the first six units of the museum. It is to be hoped that an improvement in the politico-military situation will lead to our activities being resumed in the sphere of both restoration and excavation. In spite of understandable diffi? culties, the local workmen, who have had a sound training over the past years, have seen to the seasonal maintenance of the archaeological sites. Italian Institutes and Cultural Centres in Asia By convention with the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, IsMEO gave a grant of 40 million lire for 1979 towards the activities of the Italian Institutes of Culture in Tokyo, Delhi, Tehran and Djakarta. IsMEO kept in regular contact with these institutions with regard to the promotion and fulfilment of their programmes. Among the more noteworthy events we may mention the publication of an Italian-Indonesian dictionary at Djakarta, and the presentation in New Delhi of the Anthology of Italian literature translated into Hindi by Prof. L.P. Mishra, Professor of Hindi language and literature at the University of Venice and a member of IsMEO. Particular mention should be made of the ceremony held in Calcutta for the Asiatic Society's award of a medal to Prof. Giuseppe Tucci in recognition of his contribution to Indological studies. The ceremony was attended by the Director of the Italian Cultural Institute in New Delhi, who read an address sent by Prof. Tucci. Noteworthy Events in Italy and Abroad Amongst the most noteworthy of IsMEO's activities abroad may be mentioned the visit made by Prof. Victor Aldo Fasano, Head of the Istituto di Neurochirurgia of the Turin University, to India, Nepal and Indonesia. The visit, which took place in August-September 1979, was financed by the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and IsMEO. Prof. Fasano visited universities, scientific organizations and hospitals, and had interesting talks with colleagues in these three countries. The film "Tecnologie avanzate in neurochirurgia^', which shows brain-surgery performed by Prof. Fasano using laser, met with great interest. In November 1978 Prof. Maurizio Taddei represented IsMEO at a congress of Kushan studies held in Kabul, which was attended by a large number of scholars from various countries. The papers read at the congress dealt with subjects in history, iconography, religion, architecture and technology. Prof. Taddei read a paper entitled "Meditation on Death in Gandharan Art*. On this occasion Prof. Taddei was also able to meet with the Afghan authorities in order to confirm IsMEO's interest in continuing its archaeological and restoration activities there, since interrupted owing to the internal situation. Dr Maria Cristina Gaja of the cultural service of IsMEO attended the conference on "La pre senza arabo-islamica nella cultura delFOccidente", which was held at Palermo in November 1979, as representative of IsMEO. The President of IsMEO, Prof. Gherardo Gnoli, attended the meetings organized by the Prime Minister, the Chinese Embassy and the President of the Republic on the occasion of the visit to Italy of the Prime Minister of the People's Republic of China, Hua Guo Feng. The staff of IsMEO said farewell to Prof. Antonio Gargano, General Secretary of IsMEO, and to Mr Danilo De Grandi, both of whom retired this year after more than 40 years of service. On 10th November the President of IsMEO gave a party in honour of Prof. Gargano, thus giving friends and colleagues the opportunity of expressing their thanks to him for all that he has done for IsMEO over the years. On this occasion the President read a letter from Prof. Giuseppe Tucci, Honorary President of IsMEO, who was unable to attend, expressing warm thanks and good wishes to one of his oldest and most loyal collaborators. IsMEO contributed to the cultural programmes of the Italian radio and television network (RAI) by providing photographic material, films, publi? cations, etc. for a series of six TV broadcasts on the activities of the Institute.
