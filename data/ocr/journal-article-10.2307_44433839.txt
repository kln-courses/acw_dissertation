(SP-454) Wheels for Commercial Vehicles. John R. Kinstler, Motor Wheel Corp., Lansing, MI. While the basis of wheel design has evolved by using current technological materials and concepts, the manu- facturing and design is still inexact and partially an art. This paper reviews wheels intended for use on commercial vehicles, including light, medium, and heavy trucks, truck trailers, transit, and inter-city buses. The paper also covers spoke-type wheels, demountable rims, and disc-type wheels with rims from 13 inch diameter to 24 inch diameter. The paper encompasses a brief history, historical and market trends by vehicular types, design parameters, standardization, industrial technical commit- tees, and future trends in design and materials. 800002. Internal Transfer Case Controls for Four Wheel Drive Vehicles. Gamble E. Huffaker, New Process Gear Corp. Transfer case drive assemblies for four wheel drive vehicles have changed drastically to improve fuel econ- omy. New designs have also improved driver ease of operation. This paper describes three new internal transfer case control systems which enhance driver operation and control of four wheel drive vehicles. 800003. AMC Four Wheel Drive Eagle A New Dimension in Transportation. R. C. Lunn, American Motors Corporation. While demand for four-wheel-drive vehicles soared in the early 1970's, the available machinery accented off-road usage. American Motors Corporation was quick to respond to consumer interest in a new type vehicle combining the security of traditional 4WD with the comfort and convenience associated with 2WD passenger cars. The Eagle vehicle was first prototyped in 1972 and established package and design feasibility of a 4WD driveline applied to a unitized body. Four years later, with a new set of ingredients designed to overcome earlier problems of achieving NVH objectives, a concentrated development program was begun. The result, after several developmental phases, was the Eagle for the 1980 model year. The integration and application of AMC and Jeep engineering technologies that brought this project to fruition are herein described. 800004. Ford Motor Company Automatic Overdrive Transmission. Sam Dabich, Ford Motor Co. The Ford Automatic Overdrive (AOD) is a new concept four-speed automatic transmission that incorporates a new fuel-efficient torque converter, split torque in third gear and a full mechanical drive in fourth (overdrive). In third gear, forty per cent of the power is transmitted hydrodynamically; the other sixty per cent is transmitted mechanically by direct connection between the engine and transmission. In overdrive, engine power completely bypasses the torque converter and follows a direct mechanical path to the driveshaft. The AOD is available in 1980 Lincoln Continental, Continental Mark VI, Ford, Mercury, Thunderbird and Cougar XR-7 vehicles. 1980 SA E Transactions 800005. Economic and Manufacturing Considerations for Composite Driveshafts. Howard S. Kliger, Struc- tural Composites Group, Celanese Corp., Sum- mit, NJ; Derek N. Yates, Merlin Technologies, Inc., Structural Composites Group, Celanese Corp., San Jose, CA; and Geoff C. R. Davis, McClean Anderson, Inc., Milwaukee, WI. A brief review of various composite driveshaft concepts is given. Included are the carbon-glass hybrid filament wound, carbon fiber overwrapped aluminum, pultruded, and fabric wrapped versions. The basic fabrication methods are explained with advantages and disadvantages of each. The results of a detailed economic study of the various fabrication methods are given. Included variables are material costs (carbon fiber, prepreg, and resin), and production rates. A second concurrent study compared the various fabrication methods based on more qualitative factors such as experience, reliability, design simplicity, etc. The results of both studies conclude that a filament wound all-composite structure is the most attractive. Finally, the filament winding manufacturing concept is described. The current Mark VI machine concept, together with overall manufacturing scheme, is described. 800006. Computerized Bearing System Analysis Tuned for Front Wheel Drive Vehicles. G. G. Gilbert, M. R. Hoeprich and H. J. Wasik, Timken Co., Canton, OH. In a front wheel drive vehicle, the space available for driveline and suspension components has placed unique demands on the wheel bearing design. To assist with the selection of an optimum bearing package, a computer program has been developed based on a total bearing systems analysis. For the calculation of the bearing system fatigue life, the program considers duty cycle, vehicle load and speed, bearing setting, lubrication, and the misalign- ment caused by the imposed loads. A theoretical bearing package evaluation made early in the wheel design will assure satisfactory performance under actual service conditions. 1980 SA E Transactions 800008.

The Evolution of the Finite Element Method. James L. Tocher, Boeing Computer Services Co. A history of the development of the finite element method is presented. The practical application of the method was delayed many years until some key advances in comput- ing technology, namely adequate computer power (the IBM 704) and the FORTRAN compiler, became avail- able. Some major conceptual breakthroughs contributing to significant advances are described. Countering these breakthroughs, constrictive thinking also occurred, at times making problem solving more difficult than nec- essary. The interaction of breakthroughs, constrictive thinking and technology is discussed. 1980 SA E Transactions 800010.

Dill, Computer Sci- ence Dept., General Motors Research Labs., Warren, MI; and Frank W. Bliss, Ford Motor Co. Parts 1 and 2 of this paper discuss computer graphics relating to the computer-aided-design of automobiles at General Motors and Ford Motor Company, repectively. An individual company history of computer graphics is presented in each part, in addition to an indication of each company's assessment of the system's future poten- tial. 800011. Impact of Computer Developments on Engi- neering Applications - Past, Present and Future. Mounir M. Kamal, General Motors Corp. During the past ten years, the use of computers in automotive design analysis has increased at an expo- nential pace. This has been especially evident in the application of computer graphics and numerical tech- niques to mathematically represent the behavior of the vehicle structure and its components. Such tools have made it possible to meet the challenge of increased safety, durability, and fuel economy requirements. Computer applications are being implemented in the automotive industry over a wide spectrum to help develop a new generation of vehicles. These include weight reduction and resizing, friction reduction in the moving parts of the engine and power train, material selection, design assurance, and product safety and reliability. In this paper, we cite those areas where computer developments have been and will continue to be essential tools for important advances in vehicle design. 800012. New Distributor Rotor for EMI Suppression. W. C. Kuo, General Motors Research Laboratories; and R. L. Sprague, General Motors Delco-Remy Div. A new distributor rotor has been developed recently for improved EMI suppression. This rotor relies on a durable dielectric coating to provide consistent, EMI suppression for the ignition system. 800014. Electrical Transient Suppression Properties of Sealed Nickel-Cadmium and Sealed Lead Bat- teries. F. H. Mullersman, Battery Business Dept., General Electric Co., Gainesville, FL. Sealed nickel-cadmium and sealed lead batteries offer a practical means for holding up volatile electronic memo- ries and for relieving the automotive SLI battery of intermittent electronic loads during ignition-off periods. While serving the more conventional functions, the low dynamic impedance of these sealed batteries can act in conjunction with a simple charging circuit, to significantly isolate the electronic circuits they serve from damaging and disrupting electrical system transients such as load dump. 1980 SA E Transactions 800015. The Search for a Truly International Radio Frequency Interference Standard. F. Bauer, P.E., Ford Motor Company; and A. C. Doty, The Dee Company. SAE J551a (radio interference from ignition systems) was the first Standard revised specifically for compatibility with international requirements. Subsequent revisions (presently 55 lg) have made it significantly more stringent than the standard used overseas. U.S. automotive manufacturers have voluntarily de- signed vehicles to conform since 1962, without the necessity of Federal regulation. Liaison with Canada resulted in the use of the SAE Standard when RFI regulations were promulgated. Twenty years international negotiations have resulted in a common concept for North American and world requirements. The RFI Subcommittee will continue harmonization toward the objective of achieving a worldwide standard. 800016. Ni-Resist Type D5S - An Improved Material for Turbocharger Housings. P. I. Fontaine, Inco Europe Ltd., European Research and Devel- opment Centre. Automotive turbocharger housings are complex castings of predominantly thin sections requiring a demanding combination of properties. Ni-resist Type D5S, a highly 22</page><page sequence="4">800017-800023 castable austenitic ductile iron containing 36%Ni, 5.3%Si, 2%Cr, provides the required combination of properties and is finding increased application in turbocharger housings. A series of investigations has been conducted into the influence of melting/casting and compositional variables on microstructure, mechanical and physical properties, and machinability of this iron. A preferred melting/casting practice is recommended, and the effects of various addition elements are defined. Mechanical, physical, machinability and oxidation properties are presented. 1980 SA E Transactions 800017. Three Years Field Experience with the Lambda- Sensor in Automotive Control Systems. H. U. Gruber and H. M. Wiedenmann, Robert Bosch GmbH. The temperature mappings of Lambda-Sensors in more than 30 different applications with closed-loop systems are presented. A new measuring technique is introduced, which allows to estimate the control performance of the Lambda-sensor in a laboratory test. The special influences of very hot (&gt;900°C) and cold (&lt;400°C) applications and of lead poisoning upon this control performance are discussed. As a result there are given some guidelines for the user of Lambda-sensors. 800018. Non-Ideal Properties of Zr02 and Ti02 Exhaust Gas Oxygen Sensors. M. A. Shulman and D. R. Hamburg, Ford Motor Co., Dearborn, MI. A brief physical description of Zr02 and Ti02 exhaust gas oxygen sensors is presented, followed by a comparison of the two sensors operating under actual open-loop and closed-loop conditions on an engine/dynamometer setup. The sensitivity of the Zr02 sensor to engine load and cylinder-to-cylinder maldistribution is explored, and the compatibility of the Zr02 switch point and a three-way catalyst window is considered. 1980 SA E Transactions 800019. Application of Exhaust-Gas-Oxygen Sensors to the Study of Storage Effects in Automotive Three-Way Catalysts. Allen H. Meitzler, Ad- vanced Components and Energy Systems Dept., Ford Motor Co., Dearborn, MI. The time-average conversion efficiencies of an automotive three-way catalyst subjected to exhaust flows for which A/F is modulated around stoichiometry are benefited by the ability of the catalyst to store oxidizing and reducing chemical species. A V-8 engine equipped with a vapor carburetor and exhaust system containing zirconia ex- haust-gas-oxygen sensors before and after a three-way catalyst has been used to study the response of the catalyst to fast changes in exhaust A/F ratio. With this exper- imental arrangement, qualitative and quantitative obser- vations of storage of oxidizing and reducing chemical species on Engelhard Industries TWC-19D3 catalysts have been made. The quantitative value for the oxygen storage capacity obtained for full-sized catalysts in real exhaust gas compares favorably with the value measured using a laboratory mass-spectrometer technique with small catalyst samples and synthesized exhaust gases. 1980 SA E Transactions 800020. Zirconia Oxygen Sensor-An Equivalent Circuit Model. William J. Fleming, Research Labs., General Motors Corp., Warren, MI. The zirconia exhaust gas oxygen sensor is a key com- ponent in closed loop engine emissions control systems. An equivalent circuit model of the sensor is derived from fundamental electrochemical principles. In this model, sensor electrode resistance and capacitance are separated from the zirconia electrolyte resistance. An important theoretical conclusion is that the resistances (electrode kinetics) of microscopic CO and 02 voltage cells enter into the determination of sensor output voltage and its transient response. In addition, numerical examples are given to show how the equivalent circuit can be used to model both steady state and transient characteristics of sensors. 1980 SA E Transactions 800022. Guidelines for Establishing Specifications and Test Methods for Automotive Sensors. R. K. Frank, American Motors Corp. This paper describes a comprehensive approach for both specifications and test methods for sensors that are used in state of the art automotive electronics. The manifold absolute pressure sensor is specifically presented as a device for which sufficient applications and non-propri- etary information exist to allow complete documentation. Ongoing industry efforts are discussed in other sensor as well as actuator areas. 800023. Low Cost Thick-Film Pressure Sensor. A. Cattaneo, R. Dell'Acqua, F. Forlani and L. Pirozzi, F. I. Magneti Marelli (Pavia/I taly). Pressure sensors in automobiles are used in connexion with electronic systems intended to control carburetion. The pressure range to be measured is around the atmospheric pressure, a tolerance in the order of ± 2% is required in the temperature range from 0 to 80°C, good reproducibility and reliability, especially as for low infant mortality, together with low prices are mandatory. A new type of pressure sensor aiming to fit the above mentioned characteristics has been developed taking advantage from the piezoresistive effect of thick-film resistors screened-and-fired on ceramic diaphragms. The device consists of a ceramic diaphragm bound around the edge, where in proper positions four resistors 23</page><page sequence="5">800024-800029 electrically connected according to Weathstone bridge configuration are screened-and-fired. The deformation of the diaphragm because of an applied pressure causes bridge unbalancing and output signal proportional to the pressure itself. 800024. A Ratiometric Temperature Sensor for High Temperature Applications. Peter J. Sacchetti and Donald R. Phillips, New England Instrument Co., Natick, MA. A new type of temperature sensor has been developed, a design capable of providing a ratiometric voltage output for the measurement of temperatures up to 650°C. The sensor requires no supporting amplifiers or signal condi- tioning electronics. This paper presents details of con- struction and results of laboratory performance tests for this sensor. An accuracy of ± 3% has been achieved over a temperature range of ambient to 650°C. 800025. (P-86) Observation of Combustion Process in D.I. Diesel Engine via High Speed Direct and Schlieren Photography. T. Shiozaki, T. Suzuki and M. Shimoda, Hino Motors, Ltd. (Japan). Direct and Schlieren Photographing of the combustion process in an actual D.I. diesel engine have been investigated, and by comparing both direct and schlieren methods with cylinder pressure measurement, the char- acteristics of mixing, ignition and burning process were analyzed. The different combustion characteristics in- duced by various in-cylinder air motions were also observed. The injected fuel spray jet pattern, which impinged on the conbustion chamber wall, seems to affect the mixing process due to combination with in-cylinder air motion. The development of fuel jet spray was observed and compared with some theoretical treatments. The contribution of turbulence on combustion both in pre- mixed and diffusion type burning period was recognized and the effect of swirl especially on diffusion burning period was also confirmed.

Kei Miwa and Makoto Ikegami, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg., Kyoto Univ.; and Ryoji Nakano, Mitsu- bishi Heavy Industries Ltd. A high-speed gas-sampling technique has been applied to reveal the time development of spatial distributions of several chemical species produced during combustion in the swirl and the main chambers. To enable traversed gas-sampling in each chamber, experiments have been made by using a double-scavenged two-stroke cycle engine with a simulated two-dimensional chamber con- figuration. By these experiments the following matters have been examined in detail: the extent of fuel-rich zones, their decay with time, the action of swirling air motion, the formation of nitric oxide, the formation of hydrocarbons and of carboneous substance, the state of the outflow of gas from the swirl chamber into the main chamber, and the flame spread within the main chamber. Besides, the influence of some operating conditions and of design parameters, such as overall fuel-air ratio, injection timing, dimension of connecting passage, and direction of the fuel spray, upon these items have been investigated. 1980 SA E Transactions 800027. (P-86) Gas Flow Studies in Direct Injection Diesel Engines with Re-Entrant Combustion Chambers. T. J. Williams and M. J. Tindal, Univ. of London, King's College, Strand (London/England). This paper describes an investigation of the gas flow inside the cylinders of motored direct injection diesel engines using fixed and moving hot wire probes. Partic- ular attention has been paid to the transfer of swirl into the bowl as the piston approaches the end of the compression stroke and the flow pattern in the bowl around T.D.C. The investigation covered two types of bowl in current use, one a toroidal design and the other a re-entrant shape which had been found to give low emissions. Measurements were also made in a re-entrant chamber of simplified geometry with the object of providing data for use in the theoretical modelling of gas flow and combustion processes. 1980 SA E Transactions 800028. (P-86) The Development of Some Gaseous Products During Diesel Engine Combustion. N. D. Whitehouse, E. Clough and S. O. Uhun- mwangho, Mechanical Engineering Dept., The Univ. of Manchester, Institute of Science and Technology (Manchester/England). An extensive experimental program of in-cylinder sam- pling is described and the integrity of the results discussed. The sampling data of the gaseous products NO, CO and C02 have been used to produce concentration contours on various planes around the fuel spray at different times during the combustion process. Some calculations of spray penetration and NO production have been com- pared with experimental data. 800029. (P-86) A Combustion Correlation for Diesel Engine Simulation. N. Watson and A. D. Pilley, Imperial College of Science and Technology; and M. Marzouk, Power Plant Consultants. The use of cycle simulation computer programs has become an established part of turbocharged diesel engine research and development. However, the utility of these programs has in the past been limited by the need for combustion information at the operating point. This difficulty has been overcome by the development of an empirical correlation simulating the combustion process (heat release) via an analytical expression whose govern- 24</page><page sequence="6">800030-800033 ing parameters are linked to in-cylinder conditions. A method of deriving the governing parameters from only a minimum of experimental test data is presented, but enabling performance to be predicted over a wide range of operating conditions. The use of the combustion correlation enables the effects of changing ambient conditions, turbocharger match, valve timing and other engine design parameters to be predicted automatically, and includes their influence on combustion as well as the turbocharging process. 800030. (P-86) The Role of Oxygen in Intake and Exhaust on NO Emission, Smoke and BMEP of a Diesel Engine with EGR System. Hideyuki Tsunemoto and Hiromi Ishitani, Dept. of Me- chanical Engrg., Kitami Institute of Technology (Japan). EGR reduces NO emission, but increases smoke and decreases BMEP in diesel engines. This paper describes the relationships between these behaviors and the effect of decreased oxygen with EGR in direct injection, pre- chamber, and turbocharged diesel engines. The results indicate that the reduction of NO depends on decreasing the rate of the incoming oxygen. The increase in smoke and the decrease in BMEP is due to a reduced rate of exhaust oxygen. Also the reduction of NO is due to increased ambient humidity which can be explained by the decreased oxygen in the incoming charge. With these results, it becomes possible to predict the ratio of the reduction of NO emission, the increase in smoke and the decrease in BMEP. 1980 SAE Transactions 800031. Noise and Performance of Automotive Cooling Fans. Robert C. Mellin, Fluid Dynamics Dept., General Motors Research Laboratories, Warren, MI. It is important to know the noise and performance characteristics of different engine-cooling-fan designs when making a selection for a particular application. Convenient parameters such as specific diameter, specific speed, efficiency and sound-power-level coefficient relate the geometrical performance and noise characteristics of a fan to the aerodynamic requirements of the system. Fan characteristics expressed in these parameters show clearly: the relationship between efficiency and noise; the effect of various geometric variables on efficiency and noise; comparisons of noise, performance, and other charac- teristics between different fan designs in performing a given pumping task. GM Research studies show that the peak efficiency and minimum noise operating points of a fan do not necessarily coincide. Therefore, the judicious use of both noise and performance characteristics is important in selecting the best fan design for a given application. These studies also show that decreasing tip clearance, decreasing pitch angle, and increasing chord at a given solidity will increase fan efficiency, while decreasing tip clearance, optimizing pitch angle, optimizing camber, and optimizing solidity will reduce fan noise. 1980 SA E Transactions 800032. Ram Air Effects on the Air Side Cooling System Performance of a Typical North American Pas- senger Car. U. W. Schaub, National Research Council of Canada; and H. N. Charles, Cana- dian Fram Ltd. A standard engine mounted cooling fan in a 1976 Ford Granada equipped with air conditioning and a 4.9/ (302 cu. in.) V-8 engine was performance-tested on the road and under wind tunnel generated ram air conditions. To achieve appropriate back pressure variation the whole engine bay was pressurized through use of remotely placed plant exhauster machinery. System resistance was studied over a range of ram air conditions, and was shown to be composed of a ram air loss, a stationary vehicle front end loss, an engine bay blockage loss, and the radiator cooling air dynamic pressure, or face head. Ram air and cooling air flow caused engine bay pressure to be slightly positive relative to the ambient static pressure level. Fan pressure-flow characteristics were measured for various fan speeds and three ram conditions. These were observed to correlate as one universal map. This universal characteristic together with the measured front end resistances and ram pressure was interpreted as series- operated fans consisting of a supercharging first stage and the cooling fan acting as a second stage. This model and the identified resistance mechanisms enable accurate performance prediction to be made. 1980 SA E Transactions 800033. Experimental Analysis of the Air Circuit for Engine Cooling Systems. A. Costelli, P. Gabriele and D. Giordanengo, Centro Ricerche FIAT S.p.A. (Italy). If the ram effect is null or negligible, generation of the air flow required by the engine cooling system in a vehicle depends entirely on the fan. Currently, there is no satisfactory theory which permits the designing of the fan and the dimensioning of the system in restricted flow conditions; even experi- mental evaluations are neither easy nor generally applied. This paper presents a method for experimental analysis of the air circuit which compares fan "actual" performance with "ideal" performance. Examples of application demonstrate the practical usefulness of this method, not only for system devel- opment purposes, but also for providing empirical data which can be used during the design stage. 1980 SA E Transactions 25</page><page sequence="7">800034-800039 800034. Automotive Mixed Flow Fan with Guide Vanes on Blade Surfaces. Haruo Katagiri, Kenji Fuji- kake and Katsuhito Yamada, Toyota Central Research and Development Labs., Inc. We have developed a simple and lower cost mixed air flow fan with guide vanes on the blade surfaces for use in automotive engine cooling. Through investigation of the fan performance and flow visualization, the axial and radial flow produced by this fan proved to be most suitable and efficient for engine cooling. The improved efficiency and increased air flow provided by this fan contribute to reduction of specific noise level and power consumption as compared to conventional fans. It is moreover possible to reduce the size and dimensions of the fan while maintaining its cooling performance. It is also useful for eliminating heat dwelling and high temperature problems from the exhaust pipe and car- buretor in the engine room. 1980 SA E Transactions 800035. The Effect of the Flow Nonuniformity on the Sizing of the Engine Radiator. J. P. Chiou, Mechanical Engineering, Univ. of Detroit. A mathematical method to determine the effectiveness of the engine radiator accounting for the effect of the two-dimensional nonuniform fluid flow distributions on both cooling air and engine coolant sides is presented. By using a successive substitution technique, a single equa- tion with the temperature of the heat transfer wall as the unknown variable is obtained from the three heat transfer rate equations. The radiator heat transfer effectiveness and its deterioration due to the effect of the two- dimensional flow nonuniformity on both fluid sides have been calculated for several typical fluid flow distributions. The effect of the flow nonuniformity on the sizing of the engine radiator of automobile is discussed. 1980 SA E Transactions 800036. Two-Stroke Engines. Paul Knöpfler, Erich Wac- ker and Hermann Weeber, Karl Schmidt, GmbH. Cost, weight and power output, render it unlikely that 2-stroke engines for chain saws and related applications can be superseded by any other propulsion system in the near future. In order to remain competitive in the future, 2-stroke engines - and thus cylinders and pistons - must be designed that they are able to achieve the largest possible power output from the lowest possible overall volume, with an adequate operational reliability and at compet- itive prices. Special attention must be paid to exhaust gas emission and noise, particularly in view of future legis- lation. This paper reports on new results obtained when increasing the power output of 2-stroke chain saw engines, and describes the prospects for an increase in operational reliability. 800037. An Improved Gas Dynamic Model Simulating the Scavenging Process in a Two-Stroke Cycle Engine. Eran Sher, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., Ben-Gurion Univ., (Beer-Sheva/Israel). An improved mathematical model is presented here to simulate the gas exchange of a two-stroke, cross or loop-scavenged engine. In this model, the geometry of the cylinder and port assemblies, as well as the physical conditions of operation are fully represented. The basic model which was described by the present author in a former work, has been modified here to include the Woolley-Hatton model for turbulent flow. By comparing predictions from both models with experimental meas- urements, it seems that a significant improvement was achieved here in predicting the instantaneous interface profile between the incoming charge and the burnt gas. 800038. Further Developments in Scavenging Analysis for Two-Cycle Engines. G. P. Blair and R. G. Kenny, Dept. of Mechanical and Industrial Engrg., The Queen's Univ. of Belfast (Northern Ireland). In 1968 Professor Alfred Jante published an SAE paper detailing a method of assessing the scavenging behaviour of a two-cycle engine. It was a simple technique involving motoring the engine and measuring the (cylinder head removed) velocity contours at the cylinder head level using pitot tubes. It attracted wide attention in industry, but with varying degrees of acceptance and results. This paper attempts to establish in a logical manner and with a considerable volume of experimental data that the method proposed by Jante has real relevance, but to obtain acceptable accuracy in terms of predicting good and bad scavenging for particular engine cylinders the results have to be analysed rather more carefully and completely than the approach adopted by Jante. The experimental work describes motoring and firing tests on one engine with many engine cylinders of differing scavenging layouts and correlates the scavenge tests motoring with the firing tests which include measured scavenge and trapping efficiency values, cylinder pressure diagrams together with the usual engine performance parameters. 1980 SAE Transactions 800039. Clutch for Lawn Mower Engine Auxiliary Shaft. Robert K. Mitchell, Thomas R. Kosmatka and Orlen Braunschweig, Research &amp; Development Center, Briggs &amp; Stratton Corp. In many self-propelled, walk-behind mowers, a clutch is required to couple an auxiliary drive shaft to the traction drive mechanism. The typical environment for lawn mowing often presents problems for unprotected clutches. A new clutch has been designed for mounting inside the engine crankcase. Discussions are presented of the design approach end features, and of performance in the test laboratory and field. 26</page><page sequence="8">800042-800045 800042. Performance of a Plasma Jet Igniter. B. Cetegen, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena; K. Y. Teichman, Univ. of Minnesota, Min- neapolis; F. J. Weinberg, Imperial College of Science and Technology (London/England); and A. K. Oppenheim, Univ. of California, Berkeley. The main advantage of jet igniters lies in their ability to provide distributed ignition sources that are capable of initiating and enhancing combustion in lean mixtures. This is achieved principally by two mechanisms: the provision of a high concentration of free radicals, enhancing ignition at lower temperatures, and of the extended highly turbulent igniting surface, yielding larger flame front areas and hence increased burning rates. The paper describes experimental and analytical procedures that were developed to determine the performance of a jet igniter with particular emphasis on the fluid mechanic effects. This consists of the evaluation of the penetration depth of the jet as a function of the plasma plug geometry, and of the rate of burning in the jet-ignited charge, as well as the corresponding turbulent and laminar flame burning velocities. To de-emphasize the thermochemical effects, the plasma medium and energy were maintained without change for all the tests. Thus the only variables in our study pertained just to the geometry of the igniter, that is, the volume of the cylindrical plasma cavity and the area of the orifice discharging the jet. The results are based on high speed schlieren cinematography of the combustion process in a cylindrical bomb, and simultaneous pressure transducer measurements. The penetration depth is shown to be proportional to the square root of the characteristic length - the ratio of the volume of igniter cavity to its orifice area. The capability to ignite lean mixtures is demonstrated by the repeatability of results attained with the use of methane-air mixtures at an equivalence ratio of 0.6, initially at atmospheric pressure and room temper- ature. Under these conditions the observed enhancement of the rate of combustion could be accounted for entirely by the fact that the flame surface was enlarged due to ignition by a highly turbulent jet. While the laminar burning velocity was well within the range reported in the literature, the corresponding 'turbulent' burning velocity was about three times greater, the ratio between the two remaining nearly constant throughout the process. 1980 SAE Transactions 800043. An Investigation of the Ignition Process in a Lean-Burning Engine Using Conditionally Sam- pled Laser-Doppler Anemometry. J. B. Cole and M. D. Swords, Shell Research Ltd., Thornton Research Centre (Chester/England). An investigation of the relationship between fluctuations in the flow field in the region of the spark plug and the efficiency of subsequent combustion has been carried out in a lean-burning engine. Pne experiment involved the application of conditional sampling techniques to laser- Doppler anemometry measurements. Strong correlations were measured between mean velocity in the vicinity of the spark plug immediately preceding ignition and the peak pressure achieved; however, a much weaker dependence on turbulence intensity variations was observed. 1980 SAE Transactions 800044. Schlieren Visualization of the Flow and Density Fields in the Cylinder of a Spark-Ignition Engine. M. Namazian, S. Hansen, E. Lyford-Pike, J. Sanchez-Barsse, J. Heywood and J. Rife, Sloan Automotive Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA. The design and operating characteristics of a single- cylinder transparent spark-ignition engine for Schlieren flow visualization are described. The engine is built on a CFR engine crankcase using the CFR piston and cylinder as a crosshead for the square cross-section piston and cylinder assembly. The square cross-section assembly has two parallel steel walls and two parallel quartz glass walls to permit optical access to the entire cylinder volume over the complete engine operating cycle. The CFR head and valve mechanism completes the assembly. It is shown that the engine operates satisfactorily with propane fuel under typical engine operating conditions. Schlieren short time-exposure photographs and high speed movies were taken to define details of the flow and density fields through the engine cycle. Photographs which illustrate key features of these fields are presented and described. Important features identified are: Jet flow through the intake valve; large scale rotating motion in the cylinder during intake and compression; details of ignition, flame kernel development, flame structure, flame propagation; the extent of cycle-by-cycle variations; flow out of the crevices behind and beneath the piston rings during expansion; flow out of the spark plug crevice, and boundary layer entrainment during blowdown; the growth of the vortex in the piston cylinder-wall corner during the exhaust stroke; thermal boundary layer thicknesses. 1980 SAE Transactions 800045.

Design and development of an electrohydraulically actuated gas sampling valve is presented for use in auto engine combustion studies. The valve was developed with particular emphasis on sampling within the vicinity of the wall quench layer, requiring minimum leakage rates to avoid sample contamination and flush seating of the valve-stem to valve-seat to avoid perturbations of the wall layer. Response in the range of 0.4 to 1.0 milliseconds is attainable for variable valve lifts measured between 0.01 to 0.30 mm while using a net sealing force of approx- imately 750N. Gas leakage rates ranged from 0.05% to 1% 27</page><page sequence="9">800046-800051 of the sample mass flow rate when sampling from estimated distances from the wall of 0.3 mm to 0.03 mm, respectively, at a cylinder pressure of 10 bar. The gas sampling valve is presently coupled to a gas Chromatograph to measure concentrations of major species components. Initial studies have focussed upon determining species profiles near the wall at specific times after flame arrival at one sampling location in the engine cylinder. The results indicate that the contribution of wall quench layer hydrocarbons to the engine exhaust is substantially smaller than previously estimated. 1980 SA E Transactions 800046. The Effects of Fuel Structure on the Autoignition of Fuel-Air Mixtures. Saidakmal S. Saidaminov, Automobile and Road Construction Inst. (Tashkent/U.S.S.R.). This paper contains the results of studies of self-ignition of differently-structured hydrocarbons, as well as of different gasolines, under varying rates of compression. Two oxygen-containing compounds, methanol and ether, were also examined. The air-fuel equivalence ratio was held at 1 .2 for all tests. The experimental conditions simulate the end-gas state in an engine where compression takes place at different rates when engine speed is changed. Using the modern concept of the gas-phase oxidation of hydro- carbons, and drawing on the experimental data, a new scheme of hydrocarbon oxidation was developed. The activation energy for five individual hydrocarbons was calculated according to this scheme. The experiments with different gasolines have shown that the presence of more than 30% aromatic or olefinic hydrocarbons in gasoline leads to independence of fuel-knock resistance from engine speed. This last fact can promote high-speed knock. 800047. Review - Some Processes in Internal Combus- tion Engines. T. Paul Torda, Triodyne, Inc., Skokie, IL. The nature of analytical and experimental work published on combustion in internal combustion (IC) engines - including Diesel engines - is discussed. It is shown why the approaches used may not yield meaningful results. Avenues are indicated that may lead to more progress. Generally accepted models are contrasted with actual aerothermochemical processes in IC engines and it is shown that fuel jet mixing, gas motion, flame propagation, and turbulence are not modeled correctly. It is suggested that experimental techniques and analytical methods developed in the rocket combustion field may be useful if applied to IC engine combustion research. 800048. Sources of Hydrocarbon Emissions from Direct Injection Diesel Engines. R. C. Yu, V. W. Wong and S. M. Shahed, Cummins Engine Co., Inc. Some results of a systematic study on sources of unburned hydrocarbons from direct injection diesel engines are presented. The following possible sources are considered and investigated experimentally and/or analytically: local over-mixing, local under-mixing, bulk quenching, cyclic misfire, cyclic variation, and wall effects. The significance of each source under a variety of operating conditions including simulated deceleration, light loads, high loads, and simulated acceleration are discussed. The results show that the formation of unburned hydrocarbons is mainly controlled by transient fuel-air mixing and bulk quenching processes. The fraction of fuel appearing as unburned hydrocarbons in the exhaust is greatest at light loads and retarded conditions. 1980 SA E Transactions 800050. Performance and NOx Model of a Direct Injec- tion Stratified Charge Engine. Hikosaburo Hir- aki, Komatsu Ltd.; and Joe M. Rife, Massa- chusetts Institute of Technology. A model has been developed to predict the performance and NOx emission of the Texaco stratified charge engine. This complete engine cycle program starts from engine geometry, valve and fuel injection timing, fuel charac- teristics and operating conditions and includes the following phases: valve overlap, intake, compression, combustion, expansion and exhaust. The fuel mixing process is described by a jet mixing model and the equations are solved in a cylindrical coordinate system with a nonuniform pressure field. The jet shape changes were calculated for the jet impingement effect against a solid wall. The air motion inside the cylinder is determined by a detailed sub-model to specify the field for the fuel jet. During combustion, the fuel jet is divided into many elements and the combustion process of each element is analyzed as a mixing process between the jet and surrounding air, entrainment into a flame front and subsequent combustion. For heat transfer the walls of the combustion chamber are divided into five regions; intake valve, exhaust valve, cylinder head, cylinder wall and piston top. Each region is assumed to have a different temperature and different gas velocity. Nitric oxide emissions are calculated by using the extended ZeFdovich kinetic mechanism with a steady state assumption for the N concentration and equilibrium values used for H, O, 02 and OH concentrations. The model computes combustion rates, heat transfer and NOx based on the same jet mixing processes at each stage. Comparison of the model predictions with the avail- able experimental data shows reasonably good agreement. 1980 SA E Transactions 800051. Air-Fuel Control to Reduce Emissions I. Engine- Emissions Relationships. W. H. Holl, ECS Pro- ject Center, General Motors Corp. Relationships between the oxidants and the unburned 28</page><page sequence="10">800052-800057 fuels in the exhaust gas provide effective measures of emission system performance. These include the mean deviation from stoichiometry, air-fuel distribution, and catalyst storage effects all under dynamic conditions. Basic concepts of the interaction of air-fuel ratio, exhaust gas composition and catalyst performance are reviewed, further developed and simplified for use by the devel- opment engineer in evaluating system performance. 800052. Air-Fuel Control to Reduce Emissions, II. En- gine-Catalyst Characterization Under Cyclic Con- ditions. Wei-Ming Wang, Emission Control System Project Center, General Motors Corp. An experimental program was carried out to investigate the effect of changing the frequency and amplitude of air-fuel fluctuation on catalyst performance. From exper- imental data, physical characteristics that relate the catalyst performance between the cyclic and static air-fuel conditions were identified, and a frequency domain model is established for the catalyst to allow prediction of its system performance based on its intrinsic properties. By utilizing the concept of air-fuel maldistribution in char- acterizing the engine exhaust and treating it in frequency domain, this catalyst model can be used to simplify the prediction of emission performance when the engine exhaust air-fuel is known, and optimized strategies for air-fuel control can be derived. 800053. GM Micro-Computer Engine Control System. R. A. Grimm, R. J. Bremer and S. P. Stonestreet, GM Emission Control Project Center, Flint, MI. The General Motors microprocessor based Computer Controlled Catalytic Converter (C-4) system used on 1980 California vehicles and nationwide in 1981 is presented. The basic system function is to maintain engine exhaust air-fuel ratio control so that oxidation and reduction characteristics of three-way catalytic converters can be effectively utilized. Control strategies and components used in the Closed Loop Carburetor Control (CLCC) function are reviewed. Other system components and functions including secondary air management control, electronic spark timing, idle speed control, torque con- verter clutch control, controlled canister purge, exhaust gas recirculation control, early fuel evaporative control and system self diagnostics are presented. 1980 SA E Transactions 800054. A Mathematical Engine Model for Development of Dynamic Engine Control. Donald J. Dobner, General Motors Research Laboratories. A mathematical model of a four-stroke spark-ignition engine has been developed for application to dynamic engine control. The model responds to throttle, air/fuel, EGR, spark advance, and load torque inputs to provide manifold pressure, net torque, and engine speed outputs. The dynamic aspects of the model are due to time delays and integration. Nonlinear relationships are incorporated to predict engine performance over a broad operating range. Features of the model include division of the fuel flow into a fast and slow path to produce hesitation, and perturbation of the fuel flow to simulate maldistribution. 1980 SA E Transactions 800055. Computer Simulation of Engine Control Systems - A Tool for Identifying Critical Components and Interactions. Alfred B. Bortz, Essex Group. Prediction of exhaust emission and fuel consumption rates in vehicle operation based on engine dynamometer data has been an important tool in developing engine control strategies. Such predictions rely on accurate knowledge of important engine parameters such as air/fuel ratio, spark advance, and EGR rate. Each control subsystem (fuel, ignition, EGR) is designed based on assumed character- istics of other subsystems, but when the control system is put together, unexpected interactions can result. This paper illustrates how computer simulation of engine control systems can identify such interactions and can predict the sensitivity of emissions and fuel con- sumption to properties of control system components. 800056. Microprocessor Control Brings About Better Fuel Economy with Good Drivability. Kenji Ikeura, Akio Hosaka and Tsuneomi Yano, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. (Japan). A microcomputer control system for managing the automotive engine's air-fuel ratio, spark ignition timing, exhaust gas recirculation and idle speed has been developed and is marketed in Japan under the name of ECCS. By installing this system in a 1,500 kg vehicle's 6 cylinder 2.8 liter engine, the four factors listed above have been controlled so precisely that their optimum relative calibration has been realized. As a result, fuel economy has been improved by 10% while good drivability has been maintained. This paper outlines ECCS and describes how control factors in a "steady state" are determined. It also discusses the control sequence in transient conditions, such as "cold" starts, "hot" restarts, clutch engagement, accel- eration, deceleration, gearshifts and the "warm-up" process. 1980 SA E Transactions 800057. System Design of the Electric Test Vehicle - One (ETV-1). Eugene A. Rowland, Corporate Research and Development, General Electric Co.; and Karl W. Schwarze, Research Office, Chrysler Corp. The Electric Test Vehicle - One (ETV-1) is a four- passenger electric car developed under sponsorship of the U.S. Department of Energy. Developed as a total system, the ETV-1 incorporates improvements in vehicle design, electronics and battery technology to achieve specified performance, safety and cost objectives. The present test 29</page><page sequence="11">800058-800067 vehicle would be suitable, with further development, to be mass-produced by the mid-1980's. Performance of the ETV-1 is enhanced by lightweight construction, low aerodynamic drag, and low rolling resistance. Efficiency of the electrical drive subsystem is optimized through the use of a separately excited drive motor with transistorized armature and field controls. An improved lead-acid battery is used to provide high energy and power density. The test vehicles have demonstrated outstanding performance, including an urban driving range of 1 19 km, a top speed of 1 12 km/hr, and a 0 to 48 km/hr acceleration time of less than nine seconds. 1980 SA E Transactions 800058.

Kerwin, Univ. of Arizona, Dept. of Electrical Engrg., Tucson, AZ. Fuel cells show promise as a highly efficient, nonpolluting power source for vehicles; a power source capable of using nonpetroleum fuels. This report describes a number of design considerations and the projected performance of a fuel-cell-powered highway passenger vehicle.

Kliman, General Electric Co. An improved drive system, which will result in lighter weight, higher efficiency and lower cost for an electric vehicle, is being developed. A study evaluating the suitability of alternative motor and power converter technologies for electric vehicle application was per- formed. The results indicate that an ac induction motor with a transistor inverter has the greatest potential. Not only will this drive system provide greater vehicle range, but it will also provide improved regeneration to the battery. 1980 SA E Transactions 800062. Electronically Commutated Motors for Vehicle Applications. E. Frank Echolds, AiResearch Mfg. Co. of California. New electronically commutated traction motors for electric vehicles may offer improved efficiency over a wider load range, lower weight, and potentially lower cost than conventional brush type machines. Two new elect- ronically commutated traction motors are described along with predicted and measured performance data. The motors are being developed for NASA as part of the Department of Energy electric and hybrid vehicle pro- gram. 800064. Trade-Off Results and Preliminary Designs of Near-Term Hybrid Vehicles. Joel J. Sandberg, Jet Propulsion Lab, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA. Phase I of the Near-Term Hybrid Vehicle Program involved the development of preliminary designs of electric/heat engine hybrid passenger vehicles by four contractors. The preliminary designs were developed on the basis of mission analysis, performance specification, and design trade-off studies conducted independently by the four contractors. The resulting designs all involve parallel hybrid (heat engine/electric) propulsion systems but provide significant variation in component selection, power train layout, and control strategy. Each of the four designs is projected by its developer as having the potential to substitute electrical energy for 40% to 70% of the petroleum fuel consumed annually by its conventional counterpart. 800065. The Evolution of the Passenger Car Wheel. Elvin E. Tuttle, Motor Wheel Corp., Lansing, MI. The objective of this paper is to trace the history of wheels and their development for use on the passenger car. This will include a brief description of the various types of wheels, their origins, their load carrying characteristics and their advantages and disadvantages. Illustrations of typical examples of each type will be included. Some of the trends in design of future wheels will be discussed. 800066. A New Tire Puncture Sealant. L. S. Stokes and C. F. Eckert, Uniroyal Tire Co. The development of a puncture sealant which effectively seals tread punctures 3/16 inch diameter and less is described; included are discussions of the material compositions and properties, the mechanism of sealing, and field testing of the product. 800067. Composite Wheels. Jack E. Gieck, New Product Development, The Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co.; and William D. Noll, Firestone Steel Products Co. This paper first examines and quantifies fuel economy and energy incentives for the use of light-weight wheels on passenger cars, then describes and evaluates two radically different composite wheel candidates: a glass fiber- reinforced plastic (FRP) wheel, and a laminated, foam- 30</page><page sequence="12">800069-800079 filled wheel comprised of thin steel śhells encapsulating a core of structural plastic. The effects of brake heat, long-term aging, hydrolysis, design configuration (par- ticularly the size and shape of brake cooling holes), curb impact, and other considerations unique to organic- composite wheels are examined. 1980 SA E Transactions 800069. The Inspection, Care and Testing of Fiberglass Structures for Utility Equipment. Richard E. Armstrong and Charles H. Kyle, Pitman Div., Emerson Electric Co. Methods of inspecting fiberglass structures in utility equipment are reviewed. Definitions are given of types of defects and a proposal of critical areas on fiberglass structures defined. Cleaning and repair methods are discussed for the correction of defects. Structural tests are reviewed including "acoustical emission" to comply with the standards of ANSI A92.2- 1979. The use of alternating and direct current to test dielectric qualities are discussed showing the advantages and limitations of each method. 1980 SA E Transactions 800070. On-Board Acoustic Emission Monitoring of Fi- berglass Boom Aerial Lift Trucks. John W. McElroy, Philadelphia Electric Co. A new technique of assuring the integrity of fiberglass booms on aerial lift trucks is presented in this paper. The state of the art approach of acoustic emission periodic proof testing is questioned with a new approach of on-board monitoring. The necessity of moving to on- board monitoring is not only economical, but required through results from research into the relationship between load, time, and residual strengths of the fiberglass boom structure. The research described in this paper is a compre- hensive study into the phenomena of boom failures. The critical event degrading the integrity of the boom was found to be damage loads. The paper defines damage loads and discusses the necessity to have the ability to detect and alarm the damage load condition. 1980 SA E Transactions 800071. Computer- Aided Design and Load Analysis of a Cylinder Head Gasket. Paul M. Tensor, Victor Products Div., Dana Corp. This paper describes the complexity of the cylinder head sealing system of an internal combustion engine. The approach taken to the analysis of the sealing system is to look at the cylinder head gasket as an integral part of a larger system, which is the engine and its environment. Each section of the paper describes different conditions to which the gasket is subjected, and presents an analysis of the effects of these conditions on the gasket. The paper shows ways to obtain solutions for an optimum design of the gasket and the overall system. The final results are in the form of a computer printout representing three stages of gasket load distri- bution: installation, after relaxation, and power cycle. 800073. Gasketing the Internal Combustion Engine. Daniel E. Czernik, Fel-Pro Inc. /Felt Products Mfg. Co. Gaskets for the internal combustion engine are highly engineered and rigorously tested products. Their degree of sophistication has largely followed the degree of sophis- tication inherent in the engine. This paper presents a chronological history of the cylinder head gasket as it changed relative to engine changes. Depicted is the general theory of bolted joint sealing as related to head gaskets. The remaining engine gaskets are discussed in regard to their basic construction and material content. An introduction of the chemical gaskets used in internal combustion engines is also included. 800077. Metal-Plastic Laminates for Vehicle Weight Reduction. William K. Miller, Metallurgy Dept., General Motors Research Laboratories, Warren, MI. A laminate combines the material optimization achievable with a composite with the manufacturing convenience and economy offered by a sheet material. In stiffness limited applications, a laminate can provide greater weight savings than are obtainable with other alternate materials at a potentially much lower cost. This paper describes the factors which influence the design of a laminate, the benefits offered by such laminates, and the characteristics of laminates which might limit their application. 1980 SA E Transactions 800078. Steel-Polypropylene-Steel Laminate - A New Weight Reduction Material. J. A. DiCello, Na- tional Steel Research. In the next five years, the weight of the average car will be reduced from 3350 lb (1521 kg) to 2900 lb (1317 kg) to meet the 1985 fuel economy standard. Extensive material substitutions will be needed to achieve this projected weight reduction. To help achieve this weight reduction, a steel-polypropylene laminate consisting of two outer skins of steel with a core of polypropylene is being developed. This laminate has the potential to reduce component weight by 50% with no loss in flexural stiffness. This paper characterizes the dent resistance, flexural stiffness, fatigue strength and formability of this laminate for automotive applications. Many of the above properties are compa- rable to those of steel. 1980 SA E Transactions 800079. New Light-Weight Materials for Vehicle Body Panels - Aluminum/Nylon Laminates. L. W. McKenna, M. H.

Some Characteristics of Foam-Steel Combination Structures for Vehicular Applications. B. S. Levy, Inland Steel Co. The paper provides some design data for characteristic shapes pertinent to steel-structural foam laminate struc- tures that would be formed from plain steel sheets with the foam added to the steel part in its final shape. For panel type sections, attention was focused on open-faced, flat sandwiches. Panel rigidity was studied in bending and torsion as a function of steel thickness, foam density, and foam thickness. The results are presented in terms of equivalent steel panel thickness and in terms of weight saving compared to solid steel panels of equivalent rigidity. Limited data will also be presented on the effect of steel yield strength and thickness and foam density and thickness on dent resistance of the open-faced panels. With regard to structural applications, data will be presented for maximum load and energy absorption of ultra high strength square tubes loaded in bending. It will be shown that the foam density must exceed some critical value for its use to be weight effective. Some data are also included on the effect of using adhesion promoters or coring a central hole in the foam on its performance. 1980 SA E Transactions 800081. Energy Absorption by Foam Filled Structures. P. H. Thornton, Ford Motor Co., Dearborn, MI. The energy absorbed during the axial collapse of a variety of structures made in steel, aluminum alloy and glass fiber reinforced plastic is examined with respect to the changes produced by foam filling. A simple model is devised which permits reasonable estimates of the axial collapse load for a structure and an assessment of the weight effectiveness of foam filling for that structure. Design charts are given, from which the dimensions can be derived for sections made in either steel or aluminum alloys of any particular strength level, in order to establish the weight effectiveness of foam filling. On a weight effectiveness basis, foam filling is primarily of value only in sections made from high density, low strength materials, e.g., mild steel. For mild steel foam filling becomes weight effective in sections having a thickness: section side ratio of less than .02 approximately. In the case of brittle materials, e.g., fiber reinforced plastics, foam filling promotes the crush stability of the structure. Such improvements in this stability may be the major need for foam filling in these sections and also in large, thin-wall metal sections. 1980 SA E Transactions 800082. Thin Wall Ceramics as Monolithic Catalyst Supports. J. S. Howitt, Corning Glass Works. New geometries for monolithic catalyst supports are described where the number of square cells per square inch is increased and the cell wall thicknesses are decreased. Catalytic cycle efficiencies are improved due to an increase in the geometric surface area and reduction in thermal inertia. Physical properties are discussed and the effect of the new structures on thermal shock resistance, melting, pressure drop, strength, coatability and catalytic activity are described. By 1981, it is expected that a major share of monolithic converters produced will have substrates of 400 or 600 squares/in2 and 0.006 inches thick walls. 800083. Development of More Active and Durable Au- tomotive Exhaust Catalysts. Michael V. Ernest and Gwan Kim, Davison Chemical Div., W. R. Grace &amp; Co., Columbia, MD. In response to the changing needs of the auto manufac- turers in meeting the more stringent emission standards legislated for 1980 and post- 1980 model years, beaded catalysts with improved activity and durability have been developed. This has been achieved largely as a result of modifying the physical characteristics of the alumina substrate. Changes in density, pore size distribution and geometrical surface area, coupled with improved tech- niques of distributing noble metals, have resulted in catalysts with significantly improved durability. Fur- thermore, we have been able to build into the catalysts added degrees of physical and thermal stability, while still maintaining catalyst performance. 800084. Improved Pelleted Catalyst Substrates for Au- tomotive Emissions Control. John R. Adomaitis, Jack E. Smith and David E. Achey, Exhaust Systems Engrg. Dept., AC Spark Plug Div. of General Motors, Flint, MI. An in depth analysis of the pelleted automotive catalysts from the 1975 General Motors Certification Fleet led to the development of a useful catalyst poisoning model. By optimizing three variables: pore volume and pore size distribution, precious metals penetration, and surface area, it was possible to design a more poison resistant catalyst. The application of these ideas resulted in a second generation of catalysts, introduced in 1978, which were characterized by better performance and greater durability. In order to meet 1980 and 1981 emissions require- ments, further improvements were required. To achieve this, two different variables were studied: geometric surface area and noble metal ratios. From the optimi- zation of these added variables there evolved several new catalysts which, after extensive engine dynamometer and vehicle testing, were selected for use on General Motors vehicles. 1980 SA E Transactions 32</page><page sequence="14">800087-800092 800087. The Effect of Inflation Pressure on Bias, Bias- Belted and Radial Tire Performance. B. L. Collier and J. T. Warchol, The B. F. Goodrich Co. A great deal of interest is being given to operating passenger tires at significantly higher inflation pressures to reduce rolling resistance. The use of higher inflation pressures, while reducing rolling resistance, will also affect other performance characteristics. The effect of inflation pressure on rolling resistance, tread wear, traction, bruise resistance and mechanical properties of bias, bias-belted and radial tires has been investigated. Inflation pressures from 16 to 48 psi (110 to 330 kPa) were used. At various test conditions radial tire rolling resistance was found to be 12-60% lower compared to the bias and bias-belted tires. The radial tire is less sensitive to load and pressure variations; therefore, its rolling resistance will remain more constant at high load and under-inflated conditions. The rate of rolling resistance reduction with increasing pressure diminishes and levels off at pressures above 40 psi (275 kPa). Treadlife increases with higher inflation pressures, but results in a disproportionate center wear condition on both bias and bias-belted constructions. Pressure varia- tions had little or no effect on traction. However, changes in cornering coefficient and aligning torque at higher inflation pressures will require tire/vehicle adjustments to achieve desired handling characteristics. 1980 SA E Transactions 800088. Theoretical Prediction of Test Variable Effects, Including Twin-Rolls, on Rolling Resistance. Werner W. Klingbeil, Uniroyal Tire Co., Uni- royal, Inc. A Deflected Tire/Rolling Resistance computer model to simulate free-rolling of a belted radial automobile tire against a flat surface is reviewed. The contact conditions are then extended to include rolling against a test wheel, and the effects of load, deflection, inflation pressure, and test-wheel curvature are investigated. The analyses are restricted to isothermal conditions at 25 °C. Both the tire force cycles and their contribution to rolling resistance are examined. The investigation concludes with an analysis of free-rolling against twin-rolls, predicting gross distortion of flat-surface and conventional test-wheel results. 800089. A Comparison of Laboratory and Highway Tire Rolling Resistance Tests. Nicholas M. Trivi- sonno, The BFGoodrich Company. Rolling resistance measurements on the 1.7m roadwheel and Clayton twin roll simulator, and outdoor fuel consumption and coastdown tests were compared for tires specially formulated to illustrate differences. Twin roll results correlated poorly with the other tests, especially for grouped radial and bias tires. Thermal analysis showed that the twin roll test accentuates the tread region more than the 1.7m test. Equations including tire type, tread hysteresis and sidewall hysteresis correlate twin roll results well with the other tests. Twin roll rolling resistance specifications may not result in minimum fuel consump- tion if these factors are not considered. 1980 SA E Transactions 800090. Effect of Ambient Temperature on Radial Tire Rolling Resistance. M. L. Janssen and G. L. Hall, Central Research Labs., Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., Akron, OH. A test procedure for measuring the rolling resistance of automobile tires under ambient temperature conditions ranging from -20°C to 40°C is described. A data analysis method for predicting tire rolling resistance in this temperature range from a minimum amount of test data is presented. The effect of changes in tire inflation pressure and material viscoelastic properties resulting from am- bient temperature changes is demonstrated for radial automobile tires with different tread designs and com- pounds. 1980 SA E Transactions 800091. (P-86) Computer Analysis of Fuel-Air Mixing in Direct-Injection Engines. A. D. Gosman and R. J. R. Johns, Mechanical Engineering Dept., Imperial College of Science and Technology (London/ England) . The extension is described of an existing multidimensional method of calculating in-cylinder air motion to the representation of the injection of a liquid fuel spray. Sample calculations are presented of the droplet and gas motion and fuel-air mixing in an axisymmetric repre- sentation of an open-chamber direct-injection engine, in the absence of combustion, and are believed to be the first in which a realistic representation of the gas-phase turbulence behaviour is employed. One of the more important findings is that the spray induces velocities and turbulence levels in the gas which are comparable to, and sometimes greater than, those produced by other mech- anisms such as swirl and squish. It is concluded however that considerable further work is required to make such models truly predictive and detailed experimental data is urgently required to assist this task. 1980 SA E Transactions 800092. (P-86) Turbulent Mixing Rate - Its Effect on Smoke and Hydrocarbon Emissions from Diesel Engines. J. C. Dent, Univ. of Technology, Loughborough, Leicestershire (England). The importance of turbulent energy dissipation rate on smoke and unburned hydrocarbon emission from Diesel engines has been identified quantitatively, the latter through a quenching mechanism which is predominant at idling and light load operation of the engine. A parameter has been derived to assess the contri- bution to unburned hydrocarbon emissions from various design and operational characteristics of an engine. 33</page><page sequence="15">800093-800099 Further experimental data are required to support the general validity of the parameter. 800093. (P-86) Effect of Burning Zone A/F, Fuel H/C on Soot Formation and Thermal Efficiency. Otto A. Uyehara, Mechanical Engineering Dept., Univ. of Wisconsin-Madison. In engine combustion chambers, where the overall fuel-air mixture is stoichiometric or leaner, the effect of localized pockets or zones of stoichiometric or richer mixture are presented. Possible explanations for the existence of CO, with soot in the exhaust are offered. Also the effect of localized zones of richer than stoichiometric have on the thermal efficiency are also presented. Experimental data from literature are used to support the ideas. 1980 SA E Transactions 800094. (P-86) Investigation into the Combustion of Water/Diesel Fuel Emulsions. R. J. Crookes, M. A. A. Nazha, M. S. Janota and T. Storey, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg., Queen Mary College, Univ. of London (England). The results of steady-flow combustion tests for emulsions of 5, 10 and 20% by volume of water at two pressures are compared with those obtained with diesel oil. A reduction in CO, H/C and soot concentrations are obtained with increase in water content. Results from a single cylinder 4-stroke diesel engine show a significant reduction in NOx emissions. Photographic examination of the burning spray for different water in diesel emulsions at atmospheric pressure indicates that an increase in water content increases the rate of combustion and reduces the luminosity of the ñame up to a critical value of water content. 800096. Relative Likelihood of Injury in Accidents as a Function of Occupant Size and Weight. S. H. Backaitis and D. Najjar, National Highway Traffic Safety Admin. The National Crash Severity Study (NCSS) data file was interrogated to determine whether occupants of different statures and masses are subject to different injury severity rates. The NCSS data was divided into four height and weight categories. Injury severity rates were calculated for each category. The data was also interrogated for occupant size effects relative to frontal and side impacts, male and female occupants, use or non-use of restraints, and driver and right occupant positions. To gain further insight into the injury severity rate sensitivity relative to occupants' statures and masses, the data was also reviewed from the point of view of body segment injury. The analysis shows little, if any, effect on the rates of injury severity due to either height or weight variations of the occupant. The evidence of no effect is very strong for frontal impacts and somewhat less for side impacts. A lower level of confidence in side impacts is caused primarily by substantial thinning out of the data at the extreme ends of the accident population distribution. Expansion of the analysis to include injury severity rates of body areas produced likewise no substantial evidence of height and weight dependency. 1980 SA E Transactions 800097. National Projections from NCSS Statistics. Phyllis A. Gimotty, Highway Safety Research Inst., Univ. of Michigan. This paper proposed to develop an estimate called a national projection from the NCSS data. It then evaluates the statistical properties of this estimate. Such an esti- mation procedure is applicable, under certain assump- tions, to study designs where the first stage sampling units are chosen purposively. National projections for accident statistics from the NCSS data are produced. The sensi- tivity of the national projections on the choice of first stage units and on the models used in the estimation procedure are investigated. All statistics in this paper are calculated from the first fifteen months of the NCSS data, January 1, 1977 to March 31, 1978. 800098. Anatomy, Injury Frequency, Biomechanics, and Human Tolerances. Donald F. Huelke, Univ. of Michigan Medical School; and John W. Melvin, Highway Safety Research Inst. The purpose of this literature review was to determine areas of automotive injury information that may add to knowledge of injury type, frequency, severity, and cause. This paper is a review of the literature concentrating on the period between 1965 and present. Literature on car, van, or light truck occupants has been reviewed for injury frequencies, types, and locations. Current experimental biomechanical articles are also included. A search was made for descriptions of injury frequency, restraint effectiveness, and the causes of specific injuries. Medical and engineering journals, texts, and books were reviewed. For convenience, this report is divided into sections by body region with an overview introduction on the anatomy of the specific region. 1980 SA E Transactions 800099. (SP-465) An Automatic Transmission for Au- tomotive Gas Turbine Power Plants. James C. Polak, Detroit Diesel Allison, Div. of General Motors Corp., Indianapolis, IN. The effects of the current fuel economy on public transportation has become of increasing concern. Looking over the facts and projections, it becomes clear that in order to improve the automotive fuel efficiency, industry needs to examine power train components and their effect on obtaining vehicle performance and efficiencies. A joint government-industry program was initiated to investigate the two-shaft gas turbine concept as an alternative to present-day automotive powerplants. Both were exam- ined, compared and evaluated on the basis of the federal 34</page><page sequence="16">800100-800105 automotive driving cycle in terms, of specific fuel/pow- er/speed characteristics of the engine and the efficiency and performance of the transmission. The results showed an optimum match of vehicle, gas turbine engine and conventional automatic transmission is capable of a significant improvement in fuel economy. This system offers many advantages that should lead to its wide acceptance in future vehicles. 800100. (SP-465) Transmission Concepts for a Passenger Car Single Shaft Gas Turbine Engine. Donald L. Carriere, Ford Motor Co., Dearborn, MI. This paper describes, by use of schematics, efficiency curves, and a brief discussion, twenty possible trans- mission concepts for a passenger car powered by a single shaft gas turbine engine. 800101. (SP-465) The Vadetec Inertial Driveline. S. Shih, E. G. Trachman and Y. Kemper, Vadetec Corp., Troy, MI. Significant improvements in automotive fuel economy have been demonstrated by performance simulation of vehicles using the Vadetec Inertial Driveline. The novel driveline arrangement based upon a continuously vari- able-ratio mechanical transmission and the strategy for controlling the powertrain are discussed in this paper. The influence of CVT speed ratio range and efficiency on fuel economy is studied. The results of the performance simulation for a typical vehicle equipped with the Inertial Driveline are shown. These results indicate a 44% improvement in fuel economy when compared with the performance of the same vehicle equipped with a con- ventional driveline operating on the same duty cycle. 800102. (SP-465) A Transaxle Design for a Traction Continuously Variable Transmission for Auto- mobiles. Charles E. Kraus, Traction Propulsion, Inc. A continuously variable, wide ratio range, traction transmission (CVT) is discussed as a transaxle design for automotive use. A configuration positively driving both wheels and eliminating a separate differential promises lower manufacturing costs, better vehicle performance and higher fuel mileage. The over 90% efficient and very quiet CVT depends on a traction design able to take a very high shock loading with a long maintenance free life. Traction requirements and solutions are discussed. Ap- plications to I.C., electric and hybrid vehicles explain the need for a CVT with a wide ratio range. 800103. The Laminar Burning Velocity of Isooctane, N-Heptane, Methanol, Methane, and Propane at Elevated Temperature and Pressures in the Presence of a Diluent. Thomas W. Ryan, III, Southwest Research Institute; and Samuel S. Lestz, The Pennsylvania State Univ. A constant volume bomb was used to determine basic combustion characteristics of isooctane, n-heptane, meth- anol, propane and methane. Results show that the laminar flame velocity of a quiescent homogeneous air/fuel mixture can be derived from pressure-time data in the bomb. The effects of pressure, temperature, and charge dilution on flame velocity and ignition are presented. A thermo-chemical kinetic model accurately predicted con- centrations of nitric oxide during combustion and in the burned gas. 1980 SA E Transactions 800104. Experimental Determination of the Flame Quenching Distance in a Spark-Ignition Engine. Svend Henningsen and Bj&lt;/&gt;rn Qvale, Laboratory for Energetics, Technical Univ. of Denmark. Samples of the gas from the vicinity of the wall of a spark-ignition engine operating on iso-octane has been obtained by the use of a hydraulically controlled high- speed gas-sampling valve (operating time 1 msec), during an earlier investigation. A theoretical model describing the flow through the gas-sampling valve is developed. This model is used to interpret the experimental data and to compute the thickness of the quenching layer (the quenching distance). The resulting quenching distance is in reasonable agreement with the results obtained by other investigators using different theoretical and experimental techniques. 800105. A Theoretical Model for Propagating and Quenching of a One-Dimensional, Laminar Two-Reaction Flame. Svend Henningsen, Lab- oratory of Energetics, Technical Univ. of Den- mark. A theoretical model has been developed describing the propagation of a laminar, one-dimensional flame in a combustion chamber. The model aims specifically at illuminating the processes surrounding the flame propagation in the vicinity of the combustion chamber wall and the extinc- tion of the flame (the quenching). The model assumes constant pressure for a two- reaction scheme with 6 chemical components (CnHm, 02, C02, CO, H20 and N2). The equations describing the conservation of energy, mass, and species constitute a system of coupled parabolic differential equations, which are solved through a finite difference scheme with 9 grid-points. The boundary conditions specify the prop- agation or quenching situation. Temperature as well as concentration profiles through the flame are computed. Flame velocities and quenching distances are com- puted for a range of air-fuel ratios, physical constants and properties, both for methane and iso-octane. The com- parisons between values of the quenching distances calculated with this model and experimentally determined values show acceptable agreement for air-fuel ratio above stoichiometric, but are somewhat low for air-fuel ratios below stoichiometric. 35</page><page sequence="17">800107-800112 800107. Mixing and Charge Preparation Effects in a Dual Chamber Stratified Charge Spark Ignition En- gine. S. C. Sorenson, J. J. Bruckbauer and G. R. Gehrke, Dept. of Mech. and Ind. Engr., Uni- versity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Ur- bana, IL 61801. Experimental studies have been performed on a three- valve, single cylinder stratified charge engine in order to determine the effects of main chamber intake port injection and main chamber swirl on performance. Results indicate that injection timing affects hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions but has little effect on NOx emissions and performance. Main chamber swirl, gen- erated through the use of an intake port mask, resulted in increased power, lower fuel consumption, lower carbon monoxide emissions, and higher hydrocarbon emissions at a given level of NOx emissions. Changes in performance and emissions with swirl were attributed to improved mixing in the main chamber and an increased rate of combustion. 1980 SA E Transactions 800108. Impact of Electric Cars on U.S. Petroleum Consumption. Michael M. Collins and Wayne M. Carriere, General Research Corp., Santa Barbara, CA. A computer model that forecasts electricity demand and capacity on an hourly basis for each major electric power company in the United States is used to analyze the potential impact of electric cars on national petroleum consumption in 1980, 1990, and 2000. The analysis, based on 1978 and 1979 growth projections by the industry, shows that if all cars were electrified in the year 2000, automobile petroleum use would be cut by 75 percent, saving 2.5 million barrels of crude oil a day, or 14 percent of future national petroleum consumption. Most cars could be charged overnight from otherwise idle coal and nuclear power plants. 800109. Efficiency of Coal Use, Electricity for EVs versus Synfuels for ICEs. H. G. Mueller, Gesell- schaftler Elektrischen Strassenverkehr mbH (Essen/Germany); and Victor Wouk, V. Wouk Assoc., New York, NY. Data are presented to show how electric vehicles will travel approximately twice as far per ton of coal burned to produce electricity for EV propulsion, than will an ICE vehicle burning the synfuel produced from an equal amount of coal. These figures are based on pessimistic calculations of the efficiencies of electricity generation, transmission, battery charging and EV drivetrains. The synfuel calculations are based on optimistic upper limits of coal conversion efficiency and ICE systems' efficien- cies. EVs are less harmful to the environment than conventional vehicles. The emissions from coal-burning power plants are more readily controlled than the pollutants from refineries that convert coal to synfuel. The emissions from EVs are negligible, whereas those from ICEs still have not been reduced to the levels originally mandated for 1976. Synfuels should be reserved mainly for those appli- cations for which electricity is impractical or impossible, such as planes, long-haul trucks and buses, and the petro-chemical industry. 800111. Impact of Electric Cars on National Energy Consumption. Paul D. Agarwal, General Motors Research Laboratories. The energy consumption of a small, limited-purpose electric vehicle and and an equivalent internal combustion engine vehicle is calculated starting from coal or oil as the prime energy source. The impact of electric vehicles on reduction of petroleum consumption versus that of converting oil burning electric utility boilers to coal is evaluated. 800112. Analysis of the Infrastructure for Recharging Electric Vehicles. Robert Kaiser, ARGOS As- sociates, Inc.; and Charles Graver, General Research Corporation. The mobility of the existing personal-vehicle fleet is provided by a refueling infrastructure consisting of petroleum refiners, distributors, and service stations. This paper identifies the equivalent infrastructure that would be required to support a fleet of electric vehicles (EV), and analyzes the current status in the United States of its major components. The components include the electric utility companies, the types of dwellings at which it would be practical to recharge electric vehicles overnight, and methods for providing range extension, i.e., additional vehicle range without overnight recharging. Many of these elements are already in place. The US utility industry has sufficient capacity to support at least 13 million EVs, if they are recharged at night. There are at least 20 million single-family homes where it would be possible to recharge an EV by adding a branch circuit and outlet with a rating of 230 volts at 50 amperes. This support is not uniformly distributed, however, and will depend strongly on the characteristics of the local housing stock. However, even with these elements in place, EVs are still range-limited and mobility is therefore still not equivalent to that of the existing personal-vehicle fleet. EV parity in mobility can be achieved only through range extension support, a major element of the refueling infra-structure for EVs that is currently missing. Three alternatives are examined: (1) transient recharging sta- tions, where the EV is recharged while the owner is at work, shopping, etc.; (2) battery swapping stations, which replace discharged with fully charged batteries; and (3) hybrid vehicles, which have a small Internal combustion engine (ICE) in addition to the electric engine, for range extension. 36</page><page sequence="18">800113-800118 It is shown that all three would extend EV range to that of an ICE vehicle. However, transient recharge stations, while of value for emergency recharging, would not be desirable for daily use. Battery exchange would be a feasible alternative once there were enough EVs on the road to support a battery leasing operation and a network of exchange stations. The range extension hybrid is a solution that would be able to utilize the existing ICE refueling infrastructure, but would require further tech- nical development, and would still depend, to a limited extent, on the availability of petroleum. 800113. (SP-462) Materials Availabilities in the 80's. John D. Morgan, Jr., Bureau of Mines, U.S. Dept. of the Interior, Washington, DC. Substantial portions of U.S. supplies of mineral materials are utilized in manufacturing motor vehicles. Motor vehicles in turn play important roles in the national security, mining, agriculture, and many other sectors of our economy. Improving motor vehicle efficiency, safety, and lessening environmental impacts is putting increasing pressure upon high-performance special property mate- rials. At the same time, aerospace and energy needs also are focusing upon many of the same materials. Many materials used in motor vehicles are classified as strategic and are imported from foreign sources of varying degrees of reliability. The U.S. maintains a stockpile of strategic materials, but this stockpile is intended for defense purposes. Consequently, motor vehicle manufacturers must pay increasing attention to assuring that production schedules are not disrupted by foreseeable and pre- ventable materials shortages. 1980 SA E Transactions 800114. (SP-462) Supply Prospects for Automotive Steels. William T. Hogan, S. J., Fordham Univ. At present, steel availability for the automotive industry is no problem. And assuming that automotive demand will increase in the future, steel availability should remain adequate despite the rise in foreign steel imports and a cut back in United States capacity. 800115. (SP-462) Aluminum Industry Five-Year Forecast - 1980-1984. Stewart R. Spector, Oppenheimer &amp; Co., Inc. This five-year forecast is based on what will be the most likely series of economic developments over the next several years, none of which anticipates an extreme or severe worldwide business recession similar to 1974-1975. Under the assumptions in the forecast, the long-term outlook for the aluminum industry is: (1) aluminum supply /demand will grow progressively tighter through 1983-1984, and (2) aluminum prices will trend higher at a rate faster than both inflation and production costs for the next several years. Through 1984 the demand for aluminum will be limited by the availability of new supplies of both primary and secondary sources of metal. This limitation will keep the international aluminum prices and the return on capital above the level necessary to justify new invest- ments in basic smelting capacity. Because of the improved industry outlook, many international aluminum compa- nies are seriously gearing up to initiate expansion programs over the next several years. However, due to the capital constraints, the construction time required for greenfield plants and the difficulty in locating economic power sources, major new aluminum capacity expansions through 1985 will be somewhat restricted. Also, unlike past expansion phases in the aluminum industry, there exist today substantial tonnages of in-place capacity which, because of soaring energy costs, have become economically obsolete. In the future these smelters could be dismantled or be mothballed, as has been the case in the Japenese aluminum industry, or quickly closed down during periods of soft demand. 800116. (SP-462) Outlook for the Availability of Auto- motive Plastics. John D. Young, Polymer Prod- ucts Dept., E. I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co., Inc. The same energy concerns which have promoted in- creased use of plastics have lead some to question their future availability since they depend on petroleum as raw materials. Plastics have an advantage of being less energy intensive in their manufacture than metals. During the transition period from oil and natural gas to coal for production of feedstocks, plastics should maintain a preferred position in allocation of fossil fuels on the basis of their economic benefit and end-use energy savings. Overall energy conservation, reduced gasoline consump- tion, and the switch to coal and other energy sources should aid plastics in meeting future automotive demand projections of 300 to 400 pounds per car by the late 1980's. 800117. (SP-462) Materials Availability for Automotive Applications-Copper, Lead, and Zinc. Robin G. Adams, Chase Econometrics. The auto industry is facing significantly tighter supply conditions and greater market instability for copper, lead and zinc in the Eighties. Lack of past investment in new mines, increased political intervention in the mining industry, the growing import dependence of the United States and greater reliance on terminal commodity markets will further compound the difficult purchasing environment. 800118.

Automotive Engine Control Sensors '80. William G. Wolber, Bendix Research Labs., Southfield, MI. The automotive engine control sensor art is the pacing factor in the introduction of microcomputer-based engine controls. The field remains in a transient state, with multiple engine control law philosophies, a wide variety of control parameters in use or proposed for use, and proliferation of sensing concepts for those parameters. This paper builds upon the author's 1978 SAE Trans- actions paper "A Worldwide Overview of Automotive Engine Control Sensor Technology," emphasizing sensor developments which have occurred in the meanwhile and indicating some trends which are becoming visible. New sensors for conventional control parameters are described, including a hybrid aneroid-semiconductor strain-gage manifold absolute pressure (MAP) sensor; a hot-wire anemometer air flowmeter; a ball-in-race, optical pickoff fuel flowmeter; and a new solid-state magnetic crank angle piezoceramic position detector. Piezoceramic and magnetostrictive knock sensors for knock limit governing loops, a thin-film NOx sensor, and oxygen sensors suitable for lean-burn engine control are discussed as sensors for new parameters. Work on sensors for electronic diesel engine control is mentioned, along with new engine control signals derived from crankshaft position sensing. Progress toward generating guidelines and specifi- cations in the sensor area is reported for the SAE Transducer Subcommittee of the Electronic Systems Committee; the SAE Emissions-related Electrical Equip- ment Subcommittee of the Electrical Equipment Com- mittee; the International Standards Organization Working Group 3, and the International Symposium on Auto- motive Technology and Automation (ISATA) Sensors Working Group. 1980 SAE Transactions 800122. The Magnetic Field Sensitive Transistor - A New Sensor for Crankshaft Angle Position. Leif Halbo and Jan Haraldsen, Central Inst, for Industrial Research (Oslo/Norway). A semiconductor sensor is described, suitable for indi- cating crankshaft angle or more generally any position which can be related to changes in a magnetic field. The sensor is based on a lateral P-N-P transistor which is sensitive to magnetic fields. Devices made in a standard analog IC process are presented and show the voltage sensitivity to magnetic fields to be up to 2 orders of magnitude larger than for a comparable Hall-element. The parameters most interesting for use in automo- biles are discussed: sensitivity, zero field offset, temper- ature effects and mechanical stress effects. 1980 SAE Transactions 800123. Magnetic Field Sensor and Its Application to Automobiles. Hisatsugu Itoh, Automobile Equipment Div., Mitsubishi Electric Corp. (Himeji/Japan). A direction sensor, which measures the terrestrial mag- netism and its application to automobiles is discussed. The flux gate type sensor proposed in this paper is sensitive and stable enough for automotive use. A new technique to compensate the car body magnetism is also discussed. The heading display system which consists of a direction sensor, a control circuit and a display device works quite well. A Trip Computer with more attractive features can be easily embodied by applying this sensor. 800124. A Wiegand Effect Crankshaft Position Sensor. J. David Marks and Michael J. Sinko, Echlin Mfg. Co. The Wiegand Effect has been applied as an ignition trigger in several configurations of automotive distrib- utors. Recent advances in the design of magnetic exci- tation systems for the Wiegand Effect have made possible considerable improvement in such distributors. The improved magnetic circuit has made possible the devel- opment of a crankshaft position sensor for deriving the top-dead-center and speed signals. The design lends itself to actuation by suitable notched discs, or directly from the teeth of the flywheel ring gear. 800125. A Concept of Input/Output Signal Processing for Microprocessor Engine Control Systems. Takao Sasayama and Takeshi Hirayama, Hitachi Re- search Laboratory, Hitachi, Ltd.

A new input and output (I/O) signal processing concept for microprocessor engine control systems is presented. An analysis of the relations between data resolution and control accuracy show that they are effected by sensor signal forms. The concept of a microprocessor engine control system with a specially designed I/O interface LSI is proposed. An output circuit with a structure that allows fast data processing and minimizes LSI chip size are also presented. 800126. Air Flow Sensing. Leonard P. Gau, Chrysler Corp.

Solid-State Automotive Liquid Level Sensing System. R. W. Tarpley, L. A. Rehn and K. C. Wiemer, Texas Instruments Inc., Dallas, TX. Accurate remote sensing or control of liquid levels is of interest in a variety of applications. A method capable of distinguishing between the presence and absence of liquid at a discrete level by monitoring the rate of heat transfer from a solid-state sensing element is discussed; a detailed description is given of the silicon sensor and the associated electronic circuitry. Small size (0.50 X 0.50 X 0.15mm3) and low thermal conductance mounting of the active element assure precise level determination and rapid response, while an auto-referencing scheme used in the circuit permits reliable operation over a wide tem- perature range. Three versions of the system are de- scribed, each suited for different types of level sensing applications. Suggested among the possible uses are a number of automotive applications such as crankcase, transmission, and brake fluid measurements. 800128. Dual-Element, Solid-State Fluid Flow Sensor. L. A. Rehn, R. W. Tarpley, K. C. Wiemer and K. M. Durham, Texas Instruments Inc., Dallas, TX. The theory, design and operation of a solid-state fluid- flow sensor are presented together with some results of laboratory evaluations. Two silicon sensing elements, mounted inside a cylindrical tube and connected through a resistance bridge, are maintained at a constant temper- ature differential with one element at the temperature of the fluid, providing a reference. The magnitude of flow can be determined from the heat transfer rate off the hotter of the two elements. Flow rates between about 2 and 40 liters/hr may be resolved with the present sensor arrangement. Dynamic range and resolution can be adjusted for particular applications by varying the values of the fixed bridge resistors, thus varying the temperature differential between sensors, or by varying the tube diameter. The measurement of fuel flow is a potential application. 1980 SA E Transactions 800129. Auxiliary Drive Systems for Aerial Devices. David Stephen and David Sullivan, ALTEC Industries, Inc., Birmingham, AL. Significant advancements have been made in the devel- opment and application of more fuel efficient and cost effective auxiliary drive systems for powering aerial man lift equipment as used by the electric utility and telecom- munications industries. Small gasoline powered engines and self-contained battery operated hydraulic systems not only reduce overall fuel consumption and contribute favorably to the ecological needs of the community, they reduce overall fuel and maintenance costs dramatically. 800130. The User's Approach to Fuel Economy Through Utility Fleet Vehicle and Equipment Specifica- tions. Harvey Siegel and G. L. Palinkas, Ontario Hydro. A survey taken of utility fleets throughout the United States and Canada indicates that most are taking action to reduce fuel consumption through specification and op- erational activities. One fleet's experience and results with mid-range diesels is given, showing substantial benefits over gasoline engines, especially in power take-off oper- ation. Additional fuel reductions are possible by speci- fying smaller automobiles and smaller engines with manual transmissions in vans and pickups. 800132. A Critical Comparison of Hot-Wire Anemometry and Laser Doppler Velocimetry for I.C. Engine Applications. Peter O. Witze, Combustion Ap- plications Div., Sandia Labs., Livermore, CA. Hot-wire anemometer and laser Doppler velocimeter measurements have been taken in a motored reciprocating engine and compared to assess the validity of hot-wire measurements. The procedure used to account for the sensitivity of the hot wire to changes in the gas temper- ature is extensively investigated. The results presented show that for the optimum conditions of known flow direction, low turbulence level, and low compression ratio, the hot-wire anemometer can provide useful mean velocity results. Accurate hot-wire turbulence intensity measurements appear to be possible only for the intake and exhaust strokes. 1980 SA E Transactions 800133. The Nature of Turbulent Flame Propagation in a Homogeneous Spark-Ignited Engine. Edward G. Groff and Frederic A. Matekunas, Engine Research Dept., General Motors Research Lab- oratories, Warren, MI. This work relates flame speed to turbulence in a homogeneous-charge spark-ignited engine. A quartz- piston engine, using both shrouded and nonshrouded valves with four spark locations, was operated over a range of engine speed and spark timing in order to generate large variations in flame frontal area, turbulence, and pressure. Burning velocities were determined from pressure-time data using a diagnostic sphérical-flame model and are compared to hot-wire turbulence meas- urements. The resulting correlation for burning velocities throughout the engine cycle is compared to existing flame theories, published turbulent flame data, and proposed turbulent flame models for S.I. engines. 1980 SA E Transactions 800134. A Tracer Technique for Measuring Gas Motion in a Fired Diesel Engine Cylinder. A. J. Jessel, Chevron Research Co.; and G. L. Borman, Univ. of Wisconsin - Madison. A diagnostic technique for determining fluid motion and mixing in fired heterogeneous internal combustion engine 39</page><page sequence="21">800135-800139 cylinders was developed and tested on a single-cylinder, open-chamber diesel. A rapid-acting valve was used to inject a small quantity of radioactive tracer, argon-41, into the combustion chamber at a given location and crank- angle, once per cycle. A fast-acting sampling probe was used to map the movement and dispersion of the tracer. Data was taken for both fired and motored conditions at low engine speeds. The data showed the technique can be used to quantify gross fluid motions such as swirl and identify manifestations of turbulent mixing. 800135. An Experimental and Analytical Study of Engine Fuel Spray Trajectories. James F. Sinnamon, David R. Lancaster and John C. Steiner, Gen- eral Motors Corp. An analytical spray model is described which can be used to calculate the penetration and trajectory of a spray in an engine combustion chamber with air swirl. The model consists of integral continuity and momentum equations written for a steady-state gas jet. The model contains adjustable entrainment and drag parameters evaluated from experimental data. A special single-cylinder, see-through engine and a schlieren optical system were used to study transient liquid fuel sprays under varied conditions. These exper- imental observations were used to determine appropriate values for the adjustable parameters in the spray model. Comparisons between model calculations and the exper- imentally observed sprays are presented for a wide range of conditions. 1980 SA E Transactions 800136. Raman Spectroscopy and Flow Visualization Study of Stratified Charge Engine Combustion. Sheridan C. Johnston, Sandia Laboratories, Livermore, CA. Transient, precombustion fuel/air ratios at the spark plug electrode gap in a DISC engine have been measured using cw laser Raman spectroscopy and have been correlated with mixture ignitability measurements. From these measurements, it was found that with decreasing quan- tities of injected fuel there was a general trend towards decreased peak equivalence ratio, a delay in fuel arrival at the spark electrode gap, and a narrowing of the crank angle duration over which mixture ignition was possible. Lean inflammability limits determined from the ignition study suggested a dual-ignition mechanism which depended on the rate of change of equivalence ratio with crank angle. Flow visualization of the stratified charge combustion revealed substantial differences in mixture burn characteristics and combustion duration as the ignition crank angle was varied. Quenching of the burning mixture was observed and its occurrence was correlated with the Raman measurements. 1980 SA E Transactions 800137. Temperature and Density Measurements in an Engine by Pulsed Raman Spectroscopy. J. Ray Smith, Combustion Applications Div., Sandia Laboratories, Livermore, CA. Measurements of temperature and nitrogen density and the fluctuations of these quantities have been made in a combusting engine. The measurements were made by applying pulsed, spontaneous laser Raman spectroscopy. This nonintrusive technique demonstrates one cubic millimeter spatial resolution and essentially instantaneous temporal resolution (108 second). Densities were deter- mined by measuring the Stokes vibrational scattering of nitrogen, and the temperatures were determined by measuring the ratio of anti-Stokes to Stokes scattering. The diagnostic technique is described and its accuracy analyzed. Temperatures and densities at two locations, over crank angles covering the compression and expansion strokes, for four equivalence ratios are presented. Typical temperature probability distributions are also presented. 1980 SA E Transactions 800138. Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Spectroscopic Probe of Combustion. K. A. Marko and Lajos Rimai, Ford Motor Co., Dearborn, MI. It has already been demonstrated that ordinary Raman Spectroscopy can be used to measure multicycle averaged air/fuel distributions in suitable single cylinder engines with gaseous fuel and to measure concentrations of major stable species in laboratory flames. However, in hostile environments with relatively poor optical access, in the presence of fluorescing constituents of ordinary gasoline it will probably be necessary to use a more sophisticated technique known as Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Spec- troscopy to obtain concentrations and temperature dis- tributions. The advantages of this technique to be described are its high signal output, excellent spatial and temporal resolution (single pulse measurements are possible), reduced optical access requirements and im- munity from fluorescence interference. Means of imple- menting the technique with such high resolution, as well as results from measurements on a stable flame system are presented. 800139. Comparison Tests Between Some Full-Scale European Automotive Wind Tunnels - Pininfa- rina Reference Car. A. Cogotti, Pininfarina Research Centre; R. Buchheim, Volkswagen AG; A. Garrone, Centro Ricerche Fiat; and A. Kuhn, Daimler Benz AG. A correlation test program between four European full-scale automotive wind tunnels has been performed on a passenger car modified in five different rear-end configurations which cover most of the present passenger cars. 40</page><page sequence="22">800140-800144 The aim of this program was mainly to evaluate to what extent the aerodynamic drag coefficients, measured in these four different wind tunnels, are reliable and therefore can be used for technical or legislative purposes. The correlation program was extended also to the other force coefficients, that is, lift and side forces, and to the pressure distributions. Tests were carried out at different speeds from 90 to 150 Km/h and at different yaw angles ß from - 50° to + 50°. The comparison shows a generally good agreement between the results of these four tunnels, the differences for tests at ß = 0° being, in terms of the standard deviations, in the order of ±2% as regards the drag coefficient, ±0.025 and ± 0.011 as regards the front and rear lifts. The agreement seems to be satisfactory also for force measurements in side wind conditions and for pressure measurements. 1980 SAE Transactions 800140.

U. Nilsson, Volvo. Comparative aerodynamic force measurements on a full scale notchback type vehicle have been performed between six European companies operating prominent full scale automotive wind tunnel facilities. The results obtained with 8 different vehicle configurations show a remarkably good correlation between the drag coefficients measured in the various wind tunnels. Pressure distri- butions also show an acceptable agreement. The com- parison of front axle lift measurements revealed differ- ences between the various wind tunnels; these differences are partly explainable. Six component measurements also show a satisfactory correlation between the various wind tunnels except where lift does contribute to the forces or moments. Suggestions to extend these correlation tests are presented. 1980 SA E Transactions 800141. Datsun 280ZX - Integration of Aerodynamics and Appearance. Kazuhiko Yoshiyuki, Tatsuo Maeda, Michitoshi Takagi and Motoo Yana- gawa, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. It is essential for today's sports car to have excellent aerodynamic characteristics and a sophisticated style. These factors are dependent and often inconsistent with each other. It is desirable that they are integrated rather than compromised in such cases. In the early stages of development of the 280ZX, we thoroughly investigated the relationship between a style and its aerodynamic characteristics. A three-dimensional smoke tunnel and a 1/5-scale model was used for this purpose. Several improvements were examined mainly on the front end of the model, which strongly affect both aerodynamic characteristics and styling, such as the hood, bumper, chin spoiler, engine-compartment opening and others. The resultant values of the principal aerodynamic coefficients of the realized 280ZX are CD = 0.385, Clf = 0.11 and CYM = 0.04 (CD and CLF at a yaw angle of 0 degree and CYM at 10 degrees). In addition to the above-mentioned aerodymanic characteristics, wind noise, ventilation efficiency and engine-compartment cooling performance were also developed. 800142. Aerodynamics of Six Passenger Vehicles Ob- tained from Full Scale Wind Tunnel Tests. Jeffrey R. Hogue, Systems Technology, Inc., Hawthorne, CA. This paper presents the results of aerodymanic meas- urements made on six full scale vehicles in a large cross section wind tunnel. The vehicles included a sports car, subcompact sedan, intermediate-sized sedan, two vans, and a full-sized station wagon. Criteria for the selection of the wind tunnel facility is described. Aerodymanic data is then presented as non-dimensional lateral and longitu- dinal coefficients for yaw angles between +40 to -180 deg. Results are compared to previous model and full scale tests. 800143. Development and Calibration of an Aerodynamic Disturbance Test Facility. Richard H. Klein and Henry R. Jex, Systems Technology, Inc., Haw- thorne, CA. This paper summarizes the development of an aero- dynamic disturbance test facility that can be used to study the influence of crosswind disturbances on road vehicle handling. A literature review of ambient wind meas- urements and wind tunnel tests was combined with preliminary analysis to develop the requirements for a low cost, transportable, easy to operate, rugged, test facility. The final product consists of 8 independent crosswind modules, capable of providing a relatively constant 35 mph gust over 120 ft test length. Arranging the modules in an uneven fashion can provide a variable velocity profile over 230 ft test length. Each module consists of a controllable speed 58 hp gasoline engine driving an 8 ft diameter, 6 bladed propeller. Special ducting and ad- justable exit vanes allow for flow redirection and expan- sion. Remote control of each module's fan speed and engine ignition can be accomplished from individual remote operating stations. 1980 SAE Transactions 800144. Results of a Test for Undervebicle Corrosion Resistance (SAE Task Force, Iron and Steel Technical Committee, Div. 32). R. J. Neville, 41</page><page sequence="23">800145-800151 Task Force Chairman, Dominion Foundries and Steel, Ltd. (Hamilton/Ontario). A new standard test method has been developed for an Undervehicle Corrosion Test. The test was developed to provide a reliable comparison of corrosion resistance of coated steels in an undervehicle deicing salt environment. Results are detailed in this report, comparing six test materials, which confirm that the test is reproducible. 1980 SA E Transactions 800145. Corrosion Under Paint Film of Various Galva- nized Steels. H. Takahashi and Y. Shirogane, Technical Research Lab., Nihon Parkerizing Co., Ltd. (Tokyo/Japan); and K. Matsudo, T. Adaniya and M. Omura, Fukuyama Research Lab., Technical Research Center, Nippon Kokan K.K. (Fukuyama/Japan). Long term corrosion test for more than 10,000 hrs by means of salt spray test and special cycle test were conducted to study the corrosion resistance of various painted galvanized steels generally used as corrosion resistant materials, in which hot dip galvanized, electro galvanized, galvannealed and cold rolled steel are in- cluded. The results are as follows: (1) Galvannealed steels are most excellent in corrosion resistance through paint film in both corrosion testings. The reason is considered as follows: Steel under paint film shows clear acid-alkali distribution and galvanized steel does strong alkali after long time exposure. Whereas galvannealed steel shows only neutrality in PH. Special cycle corrosion test is one of the most valuable corrosion testing methods. And it is concluded that wet-dry cycle and freezing are important factors for corrosion test. 1980 SA E Transactions 800146.

Comparative Corrosion Behavior of Electroplated and Clad Metal Coatings. Robert Baboian, Electrochemical and Corrosion Lab., Texas Instruments Inc., Attleboro, MA. The comparative corrosion behavior of noble metal coatings prepared by roll bonding (cladding) and elect- rodeposition is discussed in this paper. Advantages and disadvantages of these materials are listed in order to show where one material system is preferable in a specific application. In addition to the mechanisms of corrosion, examples are described and test results are shown to demonstrate the differences in behavior of clad metal and electrodeposited materials. 800148. Effect of Surface Cleanliness on Paintability of Cold-Rolled Steel Sheet. E. J. Oles and B. M. Perfetti, U.S. Steel Research Lab, Monroeville, PA. A study was conducted to examine processing factors important to the formation of surface carbon on cold- rolled steel sheet and to investigate the relationship between surface carbon and paint performance in salt- spray tests. The results show that less surface carbon was pro- duced on coils annealed in an HNX atmosphere than on coils annealed in a DX atmosphere. Electrolytically cleaning sheet prior to annealing resulted in low levels of surface carbon, but the paint performance of this sheet depended on the paint system used. In general, the statistical correlation between salt-spray corrosion ratings and surface-carbon level was relatively strong for sheet annealed in HNX, null for sheet annealed in DX, and sensitive to the paint system used. Effect of surface cleanliness on paintability of cold-rolled steel sheet. 1980 SA E Transactions 800149. Theoretical and Practical Considerations of Sheet Steel Surface Cleanliness. T. W. Fisher, R. A. lezzi and J. M. Madritch, Research Dept., Bethlehem Steel Corp., Bethlehem, PA. Paint failure on cold-rolled sheet steel occurs by cathodic delamination of the paint film. Steel exposed at discontin- uities in the paint coating becomes the anode of an electrochemical corrosion cell, and adjacent areas under the paint become the cathode of that cell. Highly alkaline conditions are created under the paint severely weakening the coating system bond at the pretreatment/steel inter- face. Nonuniformly distributed amorphous surface car- bon contamination is primarily responsible for the variable paint performance observed. Adjusting mill practices in pickling, tandem rolling, and annealing resulted in improved steel surface cleanliness. 1980 SA E Transactions 800151. (SP-463) Static and Dynamic Offtracking of Articulated Vehicles. James E. Bernard and Marty Vanderploeg, Michigan State University. The subject of offtracking has been considered as a low speed phenomenon, amenable to analysis via small mechanical models or straightforward calculations. This paper views offtracking from a high speed as well as a low speed vantage point. A mathematical model with one 42</page><page sequence="24">800152-800156 degree of freedom is used to show that there is a speed, well within the routine driving range and independent of radius, at which there will be no offtracking in a steady turn. At higher speeds the trailer will track outside the steady turn circle, and at lower speeds the trailer will track inside the steady turn circle. The analysis indicates similar behavior in a lane change maneuver - small offtracking was found to occur at the steady turn zero-offtracking speed, and larger offtracking was found to occur at both higher and lower speeds. 1980 SA E Transactions 800152. (SP-463) Nonlinear Stability and Response of Car-Trailer Combinations. D. L. Taylor, Sibley School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engi- neering, Cornell University, Ithaca, N.Y. The technique of quasilinearization (describing function analysis) is used to study the effects of saturation of lateral tire force based on the traditional slip law concept. Due to trailer swing velocity, the dynamic slip angle is shown to be greater than the trailer angle. Thus nonlinear results are important even for small displacements. Significant changes in frequency and damping ratio from linear values are shown for the transient response of a one degree of freedom model. The forced response is shown to be of the classical left-leaning softening type, with jump/drop phenomenon. A two degree of freedom model is shown to have a very small amplitude limit cycle for operation above the critical velocity. Conversely, a three degree of freedom model is shown to have no stable limit cycle above the critical velocity. Thus, response above critical velocity appears to be unbounded. Also, an unstable limit cycle encloses the stable part of the equilibrium solution, providing a possibility for un- bounded response below critical velocity. 1980 SA E Transactions 800153. (SP-463) A New Coupling Hitch for Car-Trailer Combinations Which Eliminates Swaying. D. Tesar and G. K. Matthew, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida. During the summer of 1970, a new trailer hitch was designed which effectively removes the dangerous yaw oscillation between car and trailer. The device is a simple linkage which places the "virtual" hitch point at the center of mass of the towing vehicle. This hitch point placement decouples the fundamental mode of energy interchange between the two vehicles greatly increasing the overall safe speed of operation. Experimental evidence shows that this new coupling passively desensitizes the system from driver error or from poor loading procedures. Even under the worst operational conditions, the system remained stable at very high speeds (such as 80 MPH). A brief review of the literature provides additional analytical verification of these results. That the proposed hitch design solves an important safety problem is clearly demonstrated by the fact that existing car-trailer systems are known to be 4 to 6 times more unsafe than the car alone. 800154. (SP-463) Experimental Investigation of Tire- Roadway Interaction. Thomas R. Kane, De- partment of Mechanical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, California; and Raymond G. Fossman, AMF Harley-Davidson Motor Co., Milwaukee, Wisconsin. An experimental investigation was undertaken to explore tire-roadway interaction. The rear assembly of a motor- cycle served as a vehicle whose motion was studied when the frame was constrained to rotate about a fixed vertical axis while the wheel was in contact with a moving belt. This led to plots of frame angle versus time that could be compared with corresponding plots produced by using four analytical models of tire-roadway interaction. 1980 SA E Transactions 800155.

Weir, Principal Consultant, Systems Technology, Inc., Hawthorne, California. Motorcycle braking test procedures and results are presented. Both straight line and combined cornering and braking maneuvers were used. Test conditions included various initial speeds, turn radii, surface skid numbers, and levels of braking effort for two instrumented motor- cycles. The effect of braking on transient yaw response in turns is demonstrated, also. Overall, the results show that repeatable safety related response and performance measures can be obtained using the prescribed procedures with expert test riders. 1 980 SA E Transactions 800156. (SP-463) A Nonlinear Study of the Steady - State Turning Behavior of Car - Trailer Systems. Fidelis O. Eke, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Tuskegee Institute.; and Thomas R. Kane, Department of Mechanical Engi- neering, Stanford University. The equations governing the steady-state turning behavior of car-trailer systems are derived without linearization in any of the motion variables and with full consideration of lateral and longitudinal load transfer. Furthermore, the wheel-roadway interaction forces are expresssed as non- linear functions of tire slip angles. The resulting system of variously nonlinear and transcendental equations is solved numerically for a specific vehicle system, and the principal results are condensed into a carpet plot, which can be used as a handling diagram. 1980 SA E Transactions 43</page><page sequence="25">800157-800169 800157. (SP-463) Development of Maximum Allowable Hitch Load Boundaries for Trailer Towing. Richard H. Klein and Henry T. Szostak, Sys- tems Technology, Inc., Hawthorne, California. This paper presents an analytically based approach to specifying a maximum allowable hitch load for passenger cars pulling trailers. The change in tow car steady-state directional stability, i.e., understeer, is the basis for the specification. This handling parameter is a function of hitch load, lateral acceleration, tow car to trailer weight ratio, and the amount of load leveling applied by a Class III hitch. Using these variables an allowable hitch load range was defined as that which would insure positive tow car understeer up to and including 0.3 g cornering. Over 50 combination-vehicle configurations (using three tow car sizes and eight trailers) were then tested in order to validate and revise the analytical boundaries. Based on these results a tow car stability criterion derived from maximum hitch load considerations appears a valid format for the trailer user and/or manufacturer. 1980 SA E Transactions 800158. (SP-463) Comparison of the Behavior of Artic- ulated Recreational Vehicles with Either Fixed or Position Control of Steering. D. B. Johnson and J. C. Huston, Engineering Science and Me- chanics Department, Engineering Research In- stitute, Iowa State University, Ames, Iowa 50011. The use of a subset of the complete equations of motion to determine the lateral stability of an articulated vehicle is considered. It is shown that, with fixed steering, the path of the vehicle diverges from the nominal path even when each eigenvalue associated with the subset of equations has a negative real part. A linear steering law is introduced which is shown to be effective in controlling the path of the vehicle. It is shown that critical speed is significantly affected by the addition of steering control. With control, critical speed can be higher, lower, or about the same as it is without control. Four different articulated vehicles are treated. The powered vehicle in each case represents a mid-size American car, and the towed vehicles represent utility, boat, travel, and horse trailers. It is shown that trailer swing oscillations can be excited when the path of the car is controlled. 1980 SA E Transactions 800161. (SP-463) Effect of the Normal Force Dependence of Cornering Stiffness on the Lateral Stability of Recreational Vehicles. J. C. Huston and D. B. Johnson, Engineering Science and Mechanics Department, Engineering Research Institute, Iowa State University, Ames, I A 50011. One of the most important parameters in a vehicle dynamics model is tire cornering stiffness. Recently, Bergman has developed a quadratic expression relating cornering stiffness and normal load by correlating tire test data from four different sources. This quadratic expres- sion, as well as linear and constant approximations of it, are used in lateral stability analyses of a car and of a car/trailer system. It is shown that the change in cornering stiffness with normal load does significantly affect critical speed. 1980 SA E Transactions 800164. Throttle Body Fuel Injection (TBI) - An Integrated Engine Control System. Lauren L. Bowler, Emission Control System Project Cen- ter, Engineering Staff, General Motors Corp., GM Proving Grounds, Milford, MI. Presented is a technical description of the significant features of the General Motors developed Throttle Body Fuel Injection System in production on the 1980 Cadillac Eldorado and Seville passenger cars. TBI fuel system discussion is divided into the 69 kPa (10 psi) fuel system, injector performance, fuel pump, sensors, electronic control module and system fuel control philosophy based upon speed density. Since achievement of low operating pressure for the fuel injection system is a significant technical accom- plishment, the TBI fuel system design to accommodate hot fuel conditions will be reviewed. 1980 SA E Transactions 800165.

Goble and H. S. Mashigian, Chevrolet Motor Div., General Motors Corp., Warren, MI. With the ever increasing pressures of competition, eco- nomics, consumerism and regulatory requirements, man- agement must continually seek to improve their prod- uct/process. Modifications are implemented in order to move towards an optimal operating level which will satisfy all consumer and government requirements and still be economically sound. As part of the management team, the quality profes- sional must satisfy these obligations, but with additional handicaps. Primary among thses are the enigmatic nature of quality and the existence of misleading 'folklore'. This paper will discuss how management can over- come these obstacles and satisfy their requirements by the proper formulation and application of quality (improve- ment) goals. The steps necessary to develop and imple- ment these goals are provided and explained. 800172. Methods for Improved Accuracy in Measurement of Process Capability. David P. Greeneisen, Kelsey-Hayes Co. Several statistical methods are reviewed which can be used to ensure valid conclusions in capability studies for manufacturing processes. The methods that are described enable the observer to detect time-related effects in the data, to determine whether the observed characteristics are behaving as normally distributed variables and to correct data which have an induced grouping error. In studying manufacturing capability, these methods can be used in the analysis to determine if corrections are required to account for the effects. 800173. An Assessment of the Accuracy of Weibull Graph Paper as a Prediction Tool. Leonard R. Lamber- son, Dept. of Industrial Engrg. and Operations Research, Wayne State Univ., Detroit, MI. Estimating product life from laboratory or field test data is a frequently encountered problem. One popular ap- proach to handling this problem is through the use of Weibull graph paper. However, the accuracy of prediction is difficult to determine, since it involves the engineer, the graph paper, and the statistical variability of the popu- lation. This paper presents the results of a study to determine the accuracy that can be expected in typical Weibull plotting and estimating situations. The study was based on designed experiments utilizing typical engineers to provide estimates. The results provide guidance in the selection of sample size and assessment of prediction accuracy. 800174. Microcomputer Programs Useful for Aspects of Accident Reconstruction. Robert L.

The first, APPLETRAJ, is oriented toward discovery of the initial conditions required of a skidding vehicle to match trajectory evidence. The second, APPLECRASH, uses sets of geometric, inertial and energy absorbing vehicle parameters to interpret the crush shapes of a pair of crashed vehicles into a value for the system linear impulse. From the impulse the Del ta- Velocity and the Delta- Omega of each vehicle are found. In addition, the peak forces that the model uses are presented. Both programs feature graphics screen prompting of input and feedback of geometries, kinematic information and final reporting. 1980 SA E Transactions 800176. Side Impacts: A Comparison of Laboratory Experiments and NCSS Crashes. J. W. Melvin, J. O'Day, K. L. Campbell, D. H. Robbins and D. F. Huelke, Highway Safety Research Inst., Univ. of Michigan. Selected side-impact cases from the National Crash Severity Study (NCSS) were studied to determine simi- larities and differences between actual crashes and laboratory (sled) crash tests. Sled tests simulating side impact have been conducted almost exclusively at a 90° impact angle, so the NCSS cases analyzed were those with a near-side occupant and a reported 3 o'clock or 9 o'clock impact vector. Of the 91 cases studied, 51 were judged comparable to the laboratory situation. The remainder generally involved cars struck at a point remote from the passenger compartment, and often involved considerable rotation of the vehicle. Injuries for the 51 cases were tabulated by crash severity (Delta V) and were judged to be quite similar to those observed in laboratory (sled) tests at a slightly higher Delta V. Brief notes are appended con- cerning each of the reviewed cases. A less detailed analysis of a broader set of side collisions (2-4 o'clock and 8-10 o'clock) was also con- ducted to further illuminate the findings of the detailed case review. 45</page><page sequence="27">800178-800184 800178. A Test Machine for the Determination of Tire Energy Dissipation Over Transient Driving Cy- cles. G. F. Hayhoe and G. B. Bucek, The Pennsylvania State Univ. A flat belt tire test machine is described which was designed to measure tire energy dissipation under con- ditions simulating a vehicle being driven over a sequence of EPA driving cycles. The machine has two tires loaded against each other across one span of a continuous steel belt running on steel drums. One of the tires is driven by a DC chopper controlled motor programmed to reproduce the speed history of the driving cycles. Tire force and speed voltage signals are multiplied in an analog multi- plier and then integrated to find the energy passing into and out of the tires. 800179. Thermal Conductivity Measurement of Tire Ma- terials. LeRoy E. Wickliffe and Alan L. Browne, Engineering Mechanics Dept., General Motors Research Laboratories, Warren, MI. The interest in improving vehicle fuel economy has prompted the development of a computer model to predict the power loss of a rolling tire, This model will allow rapid evaluation of the effects of various tire geometric and material properties on the tire power loss. This work describes methods of measuring the thermal conductivity of tire materials, which is just one of the data base inputs required by the model. At the outset, two criteria were established for selecting the thermal conductivity measuring instrument. It should 1) allow the testing of small samples removed from a tire and 2) allow the measurement of thermal conductivity at different temperatures. The latter would allow evaluation of the temperature effect on thermal conductivity, something which is not well reported in the literature. A survey of the available equipment was made, an instrument was acquired, and an evaluation/development program was initiated. Several instrument deficiencies were noted and are reported, along with the modifications made to reduce or eliminate the effects of operating environment and operator technique on the results measured. Some auxiliary equipment needed to help reduce variability of the results is also described. Values of the thermal conductivity of some typical rubbers are given. 800180. A Test Fixture for Measuring Dynamic Hyster- etic Energy Loss in Tire Materials. Yogesh K. Doshi and Leroy E. Wickliffe, General Motors Research Laboratories, Warren, MI. A new Hysteretic Materials Test System (HYMATS) has been developed to study energy loss in tire materials. The test facility is designed to subject a tire material specimen to a series of loading profiles. The signals for the displacement and the force experienced by the test specimen are monitored and recorded for further analysis. The hysteretic energy loss can be calculated from the force and displacement data. The test apparatus is capable of conducting the tests under tensile or compressive load. The test facility, its associated electronic control system, its performance characteristics, and its safety features are described in this paper. 800181. Analysis of Tire Deformation in Operation from the Data of Temperature Rise. D. C. Prevorsek, Y. D. Kwon, R. K. Sharma and C. W. Beringer, Corporate Research Center, Allied Chemical Corp., Morristown, NJ. Knowledge of the deformation amplitude of the tire components during the actual running is important in the analysis of the fatigue process of the tire components. Attempts to imbed strain gauges in the tire carcass to measure the deformation met difficulties due to the alteration of carcass properties in the process of imbed- ding the strain gauges. In this article, we describe an attempt to estimate the tire deformation in operation from the data of temper- ature rise. Measurement of the temperature rise is considerably easier than the measurement of the defor- mation. The temperature data are analyzed by considering the dynamics of self-heating which includes the heat generation rate terms. From the temperature rise, the corresponding heat generation rate is determined and then this is translated to the corresponding deformation of tire components by use of the data of viscoelastic hysteretic loss of the components which are determined in labo- ratory in advance by use of a high strain dynamic viscoelastometer. Examples of the analysis are illustrated. The defor- mation determined by this procedure shows consistent correlations with the load, speed and carcass modulus. 800184. (P-86) Analysis of Automotive Particulate Sam- pling Techniques. K. G. Duleep, Energy and Environmental Analysis, Inc., Arlington, VA. The accurate sampling and characterization of automotive particulate emissions is important to quantify any poten- tial threat to human health. EPA has issued a draft recommended practice to measure the total weight of particulates emitted over the FTP, but there are many parameters that are uncontrolled or can be varied within the scope of the draft recommended practice. The parameters were separated into two catagories: those affecting particulate formation and those affecting partic- ulate sampling. The variables under the former category were identified as tailpipe conditioning and heat transfer, dilution ratio, and mixing rate. Test data on the effects of each of these variables on measured particulate emissions are presented and analyzed. The variables under the latter category were identified as the tunnel configuration, sample probe and sample line, and the type of filter used for sampling. Only the filter type was identified as having 46</page><page sequence="28">800185-800190 a significant effect on measured particulate emissions, and test data on filters is presented and analyzed. 800185. (P-86) Experimental Measurements of the In- dependent Effects of Dilution Ratio and Filter Temperature on Diesel Exhaust Particulate Sam- ples. J. Scott MacDonald and Steven L. Plee, Engine Research Dept., General Motors Re- search Laboratories, Warren, MI; James B. D'Arcy and Richard M. Schreck, Biomedical Science Dept., General Motors Research Lab- oratories, Warren, MI. A dilution mini-tunnel is described that allows collection of diesel exhaust particulate samples with independent control of the dilution ratio and the sample filter temperature. This tunnel was used to determine the individual effects of these two tunnel operating variables on the samples collected from a single-cylinder indirect- injection test engine run at constant speed and load. Either increasing the filter temperature at fixed dilution ratio or increasing the dilution ratio at fixed filter temperature resulted in a decrease in total particulate mass. These changes in total mass were attributed to changes in the soluble fraction of the particulate sample. 1980 SA E Transactions 800186. (P-86) Some Mechanisms Affecting the Mass of Diesel Exhaust Particulate Collected Following a Dilution Process. Steven L. Plee and J. Scott MacDonald, Engine Research Dept., General Motors Research Laboratories, Warren, MI. Previously measured particulate mass concentrations from a single-cylinder indirect-injection diesel, obtained under conditions of both varying dilution ratio and varying filter temperature, are examined in detail. Considering the mechanisms of condensation, adsorption, and diffusion, the observed variations in total particulate mass are attributed primarily to the adsorption and desorption of exhaust hydrocarbons on the solid particulate matter. A simple Langmuir adsorption model is used to explain qualitatively the observed effects of dilution ratio and sample temperature. Only under conditions of relatively high hydrocarbon emission is the condensation mecha- nism also shown to be important. The simple adsorption analysis also predicts the trends observed in CVS (Constant Volume Sampling) dilution tunnels in which filter temperature and dilution ratio change simulta- neously. 1980 SA E Transactions 800187. (P-86) Diesel Exhaust Particle Size Distribution Measurement Techniques. D. F. Dolan, D. B. Kittelson and D. Y. H. Pui, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg., Univ. of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN. Diesel exhaust aerosol particle size measurements have been made by three techniques and compared. The techniques used were based on electrical mobility, dif- fusion, and inertial separation. The instruments used were a Thermo Systems Incorporated (TSI) Model 3030 Electrical Aerosol Analyzer, TSI Model 3040 diffusion battery in conjunction with a TSI Model 3020 Conden- sation Nucleus Counter, and a University of Minnesota micro-orifice impactor (0.1 jam cut size). Particle samples were also examined by electron microscopy and volatile fractions were determined by vacuum sublimation. Meas- urements were made on two engines, one direct injection and one indirect injection swirl chamber. Engine oper- ating conditions were chosen to give a wide range of exhaust particle characteristics. The size measurements agreed well in the regions of instrument overlap. Meas- ured number mean diameters varied from 0.01 jam to 0.1 jam. Total particle number concentrations measured with the electrical aerosol analyzer and the condensation nucleus counter were also in good agreement. 800189. (P-86) Effect of Particulates on the Measurement of Oxides of Nitrogen in Diesel Exhaust. Tanvir Ahmad, Engine Research Dept., General Mo- tors Research Laboratories, Warren, MI. Presence of soot in gas analysis systems is believed to cause errors in measurement of the concentration of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) because of adsorption of NOx by soot. The work reported herein involves a preliminary experimental and theoretical analysis to determine the extent of the errors caused by the interaction of NOx with soot suspended in diesel exhaust measurement systems. The experimental results, which are in qualitative agree- ment with the theory, suggest that at room temperature the percentage of NOx adsorbed by soot suspended in the exhaust stream is a function of the residence time of the gas sample in the sample line. Therefore, a short sample line and a high flow rate would minimize the error in the measurement of NOx. Application of the model to a production passenger-car diesel engine tested on the Federal Test Procedure and using the standard Constant Volume Sampling system indicates that the error in NOx measurement attributable to adsorption by soot is neg- ligible. 1 980 SA E Transactions 800190.

(SP-465) A Comparison of Gas Turbine Concepts Proposed for Automobiles. Robert A. Mercure, U.S. Department of Transportation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. With the passage of the Automotive Propulsion Research and Development Act of 1978 (Public Law 95-238), the government has made funding available to supplement industry in long term-high risk Research and Devel- opment (R&amp;D) on advanced automotive propulsion systems. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), which had a number of on-going programs in alternative automotive powertrains, has been chartered to carry out the intent of the Act. One of the programs sponsored by DOE has been in Advanced Gas Turbines (AGT) suitable for automobiles with high fuel economy, low exhaust gas emissions and the ability to operate on alternative fuels. This program is the outgrowth of government supported R&amp;D in automotive gas turbines dating back to 1972. It is currently in the beginning phase of two major contracts awarded in late 1979. This paper traces the history of these efforts and compares the AGT design concepts proposed by the two teams comprised of AiResearch/Ford and General Mo- tors' Detroit Diesel Allison/Pontiac Divisions. Also, compared are four selected design concepts resulting from study contracts which preceded the AGT program. 800194. (SP-465) Predicting the Reliability of Ceramic Turbine Components. John L.

Brief Status Summary for Automatic Speech Recognition at the Start of the 80's. Janet Maclver Baker, Dialog Systems, Inc. Automatic speech recognition has demonstrated high capability, first in the laboratory and now in field operations. This summary presents the characteristics of today's research and commercial systems, and discusses issues and trade-offs affecting their performance. Inde- pendently conducted tests of Dialog System's new speaker dependent, real time continuous speech recognition system demonstrated 99.5% word recognition accuracy in a task with a vocabulary of 10 digits plus 10 control words. The words were spoken by 5 speakers (3 male, 2 female) in a variety of regional American dialects against a background of heavy machine clatter and other noise. 800196. Task-Oriented Approaches to Automatic Speech Recognition. A. E. Rosenberg, J. L. Flanagan, S. E. Levinson and L. R. Rabiner, Acoustics Research Dept., Bell Labs, Murray Hill, NJ. We describe several computer-implemented systems for automatic speech recognition. The systems are designed for specific communication tasks in which the human talker and machine interact in a disciplined dialog. One speaker-dependent system recognizes individual spoken words and provides information on airline flight sched- ules. The same system, combined with a programmed syntax analyzer, recognizes whole sentences that are chosen from a sub-set of natural English. Another system provides automated telephone directory assistance by recognizing voiced-spelled names and speaking back the requested telephone number. Still another system rec- ognizes digits spoken by any speaker, and provides the capability for automatic voice dialing. All the speech recognition systems utilize dynamic programming to match spoken input with stored reference templates. The reference templates for each vocabulary word are con- structed from linear predictor coefficients (LPC) which are measured over word utterances. We give performance data for the systems when they are operated over conventional dialed-up telephone connections. 800197. Low Cost Voice Response Systems Based on Speech Synthesis. Richard Wiggins, Texas In- struments, Dallas, TX. A recent advance in speech synthesis technology is the integration of a complete speech synthesizer onto a single integrated circuit. This chip is the basis for several low cost "talking" consumer products. Speech is synthesized from stored digital information extracted from actual speech signals. Memory requirements are approximately 1200 bits per second or 800 bits per word. This devel- opment offers the potential for including voice response into a wide variety of applications at a very low cost. 800198. Self-Organized Continuous Speech Recognition. Frederick Jelinek, Continuous Speech Recog- nition Group, Computer Sciences Dept., IBM T. J. Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, NY. This paper describes an experimental approach to con- tinuous speech recognition being carried out at IBM Research. It is based on statistical methods that allow automatic extraction of recognizer parameter values from speech data. Research results are presented for both artificial and natural recognition tasks. 48</page><page sequence="30">800199-800213 800199. Voice Data Entry Systems - An Effective Management Tool - NOW. Ron Belle, Thresh- old Technology Inc. Voice data entry systems are achieving productive and effective results NOW. Although the future will provide many changes to this technology which will reduce the costs, make them easier to use, etc., many companies have taken advantage of what can be accomplished through practical approaches to their application requirements. Since nothing available today is fully perfected, those who wait for perfection are missing out on improving their operations and profits. Much can be learned by evaluating how voice data entry systems have been utilized by creative management personnel. 800201. Vehicle Testing of Near-Term Batteries. Robert C. Conover, Keith S. Hardy and Joel J. Sand- berg, Jet Propulsion Lab., California Inst, of Technology, Pasadena, CA. A series of vehicle tests of Near-Term nickel-iron, nickel-zinc, and lead-acid batteries were conducted by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in support of the Department of Energy's Electric &amp; Hybrid Vehicle Technology Demonstration Program. The tests, which consisted of constant speed and SAE J227a driving cycles, demon- strated significant range improvement relative to current lead-acid batteries, but identified development deficien- cies in the Near-Term Batteries. Deficiencies in the state-of-the-art vehicles used for the tests were also identified during the course of testing. 800204. "Biberonnage" Makes an Electric Car Practical with Existing Batteries. H. -G. Mueller, Gesell- schaft fuer Elektrischen Strassenverkehr mbH (Essen/West Germany); and V. Wouk, Victor Wouk Assoc., New York, NY. Tests made with a converted Audi show that a "45 km (27 mi) range" vehicle can be driven over 100 km (60 mi) in a day if the batteries are charged when the vehicle is not in use (such charging is called "biberonnage" by the French). The tests were conducted in an urban area, with the vehicle making frequent short trips, characteristic of urban driving missions. Advantage is taken of the fact that during such driving, the effective speed is only 30 km/h (20 mph). Graphs are presented for calculating the vehicle range in a given number of operating hours, with different assumed average speeds, and different assumed battery charging rates. It is shown how a range of 160 km (100 mi) per day can be achieved with existing batteries, employing biberonnage. Biberonnage allows the use of a battery pack lighter than normally employed, thus reducing vehicle weight, initial and operating costs, and energy consumption (Wh/km). With biberonnage, electric cars can be intro- duced in large numbers rapidly. We need not wait for the "100 miles range" battery to make the EV commercially acceptable. 800205. Improved Method for Determining Roughness Peak Count on Cold-Rolled Steel Sheet. T. G. Nilan, U.S. Steel Corp. The methods of measuring roughness peak count on cold-rolled sheet are discussed. The amplitude depen- dence of the present recommended peak-count practice is determined. A new method of peak counting that is independent of roughness amplitude and readily cali- brated is proposed. 800208. Effect of Sheet Surface Roughness and Painting Variables on Painted Sheet Appearance. T. G. Nilan, B. M. Perfetti and B. J. Scialabba, U.S. Steel Corp. The painted appearance of shot-blast-textured (SBT) and electric-discharge-textured (EDT) automotive cold-rolled steel sheets was determined and related empirically to surface roughness parameters, phosphate coating weight, and paint thickness. The results were used to establish the ranges of average roughness and peak count necessary for acceptable painted appearance. 1980 SAE Transactions 800209. Epoxy Adhesives for Automotive Assembly Op- erations. Justin C. Bolger, Amicon Corp., Lex- ington, MA. This paper describes several new epoxy adhesives and bonding processes specifically developed for high volume, low cost automotive assembly operations. The applica- tions include halogen-quartz headlamps; assembly of a variety of under-the-hood electrical and electronic com- ponents; a one component epoxy body solder used since 1971 to replace lead in the exposed body joints of taxicabs and other vehicles; and low temperature curing, flexible epoxy adhesives used to increase the strength of steel body joints of school buses and other "rivet bonded" structures. 800210. Automotive Adhesives - Past, Present and Future. Gerald L. Schneberger, General Motors Institute, Flint, MI. The history of the use of adhesives in automobile manufacturing is reviewed. Special attention is paid to the apparent increase in interest in adhesives by automotive engineers in recent years. Developments in adhesive resin technology are discussed in the light of the changing nature of automotive materials from the early 1900's to the present time. Projections are made for probable developments in the technology of automotive adhesives. 800213. Maximum and Probable Fuel Economy of Au- tomobiles. H. P. Marshall, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State Univ. Claims by the inventors of carburetors, and other devices, that their designs produce very large and dramatic 49</page><page sequence="31">800215-800224 increases in the miles per gallon (MPG) attained by passenger cars are refuted. The maximum steady state values possible as limited by the Laws of Thermody- namics are calculated. 800215. Effect of Vehicle Design Variables on Top Speed, Performance, and Fuel Economy. Russell W. Zub and Ralph G. Colello, Dept. of Transportation, Transportation Systems Center, Research and Special Programs Administration, Cambridge, MA. Several parameters which affect the fuel consumption, performance, and top speed of a vehicle are vehicle weight, tire rolling resistance, aerodynamic drag and driveline configuration. Studies have indicated that it is possible to change each of these parameters to reduce the fuel consumption of a vehicle. However, the resulting performance characteristics must also be evaluated over the range of any changes. The purpose of this paper is to assess these vehicle design variables with respect to top speed, performance, and fuel economy. Six vehicles representative of 1978-1979 small, mid- size, and large automobiles and light duty trucks were selected for this study. By utilizing a vehicle simulation program the vehicles were run over the FTP urban and highway drive cycle schedule, and various performance schedules. The results are evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively with respect to the sensitivity of the dependent variables to changes in the independent variables. The most important factor when using the above changes in fuel economy and performance for a given vehicle change is to be cognizant of the range of vehicle design variables from which the performance and fuel economy changes were derived. 800216. The Good (?) Old Days. A. C. Gullon, J. C. Polak and S. M. Dubuc, Mobile Sources Div. Environment Canada. Eighteen vehicles ranging from a 1938 Dodge to a 1965 Mustang were tested to determine their fuel economy and exhaust emissions relative to today's vehicles and today's driving conditions. The 1979 models are getting about 10% better fuel economy over the urban cycle and 20% better over the highway cycle than the older vehicles. The reasons for these differences as well as the exhaust emissions from the older vehicles are also discussed. 800221. A Study on Drum Brake Noise by Holographic Vibration Analysis. A. Felske, G. Hoppe and H. Matthäi, Research and Development Div., Volks wagen werk AG (Wolfsburg/West Ger- many). Holographie analysis of vibrations on squealing drum brake systems is a useful method to localize vibration sources on drum brake components. The results described in this paper are obtained by combinations of holographic as well as classical vibration measurements. This report describes experiments and illustrates how results in preventing brake squeal can be obtained, and used as a logical basis for the efficiency of this method. As a consequence easier principles for suppression of brake noise can be developed. Experiments carried out on three different types of rear brake systems show that the main part of noise (1 to 2 kHz) is transmitted by the backing plate. Improved constructions without any tendency to squeal are dem- onstrated. A main result of this new testing method is that the observations and experiments carried out are of a general nature and so they are easily transferrable to other brake noise problems on drum brake systems. 1980 SA E Transactions 800222. Reducing Low Temperature Wax Plugging in Fuel Systems of the Diesel Passenger Car. J. W. Muzatko, Chevron Research Co., Richmond, CA. As diesel passenger cars become more popular in North America, more information is needed about low temper- ature fuel requirements. Two different make diesel passenger cars were tested in a temperature-controlled chassis dynamometer facility. The cars were started and driven using No. 2 diesel fuel (with and without flow improver additive) at a series of temperatures that included satisfactory operation as well as wax plugging and stalling. Simultaneous observations were made of fuel system temperatures and pressures and the vehicle's ability to perform a driving-cycle test. Removal of a screen in the fuel tanks was found to lower the operability temperature substantially. 800223. Cold Weather Fuel Requirements of Oldsmobile Diesels. Brian Y. Taniguchi and Jack D. Benson, Fuels and Lubricants Dept., General Motors Research Labs., Warren, MI. Two Oldsmobiles with 5.7 L diesel engines and one with a 4.3 L diesel engine were tested to determine the effect of the low temperature properties of diesel fuel on opera- bility (cold-start and warm-up driveability). Startability limits ranged from -18°C to -24°C and were unaffected by cetane quality of the fuel within the range of 39 to 50 cetane numbers. With untreated fuels, the cars would not operate when the fuel temperature fell below the cloud point of the fuel because wax crystals precipitated from the fuel and plugged the fuel tank filter. Low temperature operability was extended as much as 10°C by the use of fuel flow improver additives and a modified vehicle fuel system. 800224. Winterization of Diesel Fuel Systems in Large Coal Mining Haul Trucks. J. W. Muzatko and K. A. Frost, Chevron Research Co., Richmond, CA; and C. C. Bishop, AM AX Coal Co., Gillette, WY. 50</page><page sequence="32">800225-800239 This work shows how winterized diesel-powered mining vehicles can operate on No. 2 diesel fuel at low winter temperatures without using No. 1 diesel fuel as a diluent to lower cloud point. A study of low temperature fuel requirements was made during the 1976-1977 winter. Fuel system temper- atures were compared to ambient temperatures and vehicle operability. Once the diesel equipment was warmed up and operating, fuel system temperatures remained high enough that wax plugging did not occur with No. 2 diesel fuel. Based on this data, a recirculating fuel system heater was designed to be used while vehicles were shut down and parked. This approach was successfully tested during the 1978-1979 winter. 800225. Automotive Fuels - Refinery Energy and Eco- nomics. D. K. Lawrence, D. A. Plautz, B. D. Keller and T. O. Wagner, Amoco Oil Company, Naperville, Illinois. Automobile manufacturers need information on refinery energy use and economics to identify the engine(s) that achieve maximum vehicle miles from limited petroleum resources. To provide this information, we modeled a modern refinery producing varying amounts of auto- motive diesel fuel and producing gasolines covering a wide range in octane quality. Refinery energy consumption averages about 8% of the crude input. It declines very slightly with increasing diesel fuel production and rises slightly with increasing gasoline octane number. However, differences in fuel energy utilization among engines are much larger than the variations in refinery energy use. When engine effects are considered, the highest vehicle miles per barrel of crude are achieved with gasoline having an Antiknock Index of 88-90 RM/2 and with maximum use of diesel vehicles. 800228. Aluminum Bumper Systems for U.S. Passenger Cars. Michael A. Glagola and Glenn E. John- son, Reynolds Metals Co. A discussion of aluminum bumper systems, alloy data fabrication performance, and costs are presented. Weights and costs of similar steel, aluminum, and urethane face systems are compared and the effect of weight savings on costs and fuel economy is determined. Areas for product improvements are explored. 800230. Light Truck Aluminum Frame Development. B. Frank Boehm, Chevrolet Motor Div., General Motors Corp.; and David E. Hatch, Reynolds Metals Co. This paper discusses the development of an aluminum pickup frame fabricated on steel production tools as it relates to fuel economy, vehicle design, material selection, frame component fabrication, frame assembly, truck build, proving ground tests and program conclusions. 800231. Sheet Aluminum Wheels. Donald A. Fauth, Reynolds Metal Co.; and I. C. Scott, Reynolds Metals Co. The history of the development of sheet aluminum wheels, including alloy selection, properties, and tests are dis- cussed. A number of alloys were considered for wheel application. The strain hardening characteristics, the excellent corrosion resistance and other property criteria led to the selection of 5454 as the sheet aluminum wheel alloy. 800233. Design Criteria for Automotive Components Using the Aluminum Impact Process. Charles H. Wright, Cliff Impact Div., Parker Hannifin Corp.

Large Area Liquid Crystal Display for Automo- bile. Kenji Horikiri, Torahiko Ando, Hiroshi Yamane and Hirotsugu Arai, Products Devel- opment Lab, Mitsubishi Electric Corp. (Ama- gasaki/Hyogo/Japan). An instrument panel of a large area liquid crystal display (LCD), including a 50 segment bargraph speedometer, a six digit odo/trip/tacho meter, two gauges and several warning indicators, has been developed. The LCD cell evaluated for this instrument panel is operated in a reflective twisted nematic mode and dimensions of the cell are 260 X 110x3 mm. The liquid crystal material is capable of operating over a wider temperature range from -30 °C to 80 °C and the response time is less than 1 second at -20°C without heaters. The LCD instrument panel can display in multi-color by using high performance dichroic polarizers. Finally feasibility of the large area LCD instrument panel is investigated. 800236. Speech Synthesis - Technology and Applica- tions. Richard W. Kovener, National Semicon- ductor Corp. Advancements in speech synthesizing techniques com- bined with the increasing level of semiconductor inte- gration have made possible new and novel applications for digital speech synthesis. One of these applications is in an automotive vehicle. A voice synthesizer designed into a vehicle's instrumentation system can provide the driver with verbal information on the vehicle's operation for improved safety and performance. 800239. Recent Developments in Liquid Crystal Display Technology. Keith Riordan, Optoelectronics Div., Fairchild-Schlumberger. This paper reviews advances made in the state of the art of twisted nematic field effect Liquid Crystal Displays from 51</page><page sequence="33">800240-800244 an automotive designer point of view. The extension of glass frit sealing techniques to larger displays and the advent of polarizing films that are able to maintain efficiency after prolonged exposure to heat and humidity have contributed to the displays' long term life and reliability. Likewise the development of liquid crystal fluids capable of operating over a wide temperature range results in performance features which are close to automotive requirements. Finally the paper discusses some multiplex drive techniques using currently available drive circuits. The intent is to show practical methods of reducing pin count without serious loss of performance. 800240. Response and Accuracy Limitations for a Fuel Level Based Distance-to-Empty Calculation. D. R. Sendelbach and T. J. Wood, Ford Motor Co. With appropriate signal conditioning, it is possible to estimate Distance-to-Empty utilizing only fuel level and distance sensors. The relationship of speed of response to changing driving conditions and the accuracy of the calculated value is a function of fuel tank/fuel sensor design and driving conditions. 800241. Coordinate Dimming of Electronic Displays. Eric M. Knight, Ford Motor Co. Coordinate Dimming is a digital method of controlling the brightness of an electronic display. It provides a signif- icantly greater number of brightness steps than other digital dimming methods, and is especially useful for implementing non-linear dimming patterns. 800242. Use of High Strain Dynamic Viscoelastometer in the Analysis of Tire Rolling Resistance. Y. D. Kwon and D. C. Prevorsek, Corporate Research Center, Allied Chemical Corp., Morristown, NJ. Experimental measurement of rolling resistance of a tire requires the costly procedure of building the tire and testing it on a wheel testing machine. Therefore, in the development stage, it is desirable to have a simpler procedure for relative comparison of the rolling resistance as the function of the design variables. In this article, use of a high strain dynamic viscoelas- tometer for this purpose is described. By use of the results of measurements made with the viscoelastometer on the specimen which is either from a tire or from a laboratory- molded experimental sample, we analyze the comparative level of rolling resistance of the tire which comprises the specimen. It is shown that the procedure provides a means of carrying out a preliminary screening of materials and design of tire construction fast and inexpensively. Prin- ciple underlying the procedure is to deduce the overall energy loss from the running tire from the energy loss of a small segment of the tire under cyclic deformation which is similar to the actual deformation of the tire wall. Examples of the analyses using this method are illustrated together with the description of the procedure involving the use of the high strain dynamic viscoelas- tometer. 800243. A Tread-Deflection Measurement System Util- ized in Tire Hydroplaning Studies. W. Benson, U.S. Coast Guard Academy, New London, CT; J. J. Henry and W. S. Adams, Pennsylvania State Univ., University Park, PA. There have been several methods developed to measure film thickness, but most are not practical because they require physical disturbances of the material or flow by probe insertion. The tread-deflection measurement system was developed to investigate the transient response of a sliding tire as it encounters a change in free waterfilm thickness. The system is capable of measuring transient deflection changes in the contact region of a tire within one millisecond intervals. The system consists of seven capacitive sensors which are fixed to the inside surface of a tire and control the frequency output of integrated function generators which will accurately measure vari- able-induced displacements of less than 250 micro-inches. This system provides data in a form which enables evaluation of tire footprint shapes as a function of time for both steady state and transient hydroplaning conditions. 800244. Test Automation for Tire Force and Moment Measurement. G. L. Hall, R. R. Ackerman and J. F. Siegfried, Central Research Labs., Fire- stone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., Akron, OH. The advantages of a fully automated computer controlled force and moment operational procedure are reduced manpower requirements, increased machine efficiency and improved repeatability and precision in obtaining data. These advantages are especially important when considering the needs of the automobile manufacturers. Existing apparatus and test procedures at Firestone for determining cornering force, self-aligning torque and rolling resistance have been additionally mechanized through computer usage along with a complex hydraulic control system. These enhancements have sharply im- proved the control operation and, of course, collection and reduction of the data. A test that may consist of a tire warm-up and a series of wheel loads and slip angles is well suited to automation. The computer used has a mass storage device which is capable of keeping the various routine procedures on file for quick recall, also the accurate control logic permits the setting of close tolerances for both time and operational conditions. Another advantage for this system is the ability to repeat a procedure without changing the operational sequence. Data collection through the high speed acquisition system allows for the sampling of sufficient data to give a time averaged value. The use of the time average technique to obtain data is like using a filter that 52</page><page sequence="34">800245-800252 effectively reduces electrical noise and machine vibra- tions. Upon completion of the operational function of the force and moment apparatus, the data are analyzed. A polynomial surface analysis is used to obtain cornering force and self-aligning torque as a function of tire load and slip angle. These results can be displayed in tabular and/or graphical form. 800245. Development of a Flat Surface Tire Testing Machine. W. J. Langer and G. R. Potts, MTS Systems Corp. A low speed continuous belt, flat surface tire testing machine has been developed to perform force and moment tests on automotive and light truck tires. The machine is known as the Fiat-Trac™ Tire Testing Machine. The design and development of the machine is presented including discussion of machine geometry, belt tracking, belt support bearing, machine controls and the multi-axis load transducer. The specifications and capac- ities for the machine are also presented. 1980 SA E Transactions 800246. Statistical Amplitude Distribution Analyzer. L. Carenzi, F. Celeri and A. Chiesa, Industrie Pirelli S.p.A. (Milan/Italy). The system enables the amplitude distribution of variable quantities to be obtained even for long distances or time intervals. Main parts are: input transducers (of acceleration, forces, etc.), trigger connected with wheel revolution, amplitude analyzer, memory and printing unit. The memorized data can be elaborated in various ways, in order to facilitate any further data reduction. An onboard prototype, directly supplied by the vehicle battery, has two channels divided into - 32 level bands. Typical field of application is the evaluation of the "degree of driving severity" of vehicles on various roads and circuits. This offers a basic knowledge for fatigue evaluations and road test duplications, to reproduce actual road conditions. 800247. Development of a Truck Wheel Force Trans- ducer. C. A. Lysdale, Maritime Dynamics, Inc.; and R. R. Hegmon, Federal Highway Admin. A wheel force transducer has been developed for meas- urement of 3-axis wheel loads on large trucks under dynamic test conditions. Alternate truck tire sizes can be used in either single or dual wheel configurations, and the sensor can be mounted in driven, non-driven, or front (steering) wheel locations. Preliminary calibration data and functional test results are presented for the devel- opmental unit. 800249. Twin Roll Tire Dynamometer. R. G. McNall, Ford Motor Co. A new tire test facility which simulates tire operation on emission twin roll chassis dynamometers has been devel- oped. This paper describes the physical characteristics as well as the test capabilities of the new Twin Roll Tire Dynamometer which includes powered and free rolling tire testing. The facility's primary function is to research tire behavior on twin roll dynamometers in order to determine which tire parameters are important to energy consump- tion. Examples of some typical tire test data obtained on this facility are also presented. 800250. A New Approach to Load Regulation of Tire Endurance Testing Machines. Ariel Stiebel and Ken L. Bine, Uniroyal Tire Co., Div. of Uni- royal, Inc.; and Joergen Lynsgaard, Ford Motor Co. Analysis of tire behavior during endurance tests led to the development of a unique automatic loading system for tire endurance testing machines. Compared to commercial systems, the described system is lower in cost, consumes considerably less power, and performs at a higher level of efficiency and reliability. Because of its straight forward design and ruggedness, down-time as experienced with sophisticated hydraulic systems is practically nonexistent. Additional electronic circuits provide means to detect abnormal test conditions. 800251. (P-86) Some Rudiments of Diesel Particulate Emissions. C. A. Amann, D. L. Stivender, S. L. Plee and J. S. MacDonald, General Motors Research Laboratories, Warren, MI. In the future the fuel-efficient passenger-car diesel faces difficult particulate emission standards. To provide a foundation for understanding this problem, four aspects of particulate production in such an engine are considered - the combustion environment for soot formation, the phenomenological mechanisms involved, in-cylinder oxi- dation of soot, and the effects of exhaust dilution on the particulate mass collected on a sampling filter. Where significant experimental results from diesel engines are lacking, appropriate non-engine experience is reviewed to contribute additional insight. In the concluding section some practical implications are drawn for the diesel engine. Discussion: W. W. Wong, Cummins Engine Co., Inc. 1980 SA E Transactions 800252. (P-86) Soot Formation and Oxidation in Diesel Engines. H. Hiroyasu, M. Arai and K. Naka- nishi, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg., Univ. of Hiroshima (Hiroshima/Japan). In order to obtain a fundamental understanding of how soot forms and burns up during combustion in diesel engines, the relation between exhaust smoke level and combustion duration in direct injection diesel engine was measured. The effect of different injection timings, engine speeds and loads on combustion duration are presented 53</page><page sequence="35">800253-800260 and discussed. Combustion experiments in the less complex environment of a continuous spray open flame were performed from which soot samples were collected at various locations in the flame. By use of a special technique was obtained information on the mechanism of soot formation and oxidation which could not be obtained from engine experiments. The similarity of soot formation and oxidation within diesel combustion chamber and continuous spray open flame are discussed. An analysis of these results shows that the exhaust smoke level is mainly determined by the concentration of soot at the time of exhaust valve opening, i.e. combustion duration is very important. The net soot release in a diesel engine cylinder, for a given fuel, is controlled by the amount of soot oxidation and the rate of combustion. Discussion: Nicholas Barsic, John Deere Product Engrg.

Takeyuki Kami- mo to, Yuzo Aoyagi, Yukio Matsui and Shin Matsuoka, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg., Tokyo Institute of Technology. The rate of air entrainment into the flame and the rate of heat release are thermodynamically calculated in a DI diesel engine: A two-zone model is proposed which uses as input data three measured values of cylinder pressure, flame temperature, and injection rate. The correlations between both rates under various conditions make it clear that the combustion during early and main periods of diffusion combustion is mainly controlled by air entrain- ment into the flame. The effects of injection pressure, piston configuration, and swirl intensity on the air entrainment are also studied. And the extent of mixing in the flame is evaluated by the equivalence ratio in the flame which is also obtained by the same model. The trends of exhausted NO and soot concentrations well correlate with the equivalence ratios in the flame and measured flame temperatures under all conditions stud- ied. 1980 SA E Transactions 800254. (P-86) A Gas Sampling Study on the Formation Processes of Soot and NO in a DI Diesel Engine. Yuzo Aoyagi, Takeyuki Kamimoto, Yukio Matsui and Shin Matsuoka, Tokyo Institute of Technology. The concentration of soot, NO and the other combustion products were measured by incylinder gas sampling in a DI diesel engine. The effects of injection timing, swirl ratio, and combustion chamber geometry on the forma- tion and emission processes of soot and NO were studied. The following results were obtained: (1) Soot is promptly formed in the flame during the early combustion period where the equivalence ratio in the flame is high over 1.0. Thereafter almost all the formed soot is swiftly burned up by oxidation during the middle combustion period. This process mainly determines the exhaust soot concentration. (2) NO is formed in the flame during the early and middle combustion period where the flame temperature is high over 2000 K. The highest NO concentration is observed at the flame tip swept by the air swirl. Though the concentration of the formed NO decreases by dilution it is nearly constant during the later combustion period. For this reason the concentration of exhaust NO is almost completely governed by the formation process. 1980 SA E Transactions 800256. (P-86) The Contribution of Engine Oil to Diesel Exhaust Particulate Emissions. William J. Mayer and Donald C. Lechman, Analytical Chemistry Dept., General Motors Research Laboratories, Warren, MI; and David L. Hilden, Fuels and Lubricants Dept., General Motors Research Laboratories, Warren, MI. A radioactive tracer technique was developed to deter- mine the contribution of oil from an engine sump to exhaust particulate matter collected on a filter. The technique was applied to particulate emissions produced by an automotive diesel engine which was operated on an engine dynamometer over a range of steady-state con- ditions. The results indicated that from 1.5 to 25 mass percent of the particulate matter, depending on speed and load, consisted of material from the engine oil. The oil contribution to the extractable organic portion of the particulate matter ranged between 16 and 80 percent. 1980 SA E Transactions 800258. Investigation of the Octane Rating and Autoig- nition Temperature of Methanol-Gasoline Blends. Roberta J. Nichols, The Aerospace Corp. The octane rating and autoignition temperature of methanol-gasoline blends were measured. Large increases in autoignition temperature and ignition delay time were found for small percentages of added methanol. These increases correlated well with the increases in research octane rating throughout the range of blends. The evaporative cooling effect of the methanol was concluded to be the major mechanism suppressing detonation. 800260. Driving Cycle Economy, Emissions and Photo- chemical Reactivity Using Alcohol Fuels and Gasoline. Richard Bechtold, U.S. Department of Energy; and J. Barrett Pullman, Univ. of Santa Clara. An oxidation catalyst equipped vehicle and several three-way-catalyst (TWC) equipped vehicles were modi- fied to operate on the Federal Test Procedure using gasoline or alcohol fuels. Unburned (hydro)carbon emis- sions were generally lowest when methanol fuel was used. Oxides of nitrogen (NOJ were reduced an average of more than 50% by using alcohol fuels in contrast to gasoline. Photochemical reactivity comparisons of un- 54</page><page sequence="36">800261-800264 burned fuel emissions were made by calculation and also with a 100 cu. ft. smog chamber. Synthetic reproductions (surrogates) of stoichiometric methanol exhaust were less photochemically reactive than gasoline exhaust surrogates for the 8.5:1 compression ratio engine conditions. This effect was observed even though methanol exhaust surrogates were tested at higher hydrocarbon-to-NOx ratios (20:1 vs. 13.8:1) than were the gasoline exhaust surrogates. The exhaust from the stoichiometric TWC- equipped vehicles was extremely low in calculated and experimental reactivities for both methanol and gasoline fuels. This was due to their very low mass emissions and low exhaust hydrocarbon- to-NOx ratios. 800261. Evaporative and Exhaust Emissions from Cars Fueled with Gasoline Containing Ethanol or Methyl tert-Butyl Ether. Robert L. Furey, Fuels and Lubricants Dept., General Motors Research Labs., Warren, MI; and Jack B. King, Advance Product Engrg., General Motors Engrg. Staff, Warren, MI. Vehicle tests showed that evaporative emissions were increased significantly by adding 10 percent ethanol to gasoline, but were increased less with 15 percent MTBE in gasoline. The quantity of ethanol or MTBE in evaporative emissions was investigated in laboratory tests. Exhaust HC, CO, and NOx emissions from a car without closed- loop fuel control were significantly lower with the ethanol and MTBE fuel blends than with gasoline. For cars equipped with closed-loop carburetors, the absolute differences in exhaust emissions among the fuels were small. Fuel economy and driveability were worse with ethanol and MTBE fuel blends than with gasoline. 1980 SA E Transactions 800262. Surface Ignition Initiated Combustion of Alcohol in Diesel Engines - A New Approach. B. Nagalingam, B. L. Sridhar, N. R. Pancha- pakesan, K. V. Gopalakrishnan and B. S. Murthy, Internal Combustion Engines Lab., Indian Inst, of Technology (Madras/India). The self-ignition temperature of alcohols is so high that abnormally high compression ratios would be required to use them in conventional diesel engines. This paper presents a novel approach of force igniting methanol or ethanol alone in a diesel engine at normal compression ratios. The well established proneness of methanol to preignite in SI engine is made use of in the present method by employing a heated and insulated surface to initiate ignition. A conventional single cylinder diesel engine was modified to work on this principle. The engine operates satisfactorily at the rated speed (1500 RPM) on methanol and ethanol with thermal efficiencies comparable to the normal diesel engine of the same configuration. The operational experience further shows that it is possible to design a self-sustaining hot surface to initiate ignition. The engine also exhibits multi-fuel capability. A new direction for the use of methanol in diesel engines can follow from this technique. Discussion: F. Pischinger, Univ. of Aachen (W. Germany); Ernst Holmer, Volvo Truck Corp. (Sweden); S.

The Combustion of Gaseous Fuels in a Dual Fuel Engine of the Compression Ignition Type with Particular Reference to Cold Intake Temperature Conditions. G. A. Karim and K. S. Burn, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg., Univ. of Calgary (Calgary/Canada). The present contribution is mainly concerned with an investigation of the characteristics of dual fuel operation under cold intake temperatures, primarily from the viewpoint of engine performance and exhaust emissions. The gaseous fuels employed were methane, propane, hydrogen and ethylene. The addition of the inerts carbon dioxide and nitrogen were also considered. Comparison with the corresponding normal diesel operation was made throughout. 800264. Gasification of Diesel Fuel for a Low-Emission, High-Efficiency Engine System. G. P. Purohit and John Houseman, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology. This paper presents the concept of gasified diesel fuel as a potential solution to the diesel engine emissions problem, especially the particulates. The concept employs two-stage combustion. During the first stage of combustion diesel fuel is partially oxidized with air in a catalytic reactor and converted to a hydrogen-rich gas. During the second stage of combustion the hydrogen-rich gas is mixed with additional air and burned to completion in the engine. The first stage reaction is catalytic and when carried out at an air-fuel mass ratio of 5.2, it does not produce soot or particulates. The subsequent combustion of the hydro- gen-rich gas in the engine does not form soot or particulates. The conversion of diesel fuel to a hydrogen-rich gas is an exothermic reaction. The energy released during the process can be recovered in a Rankine engine heat recovery unit to prevent a net loss in fuel economy. The heat recovery unit can also be used to recover the engine exhaust heat to improve overall system efficiency. Results of the analysis indicate up to 10 percent improvement in overall system efficiency over conventional diesel engines. Experiments on a catalytic gasifier show that complete gasification of diesel fuel is possible without soot or particulate formation. Implementation of the concept requires additional equipment and appropriate controls which represents increased cost and complexity. 55</page><page sequence="37">800265-800274 800265. Brazilian Experience with Self-Adjusting Fuel System for Variable Alcohol-Gasoline Blends. Michael D. Leshner, Fuel injection Develop- ment Corp., Carlos A. Luengo, Universidade Estadual de Campinas, Institute of Physics and Energy Group (Brazil); and Franco Calandra, Bendix Do Brazil, Ltda. (Brazil). A fuel control system has been developed which allows fuels of various stoichiometries to be used interc- hangeably, without suffering a fuel consumption penalty, allowing a more efficient use of the combustion energy. This Adaptive Lean Limit Control system uses a single, digital sensor and an electronic circuit to detect lean limit engine operation, and feeds back information to the fuel system to maintain the best economy mixture, regardless of the fuel blend being used. This paper will describe the hardware, and include the results of extensive vehicle testing, using 20 percent and 50 percent ethanol-gasoline blends. 800266.

(SP-456) Noise Source Identification Under Steady and Accelerating Conditions on a Turbo- charged Diesel Engine. Malcolm J. Crocker, M. Zockel, M. McGary and T. Reinhart, Ray W. Herrick Labs., School of Mechanical Engrg., Purdue Univ., W. Lafayette, IN. The main aims of the experiments reported in this paper are to obtain a quantitative comparison between the noise ranking of engine components using intensity and lead wrapping techniques, and to analyze the causes of the sudden increase in noise level observed during the initial part of the acceleration process. The results indicate that the surface intensity tech- nique agrees well with the lead wrapping sound power results and, although the surface intensity technique in its present state of development, is still time consuming, it does also produce information about the vibration levels of the surface which is essential when the component has to be redesigned to reduce noise. The acceleration test results indicate that the increased sound pressure level is directly related to changes in the combustion process while turbocharger lag appears to have negligible effect. 1980 SA E Transactions 800276. (SP-456) Noise Testing of Vehicles - Acoustic Propagation Phenomena. J. E. Piercy and T. F. W. Embleton, Physics Div., National Research Council (Ottawa/Canada). A number of propagation phenomena which cause variability in the noise testing of vehicles using standard procedures have been isolated and studied. Included are the effects of interference produced by reflection from various ground surfaces, the effects of refraction caused by wind and temperature gradients in the atmosphere, changes in sound level due to the wake of the vehicle, and the effects of normal atmospheric turbulence. 1980 SA E Transactions 800277. (SP-456) A Comparison of Two Stationary Measurement Procedures for Truck Exterior Sound Levels. D. S. Kennedy, Harford, Ken- nedy, Wakefield, Ltd.; and E. R. Welbourne, Transport Canada. SAE RP J1096 and CSA Standard Z107.22 are compared in terms of their performance as predictors of pass-by sound levels measured in accordance with SAE RP J366b. The comparison is based on the results of tests on 60 diesel trucks covering a range of ages, sound levels and configurations. The CSA procedure is found to be at least as good a predictor of pass-by sound levels as RP J 1096 and can be used on smaller and noiser sites. The results of some exploratory measurements of the effects of wind and temperature gradients on the repeatability of the two procedures are also presented and discussed. 1980 SAE Transactions 800278. (SP-456) Noise Exposure of Truck Drivers. Zygmunt F. Reif and Thomas N. Moore, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg., Univ. of Windsor (Windsor/Ontario); and Arthur E. Steevensz, Pratt and Whitney of Canada, Ltd. (Longueuil/Quebec). The noise exposure of truck drivers was measured during normal commercial payload runs with special instruments, which are equipped with subminiature microphones. These can be mounted within the cavum of the concha, where measurements are least affected by extraneous effects. By means of these instruments sound levels were continuously recorded within both ears of the driver and at the centre of the cab. Analysis of results shows that the driver's exposure is highest during freeway hauls and that permanent hearing loss hazard may exist. Frequent use of radio or CB radio can significantly increase this hazard. It is also evident that the sound levels measured within the ears of the driver are generally significantly higher than at the centre of the cab. 1980 SAE Transactions 800279. Reducing the Sound Level of Power Boats. Robert T. Larsen, Outboard Marine Corp. A quiet operating power boat adds significantly to the pleasure of recreational boating. Boating is most enjoyed in areas with low ambient sound levels and boat owners want to be a part of that environment. The quieting of a power boat cannot be adequately performed when it is treated as an engineering adjunct or an after thought. In the building of a power boat no one manufacturer has the control over all the characteristics of the final product. Quieting has to be the product of a well organized and coordinated design effort between the boat builder and the engine manufacturer. At the onset, viable sound level objectives must be established. Potential sources of noise must be identified and carefully analyzed. This paper will present some techniques for the establishment of attainable sound levels both in and out of the boat. It will also delineate techniques that can be used to analyze noise sources and noise transmission paths. Finally a system is developed for transmitting design aids to the boat builder. These aids will assist the builder in employing the most cost effective selection of materials, devices and designs for the sound level reduction of a power boat. 800280. (SP-456) Reduction of Traffic Noise Impacts Via Path Controls. Timothy M. Barry, Office of 57</page><page sequence="39">800281-800286 Research, Federal Highway Admin., Washing- ton, DC. Path control measures to reduce traffic noise impacts include roadway alignment, site planning, noise barriers, and building insulation. Roadway alignment and site planning are most effective when included during the project planning stages. For existing noise problems, roadside noise barriers are effective, providing reductions of up to 15 dB (A). Some sites require building insulation to reduce traffic noise impacts. Three levels of modifi- cations are considered: (1) sealing leaks, (2) modification of small structure elements, and (3) wall panel modifi- cations. 800281. (SP-456) Identification of Tire Noise Generation Mechanisms Using a Roadwheel Facility. Ken- neth J. Plotkin and Mark M. Montroll, Wyle Labs., Arlington, VA; William R. Fuller, Wyle Labs., El Segundo, CA; and Harvey J. Nozick, Office of Noise Abatement and Control, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, DC. A series of acoustic and vibration measurements were conducted on four heavy truck tires, utilizing a roadwheel facility enclosed in a semi-anechoic chamber. Data were recorded from five near-field microphones and from five accelerometers mounted inside the tires. Acoustic time signatures were analyzed to identify source locations and possible generation mechanisms. Excellent agreement was obtained between air pumping theory and measurements for a crossbar tire. Tentative agreement between air pumping theory and measurements has also been ob- tained for one rib tire. 1980 SA E Transactions 800282. (SP-456) Relative Influence of Pavement Texture and Tire Type on Pavement/Tire Noise. M. M. Osman, Ontario Hydro, Design and Develop- ment Div. (Toronto/Ontario); and D. N. May, Wyle Labs., El Segundo, CA. This paper describes the noise from pavement/tire interaction at speeds above 60 km/h. The concrete pavements investigated differed primarily in surface texture: worn, grooved (3 types) and randomly-scabbled. Three types of car tires were used: summer bias-ply, summer radial and winter bias-ply. The measurement procedure adopted was a near-tire one. The vehicle was a passenger car and tests were conducted at three speeds: 64, 80 and 96 km/h. A-weighted sound levels and one-third octave band frequency analyses are presented for the different pavement types and tires considered. They indicate that the difference in the sound levels produced by the winter tires and others is highest for worn concrete and diminishes as pavement surface texture increases. 800284. Axisymmetric Flow Model with and without Swirl in a Piston-Cylinder Arrangement with Idealized Valve Operation. J. I. Ramos, Dept. of Me- chanical and Aerospace Engrg., Princeton Univ., Princeton, NJ; and W. A. Sirignano, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg., Carnegie-Mellon Univ., Pittsburgh, PA. Axisymmetric cold flow calculations in a piston-cylinder configuration have been performed by means of a stretching and compression computational mesh with and without swirl and for four-stroke engines with turbulent conditions. The valve has been represented either as a centrally located orifice which opens and closes suddenly at BDC or as an annular orifice of varying area which simulates the valve lift profile as a function of time. The results without swirl for the annular valve configuration show two eddies, one behind the innermost valve circle and the other at the cylinder head. These two eddies persist up to TDC of the compression stroke; afterwards the piston drives the flow and the velocity and turbulent kinetic energy profiles are almost sectionally homoge- neous. The swirl calculations performed with the sudden- valve configuration show the same trends for the flowfield and the radial profile of tangential velocity is almost a straight line which corresponds to a solid-body rotation with a very sharp gradient at the cylinder wall. 800285. Interaction of a Planar Laminar Premixed Flame with a Perpendicular Wall. G. F. Carrier, F. E. Fendell and P. S. Feldman, TRW Defense and Space Systems Group, Redondo Beach, CA. We study, herein, the steady, isobaric two-dimensional interaction with a flat perpendicular wall of an otherwise planar fuel-lean hydrocarbon-air premixed laminar flame, stabilized on a heat-sink burner. We report isotherms, and isoconcentration contours for hydrocarbons, in the quench layer on a cold isothermal side wall from results of numerical (ADI) integration of the elliptical boundary- value problem for a one-step irreversible Arrhenius-type chemical reaction. Also, burning near a single hot or adiabatic wall, and reduction of flame speed in a parallel-plate crevice-type duct with cold walls, are discussed. 800286. Axisymmetric Flow Model in a Piston-Cylinder Arrangement with Detailed Analysis of the Valve Region. J. I. Ramos, Dept. of Mechanical and Aerospace Engrg., Princeton Univ., Princeton, NJ; and W. A. Sirignano, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg., Carnegie-Mellon Univ., Pittsburgh, PA. The flow in an axisymmetric piston-cylinder configuration has been studied by means of a novel technique that solves the Navier-Stokes equations in two domains: one fixed and another stretching and compressing. The valve has been simulated as an infinitesimally thin "plate" in which the law of the wall is used for the calculations of the 58</page><page sequence="40">800287-800290 radial velocity and the turbulent kinetic energy. Both two- and four-stroke calculations with heat transfer have been performed. In the two-stroke calculations, the valve was kept at a fixed location. In the four-stroke calculations, the valve moves in the fixed domain with a velocity profile corresponding to a cam with valve overlap. This proce- dure has the advantage that the exact location of the valve is known at any time. The turbulence is generated by the intake stroke which shows a recirculation zone behind the valve. During the compression stroke, the cylinder wall eddy formed during the intake stroke still persists but it is damped. During the expansion or power stroke, the piston drives the flow and the velocity and turbulent kinetic energy contours are almost uniform. 800287. A Model for the Instantaneous Heat Transfer and Turbulence in a Spark Ignition Engine. Claus Borgnakke and Vedat S. Arpaci, Mechanical Engineering Department, University of Michi- gan; and Rodney J. Tabaczynski, Engineering and Research Staff, Ford Motor Company. The heat transfer and turbulence are modeled for a spark-ignition engine. The heat transfer is described in terms of unsteady boundary layers for both the burned and unburned gas regions. These boundary layers are influenced by both the free stream turbulence level and the rate of flame propagation. Turbulence levels are characterized by a K-c model which includes the effects of compressibility and anisotropic behavior of the flow field. The flame propagation process is modeled using current entrainment model philosophy. The results of the modeling are illustrated for an engine having a simple pancake geometry. The major accomplishments are the development of an unsteady, compressible turbulence model and the development of an instantaneous heat transfer model. The influence of the turbulent field on the heat transfer rate is given via the turbulent Reynolds number and the integral length scale. The averaged heat transfer rate is compared with the correlations of Annand and Woschni and the shortcom- ings of these simpler correlations are discussed. 800288. Automotive Engine Modeling with a Hybrid Random Choice Method, II. Gary A. Sod, Dept. of Mechanical and Aerospace Engrg., Princeton Univ., Princeton, NJ. A numerical procedure is considered for solving the equations governing a slightly viscous, axially symmetric flow. A new grid free method for treating boundary layer separation is introduced, where the computational ele- ments are circular vortex filaments. Examples are given for a flow in a motored engine chamber during the intake stroke. 800289. Simulation Studies of the Effects of Turbo- charging and Reduced Heat Transfer on Spark- Ignition Engine Operation. Paula A. Watts and John B. Heywood, Sloan Automotive Lab, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cam- bridge, MA. A computer simulation of the four-stroke spark-ignition engine cycle has been used to examine the effects of turbocharging and reduced heat transfer on engine performance, efficiency and NOx emissions. The simu- lation computes the flows into and out of the engine, calculates the changes in thermodynamic properties and composition of the unburned and burned gas mixtures within the cylinder through the engine cycle due to work, heat and mass transfers, and follows the kinetics of NO formation and decomposition in the burned gas. The combustion process is specified as an input to the program through use of a normalized rate of mass burning profile. From this information, the simulation computes engine power, fuel consumption and NOx emissions. Wide-open-throttle predictions made with the simu- lation were compared with experimental data from a 5.7/ naturally aspirated and a 3.8/ turbocharged production engine. The predicted trends of mean effective pressure and fuel consumption showed acceptable agreement with the data. Simulation studies were performed to compare the fuel consumption and NOx emissions of a 5.7/ naturally aspirated engine with a 3.8/ turbocharged engine over the complete load and speed range. These engines have equal maximum power. Further studies were carried out to examine the effects of reduced heat transfer on engine performance, efficiency and NOx emissions. Reductions in heat transfer were simulated by increasing the thermal boundary layer resistance, and through the use of ceramic materials on selected engine components over a range of combustion chamber wall temperatures. 800290. Models for Heat Transfer, Mixing and Hydro- carbon Oxidation in an Exhaust Port of a Spark-Ignited Engine. J. A. Caton, Texas A&amp;M Univ.; and J. B. Heywood, Sloan Automotive Lab., Massachusetts Inst, of Technology. The fate of hydrocarbon species in the exhaust systems of spark-ignition engines is an important part of the overall hydrocarbon emissions problem. In this investigation models were developed for the instantaneous heat trans- fer, fluid mixing, and hydrocarbon oxidation in an engine exhaust port. Experimental measurements were obtained for the instantaneous cylinder pressure and instantaneous gas temperature at the exhaust port exit for a range of engine operating conditions. These measurements were used to validate the heat transfer model and to provide data on the instantaneous cylinder gas state for a series of illustrative exhaust port hydrocarbon oxidation compu- tations as a function of engine operating and design variables. During much of the exhaust process, the exhaust port heat transfer was dominated by large-scale fluid motion generated by the jet-like flow at the exhaust valve. A 59</page><page sequence="41">800293-800299 correlation based on the jet velocity through the valve opening was developed which correctly estimated the heat transfer due to this large-scale motion. A four-period heat transfer correlation for the complete exhaust process was then formulated, based on two distinct flow regimes, which provided good agreement with the measurements. For individual variations of the engine operating conditions, computed reductions in hydrocarbon levels due to oxidation in the exhaust port ranged between 9 and 38%. The effect of the operating conditions was governed primarily by the resultant variations in exhaust gas temperatures and port residence times. Variations in specific design parameters, such as exhaust port geometry and internal port insulation, changed the overall degree of hydrocarbon oxidation in the exhaust port. 800293. Driver and Passenger Air Bag Unit Assemblies. David J. Romeo, Talley Industries of Arizona, Inc., Mesa, AZ. The air bag restraint system or automatic restraint system is specifically designed to control forces and deceleration to the human body during an automobile accident. The three basic components comprising the air bag restraint system include: 1) the crash sensor(s), the diagnostic package for determining operability status, and the driver and front passenger air bag assemblies. The information presented is limited to a description and the operational features of the driver and passenger unit assemblies; parts which are located in the steering wheel and instrument panel respectively. Both assemblies consist of three basic components: 1) the inflator, 2) the module, and 3) the air bag. 800294. The Development of Air Cushion Restraint Systems for Small Car Front Seat Occupants. D. Theodore Zinke, Minicars, Inc. This paper presents progress, to date, on development and evaluation of three front seat airbag restraint systems for small cars. The subject vehicles were a Chevrolet Che- vette, for which a passenger restraint system was devel- oped, and a Dodge Omni, for which both driver and passenger systems were developed. The systems were primarily evolved during a series of sled tests and evaluated in vehicle barrier impacts. 800295. Gas Générant Chemical Hazard Evaluation. Eckart W. Schmidt, Rocket Research Co. Toxicity and flammability hazards of gas générants and exhaust products therefrom are reviewed in comparison to other chemicals commonly used in automobiles. The benefit to risk ratio of lives saved by automatic inflatable restraint systems versus accidental poisonings or burns by gas générant chemicals is so many orders of magnitude above 1 that the hazard potential of the chemicals should not be used as an argument against the introduction of automatic inflatable restraint systems. 1980 SAE Transactions 800297. Restraint Systems Comparison in Frontal Crashes Using a Living Animal. M. DeJeammes, R. Biard, R. Quincy and Y. Derrlen, Laboratoire des Chocs et de Biomécanique - ONSER; and P. Billault, Centre d'Etudes Techniques - CITROEN.; C. Tisseron and Centre d'Etudes Techniques - CITROEN Since the three point belt appeared, many improvements were searched. With the aim of estimating their efficiency, a comparative study, choosing a living subject - the baboon - has been carried out. The static three-point belt being the reference, the restraint systems were tested in frontal impacts at 14 m/s (50 km/h) and more. Besides classical biochemical criteria, the lesion finding and the baboon stress led us to the conclusion that: 1 - the pre-inflated belt gives the most favourable results, 2 - the load-limited belt is not easy to be adjusted, 3 - the pre-loaded belt has an efficiency much dependent on the crash detection and 4 - the automatic retractor belt shows a "film spool" effect that may be unfavourable. Moreover, this study gave indications on the biomech- anical criteria credibility. 1980 SAE Transactions 800298. MVMA-2D Air Bag/ Steering Assembly Simu- lation Model. C. C. Chou, A. Lev and D. M. Lenardon, Ford Motor Co. This paper describes further developments of the MVMA-2D model including program modifications of the air bag and the energy absorbing steering assembly submodels. The air bag submodel and the steering assembly submodel in the MVMA-2D crash victim simulation are independently formulated. No coupling exists between these two submodels to permit simulation of the kinematics of an anthropomorphic dummy re- strained by a driver air bag restraint system mounted on a collapsible steering column. The development effort of integrating both submodels to provide the MVMA-2D model with such a capability is presented. The integrated model has been successfully utilized in simulating dynamic responses, in frontal impact situa- tions, of a dummy restrained by a driver air bag restraint system mounted on a collapsible steering column. Vali- dations of the model were made by comparing simulation results with experimental test data. Applications of the model to air bag restraint system performance evaluations and parametric studies for aiding restraint system designs are demonstrated. Guidelines and limitations of the model are also discussed. 800299. Quantitative Life Cycle Description of Air Bag Restraint System (ABRS) Equipped Vehicles. Ernest Stephen Arvai, Arthur D.

Development of a Preloaded, Force-Limited Passive Belt System for Small Cars. Michael J. Walsh and Barbara J. Kelleher, Calspan Corp., Advanced Technology Center, Buffalo, NY. Development of a producible preloaded, force-limited passive belt restraint system for small cars has been completed at Calspan Corporation. The restraint system has been developed and evaluated through computer simulations and sled tests. This paper presents and discusses the results of the developmental program at velocity changes of 34, 40 and 45 MPH during symmetric frontal barrier crash sled and computer simulations with regard to the effect upon 50th, 95th, 5th percentile and 6 year old sized anthropometric test devices (ATDs). Data obtained include head and chest triaxial accelerations, femur loads and belt loads for the ATDs. High speed movies allowed comparisons of ATD kinematics during the sled tests with ATD model kinematics obtained from the computer simulations. A commercially available belt preloader was used during the sled tests along with: nylon webbing, polyester webbing and two levels of force limiting webbing. The system was also evaluated using a force-limiting active lap belt and these results are compared with non-preloaded, standard webbing belt system responses. Results of this experimental and simulation study demonstrate that the FMVSS 208 performance evaluation criteria are met at 45 MPH velocity change for the 50th percentile ATD right front passenger and at lower speeds (but greater than 30 MPH) for other adult-sized right front passengers. Compliance of a 50th percentile driver is also demonstrated at 34 MPH. 1980 SA E Transactions 800302. The Outlook for Powder Metallurgy in the 80's with Emphasis on the Automotive Market. Kemp- ton H. Roll, Metal Powder Industries Federa- tion, Princeton, NJ. Powder Metallurgy is both a dynamic technology and a dynamic industry, having moved forward in many new directions.

Energy Consumption in the Manufacture of Precision Metal Parts from Iron Powder. S. M. Kaufman, Ford Motor Co. The energy requirements for making precision metal parts from iron powder, including the manufacture of the powder itself, were calculated using a representative processing model and energy data available in the literature. These energy requirements were found to compare favorably with available estimates for the steel making process. When the lower density of the powder metal part and the elimination of machining operations associated with conventional wrought and machined steel parts were considered energy savings as high as 50 percent were shown to be possible through powder metallurgy (P/M). The efficiency of the P/M process and potential areas for decrease in energy consumption were also highlighted. 1980 SA E Transactions 800304. The Past, Present and Future of Powder Forging with Particular Reference to Ferrous Materials. G. T. Brown, Process Technology Dept., GKN Group Technological Centre. In order that the powder forging process shall gain a high sales volume it must be cost effective. The price of steel powder is thus critical. This price can be kept to a minimum only if the number of specifications produced is at a minimum. The paper reviews the historical devel- opment of the powder forging process, shows why the chemical compositions in use were chosen and proposes international recognition of the current situation. Possi- bilities for future development are mentioned but a note of caution is sounded that whatever course is followed must have sound economic as well as technical justi- fication. 800306. Changes in Microstructure of Ferrous Powder Metal Compacts During High Temperature Sin- tering. S. Mocarski and D. W. Hall, Ford Motor Co., Detroit, MI. Samples of commercial powders were sintered at the conventional sintering temperature of 1120°C (2050°F) and also at high temperatures of 1232°C and 1288°C (2250° F and 2350° F) using different time cycles in an industrial walking-beam furnace. Pore morphology is shown in a series of photomicrographs. The spheroidi- zation of pores is rapid at high temperatures and the rate of spheroidization increases with the complexity of powder particles. Pore rounding is also associated with the elimination of prior particle identity as shown in a series of fractographs. High temperature sintered parts, due to improved impact strength and ductility, have potential for expanding the field of powder metallurgy, because parts so processed can be substituted for all but the most demanding forgings and also for nodular iron castings.

Hiroyuki Endoh, Yoshiaki Takeya, Tadao Hayasaka, Yutaka Ikenoue and Yoshiaki Hirano, Hitachi Powdered Metals Co., Ltd. A new sintered material has been developed which shows high performance as an internal combustion engine valve guide. This material, consisting of Fe-Cu-Sn-P-C-Graphite alloy, includes free graphite, Fe-P-C hard phase and pores in it, and offers both of good durability and machinability. 800308. Posttreatment of P/M Parts. Marvin Feir, Power Tool Div., Rockwell International, Pittsburgh, PA. As P/M parts become more complex and mechanical requirements more critical, the need for post-forming treatments becomes of greater concern to the manufac- turer. This paper presents an insight to simple parameters of various types of heat treatments and machining techniques for use on P/M parts. Various types of heat treatments and their effects upon parts where different from wrought materials are discussed. Methods of hardness testing and interpretation of results are explained as are the needs for good specifications. Various preparatory methods for surface coating and surface protection are covered as well as methods for sealing against liquid and gas pressure leaks. Mention is made of numerous ways used to size or qualify dimensions in close toleranced areas. The final section deals with suggestions for techniques that have worked in providing good production results in the various types of machining that are normally required to complete the piece. 800309. Production of Full-Density M2 Automotive Die- sel Parts Via the HTM™ Powder Metal Process. John A. Rassenfoss, Amsted Research Labs., Amsted Industries Inc., Bensenville, IL. Three years of production experience have demonstrated the ability of HTM process full-density P/M cam rings of M2 high-speed steel for diesel fuel injection pumps to replace cam rings of the same alloy produced from rolled bar stock. The processing capabilities of HTM are outlined, the pertinent properties of the P/M material, the dimensional precision of the parts produced and the quality assurance program are described. Manufacturing experience in machining, heat treatment and grinding is discussed. Manufacturing cost reduction opportunities with the P/M part are shown. Results of bench and field testing of the P/M cam rings are discussed. Potential of the HTM full-density P/M approach for diesel and other applications is briefly reviewed. 800311. The Hippies Are Coming! (How to Apply Hot Isostatic Processing (HIP) in the Automotive Industry). Hugh D. Hanes and Robert M. Rex, Conaway Pressure Systems; Inc. Hot isostatic processing (HIP) is a rapidly expanding manufacturing process which involves treating parts at very high temperatures in an inert gas at very high pressures. HIP-treated parts display dramatic improve- ments in strength, fatigue resistance, and other important characteristics. Components of aircraft turbine engines, high-speed tool steels, cemented carbides, carbon/carbon composites, titanium, and super-alloys are all commonly HIP'ed today. Castings' characteristics are improved by HIP'ing. HIP's potential value to the automotive industry lies in weight reduction, reliability, safety, and conservation of energy and scarce materials. Smaller, stronger, lighter engine blocks, for example, are a distinct possibility with HIP. HIP/PM gear blanks requiring minimal machining are another possibility. The relatively high cost of HIP has been the principal impediment to its widespread commercialization. With larger capacity systems the economics of HIP are now in the range of interest to the automotive industry. 800312. Manufacture of Light Weight Automotive Parts by Elastic Reservoir Molding. Nippani R. Rao, Composite Technology Corp. A commercial process for composite (thermoset) materials has been developed. Key advantages are light weight, low molding pressures, and the ability to accommodate two or more types of reinforcements and one or two resin systems. Partial or complete encapsulation of light-weight cores with tough FRP skin can be obtained. Current and potential applications include light weight, structural automotive, and industrial fiber glass reinforced com- posites. 800315. Fatigue Behavior of Exhaust Valve Alloys. David R. Jones, TRW Valve Div. This paper reviews the fatigue properties of internal combustion engine exhaust valve alloys. Examples of typical exhaust valve fatigue failures are shown along with an explanation of the factors leading to these failures. The results of laboratory engine tests designed to duplicate underhead fatigue failures and evaluate the effect of valve design are discussed. The elevated temperature fatigue strength of common exhaust valve alloys in plain air and corrosive environments is presented along with a method to determine fatigue crack initiation and propagation rates. The results of scanning electron microscope studies correlate well with the experimentally determined crack growth rates. 1980 SAE Transactions 62</page><page sequence="44">800316-800321 800316. A Heat Resistant Aluminized Steel for High Temperature Applications. Yong-Wu Kim and Richard A. Nickola, Inland Steel Co. A new heat resistant aluminized steel, trade named ALUMA-TI, has been developed which has unique mechanical and corrosion properties especially attractive for high temperature applications where economy is a prime consideration for material selection. Presented are its mechanical properties and response to various cor- rosive environments. High temperature strength and oxidation resistance is far superior to Type I ALUMIN- IZED steel at temperatures above 704°C (1300°F). In combined oxidation/corrosion tests, ALUMA-TI is com- parable to AISI 409 stainless steel. Therefore, ALUMA- TI is a prime material candidate for automotive exhaust systems. 800317. A Powder Fed Plasma Transferred Arc Process for Hard Facing Internal Combustion Engine Valve Seats. J. Milligan and S. Narasimhan, Engine Components Div., Eaton Corp., Battle Creek, MI. A powder fed, microprocessor controlled plasma trans- ferred arc (PTA) hard facing technique is described for facing valve seats. A comparison of this technique is made with the conventional oxy-acetylene flame welding process to show the differences in the metallurgical characteristics of the respective products. The merits of the PTA process are associated with a) its precision controllable heat source and lower energy consumption b) finer microstructure and narrower heat affected zone, c) its versatility for powders of different raw materials, d) higher volume production capability, and e) minimum raw material waste; however, it does not replace the flame welding process completely. The relative choice between the two processes will depend on investment costs, volume of production and metallurgical quality requirements of the final product. The present trend of increasing costs and shortages of strategic hard facing materials and needs for more hard faced valves for future engines make the PTA technique attractive for new demands in the automotive industry. 800318. Deterioration of Heat Resistant Alloys for Au- tomobile Emission Control Equipment. Yasuhiro Mita and Minoru Uchino, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. Various heat resistant alloys are being introduced for use in automobile emission equipment, such as thermal reactors and catalytic converters. For the past several years Japan has been developing alloys which emphasize oxidation resistance. Therefore, oxidation phenomena have been thoroughly researched and clarified. On the other hand, embrittlement, which is a marked deterio- ration similar to oxide deterioration, has not been studied sufficiently. The major subjects of investigation were the two forms of embrittlement in austenitic heat resistant alloys, caused by the precipitation of a phase and the absorption of Nitrogen. Useful information was obtained from these results. 1980 SA E Transactions 800319. Effect of Exhaust System Design on Engine Performance. Tim G. Adams, Engineering and Research Staff, Ford Motor Company. Experiments were conducted with the Ford V-8, 5.0L (302 C.I.D.) engine to investigate the effects of exhaust system design on engine performance. Five header manifolds were designed and tested both on an engine dynamometer and in a vehicle. The results are compared with the production exhaust systems and with predicted results based on exhaust tuning theories. Dynamometer engine tests were also conducted to determine the effect of the muffler and catalytic converter location on exhaust tuning. In addition, back-pressure sensitivity studies were made and these data are compared with the results obtained through exhaust backpressure - power loss tests on competitive domestic vehicles. 800320. Engine Component Design Through the Nissan Structural Analysis System. Mizuho Fukuda, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. The introduction and development of structural analysis programs, the advances in electronic computer hardware, the development of computer graphics, etc. are all factors that have played an important role in practical appli- cations of structural analysis techniques which are based on finite element methods. The development of the Nissan structural analysis system, which is centered on computer graphics (SAS/graphics), has considerably shortened the time that elapses from the discovery of a problem to the completion of its analysis. This system has become an indispensable instrument in planning and development operations. This paper explains the Nissan structural analysis system from the viewpoints of both hardware and software. Next, it details the system's recent applications to engine components and describes the structural analyses of a piston, cylinder block, fuel hose, catalytic converter, etc. Finally, it discusses further subjects which may be solved in order to promote the practical appli- cation of structural analysis techniques. 1980 SA E Transactions 800321. A Newly-Developed 1.5L CVCC Engine for Some 1980 Models. Shizuo Yagi, Isao Fujii, Masayasu Nishikawa and Hiroshi Shirai, Honda R&amp;D Co., Ltd. In this paper, the fuel consumption and exhaust gas emission characteristics of a newly developed 1.5/ CVCC engine are compared with those of a conventional engine, the pressure and temperature of combustion gas in each cylinder are measured on real time in order to clarify the 63</page><page sequence="45">800324-800330 differences between these characteristics, and combustion analyses are made on the basis thereof. Basically, this CVCC engine differs little from original CVCC engines, in which, however, the auxiliary combus- tion chamber is located closer to the center of the main combustion chamber than in original ones and torch opening is modified to be of the multi-opening type so that the torch flame spreads all over the main combustion chamber. As a result, compared with conventional engines operated at the rich air-fuel ratio (14.7), the new CVCC engine is capable of providing, not only at the same air-fuel ratio, to be sure, but also in the lean range, a stable combustion which is small in the cycle variation, whereby the fuel consumption and emissions are im- proved. 800324. Chassis Dynamometer Provided with Control Device Simulating Road Load. A. Takamura, M. Ono and S. Ohigashi, Ono Sokki Co., Ltd. In order to clarify the emission characteristics of auto- mobile engines using a chassis dynamometer, it is necessary to control the chassis dynamometer to simulate road load conditions. The authors have developed a chassis dynamometer and its control system which satisfy above requirement. As the result of testing this system, it was confirmed that this chassis dynamometer system is useful for practical purposes. In this paper the devices of the chassis dynamometer, the control system and some test results are described. 800326. Automotive Exhaust Emissions in an Urban Area. K. Yoshizumi, K. Nakamura, K. Inoue and T. Ishiguro, Tokyo Metropolitan Research Institute for Environmental Protection (Japan). Automotive exhaust emissions were studied from the standpoint of urban traffic conditions. Auto traffic data were obtained in Tokyo, Japan, using a test car monitored for vehicle speed and other pertinent data. Eleven different kinds of traffic patterns in Tokyo were identified which seemed to most closely represent urban driving conditions. Forty-eight motor vehicles, consisting of 1971 to 1976 model year passenger cars, vans and trucks (gasoline and diesel), were driven on a chassis dynamometer to measure emissions under the eleven patterns mentioned above. The characteristics of NOx, HC and CO emissions and fuel consumption by vehicle type and model year were obtained and correlated with vehicle speeds. By combin- ing these analyses of emissions as a function of vehicle speed with estimated present and expected future traffic data in Tokyo, the total emissions and fuel consumption by vehicles in the Tokyo metropolitan area were esti- mated. Calculated fuel consumption coincided well with fuel sales data. It was found that the 10 mode Japanese official test method would underestimate total emissions in an urban area, especially for vehicles certified to meet stringent emission standards. 800328. Direct Injected Methanol Fueling of Two-Stroke Locomotive Engine. C. D. Wood and J. O. Storment, Southwest Research Inst. One cylinder of a two-stroke cycle locomotive engine was converted to operate with methyl alcohol (methanol) as primary fuel and pilot injection of diesel fuel for ignition. Two fueling schemes, featuring injection of methanol and pilot fuel at different locations in the cylinder, were evaluated. Results showed that the methanol-fueled cylinder produced power outputs and thermal efficiencies very close to normal diesel values at rated engine speed and load, with methanol fueling rates up to 95% by BTU input. However, the highest thermal efficiencies with high percentages of methanol fueling were accompanied by pronounced diesel-type knock. An explanation of this phenomenon is put forth in this paper. 800329. Performance of Coal Slurry Fuel in a Diesel Engine. K. Tataiah and C. D. Wood, Southwest Research Institute. Three slurry fuels containing different concentrations of coal have been tested in a small-bore 4-cylinder diesel engine equipped with modified injectors under various loads and speeds. The coal in the slurry was a finely pulverized coal having a mean particle diameter of 2.05 micrometers. Exhaust temperatures, smoke, blowby, and brake thermal efficiencies were determined under these conditions. The relative effectiveness of coal in saving diesel fuel was determined. In general, at higher speeds, exhaust temperatures and smoke increased with the concentration of coal while brake thermal efficiency decreased. The blowby increased significantly in a period of 14 hours at the end of which the fuel pump seized. However, no abnormal wear was observed on injectors and valves. From this preliminary study, it appears that two BTU's of coal will replace about one BTU of diesel fuel in the energy utilization of a slurry fuel of this type, and that the use of slurry fuels will require major engine modifi- cations. 800330. Alternate Fuels for Medium-Speed Diesel En- gines. Quentin A. Baker, Southwest Research Inst. Tests were performed on a two-stroke cycle medium- speed diesel engine in an attempt to define the ability of this class of engines to operate on certain alternate fuels, and to define the performance characteristics of the engine under such operation. Two categories of fuels were evaluated in this program, off-specification diesel fuels and non-diesel fuels; the former is the topic of this paper. Off-specification diesel fuels were defined as those fuels with one or more properties which did not lie in the 64</page><page sequence="46">800331-800335 currently accepted range of specifications for Number 2 diesel fuel. Cetane number, viscosity, and distillation range were systematically varied as independently of other properties as was possible by blending various fuel components. Limiting fuel properties were defined and, where possible, the influences of fuel properties on performance and emissions were determined. 800331. Comparative Performance and Emission Char- acteristics of Petroleum, Oil Shale and Tar Sands Derived Diesel Fuels. A. D. Tuteja and D. W. Clark, Detroit Diesel Allison. The performance and emission characteristics of diesel fuels derived from oil shale and tar sands have been compared with those of regular petroleum based 2 diesel fuel. The comparison based on diesel engine tests, shows only slight differences in performance and emissions. These differences can be related to physico-chemical properties. The effect of fuel bound nitrogen, which might be present in shale derived fuel, on NOx emission was also studied. No significant NOx contribution due to fuel bound nitrogen was observed in the present test. A possible explanation of this insignificant conversion of fuel bound nitrogen is that NO attains equilibrium in major NO producing regions. Based on this explanation, it is possible that there will be more fuel bound nitrogen conversion at retarded injection timings, necessary for present and future low emission engines. 800332. 'Motoring Which?' - Eighteen Years of Human Factors in Comparative Car Testing - An Historical Review. B. Shackel, Dept. of Human Sciences, Univ. of Technology (Loughborough/United Kingdom). In 1961 the Consumers' Association in Britain set up a car test unit, and in 1962 the first car test reports were published. These later became the 'Motoring Which?' quarterly supplement to 'Which?' magazine. The methods and general sequence of the CA car testing procedure are first outlined. The Human Factors contribution to this testing programme is then described. The contribution broadly takes two forms. First, human factors reference data and guidance are provided to assist with the planning and interpretation of the objective measurement programme run by the test unit. Second, an extensive Human Factors Questionnaire (HFQ) programme is organised, and the results are reported, quarterly for every group of test cars. The initial planning of the Human Factors contri- bution is described; then the essential features of the HFQ programme, and its successive stages of development over the years to the current form with computerized analysis and output are reviewed. Finally, various aspects of the programme and other relevant data are discussed under the heading of evalu- ation. 1980 SA E Transactions 800334. Risk Behavior in Driving. T. H. Rockwell and Robert S. Miller, The Ohio State Univ. This paper begins with a discussion of the various types of risk behavior found in automobile driving. A model is proposed which describes a perceptual approach to risk acceptance in specific driving manuevers. Risk acceptance in lane merging within freeway construction zones is discussed and exemplified by field observations of merging in construction zones. The short gaps accepted led to an experimental study to examine gap acceptance thresholds and driver gap estimation capabilities. Studies were conducted both statically and dynamically at 55 miles per hour. Subjects elect short gaps (under 100') and gaps with less than 1 3/4 seconds at 55 miles per hour. Shorter rear gaps are accepted than front gaps. Gaps are grossly underestimated in both static and dynamic experiments. No difference was found for left vs. right merges and use of mirror vs. direct vision for rear gap estimation. The experimental data was consistent with field observations. 800335. (P-86) Light-Duty Diesel NOx-HC-Particulate Trade-Off Studies. W. R. Wade, Ford Motor Co., Dearborn, MI. The emission control potential of typical divided chamber, light-duty Diesel engines was investigated by using engine dynamometer mapping tests, vehicle tests with engines modified to implement selected control strategies for reduced emission levels, experiments with combustion system modifications, end evaluations of techniques for the exhaust treatment of particulate emissions. A dynamometer mapping program was conducted on a Diesel engine with a swirl chamber combustion system to determine the emission control capability with modu- lated EGR and fuel injection timing. Emission projections from mapping tests, confirmed by selected vehicle test results, indicated that the low mileage engineering objec- tives assumed for the .41/3.4/1.0/. 6 gm/mi HC/CO/NOx/particulate emission level may be ap- proached in experimental laboratory vehicles up to 3000 lb. inertia weight with optimized control systems. Particu- late emissions limit the capability to meet the emission objective levels at higher inertia weights. Experimental Diesel combustion system modifications did not result in significant improvements in NOx, HC, and particulate emissions but caused a loss in fuel economy and/or power. Techniques for collecting and periodically oxidizing particulate emissions were investigated. The regeneration of a particulate trap was achieved at a high load engine dynamometer operating condition during a steady state simulation of the AMA cycle. 1980 SA E Transactions 65</page><page sequence="47">800336-800350 800336. (P-86) The Oxidation of Soot Deposits from Diesel Engines. K.Otto, M. H. Sieg, M. Zinbo and L. Bartosiewicz, Engineering and Research Staff, Ford Motor Co., Dearborn, MI. Combustion and gasification characteristics of deposits from diesel exhaust were investigated. Properties which may influence soot reactivity, such as morphology, specific surface area, organic adsórbate, and occlusions of inorganic origin were characterized. Effects of temper- ature, oxygen pressure, and stepwise combustion on the reactivity were determined. Ignition and combustion kinetics of various soot deposits were measured gravi- metrically, and requirements for fast soot oxidation in the presence of an exhaust gas were assessed. Reliable completion of soot combustion after ignition depends strongly on oxygen pressure and bulk density of the soot. The ignition temperature can be lowered by suitable catalysts. Organic molecules, adsorbed on the soot surface, may also have a significant influence on the ignition of soot deposits. The results confirm that soot particles suspended in exhaust gas are not oxidized significantly under the conditions prevailing in diesel exhaust. 1980 SA E Transactions 800338. (P-86) The Development of a High Efficiency Diesel Exhaust Particulate Filter. Lynn P. Tessier, Esso Resources Canada Ltd.; and Harry F. Sullivan, Gordon M. Bragg and Clark E. Hermanee, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., Univ. of Waterloo. Several materials have been evaluated for their potential as a filter medium in a high-efficiency diesel exhaust particulate filter. One material, a graphite treated woven fiberglass cloth, was chosen for further development work. The filtration and backpressure characteristics of this material were examined over a wide range of face velocities and exhaust particle loadings. From these results an equation to estimate the required filter area for a given engine application, desired service interval and maximum backpressure was developed. 800339. History of Automotive Lighting in Europe. Philip W. Maurer, Engrg. Consultant. This paper is á brief review of the development of automotive lighting in Europe with emphasis on the years after World War I. An explanation of the committee structure for developing regulations is included. The causes of some of the major differences between Europe and U.S. lighting are explained and a plea is made for harmonization, which is just now getting underway. 800340. Automotive Application of Electroluminescent Lighting. Paul H. Greenlee, Grimes Div., Mid- land-Ross Corp.; and Robert W. Crum, Buick Motor Div., General Motors Corp. Downsizing of today's automobile has created component packaging problems for the automotive engineer. One solution has been the application of electroluminescent (E.L.) lighting in place of incandescent lighting. In addition to superior packaging and flexibility, this lighting provides softer, more uniform appearance with minimal weight and power consumption. The purpose of this paper is to explain E.L. and its application to the automotive industry. 800343. A New Swedish Army Off-Road Vehicle Gen- eration. Stig A. K. Areskoug, Swedish Defence Materiel Administration. A new off-road vehicle generation for the Swedish Army has been developed. It is now being produced. The program covers two off-road truck families, one artic- ulated tracked all terrain vehicle and one motorcycle. A procurement method aiming at minimized and controlled life cycle cost has been applied. In this an incentive, which will give the finally proved maintenance quality of the product an impact on the unit price, has been introduced. With the procurement method as a background the four concepts are presented. Finally the results and experiences of the procedure are discussed. 800348.

Liquid Crystal Displays for Automotive Appli- cation. Holm Baeger, VDO Adolf Schindling AG (Schwalbach/West Germany). In a comparison of the most diverse display techniques for automotive application, the best-suited display appears to be the liquid crystal twisted nematic (TN) cell. This paper contains a functional description of such a liquid crystal display and a discussion of the still unsolved problems specific to automotive application. The overall concepts of display design and drive systems are examined. 800350. Use of a Microcomputer in an Electronic Fuel Gage Module. Richard C. Martinec, Ford Motor Co. The Electronic Fuel Gage being used in models of the 1980 Mark/Lincoln/Thunderbird/Cougar XR7 has min- imal basic system logic requirements. However, by incorporating a microcomputer, it was possible to reduce the cost and complexity of other components in the module. As the design and development of the Electronic Fuel Gage progressed, the need for additional features 66</page><page sequence="48">800351-800357 surfaced that had not been identified at the beginning of the program. The microcomputer provided the flexibility to add these features and still meet the cost and timing constraints of the program. 800351. Analog Displays Using Fluorescent Indicator Panel Technology. N. Sato, Electron Devices Sales Div., Nippon Electric Co. Ltd.; T. Miya- zaki and J. Suehiro, Engineering Dept., Nippon Electric Kagoshima Ltd. Recently developed analog fluorescent indicator panels (FIPs) of linear and circular bar graph types are introduced. This paper discusses the technical problems and improvement methods made in the development of analog FIPs. Particularly fine pattern technologies on substrates and improvements of grid edge effects with dynamic drive conditions (including driving methods) are described. 800352. Capacitance Fuel Measurement for Automotive Applications. John D. Freeman, Talley Indus- tries. Fuel measurement by capacitance techniques have been widely used for aircraft applications. Recent develop- ments in integrated circuits now make it possible to adapt this method economically to the automobile; with the advantages of increased accuracy, readability and relia- bility. The method is compared briefly with other ap- proaches. An automotive fuel measurement system is described. It takes advantage of the microcomputer's capabilities to eliminate errors caused by variations in dielectric constant of the fuel; and to adapt the system to fuel tanks of differing shapes and sizes. 800353. Definition of Driver Information Instrumentation Features. Edward S. Greene and Douglas R. Sendelbach, Ford Motor Co. Many new driver information features are being added to today's vehicles. This paper addresses the utility of these features to the customer and the functional parameters which must be specified in order to assure optimum performance of these features. 800354. Comparison of Visual Recognition Time of Ana- logue and Digital Displays in Automobiles. Ichiro Ishii, Toyo Univ. (Kawagoe City /Sai tama- ken/Japan). Various instrument meters, including a speedometer, are being installed in automobiles, and a driver reads numeral information on the meters when it is necessary. Ana- logue-type and digital-type indicators are used as the method to indicate numerals on the meter. This study is to find which type of meter is easier to read and keeps the driver more safe, by using an eye camera to compare the visual recognition time on different types of roads and during various weather conditions. The driver operates an automobile by holding a steering wheel with his hands while carefully watching the road in front of him. He should always watch the road in front of him because averting his eyes may cause a traffic accident, possibly a fatal one, especially while driving at high speed on an expressway. However, it is impossible to drive on the street by looking forward only. Occasionally, he must see the meters beyond the steering wheel to check the time, speed, fuel level, etc. The moment that he is looking at meters is the moment he is not looking at the road in front of him. Although it is always the most dangerous time from a traffic safety viewpoint, he cannot completely avoid looking at meters. Because of this, it is important to lessen the time, as much as possible, to look at meters. This study is to find a better method to indicate numerals on the meter for this purpose. 800355. Engineering Problems and the Trade Offs in the Design of High Technology Devices. Roy Richards, Signetics Corp., Sunnyvale, CA. Engineering relationships between high technology semi- conductor manufacturers and automotive manufacturers are becoming increasingly important as the amount of electronics on an automobile increases dramatically in the 1980's. Understanding of the economic, technological, chronological and production relationships is outlined as it affects design of automotive electronic systems. The most used semiconductor technologies are reviewed with data on technical and economical guidelines. Methods of estimating circuit cost using defect density and chip complexity are illustrated. Partitioning and development timing are important aspects of system design and along with product engineering issues require close communi- cation. 800356. The Single-Chip Microcomputer Revolution. Mitchell Gooze, American Microsystems, Inc., Santa Clara, CA. The single-chip microcomputer is coming into its own as the state-of-the-art is MOS integrated circuit design advances. LSI technology made possible the original single-chip microcomputers and VLSI technology is bringing about a revolution in single-chip microcomputer capability. This paper discusses the world of single-chip microcomputers from low-end four bit architectures to high performance 16-bit architectures and describes some of the trade-offs involved in each product area. 800357. A Monolithic Voltage Regulator for Automotive Electronic Systems. Bernard Miller, National Semiconductor Corp. A new five volt instrumentation voltage regulator has been designed for automotive electronic systems. Very low quiescent current and low dropout voltage promises applications in standby systems, such as microprocessor memory supplies, while reverse battery protection and 67</page><page sequence="49">800359-800367 transient protection shields the regulator and load from the hazards of the automotive electrical environment. 800359. "itron" Vacuum Fluorescent Display Dot Matrix Graphic Display with Characteristics. Keiji Aoyagi, Ise Electronics Corp. (Mie/Japan). In recent years, with the development of information system products, the types of display devices utilized are becoming more sophisticated and complicated. Displays of earlier stages are now being replaced by 5x7 dot type displays which allow the display of functional symbols as well as alphanumerics. The dot type display is being developed into a dot matrix type as a more sophisticated product, in the latest stage. A great feature of the dot matrix type display is that it allows display not only of numerals, the alphabet, and other functional symbols but also of graphic features. 800360. The Performance of Dichroic Displays for Au- tomotive Instrument Panel Use. Derick Jones and Bhupendrarai Desai, Integrated Display Systems Inc. Conventional liquid crystal displays, which are based upon twisted nematic materials, suffer from several problems: their polarizers limit their viewing angles and make them sensitive to humidity, they are fairly slow, and they do not lend themselves readily to multicolor displays. A new dichroic dye LCD from Integrated Display Systems Inc., overcomes these problems because it operates on an absorption, rather than a polarization, principle. The new display, essentially, is a light valve. It is opaque in the off state, appearing black when exposed to incident light. With an applied field, the LCD becomes transmitting, showing the color (or colors) of the reflector. The operation of the dichroic dye display involves a phase change from the cholesteric state, in which the dye absorbs light, to the nonabsorbing nematic state. The paper will discuss in detail the performance of dichroic displays with respect to automotive requirements. 1980 SA E Transactions 800361. (SP-460) A Radiometric Test to Determine the Lubricant Effect on Journal Bearing Load Ca- pacity. Arnold O. DeHart, Richard C. Rosen- berg, Robert F. Hill and Eric W. Schneider, General Motors Research Labs., General Mo- tors Corp., Warren, MI. Radiometric techniques have been developed and success- fully applied to journal bearing studies in a unidirectional bearing test machine. These techniques, which involve the detection of wear debris from a radioactive (1,3Sn) test bearing, were used to determine bearing load capacity with both Newtonian and non-Newtonian lubricants. Results indicate that the radiometric method can rapidly provide information that correlates with other laboratory and engine test data. 800363. (SP-460) Development of a High Shear Rate Capillary Viscometer for Engine Oils. Samuel W. Rein and David L. Alexander, Beacon Research Labs., Texaco, Inc., Beacon, NY. A high shear rate capillary viscometer has been developed. It is suitable for measuring the viscosity of engine oils at shear rates of 105 to 106 s1 and at temperatures to 150°C, conditions which are within the range experienced by oils in automobile engines. It has proven useful for evaluating the total shear stability of VI-improved oils and is also being used for interpreting laboratory engine friction testing. 800364. (SP-460) Determining Frictional Characteristics of Engine Oils by Engine Friction and Viscosity Measurements. Julian H. Dancy, Hubert T. Marshall and Charles R. Oliver, Beacon Re- search Labs., Texaco, Inc., Beacon, NY. The frictional response of an engine to a particular engine oil depends on the combined effects of the oil's viscosity and additives which modify rubbing friction during boundary lubrication. A single-cylinder engine friction test is described which measures the frictional charac- teristics of an oil. These frictional results are integrated with high shear rate viscosity measurements, enabling the individual effects of viscosity and additives on friction level to be viewed separately. 800366. (SP-460) Low Temperature Viscosity Character- istics of Used Engine Oils. F. E. Didot, Šuntech, Inc., Marcus Hook, PA; and T. F. Lonstrup, Exxon Chemical Co., Linden, NJ. This paper presents the data from an SAE F&amp;L 2 investigation into the viscosity increase at -18°C of crankcase oils as a function of mileage, engine type, type of service, viscosity grade and base oil type (petroleum or synthetic). The total data base from the survey is 1,530 viscosity measurements. These have been classified to show the viscosity increase for each of the major viscosity grades. The data show that 50% of all SAE 5W-X and SAE 10W-X oils go out of grade by 2,500 miles of use. SAE 15W-X and SAE 20W-X oils show better stability and remain in their respective low temperature viscosity grades for approximately 11,000 miles. While this survey has quantified the amount of viscosity increase in typical passenger car service, it does not provide any data to show the effects of this viscosity increase on startability in the field. A second survey is currently underway to cover this and the results will be published in a future paper. Discussion: L. A. Schaap, Amoco Oil Co. 1980 SAE Transactions 800367. (SP-460) Low Shear, Low Temperature Prop- erties of Engine Oils - Techniques With the Brookfield Viscometer. Theodore W. Selby and David A. Piasecki, SAVANT, Inc. 68</page><page sequence="50">800368-800372 The authors' present low-shear, low-temperature studies on engine oils obtained by a new technique utilizing a SI VERSO programmable cold-bath in conjunction with the Brookfield LVT viscometer. The Brookfield/SIVERSO technique seems to respond sensi- tively to the yield stress of gelled engine oils. The relatively simple technique predicts the Borderline Pumpability Temperature of both air-binding and flow-limited engine oils with reasonably good correlation. Lastly, a prelim- inary examination of the agreement of the new technique with the conventional, air-bath Brookfield technique is shown. The correlation is very good and suggests that the Brookfield/SIVERSO technique may have wider auto- motive applications. 800368. Development of a Columbium-Phosphorous High-Strength Cold-Rolled Steel. D. W. Dickin- son, J. E. Franklin, J. R. Nappier, D. F. D'Abate and H. W. Grimmett, Republic Steel Corp. As a result of both laboratory and mill studies, a high-strength cold-rolled sheet steel containing colum- bium and phosphorus was developed. The chemistry and processing schedule are critically balanced to produce a steel with yield strength levels of at least 40 ksi, with good spot weldability and acceptable low surface contaminants for good paintability. Because of a limited alloy content, these steels can be produced as wide, light gage strip with surface quality suitable for automotive outer body panels. 800369. A Study on the Selection of High Strength Steel Sheets for Auto-Body Panels. M. Kojima and Y. Hayashi, Sumitomo Metal Industries, Ltd. In search for thinner auto-body panels, investigation has been made on the level of yield strength of high strength steel sheets in view of the fact that the dent resistance must be at least equal to that of today's mild steel panels. Dent resistance should be evaluated for slight dent, and loss of the dent resistance caused by thinning is most remarkably seen in this case. Rephosphorized aluminum killed steel with bake-hardenability is most favourable, taking the necessary resistance to slight dent and the formability into consideration. 800370. The Use of Increased Curvature to Reduce the Weight of Body Panels. B. S. Levy and A. G. Preban, Inland Steel Co. Current trends in the automotive industry seem to be to use the minimum panel curvature that is possible, on the theory that a box provides the most space at the least weight. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the premise that increased curvature of body panels results in a net weight reduction, since the contribution of the increase in surface area is less than the reduced thickness resulting from the increased overall stiffness of panels with increased curvature. In assessing this concept, an expression has been developed for calculating the surface area as a function of panel curvature and panel size in two perpendicular directions. Using this relationship and previously published Chrysler work on the effect of these same two curvature and panel size variables on panel stiffness, an expression is developed for percent weight change at constant stiffness. In the paper, the percent weight change at constant stiffness is described in terms of the relevant curvatures and panel spans for conditions of interest to the auto- motive industry. It is shown that the basic premise is correct and that increased curvature can, in fact, result in lighter body panels at constant stiffness. These results are not linear, and considerable attention is devoted to assessing the magnitude of the weight savings for a range of geometrical conditions. Other factors to be covered include illustrations of the effect of curvature on ap- pearance and some comments on where high strength steel is important to prevent denting when panel thickness is reduced. Formability is also covered briefly. These latter comments will also be based essentially on the published literature and personal experience. 1980 SA E Transactions 800371. Energy Absorption of Plastic, Steel, and Alu- minum Shells Under Impact Conditions. R. C. Van Kuren, Forming and Mechanical Evalu- ation Section, Research Dept., Bethlehem Steel Corp. The energy absorption of several automotive materials, i.e., reinforced plastics, steel, and aluminum, was deter- mined at 70 and -40 F (21 and -40 C) by crushing curved shell specimens at impact speeds up to 25 mph (40 km/h). This specimen, which resembles a small body part, permitted comparing the energy-absorption characteristics of widely diverse engineering materials under identical simulative highway conditions. Steel absorbed up to 20 times more total energy than did the reinforced plastics and over twice that absorbed by aluminum for the same thickness. Aluminum absorbed more energy per unit weight than the other materials, but steel was considerably more cost-effective. 800372. Energy Absorption by the Structural Collapse of Spot-Welded Sheet Metal Sections. P. H. Thorn- ton, Ford Motor Co., Dearborn, MI. The crush characteristics of various spot-welded sections were assessed on the basis of material property and geometry contributions, according to three structural collapse models. It was found that the predicted mean crush loads differed significantly from the measured values in many cases, particularly for the heavier wall sections, when models based upon effective plate width concepts were used. An alternative method was shown to be applicable to any geometry and clearly revealed that flange proportions larger relative to the section size, or, extreme ratios of side dimensions were deleterious with 69</page><page sequence="51">800373-800383 regard to the crush resistance of the section on a relative density basis. 1980 SA E Transactions 800373. Stress-Relief Annealed High-Strength Sheet Steel - Properties and Applications. J. v. D. Forstmann, Research Dept., Bethlehem Steel Corp., Bethlehem, PA. The high-strength properties of stress-relief annealed (SRA) steel are developed by processing rather than by alloying. The mechanical properties and their reproduci- bility as well as the properties commonly used to predict formability are described. Examples of parts made from different strength levels of SRA are illustrated. 800374. Fatigue of Welded High Strength Low Alloy Steels. Kon-Mei W. Ewing, General Motors Technical Center, Warren, MI; Michael L. Wilson, Terra Tek, Inc., Salt Lake City, Utah, Roger A. Heimbuch, Dale K. Watney and Albert F. Houchens, General Motors Technical Center, Warren, MI. The effects of arc welding on the fatigue strengths of three HSLA steels and 1006 mild steel for joint and loading configurations typical of automotive applications have been investigated. It was found that the 107 cycle fatigue limit stresses of smooth specimens varied according to the tensile strengths while the fatigue characteristics of all four steels after welding were nearly identical in the 5 x 105 - 107 cycle range. Long life fatigue data from both the smooth and welded specimens were used to determine the applicability of Peterson's Equation. Predicted Kf's were 13 to 17% larger for SAE-950, SAE-980 and 1006 steels, but was 22% less for GM-980X, compared to the experimental results. A fatigue crack initiation study was conducted at the stress range that would result in a total life of 105 cycles for each alloy. Initiation of cracks .025 cm deep occurred at approximately 88% of total life for the three HSLA steels and 55% of total life for 1006 mild steel. 800377. Robots and Automobiles: Applications, Econom- ics, and the Future. Joseph F. Engelberger, Unimation Inc. There is a proper love affair between robots and automobiles. Over 55% of the world's industrial robots work in the automobile industry. This paper will explore the relationship; starting with the definition of a robot, proceeding through types available, describing the appli- cations, then considering economic and social justifi- cation, and, finally, speculating on what lies in store in the decade of the 1980s. 800378. A Vision-Controlled Robot for Part Transfer. Steven W. Holland, Lothar Rossol, Mitchel R. Ward and Robert Dewar, General Motors Corp., Warren, MI. A vision-based robot system capable of picking up parts randomly placed on a moving conveyor belt is described. The vision subsystem, operating in a visually noisy environment typical of manufacturing plants, determines the position and orientation of parts on the belt. The robot tracks the parts and transfers them to a predetermined location. This system can be easily retrained for a wide class of complex curved parts and demonstrates that future systems have a high potential for production plant use. 800381. Assembly with Robots (?) - Design Tools or Technology Question. J. L. Nevins and D. E. Whitney, Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, Inc., Cambridge, MA. Assembly research comprises the definitive description of how parts interact during assembly (called Part Mating Science), the collection of part mating processes into systems that assemble products, and the integration of this process into the factory as a whole. Products can be assembled by four techniques: manual labor, special purpose machines, programmable systems, or hybrids of the above. Each system includes material handling, parts feeding, assembly, inspection, and may include manu- facturing. Issues of design include technology, part mating, product system design tools, and economics. 800382. Electronic Coordination of Joint Motions for Terrain - Adaptive Robot Vehicles. R. B. McGhee, K. W. Olson and R. L. Briggs, Dept. of Electrical Engrg., Ohio State Univ., Columbus, OH. Significant advances in mobility for off-road vehicles may be possible through active control of suspension system articulations. This concept seems to be particularly appropriate to robot vehicles guided remotely by a human operator. This paper presents a general discussion of the motion coordination problems which must be solved by a control computer for vehicles of this type and presents some laboratory results obtained with an experimental six-legged walking machine. It is concluded that the state of knowledge and the availability of hardware is sufficient to justify consideration of practical applications of this class of machines including both vehicles with and without a rolling element in contact with the ground. 800383. Recent Advances in Robotics Research. Fred Kelly and Ronald Huston, Dept. of Engrg. Science, Univ. of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH. A summary of the state-of-the-art of current research efforts in robotics is presented. Various aspects of robotics research are discussed including kinematics, geometry, controls, locomotion, sensing, and artificial intelligence. It is found that in each of these areas there exist important research needs and research opportunities. It is shown that much remains to be done before industry, and society in 70</page><page sequence="52">800384-800391 general, will begin to enjoy the full benefit of this important technology. 800384. (SP-461) Differences in the Trip Attributes of Drivers with High and Low Accident Rates. Martin E. H. Lee, Matthew F. Glover and Paul W. Eavy, Research and Evaluation Div., Mich- igan Dept. of State. In a large survey project to create a microdata base on vehicle ownership and usage in Michigan, 7581 respon- dents were grouped by a multivariate procedure into meaningful population subgroups with differing accident rates. Age, sex and residence location were the most effective of several biographical factors in distinguishing groups with mean rates ranging from 3.8 to 15.4 accidents per million miles of driving. These groups were analyzed for differences in driving trip attributes: light condition, road type, vehicle class, passenger load, trip purpose and perceived public transportation substitutability. It was found that of the six, passenger load and trip purpose had the least relevance to accident rate. Vehicle size seemed a promising factor, but despite high small car exposure in (especially youthful) high accident rate groups, disaggre- gate data showed the subgroup using small cars to have lower rates. It was concluded that no simple combination of qualitative exposure measures, even when collected with the most detailed microdata techniques, promises to predict accident rate with high success, and that some conventional assumptions about the relative hazardous- ness of certain types of driving should be re-evaluated. 1980 SA E Transactions 800385. (SP-461) Literacy - A Human Factor in Driving Performance. Patricia F. Waller and Robert G. Hall, Univ. of North Carolina, Highway Safety Research Center. Literate and illiterate drivers were compared on the basis of their driving histories and characteristics of their crashes. Illiterate drivers had significantly more crashes and convictions than the general driving public. When compared to matched control drivers, illiterate drivers still had more convictions and crashes. Their crashes tended to be in older vehicles that were more likely to have reported defects. They were also more likely to be driving trucks. Recommendations are presented for a comprehensive coordinated approach to encouraging acquisition of literacy skills which in turn may be reflected in improved driving performance. 1980 SAE Transactions 800387. (SP-461) Accident Investigations - A Case for New Perceptions and Methodologies. Ludwig Benner, Jr., National Transportation Safety Board. At least 5 different perceptions of the accident phenom- enon, 44 different reasons for investigating accidents, 7 investigative processes, 6 general methodologies, and 3 differing types of output requirements affect accident investigations. These differences reflect the lack of a unifying conceptual framework for accident investigation and safety; corrupt data search, selection, organization and reporting decisions during investigations; and result in spurious accident data. A tentative unifying perception of accident phenom- ena, with supporting assumptions, principles and rules of procedure for their investigation was synthesized from the findings. Four games simulating the resultant accident investigation process have been developed. The process has been applied to improve hazardous materials emer- gency response decision making, and evaluation of safety countermeasures. Discussion: H. Wakeland, National Transportation Safety Board. 1980 SAE Transactions 800388. (SP-461) Seat Beit Usage and Risk Taking in Driving Behavior. Calvin R. von Buseck, Leonard Evans, Donald E. Schmidt and Paul Wasielewski, General Motors Research Labs., Warren, MI. This study tested the hypothesis that seat belt usage is related to driver risk taking in car-following behavior. Individual vehicles on a Detroit area freeway were monitored to identify seat belt users and nonusers. Headways between successive vehicles in the traffic stream were also measured to provide a behavioral indicator of driver risk taking. Results showed that nonusers of seat belts tended to follow other vehicles closer than did users. Users were also less likely than nonusers to follow other vehicles at very short headways (one second or less). The implications of these findings for occupant safety in rear end collisions are discussed. 1980 SAE Transactions 800390. (SP-461) What Causes Accidents - A Semantic Analysis. Frank A. Haight, Pennsylvania State Univ. Semantic problems have biased traffic safety programs. This paper analyzes the arguments which have been put forward for and against using the words 'accident' and 'cause of an accident' and shows how attitudes towards these questions can influence attitudes towards coun- termeasures. 1980 SAE Transactions 800391. (SP-461) Analysis of Unsafe Driving Actions - Data Requirements and Methodological Issues. John R. Treat, Ralph K. Jones and Kent B. Joscelyn, Univ. of Michigan, Highway Safety Research Inst. An approach to the study of driver behavior resulting in accidents is described. It involves the integration of statistical and clinical methods for assessing accident causation. Under this approach, clinical data are used to 71</page><page sequence="53">800392-800397 identify and prioritize driver behaviors for study, and to assist in developing operational definitions and data collection protocols. Accident and comparable exposure data on the incidence and circumstances of each unsafe action are collected. These data are then compared and statistically evaluated to determine the frequency of such behaviors, the risk associated with their occurrence, and the magnitude and circumstances of their involvement in causing accidents. The need for such data in the development of countermeasure programs is described, and a preliminary listing of U D As for study is presented. 1980 SA E Transactions 800392. (SP-461) Statistical Methods for Analyzing Ac- cident Risk - A Prototype System. Michael L. Squires and Rex D. Hume, Inst, for Research in Public Safety, Indiana Univ.; and Yosef Höch- berg, Tel Aviv Univ. This paper discusses the problems and prospects for a system for statistically analyzing relationships between pre-crash factors and accidents using accident data from the National Accident Sampling System (NASS). The bulk of the paper presents a description and tentative results from a field trial of a prototype system in Monroe County, Indiana, using exposure data newly collected for the field trial and pre-existing accident data. The authors concluded that the development of such an analysis system, although difficult, was feasible if the objectives of such a system took into account the scarcity of accident data. 1980 SA E Transactions 800393. A Statistical Analysis of the Effect of MMT Concentration on Hydrocarbon Emissions. G. A. Hughmark and B. A. Sobel, Ethyl Corporation, Baton Rouge, LA. Statistical analyses of extensive fleet test data frpm several sources with the gasoline antiknock additive, MMT, provide mathematical models for each car make that show the effect of MMT and mileage accumulation on hydro- carbon emissions. These models show: 1. Engine-out hydrocarbons increase linearly with MMT concentration in the fuel up to 50,000 miles, which is the limit of the data. 2. MMT results in enhancement of catalyst con- verter efficiency, which also shows a response to the MMT concentration in the fuel. 800394. Catalytic Purification of Automotive Exhaust Gases Under European Conditions. E. Kober- stein, H. D. Pletka and H. Völker, Degussa Wolfgang. Recently developed catalytic systems on a precious metal/metal support basis were tested under European conditions using low leaded gasoline (0.15 g/1). Catalyst aging was carried out on European middle class cars with an automatic roller-dynamometer over 50 000 km. The AMA durability test cycle was applied. The deterioration factor of the catalytic unit was small enough under these conditions to fulfill emission standards proposed by the German "Umweltbundesamt" (UBA). Road tests with similar catalytic systems confirmed the results obtained with the AMA durability test. 800395. Emissions From Catalyst Equipped California Cars in Customer Service. R. H. Cross, Cali- fornia Air Resources Board. The in-use performance of emission control systems on California passenger cars is monitored by annual sur- veillance programs where consumer-owned cars are emission tested at the California Air Resources Board's Haagen-Smit Laboratory. Recently, the third catalyst vehicle surveillance program was completed and the Air Resources Board now has sufficient data to update the "emission factors" for the catalyst equipped California cars which have been estimated by the U.S. Environ- mental Protection Agency. Analysis of in-use surveillance data suggest that the EPA emission factors under-predict hydrocarbon emissions for California cars and that they over-predict carbon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen emissions. In addition, a significant benefit is shown for an annual inspection and maintenance program. 800396. The Exhaust Emission and Fuel Consumption Characteristics of an Engine During Warmup - A Vehicle Study. Donald J. Pozniak, Engine Research Dept., General Motors Research Labs., Warren, MI. The relative contribution of pollutants emitted during vehicle warmup has been magnified because the out- standing performance of contemporary catalytic con- verters has nearly eliminated the pollutants emitted from fully warm vehicles. Using an 1814-kg vehicle, the effects of air-fuel ratio and spark advance on exhaust emissions and fuel consumption were assessed for the warmup portion of the Federal Test Procedure. Probable causes of differences between cold- and warm-engine emissions and fuel consumption were identified. During warmup, HC and CO emissions were mini- mum at air-fuel ratios of 14.5 and 16, respectively. Minimum fuel consumption also occurred within this range. Both HC and CO emissions were insensitive to ignition timing, but retarding the timing decreased NOx emissions significantly. Disregarding driveability, a warmup air-fuel ratio of 16 was judged to offer the best emissions/fuel economy tradeoff. 800397. Vehicle Misfueling in California During 1979. Thomas C. Austin and Mary Eichbauer, Cali- fornia Air Resources Board. A survey of vehicle refueling practices in California during the gasoline shortage of 1979 indicates that the use of leaded gasoline in catalyst equipped vehicles was occur- ring at a rate of about 1.6%. This 1.6% "misfueling" rate is lower than has been predicted by the U.S. Environmental 72</page><page sequence="54">800398-800402 Protection Agency and is almost exclusively the result of the refueling that occurs at self-service gasoline pumps. About three-quarters of the misfueled vehicles were apparently operated on leaded gasoline routinely. Based on the effect that leaded fuel has on the exhaust emission characteristics of catalyst equipped vehicles it is estimated that misfueling in California is increasing hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions by about 4% and 1.6%, respectively from late model passenger cars. The extent to which misfueling will become a greater problem in the future may depend on: (1) the availability of unleaded gasoline, (2) the cost differential between leaded and unleaded gasoline, (3) the tendency toward increased misfueling with increasing vehicle age, (4) the extent to which filler neck designs will be altered to increase the difficulty in modifying the "lead restrictor" so that leaded fuel nozzles can be used, and (5) the existence of inspection programs which identify and cause the correction of misfueled vehicles. 800398. General Motors Progress Towards the Federal Research Objective Emission Levels. Bruce E. Zemke and James J. Gumbleton, Engineering Staff, General Motors Corporation. Six vehicles that have achieved the Federal research objective emission levels at low mileage are described. Two vehicles have completed 50,000 miles of durability below the .41/3.4/.41 g/mi levels. Two vehicles failed these emission levels by 10,000 miles. There is a loss in fuel economy of about 1% and the driveability ranged from non-commercial to borderline commercial. The ongoing program objectives are to reduce the sensitivity of these systems to emission deterioration and driveability defects and to reduce the fuel economy losses. 800399. Development of Closed Loop Secondary Air Control Three-Way Catalyst System. T. Toy oda, Y. Yamakawa, T. Inoue, K. Oishi and K. Hattorf, Engine Research &amp; Emission Control Dept., Higashifuji Technical Center, Toyota Motor Co., Ltd. The three-way catalyst system using a carburetor still needs a lot of improvement for meeting emission stan- dards of U.S. for 1981, California for 1983, and Japanese for 1978. In order to improve air fuel ratio control capability of a carburetor three-way catalyst system, Toyota has developed a closed loop secondary air control system. In this system air fuel ratio is controlled not in the induction but in the exhaust. The short control loop of this system provides high air-fuel ratio oscillation frequency and rapid correction ability for maintaining the exhaust air-fuel ratio at stoichiometric. This gives the system a higher conversion efficiency. This paper describes the performance characteristics and an analysis of the system with regards to emission, driveability and fuel economy. 1980 SA E Transactions 800400. Calibration of Chassis Dynamometers for Emis- sion-and Fuel Economy Testing Using Wheel Torque Meters. D. Schürmann, Volkswagenwerk AG (Germany); L. Johnsson, AB Volvo (Sweden); and W. Berg, Daimler-Benz AG (Germany). A general calibration method for chassis dynamometers is an important prerequisite for obtaining comparable emissions - and fuel economy test results with reasonable confidence. At the test facilities of Volvo, Daimler-Benz and Volkswagen the torque calibration principle was studied using rear wheel and front wheel driven cars of the above manufacturers. The driving resistances on the road or on a dynamometer can be directly extracted from the torque data measured in the driven wheels at constant car speeds. The dynamic behaviour of the test car is described by the mean torque over a certain driving cycle, thereby including also acceleration/deceleration effects. Wheel torque measuring systems can easily be adapted to vehicle types of different manufacturers. The torque principle can also be applied to other fields than the calibration of dynamometers. Examples are vehicle performance measurements and the determination of tire losses. 1980 SA E Transactions 800401. The Effect of Noise Legislation on Vehicle Diesel Engine Design. P. E. Waters, Vehicle Standards and Engrg. Div., Dept. of Transport (United Kingdom). Proposals in both Europe and the United States for future reductions in vehicle noise limits can be expected to have radical effects on the design and installation of truck diesel engines. A review of published accounts of quietened trucks shows that mostly engine enclosure has been used. There are short term incentives for manu- facturers to use this approach, but it is not the most cost effective solution in the long term and has numerous problems including that of maintaining noise levels throughout the service life of the vehicle. Greater incentive is needed for radical redesign of the diesel engine to make it inherently quiet and to minimise both the on-cost and the energy penalty of noise reduction. This paper develops the theoretical background to this problem. Starting from the basic characteristics of vehicle noise, a philosophy of noise control is developed and practical means of achieving the desired noise control are discussed. 800402. Engine Noise Due to Mechanical Impacts at Pistons and Bearings. N. Lalor, E. C. Grover and T. Priede, Institute of Sound and Vibration Research, Univ. of Southampton (England). In this paper the noise of engines of different size, duty and combustion system are compared. Measured differ- 73</page><page sequence="55">800403-800410 enees, not consistent with combustion charges, are analysed in detail and these differences are shown to be the result of mechanical impacts. Results suggest that the kinetic energy of impact is not the only significant parameter influencing mechanical noise, and in the general case the magnitude of the force accelerating a component across a clearance must also be considered. The analysis shows that the dominant parameters affecting the magnitude of the impact change with speed and size of engine and offers an explanation for the apparent discrepancies observed in some previously recorded data. 800403. Combustion Noise Variability on a DI Diesel Engine. D. F. Kabele, John Deere Product Engineering Center, Waterloo, Iowa. Cylinder pressure excitation is a major source of diesel engine noise. A data acquisition system for obtaining harmonic analysis of cylinder pressure is described. Variability of cylinder pressure harmonic analysis is investigated with respect to cycle-to-cycle, cylinder- to-cylinder, and test-to-test variations. Cycle-to-cycle variation was found to have the largest magnitude. Recommendations for averaging data are included. 800404. Noise of Diesel Engines Under Transient Con- ditions. H. E. Head and J. D. Wake, Lucas CAV Ltd., Acton. Diesel engines accelerating under full load conditions radiate more noise from their surfaces than when they are run at steady speed with the same fuelling. This is particularly marked in urban driving conditions as engines are accelerated after running for long periods at idling or at part load, when the inlet manifold and piston temper- atures are lower than they are at steady speed full load conditions. The work reported in this paper shows that the increase in noise originating from the combustion process is due to the lower temperature of the air charge. It is also shown how mechanical noise from piston slap increases under acceleration conditions. 1980 SA E Transactions 800405. High Frequency Vibration Transmission Through the Moving Parts of an Engine. R. G. DeJong and N. E. Parsons, Cambridge Collaborative, Inc., Cambridge, MA. A combustion model has been developed for a 4 cylinder, direct injection, naturally aspirated, diesel engine. The model is based on the vibration transmission character- istics of various components of the engine structure which relate internal forces to the vibration of the external, radiating surfaces. The model is constructed from meas- urements of the vibration characteristics of the individual engine components when disassembled. The assumption that this model is valid for the running engine is investigated particularly for the moving parts of the engine. The vibration transmission has been measured during the operation of the engine and compared to that predicted by the model. 1980 SA E Transactions 800406. Analysis Techniques of Combustion Noise and Vibrations in Diesel Engines. A. Alpini, M. Busso, G. Ruspa and G. Turino, Fiat Research Center S.p.A., Orbassano (Italy). One of the main problems experimenters are faced with in studying the diesel engine noise is the separation between the contributions of direct exciting forces, i.e. the combustion noise, and of indirect exciting forces, i.e. the so-called mechanical noise. In this paper an approach based on complementary techniques is presented, by which the combustion noise is investigated and separated from other vibrational phe- nomena in a running engine, analyzing the evolution of the time history as a function of engine speed and load, as well as the correlation between pressure cycles and noise. In fact a combination of techniques, such as near field intensity measurements, multiple and partial coherence methods, time-domain signal processing, can be success- fully applied in order to improve the required discrim- ination. 800407. Noise from Vibration. D. Anderton and N. A. Halliwell, I.S.V.R., Univ. of Southampton (England). The general problem of estimating the noise which vibrating surfaces will produce is discussed with particular application to diesel engines and their component parts. The measurement and prediction of engine noise balances using the surface vibration technique is described and the variation of engine block vibration with engine type and speed illustrated. Some measured radiation ratios for engine surfaces and components are given. Finally a method for measuring surface vibration on diesel engines using a laser doppler velocimeter is described. 800409. Diesel Engine Sound Reduction by Dynamic Structural Modeling. Michael E. Moncelle, Cat- erpillar Tractor Co. This paper presents a procedure for reducing diesel engine sound levels by combining analytical models and test data. Four elements previously analyzed individually; 1) structure modal characteristics, 2) forcing functions, 3) dynamic response, and 4) acoustical radiation were combined to accurately predict changes in diesel engine sound levels due to structural modifications. 800410. Regenerative Dynamometers Using D.C. Ma- chines. John A. Colwill, Hawker Siddeley Die- sels &amp; Electrics Inc. Developed in the general industrial field the d.c. machine with S.C.R. control is being increasingly applied to engine testing. The versatility of the system allows the use of a 74</page><page sequence="56">800411-800421 foot-mounted machine with shaft torque determination by on line calculation methods and variable effective inertia. Coupled with this, its ability to regenerate energy directly into the factory supply is used to recover the engine out-put in a directly usable form. 800411. A Data Acquisition and Processing System for Engine Tests. Ir. W. Verdonck, State Univ. of Gent, Machines and Machine Construction Lab. This paper describes the data acquisition and processing system of the Machines and Machine Construction Laboratory of the University of Gent. A system incor- porating a minicomputer has been found to give by far most possibilities. Its flexibility, modular design, sim- plicity in use and computing capacity are particularly appreciated. The installation is fixed in order to have a reliable system. Analog lines for the signals and digital lines for the operator's console connect the test rigs to the data logger. The calculation of the static pressure level from dynamic measurements is described as a possible application of the system. 1980 SA E Transactions 800412. A Dynamic Test Facility with Motoring Using a Digital Computer. Geoffrey J. Germane and Howard S. Heaton, Brigham Young Univ., Provo, UT. A computer controlled engine research and testing facility is described which has the capability to motor the engine via a unique hydraulic motoring system. The facility provides a highly reproducible and accurate response to arbitrary schedules of engine speed and dynamometer torque versus time. The development of a proportional plus integral plus derivative control scheme for direct digital control of speed and torque is presented in detail, along with a set of vehicle modeling equations which allows test cell simulation of road tests. A simple experimental driving cycle is described, and fuel flow results obtained from tests of alcohol/gasoline blends are compared to actual road and chassis dyna- mometer tests. The agreement of the various results supports the use of the facility with the simple driving cycle as an alternative to chassis dynamometer or road testing. 800414. Designing Magnesium Diecastings. Charles R. Peele, Atlantic Diecasting Industries. The purpose of this paper is to assist the designer of die castings in utilizing successful concepts early in the stages of the product design cycle. Included are guidelines for alloy selection, wall thickness, taper, draft and achieve- ment of greater part strength. Ideas are also presented on cast-in bearing possibilities, tooling substitution, locating ejector pins, gating, corrosion protection and finishes. This practical approach to the design of castings for magnesium includes examples of successes and areas of casting design and applications to avoid. 800415. Automotive Applications for Magnesium Die Castings. T. W. Caldwell and H. M. Ward, Doehler-Jarvis Castings Div., NL Industries, Inc. Component groups in domestic vehicle designs with significant weight savings potential through conversion to magnesium die castings are reviewed. The criteria for part selection and basic magnesium properties are discussed. Four component groups having a number of parts meeting this study's criteria were selected-bracketry, pumps and metering bodies, housings and transmission components. Examples of specific parts in each category are given, including estimates of cost savings or cost penalty per kilogram of weight saved. 800416. Magnesium Availability and Demand 1978 - 1984. Richard C. Gove, Dow Chemical U.S.A. The magnesium industry is in a growth trend thru the 1980s. The most accelerated growth will come from magnesium's use in steel desulfurization and in die casting. It is expected that the automotive industry will be a significant part of this growth. Production capabilities will rise to meet the increase in demand through productivity improvements and expan- sion of existing facilities. 800417. Magnesium for Automobiles, in Perspective. John G. Mezoff, American Magnesium Co., Tulsa, OK. As a common structural metal, magnesium is in its youth, coming into general use only after World War II. On the other hand, its serviceability as an automotive material was first proved in Germany during the 1930's. This paper traces the history of one of the oldest applications of a relatively new metal by reference to a number of historical events, or mileposts, which clear the way for its large scale use in automobiles. 1 980 SA E Transactions 800418. Magnesium, Machinability and Safety. H. Joseph Morales, Magnesium Division, N L Industries, Inc. For many years cast magnesium alloy components requiring extensive machining have found application in many industries. Unfortunately, those least familiar with magnesium continue to regard its machining as a highly dangerous undertaking. Consequently, magnesium in part because of "safety considerations" has been ruled out of a number of applications where it should have been the material of choice. This paper discusses the machining characteristics of magnesium and the safe handling and disposal of chips. 800421. Evaluating the Driving Potential of the Handi- capped Using a Simulator. Richard R. Thomp- son, Brian S. Repa and Philip M. Leucht, Engineering Mechanics Dept., General Motors 75</page><page sequence="57">800422-800426 Research Laboratories, Warren, MI. The GMR Driving Simulator was used to study the performance of four teen-aged, novice drivers, two of whom had cerebral palsy. The purpose of this pilot study was to determine the potential of the simulator to discriminate between the driving abilities of medically handicapped and non-handicapped individuals. The study concentrated on the psychomotor aspects of lane-keeping performance in the presence of road curvature and environmental disturbances. The study indicates that a dynamically realistic driving simulator could be a valuable screening device for identifying potential performance difficulties in handicapped individuals prior to behind- the-wheel instruction. 1980 SA E Transactions 800422. Cooperative Evaluation of Techniques for Meas- uring Diesel Exhaust Odor Using the Diesel Odor Analysis System (DOAS). R. J. Hames, Detroit Diesel Allison Div., GMC; R. J. Slone, Cum- mins Engine Co., J. M. Perez, Caterpillar Tractor Co.; and J. H. Johnson, Michigan Tech. Univ. The CRC-APRAC CAPI- 1-64 Odor Panel was formed in 1973 to assess an instrumental measurement system for diesel exhaust odor (DOAS) developed under CRC- APRAC CAPE-7-68 by Arthur D. Little, Inc. Four cooperative studies were conducted by nine participating laboratories using common samples. The objectives of these studies were to define the DOAS system variables and to validate and improve the sampling and collection procedures. A fifth study, serving as a review of each analysis step, showed that analysis of common derived odorant samples could be conducted within acceptable limits by the participating laboratories. Three in-house sampling system design and operating parameter studies were conducted simultaneously with the cooperative work. The combined findings from the in-house and cooperative studies led to a tentative recommended procedure for measuring diesel exhaust odor. During the course of these cooperative tests the variability of odor measurements improved from 0.6 TIA to 0.2 TIA units, well within the ability of the human nose to detect differences in Total Intensity of Aroma (TIA). 1980 SA E Transactions 800423. Diesel Exhaust Offensive Effect - True Odor or Irritancy? Paul Degobert, Institut Français du Pétrole, Rueil-Malmaison (France). Human nose sensory properties call out two different nervous systems: the true olfactory system transfers actual olfactory information and the trigeminal system transfers irritancy. Both present specific properties and play their part in the offensive effect felt by the population and measured by a conventional nose panel. By using a novel olfactometer sensitive only to true olfactory excitation and not to trigeminal excitation, it is possible to afford an explanation for the lack of correlation between nose panel data and DOAS data. The irritant aspect of Diesel exhaust fumes seems thus to play a leading part in the sensory offensiveness. 800424. Measurement of Diesel Exhaust Odorants and Effect of Engine Variabies. A. R. Reading, SGRD Ltd.; and G. Greeves, Lucas CAV Ltd. An analytical technique has been optimized for the measurement of the concentrations of diesel exhaust odorants. Application of this technique to combustion bomb studies shows that preflame reactions with diesel fuel produce high concentrations of odorants. The effects of engine variables on exhaust odorant concentrations are presented for direct and indirect injection engines. Analysis of these data shows that diesel exhaust odorants are produced from three sources: (a) the fuel-lean mixture produced during the ignition delay period, (b) fuel emptying from the nozzle sac volume of direct injection engines after injection, (c) a fuel-rich source which becomes significant at high load. The practical measures for control of odorants are outlined. 800425. Fuel Effects on Diesel Odor in a Spray Burner. F. T. Hsieh, N. P. Cernansky and C. W. Savery, Mechanical Engrg. and Mechanics Dept., Drexel Univ., Philadelphia, PA. A laboratory burner has been operated with paraffinic mixtures, aromatic mixtures, n-paraffins, cetane standard fuel mixtures, and diesel No. 2 to measure fuel effects upon the production of diesel odor. Of the variables studied which included aromatic content, volatility, cetane number and specific gravity, only aromatic content was found to have a significant effect upon measured odor intensity. Normal paraffinic fuels were found to produce comparable exhaust odor intensities as a function of stoichiometry, irrespective of wide variations in their properties. At lean stoichiometrics, branched paraffinic mixtures were found to produce low LCO and high LCA concentrations compared to n-parrafins. 800426. Retained Austenite and Its Measurement by X-Ray Diffraction. Chester F. Jatczak, The Timken Co., Canton, OH. This paper shows that retained austenite (R.A.) exists in many hardenable steels and that its presence can induce both positive and negative changes in various mechanical and engineering properties. The economic considerations of these changes are particularly important in such finished products as bearings, gears and tool steels. Discussed in the paper are the following aspects of the R.A. problem: (1) origin of R.A., (2) methods for its control, (3) quantity levels in various steels, and (4) various methods for its measurement. The x-ray diffrac- tion technique of R.A. measurement is shown to be a very accurate and fast tool for the quantification of R.A. in the 76</page><page sequence="58">800427-800433 microstructure of such products whether subjected to measurement after heat treatment, or after deformation processing and return from service. 1980 SAE Transactions 800427. Results of Interlaboratory Retained Austenite Measurements Utilizing X-Ray Diffraction. John A. Larson, Ingersoll-Rand Co., Phillipsburg, NJ. The data from a round-robin program, run by the X-ray Division of the SAE Fatigue Design and Evaluation Committee to evaluate x-ray techniques for measuring retained austenite, have been studied. This program involved the measurement by twenty-three companies of four specimens containing 0-40% retained austenite. The results show that laboratories using proper techniques can achieve an interlaboratory standard deviation of less than 4% retained austenite at the 40% level and less than 1.5% at the 5% level. 1980 SAE Transactions 800428. Application of a Tilting and Rotating Specimen Stage to X-Ray Retained Austenite Measurement in Textured and Coarse Grained Steels. S. W. Shin and V. K. Sharma, International Harvester Co., Hinsdale, IL. An x-ray diffraction technique involving the use of a tilting and rotating (TR) stage has been used to determine retained austenite (RA) in several isotropic as well as variously textured specimens. The results obtained using the TR stage have been compared with the RA values obtained on the same specimens using the conventional (stationary specimen stage) two or three peak x-ray diffraction techniques. The results indicate that the TR method yields accurate retained austenite values for both isotropic and textured specimens. The conventional method produces accurate results for isotropic specimens only and leads to serious errors when strong texture or coarse grain size is present in the specimen. 1980 SAE Transactions 800429. Residual Stress Measurements in Front of a Propagating Fatigue Crack. R. E. Ricklefs and W. P. Evans, Research Dept., Caterpillar Trac- tor Co. X-ray residual stress measurements were made near the fatigue crack tip in round-robin specimens by the X-Ray Fatigue Division of the SAE Fatigue Design and Evalu- ation Committee. Steel specimens, furnished by the Cumulative Fatigue Damage Division from their fatigue program, were of two strength levels and either constant- amplitude or program loaded. Results showed the need for more work in establishing the small beam x-ray technique. Residual stress patterns ahead of the crack correlated qualitatively with the Rice model, and higher compressive stresses in the higher strength material correlated with increased resistance to crack propagation in the fatigue program. Stresses measured across the crack also reinforced the Elber crack closure concept. 1980 SAE Transactions 800431. Boundary Integral Equation Method Simplifies Elastic Stress Analysis. Gordon H. Holze, Cat- erpillar Tractor Co. The boundary integral equation (BIE) method has emerged as a promising alternative to the finite element method because in many cases it may significantly reduce the generation and checkout time required to describe the geometry model. Structural analysis is simplified because only the surface of the component being analyzed needs to be defined. Advantages and limitations of the BIE method are discussed. Two example problems are modeled using both the finite element method and the BIE method. One problem is a planar analysis of a gear segment. The other is a three-dimensional analysis of a diesel engine piston. 800432. Optimization as a Tool for Automotive Design. K. M. Ragsdell, School of Mechanical Engrg., Purdue Univ., West Lafayette, IN. The automobile plays a very important role in the American way of life. The private passenger car has been for generations an expression of a basic American freedom called mobility. In our generation society as a whole, through the federal government, has imposed constraints on the expression of this mobility freedom. These constraints have been imposed in the form of regulations concerning safety, environment and energy. Accordingly, the modern automobile must then be designed to achieve competing objectives in the presence of severe constraints. Discussed here are modern optimization methods which can be useful in this design environment. Included in the discussion are the very powerful Generalized Reduced Gradient and Method of Multipliers algorithms. Mechanical component and system design examples are given which demonstrate the utility of the optimization approach. Particular attention is given to the engine as a major automotive component. For example, the selection of gear ratios, manifold pressures and shift points during acceleration for minimum fuel consumption is discussed. 800433. Analysis of Diesel Engine Bearings by the Finite Element Method. Pranab K. Das and Craig A. Barnes, John Deere Product Engrg. Center. The future growth in power density in diesel engines is greatly dependent upon successful design of the bearings. The traditional analytical methods cannot account for or grossly approximate many of the important features of an actual bearing operation. A new computer program has been developed which uses the finite element method for a more accurate analysis of bearing performance under actual conditions. The program can analyze the type and 77</page><page sequence="59">800436-800439 location of oil supply grooves, taper, misalignment, noncircularity of journals and bearings, and various crankshaft machining defects. The paper provides a broad overview of the computer program and sample results for a variety of practical bearing features. 1980 SA E Transactions 800436. The Performance of Fuel-Saving Engine Oils. J. R. Lohuis, J. A. Murphy and T. W. Rogers, Mobil Research and Development Corp. The fuel-saving capabilities of various experimental and commercial passenger car engine oils have been demon- strated in extensive studies. Lower viscosity oils and those containing friction-reducing additives have shown meas- urable fuel economy benefits in a wide range of laboratory and vehicle tests. Several test techniques are described for screening fuel-saving engine oils and components. Closely controlled chassis rolls and over-the-road vehicle tests are utilized to demonstrate the actual lubricant-related fuel economy benefits. Within the range of variables included in this study, reducing engine oil viscosity is the most effective way to improve fuel economy. Fuel savings realized from fric- tion-reducing additives are relatively modest and many of the more effective materials are shown to have poor performance in standard sequence tests, particularly regarding engine wear. The most appropriate fuel-saving engine oil should combine the benefits of low viscosity along with the use of a carefully selected and thoroughly tested friction-reducing additive. We strongly support industry efforts to standardize a test procedure for identifying fuel-saving engine oils. Based upon these studies and other investigations, the most suitable method for such a procedure are the EPA FTP and HWFET cycles. 800437. A Single-Cylinder High BMEP Engine for Eval- uating Lubricant Effects on Piston Deposits, Ring Wear, Oil Consumption, and Bore Polishing. James A. McGeehan, Chevron Research Co., Richmond, CA. The subject of this paper is a unique single-cylinder, direct injection lubricant test engine which matches current and future diesel engine design trends. The paper demon- strates that lubricant test results from this engine correlate with results from a highly turbocharged, six-cylinder engine when operating with both cutback and tight-fitting crown land pistons. An additional finding from this study was a correlation in both engines between ring weight loss and cylinder bore polishing when tight-fitting crown land pistons are used. 800438. Automotive Fuel Economy-Potential Improve- ment Through Selected Engine and Differential Gear Lubricants. T. M. Naman, Department of Energy, Bartlesville Energy Technology Center, Bartlesville, Oklahoma. An experimental program was conducted at the U.S. Department of Energy's Bartlesville (Okla.) Energy Technology Center to evaluate the effects of synthetic and special additive engine and differential gear lubricants on automotive fuel economy over the temperature range encountered in the United States. Using a climate-controlled chassis dynamometer facility on two 1978 vehicles, four engine lubricants were evaluated in the 1978 Federal test procedure and in steady-state operation from cold start at 20°, 70°, and 100° F ambients. In addition, three differential gear lubricants were evaluated in steady-state operation from cold start at 20°, 70°, and 100° F ambients using one 1978 vehicle equipped with torque and revolutions per minute measuring devices, which enabled the calculation of horsepower losses in the differential and the efficiency of the rear axle in addition to fuel economy. The results from the Federal test procedure and steady-state operation showed improvements in fuel economy with the synthetic and graphite-containing lubricants on the order of 1 to 6% when compared to a common base 10W40 lubricant. The order of magnitude varied with the ambient temperature and test vehicle. In steady-state operation, the fuel economy associated with the synthetic and friction-modified 75W gear oils in- creased at all ambients only during vehicle warm-up from cold start. Under fully warmed-up conditions there was little or no change in fuel economy. 800439. Passenger Car Noise Control Measures and Their Effects on Fuel Economy, Weight and Cost. D. Morrison and B. J. Challen, Ricardo Consulting Engineers; and T. Trella, U.S. Department of Transportation. Various passenger car practical noise control measures are presented and discussed. Emphasis is placed on the noise control trade-offs with fuel economy and weight. Both diesel and gasoline powered automobiles were considered. The diesel was of the indirect injection type and a conventional spark ignition engine constituted the gaso- line powered type. The baseline vehicle maintained throughout the analysis was a 2750 lb inertia weight passenger car (2400 lb, 1100 kg kerb weight). Major findings are summarised for five noise control measures considered to be most likely incorporated into future vehicles. They include: a) reduced engine speed by 10 percent, b) engine sizing and configuration, c) combustion process, d) engine structures, shielding and enclosures, and e) gas flow. Summaries for each noise control measure contain data on achievable noise reductions, and the corresponding change in fuel economy, vehicle weight and cost. Emission levels were referenced mainly to the 1979 Federal Light Duty Vehicle Emission Standards but some consideration was also given where relevant to the proposed 1981 Standards. The proposed particulate emission regulations were also considered. Noise meas- urements were referenced to a current high engine speed, 78</page><page sequence="60">800440-800446 full load drive-by test procedure (e.g. SAE J986b or similar European procedures, 70/157/EEC). 1980 SAE Transactions 800440. Development of an Exterior Sound Level Meas- urement Procedure for Light Motor Vehicles - SAE J986. Ralph K. Hillquist, General Motors Proving Ground. This paper presents the history of the development of SAE Standard J986, "Sound Level for Passenger Cars and Light Trucks," and its subsequent revisions. The major issues considered and the rationale for the compromises and decisions made in this development process are discussed. This standard has been a major factor in the measurement, and regulation, of light motor vehicle sound emissions since its first approval in 1967. 1980 SAE Transactions 800441. Engine Noise Reduction by Structural Study of Cylinder Block. Isao Nagayama, Yasushi Araki, Katsuyo Kakuta and You Usuba, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. (Yokohama/ Japan). A structural study of the cylinder block was made using a 4-cylinder, 1,800 cc gasoline engine with an aim toward reducing engine noise. First, we studied the relationship between cylinder block vibration and radiated noise, and also the principal component modes of noise and vibration. From the results obtained, it became clear that engine noise could be reduced by suppressing the basic natural vibration of the cylinder block. Then, alternative shapes of engine blocks were examined in an attempt to reduce noise with a minimal change in present production facilities and engine weight, using the finite element method. The trial cylinder block was built into an engine after examination by the impulse excitation method and holography. As the result of testing it in running condition, we were able to reduce the noise of the engine proper 2.5db*A with a weight increase of about 3 percent. 1980 SAE Transactions 800442. One-Side-Electrogalvanized Steel Sheet for Au- tomotive Applications. R. F. Higgs, M. E. Komp and E. J. Oles, Jr., Research Lab, United States Steel Corp., Monroeville, PA. The USS Carosel one-side-electrogalvanizing process is briefly described, and the properties of the product (USS GALVA-ONE) are presented.

Observations on Galvanic Corrosion Induced Paint Adhesion Loss. T. R. Roberts, J. Kolts and J. H. Steele, Jr., Research and Technology, Armco, Middletown, OH. The locus of failure occurring with corrosion induced paint adhesion loss on the steel surface of one side galvanized sheet has been investigated using the scanning electron microscope. Controlled laboratory experiments to simulate alkaline attack of phosphate crystals in the conversion coating and bulk alkyd primer saponification have been used to provide a basis for interpreting the features observed on salt spray test panels, and on the back side of paint stripped after adhesion loss. The controlling failure mechanism is shown to be attack along primer-steel interfaces. 1980 SAE Transactions 800444. The Role of Polymeric Complexes in Phospha- tizing Treatments. Max Kronstein, Chemistry Dept., Manhattan College, Riverdale, NY. The paper discusses the required mechanism in producing on automotive steel, on galvanized steel, and on joints between them, protective phosphate treatments based on a chemical interreaction of the phosphate carrying solution and an introduced metal-oxide, and with water dispersed organic polymer components acting as ligands in the reaction coating. Methods of the identification of such interreactions are explained, as well as the methods of analyzing the reaction product formations on the metal surfaces. 800445. Simultaneous Thickness and Electrochemical Potential Determination of Individual Layers in Multilayer Nickel Deposits Using the Chrysler "STEP" Test. Edward P. Harbulak, Chrysler Corp. The Chrysler "STEP" Test is used to simultaneously measure the thickness of the individual nickel layers in multilayer nickel deposits as well as the electrochemical potential difference between the nickel layers. This newly developed rapid test obviates the need for microscopic thickness measurements in many cases. More importantly, the electrochemical potential difference between nickel layers can be very easily measured. Since the potential difference is directly related to the corrosion resistance of the deposit, the efficacy of multilayer nickel deposits can be directly measured. Development of the test, typical results obtained on good as well as unsatisfactory deposits and implications with respect to improving corrosion resistance of plated parts are presented. 1980 SAE Transactions 800446.

This statistical study of V-belt fatigue testing, with sample sizes of over 5,000, yields a valuable insight into V-belt reliability. With this basic information, the design engi- neer can have a firm base for establishing a relationship between laboratory and field testing, and drive design calculations. The data can then be related to projected reliability on the actual application. It will also serve as a 79</page><page sequence="61">800447-800452 reference base for establishing practical quality control standards. 800447. Computer Simulation of U.S. Coast Guard Watchstander Performance. C. N. Abernethy, U.S. Department of Transportation, Transpor- tation Systems Center. Recently, the U.S. Coast Guard has established vessel traffic service (VTS) centers in four harbors. These centers are operated by watchstanders who provide an infor- mation gathering and dissemination service to mariners. As part of a program to explore ways of improving this service, computer models of watchstander interaction with equipment and communications with vessel and tug pilots were developed based on field observations and fre- quencies and durations of activities. The General Purpose Systems Simulator (GPSS) software package was chosen for programming and simulation of these stochastic models. These models were then constructed, pro- grammed, simulated and verified. This technique has applications in the study of operator workload and system performance under conditions of changes in equipment, procedures and personnel. 800448. Driving Simulation - Requirements, Mechani- zation and Application. R. Wade Allen and Henry R. Jex, Systems Technology, Inc., Haw- thorne, CA. This paper discusses recent developments and application of driving simulators. Simulation of driving via films has been used for a number of years as a driver education tool. More recently, interactive simulators have been developed for research and training applications. Im- provements are accelerating due to a combination of ongoing research needs, and general state of the art advances in hardware and software technology. Modern simulator requirements are reviewed from the point of view of both driver characteristics (vision, audition, proprioception, vestibular motion sensation) and task demands (e.g., steering and speed control, risk perception, decision making, general workload level). A variety of simulator applications are summarized, including comparison with subsequent field tests. These applications include studies involving drunk driving and risk taking, reduced visibility and delineation, and signing. Possible future simulator developments and application are also discussed based on current research needs and applications, and ongoing general developments in elec- tronics and computer hardware and software. 1980 SAE Transactions 800450. Effectiveness, Utilization, Costs and Considera- tions Pertaining to the Use of Simulators for Aircrew Training. Bertram W. Cream, Air Force Human Resources Lab, Advanced Systems Div., Wright- Patterson AFB, OH; and F. Thomas Eggemeier, Wright State Univ., Dayton, OH. This paper addresses an ongoing research program that describes and provides guidance on the effectiveness, costs, advantages and disadvantages of simulation train- ing for Air Force flying personnel. In the current climate of drastically reduced fuel availability, alternatives must be available to train aircrew members operational mission essential skills. Air Force use of simulation has increased over the past few years. Such a trend is expected to accelerate in the future. In the past, the majority of R&amp;D funding has gone towards development and improvements in simulation engineering technology. Consequently, there have been numerous improvements; however, less atten- tion has been directed towards the ways these improve- ments could be used by operational training personnel. As a result, the current data base is insufficient to allow making tradeoff decisions concerning training methods, effectiveness and costs. Such issues are addressed by this study and are reported here. Specific variables that affect the successful utilization of simulation devices are also discussed, as are plans for necessary follow-on research. 1980 SAE Transactions 800451. Advances in High-Performance Mechanical Fas- tening. R. J. Finkelston and P. W. Wallace, SPS Technologies, Inc. This paper discusses the advances in mechanical fastening made over the last decade. More detailed analyses of the bolted joint have led to a better understanding of the relationships between the working loads imposed on the bolted joint and the stresses felt by the bolt. The induced preload (tension) in the fastener is shown to be the critical factor involved in the static and dynamic reliability of the bolted assembly. The need for more accurate assembly methods to insure good control of fastener tension has resulted in the development of special electronic controls which are being used on the assembly line. Preload loss mechanisms which occur in service were studied, and new fastener locking methods are being evaluated by means of transverse vibration tests. The designer facing the chal- lenge of greater reliability and fuel efficiency has the recently developed fastening technology at his disposal. Using this technology, the designer avoids costly design fixes, product liability, weight penalties and thus can meet the needs of today's more stringent designs. 1980 SAE Transactions 800452.

Alternatives to cadmium plating on fasteners are inves- tigated from the point of view of cost, corrosion resis- tance, torque/tension relationships and vibration resis- tance. Conclusions show that these are inter-related and point to the direction to be taken dependant on the criteria of the fastened joint under consideration. 80</page><page sequence="62">800453-800458 800453. The Tapping Screw - A Look at Its Past, Present and Future. Richard L. Gruber and Casey W. Gordon, Jr., Parker-Kalon Div., USM Corp. As automotive body-building techniques changed from the use of wood to steel as a prime material, there developed a need for a quick, inexpensive and strong means of attaching sheet metal parts. The self-tapping screw met these needs. This SAE Landmark Paper traces the history of this vitally important fastening device from its roots as a wood screw to the highly sophisticated systems in use today and predicts its future. 800454. Improving the Physical Properties of 302 Stain- less Steel Tapping Screws. Lowell L. Bjorklund and David P. Wagner, Shakeproof Div., Illinois Tool Works, Inc., Elgin, IL. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a 302 stainless steel tapping screw which has improved strength and hardness and will meet the performance requirements found in SAE J933b, a qualifying test for case hardened carbon steel self-tapping screws. The new screw called a COREX GX tapping screw incorporates special process- ing techniques, along with a modified tapping point which makes possible its use in tapping carbon steel where conventional 300 stainless steel tapping screws have failed. 800455. Design Considerations for Aluminum Fasteners. W. J. Dewalt and R. E. Mack, Aluminum Company of America. Weight considerations and the need for corrosion resis- tance make aluminum fasteners attractive for new au- tomotive design. This paper reviews design considerations in using aluminum fasteners. Newly developed high- strength fastener alloys complemented by lightweight and the well known attributes of aluminum give the designer wide latitude in using aluminum for standard and special purpose fasteners. 1980 SAE Transactions 800456. The Volkswagen Lean Burn PC-Engine Concept. Walter Brandstetter, Volkswagen Research and Development. Results from the 16oo cm3 PCI- (Pre-Chamber Injection) Stratified Charge Engine with a divided combustion chamber and fuel injection into the prechamber were described in SAE Paper 75o 869. The main objective of continued development on this engine was to meet future emission and fuel economy standards for European countries with a simpler concept than required in the US, but equally effective. This work lead to the lean burn PC- (Pre Chamber) engine, where the prechamber fuel injec- tion system is omitted. The main part of the program was concerned with the optimization of the PC- Combustion Process; however, the effects of the engine periphery were also considered in detail. A large number of combustion chamber parameters were thoroughly investigated on a 13oo cm3 four-cylinder water-cooled inline engine. Ignition system parameters were included in the test program because they can significantly influence the combustion process. Since an engine concept had to be developed, a large part of the experimental work dealt with fuel-air-mixture formation, distribution and heating. A simple means of exhaust gas after-treatment was also considered in the concept. Exhaust emissions and fuel consumption were eval- uated in a number of vehicle tests according to European test procedures. Results show that future European exhaust emission standards, if not too severe, are likely to be met without catalytic after-treatment. No significant problems have been encountered thus far; however, more durability testing needs to be done. 1980 SAE Transactions 800457. Heat Transfer in the Cylinder of a Motored Reciprocating Engine. W. J. D. Annand and D. Pinfold, Univ. of Manchester (England). Experimental observations are presented of instantaneous local heat flux at one position on the cylinder head of a motored reciprocating engine. A range of compression ratio, speed, and inlet conditions were covered. The observations clearly show the phase shift between heat flux and driving temperature difference caused by bound- ary layer work effects. Correlation is briefly discussed. 800458. Temperature Gradients in Spark Ignition Engine Combustion Chambers. E. H. James, Mechanical Engineering Dept., Loughborough Univ. of Technology (England). A computer model has been developed to simulate the combustion process in a Renault IFP spark ignition research engine. The model enables the gradients in temperature and composition in the burnt gases behind the flame front to be predicted in a more accurate manner than has henceforth been possible. This is due to the incorporation into the model of heat exchanges due to mixing between adjacent zones in the burnt gases. The temperature gradients in the burnt gases are reduced quite markedly as the turbulent eddy diffusivity, c, of the flow in the combustion chamber is increased. The NO gradients are not so significantly affected. The ability of the model to predict accurate values of burnt gas temperature behind the flame front is verified from the correlations noted between predicted and spectroscopically measured burnt gas temperatures at certain locations in the combustion chamber. Good agreement is also obtained between the predicted and measured NO levels in the engine exhaust. The errors involved in NO prediction by using a "homogeneous" or a "non-mixing" model in place of the more accurate "mixing" model are investigated. Comparisons are also made between these models with regard to combustion time intervals and pressure development. 81</page><page sequence="63">800459-800463 800459. Cyclic Dispersion - Some Quantitative Cause- and-Effect Relationships. Michael B. Young, Engine Research Dept., General Motors Re- search Labs. Comprehensive single-cylinder engine data for three combustion chambers were analyzed statistically in order to quantify the effects of engine operating conditions and chamber geometric variables on combustion character- istics, and of combustion on engine performance stability. Operating condition variables of interest were air-fuel ratio, residual fraction (internal plus external EGR), spark timing, engine speed, and fueling level (trapped fuel per cycle). Geometric parameters of importance were cham- ber "openness" and squish. Combustion and engine performance stability were found to be related such that engine stability was improved when combustion variations were reduced, as would be expected, and/or when the combustion event was shortened. The combustion, in turn, was affected by both the engine operating conditions and chamber geometric characteristics. The chemical factors - air-fuel ratio and residual fraction - affected both the length and variability of combustion (on a crank angle basis). The physical factors - chamber geometry, spark timing, engine speed, and fueling level ~ affected primarily the length of the combustion event and secondarily the steadiness of combustion. Currently, the most practical approach for improving engine stability appears to be shortening of the overall combustion event. Adjustments of physical fac- tors, particularly chamber openness and turbulence- generating features, provide a good opportunity for achieving this reduction. 800461. NiO Incorporation in Three Way Catalyst Sys- tems. B. J. Cooper and L. Keck, Matthey Bishop, Inc., Wayne, PA. The role of NiO in three way catalyst systems is explored with respect to transient oxygen storage and water gas shift activity observed in lean-rich-lean exhaust compo- sition changes. Oxygen storage behavior is observed to play a role in fresh catalyst systems but disappears on aging. However, storage phenomena are still observed in the presence of water and can be explained in terms of water gas shift activity. Nickel containing catalysts in which the nickel is highly dispersed readily form a surface nickel aluminate complex which minimizes oxygen storage and water gas shift capability. A proprietary catalyst which contains stable nickel oxide is capable of maintain- ing higher activity under transient operation after hydro- thermal aging. 800462. Three- Way Conversion Catalysts: Effect of Closed-Loop Feed-Back Control and Other Pa- rameters on Catalyst Efficiency. C. D. Falk and J. J. Mooney, Engelhard Industries Division, Engelhard Minerals &amp; Chemicals Corporation, Menlo Park, N.J. Monolithic three-way conversion (TWC) catalysts, at different precious metal concentrations, were aged on an engine dynamometer with fuel doped with lead (0.012 g Pb/gal). These catalysts were subsequently evaluated on an engine dynamometer to examine the effects of air/fuel ratio set point, temperature, and air/fuel ratio amplitude and frequency on the conversion efficiencies for NOx, CO and HC. In all evaluations, as the precious metal concentration increased from 5 g/ft3 to 40 g/ft3, the NOx, CO and HC conversions increased. Also, the smallest effect of precious metal loading on catalyst efficiency was found at the smallest air/fuel amplitude ( ± 0.3 A/F). The highest overall conversions of NOx, CO and HC were obtained at the stoichiometric control point for pertur- bations of ± 0.3 A/F amplitude. Therefore, it appears that a considerable savings in precious metals can be realized if the A/F amplitude of a closed-loop feed-back control system is small ( ± 0.3 A/F). On the other hand, the higher the oscillation frequency of the feed-back control system, the higher the NOx, CO and HC conversions. Thus, an additional savings in precious metals may be achieved if the control frequency is increased. Since the A/F perturbation amplitude and frequency, catalyst temper- ature range, A/F control point, and catalyst precious metal concentration all combine to affect the NOx, CO and HC conversion efficiency, the selection of the precious metal loading of the TWC catalyst, the catalyst strategy (single or dual-bed system), and the A/F set point largely depend on the characteristics of the feed-back control system and the concentration of NOx, CO and HC emissions from the engine. 1980 SA E Transactions 800463. Dynamic Measurement of Carbon Monoxide Concentrations in Automotive Exhaust Using Infrared Diode Laser Spectroscopy. Jeffrey A. Sell, Richard K. Herz and David R. Monroe, General Motors Research Labs., Warren, MI. Infrared diode laser spectroscopy was used to make the first measurements of carbon monoxide (CO) concen- trations in automotive exhaust with a time response fast enough to be useful in the analysis of engine and emission control system dynamics. Currently used measurement techniques are too slow to follow rapidly changing CO levels. Infrared diode laser spectroscopy can selectively measure CO in the presence of large amounts of water vapor, permitting the direct analysis of the full exhaust flow. Carbon monoxide concentrations were measured before and after a three-way catalytic converter. The response time of the laser system (for a change in amplitude of 10%-90% of fullscale) was 25 ms, more than adequate to resolve all CO transients of interest. The instrument was capable of resolving concentration changes on the order of 0.1 vol % before the catalyst and 0.02 vol % after it. A minicomputer was used to simultaneously collect data on CO concentrations before and after the catalyst, and also the output of an oxygen 82</page><page sequence="64">800464-800472 sensor located in the exhaust line. These signals were recorded under various engine operating conditions: 1) constant A/F, 2) step changes in A/F (rich to lean and lean to rich), and 3) oscillation of the A/F at frequencies on the order of 1 Hz. 1980 SA E Transactions 800464. Surface Treatment for Low Density and Porous SMC. H. Verne Austin, Inmont Corp. We have taken the interface phenomenon developed with the use of an acrylic mist-coat identified by Dr. G. Dale Cheevers, General Motors Research Staff, a step further by developing a readily-processible sealer system for standard and low-density SMC. In this development, the standard practice required in a molder's paint operations was observed, and results were both predictable and repeatable. 800466. Meeting Class A Finish Requirements on Plastic Substrates. Thomas Hayden, Michael Jackson and Joseph Koreck, Bee Chemical Co. More plastics than ever before, including thermosetting and thermoplastic, are being utilized for exterior body automotive applications requiring Class A finishes. The subject of meeting Class A finishes is becoming more important as materials such as SMC, BMC, and RIM are more widely used. The scope of the material presented is to discuss some basic requirements necessary to obtain a Class A finish and solutions to common production problems encoun- tered on the finishing line. 800467. Present Status and Future Development of Gasoline Fuel Injection Systems for Passenger Cars. Otto Glöckler, Heinrich Knapp and Hansjörg Manger, Robert Bosch GmbH (West Germany). After a review on history, market, physical facts of fuel injection follows a short description of present systems. Influences on fuel consumption and emissions, in- cluding Lambda-control, are described. Some notes are given on the influence of injection timing, single point injection, combination of fuel injection and ignition to a digital motor electronics. New development trends for less expensive and more effective systems are shown. 800468. Hot Wire Air Mass Meter - A New Air Flow Meter for Gasoline Fuel Injection Systems. Rudolf Sauer, Robert Bosch GmbH, Automo- tive Products Div. 5 (Stuttgart/West Germany). This type of air flow meter was selected out of a large number of potential candidates for having the most promising overall capability. It enables true mass flow measurement. Also, transients and air velocity pulsations can be correctly handled. The most serious draw-back of the hot wire has always been that it is prone to dirt build-up. However, experience accumulated so far shows that this problem can be avoided by short burn-off intervals triggered a few seconds after the ignition is turned off. The present development has reached a state where the wire can survive a sufficient number of burn-off cycles without changing its properties. 800469. A New Engine Air Mass Flow Meter. H. Klinger, Electronics Dept., Linseis GmbH. With electronic fuel injection systems accurate control of air to fuel ratio primarily requires knowledge of the quantity of air mass taken into the engine. Above all it is the unfavorable automotive engine environment which renders the few known transducer capable of measuring this quantity little attractive. This paper describes a new mass air flow meter which besides being perfectly insensitive to that environment meets all other important requirements. 800470. An Approach to a Standard Engine Management System for 1983 and Beyond. Roy Matney, James Nuckols and Martin Wand, Texas In- struments Inc. This paper discusses a standard engine management system built around an extension of an existing 16 bit microprocessor architecture. The development program requirements are considered for both hardware and software through vehicle test. Both digital and analog inputs and outputs are categorized by type. These categories are then used to describe system input and output design for their service. Finally, future computational requirements are treated along with the architecture necessary for their solution. The approach described in this paper is based upon the concept that future automotive control requirements can be solved by only slight modifications to a standard control philosophy. 800471. Next Generation MOS LSI From a Historical Perspective. Jerry Liebler, Mostek Corp. Fabrication and testing of complex MOS large scale integrated circuitry is changing as the semiconductor industry positions itself for the next generation. Mostek's discussion will highlight some of the advances in tech- nology, production methods, and equipment necessary to the challenges of manufacturing MOS circuits of com- plexities similar to the 64K RAM. The timing and leadtimes necessary for this technology will be illustrated by historical example. The example will be Mostek's 3870 which in 1977 was the state of the art. This discussion will center around an automotive application now in produc- tion and mention the various revisions and their timing and impact on manufacturability of the MK3870. 800472. The Advantages and Limitations of Linear- Compatible Integrated Injection Logic for Au- tomotive Electronics. N. D. McClure and W. A. 83</page><page sequence="65">800474-800481 Vincent, Delco Electronics Div., General Motors Corp., Kokomo, IN. The performance and cost advantages of custom inte- grated circuits for automotive electronics have been established. The most effective design technique for a particular application may encompass both linear and digital custom ICs. A bipolar design technique that is used to advantage in combining both linear and digital functions on the same chip is called linear-compatible Integrated Injection Logic (I2L). This paper describes several automotive applications for linear-compatible I2L custom ICs. Advantages and benefits, as well as limi- tations, are discussed and illustrated with actual chip development efforts. The paper concludes with a discus- sion of advanced development programs utilizing this technique to enhance future product design. 1980 SA E Transactions 800474. An Introduction to Custom Design of Integrated Circuits for Automobiles. E. C. Crossley, RCA Solid State Div., Somerville, NJ. This paper is directed to those engineers who sense a need for custom integrated circuits, but who are not familiar with the options available to them. Custom integrated circuits are invariably unique to a particular customer. In automotive applications they are seen as interface units between microprocessors and controlled systems, also as independent functional elements. They are used for reasons of economy, reliability and security. The CMOS (Complementary Symmetry Metal Oxide Semiconductor) technology has a number of virtues that make it especially suitable to the automotive environment. A technique exists for rapidly converting conventional logic diagrams into computer-designed custom CMOS integrated circuits. The technique is described. 800475. The Continuing Microcomputer Evolution. William D. Huston, Jr., Motorola, Inc., Austin, TX. Semiconductor, ROM-based microcomputers have one of two heritages - calculators or microprocessors. Similar paths were followed in the evolution of the automobile. The Model-T Ford and mid-range autos like the Buick, led to the consolidated automobile designs of the 1930's. By 1930 the basic inventions were past, and numerous refinements were in the future. The evolution of ROM-based microcomputers have reached the same point in 1980. The coming era will take advantage of features that are available now. The Motorola M6805 Family is typical of a modern program architecture with flexible system configurations. Among the program benefits are multilevel subroutines, look-up tables, interrupts, timers, flexible addressing modes and multifunction instructions. The systems configurer gets a variety of ROM and RAM sizes, various I/O features, plus a choice of HMOS or CMOS technologies. 800476. A Microcomputer-Based Automotive Comfort Control System. Karl O. Learner, II, Delco Electronics Div., GMC. A microcomputer has been added to the Panel Control portion of an automotive heating and air conditioning control system. All Panel Control tasks are done by the microcomputer including multiplexing of LED displays, interpretation of the keyboard, reception of information from the engine control system and command of the Programer portion of the system. The flexibility of the microcomputer has proven useful in meeting changing customer requirements. This paper describes the appli- cation of the microcomputer to this new automotive product. 800479. Laboratory Studies of Low-Chromium and Chro- mium-Free Steels for Suspension Coil Springs. S. T. Furr, Bethlehem Steel Corp., Bethlehem, PA. AISI 5160 and modified 5160, the most commonly used steels for automotive suspension coil springs, contain chromium. In the event this metal becomes hard to get, our industries should have the information basis for introducing spring steels with less or no chromium. This paper reviews existing spring-steel grades and summarizes a laboratory study aimed at finding new alloys with an optimum combination of properties. New alloy ap- proaches that are potentially competitive with 5160 and modified 5160 during normal times are identified as well as substitutes that could be used during an emergency. 1980 SA E Transactions 800480. Steels for Automotive Coil Springs With Im- proved Resistance to Relaxation. H. J. Tata and E. R. Driscoll, U.S. Steel Corp.; and J. J. Kary, General Motors Corp., Chevrolet Motor Div.- Livonia. Electron microscopy studies showed that automobile coil springs made of 9260 steel have greater resistance to relaxation than coil springs made of 5160 and 15B62 steels, because the carbides in the 9260 steel are smaller and more closely spaced than the carbides in the other two steels. Further research work established that steels containing nominally 1.0 and 1.25 percent silicon have satisfactory resistance to relaxation. Because of its good resistance to relaxation, and because of its hardenability and cost effectiveness, a 0.60C-0.90Mn-1.0Si steel contain- ing 0.45 to 0.65 percent chromium has been used for coil springs in several models of General Motors cars since 1977. 1980 SA E Transactions 800481. Titanium Coil Springs for Automotive Suspension Systems. A. M. Sherman, Metallurgy Dept., Ford Motor Co., Dearborn, MI. Titanium is a strong, lightweight metal which is used extensively in aerospace applications. By virtue of these 84</page><page sequence="66">800482-800488 properties plus low elastic moduli it is particularly suitable as a spring material. Compared to steel springs of equivalent performance, titanium springs weigh less than half as much and can be designed to be more compact. The current need to reduce vehicle weight to improve fuel economy has led to a prototype development program to assess the weight saving potential of suspension springs. Front suspension springs made of ß- titanium alloy were designed, fabricated and tested. The results indicate that such springs could serve as direct replacements for steel springs with a weight saving of 53%, while satisfying fatigue life, spring rate and design load requirements. Suggestions for improvements in the processing of the spring wire and fabrication have been identified which could result in even greater weight saving and lower cost. While these results demonstrate attractive advantages offered by Titanium springs, vehicle durability tests and manufacturing feasibility studies are needed to more fully assess their costs and benefits. 1980 SA E Transactions 800482. Some ABC's of Air Spring Suspensions for Commercial Road Vehicles. T. A. Bank, Fire- stone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. This paper is intended to review what air suspensions should accomplish and how closer attention to principles and ideas presented here can result in greater user satisfaction. Some new and potentially helpful ideas are also presented which may set trends for future designs. 800483. Design and Validation of Variable Rate Pneu- matic Springs. Thomas E. Burkley and Philip F. Myers, Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. This paper provides information on theory and design methods used to tailor pneumatic spring rate and natural frequency. Equations utilized in the design procedure are presented, and the interaction of the important variables is discussed. The vital role of laboratory testing and validation is emphasized. Although the paper is restricted to pneumatic spring design, peripheral equipment such as leveling valves and auxiliary reservoirs are addressed. 800484. Can Composite Materials Compete in Vehicle Torsion Members? K. R. Berg, Riggs Engrg. Corp.; and J. Plumer, Amy Materials and Mechanics Research Center. Automotive components made from advanced composite materials result in significant weight savings over steel and aluminum. However, already a few components have been developed in composite materials which have been unsuccessful in meeting the requirements. Not all com- ponents can successfully be designed from advanced composite materials. One of the problem areas is the application involving torsion members. Specifically those applications where torsional shear strength, shear fatigue, or shear strain are limiting factors. In automotive components this includes torsion bars, coil springs, and the shorter drive shafts. In this paper the strain limitations of advanced composites are compared to other materials and this effect demonstrated in the design of a torsion bar. A parametric analysis will be shown which will directly indicate when, for a particular application, advanced composite materials can or cannot be utilized. 1980 SA E Transactions 800486. Influence of Aluminum Casting Alloy Metallur- gical Factors on Machinability. J. L. Jorstad, Reynolds Metals Co. Machinability of popular automotive casting alloys is determined by (1) alloy chemistry, microstructure and properties, (2) the casting method employed, (3) various treatments that alter the microstructure, cleanliness or strength of the alloy, and (4) metallic and non-metallic impurities. Silicon and other hard phases act as abrasives in a relatively soft alloy matrix and tend to reduce cutting tool life. Copper and magnesium increase alloy hardness, improve machined surface finish and decrease the ten- dency of an alloy to build up on a cutting tool edge. Sand castings require more machining stock and have a coarser microstructure than either permanent mold castings or die castings and therefore are more costly to machine. Die castings are the least costly to machine. Treatments to refine primary silicon or modify the eutectic silicon morphology substantially improve tool life. Heat treat- ment, to increase hardness, reduces built-up-edge on the cutting tool and improves the surface finish of the machined part. 1980 SA E Transactions 800487. An Experimental Approach to Machinability Testing. John C. Miller, Reynolds Metals Co.; and Richard E. De Vor, Univ. of Illinois. This paper presents the results of statistically designed machinability tests for single point turning of aluminum casting alloys using several different cutting tool mate- rials. A methodology is presented which is aimed at providing machinability data for both performance comparisons over a wide range of machining conditions and individual process modeling and optimization. A new type of graphical summary is used to display machining performance in terms of wear rate, tool life, surface roughness and surface integrity to enable the process planner to analyze the trade-offs in cutting condition selection. Performance predictions for several tools and materials are presented and discussed. 800488. Broaching of Aluminum Automotive Engine Com- ponents. Myron J. Schmenk, Cincinnati Mila- cron Inc. This paper presents evidence that aluminum automotive engine components such as cylinder heads and crankcases can be broached on the same type of large horizontal 85</page><page sequence="67">800489-800496 broaches that have been traditionally used to broach cast iron engine components. The evidence presented consists primarily of results from extensive single tooth cutting tests. Recommendations are made regarding the proper tool material, tool geometry, cutting fluid, and tool layout for the successful broaching of typical hard and soft automotive aluminum alloys. 800489. Machining the Silicon-Containing Aluminum Alloys. R. O. Burant and T. J. Skingle, Acme- Cleveland Development Co., Acme-Cleveland Corp. Aluminum alloys containing medium and high silicon contents were effectively machined with the same styles of cutting tool. AA 380 aluminum, containing 8% silicon, represented the medium silicon-containing alloy; and A A 390, containing 16% silicon, represented the high silicon- containing alloy. Either non-coolant feeding high-speed steel drills or tungsten carbide tipped coolant feeding drills effectively machined both alloys. It was necessary to maintain high penetration rates in machining the high silicon material. The medium silicon material was insensitive to penetra- tion rates. Adequate coolant flow and application were also necessary for effective machining of both alloys. Proper choice of tool style and cutting conditions will allow for cost effective machining of the medium and high silicon-containing aluminum alloys. 800490. Aluminum Machining - A Practical Approach. Dan Stashko, Valeron Corp. This presentation will discuss the machinability charac- teristics of aluminum, with emphasis on the common problems. The role and importance of geometry selection relative to prevalent problems is explained. Contents also include: overcoming build-up, reducing breakout, part deflection, tool pressures, finish deteriorations, high silicon aluminum (390) and polycrystalline diamonds. 800492. Aluminum Intake Manifolds Produced by High Pressure Sand Molding. E. S. Kratzet, Cast Metal Industries, Inc. High pressure sand molding offers one of the best ways to produce automotive intake manifolds in various alu- minum alloys. 800493. Noise Abatement of Sliding Chutes for Metal Stamping Production. M. Loo and E. Ri vin, Ford Motor Co. Identification of the noise generating mechanisms of gravity action and vibrator stimulated sliding chutes has resulted in the development of practical and effective noise abatement treatments for both. In the case of gravity action chutes the application of foam-backed thin and narrow spring steel plates on the chute surface achieves the desired effect with noise reduction of 14 to 25 dB(A). With vibrator stimulated chutes progressive steps were taken to attenuate source noise, chute radiation noise and the non-productive component of the force vector from the vibrator, resulting in noise reduction of 25 to 30 dB(A). 1 980 SA E Transactions 800494. Noise Abatement of In-Plant Trailers. B. Huang and E. Rivin, Ford Motor Co. In-plant trailers constitute a large portion of material handling system in manufacturing plants of the auto- motive industry. The trailers are among the most intensive noise sources, with radiated noise reaching 1 10 dB A (Leq). High dynamic loads are also generated on the floor and in the trailer structure. These dynamic loads lead to maintenance problems and inflated inventory of the trailers. Principal mechanisms responsible for generating noise and dynamic loads are identified and treatments to reduce noise and dynamic loads have been developed and investigated on standard trailers. Test results show: for an empty trailer, application of the proposed nonlinear suspension reduces noise 16-18 dB A (Leq) and dynamic load 10 times; for a trailer with an empty rack, application of the proposed nonlinear rack cushion leads to 3-5 dBA (Leq) noise reduction in addition to 8-10 dBA (Leq) reduction due to the suspension. The suspension allows the use of plain steel wheels instead of expensive and nondurable polyurethane treaded wheels, and results in large projected savings in maintenance and reduced inventory of the trailers. 1980 SA E Transactions 800495. Metal Stamping Presses Noise Investigation and Abatement. E. Rivin and S. Shmuter, Ford Motor Co. Noise generating mechanisms connected with steel- blanking operation have been identified and their engi- neering treatments developed and tested. Use of rubber- metal laminates proved to be successful for cushioning impacts in kinematic pairs and joints. Use of plastic for the stripper plate construction was recommended. The "die stiffener" concept was developed to reduce main noise peak associated with punch breakthrough. Screening of the die cavity by a transparent curtain of overlapping PVC strips was shown to be effective. A pulse load simulator with adjustable load rate and amplitude has been developed to facilitate testing of presses. 800496. Noise Abatement of Vibratory Feeders. E. Rivin, Ford Motor Co. Three principal noise-generating mechanisms were iden- tified in the vibratory feeder as structural vibrations, interaction between the conveyed parts and the track surface and radiation from the bowl cavity. Treatment of the track surface based on theoretical analysis of the vibration-stimulated conveyance, structural damping treatment of the bowl and "see through, load through, 86</page><page sequence="68">800501-800509 reach through" acoustical scréen have been developed. These treatments lead to 20-25 dBA reduction of the sound pressure level accompanied by substantial reduc- tion of part delivery time. 800501. Mack's 350 HP 2234 Pound Fuel Economy Engine. B. J. Mehallick and S. B. Pifer, Mack Trucks, Inc. The maximum power output of the Mack 4 cycle 672 in3 six cylinder engine has been increased from 224 HP in 1967, to 285 HP in 1973, and now to 350 HP. The 350 HP version model ETSZ677 was made possible by the development of an advanced charge air cooling system which improved engine combustion efficiency while effectively controlling emissions and maximum engine thermal loads. A long service life is assured, since the higher rating was achieved while still adhering to proven Mack engine design parameters. All power ratings in this paper are corrected to the SAE J8 16b standard. The 1967 224 HP engine is known in the field as a 237 HP engine because it was originally rated according to an earlier standard using 60° F air and 29.92 inches Hg barometer. 800502. Piezomotors - Electromechanical Muscle. C. G. O'Neill, D. S. Randall and P. C. Smiley, Physics International Co., San Leandro, CA. Piezomotors are a form of electromechanical interface device that have unique properties with regard to response capability and proportionate control. They employ ferro- electric materials that undergo a lattice distortion when subjected to an electric field. This paper gives a brief review of material properties desirable for this type of high-strain actuator and explains why these properties are important. It describes a material developed by the author's company and shows the extent to which this material satisfies requirements. The significant factors in coupling energy from a Piezomotor are examined, and methods for addressing them are described. Current state of the art is quantified in a design guide diagram that permits the performance of any size of Piezomotor to be predicted under various electric field energizations. A selection of applications in automotive fuel systems, pumps, valves, industrial hydraulics, and optical systems is presented. The performance advantages and operating requirements of such systems are described. Reference is made to future extensions of perform- ance. It is shown that there is a potential for energy densities up to twelve times those currently achieved. 1980 SAE Transactions 800504. Fiber Optic/Power Switch System for Multi- plexed Automotive and Aircraft Wiring. Joe D. Mings, Gerald R. Samsen and Rosemary Smith, Texas Instruments Inc., Dallas, TX. High-power microelectric switching circuits are interfaced with a fiber optic data link, whereby both topside and groundside inductive and resistive loads up to 20 amperes are switched. 1980 SAE Transactions 800506. Aerodynamic Computation of Air Fuel Ratios. W. A. Fiedler, Consultant, Los Altos Hills, CA. The rate of fuel flow for maintaining a constant AF ratio is derived from the turn angle of a spring-restrained air-screw type rotor placed in the engine air flow. Operationally required A/F changes are imprinted on the flow with vortices generated with small vanes, individually deflected in relation to engine load or -temperature variations. Air velocity and vorticity contain the data for A/F control which are integrated with the multi-bladed rotor. Vane vortex theory and air flow test approaches and results are presented, a prototype control device defined and analysed, alternate versions shown and factors affecting engine compatibility discussed. 800507. Research and Development of the Carburetor for the CVCC Engine. Tasuku Date and Toshio Nomura, Honda Research California. The CVCC engine requires a small amount of rich mixture for the auxiliary combustion chamber and a greater amount of lean mixture proportioned to the load for the main combustion chamber, with the overall air-fuel ratio which has to be properly controlled. In order to fulfill the above requirements, the carburetor has to provide both the main and auxiliary fuel system independently and connect their throttle valve shafts with each other by a link mechanism. Besides this, the carburetor is confronted by the problems that are introduced by the leaner mixture, i.e., idle stability, surging, transient performance, cornering problems, and starting performance. It is also required to be equipped with exhaust emission control devices so as to meet stringent official regulations. It is not too much to say, indeed, that the development of the carburetor was the key to the success of the CVCC engine. 1980 SAE Transactions 800508. A General Model for Solenoid Fuel Injector Dynamics. David H. Smith and David A. Spinweber, Ford Motor Co. The solenoid fuel injector's dynamic behavior has been modelled by digital simulation techniques. The results help to explain the injector's non-linear flow calibration at short control pulse widths. This behavior is reproduced in an experimental comparison, and recommendations are made for reducing these calibration non-linearities based on model predictions. 800509. The New CAV Microjector Injector. Peter Howes, Lucas CAV Ltd. 87</page><page sequence="69">800510-800514 This paper outlines the history and development of a new small injector which is especially suitable for passenger car diesel engines. Engine Performance, Durability, Field Test and Emissions are covered in the paper. The main features of this new injector are as follows: 1) A small screw-in injector having a 14 mm sparking plug thread 2) Gives quieter running than pintle or hole type nozzles 3) Gives emissions comparable with pintle nozzles 4) Gives lower fuel consumption than pintle or hole type nozzles over most of the operating range. 5) No back leakage pipes required 6) No heat shield required It has been exhaustively tested in a number of engines and vehicles, and is now in volume production. 800510. Time-Resolved Measurement of Vehicle Sulfate and Methane Emissions with Tunable Diode Lasers. John C. Hill and Richard F. Majkowski, General Motors Research Laboratories. A new analytical method, absorption of tunable diode laser radiation, can detect small concentrations of gases with fast response. This technique has been applied to the detection of vehicle sulfate emissions in the form of sulfuric acid (H2S04) vapor. Previously available methods for sulfate analysis required collecting samples for 10 min. or more. Our laser system has a response time of 2.4 s. This allowed tracking the sulfate emissions of a vehicle during a Highway Fuel Economy Test. The data suggests that catalyst temperature is the major parameter con- trolling sulfate emissions and that storage and release of sulfur occurs at low and high catalyst temperatures, respectively. The same method detected methane during both the Highway Fuel Economy Test and the Federal Test Procedure. It identified the conditions, and corresponding concentrations, for high methane emissions. A qualitative comparison with total hydrocarbon emissions uncovered significant differences during accelerations. 1980 SA E Transactions 800511. Exhaust Emissions from Malfunctioning Three- Way Catalyst-Equipped Automobiles. Charles M. Urban, Southwest Research Inst.; and Robert J. Garbe, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. This paper summarizes two laboratory efforts to chacac- terize exhaust emissions from three-way catalyst-equipped gasoline automobiles operating under malfunction con- ditions. Four automobiles were evaluated over three test cycles in an unmodified configuration and in four engines and/or emission control system malfunction configura- tions. Exhaust emission constituents measured, in addition to the currently regulated automobile emissions, include: particulates, sulfates, aldehydes, sulfides, amines, metals, and several additional elements and compounds. 800512. Emissions At Off-Ambient Temperatures. W. F. Marshall and B. H. Eccleston, Department of Energy, Bartlesville Energy Technology Center, Bartlesville, Oklahoma. Data on exhaust emissions were obtained from a group of 1970 model-year vehicles operating over a range of ambient temperatures. The work is providing a baseline against which current-production vehicles can be com- pared, thus enabling a more complete assessment of automotive emissions reduction achievements. The vehicle fleet represented the 1970 model-year nationwide mix. The 25 cars were tested at 25°, 50°, 75°, and 100° F over the Environmental Protection Agency urban Federal test procedure, highway fuel economy test, and New York City driving cycles. Both temperature and driving cycle were found to have significant effects on exhaust emissions. The con- ditions which yielded the greatest adverse effects on emissions were: 1) low temperature-urban driving cycle, and 2) high temperature-New York City driving cycle. The data also indicate that the use of air conditioners causes increased emission levels. 1980 SA E Transactions 800513. Designing with RR1M. Gullmar V. Nelson and Alfred J. Dąbrowski, Davidson Rubber Divi- sion, Ex-Cell-0 Corporation . With the completion of nine RRIM prototype programs at Davidson, the feasibility of producing RRIM automotive body panels has been demonstrated. The advantages RRIM offers to the automotive industry are documented by data obtained in these programs and emphasized with an in depth case study of one part. A set of material and design guidelines are presented which will help to ensure successful realization of RRIM's benefits. 800514. Reinforced RIM urethanes - The Lightweight Car Body of the 80s. Rodney F. Lloyd, Jefferson Chemical Co., Inc., Subsidiary of Texaco Inc., Austin, TX. Exterior body panels made from reinforced reaction injection molded (RRIM) urethanes are showing consid- erable promise for the automotive industry as a means of making lighter weight parts having corrosion and damage resistance. RRIM urethanes offer many advantages over metal and competitive plastic materials for these appli- cations. Market projections and encouraging develop- mental efforts by automotive companies indicate RRIM urethanes will be widely used in the automobile industry in the near future. Proper understanding of RRIM urethanes is essential as these materials are evaluated for specific exterior body panel applications. Factors influencing the successful utilization of RRIM urethanes are discussed as related to mold design, material processing, and physical properties of the materials. Successful ways to control these factors are discussed. 88</page><page sequence="70">800515-800523 800515. Variables in Reinforced RIM. Robert L. McBrayer, BASF Wyandotte Corporation. In order to meet governmental requirements for auto- motive fuel economy, light weight materials must replace conventional materials. Reinforced reaction injection molded (RRIM) polyurethanes are expected to play a major role in weight reduction. Variations which must be considered in producing RRIM include the machinery, resin matrix, reinforcing material, and processing effects. Suitable production equipment appears to have been developed. Milled glass fiber reinforced RIM appears ready to compete on a commercial basis with SMC and BMC for exterior automotive applications. RRIM parts are self-supporting in thin sections, have a coefficient of thermal expansion approaching that of steel, and have very low shrinkage rates. 1 980 SA E Transactions 800516. High Modulus Epoxy RIM Systems. H. E. De La Mare, T. F. Brownscombe, W. G. Gottenberg and R. H. Overcashier, Shell Development Co., Westhollow Research Center, Houston, TX. The RIM (Reaction Injection Molding) processing of several amine-cured epoxy resin systems has been shown to give a family of high modulus, high strength moldings with short "in mold" times. The mechanical properties of the RIM thermosets obtained from six different epoxy resin formulations are discussed in detail and the performance properties of epoxies and other RIM mate- rials are compared. 800517. Analysis of Piston Slap-Induced Noise and As- sessment of Some Methods of Control in Diesel Engines. S. D. Haddad and D. A. Howard, Loughborough Univ. of Technology. In diesel engines with combustion-optimised for fuel consumption or emissions, mechanically-induced noise tends to control the overall engine noise level with that due to piston slap being predominant. Previous studies, mainly experimental, have helped to clarify the mecha- nism of the piston slap phenomenon and have suggested methods of control. This paper presents the latest results of a theoretical analysis of the piston slap dynamics which yields predictions of some optimum piston design features for low piston slap-induced noise related to the estimated mechanical efficiency of the engine. 1980 SA E Transactions 800520. An Optimal Linear Active Suspension with Finite Road Preview. A. G. Thompson, B. R. Davis and C. E. M. Pearce, Univ. of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia. A theory of optimal feed-forward control is developed, for a linear system with a disturbance input, based on the analogy between a filtered white noise and a unit step. The theory is applied to an active unicycle suspension on a random road with finite preview and the effect of preview time on the performance index determined. The electrohydraulic system proposed has a fixed preview distance and requires feedback of the body state variables plus feedforward of the previewed road input through a shift register sequence which is adaptable to a wide range of speeds by automatic switching. 1980 SA E Transactions 800521. Development of a Real-Time Digital Computer Simulation of a Turbocharged Diesel Engine. S. S. Shamsi, Pakistan State Oil Co. Ltd. Real-time computer simulations allow frequency response testing of the system and also give the engineer a better 'feel' of the system response when he looks at the visual display. In this paper, a mathematical model based on the quasi-steady state assumption and the development of a 'real-time digital' computer simulation suitable for inves- tigating transient system response have been described. A thermal capacity effect for the exhaust temperature and the influence of pulsating flow conditions at the turbine inlet have also been described. 'Real-Time Digital' operation was achieved on a time-sharing system by using an analogue computer as a real-time clock and as a signalling device. Good agreement between the predicted and the test-bed transient results, prediction of smoke and 'real-time digital' operation are three distinct features. 800522. Automotive Challenges to the Finishing Industry. William E. Tudor, Pontiac Motor Div., Pontiac, MI. The automotive industry faces severe challenges in meeting both legislated requirements and market-place forces of the 1980's. Many of these challenges impact on topcoat finishing of appearance parts. The purpose of this paper is to identify these forces and to describe antici- pated needs and changes in topcoat finishing in response to these forces. The impact of specific legislation and the approaches being used for resolution are discussed. 800523.

Influence of Resilience on Endurance in a Tandem Axle System. Gösta E. Valiin and Lars-Göran Larsson, Volvo Truck Corp. A thorough study of the forces in the suspension components of a new tandem axle concept revealed very high parasitic forces due to friction. By reduction of friction and by adding some resilience the forces were considerably reduced giving longer life and extended load carrying capacity to the system. The way this was achieved is aimed to be shown in this paper. 800529. Truck Splash and Spray - Some Recent Results. David H. Weir, Systems Technology, Inc., Hawthorne, CA. This paper highlights the results of a program to study the effects of truck aerodynamics, splash, and spray. The approach has involved state of the art review and assessment, analysis, laboratory tests, model scale wind tunnel experiments, full scale tests, cost effectiveness analysis, and field evaluations. This paper summarizes the latter activities. The emphasis has been on devices fixed to trucks which can modify the air flow properties around the truck and reduce the formation and propagation of splash and spray as experienced by adjacent motorists. Such devices have been conceptualized, developed as prototypes, and tested under full scale and over the road conditions. 1980 SA E Transactions 800530. Trouble and Countermeasure of Seals for Au- tomotive Application - Part II. Hiroshi Hira- bayashi, Masamichi Oh taki and Tatsuaki Yuki- masa, Nippon Oil Seal Industry Co., Ltd. (Japan); and Susumu lida, NOK, Inc. (U.S.A.). In order to improve the reliability of seals for automotive application in practical use, it is considered that further basic investigations concerning sealing characteristics of seals are necessary. However, it has been found, from analyzing seals decided in the market as defective parts, that the troubles of seals in the market are mainly caused by both wrong handling for seals and the use under wrong operating condition which has not been expected by manufacturers of seals. Therefore, in order to improve the reliability of seals, it is important to investigate in detail troubles on functional characteristics of seals and their countermea- sures. In this paper, on oil seals, O-rings, water pump seals and dust cover seals as seals for automotive application, the results of investigations are discussed. 800531. Development of New Type Oil Seal for Auto- motive Application. Hiroshi Hirabayashi, Masa- michi Oh taki and Tatsuaki Yukimasa, Nippon Oil Seal Industry Co., Ltd. (Japan); and Akira Matsushima, NOK, Inc. (U.S.A.). New type oil seals - non wo ven fabric secondary lip type oil seals are recently widely used for one of the sealing apparatus for automotive application. Basic improvement of this type of seals is in a secondary lip which prevents solid foreign matters such as dust and sand from entering into the rubbing portion between a primary lip of oil seals and a shaft. This secondary lip is superior in anti-dust property, wear resistance, following ability to the shaft eccentricity and air permeability to the conventional secondary lip of rubber. And the sealing performance of new type seals with the secondary lip made of special nonwoven fabrics is more stable than that of the conventional rubber seals. 800534.

Analysis of Gas Exchange Process of S. I. Engines Under City-Driving Conditions. Hide- nori Tasaka and Shin Matsuoka, Tokyo Inst, of Technology. A precise and simplified prediction method of volumetric efficiency and burned gas fraction in the cylinder charge, which are closely related to the power output, emissions, and fuel economy, has been required for the most frequent conditions of city-driving. A fixed volume plenum model for the intake and exhaust manifold was used as an analytical model of the gas exchange process, because of the very small effects of pulsation under these conditions. The application limit and the close examination of this model were investigated by experiments and calculations on the volumetric efficiency and burned gas fractions in the cylinder charge. Furthermore the IMEP, ISNO, ISFC were predicted for the changes in the valve timings. As a result, it was clarified that a wide range of operating conditions would fall within the limits of this prediction model, and this model was valid in predicting the gas exchange process under city-driving conditions. 90</page><page sequence="72">800536-800543 800536. Liquid Crystal Display for Automotive Instrument Panel. K. Toriyama, T. Ishibashi, M. Kohyama and T. Takemoto, Hitachi, Ltd. A liquid-crystal display using the twisted nematic mode was developed for an automotive instrument panel. A low viscosity, quick response liquid crystal of wide nematic range (-30 to 85 °C) was designed with the aid of the molecular theory for viscosity of liquid crystals. A liquid crystal less than 20 cp at 25 °C with wide mesomorphic range (-30 to 85 °C) was developed. A display with this material gave quick response, about one and one-half seconds at -30°C. For the most uniform response and widest viewing angle, a liquid crystal molecular alignment of low tilt angle was developed. A simple rubbing alignment tech- nique was used which is compatible to glass sealing. A polarizer resistive to high temperature and high humidity was applied. The display can be operated with good performance and high reliability. 1980 SA E Transactions 800537. Thin Film Semiconductor NOx Sensor. Shih-Chia Chang, Electronics Dept., General Motors Re- search Labs., Warren, MI. In direct contact with untreated, undiluted exhaust gases, the resistance of the thin film semiconductor tin oxide NOx sensor (TFS sensor) shows strong dependence on engine air-to-fuel ratio (A/F). The peak resistance of the sensor occurs around 17-18 A/F. From frequency re- sponse tests, the sensor response time constant is esti- mated to be ~1.1 seconds. A chemiluminiscent NOx analyzer (CLA) is used to measure the NO and NOx concentrations in the exhaust gases, while the No2 content is estimated from [NOx] - [NO] measurements. Peak concentrations of NO and N02 occur at 15 A/F and 17-18 A/F, respectively. The N02 peak position is very close to the sensor resistance peak position. While EGR drastically reduces the NO content, it shows a smaller effect on the sensor resistance, especially around the stoichiometric condition. 1980 SA E Transactions 800539.

The Utilization of Alternative Fuels in a Diesel Engine Using Different Methods. E. Holmér, P. S. Berg and B-I Bertilsson, Volvo Truck Corp. Development work has been carried out on a turbo charged direct injection diesel engine with methanol, ethanol and gasoline. Using additives to increase the cetane number, emulsion with diesel fuel, forced ignition with diesel injected prior to the alternative fuel, by a separate injection system and carburetion are the methods which have been investigated. Spark ignited diesel has been studied and is commented on to complete the picture. The intention of the paper is to evaluate these methods. 800545. (SP-463) Handling-Characteristics Simulations of Car-Trailer Systems. R. J. Anderson, Defence Research Establishment Atlantic (Dartmouth/Nova Scotia); and E. F. Kurtz, Jr., Dept. of Mechanical Engrg. Queen's Univ. (Kingston/Ontario). Two theoretical models are described for simulating the handling characteristics of automobiles towing trailers. These models are similar except that one excludes roll dynamically and has only four degrees of freedom, whereas the other includes roll dynamically and has six degrees of freedom. Both models are extensively validated by comparing digital-computer results obtained from them with experimental data obtained by Systems Tech- nology, Inc. Both models yielded excellent simulations of measures of handling characteristics, the model with six degrees of freedom being slightly superior. Nonetheless, the most important conclusion of this study is that excellent simulations of handling characteristics of car- trailer systems can be obtained with a model having only four degrees of freedom. The study includes a sensitivity analysis to indicate the importance of certain effects included in the models. 1980 SAE Transactions 800546. European Activity Concerning Engine Oil Vis- cosity Classification - Part III. A. Cassiani Ingoni, G. F. Di Lelio, N. Van Os and M. Vickars, Coordinating European Council. As a follow up to earlier publications, this paper reports on recent work carried out in Europe, within CEC, in the field of high shear reology aimed at defining a simple method to measure viscosity as seen by the engine. Seven SAE 15W-50 calibration oils were tested in a large number of high shear viscometers, engine tests and rigs in order to determine if any correlation was possible. The work has shown that the low shear viscosity does not correlate with the behaviour of the oil in the engine and that the viscosity under high shear conditions is from 70 to 90% of the low shear viscosity. Correlation was found between high shear viscometers and power loss/oil-flow in engines. Further work on lower viscosity oils is underway. 800601. Business Aircraft Turbofan Technology Progress in the 1970's, Challenges in the 1980's. F. B. Wallace, AiResearch Manufacturing Company of Arizona, A Division of the Garrett Corpo- ration, Phoenix, Arizona. Turbofan engines for use in business aircraft service have achieved a high level of productivity. Technology devel- oped during the past 10 years has contributed to the good fuel consumption, low noise and emissions, and growth in thrust levels shown in these engines. Recent progress in materials, aCtodynamics, and acoustic technology are reviewed, including the Garrett/NASA Quiet Clean General Aviation Turbofan (QCGAT) Program. New technologies are projected which can be developed in the 1980's in response to changing worldwide conditions. These new technologies must provide further increases in efficiency and productivity, as well as to allow for use of alternate fuels and materials. 1980 SAE Transactions 800602. A New High Bypass Fan for General Aviation. J. W. Schräder, Avco Lycoming Division, Strat- ford, Connecticut. A small, high bypass turbofan engine, suitable for use in general aviation aircraft, was designed, built and tested. Key features of the engine include low noise, low exhaust emissions and high propulsive efficiency. Testing was conducted with a simulated flight nacelle. Exhaust emissions were measured and the noise data taken was used to predict sideline, takeoff and approach noise levels. 800603. Evolution of the Allison Model 250 Engine. E. C. Stevens and F. E. Conn, Detroit Diesel Allison, Div. of General Motors Corp. Evolution of the Allison Model 250 gas turbine engine is traced from model inception to the more recent 250-C28B, C28C and C30 models. The application of advances in compressor, combustor and turbine aerodynamics, coup- led with the application of newly developed analytical techniques, has resulted in production engine models with improved performance and a high degree of confidence. Recent aerodynamic and structural advances have permitted the evolution of a single stage 8.5:1 centrifugal compressor from a multi-stage 7:1 axial-centrifugal compressor characteristic of earlier 250 models. This increase in pressure ratio is accomplished without loss of compressor efficiency, resulting in a 6% improvement in SFC. The application of improved analytical techniques also has permitted a more accurate assessment of the stress and vibratory state of recontoured turbine airfoils resulting in reduced losses and increased aerodynamic efficiency. 92</page><page sequence="74">800605-800611 800605.

Cabin Pressure Control Systems for General Aviation Aircraft. P. J. Taylor, AiResearch Manufacturing Company of California. This paper presents a brief history of early cabin pressure control systems commencing with the Boeing B-29 and culminating with commercial transports of the immediate post-WW II era. The two most significant control and outflow valve design breakthroughs applicable to post- 1950 commercial and general aviation cabin pressure control systems are analyzed. The first production-model general aviation aircraft cabin pressure control system is described and followed by a discussion of the state of the art of general aviation reciprocating and jet engine aircraft cabin pressure control systems through 1978. An ad- vanced-design automated microprocessor digital cabin pressure control system applicable to new-generation jet aircraft also is presented, with consideration of future cabin pressure control systems for reciprocating and jet-type general aviation aircraft. 1980 SA E Transactions 800607. Environmental Control Systems for Executive Jet Aircraft. George Payne, AiResearch Mfg. Co. of California. This paper briefly presents the history of environmental control systems for executive jet aircraft and the current state of the art, and a summary of present trends. Bleed air controls, refrigeration equipment, temperature controls, interfaces with engines, and auxiliary power units are discussed. Bleed air control concepts have changed from the early systems where only one engine stage was bled and bleed air did not require precooling, to current systems incorporating precooling, bleed air switching between high- and low-stage engine ports, and double redundancy requirements for certification above 45,000 ft. Refrigeration equipment is reviewed from early simple turbine and fan units to current three-wheel and air bearing designs, through the various recirculation schemes using compound machines, jet pumps, and fans to reduce the bleed air extraction penalties and the use of high- pressure water separation, which, when combined with an air bearing turbine, completely eliminates periodic main- tenance. Temperature controls are traced from early vacuum tube and relay types to current pneumatic and solid-state-driven electropneumatic transducers, with a brief discussion of skin temperature sensors. 800608.

Advanced Materials for Agricultural Aircraft. Richard Q. Boyles, Lockheed-Georgia Co. A study of advanced system design requirements for aerial applications aircraft for agriculture by the Lockheed- Georgia Company under contract to the NASA indicated that advanced composite structures appear to offer both performance and economic advantages when applied to these aircraft. Agricultural aircraft preliminary designs incorporating both conventional and advanced composite structural materials were studied using an aerial appli- cation operations analysis model. These studies indicate that an all-composite agricultural aircraft would provide a 6% improvement in mission productivity over that of a conventional all-aluminum aircraft, and essentially equal mission economics. Used selectively in its most effective structural manner, composite materials can provide improvements of the order of 5% in both mission productivity and economics. These studies also indicate that composite materials offer a significant potential for reducing the severe corrosion problems common to aerial application aircraft. 800611.

Thermal Expansion Molding Process for Aircraft Composite Structures. Walter S. Cremens, Lockheed-Georgia Co., Marietta, GA. Thermal expansion molding is a low-cost manufacturing method for fabricating fiber-reinforced-resin composite structures. In its simplest form, the tooling is self- pressurized by thermal expansion of solid "rubber" blocks inside a closed hard mold box. To provide closer control of molding pressure, hollow rubber blocks may be pressurized from an external source. A procedure for sizing castable rubber tools is explained, and several examples of integrally molded complex structures are shown. 1980 SAE Transactions 800614. Improvements Required in Air Traffic Control to Meet Increasing General Aviation Turbine Pow- ered Aircraft Operations. David D. Thomas, General Aviation Mfrs. Assn. The increase in the general aviation turbine powered fleet by 1990 will require reorientation of the airport, air traffic control, and weather information systems. This is nec- essary in order to accommodate direct flights between some 5,000 airports, on a random basis, approximately the same volume of scheduled air carrier flights between less than 400 airports. Methods of increasing automation in ATC and weather service and changes in procedures are suggested. The largest obstacle to growth will be airport capacity in metropolitan areas. 800615. The Air Traffic Control System - Is it a System? Fred B. Mcintosh, National Business Aircraft Association, Inc. The Nation's airspace is finite and only proper man- agement of this valuable asset will permit the safe movement of the ever increasing numbers of aircraft. The current system will not permit the flexibility required to handle the projected traffic unless traffic flows can be permitted with minimum separation and minimum human involvement from the monitoring agency. Today's system is an evolvement from the basic human controller-to- morrow's system must place the controller in a man- agement role with intervention only during times of system abnormality. Separation assurance is the reason for the air traffic control system (ATC). This capability must be a redundant one with the pilot having information available in the event of the failure of the ATC 'system'. The more independent of the ground environment the pilot's separation data can be the more desirable such a system would be. Proponents of the theoretical capabil- ities of the Navstar satellite program seem to ignore the political reality that no navigation system controlled by a military arm of a State can ever be acceptable in the ICAO forum as witness the development and acceptable acceptance cycle of the OMEGA/VLF system. 800616. Aircraft Collision Avoidance and Separation Assurance. C. Dennis Wright, Aircraft Owners and Pilots Assn. With regard to collision avoidance systems, AOPA, in concert with a number of general aviation and airline representative groups, worked out a "core" position on collision avoidance and separation assurance late in 1976. We recommended that the FAA continue the devel- opment of the BCAS concept. This was done on the basis of the then posture of the FAA that the BCAS would work effectively against any aircraft equipped with today's transponder and encoder. We also supported exploration of the DABS as the air-to-air link of the BCAS as well as for future use with the automated ATC system. While ACAS presents the least technical risk and operational units could be available sooner than using any other concept, it does pose the greatest difficulty in becoming an effective system as all aircraft in a given airspace would have to be equipped to provide complete protection. 800617. Vibration Aspects of Small Turbine Engines in Aircraft Installations. M. Botman, Pratt &amp; Whit- ney Aircraft of Canada Ltd. Vibrations experienced in PT6 and JT15D installations are reviewed. The JT15D turbojet vibrations are due primarily to rotor unbalances which may produce signif- icant responses at some of the critical speeds. The PT6 turboprop vibrations are mainly caused by the propeller and, therefore, occur at low frequencies. PT6 gearbox vibrations at very high frequencies are of interest in the production process. Typical vibration problems are discussed. 800618. Research on a High Work Axial Gas Generator Turbine. K. V. Patel, Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft of Canada Ltd. (Longueuil/Quebec). A previous phase of the Canadian government and in-house sponsored turbine research program established guide lines for the current design of a high-work axial gas turbine, capable of operating at a high total pressure ratio of 3.9. Aerodynamic results from tests on this research turbine are presented in this paper. A number of variants of this basic design was also tested, which indicated the effect on aerodynamic performance of geometric changes such as vane tangential lean, rotor tip partial shrouds and tip clearance. 800621.

The business jet industry is in the midst of a prolific avionics revolution which, if not properly integrated, will soon result in a semi-crisis of having used up all the panel space, all black box space, lowered reliability, and increased weight. It can be alleviated if our industry joins together to plan for its advent. 800625. Discrete Address Beacon System - The Obvious Alternative. P. D. Hodgkins, Systems Research and Development Service, Federal Aviation Administration, Washington, D.C. The Discrete Address Beacon System is a major devel- opment program to upgrade the Air Traffic Control (ATC) system of the future. It provides improved ATC automation services and a ground based collision avoid- ance system- Automatic Traffic Advisory and Resolution Services (ATARS). It is totally compatible with the present civil/military ATC system and reduces the present RF interference environment. It has an integral data link system to service the ATARS and provide other ATC related services. The ATARS is being developed for use in high aircraft density airspace such as major airport terminals. Ii is concluded that DABS is the obvious alternative to meet the air traffic control needs of the future. 800626. Flight Management Systems - Central Ingredient of the 1980's Avionics Shipset? Gregory W. Tomsic, Rockwell International, Collins Avi- onics Group-General Aviation Division. Flight Management Systems promise to be of consid- erable use in the aircraft cockpit of the 1980's. By providing to the pilot and aircraft operator a consolidated system to simplify the flight management task while optimizing aircraft operating time and saving fuel, these systems will and should be considered a necessary ingredient in the 1980's avionics shipset. Perhaps their greatest asset will be their ability to reduce the time that the pilot spends on tasks that take his attention away from his primary objective - safe aircraft flight. 800627. Future Trends in Automatic Flight Control Systems. Paul Rauschelbach, Sperry Flight Systems, Avionics Div. Future developments in business jet autopilots will build on present day configurations using technological ad- vancements such as microprocessors, memory systems, solid state sensors, and electronic displays. The archi- tecture of future autopilots will be further integrated with peripheral systems, dual redundant in configuration, and interconnected on a digital bus, and will utilize solid state displays. Operational features including new modes, improved reliability, self monitoring and maintenance tests will also be found in future business jet autopilots. 800628. The Prediction of Off-Design Characteristics of Axial and Axial/Centrifugal Compressors. J. A. Raw and G. C. Weir, Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft of Canada Ltd. A computerized method is described for constructing loss models for axial compressor blade rows, both as a function of inlet gas direction and Mach number, with gas-path and cascade geometry required as input. A mean line off-design prediction of the compressor characteristics is obtained by stacking the stage char- acteristics derived from these loss models. By calibrating the computer program calculations against measured test results a high degree of success in predicting the performance of modified and/or new designs has been achieved. Predictions covering the complete operating range from ground idle to maximum cruise conditions are possible for up to 16 stages, including the effects of variable stators and interstage bleed. 800629. Test Results from an Analytically Designed Axial Compressor Stage of 1.65:1 Pressure Ratio. T. Yoshinaka and A. D. LeBlanc, Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft of Canada Ltd. A single stage axial compressor was designed for 1.53:1 pressure ratio using a quasi-three dimensional design method which consists of an iterative calculation between the radial equilibrium and blade-to-blade analyses in- cluding surface boundary layers. This stage was tested in place of the production first stage of a three stage axial combined with a single stage centrifugal (3A+1C) compressor in a research gas generator. Based on stator exit traverses, the research stage reached 87.8% adiabatic efficiency and 1.65:1 pressure ratio at the design speed. The overall compressor effi- ciency improved significantly at high speeds in compar- ison with the existing 3A+1C compressor, without any obvious performance deterioration at part speed. Some aspects of the design method are discussed and the test results are presented in this paper. 1980 SA E Transactions 95</page><page sequence="77">800630-800665 800630.

Common Cause Failure Analysis - Why Inter- locked Redundant Systems Fail. John P. Rankin, Boeing Co. Studies of operating experiences over the last two decades have shown an increase in the number of operating incidents attributed to multiple failures as opposed to the classical case of single failures. This paper presents an overview of a unique approach that has recently been developed to address susceptibility of electrical control systems to combined multiple failures of components and operators. The philosophical re- quirement for the approach will be discussed, and insight into the evolution of the technique will be provided. The approach will be described in terms of system safety and reliability tools in an integrated mix coupled with a logical process of identifying possible causative factors for the multiple failures. The technique also identifies specific points of system susceptibility to the causative mecha- nisms and suggests the capability for design avoidance considerations. An example will be given to illustrate the type of electrical problems addressed. 1980 SA E Transactions 800660. The 600C Loader - Development of a Universal Earthmoving/Mining Tool. Frederick J.

Engine Technology for Alternative Fuels. R. W. Hum, Bartlesville, Oklahoma. Within the next decade there is opportunity to bring about favorable matching of engines to fuels that can be made available. The effort should be one of parallel experiment and iterative adjustment in the separate but technically- interactive fields of engine and fuels development. The author suggests that engine development should be directed toward utilization of alcohols as well as fuels that are basically traditional in character but trend toward lower combustion quality and toward extended boiling range. Improved but still-traditional power plants, a stratified-charge engine for broad-cut fuels, and the slow-speed diesel for heavy minimally refined fuels are suggested as the engine technologies for development toward the most advantageous use of alternative fuels. 800664. Worldwide Safety and Environmental Regula- tions. Darrell E. Wolbers, Corporate Offices, JI Case Co. United States construction equipment manufacturers are subject to a maze of product-oriented regulations in marketing their U.S.-built products in foreign countries. These same obstacles face their foreign-built products. In the past, these foreign regulations were more apt to be trade barriers to protect domestic markets than bonafide regulations to protect the users. These trade barriers are gradually being lifted because manufacturers in virtually all countries have now expanded beyond their domestic markets. Thus, the same manufacturers that formerly encouraged trade barriers must now cope with them. This expansion of markets now encourages the elimination of trade barriers and the harmonization of regulations. For the future, regulations will be retained and expanded. They will, however, be harmonized with international voluntary standards rather than having different regulations for each country. 1980 SA E Transactions 800665. Sourcing Products and Materials on an Inter- national Basis. W. O. Wilkening, International 96</page><page sequence="78">800667-800672 Sales, Hydreco, A Unit of General Signal. United States construction equipment manufacturers over the past decade have expanded their manufacturing capabilities, creating a need for international supply of materials and components. A simple plan is presented to assist the Design Engineer source components and materials on an international basis. 800667. Asbestos Free Brakes and Dry Clutches Rein- forced With Kevlar® Aramid Fiber. Halvar Y. Loken, Industrial Fibers Div., E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., Inc., Wilmington, DE. Kevlar® aramid fiber contributes strength and wear resistance to asbestos free friction materials. The efficient strengthening provided by Kevlar® aramid makes it possible to select inert fillers on the basis of thermal and wear characteristics with less co'ncern about other physical characteristics of the filler. The resulting asbestos free friction materials can thus outperform the incumbent asbestos materials in critical applications. 1980 SA E Transactions 800668. Cummins KTA-3067 Engine. James H. Garrett, Cummins Engine Co., Inc. A new heavy duty 16 cylinder diesel engine producing 1600 brake horsepower in the turbocharged and after- cooled version has been designed, developed, and intro- duced into production. This engine is an extension of the K series of engines having 6% in. bore and 6l/4 in. stroke giving a total displacement of 3067 cu.in. The design emphasizes maximum utilization of common parts and tooling. Design details of components unique to the KTA-3067 engine are covered as well as development activities and the reliability assessment program. Future development programs to uprate the engine to 1800 brake horsepower are described. 800669. The CLBT9680, an Automatic Transmission for Off-highway Vehicles. J. R. Allen and J. P. Cornet, Detroit Diesel Allison, Division of General Motors Corporation. In the past few years, engine power ratings have steadily increased. To meet the demand of engine and vehicle manufacturers for a transmission to match these larger engines, Detroit Diesel Allison developed the CLBT9680 transmission. This transmission has been designed and developed to operate in rear-dump trucks up to 127 tonne (140- ton) capacity, and in bottom- or side-dump trucks up to 154 tonne (170- ton) capacity. In these applications the CLBT9680 has a power rating up to 1007 kW (1350 ghp). The transmission can also be approved with engines rated up to 1093 kW (1465 ghp) in special purpose installations such as oil field service equipment. In this paper the transmission design and test devel- opment programs are presented. In addition, the extensive development programs are discussed relative to per- formance and reliability goals for the transmission. 800670. Application of EHL Theory to Gear Lubrication. A. Jackson and C. N. Rowe, Central Research Div., Mobil Research and Development Corp., Princeton, NJ. The concept of EHL, and simplified equations for calculating the isothermal elastohydrodynamic lubricant film thickness between meshing gear teeth, are presented. The only physical property of the lubricant required is the lubricant parameter (LP), which combines both the viscosity and the viscosity-pressure characteristics. The value of LP can accurately be determined by direct measurement of the oil film thickness in an optical EHL apparatus. Since LP is dependent on temperature, meas- urements are made at different temperatures and the data presented in the form of charts of LP vs. temperature. The quality of lubrication of gears can be expressed as the ratio of the EHL film thickness to the composite surface roughness of the gear teeth, frequently called the specific film thickness. Data relating the probability of gear distress to the specific film thickness will be reviewed. Lubricant selection for a desired value of the specific film thickness can be made through LP. Under certain operating conditions the EHL film thickness may be significantly less than that calculated from theory. Correction factors are provided for non- isothermal conditions and for lubricant starvation in the EHL contact of meshing gear teeth. Effects of VI- improved and non-Newtonian oils are considered. 1980 SA E Transactions 800672. Better Hydraulic Systems Conceived via APL. Gian Luca Zarotti, CEMOTER, Earthmoving Research Center (Torino/Italy); and Nicola Nervegna, Istituto di Macchine, Politecnico di Torino. Effective methodologies are detailed to help synthesising better hydraulic systems in terms of efficiency and control characteristics. In principle, by considering the system dissected in "Multipole Blocks" with appropriate linking strategies, the approach enlightens the role of digital computers and the viability of problem oriented Software when proper strategies and techniques receive adequate implementation. The entire study and the ensuing computer code are both grounded on the programming language "APL". Based on a reference system, an extensive analysis is detailed finally leading to the presentation of optimization procedures to help demonstrate, on practical bases, the versatility of the proposed approach. An unconstrained optimization APL code is reported in the Appendix, illustrating a remote terminal session to solve a typical test problem. Altogether the paper tends to elucidate the soundness 97</page><page sequence="79">800673-800681 of computer aided design concepts with special emphasis on methods to attain an ultimate goal: hydraulic systems synthesis. 1980 SA E Transactions 800673. How to Be a More Effective Leader. Larry E. Short, Drake Univ. Engineering managers should return to the basics of scientific inquiry to be more effective leaders. The basic scientific method used by management pioneers can be applied to the process of leadership to ascertain the most effective methods of managing subordinates. The concept of Scientific Leadership combines the trusted techniques of scientific analysis with modern behavioral knowledge to develop a leadership approach which is custom designed to increase the productivity of each employee. 800674. Hazard Control. J. B. Codlin, Fiat-Allis CMI, Springfield, IL, G. Edwin Burks Lecture. The prime objective for the construction machinery industry is to design and manufacture machinery which will produce more work, more reliability and at a lower cost per unit of work. Serviceability, availability, life, performance, operator comfort, safety, and cost are included in the machinery design parameters. Due to the highly competitive atmosphere of the market place, continual attention is given to these parameters in the engineering and manufacturing disci- pline. 800675. Electronics on a John Deere Scraper. Wayne E. Gruben, John Deere Industrial Equipment, Product Engineering Center; and Dean L. Heino, John Deere Product Engineering Center. The JD862 Scraper uses armrest mounted electrical switches to control the transmission and scraper functions. A microprocessor based transmission controller provides different shifting sequences for different operating re- quirements. This controller also includes on-board di- agnostics to monitor for electrical failures and can immediately react to reduce the effect of a failure. An electronically controlled elevator provides infinitely var- iable elevator speeds. 800676. Little Known Facts Affecting Teflon® Fabric Bearing Life. Bernard Harris, Rexnord Inc. The use of woven Teflon® fibers to make self-lubricated bearings had its inception during the middle 1950's. State-of-the-art has been to upgrade the bearings by using fiber blends to improve bonding, reliability, and adhesives for load capacity. But little attention has been made to the effects of the mating surface. These factors, such as finish characteristics, corrosion caused by the environment, and platings are as important as the bearing itself. Analysis of the mating surface is necessary if engineers are going to properly design maintenance-free equipment using high load capacity self-lubricated bearings. 1980 SA E Transactions 800678. Environmental Factors and Bearing Damage. M. R. Hoeprich and R. L. Widner, The Timken Co. Environmental effects on fatigue and non-fatigue modes of tapered roller bearing damage are discussed. Primary emphasis is placed on the influence of load, speed, lubricant and temperature on the fatigue modes of damage. Effects of dissolved water in oil, traction fluids and fire resistant hydraulic fluids are included. 1980 SA E Transactions 800679. ROPS Field Performance - A Status Report. Jack L. Woodward, Woodward Associates, Inc.; and Stephen Swan, U.S. Bureau of Mines, Twin Cities Mining Research Center. The question, "Are ROPS providing adequate operator protection?" is addressed by conducting analyses of rollover accidents and reviewing ROPS certification test data. It was found that ROPS generally exceed structural performance requirements and do reduce the number of injuries and deaths due to rollovers on mining and construction machines. It was also determined that the severity of rollovers vary widely between different types of machines, that quality control during ROPS fabrication is very important, and the chances of surviving a rollover are enhanced substantially by wearing a seat belt. 800680. The Development of Improved Ingress/Egress Systems for Large Haulage Trucks. Gary R. Gavan and Donald P. Strassel, Woodward Associates, Inc.; and David Johnson, U.S. Bureau of Mines, Twin Cities Mining Research Center. Over one-third of all haul truck accidents in mines are related to mounting or dismounting the vehicle. An evaluation of the safety hazards associated with ingress and egress on these vehicles showed that most of the accidents occurred near the bottom of the ladder. The major hazardous design conditions were identified as excessively flexible supports for lower steps or rungs, inappropriate ground-level-to-first-step distances, poor step designs, and inadequate handrail and guardrail designs. Additional hazards are introduced by the lack of proper maintenance of ladder hardware and the work practices of operators in carrying articles onto the truck. Several improved ladder designs were designed and tested. They are currently undergoing long-term testing in operating mines. 800681. Training Mobile Equipment Operators. Louis Schaffer, Woodward Associates, Inc.; and Edwin Ayres, U.S. Bureau of Mines. Mobile equipment is involved in a large number of the 98</page><page sequence="80">800682-800693 fatal accidents and nonfatal injuries in surface mines. Accident and training research suggests that one of the principal reasons is the inadequate training provided for many mobile equipment operators, especially in terms of their ability to cope with unusual and unexpected events. A concept for providing the needed training, formulated by Woodward Associates, Inc. and based on personal injury, and noninjury, accident phenomena research, is presented and explained. Some of the training materials developed to implement the concept are described, including an on-board simulator of abnormal conditions. Cost comparisons are made between training programs which utilize these materials, customary on-the-job train- ing programs and training programs which might use a high fidelity, all-function, simulator as the principal teaching device. 800682. Radio Remote Control of Earthmoving Equip- ment. Kim W. Wilson, United Systems Engrg. Corp. Radio Control of earthmoving equipment was originally introduced to relieve bulldozer operators of the intense heat and dust which was underneath the basic oxygen furnaces at steel mills. With proper insulating and other related safeguards, the remotely controlled bulldozers can even operate under the furnaces while they are still in use. Other companies use remotely controlled loaders and/or bulldozers to excavate basements underneath existing buildings, or on treacherous terrain. Whatever the application, technology and safeguards have made this a very reliable and safe system for both the operator and the earthmoving equipment itself. 800686. Developing and Validating a "User-Oriented" Fatigue Analysis Program. Thomas C. Dilger, Structural Dynamics Research Corporation. In recent years there has been significant progress in the theoretical aspects of fatigue life prediction. Coinciden- tally, a significant increase in the amount of computing power per dollar has become available. These factors have created tremendous interest in reliable, easy-to-use soft- ware to facilitate the fatigue analysis process. Structural Dynamics Research Corporation, SDRC, has performed many strain gauge test projects since its inception in 1967 and has used computers in experimental stress analysis since 1974. However, our first widely distributed, commercially available fatigue analysis pro- gram did not become available until recently. This paper reviews the development of the require- ments for this software package, documents the basic approach used in the software architecture, and docu- ments the method used to validate the software. 1 980 SA E Transactions 800689. Injection Molding of Thermoplastics. William E. Foster, Mitchell Plastics, Inc. The material presented is a brief survey of what injection molding is, when and how to use it to produce or to obtain a needed part, its economics, its capabilities and limi- tations, its present status and future potential. The future of injection molding appears to be bright. In 1979, approximately 18 billion pounds of thermo- plastics were injection molded in the United States and statistical forecasters focused on the general plastics industry are projecting near term annual increases of 10% to 15% per year. 800690. Improving Profit: Taking Value Management Back to the Job. Christopher M. Barlow, John- son Controls, Inc., Milwaukee, WI. Value Management is a design for thinking. Individuals and groups following this design consistently produce profitable changes in the design of products, services, processes, procedures, and systems. The productivity of these efforts, measured in profit before tax return on invested meeting cost significantly exceeds the produc- tivity of other efforts. This paper describes Value Management and its successes, lists resources available for learning Value Management, and outlines ways in which individuals can begin to reap the benefits of Value Management in their organization. 800691. Single Chip Microcomputers. Gene H. Miller, Electrical Engrg., General Motors Inst., Flint, MI. The integrated circuit manufacturing technology has advanced rapidly and steadily since the introduction of the first microprocessor. Ever increasing chip sizes and densities along with increasing numbers of pins per package have been the result. These advances have enabled IC manufacturers to put all of the functional electronics of a microcomputer into a single integrated circuit. This evolution and the resulting single chip microcomputers are described. 800692. Marathon LeTourneau's D-800 Wheel Dozer. Roger Wolfe, Marathon LeTourneau Co. Marathon LeTourneau's D-800 rubber tire dozer was developed specifically to meet the high production demands associated with strip mining reclamation. The electric propulsion system (diesel engine, ac generator, wheel motors and solid state control system) design is the same as that used by the L-800, 11.5 M3 (15 yd.3), front end loader. Specific performance and design features of the various systems are discussed. 800693. Incentives vs Demands in Off-Road Machinery Product Safety. K. L. Pfundstein, Product Safety Dept., Deere &amp; Co., Moline, IL. After 10 years of intense effort with product liability litigation and government regulations, this country has discovered that neither can be counted on to bring about a general reduction in personal injury accident rates. On the 99</page><page sequence="81">800721-800733 contrary, each in the name of safety, has imposed misdirected demands, has added to the injustice of hopelessly clogged court agendas, and has precipitated two more crises for the U.S. Congress. -These lessons are costly and inflationary, but perhaps worst of all, each has a destructive impact in the effort to build cooperation and credibility between government and the private sector. Improved safety and health must be a prime objective of private industry and government, but government's role has been seriously distorted through paternalism. -Gov- ernment must set realistic goals and then establish an incentive climate of reward and penalty in which the path to these goals is left primarily to the ingenuity of the private sector. A large part of this climate can come from a new code which focuses the moral and legal obligation of safety warning communications on manufacturers and users alike. 800721. Airline Efforts to Improve Airfield and Airspace Operations - Atlanta. D. Roger Ferguson, East- ern Air Lines, Inc. Atlanta Airport is a complicated airfield and airspace environment through which two of the major airlines operate complicated interconnecting schedule patterns. As the airport approaches saturation, it is incumbent on these airlines to take the lead role in designing a schedule product to maximize the performance of the Air Traffic Control (ATC) system. Concurrently, these airlines must have a partnership role with the ATC system in establish- ing airport operating strategies which allow their schedule patterns to function effectively. 800722. Allocation of Limited Airport Facilities to Im- prove Utilization in the Deregulation Environ- ment. Michael H. Callaway, Minneapolis/St. Paul Metropolitan Airports Commission. This paper discusses the ways in which airport facilities have been allocated among tenants and explores alter- native methods for renting facilities to users. It examines the situation at Minneapolis/St. Paul to determine if facilities are saturated currently. 800725. Aircraft Delays at Major U.S. Airports Can Be Reduced. Robert E. Levin, U.S. General Ac- counting Office. In 1977, aircraft delays cost U.S. airlines over $800 million; detained the traveling public over 60 million hours; and caused the airlines to use an additional 700 million gallons of fuel, over 8% of their total consumption. Most delays occur at major airports, which have peak, congested periods when air traffic exceeds runway capacity. To reduce delays, the U.S. General Accounting Office, in a 1979 report to the Congress, urged the use of peak surcharges, quotas, and reliever airports to shift air traffic from peak to off-peak hours or to other airports. 800726. FAA Order 1050.1C- What Is It? John Wesler, Federal Aviation Admin., Office of Environ- ment and Energy, Washington, D.C. Required consideration of potential environmental con- sequences of any major Federal action is a fact of life today. The Federal Aviation Administration has compiled those requirements associated with aviation programs into one document known as FAA Order 1050.1C, "Policies and Procedures for Considering Environmental Impacts," issued on December 20, 1979. This 115-page handbook provides under a single cover the necessary guidance for assessing the environmental impacts of agency programs, in order to comply with statutes and Executive Orders intended to protect the environment. 800730. The CFM56 - High Bypass Technology for Stan- dard Body Aircraft. Jean-Claude Malroux, CFM International. The fact that the CFM56 engine was designed for short flights means that the parts will be much less stressed for long flights resulting in low maintenance costs. In addition, it uses less fuel than current engines of the same thrust size. These factors coupled with the very quiet character- istic of the high bypass engine have made it a winner with the airlines, the regulatory authorities, and the commu- nities. 800731. Aerodynamic Development of the Engine Nacelle Combination for the Boeing 767 Airplane. Brian Neal, The Boeing Co. The aerodynamic development of the engine nacelle for the Boeing 767 airplane is described from configuration development model tests to FAA certification flight tests. Details of the inlet, nozzles and thrust reverser devel- opment in conjunction with the engine are discussed. 800732. Advanced Olympus for Next Generation Super- sonic Transport Aircraft. P. C. Gupta, Rolls- Royce Ltd., Aero Div., Bristol. The paper summarises the background studies which have led to the proposal for an advanced Olympus engine, with mechanical noise suppression, to power the next gener- ation supersonic transport aircraft. The recent interna- tional collaborative test programme on real engine scale ejector suppressors is described and reference is made to other Rolls-Royce experimental work at model scale. The envisaged changes to the design of the in-service Con- corde engine are outlined and some installation aspects are discussed. It is emphasised that detailed refinement of the engine cycle must depend on the result of air- craft/engine integration and optimisation studies. 1980 SA E Transactions 800733. Propfan Propulsion for Commercial Air Trans- ports. T. G. Coussens and R. H. Tullis, 100</page><page sequence="82">800734-800739 Lockheed-California Co., Burbank, CA. Incorporation of an advanced technology, high-speed turboprop propulsion system into future air transports can achieve significant reductions in operating costs through large reductions in fuel consumption. Today's turboprop systems exhibit propulsive efficiencies which are superior to current high bypass turbofans but are limited to lower cruise speeds, which are incompatible with market requirements and air traffic control environments. The propfan concept allows the superior propulsive efficiency of the turboprop to be extended to cruise speeds of the current turbofan aircraft. Fuel consumption and operating cost benefits are shown by comparison of a propfan and turbofan powered aircraft, each designed on an equal- technology and equal-mission basis. Projected 1990 time frame comparisons are also shpwn. The advantages of the propfan aircraft, in light of ever-increasing fuel shortages and fuel cost increases, have resulted in several NASA- sponsored research programs to verify propulsion per- formance and develop the required technology base. Continuation and escalation of these activities must be accomplished to ensure incorporation of the propfan into the next generation of commercial air transports. 1980 SA E Transactions 800734. General Aviation Operating Requirements for the 1980's. Gilbert F. Quinby, G. F. Quinby Asso- ciates, Fort Washington, PA. This paper presents a review of the use of the airspace and the air traffic control system. Safety, capacity and efficiency of this use under Visual Flight Rules (VFR) are compared with the evolving constraints imposed by operations under Instrument Flight Rules (IFR). The concept of Electronic Flight Rules (EFR) as developed by Topic Group III on Freedom of Airspace in the FAA's 1978-79 E &amp; D Initiatives Process is reviewed. The potential for conservation of air traffic control manpower and aircraft fuel is further developed. Promising areas for further technical exploration are noted. The paper concludes with some considerations for co-existence of VFR, IFR, and EFR traffic during a transition period. 800735. Electronic Flight Rules (EFR) - A Concept for Enhanced Freedom of Airspace. Paul R. Drouilhet, Massachusetts Institute of Technol- ogy, Lincoln Laboratory. A new control procedure for aircraft operations, termed Electronic Flight Rules (EFR), is proposed as a means of achieving the flexibility and cost advantages of Visual Flight Rules under instrument meteorological conditions. EFR depends on the electronic determination of relative aircraft position by ground-based or airborne equipment, and provides automatic assistance to pilots in resolving conflicts. When not in potentially conflicting situations, aircraft flight paths are not constrained by air traffic control. 800736. Potential Roles for the Cockpit Traffic Display in the Evolving ATC System. Harry A. Verstynen, FAA Langley, Engineering &amp; Development, Field Office. Many different roles have been postulated for the cockpit traffic display during the more than 30 years since its first proposal. Many years of research have shown that the concept may have significant potential for improving safety, capacity, and efficiency in the ATC system, but also may have potential for creating new problems in the process of resolving others. This paper reviews the dimensions of the CDTI problem and discusses some of the possible benefits and liabilities associated with various roles such a concept might serve in the evolutionary development of the future air traffic control system. 800737. UK Research on the Modern Transport Flight Deck and the Interaction With Air Traffic Control. R. R. Newbery and R. W. Jones, Royal Aircraft Establishment, Bedford UK. The paper describes a closely coordinated UK research programme involving Research Establishments and In- dustry in hardware design, simulator tests and flight trials to investigate the interfaces and interactions between Advanced Flight Systems, the Aircrew and Air Traffic Control. Reference is made to the work of the Royal Signals and Radar Establishment (RSRE) to describe developments in Air Traffic Management. Work in the UK on Flight Deck design has centered on the Advanced Flight Deck simulator at British Aerospace, Weybridge, and an example of their work is described. The flight test programme of the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) Bedford BAC 1-11 and its equipment fit are described, together with recent examples of area navigation accuracy achieved in flight using conventional ground aids. A future programme is discussed in which the integration of all these new system elements will be investigated. Some of the problems which will be addressed are discussed. 800739. Helicopters - A Solution to Urban Commercial Transportation Needs. Stanley R. Spector, Hughes Helicopters. The need for fast, safe, convenient, low cost urban transportation can be satisfied by a Helicopter Trans- portation System. A series of public-use heliports would be established around a metropolitan area to support frequent bus-type intracity operations of light turbine helicopters. Some of the heliports would also support intercity operations to relieve conventional airport surface and air traffic congestion. The Helicopter Transportation System is more cost-effective in providing quasi-rapid transit than competitive transportation alternatives. The helicopter has also become more compatible with urban requirements for safety and low noise to be regarded as an attractive alternate transportation mode for the city. Federal, state, regional and local government programs 101</page><page sequence="83">800740-800746 are required to establish the efficacy of urban helicopter transportation. 800740. Heliports and Helicopters - Where Have They Been and Are They Coming Back. William A. Stamer, Executive Helicopter, Inc. Urban heliports and commuter helicopters are no longer a dream of the future, but are in fact a reality. The Federal Aviation Administration must now accept this fact and change their thinking process from airports and airplanes to heliports and helicopters, due to this one difference: "An airplane lands and then stops, while a helicopter stops and then lands." 800741. The Potential Use of Helicopters in an Airline Role. Richard H. Laird, Offshore Logistics, Inc., Houston, TX. Market demands, technology, and legislation are favor- able towards the implementation of rotary wing aircraft employed in a commuter airlines role. However, composite materials, unit costs, noise, and passenger capability are serious drawbacks to economic viability of helicopter airlines. The acceptance and availability of urban heliports are important elements in the eventual success of employing helicopters in an airline role. 800742. Opportunities for Development of Future Heli- copter Operations. James R. Nelson, U.S. Dept. of Transportation Federal Aviation Admin., Washington, DC. The FAA's "Helicopter Operations Development Pro- gram" is striving to improve the National Airspace System so that helicopters can employ their unique capabilities efficiently. However, the helicopter's truly unique capa- bility is to fly slowly with no lower limit on airspeed. This capability is not yet developed for use during instrument flight. In addition, the capability can not be used to advantage until a suitable network of heliports is devel- oped. These are two opportunities for development that may yield significant benefits in the future. 800743. Aircraft of the Future. W. E. Parsons and J. A. Stern, Douglas Aircraft Company, McDonnell Douglas Corporation, Long Beach, California. It is anticipated that world passenger traffic will increase substantially from 1980 to 2000. Douglas Aircraft believes that the aircraft to satisfy this increased demand, as well as to replace aircraft that will be removed from service because of noise, high fuel consumption, and age, will be derivatives of currently operational aircraft and all new advanced-technology aircraft. Just as orderly evolutionary developments character- ized commercial aviation in the past, it is anticipated that until at least the 1990s commercial aviation will evolve in a similar manner. After the mid 1990s and in the early years of the next century, it is likely that aircraft such as the AST, a double-decked large subsonic airplane, and perhaps a large optimized cargo plane will be required to satisfy the demands for air transportation. Because of limited capacity at major hub airports, planning will be necessary to accommodate these future large airplanes if the full potential of the world airport system is to be utilized. 800744. Outlook for Advanced Concepts in Transport Aircraft. D. William Conner, NASA, Langley Research Center, Hampton, VA. Examination has been made in some detail of air transportation demand trends, air transportation system goals, and air transportation system trends well into Century 21. The outlook is for continued growth in both air passenger travel and airfreight movements. The present system, with some improvements, is expected to continue to the turn of the century and to utilize technologically upgraded, derivative versions of today's aircraft, plus possibly some new aircraft for supersonic long haul, short haul and high density commuter service. Severe constraints of the system, expected by early in Century 21, should lead to innovations at the airport, away from the airport, and in the air; and innovations are illustrated by descriptions of three candidate systems involving advanced aircraft concepts. Advanced technolo- gies and vehicles expected to impact the airport are illustrated by descriptions of laminar flow control aircraft, very large airfreighters and cryogenically fueled trans- ports. 800745. Energy Conservation in Terminal Airspace Through Fuel Consumption Modeling. David E. Winer and Charles J. Hoch, Federal Aviation Administration, Office of Environment and Energy, Washington, DC. Mathematical models are being developed by the Federal Aviation Administration to determine aircraft fuel con- sumption under a wide variety of operational conditions. These models are particularly needed to determine the effects of proposed changes to air traffic procedures. The models are described and examples are given for their use by analysts and policymakers. 800746. Estimation of Fuel Consumption of Commercial Jet Aircraft from Path Profile Data. Bela P. Collins, The MITRE Corp., McLean, VA. Increases in fuel prices over the last several years have presented the designers and operators of the Air Traffic Control (ATC) System with a unique challenge to provide a fuel efficient operating environment. After safety of flight, fuel conservation has become the next critical design requirement. This paper describes the development and validation of a capability for assessing the fuel consumption performance of existing and proposed changes to the ATC system. The capability makes use of the basic equations of conservation of energy, thereby 102</page><page sequence="84">800748-800756 permitting optimization analysis by the application of standard techniques. 800748. The Role of a Flight Management System in Terminal Airspace. Donald A. Moor, Lockheed Corp. To help solve the ever-increasing congestion in terminal airspace around our major cities, the Lockheed Corpo- ration, in conjunction with NASA, has embarked on development of advanced airborne avionics. This paper deals with the first phase of this program: adapting an existing L- 1011 Flight Management System for accurate timed descents (4-D Descents) to metering fixes in the terminal area. 800750. A Systems Approach to Airport Safety. Edmund J. Cantilli, The Institute for Safety in Trans- portation. Airports may be seen as self-contained systems composed of a number of sub-systems. By defining, in detail, the aspects, characteristics, and devices which comprise the overall system and its sub-systems, a detailed assessment may be made of the state of safety in all activities of an operating airport. Transportation system safety is defined as an approach and a body of analytical tools which provide a mainly preventive approach to increasing overall safety on airports. Through hazard identification and treatment unsafe conditions and practices can be uncovered and treated or eliminated before they cause or are involved in accidents. 800751. Land Use Factors and Airport Operations Safety. Gary D. Vest, United States Air Force. Land use factors in terms of hazard to flight and land users are important considerations in airport planning and operation. Techniques to identify and describe safety to flight criteria, accident potential, and noise exposure are available and have been used successfully throughout the United States. Operational safety and long term utility of airfields can be greatly enhanced by integrating these factors into an airfield plan that addresses both existing and future land use in the vicinity of airfields. 800752. Safety Considerations in the Design of Airport Improvements. Charles W. Profilēt, Reynolds, Smith and Hills, Inc. This paper presents the airport an interrelated system and discusses several safety considerations in the design of airport improvements. A number of practical design methods for enhancing the safety of passengers are developed. 800753. Operational Consideration for Safety During Airport Construction and Maintenance. Lawrence L. Smith, Hillsborough County Avi- ation Authority, Tampa International Airport. Safety requirements for work in airports must be devel- oped - often invented - with input regarding airport user characteristics. Construction or maintenance work that affects naviga- tional aids, guidance systems, or any portion of the airfield area, must be accomplished in a manner which will minimize confusion and difficulty in landing, takeoffs, and taxiing for both the pilot and the air traffic controller. Pertinent FAA advisory circulars are quoted and refe- renced. Specialized airport equipment and systems must be developed to improve safety. 800754. The Growing Age of Specialization in Air Trans- portation. Michael I. Grove, Lockheed-Califor- nia Co. There exists a growing trend within our industry to move in the direction of a mass market air transport system with emphasis on greater efficiency of equipment, capital, and energy. While satisfying the essential needs of the market majority the mass market approach compromises the needs of the more service oriented market. Such com- promises are changing the perception of the industry from service conscious to price conscious. It need not be either price or service - it can be both. Within resource limi- tations further specialization can produce satisfaction in both the lower fare mass market and the higher fare service market. In addition specialization carries with it the benefit for further product differentiation thus improving potential profitability in a highly competitive industry. 1 980 SA E Transactions 800755. The Future of Short-Haul Transport Aircraft. L. J. Williams, NASA-Ames Research Center. Recently, major economic and regulatory changes have occurred which have initiated shifts in short-haul airline service patterns and aircraft technology requirements. Faced with rapidly escalating fuel costs, larger airlines have begun to move their jet transports to longer, more profitable routes. The short-haul routes left by the larger airlines are being serviced by the rapidly growing commuter airlines, largely using small turboprop powered aircraft. The transition to more efficient aircraft for short-haul will continue and, in the future, most short-haul opera- tions will be performed by specialized propeller and rotor driven aircraft. This paper presents the results of some recent design studies of short-haul transport aircraft technology and provides illustrations of some potential future designs. 800756. Prospects for Hydrogen Aircraft. G. D. Brewer, Lockheed-California Co., Burbank, CA. The prospects for hydrogen-fueled transport aircraft are seen to be good. It is imperative that an alternate to Jet A be developed. This petroleum-base fuel currently used in commercial transports will become increasingly unavail- 103</page><page sequence="85">800758-800767 able and costly as the world's crude oil supply is depleted. Liquid hydrogen has been shown to be a very attractive candidate based on theory and analysis. A research and development program, currently being formulated, is needed to provide a practical basis forjudging the merits of LH2 in comparison with liquid methane and synthetic Jet A. 1980 SA E Transactions 800758. The FAA Satellite Airport Program. Robert J. Aaronson, Federal Aviation Administration. The Federal Aviation Administration's satellite airport program is aimed at reducing congestion and simplifying traffic at major air carrier airports by developing attrac- tive alternative (satellite) airports for use by general aviation. The initial $100 million program includes projects to increase the capacity of satellite airports and to install 24 instrument landing systems suitable for training activity. 800761. Allocating and Accommodating Small Aircraft Operations in the Baltimore-Washington Bi- Region. William J. Connors, Jr., Maryland Department of Transportation, BWI Airport, MD. Allocating aircraft demand in a high density terminal area relies heavily on a sound, systematic plan for facility use. Accommodation of the allocated or forecasted demand requires that facilities be adequately constructed and maintained. Revenue generation, capital investment monies and protection from encroachment by incom- patible, off-airport land uses are the primary concerns of the airport operator. Specific examples of providing or maintaining ade- quate facilities in the Bai timore- Washington Bi-region are given. 800762. Use of Separate Short Runways for Commuter and General Aviation Traffic at Major Airports. Agam N. Sinha, Air Transportation Systems Div., The MITRE Corp., McLean, VA; and Eugene S. Rehrig, Office of Systems Engrg. Management, Federal Aviation Administration, Washington, DC. The use of separate short runways for general aviation, commuter air carrier and air taxi operations, where possible, may provide increased airport capacity and hence reduced delays. These reduced delays would benefit the airport users through lower operating expenses. This paper presents a summary of the analysis to investigate the top 30 air carrier airports for the potential utilization of new or existing short runways under IFR conditions, and to estimate the potential IFR delay savings that would result from this use. 800763. Results from O'Hare Pavement Demonstration- Validation Study. Ernest J. Barenberg, Dept. of Civil Engrg., Univ. of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign. Deflection gages and Carlson elastic wire strain meters were installed in PCC concrete pavements at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. These instrumented pave- ments were then loaded with a combination of vibratory NDT and aircraft and strains and deflections in the pavement recorded. Partial results from these tests are presented along with results from a finite element analyses of these pavements and the results compared. Results show reasonably good agreement between measured and calculated deflections but measured strains were signif- icantly less than the calculated values. Significance of these results on design is discussed briefly. 800764. Prestressed Pavements for Airports. John L. Rice, Engrg. and Specifications Div. Federal Aviation Admin., Washington, DC. Prestressed concrete pavements for airports offer the potential for substantial savings in concrete materials. The design considerations and experience of the United States in prestressed pavements for airports is presented. 1980 SA E Transactions 800766. Past and Potential Near Term Fuel Savings in Commercial Aviation Through Modified Opera- tional Strategies. R. R. Covey, G. J. Mascetti and W. U. Roessler, The Aerospace Corp., El Segundo, CA; and R. L. Bowles, U.S. Dept. of Energy, Washington, DC. This paper presents a summarization of a detailed study of operational energy conservation strategies applicable to commercial aviation. In all, 47 operational strategies are examined for their potential fuel savings and their implementation status. In addition, the fuel economy improvement of airline operations attributable to the partial implementation of operational strategies is as- sessed relative to 1973, and potential near term fuel savings are totaled. Results indicate that operational strategies are currently yielding a 5 percent improvement in airline fuel economy, relative to 1973, and that a potential for another 7 to 10 percent improvement exists through the implementation of nine selected strategies. 800767. Comparison of Alternate Aviation Fuels. Eldred N. Cart, Jr., Exxon Research and Engineering Company, Florham Park, NJ. At some point in the future, the transportation system will have to start to use non-petroleum fuels. With the long lead times for the development of a new aircraft, it is important to consider the use of alternate fuels now. This paper covers a comparison of alternate fuels for aviation gas turbines in both subsonic and supersonic aircraft. It also addresses the economic comparison between up- grading future synthetic fuels to meet current hydrogen levels and modifying the jet engine to accept a fuel with a lower hydrogen content. 104</page><page sequence="86">800768-800774 800768. A Methodology for Long Range Prediction of Air Transportation. Mohammad B. Ayati, Engi- neering Systems Dept., Univ. of California, Los Angeles; and J. Morley English, School of Engineering and Applied Science, Univ. of California, Los Angeles. The purpose of a research study reported in this paper was to provide a framework and methodology for long term projection of demand for aviation fuels. It required a close examination of some of the fundamental problems of predicting long run futures. The approach taken includes two basic components. The first was a new technique for establishing the socioeconomic environment within which the future aviation industry is embedded. The concept utilized was a definition of an overall societal objective for the very long run future. Within a framework so defined, a set of scenarios by which the future will unfold are then written. These scenarios provide the determinants of the air transport industry operations and accordingly provide an assessment of future fuel requirements. The second part was the modeling of the industry in terms of an abstracted set of variables to represent the overall industry performance on a macro scale. The model was validated by testing the desired output variables from the model with historical data over the past decades. 800769. Future Aviation Fuels - The Petroleum Industry Responds to the Challenge. A. Lewis, Shell Research Ltd., Thornton Research Centre. The growth of air traffic continues whilst the supply of petroleum fuels is expected to become more difficult with different applications competing intensively for the available products. The choice of crude oils available for refining is restricted so that the flexibility of refineries to meet the demands for products with restrictive specifi- cations is reduced. In order to maximize the long-term supply of aviation fuel it is foreseen that alternative sources of liquid fuel will need to be developed as well as the employment of as wide a range as possible of a variety of petroleum crudes. In the paper, factors that may in some cases limit the quantity of appropriate fuels are reviewed, with a description of Research and Development activities directed towards investigating the possible relaxation of particular speci- fication items. Refinery patterns are increasingly being geared, by various conversion techniques, to the production of maximum quantities of distillate fuels at the expense of the heavier fractions of the crude oil. Whilst these distillates may be somewhat more aromatic and olefinic in character than aviation users have been used to hitherto, they can be treated by various methods involving the use of hydrogen to yield products meeting even the tightest specification; however the treatment cost is high and the product yield deficient. The effect of various hydrocarbon fractions and pure hydrocarbons on the combustion and low temperature properties of fuels has been investigated as well as their effects on the thermal stability of the fuels. The conclu- sions reached and deductions made in relation to aircraft and engine performance are described. The paper concludes with consideration of the prob- lems to be faced with fuels derived from alternative sources such as oil sands and shale oils and a reference to the potential financial and supply problems facing hydrogen as an aircraft fuel. 1980 SA E Transactions 800771. A New Technique to Evaluate Performance of Jet Fuel Filtration Equipment. Dale A. Young, Exxon Research and Engineering Co., Linden, NJ. A new jet fuel filtration monitoring system and technique is described which provides an assessment of the current performance and signals the end of the useful life of filter/separator and clay treatment elements. The need for such a system has long been recognized by the aircraft fueling industry to indicate when surface active agent type contaminants in jet fuels are no longer efficiently removed by clay treatment and/or interfere with the water coalescence function of the filter separator. The system, which has been developed and called a Filter Sides tream Sensor, operates on a sidestream with dynamic similarity to the main filter separator or clay vessel. It has been designed to provide a cumulative history of all factors which affect filter performance. Correlations between Filter Sidestream Sensor and main filter performance are provided together with data on the effects of surfactants - both natural and additive types, and the role played by water in coalescence deactivation. 1980 SA E Transactions 800773. Impact of Commuter Airlines on Airports. John W. Drake, Purdue University, School of Aero- nautics and Astronautics, West Lafayette, IN. The commuter carriers' key role is the provision of connecting service to hub airports. Aircraft departures at such airports to old destinations remain constant over time. The new departures are to new places such as those served by commuters. Thus, there is a need for airport capacity, both airside and landside, for such carriers. Their passengers are showing that they value their time and that they are willing to pay enough to create the capacity through a combination of aircraft, landing air, and runway improvements. Regulations should facilitate such improvements but not dictate them. 800774. An Analysis of Airport Authority Operating Costs. G. D. Gosling, University of California, Berkeley. This paper presents a comparative analysis of the operating costs incurred by the airport authority at a sample of U.S. large and medium hub airports. Sources of data on such costs are described and some difficulties in 105</page><page sequence="87">800775-800786 using these data for economic analysis arising from current airport accounting practices are discussed. The analysis addresses the effect on operating costs of such local circumstances as airport configuration, climate and recent improvement programs. The relation between operating costs and traffic is analyzed to investigate the nature and extent of economies of scale. 800775. Simulated Vortex Encounters by a Twin-Engine Commercial Transport Aircraft During Final Approach. Earl C. Hastings, Jr., NASA Langley Research Center; and Gerald L. Keyser, Jr., United States Air Force. Piloted simulations of encounters with vortices of various ages and degrees of attenuation were performed with the Visual Motion Simulator. In the simulations, a twin- engine, commercial transport on final approach encoun- tered the modeled vortices of a four-engine, wide-body, commercial transport. The data in this report show the effect of vortex age and ground effect on the severity of the initial upset, as well as the effect of the vortex encounters on the landing capability. 800780. Applications of Programmable Devices in Man- ufacturing. Elson Spangler, Pontiac Motor Di- vision, General Motors Corporation. A discussion of the use of Microprocessor based systems in manufacturing is presented in addition to the discussion of programmable devices with emphasis on the emergence and impact of the Microprocessor as a manufacturing process control and interface device. 800781. Development of a Low Drag Disc Brake System for Small Cars - AD Disc. Kazuhiko Aoki, Toshihiko Kimura and Mikinosuke Maeda, Akebono Brake Industry Co., Ltd., (Japan). In fist type of disc brakes, pin type sliding with boots to protect them is usually adopted for calipers. This has proven effective for preventing rusting in the northern part of the American continent and Europe. The recent tendency to improve the fuel economy is demanding reduced drag for disc brakes. In floating type disc brakes some amount of drag is inevitable, but in the AD brake we have been successful in reducing the torque to a minimum without adverse effects. Main points in reducing drag are: adoption of duplicate pins, anchor plate of high rigidity, various methods to insure parallel wear pattern of pad linings, selection of pad lining material, backing plate thickness and position of spigot holes, etc. Design details and results of laboratory and vehicle tests are explained. 800782. Disc Brake Linings - Analytical Study and Se- lection Criteria. Mohan N. Joshi, Hurst Per- formance, Inc. With the advances in automotive brake technology, an increasing attention is being focused on the singularly important element in the brake system - the linings. More and more time and money are being invested in the research and development of the friction materials. Hydraulic brake system regulations, the U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 105-75, and the European Economic Community Directive 71/320/EEC with its respective amendments have become effective since 1976 model year passenger cars. All these factors have con- tributed toward continuing studies and development in the disc brake linings. This paper highlights some of the most important characteristics of a friction material in general, and in a disc brake application in particular. Further, it shows how the topic of friction material properties be approached by an individual involved in design, development, testing, or marketing of the brake linings. Based upon the author's first-hand experience in this field, a "Friction Material Analysis Chart" has been developed, which summarizes the salient features associated with brake linings. From a practical standpoint, this chart (appended to the paper at its end) would be a valuable tool in the analysis and selection of a friction material for a brake application. 1980 SA E Transactions 800785. Lightweight Separate Function Calipers with All Aluminium Alloy Housings. D. Caplygin, Girlock (Mfg.) Pty. Ltd. An unusual design approach has been used to produce an unprecedentedly thin bridge section in an all aluminium disc brake caliper housing. This feature was employed in the Girlock Slimline Colette caliper making it the first production caliper having - a) separate members for the brake torque and clamp functions b) sealed lubricated slides c) low total weight d) the facility of using a larger diameter disc. 800786. Effects of Mixtures of Gasoline With Methanol and With Ethanol on Automotive Elastomers. Ismat A. Abu-Isa, General Motors Research Laboratories. Sixteen automotive elastomers were investigated in the methanol/gasoline system. The results show that although few elastomers are affected drastically by pure gasoline (e.g., natural rubber) and few by the pure methanol (e.g., Viton), most of the elastomers are severely affected by mixtures of the gasoline and methanol rather than the pure components. Results on the ethanol/gasoline system are similar to those of methanol except that the ethanol mixtures have slightly less severe effects. Only in the case of Viton a greatly reduced effect in the ethanol system was observed. In comparing the results of the different elastomers it was found that several of them swell less and retain more of the tensile strength after aging in alcohol/gasoline mixtures than nitrile. These elastomers include fluorocar- 106</page><page sequence="88">800787-800793 bon elastomers (Viton), fluorosilicone, polysulfide, F-70A polyether, polyepichlorohydrin homopolymer, and poly- ester urethane. 800787. High Performance Fuel Line for Emerging Au- tomotive Needs. B. Spoo, Commercial Chemicals Division, 3M, St. Paul, MN. A new composite automotive fuel line hose construction has been developed using a thin fluorocarbon "veneer" bonded to a hydrocarbon outer tube and cover. This report will discuss laboratory test data involving two such fluorocarbon compositions' resistance to permeation, "sour" gasoline attack and gasoline/alcohol blends. Lab data and preliminary field testing suggest this system will provide, in one hose construction, the answer for these three emerging automotive fuel line hose problem areas. 800788. Proposed Revisions in SAE 30R1 Fuel Hose Specification. Melvyn Gale, The Plumley Rub- ber Co. In 1974 the Federal Government issued a requirement that new cars would be required to use unleaded fuel beginning with the 1975 models. This mandatory use of unleaded fuel was the factor that changed the availability of an economic, universal fuel hose specification - SAE J30R1. The SAE Committee has been reviewing the require- ments of present day fuel hoses and taking into consid- eration the projected fuels to be used in vehicles. The fuels included gas extended with various alcohols, high and low aromatic content and their effects on the hoses. 800789. The Volume Increase of Fuel Handling Rubbers in Gasoline/ Alcohol Blends. A. Nersasian, E.I. Du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., Inc., Polymer Products Dept., Elastomers Lab, Wilmington, DE. The volume increase of fluorohydrocarbon, fluorosilicone, nitrile, epichlorohydrin homopolymer and copolymer rubbers has been determined by total immersion in high aromatic gasoline blended with methanol and ethanol at 21°C and 54°C. The methanol blends caused more swelling than the ethanol blends at equivalent alcohol concentrations over the range of 10 to 100 volume percent alcohol. In both fuel systems the highly fluorinated fluorohydrocarbon rubbers showed the best resistance to swelling. 800790. The Use of Toluene/Isooctane/Alcohol Blends to Simulate the Swelling Behavior of Rubbers in Gasoline/ Alcohol Fuels. A. Nersasian, E.I. Du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., Inc., Polymer Products Dept., Elastomers Lab, Wilmington, DE. The volume increase of fuel handling rubbers in gaso- line/alcohol blends can be simulated with considerable accuracy by using appropriate blends of toluene/isooctane/alcohol. This was achieved by allowing toluene to represent the aromatic content of the gasoline blend, isooctane the combined paraffinic, naphthenic and olefinic contents, and by matching the alcohol concen- trations. The swelling behavior of fluorohydrocarbon, fluorosilicone, nitrile and epichlorohydrin rubbers has been characterized by total immersion in a wide blend range of toluene/isooctane/alcohol and in toluene/isooctane/methyl tert.-butyl ether. 1980 SAE Transactions 800791. A Method for Predicting the Volume Increase of Fuel Handling Rubbers in Complex Fuel Blends. A. Nersasian, E.I. Du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., Inc., Polymer Products Dept., Elastomers Lab, Wilmington, DE. The use of toluene/isooctane/alcohol blends to simulate the swelling behavior of rubbers in alcohol blends has been reported recently. The Hildebrand blending rule was used to calculate the partial solubility parameters for a wide compositional range of toluene/isooctane/alcohol blends. Appropriate plots were prepared which define the swelling characteristics of fuel handling rubbers as a function of these parameters. These swell contours provide a method for predicting the volume increase of rubbers in complex fuels whose partial solubility param- eters have been calculated. 1980 SAE Transactions 800792. An Automotive Electronic Climate Control Heat- ing and Air Conditioning System. James P. Zunich and Philip R. Powell, General Motors Corp. The Cadillac Electronic Climate Control heating and air conditioning system provides automatic control of the passenger compartment temperature. It utilizes a micro- computer to control the operation of electrical, mechan- ical and vacuum components that regulate the amount and temperature of air delivered into the car to maintain the "customer set" comfort level. The first step in the evolution of this new system was to define the per- formance requirements. With this established, the system was then designed, tested and developed in the laboratory and on the road until this desired performance was achieved. 1980 SAE Transactions 800793. Electronic Replacement of Vacuum Controls in Automotive Climate Control Systems. F. D. Rubin, Buick Motor Div.; and R. A. Wilke, Lake Center Industries. This paper discusses an electronically controlled, electric servo control system for air conditioning and heater controls which is independent of vacuum, and engine operation. This new system uses electric motor driven actuators to position mode valves and the air blend valve through a microprocessor in the control panel. The microprocessor is preprogrammed to automati- 107</page><page sequence="89">800794-800798 cally regulate system operation and blower speeds. It also provides the capability to analyze actuator positions and wiring, and provides a positive go-no-go visual diagnostic signal if service is required. Introduction of electronics into the system provides capability of infinitely variable blower speed control, touch operation, and for additional unique performance features not possible with mechanical systems. 1980 SA E Transactions 800794. Controlling Engine Load by Means of Late Intake-Valve Closing. James H. Tuttle, Engine Research Dept., General Motors Research Lab- oratories, Warren, MI. Varying the timing of intake-valve closing was examined on a single-cylinder engine as a means for controlling the load of a homogeneous-charge spark-ignition engine. The engine was operated unthrottled, with load control obtained by holding the intake valve open during a portion of the compression stroke. This allowed the piston to push part of the cylinder charge back into the intake manifold. Results showed that to achieve the range of load control required for vehicular operation, late intake-valve closing would have to be combined with variable-density throttling. Comparisons to a conventional engine showed the late intake-valve-closing engine to have (1) lower pumping losses, (2) lower specific fuel consumption, (3) lower nitric oxide emissions, and (4) similar HC emissions. However, the fuel-economy benefit offered by this load-control concept would be reduced by the frictional losses of a control mechanism. The current trend toward lower vehicular power/weight ratios also would diminish the impetus for this approach. 1980 SA E Transactions 800795. Automobile Braking Energy, Acceleration and Speed in City Traffic. Paul Wasielewski, Leonard Evans and Man-Feng Chang, General Motors Research Laboratories. Speed-time data obtained in two large-scale studies by following randomly selected vehicles in a number of cities with an instrumented car are analyzed here by dividing the data into trip segments between successive stops and computing values of traffic variables for the individual trip segments. Results from the two studies are found to be in good agreement. The analysis focuses on variables previously shown to be related to fuel consumption, particularly on the relationship between energy used to accelerate the vehicle, energy dissipated in braking, and mean traffic speed. Braking and acceleration are found to play a major role in determining tractive energy require- ments in low speed urban driving, since about half the energy supplied to the wheels is used to accelerate the vehicle, and about two-thirds of the resulting kinetic energy is dissipated in braking. The amount of energy dissipated in braking is largely determined by the energy used to accelerate the vehicle, suggesting that drivers do not currently reduce braking in order to save fuel. Traffic characteristics in different metropolitan areas are com- pared based on the computer traffic variables. Accel- eration distributions at different speeds are computed. 800796. Adaptation of the Engine to the Vehicle. Georges P. Desjardins, Renault Products Dept., Régie Nationale des Usines Renault, (Billancourt). The majority of methods which optimize the power plant to automobiles utilize on one hand vehicle test-run simulation programs, and on the other hand optimization programs. This paper proposes more synthetic techniques which use operational characteristics proper to the engine and to the vehicle. This adaptation always promotes the utilization of the longest ratio and improves the mechanical efficiency of the engine. These techniques show clearly the different reasons of losses, and where they happen. It prevents also the utilization of unoptimized components to build a complete vehicle. Maximal speed and accelerations determine the displacement of the engine and the ratio of the fourth gear. The starting uphill performances determine the longest first ratio. The second and third gears are inserted within. The consumption or the performances of this vehicle can be then evaluated in advance. 800797. The New Renault 2 Liter 4 Cylinder Diesel Engine. J. J. His, Régie Nationale Des Usines Renault. The Renault passenger car division has just unveiled a new version of its popular R20 family sedan, fitted with an all new 2 liter Diesel engine. This new 4 cylinder in line Diesel engine was designed and developed with reliability, lightweight and compactness, low noise level and high torque as major targets. It features an aluminium crank-case, a new type of cylinder liners, an aluminium cylinder head with an overhead camshaft driven by a toothed belt, a new type of swirl chamber, a nodular cast iron crankshaft. For the passenger car version, power output is 49 kW (DIN) at 4500 RPM (without fan) and torque is 127 Nm (94 lbft) at 2250 RPM. The complete engine weighs 160 kg (350 lbs). Its dimensions remain very close to those of our compact 2 liter gas-engine. This new Diesel engine will power various passenger cars and light-duty vans in the near future. This paper describes the main design, development and performance features of this new engine, as well as some special manufacturing means which were developed for the Renault 2 liter Diesel. 800798.

Hiroshi Kawase, Furukawa Al- uminium Co., Ltd.; and Takakazu Tanaka, Furukawa Aluminum Co., Ltd. 7072 alelad sheet has long been applied for aluminum heat exchanger components because of the excellent cathodic protection. However, the sacrificial anode effect of 7072 cladding would be impaired by zinc sublimation during vacuum brazing cycles. This paper describes the effect of additional calcium to 7072 cladding on zinc sublimation in vacuum brazed alelad sheet. For lighter gauge (0.4 mm), 7072 cladding does not provide adequate retained zinc after vacuum brazing, but 7072 cladding with calcium will have sufficient retained zinc to afford galvanic protection to the core. 1980 SA E Transactions 800800. A Rapid Method to Predict the Effectiveness of Inhibited Engine Coolants in Aluminum Heat Exchangers. R. R. Wiggle and V. Hospadaruk, Ford Motor Co. The galvanostatic polarization method was used to determine the pitting potentials of candidate wrought aluminum alloys in inhibited ethylene glycol engine coolants. It was shown that the relative value of the pitting potential is an excellent measure of the long-term effectiveness of the coolants in preventing spontaneous pitting and crevice attack in the aluminum heat exchangers. The long-term effectiveness was determined by metallographic examination of aluminum heat exchangers subjected to a four-month, 50,000 mile simulated service circulation test. 1980 SA E Transactions 800801. The Influences of Deformation Mode and Heat Treatment on Post-Formed Tensile Properties of 6009 Aluminum Sheet. R. S. Bogan, Carnegie- Mellon University; and H. R. Piehler, Duke University. This study looked at the effects of cold deformation, sample orientation, and artificial aging (paint cure simulation) after forming on the tensile properties of 6009 aluminum sheet of two thicknesses, 0.035 in (0.889 mm) and 0.071 in (1.80 mm). Three modes of deformation were imposed; cold rolling, simple tension, and die compres- sion. Test results indicated that the post-formed tensile properties were strongly influenced by deformation mode, sample orientation, sheet thickness, and artificial aging. Die compression produced tensile strengths of 67 ± 4 ksi (462 ± 28 MPa); by contrast cold rolled samples tested parallel to the rolling direction had tensile strengths of 31 ± 3 ksi (213 ± 21 MPa). Artificial aging increased strength in all deformation modes and exacerbated the deformation mode anisotropy of strength values. 800802. An Aluminum Automobile Structure To Absorb Impact. Bruce Tyndall, Bruce Tyndall Associates and University of New Haven. An aluminum automobile safety frame has been the main feature of this extensive, basic research project. Earlier papers have covered the logistics of the whole, plus certain specialized results in the mathematical background. This paper describes the problems of desig'n and construction of the lightweight frame structure for a research vehicle. Parameters of alloy selection, central strength, potential impact absorption, and frame junction methods are emphasized. Also discussed are future modifications to carry forward basic research to lead to eventual mass production planning. Conclusions point to the enhanced prospects for the future of greater safety in energy efficient automobiles. 800803. Weight Reduction Potential of Passenger Cars and Light Trucks by Material Substitution. Hsi-Sheng Hsia and James A. Kidd, Dept. of Transportation, Research and Special Programs Administration, Transportation Systems Center, Cambridge, MA. This paper describes a study conducted to evaluate the potential of weight reduction by material substitution for passenger cars and light trucks. Production vehicles considered to be optimally de- signed for a given functional size are selected as baseline vehicles for the study. The component weight and material of these baseline vehicles are obtained through vehicle teardown. To simplify the analysis, components which are selected for the material substitution analysis are grouped by their geometrical form into panel mem- bers, thin-walled beam members, and solid section members. Four alternative materials are used in the analysis. These include high strength steels (HSS), aluminum alloys, fiberglass reinforced plastics (FRP), and hybrid reinforced plastics (HRP). The analysis is carried out for four cases of material substitution: the HSS dominant case, the FRP dominant case, the aluminum dominant case, and the HRP dominant case. Applying equal stiffness as the structural requirement, weight savings by direct material substitution are com- puted for each baseline vehicle. Results show that primary weight reduction in the range of 10 to 33 percent of original curb weight is possible with direct material substitution. 109</page><page sequence="91">800804-800816 800804. Development of a Laboratory Axle Efficiency Test. Douglas C. Porrett and Stephen D. Miles, Ford Motor Co.; Edward F. Werderits and Donald L. Powell, AutoResearch Laboratories, Inc. A laboratory axle efficiency test using a torque sweep method has been developed. Vehicle test limitations, previous axle efficiency tests and origin of current test are discussed. Test development, equipment and importance of technique are presented. Correlation with vehicle tests is shown and usefulness of data for evaluating lubricant and axle design changes is discussed. An evaluation of test results shows that the torque sweep method has the capability of identifying changes that may not show with vehicle tests. 800812. Thickness Effects on Material Properties in a Glass/Thermoplastic P.E.T. Injection Molding Compound. Robert C. Wetherhold, William A. Dick and R. Byron Pipes, Center for Composite Materials, Univ. of Delaware, Newark, DE. Rynite® 545, a commercial short glass fiber/thermoplastic polyethylene terepthalate system, was injection molded into end-gated rectangular plaques of various thicknesses. The plaques were sectioned and characterized by scanning electron microscopy and by mechanical and thermal expansion tests. The glass fibers are shown to be highly aligned in "boundary layers" near the mold surfaces, and are distributed more randomly away from the mold surfaces. As part thickness increased, the aligned fiber boundary layers occupied a smaller proportion of the cross section, resulting in a decrease in mechanical properties. Tensile moduli are derived for boundary and center layers, which can be used to accurately predict the effective moduli at different thicknesses. In addition, the boundary layer thicknesses at the top and bottom surfaces were unequal, producing noticeable warping for thicker plaques. 800813. The Use of Plastics on European Cars - an Update. Hermann Hablitzel and Klaus-D. Johnke, Volkswagen werk AG (Germany). In recent years thanks to the continuous improvements in production techniques the use of high polymers - plasto- mers, duromers, elastomers - has found ever-increasing justification in automobile design in Europe. The im- proved comfort of vehicle interiors, the reduction in weight of the automobiles and the associated energy savings, which the use of such materials guarantees, will continue to remain a powerful sales argument favouring the use of plastics despite the recent price increases. The revised situation in the energy and raw material sectors, coupled with the growing desire for comfort and simpler operation, as well as new safety and statutory regulations, have forced the motor industry to consider the use of a wider range of materials. Most of the plastics used at the moment can be found inside the vehicle. Future percentage growth rates in the high polymer field will, however, be concentrated on those plastics which will find use in the coachwork and external car components. This will lead to reductions in the weight of the cars themselves and contribute towards reducing the number of parts subject to corrosion. It is also clear that use of plastics does not always result in a reduction of vehicle weight, but nevertheless represents the best potential solution to a problem in terms of the minimum proportion of weight. For the future, however, plastics demonstrate far more important properties than simply that of being lighter than other materials. They are being increasingly used today in automobile design for other reasons. 800814. Plastics for Weight Reduction: Glass/Mineral Reinforced Resins for Body Panels. W. B. Glenn, E.I. DuPont de Nemours and Company, Inc. The prospects for increased use of plastic auto body panels for weight reduction are considerably brighter as we enter the 1980s. Auto manufacturers and plastic suppliers have a clear idea of the requirements which include: smooth surface, low warpage, predictable shrinkage, dimensional stability at high paint bake oven temperatures, solvent resistance, and most importantly, low cost. Considerable progress is being made in both materials and processing technology to achieve these goals. 800815. New Engineering Thermoplastic Resins Based on Polybutylene Terephthalate. J. J. Charles, R. C. Gasman and R. D. Sudduth, GAF Corp., Wayne, NJ. Gafite® LW molding compounds are impact modified, mica/glass reinforced PBT's (polybutylene terephthalate). They will meet a variety of design and molding criteria for such components as side and rear panels, louvres, deck lids and fender extensions, and are also of interest in other industries where low warpage characteristics are desired. The Gafite® LW polyester compounds essentially eliminate out of mold warpage while offering greater mechanical strength, resistance to environmental aging, resistance to high humidity, resistance to automotive fluids and lower sensitivity to regrind at comparable warpage than the conventional mineral filled nylon systems currently used for exterior automotive parts. Key advantages of Grafite® LW compounds over conventional PBT and mineral filled nylons will be discussed in depth. 800816. High Performance Resin Technology for Struc- tural Automotive Applications. Fred J. Howa- tineck, James A. Reitz, III and Joseph Feltzin, ICI Americas Inc., Woodbury, NJ. In 1978 ICI Americas first introduced a family of high performance resins and a unique urethane thickening process for the production of structural grade SMC. A 110</page><page sequence="92">800817-800824 review of the benefits and advantages of this technology in relation to structural automotive applications is given. Emphasis is given to both the characteristics of the performance resins and the novel urethane thickening process. The suitability and desirability of utilizing these materials as light-weight replacement materials for struc- tural automotive uses is explored in regard to their toughness, fatigue and retention of properties at non- ambient temperatures. Actual field experience will be used to summarize the usefulness of these materials in struc- tural automotive applications. 800817. A Light-Weight Bumper System Utilizing Azdel® Glass Fiber Reinforced Thermoplastic Laminate. Robert D. Campbell, PPG Industries, Inc. Automotive design efforts to resolve the conflict imposed by Federal regulations governing Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) and the inherent weight penalty of FMVSS-215 Bumper Standards have centered around light-weight material substitutions, most notably HSLA steels and aluminum. Recent developments in non- metallic structures are directed at further reduction in the weight penalties of steel and the cost penalties of aluminum. This study presents the investigation of a continuous glass fiber reinforced thermoplastic in a light-weight, energy-absorbing bumper system through its design, fabrication and successful prototype testing. Material properties, design parameters, molding process and vehicle impact testing will be reviewed. 800818. Serviceability in Design. T. W. Johnson, Service Development Center, General Motors Corpo- ration. Serviceability's goal of minimizing the cost of repairs to cars can only be attained with designing and engineering help. Products must conform to existing field capabilities and limitations if the Service Industry is to be expected to perform proper repairs. Innovation is needed in design to make it possible to easily diagnose and repair the rapidly developing, very complex devices on cars of the future. 800819. Portable Multi-Mode Analyser for Electronic Ignition. M. J. Walker, Lucas Electrical, Ltd. Faults in electronic ignition systems are difficult to diagnose, particularly when the fault shows itself as a misfire rather than as complete ignition failure. An instrument has been developed which will detect misfires and intermittent faults on a running engine and may be used when a vehicle is being driven. 800820. Oil Consumption Complaint Verification/Diag- nosis. John M. Sawruk, General Motors Corp. Simple diagnostic techniques exist which allow verifi- cation/diagnosis of gasoline fueled, piston engine oil consumption. Use of these techniques can improve customer satisfaction, allow first time correction of the discrepancy, and reduce repair time and cost. 800821. Evaluation of a Low Sulfate Emission Control System. Melvin N. Ingalls, Southwest Research Institute; and Robert I. Bruetsch, U.S. Envi- ronmental Protection Agency. The possibility of high sulfate emissions from future emission control systems prompted an evaluation of a low sulfate system designed to meet 1981 emission standards. An air injected oxidation catalyst was added to a Volvo "Lambda-Sond" emission control system. After baseline determination of gaseous and sulfate emissions, the air injection system was modified to reduce sulfates. Optimi- zation tests determined the best air injection schedule for sufficient CO control while limiting sulfate production. A sulfate reduction of 99 percent was achieved. The system was then durability tested for 64,400 km. 800822. Characterization of Exhaust Emissions from Passenger Cars Equipped with Three-Way Cat- alyst Control Systems. Lawrence R. Smith, Southwest Research Institute; and Frank M. Black, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. This paper describes the effort to characterize regulated and unregulated exhaust emissions from four gasoline powered passenger cars equipped with three-way catalyst control systems. The vehicles have been evaluated over four test cycles, with three fuels at four mileage accu- mulation points. In addition to the currently regulated automobile emissions, exhaust emission components measured include: sulfate, aldehydes, ammonia, sulfur dioxide, cyanide, and several other compounds. From the standpoint of toxicity, the most significant emissions from three-way catalyst systems are the currently regulated emissions, followed to a lesser degree by the sulfate emissions. 1980 SA E Transactions 800823. Exhaust Emissions from In-Use Passenger Cars Equipped with Three-Way Catalysts. John T. White, III, Gary T. Jones and Daniel J. Niemczak, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. This paper presents the results of an exhaust emission testing program conducted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The test vehicles were 1978-1980 passenger cars of various makes and models. Each of the 686 vehicles tested was equipped with a three-way catalyst system and was certified to California standards. The purpose of the program was to gather information on current systems in customer use for projections on the ability of the three-way system to meet emission standards of the future. The results indicate that these systems are capable of achieving low emission levels although high levels are also possible due to defects, deterioration, or tampering. 800824. Venturi Vacuum Transducer Enables Heavy EGR Control. Shunichi Aoyama and Yoshimasa 111</page><page sequence="93">800825-800829 Hayashi, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. In order to significantly reduce NOx levels by EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation), while maintaining good fuel economy and driveability, the EGR flow rate must be properly and accurately controlled under a variety of engine operating conditions. Toward this objective, a new EGR control system was developed. It utilizes a carburetor venturi vacuum for a stable reference signal that represents the engine operating condition and it controls the EGR flow rate by using a feedback principle to obtain sufficient flexibility com- patible with several different engines. Its control char- acteristics were mathematically analyzed. And it has also been confirmed that the system can automatically com- pensate for the drift in EGR characteristics. This EGR control system has been utilized in Nissan's emission control systems in order to comply with the 1978 Japanese Emission Standards and the 1980 U.S. Federal and California Emission Standards. 800825. Digital Engine Controller. Masaharu Asano, Akio Hosaka, Tamotsu Tominaga and Mitsu- hiko Ezoe, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. An electronic engine control system that uses a microcom- puter has been developed. It combines four control systems - fuel injection, ignition timing, EGR and idle speed control - utilizing the engine speed and intake air quantity for its main parameters. The control circuit is composed of an 8-bit microcom- puter combining an 8k byte ROM, RAM, a custom designed input/output LSI, and two hybrid integrated circuits, one has voltage regulators and another has input/output interface circuits. The control program consists of a main program, a fail-safe program for noise protection and a check program for diagnostic functions. The main program uses interrupt techniques to control effectively the four items by one microcomputer. The interrupt requests occur from crankshaft position signal and interval timer signals. 800826. A Closed-Loop A/F Control Model for Internal Combustion Engines. Douglas R. Hamburg and Michael A. Shulman, Ford Motor Co. A mathematical model is developed which describes the operation of an A/F control system containing an engine, an exhaust gas oxygen sensor, and a feedback controller. The dependence of model parameters on engine operating conditions is discussed and the model is used to compare integral and proportional/integral control algorithms. Actual data obtained on an engine-dynamometer are presented to test the validity of the model. 1980 SA E Transactions 800827. Total Gas/Effective Fuel Ratio Predicts Coast Surge in Emission-Control Vehicles. Shinichi Nagumo, Yasuo Nakajima and Yoshifumi Hase, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. In the course of developing a low-emission manual transmission vehicle, coast surge in the fore-and-aft direction resulting from the installation of certain emis- sion-control devices was sometimes experienced immedi- ately after the initiation of vehicle deceleration. Our investigation revealed that this vehicle surge was caused by combustion irregularities in a sequence of combustion-misfire-intense combustion events occurring every several cycles. A new combustibility standard. Gt/Feff, defined as the ratio of total cylinder mixture weight Gt to effective fuel weight Feff, was found to predict combustibility and irregular combustion over the entire mixture range. As a result, driveability during deceleration was improved by modifying key emission-control components. 800828. Optimal Substitution of Lightweight Materials in Automobiles. David Reid and Peter Stevenson, ECON, Inc. Development of lightweight materials has provided the automotive industry with numerous possibilities for vehicle weight reduction. The usage of these materials will depend upon their economic feasibility as well as their material properties. Often, managers will compute the penalty-per-pound saved in a given application for a number of competing materials to determine which is cost-effective. However, this method has limited useful- ness in larger dimensioned problems where an overall weight requirement is to be met by employing a large number of candidate materials in any number of com- ponent applications. When there are several component- material combinations under simultaneous consideration, attention should focus on; (1) which set of materials minimize total cost while meeting a particular weight constraint and; (2) how the solution set of materials changes as the weight constraint is varied. This paper presents a relatively simple technique useful for determining the most economically attractive materials mix given the weights and costs of all material- component combinations and an overall weight target. The technique has been applied to a production mid-sized vehicle to obtain optimal material mixes for 26 structural components. The competing materials include mild steel, aluminum, high strength low alloy steel (HSLA), E-glass and five different graphite reinforced plastic hybrids. A computer program was developed to perform the nec- essary calculations. The results of several cases are presented and analyzed. 800829. The Development of Weight-Reduced Vehicles Perceived by Renault. P. Ventre, Renault USA, Inc.; J. F. De Andria and J. C. Rullier, Regie Nationale des Usines Renault. This report is divided into three parts. 112</page><page sequence="94">800830-800835 The first part concerns the expected effects of vehicle weight reduction upon consumption. In the second part the positive or negative implications of weight-reduction upon vehicle equipment are listed. In the third part an approach is presented which makes it possible to define objectives as well as results in certain areas. 800830. An Estimate of Automobile Weight Propagation Factors for the Post-1985 Fleet. Stephen Luchter, National Highway Traffic Safety Administra- tion. It is well known that as the weight of some automobile subsystems is reduced, there is the potential for further reduction in total weight. In preparing an estimate of automobile fuel economy in the post- 1985 period, it became necessary to estimate approximate overall weight propagation factors suitable for such an analysis. The derivation of the factors is based on separating total automobile weight into weight sensitive and weight insensitive parts, and developing regression equations for the weight sensitive part. The data used to develop the regression equations were taken from the literature on weight propagation, and from National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) sponsored vehicle tear- down studies. Two factors were determined, one for a totally new vehicle, and another for upgrading an existing design. 800831. Extenders and Diluents for Middle Distillates - A Preliminary Evaluation. R. Bertodo, Dexion Ltd. (England). Recent studies have demonstrated that conventional compression-ignition engines, with fairly minor changes, can operate on lower grade fuel oils. The present paper outlines some experiences with middle distillates adul- terated with readily available organic liquids as a means of increasing the overall inventory and thereby extending the availability of natural crudes. It is shown that 25% substitution with various shale, coal or vegetation derived products is normally feasible. In some instances it was possible to operate totally on the alternate fuel. This total substitution is not economically viable at present, however, since extenders and diluents tested were up to one order of magnitude more expensive than conventional fuels. The greatest advantage accrued by combining the widest cut fuel oil obtainable with the highest C/H ratio diluent tolerated by the engine. Under these conditions the effective mileage gain for each barrel of crude oil could exceed 35% for a cost penalty of some $2/barrel. The shift in overall C/H ratio generated by dilution constrained smoke-limited power. Exhaust analyses, as a result, showed a conflict between energy conservation and environmental protection needs with regards to carbon monoxide and particulates emissions. The overall energy conversion efficiency was crucially dependent upon the prime mover chosen and overall results in the range 4 - 30% were estimated. Limited reliability and durability data of engines operating on diluted fuels is presented. 800832. Study on Spark Plug Carbon Fouling. Y. Kim- bara and Y. Noguchi, Toyota Motor Co., Ltd.; and T. Ishiguro, Toyota Central R&amp;D Labo- ratory Inc. For the purpose of elucidating the fouling mechanism, the structures and the properties of the deposit were inves- tigated mainly by using X-ray and electron microscopic techniques. We found that the deposit mainly consists of a graphitic carbon black with highly dense network struc- ture when the insulation resistance of the spark plug was indicating extremely small value, (e.g. below IMß) The cause of the graphitization under low ambient air temperature condition was considered as follows. 1) Catalyzation by transitional metals including iron and/or nickel 2) Sparking energy transferred through the carbon deposit Further carbon depositing processes were observed by several dynamic analyzers such as high speed flame pictures. The results of these analyses show that carbon formation and deposition processes on the spark plug are due to the flame behavior in the "plug pocket" (a space between counter-bore and ceramic insulator), and drop- ping of the insulation resistance value is caused by many kinds of ions contained in the carbon deposit. 1980 SA E Transactions 800833. Knock Detector System Controlling Turbochar- ger Boost Pressure. Per Gillbrand, Saab-Scania AB (Sweden). In order to improve fuel economy and available power, a knock detector system has been developed which controls the maximum charge pressure in the Saab 2-litre Otto Cycle Turbo engine. Compared to ignition retard knock control, the charge pressure control offers advantages in tolerance to varia- tions in fuel octane number, full throttle fuel economy, hot spot auto ignition control, exhaust gas temperature and sensitivity to electrical noise and interference. Further, the system allows a significant temporary increase in available engine power when accelerating in normal traffic conditions. The turbocharger wastegate setting for maximum charge pressure is achieved through an integrated elec- tronic system. The charge pressure knock control system is to a great extent "fail-safe". 800835. Some Analysis of Gyroidal Effect and the Devel- opment of a Flywheel Powered Vehicle. Hide- yuki, Otaki, Agency of Industrial Science and 113</page><page sequence="95">800836-800842 Technology, Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Japan). Feasibility studies have shown that a flywheel powered vehicle will increase fuel economy under the city driving. So, some designs of drive train system which has high efficiency and can regenerate braking energy by a flywheel storage unit have been contrived. But, far from it, the most interesting subject to take up first in developing flywheel powered vehicle is the analysis concerning to the gyroidal effect affecting to vehicle's motions and dura- bility of equipments. The author has analyzed theoretically how the gy- roidal effect has influence on vehicle's motions in cases of bouncing, braking and cornering. Next, the author has built a proto type flywheel powered vehicle on this analytical basis and check the dynamic behavior predicted by the theory and obtain some preliminary road per- formance data. 1980 SA E Transactions 800836. Prediction of Driving Traction Performance on Snow. Thomas R. Nesbitt, Tire Wheel Systems, General Motors Proving Grounds; and Donald J. Barron, Product Test Development, General Motors Proving Grounds. The amount of performance testing required to evaluate tire snow traction performance is substantial. This could be reduced through the use of a snow traction prediction equation to screen tire tread designs. The development of such an equation using five geometric tread properties is described. Simplified versions of this equation are also developed and checked against tires of known snow traction performance. These equations provide an objec- tive method for estimating the snow traction potential of a tread design. 1980 SA E Transactions 800837. European Winter Tire Testing. J. V. Kneip, A. F. Derooy and G. J. Kind, Goodyear Inter- national Tire Technical Center (Luxembourg). Winter tire testing in Europe, from the snowy passes of the Alps to the ice and cold of Scandinavia, is described. Methodology of evaluation and how it has evolved is examined. The continuing need for a winter tire to supplement summer tire performance is explored. The future of winter tires is discussed from the standpoint of service requirements and government regulations. 800838. Winter Tire Testing. J. B. Davis, J. R. Wild and N. W. St. John, BF Goodrich Co. The performance of winter tires is characterized by snow traction and ice skid tests. Winter tire testing is reviewed in regards to the hardware used, design of a test program, site selection, and data analysis. The description of the hardware includes a review of a new traction meas- urement system. The system incorporates a traction truck with an instrumented axle at a driven wheel position interfaced with a mini-computer which controls the test, stores the measurements, and performs the data analysis. 800839. Tire Traction Testing in the Winter Environment. William R. Janowski, DataMotive, Inc. Winter environment traction testing of passenger car and truck tires has increased in significance with the advent of greater consumer awareness and potential government regulation. This paper reviews reasons for testing and the engineering techniques currently used. Test course prep- aration for both snow and ice surfaces are discussed. Typical instrumentation and data acquisition systems are presented as are various means of analyzing data. The paper concludes with recommendations for standardizing test methodology to improve the effectiveness and usefulness of tire testing in the winter environment. 1980 SA E Transactions 800840. An Engineering Safety Analysis of the Steel Belted Radial Tire. Roger L. McCarthy, Failure Analysis Associates. Recent highly publicized recalls of radial tires brought about by the National Highway Traffic Safety Admin- istration (NHTSA) raise a question as to the reliability of steel belted radial tire technology. The risk posed by such tires will be examined in the context of changing tire technologies, and their positive safety impact will be discussed in connection with the recently recalled Fire- stone "500" steel belted radial tire. 800841. Mathematical Models for Catalytic Converter Performance. Norman C. Otto and William J. LeGray, Ford Motor Co. Mathematical models which can aid in the design of monolithic oxidation catalyst systems are described. The chemistry math model allows prediction of tailpipe CO and HC emissions throughout the course of the Federal Test Procedure. Following a brief description of the model and its required inputs, several examples of model applications are presented. In these, the effects on emissions of several design variables are determined. The pressure drop model allows evaluation of system back- pressure under steady flow conditions. Its use is illustrated by a parametric study of backpressure as a function of flow rate, substrate cell density and length. 800842. Aging of Pelleted and Monolithic Automotive Emission Control Catalysts. J. C. Summers and C. E. Thompson, Engelhard Industries Division, Engelhard Minerals &amp; Chemicals Corporation, Menlo Park, NJ. Experimental dual bed pelleted and monolithic auto- motive emission control catalysts were prepared and aged on an engine-dynamometer under identical conditions. The catalysts contained the same noble metal loadings and had the same noble metal ratios. The warmed-up conversion performance was obtained 114</page><page sequence="96">800843-800848 for both the front bed catalyst . only and for the two catalyst beds in combination. The contaminant pickups and penetrations into the pellets were also measured. 1980 SA E Transactions 800843. Development of Thermal-Resistant Rhodium Cat- alysts. H. K. Stepien, W. B. Williamson and H. S. Gandhi, Engineering and Research Staff, Ford Motor Co. Rhodium supported catalysts capable of withstanding temperatures above 600°C under oxidizing conditions while maintaining a resistance to chemical poisons have been developed by reducing the undesirable interaction of Rh203 with y-alumina support material. The impregnation of Rh on a zirconia (Zr02) washcoat provides a well dispersed, thermally-stable active phase. When the Rh/Zr02 phase is in turn supported on a high surface area y-Al203 washcoated monolith, the resulting [Rh/Zr02]/y- A1203 catalyst also has sufficient surface area for disper- sion of other active metals, as well as to provide a sink for fuel- and oil-derived contaminants. Upon heating at 850°C in air, the Rh area is decreased by 95% when supported on y-Al203, but is lowered only by 15% when Zr02 is used to separate Rh from y-Al203. The [Rh/Zr02]/y-Al203 catalyst maintains significant nitric oxide, carbon monoxide, and hydrocarbon activity after thermal treatment at 1100°C in air, while under identical conditions the Rh/y-Al203 catalyst is severely deactivated. The [Rh/Zr02]/y-Al203 catalyst maintains substantially better durability than Rh/y-Al203 in a simulated exhaust environment at peak temperatures of 950°C with excess oxygen. At comparable surface areas, the [Rh/Zr02]/y- A1203 catalyst is as resistant . to lead poisoning as Rh/y-Al203, and both are more durable than Rh sup- ported on low surface area a = Al203. 800844. Prediction of Relative Poison Sensitivities of Conventional and Filleted Monolithic Automotive Catalysts. George R. Lester and Richard E. Marinangeli, UOP Inc. A model for conversion from partially poisoned monoliths has been developed. The model includes a variation of washcoat thickness in the corners. Calculations predict that the use of fillets to obtain more uniform washcoats is advantageous for fresh catalyst activity at high catalytic rate constants. Conventional non-uniform washcoat dis- tributions show improved durability, especially for lower rate constants. 800845. Subjective Evaluation and Vehicle Behavior in Lane-Change Maneuvers. Akifumi Matsushita, Katsuji Takanami, Nobuyoshi Takeda and Masaru Takahashi, Isuzu Motors Ltd. (Japan). Subjective evaluations are commonly used to assess the handling qualities of a vehicle. They involve several inherent problems, though, such as the rating scale, driving method, and test facilities. Several types of test courses are discussed in this paper. Our statistical study indicates that the handling characteristics of a vehicle are closely associated with its behavior in lane-change maneuvers. On our test track we have set up various lane-change distances and offsets, to study the effect of speed and lane-change angle on the rating. From these results, we were able to ascertain those objective data that contribute to the driver's subjective rating. 800846. Correlation Between Open and Closed Loop Vehicle Handling Measurements. Walter Berg- man, Ford Motor Co. This paper describes correlation between open and closed loop measurements of vehicle response time in transient steer maneuvers. Open loop tests were conducted by negotiating ramp steer and reverse ramp steer maneuvers. The response time values were determined at five levels of lateral acceleration. Closed loop tests were conducted by negotiating lane change maneuvers. The response time values were determined by using cross-correlation func- tion. It was found that correlation between closed and open loop test data is greatly influenced by the selection of response time criteria, test procedure, and level of lateral acceleration used for determination of response time in open loop tests. The best correlation (R = .958) was obtained for lateral acceleration response time determined by using reverse ramp steer and measuring the response time at zero lateral acceleration. 800847. Static Stability and Control of the Automobile Utilizing the Moment Method. Roy S. Rice, Calspan Corporation; and W. F. Milliken, Jr., Milliken Research Associates. Some three and a half years ago the present authors described a new method for analyzing automobile stabil- ity and control (see SAE Paper No. 760712, "The Static Directional Stability and Control of the Automobile," October 1976). The present paper is an extension of the earlier work with particular emphasis upon its application, interpretation and general utility for evaluating auto- mobile stability and controllability. Specific applications of the technique to production vehicles will be used for illustration. The usefulness of the method for mapping out the total maneuvering performance in the nonlinear and limit handling as well as in the linear range will be examined. Such items as off-trim operation, a maneuver- ing diagram, tangent speed and the determination of the transient response from the Moment Method diagrams will be discussed, as will the possibility of developing a universal diagram based on a force/moment presentation for the vehicle. A conclusion that this method offers distinct advantages in analyzing car stability and control, including front drive problems, is reached. 1980 SAE Transactions 800848. Effects of Crosswinds on Vehicle Response - Full-Scale Tests and Analytical Predictions. 115</page><page sequence="97">800851-800857 Richard H. Klein and Jeffrey R. Hogue, Systems Technology, Inc. Full-scale vehicle response tests were conducted on five vehicles using a crosswind disturbance test facility capable of providing a 35 mph wind over a nominal 120 ft test length. The vehicles were a Honda Accord, Chevrolet station wagon, Ford Econoline van, VW Microbus, and Ford pickup/camper. Results showed that passenger cars, station wagons, and most vans have virtually no crosswind sensitivity problems, whereas the VW Microbus, the pickup/camper (in winds higher than 35 mph), and cars pulling trailers do have potential problems. Key vehicle parameters dictating this yaw response sensitivity are the distance between the aerodynamic and tire force centers, tire restoring moment (including understeer gradient), and the basic aerodynamic side forces. A simple analytical relationship in these terms was developed to predict steady-state yaw rate in steady winds. The collected results show the validity of the simplified expressions and define the relationship between subjective driver ratings and the objective measures. This latter step represents the first attempt at defining maximum allowable crosswinds for a given vehicle response. 1980 SA E Transactions 800851. Belt Tension Decay of Automotive V and V- Ribbed Belts. W. G. Fuetterer and H. J. Schlam- adinger, Cummins Engine Co., Inc. The tension decay of V and V-ribbed belts has been a concern of engineers and maintenance people for many years. The relationship between initial tension and retained tension are studied for a variety of belt cross sections. The study includes recommended tension decay test procedures, method of measuring belt tensions and recommended tension procedures to minimize the effect of tension decay. 800852. Influence of Crush Orientation on Knee Bolster Function in Barrier Crash Simulation. Clyde C. Culver and David C. Viano, General Motors Research Laboratories. Barrier crash simulations with a torso-belted Part 572 dummy were conducted to determine the influence of knee bolster crush orientations of 0°-60° on lower extremity restraint. Responses from two sled velocity and mean deceleration severities were investigated: 6.6 m/s at 7.5 g and 13.5 m/s at 13.9 g. The dummy's knees were prepositioned 10 cm from individual experimental bol- sters, which crushed along a predetermined axis. Bolster orientation had only a minor effect on the level of peak dummy femur, and resultant knee bolster reaction load and on lower extremity kinematics of the torso-belted occupant; however, the local loading of the knee and level of tibial compression were significantly influenced. 1980 SA E Transactions 800853. Passenger Car and Light Truck Fuel Economy Trends through 1980. J. D. Murrell, J. A. Foster and D. M. Bristor, Environmental Protection Agency. The 4000-mile EPA fuel economy figures are presented for passenger cars from pre-emission control models through 1980, for light-trucks from 1975 through 1980, and for motorcycles for 1980. The paper accumulates most of the fuel economy analyses presented in previous papers of this kind. Accordingly, it is voluminous with data, and necessarily terse in textual material. It presupposes reader familiarity with the nature of the EPA tests and data bases, and the techniques used for the analyses, particularly harmonic sales weighting of fuel economy data. The reader must refer to precursor papers for such descriptions. Some aspects treated are: stratification by weight class, vehicle size class, manufacturer, and MPG range; domestic vs. import, gasoline vs. Diesel, and 49-states vs. California models. 800855. A Double Ended Brake Test Rig with Inertia Simulation. Hans-J. von Thun, Brown Boveri &amp; Cie AG (Mannheim/Germany). Brake test rigs are normally designed with variable flywheel sets. This paper describes a method to simulate variable moments of inertia at a fixed flywheel electrically by means of electrical drive and both power and control electronics. We shall describe the simulation procedure and both the mechanical and electrical structure. We shall list the advantages of the procedure: shorter con- structional length, increased ease of operation and time saving and a high degree of automation, i.e. by comput- erized calculation of the moment of inertia. Owing to its short constructional length, the procedure is particularly suitable for double ended brake test rigs. A process utilizing the cooling gaps has been developed and tested: Two identical or different test pieces may be tested in time-sharing mode. We shall compare the simulation process with the results of conventional test rigs. 800856. Resistance of NBR-Based Fuel Hose Tube to Fuel-Alcohol Blends. J. R. Dunn and H. A. Pfisterer, Polysar Limited. The recent history of NBR fuel hose tubes is reviewed, with special emphasis on retention of physical properties after exposure to various test media, including fuel- alcohol blends. Also studied was the problem of permeability. It was found that one route to dramatically lowering permeabili- ties is the application of a thin veneer of nylon to an NBR base. 800857.

Ryan, III, U.S. Army Fuels and Lubricants Research Laboratory, Southwest Research In- stitute, San Antonio, Texas. An investigation of the effects of methanol fuel on spark ignition engine wear and deposits is being conducted using a Ford 2.3-liter engine and a modified ASTM sequence V-D test procedure. This testing indicates that at the low temperature conditions of this procedure, metha- nol reduces the buildup of engine deposits but greatly increases the engine wear rate. Various experiments to identify the wear mechanisms were conducted in a CLR single-cylinder engine and are reported here. 1980 SA E Transactions 800858. Exhaust and Evaporative Emissions from Alcohol and Ether Fuel Blends. T. M. Naman and J. R. Allsup, U.S. Dept. of Energy, Bartlesville Energy Technology Center. An experimental study was conducted at the U.S. Dept. of Energy's, Bartlesville (Okla.) Energy Technology Center to evaluate the effects of four potential fuel extenders (each blended with gasoline) on fuel economy, exhaust emissions, and evaporative emissions from eight 1978 automobiles (three with California emission controls and five with Federal emission control systems). The gaso- line/fuel extender blends were: 90% gasoline/ 10% etha- nol, 90% gasoline/ 10% methanol, 93% gasoline/7% methyl tertiary butyl ether, and 93% gasoline/7% tertiary butyl alcohol. In general, fuel economy decreased from 2.7 to 7.6% with each blend when compared to the base fuel (Indolene). Carbon monoxide emissions were reduced by 8 to 46%. Unburned hydrocarbon emissions were reduced by 5 to 32%, and oxides of nitrogen were either unaffected or increased depending on the fuel extender and the type of emission controls used. Evaporative emissions were generally increased - with the greatest increase (93%) observed with methanol and the lowest increase (5%) shown with tertiary butyl alcohol. 1980 SA E Transactions 800859. Phosphorus and Lead Poisoning of Pelleted Three-Way Catalysts. David R. Monroe, Phys- ical Chemistry Dept., General Motors Research Laboratories, Warren, MI. A three-way catalyst containing only Rh and another containing Pt, Pd, and Rh were aged in engine exhaust. The engine was operated on fuel containing phosphorus or lead additives at concentrations high enough to accelerate the poisoning of the catalysts. Lead did not noticeably affect either catalyst's CO conversion. It did, however, reduce both catalysts' HC and NO conversions. The poisoning effect of phosphorus increased as the amount of phosphorus on the catalyst increased. While the amounts of phosphorus in the fuel consumed by the engine were similar in each test, the phosphorus collected by the catalysts varied greatly, depending on the nature of the fuel additives. 800860. The Burning Velocity in a CFR Engine with Different Turbulent Flow Fields Generated by Intake Valves. S. Chaibongsai, T. Kadota and N. A. Henein, Wayne State University. An equation has been derived to calculate the burning velocity in a CFR engine from the measured flame speed under different turbulent flow fields. The turbulence is generated during the intake stroke as the fresh charge flows through different perforated 360° shrouded intake valves. The shrouds have holes of different sizes, but of the same total flow area. Results show that these valves decrease the cycle- to-cycle variation and produce higher burning velocities than conventional valves, particularly at higher engine speeds. The burning velocity depends on the Reynolds number as well as the turbulence scale. 1980 SA E Transactions 800876. CAD/CAM - Practical Tool for General Avia- tion. E. James Johannes, Piper Aircraft Corp. In order for general aviation to thrive in the future, it must find ways of increasing product quality while decreasing the development and manufacturing cost. These attributes have been found in CAD/CAM. CAD/CAM has integrated engineering with manu- facturing to decrease total product development cost 30%. The system has increased productivity by a 4 to 1 ratio throughout product design, tool and fixture design and in fabrication of details and tools which use numerical control tape machines. 1980 SA E Transactions 800877.

Kollbrunner, BBC Brown, Boveri &amp; Co., Ltd. (Switzerland). Based on the experience with supercharging of engines in commercial vehicles, investigations have been carried out during the past two years on diesel engines for auto- mobiles. The results as regards performance, fuel con- sumption, and the characteristics of the exhaust gas are very encouraging, so that a complete range of pressure- wave superchargers (PWS) is in preparation to cover a range of between about 30 and 100 kW. A high degree of charging at medium and low speeds, combined with spontaneous availability of the torque, allows the engine to be made smaller, thereby shifting the average working point towards the optimal consumption of the engine, but without sacrificing driveability. 1980 SA E Transactions 800885. An Assessment of Flywheel Energy Storage in Electric Vehicles. C. R. Burrows and G. Price, School of Engrg. and Applied Sciences, Univ. of Sussex (Falmer/England); and F. G. Perry, Perbury Engrg. Ltd. (East Grinstead/Sussex/England). The analysis and design of a hybrid drive for a 7.5 tonne urban delivery van is described. The drive consists of a flywheel to supply the power for vehicle acceleration and a battery pack and compound-wound d.c. motor to supply the steady-state power requirements. The motor output is automatically regulated and the continuously variable transmission (CVT) is controlled to match the flywheel to the vehicle demand. Various types of CVT are considered and their relative merits are compared. It is concluded that rolling friction drives offer the best solution for vehicle applications. Results of a digital simulation are presented compar- ing the hybrid drive with an equivalent electric drive when the vehicle follows a standard duty cycle. The simulation is used to study the effect of varying the capacity of the flywheel and the benefits of regenerative braking are evaluated. It is shown that the hybrid drive gives a significant increase in vehicle range. 800886. Design Considerations for Flywheel-Transmission Automobiles. Andrew A. Frank and Norman H. Beachley, College of Engrg., Univ. of Wisconsin - Madison. The standard vehicle propulsion system and its controls are compared with a flywheel propulsion system. Dif- ferent concepts of control and various system configu- rations are explored. Some considerations for the design of a general purpose automatic flywheel transmission vehicle are presented and discussed. Specifications re- quired for a flywheel transmission system which can achieve substantial mileage improvements and provide high performance are presented. The resulting vehicle would have performance of 0-60 mph in less than 10 seconds and achieve 50 miles per gallon on the Federal Urban Driving Cycle (FUDC) at an inertia weight of 3,000 lb. Higher mileages are possible for lighter vehicles. Fuel economy is achieved by (1) engine operation only at minimum BSFC, (2) elimination of engine idle, (3) recovery of energy from braking and (4) minimizing transmission losses. 1980 SA E Transactions 800887. Intercity Buses of the United States Present &amp; Future. James C. Hagerty and Daniel E. McCue, McCue, Hagerty-Design Energy. Intercity buses serving the United States have developed into what may be described as a design formula. The operating environment and markets served have had the greatest influence on the product configurations. Other physical design limitations imposed by State and Federal legislation have tended to reinforce conformity in intercity buses. This paper reviews each of the three intercity buses commonly used in the United States. Comparative specifications have been prepared to aid the uninitiated and the experts alike. In conclusion, an advanced design bus has been conceived to expose ideas which might eventually influ- ence the development of future vehicles and configuration limiting legislation. 800888. The Rotary Valve as an Alternative. M. E. Cross, Cross Mfg. Co. (1938) Ltd., Bath and Devizes, England. Rotary valves for four-cycle spark ignition engines have long fascinated the author. He describes a very early example of a rotary valve and then follows with an outline of the various developments with this type of valve within his own company. While such a valve has yet to achieve 118</page><page sequence="100">800889-800892 production status, he demonstrates his conviction that ideas initially formed around the rotary valve are quite likely to lead to useful developments in other directions, and quotes sound examples of cases in which this has happened in his experience. 800889. A Comparative Assessment of Current Gasohol Fuel Economy Data. William J. Shadis and Peter W. McCallum, Mueller Associates, Inc. The use of ethyl alcohol as a motor fuel blending agent has been promoted as method for reducing the con- sumption of petroleum. A mixture of 90 volume percent unleaded regular gasoline and 10 volume percent anhy- drous ethyl alcohol, popularly known as "Gasohol," has probably received the most current interest. This report is a summary and analysis of all currently available comparative Gasohol fuel consumption data. Usable data were eventually obtained from sixteen (16) different Gasohol test programs conducted by various public and private organizations. Ten (10) of these programs were conducted with chassis dynamometers, and the remaining six (6) were road tests of varying duration. Data from each of the test programs were subjected to a statistical analysis to determine whether the results were significant. Finally, all of the data were combined in order to determine an overall mean Gasohol fuel economy effect. Results of the tests analyzed indicate that in closely controlled tests, Gasohol use yields a significant decrease in fuel economy. 1980 SA E Transactions 800890. Alternate Transportation Fuels. Gene M. Handel, Henry K. Newhall and Echol M. Reed, Chevron Research Co., Richmond, CA. Oil shale, tar sands, and coal are very plentiful in North America. They are potential sources of transportation fuels to supplement or ultimately replace petroleum until renewable sources of energy can be developed. Synthetic fuels from oil shale, tar sands, and coal will phase into the supplies of transportation fuels during the rest of this century. The emerging nature of the technologies, the magnitude of petroleum use today, and the costs of building commercial plants all limit the rate at which synthetic fuels can be assimilated. One million barrels a day of synthetic fuels production by 1990 is ambitious but achievable if the governmental bodies cooperate in expediting the permitting and resolving the inevitable obstacles. Synthetic fuels can be refined to high quality transportation fuels using modern refining technology, and they can serve as substitutes for crude oil in refineries with modern hydroprocessing capability. 800891. Gasohol: Technical, Economic, or Political Pan- acea? Thomas C. Austin and Gary Rubenstein, California Air Resources Board. Gasohol, a blend of 90 percent unleaded gasoline and 10 percent ethanol, has been represented as an alternative to pure gasoline which can reduce the nation's crude oil dependence. However, a systems analysis of the gasohol production processes indicates that gasohol is increasing rather than decreasing the nation's dependence on crude oil. Alternative uses of the petroleum and natural gas currently used to manufacture ethanol would reduce the nation's demand for oil. At the present time, every gallon of crude oil "saved" by substituting ethanol for gasoline results in a need to import approximately two gallons of crude oil. The federal government's claim that gasohol can reduce the nation's dependence on imported energy appears to be based principally on political considera- tions, but also on the assumption that coal will eventually replace the petroleum and natural gas currently used in the gasohol production wherever possible. However, if one considers using the coal that would otherwise be con- sumed in gasohol production to make methanol or synthetic gasoline and diesel fuel, then gasohol will not reduce our dependence on imported energy but it will result in higher energy costs. Although many different government subsidies are causing the true cost of gasohol to be hidden from customers, the hidden costs are being paid indirectly by the nation's taxpayers. Because the effect of gasohol on automobiles is highly dependent on engine design and calibration, there is a wide variety of data on how gasohol alters vehicle performance. Older, richly calibrated cars can exhibit improved fuel economy and lower exhaust emissions due to the mixture enleanment caused by the blending of ethanol into gasoline. However, late model automobiles experience reduced fuel economy and mixed exhaust emissions impacts when gasohol is used. The principal environmental impact of gasohol is the substantially increased evaporative emissions which are experienced by most vehicles. The authors advocate réévaluation of the govern- ment's commitment to gasohol and increased govern- mental support for using the nonrenewable resources needed for gasohol production on the production of synthetic gasoline and diesel fuel, and methanol, all of which are projected to be less expensive and more energy efficient fuels. 1980 SA E Transactions 800892. Gasohol: Laboratory and Fleet Test Evaluation. M. D. Gurney and J. R. Allsup, U.S. Depart- ment of Energy, Bartlesville Energy Technology Center; and C. L. Merlotti, Southwestern Bell Telephone Company. An experimental program was conducted as a cooperative effort between the Southwestern Bell Telephone Company and the Department of Energy's Bartlesville (Okla.) Energy Technology Center to determine the effects of a gasohol fuel when compared to a control gasoline. The 119</page><page sequence="101">800894-800897 test vehicles used in this program were separated into two groups-a test fleet and a control fleet. The vehicles consisted of several vans, trucks, and automobiles rou- tinely used in commercial service. The laboratory analysis included testing the vehicles on a controlled environ- mental chassis dynamometer at a constant ambient temperature of 75° F. Field measurements and data collection included road driveability, in-use fuel economy, and fuel system failures. Laboratory analysis provided information on exhaust emissions, fuel economy, and trace metals in the crank- case lubricating oils. The effect of varying the chassis dynamometer inertia weight was also examined. A reduction in regulated exhaust emissions was found with gasohol, but there was considerable variation among the vehicles. No difference was detected in vehicle fuel economy at actual load weights. Unregulated emissions were higher for gasohol, but the absolute levels were low. The fuel economy with gasohol relative to gasoline was improved as the vehicle weight was increased. A larger quantity of copper was found in the crankcase lubricating oil of the vehicles operating on gasohol when compared to the vehicles operating on gasoline. Driveability was poorer with gasohol, especially during the winter and summer seasons. 800894. Electronic Engine Control Systems for the Smal- ler Passenger Car. T. Toy oda, T. Inoue, T. Yaegashi and K. Aoki, Engine Research &amp; Emission Control Dept., Higashi Fuji Technical Center, Toyota Motor Co., Ltd. The usefulness of a micro-processor based engine vehicle control system has been demonstrated and widely rec- ognized. With the rapid progress of LSI technology in process and structure, the improvement of micro-proc- essor performance and reliability is remarkable in com- puting speed, functions, and memory size. By utilizing this improved micro-processor performance, a more sophis- ticated engine-vehicle control system can be composed. The objective of this study is to clarify the requirements for an engine control unit (ECU) and a control strategy in the case that these systems are applied to smaller engines and smaller vehicles and where high accuracy of control is needed. An experimental control unit has been developed. Both transient and steady state compensation controls for fuel injection and ignition timing have been investigated. The requirements for conversion time of the analog to digital converter, the interpolation logic for crank angle signal, and the compensation circuitry have been clarified. The effectiveness of the compensation control, asyn- chronous fuel injection, and the adaptive control of air to fuel ratio have been demonstrated. 1980 SA E Transactions 800895. A Reliability Program for Electronic Engine Controls. Kenneth W. Doversberger, Delco Electronics Div., GMC. Achieving improvements in automobile driveability and customer satisfaction with engines designed to meet government mandated emission and fuel economy stan- dards has resulted in the use of digital electronic computers as engine controls. Recognizing that the automobile environment is uniquely harsh on electronic parts and systems, reliability considerations had a major impact on the product development program. This paper highlights some of the major responses to these consid- erations. In engineering, these included: 1) a vendor participating parts improvement program directed toward highly reliable performance of large volumes of parts in the automotive environment, 2) unique high stress labo- ratory and fleet tests to identify and correct system defects during development, and 3) a management discipline and product review procedure requiring concurrence by all affected staff areas prior to release of each design to production. In manufacturing and quality control oper- ations where a background of the successful Apollo and avionics Carousel IV inertial navigation systems exists, expertise was applied to providing manufacturing equip- ment and test computers to build, stress test and burn-in the high volumes of these electronic computers. The results of this effort and investment are new electronic controls designed to take their place as highly reliable components for the new breed of automobiles for the Ws. 800896. A Custom Built Microcomputer System for Automotive Applications. Wolfram H. Glauert, Robert Bosch of North America Inc. A custom microprocessor system (CPU, I/O, ROM) has been developed especially for automotive applications. The design goal was to create a chip-set which can be manufactured for reasonable costs, meets the tough reliability and environmental conditions, and performs well enough for modern engine control requirements. The system was designed in close cooperation with a seimcon- ductor house (AMI) so that all design trade-offs were transparent to the original system designers. The first part deals with the general design philosophy. The second gives some detailed information on the microprocessor system itself. 800897. Materials and Processes Versus Reliability and Cost.

During the first four years of operation, the Arizona Vehicular Emissions Inspection Maintenance Program has been effective in reducing carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon concentrations at the tailpipe of in-use vehicles. Repairs to those vehicles failing the inspection result in significant reductions in average tailpipe emis- sions. The magnitude of the reductions is sensitive to cutpoint selection and the requirement for maintenance. 800903. Comparison of Laboratory and On-the-Road Automobile Fuel Economy Data for a Fleet of California Automobiles. Michael R. Appleby and Bruce Hodge, Automòtive Engrg. Dept., Engi- neering and Technical Services Div., Automo- bile Club of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA. Fuel economy data on 1975-1978 California production automobiles was generated by three methods; the ap- proved carbon balance method, a direct/gravimetric method, and in-use fuel economy. Both low mileage (0-15,000 mile) and high mileage (40,000-60,000 mile) data were acquired. The data was analyzed on a paired automobile basis, and also by engine family, to determine percent differences between: - EPA estimates and production automobile fuel economy. - the fuel economy measurement methods. - the fuel economy of automobiles at low and high mileage. The results and conclusions indicate significant dif- ferences between EPA estimates and production auto- mobile fuel economy between fuel economy measurement methods, and fuel economy changes due to mileage accumulation. 800904.

The tests were performed in 1973 and 1979, on representative samples of 1969-73 and 1979-80 model year automobiles respectively. Fuel economy of the test autos was deter- mined under the following conditions: constant speed, the effect of air conditioning, open windows, tire pressure, acceleration rate, and on-the-road tests involving freeway, light city and heavy city driving. Results indicate the effect of the various conditions on fuel economy, and differences between the two generations of automobiles. 800905. Measurement and Representation of the Me- chanical Properties of Truck Leaf Springs. P. S. Fancher, R. D. Ervin, C. C. MacAdam and C. B. Winkler, Highway Safety Research Institute, The Univ. of Michigan. The force-versus-deflection properties of truck leaf springs are studied with respect to the influences of motion amplitude and frequency (0 to 15 Hz) upon hysteretic damping and effective spring rate. Presented test results indicate that the energy loss per cycle of motion of a leaf spring is independent of the frequency of cycling. Measurements showing the influence of the amplitude of stroking are analyzed for five representative examples of currently employed leaf springs. A mathematical method for representing the force-versus-deflection characteristics of leaf springs is presented in a form suitable for use in digital simulations of vehicle dynamics. 800906.

Riding Mower Development by Dynamic Design Techniques. H. T. Knudson, Simplicity Manu- facturing Co. (Allis-Chalmers Subsidiary); P. T. Shupert and P. N. Sheth, Advanced Technology Center, Allis-Chalmers Corp., Milwaukee, WI. The Simplicity Cavalier Series of rear engine rider mowers, introduced in 1979, is utilized in this paper to illustrate the engineering development process for achiev- ing improved operator comfort. It is shown that a proposed ISO Standard for hand-arm vibrations offers one method to quantify the subjective "feel" of the operator towards various vibration levels. Such a quan- tification is necessary to form a basis for comparison of competitive designs. The dynamic design techniques of modal and Fourier analysis, dynamic testing, and finite element analysis are shown to provide improved design of the system for structural and vibration performance. Specific finite element models of the frame and of the steering wheel are described and their use for improved vibration design discussed. Design considerations and trade offs for the engine/vehicle interaction leading to the selected engine configuration for the Cavalier series mowers are discussed. The unique vehicle body suspen- sion on the frame by soft but progressively stiffening mounting arrangement and the resulting vibration per- formance of the Cavalier mower are described. 800934.

Rubin, Bolt, Beranek, and Newman, Inc., Cambridge, MA. Bulldozer noise is the most serious noise problem for surface miners today. Not only are bulldozers the most common type of mobile equipment, but the majority of their operators are also exposed to more noise than current federal regulations allow. In 1977, the Bureau of Mines responded to this problem by developing retrofit noise control treatments which reduce the noise that reaches the operator. These treatments were specifically designed to be readily installed in the field at low cost. In 1978, these treatments were installed on two Caterpillar D9G's in surface coal mines to demonstrate the noise reduction that can be achieved under actual production conditions. This paper presents the results of the field demonstrations. 800936. SAE's Role in ROPS Criteria and Continued Development. John R. Prosek, DuPage Engi- neering Services, Inc.

Though the discussion is related primarily to off-highway hauler operator training, the principles can be applied to train operators of other off-highway machines. The training concept which the OBSAC reflects is appropriate for several types of off-highway equipment. 800949. Soft Shift Reversing Control System for Con- struction Vehicles. Gilbert E. Redzinski, Clark Equipment Co. In the operation of certain earthmoving and other construction vehicles, efficient use of the vehicle requires frequent reversal of direction. When a drive reversal is executed with the vehicle in motion, a severe strain or damage may be imposed on the driveline, and, addi- tionally, the sudden change of direction may be uncom- fortable or possibly hazardous to the operator of the vehicle. The electronic reversing control system described here prevents excessive shock loading of a construction vehicle driveline when the operator calls for a direction reversal with the vehicle in motion. It is a digital-logic forward-reverse control channel, which can be inhibited by a speed-responsive signal. It also includes a speed- retarding channel, which can control the vehicle brakes and throttle, and a logic power loss detector system. 800951. Design Concepts for a Heavy Load Transporter Utilizing a Hydrostatic Transmission Propel System. Mike Clifford, ASEA Inc., Houston, TX. When designing a heavy load transporter, the design engineer is confronted by many problems that seemingly impose conflicting requirements on the design. The vehicle suspension system must distribute the load equally over a large number of wheels while allowing the wheels to conform to the longitudinal and transverse profiles of the road. The propulsion system selected must allow for suspension and steering systems flexibility, good all wheel tractive effort, low vehicle profile height, dynamic braking of the vehicle on inclines, etc. This paper outlines the approach taken by one company, Trabosa Inc. of Barcelona, Spain, to the design of a heavy load transporter utilizing a hydrostatic transmission for the propel system. 1980 SA E Transactions 800953. Tracked Vehicles - Terrain Damage and Econ- omy. M. G. Bekker, (retired). Terrain damage by tracked vehicles, due to rut making and ground compaction, also results in higher locomotive resistance which lowers fuel economy. Both the damage and the economy may be controlled by proper design, and by the correct use of a right vehicle. To this end, methods of land locomotion mechanics are useful as described in this paper. The application of these methods also suggests some ideas that appear promising for a further study. 1980 SA E Transactions 800954. Mini Baja Vehicle Design Considerations. Brian D. Higgins and Robert L. Woods, Univ. of Texas at Arlington, Arlington, TX. This paper reviews the requirements of a Mini-Baja vehicle, discusses the conflicting design trade-offs, and outlines some of the more successful design approaches in recent years. The design alternatives are discussed in general terms and exemplified with previous vehicles. A complete summary of the vehicles entered in the 1980 Texas Mini Baja is presented. 800955. 1980 Mini-Baja East. Alfred A. Gruber, Wilmington, DE; and John R. Zimmerman, Univ. of Delaware, Newark, DE. For the engineering students involved, the Mini-Baja competition is demanding, yet rewarding. It provides in microcosm professional project experience characteristic of contemporary industrial practice. In this paper, the competition is described, the vehicles themselves are discussed, and some helpful hints for future hosts are given. 800956. Midwest Baja - Perspectives on Participation. Vincent J. Ursini, Lawrence W. Evers, Raymond W. Kauppila and David A. Carlson, Michigan Technological Univ. The 1980 SAE sponsored Midwest Baja was attended by thirteen schools. The Michigan Technological University vehicle finished fourth overall in the competition but first of the first year entries. Participation in this event requires a considerable investment of time and resources on the part of the students and faculty but the rewards are great. 124</page><page sequence="106">800958-800964 The student chapter faculty advisor sees the activity as an enjoyable competitive experience for the SAE student members to learn first hand and in a responsible way what it means to be an engineer. The design professor sees the project as one of the best tools for teaching and learning the interrelation of product design, manufacture, time schedules, costs and project management. The technical advisors see the activity as an opportunity for the participating students to operate in a complex coordinated group effort that is a realistic model of industry. The students see the activity as an important part of their education. They tackle an interesting competitive project, complete it, and are proud of their successes. The Midwest Baja is of much value and it is strongly recommended to be continued but with some changes to make the competition new each year. 800958. Hydraulic Technology Applied in European Ex- cavators. Wilfried W. Wotke, Liebherr-America, Inc. The mobile hydraulic excavator has influenced high pressure hydraulic development more than any other type of equipment. Since the introduction of the first hydraulic excavators in Europe the search for higher operating pressure while retaining compact components, has been critical in the development of more powerful hydrostatic drives. A major breakthrough was achieved when variable displacement axial piston pumps equipped with horse- power control and multiple spool directional control valves (monoblocks) were made available to excavator manufacturers. With the ability of these hydrostatic components to handle higher operating pressures, and the on-going development for larger pumps and actuators, the production of bigger and more powerful hydraulic excavators has become possible. 1980 SAE Transactions 800961. Development of a Single Lip Molded Seal. Larry A. Circle and S. James Puckett, Bearing Div., FMC Corp. The development of direct bonding of nitrile rubber compounds to metal inserts during the molding process has made the single lip molded seal a viable probability. Empirical data was used to formulate design criteria which provided the optimum torque characteristic and sealing capability. Five parameters were investigated during empirical testing which included the static seal torque, seal lip thickness, undercut radius, lip/hub interference, and operational speed. Housing temperature rise was used to evaluate the influence of parameter variation. The primary contributor to operational temperature was speed, and secondary was seal lip thickness. Lip/hub interference and undercut radius were major contributors to sealing capability. 800962. (SP-468) Developmental Work of High Speed 3.0 Liter Diesel Engine. Shigefumi Nakata, Koji Yoshizu and Koichi Hatamura, Toyo Kogyo Co., Ltd. In this paper the methods applied to the Mazda 3.0 liter diesel engine for truck to reduce the size, weight as well as sound level, while improving the durability and reliability, are presented. The Mazda 3.0 liter diesel engine was developed as the smallest in size and weight among all normally aspirated diesel engines of 90 PS or 3.0 liter class by means of incorporating engine accessory layout change, engine structure modification and material change. To meet Japan's stringent future noise regulations, efforts for noise reduction were focussed on engine modification aimed at reducing combustion and me- chanical noises at the sources rather on an enclosure approach. With the cylinder head with a new bolt pattern, modified combustion chamber, cylinder block of higher rigidity, expansion-controlled piston, modified piston cooling system, and fully balanced crankshaft, it has been made possible to reduce the sound level by 3-4 dBA. 1980 SAE Transactions 800963. (SP-468) Experimental Work of High Speed and Highly Supercharged Two- Cycle Diesel Engine for Combat Vehicle. Toyoki Ishii, Kenji Fuji- mura and Masatoshi Hashimoto, T. R&amp;D I., Defense Agency (Japan). This paper describes the results of research of the improvement of combustion behaviour and raising the output power of a highly supercharged 2 cycle diesel engine. Performance data has been obtained with a full scale single cylinder experimental engine to correlate the air flow patterns in the transparent full scale cylinders. As a result the net power has increased 1.8 to 2.0 times that of the original supercharged engine. These data should be useful for development of high speed smaller and higher performance engine. This engine could be developed for future use in heavy combat vehicles which would be operated under much more severe conditions. 800964. (SP-468) Investigations on Recycle and Closed- Cycle Diesel Engines. Tadataka Asada and Masashi Nagai, Technical Research Inst., Hi- tachi Shipbuilding &amp; Engrg. Co., Ltd. First, several technological problems pertaining to the recycle and closed-cycle diesel engines, but different from the problems of general air environment operation engines, were extracted and the expected engine cycle was discussed from a thermodynamic viewpoint. Then, land-based testing equipment for the recycle engine was manufactured for a trial, with intention to develop an underwater power source. With the equipment, 125</page><page sequence="107">800965-800969 experiments were carried out to look into the working and the performance of the engine. Furthermore, the equip- ment was modified and made into a closed-cycle diesel engine for a trial and experiments were conducted. The test results were compared with the results of the thermodynamic analysis, and the suitability of the analysis method was evaluated. Subsequently on the basis of these data, we succeeded in developing under-water practical power source "HIRUP". 1980 SA E Transactions 800965. (SP-468) Application of Laser Doppler Ane- mometry to a Motored Diesel Engine. Shin Matsuoka, Katsuhiko Nagakura, Taiyo Kawai and Takeyuki Kamimoto, Tokyo Inst, of Tech- nology (Japan); and Yuzo Aoyagi, Hino Motors Ltd. (Japan). Some problems associated with applying LDA to the measurement of air motion in the engine's cylinder are studied experimentally for both the forward and the back scattering technique in a motored diesel engine. The effects of the doppler broadening caused by the velocity gradient and the diameters of the scattering particles are discussed. The decaying process and the structure of the in-cylinder flow field are studied using the measurements of the main flow velocity, the turbulent intensity and macro scales and normalised power spectrum of the turbulence. A comparison measurement is also made between the forward scattering and the back scattering techniques. 800966. (SP-468) Combustion Behaviors Under Accel- erating Operation of an IDI Diesel Engine. Tadashi Murayama and Noboru Miyamoto, Hokkaido Univ. (Japan); Toshio Tsuda, Mitsu- bishi Motor Co., Ltd. (Japan); Masao Suzuki, Toyota Motor Co., Ltd. (Japan); and Shun-ichi Hasegawa, Nissan Diesel Co., Ltd. (Japan). In a four-cycle, naturally aspirated, pre-chamber diesel engine, the combustion characteristics such as the rates of fuel injection, the ignition lag, the rates of heat release, the combustion peak pressure, the maximum rates of pressure rise, and the smoke density, were investigated for over 70 consecutive cycles under acceleration, with the aid of an on-line data handling system developed for this exper- iment. The effects of operating conditions such as the fuel injection timing, the fuel spray angle, the wall temperature of the combustion chamber, and the coolant temperature, on the combustion characteristics were also investigated. As a result, it was clarified that the fuel injection timing as well as the coolant temperature were important factors for improving the acceleration; the combustion characteristics during the acceleration except for the time just after the beginning of acceleration were estimated from the data obtained for steady-state operation cor- responding to acceleration. 1980 SA E Transactions 800967. (SP-468) Investigation and Development of a Turbulent Open Combustion Chamber. K. Komiyama, K. Kajiyama and M. Okada, Engine Technical Center, Komatsu Ltd. (Japan). A kind of a turbulent combustion chamber has been investigated. This combustion system gives the good trade-off characteristics of exhaust nitric oxides and fuel economy. Typical combustion characteristics with some changes of design parameters of combustion chamber were observed. To understand combustion mechanism in this particular combustion chamber, air motion in the . chamber was visualized by "spark method". Faster dissipation of large scale swirl flow induced by inlet port and an active small scale turbulent corner flow were observed. Conclusively small scale turbulence generated by combustion chamber was estimated to be effective to cause faster combustion. 800968. (SP-468) Investigation on the Characteristics of Diesel Fuel Spray. Hikaru Kuniyoshi, Tokyo Denki Univ.; Hideaki Tanabe and G. Takeshi Sato, Keio Univ.; and Hajime Fujimoto, Mie Univ. The authors carried out a basic and systematic inves- tigation on diesel combustion processes using three different experimental apparatuses. This paper summarized the experimental results obtained from the three devices. Among the data con- tained in this paper are: (1) The structure and shape of diesel spray, the air movement around diesel spray and the spatial and temporal distributions of the size of droplets in diesel spray injected into the high pressure and room temperature charge. (2) The shape of diesel spray injected into the high pressure and high temperature charge. (3) The characteristics of flame, and illumination delay, and ignition delay in the high pressure and high temperature charge. 1980 SA E Transactions 800969. (SP-468) Diesel Combustion Temperature on Soot. Otto A. Uyehara, Mechanical Engrg. Dept., Univ. of Wisconsin. From recently published papers, mostly from Japanese authors, which deal with soot containing flames, the author chose certain experimental results contained in these papers to support the idea that 2000 to 2400° K is the temperature range in diffusion flames where the flame contains soot. The maximum soot concentration in diffusion flames occurs at a temperature of about 2150°K. From this peak, soot concentration containing flame at 2150, the soot concentration drops off on both sides until at about 1950 and at 2400 the flame contains negligible 126</page><page sequence="108">800970-800975 soot. Supportive arguments are presented and backed by published experimental data. 1 980 SA E Transactions 800970. (SP-468) A Study on the Application of the Two- Color Method to the Measurement of Flame Temperature and Soot Concentration in Diesel Engines. Yukio Matsui, Takeyuki Kamimoto and Shin Matsuoka, Tokyo Inst, of Technology (Japan). Flame temperature and KL factor in a DI diesel engine are measured optically by the two-color method. Some differences are observed between the measure values at visible and infrared wavelengths. These differences are caused by: (1) effect of change of index a in time at infrared wavelength during combustion period; (2) effect of distributions of temperature and soot concentration along optical path; and (3) effect of reflection at the walls. The optical characteristics and some other problems on the instrumentation of the two-color method at both wavelengths are also discussed. 1980 SA E Transactions 800971. Cylinder Components for Small Internal Com- bustion Engines. P. E. Warner, Brico Engineer- ing Ltd.

Don McComber, Advanced Belt R&amp;D, Gates Rubber Co.; and Russell F. Miller, AMF/Harley-Davidson Motor Co., Inc. With the development of synthetic high tensile strength arimid cord materials, the Gates Rubber Company was successful in constructing a polyurethane elastomeric synchronous power transmission timing belt with im- proved strength and durability properties over conven- tional power transmission drive chains, using this cord material as the tensile power-carrying member. A pro- duction model 80 cu. in. AMF Harley-Davidson motor- cycle is currently being marketed with both primary and secondary drive systems equipped with belts of this construction. A sophisticated testing and evaluation program was conducted to verify the improved durability and performance of this drive system application. 800973. Emission Control of Two-Stroke Motorcycle Engines by the Butterfly Exhaust Valve. Katsu- hiko Tsuchiya, Seiji Hirano, Makoto Okamura and Tohru Go toh, Yamaha Motor Co., Ltd. The 1979 U.S. EPA emission standards on larger-sized two-stroke cycle engine motorcycles were very strict. This paper discusses the butterfly exhaust valve system installed on the YAMAHA RD400 Daytona Special which is the only two-stroke cycle engine motorcycle in the controlled 400cc class. The paper also refers to the structure of the valve system and the principle of valve operation as well as its effects on reducing exhaust emissions, improving brake specific fuel consumption, and increasing engine power at part-throttle. In addition, the butterfly exhaust valve system has a great effect on reducing engine surge due to the cyclic variations in combustion inherent in two-stroke cycle engines. The reduction ratio of engine surge is expressed quantitatively in our unique method. The above effects were investigated by means of exhaust gas velocity measurements and by analysis of combustion pressure. 1980 SA E Transactions 800974. Syvaro's SP-440, Air Cooled, Rotary -Trochoidal Engine. Andrei Adam, Syvaro, Ltd. (Israel). A new, air cooled, rotary-trochoidal engine for industrial and recreational applications was designed and developed during the last eight years at SYVARO, Ltd. Engine features, structure, and development are discussed leading to the point where die-cast production could be offered for market penetration trials. In-depth description of the engine's specific components - peripheral cooled rotor housing, high pressure die-cast end housings, rotor, crankshaft, and bearings - is followed by the discussion of its auxiliary systems and accessories - cooling, lubricating, ignition and starting. The engine's relevant performances are reported including power output specific fuel con- sumption, evolution during endurance tests, and vibra- tion. 800975. Experimental Assessment of Scavenging Effi- ciency of Two-Stroke Cycle Engines. D. S. Sanborn, Consultant, San Diego, CA; and G. P. Blair, R. G. Kenny and A. H. Kingsbury, The Queen's Univ. of Belfast. Engineers dealing with the two-stroke cycle engine have always sought to find a scavenge flow simulation process which will allow for the development of an existing engine or provide information for the design of a new power unit. Many schemes put forward have been found wanting in some manner, although in recent times the method proposed by Jante has been shown to be very effective and to that end this paper provides further evidence. In this publication a new version of the old idea of simulating scavenging by a liquid flow approach is presented, an apparatus described and test results given for six cylinders of one two-stroke cycle engine. These six test cylinders have dissimilar scavenge flow characteristics while retain- ing similar dynamic flow parameters and are tested under firing conditions for the usual performance characteristics as well as for scavenging and trapping efficiencies; they 127</page><page sequence="109">800976-800983 are also tested using the Jante motoring method for their scavenge flow behaviour. Finally, the paper discusses the results achieved by the two simulation experimental techniques by comparison with the reality of the actual firing performance data and concludes that the Jante technique is further vindicated and that the new liquid flow test technique shows great promise as a method, particularly for the development of new cylinder designs. 1980 SA E Transactions 800976.

DiPino, Industrial Div. of Raybestos Manhattan, Inc. This paper traces the advancements made in wet friction materials. It begins by describing the state of the art prior to the inception of wet friction in 1938. A description is given for the various materials that were required to meet the demands of the equipment manufacturers from then to present day. Also included is a discussion of the roles that spacer plate finish and fluid have played.

Friction characteristics, energy capacity, and endurance under a variety of test param- eters are discussed. Relationships between key frictional operating parameters and material density variations are also analyzed. 800981. Molybdenum - An Alloy for the Eighties. Horace N. Lander, Climax Molybdenum Co., Div. of AMAX Inc. Molybdenum is produced either from primary mines, where it is the principal mineral, or from by-product mines where it is recovered from copper mining activities. The latter source of supply has not increased significantly in recent years because of production limitations. How- ever, increased demand for copper will make more by-product molybdenum available to the market. In addition, many companies are actively developing poten- tial new molybdenum mines and some could start producing as early as 1981. In the eighties, molybdenum demand is expected to remain strong because of the need for improved materials for energy generation, fuel production, manufacture of fuel efficient vehicles and other industrial applications. 1980 SA E Transactions 800982. (SP-468) Topics on the Developmental Work of Highly Supercharged DI Diesel Engines. Mitsu- yoshi Mori and Sadao Arakawa, Yanmar Diesel Engine Co., Ltd. This paper presents technical results on the developmental work of six (6) kinds of direct injection, high output diesel engines with cylinder bores from 105 mm to 185 mm. The use of the swirl type combustion system can reduce the load on fuel injection equipments. The swirl ratio for the highly supercharged engine must be set at a higher level to compensate for damping of the swirl due to the valve recess, as compared with natural aspirated engines of the same size. As a result, the engine becomes less sensitive to the changes of the swirl ratio and injection timing. With an increase in cylinder bore, the optimum swirl ratio becomes lower, the contour of the combustion chamber has to be changed from the deep to the shallow type, and the number of fuel injection nozzle holes increases for optimum operation. Consequently, the swirl type combustion system is more advantageous under 180 mm cylinder bore. 800983. (SP-468) Unique Measuring Method of Indicator Diagrams Using Strain History of Head Bolts. Noboru Miyamoto and Tadashi Murayama, Hokkaido Univ. (Japan); and Shin-ichi Gotoh, Mechanical Engrg. Lab. (Japan). To get accurate indicator diagrams without the use of pressure transducers, the strain and the displacement of the various parts of engine structures that would have 128</page><page sequence="110">800984-800989 some relationship with the presssure variation in the cylinder were measured and analyzed mathematically. By measuring the strain of the cylinder head bolts, the horizontal displacement of the crank shaft end, and the vertical displacement of the intake valve stem, we realized that the indicator diagrams could be obtained easily without a passage from the interior to the outside of the combustion chamber. Accurate indicator diagrams were estimated by apply- ing the pressure-strain diagram obtained from the static pressure test in the cylinder to the strain variation in the cylinder head bolts. On this occasion, the accuracy of the estimated indicator diagrams could be improved by providing the cylinder head system with a one degree freedom vibration system. The propriety of this measuring method was examined and proved in the experiments. This method can be applied not only for single cylinder engines, but also for multi-cylinder engines. 800984. (SP-468) Growth and Combustion of Soot Partic- ulates in the Exhaust of Diesel Engines. Yasuhiro Fujiwara and Shoichi Fukazawa, Hokkaido Inst, of Technology (Japan). The size and aggregation of soot particulates emitted from a diesel engine have been investigated using a transmis- sion electron microscope, and the chemical composition in soot particulates were analyzed by a gas Chromatograph in order to clarify the mechanisms of growth and combus- tion in the exhaust pipe. In the present report, the following results have been obtained: (1) When the gas temperature was lowered below 400°C in the exhaust pipe, the soot particle distribution shifted to a larger size, from 50 À to 100 A. This tendency was remarkable in the case of lower gas temperatures, (2) In this case, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons in the soot particulates exhibited a tendency to increase in the downstream of the exhaust pipe. (3) When hydrocarbons, for instance C2H2, C3H8, etc., were added to the exhaust gas, the rate of growth to soot particles increased compared with no addition. (4) When the exhaust gas was heated up to above 600°C, it was observed that soot particulates burnt from their surface, and they became smaller or burnt out. In this case, smoke density decreased and soot particle distributions shifted to a smaller size. 1980 SA E Transactions 800985. (SP-468) Prediction of In-Cylinder Gas Motion in Engines by an Energy Method. H. Kido, Y. Wakuri, S. Ono and E. Murase, Kyushu Univ. (Japan). A simple new method of prediction of a change in gas motion in an engine cylinder during the compression stroke has been developed for both flat piston and bowl-in-piston typed combustion chambers. The availa- bility of this method was ascertained by comparing the results of predictions with several measured ones. In order to show the effects of engine variables on the gas motion during the compression stroke quantitatively, calculations have been made also with some typical engine dimensions. 800986. (SP-468) Combined Measurement by Photog- raphy and Gas Sampling for Combustion Analysis in a Diesel Engine Cylinder. Masahiko Hori and Hiromi Sugiyama, Japan Automobile Research Inst. Inc. Schlieren and direct cine photography have been used in conjunction with the gas sampling method to investigate three dimensional combustion phenomena in a DI diesel engine cylinder. Gas movement, dispersion of fuel-air mixture after fuel impingement on the cavity wall and the combustion process under continuous running conditions were ob- served. Gas concentrations of NOx, THC, CO, C02, 02, H2 and decomposed hydrocarbons were analyzed. The distribution of equivalent fuel concentration and the decomposition process of fuel are presented. Air swirl accelerates the homogeneity of fuel-air mixture after spray impingement on the cavity wall. It is concluded that a combined measurement by photography and gas sampling method is a useful one to combustion study of diesel engines. 1980 SA E Transactions 800987.

The material presented in this paper describes customi- zation of equipment used in logging, construction and agriculture by one heavy equipment dealer in the Northwestern portion of the United States. Customization is the modification of basic machines by the addition to or fitting out of special attachments, major and minor changes to a machine so it will do a specific job more economically, do more than one job economically or to provide a machine that is not readily available. Many examples of customization and the considerations re- quired to engineer and fabricate these items are discussed. Sales responsibility, design, fabrication, accounting and service of these specials is also discussed. 800989. Equipment Customization as a Full Time Busi- ness. David T.

The business of full time equipment customization in the 129</page><page sequence="111">800990-801000 international market presents unique, complex problems. To cope with these persistent problems, a company must be organized in such a way to assure interfacing of all the company's facets in a consistent and efficient manner. With proper interfacing, each facet of the company is assured of participating in the decision processes through- out the product development cycle. In this manner product problems can be shared and solved broadening the entire company's knowledge and increasing efficiency. 800990. (SP-469) The Impact of Energy Costs on Mobile Equipment Design. Rolland Nielson, J. N. Fauver Co. This paper identifies the cost of power consumed by a gas or diesel engine as $500 per HP over a 10,000 hour life. In addition, it shows how the rate of increase of fuel costs is affecting the end user's purchasing decisions. It also contains some general ideas on how mobile equipment can be designed to be more energy efficient. This paper should be of value to both the designers and the sales/marketing people at the mobile O.E.M.'s. 800991. (SP-469) Case History of a Development Pro- gram to Save Energy by Using Clutches with Hydraulic Pumps and Motors. George H. Mor- gan, Auso Specialties Mfg. Co. After hydraulic failsafe brakes proved themselves in many applications, it appeared that a companion, convenience- packaged hydraulic clutch would also be of value in solving problems. The clutch resulting from subsequent marketing research and design has, during the past seven years, been of use in a number of applications. It has become a catalyst for new equipment design thinking which has paid off in ways that include energy savings, equipment cost reduction, noise reduction, maintenance reduction, employee and equipment protection, space savings, and versatility. This report discusses the clutch's development in detail, and provides "case histories". 800992. (SP-469) Energy Consideration in Hydraulic System Design. Patrick R. Novak, J. N. Fauver Co. In the past, designers of hydraulic systems placed low priority on energy efficiency of hydraulic systems when compared to initial cost. Today's ever rising fuel prices put them in the unique position of being able to justify the higher installed cost of more efficient systems. In doing so, he can not only be saving the end user thousands of dollars in fuel costs, but also reduce fuel consumption by millions of gallons annually. 800993. (SP-469) Gear Box Design with Flywheel for Reduced Vibrations and Energy Savings. Saul Herscovici, Power Engrg. &amp; Mfg., Ltd. Severe vibrations have been encountered in power drives that use hydrostatic power transmissions to provide the power at the working implement. Such vibrations often lead to failure of the hydraulic motor, hydraulic pump, hoses, speed reducing gear box, drive chain and other working components that may be a part of the power transmission system. This paper describes the design approach . taken to provide inertia by use of a flywheel to a speed reducing gear box driven by a hydraulic motor in an application where high torque peaks are present. A further improve- ment is obtained by the use of a slip clutch for applications where the implement is being brought to a complete stop in milliseconds. The use of the flywheel reduces or eliminates the vibrations and associated failures and improves efficiency. 1980 SA E Transactions 800994. (SP-469) Hydrostatic Systems for Saving Energy. Fred Pollman, Sundstrand Hydro-Transmission. Manufacturers of mobile equipment are continuously concerned with improving their machines. In the past, the bulk of the machine systems design work has been directed toward faster time cycles or improved controlla- bility. Recent increases in the cost of energy have caused some effort to be directed at improved fuel efficiency. Although initial efforts have been in the area of improved components, improved system designs can also contribute substantially toward reduced energy usage. This paper will examine the relationship of system components and compare alternate hydrostatic trans- mission systems for relative efficiency. Fortunately, traditional concerns about productivity can also be addressed by some of the same system changes. 800995. (SP-469) Load Sensitive Steering for Energy Savings. Bernard J. Larson, Eaton Corp., Min- neapolis Div. There are very few people in the industrial world that have driven vehicles who do not know the advantages of Power Steering. As a matter of fact, a relatively high percentage of on-highway vehicles are now power steered. There is even a much larger percentage of all off-highway vehicles that are also power steered. Many of these off-highway vehicles are primarily designed with power steering with no alternate. This presentation will be centered around off-highway steering needs which encompass Agricultural, Industrial, Construction, and other special purpose vehicles. 1980 SA E Transactions 801000.

Emphasis is placed on the specific problems associated with the underground mining environment. The visualization of advantages and disadvantages of both power sources emphasize the need for both diesel and electric power underground. A revolutionary development in mobile electric cable handling is disclosed. This paper will concern itself only with hard rock mining (metallic) versus non-hard rock (non-metallic coal mines). 801004. The Design and Development of the International 1400 Cotton Harvester. Jesse H. Orsborn, Inter- national Harvester Co. The International 1400 Cotton Harvester embodies productivity advancements, versatility of row crop ad- aptation unequalled in present marketed machines, and operator conveniences including electronics, improved visibility, and control location. Utilization of common cotton harvester parts was stressed in design of this machine. Thorough and extensive field testing and lab evaluation were employed to verify design goals and reliability standards. Discussion of background, estab- lishment of design requirements, and technical solutions to meet design goals are covered within. 801005. New Methods of Reducing Noise in External Gear Pumps. John Hobbs, Robert Bosch Corp. U.S.; and Hans-Juergen Fricke, Robert Bosch GmbH. The noise from external gear pumps has been significantly reduced by a new design which consists of two sets of gears, half the width of a standard gear, and offset about 1/2 pitch. The new pump makes use of a housing which is externally basically the same as a standard pump. This paper presents test stand and field measurements of the pump. 801006. A Ripple-Free Gear Pump Using Controlled Leakage. D. C. Headrick and R. K. King, Fluid Power Research Center, Oklahoma State Univ. The major source of all types of noise in hydraulic systems is usually the positive displacement pump. Fluidborne noise (pulsations) produced by the pump are particularly troublesome because almost all system components convert it into airborne noise. The most straightforward means of reducing fluidborne noise is to use a quiet pump. This paper reports the development of an external gear pump which utilizes controlled leakage to drastically reduce its flow ripple output. The theoretical basis for the technique is presented, along with an example of pump design using controlled leakage. An experimental evalu- ation is presented demonstrating the effectiveness of the technique. 1980 SA E Transactions 801007. Fluid Power System Noise Abatement - 1980. G. E. Maroney, W. H. Nichols Co., Waltham, MA. This paper discusses the motivation for fluid power noise abatement programs, establishment of program mile- stones, mathematical models for understanding and controlling fluid power system noise, guidelines for obtaining reproducible acoustical measurements, system modification techniques to achieve noise reduction, and the important role of management in the conduct of an effective noise abatement program. 801008. Marathon LeTourneau's L-1200, 22 Cubic Yard, Front End Loader. Paul L. Kelsey and Gary L. Nelson, Marathon LeTourneau Co. Extensive use of mining haulage vehicles with capacities greater than 610,000 kg (120 tons) has created the need for larger front end loaders. This paper describes the design of the L-1200 LeTro- Loader, rated at 17 m3 (22 yd.3), which incorporates an electric propulsion system integrated with an implement hydraulic system. 801009. A New Concept in Mechanical Drives - The WABCO 120 Mechanical Truck. Milton C. Neul, WABCO Construction and Mining Equipment. This paper briefly reviews the history of mine haulage trucks. It reviews productivity limitations with respect to size or speed. Changing haul requirements once again create the need for more flexible mechanical drive power transmission equipment. The new equipment however is designed to provide extended life between overhauls as compared with previous mechanical transmissions. 801012. Airside Fouling of Internal Combustion Engine Radiators. T. Cowell and D. A. Cross, COVRAD Ltd. Radiator fouling by dust has been studied experimentally for a wide range of radiator types. The results show that the hydraulic diameter of the elemental passage in the front face of the radiator is the determining factor in fouling propensity. The implication is that high per- formance louvred surfaces are the best for resistance to fouling by dust. 1980 SA E Transactions 801013. Fuel Savings and Noise Reduction with the Fan Drive. John J. Pisarski, Schwitzer, Wallace Murray Corp., Indianapolis, IN. Cooling fan engagement times were recorded on a 131</page><page sequence="113">801014-801020 front-end loader used in heavy duty operation at varying ambient temperatures to determine the effectiveness of a temperature controlled fan drive on off-highway equip- ment. The benefits of the fan drive are presented in terms of fuel savings and noise reduction. The annual fuel savings were calculated for heavy duty operation at ambient temperatures typical to the Indianapolis area. Noise performance is indicated as the percentage of total operating time that the fan speed is above a speed required to cause the fan to be a major noise contributor and the measured noise reduction during fan disen- gagement. 1980 SA E Transactions 801014. Energy Reduction - Business and Industry Challenge. Francis V. Cannon, Jr. and Richard J. Ungrodt, Milwaukee School of Engrg., Mil- waukee, WI. A discussion of energy reduction considerations includes distinguishing between energy resources (potential supplies of energy) and energy stocks (available supplies of energy). The potential of coal, nuclear fusion, and other forms of energy can result in abundant national energy stocks in the future. In many cases, however, today's needs cannot be deferred into tomorrow. With this in mind, it is evident that energy reduction practices are vital on both a long and short term basis to ensure the economic health of America and the world. 801015. Total Energy Management at International Har- vester. Thomas T. Dingo, International Har- vester Co. A comprehensive five year energy program has been implemented at International Harvester in order to alleviate or avoid the impact of future fuel problems. It is estimated that the company could realize a potential savings of $1 million per every 1% reduction in fuel consumption. The three areas to which their efforts are directed are energy awareness, conservation, and supply and strategy. 801016. The Dilemma of Nuclear Power. Pepe Rodriguez, Milwaukee School of Engineering. Advocates of nuclear power claim it offers the world a virtually unlimited source of a non-atmospheric polluting, economical energy. Opponents claim it is unsafe, environ- mentally damaging, and a threat to world stability. Without a doubt, nuclear power has been contro- versial since its conception and the Hiroshima tragedy of 1945. However, nuclear power has its place and has definite potential as an energy supply if we intend to continue our present lifestyle and further improve it technologically. 1980 SA E Transactions 801017. Remote Proportional Actuators and Their Appli- cation. Kenneth F. Frank, Dynex/Rivett Inc. Remote controllability of hydraulic components broadens their range for applications. Hydraulic system design has incorporated remote controls for years in the form of oil and air piloted, and solenoid operated valves. Where precision control is required, electrohydraulic propor- tional control is coming of age. Applications exist where a remote proportional actu- ator can provide a previously unavailable level of control. This type of actuator can be used to stroke components such as throttle controls, clutches and brakes or hydraulic pumps and high flow valves. Introduction of electronics, and microprocessors with their potential for high speed and accurate logic, when mated with this actuator, can perform sophisticated tasks. 801018. Electronic/ Hydraulic Hitch Control for Agricul- tural Tractors. John Hobbs, Robert Bosch Corp. U.S.; and H. Hesse, Robert Bosch GmbH. An electronic/hydraulic control of tractor hitch systems has been developed which makes it possible to improve control quality, increase design flexibility, and ease the operator's duties. This is accomplished by making use of the advantages that electronics brings through: - Simple measurement of displacements and forces - Avoidance of friction and hysteresis - Easy transmission of electrical signals - Simple mixing of several signals - High amplification of signals This paper describes the components and function of the system. 1980 SA E Transactions 801019.

Agricultural Tractor Chassis Suspension System for Improved Ride Comfort. Paul W. Claar, II, Wesley F. Buchele and Stephen J. Marley, Iowa State Univ.; and Pradip N. Sheth, Allis- Chalmers Corp. An exploratory concept for a chassis suspension system for improving the operator ride comfort of an agricultural tractor is presented in this paper. The first section of the paper describes the criteria and concepts that have been incorporated into the design of a hybrid leading and 132</page><page sequence="114">801021-801050 trailing arm chassis suspension system. The second section of the paper discusses the evaluation of this suspension system and its parameters by simulating nine (9) different tractor and nine (9) different tractor-plow models, derived from the various combination of suspension configura- tions and operator cab locations. A generalized mechan- ical system simulation program is utilized to predict the dynamic linear transfer function behavior of each vehicle model. With frequency domain analysis techniques and the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm, the dynamic vehicle response to the ISO 5007 Smooth Track excitation is computed. Finally, ISO 2631 and SAE J 101 3 Standards are utilized to compute comparative ride numbers and it is shown that, in theory, a suspended chassis would provide improved ride comfort. Additional design factors, which must be considered prior to a hardware development, are then summarized for future consideration. 1980 SAE Transactions 801021. Optimizing Tire/ Vehicle Relationships for Best Field Performance. Francis Charles Hausz, Fire- stone Tire &amp; Rubber Co.; and Herbert Akins, International Harvester Co. Traction performance testing has been conducted com- paring various tire combinations on a large two wheel drive farm tractor. The testing compares different size tires and dual applications of bias ply tires. It also gives a direct comparison between radial and bias ply tires in the same size. Additional testing was performed to determine fuel efficiency comparisons of the radial ply tire versus the bias ply tire. 801022. Internal Air Temperature Measurements in Tyres - A Major Advance in Earthmover Tyre Pres- sure Control. Donald M. Gordon, Otraco (In- ternational) Pty. Ltd. (Western Australia). Tyre costs constitute 20-40 per cent of the operating cost of large haulage trucks, and tyre pressure maintenance is an important factor in minimizing costs. In the past, control over the hot (built-up) pressures of earthmover tyres has been inaccurate and inconsistent because it has not been possible, in a practical way, to measure the tyre's contained air temperature. A method for measuring this contained air temper- ature has now been devised using a bi-metallic probe thermometer inserted through the valve stem. Using these measurements in conjunction with a pressure- temperature chart drawn up using the general gas equation, very accurate control over hot tyre pressures is now possible. 801023. Off-Road Vehicle Ride: Review of Concepts and Design Evaluation with Computer Simulation. Paul W. Claar, II and Wesley F. Buchele, Iowa State Univ.; and Pradip N. Sheth, Allis- Chalmers Corp. European and American suspension systems are described for improving the operator ride comfort on off-road vehicles. Analytical methods are then described to predict the dynamic behavior of a vehicle and human ride response criteria. The approach includes the selection of a terrain input to excite the vehicle model formulated by the generalized mechanical system simulation programs. An example involving an agricultural tractor-plow system is presented to illustrate the techniques. 801025. Development of Off-Road Machinery Identifi- cation Standards. Carl L. Kepner, Peoria, 111. Historically, names that have been used to identify types of off-road work machines were established by the early manufacturers and often were not very descriptive of the main purpose of the machine. SAE undertook a program to construct a logical terminology system, intended to establish names that would describe the principal work function of the machine, at the same time to select such names that would be recognized and used, or translated, in non-English using areas of the world. This SAE effort was carried forward in close coordination with a similar program in the International Standards Organization. 1980 SAE Transactions 801026. GODA5 (Gear Optimization and Design Anal- yses 5). Douglas Hughson, Ford Motor Co., Dearborn, MI. A new computerized gear system has been developed which tailors the design of parallel axis gears to their intended use. It minimizes surface stress for tractor and truck gears and maximizes contact ratio for automobile gears. It equalizes the bending fatigue time life of the pinion to gear on demand and balances the resistance to bending fatigue with the resistance to surface damage. It then designs the tools for the gears, completely analyzes the tooth action and durability characteristics, and draws the gears to any scale from any angle orthogonally or in perspective. 1980 SAE Transactions 801050. Intermodal Module Concept for Freight. Norman D. Foiling and Philip L. Peoples, Boeing Com- mercial Airplane Co. A concept is presented for a family of sturdy, lightweight, inexpensive, forkliftable freight shipping cartons for the smaller shipments, the less-than-truckload, less-than- containerload shipments making up the majority of air freight. The cartons are modular and dimensioned for transportation system efficiency and compatibility with international container and U.S. unit-load standards. Module suitability to small shippers and many trans- portation vehicles indicates potential applications and benefits could be far reaching throughout the transpor- tation system. Prototype cartons have been built for demonstration. 1980 SAE Transactions 133</page><page sequence="115">801051-801056 801051. Regional Freighter Aircraft Requirements to 1995. Robert L. Campbell and John C. Dam- horst, Lockheed-Georgia Company, Marietta, Georgia. The Lockheed-Georgia Company forecasts a worldwide requirement for over 700 new Regional Freighter Aircraft (RFA) to replace the narrow-bodied turbojet and tur- boprop all-cargo freighters currently operating in regional freighter service and to fill the additional freighter aircraft requirements projected to 1995. The study was conducted primarily through a world survey of narrow-bodied turbojet and turboprop freighters in current all-cargo operations, personal in-depth inter- views with key executives of over 70 air cargo organi- zations, a mail questionnaire to approximately 200 airlines, and an analysis of future RFA requirements based on individual carrier cargo growth rates obtained from the air carriers and related organizations. Subjects, addressed in the market surveys ranged from questions on present regional freighter operations (char- acterized as less than 1500 statute miles) to future cargo growth rates and aircraft types. Regional freighter services are currently being operated in all seven market areas; and the major operators interviewed indicated a need exists for a dedicated all-cargo aircraft with the following general characteristics: o Compatibility with wide-bodied freighter aircraft and future standard ULD's such as the M-2 Intermodal Air Container o Operating costs lower than existing freighter aircraft on RFA segments o Maximum revenue payload capability of 50,000 pounds o Maximum payload-range capability of approxi- mately 1500 statute miles o Average on-board density of nine pounds per cubic foot o Compliance with present and proposed government regulations. 1980 SA E Transactions 801052. Joint Civil/Military Cargo Aircraft: Prospects and Current Perceptions. William T. Mikolowsky and William A. Garrett, Lockheed-Georgia Company. The ACMA (Advanced Civil/Military Aircraft) is con- ceived as an advanced technology transport aircraft designed from the outset with the potential for fulfilling both the U.S. need for military strategic airlift and the worldwide need for commercial airfreight in the 1990s and beyond. The ACMA, initially called the C-XX, was first described in 1974, and is the subject of a Military Airlift Command Statement of Operational Need (SON) pub- lished in 1979. Evidence of the corresponding civil need for a large payload, long range cargo transport has been supplied by the NASA sponsored Cargo Logistics Airlift System Studies (CLASS). The recent preconceptual studies of the ACMA which examine both the technical and institutional issues affecting a joint program indicate that there are no significant obstacles to developing a single, basic configuration, or in administering such a venture. Current Lockheed-Georgia design studies suggest that the ACMA can provide a 30 to 40 percent reduction in direct operating costs and as much as a 50 percent improvement in fuel efficiency compared to contemporary commercial cargo aircraft. 801053.

The Airport as Distribution Center: Viewpoint of a Developing Country. M. K. Bajpai, Interna- tional Airports Authority of India. Besides providing aeronautical services and facilitating passengers, airports to-day are acquiring a new dimension by becoming distribution centers. In the coming decade the airports of developing countries have to devote special care to fulfilling their commercial role. With the financial support of the neighbourhood community, they have to promote themselves. Air cargo would be increasingly containerized and would require mechanical handling. Physical facilities for handling cargo would need expan- sion. Quicker processing of cargo and computer appli- cation would help. 801055. The Airport as a Distribution Center. D. R. A. Stapel, Amsterdam Airport, Schiphol. The air cargo industry is an important link in the trade and transport chain. The airport and its relationship with air cargo fills a basic need in the chain. This paper outlines the service an airport provides to the air cargo industry. 801056. Expedited Small Package Services. Werner K. Loepfe, Swissair. Small package systems have become an important part of day-to-day business activities. Originated in the United States, they are today available internationally. Apart from scheduled airlines, freight forwarders and courier services are in this market to a degree never seen before. Still, Swissair is today the only international scheduled airline offering an ultrafast small package system covering a wide geographic area, priced at a flatrate which includes all customs formalities and delivery to the consignee's doorstep as standard product components. This "SPEX" (Swissair Parcel Express) service is today offered both ways between about 10,000 communities in the United 134</page><page sequence="116">801057-801064 States and some 37 cities with their surrounding towns and villages in Europe and the Middle East. SPEX is continually being expanded to and from additional points on many continents. 801057. Time Structured Rates: An Alternative to Spe- cific Commodity Rates. W. H. Clarke, Trans World Airlines, Inc. Air carriers, especially on North Atlantic routes, tra- ditionally have used specific commodity rates as the primary rating device for air cargo transportation. This technique has not been successful in segregating traffic to provide cost-related rates for commodities with varying transportation and handling characteristics. Some air cargo users and government agencies have suggested replacement of specific commodity rates by offering shippers a choice of rates depending upon the level of service provided, such as premium rates for emergency traffic, standard rates for routine air traffic, and low rates for developmental traffic. In April of 1979, Trans World Airlines replaced specific commodity rates with time-structured rates from the United Kingdom to the United States. This new rate structure has been successful, not only in simplifying the application of air cargo tariffs, but in generating new traffic for air services. 801058. Air Cargo Market Outlook and Impact Via the NASA Class Project. Matthew M. Winston and D. William Conner, National Aeronautics &amp; Space Administration, Langley Research Center. An overview is given of the Cargo/Logistics Airlift Systems Study (CLASS) project. CLASS was a 10 manyear effort carried out by two contractor teams, aimed at defining factors impacting future system growth and obtaining market requirements and design guidelines for future airfreighters. Surveys of hundreds of major shippers, airframe manufacturers, airlines, freight for- warders, and government organizations afford a com- prehensive view of the present system and its growth into the next century. Growth projection was estimated by two approaches: one, an optimal systems approach with a more efficient and cost-effective system considered as being available in 1990; and the other, an evolutionary approach with an econometric behavior model used to predict long-term evolution from the present system. Both approaches predict significant growth in demand for international airfreighter services and less growth for U.S. domestic services. Economic analyses of airfreighter fleet options indicate very strong market appeal of derivative widebody transports in 1990 with little incentive to develop all-new dedicated airfreighters utilizing the 1990's technology until sometime beyond the year 2000. Ad- vanced airfreighters would be economically attractive for a wide range of payload sizes (to 500 metric tons), however, if a government would share in the RD and T costs by virtue of its need for a slightly modified version of a civil airfreighter design (e.g. military airlifter). 1980 SA E Transactions 801059. Joint Civil/Military Transport Studies - An Overview. Larry W. Noggle and Charles E. Jobe, Wright-Patterson AFB. The requirement for increased airlift capability is now documented in the Hq. Military Airlift Command State- ment of Operational Need. Many studies were conducted to investigate the alternative solutions proposed to meet this need, both in terms of operational concepts and unconventional fuels and configuration. Preliminary results indicate that a joint Civil/Military transport aircraft of conventional configuration and fuel is the most cost effective means to satisfy the increased airlift need. Maximum utilization of advanced technology and gov- ernment/industry cooperation will be required to achieve the economic incentives necessary to successfully accom- plish this joint aircraft program. 801060. Freighter Network Analysis Model. James C. Goodboy and James G. Gilbertson, Boeing Commercial Airplane Co. The Boeing Commercial Airplane Company has devel- oped a freighter network analysis model that can be used for planning and scheduling a fleet of freighter airplanes. The model incorporates both LP and heuristic algorithms and permits the user to determine the maximum profit (scheduled) fleet size, for a given network, set of origin/destination demands, aircraft mix and utilizations, within the limitations of the assumptions and approxi- mations incorporated in the model. The model permits extensive trade studies and sensitivity analyses to be performed with improved accuracy and reduced effort compared to other alternatives. 1 980 SA E Transactions 801064. Flatbed - A Unique and Versatile Transport Airplane. Rollo G. Smethers, Lockheed-Georgia Co. Flatbed is a unique aircraft and configurational concept featuring versatility of payloads which are carried on an open cargo floor; there is no fuselage per se. Flatbed can haul containers, passengers in a removable module, or outsize cargoes and vehicles. Large commercial or army vehicles are literally carried "in the open." Studies have shown the technical and economic feasibility of the Flatbed concept and show reduced terminal turnaround time. Further analysis indicates: (1) significant improve- ment in "Quick Change" operations, (2) solution to problems involving convertibility to military operations, and (3) potential new markets for cargo airlines as well as reduced distribution costs for shippers. 1980 SA E Transactions 135</page><page sequence="117">801065-801073 801065. Airbus Industrie's Approach to the Wide-Body Freighter Aircraft Concept. Peter C. Schoonens, Airbus Industrie (France). Going back into the history of the A300 aircraft, it is relevant to note that the fuselage diameter was a major design criteria. Especially with the thought in mind that the aircraft was to become a transportation vehicle subjected to interline traffic, its compatibility with already defined Unit Load Devices suitable for the other wide- body aircraft, had to be ensured. This was achieved, with the result that the basic A300 and all its direct family members have a fuselage diameter which also permits direct development of efficient freight- er aircraft. The paper will show the freighter variants Airbus Industrie is presently developing on a firm commitment basis, and projected ones, together with the market slots they will fill. 801066. Major Developments in Airfreight and Baggage Handling - Second Generation Mobile Han- dling Equipment for the Eighties - The Listavia LA. PD. 22. System. Warren S. Lister, Listavia Ltd. (England). This paper deals with the surveys carried out by the author's company during the last three years, on the shortcomings of existing tractor trailer cargo and baggage handling equipment on Airports, the results of those surveys and the criteria so produced for the design of a new method of handling air cargo. The paper describes in general terms the resulting system, now known as the LA PD 22 roll trailer system, and makes comparisons with the first generation equip- ment it is intended to replace, and highlights some significant contributions in terms of cost savings, safety and increased efficiency that can be made by using well planned handling methods. Mr. Lister also covers the increased safety aspects of the new system, which is intended to improve the working conditions of baggage and cargo handlers on airport aprons. 801068. Control of Unit Load Devices. P. D. Cleave, International Air Transport Assn. The control of ULDs (containers) in an airline has important cost, commercial, and operational implications. To produce maximum efficiency in all these areas, control should therefore be exercised at a management level. Customers need containers of the right type, in the right place, at the right time,- and that means ULDs must be under control. The efficient circulation of equipment depends on an effective in-house control system, on an industry (IATA) identification code and ULD markings, and on an interline control. The interline control is provided by the IATA ULD Control Centre and this will expand as more airlines operate wide-body containerised aircraft. 801069. A New Kind of Total Systems Approach to Air Cargo: AN INDUSTRY IS BORN. Stephen Z. Serepca, Americas Region, CTI-Container Transport International, Inc., New York - U.S.A. An examination of the development of intermodal air/surface containerization based to a large extent on the lessons gained in marine containerization and how this experience has transferred to the new opportunities that are apparent for air shippers. The paper examines the history and growing sophistication of air/surface con- tainer leasing and how the concept of high-service leasing can be readily applied to air cargo carriers and shippers. A detailed rationale for service-oriented leases spells out the benefits for air shippers who deal with leasing companies including the availability of quality containers; flexibility in acquiring additional containers when re- quired; interchangeability with other pool customers; and easing of the burdens of container control, maintenance, repair and administration. 801070. Energy Conservation, Aircraft Noise, and the Bottom Line. Lloyd B. Aschenbeck, CAMMA- CORP. The established distribution system is in the process of being restructured to combat the effects of high cost energy, inflation and environmental restrictions. As a part of this system, the air freight industry, also, must re-examine its options in equipment, energy reduction, financial risk and services offered. In the area of investment and energy reduction a cost effective solution is already available. That is, equip a portion of the existing cargo fleet with new technology, quiet, fuel efficient engines. Ten airlines have stepped up to this solution and are re-engining their fleets of DC8 aircraft with CFM56 engine. 801071. What is the Animal Air Transportation Asso- ciation? Glenn E.

This paper deals with the history of the air transport of animals, of the efforts by various organizations to help resolve some of the problems, and of the birth and development of a unique organization to deal with all aspects of animal transport problems, the Animal Air Transportation Association (A AT A). The capabilities of A AT A largely are due to the breadth of membership, which includes unlimited expertise in every phase and area of concern in this vital global industry. 801073. Proposed Gander/ Mainland Canada Air Cargo Bridge. R. Stanley Wallace, R. S. Wallace &amp; Assoc. Ltd. (Ontario, Canada); and John P. Braaksma, Carleton Univ. (Ontario, Canada). The feasibility of developing a containerized combination air/truck freight distribution system linking mainland 136</page><page sequence="118">801074-801116 Canada and the island province of Newfoundland is examined in this report. The viable components of the operation consist of: a truck pick-up and distribution system linking the ship- per/consignee to the air cargo terminals, either a com- bination "full service" or a container terminal at the airports, and a fleet combination of B-747F and L-100 air freighters carrying truck/air intermodal 8 ' X 8 ' X 10' and 20' containers. On the Island, one central distribution point at Gander, is located approximately at mid point on the Island's 500 mile long central highway. Here a combination air/truck terminal is developed. The trucks pick-up and deliver cargo along the highway serving approximately 90% of the Island's population with a next day delivery service. The proposed new service can be profitable charging trucking rates. 801074. Analysis of Materials-Handling Equipment for Lower Lobes of Wide-Bodied Aircraft. Paul D. Tuck, Office of the Assistant Chief of Staff, Studies and Analyses, HQ US Air Force, Washington, DC. This paper deals with materials-handling equipment (MHE) for loading/offloading the lower lobes of wide- bodied aircraft and the capacity of the lower lobes. The advances and development of transport aircraft have historically outdistanced complementary ground systems. For example, Air Force-owned loaders used for military aircraft do not interface properly with wide-bodied lower lobes, as accessibility is difficult. Quarter-ton trucks and Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE) are representative of equipment size that is practicable for movement via wide-bodied lower lobes. Potential exists for greater use of this airlift capability in the future by fine-tuning mobility planning and modernization of MHE. 1980 SA E Transactions 801100. Effect of Mixed Phosphate Ester Fluids on Aircraft Hydraulic Servo Valve Erosion. T. R. Beck, Electrochemical Technology Corp., Seattle, Washington; and J. F. Curulla, B. C. Hainline, A. Lauba and D. C. Sullivan, Boeing Commercial Airplane Company. Commercial airlines use a variety of hydraulic fluid mixtures, some of which had been reported to cause increased valve erosion. An extensive test program was conducted to determine why certain mixtures of aircraft phosphate ester hydraulic fluids cause erosiveness in valves while others have negligible effect. Use of nonero- sive mixtures is important to the aircraft industry to reduce the high cost of maintenance caused by erosion. Accelerated tests were conducted to identify erosive and nonerosive mixtures of presently available fluids. Chem- ical tests were conducted with a matrix of test fluids to establish methods that will predict the effects measured in erosion tests. Erosiveness of fluid mixtures can now be predicted by means of two laboratory measured electro- chemical properties; wall current and threshold corrosion current density. This paper discusses the theory of electrochemical erosion, describes the tests conducted to classify erosion characteristics of fluid mixtures and describes the laboratory test methods that can be used to identify the erosion potential of mixtures. 1980 SA E Transactions 801101. Cost Benefits of Nonmetallic Spline Couplings. Harry W. Brown and J. Ted Miller, ARINC Research Corp. Spline couplings utilizing the one-piece, nonmetallic bushing concept (MS 14169) have completed over a decade of laboratory and flight certification on military aircraft. Developed specifically to improve drive spline reliability on engine-mounted accessories, these couplings have proven effective in reducing aircraft operating costs and downtime. Faced with rising operating costs and competitive pressures, the airline industry must continually investigate alternative design modifications to equipments and systems. Airline engineers often employ payback period analyses to gauge the cost-effectiveness and financial impact of a proposed modification. This paper reviews nonmetallic spline technology and examines a typical hydraulic pump-drive spline- wear problem on JT3D and JT8D commercial aircraft engines. The analysis is based on a Net Present Value (NPV) approach, which considers both inflated and discounted cash flow. Maintenance cost analyses are presented and payback values are calculated by comparing unmodified and modified spline couplings. Key parameters affecting payback period, such as non- metallic spline cost and reliability, are also described. 801110. The F100 Engine. Lanny T. G.

Through the use of advanced engineering design and material technologies, the high thrust-to-weight ratio of these engines enable our newest tactical fighters to maintain significant performance advantages when com- pared to Soviet fighter aircraft. The modular design of the engine also provides benefits during intermediate and depot level maintenance. Ongoing development programs continue to improve engine performance and component durability. 801116. Improved Components for Engine Fuel Savings. Robert J. Antl and John E.

The other part is Performance Improvement, which is directed at development of component technolo- gies to reduce the fuel consumption of CF6, JT9D and JT8D engines. This paper discusses the Performance Improvement part. Nine of sixteen concepts being developed under the ECI project are now complete and four are in service. The remaining five are being offered to the airlines. Earlier feasibility studies have established their technical and economical acceptability and tests have demonstrated their fuel saving potential. Descrip- tions of these concepts, results of testing, and the status as to entering airline service are presented. Also presented is the status of the remaining concepts still under devel- opment. 1980 SA E Transactions 801117. JT8D Performance Improvement to Offset Rising Fuel Costs. Robert K.

Retrofit kit programs for existing in-service engines and major new engine programs have evolved from this effort which has been underway since 1978. Changes are being made to the fan, compressor, and turbine sections of the various engine models to improve component efficiency levels and significantly decrease engine thrust specific fuel consumption. Retrofit packages will provide thrust specific fuel consumption reduction of 2.1 percent for JT8D-1 and -7 engines, 3.0 percent for JT8D-9 engines, and 5.5 percent for JT8D-15, -17 and -17R engines at cruise conditions. Fuel savings at other conditions are comparable. 801118. Performance Deterioration of Commercial High- Bypass Ratio Turbofan Engines. Charles M. Mehalic and Joseph A. Ziemiański, NASA, Lewis Research Center, Cleveland, OH. The Aircraft Energy Efficiency Program within NASA is developing technology required to improve the fuel efficiency of commercial subsonic transport aircraft. One segment of this program, the Engine Component Im- provement (ECI) Project, includes Engine Diagnostics which is directed toward determining the sources and causes of performance deterioration in the Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft JT9D and General Electric CF6 high- bypass ratio turbofan engines and developing technology for minimizing the performance losses. This paper presents the results of engine performance deterioration investigations based on historical data, special engine tests, and specific tests to define the influence of flight loads and component clearances on performance. The results of analyses of several damage mechanisms that contribute to performance deterioration such as blade tip rubs, airfoil surface roughness and erosion, and thermal distortion are also included. The significance of these damage mechanisms on component and overall engine performance is discussed. 801119. A Status Report on the Energy Efficient Engine Project. Lawrence E. Macioce, John W. Schaefer and Neal T. Saunders, National Aer- onautics and Space Administration, Lewis Re- search Center, Cleveland, OH. The Energy Efficient Engine (E3) Project is directed at providing, by 1984, the advanced technologies which could be used for a new generation of fuel conservative turbofan engines. The project is conducted by NASA through contracts with the General Electric Company and Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft. This paper summarizes the scope of the entire project and the current status of these efforts. Included is a description of the preliminary designs of the fully developed engines, the potential benefits of these advanced engines, and highlights of some of the component technology efforts conducted to date. 801120. The NASA High-Speed Turboprop Program. James F. Dugan, Brent A. Miller, Edwin J. Graber and David A. Sagerser, NASA Lewis Research Center, Cleveland, OH. NASA's Advanced Turboprop Project is a three phased effort initiated in 1978 to provide technology readiness for Mach 0.7 to 0.8 turboprop-powered aircraft with the potential for fuel savings and DOC reductions of up to 30 and 15 percent respectively relative to current in-service aircraft. This paper reviews the status of Phase I in the areas of propeller aeroacoustics, propeller structures, turboprop installed performance, aircraft cabin environ- ment, and turboprop engine and aircraft studies. Current plans to establish large-scale propeller characteristics and to conduct high-speed propeller flight research tests using a modified testbed aircraft are also presented. 1980 SA E Transactions 801121. A Review of the Installation, Performance and Economic Aspects of a High Altitude Facility for Small Gas Turbines. Gerald Koury, Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft of Canada Ltd. A new facility to simulate altitude conditions for small gas turbine engines has been designed, installed and operated at the National Research Council of Canada by Pratt &amp; Whitney of Canada. The facility can simulate the pressures and temperatures associated with altitudes up to 40,000 feet, and forward speeds of up to a mach number of .7. The main feature of this facility, is that it reduces altitude testing, operating costs, as well as providing "test cell quality" performance results. These aforementioned aspects of the facility are 138</page><page sequence="120">801122-801128 reviewed along with the facility's operational features and capabilities. 801122. Description of the Warm Core Turbine Facility and the Warm Annular Cascade Facility Recently Installed at NASA Lewis Research Center. Warren J. Whitney, Roy G. Stabe and Thomas P. Moffitt, NASA Lewis Research Center, Cleveland, OH. The two new facilities have been installed and operated at their design or rated conditions. The important feature of both of these facilities is that the ratio of turbine inlet temperature to coolant temperature encountered in high temperature engines can be duplicated at moderate turbine inlet temperature. Included in the discussion are the limits of the facilities with regard to maximum temperature, maximum pressure, maximum mass flow rate, turbine size, and dynamometer torque-speed char- acteristics. 801124. A Forward Look at Gas Turbine Testing Facil- ities. W. L. Webb, United Technologies Corp., West Palm Beach, FL. High thrust-to-weight gas turbine engine development experience has shown that future testing facilities must be more complex and have increased capability. This paper defines the requirements for such facilities and the parameters that generate them. These test facilities include hardware, support services, and performance assurance capability required to meet future needs. Comparisons are made between military specification and currently per- ceived contractor testing requirements for gas turbine engines, rotating components, and accessories to meet future military procurement expectations, along with the influence of development instrumentation measurement uncertainty. 801125. Applications of Structural Dynamics Modifica- tion. Mark R. Herbert and Donald W. Kientzy, Structural Measurement Systems, Inc., Santa Clara, CA. The use of Structural Dynamics Modification (SDM) for determining changes in the dynamic characteristics of mechanical structures due to changes in their mass, stiffness, or damping properties, is presented. SDM requires as input the modal properties of the unmodified structure, which can be obtained either from a modal test or from finite element analysis. Structural modifications are then modeled as the addition (or removal) of mass, stiffness, or damping to the structure, and the resulting modal properties of the modified structure are deter- mined. This same procedure can also be used to model the connection of two or more substructures, or the attach- ment of "tuned" vibration absorbers to a structure, and it predicts the new dynamic properties of the modified structure or coupled substructures. 1980 SA E Transactions 801126. Utilizing Modal Testing in System Analysis to Affect Design and Predict Structural Perform- ance. Stephen A. Beck, Ralph D. Brillhart, David L. Hunt and John Van Benschoten, Structural Dynamics Research Corp., Western Operations, San Diego, CA. Dynamic performance has become a significant criterion in the design and evaluation of structures. In this paper an integrated approach of modal testing and system analysis is described which gives the engineer a useful tool to effect design modifications and to predict structural perform- ance. This approach can be used for redesign of existing systems or the development of new structures. A specific application of the method is described which involves the troubleshooting and redesign of a material processing machine which was yielding substandard product. 801127. Measurement of Tube/Tube Support Clearance via Induced Vibration Analysis. Don C. Barrett, Terry D. Scharton and Charles C. Kidd, ANCO Engineers, Inc. A number of nuclear power plant steam generators have been troubled with corrosion buildup between the tubes and supporting plates. A vibration type probe which traverses the interior of the tubes during plant shutdown has been developed to inspect the tube and support crevices. The probe incorporates a miniature electric vibrator and accelerometers to induce and measure tube motion at the support plate junctions. Laboratory inves- tigation indicates that clearance gaps ranging from 1 to 30 mils can be accurately and rapidly measured even in the presence of tube misalignment and varied tube support conditions. The probe system is also suited to in-situ measurements of heat exchanger tube vibration charac- teristics. 1980 SA E Transactions 801128. Dynamic Testing and Acoustic Analysis of Con- crete Dams. M. W. Dobbs, R. S. Keowen, R. E. Cooper, Jr., K. D. Blakely and P. A. Martinez, ANCO Engineers, Inc., Santa Monica, CA. Forced vibration tests of Pacoima Dam were performed as part of a continuing research effort for dam integrity monitoring. The results of these tests are presented including measured resonant frequencies and response shapes, estimated modal damping ratios, and measured acoustic emission properties. The goal of this research is to develop a field portable test method for damage and integrity assessment of concrete dams. In this method, the dynamic properties and the acoustic emission properties of dams are mon- itored to detect and locate arch and foundation defects. Comparison of the dynamic properties obtained in the present tests to dynamic properties obtained in tests performed shortly after the 1971 San Fernando earth- quake tentatively confirm that gross structural changes can be detected. 139</page><page sequence="121">801130-801136 801130. Variability Associated with Seismic Testing Methods. R. Vasudevan and R. Campbell, Engineering Decision Analysis Co, Inc., Palo Alto, CA. Safety related nuclear power plant systems and com- ponents are qualified for seismic adequacy by analysis, tests, or a combination of both. These seismic qualifi- cation methods are biased towards the conservative side due to the variability associated with the inherent randomness in the phenomenon being simulated and those related to the incomplete knowledge about the simulation. Major sources of variability in the test method of qualification are addressed and their approximate variations are enumerated. These variations are useful in assessing the overall conservatism and in estimating the probabilistic strength capacity of equipment. 1980 SA E Transactions 801131. The All-Electric Airplane as an Energy Efficient Transport. Michael J. Cronin, Lockheed-Cali- fornia Co. The concern for energy conservation and the escalating fuel costs threaten to impact adversely on the economic viability of the aerospace industry. This paper discusses the role of the All-Electric Airplane in assuaging the problems of fuel costs; it also evaluates the ability of an all-electric secondary power system to take over the functions and services historically in the province of the hydraulic and pneumatic systems. 801132. Air Transport Flight Parameter Measurements Program - Concepts and Benefits. Garland J. Morris and Norman L. Crabill, NASA Langley Research Center. A program is described in which statistical flight loads and operating practice data for airline transports in current operations are obtained from existing onboard digital flight data recorders. These data, primarily intended for use by manufacturers in updating design criteria, were obtained from narrow-body and wide-body jets. Unique procedures developed for editing and proces- sing the data are discussed and differences from previous NACA/NASA VGH analog data are noted. The program is being expanded to include control surface and ground- operational parameters. Efforts to develop an onboard data processing system to derive direct statistical aircraft operating parameters are reviewed. 801133. Fog Dispersion. Walter Frost, F WG Associates, Tullahoma, TN; Larry S. Christensen, Sverdrup/ARO, Inc., Arnold Air Force Station, TN; Frank G. Collins, The University of Tennessee Space Institute, Tullahoma, TN; and Dennis W. Camp, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Marshall Space Flight Center, AL. Techniques of dispersing warm fog operationally at commercial airports are reviewed. The charged particle technique is emphasized. Experiments and analytical studies previously carried out to prove the charge particle fog dispersal system concept are described. Disagreements between existing theories are identified and to the extent possible resolved. Experimental and analytical work necessary to fully establish the viability of the charged particle technique for aviation operations are outlined. Finally, a simple cost comparison between the thermal systems and charged particle systems is made. 1980 SA E Transactions 801134. Methods for the Verification and Validation of Digital Flight Control Systems. William E. Larsen, Federal Aviation Administration, Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA. Maturing technology and cost savings have made digital systems increasingly attractive to commercial aviation. Taking this opportunity, the major jet transport manu- facturers are offering digital mechanized flight control and avionics systems on their new and derivative models. Although there exists a consensus within industry that the essential assurance technology is available, there is a lack of government criteria and experience for the best way to proceed in the certification of digital systems. As a result, NASA and FAA, with assistance from industry, have developed a program to improve the government's understanding of airborne digital systems assurance technology, and to evaluate and improve the tools and methods of this technology. A near-term, representative digital flight control system will be utilized to evaluate the tools and methods that are developed. A series of workshops and symposiums are being held to keep the government and industry apprised of this work. 801135. Loss Model for Off-Design Performance Analysis of Radial Turbines with Pivoting- Vane, Variable- Area Stators. Peter L. Meitner, Propulsion Laboratory, AVRADCOM Research and Tech- nology Laboratories, Lewis Research Center; and Arthur J. Glassman, Lewis Research Center, Cleveland, OH. An off-design performance loss model is developed for variable-area (pivoted vane) radial turbines. The variation in stator loss with stator area is determined by a viscous loss model while the variation in rotor loss due to stator area variation (for no stator end-clearance gap) is determined through analytical matching of experimental data. An incidence loss model is also based on matching of the experimental data. A stator vane end-clearance leakage model is developed and sample calculations are made to show the predicted effects of stator vane end-clearance leakage on performance. 801136. An Experimental and Theoretical Investigation of a Twin-Entry Radial Flow Turbine under Non- Steady Flow Conditions. M. Farrashkhalvat and 140</page><page sequence="122">801137-801141 P. C. Baruah, University of Manchester, Insti- tute of Science and Technology, (Manchester/England). One of the methods of representing a turbocharger- turbine in the exhaust system of internal combustion engines is by assuming quasi-steady flow at turbine boundaries, while taking into account the generation of pressure waves both upstream and downstream of the turbine due to non-steady flow conditions. This method relies substantially on steady flow turbine characteristics for the generation of boundary conditions. A method is presented to allow for wave action both upstream and downstream of a twin-entry radial inflow turbine. The method also allows for different flow rates in each entry to simulate the partial admission condition. Comparison is made between experimental results and theoretical analysis. 801137. An Experimental Evaluation of the Performance Deficit of an Aircraft Engine Starter Turbine. Jeffrey E. Haas, AVRADCOM Research and Technology Laboratories; Richard J. Roelke, NASA-Lewis Research Center, Cleveland, OH; and Paul Hermann, Sundstrand Corporation, Rockford, IL. An experimental investigation was made at NASA-Lewis Research Center to determine the reasons for the low aerodynamic performance of a 13.5-centimeter-tip-di- ameter aircraft engine starter turbine. The investigation consisted of an evaluation of both the stator and the stage. An approximate ten percent improvement in turbine efficiency was obtained when the honeycomb shroud over the rotor blade tips was filled to obtain a solid shroud surface. 801138. Composite Wall Concept for High-Temperature Turbine Shrouds - Heat Transfer Analysis. Law- rence P. Ludwig and Francis S. Stępka, NASA- Lewis Research Center, Cleveland, OH. A heat transfer analysis was made of a composite wall shroud consisting of a ceramic thermal barrier layer bonded to a porous metal layer which, in turn, is bonded to a metal base. The porous metal layer serves to mitigate the strain differences between the ceramic and the metal base. Various combinations of ceramic and porous metal layer thicknesses and of porous metal densities and thermal conductivities were investigated to determine the layer thicknesses required to maintain a limiting temper- ature in the porous metal layer. Analysis showed that the composite wall offered significant air cooling flow reductions compared to an all-impingement air-cooled all-metal shroud. 801139. Optimum Subsonic, High- Angle-of- Attack Nacelles. Roger W. Luidens, Norbert O. Stock- man and James H. Diedrich, National Aero- nautics and Space Administration, Lewis Re- search Center, Cleveland, OH. Many proposed advanced aircraft - but especially tilt- nacelle, subsonic-cruise, V/STOL aircraft - require nacelles that operate over a wide range of aerodynamic conditions. The optimum design of such nacelles and their inlets is described, including how the inlet low-speed design conditions are selected, the conditions for which the various regions of the inlet are designed, and appropriate criteria of merit. For low-speed operation the optimum internal surface velocity distributions and skin friction distributions are described for three categories of inlets: those without boundary-layer control (BLC), those with BLC, and those with blow-in door slots and retractable slats. Experimental results are presented that show the performance of the various types of inlets. At cruise speed the effect of factors that reduce the nacelle external surface area and the local skin friction is illustrated. These factors are cruise Mach number, inlet throat size, fan-face Mach number, and nacelle contour. The interrelation of these cruise-speed factors with the design requirements for good low-speed performance is discussed. Finally an inlet design without BLC and an optimized inlet design with slots and slats are compared to illustrate the possible reductions in nacelle size. 1980 SA E Transactions 801140. Future Challenges in V/STOL Flight Propulsion Control Integration. S. P. Roth and R. J. Miller, Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft Group, West Palm Beach, FL; and J. Mihaloew, NASA Lewis Research Center, Cleveland, OH. During the late 1970's many innovative aircraft and high performance propulsion systems were conceived as viable solutions to the Navy V/STOL requirements. Concur- rently, profound changes, driven by microprocessor technology, are taking place in the fields of flight and propulsion controls. The U.S. Navy and NASA are pursuing a control concept definition program to inves- tigate the basic changes in flight and propulsion control design rationale, criteria and methodology needed to take maximum advantage of these advancements in electronic control technology. The initial step of this program reviewed the V/STOL propulsion control technology status and the generic technical issues. This paper discusses the challenges presented by an advanced V/STOL flight and propulsion control system and an approach to developing the technology needed for this system. 801141. A Comparison of Propulsion Systems for V/STOL Supersonic Combat Aircraft. W. J. Lewis and P. Simpkin, Rolls-Royce Ltd. Three lift/propulsion concepts for a V/STOL supersonic combat aircraft have been compared. The intention was to show the effect of the propulsion system on aircraft weight 141</page><page sequence="123">801142-801147 and size, performance, and life cycle costs for: 1 Vectored thrust with Plenum Chamber Burning (bypass air augmentation) 2 Lift engines and a lift/cruise reheated turbofan 3 A reheated lift/cruise turbofan with a remote augmented lift system (RALS) For a postulated deck-launched intercept mission, the vectored thrust propulsion system with Plenum Chamber Burning gives the smallest and cheapest aircraft having the required performance. In addition, for a given takeoff ground run the vectored thrust powered aircraft has the longest fighter escort mission radius. 801142. Development and Applications of MIL-STD- 1553. Al Crossgrove, Boeing Military Airplane Co., Seattle, WA. MIL-STD-1553, Aircraft Internal Time Division Com- mand/Response Multiplex Data Bus, is a military stan- dard which has become one of the basic standardization tools being used by the DOD for avionic interfaces. The standard describes the method of communication and the electrical interface requirements for devices using this standard. The 1 Mbps serial communication bus is the prime integration scheme for electronic devices in military avionics today. This paper addresses the application of the standard to military avionic integrations, describes the scope of the standard, the technical issues resolved in selecting the particular approach, and describes several military avionic examples using the standard. 801144. A Multiplexed Digital Voice Intercommunica- tions System for Military Applications. Richard F. Bolt and Barry D. Sanderson, Naval Avionics Center. The design and development of a digital voice Intercom- munications System (ICS) for military platforms is described in this paper. The system, which is being developed as part of the NAVAIRSYSCOM's Avionics Components and Subsystem (AVCS) program, is based on the MIL-STD-1553 protocol and utilizes commercially available voice digitization components. The bus archi- tecture is intended for use as an integrated radio control arrangement in which a single data bus system carries both digital voice and radio control data. This ICS offers a quantum increase in the capability and flexibility available to the weapon system manager as well as a decided cost reduction in the future reconfigura- tion of weapon system platforms. Projections indicate this ICS design will provide a 30% reduction in volume and a 60% reduction in power in comparison with existing analog systems. Additionally the use of modular functions in the design makes Built-in-Test techniques more effective than previously possible with existing ICS architectures. 801145. The Evolution of Fiber Optics in Avionics. Charles R. Husbands, The MITRE Corp., Philip Currier, General Dynamics Corp.; and David R. Porter, ITT Electro-optical Products. Fiber optics was first proposed for communications in July 1966. Since that time commercial and military programs have evolved fiber optics to a state where practical and economically competitive systems are being implemented. This paper explores the development of fiber-optic components and systems in aircraft. The major benefits of a fiber-optic system are presented, highlighting less obvious features such as reduced susceptibilities to nuclear phenomena and electromagnetic compatibility. A survey of contracted and independent programs in industry is presented that shows those areas where feasibility and proof-of-concept in airborne systems has been demonstrated. The evolution of fiber-optic stan- dardization is also presented, and shows how an effort is being made to confine the direction of fiber-optic systems without excluding technological advances. 801146. IMUX: High Speed Communications Bus. James P. Gross, Samuel L. Broadhead and Jerry D. Moore, Government Div., SCI Systems, Inc., Huntsville, AL. The Information Multiplex (IMUX) bus is a high speed serial data bus used on military airborne and ground transportable communications systems. A contention protocol is used to provide simplified bus management, i.e., no central controller, fast access for bus users, speed expansion up to 20 Mbits/sec, and system configuration flexibility required in these applications. A hardware fabrication and testing program which demonstrates concept feasibility is described. Results of a computer simulation study reveal bus utilizations up to 95% of maximum bit rates, transmission delay times of less than 1 ms, and stable bus operation. 1980 SA E Transactions 801147. The GTCP331 Auxiliary Power Unit for the Next Generation Commercial Transports. Robert E. Wells and Aldo L. Romanin, AiResearch Mfg. Co. of Arizona, Phoenix, A Z. The Model GTCP331 Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) is designed to meet the stringent demands of the next generation of commercial jet transports. The APU provides compressed air for cabin air conditioning, main engine starting, standby hydraulic power (via a turbo- pump) and inflight anti-icing, as well as electrical power for both ground and flight operation. The GTCP331 will provide low cost of ownership, fuel efficiency and environmentally pleasing operation in the new Airbus A.300/A.310 and Boeing 767/757 aircraft. This paper presents information related to various aspects of the GTCP331 APU program. Specifically, data related to the configuration and power class selection, propulsion engine heritage design details, and devel- opment highlights are presented. The interrelationship of the APU to other aircraft systems and the role of the APU 142</page><page sequence="124">801148-801154 digital Controller in assuring efficient and safe operation are discussed. 1980 SA E Transactions 801148. The High Performance Auxiliary Power Unit Technology Demonstrator Program. Everett A. Lake, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, OH; William Green, AVCO Lycoming Div., Strat- ford, CT ; and Paul Letourneau, Sundstrand Corp., Rockford, IL. This advanced development program was built upon component technologies available at various levels of development at the time of its initiation. It was through modification of this essentially proven hardware that program risk and cost were minimized. The High Performance Auxiliary Power Unit (HPAPU) is based upon a modified Avco Lycoming 101 series gas turbine engine. The engine serves to drive a Sundstrand model 600D19CZ load compressor and model 60EG01 A-C generator through a Sundstrand gearbox adapted for the purpose. The resulting 500 hp class auxiliary power unit has successfully met or surpassed its required demonstration of duty cycles, continuous full power operation, and the ability to function over a wide environmental envelope. In addition, the HPAPU has exhibited a specific fuel consumption less than design and much less than the program's designated maximum allowable. This paper describes the HPAPU system. Charac- teristics which enhance its durability and maintainability are discussed. Performance data are presented which validate its capability from -70°F to +135°F and from sea level to 25,000 feet pressure altitude. 801149. Development Requirements for Integrated Air- craft Power Systems. S. W. Mitnik and L. W. Norman, AiResearch Manufacturing Company of Arizona, A Division of The Garrett Corpo- ration, Phoenix, Arizona. Future military aircraft will demand greater operational capability from lighter weight and more durable power systems. The historical development approach has been inadequate in assessing the needs and providing the necessary early power systems installation coordination. An expanded power systems development program can provide tangible benefits by development of system specific component technology and by providing the opportunity to improve component and system maturity prior to production release. The process can result in lighter weight systems with reduced fly-away costs and in lower costs of operation, which will more than pay for the expanded power systems development program. 801151. The Status of the Expendable Gasifier Program. H. F. Due, Jr. and A. Gabrys, Teledyne CAE, Toledo, OH. The Air Force Wright Aeronautical Laboratories, Aero- space Power and Turbine Engine Division (Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio), have an ongoing program to demonstrate a low cost gasifier (gas generator) for use as the core of a jet fuel starter 170 KW (230 shp), turbojet 1018 Newton (230 lb) thrust engine, or turbofan 2224 Newton (500 lb) thrust engine. The program has successfully demonstrated the low cost manufacturing processes using production tooling, adequate performance for operation in all derivative forms, and turbojet operation in the Teledyne CAE altitude chamber over a range of altitudes, Mach num- bers, and power settings. 801152. Rating Hydrogen as a Potential Aviation Fuel. Robert D. Witcofski, NASA, Langley Research Center, Hampton, VA. A comparison is made of liquid hydrogen, liquid methane, and synthetic aviation kerosene as potential future transport aircraft fuels. An assessment is made of each fuel from the standpoint of cost and energy resource utilization, including the areas of fuel production, trans- mission, airport facilities, and ultimate use in the aircraft. Safety and environmental aspects are also addressed. Barring significant breakthroughs in the production of liquid hydrogen and methane, synthetic aviation kerosene produced from oil shale or coal appears to be the logical choice from the standpoint of cost and minimal disruption to the current air transportation system. 801153. Status of the Program to Develop LH2 for Aircraft. G. Daniel Brewer, Lockheed-California Co. Design and analytical studies conducted since 1972 have shown that liquid hydrogen offers attractive advantages as a fuel for transport aircraft. These advantages, based largely on theory and analysis, need to be demonstrated in order that LH2 can be considered a credible candidate when nations address their energy futures and the air transport industry selects a fuel to replace petroleum-base Jet A. A research and development program plan to accom- plish this goal has been written and approved by a multinational group of concerned industry representa- tives. The program encompasses development of ad- vanced methods of manufacturing and liquefying hydro- gen; components and systems needed to store, measure, control, and distribute LH2 effectively at airports; as well as components and systems required to use it efficiently in aircraft. The program tasks, budget, and schedule are outlined in a review of the status of the effort to implement the plan among the several countries which are involved. 801154. Some Advantages of Methane in an Aircraft Gas Turbine. Robert W. Graham and Arthur J. Glassman, NASA-Lewis Research Center, Cleveland, OH. 143</page><page sequence="125">801155-801158 Projections of the world's petroleum supply point to acute shortages by the end of this century which could impair air transportation. Synthetic fuels will undoubtedly be needed to relieve this shortage. One form of synthesized fuel will be liquid methane, which can be manufactured from any of the hydrocarbon sources such as coal, shale, biomass, and organic waste. Because there are so many potential sources of this fuel, including natural and synthetic sources, it should be considered as a petroleum replacement. In this paper a simple cycle analysis is carried out for a turboprop engine flying at Mach 0.8 and 10,688 meters (35,000 ft.) altitude. Cycle performance comparisons are rendered for four cases in which the turbine cooling air is cooled or not cooled by the methane fuel. The advantages and disadvantages of involving the fuel in the turbine cooling system are discussed. Methane combustion characteristics are appreciably different from Jet A and will require different combustor designs. Although a number of similar difficult technical problems exist, a highly fuel efficient turboprop engine burning methane appears to be feasible. 801155. Aerodynamic Surface Cooling for Laminar Flow Control for Hydrogen-Fueled Subsonic Aircraft. G. R. Cunnington, Jr. and R. T. Parmley, Lockheed Palo Alto Research Laboratory, Palo Alto, CA. Cryogenic-fueled aircraft offer an excellent potential for laminar flow control by use of the sensible heat of the stored fuel to cool aerodynamic surfaces. Cooling the boundary layer below adiabatic wall conditions delays transition to the turbulent region and reduces frictional drag. For the liquid hydrogen fuel case, preliminary design calculations, using gaseous nitrogen as the coolant, will result in a 20-percent reduction in fuel requirement (wings plus nacelles cooling) to 28-percent reduction (addition of fuselage cooling) for a M = 0.85 cruise widebody-type aircraft on a 12,000-km flight. The added costs associated with liquefying hydrogen for use as a fuel can be offset by the improved flight performance (and lower operating costs). Implementation of surface cooling increases aircraft dry weight through addition of heat exchangers, pumps, control subsystems, etc. These must be factored into aircraft performance to realistically evaluate fuel savings. Also, assessment of the cooldown cycle is a nontrivial problem because of the large variability in local heating rates and temperatures which must be evaluated in conjunction with structural and operational constraints. Results of a preliminary study of a conceptual cooling system for the M = 0.85, 12,000-km range aircraft are presented and potential problem areas discussed. Cooling of wing and nacelle surfaces appears feasible and within the current state of technology. 1980 SA E Transactions 801156. Developing a Fighter Engine Derivative of the B-1/F101 Engine. Thomas M. Bartsch and Channing W. Posson, Aeronautical Systems Div., Wright-Patterson AFB, OH. The derivation of a fighter engine from the B-1/F101 bomber engine provides an example of the derivative engine development approach, which can provide rapid response to government needs at relatively low cost and with low risk. High contractor motivation, a proven gas turbine core, and available core hardware make the program possible. Significant amounts of both ground and flight testing provide a firm base for a potential decision to continue the development program and establish a demonstrated capability which can easily be transitioned to a production design in that continued effort. 801157. Life and Utilization Criteria in Design for Balanced Life and Performance. J. Osmer, Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft, West Palm Beach, Fla.; and G. Blevins, Wright Aeronautical Labs, Wright- Patterson AFB, Ohio. The implementation of an aircraft gas turbine engine conceptual design procedure currently being developed under Air Force (AFWAL) sponsorship will result in improved aircraft gas turbine designs with which to proceed to preliminary design. Although gas turbine engine performance and weight sensitivities to changes in life are generally not large (due to the logarithmic relationship of life to stress), past conceptual efforts have not quantified these trades. This is primarily due to the complexity of existing life prediction techniques and the associated detailed design information required by these techniques. A methodology is being developed which will quantify these life/performance trades cost effectively, on a relative basis, via computerized design procedures. Critical to the methodology is an accurate detailed engine utilization definition, which was not known in past efforts. Future conceptual efforts will be enhanced by the addition of life analyses of critical rotating components in the traditional solution of the aircraft and engine interactive design problem. 801158. Fuel Efficiency Improvements to the T56 Tur- boprop Engine. Hernando Munevar, United States Air Force Academy; and Frank Verkamp, Detroit Diesel Allison Div. of General Motors Corp. Twelve thousand T56 turboprop engines have been delivered for commercial and military aircraft to 49 countries. The current production T56 engine is rated at 4591 shaft horsepower (SHP) on a standard 59° F day and 3695 SHP on a hot 103°F day. The Air Force with a large inventory of T56 powered C-130 aircraft is sponsoring an Engine Model Derivative Program (EMDP) to develop a cost effective T56 derivative engine with 1 0 1 /2% fuel consumption improvement and 24% power increase. These improvements are being achieved at low cost and low risk by utilizing only previously demonstrated component technology. The derivative engine will operate 144</page><page sequence="126">801161-801169 at the conservative, long life conditions of 21 10° F turbine inlet temperature and 12:1 cycle pressure ratio. Existing T56 engines can be upgraded to the new configuration via a retrofit kit installed during normal engine overhaul. Investment recovery will be within four years of fleet retrofit. 801161. War, Wonderland, and 30 mm Cannon. Everest E. Riccioni, Advanced Systems, Northrop Air- craft Group. The new General Electric GEPOD 30 weapon is described as is the lethality of the GAU-8 round. The battle versatility of the system when combined with a high sortie rate aircraft is developed. These factors are used to illustrate the options, power, and methods that a battle commander has at his disposal. The gun system's con- tribution to Rapid Deployment Forces, Power Projection, and conventional weapons Deterrence are reviewed. The conclusions offer a prediction of the gun system's military future. 801163. Technology Advances Allow Multiple Role Radar Design for the F/A-18. Robert E. White, Hughes Aircraft Co. Airborne electronics technology has advanced to a point that allows multiple role design in tactical airborne radars. The Navy's F/A-18 aircraft will incorporate the AN/APG-65 multimode radar, one of the first systems designed from conception for both air-to-air and air- to-ground roles. A trace through the technology devel- opments is necessary to understand the recent feasibility of a multimission radar system. The development of the magnetron was the beginning link, while the development of the programmable signal processor was the final link in technology required to make a multimode radar. 801165.

The application of digital technology to the design of automatic flight control systems for commercial trans- ports will yield significant benefits to the airlines. This paper identifies some of the limitations of present-day analog flight-control systems. It explains why these limitations exist, and how they can be overcome by digital integrated system mechanizations. 1980 SAE Transactions 801167. Strapdown Navigation Comes of Age. David L. Bjorndahl, Litton Aero Products Division, Canoga Park, CA. Strapdown Inertial Reference Systems have been selected for the new Boeing 757 and 767 and Aerospatiale A3 10 aircraft. The benefits provided by the strapdown system, as opposed to the gimballed system, and the differences between the two mechanizations are discussed. The material presented is for potential airline users of such equipment rather than the system designers. 801168. Application of CRT Displays to the Cockpit of Tomorrow. Arvind J. Dandekar, Collins Air Transport Div., Rockwell International Corp., Cedar Rapids, IA. The CRT display applications in the current generation air transport aircraft are limited to weather radar displays and a few navigation displays. Flight decks of the aircraft of tomorrow, however, will be dominated by CRT displays. The CRT's will cover multiple applications such as flight instruments (ADI, HSI), engine displays, head-up displays, caution warnings, and aircraft systems. This paper describes these new CRT display systems, their capabilities, and their impact on aircraft operation. 801169. 757/767 Flight Management System. Richard A. Peal, Boeing Commercial Airplane Co., Seattle, WA. The 757/767 Flight Management System provides the initial operational implementation of an integrated gui- dance, control and display equipments based upon digital technology for commercial transport airplanes. The applied equipments are based upon the new ARINC 700 series characteristics developed by the Industry over the past five years. These characteristics were developed on the basis of limited operational experience with selected elements of the system and upon R&amp;D efforts within the Industry. The System features automatic/manual flight profiles for optimum economics, all weather landing including rollout guidance, electronic primary flight instruments based on color (shadow mask) CRTs, inertial attitude/velocity reference based upon laser gyros, im- proved caution/warning and other improved perform- ance/functional features. The system also provides sig- nificant improvements in line and shop maintenance features. This article will provide a brief description of the 767 Flight Management System including functional require- 145</page><page sequence="127">801170-801178 ments, functional partitioning, interface signal control, and design technology features. 801170. Integrated CAD/CAM for the 1980s. Edwin N. Nilson, Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft Group. The importance of the application of an integrated interactive computing structure for CAD/CAM is now becoming widely recognized. Some major technological obstacles remain with respect to geometric modeling, data base management systems, and computer operating systems in particular. The prognosis for the solution of these problems is discussed; special attention is given to the impact of the NASA IPAD project, the Air Force ICAM program; and the possible long-range effects of the proliferation of minicomputer-based interactive drafting and other systems are examined. 801171. A Computer Aided Engineering Approach in the Design of Impellers. Jesús J. Suárez and Ray- mond D. Bennetts, Industrial Systems Con- sulting Services, Structural Dynamics Research Corp. Computerized Aided Engineering (CAE) techniques cur- rently used in the design of impellers is presented. Both computerized flow performance analysis and structural integrity analysis methods are discussed. Computer graphic capabilities used in the design cycle are also listed. An approach to evaluate the structural integrity of impellers under steady state and dynamic loading is given. Correlation between analytical and test results is pre- sented. The emphasis of the paper is placed on the structural integrity aspects. 801173. Inspection of Turbine Blades Using Computer Aided Laser Technology. R. S. Pinter, R. G. Alcoke, R. A. Ekvall, D. S. Steele and W. H. Wright, Jr., General Electric Co. Measurement of dimensional characteristics of airfoil parts is primarily a manual, labor intensive operation. It employs a wide variety of gages that vary from very expensive optical comparitors to inexpensive pin gages. An automatic noncontacting inspection gage capable of measuring most dimensional characteristics would be cost effective, simplify inspection operations, consolidate a number of gages into one, and improve overall inspection reliability by minimizing human involvement. This paper presents the results of the design and development of a demonstrator semi-automatic laser gage dimensional inspection system that addresses this problem. 801175. HiMAT Systems Development Results and Pro- jections. L. E. Brown, Jr., M. H. Roe and R. A. Quam, North American Aircraft Division, Rockwell International. An overview of significant findings resulting from the development and ongoing flight test of the HiMAT RPRV system is presented, as well as potential future candidate concepts for flight research investigations. The impact and application of advanced technology features to future operational systems is treated with recommended areas of analysis, development, and testing for critical path maturity. 801176. Feasibility of Forward-Swept Wing Technology For V/STOL Aircraft. Stanley G. Kalemaris, Grumman Aerospace Corporation. The application of forward-swept wing technology to V/STOL aircraft was found to be feasible. In addition to the previously known benefits to the conventional-flight performance, the forward-swept wing offers unique benefits to certain classes of V/STOL aircraft. For these classes of aircraft, it is possible to obtain synergism between advances in airframe and engine technology. 1980 SA E Transactions 801177. Air Combat Advantages from Reaction Control Systems. David W. Lacey, David W. Taylor Naval Ship, Research and Development Center. A two-phase digital simulation of the effect of Reaction Controls on high-angle of attack has been conducted. The first phase conducted at the David W. Taylor Naval Ship R&amp;D Center sized and developed the reaction control system for a modern high performance fighter aircraft. The results of this phase indicated increased roll response due primarily to increased yaw control power. The second phase was a manned one-on-one study conducted at the NASA Langley Differential Maneuver- ing Simulator using Navy/Marine pilots. Results of this study indicated a 4 to 1 Time on Advantage ratio for the reaction controlled aircraft from a neutral start position. Time on Advantage ratios were 1.66 to 1 and 28 to 1 when the reaction controlled aircraft was placed at a disadvantage and advantage respectively. 1980 SA E Transactions 801178. Preliminary Aerodynamic Characteristics of Sev- eral Advanced VSTOL Fighter/ Attack Aircraft Concepts. Walter P. Nelms and Donald A. Durs ton, Ames Research Center, NASA, Moffett Field, CA. The paper summarizes preliminary results from a research program undertaken to develop aerodynamic technology for VSTOL fighter/attack aircraft projected for the post- 1990 period. This program features industry studies jointly sponsored by NASA and the Navy. General Dynamics and Northrop provided four conceptual de- signs, identified aerodynamic uncertainties for these concepts, and built wind-tunnel models. Tests are being conducted in the Unitary and 12-Foot Wind Tunnels (M = 0.2 to 2.5) at Ames Research Center to investigate the uncertainties and to develop an aerodynamic data base for these types of configurations. Experimental results from this program are presented together with predictions by Ames and contractor participants.

V/STOL Capability by Modifying CTOL Air- craft. R. E. Kuhn, V/STOL Consultant. The increasing cost and vulnerability of conventional airbases and aircraft carriers places increasing emphasis on the continuing application of V/STOL technology. This paper reviews the status of V/STOL technology. The helicopter and the Harrier have proven themselves and the improved AV-8B is being developed. This paper examines the possibilities of modifying CTOL aircraft to give them V/STOL capability to fill two other aircraft/mission areas; an air superiority V/STOL and a V/STOL type to fill the ASW, AEW, and missileer roles. Recommendations are made for a program to investigate such modifications of existing CTOL aircraft now used in these roles so that the application of V/STOL capability to these missions can be explored and evalu- ated. Other recommendations are made with respect to the need for engine out hover capability, the use of Short Take-Off and Vertical Landing (STO-VL) capability and the need for special V/STOL engine ratings. 1980 SA E Transactions 801180. AD-1 Oblique Wing Aircraft Program. W. H. Andrews, A. G. Sim, R. C. Monaghan, L. R. Felt and T. C. McMurtry, NASA Dryden Flight Research Center, Edwards, CA; and R. C. Smith, NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA. To evaluate the oblique wing concept developed by Robert T. Jones and his associates at the NASA Ames Research Center, a flight test program has been initiated to assess the flying characteristics of a low speed manned oblique wing airplane. The principal objective of the program is to assess the aircraft's flying qualities at wing sweep angles from 0° to 60° and at indicated airspeeds up to 150 knots. At present the program is in the flight envelope expansion phase and is investigating flutter clearance as a function of wing sweep. 1980 SA E Transactions 801181. Materials and Processes for Aircraft Environ- mental Controls in the 1990's. E. J. Delgrosso, T. Zajac and J. Tseka, United Technologies Corp. A forecast is presented of the materials and processes expected to be used in aircraft environmental control systems (ECS) in the 1990's. It is expected that ECS components will not change drastically in design and function but materials used for their construction will change considerably. The anticipated innovations include: 1. Use of new alloys, 2. greater use of "near-net-shape" parts, 3. employment of low cost alloys modified by ion implantation or by laser glazing, and 4. greater use of fiber reinforced plastics, thermoform- able plastics, reinforced stampable plastics and fiber reinforced metal matrix composites. 801182. Application of Performance Based Feedback to Air Combat Training. Anthony P. Ciavarelli and Amanda M. Williams, Dunlap and Associates, Inc., Western Div., La Jolla, CA. The content of this paper summarizes four years of research designed to develop valid and reliable per- formance criteria for the Navy's Tactical Aircrew Combat Training System (TACTS). Measures used in performance assessment were selected on the basis of their operational importance and their demonstrated statistical relationship to successful completion of such air combat tasks as missile launch success and engagement outcomes. A measurement framework has evolved and may be appro- priately applied to estimate overall air combat effec- tiveness, and to provide diagnostic performance analysis of critical air combat tasks. More recently, these measures and assessment methods have been incorporated in a computer-based TACTS aircrew debrief system called the Performance Assessment and Appraisal System (PAAS). The PAAS is representative of an emerging technology which uses automated performance measurement meth- ods for enhancing the training process by providing performance based feedback to operational aircrews. 801183. U.S. Navy/USAF Development of Tactical Air- crew Combat Training System/ Air Combat Manuevering Instrumentation (TACTS/ACMI). D. P. Dunbar, Jr., Naval Air Systems Com- mand; and D. M. Jennings, SRI International. The inflight aircrew training system called Tactical Aircrew Combat Training System (TACTS) by the U.S. Navy and Air Combat Maneuvering Instrumentation (ACMI) by the U.S. Air Force was originally developed to improve aircrew performance in air-to-air combat. Five installations are now operational - four in the United States and one in Sardinia, for US AFE. The system features (1) real-time tracking, integration, processing, and display of maneuvering aircraft in flight and associated flight data, (2) computer simulation of weapon system employment against which aircrews can exercise their abilities in flight, and (3) magnetic recording of exercise data for subsequent replay of alphanumeric and 3-D graphic displays of in-depth analysis. The versatility of the generic system design and the fund of significant data it can produce have led to the continuing expansion of its applications. Extended applications include air-to-surface and electronic warfare training, tactics and weapons system development, and test and evaluation of aircraft and weapons systems. 801184. Trends in Air Force Simulation - Perspectives from the Air Force Human Resources Laboratory Operations Training Division. Richard C. Need- 147</page><page sequence="129">801185-801190 ham, AFHRL/OT, Williams AFB, A Z; and Bernell J. Edwards, AFHRL/OTG, Williams AFB, AZ. The Air Force mission is to fly and fight. The organization which I represent has a basic role in that mission. Our job is to contribute the best science and technology available to make Air Force operations training as effective as possible. We are the Operations Training Division of the Air Force Human Resources Laboratory. Our function as the leading edge for the advancement of operational training is unique; we are the only organization with such a charter. 801185. Energy Maneuverability Displays for Air Combat Training. V. R. Pruitt, McDonnell Aircraft Co., McDonnell Douglas Corp., St. Louis, MO; and W. F. Moroney, Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, CA. Two types of energy maneuverability displays have been developed for use in air combat maneuvering (ACM) training. One type of display is used on the ground in connection with the U.S. Navy's Tactical Air Combat Training System (TACTS) facility and the other is a helmet-mounted display for use during inflight air combat training. Both displays employ energy maneuverability concepts which show the key maneuvering parameters of maximum sustained turn rate, minimum sustained turn radius, corner turn, and areas of energy gain and loss as functions of aircraft performance and structural limits. Both have shown significant potential for enhancing ACM training effectiveness. 1980 SA E Transactions 801187. Simulated A-10 Combat Environment. Robert S. Kellogg, Dirk C. Prather and Carl Castore, Human Resources Laboratory, Williams AFB, AZ. The objective of this study was to test the feasibility of using the Advanced Simulator for Pilot Training (ASPT) in training pilots for combat in a simulated hostile environment. A statistical analysis of the results was made in order to evaluate the extent and kind of learning which took place. The results indicate that combat-ready pilots exhibit a clear learning of offensive and defensive tactics and a favorable response to such training. 801188. New Hydraulic System Technology for Future Aircraft. Kenneth E. Binns, Air Force Wright Aeronautical Laboratories, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, OH. In the next 10 to 15 years, it is predicted that hydraulic system technology will require some major advancements to compete with other technologies and to meet new aircraft requirements. Fly-by-wire flight control systems, onboard digital computers, and other aircraft trends will act as catalysts for this new technology. This paper summarizes the results and status of ongoing research and development programs being conducted to establish new hydraulic system technology. In addition to these ongoing programs, the author provides his projections of new technology which has merit for future aircraft applica- tions. 801189. Lightweight Hydraulic System Development and Flight Test. Joseph N. Demarchi, Rockwell International Corp., North American Aircraft Div., Columbus, OH; and John Ohlson, Naval Air Development Center, Warminster, PA. This paper discusses the development of 8000 psi aircraft lightweight hydraulic systems as compared to the present 3000 psi systems. The concept of utilizing higher operating pressures for aircraft hydraulic system provides for significant reductions in both weight and volume. The power level of hydraulic systems in military aircraft has risen from less than 10 hp in the early 1940s to nearly 300 on the Navy's modern F-14 fighter, 500 on the SST Concorde, and 1000 on the Air Force's B-l bomber. With considerable theoretical and empirical data available, a selection of 8000 psi was determined to be the best practical level to operate an aircraft hydraulic system. The development of aircraft Lightweight Hydraulic Systems (LHS) has been an ongoing Navy R&amp;D program for the past 10 years and is being funded by the Naval Air Development Center (NADC) at Warminster, PA. Two major areas that provide the impetus to operate at this level were the elastomeric O-ring seal and the advent of a reliable variable volume displacement type pump. No significant change in the operating pressure level has been made since that time. However, the Navy and Rockwell have recognized that considerable advances in the state- of-the-art have been made and higher operating pressures are now feasible. 1980 SA E Transactions 801190. The Use of Power- Adaptive and Power-Revers- ible Flight Control Actuation Systems to Achieve Hydraulic Power and System Weight Savings. C. W. Robinson, Boeing Military Airplane Co. New generations of aircraft, both commercial and military are expected to utilize active controls to reduce trim drag and enhance fuel economy. When such active controls are accepted, the practice of designing surface actuators to torque saturate will almost certainly be abandoned. This conclusion is unavoidable; since when flight safety, through dynamic stability requires active controls, and a negative passive stability margin is present on the aircraft we can no longer allow the response of actuators to go to zero. Additional actuator capacity and power required by the elimination of torque saturation will have to be charged as a weight penalty to counterbalance the obvious advantage of lesser trim drag. This penalty will apply unless we devise other means to reduce actuation power requirements. The power reversible actuator concept offers a promise of a fully active non-stalling surface 148</page><page sequence="130">801192-801197 control system which will require less installed hydraulic power than the torque saturating systems in current use. The power adaptable actuator concept constitutes a less drastic step in the same direction. This paper defines the terms power adaptable and reversible with respect to the application of hydraulic or electrical power to the positioning of a loaded aircraft control surface. Examples of each type of system are taken from those systems in current use with discussion of the limitations of each specific system. Systems of each type are then described which have not yet come into use and which circumvent many of the disadvantages of the systems already in use. Both the electrohydraulic stepping motor "D.E.H.A." type rotary geared output system and the staged sequential valved ram type system are de- scribed as examples of advanced systems which are, to a large degree, both power adaptable and reversible. 801192. Secondary Power System Options for Future Military Aircraft. E. T. Raymond, Boeing Mili- tary Airplane Co. This paper summarizes a recent study for twin-engine military transport aircraft. Five major system arrange- ments plus a number of variations were analyzed. Power sources and drive equipment included: the main engines, engine-mounted accessory gearboxes, airframe-mounted accessory drive gearboxes, electrical batteries, auxiliary power units, air-turbine motors, ram air turbines, mono- propellant emergency power units, bipropellant emer- gency power units, and various integrated power units which can be operated in two or more modes. The comparative impact of these system arrangements on aircraft weight, range, and life-cycle cost are shown. 1980 SA E Transactions 801193. Digital Computer Simulation of Aircraft Hy- draulic Systems. R. J. Levek, McDonnell Air- craft Co., McDonnell Douglas Corp., St. Louis, MO. The McDonnell Aircraft Company (MCAIR) - McDon- nell Douglas Corporation, St. Louis, under the sponsor- ship of the Air Force Wright Aeronautical Laboratories - Aero Propulsion Laboratory, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, has developed, verified, and documented four complementary digital computer programs for the design and dynamic analysis of aircraft hydraulic systems. These programs model typical hydraulic system components and use a building block technique to permit modeling of systems or subsystems with varying degrees of complexity. This paper briefly describes the four computer pro- grams and presents MCAIR case histories of specific computer program applications. This experience should encourage others to apply these computer programs to the design and analysis of fluid systems. 801194. Real-Time Microprocessor Technology Applied to Automatic Braking Systems. Edgar A. Hirzel, Hydro-Aire Div., Crane Co. Since the advent of the jet engine, aircraft stopping capability has been dependent primarily on brakes and tires. To provide high performance control after landing while conserving tires and brakes, efficient hydraulic pressure systems have been developed. Associated elec- tronic controls have historically relied on analog tech- nology; but with the availability of high speed micropro- cessors, real-time digital control is now possible for automatic braking functions. This paper reviews the role of digital technology and the microprocessor in the braking control loops. 801195. Evolution of an Optical Control System for Aircraft Hydraulics. Norman L. Seymour, Parker Bertea Control Systems Div., Irvine, CA. Fly-by-Wire controls are vulnerable to lightning strikes, electromagnetic interference and electromagnetic pulse. Replacing electrical wiring to actuators with optical fiberguides can minimize this vulnerability. Two ap- proaches to the incorporation of optical signal paths in actuation systems are described. One concept requires implementation of "local" electronics while the other seeks to eliminate even this requirement. Both are expected to be flight tested in the near future. 1980 SA E Transactions 801196. Reverse Thrust Performance of the QCSEE Variable Pitch Turbofan Engine. N. E. Samanich, D. C. Reemsnyder and H. E. Bloom- er, NASA Lewis Research Center. Results of steady-state reverse and forward-to-reverse thrust transient performance tests are presented. The original QCSEE 4-segment variable fan nozzle was retested in reverse and compared with a continuous, 30° half-angle conical exlet. Data indicated that the signif- icantly more stable, higher pressure recovery flow with the fixed 30° exlet resulted in lower engine vibrations, lower fan blade stress and approximately a 20% improvement in reverse thrust. Objective reverse thrust of 35% of takeoff thrust was reached. Thrust response of less than 1.5 sec was achieved for the approach and the takeoff-to-reverse thrust transients. 1980 SA E Transactions 801197. Role of the Turboprop in the Air Transportation System for the 1980's and Onward. James J. Foody and Samuel C. Colwell, Fairchild Indus- tries, Inc. The explosion in fuel prices over the past several years, along with projected increases well above other costs, has dramatically altered the relative economics of turbofan and turboprop aircraft. New development in turboprop 149</page><page sequence="131">801198-801203 technology, in association with increased abandonment of short-haul routes by certificated air carriers with jet equipment, is resulting in fuel-efficient turboprops that could spawn a new family of short-haul commercial transport aircraft. To assess the likelihood and potential benefits of such a development, the current and projected technology of turboprop aircraft will be discussed and compared with possible turbofan systems. Technological improvements as measured by fuel burned and aircraft operating costs are compared for aircraft sizes up to 100 passengers at ranges up to 850 miles. The historical development of the U.S. short-haul air travel market, related to equipment availability, will be reviewed. Projections of future development of this market based on inherent demand factors and spurred by new technology aircraft will be discussed. 801198. Small Transport Aircraft Technology (STAT) Propulsion Study. R. W. Heldenbrand, C. F. Baerst and J. H. Rowse, AiResearch Manufac- turing Co. of Arizona, A Division of the Garrett Corporation, Phoenix, Arizona. The NASA Small Transport Aircraft Technology (STAT) Propulsion Study was established to identify technology requirements and define the research and development required for new commuter aircraft. Interim results of the studies defined mission and design characteristics for 30- and 50-passenger aircraft. Sensitivities were defined that relate changes in engine specific fuel consumption (SFC), weight, and cost (including maintenance) to changes in the aircraft direct operating cost (DOC), takeoff gross weight, and empty weight. A comparison of performance and economic characteristics is presented between aircraft powered by 1980 production engines and those powered by a 1990 advanced technology baseline engine. 801199. Full Authority Digital Electronic Control Turbo- fan Engine Demonstration. R. W. Vizzini, Ad- vanced Development Div., Naval Air Propulsion Center, Trenton, NJ; T. G. Lenox, Commercial Products Div., Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft Group, East Hartford, CT; and R. J. Miller, Govern- ment Products Div., Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft Group, West Palm Beach, FL. This paper describes the design, demonstration and evaluation of a Full Authority Digital Electronic Control (FADEC) capable of controlling an advanced variable cycle gas turbine engine in an advanced supersonic Navy fighter aircraft application. The FADEC design incorporates many advanced technology features including the latest microelectronics, extensive fault tolerance capability, and high-speed digital communication using a fiber optic data link. The ad- vanced technology FADEC system was successfully demonstrated in a comprehensive test program, which included open loop environmental bench testing, closed loop bench testing, and testing on an F401 afterburning turbofan engine at sea level and at nine altitude condi- tions from 7000 to 50,000 ft, and at Mach numbers from 0.3 to 1.6. This testing was a major milestone in a program to design, develop, and demonstrate an engine-mounted full authority digital electronic control for advanced military aircraft engine application in the 1980's and beyond. Over 7000 hr of electronic control operation were achieved during this program. Over 1100 hr of testing were achieved with the engine-mounted control unit, which included over 68 hr of engine testing without a hardware malfunction. In addition to the advanced electronic circuitry employed in the FADEC, the first demonstration of optic communication with engine- mounted equipment was achieved. The success of the FADEC program to date has led to plans to flight test the FADEC in either an F-15 of F-14 aircraft in the early 1980's. 801200. An Application of Redundancy in Digital Elec- tronic Engine Control. John Kniat, Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft Group; and Joseph A. Bluish, Bendix. A full authority, dual channel, fault tolerant digital electronic control system for aircraft gas turbine engines has been designed by the Bendix Energy Controls Division and flight-tested on the Boeing 747 research aircraft. These efforts were part of a cooperative program between Boeing Commercial Airplane Company, Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft (Commercial Products Division), Bendix Energy Controls Division, and Hamilton Standard to demonstrate the improved capability of a totally Elec- tronic Propulsion Control System (EPCS). Interest in fully electronic engine control systems was generated by their potential for low weight, high opera- tional reliability, easy maintenance, and low life-cycle cost. The Bendix EPCS fulfills all these potentials. 1980 SA E Transactions 801201. Flight Test Reliability Demonstration of Elec- tronic Engine Controls. D. M. Newirth, Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft Group, United Technologies, Inc.; and C. J. Bosco, Hamilton Standard, United Technology Corp. Assuming an aggressive development program, the reli- ability of digital electronic components is, in part, a function of total operating time. This paper predicts that a reliability evaluation program of transport engine digital electronic controls, conducted before the engine enters service, will improve the initial reliability of the control by a factor of two. Design, quality, and/or manufacturing process defects, exposed to the engine/flight environment will be identified and corrected before the control enters service. 801203. Full Authority Digital Electronic Control Appli- cation to a Variable Cycle Engine. R. W. Vizzini, 150</page><page sequence="132">801205-801209 Naval Air Propulsion Center; and P. D. Toot, General Electric Co. This paper describes the design, fabrication, and system bench testing of an advanced Full Authority Digital Electronic Control (FADEC) in preparation for fullscale testing on a variable cycle aircraft engine. This control provides all computation and signal-handling capability necessary for the advanced variable cycle engine control task, and is designed to meet challenging reliability, weight, envelope, and life cycle cost objectives. Advanced controller techniques, a unique Failure Indication and Corrective Action feature which allows continued engine operation without significant performance degradation under multiple fault conditions, and use of large-area multilayer ceramic hybrid modules will be demonstrated for the first time in an on-engine control system. 801205. Evaluation of Several Control/Display Concepts for V/STOL Shipboard Landing. Shawn T. Donley, Naval Air Development Center. The relative merits of three flight control laws and two distinctly different Head-Up Display concepts have been evaluated in a piloted simulation for the task of landing a generic lift/cruise fan V/STOL aboard a DD-963 class destroyer. Results indicate that air-wake turbulence in the vicinity of the landing pad dominates landing perform- ance. A high level of vehicle augmentation, in the form of a translational relative velocity command/relative posi- tion hold control law, was required to achieve acceptable pilot ratings in higher than 30 kts wind-over-deck conditions. 1980 SA E Transactions 801206. Velocity Command/Position Hold: A New Flight Control Concept for Hovering VTOL Aircraft. Robert L. Stapleford, Systems Technology, Inc., Hawthorne, CA. A new flight control concept for a hovering VTOL aircraft has been developed. The main feature of this system is that deflection of a pilot's controller produces a linear velocity command with position hold when the controller is centered. Another novel feature is that horizontal commands both tilt the aircraft and deflect the thrust vector, while the position feedbacks only deflect the thrust vector. This system has been evaluated in two piloted simulations of landing a VTOL aircraft on a small ship. The pilots consistently rated this system better than three other, more conventional, control systems. 801207. Flight Test Experience Using Advanced Airborne Equipment in a Time-Based Metered Traffic Environment. Samuel A. Morello, NASA Lang- ley Research Center. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Langley Research Center's Terminal Configured Vehicle (TCV) Program, in cooperation with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), is pursuing research and tech- nology concept development for airborne systems, oper- ations and procedures that can provide needed improve- ments and solutions to air transportation problems for conventional civil aircraft particularly for the 1990-2000 time period. Specifically, it is to provide the airborne systems capability which can lead to increased airport and runway capacity, increased energy efficient terminal area operations, reduced weather dependence with safety and reduced community noise by use of improved flight procedures. This paper describes the results of flight tests to evaluate flight management descent computations designed to accurately deliver the airplane in a fuel efficient manner to a metering fix at a time designed by air traffic control (ATC). 1980 SA E Transactions 801208.

The software used is the Lockheed-California Company Computer-graphics Aug- mented Design and Manufacturing (CADAM)® system in conjunction with our inhouse Surface Design and Finite Element Model programs. Starting with the conceptual design on the CADAM system, configuration geometry is generated for use by analysis users, preliminary design, loft, and production design organizations. An example used to demonstrate the application of the system is the development of a smaller horizontal tail for L- 1011 derivatives, under the sponsorship of the NASA Energy Efficient Transport Technology office. The increased productivity achieved by using the CADAM system is described. 1980 SA E Transactions 801209. Adhesive Bonding of Aircraft Primary Structures. L. J. Hart-Smith, Principal Engineer Scientist, Structural Mechanics, Douglas Aircraft Com- pany, McDonnell Douglas Corporation, Long Beach, Calif. The Primary Adhesively Bonded Structures Technology (PABST) program conducted by McDonnell Douglas for the USAF Flight Dynamics Laboratory has broadened the horizons for future applications of adhesive bonding to aerospace structures. A major portion of this program was concerned with the use of new environmentally- resistant adhesives and primers, and an improved surface preparation involving the use of phosphoric acid anodize. This portion has been well publicized and explains past service failůres and how to avoid their recurrence. This paper emphasizes structural considerations. These include (1) a comparison between the performance of bonded and riveted construction, (2) an explanation of why the bonding was found to be superior in most situations, (3) the techniques for identifying where not to use adhesive bonding because its misapplication could lead to a 151</page><page sequence="133">801210-801214 reduction in damage tolerance just as significant as the improvements associated with the judicious elimination of mechanical fasteners, (4) an outline of the procedures used in PABST to size the bonded joints, (5) a description of the bonded joints, and (6) a summary of the significant findings of the structural testing of panels and the Full-Scale Demonstration Component, a 42-foot long by 216-inch diameter approximation of the forward fuselage of a wide-body transport aircraft. Manufacturing con- siderations are also included, along with a discussion of the need to integrate the tooling and design concepts. This massive amount of work, with such a strongly positive result, inspires much confidence in the more wide-spread use of structural adhesive bonding in all new aircraft. 1980 SA E Transactions 801210. Integrated Active Controls Impact on Supersonic Cruise Vehicle Structural Design. Lewis F. Jurey and Nick Radovcich, Lockheed-California Co. The application of integrated active controls to high performance aircraft has been made feasible by recent advances in active control technology. This paper sum- marizes some of these advances. One approach to the methodology for synthesizing active control transfer functions is reviewed. Application of this methodology to a supersonic cruise vehicle is discussed. Significant structural weight savings were realized using active controls for this vehicle. Among the several design advantages noted is the ability to avoid expensive redesign of structurally deficient aircraft by means of active controls. 801211. Acoustic Emission Techniques for In-Flight Structural Monitoring. Budd Parrish, Parrish &amp; Hill, Norman, OK. Faced with high replacement costs for airframes, com- mercial and military users are attempting to keep their high-time aircraft in service. Assistance comes from the field of acoustic emission (AE), which provides a means of monitoring structural integrity in cases where fatigue damage may jeopardize basic airworthiness. Acoustic emissions are the distinctive stress waves generated in solid materials during crack growth. These stress waves can be detected by sensitive transducers coupled to the material surface. Sensing of AE signatures provides the basis for a system which can continuously monitor structural integrity during flight and warn of impending failure. 801212. Advanced Graphite Composites in the 757/767. G. L. Brower, The Boeing Co. The new 757/767 transports will be the first Boeing Commercial aircraft to commit advanced graphite com- posite material to initial production. Composite materials, mainly fiberglass in an epoxy matrix, have been used in Boeing military and commercial aircraft in ever increasing amounts for the past twenty (plus) years. Recently, the state-of-the-art of Advanced Composites (graphite and graphite/Kevlar hybrids in an epoxy matrix) progressed to the level that it could be committed to full-scale produc- tion. This production commitment resulted in a multi- year, multi-million dollar development program. This was to assure technical and production readiness, and product reliability to meet the stringent performance and safety standards of modern commercial transport. Under this development program, selected advanced composite components (secondary structures, such as elevators, rudders, ailerons and spoilers) were designed, fabricated and tested; these components are committed to the 757 and 767. As these components were being developed, other applications were found for hybrid composites of graphite and Kevlar. When applied to lesser-loaded areas, this material becomes increasingly cost and weight effective. The 757 and 767 are primarily made of aluminum, but do have significant amounts of composite material in their structure. Composite use on the 757/767 is a significant step toward that time when future transports will be primarily all-composite airplanes. The rapid rise in the cost of fuels will accelerate the introduction of advanced graphite composites as primary structure. 801213. Design, Fabrication and Test of a Complex Helicopter Airframe Section. Melvin J. Rich, Chief of Structures Technology, Sikorsky Air- craft Division of United Technologies Corpo- ration, Stratford, Conn. Under a jointly sponsored Army /NASA contract NAS1- 13479 (Army Structures Laboratory, USARTL (AVRADCOM), and NASA-Langley) Sikorsky Aircraft has been conducting programs for the design, fabrication and test of advanced composite airframe structures. This paper will present the progress of Phase IV of the contract involving cabin roof structures. The cabin roof structure is one of the most complex regions in an all composite helicopter airframe. The roof contains highly loaded joints where the major frames and beams intersect and high concentrated loads from the main gear box are introduced. Under Phase IV the design of a roof structure has been completed which consists of all graphite/epoxy structural elements bonded as an assembly without any mechanical fasteners. Fabrication used aluminum tooling with control on all mating surfaces to provide accurate bondlines. The results of static tests are presented. Program results have verified a twenty-six percent weight saving from the current production metal baseline. The purpose of this paper is to present the latest progress in the development of all composite helicopter airframe structures. 801214. Maintenance Program Analysis for Aircraft Structures of the 80's: MSG-3. Thomas M. Edwards, Jr. and Ralph G. Wilson, United 152</page><page sequence="134">801215-801219 Airlines, Maintenance Operations Center, San Francisco, Cal. This paper outlines and explains the history, philosophy, and procedures of aircraft structures maintenance pro- gram analysis contained in the recently published Air Transport Association of America document entitled Airline/ Manufacturer Maintenance Program Planning Doc- ument - MSG-3. Some of the details developed are the relationship of the scheduled structural maintenance program to the consequences of structural item functional failure, the structure's susceptibility to damage, and the degree of difficulty involved in detecting such damage. The "MSG-3 Structural Maintenance Program Devel- opment Logic" is provided to show how each of the deterioration sources (fatigue, environmental, and acci- dental damage) are assessed separately to provide a structural inspection program for the timely detection of any distress. The implementation of the MSG-3 process through the Maintenance Review Board activity is also discussed. In general, the paper describes the documented procedures for developing a detailed maintenance pro- gram for structures which complies with the guidelines of Federal Aviation Administration Advisory Circular 25.571-1. 1980 SA E Transactions 801215. The Impact of Engineering Drawing Standards on Product Quality. Peter G. Belitsos, Aircraft Engine Group, General Electric Co., Cincinnati, OH. Since product designs are defined and communicated using the language established by engineering drawing standards, the role of these standards and their impact on product quality is examined. This includes: 1. A historical review and analysis of the foundation upon which the engineering drawing standards in this country have been based. 2. The importance of good design and adequate design definition on drawings in a language which is widely recognized and understood. 3. The equal importance of dynamic constantly improving engineering drawing and design standards based on product experience and knowledge acquired in the solution of factory and in-service problems (as illustrated by a number of actual cases). 4. An assessment of the challenges of the 1980's and the advances expected to be made during this decade. 801216. National and International Drawing Standards: IVIoving Toward Better Alignment with Y14.5. Philip A. Nicovich, Sandia National Labora- tories, Albuquerque, NM. The task of revising the national standard on Dimension- ing and Tolerancing, begun seven years ago, required close coordination between the Y 14.5 Subcommittee and the U.S. expert members who participated in related activities of the International Organization for Standard- ization. The revised drawing standard about to be issued reflects additional international alignments in areas of metrication, symbology, and conventions. Differences remain in the prescribed symbol for indicating a datum feature and in a Principle of Independency, the latter unacceptably absolving size limits from controlling the geometric form of an individual feature. More U.S. member experts will be needed on the Y 14.5 Subcom- mittee to uphold US viewpoints in the writing of international drawing standards of a pragmatic kind. 801217. Data Management in the '80s. Theodore L. Golmis, Hughes Aircraft Co., Fullerton, CA. Technical documentation problems can be minimized in this decade by having reliance upon the judgment of competent people rather than relying upon prematurely specified requirements set down in specifications and standards which have not kept pace with the state- of-the-art or have been tailored to the specific require- ments of the contract. The 1980s will demand recognition of automated, high capacity, low cost documentation methods. 801218. (SP-478) Overview of ARP 1587 Aircraft Gas Turbine Engine Monitoring System Guide. Tom Warwick, United Technologies Corp., West Palm Beach, FL. As advanced aircraft gas turbine engines with increasingly longer life are produced, operating and support require- ments become more demanding. O&amp;S costs for commer- cial and government users of these more durable engines take a larger share of system total life cycle cost. More emphasis is placed upon an Engine Monitoring System (EMS) to reduce direct operating costs and related support costs. A greater need for improved interfacing of EMS equipment exists. Closer coordination is required among EMS participants: commercial and government users, aircraft manufacturers, engine producers and equipment suppliers. ARP 1587 is an SAE Aerospace Recommended Practice document that provides EMS guidelines for people, equipment, hardware and software. The document is a system guide that addresses in-flight and ground EMS applications. This paper presents ARP 1587 background and highlights. ARP 1587 draft preparation and related SAE E-32 Committee activity also are discussed. 801219. (SP-478) Current and Future Use of an AIDS Integrated EMS. Henk C. Vermeulen, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Schiphol Airport - The Netherlands. Ever since the introduction of the ignition analyser, used to monitor piston-engine performance, the airlines have been active in trying to develop more effective monitoring tools. Once the KSSU (KLM, SAS, SWR and UTA) airline consortium decided to equip their wide-body aircraft with 153</page><page sequence="135">801220-801226 AIDS (Aircraft Integrated Data System) the opportunity was available to improve the Engine Monitoring System (EMS) Several examples of the use of an AIDS integrated EMS as used by KLM are presented followed by a description of an advanced EMS as specified for the Airbus Industrie A300/A310. The envisaged application of such a system concludes this paper. In this EMS application in an Airline environment several facets of ARP-1587 are reflected. 801220. (SP-478) Commercial EMS Considerations for Small Gas Turbine Engines. R. Halliday, Pratt &amp; Whitney of Canada Ltd., Longueuil, Quebec. As gas turbine engines are scaled down in size, weight and cost, the EMS must also be reduced. Electronic automated EMS offers advantages over manual methods for power assurance, trend and limit exceedance monitoring, LCF and creep life recording. System cost is the main constraint on EMS for small gas turbines. The cost is proportional to the number of parameters measured which in turn determines the system capability. The constraints will preclude a full diagnostic capability. EMS costs may be reduced by "piggy-backing" with other systems. The paper concludes EMS is justified on small gas turbine engines. ARP 1587 is necessary for standardisa- tion. Where EMS is to be integrated with other systems, detailed specifications are required. 801221. (SP-478) Further Application and Development of an Engine Usage/Life Monitoring System for Military Services. R. Holl, FRAeS (UK). The Engine Usage Monitoring System (EUMS) was the result of a growing recognition of the need to obtain quantified data from in-service military engines in order to know how they were used, and to determine the extent and rates at which major and/or critical components' fatigue lives were consumed. Funding limitations, coupled with a need to develop the system quickly, led to decisions to (1) use the Phillips-type magnetic tape cassette as the recording medium, (2) use serial digital data formatting, and (3) take advantage of current developments in the civil AIDS field. The full potential of the EUMS Mk II system will not be exploited to achieve savings in costs and maintenance man-hours until engines are properly equipped with the appropriate and necessary range of transducers. This paper up-dates the total system development progress and covers the range of experience gained in operational areas of some of the UK and U.S. military services. 801222. (SP-478) TF41/A7-E Engine Monitoring System Implementation Experience. L. R. Demott, De- troit Diesel Allison, GMC, Indianapolis, Ind. The concept of utilizing computers to monitor and diagnose aircraft engine operating health is relatively recent. One of the first of these systems to be developed for the military environment was the Inflight Engine Condition Monitoring System (IECMS) developed for the US Navy A7-E Attack aircraft. This system has pro- gressed through several stages of development and is currently operational in 2 Attack Squadrons. Continued system development is planned to expand capabilities and increase overall cost effectiveness. 801224. (SP-478) TriStar Engine Monitoring in British Airways. Ed R. White, Special Projects, British Airways. This paper describes the system operated by BA to monitor the RB21 1 engines in their three fleets of TriStars and the philosophy which led to its design and integration with the existing maintenance structure. It is regarded as a successful, cost-effective system, having its major benefits in the maintenance area, but also of considerable use in repair-shop, logistics, and engine management fields. Some examples of successful uses are described and parallels are drawn between it and the guidelines of ARP 1587. Like the authors of that document, BA recognises the importance of 'people planning' in the operation of EMS, rather than total reliance upon automated systems and the outputs, for example, have been designed to make for rapid interpretation by line engineering staff rather than by computer or thermodynamics experts. 801225. (SP-478) An Alternative Approach to Engine Rating Structures Using Monitoring Systems. C. H. Buck and D. Lewis, Rolls-Royce Ltd. Optimising the engine size to the multi-engine helicopter's needs is a difficult process which has traditionally been carried out through the mechanism of the engine rating structure. However, the rating structure has many limi- tations and does not allow the best potential use of the engine to be realised in service. The introduction of the micro-processor based Engine Monitoring System permits a re-evaluation of the rating structure and also the presentation of limitations to the pilots. By using EMS it should be possible to achieve a better relationship between the demonstrated capability of the engine as shown in the Qualification Programme and the authorised release for inservice use. This may be regarded as a first step to be followed later by a change of the qualification test to a more representative form with the EMS giving a more tangible link between bench test and customer operation. This should allow better use of the engine to be made for the short time/high power requirement thereby allowing a more efficient engine performance at cruise conditions. 801226.

AV-8B Operational Features for Rapid Deploy- ment. R. G. Showers, McDonnell Aircraft Com- pany, McDonnell Douglas Corporation, St. Louis, Missouri. The Marine Corps Vertical and Short Take-off and Landing (V/STOL) AV-8B light attack aircraft's opera- tional features will enhance the tactical air support required by the Rapid Deployment Force (RDF). With its ability for vertical and short takeoff and vertical landing, the AV-8B gives the RDF the potential to enhance basing flexibility. In addition to its unique V/STOL character- istics the AV-8B has an unfueled ferry range of over 2000 nautical miles. It can also carry 2270 kilograms (5000 pounds) of ordnance to 500 nautical miles radius without refueling. 801230. Overview of Aviation Energy Programs and Supply Problems. Robert Bowles, Aviation Con- servation, U.S. Department of Energy; and John V. Cignatta, Mueller Associates, Inc., Baltimore, MD. In order for aviation to remain an efficient, cost-effective means of transportation, a comprehensive and systematic program to alleviate the industry's petroleum dependency is necessary. This paper describes research being con- ducted to 1) assess problem areas affecting production of current jet aviation fuels, 2) evaluate energy conservation measures, and 3) develop alternative fuels. 801231. Unistructure - A New Concept for Light Weight Integrally Stiffened Skin Structures. Daniel J. Brimm, Chem-tronics, Inc., El Cajon, CA. Unistructure is a new concept for light weight integral rib-reinforced skin structures that is readily adaptable to many configurations. The rib cross sections are a form of I beam. The rib reinforcing patterns considered here are isogrid and waffle, (i.e. triangular and rectangular con- structions) but any desirable form can be produced. This paper provides an over-view of the methods of fabrication and the structural performance features of Unistructure. Comparisons are made with honeycomb, skin/stringer, and integral-machined structures. These comparisons indicate that the combined ease-of-fabri- cation and performance advantages of Unistructure warrant its consideration in many applications. 801232. Dynamic Testing of Nuclear Power Plant Struc- tures - An Evaluation. H. J. Weaver, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, CA. Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) eval- uated the application of system identification techniques to the dynamic testing of nuclear power plant structures and subsystems. These experimental techniques involve exciting a structure and measuring, digitizing, and processing the time-history motions that result. The data can be compared to parameters calculated using finite element or other models of the test systems to validate the model and to verify the seismic analysis. This report summarizes work in three main areas: (1) analytical qualification of a set of computer programs developed at LLNL to extract model parameters from the time histories; (2) examination of the feasibility of safely exciting nuclear power plant structures and accurately recording the resulting time-history power plant structures and accurately recording the resulting time-history mo- tions; (3) study of how the model parameters that are extracted from the data be used to evaluate structural integrity and analyze nuclear power plants. 1980 SA E Transactions 801233.

Lonny K. McClung, Naval Air Station Miramar, San Diego, CA. TOPGUN provides graduate level training to select USN/USMC fighter aircrews for the purpose of devel- oping instructors to act as weapons training officers in fleet fighter squadrons. TACTS is one of the key elements in providing the high quality of training required for these aircrews and is used on 70% of the syllabus sorties. 801237. The Development of a Lightweight Aircraft Towing Tractor. N. D. Eryou and W. J. Owens, DEW Engineering and Development Ltd.; and R. D. Herbert, Dept. of National Defence. A lightweight (8000 lbf (35.6 Kn) drawbar pull) four wheel drive aircraft towing tractor was developed under contract to the Canadian Department of National Defence. The paper describes the requirement, the design objectives, the resulting vehicle, and performance testing results. The modular design of the vehicle lends itself to upgrading of drawbar pull via the substitution of alternate engine/transmission packages plus ballasting. 801238. Rebuild of Aircraft Ground Support Equipment. N. D. Eryou, DEW Engineering and Devel- opment Ltd.; and Michael P. Jacobs, Airway Services. The concept of relife or remanufacturing of older ground support equipment to current specifications is examined in detail. This approach is gaining in acceptance due to the high replacement cost of ground support equipment, and the financial pressure on airlines due to rising fuel costs and aircraft replacement costs. The technical and economic aspects of relife are examined and examples of several relife projects are discussed. 801239. F-15 Nose Landing Gear Shimmy, Taxi Test and Correlative Analyses. Daniel T. Grossman, McDonnell Aircraft Co., McDonnell Douglas Corp. F-15 taxi tests and analyses were performed to evaluate the effects of aircraft design changes on nose landing gear shimmy. Preliminary analytical studies indicated that these changes would have an adverse effect on shimmy speed. This was of particular concern because limit cycle shimmy had been experienced on the baseline gear for cases with out-of-tolerance strut torsional freeplay. The trade-offs considered in the choice of a taxi test over a laboratory dynamometer test are presented. Operational aspects of the taxi test are discussed. Several instances of limit cycle shimmy were encountered during testing and results indicate that shimmy speed is a function of strut torsional freeplay. A description of the math model used in the non-linear analyses is provided. Analytical results are presented in terms of shimmy speed versus strut torsional freeplay. These results confirm the limit cycle nature of the shimmy phenomenon and correlate well with the taxi test results. Additional analyses are presented indicating the sensitivity of the shimmy to changes in tire parameter values and strut frictional coefficients. As- sumptions used in the development of an equivalent linear math model are given. 1980 SA E Transactions 801241. An Affordable "Means of Increasing Sea-Based Air Power. Robert W. Kress, Grumman Aero- space Corporation. A new concept of naval air operations, involving surface combatants equipped with long range air/surface missiles, and ten small, high-altitude, high-speed and long-range surveillance/missileer aircraft for targeting and attack, is described. Results of an affordability analysis of this concept are presented. Grumman's Design 698 aircraft, conceived for this role, is described, and its compatibility with a new conceptual surface combatant ship class, the "DGV", is presented. The current status of the devel- opment program directed toward a Design 698 Tech- nology Research Aircraft is described. 801242. The Domain of the Turboprop Airplane. J. W. Sandford, The de Havilland Aircraft of Canada Ltd. Turboprop and jet transport aircraft entered commercial air service at about the same time. However, the higher speed of the jets and the relatively low cost of fuel made the turboprop non-competitive, first on the long-haul routes and subsequently on all but the very shortest range passenger routes. All this has changed dramatically with the rise in fuel prices and the advent of deregulation. The paper deals first with the cost of fuel and its effect on turbofan and turboprop aircraft operating costs and a forecast of future equipment applications to short-haul traffic is made. This is followed by projections of how the technology of the 1980's will be used and how the turboprop airplane resurgence will occur. 801243. Commuter Turboprop Propulsion Technology. R. Hirschkron and R. E. Warren, General Electric Co., Lynn, Ma. The range of sizes and types of turboprop powerplants in current commuter service are discussed.

General Electric is conducting a Propulsion Study for NASA as part of the Small Transport Advanced Technology (STAT) program.

Thirty- and fifty-passenger commuter aircraft were defined to illustrate the potential improvement possible with advanced turboprops. Selec- tion studies and evaluation procedures of the cycle and advanced design features suitable for these engines are discussed. 801244. (SP-476) Factors Affecting the Future of Com- mercial Aviation. N. R. Pārmet, Trans World Airlines, Inc. Mr. Parmet provides a comparison of technical fore- casting as it was in 1935 when Bill Littlewood was Chief Engineer for American Airlines with today's conditions. Now we have ecological, environmental, political, as well as economic factors impinging heavily on design concepts for the future. In particular, fuel costs have an overriding influence on design. There is a great need for research and development into all aspects of design that can compen- sate and override the economic penalties of these factors. 801300. (P-88) Mechanisms of Cervical Spine Injury During Impact to the Protected Head. Voigt R. Hodgson and L. Murray Thomas, Department of Neurosurgery, Wayne State University School of Medicine. Static and impact loading of the heads of embalmed cadavers wearing protective helmets have been conducted for the purpose of understanding the mechanics of fracture-dislocation injury to the cervical spine. Some of the cadavers were cut down on one side of the neck for high-speed photographic observation of the spine during impact. Others were instrumented with strain gages on the bodies and near the facets to assist in correlating spine movements and load configuration with strain distri- bution. Results indicate that static loading can be a useful predictor of failure site under dynamic conditions. Those conditions which were found to be most influential on injury site and level of strain were: 1) The extent to which the head was gripped by the impact surface to allow or restrict motion at the a tlanto-occipi tal junction; 2) Impact location; and 3) Impact force alignment with the spine. 1980 SA E Transactions 801301. (P-88) Experimental Studies of Side Impact to the Human Head. A. Nahum, C. Ward, E. Raasch, S. Adams and D. Schneider, University of California, San Diego. This study continues previous experimental studies which review the characteristics of the side impact exposure to the human head. We conducted a series of two exper- iments. The first series included four sequential impacts which were performed on a single embalmed specimen. This series of impacts showed a good correspondence between peak head acceleration and HIC and confirmed the adequacy of instrument placement and data analysis. The second series studied five impacts performed on individual unembalmed cadavers. The results suggest that side impacts produced pressure gradients in the brain. These superimposed gradients were proportional to the magnitudes of the head acceleration components. The largest component was found to be in the direction of impact and produced positive pressures near the impact and negative pressures opposite the impact. We found that a pressure limiting mechanism acted on the contra-coup side of the brain. Subarachnoid hemorrhages occurred on the high stress and strain brain surfaces. Approximate values for the pressures were determined in computer simulations. Changes in the model and instrumentation are needed in order to improve the accuracy of the computed pressures, changes in the model and instru- mentation. The acceleration traces contained vibration or noise which made calculation of rotation acceleration and velocity impossible. The model needs a better represen- tation for the midsaggital sinus. 1980 SA E Transactions 801302. (P-88) The Evoked Potential: An Experimental Method for Biomechanical Analysis of Brain and Spinal Injury. A. Sanees, Jr., R. Weber, J. Myklebust, J. Cusick, S. Larson, P. Walsh, T. Christoffel and C. Houterman, Department of Neurosurgery, The Medical College of Wiscon- sin and VA Medical Center; C. Ewing and D. Thomas, Naval Biodynamics Laboratory, New Orleans, Louisiana; and B. Saltzberg, Texas Research Institute of Mental Sciences, Houston, Texas. Axial forces were applied between the shoulders and the skull of eight male Macaca mulatta monkeys. Forces from 556 to 1444 Newtons produced marked changes in blood pressure, heart rate and distraction of the cervical spinal column with minimal ligamentous disruption. Somatosen- sory evoked potentials recorded at the cortical and thalamic levels following dorsal column or peripheral nerve stimulation were altered prior to or during changes in heart rate or blood pressure. Similar findings were observed in the efferent responses recorded from elec- trodes placed on the thoracic spinal cord following stimulation of sensorimotor cortex. Studies in four monkey cadaveric isolated cervical column preparations indicate that disruption occurs with axial loads which are approximately one-third of the maximum used in the in vivo studies. 1980 SA E Transactions 801303. (P-88) Human Head Tolerance to Sagittal Im- pact Reliable Estimation Deduced from Exper- imental Head Injury Using Subhuman Primates and Human Cadaver Skulls. Koshiro Ono, 157</page><page sequence="139">801304-801306 Astumi Kikuchi and Marumi Nakamura, Japan Automobile Research Institute, Inc., Hajime Kobayashi, Faculty of Engineering, University of Tokyo; and Norio Nakamura, Department of Neurosurgery, Jikei-kai University. To investigate the human head impact tolerance in terms of changes in vital functions, a series of head impact experiments was performed using live monkeys, which are morphologically analogous to humans. To find a causal relationship between the impact and changes in vital functions, three kinds of experimental conditions were used: translational acceleration impact and rotational acceleration impact (both using a head restraint mask with broad contact area), and impact of the unrestrained head against a padded flat surface. The results indicated that the concussion, cerebral contusion and skull fracture in the monkeys depended on: i) the translational and rotational acceleration impact; ii) the contact area of the impact; iii) the amplitude and duration of the imposed head acceleration; iv) the direction of the impact region (whether frontal or occipital). It was also determined that, of these three patterns of injury, the threshold for the occurrence of concussion is a tolerance threshold (i.e., it indicates transitory and reversible effects). A curve was drawn up for the threshold of concussion occurrence (TCO) in monkeys. Further, the fracture threshold curve for human cadaver skulls was obtained experimentally. Dimensional analysis and the similarity principle were then used to extrapolate the human threshold for the occurrence of concussion from that obtained experimen- tally for monkeys, and thus to derive the human head impact tolerance curve. At the same time a comparison was made between the human cadaver skull fracture threshold curve and the monkey skull fractures to confirm the reliability of the estimation of the human head impact tolerance. 1980 SA E Transactions 801304. (P-88) Intracranial Pressure - A Brain Injury Criterion. Carley Ward and Marian Chan, Biodynamics/Engineering Inc.; and Alan Nahum, University Hospital, University of Cal- ifornia, San Diego, CA. Head impacts in animal and human cadaver tests and in aircraft accidents are simulated using finite element brain models. Brain injury severity is correlated with peak intracranial pressure. The results show that serious and fatal injuries occur when the pressures exceed 34 psi. Considering this value to be the pressure tolerance limit of the brain, a brain injury criterion is proposed. Tolerance curves of head acceleration versus time for frontal and occipital impacts are presented. These the brain pressure tolerance curves are compared to existing head injury criteria (the Wayne State tolerance curve, the Vienna Institute model tolerance, the maximum strain criterion from the University of Michigan, the helmet standard, and the head injury criterion used by the Department of Transportation). 1980 SA E Transactions 801305. (P-88) Thoraco-Abdominal Response and Injury. G. S. Nusholtz and J. W. Melvin, Highway Safety Research Institute, The University of Michigan; and G. Mueller, J. R. MacKenzie and R. Burney, Department of Surgery, The Uni- versity of Michigan. This study investigates the response of human cadavers, and live anesthetized and post-mortem primates and canines, to blunt lateral thoraco-abdominal impact. There were 12 primates: 5 post-mortem and 7 live anesthetized; 10 canines; 1 post-mortem and 9 live anesthetized; and 3 human cadavers. A 10 kg free-flying mass was used to administer the impact in the right to left direction. To produce the varying degrees of injury, factors including velocity, padding of the impactor surface, location of impact site, and impactor excursion were adjusted. The injuries were evaluated by gross autopsy, and in the case of live subjects, current clinical methods such as sequential peritoneal lavage and biochemical assays were also employed. Mechanical measurements included force time history, intraortic pressure, and high-speed cineradiogra- phy to define gross organ motion. 1980 SA E Transactions 801306. (P-88) Evaluation of Pelvic Fracture Tolerance in Side Impact. Dominique Cesari, Michelle Ramet and Pierre- Yves Clair, Organisme Na- tional De Sécurité Routière, Laboratoire des Chocs et de Biomécanique, Bron, France. Pelvic fracture is a typical lesion sustained by the occupant of a vehicle involved in a lateral impact collision who is seated on the impact side. If this fracture is generally not severe by itself, it is nevertheless often associated with severe abdominal lesions. Study of injury mechanisms in lateral impact collisions shows that there are two ways of ensuring a better protection of the occupant in this type of accident: first by preventing intrusion so that the contact velocity "oc- cupant/inner door" is decreased, secondly by absorbing the shock of the occupant against the inner door, especially at pelvis and thorax levels. It is necessary to have a good knowledge of human tolerance to fracture of the considered body segment in order to determine the mechanical properties of the padding material. The aim of this study is to determine the tolerance of the human pelvis. This study takes into account results of 36 impact tests against the pelvis of 10 cadavers and proposes injury criteria values to characterize the risk of pelvic fracture. 1980 SA E Transactions 158</page><page sequence="140">801307-801310 801307. (P-88) Side Impact Sled and Padding Devel- opment. Michael W. Monk, Richard M. Morgan and Lisa K. Sullivan, U.S. Department of Transportation, National Highway Traffic Safe- ty Administration. In a one year laboratory study, a side impact sled was designed, built, and validated. Using the sled and a newer generation of side impact dummy, a number of energy- absorbing materials were tested and superior materials identified. Initially this study concentrated on the crash test data for a number of V.W. Rabbits crashed in a previously completed study. The crashed vehicles were obtained, and interior crush tests were performed with a specially designed body form. This was done to determine how the effective stiffness (as seen by the occupant of the struck vehicle) of the interior door increases as the bullet vehicle presses against the interior door trim from the opposite side. An acceleration-type sled buck was then designed and built with an "interior door" mounted to mimic the interior stiffness determined from the crush tests. The sled was dynamically tested with a Haversine sled pulse similar to the door crash pulse. The sled was validated by reproducing the crash environment of a car-to-car colli- sion. The criteria considered for matching the two were: (1) acceleration- time curve of the interior door, (2) the velocity-time curve of the interior door, (3) kinematics of the Part 572 surrogate, and (4) accelerations on the surrogate. 801308. (P-88) Occupant Velocity Change in Side Impact Method of Calculation - Application to a Sample of Real-World Crashes. J. Y. Foret-Bruno, F. Hartemann, C. Thomas and C. Tarrière, Labor- atoire de Physiologie et de Biomécanique, As- sociation Peugeot S.A. - Renault, France; B. Loyat, Centre d'Etudes Peugeot, France; G. Stcherbatcheff, Direction des Recherches et Développements Automobiles - Renault, France; C. Got and A. Patel, Institut de Recherches Orthopédiques, Hôpital Raymond Poincaré - Garches, France. So far, analysis of real-world crashes has not made it possible to evaluate the occupant change of velocity in side impact. This change of velocity is the most pertinent of the lateral-collision violence parameters when occu- pants are exposed to intrusion by car bodies. The present paper describes a method for calculating this parameter, and includes a description of the data that must be collected concerning real-world crashes in order to enable its application. The validity of this method is demonstrated by its application to a series of experimental collisions. The results are highly correlated to the values resulting from the integration of the accelerations found for the pelvis and thorax. The method is then applied to 60 real-world car-to-car side collisions from the accident survey. The AISs for the pelvis and thorax of the car occupants involved are much more closely related to the occupant AV calculated, on the one hand, for the pelvis and, on the other hand, for the thorax, than they are to the AV of the car and to impact velocity. Lastly, for the given occupant AV values, corre- spondences are established between the acceleration levels found with the Hybrid II dummy and the degree of severity of the injuries sustained by living individuals and by cadavers. 1980 SA E Transactions 801309. (P-88) Influence of Initial Length of Lap- Shoulder Belt on Occupant Dynamics - A Com- parison of Sled Testing and MVMA-2D Mod- eling. David C. Viano, Clyde C. Culver and Bert C. Prisk, Biomedical Science Department, Gen- eral Motors Research Labs. The primary purpose of this parameter study was to carefully document occupant dynamics in well-controlled sled tests for comparison with simulated responses from the MVMA-2D analytical model. The test involved a Part 572 dummy exposed to a frontal deceleration while on a bucket seat and restrained by a lap-shoulder belt system. The length of belt webbing was incrementally increased from a snug configuration by as much as 30 cm. The addition of webbing increased the forward excursion, velocity, and acceleration of the head, chest, and hip without affecting the peak tension in the belt segments of the restraint system. Belt tension was identified as a poor measure of the horizontal load on the chest due to significant reaction forces in the lateral and vertical direction at the belt anchorages. The advanced belt system subprogram of the MVMA-2D model had to be modified to account for the influence of the lateral anchorage location on belt tensions and the planar restraint of the occupant. Although reasonable agreement was achieved in simulating the occupant dynamics, belt loads were dissimilar. The MVMA-2D model is judged to be a sophisticated, delicate tool requiring additional study and refinement. 1980 SA E Transactions 801310. (P-88) Occupant Dynamics as a Function of Impact Angle and Belt Restraint. John D. Horsch, Biomedical Science Department, Gen- eral Motors Research Lab. Sled tests were conducted to investigate the dynamics of a Part 572 dummy as a function of the belt restraint configuration and impact direction. The tests involved a 35 km/h velocity change and 10 g deceleration. An "opened" fixture, free of intervening surfaces, was oriented from frontal (0°), through oblique (±30°, ±45°, ±60°), to full lateral (±90°). Restraint by only a lap belt resulted in the dummy's 159</page><page sequence="141">801311-801313 upper body rotating about the lap belt and continuing in the direction of sled deceleration. Restraint by a lap- shoulder belt greatly reduced upper-body displacement. However, the displacement and body loading were strongly dependent on the direction of deceleration, i.e., the orientation of the belt relative to the impact direction. When the belted shoulder was opposite the impact (0° to +90°), the belt retained the upper body for impact angles of 0° to 45°. Although the upper body escaped from the shoulder belt from 60° to 90°, significant kinetic energy was removed from the upper body before escape, even for full lateral deceleration. When the belted shoulder was on the impact side (0° to -90°), the upper body was restrained for all impact angles. However, the shoulder belt acted directly on the neck with increasing load as the impact became more lateral. Addition of lateral torso restraint, such as with a winged seat greatly reduced the loading of the neck by the shoulder belt for all impact angles. 1980 SA E Transactions 801311. (P-88) Mechanisms of Injury to Vehicle Occu- pants Restrained by Three-Point Seat Belts. Dainius J. Dalmotas, Vehicle Systems Division, Road and Motor Vehicle Traffic Safety Branch, Transport Canada. This paper summarizes the findings of a study undertaken by Transport Canada to examine the primary mechanisms of injury to front seat occupants restrained by conven- tional three-point seat belt assemblies. The study involved the early retrospective investigation of collisions, in defined geographic areas across Canada, in which at least one occupant involved was fully restrained. The pattern of injury to 314 full restrained occupants who sustained at least one injury at the AIS 2 or greater severity level is examined in the present paper. Overall, the head/face and chest were found to be the most frequently injured body regions. In the case of drivers, facial injuries were invariably associated with the steering wheel, whereas head injury was more likely to be associated with interior side and roof structures. Injuries to the shoulder/chest and pelvic/abdomen regions among drivers were usually associated with direct contact with either the steering wheel or the interior side surfaces. Passengers were found more likely to sustain shoul- der/chest and abdominal injuries from the seat belt itself. Injuries to the lower extremity complex consisted largely of knee, lower leg, and ankle-foot fractures. Femur fractures were observed only at the extreme end of the collision severity spectrum. In the absence of any intrusion or rear occupant loading of the front seat back, injuries were generally confined to below the AIS 4 severity level. While further reductions in the incidence of fatal or life threatening injuries will likely necessitate major improvements to the structural integrity of the vehicle itself, there appears to be scope for the further reduction of injuries at the AIS 2 and 3 levels through more careful design of the seat belt and the interior structures. 1980 SA E Transactions 801312. (P-88) Biodynamic Response of the Musculoskel- etal System to Impact Acceleration. P. C. Begeman, A. I. King and R. S. Levine, Bioengi- neering Center, Wayne State University; and D. C. Viano, Biomedical Science Department, Gen- eral Motors Technical Center. The effect of muscular response on occupant dynamics was studied in human volunteers exposed to low level impact acceleration. The study includes identification of muscular response, correlation of electromyographic activity with reaction force, and investigation of the effects of muscular restraint during impact. Human volunteers were subjected to -Gx impact acceleration in a simulated automobile environment while EMG activity of various lower extremity muscles was monitored. The seat and floor pan were supported on load cells which measured all restraining forces. Nine-accelerometer mod- ules and high-speed photography were used to measure kinematics. Identical runs were made with an embalmed cadaver and dummy for comparison. Static EMG and force traces as well as dynamic results for various acceleration levels are presented. Differences between tensed and relaxed states are com- pared and discussed as to EMG response, force levels, and head kinematics. It was found that reflex responses of the relaxed volunteer are too slow to have a significant effect on loads and accelerations sustained. However, the voluntary pre-impact contracted musculature in a volunteer can reduce certain acceleration levels and change the restraint load distribution so that significantly more load goes through the legs to the floor board with a concomitant lowering of seat and belt loads. Although a similar load distribution was seen in dummy and cadaver tests, the response of the relaxed or tensed volunteer was sub- stantially different from either surrogate. 1980 SA E Transactions 801313. (P-88) Biomechanical Data of Children. G. Sttirtz, Daimler-Benz AG, Stuttgart, Germany. Up till now, biomechanical data have been determined mostly for older adults. Only few results are known for middle-aged persons and almost nothing is known about biomechanical levels of the injury tolerance of children. The limited knowledge of biomechanical data of children is contrary to the increasing need for an efficient layout of exterior vehicle elements as well as restraint systems. Therefore, the following methods were used to find out biomechanical load limits as well as tendencies of the loading capacity of children: - extensive research of medical/technical literature has given results concerning the overall organism, body tissue, head, thorax, abdomen, pelvis, and lower extremities. 160</page><page sequence="142">801314-801341 - mechanics of similitude have given results for the head region. (Data Scaling) - analysis of real pedestrian accidents has given results for the head region and lower extremities. - repetition tests of real traffic accidents using modified anthropometric dummies have given results for the head, neck, thorax, abdomen, pelvis, and lower extremities. Based on these results, biomechanical critical load values as well as protection criteria will be given with regard to frontal/dorsal as well as lateral/medial body load directions. 1980 SA E Transactions 801314. (P-88) A Review of Different Kinematic Forms in Two-Wheel-Accidents - Their Influence on Ef- fectiveness of Protective Measures. Dietmar Otte, Institute of Automotive Engineering, Ber- lin Technical University. Starting directly at the scene of the accident facts about 127 motorized and 136 non-motorized two-wheel acci- dents that occurred in Hanover, West Germany, have been collected and analysed. These accidents were analysed case by case and in this publication, an attempt is made to provide a survey with regard to the collision mechanism and the injuries sustained by the involved cyclist. Measures to reduce the number of accidents as well as to influence the course of the accidents, are shown. The characteristic injury patterns and kinematic motions provide the guidelines for further security measures and serve as the basis for experimental tests. 1980 SA E Transactions 801315. (P-88) A Preliminary Assessment of the Potential for Pedestrian Injury Reduction Through Vehicle Design. S. J. Ashton, Accident Research Unit, Department of Transportation and Environ- mental Planning, University of Birmingham, (England). A comparison is made between two different strategies for reducing the severity of the injuries sustained by pedes- trians struck by the fronts of cars or car derivatives. The benefits obtainable from each strategy are determined by first assessing the effect on a sample of real accidents and then weighting the results to estimate the effect on the total population. It is shown that one of the strategies, aimed at reducing the frequency of serious head injuries, would result in a less than 5% reduction in the number of casualties with non-minor injuries, whereas the other strategy, aimed at reducing the frequency of serious leg and pelvic injuries, would result in a reduction of at least 25% in the number of casualties with non-minor injuries. It is concluded that the adoption of full face compliant front structures offers the best initial approach to the problem of pedestrian injury mitigation. 1980 SA E Transactions 801316. (P-88) Causes and Measurement of Vehicle Aggressiveness in Frontal Collisions. Thomas F. MacLaughlin, Roger A. Saul and Samuel Daniel, Jr., U.S. Department of Transportation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administra- tion. This paper presents an analysis of the results of a series of crash tests conducted by the NHTSA to identify structural parameters contributing to vehicle aggressiveness in frontal collisions between large and small cars. Effects of front structure stiffness, engine mass and engine position were investigated. In addition, an analytical study of car-to-car and car-to-barrier crashes is reported. A lumped parameter car model was used with multiple linear regression analysis to determine the significance of specific vehicle parameters on aggressiveness, and the capabilities of different types of barriers to "measure" that aggressiveness. 1980 SA E Transactions 801317.

The origin and development of the Head Injury Criterion (HIC) has been reviewed. The concept of correlating internal head injury with measured kinematics has also been re-examined. It is concluded that since no general kinematic correlation can be developed, the HIC concept is invalid. Recent attempts to develop relationships between head injury AIS and HIC, are shown to substantiate this view. Alternatives to HIC are reviewed and other approaches to head injury assessment are proposed. 1980 SA E Transactions 801340. (SP-471) Automotive Powertrains - Now and into the 1990s. H. A.

Kane, Standard Oil Co. of California. A rational scenario for likely fuels and lubricants trends over the next 20-25 years can be based on fairly precise knowledge of the technology that will be available. For the near term, increasing recognition of the constraints imposed by limited petroleum supplies, rising costs, and governmental regulations will result in efforts to maximize the efficient use of petroleum liquids as transportation fuels. These efforts will include optimization of the petroleum product mix, broadening of fuel specifications, greater use of fuel additives to provide acceptable fuel quality, and new lubricants including new chemical additives to improve overall vehicle fuel economy. Beyond 1990, synthetic fuels and advanced lubricants formula- tions will begin to make their contribution. Such interin- dustry groups as the SAE Fuels and Lubricants Activity and the Coordinating Research Council will play increas- ingly important roles during this period of great change. 1980 SAE Transactions 801343.

Two strategies for maintaining automotive mobility - improvement of fuel economy, and production of syn- thetic fuels - are compared with regard to their potential for replacement of petroleum, their investment require- ments, and marginal consumer cost. If the necessary capital can be made available, the strategies can be competitive with expected prices of imported petroleum, and can replace 2.9 million barrels per day (MBD) of petroleum by 1990 and 6.1 MBD by 2000. 1980 SAE Transactions 801344.

European Diesel engine design, test facilities and test costs have created the necessity for test procedures designed to evaluate the performance of engine lubricants in Euro- pean engine test laboratories. This situation may be compared with the application of Caterpillar engine test procedures in the U.S.A. In this discussion the MWM-B, CEC L-12-A-76 procedure, is reviewed under the following headings: Outline of test method Discrimination between reference and European commercial oils Correlation with field service requirements of pro- duction multi-cylinder Diesel engines Application of the MWM-B procedure and compar- ison of results obtained with singlegrade and multigrade Diesel engine oils. 1980 SAE Transactions 801345.

A synthetic diesel engine oil and gear lubricant show substantial fuel savings over conventional premium quality lubricants under widely different test conditions and test procedures. Significant fuel economy improve- ments, ranging up to six percent, from the use of synthetic lubricants in heavy-duty diesel trucks, are documented in a laboratory engine test, vehicle chassis rolls tests and ATA (American Trucking Association) Type 1 two- truck over-the-road tests. These fuel savings have been con- firmed in closely monitored fleet tests in both long-haul and delivery service for up to two years of testing and approximately four million miles (6.4 million km) of operation. Heavy-duty 290-365 hp diesel engines pro- duced by the four most popular US builders were included in the fleet tests. A summary of the economics of energy savings using synthetic lubricants is discussed. 801347. (SP-472) The Development and Performance of Multigrade Super Tractor Universal Oils. P. J. Morris and E.

The demand for Super Tractor Universal Oils (STUO) which can be used to lubricate all the major parts of a tractor is on the increase. This paper reviews the history of such oils and presents the formulation experience and performance of multigraded oils meeting todays require- ments.

A number of multigrade diesel engine oils meeting API Service Classification CD, including those of Super Tractor Oil Universal (STUO) type, were tested in a standard multicylinder diesel test engine. The range in performance of these commercial oils in regard to piston deposits, wear, oil deterioration, and oil consumption was wide, but similar to that of SAE 30 oils of the same Service Classification. The wide variability in oil performance indicates engine oil test criteria of API Service Classi- fication CD do not adequately address the concerns of diesel engine manufacturers.

(SP-472) Fuel Economy Lubricants in Heavy Duty Road Service. Edwin C. Younghouse and Walter E. Waddey, Exxon Research and Engi- neering Co.; and Robert P. Schmidt, Exxon Co., U.S.A. Newly formulated lubricants for high-speed diesels in vehicular service improved the fuel economy of a truck fleet using fuel efficient oils in controlled operations by 3 to 3.7% (confidence interval = ±1%), relative to three conventional commercial heavy duty oils. In this service, with fully warmed-up engines, multigrade SAE 15W-40 and single grade SAE 30 oils gave equivalent fuel economy. However, in a diesel car in cold-start commuter service, an SAE 15W-40 gave about a 3.8 ± 2.0% fuel economy benefit, relative to the SAE 30 version of the same formulation. The evaluation of fuel economy differences for crankcase oils in uncontrolled diesel truck fleets is often futile. The randomness of the operation produces impre- cise results that prevent drawing conclusions with con- fidence. Controlled operation, with statistical adjustment of the data, is required for meaningful results. Care must also be taken to ensure consistency of engine conditions. The 3% benefit in fuel economy from a fuel efficient lubricant translates into large savings for highway diesel applications. A reasonable estimate for the U.S.A. is eleven million barrels of fuel saved per year. 801350. CRC Investigates Cool-Weather Driveability and Customer Satisfaction. W. C. Williams and D. K. Lawrence, Amoco Oil Co., J. E. Robinson, The Standard Oil Co. (Ohio); and D. B. Heck, Mobil Research and Development Corp. In early 1978, the Coordinating Research Council (CRC) conducted a program to investigate customer opinions of vehicle driveability during cool-weather, 30 to 70° F. About 100 owners of 1973-78 model vehicles participated in the program and frequently completed a questionnaire about the driveability of their vehicle. For comparison, trained raters also evaluated the driveability of these vehicles. Results show that hesitation is the most frequent driveability problem in customer service and stalls while driving are the most objectionable. Customers found driveability problems were noticeably affected by gasoline volatility and customer satisfaction varied from 62 to 93 percent with the fuels tested. The trained rater results confirm that the Driveability Index developed by CRC in 1972, can be used to relate customer opinions of driveability to changes in fuel volatility. 801351. Influence of Fuel Volatility on Customer Per- ception of Cold Start Driveability. J. E. Robin- son, The Standard Oil Co. (Ohio). A program was conducted to determine if customers would recognize differences in cold start driveability as influenced by fuel volatility. Results showed that cus- tomers did notice differences in vehicle driveability as gasoline volatility was changed. Customer preference of fuel volatility was 52 percent for the most volatile fuel, 32 percent for an intermediate volatile fuel and 16 percent for the lowest volatile fuel available in this test. Customers perception of cold start driveability was similar to cold start performance as measured by the CRC procedure. 801352. Evaluation of MTBE Gasoline by Japanese Passenger Cars. Shintaro Miyawaki, Kazuto Date, Yukio Akasaka and Tsutomu Maeda, Nippon Mining Co., Ltd. (Japan). Performance and the compatibility of methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) as a blending component for motor gasolines were assessed for Japanese passenger cars. MTBE was found to be an excellent road octane booster. But fuel consumption and exhaust emissions of MTBE-containing gasoline were observed to differ from conventional gasoline. The addition of MTBE changed the equivalence ratio of the mixture and reduced the calorific value of the fuel. Engine cleanliness, ORI and crankcase oil deterio- ration were not influenced by MTBE gasoline. MTBE gasoline was compatible with the elastomers and metals used for fuel system of Japanese passenger cars and was found to behave similarly to conventional gasoline. From these results, MTBE was judged to be an excellent octane appreciator in motor fuel for Japanese passenger cars. 1980 SAE Transactions 801353. A Device and Technique for Determining the Octane Requirements of Individual Cylinders of an Engine. L. B. Graiff, W. M. Ehrhardt and E. J. Haury, Shell Development Co.

Basically the instrument functions by retard- ing the spark timing of all cylinders except the one being rated. A detailed schematic diagram of the Selective Ignition Retard Device (SIRD) is included in the paper to allow construction of the unit by interested parties. SIRD has been employed in studies aimed at elucidating the factors affecting octane requirements of engines. Some typical test results are presented. 801354.

This paper summarizes octane number requirement trends 163</page><page sequence="145">801355-801359 of U.S. cars from 1971 through 1979, a period during which automakers strove to meet increasingly stringent fuel economy and exhaust emissions standards. It is based upon the annual nationwide surveys conducted by the Coordinating Research Council of current model domes- tic and imported light-duty vehicles sold in the United States. The maximum octane number requirement of the average 1971 model car was about 92 Research octane number (RON). After an initial drop of 3 units in the 1972 model year, average requirements increased throughout the remainder of the nine-year period to a level of 92 RON in 1979. Incidence of car owners reporting objec- tionable knock on the fuel they were using held at about 5% until 1975 when 10% objected. This number peaked at 20 percent in 1976 and then remained above 10 percent through 1979. 1 980 SAE Transactions 801355. Customer versus Rater Octane Number Require- ments - A 1978 CRC Study. Wilfred E. Bettoney and John D. Rogers, Jr., E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Co., Inc., Gerald W. Stanke, Ethyl Corp.; and Brian Y. Taniguchi, General Motors Research Laboratories. Trained raters determined octane requirements of 248 late model cars using the CRC E- 15 Technique and a new method simulating customer-type accelerations called the "Supplemental Technique." These requirements were compared with those reported by "customers" (car owners). The findings from this program substantiate results from a similar study made in 1975. The differences between the customer and rater requirements at the 50th percentiles were 1.9 Research Octane Number (RON) at E-15 part-throttle and 5.6 RON at E-15 maximum octane requirement conditions. With the Supplemental Technique, the difference was about 4 RON. Five percent of the customers objected to knock when using fuel matching rater requirements, 13 percent when using fuel 2 RON lower and 5 1 percent when using fuel 6 RON lower. Customer requirements were obtained twice, first with a questionnaire in which knock was not mentioned and then with one which posed direct questions regarding knock. Results were the same with both questionnaires. 1980 SA E Transactions 801356. A New Statistical Model for Predicting Customer Octane Satisfaction Using Trained-Rater Obser- vations. Robert N. Rodriguez and Brian Y. Taniguchi, General Motors Research Labora- tories, Warren, MI. Customer-determined and rater-determined octane num- ber requirements have historically been compared by the Coordinating Research Council (CRC) using the N + 1 and Quantified approaches. However, these analysis techniques oversimplify the relationship between customer and rater octane number requirements because they do not consider the bivariate and nonnormal nature of the data. Using a new statistical technique designed specifically for the analysis of bivariate nonnormal data, a model of the relationship between customer and rater octane number requirements has been developed. The model utilizes data from the 1978 CRC Customer/Rater Octane Number Requirement Program and was verified by "prediction" of the results from a similar CRC program conducted in 1975. Based on rater data from the 1979 CRC Octane Number Requirement Survey, the model predicts that 91 percent of the customers driving 1979 model year cars are satisfied with 91 Research octane number (RON) unleaded gasoline.

Charles M. Heinen, Chrysler Corp. The paper covers highlights of SAE activity on emissions control from the early efforts of Campbell and others in the 1930's to the present time. Evidence of substantial involvement in the Los Angeles "smog" composition led to the development of analytical tools for continuous evaluation of exhaust. With these tools and other basic information, it became possible to develop many control devices. Over 20 of these devices have been added as standards have tightened. The negative result has been increasing cost and complexity. The crankcase and evaporative systems have been controlled, but the principal emissions have come from the exhaust, and therefore most of the controls were directed to this source. Combustion within the engine has been the principal area of attention, but when this did not meet the requirements of the existing statues, combustion beyond the exhaust ports became important. Notable contri- butions to this art were air pumps, afterburners and catalysts. The thermodynamic and other considerations in- volved in the use of these devices are covered. The present situation as affected by smaller, lighter vehicles and extensive use of electronics is described. Recent cost and benefit estimates are reviewed. These appear to indicate that the benefits of the present, highly complex systems are far outweighed by the costs. Some suggestions for dealing with this situation are made. 1980 SAE Transactions 801359. Future Trends in the Control of Emissions from Motor Vehicles. Michael P. Walsh and George D.

Evaporative Emissions from Vehicles Operating on Methanol/Gasoline Blends. Ken R. Stamper, U.S. Department of Energy, Bartlesville Energy Technology Center, Bartlesville, OK. A series of evaporative emission tests was conducted to determine the influence of the addition of methanol to gasoline and length of service on evaporative emissions from light-duty vehicles. Results from these tests show that using a 10% methanol/90% gasoline blend increases evaporative emissions by 130% for short-term use and 220% for long-term use relative to the evaporative emissions produced using a reference gasoline. The evaporative hydrocarbon emissions produced when the vehicles were operating on the methanol blend had a slightly higher photochemical reactivity than those pro- duced from the reference gasoline. 1980 SA E Transactions 801361.

The Savannah River Plant, which is operated by the Du Pont Company for the Department of Energy, has successfully operated automotive and nonautomotive gasoline-powered equipment on three different blends of ethanol and unleaded gasoline. The conventional gasohol blend of 10% ethanol and 90% unleaded gasoline (10/90) has been used in addition to 15/85 and 20/80 blends. The plant fleet contains approximately 900 automotive and 250 nonautomotive units. The gasohol program began in July 1979. By October 1980, close to ten million miles will have been driven and almost one million gallons of gasohol consumed. 801362. (SP-473) Adaptation of the Penn State Microoxi- dation Test for the Evaluation of Automotive Lubricants. E. E. Klaus, L. Cho and H. Dang, Dept. of Chemical Engrg., The Pennsylvania State Univ., University Park, PA. The Penn State Microoxidation Test has been adapted for use with mineral oil base stocks and fully formulated automotive crankcase oils. Tests under nitrogen and air atmospheres coupled with analyses using gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and clay column adsorption provide for a semiquantitative analysis of the products by elution time (apparent molecular size). This test procedure allows for primary and secondary oxidation reaction rate studies after substantial quantities of the lubricant have been oxidized. Time-temperature studies can show the effectiveness of base oil quality as well as effects contributed by additives. A general time-temperature equivalence in the range of 200 to 225 °C has been demonstrated for a series of formulated engine oils. Microoxidation tests have been compared with III-C hot engine tests for a series of ASTM reference oils. 801363. (SP-473) The Prediction of ATF Service Life from Laboratory Oxidation Test Data. P. A. Willermet, L. R. Mahoney, S. K. Kandah and A. W. Sever, Research Staff, Ford Motor Co., Dearborn, MI. The Ford Aluminum Beaker Oxidation Test was devel- oped as an inexpensive and convenient test procedure for evaluating the thermooxidative stability of ATFs. This paper presents the results of a systematic study of ATF oxidation in this test and in vehicle service. The results show that ATF service life in vehicles could be predicted by extrapolating laboratory oxidation test data using temperature coefficients for oxidative processes. 801364. (SP-473) Laboratory Evaluation of Detergent Additives for Engine Oils. C. V. Folonari, P. Salino and E. Volpi, Centro Ricerche Fiat S.p.A.; and P. Volpi, FIAT Lubrificanti S.p.A. An apparatus for the laboratory evaluation of the detergent properties of additives in diesel engine oils is described. It consists of an oil sump and high temperature piston/cylinder simulators connected so as to provide a simulation of an engine oil lubrication circuit. The apparatus allows rapid evaluation of all aspects of detergency under controlled operating conditions. The results of a series of tests carried out with this apparatus are also reported. They suggest that good discrimination between the oils containing different detergent additives can be obtained. The results also indicate that the apparatus may be a useful tool in the investigation of various functions performed by detergent additives and the examination of synergistic effects between various additives contained in a fully formulated oil. 801366. (SP-473) Control of Engine Oil Acidity. S. J. Cartwright and L. R. Carey, Imperial Oil Ltd. Passenger car and diesel engine oils typically exhibit increases in acidity with service, particularly at extended oil drain intervals. The amount of acidity buildup is related to the extent of lubricant oxidation and the extent to which overbased additives are able to neutralize the acidic materials formed. This paper describes laboratory and field programs examining the relationship between service history, acid- ity/total acid numbers (TAN), used oil corrosivi ty, and the ability of lubricant additives to control corrosion. The neutralization of corrosive acids in the oil medium has been monitored by an infrared spectroscopic technique, a 165</page><page sequence="147">801367-801372 method found to be more meaningful than the classical TAN/TBN titration measurements. New insights have been gained into acidity control by metallic detergents, the concept of "reserve TBN", the types of acids formed in engine oils, and the performance of oils with very low metallic detergent treats. 1980 SA E Transactions 801367. (SP-473) Some Field Data and Future Trends in Diesel Passenger Car Engine Oils in Japan. Katsuhiko Uchibori and Shozo Hikosaka, Prod- uct Engineering Dept., Nippon Oil Co., Ltd. (Tokyo/ Japan). The rapid increase in the number of diesel passenger cars in Japan has resulted in renewed interest in the devel- opment of improved engine oils. This paper describes the factors affecting this devel- opment and includes the following topics: 1) Current quality of diesel passenger car engine oils 2) Drain intervals and used oil properties 3) Future performance requirements 4) Properties of Japanese diesel fuels 801368. (SP-473) Effect of Soot on Piston Deposits and Crankcase Oils - Infrared Spectrometric Tech- nique for Analyzing Soot. J. A. McGeehan and B. J. Fontana, Chevron Research Co., Rich- mond, CA. This paper reports the effects of diesel engine soot on piston deposits and the crankcase oil in a Mack Multicyl- inder engine. Its authors found in their study: (1) that diesel engine soot can be a predominant factor in the formation of piston deposits at high exhaust smoke density, (2) that the exhaust smoke density correlates with the soot content in the deposits and in the crankcase oil, and (3) that the soot content of deposits correlates with carbon deposit rating; and that the oxidized resin content of the oil correlates with lacquer ratings. The authors also report on an infrared spectrometric method they devel- oped for quantifying soot in piston deposits, crankcase oil insolubles, or directly in the oil, where it can be quickly and easily monitored.

Rozalsky, Shell Development Co., Westhollow Research Center, Houston, TX. This paper discusses the influence of oil drain interval on connecting rod bearings in linehaul diesel truck engines. Limiting factors, such as alkalinity depletion, viscosity increase and contamination, are considered for 2-cycle and 4-cycle diesel engines. The feasibility of extended oil drain service in terms of used oil alkalinity limits is evaluated from results of laboratory and field tests. The effects of oil drain interval on bearing distress, e.g., overlay removal and lining corrosion, are also discussed. In order to maximize bearing life, fleet operators should follow (1) good engine maintenance procedures and (2) the engine manufacturers' recommended oil change intervals. 801370. Heavy-Duty Gasoline Engine Emission Sensi- tivity to Variations in the 1984 Federal Test Cycle. Timothy P. Cox, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. An attempt at quantification of emission sensitivity of heavy-duty gasoline engines to variations in the 1984 Federal Certification transient test cycle was made. A brief overview of the Federal Test Procedure is presented, followed by emission test results from several dynamom- eter controller miscalibration modes. In general, the results indicated that certain modes of controller cali- bration can produce significant emission variations well within the limits of the 1984 FTP validation criteria. The data indicated that some validation criteria require tightening or respecification to assure repeatable test results. 1980 SA E Transactions 801371. Emissions from Trucks by Chassis Version of 1983 Transient Procedure. Harry E. Dietzmann and Mary Ann Parness, Southwest Research Institute; and Ronald L. Bradow, U.S. Envi- ronmental Protection Agency. Regulated gaseous, particulate and several unregulated emissions are reported from four heavy-duty diesel engines operated on the chassis version of the 1983 transient procedure. Emissions were obtained from Cat- erpillar 3208, Mack ENDT 676, Cummins Formula 290 and Detroit Diesel 8V-71 engines with several diesel fuels. A large dilution tunnel (57' X 46" ID) was fabricated to allow total exhaust dilution, rather than the double dilution employed in the stationary engine version of the transient procedure. A modal particulate sampler was developed to obtain particulate data from the individual segments of the 1983 transient procedure. The exhaust gas was analyzed for benzo(a)pyrene, metals, N20, N02, individual hydrocarbons and HCN. Sequential extractions were performed and measured versus calculated fuel consumptions were obtained. 1980 SA E Transactions 801372. Characterization of Particulate Emissions from In-Use Diesel Vehicles. Richard E. Gibbs, James D. Hyde and Stanley M. Byer, Division of Air, New York State Department of Environ- mental Conservation, 50 Wolf Road, Albany, N.Y. Particulate emissions data are presented from a group of 19 in-use diesel automobiles. Five driving cycles and three fuel/lubricating oil combinations have been used to 166</page><page sequence="148">801373-801379 obtain particulate emissions data and also to collect particulate samples for chemical and bioassay charac- terization studies. Particulate samples are solvent extrac- ted with dichloromethane to obtain the soluble organic fraction (SOF) of the emitted particulate. Particulate and SOF data are presented for emission/distance, emis- sion/time and emission/fuel consumed basis by vehicle manufacture, driving cycle, and fuel/oil subcategory. Some SOF samples have been used in the bioassay test of Ames, and these results are presented for different vehicles and driving cycles. Particulate emissions, SOF emissions and bioassay activity results are presented in terms of mileage accumulation effects. 1980 SA E Transactions 801373. Correlation Studies of an In-Line, Full-Flow Opacimeter. Gary L. Green, Cummins Engine Co., Inc.; and Don Wallace, Berkeley Industries. In-line, full-flow diesel smoke opacity meters have been developed to avoid the many installation and operational problems of using the EPA required end-of-line (open stack) PHS smokemeter. Extensive correlation tests were run to establish relationships between the in-line and PHS meters. These correlation studies included determining the effect of emitted light wave length on particle absorption, effective optical path length measurements and corre- lation studies with other (Bosch and Hartridge) meters. 1980 SA E Transactions 801374. Nitrosamine Emissions from Diesel Engine Crankcases. E. Ulku Goff, James R. Coombs and David H. Fine, New England Institute for Life Sciences, Waltham, MA; and Thomas M. Baines, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Ann Arbor, MI. Crankcase emissions from four different Diesel engines, using four different types of lubricating oils, were analyzed for volatile nitrosamines. The results showed large differences in nitrosamine output between different crankcase oils tested in the same engine. Composite emission rates of NDMA from the heavy duty diesel engines tested ranged from 4.4 to 136 /xg/hr. Large differences were also observed when the same brand of oil was used in different engines. The controlling factors appear to be the nitrosamine producing capacity of the oils, the NOx levels in the crankcase, and the emission flow rate from the crankcase. 801375. Nitrosamine Emissions from Diesels. R. J. Slone, R. W. Scheffel and S. M. Shahed, Cummins Engine Co., Inc., Columbus, IN; and B. Peter- sen, Battelle Columbus Labs, Columbus, OH. Diesel engine exhaust and blowby gases were sampled and analyzed for nitrosamines. Tenax-GC traps were used as collection media. Three different engines were sampled. Tenax-GC material used contained significant quantities of dimethyl nitrosamine as impurities. A cleaning pro- cedure was developed to precondition the traps. No nitrosamines were detected in either exhaust or blowby down to levels of 90 pptr and 10 pptr respectively. 801376. (SP-471) Effects of Flow Improver Additives on Distillate Fuels from Oil Shale. John W. Frank- enfeld and William F. Taylor, Exxon Research and Engineering Co. The ability of additives to improve the cold flow properties of shale oil distillates boiling in the diesel fuel range was evaluated using hydrotreated shale oils as model fuels. Crude oil shale from Occidental Oil Shale Company was fractionated to give three liquids in the diesel fuel boiling range. Each fraction was hydrotreated to three different severities to afford 9 different model fuels. A variety of commercial and experimental additives were evaluated as cold flow improvers in these fuels as treat levels of 0.04-0.4 wt.%. Both the standard pour point test (ASTM D97) and a more severe low temperature flow test were employed. Reductions in pour points of from 0-70° F and improvements in a low temperature flow test from 0-1 6° F were achieved. It is concluded that flow improver additives can play an important role in im- proving the cold flow properties of future synthetic fuels of the diesel type derived from oil shale. 801378. (SP-471) Alcohols as Extenders and Supplanters of Petroleum in the Transportation Sector. R. Pefley, J. Nebolon and H. Adelman, Univ. of Santa Clara. In the last twelve years there has been an expanding study throughout the world which has reestablished alcohols as fuels and as prime candidates for extending and sup- plementing petroleum fuels in the ground transportation sector. This paper presents a summary of the evidence to date relative to performance and environmental factors as they relate to alcohol fuel use in internal combustion engines. 801379. (SP-471) Methanol Fumigation of a Light Duty Automotive Diesel Engine. K. R. Houser, S. S. Lestz, M. Dukovich and R. E. Yasbin, The Pennsylvania State Univ. An Oldsmobile 5.7 / V-8 Diesel engine was fumigated with methanol in amounts up to 40% of the fuel energy. The primary objectives of this study were to determine the effect of methanol fumigation on fuel efficiency, smoke, nitric oxide emission, and the occurrence of severe knock. An assessment of the biological activity for samples of the raw exhaust particulate and its soluble organic extract was also made using both the Ames Salmonella typhimurium test and the Bacillus subtilis Comptest. Results are presented for a test matrix consisting of twelve steady state operating conditions chosen to reflect over-the-road operation of a Diesel engine powered automobile. Generally methanol fumigation was found to decrease NO emission for all conditions, to have a slight 167</page><page sequence="149">801380-801384 effect on smoke opacity, and to have a beneficial effect on fuel efficiency at higher loads. Also at higher loads the methanol was found to induce what was defined as "knock limited" operation. While the biological activity of the raw particulate was generally found to be lower than that of the soluble organic fraction, the fumigation of methanol appears to enhance this activity in both cases. 801380. (SP-471) The Use of Hybrid Fuel in a Single- Cylinder Diesel Engine. T. W. Ryan, III, W. E. Likos and C. A. Moses, Mobile Energy Div., Southwest Research Institute. Hybrids are fuels derived from combinations of different energy sources and which are generally formulated as solutions, emulsions, or slurries. The underlying objective of this program is to reduce the use of petroleum-derived fuels and/or to minimize the processing requirements of the finished hybrid fuels. Several hybrid fuel formulations have been developed and tested in a direct injection single-cylinder diesel engine. The formulations included solutions of ethanol and vegetable oils in diesel fuel, emulsions of methanol and of ethanol in diesel fuel; and slurries of starch, cellulose, and "carbon" in diesel fuel. Based on the progress to date, the solutions and emulsions appear to be viable diesel engine fuels if the economic factors are favorable and the storage and handling problems are not too severe. The slurries, on the other hand, are not to the same point of development as the solutions and emulsions. Although other solids do represent energy sources, the "carbons" appear to have the most potential for development into finished fuel slurries for current diesel engine designs. 1980 SA E Transactions 801381. An Assessment of Used Engine Oil Recycling. David M. Stehouwer, General Motors Research Laboratories. The environmental, energy, and economic factors causing increased interest in recycling used engine oil are reviewed. Current used oil disposal practices and the choices of recycling used oil as a fuel supplement or a re-refined lubricant are discussed. Use as a fuel supplement for stationary combustion units has raised concern over lead emissions. However, reduced use of lead in gasoline in combination with current stack gas emission control systems should elim- inate this concern. Although it is technically feasible to produce a high quality engine oil from re-refined base stocks, the acceptance of re-refined engine oils will depend upon the re-refiners ability to insure quality from batch-to-batch. A small energy savings, equivalent to about 1 .4 billion liters (9.0 million barrels) of crude per year, is possible if the used engine oil now used for road oiling or dumped is recycled by available methods. 1980 SA E Transactions 801382. Status Report on the Characterization of Re- Refined Lubricating Base Oils. Stephen M. Hsu and Donald A. Becker, Recycled Oil Program, National Bureau of Standards. The National Bureau of Standards (NBS) has been working on the development of test procedures for recycled petroleum oils since 1976. The first phase involved development and evaluation of tests for char- acterizing used oil recycled as burner fuel, and has been completed. The second phase, on re-refined motor oil, involves development of a set of test procedures capable of monitoring the quality, consistency, and additive response of re-refined lubricating oil basestocks. Tests under investigation include physical property tests, chemical property tests, hydrocarbon type char- acterization methods, and bench scale performance tests primarily directed toward the measurement of additive response. Cooperative efforts include the ASTM/NBS Basestock Consistency Study (involving both re-refined and virgin lubricating oil basestocks), a study of engine deposits with the U.S. Army Fuel and Lubricants Research Laboratory, and micro-oxidation test research at Pennsylvania State University. This paper describes the current status of this program, and includes representative data obtained on re-refined oils. 801383. Characterization of Lubricating Oils by Differ- ential Scanning Calorimetry. James A. Walker and Wing Tsang, Chemical Kinetics Div., Na- tional Bureau of Standards. The oxidative stability of formulated lubricating oils, and virgin and re-refined lubricating base stocks, have been determined by high pressure differential scanning calori- metry. At pressures of 0.7 - 3.4 MPa (100-500 psig) air or 02 and temperatures near 200°C, degradation occurs with an appreciable generation of heat. Experiments have been conducted in both temperature programmed and isother- mal modes. These data have been compared with multicylinder engine sequence test (III-C) results. Sensi- tivity to effects caused by a NOX environment, traces of olefinic materials added in the oil and the nature of metal surfaces have been demonstrated. Data on the response of re-refined and virgin base stocks to fixed quantities of an additive have been obtained. They are indicative of the wide diversity of the substances in question. The results of these studies indicate that the induction period meas- urements yield important information on the response of base stocks to additive treatment which could be used in quality control for formulating lubricating oils. Further studies are, however, needed to obtain more definite conclusions. 1980 SA E Transactions 801384. Phillips Re-refined Oil Process (PROP)- Qual- ity and Performance. R. E. Linnard and G. S.

Rabe, EIC Corp.; and Jose L. Bascunana, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The current EPA procedure for determining Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) is based on a repre- sentative approach rather than on a statistical sampling approach. Thus, CAFE is interpreted as a defined quantity which is determined according to the guidelines listed in the EPA procedure. Furthermore, the procedure does not attempt to determine the actual corporate average fuel economy to a known degree of accuracy. The paper investigates what results would be obtained if corporate average fuel economy were determined statistically. Using basic findings on fuel consumption variability, the paper projects the accuracy and costs of alternative statistical sampling and estimation procedures. Approximate calculations for preliminary 1978 data show that the confidence interval widths of corporate average fuel economies range from 0.3 to several miles per gallon. To achieve a confidence interval of 0.1 mpg would require a procedure substantially more expensive than the current EPA procedure. 801387. 1985 Light-Duty Truck Fuel Economy. K. G. Duleep, D. P. Kuhn and R. W. Crawford, Energy and Environmental Analysis, Inc., Ar- lington, Virginia. This paper addresses fuel economy standards that can be obtained in 1985 for two-wheel drive LDT's using existing technology. To estimate the fuel economy, the fleet of LDT's is first segmented into market classes based on the concept of utility. The 1985 sales share of each class is predicted from an extrapolation of current trends as well as published sales forecasts. In 1985 fuel economy of each market class is projected using 1) MY '80 truck technology and fuel economy as a baseline, 2) a regression equation that allows an estimate of fuel economy based on the weight, drag, and engine displacement, and 3) the addition of fuel-efficient technologies. Estimates of weight reduc- tion and new model introduction within each market class were derived from published manufacturers' plans. Based on this methodology, this analysis concludes that a fleet fuel economy in excess of 24/25 mpg is feasible for 1985 without/with the use of diesel engines. 801389. Limitations in Capillary Viscometry. J. K. Appel- doorn and D. I. Devore, Exxon Research and Engrg. Co. A computer program has been used to calculate the effect of high shear stresses on viscosity measurement in capillaries. Viscous heating can occur long before the limiting Reynolds number is reached, and when it does, it will introduce serious errors in the viscosity calculation. The flow profile is flattened, causing an error to appear in the kinetic energy correction. The shear stress and shear rate at the wall are no longer constant, the shear stress decreasing and the shear rate increasing as the liquid flows down the capillary. As a result, the calculation of even an apparent viscosity gives a value that has questionable meaning. Heating effects can be reduced by using a shorter L/R ratio and a smaller radius. 1980 SA E Transactions 801390. Temporary Viscosity Loss in Shear Stability Testing. D. L. Alexander and S. W. Rein, Texaco Inc., Beacon, NY. The relationships between the permanent and temporary viscosity losses were examined for 43 oils at 100°C and 150°C. High-shear-rate viscosities were measured at a shear rate of 106 s_1 in a capillary viscometer for new oils and used oils. New oils that had been subjected to 20 cycles in the Fuel Injector Shear Stability Test were considered to be used oils in this program. There was no useful relationship between the temporary viscosity loss (difference between kinematic and high-shear-rate viscosi- ties of new oil) and the permanent viscosity loss (dif- ference between kinematic viscosities of new oil and of used oil). Also, there was no useful relationship between either the temporary or permanent losses alone and the combined loss (difference between kinematic viscosity of new oil and high-shear-rate viscosity of used oil.) There was, however, a relationship between the temporary loss and the permanent loss, used together, and the combined loss. This relationship makes it possible to estimate the combined viscosity loss without having to measure the high-shear-rate viscosity of the used oil. Discussion: T. W. Selby, Savant, Inc. 1980 SA E Transactions 801393. Discussions and Author Closures from the Sym- posium Entitled, "The Relationship Between Engine Oil Viscosity and Engine Performance - Part VI" (SAE SP-460) (ASTM STP 621-S4). Michael L. McMillan, General Motors Research Laboratories. A symposium entitled: "The Relationship Between En- gine Oil Viscosity and Engine Performance - Part VI" was held in Detroit, Michigan as part of the February 1980 SAE Congress and Exposition. Four of the papers presented at the symposium were bound in a booklet, SAE SP-460 and ASTM STP 621-S4. The discussions and 169</page><page sequence="151">801394-801403 author closures for these four papers as well as those for a paper presented in an earlier symposium are included in this paper and provide a supplement to the volume of bound papers. 801394. High Shear Rate Viscosity of Engine Oils. W. D. Hewson and L. R. Carey, Imperial Oil Ltd. (Canada). This paper describes the development and use of a pressure capillary viscometer for operating at the tem- peratures and high shear rates typically experienced in operating engines. It has been used to make viscosity measurements on engine oils without significant problems at temperatures ranging from 20 to 150°C and shear rates up to 2 X 10V1. Experimental results with Newtonian fluids have been found to agree extremely well with the mathematical predictions of Newtonian behaviour and the Poiseuille-Hagen equation for capillary flow. High shear rate viscosity measurements have been made for several oils currently of interest to the ASTM task force on high temperature rheology. These include four GM reference oils, nine CEC reference oils, and two Imperial Oil Ltd. Diesel reference oils. These viscometric meas- urements are discussed in relation to the available engine wear data. The extent of permanent shear on temporary shear stability was also studied for several oils. Permanent viscosity loss resulted in a gain in temporary shear stability. This gain in temporary shear stability partially offsets the permanent viscosity loss during high shear rate lubrication. 801400. Variability of Strain-Controlled Fatigue Proper- ties of USS Dual Phase 80 Steel. J. M. Holt and B. K. Stewart, U.S. Steel Corp., Monroeville, PA. Because sheet-steel users are requesting strain-controlled fatigue properties of sheet steels for automotive use, a program is being conducted to characterize single grades of steel and to examine the variability of their fatigue properties. As part of that program, monotonie tension tests and low-cycle strain-controlled fatigue tests were performed on smooth longitudinal and transverse spec- imens from sheets of USS Dual Phase 80 steel. An 0.096-inch (2.4 mm) thick sheet from one heat and 0.131 inch (3.3 mm) and 0.188-inch (4.8 mm) thick sheets from a second heat were evaluated. The sheets were tested in the "as-shipped" (unstrained) and prestrained conditions. Prestraining was accomplished with a single uniaxial tension load sufficient to cause strains as high as 8 percent prior to fatigue testing. The results of this study showed that the unstrained material was cyclically stable; that is, the cyclic yield strength was approximately the same as the monotonie yield strength. However the prestrained material cyclically softened so that the cyclic yield strength was considerably less than the monotonie prestrained value and approached or was lower than the cyclic yield strength of the unstrained material. In this study the strain-controlled fatigue properties of Dual Phase 80 steel did not vary more among sheets from different coils and subjected to different amounts of prior uniaxial tensile prestrains than within a single sheet. Therefore this study gives little evidence that sampling from more than a single sheet is necessary to estimate the fatigue properties of this grade of steel. This finding is consistent with previous results for high-strength low-alloy sheet steels. 1980 SA E Transactions 801401. Aerodynamic Study on Vehicle Shape with the "Panel Method": An Effort to Calculate the Influence of Shape Characteristics on Aerody- namic Performance. C. Berta, T. Tacca and A. Zucchelli, Fiat Research Center S.p.A. (Orbas- sano, Italy). The "Panel method" is used as a means for preventive aerodynamic examination and evaluation of the shape of a vehicle. Also, with inviscid flow some useful consid- erations may be extrapolated; for instance, the influence of shape changes in the forebody may be evaluated. Obviously, for a complete analysis, viscous corrections may be introduced. 801402. Experimental Shape Research of Ideal Aerody- namic Characteristics for Industrial Vehicles. C. Berta and B. Bonis, FIAT Research Center S.p.A. (Orbassano, Italy). This paper illustrates an experimental aerodynamic research study of industrial vehicles. Tractor- trailer, truck and bus shapes are considered; in each of them the research is pursued with the aid of a representative one-half-scale model in the wind tunnel in three phases: • local shape modifications and add-on devices study; • definition of alternative shapes; • definition and optimization of ideal shapes. Reductions of ~45% for tractor-trailers, 30% for trucks, and 27% for buses are obtained. This means fuel reductions of ~9% (tractor-trailer) and 10.5% (truck). 801403. The Effect of Tractor-Trailer Flow Interaction on the Drag and Distribution of Drag of Tractor- Trailer Trucks. Colin H. Marks and Frank T. Buckley, Jr., Dept. of Mechanical Engrg., Univ. of Maryland. A wind-tunnel study was carried out to determine the influence of some tractor and trailer geometries on the distribution of aerodynamic drag of tractor-trailer trucks. Also investigated were the effects on the drag distribution of drag-reducing devices and of exhaust stacks. The measurements were made on l/8th-scale models at a Reynolds number of 106. The shape of the tractor strongly influenced the drag on the trailer. Streamlining the tractor could increase the drag on the trailer to the point that the drag on the 170</page><page sequence="152">801404-801420 tractor-trailer combination increased. A relatively streamlined conventional tractor was responsible for between 45% and 57% of the total aerodynamic drag at 0° yaw, whereas a relatively unstreamlined cab-over-engine tractor was responsible for between 73% and 82% of the zero-yaw drag. A streamlined fairing mounted on the tractor in- creased the drag on the tractor, but decreased the drag on the trailer substantially more than the drag on the tractor increased. Exhaust stacks were found to significantly reduce the drag on a tractor-trailer combination. 1980 SA E Transactions 801404. Aerodynamic Drag Reduction of Intercity Buses. Alan T. McDonald and George M. Palmer, Purdue Univ. An experimental program was conducted to verify the reduction in fuel consumption achievable with aerody- namic improvements to intercity buses. Wind tunnel model tests were used to develop effective aerodynamic improvements and full-scale road tests to validate the results. Greyhound Lines coach models MC-7 and MC-8 were tested with head- and crosswinds. Aerodynamic drag of the MC-7 was reduced 17 percent at zero yaw. Drag of the MC-8 initially was higher; it was reduced 27 percent at zero yaw by the best fairing. Both low-drag configurations were less sensitive to crosswinds than the original models; significant drag reduction was maintained to 15 degrees yaw angle. Fuel consumption measurements made with aerodynamic fairings installed on an MC-7 showed that the low-drag bus used 1 1.7 percent less fuel at a steady 55 mph. The cost of the full-scale modifications was estimated at $1,500 each for a retrofit kit and no added cost to produce on new vehicles. Return on investment for the aerodynamic improvement exceeds 100 percent an- nually for today's fuel costs. 1980 SA E Transactions 801405. Aerodynamic Evaluations of the 1980 F-Series Light and Medium Trucks and the 1978 CL-9000 Heavy Truck. Louis T. Duncan, Ford Motor Co. For 75 years the automobile industry has primarily responded to consumer demands regarding vehicle design, performance, fuel economy, cost, comfort, safety and option availability. Consumers are now demonstrating a preference in the market place for fuel efficient vehicles in all market segments from subcompacts to luxury cars, pick-ups, vans, medium and heavy duty trucks. Gov- ernment mandated fuel economy requirements for au- tomobiles and light duty trucks are also adding impetus to the industry's initiative to improve fuel economy. At Ford Motor Company aerodynamic drag reduction is an active partner in improving fuel economy and aerodynamic features are integrated into the design of every new Ford car and truck. This report presents the aerodynamic features of the new generation of Ford trucks: the 1978 CL-9000 heavy truck and the 1980 F 150 light and the F-600 medium trucks. The wind tunnel test methods and models are also summarized. 801418. (SP-475) An Assessment of Ride Quality of Heavy-Duty Trucks. M. M. ElMadany, Wyle Laboratories; and M. A. Dokainish, McMaster Univ. In this paper the linear dynamic response of the articu- lated vehicles to the road surface undulations which are represented as stationary Gaussian random excitations, is investigated. The power spectral density approach is used to estimate the influence of various parameters on the ride quality of such vehicles. In particular, the influence of load patterns, road characteristics, speed, and vehicle suspension systems on the ride quality is evaluated. 1980 SA E Transactions 801419. (SP-475) Optimum Design of Tractor- Semitrailer Suspension Systems. M. M. ElMa- dany, Wyle Laboratories; and M. A. Dokainish, McMaster Univ. The optimum steady-state response of a tractor-semitrailer vehicle traveling over an uneven road is considered. A mathematical programming technique of the design of a tractor-semitrailer suspension system is formulated. The mathematical model is excited at more than one point by harmonic forces. The objective of the optimization problem is to find the optimum suspension parameters that provide suffi- cient vibration isolation from road disturbances so that desired level of driver comfort can be achieved, in a given frequency interval. The design criterion for measuring the desired level of ride quality is the maximum acceleration at the cab. The design is subjected to a constraint upon maximum fore and aft acceleration caused by the articulation. It is also constrained by requiring maximum values for the static deflections of the suspensions. The mathematical techniques and the corresponding numerical solution of the governing differential equations are presented and an optimization algorithm is chosen to select the optimum design. 1980 SAE Transactions 801420. (SP-475) Articulated Vehicle Models. A. B. Allan, Univ. of Toronto; M. M. ElMadany, Wyle Laboratories; and M. A. Dokainish, McMaster Univ. The results obtained from three mathematical models, of varying degrees of complexity, describing the motion of a tractor-semitrailer unit are presented. These results, given in the form of curves, indicate the steady state response of the vehicle to a sinusoidal input profile at the tire contact points for a range of input frequencies. A comparison of the results of the different models 171</page><page sequence="153">801421-801426 indicates that in certain circumstances a relatively simple model may provide adequate information for particular design purposes. The simplification of the model reduces the computer time required, and the cost, and possibly will allow the analysis to be carried out on a computer with a limited capacity. 801421. (SP-475) Articulated Vehicle Dynamic Analyses Using Equivalent Linearization Technique. M. M. ElMadany, Wyle Laboratories; and M. A. Dokainish, McMaster Univ. This paper presents the equivalent linearization technique as an engineering design tool used in assessing the ride quality of the articulated vehicle. This technique is employed with the objective of describing qualitatively and quantitatively the ride behavior of such vehicle, and evaluating the effect of system nonlinearities on the ride characteristics. 1980 SA E Transactions 801422. An Approach to Developing Underride Guard Requirements for Improved Occupant Protection. J. E. Tomassoni and G. K. Bell, National Highway Traffic Safety Admin. Initial efforts for developing regulations for improved rear underride protection focused on very high strength (rigid) structures with low ground clearance. To determine optimal performance characteristics for guard structures, a comparative engineering analysis was performed using a car crash simulation model with a variety of guard force-deformation characteristics. From this analysis the risk of injury to occupants of passenger cars was determined based on excessive underride (decapitation potential), and collision forces imparted to the occupant. Variables in the analysis included collision speed, car size, occupant free travel distance, and the rear wheel position of the heavy vehicle, as well as the various force- deformation characteristics representing the different types of underride guard systems. 1980 SA E Transactions 801423. A Development of Truck Rear End Underride Protection. Gunter Persicke and P. F. Baker, Quinton Hazell, Ltd. Accidents on our roads do happen; although every effort is made to lessen the number, it is still vitally important to try to find better ways of reducing their effect. One such way is the energy absorbing "Underrider" recently developed by Quinton Hazell Ltd. The paper will discuss in some detail how this development can help to improve the present situation. The system is capable of effective injury reduction in underriding impacts to cars of most sizes while eliminating or minimising the damage suffered by the truck. It will be shown that the design of the unit does not affect the ability of a truck to negotiate steep angles but reduces the effect of impact with road furniture, kerbs, ramps, etc. to negligible proportions. 801424. A Parametric Study of Candidate Underride Guard Design Approaches. G. P. McCafferty, The Budd Co., Technical Center. A parametric design analysis was performed in order to define the characteristics of protection devices which could be incorporated on the rear end of highway trailers in order to avoid automobile vehicle underride in a crash situation. Of particular concern in this study was the effect of weight and cost of the devices as they relate to parameters such as load capacity, guard height, restriction of the rear sliding bogie movement, and energy attenu- ation. Four separate design concepts were studied and compared on the basis of weight, cost, and slider restriction. Included were rigid as well as energy absorb- ing design approaches. Results have generally indicated that the energy absorbing guard approach has the best potential from a weight efficiency standpoint. The study also points out that significant modifications will be required to the trailer structure to absorb the impact loads under consideration. 801425. One-Piece Stamped I-Beam Axle. David G. Loosle and Peter F. Leon, Ford Motor Com- pany; and C. Robert Danielson, Bendix Corp. Recent accomplishments, made possible by advances in manufacturing and material technology, have led to the development of a one-piece stamped I-Beam axle with ball joints as a replacement to the forged axle with king pin design. The new stamped I-Beam axle brings with it a number of improvements to Ford's Twin I-Beam suspension system. This paper describes the objectives, improvements, evolution of the design, testing, and the manufacturing process for this latest suspension system improvement on Ford light trucks. 1980 SA E Transactions 801426. Axle Weight Reduction with Improved Durability via Finite Element Analysis. Gary L. Davis, Spicer Axle Div., Dana Corp. This paper describes the formulation of both "solid" and "thin-shell" isoparametric finite element models of an existing production light truck unitized cast iron gear carrier and its subsequent replacement. The emphasis of this study lies in the objective of deriving a method of using a thin-shell model for quick and cost effective design analysis purposes in lieu of complex and costly solid models. The analyses are studied in terms of redesigning the gear carrier to better optimize material usage, while simultaneously increasing the structural beaming fatigue life. The redesign is formulated by iterative thin-shell models with the final design verified by a solid model. A 172</page><page sequence="154">801427-801440 thin-shell model of the attaching stamped steel cover plate is also included as a separate study. 1980 SA E Transactions 801427. One-Piece SMC Hood. Donald J. Ray, Plastics, Paint and Vinyl Division, Ford Motor Com- pany. The design, development, manufacturing and assembly experiences in the evolution of lightweight, one-piece, SMC hood for the Econoline Van are described by the author. The one-piece, ribbed design resulted in a weight and cost savings versus the two-piece, stamped steel hood construction. A product requirement that the surface finish of the SMC panel be equal in quality to that of the steel, resulted in a major effort to improve the state- of-the-art of Class "A" SMC finish. The author also discusses how the demanding product performance requirements were met through refinements of design, material and through manufacturing process controls. 801428. Why Not a New Engine? Charles A. Amann, General Motors Research Laboratories, Warren, MI. Leading contenders in the search for a superior alternative powerplant for light-duty automotive use include the steam and Stirling engines, the gas turbine, and the diesel. In this paper the status of each of those alternative engines is reviewed and its prognosis considered. The steam engine is unsuitable because of poor fuel economy. Obstacles blocking acceptance of the Stirling and gas turbine engines are sufficient so that even if they are surmountable, significant use in light-duty vehicles is unlikely before the 1990s. The light-duty diesel is here today but faces some difficult regulatory hurdles in the near future. 1980 SA E Transactions 801429. United Parcel Service Applies Texaco Stratified Charge Engine Technology to Power Parcel Delivery Vans- Progress Report. J. M. Lewis, United Parcel Service; and W. T. Tierney, Texaco Inc. In April 1978, the operator of the world's largest commercial vehicle fleet, United Parcel Service, entered into a development contract with Texaco Inc., assisted by Ricardo Consulting Engineers as sub-contractor, to apply Texaco's TCCS (Texaco Controlled-Combustion System) technology to power parcel delivery vans. This paper presents a summary of the project devel- opment, with major elements of the program discussed in separate sections of the paper. 1980 SA E Transactions 801431. Light Vehicle Noise - Origins, Characteristics, and Standard Test Procedures. P. E. Waters, Vehicle Standards and Engrg. Div., Dept. of Transport (United Kingdom). New test procedures for the control of light vehicle noise have been under discussion recently in Europe and America as there is some dissatisfaction with the estab- lished procedures. This paper sets out the origins and characteristics of light vehicle noise and reviews the data available on light vehicle operation. It is then shown how the two opposing philosophies of a maximum noise test and of a test representing average operating conditions develop from this background. An appendix gives details of many test procedures that have been used or proposed for light vehicle noise since the original German and proposed United Kingdom legislation of 1935. Six of these procedures have been chosen for detailed evaluation, three maximum noise and three representative driving tests. Data from these tests are used to illustrate the practical as opposed to the theo- retical effects of the two philosophies. The paper reports the United Kingdom Government's policy on this subject and concludes that there are practical noise control disadvantages in a change to a test more representative of typical driving. 1980 SA E Transactions 801432. Evaluation of Passenger Car Noise Nuisance in Urban Traffic. P. Fontanet, Regie Nationale des Usines Renault (France). The present paper reports the urban driving statistical survey achieved by CCMC on a twenty three passenger car sample, driven in four European towns. Statistics of engine speed as well as statistics of power utilized have been worked out and related to mechanical characteristics of the vehicles. From these preliminary works, CCMC has derived the engine speeds and loads which define, at best, the noisiness of the different passenger cars. These engine speeds and loads should be used during certification tests in order to get a better evaluation of their noise nuisance. These works have been used as a basis for the drafting of various practical procedures. One of them has been elaborated in the 8th working group of SCI TC 43 of ISO and is now proposed as an international standard. 801433. Motor Vehicle Noise Test Procedures in Austra- lia - A Critical Review. R. Law, Noise Control Branch, Environment Protection Authority (Australia). A review is presented of the motor vehicle noise test procedures currently used in Australia by regulatory authorities for both new and in-use vehicles. Problems associated with the test procedures are discussed and criteria for assessing the suitability of new test procedures are suggested. 801440. (SP-477) Control of the Homogeneous-Charge Passenger-Car Engine - Defining the Problem. Charles A. Amann, Research Laboratories, 173</page><page sequence="155">801440-801442 General Motors Corporation, Warren, Michi- gan. The evolution of increasingly stringent standards for passenger-car exhaust emissions has increased the need for more sophisticated engine controls. In the era prior to emissions control, the dependent variables were fuel economy, driveability, and convenience and cost to the customer. The principal independent variables were spark advance and air-fuel ratio. With the tailpipe emissions of unburned hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and oxides of nitrogen now added to the list of dependent variables, a number of additional concepts have been introduced on production automobiles. Among these are exhaust-gas recirculation (EGR), the oxidizing catalytic converter, and the three-way catalytic converter. These developments, in combination with tighter emission standards and new fuel-economy mandates, have complicated the engine control problem. This presentation focuses on the definition of that problem. The effects of spark advance, air-fuel ratio, and EGR on emissions and fuel economy are reviewed. The needs for considering system deterioration, combustion knock, driveability, the cold start, dynamic effects, and control-system anomalies are delineated. The presentation thus provides an understanding of the challenges pre- sented to the controls engineer by the modern homo- geneous-charge passenger-car engine. 801442. (SP-477) Microprocessor Design Considerations. Dieter P. Forberger, Engine Electronic Controls Subsystems &amp; Applications Engineering, Ford Motor Company, Dearborn, Michigan. Practically speaking, almost anything can be a design consideration, from the computer silicon to the vehicle axle ratio. Some technical juP design considerations have been addressed in Jack Morgan's paper. The other papers in this lecture series cover the Ford and GM /xP systems in detail. To avoid duplication, this paper is targeted on more general lines: . Which design considerations are most important to achieve a successful product? . How will these considerations affect the design implementation? 174</page></plain_text>
