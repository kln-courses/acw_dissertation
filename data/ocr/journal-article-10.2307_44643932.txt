Hayduk NASA Langley Research Center Hampton, VA SUBSTANTIAL RESEARCH HAS BEEN PERFORMED in recent years in the area of crash dynamics of general aviation airplane structures and seat/occupant-restraint systems (1)*. These efforts have been concerned primarily with determining the crash loads, identifying structural failure modes during crashes, evaluating restraint system/seat performance and assessing loads imposed on anthropomorphic dummy passengers for potentially survivable crashes. As part of the research under the joint NASA/FAA Crash Dynamics Program at NASA Langley Research Center (2) , the development of structural concepts to limit the load transmitted to the occupant also has been undertaken. The objective of this research is to attenuate the load trans- mitted by a structure either by modifying structural assembly, changing geometry of its elements, or adding specific load-limiting devices to help dissipate the kinetic energy. Recent efforts in this area at Langley Research Center (LaRC) have concentrated on the development of crashworthy subfloor systems. Selected load-limiting subfloor concepts have been proposed and constructed for evalua- tion. The design support effort on these concepts is discussed in (3). This paper presents results of a com- bined experimental and analytical study of the response to crash loads of five different candidate load-limiting subfloors. Experimental data presented include static load-deflection (crush) data and dynamic responses of the sub- floor under vertical impact conditions. Correlation of the experimental data with the DYCAST computer program (4 to 6) results are made. ^Numbers in parenthesis designate References at end of paper. - ABSTRACT Results are presented of an experimental and analytical study of the dynamic response to crash loadings of five different load-limiting subfloors for general aviation aircraft. These subfloors provide a high-strength structural floor platform to retain the seats and a crush- able zone to absorb energy and limit vertical loads. Experimental static load-deflection data and dynamic deceleration response data for the five subfloors indicated that the high-strength floor platform performed well in that structural integrity and residual strength was maintained throughout the loading cycle. The data also indicated that some of the subfloor crush zones were more effective than others in providing nearly constant load for a range of displacement. The analytical data was generated by charac- terizing the nonlinear crush zones of the sub- floor with static load-deflection data and using the DYCAST nonlinear finite element com- puter program. Comparisons between experi- mental and analytical data showed good correla- tion for the subfloors in which the static deformation mode closely approximated the dynamic deformation mode. 2139 0096-736X/82/9003-21 39$02.50 Copyright 1962 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">2140 H. D. CARDEN AND R. J. HAYDUK BACKGROUND The concept of available stroke is paramount in determining the load attenuating capabilities of different design approaches. Shown in figure 1 are three load attenuating zones which exist between an occupant and the impact surface during vertical descent: the landing gear, the cabin subfloor, and the aircraft seat. Attenuation by landing gears is more applicable to helicopters and is not con- sidered here. Using the upward human acceleration tolerance of 25 głs as established in (7) , a relationship between stroke and vertical descent velocity can be established for a constant stroking device which fully strokes in less than the maximum time allowable (0.10 s) for human tolerance. This relation- ship is illustrated in figure 1. For a condition of a constant 25 g deceleration stroke the maximum velocity decrease for the stroking available is 12.2 m/s (40 fps) for the seats (assuming 30 cm (12 in) stroke) and 8.2 m/s (27 fps) for the subTloor (assuming 15 cm (6 in) stroke) . For a combination of stroking seat and stroking subfloor the maximum velocity decrease becomes 15.2 m/s (50 fps). These vertical sink rates are comparable to the Army Design Guide recommendations (7) for crashworthy seat design. The importance of providing as much stroking distance as possible is vividly illustrated in figure 2. Figure 2(a) is an overall view of a twin engine Navajo Chieftain that crashed on August 30, 1978 shortly after take off from the North Las Vegas Airport, Nevada, killing all ten people aboard. Reference (8) presents an analysis of this accident along with comparisons with NASA crash test data. An interior view of the airplane is shown in figure 2(b). As may be noted in this figure, the floor is very wavy, seat rails are broken, and floor structure is crumpled under the front legs at the seat locations. These conditions are indicative of the high loads transmitted to the seats and occupants through the rela- tively stiff floor structure. As illustrated in figure 2(c) the intersections of the longi- tudinal beams and the lateral bulkheads in the floor form "hard points" or columns which are very efficient load paths from the under belly of the airplane to the seat rails. Consequently any crushing of the floor that might occur in a crash situation probably will be at too severe a load level for the occupants to potentially survive. Thus the need exists for structural designs which allow for controlled structural collapse to absorb energy and to limit the vertical loads to human tolerance levels over as much distance as possible. SUBFLOOR DESCRIPTION A design approach for subfloor structures which could alleviate some undesirable characteristics of current designs (discussed above) is presented in this section. Additional details on the subfloors may be found in (3). &lt; Fig. 1 - Stroke potentially available in typical general aviation aircraft for energy dissipation during a crash</page><page sequence="3">SUBFLOOR RESPONSE 2141 cu * O •H e m 00 O tí U 4J tí &lt;4-4 03 tí tí ^ 00 •H ^ tí Č O &lt; U I tí * •v cd u tí na tí -u ca a &gt; •H tí tí PL.

HAYDUK Basically, the new approach would be to replace existing subfloor structure with a design that consists of two parts, an upper floor zone and a lower crushable support zone. The upper zone, common to all the subfloors, is a strong, shallow 5.08 cm (2 inches) deep platform designed to carry loads and moments imposed by the seat/occupant and to maintain seat to structure integrity. A 119.4 cm long x 106.7 cm wide (47 in x 42 in) section of this upper floor (see figure 3(a)) consists of 1.01 mm x 5.08cm x 104 cm (.04 in. x 2 in. x 42 in.) lateral aluminum (2024 T-3) channels at 27.94 cm (11 in) intervals connected by similar channels running longitudinally under the seat rail locations on the floor. A longi- tudinal strip .38 cm x 2.14 cm x 106.7 cm (.15 in x 1.0 x 42 in.) runs full length under the outside seat rail locations. A 1.016 mm x 106.7 cm x 119.38 cm (.04 x 42 x 47 in.) aluminum sheet covers the upper surface. The outer fuselage skin was 0.81 mm (.032 inch) aluminum material. Access holes (for experiment- al purposes) were located in each outside bay. The 15.2 cm (6 inch) deep lower zone or crushable floor support (see figures 3(b) through 3(f)) is designed to distribute the loads to the upper zone as uniformly as possible and to collapse in a controlled manner to absorb as much impact energy as possible at or near human tolerance levels. Aluminum alloy (2024 T-3) with standard aircraft riviting was used in the construction of the five different sections. Details of the various lower zones are discussed in the paragraphs below. CORRUGATED BEAMS - NOTCHED CORNERS - The lower zone for the subfloor designated corrugated beams - notched corners is shown in figure 3(b). In this subfloor the normally flat longitudinal beams of the floor are replaced with 0.81 mm (.032 inch) thick corrugated beams with the corrugation pitch = 5.8 cm (2 inch). The amplitude of the corru- gations is 2.28 cm (.90 inch). At the junction of the transverse bulkheads with the beams, angles with notches (cut-outs) to weaken the joints vertically are used to attach the beams and bulkheads. The notches also have 5.08 cm (2 inch) pitch but are offset 2.54 cm (1.0 inch) to be opposite the corrugation that is attached to the angle itself. Plastic deformation during collapse of the corrugations, notched corners and bulkheads absorbs impact energy. Mass of the corrugated beams - notched corners subfloor section tested was 16.10 kg (35.5 lbm) . CORRUGATED HALF - SHELL - The lower zone for the subfloor designated corrugated half-shell is shown in figure 3(c). A cylindrical shell section 0.81 mm (.032 inch) thick with a 36.83 cm (14.50 inch) diameter with corrugations running circumferentially replaces the normal longitudinal beams in the floor. Pitch of the corrugations in the longitudinal direction is 6.78 cm (2.67 inch). Bulkheads are attached to the half-shell at 27.94 cm (11 inch) intervals. Plastic deformation during collapse of the half- shell stiffened by the corrugations and the bulkheads absorbs impact energy. Mass of the corrugated half-shell section tested was 16.56 kg (36.5 lbm). NOTCHED CORNERS - The lower zone for the subfloor designated notched corners is shown in figure 3(d). In this concept, the inter- sections of the 0.81 mm (.032 inch) thick longitudinal beams and lateral bulkheads are joined by angles with notches (cut-outs) like those used in the corrugated beam-notched corners discussed above. The notching weakens the column formed by the intersections to allow collapse to occur more readily at reduced load levels compared to the unmodified floor. Mass of the notched corners subfloor section tested was 16.56 kg (36.5 lbm). This section could represent a "minimum modification" to existing construction techniques for floor structure. For example, the addition of an angle near the top of the longitudinal beam (forming a channel with existing flanges) could form a stronger upper structure out of the original floor and be similar to the shallow 5.08 cm (2 inch) platform of the energy absorbing subfloors. The use of notched corners (angles) for attaching the bulkheads with larger flange radius would complete the modification to the load-limiting subfloor lower zone. FOAM-FILLED CYLINDERS - The lower zone for the subfloor designated foam-filled cylinders is shown in figure 3(e). In this section, the longitudinal beams of the floor are replaced by the foam-filled cylinders to provide the floor supports and to provide part of the longitudinal bending stiffness of the section. The cylinders are 0.508 mm (0.20 inch) aluminum material formed into a 15.24 cm (6 inch) diameter longitudinal tube. A 0.024 g/cm^ (1.5 lbm/ft^) density foam (rigid klegecell foam) formed into cylinders was bonded in the tubes. The lateral bulkheads with proper radius to match the outside of the cylinders were attached at the normal 27.94 cm (11 inch) spacing in the longitudinal direction. Mass of the foam-filled cylinders subfloor section tested was 17.7 kg (39.0 lbm). CANTED BULKHEADS - The lower zone for the subfloor designated canted bulkheads is shown in figure 3(f). The technique in this concept was to cant the lateral bulkheads 30° back from vertical to alleviate the purely vertical connections with the longitudinal beams. This technique could help reduce the tendency for gouging of the impact surface during longitudinal sliding. Both the longitudinal beams and lateral bulkheads are 0.81 mm (.032 inch) aluminum material. This approach could also be used with minimum modifications</page><page sequence="5">SUBFLOOR RESPONSE 2143 Fig. 3 - Load-limiting aircraft subfloors (a) Structural floor (b) Corrugated beams - notched corners (c) Corrugated half-shell (d) Notched corners (e) Foam-filled cylinders (f) Canted bulkheads</page><page sequence="6">2144 H* D.

Mass of the canted bulkhead subfloor section tested was 16.56 kg (36.5 lbm) ģ INSTRUMENTATION AND TEST PROCEDURE STATIC TESTS - A typical experimental set-up for the static testing of the five subfloors is shown in figure 4. A subfloor is shown in figure 4(a) with two loading platforms attached to the rails at seat leg spacing of approximately 40.6 cm (16 inches) to transfer loads to the test section. Conical rollers on the top of the loading platform allowed the platform to tilt or roll during the crushing process. The machine head and platten of the 4.5 MN (1.2 million-pound force) loading machine used to obtain load-deflection (crush) and strain guage data on the subfloors are also shown in figure 4(a). Loading rate for each test was 0.64 cm/minute inch/ minute) . Strain guage rosettes were mounted at various locations in the test sections to measure strain distribution beneath the subfloors (see figure 4(b)). The various rosettes were connected to junction boxes (figure 4 (a)) that were in turn connected to a Beckman data acquisition system for recording at a sampling rate of 1 sample/second. Lateral separation of the platforms and vertical crush of the subfloors were measured with deflectometers shown in figure 4(a). Sixteen millimeter cameras running at 8 pictures per second provide photographic coverage of each test.

The foam filled cylinder subfloor section shown in the figure had two loading platforms ballasted to approximately the total mass of two conventional seats and two dummies 75 kg (165 lbm) mass. Total mass of the assembly was approximately 198 kg (435 lbm). The deceleration responses of the subfloors to vertical loading at an impact velocity of 7.3 m/s (24 fps) onto a concrete surface were measured. The strain-guage type accelerometers (response flat from D. C. to 2000 Hz) were mounted on each loading platform, the upper mass c. g. locations, and the center of the subfloor. In addition to the vertical decel- erations, longitudinal and lateral responses were measured at the upper mass c. g. locations and at the center of the subfloor. Also, lateral responses were measured at the two out- side corners of each loading platform. Data signals were transmitted from the subfloor through an umbilical cable to a near-by control room were the signals were conditioned, amplified and recorded on FM-multiplex tape recorders. 600 Hz low pass filters were used with the recording system. The test procedure involved leveling the subfloor prior to raising the section by electric hoist to the desired drop height of 2.7 m (9 ft.). The tape recorders and three cameras were started. One camera provided over all coverage at 400 pictures/second and two other cameras at 1000 pictures/ second provided close-up front and side views of the subfloor impact. Finally the cargo hook was electrically activated to allow the subfloor to fall to the impact surface. Post-test photographs were then made to supplement the pre-test photographs of each subfloor. Data from the FM tape recorders were digi- tized at 4000 samples/second and converted by calibration factors to engineering units from which deceleration curves were plotted. ANALYSIS AND SUBFLOOR IDEALIZATION ANALYSIS - The finite element computer program DYCAST (Dynamic Crash Analysis of Structures) was used to analyze the dynamic nonlinear behavior of the load-limiting sub- floors under crash loading conditions for comparison with experimental data. DYCAST is substantially documented in (4) . (5) , and (6) , however, a brief description of the program will be given here. The computer program DYCAST is one module of the PLANS (Plastic and Large deflection ANalysis of Structures) system of nonlinear finite element structural analysis computer codes. These programs have been developed by Grumman Aerospace Corporation under contract to NASA Langley Research Center as part of the joint NASA/FAA program in general aviation crashworthiness. The modules for static analysis of structures are described in (6). As usual in finite element modeling, the structure is idealized into natural structural Fig. 5 - Typical experimental set-up for impact testing of load-limiting subfloors</page><page sequence="8">2146 H* D- CARDEN AND R. J. HAYDUK comDonents: stringers, frames, beams, skin sheets, and bulkhead sheets, using the element library of DYCAST. Some portion could be modeled crudely if in the judgement of the analyst detailed modeling was not necessary. The element library consists of : o Stringers - Two types of axial force members are available, constant or linearly varying between nodes, o Beams - Ten different cross sections are currently available for the 12 degrees of freedom beam element. Axial force, shear forces, and torque are uniform along the length, with a linear variation of bending moments, o Members - Triangular membrane elements are available with either constant strain or linear strain. Hybrid elements permit mixed strain condition, i.e., constant strain along the other two sides. o Springs - An axial force stringer with the spring constants specified in tabular form can be used to simulate structural selections with known axial load versus deflection behavior; to represent an energy absorbing device; or, as a gap element with zero stiffness over a certain range of deflection and nonzero thereafter. DYCAST accounts for two types of nonlinear- ities which occur in dynamically loaded struc- tures: material and geometric. The nonlinear material behavior, exhibited by metals yielding plastically, enters the simulation process through the stress-strain curves input by the analyst. Three types of stress-strain curves are permitted-elastic-perfectly plastic, elastic-linearly hardening, and elastic-nonlin- early hardening. The current element stiffness- es during a multi-step analysis are determined using the tangent moduli corresponding to the current stress and strain, generalizing for multi-axial states at various points in the element . Geometric nonlinearities due to large deformations of the structure change the effective stiffness of the structure and are tested in DYCAST by an incremental convected coordinate approach. After each time increment the structure is reformed with straight elements between the displaced nodes and the previous values of accumulated strain, stress, and internal loads are carried forward as to initial states in the reformed elements. The incremental equations of motion for the system written in matrix form for an increment of time are: M {AU} + K {AU} = {AP} + {R} where M is the consistent mass matrix, K the stiffness matrix, {AU} and {AU} are the dis- placement and acceleration increments, {AP} the incremental external load vector, and {R} the vector of equilibrium corrections. Both material and geometric nonlinear effects enter the system of incremental equations through the stiffness matrix K. This system of equations is integrated numerically to obtain the response of the structural model. Currently, both "explicit" and "implicit" algorithms are implemented in DYCAST. Central differences and Modified Adams predictor- corrector methods are the "explicit" algorithms; and, Newmark - 3 and Wilson - 0 methods are the "implicit" algorithms. All methods but central differences, permit a variable time step throughout the analysis. DYCAST analysis results are printed histories of: o Nodal displacements, velocities, and accelerations o Nodal forces and moments o Element strains and stresses through the cross sections. Post processing of saved data permits plotting of response and various views of deformed structure. SUBFLOOR IDEALIZATION - Figure 6 illus- trates the finite element idealization used in applying the DYCAST computer program to the corrugated beam subfloor for analysis. Only half the structure is modeled to take advantage of the symmetry of the structure and the symmetrical experimental impact conditions. The rigid seat and lead mass is modeled as a lumped mass constrained to the four seat-rail attachment points. The seat tracks and C- section stiffeners of the floor platform are modeled with finite-element beams of the appropriate cross-section. The floor skin is modeled with triangular membrane elements. All the structure beneath the floor platform is modeled indirectly through five nonlinear springs at the floor beam-frame intersections. The DYCAST finite element model of each subfloor consists of the following: 40 beam elements 24 membrane elements 5 nonlinear springs 34 nodes 39 independent degrees of freedom (symmetric half-model) 3 dependent degrees of freedom. The usual elastic-plastic strain hardening material properties for 2024-T3 aluminum were used for the beam and membrane elements. For these elements any plasticity which occurs during the analysis is computed by DYCAST. However, for the structure beneath the floor platform a direct approach was taken. The static load-deflection results, subsequently presented in the Results and Discussion under a section entitled "Static Results," were approx- imated by line ségments and were used as the nonlinear spring properties. The object of using this simplifying technique was to deter-</page><page sequence="9">SUBFLOOR RESPONSE 2147 J- LUMPED MASS OUTBOARD '''^VS. 1-OAD^žlG^^^^^FORI^^ N ON LINEAR SPRINGS CORRUGATED BEAM Fig. 6 - Typical subfloor idealization for DYCAST computer program analysis mine if the static data could be used to adequately predict the dynamic deceleration pulse of the lead mass, and, if so, what are some of the limitations of this approach. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Results of an experimental and analytical study of the response of load-limiting aircraft subfloor structures to crash loadings are presented in figures 7 to 8. Included in the results are experimental static load-deflection (crush) data for each subfloor concept and dynamic deceleration responses to impact loading for locations at the c. g. of the lead mass and on the floor at the corner of the loading platform which simulated a seat/occupant. Comparisons of analytical decelerations from the DYCAST computer program are also made with the experimental data on each subfloor. STATIC TESTS - Static test results for the five load-limiting subfloor concepts are presented in figures 7(a) through 7(e). Shown on the left of each figure are photographs of the subfloor "before" testing and "after" testing whereas on the right of the figures are the load-deflection (crush) results from the static loading tests. Loads and displacements are given in both SI and English units. Several important points may be deduced from these results. First, as evident in the after test photographs, none of the five sub- floors broke apart but remained structurally intact and had residual strength after collapse of the lower crush zone. Second, under the static loads, the load platforms rolled outward (except for the corrugated beam-notched corner section) as plastic hinges formed either at the inner rail location or in the center of the subfloor. Third, the formation of plastic hin- ges, was as designed to help prevent loss of structural integrity and to maintain seat to structure integrity in the event of overload conditions on the floor. Fourth, although all five subfloor sections performed well in that no break-up (structurally) occurred, some collapsed with a more constant load with displacement than others. Compare, for example, figures 7(a) and 7(b) with figures 7(c) through 7(e). The crushing load was more desirable for the corrugated beam- notched corner and corrugated half-shell since</page><page sequence="10">2148 H. D. CARDEN AND R. J. HAYDUK the load remained relatively uniform in magnitude throughout the loading cycle com- pared to the notched corners, foam filled cylinders and canted bulkhead sub- floors. A design iteration on the latter three subfloors discussed above could eliminate some of the unwanted behavior noted with these approaches in the lower zone of the subfloors. For example, the high peak load on both the notched corner and canted bulkhead subfloors could possibly be reduced by providing a larger radius on the top and bottom flanges of the longitudinal beams to initiate buckling more readily. For the foam-filled cylinders, removal of the foam probably would result in improved static load-crush behavior since the foam compression in the confinement of the cylinders limited the available vertical crush distance and increased the load which caused the formation of the plastic hinge noted in figure 7(d). DYNAMIC TESTS AND ANALYTICAL COMPARISONS - Dynamic responses to impact loading on each of the five subfloor sections at a vertical impact velocity of 7.3 m/s (24 fps) with 0°pitch and roll angles are presented in figure 8. Photo- graphs of the subfloor "before" and "after" the impact tests are included on the left along with experimental and analytical responses of the upper lead mass c. g. (top right) and only experimental response on the floor at the corner of the loading platform (bottom right). Figure 8(a) presents the response for the corrugated beams - notched corners subfloor. Deceleration for the corner of the loading platform on the floor shows high frequency, local floor vibrations at approximately 350 Hz superimposed on the underlying pulse, however, similar shape, magnitude and duration to that of the c. g. response are evident. Only minor oscillations are evident on the deceleration of the c. g. High inherent damping of the lead minimized the higher frequency vibrations. Duration of the basic deceleration pulse was approximately .04 seconds. As may be noted in the bottom photograph of figures 7(a) and 8(a), the upper floor structure of the corrugated beams-notched corner subfloor was undeformed in both the static and dynamic tests. A comparison of the c. g. deceleration with the static load-deflection data shows the same basic shape for the dynamic response as that noted for the static data. Consequently, the static load-deflection response was very similar to the dynamic behavior of the subfloor. For example, decel- eration rapidly reached approximately 20 g's and gradually increased to a peak of approxi- mately 39 gTs exhibiting the same character as the static load with stroke. This is also reflected in very good correlation of both the magnitude and duration of the DYCAST predictions and the experimental deceleration of the lead mass c. g. The behavior of the corrugated half-shell subfloor to impact loads is illustrated in figure 8(b). The deceleration on the floor at the corner of the loading platform shows basically the same load pulse as the c. g. mass; however, a higher frequency local vibration of the floor around 600 Hz occurred on the pulse in this case. Deceleration of the lead mass c. g. was around 30 g's throughout the approximately .04 seconds collapse time of the corrugated half-shell crush zone. The relative- ly constant limit load provided by the corruga- ted half-shell is desirable to achieve the maximum energy dissipation with available stroke. As may be noted in the static case in figure 7(b), a plastic hinge occurred in the middle of the upper floor structure after approximately 7.62 cm (3 inches) of crush which corresponds to a deflection in the dynamic case at about 0.015 seconds. In the dynamic case, the upper floor structure was essentially undeformed during the impact loading due to the resistance of the vertical inertia of the loading platform to a change in motion direction. Consequently, during the first 7.62 cm (3 inches) of deflection, the static load- deflection was a good representation of the dynamic behavior and the DYCAST results (dotted curve) was in good agreement with the experi- mental data (out to .015 second). Beyond .015 second, the weakening of the floor by the plastic hinge is reflected in the DYCAST results. Overall the magnitude and duration predicted by the analysis is still very good. Figure 8(c) presents the dynamic response on the notched corners concept to the crash loading. The floor response was essentially the same magnitude as that of the c. g. except the superimposed floor vibrations on the basic pulse are predominantly around 600 Hz. Decel- eration of the lead mass c. g. was fairly constant at about 25 gfs during the .04 second pulse duration but some what higher amplitude vibrations than experienced on the previous c. g. decelerations are evident in this case at about 350 Hz. In the static test of this section, plastic hinges formed in the upper floor at the lateral locations of the notched corners (figure 7(c)) just prior to 2.54 cm (1 inch) of crushing. In the dynamic case; however, the floor structure remained undeformed as shown in figure 8(c). The reduction in strength of the static load-deflection data adversely affected the dynamic predictions by the DYCAST analysis of the c. g. deceleration. The predicted response by DYCAST during the first ,.007 second is in excellent agreement with the experimental c. g. response but the static load-deflection data beyond this time no longer is representative of the dynamic</page><page sequence="11">SUBFLOOR RESPONSE 2149 Fig. 7 - Photographs of lo ad- limi ting sub- floors and static load-deflection results (a) Corrugated beam-notched corners behavior. Although the static load-deflection data had an initial high load peak followed by a gradual reduction in load, the dynamic response did not reflect as pronounced a variation but was generally more constant in amplitude which, as previously noted, is a desirable behavior. This behavior again may be attributed to the absence of any plastic hinge formation in the dynamic test. Dynamic response data for the foam-filled cylinders subfloor are presented in figure 8(d). A comparison of the magnitude of the floor deceleration with that of the c. g. indicates that the floor response, with superimposed 600 Hz floor vibrations, was slightly lower in magnitude than the c. g. pulse. As shown in the top right of the figure, the c. g. decel- eration was a relatively constant approximately 40 g pulse of about .035 second duration. A low amplitude higher frequency vibration is evident on the c. g. response as was the case for the previous subfloors. This static load-deflection data for the foam-filled cylinders in figure 7(d) indicates that at approximately 5.72 cm (2.25 inches) of crush, lateral bending of the upper floor occurred due to plastic hinge formation at the location of the foam-filled cylinders. As may</page><page sequence="12">2150 H. D. CARDEN AND R. J. HAYDUK Fig. 7 - Photographs of load-limiting sub- floors and static load-deflection results be noted, however, in the dynamic test, the floor remained undeformed. A comparison of the DYCAST predictions again show good correla- tion until the static nonlinear crush character- istics deviate from the dynamic behavior because of the occurrance of the plastic hinges in the static test data. The dynamic responses for the canted bulkheads subfloor are presented in figure 8(e). The measured deceleration on the floor again shows the characteristic local floor vibration of approximately 600 Hz superimposed on a basic load pulse that appears to be slightly lower in magnitude than the lead mass c. g. response. Deceleration of the lead mass had an initial peak of above 40 g's or more followed by a relatively constant level around 25 gfs. Lower amplitude vibrations are also evident on the c. g. response. Although the lateral bulkheads in this subfloor concept were canted 30° from the vertical, the stiff longitudinal floor beams caused the formation of plastic hinges at the location of the longitudinal beams early in the static loading cycle (see figure 7(e)). Following this buckling of the upper floor, the load level under the reduced stiffness of the section was relatively constant with deflection. (b) Corrugated half-shell</page><page sequence="13">SUBFLOOR RESPONSE 2151 Fig. 7 - Photographs of load-limiting sub- floors and static load-deflection results (c) Notched corners A comparison of this static behavior with the shape of the dynamic c. g. response shows good corre.1 ation as far as similarity in the trend of response. The dynamic vertical decelerations of the lead mass c. g. predicted by DYCAST show good correlation with the measured response for the initial peak and for about the first .01 second of the subsequent history. Beyond this time (.01 second), the reduced stiffness of the static data of the nonlinear crush zone (springs) underpredicts the magnitude of the response. Again this may be attributed to the differences between the static subfloor behavior (figure 7(e)) and the dynamic behavior illustrated in the "after" test photograph in figure 9(e). As may be noted in the latter photograph, the dynamic behavior of the canted bulkheads sub- floor did show the initial stages of upper floor buckling (plastic hinges formation) ; however, the severity is much less than was the case in the static tests. Consequently, the loss in stiffness in the dynamic test was less following the initial peak load and the measured deceleration level was subsequently higher than the DYCAST predictions based upon the static data.</page><page sequence="14">2152 H.

This paper has focused on the eval- uation of several concepts of load-limiting airframe subfloors, a major component for crash load attenuation. These subfloors provide a high-strength upper structural floor platform to retain the seats with a crush zone beneath the platform to absorb impact energy and to limit the vertical loads. Subfloor sections were experimentally and analytically evaluated for nonlinear static and dynamic behavior. Experimental static load-deflection data and dynamic deceleration response for five load-limiting subfloors indicate that the floor sections perform well throughout the loading cycle; that is, structural integrity and residual strength of the subfloors was maintained. The data also indicate that some of the sections were more effective in providing an essentially constant limit load with displace- ment than others. Design iteration, however, could possibly alleviate the undesirable characteristics of the less effective sections. The DYCAST finite element computer program was used in a simplified and economical manner to model the complex non-linear response of the aircraft subfloor sections to crash loads. Static load-deflection data were used to characterize the nonlinear crush zone of the subfloors. The capability of DYCAST to accurate- ly analyze the load-limiting subfloors was verified by comparisons between experimental and analytical response data of a rigid lead mass representing an occupant. Good correlation was indicated between the pre- dicted deceleration magnitude and duration and the lead mass (occupant) experimental responses for the subfloors in which the static deforma- tion mode closely approximated the dynamic deformation behavior. In other cases, com- parisons were good only for the initial peak deceleration and limited, subsequent response where the static and dynamic deformation modes corresponded. The analysis and correlation with experimental results have shown the usefulness of statically determined crush data for dynamic analysis; however, the results also indicate that the analyst must exercise care and have some assurance that the static deformation behavior will approximate the dynamic deforma- tion behavior.
