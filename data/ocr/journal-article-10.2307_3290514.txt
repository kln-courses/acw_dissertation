<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE FUNCTION OF THE GODS IN VERGIL'S AENEID By DOROTHEA CLINTON WOODWORTH University of California Los Angeles Probably every teacher of the Aeneid in high school or college has repeatedly been confronted by students with such questions as these: "Did Vergil really believe in the gods ?" "Are we supposed to think that Cupid was actually substituted for Ascanius?" "Don't you think it spoils the story to have the gods always meddling in human affairs ?" Such questions cannot be answered categorically, neither can they with impunity be left unanswered. A certain university professor, being asked to explain his negative attitude towards the classics, said: "I read Vergil in high school and didn't like him; I thought his characters were sticks, and his story had no relation to human life. If the Aeneid is the high point of Latin literature, why read Latin at all ?" While it is to be hoped that few students of Vergil would agree with him, yet I have known, at one time or another, a good many immature readers of the Aeneid whose attitude toward the characters of the story, especially the hero himself, ranged from slightly contemptu- ous to distinctly resentful. This attitude, I believe, is due not so much to moral reprobation of the conduct of Aeneas and the rest, as to the rather widespread conventional view that the human characters are literally "sticks"--puppets in the hands of the gods.' The objection to divine intervention, as usually interpreted, 1 Professor Prescott says: "If one charged him with turning his characters into puppets, he would accept the criticism as a compliment; he is simply visual- izing what he regards to be the truth of his philosophical creed - in all human actions the godhead is the impelling force"; cf. The Development of Virgil's Art: Chicago, University of Chicago Press (1927), 261. While this statement is in a sense merely the obverse of the view I am setting forth, nevertheless it is, in my opinion, either unintelligible or wholly misleading to present-day students making their first acquaintance with the Aeneid. 112</page><page sequence="2">THE GODS IN VERGIL'S AENEID 113 becomes especially strong in the fourth book, where it appears that Dido, who has already been tricked by Venus into falling in love with Aeneas, is now tricked by Juno into a false marriage with him, only to have him snatched away, without volition on the part of either, by the intervention of Jupiter and Mercury. This exaggerated version of the "puppet" theory, which some students actually hold, inevitably destroys true appreciation of Vergil's purposes, and especially of his value to the modern world. How shall we, then, interpret Vergil's gods? Of the many answers to this question which have been propounded by scholars, some, such as various allegorical interpretations, involve either inconsistency or fine-spun fancies; others, based upon the phil- osophical and religious thought of Vergil's day (itself a fertile field of controversy), however sound they may be, are, to me at any rate, too vague for personal satisfaction and too abstract to impart to a class of puzzled students.2 I have tried, therefore, by examining all cases in the poem in which gods appear as actors, or as influencing human action, to work out from the Aeneid itself a theory consistent with the purposes of Vergil as we know them, and simple enough to aid the efforts of young students toward the apprehension of those purposes. That the religious purpose of the Aeneid is primarily concerned with Fata, or Destiny, is well recognized. As Sellar3 says: "It was Vergil's aim in the Aeneid to show that this edifice of Roman Empire, of which the enterprise of Aeneas was the foundation . . . was no mere work of human hands, but had been designed and built up by divine purpose and guidance." To this impersonal power the gods themselves were subordinate. The ultimate phil- osophical problem of fate and free will, whether of subordinate deities or of men, inherent in this concept, need not be discussed 2 For example Prescott, op. cit., pp. 250-53, especially p. 252: "His general attitude is a compromise between his own personal convictions, which appear only beneath the surface, and the Homeric conventional treatment of the gods as part of epic machinery on the one hand, and orthodox Roman notions of the gods on the other." 3 Cf. Sellar, Roman Poets of the Augustan Age - Virgil3: Oxford, Claren- don Press (1883), 326.</page><page sequence="3">114 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL here, because it is not discussed in the Aeneid; a certain compat- ibility of the two is assumed, though not explained. I doubt whether it will ever be possible to say with assurance what were Vergil's personal convictions about the literal existence of plural anthropomorphic deities. This uncertainty is partly due, as has often been pointed out, to his use of Homeric mythological material, inevitable in the epic tradition, in combination with national Roman and individual religious ideas. The citation of Homeric parallels, however, though interesting for the explana- tion of the form into which various scenes with divine actors are cast, seems to me irrelevant in explaining the purpose of such scenes.4 Our object is to discover, specifically, what Vergil intends us to understand as the function of his divine characters in the action of the Aeneid. In the narrative, the gods, as mediate powers, naturally func- tion in two ways: with reference to the supreme power, Fata, and with reference to human beings. I believe that in both connections their activities are best interpreted as primarily symbolic, but that two different types of symbolism are employed. The fact that many of the same deities and the same divine actions necessarily operate in both directions, linking the deeds of men with the purposes of Destiny, has obscured the double roles and the two- fold significance of certain deities; the one function - the rela- tion of the gods to Fate - has been generally recognized, while the other, so far as I am aware, has not been adequately explained. As the main plot of the Aeneid, outlined in the first seven verses of the poem, takes Aeneas, under Destiny, Troiae . .. ab oris to Italiam . . . Laviniaque . . . litora, with the foreshadowing of the "walls of lofty Rome," so the secondary plot, perhaps better called the superplot, deals with the activities of Juno in attempt- ing to thwart that Destiny. Its importance in relation to the main action is brought out by a symmetrical arrangement at the begin- ning and at the end of the poem: the introductory verses are 4 For example the descent of Mercury (Aeneid Iv, 222-78) to Aeneas closely parallels the sending of Hermes to Calypso (Odyssey v, 28-148), but the pur- poses of the two messages are different. See p. 117, below.</page><page sequence="4">THE GODS IN VERGIL'S AENEID 115 immediately followed by the passage (I, 8-11) in which the Muse is invoked to explain the hostility of the Queen of the Gods to the hero; and in the twelfth book the duel between Turnus and Aeneas, which forms the denouement of the main plot, is immedi- ately preceded by the scene (xII, 791-841) in which Juno submits to Fate at Jove's request and renounces her hatred of the Trojans in consideration of certain concessions. This superplot reveals, along with the idea of Destiny, a dualistic conception of opposing forces in the universe. Though Fate is immutable and ultimately invincible, yet its ends are not attained without a struggle. The casus and labores which prevent the easy and direct attainment of the goal are caused by an antagonistic power, which in the story of Aeneas is represented by Juno.5 The poet's purpose in the action of the superplot is to exalt the supreme power of Destiny, specifically as revealed in the high destiny of Rome, by prolonging the struggle and magnifying the opposing force over which it finally triumphs. As the antagonistic force is represented by Juno, so Jupiter, in part at least, is identified with Fate itself. Prescott' says that Fate and the will of Jove are identical. Sellar' calls attention to pas- sages in which "Jupiter is represented rather as cognizant of the Fates than as their author." The apparent discrepancy is removed by regarding Jupiter, like Juno, as a symbolic personification, the former of the power of Destiny as the latter of the opposing power. Third in importance in this plot is Venus, who, out of a partisan interest in the particular destiny of Rome, is engaged continually in assisting the hero and foiling Juno's efforts to thwart the will of Jupiter. Like Venus, a large number of divine characters appear, dealing directly with human beings, to further 5 This view, which is in a way analogous to Persian dualism, or to the early Christian conception of God and the Devil, holds the important difference that Vergil appears to ascribe neither to Fate nor to the opposing force any moral qualities. As Sellar (op. cit., p. 340) says, the action of Fate "is purely political, neither ethical, though its ultimate tendency is beneficent, nor personal." 6 Op. cit., p. 250: "In Virgil . . . it is Fate or the will of Jove - the two are identical - which directs the action." 7 Op. cit., p. 337. Book x, 112f is the most significant.</page><page sequence="5">116 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL or oppose the ends of Destiny. Distinct from the rest is Apollo, who repeatedly appears, not to intervene in the action but to reveal to men the will of Fate. That he, working through various agencies, is himself subordinate to the supreme power, is explic- itly stated in one of these revelations (III, 250-52) : Accipite ergo animis atque haec mea figite dicta, quae Phoebo pater omnipotens, mihi Phoebus Apollo praedixit, vobis Furiarum ego maxima pando. In the second book it is a priest of Apollo who makes to Aeneas, just awakened from his dream of Hector, the tragic pronounce- ment beginning: Venit summa dies et ineluctabile tempus Dardaniae [II, 324f]. In the wanderings of the third book Apollo is recognized as the author of warnings and predictions received successively from the oracle at Delos (III, 73-121), the Penates in a dream (IIi, 147-91; especially 154f), the Harpies (III, 250-57), and Helenus (III, 359, 371, 434, 474, etc.); in the fourth book he is mentioned by Aeneas as the source of his instructions to go to Italy (Iv, 345, echoed by Dido in vs. 376); in the sixth book especially and repeatedly he is presented as the source of the Sibyl's prophetic power (vi, 9f, 35, 77, et passim). In the later books, after Italy has been reached, his function as the symbolic Revealer of Destiny ceases to be significant, and he appears only in the second type of symbolism, connected with individual mortals; see p. 120, below. Of the other deities appearing as subordinate characters in the superplot, a few are quite obviously abstractions symbolizing human action. The best example is Fama, who appears not only in the famous descriptive passage beginning': Extemplo Libyae magnas it Fama per urbes, Fama, malum qua non aliud velocius ullum, 8 iv, 173-97. Fama appears also in Iv, 298 and 666; vii, 104; Ix, 473, and xI, 139.</page><page sequence="6">THE GODS IN VERGIL'S AENEID 117 but also in numerous other scenes in which a poetic coloring is thus lent to mere sordid human gossip. A similar personification is that of Somnus in the fifth book (vss. 838-61), where Pali- nurus, after resisting the god's insidious suggestion that it is safe to rest, is at last tricked into slumber. One can hardly imagine here that Vergil intended to invoke an objective supernatural agency; he merely personifies Sleep as a vivid means of showing the pilot's unsuccessful attempt to resist his own weariness. Other supernatural figures scarcely less abstract than these, together with some whose symbolic nature is less evident, appear as the instruments either of Jupiter and Venus in furthering the ends of Fate, or of Juno in opposing them. Of these, some are an allegorical representation of natural forces, as Aeolus, king of the winds (I, 50-86, 137-41), by whose agency Juno, in the first book, stirs up the storm, and Neptune (I, 124-56; v, 779-826; and vII, 21-24), by whose authority the storm is calmed and who, at the request of Venus, insures safe conduct through his domain to Aeneas after he leaves Carthage. Others seem to be symbols of psychological forces. In this group I place Mercury, whose appearance, as interpres divum, love miissus ab ipso (Iv, 356, referring to Iv, 222-78), to Aeneas in Carthage is one of the incidents most resented by some readers of the Aeneid on the ground that it deprives the hero of all free- dom of will. On the contrary, Mercury represents the voice of Destiny- one might call it conscience - working in Aeneas' own mind. As Prescott says (op. cit., p. 282) : "Mercury accom- plishes here what in modern literature Aeneas himself would accomplish by a calm consideration of his moral obligation." But as in modern literature some objective episode - the taunt of a Tyrian, the complaint of a follower, or perhaps the naive comment of Ascanius - by calling Aeneas' attention to the fact that he was building Dido's city instead of his own, would serve to crystalize his "calm consideration" into action, so Vergil, after careful preparation, introduces an objective messenger from Jove to remind Aeneas of his neglected duty toward the fulfillment of his destiny and that of his race. That Aeneas is not deprived of free</page><page sequence="7">118 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL will, in his own estimation at any rate, is shown by his delibera- tion in the verses immediately following Mercury's disappearance (Iv, 279-86), in which he is represented as eager to go but uncer- tain how to accomplish his departure. That Aeneas' conscience had been troubling him even before Mercury's message, which merely served to hasten his decision, the poet informs us explicitly when he makes Aeneas tell Dido (Iv, 351-55) that his sleep had been disturbed every night by dreams of warnings from his father and thoughts of the wrong he was doing to his son. Mercury, then, symbolically representing Aeneas' conscience, is one of the numerous supernatural instruments used by Fate in dealing with human beings. A less known but even more striking figure is the Fury employed by Juno, the opponent of Fate. In the seventh book, when all is propitious for Aeneas, and the envoys of King Latinus are actually on the way to offer Lavinia in marriage to the Trojan leader, Juno resolves to try the last resource against Fate; though she knows the outcome is fixed, yet she will delay it and let it be realized only at the cost of much bloodshed. To this end, she says (vii, 312) : Flectere si nequeo superos, Acheronta movebo. Accordingly she summons from Hades the dread Fury, Allecto, who proceeds (vii, 323-560) by three means to insure hostility between the Latins and the Trojans: "She inspires the queen, Amata, mother of Lavinia . . . and already predisposed in favor of Turnus' suit, with a mad resentment and aversion to the union with the Trojans; Allecto then approaches Turnus and fills him with a furious eagerness to resist Latinus' purpose, even to the extent of fighting with the Trojans; finally, Allecto uses the accidental killing, by Ascanius, of a pet animal belonging to one of the rustic families to inspire in the country folk hostility toward the Trojans." ' Again it is noteworthy that the divine being does not in any case change the earlier predispositions of 9 Cf. Prescott, op. cit., pp. 429f.</page><page sequence="8">THE GODS IN VERGIL'S AENEID 119 the human characters; she only stimulates to action the psycho- logical processes already at work. She is a personification of "war psychology" as it spreads among the women, among the noble warriors, and among the common fighting men. Among other subordinate deities, we may notice, as instru- ments on the side of Fate, Cupid (used by Venus in her efforts against Juno; I, 657-722), whose symbolic interpretation is obvious and whose objective necessity in the action is nil, since Dido could quite as easily have fallen in love with Aeneas while holding on her lap the real Ascanius; also, in the later books, Faunus (vii, 81-106) and Tiber (viii, 36-101), who, prophesy- ing to Latinus and Aeneas respectively, represent the destiny of Italy as bound up with and ready for the coming of the Trojans. In the employ of Juno against Fate, we find, in addition to Aeolus and Allecto, Iris (Iv, 693-705; v, 606-53; and Ix, 1 and 805), of whose several appearances the most important is designed to inspire the Trojan women to burn their own ships (an act to which they are already predisposed by their weariness of the sea), and who seems accordingly to be a psychological symbol similar to Allecto; also Juturna (xii, 134 et passim), the divine sister of Turnus, who, as the special protector of that hero, belongs pri- marily to the second classification of deities, yet to be considered. In all these instances, Vergil's selection of a particular myth- ological figure to serve or oppose the purposes of Destiny must have been largely determined for him by tradition - occasionally by Italian legend, more often by Greek literary models, as Cupid from Apollonius, Mercury and most of the rest from Homer. In some cases, the mythological figure seems to be introduced merely for ornament; the symbolic force, e.g., of Vulcan (viii, 370-453), who, at the request of Venus, makes for Aeneas new armor, pat- terned after that of Achilles in the Iliad, is, if present at all, atten- uated out of ready recognition. But from the purely mythological figure of Vulcan at one extreme to the symbolic abstraction of Fama at the other, all these divinities, together with their supe- riors, Jupiter and Juno, are actors in the great supernatural drama interwoven with and parallel to Aeneas' struggle to fulfill his</page><page sequence="9">120 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL destiny; all alike are employed by the poet to emphasize the inter- relation of destiny and human character, and are introduced into the narrative not at random but at significant points chosen to illustrate the nearness, at all crises of human action, of the Deity. The second symbolic function of the gods, though more difficult to interpret to modern thought, is, I believe, scarcely less impor- tant for the comprehension of the Aeneid than the realization of their r6le in the strife for and against Fate. It probably arose in Vergil's mind as a development of the native Italian concept of the Genius of a man, the Juno of a woman, as a sort of spiritual counterpart or double. The divine being was in part protector and "guardian angel," while at the same time he was identified with the human being who worshiped him. The prominence in Vergil's time of this survival of old Italic religion is shown by the worship in the city of Rome of the Genius of Augustus. The leading characters in the Aeneid, as well as some of the minor ones, are provided each with such a divine counterpart. Instead of the abstract and colorless figure of the Italian Genius, however, Vergil has utilized for this purpose one or another of the Olympic deities, selected, upon mythological considerations, for suitability of character or traditional connection with a given mortal, or both. The choice, e.g., of Apollo as guardian of Iulus (Ix, 638- 71), to remove him from danger after his first engagement in battle, was determined by the fact that Augustus claimed Apollo as the special patron of himself and of the Julian line, whose ancestor was Iulus. Postponing, for the moment, the outstanding examples in the epic of this symbolic tutelage, let us examine the case of one of Vergil's best and most sympathetically drawn minor characters - the warrior-maid, Camilla (xI, 498-521, 532-96, and 648-867). Camilla is introduced to us at the head of her Volscian cavalry in the midst of the general engagement which forms the chief part of the eleventh book. She is given the center of the stage after Turnus, planning an ambush, assents to her suggestion that he withdraw and allow her forces to meet the Trojan horse. Thereupon the poet shifts the scene to give us a conversation</page><page sequence="10">THE GODS IN VERGIL'S AENEID 121 between Diana and Opis, one of her attendants, in which the latter is instructed not to protect Camilla (which would be con- trary to Fate) but to avenge her coming death. Diana takes this opportunity to recount the early history of Camilla; her own care for the girl had dated fromthe occasion when, as a baby, she had been tied to a spear-shaft, consigned to the protection of Diana, and hurled across a swollen river by her father, who, escaping from his enemies, dared not risk his child's life by holding her as he swam the stream. The narrative of the battle, now resumed, extols the exploits of the warrior maiden; finally her tragic, but heroic, death is avenged by Opis' swift retaliation on the foe whose spear had struck her. Here we have a comparatively simple case of divine and human "doubles": Diana is the patroness, Camilla the worshiper; in character the two are practically iden- tical; Camilla, like her goddess, is a huntress, a virgin, proud, fearless, active, and withal feminine. Diana, though she had saved her life in infancy, is powerless to save her from death in battle; yet she exerts what effort she can in her behalf. The individual deity, in this case and others, appears to symbolize the motives and interests of the corresponding human being. The deity her- self, though possessing some supernatural power and in particular a supernatural knowledge of Fate, is finite, the limitations being imposed not only by Fate but also by the activities of other deities. The two most important examples of this divine-human rela- tionship are, of course, that of Aeneas with Venus and that of Dido with Juno. Venus, as the patroness of the hero, has of right a position, as already indicated, in the supernatural plot. Juno has, so to speak, a double role: in one capacity she symbolizes the force opposing Destiny; in the other she is the divine counterpart of Dido. It has been noted that in dealing with other human characters, as she does frequently in the last six books, she works through intermediate deities, especially Allecto and Juturna, who is probably to be taken as the divine double of Turnus. Juno as the symbolic personification of Dido's purposes has again two aspects, political and personal. The first purpose is the founding and aggrandizement of Carthage. The intimate con-</page><page sequence="11">122 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL nection of this theme with opposition to the destiny of Aeneas and Rome is brought out repeatedly and emphatically from the begin- ning of the first book (vss. 12-22) : Urbs antiqua fuit - Tyrii tenuere coloni - Karthago, to the point (Iv, 608 and 625) where she is invoked as witness to Dido's dying prayer for the coming of an avenger, which to the Roman involved in its associations the whole history of the Punic Wars. In this ambition for Carthage, her attitude and Dido's are identical, except for her wider view and fuller knowledge of Fate. The second purpose which belongs alike to Dido and Juno is to effect a permanent union between the Queen and Aeneas. In this aspect one sees Juno's early and important Roman function as presiding deity of marriage. Here in particular I believe that the apprehension of Juno as a personification of Dido's own inner consciousness will relieve much confusion in the interpretation of the fourth book. Immediately after Anna has persuaded Dido to lay aside her rigid refusal to contemplate any husband but the dead Sychaeus, while the queen's love, though unknown to Aeneas, is self-confessed, Vergil gives us the scene in which Juno tries to trick into consent to a marriage the wary Venus. In my opinion, this scene not only shows us the formulation of Dido's purpose to marry Aeneas but also affords the exact counterpart of the relations between Aeneas and Dido; she, like Juno, regards as a marriage what Aeneas and Venus, with a knowledge of his destiny, cannot so regard. As to the scene in the cave (Iv, 165- 72), the supernatural trappings merely express in poetic symbol- ism the rather common situation in which the two parties to a love-affair regard their relations from two entirely different and incompatible points of view. Dido "called it a marriage" because she wanted to believe that it would be permanent, while Aeneas, as he later told her (Iv, 338f), had no such intention. In this same connection it is perhaps significant that, while Juno, patroness of Dido, is goddess of marriage, Venus, who</page><page sequence="12">THE GODS IN VERGIL'S AENEID 123 bears an analogous relation to Aeneas, is goddess of love - not of marriage. The much-argued question whether Aeneas was in love with Dido may perhaps receive some light from this symbolic interpretation of the deities concerned. As to Prescott's argu- ment 10 that Aeneas did love Dido because "the preparatory scenes of the first book were evidently constructed with a view to stirring in Aeneas, quite as much as in Dido, an inevitable love," while one must, of course, always allow for a difference in the definition of terms when discussing the subject of love, I cannot believe that Aeneas loved Dido, at any rate in the sense in which Dido under- stood the term. My view is based chiefly upon the great difference in the preparatory scenes affecting Aeneas and those affecting Dido, and especially upon the fact that while Cupid, that Alex- andrian figure of romantic love, is the symbolic instrument of Aeneas' effect upon Dido, in the case of Aeneas the sole agent is Venus, whose particular qualifications as goddess of love are such as to be quite consistent with Aeneas' view of the whole affair as rather episodic. In other words, I think that, just as Juno repre- sents Dido's purpose to marry Aeneas, so Venus, at this point, represents Aeneas' purpose, or rather willingness, to indulge in a perfectly sincere but temporary amorous interlude. Vergil does not condone this conduct, much less defend it; he makes it quite clear that both Dido and Aeneas have done wrong. It is likewise clear, as various writers have pointed out, that in this matter the conduct of neither goddess is free from reproach - a natural con- clusion if we believe them to be counterparts of the human charac- ters. A more pleasing aspect of Venus is her representation of the political purpose of Aeneas, which is the main theme of the epic. As the guardian spirit of Aeneas, as the ancestress of all his descendants and especial patroness of the Julian line, Venus guides and protects him from the time when she appears to him on the last night of Troy (II, 528-621), through all his wander- ings to and including his final duel with Turnus (xii, 786f). In 10 Op. cit., pp. 282f, beginning: "Nor must the modern reader attempt to explain the situation by assuring himself that Aeneas did not love Dido."</page><page sequence="13">124 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL these activities she is not omnipotent; she is powerless to prevent his troubles and difficulties. But she has a clearer view than he of Fate, of which she advises him from time to time. She thus symbolizes his own more enlightened self. Throughout the action of the poem all her supernatural intervention may be explained either as the result of his own thinking, as when she reveals to him the divine powers at work in the overthrow of Troy and sends him home to save his own family, or as the timely, even providential, assistance of a natural external force, as when she helps the physician to heal his wound (xii, 411-24). Such inter- vention signifies the importance of the action involved and helps to keep close together the divine and human themes. It follows from this interpretation of the deities, which might be extended into much greater detail, that the human plot could be completely detached from supernatural agencies, modernized, and rationalized, without any essential change in the structure of the narrative. For example, in the first book, Aeneas and his fol- lowers, setting out from Sicily to Italy, are caught by a sudden, perhaps equinoctial, storm, which causes them to land, in two detachments, on the coast of Africa, near the newly founded city of Carthage. The next morning Aeneas, exploring, is met by a huntress from the city, who tells him the story of Dido, thus stimulating his interest in the Queen, and who also points out to him a bypath which will take him, unseen and unmolested, to the royal audience-chamber. There, in concealment, he sees Dido receive graciously representatives from his supposedly lost ships, and, when he steps out of hiding to thank her, is himself hos- pitably welcomed. At the banquet held that night in his honor, his young son Iulus, coming with lavish gifts from the ship, completes, by his responsiveness to the ardent queen's affectionate advances, the scarcely difficult task of arousing in her a violent love for Aeneas. In this book as in the others the actions of the characters are carefully motivated by Vergil without reference to the divine machinery. That they are intended to be morally responsible for their acts is shown by the repeated cases in which they deliberate</page><page sequence="14">THE GODS IN VERGIL'S AENEID 125 beforehand or censure their own conduct afterwards. A clear illustration is the case of Dido in the fourth book; her conversa- tion with Anna at the beginning and her soliloquy just before her death are alike designed to show that she acted in spite of her own better judgment; she might have said, with Medea, Video meliora proboque; deteriora sequor. So far as I can see, no sig- nificant action or event in the entire narrative requires the super- natural mechanism for either physical or psychological plausibil- ity. In this generalization I am, of course, regarding portents, visions, and other revelations of Destiny as in themselves sym- bolic. I also exclude the visit to Hades, which is a revelation of Destiny on a grand scale and which, important as it is to the philosophical thought of the poem, is an interruption to the narra- tive proper. One may naturally inquire why, if the human plot may be completely detached from the supernatural, Vergil chose to inter- weave the two in so elaborate and intricate a design. Of the many ways in which the gods add value to the epic, a few of the most evident may be mentioned. They are used for the adornment of the work; the epic tradition, the mythological background of pre- vious literature, demanded their presence; further, the style of the work is infinitely enriched, to cite one feature out of many, by the contrasting, continually shifting scenes, first between human characters, then between deities, and again between a man and a god. They are used for emphasis; all significant human actions are related to a higher purpose by their ascription to divine inter- vention. They are used to bring out the religious purpose of the work; difficult as it may be to say with assurance exactly what was Vergil's theology, the high religious tone of his view of Destiny is unmistakable; and so abstract a conception is undoubt- edly more easily apprehended by the modern reader, especially the young student, by means of the workings of intermediate deities, more closely related to humanity. In presenting to a class this view of the symbolic nature of the gods, one should be careful not to obscure the fact that from the artistic standpoint they are essential and very real. Yet in reference to the questions that</page><page sequence="15">126 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL arise concerning the ethics, the purposes, the personalities of the human characters, my experience with students leads me to believe that a more intelligent interpretation of the narrative and a better appreciation of Vergil's purposes may be attained if the reader of the Aeneid apprehends the deities as, on the one hand, symbolic actors in the struggle for and against Fate, and, on the other, as personifications of the motives governing the human characters.</page></plain_text>
