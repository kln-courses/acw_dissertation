From Whimsy to Literacy Science fiction is central to everything we've ever done, and people who make fun of science fiction writers don't know what they're talking about. " - Ray Bradbury As walking be a outdoors young the girl railroad riding I was my not trestle bike, a reader. (hope looking I my would under mom much rocks, isn't rather read- and be outdoors riding my bike, looking under rocks, and walking the railroad trestle (hope my mom isn't read- ing this). But, there were exceptions, such as anything written by Jules Verne. He drew my attention because of the fantasy and maintained my interest with the possibilities embedded in his novels. It is the image crafted by Jules Verne that came to mind when I watched John Glenn launched into space. This was certainly not exactly as Verne portrayed the launch of a rocket from the Columbiad space gun. But there are many parallels between the fiction of Verne and reality. Fiction has its place in learning, and science is no exception. When literature is fact-based, it can enhance the understanding of science. Literature serves as a hook to engage children who may not otherwise be readers or show interest in science. But its role should be monitored. Many educators are concerned about the use of anthropomorphic characters in children's literature. Can you imagine a child growing up and maintaining the belief that bears can discuss the merits of porridge and their chairs? When literature is whimsy, it can be pointed out to children. What we should be concerned about is literature that appears to include factual information that has not been vetted and may not be accurate. That type of literature can lead to misconceptions and the possibility of ingrained erroneous facts. Reading about science -related topics is one step in the development of literacy. However, it should not be introduced in isolation. The process of learning to read and write begins early. Children actually don't learn how to read and then learn how to write. Rather, writing is often easier for some children to start with. They begin to experiment on their own with scribbles on paper and soon they identify and use symbols and invented spelling (Pearson 2002). By understanding the progression of learning and engaging children in reading, writing, and conversing about science and technology, we develop literacy skills and encourage both reading and science literacy. Connecting with literature ignites the imagination and provokes thinking. As Ray Bradbury says, "So while our art cannot, as we wish it could, save us from wars, priva- tion, envy, greed, old age, or death, it can revitalize us amidst it all."
