LX/3 Encountering the Hindu "Other" Tantrism and the Brahmans of South India Douglas Renfrew Brooks RECENT SCHOLARSHIP has done much to reclaim the largely unex- plored field of Hindu esotericism known as Tantra or Tantrism. Unlike in the nineteenth century, when the Hindu Tantric canon was dismissed as "mere manuals of mysticism, magic, and superstition of the worst and most silly kind" (Monier-Williams:129), contemporary indologists admit with more sympathy "the presence of Tantric elements nearly everywhere in Hinduism from the Middle Ages to our own day" (Padoux 1981:350). The acknowledgement of pervasive Tantric influence in Indian reli- gion has made defining Tantrism and classifying different Hinduisms only more difficult. Many contemporary Hindus, especially south Indi- ans who are urban, middle-class, and exposed to western culture, undoubtedly would prefer less ambivalence. They do not wish to be called "Tantric" or to associate with things "Tantric." In contemporary south Indian vernaculars, "Tantra" and related terms suggest shady con- nections with illicit sex, forbidden intoxicants, or effective black magic.1 However, there is as much fear of the Tantric's perceived powers as there is distrust or disdain for his putative licentious and scurrilous excesses. Tantrism's dubious reputation may be often exaggerated but it is not wholly unfounded, at least as far as certain non-initiates are concerned. One important Tantric strategy for breaking through barriers that con- Douglas Renfrew Brooks is Assistant Professor of Religion in the Department of Religion and Clas- sics, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY 14627. 11 am limiting the discussion of Tantrism specifically to its Hindu forms and don't mean to suggest that these generalizations pertain to Buddhist or Jain Tantric traditions. I am particularly interested in recording the views and impressions of south Indians from brahman communities.

Tantrics frequently reverse or reject high-caste standards in ritual, sometimes by including ordinarily impure substances, such as wine or meat, or by engaging in taboo behaviors, such as sexual intercourse outside of marriage. The Tantrics' intention is not merely to offend and rarely is it to draw attention from outsiders. Rather, Tantrics engage the forbidden to transcend mundane restrictions and to experience directly the inherently blissful (ananda) nature of the ultimate in the form of certain worldly (and often forbidden) pleasures (kWma). More interested in how these convention-transcending meth- ods bring about these experiences than in how others might react, Tan- trics are unapologetic, preferring secrecy to explanation. The historical record indicates that calling someone a "Tantric" or calling oneself a "Tantrika" has always had political repercussions (San- derson 1985). Few contemporary Hindus are aware of the pervasiveness of Tantric elements in ideologies and practices that are commonplace in Hindu temple rituals, personal devotions, and yoga. They would not ordinarily call these things "Tantrika" (Padoux 1981:350). Many anti- Tantric Hindus would say commonplace Tantric practices have no rela- tionship to anything "Tantric." Believing their methods to be dangerous for the uninitiated and pre- occupied as they are with their own notions of religious virtuosity, Tan- trics prevent those who are uninvited or merely curious from gaining entry into their traditions by the use of highly technical and sometimes deliberately impenetrable idioms. In addition, direct transmission of teachings from a guru is considered a sine qua non for any practice. As a consequence, the few things that non-initiate Hindus usually know about Tantrics, and that Tantrics might discuss with outsiders, are often superficial, piecemeal, or taken out of context. What almost everyone does seem to know is that Tantrics do things that self-respecting Hindus do not. A few important exceptions notwithstanding (Parry; Gupta), aca- demic efforts to study Tantrism have concentrated on textual and histor- ical issues, accompanied by the usual disclaimers about the indispensable role oral and living traditions play in the interpretation of esoteric ideology and secret ritual. Studying Tantrism purely as a canon- ical religion can resolve definitional problems: Tantric tradition can be reduced to books written in Sanskrit and practiced as prescribed. How- ever, text-only studies can only mention oral interpretive components and the roles individual gurus play in shaping the religious lives of prac- titioners. To engage the guru tradition and consider the enormous range</page><page sequence="3">Brooks: Tantrism in South India 407 of ritual interpretations requires fieldwork with individuals and groups who may not welcome the uninitiated or may be sworn to secrecy by oaths to lineage traditions. Fieldwork studies are therefore limited not only to the expertise of the researcher but by the conditions set forth within the tradition. While recent efforts have begun to break through the barriers of Tantric texts to map beliefs and practices, textual study alone cannot address certain important aspects of ritual interpretation or explain Tantrism within the broader matrix of Hindu society. These issues demand the study of living Tantrics, limitations notwithstanding.2 This study focuses on a living Tantric tradition practiced within a particular social and religious community in which being called a "Tan- tric" is anything but a compliment. Despite disavowals and disclaimers, this unambiguous Tantric tradition, rooted in canon and steeped in oral interpretive lore, has flourished in high-caste south Indian Hindu circles since at least the ninth century and continues to be an important force today.3 This situation raises important questions about religious identity and identification as well as about the invention of the "other" in con- temporary Hinduism. WHO IS A HINDU TANTRIC? During several fieldwork stints in south India in the 1980s, the fig- ure most frequently cited as an example of the "typical" Tantric was the late Bhagawan Shri Rajneesh. Often recalling him standing before a row of Rolls-Royces or surrounded by doting western female disciples, my informants' mixture of outrage and envy was directed at a caricature of degeneration whose behavior was deemed insulting to all that is good and noble in Hinduism. As one put it, because "Rajneesh is a Tantric," he is "not Hindu at all." Curiously, Rajneesh might himself have agreed. Born into a Jain family and explicit in his rejection of any traditional religious affiliations with his teachings, Rajneesh taught a brand of "guruism" that drew on a number of Indian and non-Indian elements. These facts notwithstand- ing, Rajneesh is remembered by my informants as the quintessential Tantric: interested in sex, the fulfillment of any and all desires, and 2This article is based on extensive fieldwork conducted in Tamilnadu between 1983 and 1989 under the auspices of a Fulbright Fellowship and several research grants from the University of Rochester. 31 have in mind the important attribution of certain Tantric works of the SrividyA tradition to Saiikara and the likelihood that these were composed at about this time by persons associated with the Safikara centers (matha) of Kaficipuram and Srfigeri.</page><page sequence="4">408 Journal of the American Academy of Religion ultimately in power. The most important point, from our standpoint, was their univocal agreement that because Rajneesh was "Tantric" he was "not Hindu," implying a condemnation of all Tantrics. Tantrism was not viewed as an alternative religion in the sense that one might be a Christian or a Muslim; to be a "Tantric" was to be irreligious. Since the majority of my informants were from a brahman caste, they were predisposed to regard all others, Hindu or otherwise, as religious and social inferiors. Tantrics, in particular, were to be condemned en masse; in the long course of Hindu religious history, they assured me, there were probably not too many "good" Tantrics. Indian Muslims or Chris- tians with whom I spoke likewise mentioned Rajneesh as a "typical Tantric" and saw his excesses as reflecting poorly on India. They were sometimes inclined to assign blame to Hinduism for permitting such teachings. Only Hindus took Rajneesh and other "Tantrics" as person- ally insulting and thought it important to distance themselves religiously, morally, and socially. SOUTH INDIAN BRAHMANS AND OTHERNESS WITHIN For my deeply religious Hindu informants, Rajneesh and his Tantric ilk were a personal affront that provided them an opportunity to assert difference, and perhaps the possibility of reflecting on an otherness within (Green:50). Were there no Rajneesh, my informants would have probably invented someone like him: their moral posturing demanded an "immoral other." The dichotomy of We/Not-Tantric and They/Tantric-leaving aside the possibility of its being an imaginary distinction--created for them a situation of proximate otherness. In such situations difference becomes problematic because "they" are both "too-much-like-us" and "not-enough-like-us" (Smith). The others' dif- ference becomes too close for comfort. In this case, They/Tantrics must not be confused with We/Not-Tantric Hindus. Were there no perceived threat of Tantrics at all within Hinduism the Tantrics' remote otherness would have lowered the stakes; interests would not have been threatened and emotions would have been less visceral. But there are further ambiguities regarding Tantricism that these urban-dwelling, high-caste south Indians feel compelled to explain. Recently billboards in major Indian cities and in national magazines have advertised the services of "sex doctors," who sometimes refer to themselves as Tantrics. Asserting their curative powers over impotence or marital disharmony, these shirt-and-tie Tantrics address social problems by linking themselves to popular religious, medical, and occult</page><page sequence="5">Brooks. Tantrism in South India 409 beliefs. In this situation a "Tantric" appellation suggests an ambivalent place within Hindu society, albeit somewhere on the safe periphery. While my informants "had heard of people," including "some rela- tives," who had visited these self-proclaimed "Tantric sex doctors" under very extraordinary circumstances, none of them would have wel- comed unsolicited house calls. In all the situations so far described my informants treated "Tan- trics" as distinct others whose views and practices required explanation precisely because "they" were not "us." There is, however, another, more complex Tantrism living within the high-caste community in south India. This sort of Tantrism is neither an exotic othemess too remote to be of interest nor is it, properly speaking, a proximate other- ness. Rather, this often-denied Tantrism represents the other-living- among-us or the other-who-is-in-part-us. This situation suggests a notion of "otherness within," one in which two or more conflicting interests are located in the same individual or group.4 William Scott Green, discussing the "other" in rabbinic Judaism, describes the stakes involved when examining the "otherness within" a given society: To evoke the significant disparity of which otherness is composed, the symbol must correspond powerfully to the naming society's sense of its own distinctiveness ... To be revealing and meaningful, it must reach inside the culture of the people who employ it, correlate to some piece of themselves that they believe prominently displays who they are, and induce response, perhaps fear or disgust, but also perhaps envy or respect. (50) An "otherness within" the community of south Indian, Tamil- speaking brahmans that "correlates to some piece of themselves" pits their clannish traditions of brahmanism against Srividy&amp;, a type of god- dess-centered or Sakta Tantrism. In this context traditional brahmanism refers to a specific social group bound together by caste and to a distinc- tive textual community, one in which there is not necessarily doctrinal confession but a shared devotion to an authoritative set of texts (Green:53). South Indian Srividya can be circumscribed similarly. Important within brahman communities from at least the ninth century (Goudriaan; Brooks 1992), Srividy&amp; in contemporary south India has 4Jonathan Z. Smith has noted that when such situations arise, a strategy for interpreting difference is invoked; such difference is negotiated, manipulated, or self-consciously ignored. He writes, "Dif- ference is rarely something simply to be noted; it is, most often, something in which one has a stake. Above all, it is a political matter" (4).</page><page sequence="6">410 Journal of the American Academy of Religion quasi-public visibility; it has assimilated local goddess traditions and legitimized itself by association with important religious leaders past and present.5 There is little scholarly dispute about whether Srividya is a canonical Tantric goddess tradition or about its domination by brahmans from its earliest appearances in south India. The majority of south Indian brahmans who enlist in Srividy&amp; call themselves by their Tamil caste name "aiyar" (Sanskrit drya). They are also among those who claim to be authoritative arbiters of the meaning of the Vedas.6 In fact, the "Vedic tradition" of these particular brahmans is not derived explicitly from Vedic revelation (nruti) but from later ritual and legal texts known as smrtis which, to put it literally, "recollect" or bring "remembrance" of the Veda. It is the smrti texts- not Vedic revelation (Uruti)-that these brahmans use to explain the complexities of caste relations and the prescriptions of "orthodox" law (dharma), culture, custom, and morality.7 Acknowledging their reliance on this canon, these brahmans refer to themselves as smdrtas or "fol- lowers of the smrtis."8 Sm^rta brahmans define themselves canonically as those who follow smrtis rather than Tantras, and in terms of their obligation to fulfill spe- cific ritual and social duties (dharma). This contrasts with the view of the Tantras which they interpret as a quest for power (Uakti) and libera- tion from rebirth (mukti) (Hopkins). Throughout India, smdrta tradi- tions can be identified not only by their advocacy of particular canonical and ritual traditions but also as identifiable endogamous castes and sub- castes (Singer).9 In contemporary urban Tamilnadu a significant number within the 5These particular associations will be taken up later in more, detail. I have in mind the relation- ship linking Srividya to the Safikaracaryas of Kaficipuram and Srfigeri and, more recently, to the late sage of Tiruvanamalai, Ramanamaharishi. 6For a discussion of the relations between brahman castes see Singer; for a discussion of the relationship of smartas with temple priests (so-called adidaivas) and other "priestly castes," see Fuller. 7Sources outlining brahman traditions are too numerous to list. For an excellent summary see J.C. Heesterman (1987). 8Whether the models and codes set forth in the smrtis are instantiated and empirically observable is not at issue. Rather, our interest lies in how the ideological positions set forth in the smrtis provide a basis for social identity that distinguishes this group of Hindus from others, including Tantrics. 9When identifying "smarta tradition" we should be careful not to divorce ideological principles and traditions of ritual behavior from social facts; but neither should we mistakenly believe that textual traditions and community practices are isomorphic. Canonical prescriptions alone may not prove sufficient criteria upon which to identify smarta traditions or communities. Rather,one must couple historical and textual studies of custom and rite with anthropological studies of interpreta- tion and practice. As we shall see, the same is true of Tantric traditions and practices.</page><page sequence="7">Brooks. Tantrism in South India 411 smarta community are deeply involved in Trantric Srividya. The major- ity of these Srividy&amp; practitioners are no more likely to relish being called "Tantrics" than most Episcopalians would identify themselves as charismatics who have spoken in tongues in witness of the Holy Ghost.'o Only a few virtuosi of both sm&amp;rta and Tantric canons might grudgingly agree that Srividya is part of the goddess-centered Tantric tradition. Brahman suspicions of things "Tantric" are not new but rather a part of an on-going historical encounter of Hindu otherness within. The "otherness within" the smarta brahman Tantric provides yet another example of "how cultures, perfectly commonsensical from within, nevertheless flirt with their own 'alternities,' gain critical self- distance, formulate complex (rather than simply reactionary) perspec- tives on others, embrace negativities, confront (even admire) what they themselves are not" (Boon:232). To proceed with the inquiry we will need to create both a theoretical paradigm for understanding this inter- mingling of religious "others" and a description of how incommensu- rate ideologies and conflicting ethical values are negotiated within this distinctive social and religious group. THEORETICAL PARADIGMS OF POWER AND TANTRIC AND NON-TANTRIC HINDUISMS The brahmans' description of the Tantric as obsessed with, power (Uakti) is one way we might cast Rajneesh, the sex doctors, and Srividya practitioners in the role of "Tantrics." Neither Tantric texts nor practi- tioners would dispute their interest is power, or .akti, which they con- sider the godhead's most important feature, the underlying essence of the created universe, and the adept's practical goal. As Madeleine Biardeau has said, in Hindu Tantrism power is acquired through the effort "to place kdma-desire-in every sense of the term, in the service of deliverance ... not to sacrifice this world to deliverance, but to reinte- grate it in one way or another within the perspective of salvation" (Padoux 1981:351). Consequently, "the quest for liberation is funda- mentally nothing but a tapping, a using, or even a manipulating of ... power" conceived to be divine in origin, female in form, and accessible to human beings through specific mental and physical activities, espe- 10The fact that a handful of Hindus and Episcopalians would call themselves "Tintrika" or "char- ismatic" and that this causes others who call themselves "Hindus" or "Episcopalians" to become uncomfortable is precisely the point.</page><page sequence="8">412 Journal of the American Academy of Religion cially ritual (Padoux 1981:351). The universe, according to Hindu Tant- rism, is nothing but power (Uakti), which is creation's material and efficient cause and its imminent and transcendent form. In principle and practice, Hindu Tantrism does not separate ideolog- ical positions about power (gakti) from the practical means by which one acquires it. Power manifests as knowledge Q(iina), desire (iccha), and activity (kriya), all of which must be transmitted through a guru and appropriated through precise ritual actions and yogic practices. Obtaining knowledge, working one's will, or acting powerfully is, in some sense, to become divine. Ritual is the forum in which these ideo- logical commitments are expressed. To be powerful is, in part, to have possession of rituals that confer divinity or create access to the godhead. To put it concretely, powerful people can fulfill their desires. In Srividyg Tantrism the adept assumes the form of the divine by identifying with the godhead's manifestations, particularly in images and icons, sound formulae (mantra), and cosmic diagrams (yantra) which are then ritually identified with one's body, speech, and intellect. The guru, as the dispenser of initiate knowledge, is likewise identified as a divine embodiment and an incontrovertible authority who both inter- prets and stands for tradition." Hindu Tantric traditions agree that obtaining power requires extraordinary means that must be kept from all but the few qualified for initiation (di'kd). In this regard, Tantrism is a classic esotericism in which the purpose of initiation "is to regenerate consciousness through the reappropriation of primal knowledge that was lost . . . [O]nce attained, this knowledge makes possible a new experience in our rela- tions with the sacred and the universe" (Faivre:39). Since knowledge for Tantrics is a species of power, it is considered dangerous in the wrong hands. The Tantras promise the ability to control and manipu- late society, nature, and the cosmos in toto. Access to power is restricted by encoding teachings in esoteric langauge and by binding empower- ment to guru initiation. As one Tantra says: "The fool who, overpow- ered by greed, acts after having looked up [the matter] in a written book without having obtained it from the guru's mouth, he also will certainly be destroyed" (Goudriaan:12). 11Though power (gakti) is female in essence and divine in form, one need not be female to obtain it or even focus one's theology on the goddess. One will, however, necessarily require access to the divine feminine principles, the Sakti through which one makes power personal. All Hindu Tan- trics, including those theologically centered on masculine deities, notice that knowledge (vidyd), desire (icchd), and action (krya^) are feminine by definition, grammatically and ideologically, and that power (gakti) is likewise preeminently manifest in goddess images.</page><page sequence="9">Brooks. Tantrism in South India 413 Tantric texts, however, often adopt the more inclusive position of a dual norm in which one might be involved in both a Tantric discipline and other forms of religious practice. Thus in contrast to smdrta brahmanism, which sees itself as incommensurate with Tantrism, Tan- tric traditions, such as Srividya, take a different approach and prefer to remove competition between disciplines, seeing each practice within its own sphere. One reason many reject the Tantric's quest for power is its connec- tion with sexual imagery or relations with taboo substances, such as alcohol and non-vegetarian foods. The link between power--defined broadly as the godlike capacity to influence, sustain, or transform one- self or others-and things taboo proves especially problematic to tradi- tional brahmans.12 Certainly Tantrics are not the only Hindus for whom eroticism and taboo (or exaggerated) behaviors are important for obtaining or projecting power. Yet some choose to seek power without theuse of controversial images or convention-defying ideas. A minority of Sri^vidya's historical commentators have championed so-called "right- handed" practices (daksin.accra) that deemphasize the erotic and antino- mian elements of Tantrism without disavowing Tantric roots and reli- ance on the Tantric canon. Some contemporary brahman Srividya practitioners go so far as to disavow all breaches of religious convention, including the universal Tantric dogma that caste and gender are not primafacie criteria upon which to disqualify a potential initiate. For the arch-conservatives, Srividy should be dissociated from anything that questions caste hierarchies, promotes caste mixing, or places women in roles of ritual virtuosity.13 12Among Bengalis and certain other north Indians the term "Tantra" or "Tintrika" is not neces- sarily used pejoratively (Padoux 1981:350; Gupta). In Indian languages "Tantra" is used to refer to texts and sometimes the phenomenon that western scholars have called "Tantrism." "Tantrism" as an imaginary category of the analytic imagination is described and defined in fairly consistent terms. See Goudriaan; Padoux; Bharati; and Brooks for general scholarly definitions and methods of classification. "Tintrika" or, as it appears here in the westernized spelling "Tantric," is an adjective. Tantrics often define power in terms of controlled violations of brahman-defined conventional- ity and view these acts as means of transcending mundane rules that apply only to the spiritually inferior. A closer look at the texts, ideologies, classified as "Tantrism" will bear out only some of the associations that cause Tantrics disrepute or render them morally suspect (e.g., Padoux:1981 and 1987; Goudriaan; Brooks:1990). This fact, however, does not mitigate the importance of the perception of being "other." Tantrics may not actually say or do anything deemed objectionable; it is enough that they call themselves or are called "Tantric." 13This position should be contrasted with the view of the fifteenth-century conservative Laksmidhara who is considered by these practitioners their standardbearer. Laksmidhara states clearly in his commentary to v. 11 of Saundaryalahart that "even outcastes (~2dra)" are fit for Srividyi. Conservatives who would reject that interpretation state that Laksmidhara does not mean</page><page sequence="10">414 Journal of the American Academy of Religion While the majority of contemporary brahman Srividya practitioners in south India do not accept such rigid interpretations, neither are they about to flaunt their defiance of high-caste conventions. The language they use to describe themselves and their practices is not a trivial matter. Even for liberal brahmans, the term "Tantric" is more an accusation than a description. The repercussions of rejecting social conventions, espousing esotericism, and endorsing behaviors that are possible but not acceptable threaten and deter those who wish to retain mainstream caste identity. Brahman practitioners of Srividya are quick to assert that every- thing they do is "sanctioned by Vedas" and therefore unobjectionable to the orthodox. This theological justification serves an important func- tion, since it permits Srividya practitioners to assert their difference from (and implicit superiority over) other brahmans while affirming the view that nothing, they do is deliberately anti-brahman. Tantric Srividya's important role within the smdrta brahman com- munity, despite canonical objections, requires explanation. Why did some members of this community embrace a religious discipline that in some measure subverts or defies their own long-established prerogatives in this sphere of Hindu life? We have provided at least a part of the answer already: Tantrism, which promises empowerment in both mate- rial and spiritual realms, can be worth the risks it might entail. Classical Hinduism has always admitted that human beings can achieve rare and wondrous powers, and its traditional position of augmenting rather than supplanting non-competing practices offers brahman practitioners yet another means by which to assert their religious claims of superiority from within the caste community. SMARTA BRAHMANS AND SRIVIDYA TANTRICS IN SOUTH INDIA South Indian Srividya takes on a distinctive flavor by identifying itself with Vedic teachings and mantras, and by seeking to establish Srividya as the secret (rahasya) meaning of the Veda (Venkataraman). Particularly noteworthy is Srividya's relationship with the legacy of the non-dualist or advaita Vedanta theologian Safikara (c. 750, C.E.), who is attributed authorship of several important Srividya texts (Brooks 1987; Khanna; Brown).'4 Sm rta brahmans in Tamilnadu not only align to include these low-born persons (or women) within Srividya lineages comprised of twice-born (dvija) brahman males. 14Curiously, those texts most scholars argue to be authentic works of the eighth-century Safikara</page><page sequence="11">Brooks: Tantrism in South India 415 themselves with the Shfikara tradition and imagine themselves the defenders of the Vedic traditions, they enforce caste rules rigorously, especially in matters of purity and pollution.15 Most of the Srividya practitioners with whom I had contact were from sma^rta families located in Madurai, Madras, or nearby cities in Tamilnadu. They thought of themselves as traditional and, as one put it, "forward-looking" Hindus; they were literate in Tamil but only occa- sionally in English, and considered Sanskrit the language for ritual and devotion. For most religious and social events they chose to remain strictly within caste boundaries, especially with regard to commensality, marriage, and other comparable activities. Of particular importance to them was their strict vegetarian diet, equally rigorous teetotalling, and exhibit no interest in goddess worship or Tantra. Some scholars have argued forcefully that Safikara was a Visnu worshiper (Hacker:1947). Texts believed to be authentic works of Safikara suggest that he was hostile to Saktas and to groups usually associated with Tantrism, such as the Saiva Pasupatas and skull-bearing Kapilikas (Hacker 1968-69; Ingalls 1954). While Safikara likely had important ties to Yoga traditions, he was certainly no Thntrika (Hacker 1968-69). Nonetheless, the Sfikara tradition from at least the tenth century seems committed to an amalgam of Siva- centered worship and Sakta Tantric Srividyi, and to align itself with the communal interests of sm3rta brahmanism (Goudriaan). Tamil sma^rta brahmans, at least in recent times, hold a particular allegiance to the Safikara traditions located in the matha s or holy seats in Kaficipuram and Srfigeri (Singer; Fuller). The head of each matha, who holds the title "Safikaricirya, few would wish to defy publicly. The Sifikara matha in Kaficipuram maintains control of the goddess temple dedicated to Kimiksi, a figure who resembles the Srividya cult's goddess Laliti Tripurasundari in nearly every respect. Kamaksi also includes before her permanent image inside the temple a rtfcakra, the princi- ple diagrammatic representation (yantra) of the supreme Sakti, which remains under Srividyi's special ritual purview. The unambiguous identification of the goddess Kimaksi with Srividyi's grfcakra reifies the theological relationship between the traditions of the Safikara matha and the Tantric cult responsible for creating and interpreting this particular form of goddess worship. Fur- ther, the Safikara tradition's sanction of ritual elements that superficially bear the marks of Tantric Srividya has led smarrtas to claim the goddess cult as their own. Though the connections between Safikara traditions, sma^rta brahmans, and Srividya may not be traceable to the eighth-century Safikara, they have formed a powerful triad of historical and ideological connections. The alliance has also furthered the notion that non-dualist Vedinta, orthoprax brahmanism, and smanrta Tantric Srividya are essentially part of a single tradition. In fact, the interests of these distinctive ideological and practical non-Tantric and Tantric traditions do not always coincide. We will need, however, to distinguish between theoretical and ideological conflicts and those which become part of the com- munity's self-consciousness. 15Sma^rtas distribute their daily worship among the five gods (paiicayatana devata, i.e., Siva, Visnu, Silrya, Ganesa, and Devi the goddess) though, unlike the staunchly sectarian Vaisnava brahmans known as aoyangars, they pride themselves on their willingness to accept nearly the entire pantheon of divinities. They are generally not responsible for conducting temple rituals, a task they delegate to others and which they consider inferior because of potential contact with impurities (Fuller). They retain complicated rules of kinship between sub-castes, pursue either professional religious (vaidikas) or worldly (laukikas) professions, and maintain a full calendar of religious and social events that preoccupy them in different roles as individuals, family members, and within the larger smrarta community. Though temple-going is not required there is no dearth of piety, which finds its primary locus in the home at the family shrine.</page><page sequence="12">416 Journal of the American Academy of Religion condemnation of sexual relations before or outside of marriage. Tradi- tional views about women were also still largely endorsed even when they were not followed. Widows were not to remarry, though few would nowadays be required to follow the old tradition of donning a saffron sari and shaving their hair as a penance for their husbands hav- ing predeceased them. Almost all marriages were arranged, though occasionally college-educated children were able to impose their own choices on parents, provided the rules of caste and sub-caste (gotra) were upheld. Marrying out-of-caste is still rare, the consequences of which can be socially ostracizing. They acknowledged no other castes to be superior, though they were willing to concede that aiyangar and mcdhva Vaisnavas are also considered brahmans in Tamil country. They did not frequently mix with "other" brahmans but were willing to attend social occasions with persons of other castes provided they were of comparable economic stature. They were insistent on sending their children to secular schools and universities, hoping to land them seats in "preferred courses," such as medicine or engineering; few would wish to send a child to a traditional school for religious training. Only the poorest families or those with strong ties to particular religious schools, they thought, would consign their sons to lives of certain poverty. While smdrtas are thought of as primarily Siva worshippers, many concentrate their devotions on the goddess. These devotees tend to be focused either on local deities, such as Minaksi of Madurai, or on Srividya's all-embracing goddess in triadic form, beginning with the physical (sthila) form of the benign and beneficent mother known as either Lalita Tripurasundari or Rajarajesvari. In south India the Divine Mother is identified with comparably benign (saumya) goddesses of temple fame, such as Kamaksi of Kaficipuram or Akhilandesvari of Trichy (Brooks 1990:99); a similar series of identifications occurs in Kashmir (Sanderson 1987). Local goddesses favored by brahmans might at some level be considered identical to Lalit Tripurasundari, even when they do not resemble her physically in (any or) every respect. This identification is reinforced by the popular recitation of Lalita's Thousand Names (Lalitdsahasrandma), a Sanskrit text which smarta s often know by heart and recite before the images of their favorite goddess. At the level above the anthropomorphic image in Srividy 's pan- theon is the supreme goddess's subtle (sAksma) form as the mantra called the grividyd, and above the mantra, at the transcendent or supreme (para) level, the diagrammatic ?rtcakra. The grfcakra, formed by the</page><page sequence="13">Brooks. Tantrism in South India 417 intersection of nine triangles surrounded by lotus petals and lines is, as Goudriaan has said, likely the most famous visual image in all Hindu Tantrism (Goudriaan). This particular triad of goddess manifestations, and especially the ?rfcakra image, preoccupy Srividya texts and define the more limited scope of the cult's ritual interests. One would not necessarily know from simple observation that Srividya is a significant part of the ritual and theological lives of Tamil smartas. For example, Milton Singer in his extensive and important study of urban Madras smarta s, never mentions the Safikara tradition's relationship with goddess worship or Srividya's triadic conception of divinity and its place in the ritual tradition (Singer). In fact, most smarta practitioners prefer to adom their foreheads with holy ash (vibhuti) sig- nifying their devotion to Siva, distinguishing themselves from Visnu- centered brahmans.16 Few make a point of displaying devotion to Srividya. With only a few exceptions, the vast majority of Srividya texts and historical commentators shamelessly advocate the rituals and ideologies that cause modem brahmans to despise Tantrics.'7 When prescriptive conflicts between brahmanical and Tantric obligations or teachings appear, most contemporary practitioners seek ways to distribute author- ity such that the two traditions are seen as part of a seamless whole. This application of the dual norm is hardly innovative (Goudriaan). In certain situations, however, this dichotomous principle, which must compartmentalize Vedic and Tantric theologies and rituals in order to secure co-existence, shows signs of stress. Put simply, how can self- respecting orthoprax brahmans associate themselves with Tantric ideol- 16As noted, Tamil smd2rtas pride themselves on their religious "liberality," defined, as it were, by their perception of other Tamil brahmans, particularly aiangars, as rigid and haughty. For exam- ple, several sma^rta families with whom I was well-acquainted were ardent devotees of Rima, the avatdra of Visnu of Rdmayana fame. Others were focused on regional gods such as Murugan, who is of particular importance in Tamilnadu but whom sma^rtas prefer to call by Sanskrit names such as Subrahmanya or Shanmugam. For smairtas there is no conflict of interest suggested by preferring one divinity over another; one would only eschew gods to whom non-vegetarian offerings or blood sacrifices might be regularly made. '7The dominant branch of historical Srividya locates itself squarely within the larger movement it terms "Kaula Tantrism," which it identifies not as a particular canon of texts but in more general terms as the so-called "left-current" (vamacc2ra), in which convention-defying behaviors are recom- mended for literal ritual practice. While it is true that south India also produced the arch-conserva- tive "right-current" (daksindcc3ra) or Samayacara, which rejected anything objectionable to traditional brahman sensibilities, these texts and commentators are not the most important or influ- ential among contemporary smarta Srividya adepts. Most contemporary ritual handbooks (pad- dhati)-nearly all of which were compiled by smarta brahmans-mention the use of the five m's and other anti-brahmanical elements as a matter of course ("Anna").</page><page sequence="14">418 Journal of the American Academy of Religion ogies and ritual practices that would cause them to violate their most cherished communal principles of ethical behavior and religious propri- ety? As I will show, there is no dual norm in practice that asserts the viability of two distinct traditions. Rather, there is a single, embracing norm characterized by its otherness within. Historical texts and reports are inconclusive inasmuch as it is impos- sible to know if textual prescriptions and endorsements were actually practiced and what impact these might have had on the brahman com- munity. A more compelling case is offered by contemporary brahmans in south India whose words and deeds can be compared. CIDANANDA MANDALI'S ANNUAL PUJA IN MADRAS The Ciddnanda Mandali or "Circle of Cidananda" is a Srividya line- age centered in Madras that claims descent from a well-known Srividya guru whose initiate name (dfksdndma) was Cidanandanatha. Cida- nanda, whose given name was Subrahmanya Aiyar, lived and worked in Madras during the first half of the twentieth century. He was a Tamil aiyar smdrta brahman who enjoyed an unblemished reputation in the community of the orthopax as a leamrned authority on Vedic and Srividya rites. Cidananda's enduring influence stems from the large number of publications his group sponsored during his lifetime, including several important translations and commentaries. While publication of secret (rahasya) texts is itself a curious occupation for a Tantric lineage, Cida- nanda himself saw it as an act of devotion performed in honor of his own learned teacher. With Cidananda's passing in the early 1970s, his followers took up his mission and now constitute one of the most active and important forces in south Indian Srividya. Cidananda's works are continually, referred to by contemporary practitioners as authoritative sources of Srividya tradition, often substi- tuting for the primary works on which they are based. For example, Cidananda's partial translation and commentary in Tamil of the thir- teenth century Kdmakaldvildsa of Punyananda and the influential Secret of Worship (Varivasydrahasya) by the eighteenth-century Bhaskararaya have become so popular that one hardly sees other editions, including the Sanskrit originals. This is not surprising considering that most prac- titioners use Sanskrit only for ritual purposes and have limited compre- hension of complex commentarial traditions of discourse. Contemporary practitioners acknowledge that their limited abilities in Sanskrit have deprived them of further access to canonical learning. For them, Cidananda's efforts have served a particularly important purpose:</page><page sequence="15">Brooks: Tantrism in South India 419 difficult and often-mentioned interpretive works are now accessible in vernacular translations. In addition, Cidananda made available a series of ritual handbooks (paddhati) offering practical instruction in Srividya worship, especially the worship of the rficakra and "related mantra sci- ence" (mantrardstra). While other lineages and gurus have undertaken similar projects, Cidananda's is noteworthy for its ubiquity in common book stalls, especially those near large Siva/goddess temples in Tamilnadu. Cidananda's mark on twentieth-century Srividya in Tamilnadu seems secure; wherever I travelled, Srividya practitioners knew his work and praised his efforts even when they did not descend through his line- age or necessarily agree with his interpretations. In more recent times, however, his disciples have not been so unified. A number of individu- als and groups claim to represent his interests, each asserting that they received the guru's empowering blessing ( aktipdda). Such competing claims are hardly new in the history of south Indian Srividy&amp;.18 The majority of this particular group, however, seem to agree that Cid&amp;- nanda's legacy has fallen into the hands of one Padminanda, an elderly smcrta from Madras who was a direct disciple.'9 In his writings Cidananda makes clear his preference for the most convention-defying practices of Tantric Srividya. He strenuously upheld three principles to which most smanrta s would object. His disciples have been left to explain these seemingly anti-brahmanical endorsements. First, Cidinanda openly espoused the literal practice of the so-called "five m's"-meat (mamrsa), fish (matsya), wine (madya), fermented grain (mudrd), and sexual intercourse (maithuna)-as part of SrividyA rituals. Rumors abound over whether he literally employed the "five m's" or adopted the more amicable solution of using "harmless" ritual substitutes (pratinidhi), such as milk mixed with honey in place of wine and a symbolic form of sexual intercourse. As we shall see in the evi- dence of Cidinanda's contemporary disciples, the difference between saying and doing, and between literal and symbolic forms of ritual action, remain crucial variables in the potentially volatile mix of Tantric Srividy&amp; and smanrta brahmanism. Second, Cidinanda endorsed the Tantric notion that women and 18The famous controversy between the nineteenth-century commentator Rimesvara SUiri and his predecessor Uminandanktha over the right to represent the interpretations of the authoritative Bhaskararaya offers an important historical example. See Brooks 1987 and 1992 for details of the dispute. 19Padmananda, also known as K. Ramamurti, died in 1988.</page><page sequence="16">420 Journal of the American Academy of Religion non-brahmans, including outcastes and "barbarian" non-Indians (mleccha) could qualify for Srividy&amp; initiation provided they met the stringent spiritual requirements of the tradition. While this might not seem particularly problematic, such initiations would require brahmans and non-brahmans to conduct rituals together, share in food offerings, and have close contact at religious as well as social events. The poten- tial exposure to impurity seems dangerous to most smarta s, who would especially eschew the sharing of cooked foods with non-brahmans or the risk of coming into contact with women who do not observe the rules involving states of temporary impurity, such as menstruation. Once again, Tantric and smdrta community values require negotiation on the part of those who would affirm both. In the practical meeting of these traditions the Tantric ritual does not become a force for religious unity or social egalitarianism across caste and gender lines, but rather a force for further articulation of caste bias and a means of mobilizing smdrta social and political identity. Tantric ideology is not ignored, but neither can it sublate the powerful social forces that bind the textual and social community of Tamil brahmans. Cidananda's third Tantric principle takes us directly to our case study. Unlike conservative "right-handed" Tantrics, Cidinanda belongs to the segment of Srividy&amp; that maintains that ritual must retain external components. In other words, ritual cannot be reduced to purely con- templative acts performed with imaginary elements. Rather, physical elements and actions should remain present even as they become more significant symbolically and "internally." Like his important intellectual predecessor, the eighteenth-century intellectual Bhaskararaya, Cid&amp;- nanda argued that external ritual acts provide examples of commitment that influence others and remain crucial to the maintenance of one's own discipline.20 As one adept put it, "In Srividya it is relatively easy to obtain powers (siddhi), but it is easy to fall without diligent practice. We should, as Krsna says in the Bhagavadgfta, continue to act as the ignorant act so that we do not create a poor example.21 Cidinanda also held the not uncommon view that ritual practices should remain secret (rahasya) and therefore must be conducted in total privacy. This position provided cover for those who endorse texts pre- scribing the use of convention-defying elements or who wish to remain 20The ritual distinction is known technically as external (bahir) and internal (antaryaga). The so- called Samaya tradition advocates the complete abdication of external rites in favor of mental con- templation. See Brooks 1992 and Khanna for details. 21This position is endorsed by no less a canonical authority than Bhiskararaya.</page><page sequence="17">Brooks: Tantrism in South India 421 anonymous. Further, it agrees with the general tendency among Tan- trics to take a dim view of the use of ritual substitutes (pratinidhi) that merely symbolize transgression of conventionality.22 Tantric ritual, as a means of obtaining Tantric power, prefers tangible and this-worldly evi- dence to validate experience. Cidinanda's publishing activities and his disciples' initiative to organize semi-public ritual events have taken the notion of obligatory external rites in a new direction. While it seems clear that traditionalists understood that their written works would reach beyond the circle of initiates, such materials were still kept largely in private hands. With the advent of print technology and the introduction of formal manu- script libraries, the complexion of contemporary Tantrism has been rad- ically changed.23 Since Cidananda's efforts began in the early 1930s, Srividya has taken on an increasingly public image with a number of individuals and groups sponsoring public rituals, publishing "souvenir" pamphlets paid for by commercial advertisers and well-wishers, and undertaking larger projects including lineage events and government-registered educational societies. Books written by other lineage adepts who make explicit their efforts to evangelize the tradition now complement the shelves of south India book shops that carry Cidinanda's works. These projects have effectively turned individuals and groups involved in Srividy&amp; into public institutions.24 Such public activities are usually explained within lineages as an extension of the mandate to provide an example for others and as a means by which to extend the grace of the goddess to which Srividya adepts claim privileged access. Cidananda's disciples, especially under the recent leadership of Padminanda, are aware that Tantric texts never suggest or endorse teaching those beyond initiated ranks. However, Padmananda made a point of saying that such public efforts were part of Srividya's self-conferred privilege as the goddess' chosen elite to empower others "to the limit of their abilities." He went on to say, "Do you think I do this for my own benefit? No. It is for the sake of the world that we were given this great and powerful discipline (s&amp;dhana)." The notion of performing rituals for the sake of others and inviting 22Cf. Bhiskararaya's remarks in his commentary on Tripuropanisad 23This situation is not unique either to Srividya Tantrism or to India, as Jack Goody has shown in his studies of African and other societies. 24Among Tamil sma^rtas such projects usually come with the explicit blessing of one of the Safikara pfthas.</page><page sequence="18">422 Journal of the American Academy of Religion others to have some type of participation has clear precedents in sma^rta tradition, where it is the brahman's duty (dharma) to perform important rituals for others. When confronted with the seeming incompatibility of injunctions that demand both action for the sake of the world (lokasam- graha) and the maintenance of secrecy, Padminanda stated that he saw no such conflict. In fact, both injunctions could be fulfilled simultane- ously. The lineage's public rituals would keep "secret" elements con- cealed, make them inaccessible to those without initiate knowledge by using ritual language, or leave certain controversial matters unexplained. In practice this meant that Padmananda did not go out of his way to describe everything that might be performed in a public forum. This method, he insisted, was the true meaning of acting for the world's wel- fare, as all the scriptures enjoined. To celebrate the life and work of Cidinanda, Padmananda and other key members of the Cidinanda Mandali organized, in January 1985, what they termed "the annual worship (puija^) of the guru and auspicious women (sumatigalt^ suvcsint)." After months of preparation, which included canvassing the smarta community in Madras for donations, the members of the lineage and their partners gathered in a rented hall with some 1200-1300 guests in attendance. Before the event Padmananda spoke both privately to me and publicly, in the latter case carefully tail- oring his comments to his smadrta brahman-only audience. First, Padmananda affirmed the importance of keeping "the great work of Cidinanda fresh in our hearts and minds." Privately, Padm&amp;- nanda wanted to assure me that no one in the Mandali was "as yet qualified" to employ the convention-defying elements of a full-fledged Tantric ritual, though learned members were quite aware of Cidinanda's unambiguous endorsement of these "Tantric practices." Instead, PadmAnanda said, "appropriate ritual substitutes" are regularly employed, thus offending no one by the overt practice of behaviors dis- approved by the larger brahman community. When I asked Padm&amp;- nanda about the fact that his ritual texts made clear mention of offerings and acts that many would find offensive, he responded by saying that most persons, including the ritualists themselves, were not fluent enough in Sanskrit to know such things were included; others did not see the mere mention of such things within the strict confines of ritual as problematic. "Only if we were to do these things would there be a problem," he said. In his public comments to the gathered assembly of initiates and non-initiates, Padmananda raised none of these ritual or ideological issues. The strategy of omission played a crucial role for Padminanda in his dealings with the non-initiate smarta community.</page><page sequence="19">Brooks: Tantrism in South India 423 To Padmananda and his fellow Mandali members, the ritual and liturgical world of Tantric mantras was not meant to threaten their brah- man social world, provided one took care to distinguish what is said from what is prescribed as an obligatory ritual action (nityakarma). Padminanda wanted nothing to do with "scandalous behavior" and was particularly aware of the need not to offend his benefactors. This policy, however, did not always please everyone involved, including Padm&amp;- nanda. When I pressed him about the absence of non-brahmans and the failure to fulfill his own guru's ritual injunctions (vidhi), Padma- nanda simply said that the times demanded "these accommodations, if the rituals are to be done at all. What is the greater good? That is how we decide." Padmananda's second stated objective was that Cidananda Mandali's activities should benefit the sma^rta community, which had a deep interest in religious works and events. By publishing inexpensive devotional pamphlets in Tamil and Sanskrit and by sponsoring events such as the Guru Pfij, Padminanda saw himself in the role of caste community servant. Smc~rtas in Tamilnadu are quick to point out that government policies of "reservation"-the Indian equivalent of "affirm- ative action"-are designed to privilege members of other castes in both public and private sectors. Urban middle-class smadrta s seem well aware that the privilege and power they once wielded in the extended Hindu community has dwindled, a point Singer noted nearly twenty years ago (Singer). Srividya's Tantric ritual, as Padmananda saw it, was not a means of breaking through or breaking down caste boundaries. Rather, Srividy&amp; was a tradition around which the community could reaffirm its position of religious leadership and gain access to divine power (Uakti), and blessings. The ritual's expense and the energies required to bring the commu- nity together were part of the Mandali's future equity, not an irrational expression of faith by a desperate and failing community. Seen in this light, the Mandali's work created what Pierre Bourdieu (1977) has called "symbolic capital." These social and material investments are made to secure future dividends through highly charged political acts; the drama of ritual becomes a particularly effective means by which to define the community's internal dynamics and its power structures.25 Thus, the Mandali directed its public efforts towards identifying this elaborate series of Srividya rituals as a smarta community event in which the 25I am indebted to William S. Sax for crystallizing this idea.</page><page sequence="20">424 Journal of the American Academy of Religion Mandali could assume a preeminent leadership role. To keep the focus on smdrta community interests, Padminanda made a point of requesting that I not mention any association between Srividy&amp; and the Tantrics when interviewing any of the Guru Pfija's attendees. For those left in the dark about Srividy&amp;'s Tantric heritage, the ritual did indeed create symbolic capital: Mandali members gained prestige and power by their religious virtuosity. Financing for the Guru Pfij came largely from small contributions received from families who planned to attend. Advertisements were placed in both English and Tamil newspapers soliciting attendance, money, and "well-wishers." The advertisements also mentioned the blessings of the SafikarAcarya of Kaficipuram, a religious leader held in considerable esteem by Tamil smartas. This endorsement not only brought legitimacy to the event for brahmans who had not heard of the group; it encoded the message that non-brahmans need not take an interest. The Saikara centers are well-known for their public advocacy of non-caste-based religion but privately for their brahman biases. PadmAnanda was never worried about the possibility that non- brahmans might wish to attend. There would be no non-brahmans with the exception of me, of course, he said, and non-brahmans would not respond to the advertisements. They would know quite well, or have it made known to them, that this was strictly a sma~rta affair. When asked if my own presence at the event would cause a prob- lem, he responded by saying that Srividy&amp; does not disqualify persons from participation on the basis of caste or gender-a curious position given his sense that "caste feelings" among sponsors had determined in advance that non-brahmans would not be welcome.26 I "was not like other foreigners." When I asked what this meant aside from my being an initiate, he said being a foreigner was "not the same as being Indian." Apparently among certain caste-conscious smdrta s, some wes- terners were beyond the immediate pale of caste considerations, so long as one demanded no special privilege nor sought too much intimacy. Padminanda also made it clear that he did not personally wish to exclude non-brahmans from attending the event but that its success would depend on remaining sensitive to the smdrta community's caste feelings. Without sm drta financial support there would be no Guru Piij&amp;; this prospect was unthinkable since it would be a dishonor to 26Padminanda had been told about my research and intentions to publish my findings, but he had also seen me only in traditional Tamil dress, speaking in Tamil, and had been introduced to me by an acquaintance as "a great Srividya authority."</page><page sequence="21">Brooks: Tantrism in South India 425 memory of the lineage's teacher. Further, Srividya, he reminded me, never said it was wrong for brahman initiates alone to worship together. "We are not excludirg them," he said, "but we are not inviting them." My questions about Srividya's Tantric ideals and the social realities of smcrta society clearly made Padmananda uncomfortable. He was at pains' to state his own private position that welcomed non-brahmans into Srividy&amp; while, at the same time, he remained politically savvy in his dealings with his natural constituency. The costs of inviting non- brahmans, as he saw it, were simply too high. On the day of the Mandali's Guru Pfij, only those who had made, or were planning to make donations, and only sma~rta s (and other brahmans) were in attendance. Informants who knew Padmananda well said that he was not known to socialize with non-brahmans and that they knew of no non-brahman initiates in the lineage of Cidananda. Padminanda's third reason for organizing the annual Mandali event was that it provided a "grand day for ladies," since the worship of Srividya's Lalit&amp; Tripurasundari would be largely performed by and directed towards the women in attendance. During the event Padma- nanda acted as a master of ceremonies but did not interfere in the course of ritual performances, which were entirely under the direction of senior female Mandali members. The Guru Pij&amp; was understood primarily as a community event for women (organized by men), especially married women whose husbands were living, that is, who were themselves aus- picious reflections of the goddess Lalita Tripurasundari. Most husbands did not attend, though there were apparently no explicit gender restric- tions. Men in attendance had very limited roles to play since they were neither active ritual participants nor the objects of ritual worship. In contrast, the women were waited upon obsequiously by unmarried and mostly prepubescent girls (usually daughters and friends' daughters) who functioned as the living goddess' attendants. PadmAnanda made a point of saying that the role women were play- ing in the ritual demonstrated how "Srividya does not discriminate; all are equal." (Viewed in the context of a conversation about "caste feel- ings," this seemed to be Padmananda's way of asserting his own liberal- ity). When I asked him if this extraordinary role for women was due to Srividy&amp;'s Tantric principles of non-gender discrimination, he responded defensively that Hindu rituals did not have to be "Tantric" to place women in roles ordinarily reserved for men. While Padmananda's observation was undoubtedly true, it is fair to say that the day's events were hardly a celebration of Hindu women's religious rights or their individual or group autonomy. Rather, the day's rituals were meant</page><page sequence="22">426 Journal of the American Academy of Religion largely as an affirmation of the traditional role of the sumarigalf, the ideal of the obedient wife and dutiful mother who embodies conservative social values. Though the event was a Guru Pija and included rituals directed towards the framed picture of Cidinanda, the guru was more a host than an object of worship. His chief guest was the goddess herself, Lalit&amp; Tripurasundari, whose presence was noted in several ways and in differ- ent degrees of embodiment. On a platform of the rented hall, an alter of icons and images had been established, the center of attention being a picture of the goddess Lalita Tripurasundari as "Queen of Kings" (Rajarajesvari) and before her a three-dimensional, metal irfcakra. Presiding over the ritual wor- ship of these objects was Laksmi, a well-known and respected woman whose daughters and grand-daughters were in attendance. Laksmi was considered especially auspicious for having had several sons, grandchil- dren, and a surviving, husband. She was also an accomplished ritualist (arcaka), fluent in Srividya's mantras and worship and considered beyond reproach in her ability to perform the rituals correctly. She described the day's events this way: We worship the goddess and the guru today and worship all the women (suvasint) here as forms of the goddess. All here are auspicious [that is, in childbearing years or mothers with living husbands] and pure [that is, not temporarily impure, such as they might be when menstruating]. All the gifts of saris, gold, and other things are the grace (prasada) of the goddess and the guru. When I asked her why men were not involved in performing the ritual and why few men had come to witness the day's events, she said: Many women here know the ritual and others know [devotional chants and/or songs such as,] the Thousand Names of LUlitA (LAlitasahas- ranama) . . . Our husbands support us. They provided money and helped organize all this. None of us would come without their consent. These [rituals and activities] are not things we are not permitted to do. This is a celebration of our being auspicious women (sumahgalt). We could not be that without our husbands and children. Not surprisingly, the overwhelming majority of attendees were not the slightest bit interested in "the religious" rituals, preferring to sit at a distance from the altar in groups gossiping, laughing, and enjoying themselves. Neither Padminanda nor the women conducting the rituals were fazed by this behavior. The scene resembled an Indian wedding, in which only priests and the immediate family of the unfortunate bride</page><page sequence="23">Brooks: Tantrism in South India 427 and groom are compelled to attend to the rigors of the ritual. While some effort was made to explain the symbolism of the Srividy&amp; rituals and the ostensible meaning of the gathering in short speeches from the platform, most participants with whom I spoke were not particularly interested in these matters. This was a day to wear one's finest sari, to meet with friends and make new ones, and to enjoy the auspicious pres- ence of the divine. Mandali members resisted imposing their own reli- gious sentiments which they said were the compelling reasons to go to such expense and to make such efforts. One senior Mandali member put it this way: "We do not try to make others think or do as we do. Everyone here is treated like a guest. Few understand the rituals or what we say. That is no matter. The goddess shares her blessings." Padminanda explained in a written pamphlet that the goddess was present both in her images and in 788 specially designated women who were her embodiments. The female children of the women would be conferred the status of the great goddess's minor attendants. Like the fecund goddess, all women being worshiped were married mothers with living husbands who lived righteous in the law (dharma). Sixteen women were singled out as the primary attendant deities of the supreme goddess who presided over the gr~cakra. These sixteen were seated at the edge of a chalk-drawn triangle symbolic of the triangle at the center of the multi-triangular grfcakra. The hall, we were told, had itself been transformed by the goddess and through her ritual worship into a r- cakra. In other words, the place of worship was now the very form of the goddess; the women worshiping and being worshiped were none other than the deities presiding within the great goddess's transcendent form (parartupa). The goddess was, in effect, worshiping herself. Padminanda stated that the sixteen women singled out for special treatment were chosen because they were Srividy&amp; initiates, though not all were members of Cidinanda Mandali. All were close family friends or relatives of Padmananda and other key Mandali members and all, in fact, claimed to be initiates into the most coveted of Srividy&amp; mantras and secrets. Several were not adept in Srividy&amp; rituals but rather had limited mantra-only initiations. These women, however, came from families patronizing the day's events. Activities, which began at about 9 a.m. and concluded formally at nearly 4 p.m., culminated in a meal. Food had been prepared and supervised by brahman caterers well-known in Madras for their work at sm2rta brahman weddings. Served as prasdda or, as William Sax has called it, "edible grace," the ritual meal, unlike most of the other events of the day, was a matter to which all paid great attention. The hall was</page><page sequence="24">428 Journal of the Amencan Academy of Religion lined with rows of women, children, and a few men, each with a stack of mementos; all were served a sumptuous, strictly vegetarian south Indian meal on fresh banana-leaf plates in the manner of a typical wedding party. No one would have considered it appropriate to leave before the meal or without their ritual mementos. People began taking their leave after having individually finished eating. TANTRIC AND VEDIC NORMS: INTERPRETING HINDU OTHERNESS Much more could be said about Cidinanda Mandali's work and the events of the Guru Pfija in 1985. I will limit remarks to the ways in which the situations and ideologies can offer insight into a particular kind of Hindu otherness, an otherness that works within a community that had adopted two distinctive and sometimes conflicting sets of view- points, customs, and textual authorities. In the process of creating its others, a society typically confuses some part of its neighbor with its neighbor, and a piece of itself with itself; it construes each in terms of the others (Green:50). Thus, a theory of the other "involves a double metonymy and a double distortion" (Green:50). Among smarta Srividy&amp; adepts in contemporary south India there are few doubts about communal loyalties and priorities. As a social group partially conceived in terms of "Vedic textual authority," they imagine no possible situation in which that tradition (or the"canon) could be sublated or rejected, in whole or in part. Tantric Srividy&amp; notwithstanding, they never fail to act from within their smdrta brahman world view, though this invariably requires a "distortion" of both brah- man and Tantric traditions and a renaming of the "Tantric" as "Vedic." That which is "Tantric" is affirmed as Not-Us through the practice of a Tantric ritual rather than by explicit statements of rejection or even by mention of the term. Put differently, everything that might be called "Tantric" about this particular goddess worship has instead been treated as if it were brahmanic; "Tantric" would be used to refer only to a tradi- tion that is thought to be anti-brahman. In order to maintain any semblance of a dual norm by which Tantric and brahman traditions are kept apart and thereby permitted a peaceful coexistence, it is necessary for these practitioners to fulfill the require- ments of a "double distortion." The "Vedic tradition," by which these smarta s mean their own version of brahmanism, couldnot possibly gain from association with anything "Tantric." Tantric Srividy&amp; must be reinterpreted as the quintessential expression of the Vedas-a point</page><page sequence="25">Brooks: Tantrism in South India 429 made ad nauseam by its commentarial apologists. It is one thing to declare as "other" someone who is outside the textual community to begin with. It is quite something else to declare that one who has had the text from the beginning can be on the outside. To do so makes the text a victim of subjectivity, reduces its stature, ,and destroys it as the community's center (Green:68). The Tantras of Srividy&amp;, having always been brahman property, become Vedic by partially disowning and par- tially reappropriating the language of the Tantras. Fieldwork evidence suggests that the "dual norm" in which Vedic and Tantric authorities are supposed to operate in separate spheres is, in fact, a single sphere in which brahman community precedents establish what role, if any, the Tantric canon will play in defining tradition. Tan- tric canonical injunctions to defy Vedic standards are not simply dis- missed. Rather, the issue of "what would happen if ... ?" is placed within a larger "experiment of intellect and emotion that explores a most dangerous, destructive circumstance and renders it nugatory" (Green:69). In other words, the experiment with the "other within us" renders that which is truly "other" either genuinely exotic, and therefore uninteresting, or no longer a threat. There are still Tantrics out there, but they are Not-Us. Potential threats or conflicts between Tantric and brahman tradi- tions are addressed not necessarily by talking about them in public (or even in private), but rather by acting. Padminanda and others within his group knew what to do, how to do it, and why it had to be done one way rather than another. In short, they had performed the necessary experiments and acted out those parts that would secure their stature from within the community's boundaries. In fact, it appears they suc- ceeded in differentiating themselves in ways sufficient to advance their personal (and group) standing within the brahman community. They had created, invested, and were prepared to reap profits from their sym- bolic capital. While this may not have been a stated objective, it was a consequence that few would have preferred to be without. Viewed from within the context of their local religious situation, Srividy&amp; had fulfilled one of its primary claims: it had become a vehicle for obtaining worldly power and social prestige. While Tantrism had been expunged, Sakt- ism- worshiping the goddess as Power-had worked its magic. Though some Srividya adepts beyond the confines of this group stated privately that the Cidinanda Mandali had missed an opportunity to affirm Tantric ideals because of their preoccupation with caste con- siderations, none of these critics were anxious to assume tht title "Tan- tric." In the example of Cidananda's Guru Pfja, dissociating Srividya's</page><page sequence="26">430 Journal of the American Academy of Religion goddess worship from things called "Tantric" created another mens by which smdrta s could assert and reclaim diminished religious and social privilege from within their own ranks. Srividy&amp;'s special association with goddess worship and its use of popular ritual icons, such as the fricakra, allows it to appropriate a common south Indian Hindu reli- gious perception that ties these images to displays of power-whether or not the images are canonically rooted in Tantrism. In the Guru Pfij&amp; of the Cidinanda Mandali most of the potentially dangerous and objectionable Tantric elements of Srividy&amp; were comfort- ably manipulated or left unmentioned. Theological issues and ritual prescriptions were not matters of discussion or debate. Rather, the event reaffirmed community social and political relations in the absence of a consensus about its religious principles (Lukes). Put differently, the ritual's work was accomplished with little reference to its troublesome Tantric canon; it had successfully repressed the dangers of flirting with the com- munity's religious and social alterities while appropriating its primary objective: an association with divine power (gakti).27 With the increasing role urban middle-class, high-caste Indian women play in the work place and their growing sense of entitlement to the fruits of their labors, the Tantric provision permitting women roles denied them in Vedic texts seemed also to express a recent social and cultural possibility. Lest we make too much of this apparent liberation of women in brahman ritual life, let us not forget that most men chose not to attend and gave permission for their wives to participate. It was, for these men, an innocent social event that happened to be religious. The consequences of denying their womenfolk this opportunity to gather, especially under these religious auspices, were far greater than allowing them to assume these ritual roles. This event set no radical precedent for rituals or roles beyond itself. Rather, it articulated in ritual actions an important but subtle shift in roles high-caste women have begun to play in religion and the work place. Nonetheless, the provi- sion for women to assume such roles with the tacit approval of the larger 271mportantly, other facets of Srividyi's Tantric heritage contributed to the event's success within the smarta community, though none would have wished to have these called "Tantric." Of particu- lar significance is the primary role women played as the ritual protagonists and as those who were expected to benefit most from the event. Were the rituals sma^rta rather than Tantric, women would not have functioned either as priests or primary benefactors, that is, as proxy sacrificers (yajamanna). Persons of both genders were self-consciously aware that women would not play such roles in Vedic rituals; they did not necessarily assume, however, that rituals were Vedic or Tantric. When I mentioned to some privately after the event that it was not a Vedic but a Tantric provision that made this role for women possible, the remark was either ignored (i.e., politely rejected) or I was corrected: it was a provision made possible by the goddess or by Srividyi.</page><page sequence="27">Brooks: Tantrism in South India 431 smdrta community suggests a willingness to reach beyond the Vedic canon for authorization of behaviors that none within the Vedic com- munity find objectionable. While smdrtas are apparently willing to extend themselves into non-smarta sources to authorize a socially con- doned activity, they remain collectively aware of precisely which values and behaviors are acceptable. The encounter with the "other" demands principled choices and the creation of an implicit set of criteria that determine what is and is not to be done. That certain behaviors are prescribed or admitted as possible is not the same as performing what is plausible. The ritual itself pro- vided a positive cognitive role for the community by rendering possible a newly articulated society in which roles were changing and traditions were being both preserved and modernized. Though these Tantric rites did not reorder religious hierarchies, they did render intelligible the roles being played by different members of smarta society and legiti- mized new roles for others. The individual consciences of Srividy&amp; adepts in attendance at the Cidinanda Guru Pfija gave way to the larger social expectations of the community whose approval they sought. If the dual norm setting off brahmanical and Tantric disciplines was present in this event, it manifested itself as a distinction between private thoughts and behaviors and public statements and actions. The problem of the smdrta Srividy&amp; text or adept insisting on the performances of the most anti-brahmanical Tantric ritual injunctions still remains. Cidinanda and his disciples provide the case in point. Why would a person who holds a standing in the brahman community comparable to Cidinanda's risk the opprobrium of the very people whose favor is sought and in whose service he or she claims to be? The answer is not a simple compartmentalization of Vedic and Tan- tric norms. This would suggest consistent principled action that refuses compromise and feels no compulsion to concede to social pressures and communal politics. Canonical Tantric ritual, at least as far as Cida- nanda himself was concerned, makes no provision for the suspension of injunctions for the performance of public ritual acts that are ordinarily carried out in private. Nor is it simply that most Tantric initiates and non-initiates are too unfamiliar with Sanskrit to know that such taboo behaviors are textually enjoined. Such prescriptions kept within the strict confines of ritual are theoretically permissible; this is precisely the Tantric position which, for example, condones wine drinking in ritual but condemns it outside. Sma~rtas, however, would condemn all such behavior, in ritual or non-ritual contexts. In other words, the ritual</page><page sequence="28">432 Journal of the American Academy of Religion made possible certain roles and behaviors that would, by definition, not transfer to other settings. South Indian brahman Srividy&amp; adepts flirt with their alterity not to counter competing claims of power made within their community but to create an experience of power and of "risk," albeit one that leaves noth- ing to chance. The possibility of defying conventional religious and social codes, as their canon and rituals profess, can be just as powerful as breaking them. Were a brahman practitioner of Srividy&amp;'s Tantric rituals found out to be "corrupting" women, drinking liquor, and feast- ing on non-vegetarian food, community condemnation would certainly follow. But flirting with taboos in ritual language is not the same as being "caught in the act," the possibility of which is rendered nugatory. An adept's flirtations with alterity serve only to increase the perception of the individual as powerful, so powerful in fact that he (or she) can defy in words the normative values of the caste community. The fact that Srividy&amp; initiates find it necessary and possible to con- ceal or obfuscate their Tantric heritage from the larger caste community may seem a dramatic compromise of their own ideology of power. Neither Cidinanda nor his disciples would defend or evangelize Tantric values in speech or acts that non-initiates might understand. In con- trast, using canonical writing was a safe and legitimate medium through which to express and acquire power which, in other media, is taboo. Such writing, like the ritual performed by the Mandali, could not rely for its power by being completely concealed. There must be some expres- sion that places the canon in the domain of non-initiates, even if it requires a double distortion. Canonical Tantric writers, like contemporary ritualists, make them- selves well-known and respected through intellectual prowess and ritual literacy; the adepts appear, to all who see them, to be pillars of commu- nity rectitude. Further, the author or ritualist who uses the text gains notoriety even when others do not realize they could not do likewise without endangering their social standing. Tantric power begins with the perception that one is religiously sanctified; the adept must create an experience of power which can be confirmed by others. This is some- times accomplished by ritual performances or, nowadays, by publica- tions. To express power, in these particular Tantric terms, requires that one keep open the possibility of socially prohibited behaviors which, if they are performed at all, must be kept entirely private. Power does not depend merely on displays of knowledge which others do not have, but also on the self-perception of the Tantric that he or she might possibly do what others would not dare to propose.</page><page sequence="29">Brooks: Tantrism in South India 433 The ideal of the Cidananda Mandali's rituals is not to fulfill the pre- scriptions of their guru by performing Tantric rituals in public that defy brahman community standards. Rather, their ideal requires that they not perform them. Herein lies the power of the Tantric as the Hindu "other" for smanrta brahmans in contemporary south India: power expresses itself not so much by what one does, or says one might do, but by what others would never do. This particular Hindu encounter with the "other within" addresses new situations and old problems while, at the same time, it recasts roles within a community probing the bounda- ries of it own legitimacy and self-understanding.28 BIBLIOGRAPHY Bharati, The Tantric Tradition.
