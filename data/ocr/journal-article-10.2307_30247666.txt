<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE KIVA, Vol. 45, Nos. 1-2, 1979 THE PETROGLYPHS OF TUMAMOC HILL ALAN FERG Arizona State Museum The University of Arizona ABSTRACT Approximately 460 Hohokam petroglyphs from Tumamoc Hill (AZ AA: 16:6), a "fortified" hill (trincheras) just west of Tucson, are discussed. A new style of prehistoric rock art - Hohokam Scratched style - is described. Dating, typologies, analyses, and interpretations of petroglyphs are discussed for Tumamoc Hill in particular, for Tumamoc Hill as com- pared to other Tucson Basin petroglyph sites, and to Hohokam rock art in general. INTRODUCTION During the fall of 1974 and the spring of 1975, members of the Arizona Archaeological and Historical Society conducted an intensive survey of the archaeological resources on Tumamoc Hill, one facet of this investigation being to record as many of the petroglyphs on the hill as possible. At the time the recording was done, this was only the third project to record a sizable number of petroglyphs in southern Arizona, the others being Cheryl White's (1965) recording of eight sites in Saguaro National Monument and Ernest Snyder's (1966) extensive recording of the South Mountain petroglyphs in Phoenix. Since then, other investigators (Weaver and Rosenberg 1978; Snyder 1978) have recorded additional sites. For the Tumamoc Hill Project, the author personally recorded all of the petroglyphs with the aid of a few members of the Society who assisted in locating petroglyphs. Due to the thoroughness of their efforts, it is believed that at least 90 percent of the glyphs on Tumamoc Hill were found. The total number recorded was in excess of 460 individual glyphs. However, only 398 were assignable to design element categories and used in the analyses, the other glyphs being too badly weathered to classify. To obtain comparative data, the author also did limited recording, primarily around the crowns of Martinez Hill (AZ BB: 13:2) and Black Mountain (AZ AA: 16:12), both trincheras sites in the Tucson Basin. RECORDING At the outset of the petroglyph project, a cursory examination of Tumamoc Hill showed that there were at least as many petroglyphs on the slopes of the hill as had already been observed at the top (Larson 1972:99-100). These glyphs did 95</page><page sequence="2">96 FERG not occur randomly on the hill, but occurred either on clusters of boulders or on isolated single boulders. With this in mind an open-ended recording system was used and each petroglyph was assigned a unique, two-part number. A sketch map was drawn for each cluster showing the relative spatial relationship of each petroglyph boulder to the others in that cluster, and to any other nearby permanent or semi-permanent objects such as conspicuous plants, telephone poles, aerial photography markers, roads, trails, mortar holes, fences, and past or present structures. Distances between glyphs were noted on most maps. Contour lines were also shown, but do not correspond to contours on any instrument-made map and are simply for orientation purposes. Also, both the general areas of clusters and the particular locations of isolated glyph boulders were plotted on a topographic map of Tumamoc Hill provided by the Planning Department of the Division of Physical Resources of the University of Arizona. This map, made in 1964, has a 4 foot contour interval, and the plotted locations are quite accurate. These maps, as well as all of the data below, are on file at the Arizona State Museum. Each face on a petroglyph boulder was treated as a unit and the following data were recorded for each one: (1) Horizontal or vertical position of petroglyphs on the rock face (hori- zontal and vertical were artibrarily categorized as rock faces at angles of 0-44 degrees and 45-90 degrees to horizontal, respectively). (2) The direction the glyphs faced (if on a vertical rock face) was noted. (3) The "intrasite elevation" of each glyph on the hill was noted as follows: bottom (base of hill to elevation of the Desert Laboratories), middle (Desert Laboratories to hill rim), or top (hill rim and summit). These elevation divisions are not wholly arbitrary, the Desert Labora- tories being located on a slight break in the slope of the north face of the hill, and the hill rim being a topographical and cultural boundary all around the summit (cultural material is relatively sparse below the rim). (4) When applicable, each glyph within a cluster was also assigned an "intracluster elevation," that is, the bottom, middle, or top third of the cluster. Also noted were points that could be seen from the petroglyph, such as Black Mountain or the St. Mary's site (AZ AA: 16:26). Size was not recorded for any of the petroglyphs as it did not seem to be a factor in segregating any design element category from another. This is borne out by an examination of White's (1965:27-30) tables of design elements and their size ranges. Freehand drawings (not to scale) were made of most of the glyphs. Color slides of many of the glyphs were taken by the author; black-and-white photographs of the majority of the glyphs on the hill were also taken by Stephen</page><page sequence="3">Petroglyphs of Tumamoc Hill 97 M. Larson. These are on file at the Arizona State Museum. Larson used 35 mm fine-grain, medium-contrast, high resolution film, under natural lighting. This is noted because others (White 1965:4-5) have resorted to chalking petroglyphs rather than using careful photography to insure "clear" pictures. It is question- able whether chalking is a useful device or whether it simply obscures the true outlines and leaves only a photographic record of the biases of the chalker. There is, however, no question that chalking is destructive; it does abrade the petroglyph, and it does not weather off in a short time. Finally, in southern Arizona, with the usually bright light and heavily weathered stone, petroglyphs can be very difficult to see. Because of this it is advisable to cover the same piece of ground at least twice at different times of the day to insure that the maximum number of petroglyphs are discovered. STYLES Two styles of prehistoric petroglyphs occur on Tumamoc Hill, what I will call the Pecked style and Hohokam Scratched style. Pecked style petroglyphs are made, as their name implies, by pecking through the chemical patina on a rock surface to the (usually) lighter, unaltered stone beneath. This is the most common type of petroglyph in southern Arizona, but has never been formally defined (Figure 1). The manufacture of petroglyphs by scratching or incising a rock surface has not heretofore been noted as a Hohokam rock art technique. Originally, all scratched petroglyphs on Tumamoc Hill, including initials, dates, and deface- ments apparently done with nails or chisels, were thought to be recent grafitti. After examining most of the hill, however, a homogeneity of style seemed evident among a number of these scratched glyphs. Hohokam Scratched style petroglyphs are rectilinear figures for the most part, usually composed of lines made by one stroke of a tool across the rock face. This produces an incised line which may or may not go through the patina, depending on the thickness of the patina and the smoothness of the rock surface. Only rarely does the same line appear to have been traced a second time. The implement used was almost certainly a flake or complete tool made from silicious stone rather than from the local basalt. Using a sharp piece of basalt on the basalt stone products at best a wide, shallow gash. While fresh scratches, and even those dates which are a few years old, appear grey upon close examination, Hohokam Scratched style glyphs are invariably the same color as the rock's patina - dark brown or black. Presumably this is because the Scratched glyphs never penetrated the patina when made or, being such fine lines and removing relatively little rock, they were rapidly and completely repatinated. Hohokam Scratched style is characterized by a limited number of distinc- tive designs: grid hatchures; diamond hatchures; single or sets of parallel,</page><page sequence="4">98 FERG =U u~~: ...

All of these motifs are highly reminiscent of Classic period Tucson Basin red-on-brown pottery designs. That Hohokam Scratched style glyphs are not merely guidelines for making Pecked glyphs is evident from (1) the lack or rarity of Hohokam Scratched motifs among Pecked glyphs and (2) the close spacing of the lines in a Scratched glyph (a single pecked line would cover several). Scratched glyphs are usually less than 30 cm long. They are much less common than those of the Pecked style; only 42 were recorded from Tumamoc Hill, as opposed to about 420 Pecked style glyphs. In light of these data on patina, method of manufacture, consistency of design elements, and strong similarities to Tucson Basin Classic period red-on- brown pottery motifs, the genuineness and integrity of Hohokam Scratched style petroglyphs can be convincingly argued. However, the case is further strengthened by three examples of superimposition - in all three cases the scratched glyph was under the pecked glyph. Later examination of all the data also produced another trait which segregates the two styles: 63 percent of the Pecked style glyphs are on vertical rock faces and 37 percent on horizontal faces, while 21 percent of the Hohokam Scratched style glyphs are on vertical faces and 79 percent on horizontal faces. Several Hohokam Scratched glyphs also occur on Martinez Hill; in one case a Scratched glyph has a Pecked glyph superimposed on it; in a second example of superimposition, the order cannot be determined. It might be noted that, at present, Scratched style petroglyphs appear to be peculiar to the Tucson Basin and, by the nature of their manufacture, confined to rock types (such as basalts) which, when scratched, are hard enough to retain the mark. This may explain the absence of Scratched style glyphs at Black Mountain where the rock is too grainy, weathered, and rough to allow thin lines to be incised. A personal examination of the major petroglyph sites in Saguaro National Monument (White 1965), the Painted Rocks site (Wasley and Johnson 1965:72-74), and some sites in the South Mountains (Snyder 1966) failed to locate any Scratched style petroglyphs. It seems useless at this time to speculate why such a dichotomy in manufacturing technique, boulder selection, and subject matter should occur in two styles of rock art presumably made by the same ethnic group at close, if not overlapping, periods in time. DESIGN ELEMENT CATEGORIES The problem of typology has been refractory. Designs which obviously represent something in the real world are not difficult to deal with, but nonrepresentative designs resist categorization. For the nonrepresentative designs, therefore, we resort largely to intuition - we simply group those which seem to us to be similar.... We have tried, on</page><page sequence="6">100 FERG the whole, to split rather than lump in our classification, and hence we probably have more elements than are necessary in the definition of styles. This is unavoidable, though, since we cannot tell a priori which distinctions will be culturally meaningful; if we could we would not have to go through this phase of the analysis (Heizer and Baumhoff 1962:72). This problem is of particular importance in southern Arizona where, like Nevada, so many of the design elements are nonrepresentative. The bulk of Hohokam petroglyphs consist of geometric designs, and these cannot be ignored or carelessly classified if we are to learn anything concerning the why or wherefore of Hohokam rock art. One problem to be avoided is mentioned by Heizer and Baumhoff above - that of constructing design element categories which are too gross. This problem of overinclusiveness was taken into account when constructing the design element categories for the present project. In an effort to solve that problem, four sets of design element categories were used (Table 1). One drawback to this method is that the categories in Set 1 (the finest distinctions recognizable to the recorder) may contain only a few members, or one member, and relationships among these categories will be difficult to assess. The categories of Set 1 are lumped into the next more inclusive units and these groups comprise Set 2, and so forth. The usefulness of such a scheme is that other workers, if dissatisfied with these groups of elements, can accu- rately recombine Set I elements into new categories of their own without having to examine all of the data forms or visit the site and personally relocate and record glyphs. A few words of explanation about some of the individual elements are in order. In Set 1, not knowing what distinctions were culturally meaningful, the anthropomorphs were divided into 14 groups, based on the position of arms and legs, presence or absence of a phallus, presence or absence of phalanges, body form, execution technique, and the presence or absence of material culture. The lizards, too, were grouped according to the positions of the front and back legs. Phallic stickmen anthropomorphs were arbitrarily differentiated from lizards based on the length of the appendage between the hind legs. Figure 2 illustrates 12 of the Set 1 anthropomorphs. The two not illustrated are a pecked stickman with incised (scratched) fingers and toes (one recorded), and a stickman holding an object of material culture (two recorded). Also shown are the two types of lizards and the varieties of concentric circle and bull's eye motifs. Most of the other elements are self-explanatory, the definitions being those used by Heizer and Baumhoff (1962:72-93). A few of the design element categories, such as "reticulates," were created specifically for this project. "Reticulates'" are any sort of unsymmetric net-like figure made by the intersection of straight and/or curved lines that form, cells or compartments. A symmetric net-like figure is classed as a grid or hatchure of some type (see Figure 2 for an example of a reticulate). Another design element is "pipettes" (Figure 3); they are described in the "Analysis: Dating" section of this paper.</page><page sequence="7">Petroglyphs of Tumamoc Hill 101 Table 1.

This section is short, as fully 70 percent of the glyphs on Tumamoc Hill are abstract (geometric). It is virtually impossible to determine the meaning of a particular petro- glyph or even of a group of petroglyphs without (1) the aid of ethnographic information (for examples, see True 1954, Schaafsma 1963, Cox and Stasack 1970; for a highly questionable application of ethnographic data see Martineau 1973), (2) a large sample size (Grant, Baird and Pringle 1968), or (3) unique circumstances that point strongly to a particular interpretation (Hayden 1972). Even with such help, interpretation is usually difficult and must always be a somewhat tenuous matter. a b ho o Figure 3. Pipettes: a-c, from Tumamoc Hill; d, from AZ AA:12:65 in Saguaro National Monument; e-f, from South Mountain in Phoenix; g-i, from Martinez Hill.</page><page sequence="11">Petroglyphs of Tumamoc Hill 105 Though of little interpretive value for this report, a number of portrayals of material culture occur on Tumamoc Hill. One example of a stickman holding a bow and arrow occurs on the top of the hill, and several stickmen are apparently sporting headdresses of various sorts while a few hold staffs or batons. Only two petroglyphs on the hill apparently try to depict action (the rest of the humans and zoomorphs are all in rigid, static postures). One stickman has one hand on his hip and points north (downslope'?) with the other hand. The other glyph (Figure 4, left center) shows five stickmen in a line holding hands, with the stickman at the right end holding the tail of a quadruped - a highly animated scene as Hohokam petroglyphs go. Hypotheses as to what this lively group is actually doing or may represent (a ceremony'? children teasing a dog'?) are all as equally fascinating as they are untestable. Some sort of dance suggests itself and, in this connection, it may be noted that Schaafsma (1963:35) mentions that rows of hand-holding figures have been made recently at Jemez pueblo to commemorate specific dances. However, without strong evidence (ethnographic or otherwise), such human chains should not be cursorily labeled as dancers. A few petroglyphs vaguely resemble flowers, vines, and prickly pear cactus, but their shapes are either so stylized or so amorphous that they cannot be positively identified as botanical. Interestingly, Haury (1976:237) notes that floral patterns are an extremely rare motif in Hohokam ceramics. Published drawings and explanations of the carved figures on Papago and Pima calendar sticks were compared with the Tumamoc Hill petroglyphs for any internal consistencies of meaning or syntactic rules which might have recognizable homologues in prehistoric rock art (no implication is intended that either the Papago or Pima are the generic or cultural descendants of the Hohokam). On these calendar sticks, however, such consistencies as do exist in the form and meaning of various symbols are almost wholly idiosyncratic. Each record keeper has his own set of symbols whose meanings are of his own choosing (Russell 1908:37; Underhill 1938:7). With this characteristic of Piman calendar stick symbols in mind, it seems a waste of time at present to try to compare the symbols on the sticks with petroglyphs of a prehistoric group that may or may not be related. It seems only appropriate to conclude this section with what I consider an admonition from Garrick Mallery, one of the first men to attempt interpreta- tions of North American rock art in a systematic fashion (an admonition which he regrettably did not often follow himself): Perhaps the most important lesson learned from these studies is that no attempt should be made at symbolic interpretation unless the symbolic nature of the particular charac- ters under examination is known, or can be logically inferred from independent facts. To start with a theory, or even a hypothesis, that the rock writings are all symbolic and may be interpreted by the imagination of the observer or by translation either from or into known symbols of similar form found in other regions, were a limitless delusion (Mallery 1893:768).</page><page sequence="12">106 FERG Figure 4. Historic scratched glyph illustrating the Pythagorean theorem (upper left) and various prehistoric Pecked style glyphs (photo by Stephen M. Larson).</page><page sequence="13">Petroglyphs of Tumamoc Hill 107 ANALYSIS: DATING The absolute and relative dating of the petroglyphs on Tumamoc Hill was accomplished using several sources of information. These sources are grouped below as "Internal Evidence" and "Ceramic Evidence," the former referring to indications of age provided by the petroglyphs themselves. Internal Evidence Patination and superimposition demonstrated that the Scratched style petroglyphs are of equal, if not greater age than glyphs of the Pecked style on Tumamoc Hill. Comparison of the Scratched style motifs with pottery designs suggests that they are of Classic period age (approximately A.D. 1200-1450). A Pecked style petroglyph group also indicates a heavily patinated, hourglass- bodied anthropomorph holding a staff superimposed by a stickman with a lighter patina, who is typical of the vast majority of anthropomorphs on the hill (Figure 5, lower illustration). This hourglass anthropomorph is quite similar to those that occur on Santa Cruz and Sacaton phase pottery. There are no design elements on Tumamoc Hill, superimposed or otherwise, except this one that I would refer to an earlier than Classic period origin. Evidence supporting the relative ages of Pecked and Scratched style petroglyphs, as indicated above, can be found on Martinez Hill. Here, both Pecked and Scratched style glyphs can be found. The design elements of both styles are virtually the same as those on Tumamoc Hill. The important point already noted, however, is that on Martinez Hill, Pecked style glyphs are also found superimposed on Scratched style glyphs. Ceramic Evidence At Tumamoc Hill the decorated ceramics recovered in direct association with the hill are predominately Tanque Verde Red-on-brown with Rincon and Rillito Red-on-brown also present in smaller quantities (Hartmann and Hart- mann, this issue). Other sites in the Tucson Basin with comparable Pecked style petroglyphs that also have painted sherds in possible association with them are Black Mountain, Martinez Hill, and AZ BB: 14:21 in Saguaro National Monu- ment. At all three sites the sherds are Tanque Verde Red-on-brown (Fontana, Greenleaf, and Cassidy 1959:47; White 1965:68; Bruce Huckell 1977, per- sonal communication). Petroglyph Distribution through Time An interesting statement made by Hayden (1972:81) bears examination at this time:</page><page sequence="14">108 FERG , a . ' ."

Lower illustration: Drawing showing boulder with super- imposed Pecked style glyphs (photo by Stephen M. Larson).</page><page sequence="15">Petroglyphs of Tumamoc Hill 109 The writer has a strong subjective impression that Hohokam petroglyphs may have been developed during the last of the Pioneer Period and may have reached their peak in numbers and distribution during the Sacaton phase of the Sedentary Period. Evidence has already been presented for the contemporaneity and Classic period age of the petroglyphs on Tumamoc Hill, Black Mountain, Martinez Hill, and AZ BB:14:21 in Saguaro National Monument. A final piece of evidence is the distribution of a very distinctive design element which I have called "'pipettes." "Pipettes" are characterized by having bilateral symmetry with bulges of varying shapes at intervals; the element is usually composed of two lines which do not meet at either the top or bottom of the figure (Figure 3). The occurrence of pipettes at AZ AA: 12:65 in Saguaro National Monument (White 1965:Plate 5B), Martinez Hill, Tumamoc Hill, and South Mountain in Phoenix points to the contemporaneity of these sites, and indicates that AZ AA: 12:65 and South Mountain also have Classic period components, although they have no identified associated ceramics. Snyder (1966:706) does mention red and red-on-buff sherds occurring at some of the South Mountain sites, but does not state what the types are. Also present at South Mountain (although not mentioned by Snyder and not evident from his rather broad, published design element categories) are a number of Colonial and Sedentary period style life forms (including anthropomorphs and birds), very similar to the one illustrated for Tumamoc Hill (Figure 5, lower illustration). These are abundant enough to suggest that a sizable number of glyphs in the South Mountain sites may be attributed to the late Colonial and early Sedentary periods. With this information in mind, and after examination of the relative proportions of design elements present at various sites, some comments can be made relevant to Hayden's strong impression. Table 2 presents the percentages of anthropomorphic, zoomorphic, geometric, and botanical glyphs at South Mountain, Tumamoc Hill, Martinez Hill, Black Mountain, and all of the sites recorded in Saguaro National Monument. The percentages of anthropomorphs at Martinez Hill and Black Mountain appear disproportionately large, but it should be remembered that recording at these two sites was confined primarily to the summits where the majority of anthropomorphs on Tumamoc Hill were found to cluster (see "Analysis: Spatial Distribution" below). Although the data from these two sites may merely confuse the picture, they are presented in order to draw upon as much data as possible. Three things are clear from Table 2: (1) Generally speaking, the proportions of anthropomorphs to zoomorphs to geometrics to botanical elements in Hohokam rock art are congruent to the proportions found in Hohokam pottery motifs: geometric elements predominate over anthropomorphs and zoomorphs, and botanical motifs are decidedly rare. (2) Life forms in general, and zoomorphs specifically, are (if the data from Martinez Hill and Black Mountain are looked at conservatively, or</page><page sequence="16">110 FERG Table 2. Percentages of petroglyph motifs present at Hohokam rock art sites in southern Arizona. The number in parentheses below the site name is the total number of petroglyphs recorded at that site.

(3) Within the Tucson Basin, zoomorphs are relatively less abundant at trincheras sites than at non-trincheras sites. Taking the first observation as a given, and examining the last two observations, three factors appear to be interacting to produce the percentages seen in Table 2: (1) Tumamoc Hill, and probably all trincheras sites in the Tucson Basin, may have relatively fewer zoomorphs than non-trincheras sites be- cause of specific preferences on the part of petroglyph makers working on trincheras sites, or conversely, because of positive preferences for zoomorph motifs on the part of petroglyph makers working at non- trincheras sites; perhaps, as White (1965:62) suggests, some of these latter sites represent attempts at hunting magic or ritual. (2) The apparent close relationship between ceramic motifs and petro- glyph design elements is probably the explanation for the higher percentages of life forms among petroglyphs of the Gila-Salt area. Throughout Hohokam history, "core" area Hohokam potters who produced red-on-buff pottery have always had a greater penchant for life form motifs than.did Tucson Basin potters who produced red-on- brown pottery. It would be strange if this were not reflected in the rock art of the two regions. (3) Another factor probably responsible for the greater abundance of life forms in the Gila-Salt region, as shown in Table 2, is time. There is every indication that a respectable percent of the South Mountain petroglyphs are of Santa Cruz or Sacaton phase age (Colonial/Sedentary period), while those in the Tucson Basin are, in the main, of Classic</page><page sequence="17">Petroglyphs of Tumamoc Hill 111 period age. Life forms, drawing an analogy with ceramic motifs again, were more prevalent in the Colonial and Sedentary periods. Finally, though the dating method must be used with caution, Wasley and Johnson (1965:74) assigned two petroglyph sites in the Gila Bend area to the Classic period, based on their proximity to known Classic period sites. To summarize, regardless of why Hayden believes that Hohokam petro- glyphs may have developed late in the Pioneer period, in my opinion (based on the arguments I have just constructed) he is correct in believing that they reached a peak in numbers in the Gila-Salt region during the Sedentary or possibly late Colonial period. However, in the Tucson Basin, and possibly in the Gila Bend area, it appears that petroglyphs developed (or were introduced?) during the Sedentary period, but were produced in the greatest numbers during the Classic period. It is interesting to note in this connection that Greenleaf (1975:271-278) has postulated a migration of Tucson Basin peoples bearing Tucson Basin traits (one of which might have been the manufacture of petro- glyphs?) into the Gila Bend area at this time. It might be instructive to compare the petroglyphs of trincheras in the Tucson Basin with those located around the Fortified Hill site (AZ T: 13:8) near Gila Bend. ANALYSIS: SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION As noted above, the petroglyphs on Tumamoc Hill are not distributed evenly over the surface of the hill. Rather, the vast majority are in groups of from two to 30, located on bedrock ridges and knobs. A few glyphs are found individually on small rocks away from clusters. The bedrock outcrops occur all around the top of the hill and down the relatively gentle north slope. In terms of flatness of surface, large surface area, and darkness of patina, bedrock outcrops provide the best surfaces for making petroglyphs. This may well explain why approximately 90 percent of the petroglyphs occur on such bedrock ridges and knobs. Of the isolated glyphs, half are on large boulders greater than 2 m in diameter. The Pecked style glyphs are found on all bedrock outcrops, with three important exceptions. Two knobs on the north face have no petroglyphs, and one knob on the west has only Scratched style petroglyphs. The rock surfaces on these knobs are perfectly suitable for use. Why were they not utilized? A look at the distribution of all the cultural features on the hill readily points to the fact that of all the outcrops on Tumamoc Hill, only these three are not located near other activity areas, such as trails, walls, artifact clusters, mortar holes, or rock circles. Taking into account various interpretations of the function of the rock art on Tumamoc Hill, the best explanation for the distribution of Pecked style glyphs on the hill would appear to be that the decision-making processes governing location of glyphs were I(1) the suitability of the rock surfaces, and</page><page sequence="18">112 FERG (2) proximity to other activity areas. Poor rock or outcrops away from major activity areas were not desirable. This pattern is faithfully repeated on Martinez Hill and Black Mountain. Only 42 Scratched glyphs were recorded on Tumamoc Hill, and 26 of these clustered on one knob on the west face - one of the knobs on which there were no Pecked style petroglyphs. The other 16, however, were fairly evenly distributed over the hill. Although the constraints on location of Scratched style petroglyphs are apparently different from those for Pecked style glyphs, at present I can offer no explanation for this pattern of distribution. Now let us examine the spatial distributions of the individual design element categories in relationship to a number of variables. For each element, the following information was recorded: orientation, elevation rela- tive to all the glyphs on the hill, elevation relative to other elements in the same cluster, other elements on the same boulder, and what could be seen from the petroglyph. This last variable might be of interest if the petroglyphs were the result of "doodling" on the part of bored Hohokam lookouts. However, there is almost no point on Tumamoc Hill from which some piece of potentially interesting topography cannot be seen. For this reason, when doing the cross- tabulations below, information on what could be seen from a particular petro- glyph was not included. Cross-tabulations of each of these variables with each design element category of all four design element category sets were per- formed. This was done for each cluster, for the whole hill, or both, as applicable, using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) pro- gram. This yielded 209 tables, containing 7,766 cells. Thus, including the column totals for some of the tables, almost 8,000 possible relationships were examined. Out of these correlations, five apparently nonrandom intrasite elevation distributions appear, and one example of what appears to be a consistent preference for one variation of a design element over another: (1) of 10 quadrupeds, eight occur at the bottom of the hill; (2) of eight lizards, seven occur at the bottom of the hill; (3) of seven non-phallic stickmen with phalanges, six occur at the bottom of the hill; (4) of 24 phallic stickmen without phalanges, 21 occur at the top of the hill; (5) of three centipedes, all three occur at the top of the hill in the same cluster; (6) of 10 quadrupeds, nine face to the right, one faces to the left. The 62 stickmen without either phallus or phalanges are evenly distributed on the hill. One stickman with both occurs at the top of the hill. One possible explanation for the preponderance of zoomorph petroglyphs at the base of the hill is that this reflects the actual physical distributions of these animals on the hill. If this were true, it would be interesting to know the</page><page sequence="19">Petroglyphs of Tumamoc Hill 113 explanation behind the almost mutually exclusive distributions of phallic as opposed to fingered stickmen glyphs. It had been hoped that any patterned distributions of petroglyphs on Tumamoc Hill might be mirrored in the design element distributions on the other two trincheras sites in the Tucson Basin, Martinez Hill and Black Mountain. It was impossible to compare the hills, however, as the natural distribution of suitable rock on Martinez Hill and Black Mountain differs markedly from that of Tumamoc Hill. The vast majority of good rock outcrops on Martinez Hill and Black Mountain are at the top, with extremely little good stone at the middle or lower elevations. Time did not permit recording of petroglyphs on trincheras sites outside the Tucson Basin. The number of trincheras with petroglyphs present is unknown. Although Stacy (1974:168- 170) records only three of 35 trincheras sites as having petroglyphs, it is apparent that not all of the sites were thoroughly examined. Martinez Hill, for example, listed as having no petroglyphs, has relatively abundant glyphs, located both on the summit and below the rim. It may be that the detailed recording of such sites will provide suitable material against which the patterns observed on Tumamoc Hill can be compared. As for non-trincheras sites, little or no patterned distribution (intrasite patterning) has been observed. White (1965:65) notes for her Saguaro National Monument sites that: There does not seem to be any significance to the direction in which any category or sub-category of petroglyphs faces. Petroglyph categories and sub-categories are not concentrated in a specific area of any site, nor are the areas with the greatest number of petroglyphs the same at any site. For the sites in the South Mountains, Snyder (1966:706-707) found a tendancy towards the better executed petroglyphs being placed at higher elevations, but in terms of elevation, terrain, and occurrence of specific glyphs together he states, "One is forced to conclude that, insofar as the South Mountain petro- glyphs are concerned, there seems to be nothing of determinable significance in terms of design associations between sites or within a single site." Finally, two design elements that appeared to hold potential for making inferences about either prehistoric behavior or handedness were the spirals and quadrupeds. In examining a number of petroglyph sites in the Tucson Basin, it was noted that a marked predominance of quadrupeds faced right (as on Tumamoc Hill) and spirals are mainly counterclockwise (starting in the center and going out in a counterclockwise direction). Table 3 presents this data in tabular form. It might be noted that of the four left-facing quadrupeds on Black Mountain, three are deer with obvious racks. This is an interesting contrast to the generally right-facing, non-horned or mountain sheep-type horned quadru- peds at all of the other sites. As an experiment, 75 students in introductory</page><page sequence="20">114 FERG Table 3.

Whether the students were male or female and right- or left-handed was recorded. Approximately one-half of the students drew clockwise spirals and one-half drew counterclockwise spirals; the same was true of left-facing and right-facing quadrupeds. This was true whether one was controlling for sex, handedness, or considering all of the students together. Although this test group was not made up of Hohokam Indians, nor were the designs being executed on stone, it seems a reasonable assumption that the handedness and sex of the prehistoric glyph-maker can be discounted as a factor in the often nonrandom proportions of these two design elements and their variations. The factors that controlled this conscious selection of design elements are not known. DISCUSSION One of the most popular, and least supportable, explanations for the occurrence of petroglyphs at a site is that the site is ceremonial in nature. Fontana and others (1959:51 ) suggested that a characteristic of ceremonial sites</page><page sequence="21">Petroglyphs of Tumamoc Hill 115 would be the presence of numerous petroglyphs. However, as Larson (1972:100) has already correctly noted, a definite connection between ceremo- nialism and petroglyphs has yet to be shown for the Hohokam. Considering our scant knowledge of Hohokam religious practices, it is likely that such a connection will never be demonstrated. Furthermore, for Tumamoc Hill all we can definitely say is that petroglyphs cluster on the most favorable rock surfaces closest to other activity areas. This association implies that the glyphs are more likely secular in nature than ceremonial, as do the artifacts on the hill: metates, mortar holes, plainware sherds, occasional fragments of jewelry, projectile points, a stone bowl, and a medicine stone, as well as the large numbers of structures. These indicate activities related to everyday living, rather than ritual activities. Sauer and Brand (1931:118-119), in speaking of Sonoran trincheras, have this to say: That the latter [cerros de trincheras in the Altar and Magdalena valleys] were habitations can hardly be gainsaid: the pottery, metates, mortars, and other human debris are too general and too large in amount to lend themselves to any interpretation of these places as mysterious ceremonial sites, or even to restrict them to the role which they played with the Opata, that of occasional refuges. In reaching her conclusions about trincheras in Arizona, Stacy (1974:xiv) must not have examined Tumamoc Hill, as it certainly has no paucity of material such as she describes: The presence at the Sonoran cerros de trincheras of manos and metates with the quantity of ceramic and lithic debris are indicative of everyday living. The lack of these items in Arizona sites suggests that occupation of the hills was for different purposes in the two areas. As already noted, a string of hand-holding stickmen that does occur on Tumamoc Hill might be interpreted as ceremonial, but they cannot be proven to be dancers, nor for that matter dancers at a ceremonial occasion. It has also been suggested that petroglyphs are mnemonic devices, perhaps conceptually akin to Piman calendar sticks. Such a hypothesis is difficult to test since for Tumamoc Hill and for the South Mountain sites (Snyder 1965:706) there is no apparent syntax to the design element groupings. If, like the calendar sticks, the various design elements are idiosyncratic, demonstrating the mnemonic nature of the petroglyphs would seem impossible. Equally untestable is the hypothesis that petroglyphs represent totem or clan symbols. Again, we know nothing of such organizations among the Hohokam. Also, in the example of petroglyphs used as clan signatures by the Hopi (documented by Colton 1946; Colton and Colton 1931), individual clan signatures were repeated numerous times, frequently in rows, or on the same portion of the boulder. No such ordered repetition occurs among the Tumamoc Hill petroglyphs.</page><page sequence="22">116 FERG My own theory as to why these petroglyphs were made is, unfortunately, quite untestable. My opinion, though, is that the petroglyphs on Tumamoc Hill were created for the enhancement of the petroglyph maker's immediate sur- roundings; they were decorative. I am not trying to build an "art for art's sake" explanation of the rock art here, but rather something much more mundane. It would be analogous to wall-papering one's house or setting up a rock or sculpture garden on one's property - in no way do these actions or their results enhance the physical properties of the objects acted upon, nor can such actions be classed as ceremonial per se, though these sorts of activities can be both a creative outlet of sorts, and can carry a certain amount of prestige for the person who does them well. The presence of petroglyphs on that rock which is suitably patinated and near to other activity areas on the hill, and the very minimal amount of ordered repetition of the various design elements indicates to me that this may very well be the correct interpretation of the "meaning" of these petroglyphs. This interpretation is not meant to be applied to other Hohokam rock art sites. There are many sites that are very different in nature. For instance, the sites in Saguaro National Monument are not located near habita- tion sites, and are located along washes (White 1965:9). It is also of interest here to note, that for reasons which she does not make altogether clear, White (1965:32, 62-63) feels the geometric elements were probably executed "purely for decoration." Hayden's (1972) Sierra Pinacate sites appear to be associated with Hohokam shell expeditions. The Painted Rocks site (Wasley and Johnson 1965:73) is an isolated bedrock outcrop away from any habitation sites. As discussed above, my interpretation of the motivation behind the petro- glyphs on Tumamoc Hill is not dependent on, or closely linked with, any specific interpretation of the function of the hill itself. In fact, if my interpreta- tion of the "meaning " of the petroglyphs is correct, creation of rock art would have been a nonessential activity, peripheral to virtually any use of the hill, whether it was used as a refuge, a permanent habitation site, a lookout post, a ceremonial site, or some or all of the above. I am quick to repeat though, that petroglyphs in themselves do not, a priori, constitute a ceremonial site. I do feel that an interpretation of these petroglyphs as being essentially decorative may hold true for other trincheras sites in the Tucson Basin, and it is a hypothesis to be considered as more sites of this type are examined in greater detail.
