Mellon Lectures in the Fine Arts 1957, Bol- lingen Series xxxv. 6, I and II), New York, Pan- theon Books, 1962, 1964, 2 vols. Pp. xli, 1171; 678 figs.; 38 color pls. $25.oo. The theme of this work, as the author's subtitle tells us, is the universal problem of constancy and change in art. As in his previous books, Giedion marshals a vast army of facts, theories and illustrative materials in aid of his hypotheses. This time he ranges over the fields of prehistoric, Egyptian and Sumerian art, find- ing in this long time span innumerable instances both of modification and of continuity in style, technique, and iconography. While the author's method is familiar enough to art historians, the novelty of his approach lies first in its scope, cutting as it does across traditional temporal and spatial barriers, and secondly in the at- tention paid to constancy or recurrence as well as to innovation. Giedion's point of departure for his analysis of early art is essentially Levy-Bruhl's conception of primitive mentality as prelogical. Thus Giedion interprets the frequency of animal imagery in Paleolithic art as an expression of feelings of inferiority on the part of Stone Age man and of an unwillingness or inability to set himself apart from other creatures of the natural order. But whereas the image of the human body was gen- erally neglected in prehistoric times, these artists re- vealed their attitudes primarily through the representa- tion of animals and symbols. The former were admired and valued as food supply, while symbols--hand-signs,</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 537 circular hollows, sexual images, perhaps even geometric designs-were usually links with protection and fertil- ity. All this Giedion spells out in great detail. In the more anthropomorphic styles of the early high cultures, the author develops the theme of constancy and change still further. Fertility charms of the Venus of Willendorf type evolve into Neolithic earth-mother idols and thence into the anthropomorphic Goddess images. This process is paralleled in the aesthetic sphere by the shift from outline or contour drawing to island relief and on to sculpture-in-the-round, and from the non-axially governed art of the caves to later space conceptions dominated by the vertical dimension. Archi- tecture, brought into being by this revolution, was necessarily at its beginnings one of plastic solids set in a limitless space. Throughout the more than one thousand pages of text, Giedion stresses the interconnectedness of aesthet- ic, social and psychological phenomena. The absence, in prehistoric art, of monumental sculpture-in-the- round, he believes, expresses a conception of the world as one inseparable whole. Changes in Egyptian sculp- tural technique and space conception are for Giedion intimately bound up with modifications in the social or- der. Yet running contrary to this and of equal impor- tance is the tendency toward stability, survival, con- tinuity. For all the wandering, as he puts it in speaking of the Egyptian world-view, there is always an eternal return. Animal imagery, so significant in the Paleolith- ic age, continues to have meaning in Egypt even down to the Saite period; hollowed-out (or interior) space manipulation dominates architectural thinking from late antiquity until the nineteenth century. So vast and detailed a synthesis as Giedion's beggars comment in a short review. The author has covered an enormous amount of ground, both physically and in- tellectually, in the course of writing his book. Like all syntheses, it suffers from a certain autistic quality: the "truth" emerges from the data with astonishing, and at times tedious, regularity. But this is a small price to pay for what is surely a monument to man and a work that has precisely the characteristics of constancy and change that so engage its author's interest.
