<plain_text><page sequence="1">Abstracts Peter-André Alt: Freuds Exorzismen. Der Teufel in der Psychoanalyse The article refers to the hermeneutic methods of psychoanalysis. It scrutinizes Freud's strategy in transforming traditional myths of the devil into a theory of evil which reveals the dark side of the human soul. Relating to Freud's epis temic construction of metapsychology, it is argued that his hermeneutic system fashions its specific principles of causality, which are stipulated by the theory of libido, in order to reinterpretate the mythology of the devil as a relie left by the unconscious. Freud's argumentation, exemplified in his studies on reli gious superstition, demonstrates the interconnection between mythology and the unconscious. As the devil figures dirt and darkness, he represents distressing thoughts which are repressed and rejected by consciousness. The article is com pleted by a view on C. G. Jung's theory of the archétypes, which considers the evil as part of the preconscious thoughts beyond individual experience.Thus the fundamental différence between Freud's metapsychology and Jung's archétypes is reflected in the interprétation of the devil as a figure, retaining the dark éner gies concentrated in the human soul. Oded Balaban: The Meaning of &gt;Craft&lt; (τέχνη) in Plato's Early Philosophy The aim of craft-analogies in Plato's early dialogues is to put forward a theory of knowledge in which only the content of intentional processes can be known. I will argue that, with this goal in mind, Plato offers an idea of craft that differs from, and is even opposed to the views of his time, as well as to those of our own day, by changing the prevailing définition of craft—from the expertise of means to the expertise of ends. I will address the far-reaching conséquences of this shift. Part 1 will expose what I understand by Plato's approach to craft. Part 2 will ex pose Plato's déniai of the actual existence of the process of knowledge reducing it to its object or reference. Part 3 will address what I think are misinterpreta tions of Plato approach. Part 4 will présent some textual evidence. And in Part 5 I will analyse Plato's shuttle-analogy, the more sophisticated of his craft-analo gies. Finally, I will append a critical note on Terence Irwin's understanding of virtue as craft-knowledge.

With Kant, at the latest, the concept is no longer limited to theological discourse; hence forth, it stands for the humanization of God and world. »Anthropomorphism« marks the line between transcendental philosophy and anthropology and cor relates the transcendental subject with its incarnation in the human body. - The second part which shall examine the history of the concept in the 19th and 20th Century will be published in the next volume of the Archiv für Begriffs geschichte. Rainer Godet G. F. Meiers formaler Vorurteilsbegriff zwischen Universitätsphi losophie und Moralischen Wochenschriften I argue in this article that Georg Friedrich Meier's formai concept of »préju dice« alters within various literary, philosophical, and populär genres and during more than 25 years that he was dealing with the problem. In the German En lightenment, Meier's concept was séminal because he was the first to formalize the concept of préjudice by, on the one hand, demonstrating that it should not be seen simply as a wrong or harmful mental attitude and, on the other hand, by integrating this concept in a theory of préjudice. This article demonstrates that Meier's concept of »préjudice« deals with issues of rationality, of moral theology, and of social pragmatics. His theory, contradictory as it may seem, was décisive for the rehabilitation of préjudices and for the transformation of the discourse in the second half of the 18th Century. Thomas Hecken: Der deutsche Begriff »populäre Kultur« The introduction of the term »populäre Kultur« (populär culture) marks a dé cisive break with the German intellectual past of the years before 1960. Düring this time a harsh critique of the »Massenkultur« (mass culture) ranked among the most important discourses of German columnists, literary authors and aca démie scholars. The new term »populäre Kultur« stems partly back to the posi tively used terms »populär« and »Popularität« of the romantic tradition (Herder, Schiller et al.). Especially many authors of the years 1980ff. who use the term »populäre Kultur« quite frequently embrace the culture of the everyday life or the products of the (former) low culture in a much more complété way than their predecessors.</page><page sequence="3">Abstracts 217 Wolfgang Hiibener(f): »Objektivität« und »Realisierung«. Zwei Beispiele für die Weiterarbeit der Aristotelischen Scholastik am metaphysischen Grundvoka bular Focusing on the notions of »obiectivity« (objectivitas), as it was used by Gabriel Zerbi in the second half of the 15th Century in order to denote the epistemologi cal status of something being an object of knowledge, and »réalisation« (reali zare), as it was coined by the Franciscan Nicolaus Bonetus in the early 14th Cen tury and later taken up by Leibniz as an expression for some kind of bestowal of subsistence (as regarding to the eternal truth in the divine intellect), existence (as regarding to the réalisation of a possible world), or reality (as provided by the »vinculum substantiale«), the article explores two examples of the termino logical working of the aristotelian scholastic tradition on the fundamental vo cabulary of metaphysics. Sebastian Hüsch: Die menschliche Existenz im Spannungsfeld von Möglichkeit und Wirklichkeit. Überlegungen zum Möglichkeitsbegriff bei S. Kierkegaard mit ständiger Rücksicht auf Entweder - Oder This article focuses on Kierkegaard's two-fold use of the catégories of modal ity »possibility« and »reality« in his philosophy of existence. The différence be tween possibility and reality in the works of Kierkegaard is commonly referred to as to the différence between »Denken« and »Sein«, between »Thought« and »Being«. However Either/Or reveals that this dichotomy does only cover one as pect of their use. The other and maybe even more fundamental distinction is that of »possibility« and »reality« as a différence between two modes of &gt;existing&lt;. Julian Pacho: Natürliches Denken und philosophische Erzählung. Zum Begriff des Natürlichen in Hegels Phänomenologie This paper explores the semantics of »natural« (natürlich) in Hegels Phenom enology. The leading question is: What does the word »natural« mean when it refers to experiences and the contents of consciousness in général? Using as semantic material a digital reading of the text, the article analyses the peculiari ties of the uses of the term in each context and studies the onto-epistemological assumptions of the notion of the natural in the target work, bearing in mind the question concerning the Cartesian divide between world and mind. It concludes that the way in which Hegel really narrâtes the natural, at lest as referred to ex periences and consciousness, preserves that Cartesian divide and also a realistic position.</page><page sequence="4">218 Abstracts Andreas Pronay: Was unterscheidet ΰλη von ύποκείμενον? The aim of this essay is to grasp the différence between two concepts typical of Aristotle, Όλη (matter, material, but also an entity which lacks shape and concré tion) and ύποκείμενον (substance, logical subject as well as material). Όλη and ύποκείμενον express eo ipso, essentially and always a relation. These two con cepts have - already since Bonitz' times - been interpreted very controversially. The relevant literature of research (from the middle of the 19th Century until today) is therefore thoroughly expounded in the essay. Because Aristotle déter mines the substance (ουσία) in its relation to the accidentai characteristics, but also the in Όλη its relation to the conceptually compréhensible form (είδος) and also to the feature of concrète definiteness (τόδε τι) by means of the ύποκείμενον itself, the following result ensues: ύποκείμενον is broader in its range of meaning than Όλη.</page></plain_text>
