<plain_text><page sequence="1">Comparative Languages and Literatures: A Not So Wild Idea Charlotte Kendrick Brooks Some years ago, when I was a Fulbright exchange teacher in Birmingham, England, I was forced to come to terms with myself as a kind of minority different from what I had been at home. I was an American teacher, and a black woman, too, teach- ing in a British secondary modern school. The literature was not a very big problem, because I knew some British liter- ature, but my point of view in teaching that lit- erature as well as my stance in teaching his- tory were stumbling blocks. And the text- books supported the British stance, not mine. eThe language differ- ence was greater than I had expected it to be. It differed not only from mine but also from the written and spoken British English I had seen and heard in the United States. My students, primarily from working class homes, spoke "brummagen," or "brummy," as different as cockney to under- stand to my untuned ears. Spellings, grammar, and pronunciation-not to speak of stress, pitch, and juncture-were different. I was a minority of minorities, a very different person in a land unlike mine. (Since that time, with respect to cultural and language differences, I have found myself in that minority role in other lands as well-and even in some of our own states, such as Alaska, North Dakota, and Idaho.) In England I learned (learnt) very quickly to spell color (colour), labor (labour), jewelry (jewel- lery), and many other words; to pronounce labo- ratory (laboratry), clerk (clark), Lord Home (Hume), and a number of other words; to open my American teacher's mind to another view of grammar so I could say, "The team are ready," "He lives in such and such a street"; to talk glibly about nappies, dual carriage ways, running in, and other such British terms; to add to my vocab- ulary gammon, spotted Dick, kippers, and other esoteric (to me) terms. I even learnt to ask my students to revise (review) for their exams. These language learning activities became in my form (class) comparative language studies, for my students kept notebooks in which they wrote synonyms or explanations for their concepts or terms that were new to me, while I learned from them British equivalents for my American con- cepts. I had some of the most attentive classes I have ever taught, for I began by asking students to listen carefully and to watch; then to raise their hands and let me know whenever anything I wrote or said was different. Hands were often in the air. Although I have said that I felt pretty secure about English literature, once on British soil I was not so sure. A "set book"-assigned by the curric- ulum to be read by all second form students like my own 2A (twelve- and some thirteen-year-olds) was Kenneth Grahame's Wind in the Willows. I had read it but did not really understand the setting, did not know the flora and fauna. Students taught me about the plane tree, which I knew as a syca- more; about conkers, which I called chestnuts; and Johnny Bolt brought a hedgehog to school when I made the mistake of saying I'd never seen one. I shared American settings, American stories and poems. We shared comparisons of more 34 English Journal</page><page sequence="2">deeply felt concepts than these, but the differing flora and fauna were safe points of entry to com- plex ideas. I felt quite at ease as I learnt along with my students, and when I returned to my classes here I used comparative approaches with students who used language different from mine for any rea- son. Some used "nonstandard English"; some came from parts of this land with lexical, syntactic or other "different" features. More recently, as I have worked with teachers from school systems with an increasingly diverse student population, I have become convinced that the teaching of Eng- lish for this population must incorporate compar- ative language and literature approaches. Teachers and students alike will then be enabled to see the many likenesses and differences in our cultures as well as the common threads that run through the languages and literatures. E. D. Hirsch may be partly correct in saying that we must help our students know the cultural, historical, and literary heritage of our nation, but he is surely wrong in limiting that heritage to a narrow body of material rooted in Western civili- zation. It may well be that we will open doors to success for minority students if we use some of the approaches of this not so wild idea. As we study the changing demographics of this land, teachers in our classrooms will need to move beyond teaching ethnocentric ideas about our her- itage to sharing more honest facts about other lan- guages and literatures which have contributed to our own. This does not mean that we should neglect Western language and literature, but that we ought to include themes, concepts, and ideas from other sources as well. This should mean that we accept the growing diversity of our population, and that we-teachers and students alike-learn more about our great language variety and our multiethnic literary heritage. Some teachers may say that they are grounded in English and American literature and that they cannot possibly learn more in order to teach more about other cultures. I am suggesting here that much of the information should come from stu- dents or from the community through the stu- dents. Students can interview their elders and older persons in their communities to find out about the cultures of their people. Every culture, for example, has its tricksters: Brer Rabbit, Hare, Raven, Anansi, and Odysseus are some. Alaskan Inuits, Athabaskans, and Tlin- gits have theirs. Most cultures have their flawed heroes, their undecided ones. Shakespeare's Ham- let does not stand alone in indecision-or in the play within a play format. There are other odys- seys and many frameworks for storytelling in addi- tion to Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. Every group has its aphorisms, its folk sayings, many of them alike. Wise fools, anthropomorphic beasts, kind mon- sters, treacherous friends can be searched out and found in the literatures of many cultures. In their efforts to explain strange and awe-inspiring nat- ural events, all peoples have created myths. If stu- dents can find and share their own, and if they can find library books with their own languages and literatures and cultures highlighted, surely they will accept themselves and their cultures, and so will those who work with them. My own personal world is wider, not narrower, because I lived with my Mississippi grandmother and enjoyed grits and red-eye gravy, and much later dined formally at the Cafe Royal in (not on) Regent Street in London and helped to propose a loyal toast to Her Majesty the Queen, with a red- coated footman behind my chair. It is wider because I have heard Russian, Chinese, Scandi- navian, and African children speak to one another in their own languages yet question me in very good English. I have heard students in many lands discuss the poetry of Pushkin, Twain's Huckleberry Finn, Wright's Native Son, and Morrison's The Blu- est Eye. They know their own languages and liter- atures, but they know ours, too. Why should we not expect our own students to do the same? Some years ago, because my own personal and professional experiences taught me that all stu- dents can learn and that some black learners have a potential for learning that must be tapped, I made my 1977 NCTE presidential theme "Work- ing Together to Tap Potential" and spearheaded the publication of an NCTE Black Caucus book, Tapping Potential: English and Language Arts for the Black Learner (1985, Urbana: NCTE). Now I want to move forward on the new wave of demographics, to suggest-as many readers of that work have already said-that the approaches, methods, and materials in Tapping Potential are also useful for other learners as well. Certainly they can be used, even though some may need to be modified for minority learners from other groups. I make this specific suggestion to teachers of all minorities, as well as to teachers who wish to create September 1988 35</page><page sequence="3">a less limited, less western ethnocentric world for all learners: take this wild idea about teaching comparative languages and literature and adapt it to the community in which you teach, wherever in the world it is. Listen to your students and invite them to share their worlds with you. Share yours with them. Learn about their languages as you attempt to teach them yours. Stimulate writing by finding out about students' cul- tural backgrounds. With many, their own names can sometimes be clues. With black students this is not always possible, for most have names given to their enslaved ancestors by persons from the colonizing countries of Europe, but some have African names now, and the reason for the other names can be dis- cussed in its historical context. Ask them to interview family members or friends from within their cul- tures. Elicit aphorisms, folk tales, myths, or fables. Encourage sharing, writing, dramatizing, and listen- ing at all levels. Find common themes in the literatures of many peo- ple. In some areas, it may be easiest-where many minorities live in the area-to focus upon those groups in the vicinity: Inuit and Indians of Alaska; Chicanos in Texas, California, and New Mexico; Cubans and Haitians in Florida; Vietnamese and Cambodians in many places; Koreans and Chinese in some urban areas. Seek the aid of the many sources of information available: librarians who can help to find suitable literary works for all levels of learners; linguists who know about how language has developed and what "standard English" is and is not; historians who can share a view of history unencumbered by the limited ethnocentric vision of some others; folklorists and anthropologists who can open the eyes of teachers and students to the wealth of cultural material avail- able about hitherto misunderstood minorities. Do much of the work of teaching language and lit- erature within historical and geographical contexts. The very thinking skills we wish to foster can be honed in questioning history as it is written and taught. Study maps and globes and discuss who the minorities really are. (Here, the National Geographic magazine is a fine source.) Take old issues of the English Journal and mine them for ideas you can use to investigate and to teach dif- ferences and likenesses among the varying languages and literatures of, for example, the United States. The October 1987 issue contains under Riposte an article about language in Appalachian Studies [Peterson]. Works cited at the end of that article are excellent. The entire March 1988 English Journal deals with language, from a tiny story about a dialect detective in "This World of English" through articles about the English Language Amendment, public doublespeak, and political rhetoric, a consideration (among other things) of the multiple meanings of "hidings" in Robert Hayden's "The Whipping." And finally, there is the editorial comment, "Language and Power." Every bit of the content of this issue is useful, and I could-if I had time or space----cite many others. Look into the research on thinking, reading, writing, and responses to literature, and see where you can make practical applications of what has been learned. Perhaps these suggestions will help, or perhaps teachers will respond to the ideas here and will develop others of their own, better adapted to the communities in which they teach. And even if those communities are without many visible minorities, it is clear that we live in a country made up of many people who have not come here from a Western land. All students, and perhaps especially those who in their elementary- and sec- ondary-school years have had no experiences with minorities, must know that they live in a world in which the once dominant Western civilization is, in fact, the minority one. And their country grows more like the world in that way. These students must study, live, and work with persons from other cultures at some time--certainly, for many, when they get to college-and their lives will be enriched and made easier if they learn attitudes and facts that will enable them to welcome these inevitable experiences. Such students, as well as those from the growing yet not yet thoroughly studied minority groups, must learn of the impor- tant contributions to English language and litera- ture of many other cultures, languages, and literatures. Teachers and students alike, who together rep- resent the remarkable diversity of this land, can work together to know, value, and understand the varying cultures, languages, and literatures which shape and inform the lives of the many citizens who make up America.
