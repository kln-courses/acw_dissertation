Pressurized garment assemblies can be accurately modeled as a cyl- indrical shell under pressure to determine the resulting pressure loads. But, the resulting longitudinal loads are not a complete picture of the load environment. The man induced loads generally act longitudinally and are very often the larger loads the space suit restraint system must withstand. This paper presents the data collected to fill out the human strength data base in the glove area along with a short description of how this data was collected. Also, a des- cription of how this data was used in the design and flight certification of the current Shuttle Extravehicular Mobility Unit space suit is included along with a discussion of techniques to extend this model to include future space suit design. PRESSURE GARMENT MANLOAD understanding has been evolutionary in nature. The early pressure suit design focused on the pressure induced loads as being the larger part of the total load with manloads taking a back-seat. This attitude was accepted in the early stages be- cause Air Force high altitude suits and the Mercury and Gemini garments were basically "sitting" suits with little EVA "work" requir- ed. With the advent of the Apollo program there became a need to perform useful and varied work during EVA, both in-orbit and on the lunar surface. During a 1-g training exercise in an early Apollo suit, astronaut John Young bent at the waist while spreading his legs and bending one knee in an attempt to simulate picking up moon rocks. This motion in- duced a large manload in the crotch restraint system which resulted in a pulley failure. This incident made the space suit world aware of the significance of man-induced loads in space suit operation. The source of this type of loading can be understood by a review of suit design considera- tions. Joint design is driven by a key concept known as "constant volume". That is, to ac- complish constant torque and stability when a joint is flexed, the volume of gas added to the outside of the joint should nearly equal that squeezed out from the inside. Early pressure suit designers, such as Wiley Post (see photo 1), were unaware of this concept and constructed their suits out of straight fabric cylinders re- quiring in excess of 1000 lbf to flex at the waist. Unlike the dexterity required by crew- members Nelson and Van Hof ten in repairing Solar Max (see photo 2); Wiley Post's job was to simply handle a control stick of his airplane in his quest for the world altitude record. Therefore, constant volume joints are essential to maintain human productivity in space. In a constant volume joint there is one axi- symmetric line through the joint where the length remains constant as the motion takes place. The geometry and operation of this type of joint creates a crewmember/suit mismatch for the following reasons: - The path traced out by the end of a suit joint is a spiral in contrast to a circle traced by a human's extremities (see Figure 1 ) . - Human joints bend more sharply than suit joints. - Misalignment of the centers of joint motion between crewmember and suit. Due to these factors, 20% of the current crew- members find that the optimum sizing of the pressure suit is to have the suit arms shorter than their own finger tip to finger tip span dimension. The average astronaut in this situation flies with the suit sized 0.55 inches shorter than their full span dimension. With the suit sized shorter than the person, the person can push out against or 'manload' the suit. These loads act in the axial direction and are additive to the pressure loads which 5.197 0096-736X/86/9405-01 97$02.50 Copyright 1986 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">Photo 1: Wiley Post Pressure Suit Photo 2: Solar Max Repair Mission Increasing volume x rT^i side of joint I i ' r^L f / Decreasing J ) side SPIRAL of joint volume PATH ^ I V ! / &gt; ^ ' /y 1/ / ^ I ! / / r y side of joint V ^ 1/ / ) ^ &gt; / ! r J SPIRAL PATH ! / &gt; /y 1 r_ CONSTANT / ' ^ ļ CIRCULAR PATH FIGURE 1 SUIT SEGMENT VERSUS MAN MOTION 5.198</page><page sequence="3">851334 act in the same direction. DETERMINING MANLOAD VALUES to use in design- ing suit structures is not as easy as determin- ing the pressure load. The pressure load is easily and accurately calculated as simply the pressure times the cross sectional area over which it acts. At the wrist, this load is about 65 lbf maximum at 5.3 psig. Even though the manloads are limited in magnitude by the astro- nauts1 strength, the data contained in human factors literature contains only a small portion of the data needed. Such human strength data measured with the person outside of a space suit constitutes the 'potential1 maximum manload in- puts. These values are significant when compar- ed to the pressure load (i.e., for the wrist area 65 lbf pressure vs. 217 lbf man induced). Although these loads are not often imposed on the pressure suit structure since they constitute a significant effort by the astronaut, they must be accounted for to maintain a safe structural design. In many cases the actual manloads experienced by the suit, which will be referred to as 'limit manloads', are different than the potential manloads. THE PURPOSE of this paper is to describe the potential manload data base, including our addi- tion to it in the glove area. We will discuss the actual maximum manload experienced along with our theory of why these values are differ- ent than the potential manloads. Finally, we will describe the design processes necessary to come to an adequate understanding of the impact of manloads on the structural design of a pressure garment. POTENTIAL MANLOADS Potential manloads, as used in this paper, refers to the maximum human strength capabilities of the strongest expected astronaut. The purpose of identifying these potential values is to pre- dict the maximum axial force induced by the man in any one specific suit restraint path so that a structurally sound crew enclosure can be designed. HUMAN STRENGTH DATA is contained in a large amount of literature from human strength studies, especially in areas related to transportation systems. This data is taken in a shirt-sleeve, 1-g environment and is not often directly appli- cable to the complex man/machine interfaces of a space-suited crewmember. As a result, a search of human strength literature provides a limited number of studied motions which are directly applicable to the "maxstress" motions in a space suit. Arm extension in two planes and leg thrust are the only motions found to be applicable. The strength values for these motions for a 95 percentile size male are listed in Table 1. All other potential manload values must be derived from tests specifically designed and performed to supply information relating to pressure suit design. Table 1. Potential Manloads for 95 Percentile Male [**] Body Motion Potential Manload Arm Push to front 210 lbf (1) Push to side 288 lbf (2) Leg Thrust (push) 494 lbf (1) GLOVE POTENTIAL MANLOADS were determined quantitatively at ILC Dover as part of an advanced glove stress mapping exercise. To de- termine 95 percentile human strength capabilities a test program was initiated in which test sub- jects were asked to push as hard as they could against a 'glove skeleton' which was arranged so that various loading cases could be measured. Twenty-one test subjects were used to accumulate 1381 individual force measurements. The sub- jects were selected to get a representative cross section, both male and female, although predominately male. The strength measurements were taken at various positions of the arm, starting at fully extended and at fore-shortened positions up to 5 inches. The average human strength cannot be used as the manload value for use in design since 50% of the crew population would exceed that value. In line with structural design practice, the average load plus three times the standard de- viation is used as the maximum expected value. These values constitute the potential glove related manloads for the seven loading cases. They are listed in Table 2. A complete descrip- tion of the glove related test data is included in the appendix. Table 2.

A conservative assumption is that the limit manload is the same as the (1 ) Woodson, W. E. (2) Van Cott and Kinkade 5.199</page><page sequence="4">potential manload. But as will be shown below, the actual loads experienced are often lower than the potential manloads. The best docu- mented measurement of limit manloads for a glove occurred during the glove stress mapping activity which occurred at ILC Dover in early 1983. Unfortunately, this test program does not prove our belief that the limit loads are generally lower than the potential loads. At the same time, glove data does not disprove our theory, and does provide the best data base to illustrate the mechanism we believe operates to reduce the limit loads. GLOVE LIMIT MANLOAD test data resulted from the development of a glove incorporating both finger and thumb metacarpal joints. To accom- plish this, a hard palm shell was used to locate and support the pivot mechanisms. The hard nature of the shell provided the opportunity to strain gage the glove and measure the actual loads encountered (see photo 3). This test program included an attempt by the test subject to impart maximum loads into the glove when the suit was sized one inch per arm shorter than his anthropomorphic full span dimension. The results of this maximum stress activity could then be read on strain gages located on the stainless steel pivot mechanisms. Data obtain- ed is directly comparable to four of the loading cases in the potential manload data base des- cribed previously. The initial thought is to compare the test data with the values in Table 2. But, for a valid comparison to be made, the data must be compared with the specific subject's strength data instead of the estimate of maximum strength for the entire human population which is contained in Table 2. If the test data equals the subject's maximum strength, then it must be concluded that the entire potential man- load can be imposed on the glove. This compari- son is shown in Table 3. Three of the four re- sults are within one standard deviation of the mean value of the subject's strength. From these values the only reasonable conclusion is that the limit load is equal to the potential load. The fourth value shows a limit load far in excess of the subject's average strength. This extreme value and observation of the glove during the test lead us to the conclusion that during the test a mechanical advantage mechanism was operating at the wrist gimbal. Since the glove structure was adequate in this area this was an acceptable situation, but it does serve to illustrate the difficulty of making hard and fast rules when dealing with man/machine inter- faces.

Instrumented links were inserted in the cable restraint paths and dynam- ic load levels were measured for a series of suit motions, including the motion used by John Young to gather lunar rocks. From this activity the maximum experienced loads were extracted and used as the limit manloads. This resulted in values of 150 1 bf / restraint for gloves, arms, and shoulders and 300-350 lbf/restraint for lower torso components being established as the Apollo limit manloads. A worst case manload split between parallel restraint paths of 100/0 was assumed in establishing these values. In the late 1970's, the Shuttle space suit design underwent two manload determination efforts. In 1978, a prototype suit was evaluat- ed. Two years later, an extra-large Shuttle suit in a flight like configuration was stress mapped during the certification program to determine the actual maximum manloads (i.e., the limit manloads). The final values selected as specification values from these efforts were the higher load value from either the Shuttle suit stress mapping activity or the previously conducted Apollo suit testing. In most cases the Shuttle suit showed lower loads than the Apollo derived data predicted. A key difference in the Apollo design versus the Shuttle design is that the Apollo suit used braided steel cable for the axial restraints while the Shuttle suit uses polyester webbing. The one exception occurred in the waist where the loads in the Shuttle suit were found to be higher than the Apollo values. These data are summarized in Table 4 which also includes, for comparison purposes, the potential manloads avail- able from the human factors data base. Note that in all cases the test values are below the potential loads. This is main reason for the general perception in the space suit design community that the potential loads are not experienced by the space suit structure. None of the full suit stress mapping activities in- cluded any human strength measurements or any attempt to determine the load splits per re- straint. The suit subjects used were selected for their high strength. MANL0AD/SUIT INTERACTION MECHANISMS The specific interaction of man induced loads with the suit structure is inherently difficult to formulate in light of the wide variation and situation-specific nature of human strength data. In fact, in reference [9], the author warns "that such tabulations cannot provide absolute data, but only indicate trends and orders of magnitude". In lieu of using this data a call for a test program is made. Invariably, the results of the test program show actual manload inputs into the suit at levels which are signifi- cantly below the 'potential manloads' garnered from published strength data. But where did the manloads go? That is really the central question that motivated this paper. Several mechanisms are at play here, some of which can lead to a false sense of security. These mechanisms are: 1. Alternate load paths or load sharing; a significant factor with all fabric configuration suit systems. Table 4.

Test inputs being at values other than 95% values. 3. The restraint line acting like a spring and preventing the load from being induced. These mechanisms will be discussed in detail in what follows. LOAD SHARING is possible when there are alternate load paths available besides the pri- mary load paths. In a pressure suit the load path is down the axial restraint lines located to each side of the joint. In the area of a joint near the restraint line termination, the restraint material, which is there to prevent circumferential deformation of the suit, is also capable of carrying longitudinal loads. This is not true in the flexible part of a joint in general since in the flexible area the circum- ferential restraint fabric has folds which allow for the expansion necessary to maintain a con- stant volume. But there is nothing to prevent the axial load from spreading out from the restraint line into the circumferential restraint material where there are no folds. The axial restraints are firmly connected to the circum- ferential restraint material to prevent the joint from becoming unstable due to the shifting centers of pressure when the joint element is flexed. Since previous test methods measured loads at the restraint line termination, the potential for significant amounts of load by- passing the measurement exists. This is a situation which could lull you into believing the manloads are not being induced into the suit when, in fact, the entire potential load is in- deed being carried by the total suit structure. TEST INPUTS during a manned overstress test may be at some value other than the 95 percentile values the potential manloads are based on, mak- ing the experienced manloads look smaller than the potential manloads. The way an overstress test is run is that a large, strong subject is selected, the suit is sized smaller than the subject, and he attempts to put maximum loads into the suit by following a test plan of motions which allow him to bend and stretch as required. The concern here is that there is no 95 percen- tile man, any human which is 95 percentile in one area may not be at the high end in other areas. The only complete defense for this situation in suit design is to know the strength capabilities of your subject and how they relate in every area to the 95 percentile for the human population. Then, when the load is measured in the suit, it can be compared against the subject's strength. If the load equals the subject's average strength, then the full potential manload for the human population can be imposed on the suit. If it is less than the subject's average strength, then some mechanism that limits the full manload from being imposed is operating. One potential mechanism is suit sizing. The amount the suit is sized shorter than the subject for test purposes, cannot be arbitrary. It must be sized in relationship to the subject's body such that he can exert his maximum force. Just sizing it as short as possible so that he can still get into the suit is not acceptable. It is possible to be off of the subject's peak capability and to end up believing the manloads are not there when they can be significantly larger than the measured loads with a small change in suit sizing. THE ELASTIC SPRING concept is the only mechanism that can prevent the full potential manload from being induced on the suit structure. The axial restraint line acts like a spring and the human strength capability decreases as the extremity exerting the force lengthens. There- fore, at some point the suit will elongate under load to such a length that no more manload can be induced. A graphic illustration of this concept is presented in Figure 2 for the glove/arm com- ponents. The 95 percentile potential manload and suit subject's strength capabilities as a function of arm length less than full span are represented by the two curves. The composite spring rate for the arm in this test was 142 lbf/in. and is depicted in Figure 2 as a straight line.

Elastic Spring Mechanism 5.202</page><page sequence="7">851334 206 lbf. In this situation, as the subject attempts to load the suit, it will start to stretch and its performance as a spring is de- picted by the composite spring rate line. Both the subject and the suit are no longer operating at the 1 inch short position. As loading con- tinues the subject moves down his strength curve and the suit moves up the spring rate curve until the curves cross where an equilibrium is reached. With this mechanism in play the test load would be 80 lbf and the limit load would be 124 lbf as compared to the 206 lbf potential load. Since spring rate is a function of suit construction and potential manloads are situation specific, each loading case must be investigated independently to assess the validity of this mechanism. DESIGN LOAD DETERMINATION A sample design load case is illustrated be- low to show how the limit manload is used in the design calculations. The assumptions and cal- culation procedures presented are typical for all restraint paths; the glove wrist is used in the example. Limit manload: 217 lbf (taken as 100% of the potential load from Table 3 for flat hand case since there is no verified spring mechanism operating in the current glove) . Pressure load: 55 lbf (4.4 psi * 12.5 sq. in.). The glove wrist contains parallel restraint paths to carry these loads. The pressure load is even- ly split between each restraint path and the man- load is assumed to be split 70/30. Such a load split factor must be supported by test data, otherwise a 100/0 split must be assumed. The total load expected to be imposed on any one re- straint path is: Manload = 217 * 0.7 (load split factor = 152 lbf Pressure load = 55 * 0.5 (load split factor) = 28 lbf 180 lbf For softgoods design a safety factor of 2.0 is used since softgoods do not exhibit ductile be- havior but act more like brittle materials. Assuming polyester restraint lines are used a safety factor Of 2.0 applies, therefore the design load is then: Design load = 2.0 * 180 = 360 lbf For softgoods this value is taken as the minimum ultimate strength allowed for the restraint line. For hardware components which are in the re- straint path, a safety factor of 1.5 is used and the resulting value is compared with the material yield strength. The yield limit is used because any sifnigicant deflections could affect joint operation. MANLOAD DETERMINATION GUIDELINES Guidelines for determining manloads for any specific suit configuration are presented in what follows. These recommendations are based on the lessons learned from the several experi- mental analyses conducted by NASA and ILC Dover over the past fifteen years. Besides being dollar limited, the real world situation with respect to the specificity of human strength capability makes it impossible to test every possible motion case. Sound, carefully consider- ed engineering judgment salted with as much ex- perience as you can get your hands on is the only guide available in the final analysis. The first task is to try to get a handle on the human strength capabilities applicable to the design. Deciding what is applicable is not a trivial problem. The motions utilized in the current space suit certification program are a place to start, but the kind and type of work be- ing performed must be considered. The motions used in certification are based on 0-g and lunar surface scientific activities. If your design is to be used for mining on the lunar surface you had best think hard about the applicable activ- ities. This is somewhat of a chicken and egg problem because there is an interaction between the mobility of the suit, the gravity enviorn- ment, and the crewpersons' natural motions which can generate motions which are specific to the particular application. The method of picking up rocks which John Young used is a case in point. Once you have picked a set of design reference motions, a search of the human factors data base is in order just on the off chance some researcher in that field has been interested in a similar problem. Where data is not avail- able, a test program of a representative popula- tion of subjects should be conducted to determine the potential manloads. To be useful, the test program must cover the range of joint geometries that the suit sizing interactions will allow and have sufficient subjects to give good estimates of the mean and standard deviation. The test data collected must be guided by the eventual tested configuration of the full up suit. For example, in the glove situation the four finger and three finger crotch data were directly com- parable to the finger pivot mechanism forces. If that data had not been collected the strain gag- ing would have been useful to get the values of loads on the pivots, but no comparison could have been made to help in establishing limit manloads. Once the human strength data base is available, barring mechanical advantage amplifications which are controllable by design, the problem is bound- ed; therefore, the restraint path strength can be compared against these numbers. If the design can accommodate these loads without compromise to suit performance acceptance of the potential manloads as the limit manloads are made. A stress mapping exercise conducted on a "flight like" prototype is the next step. Keep 5.203</page><page sequence="8">in mind the spring rates of the load path affect the manloads induced into the suit elements so the suit must be high fidelity. The test subject must be selected to fit the suit and possess relatively high potential strength. But no per- son is 95 percentile in every area so the sub- ject's strength capability in all of the motion cases must be tested. By the very nature of the test program being run, the test subject is the manload "gage". Whatever percentage of his man- loads experienced by the suit during the stress mapping is the percentage of the potential man- loads the suit can be expected to experience in the use environment. Ideally, the subject strength tests will be accomplished over a two week period pretest and a two week period post test so that a firm understanding of his capa- bilities are known. Careful selection of the instrumentation points of the suit to match the available base of subject and population strength data is required. The strain gaging can also be used to verify component stress analysis assump- tions if placed properly. Dynamic strain gage data acquisition systems are the most applicable of all experimental analysis techniques for man- load determination. Where hardgoods are avail- able for gaging, they should be used. When that is not the case, the accepted practice is to in- stall a metal link into the restraint path upon which the gages are installed. The design of these links is far from arbitrary. Links must be large enough to respond accurately to an anticipated maximum load and as small as possible to reduce the effects of added stiffness to the restraint path. The pretest calibration exercise must be configured to reproduce actual component loading as close as possible. Gage placement should be in pairs, connected in series, to eliminate bending effects. Simultaneous readout of parallel restraint path gages is necessary to determine manload splits during the test. The test must be designed to include representative task simulations to determine everyday manload values if fatigue considerations are a possi- bility and to determine load splits. The test must also include specific maximum stress activities designed so that limb and body posi- tions permit the subject to exert maximum force into the suit components. After the testing is complete, the subject's test values are compared with his strength data to determine the percentage of the potential load to use as the limit manload. The parallel load path splits are determined and used as a guide- line to determine the design load values. The design load values are compared with restraint path strength data obtained by test. If the required safety factor is maintained, the design is acceptable from a strength standpoint. If not, redesigns are required and a stress mapping retest must be performed, since any significant alteration of suit stiffness will affect the limit manloads. RECENT EXPERIENCE WITH THIS METHOD was obtained in the design of an improved mobility glove for the Space Shuttle program. The glove uses significantly lighter weight fabric in its construction to allow the addition of more finger pleats, hence increased dexterity. The potential manloads were used as limit load values since the reduction mechanism described above was not well understood or demonstrated in the test data. Test samples of the glove elements (i.e., fingers, thumb, and palm) were sewn to- gether and their strength determined by pull test. The final design was certified by these element tests. But during the development an early thumb area seam was not strong enough to meet the requirements in this manner. As part of the development effort to overcome that prob- lem, a complete glove was manufactured and tested with a subject whose strength exceeded the 95 percentile human strength level. The glove was tested on the same test set up as was used to obtain the human strength measurements. During that test the thumb seam which failed under the unmanned test passed without problems. The manload being induced was the same as the value being used in the element test as was verified by the force gage in the test set up. Apparently, the full up glove was load sharing and relieving the stress on the critical seam. For this reason, the element tests are consider- ed conservative. Had the repatterning of the seam failed to pass the element test, we would have considered certifying the glove by the manned test method. Our next option, had even the system level test failed, was to purposely change the spring rate of the restraint system. This could be done by including springs in the restraint path which could be preloaded so that they did not deflect under the pressure loads, but would deflect under the manloads limiting the maximum load to an acceptable level. This was not necessary and is not a preferred path since it adds considerable bulk and complexity. But that path is open if the mobility trade-off is favorable enough to make it viable. Also, during this effort a good knowledge of the spring rates of the suit arms was available. This is the best position to be in with respect to glove design, and is the reason the glove design effort should follow the suit arm develop- ment effort. With the potential of higher oper- ating pressures, future systems may have stiffer restraints which may require control of the re- straint path spring rate to allow the glove design the flexibility to follow the most marvelous of mechanisms, the human hand.

The load was transmitted via a cable to a recording force gage (Figure A-l). The loading cases evaluated were: 1) Full Flat Hand - Hand against a flat surface roughly perpendicular to the load direction; representative of the loads in the wrist part of a glove. 2) Five Fingers - Five fingers in glove tips so that all fingers share load equally; simulates having the glove fingers all shorter than the persons fingers. 3) Four Fingers - The same as (2) except the thumb is not loaded. 4) Thumb - Thumb in a glove tip and all other parts of the hand unloaded; simulates the thumb of the glove be- ing shorter than the persons thumb. 5) Four Finger Crotches - Slightly padded cord arranged to load all of the finger crotches uniformai ly; simulates the glove fingers all longer than the persons fingers. 6) Three Finger Crotches - The same as (5) except the thumb crotch is not loaded. 7) Thumb Crotch - Again, same as (5) ex- cept only the thumb crotch is loaded. The subject's upper body was supported to provide a load path that did not involve leg strength, since this was believed to be most representative of the loading case in the pres- sure suit. The ability of the subject to load the test rig was tested for various positions of the arm. One reading was taken where the subject had extended the arm to the comfortable full span. Subsequent readings were taken at positions 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, 1 inch, etc., shorter than the subject's full span dimension. In the early part of the test program, the data was taken all the way down to 5 inches shorter than full span. But, a parallel review of field siz- ing data showed most actual suit users ended up with their suit sized not much more than two inches (one inch per arm) shorter than full span. Later test measurements were taken to concentrate the data in this range. The number of test points at the various dimensions varies as a result of this change in focus as under- standing increased with time. Consideration was also taken of subject fatigue, so that the number of measurements taken in any one session were limited or the measurements were spread out. Twenty-one test subjects were used to accumulate 1381 individual force measurements. Figure A-l. Potential Manload Test Apparatus The subjects were selected to get a representa- tive cross section, both male and female, al- though predominately male. The results of these measurements are shown in Table A-l. The average measured load (x bar), the estimate of the standard deviation(s) , and the number of test points (N) are tabulated for the seven loading cases against the amount the hand was drawn back from full span. All data was taken for the right arm. During a manned suit test program that was ongoing at the same time, test subjects reported they could load the arms more by pushing more directly out in front, rather than off to the side as was done during testing with the glove skeleton test method. To verify this new factor, 370 additional force measurements were made us- ing the glove skeleton, but with the test sub- ject having his back against the support, rather than his shoulder. Statistical tests were run to compare the back supported data with the shoulder supported data and no significant sta- tistical difference could be found. Conse- quently, the 370 data points were averaged into 5.206</page><page sequence="11">851334 Table A-l.

Analysis of this test data reveals some interactions which are important to the design and operation of space suits. When the data is plotted (see Figure A-2 as an example), it is apparent that load increases as the amount of the suit is shortened and increased. For this reason, a sizing requirement was establish- ed to keep the suit sizing within two inches of the full span dimension, and thereby limit the maximum manload input into the suit gloves. Although the data is not linear, it can be well represented by a least squares straight line fit in the range from the full span dimen- sion to the shortened two inches per arm point if the data where N is greater than 10 are used for the curve fits. These linear curve fits are plotted in Figure A-2 for the flat hand case and in Figure A-3 for the remaining loading cases tested. An interesting aspect shown in Figure A-3 is the various slopes of the straight lines. They vary from 93 lbf/in. for the full flat hand case, to 18.4 lbf/in. for the four fingers case. This wide variation is unexpected in light of the fact that the same muscles are involved (i.e., those of the arm and shoulder) in all cases. As one tries to push maximally with straight fingers, the limit is not strength, but the feeling that your fingers are about to 'buckle' as if they were a column. When one pushes maximally with the finger or thumb crotch, the effort is pain limited. It is suspected these factors account for the variation of slope in the data with the full flat hand data being the truly strength limited case. □ □ / Q Flat Hand 3QQ _ Of Loading Case / [M] = 93 [S] + 113 / (Least Squares Fit) 200 _ 7 Hill - I *• 38 ~ - I *• u n Avg. plus three std. deviations 8 8 38 ~ n u 31 18 38 Il I I I 1 1 1 1 1 Full i 1 2 3 4 5 Span [S] Suit Sizing (inches per arm shorter than subject's full span) Figure A-2.
