Goldthorpe, On Sociology: Numbers, Narratives, and the Integration of Research and Theory. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000. 337 pp. Which Rational Action Theory for Future Mainstream Sociology: Methodological Individualism or Rational Choice Theory? In the following remarks on John Goldthorpe's book On Sociology^ I had to put aside many issues I would have liked to discuss: for example, social mobility and educational inequalities; or the relationship between history and sociology, an important issue already implicitly raised by Tocqueville in the very first sentence of his great book in comparative sociology, The Old Regime: 'Ceci n'est pas un livre d'histoire' ('This is not a book of history'). On two general crucial points I can only say that I totally agree with Goldthorpe: that contemporary sociol? ogy often gives the impression of having forgotten that explaining social phenomena ? preferably challenging and interesting ones - is its main goal, and that sociologists often use the word theory in a sense which has little to do with its meaning in well-established scientific disciplines. Contrary to what grand theorists seem to believe, theory con- struction amounts to more than devising a few overarching concepts. Grand theorists like to associ- ate themselves with Durkheim and Weber. But while Weber and Durkheim undoubtedly created impor? tant concepts, they did much more. They proposed convincing explanations for a number of intriguing phenomena in various areas: magical and religious beliefs, variations in the rates of suicide, etc. Having thus expressed my frustration at not being able to develop these and other points in the present con? text, I will devote my comments especially to some of the main points of Chapters 5 and 6 of On Sociology: those dealing with Rational Action Theory (RAT). I agree that RAT is a better expression than RCT (Rational Choice Theory): action is a broader con? cept than choice, since many actions do not have the form of a choice among alternatives. I also agree that there are many RATs, contrary to the wide- spread view that the version borrowed from economics (which I continue to call RCT below) is the only one. It seems to me that this point is one of Goldthorpe's most important. The three-dimen- sional typology which he proposes in order to introduce some order among the RATs is also very illuminating. Some types of RAT have stronger rationality requirements than others; some focus on procedural, others on situational rationality; some claim to provide a general, others a special the? ory of rationality. I am not sure, though, that these three dimen? sions are independent of one another, as the orthogonal axes of the three-dimensional graph illustrating the typology seem to imply. For the stronger the requirements ofa model on rationality, the less likely it is to be general; and, the more general a model, the greater the necessity for it to take the situational parameters into account when it is applied to concrete cases. Hence, the dominant dimension among the three identified by Goldthorpe might well be the rationality require? ments. Considering the systems of axioms used by actual theories belonging to the RAT family, one can iden- tify a scale of increasing complexity or decreasing generality. Some rest exclusively on three postulates: that any sociological explanandum is the effect of individual attitudes, actions, or beliefs (postulate Pl: individualism); that the meaning to the individual of his actions, attitudes, and beliefs can in principle be retrieved by the observer (P2: understanding, Verste- hen); that this meaning is the cause of the attitudes, actions, or beliefs of the individual, or, in a some- what more restricted formulation, that individuals believe what they believe and do what they do, essen- tially because they have strong reasons for so believing or doing (P3: rationality). If we agree that 'meaning' is not synonymous with 'reasons', since action also has an affective dimension, these three postulates provide a definition of 'Methodological Individualism' (MI), the core of 'comprehensive sociology' (in Weber's sense). At any rate, MI says D Oxford University Press 2001</page><page sequence="2">452 REVIEW SYMPOSIUM no more about rationality requirements. To these postulates, others can be added, for instance: that the reasons considered by actors always deal with the effects of their actions (P4: consequentialism). Taken together, the four postulates Pl to P4 define an important class: the instrumental or consequen- tial RATs. One can moreover assume that, among the effects of their actions, actors are exclusively interested in those which have an actual or potential impact on themselves, either directly or through their environment (P5: egoism). One can further assume that, in all circumstances, actors choose among alternatives with determined costs and bene? fits and select the alternative with the most favourable cost-benefit balance (P6: CBB). Taken together, postulates Pl to P6 define the RCT in the usual sense. All these postulates leave aside the con- tent of the interests of the actors and treat it as external to the explanandum. One can introduce further restrictions in this respect and assume, for instance, that actors feel concerned exclusively by the extent to which an action leads to outcomes max- imizing the satisfaction of their 'will to power' (P7: Niet^schean postulate of the 'Wille zur Macht') or of their class interests (P8: Marxian postulate). Alterna? tive restrictions could of course be included, e.g. that people are moved by envy (Ranulf), vanity (La Rochefoucauld), or a need to imitate (Tarde). I men- tion these latter assumptions, because modern sociologists sometimes pour their new wine into these old bottles. Examples can be used to illustrate these various types of RAT. Weber explains that, in the Roman Empire, the Mithraic or the Christian faiths were more influential among the centurions and the civil servants than among the peasants, because the for? mer had strong reasons to find monotheistic and the latter polytheistic religions an acceptable repre- sentation of the forces leading the world. These reasons were clearly not instrumental, but 'cogni- tive'. So, Weber's analysis uses postulates Pl to P3 exclusively. Theories belonging to what sociologists call 'functional analysis' use postulate P4, besides Pl to P3. For example, most people believe that selec? tive recruitment to an organization pursuing given goals (a factory, a supermarket, a football team, an academy, etc.) is a good thing, since otherwise the goals would be endangered. This collective belief rests on consideration of the positive effects of the selection process. We have no need for the egoism postulate P5 here, since the same collective belief would appear whether or not respondents had an interest in the organization: a freelance worker or a retired person would understand and accept the idea that a supermarket selects its employees. Postulates Pl to P6, which define 'classicaP RCT, as we may call it, is easily illustrated: I look to the right and the left before crossing the street, in order to maximize my chance of not being run over by a car. Postulates Pl to P7, and/or P8 characterize explanations palatable notably to some postmodern writers. Thus, Feyera- bend explained Galileo's influence by his Wille zur Macht and the cleverness with which he defended his theses. This scale of models, from Methodological Indi- vidualism (Pl to P3), to, say, neo-Nietzschean (Pl to P7) or neo-Marxian (Pl to P6, plus P8) models helps clarify some of the questions raised by Goldthorpe. On the question as to which theories are general or not, it can be said, first, that the more restrictive the postulates, the less general the theory. If a set of pos? tulates gives birth to types of theory of which it can be shown that they cannot be general, a type of the? ory with more restrictive requirements will have a fortiori to be considered as special. Now, instrumen- tal models (Pl to P4) cannot be general, as result of the fact that postulate P4 is inadequate in situations where actors are not concerned primarily with the outcomes they produce. Thus, endorsing a theory on some issue is an action. But this action is not undertaken because it generates some effect; more precisely, the only effect the individual looks for in this circumstance is to fulfil a goal: finding the proper answer to the issue. When Pascal rejects Des- cartes's notion that nature would have an horror vacui (would abhor a vacuum), he does so, not because he wants to produce some outcome, such as leaving his name in the history of science, say, but because he thinks the Cartesian notion is demolished by his own grande experience. His rejection is a teleological action, i.e. an action guided by a goal, but it is not an instrumental one. Another example is found in the fact many people are opposed to the death pen- alty, not because they think their opinion would have any influence on its abolition, nor because, say, this would enhance their status, but because this institution appears to them as incompatible with principles they value highly Hence, the class</page><page sequence="3">REVIEW SYMPOSIUM 453 of instrumental models (Pl to P4) does not provide a general theory Afortiori, the RCT, i.e. the RAT in the version Pl to P6, cannot be general. On this point, I agree entirely with Goldthorpe, though I propose here an alternative way of reaching the same conclusion. Consequently, I also endorse his view that the conception of rationality included in RCT (postu? lates Pl to P6) cannot be the most useful one for sociology. Postulate P4 makes it impossible for RCTcorrectly to explain phenomena generated by non-instrumental actions (such as endorsing a belief). Postulate P5 introduces a further restriction. It is clearly inadequate in actions where individuals do not have a direct interest in an issue but neverthe- less may feel deeply concerned by it. In September 2000, in several big cities around the world, people were invited to contribute to the construction of a heap of shoes as a protest against the use of person- nel mines. Many people responded to the invitation in order to express their negative feeling about per- sonnel mines, even though they were not and were unlikely ever to be directly threatened by them. Clearly, the egoism postulate is not relevant here. RCT believers would possibly try to salvage the gen- erality of postulate P5, though, and would, for instance, suppose that the 'reaPgoal of these people was, say, to enhance their self-image. But, as it would be arbitrary to claim that apparently disinterested actions should always be interpreted as pharisaic, the burden of proof in such cases would be on the side of RCT: scientific deontology would in other words require from RCTheorists that they demon- strate either that these people were actually pharisaic, or, alternatively, that they were in a state of 'false consciousness', and why they were so. Models grounded on postulates Pl to P4 (instru? mental models) and afortiori Pl to P6 (classical RCT) on the whole fail to explain satisfactorily an impress- ive number of social phenomena or produce explanations which have an arbitrary feel. They can? not explain voting in a satisfactory way, for the obvious reason that a single vote has no effect on the outcome of a poll. How could a model including the consequentialist postulate P4 be relevant here? Again, RCT believers could contend that people are interested, not in the effect of their vote on the outcome, but, say, in the fact that they feel better once they have voted, because they have a need to express their opinion. But where does this 'need' come from and why is it unevenly distributed across people and elections? Instrumental models also fail to explain the reaction ofthe public against corrup- tion. In Western Europe or North America the effects of corruption on the well-being of people are negligible. Nevertheless, corruption gives rise to strong public reactions. Not long ago, as opinion surveys have shown, the Spanish and French gov- ernments were dismissed by voters mainly because they were perceived as having failed to combat cor? ruption actively enough. People reacted, not to the effects of corruption on themselves, which they would have been unable to perceive, but because corruption contradicts the basic principle that pub? lic offices cannot be used to generate undeserved private benefits. Instrumental models and RCT in particular fail before many other phenomena. Plagi- arism in most circumstances has no negative effects on anybody and can even enhance the fame of the plagiarized, but it nevertheless generates strong negative reactions. Instrumental models are unable to explain even the general collective negative reac? tion against stealing, as Mandeville and Marx have shown. While a given theft has obvious negative effects on its victim, stealing can generate collective positive effects and hence appear as desirable to many people. Thieves contribute to the benefit of many - lawyers, locksmiths, and insurance compa? nies flourish; lower-class people can obtain stolen goods at low prices, etc. This ironic analysis suggests (and here I stop fol? lowing Marx) that stealing is universally considered bad less because of its consequences than because it contradicts the principle that, in general, one should not get a reward without having offered a corre- sponding contribution. So, people have strong reasons to react against corruption, plagiarism, or robbery. But these reasons are not primarily conse- quential (a point well recognized by Durkheim); rather they deal with the fact that the corrupt civil servant, the plagiarist, or the thief violates basic principles of social organization. In the same way, people vote because they consider democracy a good regime, hold its institutions to be legitimate, and consequently consider that they should vote - except where they have the impression that, say, no real issue is at stake or that the proposed alternatives are unpalatable to them. To this non-instrumental</page><page sequence="4">454 REVIEW SYMPOSIUM form of rationality a generic name can be given: cog- nitive rationality. As to the case where a set of reasons leads to a normative conclusion, it identifies an important type of rationality: axiological, or, if Latin is preferred to Greek, evaluative rationality. I do not see why sociologists should not pay atten? tion to distinctions repeatedly recognized by philosophers as well as by classical sociologists. Thus, Rescher (1995: 26) states:'... rationality is in its very nature teleological and ends-oriented', mak- ing immediately clear that 'teleological' should not be made synonymous with 'instrumental' or 'conse- quentiaP. He goes on: 'Cognitive rationality is concerned with achieving true beliefs. Evaluative rationality is concerned with making correct evalua- tion. Practical rationality is concerned with the effective pursuit of appropriate objectives'. By creat- ing his notion of 'axiological rationality' or 'evaluative rationality' (Wertrationalitat) as comple- mentary to, but essentially difTerent from 'instrumental rationality' (Zweckrationalitdt), Weber clearly supported the thesis that rationality can be non-instrumental, in other words that rationality is a broader concept than instrumental rationality and afortiori than the special form of instrumental ration? ality (Pl to P6) postulated by RCT. Schutz introduced a distinction between Wo%u- and Weil- motivations, whereby he wanted to stress, as Weber did, that an individual can act as he does either because he follows some goal or because he agrees with some principles or values. As Adam Smith's notion of the 'impartial spectator' implies, people may have strong opinions even on issues which are unconnected with their interests. Individual opin? ions are not all dictated by private interests; they can also be inspired by impersonal reasons. As it ignores this point, RCT has little to say on public opinion, a major social and political force. Weber's 'axiological rationality' is often under- stood as synonymous with 'value conformity'. My own interpretation may be generous, but I would suggest rather that it refers to prescriptive beliefs which are grounded in the mind of social actors on systems of reasons. Incidentally, Goldthorpe is right when he mentions that, for Weber, those who evaluate a situation from an instrumental point of view can perceive as irrational those who evaluate it on the basis of axiological reasons. When Western democracies pressed South Africa to abolish apartheid, some argued that this would likely pro? duce disastrous effects and treated the opponents of apartheid as dreamers: being instrumentally rational, they saw as irrational those who evoked axiological reasons. Their fears appeared later to have some foundation, as South Africa has experi- enced an impressive increase in its rates of criminality But world public opinion to a large extent supported pressure on South Africa to abol- ish apartheid, because the axiological reasons in favour of abolition were perceived as stronger than the instrumental reasons militating against it. While many of those directly involved were hostile to abolition, those who formed public opinion around the world, being in the position of the 'impartial spectator', were more strongly influenced by axiolo? gical reasons: how can the rights of people depend on ascriptive factors, such as the colour of one's skin, if one assumes as valid the principle of the equal dig- nity of all human beings? So, axiological and instrumental reasons can con- flict with one another, a point already recognized by Sophocles. But there are also cases where they are convergent or where one dominates the other. When people have no direct involvement but are concerned with an issue, they tend to give more weight to axiological than to instrumental consid- erations; they behave as 'impartial spectators' rather than partial actors. In the same way, the voter who is aware that his ballot paper has no discernible effect on the outcome of an election but still votes will pos- sibly be perceived as irrational by those who are guided by instrumental reasons, while the voter sim- ply ranks the axiological reasons for voting higher than the instrumental reasons for refraining from voting. Another example is provided by the decline in infant mortality, that has added to the 'vicious cir- cle of poverty' in poor countries; but in spite of this powerful negative effect, almost nobody would hes- itate to regard this decline as a good thing. When infant mortality is artificially increased, as in China today, it has to be done in a clandestine way so as to conceal it from the impartial spectator. In other words, in this instance axiological reasons dominate over consequential reasons in the minds of most people. One of the grounds of the scientific appeal of RCT, as Goldthorpe, following Hollis and Coleman, states, is that 'rational action is its own explanation'.</page><page sequence="5">REVIEW SYMPOSIUM 455 It produces final explanations, without any black boxes. But it should also be recognized, as Goldthorpe does, that not only RCT but also the other RATs can make the same claim. However, if one wants to avoid black boxes, Popper's thesis that all beliefs should be held as rational should not lead one to treat them as mere data, abandoning any effort to explain why people endorse them. We cannot be satisfied, for example, with saying that Roman cen- turions and peasants were equally rational when they were attracted respectively by monotheism and polytheism. We also want to explain why, and can do so: peasants have been resistant to monothe? ism because they found it hard to believe that the capricious character of natural phenomena could be generated by a unique will possessing a certain degree of coherence. Cumgrano salis, it can be stated that Roman peasants were Popperian or Festingerian avant la lettre: they felt little attraction to the idea of exchanging their old polytheism for the new mono? theism that appeared at the beginning of the Roman Empire because they were reluctant to accept a theory which appeared to them as incompatible with observed data; they felt uncomfortable with the con- tradiction between the idea of a unique coherent will and, say, the whims of the weather, a factor of utmost importance to their daily activities. To the Roman civil servant or centurion who served a centralized, hierarchical empire, by contrast, the idea of a world governed by a unique will is more palatable than the old polytheism. The two groups were equally rational, but, once we have understood their reason- ing, we can get rid of all black boxes and explain a puzzling macroscopic fact: that monotheistic reli- gions, such as the Mithraism or Christianity, easily penetrated the Roman empire through the civil servants and the centurions, generating huge macro? scopic effects which are still with us. On one point, I feel less in agreement with John Goldthorpe: when he urges sociologists to define the criteria of rationality Immanuel Kant wrote (in his Critique ofPure Reason) that looking for criteria of truth amounts to trying to milk a male goat. It should effectively be recognized with Popper that there are no general criteria of truth, but also, against him, that there are not even general criteria of falsity It is true that a theory should be congruent with observed data, but if a theory fails against data, it does not necessarily mean that it is false. It can also on many occasions be reconciled with data thanks to minor adjustments or auxiliary assumptions. It will be considered as false only from the moment when a definitely better alternative theory will be found. Priestley had strong reasons for believing that the phlogiston theory was true, but it became difficult to follow him after Lavoisier had shown that all the phenomena Priestley had explained thanks to his phlogiston could be explained without it. A theory such as Huygens's theory ofthe pendulum is consid? ered as true, not only because it correctly predicts the movement of all pendulums in all circumstances, but also because we accept its non-empirical state- ments: that the movement of the pendulum is produced by certain forces; that one of the forces attracts the pendulum towards the centre of the earth; that these forces combine with one another according to the rule ofthe 'parallelogram of forces', etc. As these statements are not empirical, we do not endorse them on the basis of Popper's falsification criterion. We accept them because these constructs are useful for explaining many other mechanical phenomena; because they have been selected in the course of the complex processes making up the his? tory of physics. In other words, we hold a theory as true or false because we have strong reasons for con- sidering it as such, but there are no general criteria for the strength of a system of reasons. We know that the reasons why Pascal rejected the idea that nature would have an horror vacui are stronger than those why Descartes accepted it, and can explain why this is so. Pascal showed that we can account for the height reached by quicksilver in a tube put upside down in a cup filled with quicksilver by making it the effect of the weight of the atmosphere, an empirical notion more easily acceptable than the purely conjectural and anthropomorphic notion of the horror vacui', we accept the idea that this weight is lighter on the top of a tower, and that this is why quicksilver climbs less high there, while the Carte- sian theory fails to explain this variation. In other circumstances, the relative strength of alternative systems of reasons will correspond to other types of criteria. More generally, if we were to assume for a moment that general criteria of truth or rationality could be identified, the next question would be: on which principles do you ground the criteria? And so on adinfinitum.</page><page sequence="6">456 REVIEW SYMPOSIUM To make my point compact: a system of reasons can be stronger or weaker than another and we can explain why; but it cannot be said to be strong or weak in an absolute sense. As with all evaluative notions, truth and rationality are 'ordinal', not 'cardi- naP; they are comparative, not absolute notions (a point well identified by Simmel). A theory is never true or false, but truer or falser than another. We con? sider it true from the moment when we find it hard to imagine a better theory. As to the criteria mobil- ized to decide that a system of reasons is stronger than another, they are drawn from a huge reservoir and vary from one question to another. Borrowing examples from the history of science has the advantage of clarifying the discussion about the criteria of rationality. But the conclusion to be drawn from these examples (that there are no general criteria of rationality) applies, not only to scientific beliefs but to 'ordinary' beliefs as well. The Descartes-Pascal example, and also the peasant?centurion example, invite us to coin the notion of 'contextual rationality'. Descartes, Pascal, Priestley, Lavoisier, the centurions, and the Roman peasants had all strong reasons to believe what they believed, but were located in different contexts (I take this word in a very broad and abstract sense). Descartes was not irrational when he believed that nature abhors a vacuum. Given what he knew, one can understand why he believed what he believed. To us, though, given what we know, the notion of the horror vacui easily appears ridiculous. We know that the reasons of the centurions and of the peasants were strong to them and are able to understand these reasons, though the reasons of the former are differ? ent from the reasons of the latter. Of course, 'contextual rationality' should not be interpreted as implying any relativism: given the present state of human knowledge, Pascal's theory is better than Descartes's and Lavoisier's better than Priestley's. By contrast with the beliefs of the centurion or of the Roman peasant, Pascal's and Lavoisier's beliefs have in that sense a universal value. Finally, I would like to stress by offering an example my strong agreement with another of Goldthorpe's main points: that QAD (Quantitative Analysis of large-scale Data-sets) and RAT should be coupled; in other words, that we would learn much more from the quantitative data produced by sociology, if we tried to conceive and analyse them with the help of RATs. I would add that preferably the version of the RAT limited to postulates Pl to P3 should be cho- sen. I will illustrate this point with an example borrowed from my own book on The Origin of Values (2001, London / New Brunswick (USA),Transaction). In their monumental survey on values, Inglehart and his co-workers (1998) introduced two questions dealing with unemployment: the respondents were asked whether (1) lowering the age of retirement, or (2) controlling more severely the number of immi? grants were adequate policies to achieve a reduction in the rate of unemployment. The data revealed that the percentages of yes answers varied greatly among Western countries. To the first question ('When jobs are scarce, people should be forced to retire early'), the percentages choosing 'agree' were respectively (retaining only six countries): Spain, 62 per cent; Germany (W), 50 per cent; France, 49 per cent; England, 43 per cent; USA, 16 per cent; Sweden, 9 per cent. To the second question ('When jobs are scarce, employers should give priority to their own nationality over immigrants'), the percentages choosing 'agree' were Spain: 75 per cent; Germany (W), 62 per cent; France, 63 per cent; England, 51 per cent; USA: 51 per cent; Sweden: 35 per cent. Within each country, gender, political and ideologi- cal preferences, or socio-economic status turn out to make little difference, according to the data made available by Inglehart et al. The only intermediary variable that has a definite influence on the answers to the two questions is the level of education: does this mean that, with more education, one becomes more sophisticated in economic analysis and more generally in causal diagnosis? This would explain a good part of the variation in the percentage of yes answers within countries. As to the variation between countries, I would introduce the Tocquevil- lian conjecture that it possibly reflects the fact that central decisions on macroeconomic questions are more easily considered by people as normal and effi- cient in more centralized countries and the additional conjecture that educational systems differ in the effectiveness with which they train people to produce valid causal diagnoses on various subjects. Another structural feature of the data is that the countries considered rank roughly in a similar way on the two questions, and that the percentages of yes answers are much higher in all countries to the second question than to the first. This plausibly</page><page sequence="7">REVIEWSYMPOSIUM 457 indicates an effect of 'axiological' reasons. It is easier to refuse to let immigrants into one's country than to change the age of retirement. Indeed, the latter case involves a breach of contract, entailing social, eco- nomic, and ethical costs, whereas the former simply implies a refusal to enter a contractual relationship in the first place. Now, axiologically speaking, the former situation, that ofa breach of contract, is less acceptable than the latter. On the whole, this tentative interpretation pro- poses to account for the statistical structure of the data with its interaction effects (in the statistical sense) at all levels by a theory which makes them the product of individual beliefs arising from the interplay of axiological and cognitive reasons in the various national contexts. Given the nature of the available data, I have no way of knowing whether this interpretation is actually valid. But it could inspire, and be checked by, adequate observational methods. One thing is sure at any rate: no statistical tool of analysis, however sophisticated, will ever be able, as such, to explain quantitative data. Statistical analysis is no substitute for a precise micro-theory working as a generating model whence the structure of the data can be derived. What I want to suggest by this example is that reading quantitative data with RAT in mind is likely, as John Goldthorpe contends, to fertilize the sociological imagination, in its empirical, meth- odological and theoretical dimensions. It also makes the data much more interesting. Provided the coupling of QAD and RAT is finely tuned, RAT can tell us why people think or behave the way they do, or why people think or behave differently here and there. Finally, the example illustrates my general conclusion that fine tuning between theory and data is more easily achieved in current research situations with MI (postulates Pl to P3) than RCT (postulates Pl to P6).
