<plain_text><page sequence="1">Michael Haneke's Funny Games and Schiller's Coercive Classicism Gail K. Hart University of California, Irvine This essay springs from my interest in the violence that underlies certain Schillerian ideals, such as freedom and aesthetic education, and also from an interest in following the transmission and mutation of those ideals in contemporary literature and film.1 The Anthony Burgess/Stanley Kubrick treatment of "An die Freude" and the coercive aspects of Schillerian freedom in A Clockwork Orange, for example, illustrate this continuing cultural dialogue with Schiller's aesthetics. "Violence" in this context refers to a number of things and includes the "ultra-violence" that Burgess paired with the experience of music and art, but the basic authorization of such violence (clearly exaggerated by Burgess) lies in the absence of a role for individual volition within these ideal projections ("Alle Menschen werden Brüder") and the fundamental assumption of mass control that powers them.2 From early notes on the level of Wirkung his dramas were to achieve with their audiences to later redefinitions of freedom as an externally prescribed course, Schiller's didactics and the ideals they promoted were regularly theorized as coercive interventions into wayward mentalities.3 Examples of this tendency abound in the early theoretical writings, where Schiller portrays the dramatist as a privileged individual who, by means of the images he creates and presents, gains access to the innermost chambers of the human mind, where he can repair moral deficits and induce the mind-set that leads to proper behavior: Es ist nicht Übertreibung, wenn man behauptet, dass diese auf der Schau bühne aufgestellten Gemälde mit der Moral des gemeinen Manns endlich in eins zusammenfliessen, und in einzelnen Fällen seine Empfindung be stimmen. ( 191 )4 The later theoretical and aesthetic essays have a similarly coercive bent ("seine Empfindung bestimmen"), and this reflects both Schiller's firm didactic ambitions, but also the absolutist character of his political environment, a rigidity that infected his discourse and his thinking. Michael Haneke, as I will argue in the later part of this Modern Austrian Literature, Vol. 39, No. 2, 2006 © 2006 by the Modem Austrian Literature and Culture Association</page><page sequence="2">64 GAIL K. HART essay, professes a similar didactic aesthetic (without the absolutist taint), but I will begin with a look at Schillerian influence or Schillerian figures within a particular Haneke film—and then move to statements of purpose. In pursuit of these goals, I will not be elucidating Haneke's position in the history of cinema or film studies or addressing the technical aspects of his films in any detail. Rather, I will focus on Funny Games as a text that issues from an author/auteur who proposes to effect some level of human improvement or repair with his text. Haneke's and Schiller's didactic intentions are a matter of record, and there are strong resemblances between the two that belie the centuries and the media. Schiller and his aesthetic ideals, especially as they are expressed in Über die ästhetische Erziehung des Menschen in einer Reihe von Briefen, still inform much of our thinking on art and its effects—even when these ideals are reduced to the notion that "art is good for you" or that "art should be good for you." Though others have extolled the benefits of contemplating Beauty, it is Schiller who has most effectively staked out the territory where aesthetic activity leads to higher humanity, such that Paul de Man could exclaim with some exasperation in Aesthetic Ideology, "Whatever writing we do, whatever way we have of talking about art, whatever way we have of teaching, whatever justification we give ourselves for teaching, whatever the standards and values by means of which we teach, they are more than ever and profoundly Schillerian" (142). Other references to the persistence of Schiller's thinking on art and the aesthetic in contemporary artistic endeavors tend to repeat de Man's call for resistance. Terry Eagleton sees a Schillerian doubleness in the aesthetics that "provides some of the vital constituents of a new theory of bourgeois hegemony; but [that] also protests with magnificent passion against the spiritual devastation which that emergent social order is wreaking" (Eagleton 118), while Adorno suspected a fascistic fascination with power: "Im innersten Gehäuse des Humanismus, als dessen eigene Seele, tobt gefangen der Wüterich, der als Faschist die Welt zum Gefängnis macht" (97). Though Adorno exaggerates, it is fair to say that Schiller's aesthetics rest on an assumption of control or coercion and that, as I have argued elsewhere, Schillerian freedom is an induced freedom, here induced by art and a carefully crafted education in the reception of art. Education, be it aesthetic, higher, or vocational, is actually never a function of freedom, but rather an operation performed on a subject who submits for a variety of reasons. Constantin Behler, who has written extensively on the coercive or hegemonic aspects of Schiller's aesthetic program sees it in Foucauldian terms of control: Schiller's aesthetic humanism or humanist aesthetics is not simply a dream, Utopia, or imaginative production, because his discourse did suc ceed in rendering its objects—aesthetic artifacts, human beings, society, history—as programmable, i.e. as accessible to a knowledge that could be strategically deployed to shape and transform them. (4)</page><page sequence="3">Michael Haneke's Funny Games and Schiller's Coercive Classicism 65 The programmability of the aesthetically educated subject who has been induced to be free may have been Schiller's way of processing the horrors of the French Revolution, but it also resonates in twentieth- and twenty-first-century discourses on art and its audience. The manner in which art, particularly film, addresses its audience shows the ways in which aesthetic education can be enforced. Haneke's 1997 film Funny Games offers an opportunity to elaborate the "dark side" of Schiller's views on art inasmuch as it presents a brand of ludic violence that might be seen as a re-rendering of Schiller's aesthetically educational "Spieltrieb." In his aesthetic letters (Uber die ästhetische Erziehung des Menschen in einer Reihe von Briefen) Schiller presents a higher humanity that realizes itself in aesthetic play, a free play that is dissociated from both purpose and material. This play represents the wholeness and harmony that liberate man from the unilateral dominance of an inclination toward formal regulation ("Formtrieb") or toward material satisfaction ("Stofftrieb"). These tendencies represent the dualism inherent in human nature, and this dualism is overcome through play, an enhanced term of unity and transcendence that Schiller distinguishes (most theatrically) from ordinary play or "bloßes Spiel": "Aber was heißt denn ein bloßes Spiel, nachdem wir wissen, dass unter allen Zuständen des Menschen gerade das Spiel und nur das Spiel es ist, was ihn vollständig macht und seine doppelte Natur auf einmal entfaltet? (612). Play, playing, or games do not appear in the letters as activity that confines the mind and spirit to a narrow and limited sphere of occupation, but rather as an expansion of the spirit and a realization of human potential. This is familiar territory (precisely because Schiller endures) and we all know the famous lines: "[D]er Mensch spielt nur, wo er in voller Bedeutung des Worts Mensch ist, und er ist nur da ganz Mensch, wo er spielt" (614; Schiller's emphasis). This fully human play occurs for its own sake. It is disinterested, and Schiller presents it as its own justification. Here the comparison of Schiller's ideal aesthetic man to Haneke's pair of murderers suggests itself. Peter and Paul, who corner, torment, and ultimately execute vacationing families, seem to perform these atrocities for their own sake, without reference to material gain, sensual satisfaction ("Stofftrieb") or any sense of justice or retribution ("Formtrieb").5 And their deeply visceral interventions into Sein, or Being, are conducted under the Schein of a good game that they compel their victims to participate in. The young men operate within the realm of Schein, and their insistence on manners and the regulatory mechanisms of politeness, while ignoring the deep and awful suffering they cause, anchors them in a play of appearances, one that they control as they revise and shift the rules. In the absence of any other explanation (and this absence of explanation is central to Haneke's purpose), Peter and Paul appear to be motivated by the "Spieltrieb" that Schiller theorized.6 Games, rarely funny in Schiller's tortuous play of concepts and categories, are played for their own sake in the film, and it is this "aesthetic" dimension that so effectively foregrounds the violence, or our sense of it. Furthermore, aesthetic education in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries is truly aufgehoben (Hegel,</page><page sequence="4">66 GAIL K. HART Marx), both negated and preserved in contemporary pieces that engage classicist ideals and transform them. Haneke's exploration of his protagonists' "Spieltrieb" is a stark and illuminating commentary on these ideals. Funny Games may extend this statement to the perpetrators of violence, though its major thrust is a critique of the presentation of violence to mass audiences—which needs to be addressed here. Haneke has repeatedly indicted Hollywood for its tendency to make violence both entertaining and comprehensible, justifying or neutralizing it with a happy ending and the triumph of the Good. He seems most concerned with the idea that Hollywood or mainstream film makes violence intelligible: Im Actionfilm [wird] Gewalt meistens durch die Vorgeschichte legitimiert, die dem Täter das Recht gibt, Gewalt auszuüben. Hinzu kommt die Verharmlosung durch Ästhetisierung. Auf diese Weise wird Gewalt mit einem angenehmen Grusel- oder Unterhaltungseffekt vermittelt. Dagegen polemisiere ich, indem ich die Gewalt nicht legitimiere, sondern aus der Perspektive der Opfer zeige, nicht die Tat an sich, sondern das Resultat. (Köhler) The absence of the exculpatory, humanizing explanation foregrounds the violence itself as the victims receive it, but Haneke's reference to aestheticizing as making harmless runs counter to his aestheticizing of motivation in Funny Games, a move that invokes Schiller's coercive classicism. As the film opens, the doomed family, driving to their vacation home, is involved in what might be called a skewed or degraded Schillerian ritual of playing with beauty ( "Der Mensch soll mit der Schönheit nur spielen und er soll nur mit der Schönheit spielen [614; Schiller's emphasis]). The parents, Anna and Georg, identify bits of opera and score points by trying to choose pieces of music that their opponent will not recognize. Once the first piece of music has been identified, Anna abruptly ejects the disc in mid-aria and inserts another, ending the lovely vocal segment and subordinating the music itself to the purpose of outdoing the other player (her next selection will be similarly terminated as the sound track shifts to the extra-diegetic, punk-ish music of John Zorn). There is much concern that Georg may have peeked at the titles, indicating a competitive urge or a will to win. The opera game models what Schiller in his fifteenth letter disqualifies as non ideal games, namely those "die im wirklichen Leben im Gange sind und die sich gewöhnlich auf sehr materielle Gegenstände richten" (614). He notes, "Die wirklich vorhandene Schönheit ist des wirklich vorhandenen Spieltriebes wert; aber durch das Ideal der Schönheit, welches die Vernunft aufstellt, ist auch ein Ideal des Spieltriebes aufgegeben, das der Mensch in allen seinen Spielen vor Augen haben soll." The opera game "plays with beauty," but it does so literally and crassly, reducing the contemplation of this beauty to a motivated competition and the accumulation of points. The Peter/Paul (Beavis/Butthead, Dick/Doof) pair are very different players.</page><page sequence="5">Michael Haneke's Funny Games and Schiller's Coercive Classicism 67 Their object is not clearly discernable and "materielle Gegenstände" do not seem to interest them, and this missing or unidentified motivation is at the root of the film's impact. The recurring question "Warum tun Sie das?" is first posed early in the family's ordeal, and it is this question and their overresponsive/unresponsive reactions to it that tilt the film toward the question-and-answer of aesthetic contemplation. "Warum nicht?" is one of the first reactions to the question that continues to hover over the proceedings as the family and the audience ask themselves why two such well-groomed young men who profess an interest in politeness and cleanliness (the two dominant discourses in the banter of the games) would torment and ultimately kill a series of vacationing families. The humane discourse of politeness, a formal practice that springs from rules based on empathy, can of course transcend this guiding empathy and function according to abstract rules. The courtesy that drives Peter and Paul's dialogue is an anti-empathy, a system that repels human feeling inasmuch as it is used to situate the perpetrators as the victims of discourtesy and stands in for explanation. One frequently cited ancestor to Funny Games is Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers (Clockwork Orange, whose protagonist enjoys ultra-violence, is another). Natural Born Killers follows the killing spree of another alliterative pair of violent murderers, Mickey and Mallory, but with the significant difference that their actions are firmly mired in the muck of explanation. Two major explanatory frameworks emerge in the Stone film: first, that both perpetrators are processing abusive childhoods, attested to by frequent flashbacks which include the rendering of Mallory's family life in the form of a sitcom with a laugh track accompanying garish and gruesome abuse (the kind of meta-media moment that Haneke also favors); second, involving an appeal to Nature supported by shots of wolves and snakes and Mickey's emphatic answer to the "Warum tun Sie das?" question: "I guess I'm just a natural born killer." Additionally, there are regular flashes of a demon's face, which Stone considers to be subliminal and uses as a signal that violent urges are peaking. But this apparent attribution of agency, which seems to contradict the "natural" explanation, is most likely an evocation of the "demon within" which takes us back to the abusive childhoods and the nature of the killers. In the end we have two explanatory havens for inquiring minds: Nature and nurture. Thus fortified, one can choose to enjoy the violence with the further bonus that the film, with its rousing music and lewd exaggerations of grim brutality, claims to be ironic and thus, presumably, is not merely indulging an urge for entertainment. Stone may have created the ultimate enticement to the enjoyment of violence as he allows his viewers to disdain the usual Hollywood presentation of violence even as it occurs, with guns discharging and blood flowing. More may indeed be less, as the intelligibility of motive is further enhanced by the love story and the unappealing character of most of the victims. Haneke describes Funny Games in interviews as something of an (aesthetic) educational project, mentioning repeatedly his efforts to counter the Hollywood</page><page sequence="6">68 GAIL K. HART style of violence that emphasizes the deed and the (often exculpatory) intentions behind it—something Stone is attempting to do but with less success. As Haneke told Margret Köhler, he wanted to induce the spectators to reflect on the role of violence in film by showing the victim's perspective, the result of the violence. He furthermore took care to repel explanatory or exculpatory inquiries, attributing the whole sequence of events to "funny games." The well-groomed, well-spoken, pleasantly polite perpetrators, "zwei duschgelsaubere, hell gekleidete, so zuvorkommende wie kalt-brutale junge Männer" (Heinzelmann), run through the whole catalogue of explanations for violence that respond to the question of what makes humans capable of the apparently inhuman. In one scene they mock the psycho-babble that seeks to domesticate violent social aberrations by locating the source in the home and early childhood, as Stone does. Paul relates a series of stock explanations for his partner's delinquency. Peter/Dickie was a child of divorce ("Scheidung als er klein war"); father left mother to marry another woman; mother left father to over-mother her son, leaving him "schwul und kriminell." Peter came from a poor family, "aus dreckigen kleinen Verhältnissen"; he had five brothers and sisters, all drug addicts; his father was an alcoholic. He was not poor but prosperous, and became bored and oppressed by the meaninglessness of life, and so on. On another explanatory goose chase earlier in the film, we see the murderers raise the question of male rivalry and aggression in the egg farce. After Peter has repeatedly broken the eggs he initially proposed to borrow, Paul suddenly breaks or changes character and growls to Georg that they will break his eggs, crudely threatening his testicles. But he does this so theatrically and parodically that the exchange functions as a dismissal of yet another possible motivation. This moment of feigned masculine competition elicits a feminine slap from gentle Georg, but that theme (relative levels of masculinity) is not pursued, even though the slap is repeatedly cited as provocation. Finally, Paul asks which answer they would like— "Welche würde Sie befriedigen?"—offering the family a choice of motivations for their demise while mocking their misplaced curiosity. This over-explanation differs from the motivational exposition of Natural Born Killers, because Haneke points in diverse and contradictory directions, whereas Stone accumulates motivation and piles it up. In Funny Games childhood abuse, deprivation, oedipal complications, and masculine competition are rejected even as they are mimicked, leaving the vile deeds detached from conventional motivation. This "Zwecklosigkeit," verging on an "interesseloses Wohlgefallen" (Kant), evokes the genuine purposelessness of aesthetic contemplation, an activity that, though it reflects and enhances humanity, is performed for its own sake as the free play of imagination confronted with or imagining beauty—though the games that occupy Peter and Paul concern what we would commonly associate with Beauty's opposite. In the twenty-fifth aesthetic letter Schiller seems to plug into Haneke's conception of mainstream violent film: "Jedem Schrecknis der Natur ist der Mensch überlegen,</page><page sequence="7">Michael Haneke's Funny Games and Schiller's Coercive Classicism 69 sobald er ihm Form zu geben und in sein Objekt zu wandeln weiss" (656). A kind of Schillerian sublimity also conveys the comfort and control achieved through making motivation intelligible. This corresponds to Haneke's description of the violence portrayed in Hollywood films, violence made comprehensible and thus reconcilable with a kitsch notion of higher humanity. Haneke strives to deny his viewers this comfort, and his Peter/Paul, Dick/Doof are constantly shifting shapes, changing names and biographies, defying any attempt spectators may make "[ihnen] Form zu geben." They dodge the explanations that would make them "heimlich" or transform them into our (coherent) object. The only "form" they take is that of players of the funny games, authors of the ordeals that the family must play along with. This is essential horror, namely the withholding of (ideal) anthropomorphic reason or motivation. Schiller's high humanity is dealt a low blow even as its practices are affirmed (or at least allowed to continue) in the concluding repetition of the act. In Haneke's taxonomy of cinematic violence, staged as gruesome playing, the "funny games" are coercive pageants that appear as free play on one discursive level and expose themselves as control by force on another. If this is so, then we are well within the realm of Schiller's classicism, an aesthetic construct that celebrates play, freedom, and free play but that cannot do so without imposing its form on the hypothetical subject. Funny Games is thus in many ways a dark echo of the aesthetic education that sought to "raise" humanity to aesthetic contemplation and suspend its fragmented preoccupation with form and regulation on the one hand and material satisfaction on the other. The slippery organization of the games, with shifting rules and easy transgression of these rules, and the fact that no material or sensual reward or gain is realized, move Schiller's luminous and flawed theoretical apparatus toward its (violent) logical conclusion. Here aesthetic man plays not with Beauty, but with humanity, and the games are often characterized as being played against this segment of humanity. Individual volition, which is so problematic in Schiller's aesthetics of mass theatrical efficacy, is also dismissed in Peter and Paul's games, rituals that are made compulsory, but not at all compelling for the victims. The affinities between Haneke's and Schiller's didactic aesthetics are not confined to Funny Games, and I would like to take a closer look at Haneke's stated program of Wirkung and the character of the efficacy he seeks as a filmmaker. Haneke is on record, in numerous interviews and in his own writings as an artist with a purpose, someone whom Joachim Kürten describes as "Ästhet und rigoroser Moralist." As such he is also the declared enemy of mainstream violent film, which he believes does violence to the spectator who sees and hears lies about the world and then is deprived of the right to question or criticize. As he explains to Köhler, for example: Wenn ein Thriller dem Zuschauer verspricht, dass am Ende das Gute siegt, halte ich das für wirklichkeitsfremd. Wenn zwei Menschen in mein Haus kommen und mich umbringen wollen, tun sie das. Alles andere</page><page sequence="8">70 GAIL K. HART ist Lüge. Es geht darum, diese Lüge des Genre-Kinos zu entlarven oder zumindest zur Diskussion zu stellen. Die Welt ist nicht in Ordnung, auch wenn wir das möchten. Haneke believes that mainstream film perpetrates a large and generally effective deception, namely that the world can be adequately and wholly represented by such films and that all of this world's problems can be solved within the space of such films. He writes in the program notes to 71 Fragmente einer Chronologie des Zufalls that, though narrative literature has transcended nineteenth-century bourgeois realism, film has not abandoned this kind of narrative: Only in film, the most recent and potentially most modern form of art, the manner of thinking continues on the level prevalent in the nineteenth century. Whether naively or cynically, but in any case with financial success, the comforting illusion prevails that the world can be completely described and thus explained, (transi, by and quoted in Riemer, "Michael Haneke" 171) He adds: Spectators are used to the programming of television and the entertainment cinema, which present a world that is explainable and whose contradictions can be resolved. To have their craving for pacification gratified, they are willing to pay a great deal of money to the imperialism of illusion. (172) This is a familiar—and markedly conservative—intellectual assessment of the experience of mainstream cinema.7 Old European high culture has long disdained the mechanical reproduction of Hollywood happy endings, and Marxist thinkers such as Brecht (himself rather unhappy in Hollywood) have deplored the lack of intellectual content or thought provocation in mainstream movies. Schiller also lamented that theater audiences see poorly organized or poorly acted spectacles that fail to reveal their faults to them or that fail to provoke them to contemplate these faults (see esp. "Über das gegenwärtige teutsche Theater"). He lashed out at the contemporary theater for its failure to educate its audience: So lang das Schauspiel weniger Schule als Zeitvertreib ist—mehr dazu gebraucht, die eingähnende Langeweile zu beleben, unfreundliche Winter nächte zu betrügen, und das große Heer unserer süßen Müßiggänger mit dem Schaume der Weisheit, dem Papiergeld der Empfindung, und galanten Zoten zu bereichern, so lang es mehr für die Toilette und Schenke arbeitet: so lange mögen immer unsere Theaterschriftsteller der patriotischen Eitelkeit entsagen, Lehrer des Volkes zu sein. Bevor das Publikum für seine Bühne gebildet ist, dörfte wohl schwerlich die Bühne ihr Publikum bilden. (170) I quote Schiller at length because Haneke's remarks on educating the public, though</page><page sequence="9">Michael Haneke's Funny Games and Schiller's Coercive Classicism 77 more restrained, do not differ significantly from those of his classicist theatrical predecessor. Schiller—whose opinions reflect his engagement with Lessing, Mendelssohn, and Leibniz, among others—endures. Haneke sees a crisis similar to that described by Schiller in contemporary movie theaters and addresses it in films that seek to destabilize the totalizing vision of the world that he believes persists in contemporary popular film, a presentation that does not invite critical dialogue: "Das Mainstream-Kino nimmt den Zuschauer nicht nur die Bilder und Töne, sondern auch die Gedanken weg, es vergewaltigt seine Zuschauer" (Köhler). Like Schiller—"Werden darum weniger Mädchen verführt, weil Sara Sampson ihren Fehltritt mit Gifte büßet? Eifert ein einziger Ehemann weniger, weil der Mohr von Venedig sich so tragisch übereilte?" ("Über das gegenwärtige teutsche Theater" 168)—he denies the direct influence of art to replicate the stage/ screen action in spectators' lives: "Ich glaube nicht, dass ein Buch oder ein Film Bewusstsein oder Verhalten verändern kann." Yet both strive for a second-degree approximation of this extreme artistic influence: Schiller hopes to determine the (moral) sensations of his audience ("seine Empfindung bestimmen"), and Haneke hopes to induce critical thought: "Wenn Funny Games es schafft, einige Zuschauer dazu zu bringen, die Rolle der Gewalt in den Medien und ihre eigene Position zu reflektieren, dann habe ich schon viel erreicht" (Köhler). Though this remark comes from the more casual format of an interview, it is nonetheless a clear and forceful statement of intent to reverse the effects of the demonized mainstream cinema and establish a productive and beneficial art form in the place of current popular violent films. The difference between crass dictation with expectations of obedience and the sincere attempt to inspire cerebration and reinforce critical attitudes may ultimately be one of degree and not of kind, inasmuch as direction is prescribed for critical attitudes to be generated. One can read Haneke's program notes in Riemer's collection, as well as countless remarks from interviews and presentations, as a blueprint for his project of aesthetic education, namely the Schillerian—some would say Brechtian—promotion of (intellectual) freedom as he conceives it. Inducing an audience via cinematic spectacle to ask questions or to question the spectacle (in very specific ways that resemble Haneke's views) is perhaps as much of an imposition as mindless entertainment. Both forms manipulate, one for profit and the other for influence. Brecht sought to induce thinking in his theater largely because he thought that if his spectators were to think responsibly, they would come to think as he thought. Schiller, in his essay on Matthison's poetry, wrote that in transmitting freedom the poet must prescribe the path that the reader would have taken on his own and that the greatest level of freedom derives from the greatest level of determination: "die höchste Freiheit [ist] gerade nur durch die höchste Bestimmtheit möglich" (1019). And Schiller has a point. There is perhaps some freedom in being pointed in a particular direction and being encouraged to proceed in precisely that direction, especially when compared to being "glued to one's seat" in Hollywood fashion (though I am merging commentary</page><page sequence="10">72 GAIL K. HART on poetry with commentary on film here). But in both cases, an educator seeks to leave his stamp on the to-be-educated. Furthermore, whatever the benefits involved for the spectators, Haneke's aesthetic education (which has yielded a series of extraordinary and compelling films) misses the point of the genre it attacks and reacts to. Mainstream violent film does not rape us or render us its programmable objects, nor does it deny human suffering or inhibit our ability to think. Scholars and scientists have discussed and studied the attractions of artistically depicted violence and calamity almost since Schiller's "Über den Grund des Vergnügens am tragischen Gegenstand," and no clear answer to the question of effects has emerged, nor has it been proven that the simulated violence of films begets the actual violence that does harm to humans. Sam Peckinpah, whose descriptions of the ultra-violent The Wild Bunch sound something like Haneke's aspirations for Funny Games, believes that violence appeals to violent urges in the audience: The point of [The Wild Bunch ] is to take this façade of movie violence and open it up, get people involved in it so that they are starting to go in the Hollywood television predictable reaction syndrome, and then twist it so that it's not fun anymore, just a wave of sickness in the gut. [...] It's a terrible, ugly thing. And yet there's a certain response that you get from it, an excitement because we're all violent people, (quoted in Hoberman 139)8 The Wild Bunch was certainly not received as a critique of violence or an attempt to promote a critical attitude toward cinematic manipulation. It did, however, elicit the excitement that Peckinpah ascribes to recognition or identification. Other commentators see an Aristotelian purging of the emotions in the experience of violent film, and this is consistent with the exculpatory structures Haneke perceives. A few studies have shown that violent films increase viewer aggression, but as Clark McCauley and others have pointed out, these studies work with lone viewers or fail in other ways to replicate the social setting of the cinema (McCauley 157). Other studies have shown no appreciable effects. Yet it is not so much a potential heightening of viewer aggression that troubles Haneke, but rather what he perceives as submission to a narrative structure that explains and accommodates violence and the subordination, for profit, of art to pacification. Spectators do flock to violent cinema "to experience in safety emotions that are usually associated with danger" (Goldstein 219), but whether this is ultimately damaging or simply unworthy is far from established. Mainstream violent cinema is most likely not the sinister plutocratic plot that Haneke suggests, but rather a form of enjoyment that has few negative social consequences beyond the loss of a few hours. Schiller insisted that enlightened aesthetic man play only with Beauty, and Haneke seeks to prescribe a higher form of play for his spectators by exposing them to Peter and Paul's "funny games." But if Hollywood is playing games with our minds, they</page><page sequence="11">Michael Haneke's Funny Games and Schiller's Coercive Classicism 73 are probably not the dangerous games Haneke supposes. Perhaps they are really and merely funny—that is, if the "mere-ness" of funny is still tenable. NOTES 1. See Hart 24-53, 135-64. I am grateful to Doris Bachmann-Medick for productive discussions of violent film, specifically Funny Games. 2. Wilkinson and Willoughby have also commented on the violence inherent in Schiller's aesthetic education, noting that it creates a paradox in connection with the notion of an education to freedom that is intensified by the "habitual aggressiveness" of Schiller's language (xxx-xxxi). 3. See, for example, Schiller's essays "Was kann eine gute stehende Schaubühne eigentlich wirken?" and "Über Matthisons Gedichte." In the latter he seeks to rescue the freedom of those subjected to the poet's prescriptions by merging the prescriptions and the freedom. The poet accomplishes this "[djadurch, dass er unserer Einbildungskraft keinen anderen Gang vorschreibt, als den sie in ihrer vollen Freiheit und nach ihren eigenen Gesetzen nehmen müsste. [...] Es findet sich alsdann, dass die höchste Freiheit gerade nur durch die höchste Bestimmtheit möglich ist" (1018-19). See also Behler. 4. Similarly strong statements of didactic will to determine recipients' behavior occur elsewhere in "Schaubühne," in the Räuber apparatus, and in the introduction to Fiesko. 5. One might even regard Peter and Paul as representatives of a Schillerian dualism: Paul is the form-giver who explains all games and rules, and Peter gives voice to material needs (borrows eggs, gets hungry); Paul is lean and calculating, and Peter is corpulent and less involved in planning. Together—that is, in combination or Auftiebung—they achieve a twisted form of aesthetic play. Haneke's description of the distinction in an interview with Christopher Sharrett also tends in this direction: "The tall one, who is the 'main plotter,' so to speak, might be seen as an intellectual with a deviousness that could be associated with this type of destructive fascist intellect.... The fat one is the opposite; there is nothing there on the order of intellect" (Sharrett 4; this is an expanded version of an interview that first appeared in Cinéaste 28.3 [2003]). 6. As Willy Riemer puts it in his excellent analysis of Funny Games: "For Haneke, explanations won't do—they are the first step to acceptance" (Riemer, "Michael Haneke" 96). 7. Haneke has been labeled conservative by a number of commentators. Maximilian LeCain finds that Funny Games is "among the most conservative films of the 90's" because he perceives the portrayal of the family as "victimized" and "beleaguered" in the manner of "Griffithian melodrama" (8). In an essay on</page><page sequence="12">74 GAIL K. HART Haneke's "family trilogy" (Der siebente Kontinent, Bennys Video, 71 Fragmente einer Chronologie des Zufalls), Brigitte Peucker sees "latent conservatism" in Bennys Video, where she perceives the strong suggestion that mothers belong at home with their children. She concludes "that Haneke's films are multiply anchored in notions of organicism after all" (187). 8. Le Cain reads Funny Games as a Tarantino-style attempt to shock the audience with "the spectacle of sadistic violence." He adds: "While his intentions were doubtless honourably moralistic [...] Haneke's schematically protracted tortures are unpleasantly laboured and suffer from overconfidence in their own visceral power" (8).
