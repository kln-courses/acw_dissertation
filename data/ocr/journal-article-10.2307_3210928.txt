Domesticating Humans Peter Wilson notes that settling down in houses must have involved sweeping changes in the way people viewed each other and their world. He refers to "domesticated people," "who live (and mostly work) in houses grouped together in hamlets, villages and small towns as distinct from people of the past and present who use only temporary dwellings or no dwellings at all" (Wilson 1988: 4). The domestication of people in this way, he says, fundamentally changed their social organizations and probably their psychological paradigms. Living in clusters of houses, rather than camping in bands, created opportunities for new social relationships. House residents now had neighbors, a relationship based on propinquity rather than on kinship or food sharing. Because houses are more permanent than campsites, this relationship was also less fluid than in bands, where people can move in or out or shift their positions in response to shifting interpersonal attitudes (Woodbum 1972; Rodman 1985). The enclosing walls of houses provided new opportunities for the accumulation, concealment and display of food, wealth and status (Blanton 1994), quite unlike the openness and sharing of hunter- gatherer bands. Yet these opportunities also led to new or enhanced concepts of privacy, secrecy, envy and suspicion, ultimately allowing the replacement of egalitarian ethic by competition between neighbors for wealth and status. Envy and suspicion led to accusations of witchcraft, while competition led to the rise of "Big Men," leaders whose status depended on their persuasiveness, charisma, and generosity, an early step toward economic and political inequality. Thus, the origins of houses could actually have kicked off processes that ultimately led to the rise of chiefs, kings, and Bronze Age empires. Much like Wilson, Trevor Watkins sees the Neolithic as a time when living in houses made important changes in the way people perceived their world, and houses became not merely shelters, but homes, "the center of the family and the focus for the representation of appropriate values" (Watkins 1990: 337). Ian Hodder, furthermore, associates these changes with a new ideology that contrasted domestic with wild, inside with outside, culture with nature, domus with agrios. He observes that the relatively permanent house provides a "locus for the reproduction of the individual" as the roles of household members continue even when individual members die (Hodder 1990: 40). The process of settling into houses appears to have begun during the Epipalaeolithic, when hunter-gatherers, by the Natufian (ca. 12,500-10,000 cal BCE)2 if not earlier, lived at least part of the year in clusters of elliptical or subrectangular buildings. Already some 20,000 years ago, there were small huts at Ohalo II on the shores of Lake Kinneret. By the early NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY 66:1-2 (2003) 5 8000 9000 d- . -- _ 11: -. -.

The simple mudbrick buildings seemed to fit early archaeologists' expectations of a primitive Neolithic hamlet. The hatched walls are reconstructions. After Lloyd and Safar (1945: fig. 28). Neolithic, however, clear villages with substantial housing were widespread, even though agriculture and stock- breeding were still not. By the Middle Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB), around 7500 cal BCE, villages in the southern Levant had dozens, or even hundreds, of well-constructed houses arranged on terraces and streets, while those in the northern Levant had begun to show large, complex houses and public buildings. History of Research Neolithic houses have fascinated archaeologists ever since fieldworkers of the mid-twentieth century discovered that they were not always the simple huts and pit-houses that their simplistic evolutionary models led them to expect. Certainly some sites had crudely constructed shelters, but others had large, even monumental buildings. And even though few Neolithic sites had been investigated, these sites differed substantially in the form and organization of their houses. Tell Hassuna provided evidence for the development of a Pottery Neolithic campsite into a small settlement with rectangular, multi-room houses. It appeared to fit quite well archaeologists' expectations of a primitive Neolithic hamlet: simple mudbrick buildings with small storage rooms, storage bins, hearths and ovens (Lloyd and Safar 1945). So too Jarmo's houses were small, multi-roomed structures that already had many of the features that we associate with Near Eastern village life, such as bread ovens and storage facilities (Braidwood and Howe 1960). A "representative" house there was about thirty square meters in area and had four or five rectangular rooms plus a small, walled courtyard. Jericho, however, had surprises, with quite different architecture in its two major Pre-Pottery Neolithic strata (PPNA and PPNB) and Pottery Neolithic stratum. The PPNA houses were fairly simple and curvilinear, mudbrick huts, but this belies considerable architectural ability, as evidenced in a huge stone tower and substantial peripheral walls that excavator Kathleen Kenyon considered fortifications. The later PPNB houses were rectangular, with a standardized "megaron" plan: a porch or small entrance chamber controlled access to a square living room with a central hearth. Houses were crowded, but usually had at least narrow alleys between them (Kenyon 1957). (atal Hiiyik on the Konya Plain of central Anatolia had quite different Neolithic buildings. Houses were mainly fairly square, tightly agglomerated, and had roof access rather than ground-level doorways, making the village appear much like a pueblo in the American Southwest. Inside were raised platforms, rather than partition walls. The most spectacular aspect of these houses was the common practice of decorating walls with paintings and skulls. This led James Mellaart to interpret many of these buildings as shrines, rather than ordinary houses. Diana Kirkbride's excavations at Beidha in southern Jordan revealed dozens of small, PPNB "corridor houses," 6 NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY 66:1-2 (2003) l "I I )</page><page sequence="4">C f h 0 10m A Semi-subterranean, PPNB "pit-house" at Beidha, showing the slots where wooden posts formerly supported the superstructure.

Below these were clusters of semi-subterranean, circular houses, also PPNB in date, at the time providing the clearest example of the shift from curvilinear to rectangular architecture in the early Neolithic. Although Neolithic houses were known from several other sites, it was in the 1980s and 1990s that our knowledge of Neolithic domestic architecture really exploded. Excavations in Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Syria and Turkey uncovered hundreds of houses of both the Pre-Pottery and Pottery Neolithic periods. Some of these also boast spectacular preservation. Neolithic House Types Although archaeologists as early as the 1950s noticed that Neolithic houses had standardized plans, the first systematic and comprehensive classification of Neolithic house forms was by Olivier Aurenche (1981). He depended heavily on attributes of plan shape and room number for this typology. Major classes included unicellular round buildings, round buildings with internal partitions, unicellular rectangular and multicellular rectangular structures. Within these major classes, we can detect many subtypes that reflect local construction traditions, building materials, roofing arrangements, functional differentiation of space or social arrangements, climatic conditions and ideologies (Rapoport 1968). One house type that was common in the PPNB was the "megaron" or "pier house," after the masonry "piers" that project from interior walls. In northern Mesopotamia and southern Turkey, meanwhile, we find "grill plan" and "cell plan" buildings at sites Plans of megaron houses or "pier houses" from several PPNB sites in the southern Levant: Beidha Level II (a-b), Beisamoun (c), CAin Ghazal (d-e), Jericho (f-h), and Yiftahel (i).

Mabry. building design and construction (Rapoport 1969: 4-5). Much as with North American barn-raisings in the nineteenth century, cultural agreement about what a building was supposed to be like made it easier for neighbors to help each other with the construction tasks, and each house exhibited only small variations on a basic local design. A thing to keep in mind about house typologies is that they impose a kind of static order on what must have been a dynamic process of house construction, addition, renovation, and demolition. In some cases, we have good evidence for these changes and can see that different house "types" are sometimes different stages in the life cycle of the same house type. Building a Neolithic House Although house construction varied, and the sequence of construction is not always easy to determine, house construction involved digging out or leveling a house floor, felling and trimming trees, collecting stone or making bricks, constructing a frame, filling in the walls and laying a roof. There was some variation over time due to the availability of raw materials. The earliest Neolithic houses, like those of the Epipalaeolithic, were typically oval huts or pit-houses (huts with their floors dug into the ground). Their construction involved digging a pit, sometimes inserting narrow posts at small intervals against the sides of the pit and then infilling the spaces between them with stones and mud. In other cases, mud brick, rather than stone, was used to build walls. At Qermez Dere, builders covered the pit sides with clay and plaster, and it is not obvious how walls were constructed, or if the houses were fully subterranean (Watkins 1990: 339). Roof arrangements are uncertain, but most early huts and pit-houses probably employed post-and-beam construction. Vertical posts, not the walls, supported horizontal roof beams, creating essentially a skeleton for the house. These in turn probably supported a flat roof of sticks and closely spaced reeds, covered with earth and mud, although some sites may have had roofs of thatch or other material.

At CAin Ghazal, for example, house construction began by leveling the ground, although not always very much, sometimes with terraces. Delineating the outline of the house may have involved rituals. Once the site was ready, the builders dug post- holes and placed posts to support the roof, another example of post-and-beam construction. They laid double-leaf 10 NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY 66:1-2 (2003)</page><page sequence="8">Overview of a multi-cellular building with a small, central courtyard at LPPNB Basta.

Rollefson. stone walls (with two rows of stones in each course) to enclose the rectangular house area, leaving an opening on one of the short ends, or even omitting that wall entirely, to provide an entrance or porch. Typically "piers" extending from these walls separated the front porch area from the main room and provided additional support for roof beams. The roof consisted of poles laid across the beams, reeds or mats laid across the poles, and earth and mud packed onto the reeds to make a weatherproof cover. Where building stone and timber were scarce, both walls and roof supports were of mudbrick, but other aspects of construction were similar. In some sites, multicellular plans with many small rooms made it possible to span them with short roof beams, and without need for posts. Probably these grid-like plans also provided a strong, honeycomb-like basis for an upper story, as we have good evidence, in southern Jordan at least, that such buildings were two-storied. One of the final construction processes was often plastering. Lime plaster required burning limestone at 750 to 850?C, mixing the resulting lime with water, slaking it, and tempering it with sand or small stones. Neolithic people used it to create hard, easily cleaned floors. In some regions, they used gypsum plaster on walls or features. Coping the floors up the walls facilitated sweeping or mopping. Plaster was also used to mold a hearth in the house's main room. Finishing the floors involved burnishing them with small, hard pebbles, and often painting them a deep red, either completely, along the borders of rooms, or in designs. Plaster also sometimes surfaced walls and served at sites like Qatal Hiiyiik to decorate them. Construction of Later Neolithic houses involved tasks and techniques that differed little from those of the early Neolithic, except that the use of plaster declined, and cobblestone and dirt floors became more common. ,^. 1Families, Households and Neighbors Realizing that the form of and arrangement of rooms in houses was, at least in part, related to the social arrangements of the people who used them, some archaeologists have attempted to infer what social units inhabited the houses, controlled domestic production, and redistributed economic goods in the Neolithic. Flannery, for example, suggests that nuclear-family households became, for the first time, the elementary economic units of communities during the early Neolithic (1972; 2002). Archaeologists face real difficulties in trying to recognize social units in archaeological traces, including architectural ones. Families are units based on ties of kinship, and are thus difficult to identify except where we are lucky enough to find genetic anomalies or well- preserved DNA from skeletons that help us, even if only tentatively, to identify NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY 66:1-2 (2003) 11 -- . --j -- .-</page><page sequence="9">Well-preserved walls of a highly compart- mentalized LPPNB structure at Wadi Shu'eib, Jordan.

The " latter are groups of people who live under the same roof but, even in studies of modern people, they are not always easy -. ? . to define. For example, people may live _ together much of the year, but separately for significant periods, as when a " household member travels to engage in trade or to pasture herds. Households are groups of people, often, but not always, co-residents, who share (not necessarily equally) in economic production, distribution and the consumption of food, who reproduce themselves, and who i, transmit property from one generation to the next (Wilk XJL and Rathje 1982). Classic examples of households whose members are not always kin or co-residents are the medieval mercantile household and the Roman slave-holding . household. By "extended-family household," archaeologists ;= usually mean one in which married off-spring and their children continue to live with either the wives' or the husbands' parents or uncle. A problem in these studies is the need to estimate the size of co-resident groups. For example, is Flannery right that either a man or a woman and her children normally occupied Natufian and PPNA huts, and it was only later that nuclear families lived in the same building (1972; 32-39)? Much of the confusion over this question is due to the way people have estimated the number of people who occupied prehistoric- - _ structures, and to their choice of boundary for the co-resident group.

To use the formula on individual rooms or structures or on only the rooms used for living and sleeping was not at all what Narroll intended, and probably underestimates their number of occupants. Furthermore, even if some rooms, buildings, or huts were only large enough to house an individual, we are usually uncertain whether the household or co-resident group occupied one building, groups of buildings arranged around a courtyard, or buildings scattered in different places. Small buildings do not neatly correspond with small households any more than they automatically belong to large compounds. We need to be cautious about how we interpret "house" size by making careful attempts to figure out which rooms or huts appear spatially well connected and by checking for functional redundancy between rooms. Even then, we cannot be absolutely certain that we have correctly delineated co-resident groups. PPNA settlements from the southern Levant to northern Mesopotamia appear similar in many ways to Late Natufian ones. The huts were small or medium- sized and arranged linearly, in small clusters, or in larger scatters. Apart from the smallest structures of only about three square meters, probably for storage, huts ranged from nine to twenty-five square meters in area, large enough to shelter nuclear families. Although Flannery contended that these were elements in compounds occupied by large, polygamous social groups (1972: 32-33), the spatial arrangement of huts in our excavated sample do not especially support this. There is no strong evidence for grouping of huts around courtyards- the pattern found in recent polygamous compounds-nor for each adult having his or her own hut. Even where there was an open area, as at Hallan Qemi, the hut doors face outward, rather than inward (Rosenberg and Redding 2000: 48). The largest huts are no smaller than many of the later rectangular houses, while the smallest huts may be no different than small rooms in the later rectangular habitations. Although these huts would seem to us to be rather cramped, most household activities probably took place outside houses, in full sight of all the neighbors. Middle PPNB settlements sometimes continued the tradition of circular huts but the typical MPPNB settlement in the southern Levant was a large agglomeration of rectangular structures, each typically with sixteen to thirty square meters of roofed area and probably housing nuclear families. Some houses had interior bins that were probably capable of storing up to two cubic meters of grain. At Jericho, some very small structures between the houses are too small to have been habitations and, like the smallest huts in PPNA sites, are probably storage rooms. If so, that they are outside houses suggests that there was little worry over security. As View of the Yarmoukian house compound at Sha'ar Hagolan, Israel. Courtesy of Y. Garfinkel.

There was some differentiation of space, but many domestic activities appear to have taken place outdoors or on the roof.

Reconstructed walls are hatched. By Late PPNB, and even earlier at some sites, the southern Levant shows a trend toward extreme subdivision of houses, with stone piers increasingly replacing posts and the spaces between them evolving into tiny chambers. Kuijt argues that increased compart- mentalization of space indicates social stresses that resulted from large increases in average settlement size (2000a: 87-94). In southern Jordan, such sites as Basta, Ba'ja and CAin al- Jammam exhibit well-preserved multicellular buildings with walls sometimes standing higher than two meters, and windows and doors with lintels still in place. Sometimes many small rooms surrounded a central larger room or courtyard, as at Basta. Many of these buildings appear to have been two-story houses, with small rooms on the ground floor for storage and livestock and, most likely, living space upstairs. They mark the beginnings of the typical Near Eastern courtyard house. Although rectangular buildings were almost universal by the Late PPNB in the southern Levant, one large structure in Munhata's Level 3 was circular and seems to have had several rooms surrounding a central courtyard. This recalls a clay model of a building from Jericho that shows a rectangular room enclosed by a circular wall to which it is attached by "spoke" walls. What do these possible courtyard houses, whether round or rectangular, tell us about changes in families and households? Keeping in mind the difficulties associated with delineating prehistoric households, these larger, highly differentiated buildings with rooms arranged around courtyards actually do seem organized somewhat like the African compounds that Flannery originally compared with Epipalaeolithic huts (1972: 30-32). If we follow that analogy, we might speculate that they could have housed a social unit larger than a nuclear family, conceivably even a polygamous one. In modem ethnographies, polygamy does tend to be associated with agricultural communities in which women's work is extremely important and large families are necessary to complete agricultural tasks (van den Burghe 1979: 65-67). In a recent update, Flannery argues that Late Neolithic architecture, like that at Hassuna, may have been associated with extended-family households, although he assumes, in contrast to the definition of household provided above, that each nuclear family in such a household "ground its own grain and cooked its own gruel or bread" (Flannery 2002: 427). In Syria and northern Mesopotamia, houses from the Late PPNB and early Ceramic Neolithic became both highly compartmentalized and quite large. At Bouqras near the confluence of the Khabur and Euphrates, for example, complex, multi-roomed houses had ground floors up to one hundred square meters in size (Akkermans et al. 1983) and narrow "rooms" that are likely stairs leading to an upper floor. It is tempting to view these large and complex buildings as the houses of extended-family households. The most extreme examples of this trend are sites in the Jebel Sinjar region with enormous buildings made up of rows of tiny chambers arranged along narrow hallways. These may not be houses, especially since, at Umm Dabaghiya, they accompany tiny houses with a few simple rooms (Kirkbride 1975). If they were storage complexes, their interspersal with what are more clearly houses at NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY 66:1-2 (2003) 15</page><page sequence="13">View of a small, Late Neolithic house with several internal features at Tab northern Jordan.

Such features attest to one of the most important of household activities, food production. Photo courtesy of T. Dabney. Yarim Tepe suggests that they were at least sometimes under household control. In the southern Levant, Yarmoukian houses were less standardized than earlier ones, ranging from simple pit-houses to rectilinear houses with one or two spacious rooms and sometimes smaller storage chambers. At Sha'ar Hagolan, sets of rooms are arranged around courtyards and streets and alleys separate the house compounds from one another. Again, these compounds are candidates for having housed larger social units, such as extended families. Byblos provides considerable evidence for Late Neolithic domestic architecture and settlement layout. During Neolithique Ancien (roughly contem- Fr --. porary with the Yarmoukian industry), rectangular, semi-subterranean, one-room houses, often with rounded corners, had plastered floors and a raised hearth against ?, S ' ;_ one of the end walls. Dunand suggests that the walls did not extend above ground level ' "' ^ &lt;- and reconstructs a tent-like superstructure (1973: 14-15), much like the nomad houses that Cribb finds in modern Turkey (1991: 84-112). Later levels at Byblos include multi- roomed, rectangular structures that seem to ^J^^^^H be arranged around large courtyards (Durand S^32B 1973: 129). Unfortunately, we almost never know where the doorways were located in these buildings, so it is difficult even to speculate on whether these configurations represent large households or conglom- erations of several separate ones. laqat al-Buma, Hassunan and related sites in Syria and anufacture, were northern Iraq show multi-room, rectangular houses, sometimes grouped around courtyards. At Tell Hassuna, the earliest Neolithic "M. ? settlement (Level Ia) consisted of a campsite with outdoor hearths and abandoned pots (Lloyd and Safar 1945: 271). ,; However, a grouping of rectangular adobe buildings, each with tannur ovens and substantial, round grain silos, quickly replaced the campsite. Samarran houses at Tell as-Sawwan were large, multicellular buildings with very standardized designs. (Abu es-Soof 1968: 4-5, 12; 1971: 4). The uppermost strata have houses with T-shaped plans incorporating courtyards, living rooms, small storage rooms, and probable stairways. Lower strata have large, "tripartite" A large limestone mortar in a Late Neolithic house at Tabaqat al-BQma.

The near-symmetry of these large buildings and their duplication of some domestic features on both sides of the courtyard make it tempting to conjecture that they could have housed either extended families or bigamous ones. Halafian and related sites renewed circular plans, with "tholos" houses alongside rectangular architecture. Verhoeven suggests that the contrast between round, beehive-shaped tholoi and rectangular structures may have symbolized a distinction between households and communities (1999: 214). The tholoi were houses and private storage buildings; the larger rectangular structures were for communal storage and activities. Sites of the Wadi Rabah industry typically show long, rectangular houses, most of them like the "broad room" type found more widely during the Chalcolithic of the southern Levant. With only one or two rooms, and roofed areas of about twelve to twenty-five square meters, these could have housed nuclear families. At Tabaqat al-Buma in northern Jordan, however, the site consists of a very small grouping of such structures and could represent an extended-family homestead or a nuclear-family farm with some non-residential buildings. Households and the Domestic Cycle As noted above, house form is dynamic. Goody describes their development in response to changes in household composition as the "developmental cycle" (1962). For example, where there are nuclear-family households, one pattern is for a young married couple to build or buy a house. Later they have children, who eventually grow up and move out, perhaps when they marry. Eventually, the original couple may be alone in the house until infirmity or death takes them away. Patterns in the renovation, dismantling and construction of houses can sometimes provide clues to the stages in each house's life cycle, which we may plausibly associate with stages of the developmental cycle. At CAin Ghazal, the frequent floor replasterings that preserve evidence for the addition and removal of walls allow us to make inferences about changes in household composition over the course of a couple of generations (Banning and Byrd 1987; 1989). In some sites, evidence of door blockings and apparent opening of new doors can similarly suggest such changes, or, as later in Old Babylonian houses, patterns in the inheritance or sale of houses and their rooms (Stone 1987). Among households' functions is the transmission of property and roles at the point in the cycle when the household head dies. Hodder reminds us that this involves the relationship between the transient bodies of individuals and the more permanent roles that they temporarily occupy, including the role of household head (1990: 40). We might expect ritual to accompany such a transition, and indeed the earlier Neolithic shows a tendency to bury some deceased individuals below house floors and to curate their skulls. Although some authors emphasize the possible community-level and integrative aspects of Neolithic burial practices, the close connection between houses and certain deceased individuals suggests it was linked to the transmission of roles and to claims on property. Similarly, Watkins notes that the inhabitants of Qermez Dere periodically demolished pit-houses, filled them in with clean, packed earth and then dug the pit for a new house in almost exactly the same spot (1990). It seems likely that this, too, involved a ritual marking the transmission of the role of household head to an heir. In this case, the physical house, like the deceased, was transitory, and its rebuilding was a metaphor for the rebirth of the household. Household Activities Houses were not only reflections of social relations, they were foci of activities. The increased sedentism and increasing reliance on cereals associated with "domesticated" life appears to have involved increasingly demanding physical tasks around the house. As reliance on hunting decreased, both sexes may have participated in such tedious tasks as grinding grain (Peterson 2002: 111-12). Cooking features, such as hearths and ovens in houses or their courtyards, attest to the final stages of food preparation, while the beginnings of pottery technology seem to be involved largely in the sphere of food distribution, consumption, and entertainment. Although some of the larger vessels are apparently storage containers, it is noteworthy that large proportions of the earliest pottery assemblages consist of cups and bowls, and of decorated pottery, strongly suggesting display in the context of hospitality or feasting. This is interesting in light of hypotheses that posit a relationship between feasting and the rise of agriculture and "big men." Houses were also the locus of child rearing. Until recently, scholars posited fairly universal relationships between child rearing and sexual division of tasks. For example, Brown sees child care as restricting women's labor to non-hazardous tasks in and around the house that demand less concentration or can tolerate frequent interruption (1970). Feminist critiques of this paper have emphasized evidence that in most pre-industrial societies families do not rely only on biological mothers to care for children and childcare does not prevent women from participating in agriculture. A shift of men's labor from hunting to agricultural tasks and probably a share of domestic food processing would have permitted women and some men to keep an eye on children (Peterson 2002: 140-45). It is also important to recognize not only that children could soon participate in agriculture, herding and domestic tasks themselves, but also that increasing need for agricultural labor could encourage households to raise more children. Having said that, we have little or no direct evidence for the lives of Neolithic children, unless some of the figurines are actually toys. What we do know, thanks to osteological evidence, is that some children had a hard life, and child mortality was high. Houses were also the focus of craft production. For example, clay or stone spindle whorls, or pierced ceramic disks that may have functioned as whorls, commonly occur on house floors NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY 66:1-2 (2003) 17</page><page sequence="15">Two clay bull figurines pierced with flints, found intentionally interred below a flagstone feature in a Middle PPNB house at 'Ain Ghazal, Jordan.

In other cases, as at PPNB Beidha and Ba'ja, household crafts included production of stone beads and bracelets. House maintenance and cleaning were also typical domestic activities. Some houses preserve evidence for routine maintenance. McGuire and Schiffer note the tradeoff between initial investments in reliable, low-maintenance architecture and the long-term maintenance requirements of "cheaper" architecture (1983). The frequent use of mud as a building material and common lack of proper foundations made frequent maintenance necessary in Neolithic houses. Many of them, and especially those with plaster floors, show remarkable cleanliness. Miller suggests that the design of Neolithic plaster floors was to facilitate sweeping and mopping (1982), important tasks to reduce the incidence of disease as populations became more concentrated in villages. Watkins remarks on the consistent cleanliness of house floors at Qermez Dere and considers it an aspect of the inhabitants' "constant attention to details of maintenance" (1990: 342; cf. Hodder and Cessford 2004: 23-24). The demands of domestic tasks may ,', --.,^.y also be related to the previously noted .' ^" ' - trend toward differentiation of space.

I _x' .- :-- '</page><page sequence="16">Symbol, Cosmology and Ritual One thing that students of the Neolithic sometimes overlook is the possibility that the separation of religious and secular space that words like "shrine" and "temple" suggest may have made no sense to a Neolithic person. Even in many modern societies, virtually every aspect of houses has symbolic significance, and ritual is a fundamentally domestic activity. Archaeologists have quipped that Neolithic Qatal Hiiyuk was a site in which "every third room's a shrine" (Lekson 1989: 161), but this is not as ridiculous as they suggest. We should seriously consider the possibility that Neolithic houses were sacred spaces. Wall paintings, masks, statues, plastered skulls, and possibly carved posts may have been more common than our biased sample of preserved examples would suggest. We should probably expect Neolithic houses to preserve evidence for cosmological beliefs and to have served as shelters, not only for the living, but also for the dead. House compounds of the Batammaliba, a people of Togo and the Benin Republic, provide an example of just how symbolically rich a house can be (Blier 1987). Construction of these houses begins and ends with sacrifices and other rituals. Second, the house layout is a metaphor for both the human body and the cosmos, various rooms being named after body parts. Third, rituals routinely take place within the houses, some, for example, involving wall painting. Fourth, the house is so closely associated with the household head that it is ritually demolished upon his death and heirs build their houses in a different spot. Given the high degree of standardization in Neolithic house plans at many sites, some cosmological principle could have guided their layout. Extreme symmetry and structuring principles in Ubaid houses, for example, most likely have precursors in Samarran and even earlier houses. It is premature to attach meanings to the bilateral symmetries often found in Neolithic house plans, yet tempting to see metaphors for human body parts in the axial and appendicular arrangements of rooms. Perhaps future research will associate non-architectural symbolic objects with these spaces in ways that will help us decipher them. To date, Near Eastern prehistorians have invested more thought in ritual than in cosmology. Some Neolithic houses show signs of probable foundation deposits, such as tool caches, suggesting that Neolithic house-builders, like their Batammaliba counterparts, began house construction with ritual. Many Neolithic sites show at least some evidence for the decoration of houses with skulls and horns. At Hallan (emi, for example, one house appears to have had an aurochs skull on the north wall, facing the entrance, while sheep skulls and deer antlers found on another house's floors could have had a similar purpose (Rosenberg and Redding 2000: 45-46). At Jerf al-Ahmar, many aurochs horns were found in a circular building, where they may have fallen from the walls (Stordeur 2000). Many rooms at Qatal Hiiyiik had aurochs skulls and vulture beaks projecting from walls and features. It even seems that human skulls were sometimes on display, as at Mureybet IV, and not always buried in caches (Cauvin 2000: 247). Most of the excavators of such phenomena have concluded that the buildings in which they were found were shrines or public buildings; in most cases, however, there is no reason to assume that they were anything but houses. At Qatal Hiiyiik, for example, the "shrines" show plenty of evidence of domestic activities (Hodder and Cessford 2004: 30). In addition, many Neolithic sites show fairly high densities of figurines and intriguing decorated objects that are probably symbolic in some way, whether or not they were involved in cult, shamanism or ritual. These include sculpted pestles and notched "batons" (Kozlowski 2002; Rosenberg and Redding 2000: 52-54), ritually "killed" animal figurines (Rollefson 2000: 167-68), and large numbers of human figurines. The unusual frequency with which human figurines were decapitated, even when the neck was not the weakest part (Kuijt 2000b: 150), suggests intentional "killing" and recalls Wilson's association between domestication and witchcraft (1988: 135-39). Meanwhile, the unbroken state of some fragile figurines "indicates disposal without much handling, perhaps soon after manufacture .... Disposal in inaccessible places and in large groups indicate[s] use as vehicles of magic" (Voigt 2002: 277). Their fairly widespread distribution among buildings suggests that figurines were in common use in houses. At Sha(ar Hagolan, for example, nine figurines were found in the rooms and courtyard of house compound I, while forty-eight figurines were found in the larger compound II (Ben-Shlomo and Garfinkel 2002: 211). Among the strongest evidence for ritual in houses, human remains beneath house floors or embedded in house features made very strong associations between living households and deceased individuals. It is not clear who these individuals were. There are not enough such burials to account for a very large fraction of the populations of Neolithic sites. Nor is it likely that they are all household heads or, in the obvious sense, ancestors, as those of the PPNB, for example, appear to have included both sexes and both adults and children, while those of the Late Neolithic are almost exclusively children. There is some evidence for MPPNB skulls to be grouped in sets of three or its multiples (Kuijt 2000b: 151-54). The only symbolism of which we can be fairly certain, however, is some connection between these individuals and the household or house with NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY 66:1-2 (2003) 19</page><page sequence="17">which they shared space. Perhaps funerary rites associated with houses emphasized the permanence of household roles in the face of individual transience; perhaps they were simply a part of the bereavement process. Or, as Hodder suggests, "the placing of the dead below a house floor ... created a drama in which dark fears were linked to basic loves. The home protected one from the wild and even death" (1990: 39). Still the best example for the ritual use of domestic space is wall decoration at Qatal Hiiytik. As we have seen, one aspect of such decoration incorporated skulls, but wall painting appears to have been even more prominent. Matthews has demonstrated that replastering of walls there occurred frequently, and makes a strong argument that the wall paintings were only visible for short periods before the next replastering covered them (2002). This is consistent with the view that wall painting was an activity associated with periodic rituals, such as rites of passage. It seems likely that Neolithic houses were not merely shelters from the elements or the setting for food preparation, childrearing, and other domestic activities, but mysterious places rich with symbolism and even magic.
