Memorias de la Misi6n Arqueolo6gica Espafiola en el Ecuador 7. Ministerio de Asuntos Exteriores, Direcci6n General de Relaciones Culturales, Madrid, 1981. 120 pp., illus., biblio. Paper. Abstracted by Peter Stahl Anthropomorphic ceramic figurines from Late For- mative and Regional Developmental period context of the northern Ecuadorian and southern Colombian coasts are described and analyzed. Their cultural significance and function are clarified through the rigorous classification of approximately 2,000 specimens presently housed in diverse collections, or obtained through limited excavation. The figurines, which are found in the Tachina, Tumaco-Tolita, Tiaone, and Atacames cultures, reveal information through analyses of "correspondences" of attributes, temporal, spatial and interareal relationships, and the function of the figurines within their cultural realm. Previous classificatory schemes are reviewed and criticized. A revised classification based upon stylistic and typological analysis is presented, yielding data on material culture, physical type, life cycle, economy, society, and religious beliefs. These data are used to discuss the use, significance, and function of Tumaco-Tolita figurines. Previous hypotheses of function are examined and rejected, and Sanchez Montaneis supplants them with the sug- gestion that these figurines represented individuals' rites of passage. Early European Settlement and Exploitation in Atlan- tic Canada: Selected Papers. G. M. STORY, editor. International Symposium on Early European Set- tlement and Exploitation in Atlantic Canada, Memorial University of Newfoundland. St. John's. Newfoundland, 1982. 161 pp., biblio. $10.00 (paper). Abstracted by Dan R. Irwin The selected papers of this 1979 symposium collec- tively shed light on the historical and archaeological background of Atlantic Canada, especially New- foundland. The opening paper offers a sense of pur- pose and meaning to the conference. It aptly sets the scene for the following eight papers by focusing on the processes of colonization, economic penetration, and proselytism which brought Western European nations to this part of North America. Several of the papers deal with recent archaeolog- ical findings at specific sites, namely Red Bay, Labrador, along the Strait of Belle Isle, as well as Cupid's Cove and the Avalon peninsula in Newfound- land. All of these early attempts at settlement were efforts to take advantage of the whale and cod fish- ing nearby. Except for the introduction of the cod fish into European diets, little was known about New- foundland until about 1630. This was due to a lack of interest, ignorance, and misunderstanding of its geography. One paper develops the theme that colonization was unlike that of the New England or Virginia ex- periments, because Newfoundland's exploitation re- quired neither typical settlement patterns, new labor force, nor the production of a crop. A final contributed paper urges ethnologists, his- torians, archaeologists, and anthropologists to make better use of each others' research findings so as to achieve their scientific objectives. All have a role to play in the study of cultural change. The Southeastern Check Stamped Pottery Tradition: A View from Louisiana. IAN W. BROWN. M.C.J.A. Special Paper No. 4, Kent State University Press, Kent, Ohio, 1982. 100 pp., illus., biblio. $6.25 (paper). Abstracted by Carol A. Morrow This monograph presents detailed information about a single pottery type, Pontchartrain Check Stamped, from the Louisiana Gulf Coast area. Al- though Brown's focus is on the Petit Anse region, the fact that 50% of the sites in his study area yielded less than 10 sherds each does not seem to support his claim of a regional perspective. The major source of information for this study is obtained from the Morgan site (34-G-2) on Pecan Island, and Brown does a commendable job of presenting information on the Pontchartrain Check Stamped pottery recovered from the site. Twenty-seven tables and 38 figures are used to summarize a massive amount of primary data on this specific Coles Creek period pottery type. The varieties of this type are defined and illustrated, and the photographic quality of the illustrations overall is quite good. Of particular interest is the excellent review of the southeastern check stamped pottery tradition, discussed in detail by period and region. A bit more integration between this general overview of the check stamping tradition and the analysis of a specific type would have been preferable; however, Brown's paper does represent a major source of in- formation about check stamped ceramics in the Southeast, particularly during the Late Woodland period. Laboratory Techniques in Archaeology: A Guide to the Literature, 1920-1980. LINDA ELLIS, compiler. Garland Publishing, New York, 1982. xiv + 419 pp., index. $36.00 (cloth). Abstracted by Deborah Billings Ellis is to be applauded not solely for the timely publication of a bibliography of laboratory applica- tions of science in archaeology, but also for the ad- mirable execution of this tedious and long-neglected 875</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY task. The bibliography is organized initially by sub- ject, containing the major headings of general works: remote sensing, chronometry, environmental recon- struction, materials analysis, and data management. Finally, and most important to the user, the book pro- vides four indices: geographical area, method, materials, and author. References are to books and articles from a global literature, which at the very least should open the eyes of the often provincial American archaeologist. Titles are given in their original language (German and Russian are trans- lated), and journal references are unabbreviated. In- cluded are major synthetic works as well as local-in- terest reports. Although this effort can by no means claim to be the complete reference work, it unques- tionably attains the modest goal of the author for a "more comprehensive and well-organized bibliog- raphy." Kudos! A worthwhile book. Environmental Archaeology. MYRA SHACKLEY. George Allen and Unwin, London, 1981. xv + 213 pp., illus., biblio., index. $40.00 (cloth), $19.95 (paper). Abstracted by Charles Cobb The objective of this text is explicitly stated as a desire to present a representative guide to various environmental approaches in archaeology. It is in- tended as a general reference, and not as an outline to produce "potted specialists" in each technique. Thus the reader is treated to a concise, yet infor- mative summary of many of the familiar methods used in environmental reconstruction (e.g., paleoeth- nobotany, palynology), as well as some of the more esoteric ones (e.g., the study of microorganisms). Discussion includes all phases of methodology associated with each technique, from sampling to laboratory analysis. Aside from methodological considerations, the author repeatedly underlines the importance of using environmental studies to view archaeological sites in their full context. Too often the vital ecological data are slighted for an emphasis upon artifacts and structural information. Because it is written by one author, the format of the text benefits from a cohesiveness commonly lack- ing in a collection of techniques presented by several experts. Chapters are structured along the same lines, with especially enlightening sections demonstrating archaeological applications of each method. Although chapters on each topic are of necessity somewhat brief, each ends with an ex- cellent bibliography to guide the student to more com- prehensive literature.

Kent State Research Papers in Archaeol- ogy, Number 3, Kent State University Press, Kent, Ohio, 1981. 96 pp., illus., biblio. $6.00 (paper). Abstracted by Katharine Fernstrom The three sites that are the subjects of these mono- graphs are located in southeast and south-central Ohio. They represent three diverse archaeological complexes spanning the Late Woodland and early Mississippian periods. Raven Rocks is defined as a special activity site. Prufer postulates that the faunal butchering patterns and high numbers of bone tools suggest that the site was used for some special activity rather than as a hunting camp, but the type of special activity is unknown. The site is dated roughly to the ninth cen- tury A.D, and the occupational chronology was reconstructed from a C-14 date (A.D. 860 to 1000), stratigraphy, the "typological range" of chipped stone, and ceramics (Peters Cordmarked). At the Wise Rockshelter, the majority of the material postdates A.D. 700 and suggests an often- used, short-term campsite. In particular, the recovered materials are consistent with those from other Late Woodland rockshelters such as Rais, Stanhope. and Peters B. 'The site was badly dis- turbed, and no C-14 samples were collected, so the occupation date was assigned on the basis of the large number of triangular points recovered. The Tower site appears to be a late thirteenth-cen- tury hilltop village. The pit and refuse features are apparently arranged around a central plaza, and the majority of recovered ceramics are regional variants of Monongahela types. A C-14 date of A.D. 1290, the site's configuration, and the ceramics support the idea that the Tower site represents an extension of the Monongahela phase from Pennsylvania into southeast Ohio. On the basis of the presence/absence patterns of faunal and floral remains, Raven Rocks appears to have been occupied in the fall and/or winter, while the Wise Rockshelter's patterns suggests a late sum- mer foraging camp or a winter cervid processing camp. The differences in site configurations, seasonality, dates, and recovered artifacts from these three sites indicate the rich diversity of the late Woodland tradition in Ohio and furthermore suggest the indigenous transition towards more complex lifeways in the late prehistoric period in this region.
