<plain_text><page sequence="1">Mountains and cities in Cambodia: Temple architecture and divine vision Michael W. Meister In an article in The New York times reporting on an exhibition of unbuilt mid career Frank Lloyd Wright projects?under a subheadline 'The designs of a genius-in-progress'?Herbert Muschamp writes that 'what's striking about all these projects is that Wright proceeded as if he, personally, had discovered America' (1997: 29). He goes on to say that 'Sybil Maholy-Nagy was not exaggerating when she observed that Wright was the first architect in history who felt obliged to design an entire continent.' How much more had the architects of sacred monuments in South and Southeast Asia undertaken in attempting, in their built projects, to reveal the design of not just a continent but a cosmos. The extraordinary generosity of the Cambodian people in the loan of their cultural heritage for an international exhibition, 'Sculpture of Angkor and Ancient Cambodia: Millennium of Glory' (Jessup and Zephir 1997),' gives me the opportunity to place the enormous accomplishments of their architects into the context of the South Asian architecture I most directly study (Meister and Dhaky 1983; Meister, Dhaky, and Deva 1988).2 When one first visits the sprawling twelfth-century complex of Angkor Vat in Cambodia, its towers on the horizon can remind one of a modern American city, its sky-scrapers a marker of today's commerce. As a resident of center-city Philadelphia, I have watched such towers grow in recent years, noting the way they now control the view of this city along the great ribbons of modern highways. The horizontal galleries and other structures of each terrace at Angkor Vat suggest the scale and type of urban wooden and tile architecture of cities in ancient India, as represented, for example, in the narrative reliefs on cardinal gateways to the Buddhist st?pa at S?nc? early in the first century CE International Journal of Hindu Studies 4, 3 (December 2000): 261-68 ? 2003 by the World Heritage Press Inc.</page><page sequence="2">262 / Michael W. Meister (Coomaraswamy 1992). The central towers of Angkor?which is a name derived from a Sanskrit term, nagara, meaning 'city' (Dagens 1997: 23)?lead the viewer across a moat and along a causeway that expands the depth of the complex to twice its width. Two rectilinear terraces, ringed by long-galleried cloisters, stretch out horizontally, defining the visitor's horizon. These terraces focus toward a raised square centered complex, also enclosed by cloisters, set to the back of the second rectangular terrace. Curvilinear towers mark the corners of this west-facing square enclosure that surrounds a still higher towering central shrine. This upper enclosure, in part, follows the quinquox form of the Mah?bodhi temple at Bodhgaya in India, built early in the first millennium CE to house an anthropomorphic image of the Buddha (then rebuilt more or less in its present form early in the seventh century CE).3 In French scholarship on Cambodia, such a terraced structure has been called a 'temple-mountain,' which indeed such a structure is.4 Yet large royal temples in India?with a series of inner ambula tories, upper stories, and enclosures?had also always been classified as 'Meru' temples after Mount Meru, the mountain at the center of India's universe (Meister and Dhaky 1983: 234-47). The metaphor itself is not sufficient expla nation of the architectural form. A temple in India is also both a 'palace' (pr?s?da) and a 'city' (pura), like the 'three cities* that make up the universe in the myth of Siva as savior of the tripura (three cities) (Meister 1984). As the French scholar Bernard Groslier points out, Angkor's own 'inscriptions state the matter quite explicitly' (1962: 179). He cites one in particular, referring to Angkor Thorn, that reads: 'The city,...enriched with a palace of precious stones, was espoused by [Jayavarman VII]...in order to procreate the happiness of the universe' (Groslier 1962: 179 80). Of the peculiar importance of the construction of such city centers in the Angkor period in Cambodia, Groslier presciently writes: The city...is thus seen to be more than a simple concentration of inhabitants with a temple for the gods who protect it. It is a rational way of exploiting the soil, using natural resources to the best effect, making up for their scarcity, and even for their absence....Without it, it [Cambodia] could not have supported the enormously increased population, or produced the surplus necessary for a great nation stratified into specialised callings (1962: 97). It is an irony of modern history that Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge chose to empty the cities of Cambodia in order to control and decimate her population. Groslier, in attempting to find a source for the startling new architectural form</page><page sequence="3">Temple architecture and divine vision I 263 of the tenth-century 'temple-mountain' of Bakong, observes that 'contrary to what is often supposed, in the field of architecture, and more especially in the field of religious art, creations springing from the void are extremely rare' (1962: 99). He continues, however, all through this period we have seen that Java exercised a manifold influence in every field. But no one, it would seem, has yet realised the astonishing resemblance between Bakong and Borobudur....The likeness is indeed striking, if one remembers that one is a Buddhist and the other a Sivaite shrine. Yet tor both of these great monuments, now mentally more than physically, models must be found in India. The central Cambodian temple-tower, much like those in North India in the seventh century, is cardinally oriented, with projections toward the four quarters marked as doorways and a pyramidal or slightly curved tower of receding stories marked by dormers at the center and aediculae at the corners. These are some times pavilions, miniature towers, or merely flame-like n?gas (foliated snakes). The suggestion always is of a series of altar-like levels (bh?mis), as can be seen in one of the thirteenth-century reliefs from the Bayon (see Jessup and Zephir 1997:88, Figures 6, 7). These temple-towers in Cambodia may never develop the elaborately condensed symbolic morphology of Hindu structures in India proper (Meister 1986b), yet they consistently continue to find locally rooted means to express in material ways the cosmology those structures were meant to embody. Bruno Dagens comments of Angkor Vat that 'one could almost say that it was built between the sea and the sky' (1997: 23).5 These temple-cities in Cambodia integrate vast irrigation networks as part of the water cosmology of ancient India (for which see Coomaraswamy 1993). Moats surrounding temples root the temple in the ocean of cosmic creation in India's myth, as do temple-tanks, or lakes, or the ocean itself in the temples of India. The snakes that act as balus trades on Angkor's causeways are like the n?gar?jas (snake kings) of early Hindu worship, fine stone examples of which survive from the second/third century CE in the Mathura Museum and the Mus?e des Arts asiatique-Guimet, Paris (Zimmer 1983, I: Plate 77). India's Gupta kings signaled their protection of the land of the Aryans in North India with their great relief of Visnu as the boar-headed Varaha (the earth as a female clinging to his tusk and the personified ocean receiving with homage the two great sacred rivers of northern India) carved at the central Indian site of Udaigiri early in the fifth century CE (Zimmer 1983, 2: Plate 109). So, too,</page><page sequence="4">264 / Michael W. Meister had the Khmer kings marked their control of territory by building the 'temple mountains' of Cambodia. No structure symbolizes this cosmic synergy better than the small, single spired temple of Neak Pean, set on circular terraces in the center of a square water tank flowing into cardinal pools into the irrigation canals of Angkor (Jessup and Zephir 1997: 97-98). Of this temple's 'reconstruction of sacred geography,' Groslier writes: This tower-sanctuary, representing paradise floating on the primaeval ocean, rises on circular foundations in the middle of a square basin. Water from the main basin flows down to four smaller tanks round from fountains in little shrines. It is the symbol of a miraculous lake in the Himalayas where all illnesses were cured....The waters of Neak Pean, judiciously redistributed by canals, flowed towards the four points of the compass and there transformed the rivers and liquid arteries of Angkor into as many magic streams (1962: 181-82). The great temple-city of Angkor Vat, therefore, surrounds a central tower as both mountain and axis, marking a point of cosmic origination as does each Hindu temple, its enlarged plan mapping the shape of the created universe. The square plan of the five-towered central complex must be seen to mimic the square building diagram (v?stumandala) used in India in the early centuries BCE to construct ritually effective altars for sacrifice and as a means to plan temple shelters from at least the sixth century CE (Meister 1979).6 The Hindu myth sees creation springing from a point and expanding into a square shape to mark the cardinal directions (Menon 1932). At the center of the diagram is the place for Brahman, the sacred essence that precedes creation. Around the periphery of the diagram are placed a range of minor divinities to protect the created world from chaos. At the center of early altars the pillar of Siva was placed, as it would later be placed in the center of the sanctum of ?aiva temples. Their presence radiating through the walls of shrines, images placed on the exterior mark the central deity and give defense to the temple's comers. As the Hindu temple developed, its vertical axis that marked cosmic parturi tion and the Vedic ritual of sacrifice was matched by an 'axis of access,' the horizontal extension of the temple that provided approach (Meister 1991). In South India in the second millennium CE, as earlier in the temple complexes at Angkor, temples began to reach out along this axis to incorporate part of a city's more mundane world within a series of extended enclosures (Zimmer 1983, 2: Plates 402-3). Increasingly large temple-gateways marked the passing</page><page sequence="5">Temple architecture and divine vision I 265 generations of royal patrons. These temple-cities of South India, like the long surrounding galleries of Angkor Vat, make material the integration of the royally created world and the sacred geography symbolized by the temple itself. In Cambodia, Hindu deities began to be worshiped by rulers from the seventh century CE onwards. Saivism was popular in the early centuries; Angkor Vat was originally dedicated to Visnu; Buddhism supplanted these Hindu deities by the end of the twelfth century during the reign of Jayavarman VII (Giteau 1997). Neither architectural form nor the underlying symbolism of the creation of an ordered world and its integration with an ordered state, however, changed. In India, the task of giving shelter to an emblem of divinity had taken many forms. Open-air altars could mark the presence of nature spirits (yaksas). Thatched huts gave shelter to powerful forest ascetics; st?pas for Br?hmanical and Buddhist use (ritual foci based on earlier burial mounds) were equated with the presence of the living teacher and sheltered in rock-cut apsidal assembly halls in the first centuries BCE and CE, modeled on the wood urban architecture of ancient India (Meister 1992). As Hindu deities were given physical form in the early centuries CE, sanctums to shelter these manifestations of divinity were defined as caves, enclosing temple wails as mountains and the temple's exterior as an expansion of the ritual altar. The inner space of these temples surrounds the 'place for Brahman' of the ancient diagram used for building altars, the v?stumandala. This sanctum acts as one altar?where divinity takes visible form and becomes approachable? that defines the dimension of the upper flat surface of the temple's tower, the uttaraved? or 'upper altar,* where the divine essence remains invisible. The walls of the North Indian temple also project the dimension of the inner sanctum as one layer of offsetting masonry on the temple's exterior walls and the dimension of the central, most sacred 'place for Brahman' as a central offset on each wall carrying niches that house images of deities related to the interior divinity (Meister 1986a). Conceptually but not physically present, the brahmasth?na at the center of the sanctum extends vertically through the heart of the temple, emerging from the top of the uttaraved? as the round shaft of a cosmic pillar marking the temple as a point of cosmic parturition; this shaft is crowned by a stone in the shape of the distinctive ribbed seed of the amala fruit and by a pot finial, symbolically carrying lustral waters (Meister 1990). The cube of the sanctum supports a curvilinear tower in North India, the body of which is decorated with a condensed architectural ornament suggesting a multiterraced palace (Meister 1989). This palatial structure for the body of the temple can be even more clearly seen in South Indian temple architecture, where a structure such as the Dharmar?ja ratha at Mamallapuram of the seventh</page><page sequence="6">266 / Michael W. Meister century CE shows each terrace and enclosing gallery miniaturized. It is to such a concentric, terraced, palatial structure in India that the vast city mountains of Angkor can best be compared. The apsarases, gods, and demons of Angkor's great monuments people their realm but at a scale where real people can become a part of that divine host. The morphology of the temple as world city has not changed; by becoming larger, it has been brought to earth. At Angkor Thorn, late in the twelfth century, Jayavarman VII made the cosmic consonance of his city, and that of the universe, clear by surrounding his monument with the struggle of gods and demons to 'churn' the cosmic ocean, using his palatial temple as churning stick, thus creating the elixir of life (Dagens 1997: 34). Here and on the Bayon, he also had his architects begin to place gigantic faces emerging from the towers and gateways of his monuments. This interpretation of the monument seems a reasonable one, given that in the myth of the churning of the ocean, the 'churning stick' is said to have been Mount Meru. Jean Boisselier, in contrast, uses a variety of inscriptions to argue that the yaksas and n?gas guard Angkor Thorn as the model of Indra's city and that the large faces on each of the four gateways represent the Lokap?las or Four Great Kings that guard the directions. These enigmatic 'portrait' faces do not represent the king as a god, as some have said, but return architectural form to the image of man. The celestial cities of paradise can be made manifest on this earth, in Cambodia, to govern and water the living fields. Boisselier sees the building of Angkor Thorn as the literal realization of Indra's celestial city on earth, monument by monument, describing Preah Khan, for example, with its surrounding garudas, as 'the Palace of Indra's Victory, or Vaijayanta Pr?s?da' (1997: 120). I once intuitively annotated a snapshot of four friends in front of a temple at Khajuraho: 'four temples and a pile of stone.' It is the humanizing of concepts that in India can seem greatly abstracted?this making cosmology both material and pragmatic?that is one of Cambodia's great and lasting contributions to ancient India's cultural world.

Other terraced Hindu and Buddhist temples existed at sites such as Pawaya, Laurya Nandangarh, and Paharpur in the first millennium CE in India. These terraced structures have been identified as eduka by Krishna Deva, with reference to Visnudharmottara Pur?na, a seventh-century text (Meister, Dhaky, and Deva 1988 1988: 22-24). 4.
