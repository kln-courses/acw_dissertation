Yurco I In the closing two lines of Cairo Museum Stela No. 34025, verso, and its fragmentary duplicate in the temple of Karnak in the Cour de la Cachette, is found the following text of Pharaoh Merenptah (1212-1202 B.C.): The princes, prostrated, say "Shalom"; None raises his head among the Nine Bows. Now that Tehenu has come to ruin Hatti is pacified; Canaan has been plundered into every sort of woe. Ashkelon has been overcome. Gezer has been captured, Yanocam was made non-existent, Israel is laid waste (and) his seed is not. Hurru has become a widow because of Egypt. All lands have united themselves in peace. * This paper, read initially as a lecture in Toronto, at the annual meeting of the Society for the Study of Egyptian Antiquities, in November 1977, appeared as an abstract in the society's SSEA Journal VIII, no. 3 (1978), 70. Another version, "Merenptah's Campaign in Canaan*," Biblical Archaeology Review, forthcoming, has ample photographic documenta- tion and accompanies a related study by Dr. Lawrence E. Stager. I wish to thank all those who encouraged and aided this study, especially Dr. William J. Murnane, Dr. Edward F. Wente, Dr. Lawrence E. Stager, and Dr. Jean Lauffrey, former head of the Franco- Egyptian Center at Karnak, with whose kind permission I was allowed to study the loose blocks from the original wall with Merenptah's battle reliefs at Karnak, the subject of this study. These have now been reconstructed in a study by Franchise Le Saout, "Reconstitu- tion des Murs de la Cour de la Cachette," Cahiers de Karnak VII (1978-81), 228-32, 252, pl. IV, 4a-b, and 257, pl. IX, 4c. Anyone who was restless, he has been subdued by the King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Ba-en-Re-mery-Amun, son of Re, Merenptah -hotep- her mact, granted life like Re, daily.1 This famous text, the "Israel" stela, was dis- covered in 1896 by Petrie in the ruins of 1 Translated with the advice of Dr. Edward F. Wente. The versification is my suggestion and varies from that of Lawrence E. Stager, "Merenptah and the Sea Peoples: New Light on an Old Relief," Eretz Israel 18 (1985) and also that of G. W. Ahlstrom and D. Edelman, "Merenptah's Israel," Journal of Near Eastern Studies 44 (1985), 59-61, as well as G. W. Ahlstrom, Who Were the Israelites? (Winona Lake, IN, 1986), 39. Dr. Stager, Biblical Archaeology Review, forth- coming, has agreed with my versification. Canaan and Hurru in parallel structure makes more geographical sense, as both are regional terms, than linking Israel and Hurru, or Israel and Canaan, as well as Tehenu and Hatti with Hurru in parallelism. Ashkelon, Gezer, Yanocam, and Israel then may be understood as subregional units, city states and a people within the region Canaan.

On this stela, and also on the fragmentary dup- licate Karnak stela, Merenptah names three city- states (Ashkelon, Gezer, and Yanocam) and for the first time in history, Israel- a people without a fixed city-state, to judge by the writing Y&amp;fi of its determinative, and contrasting this sign with A/». used as determinative for the three cities.3 These are set within the context of two regional refer- ences: the Canaan, described as plundered into every sort of woe, and Hurru (Khor), said to have become a widow because of Egypt. Canaan as a definite region, with Gaza as its capital, is well attested in XlXth Dynasty texts, and included within its territory, Ashkelon, Gezer, and even Yanocam.4 In the reign of Merenptah, Gaza, the capital, was called Gdt, and not Pa-Canaan, as in some other reigns;5 accordingly, Pa-Canaan in the Merenptah stelae most likely refers to the region. Hurru (Khor) is used in a more general sense to indicate most, if not all, of Egypt's Syro- Palestinian realm.6 Accordingly, the texts of the stelae can be construed as Hurru becoming a widow because of Merenptah's plundering of the region of Canaan. This text of the two stelae was long dismissed by some scholars as simply a literary allusion with little historical worth, although others hesi- tantly gave it historical value because of Meren- ptah's Amada Stela which, in the King's titulary, calls him wcf KM^r, "subduer of Gezer."7 The other evidence that has come to play a key role in this study is a series of battle reliefs located in the temple of Karnak, Thebes, in Egypt. The reliefs are found on the transverse axis of the temple, on the outer western face of the Cour de la Cachette, the court between the Hypostyle Hall and the Vllth Pylon of Thutmose 2 W. F.

XIII-XIV. 3 Reading the text: YsrSr fkt, bn prt-f, so too essentially, Fecht, Fontes atque Pontes, 113, line 169, and Hornung, Fontes atque Pontes, 232, line 169, as well as most earlier studies. The reading Ysyrijr rmt •/ kt proposed by Helmut Engle, "Die Siegesstele des Merenptah: Kritischer Uberblick iiber die verschiedenen Versuche historischer Auswertung des Schlussabschnitts," Biblica 60 (1979), 383-87, is unacceptable because it creates insurmountable difficulties. First, as Alan H. Gardiner, Egypt of the Pharaohs (Oxford, 1961), 37, observes: rmt was used strictly for Egyptians and not applied to foreigners, such as Israel, who each had their own partic- ular ethnic name with appropriate determinatives added. Thus YsrSr without j&amp;9 as determinative makes no sense, as^ alone signifies only "foreigner"; see Alan H. Gardiner, Egyp- tian Grammar, 3rd ed. (Oxford, 1957), 513, Signlist T-14. So Ysrjr requires ej cj to signify "people," just as Ashkelon, Gezer, and Yanocam require^ plus r^n to signify "foreign country state." Further, Engle' s transliteration Ysyrilr is faulty, failing to recognize group writing, conventionally utilized in writing foreign names (Gardiner, Grammar, 52, §60). Engle' s other objections to the traditional translitera- tion are to some extent illusory. Ysr^r is a collective writing (Gardiner, Grammar, 60-61, §77). The reference back to it with masculine singular -/is correct syntactically since collec- tives function as singulars. Perhaps the masculine was used because the Egyptian scribe was aware of the use of Israel as the name of an eponymous ancestor. As for fkt, the form is probably to be emended to fkw (so Fecht, Fontes atque Pontes, 113, line 169), a stative. As Gardiner, Grammar, 234, §309, notes, substitution of t for ti as the feminine singular stative ending was common. The scribe may have confused gender because in Egyptian, names of foreign countries were regarded as syntactically feminine (Gardiner, Grammar, 69, §92). Also, in Late Egyptian, the stative ending is ti or tw, and a simple t substitution is not all that significant; see Jaroslav Cerny and Sarah Israelit Groll, A Late Egyptian Grammar, Studia Pohl, Series Maior, no. 4 (Rome, 1975), 195-97, and also the remarks of Wilson in ANET, 378, n. 18. Between the possible confusion of gender in the stative and the variability of stative endings in Late Egyptian, the error of fkt lor fkw is understandable. 4 Alan H.

In the battle reliefs, one town is named (Ashkelon), and another shows a Prince Khaemwaset. Over the two scenes to the left of the treaty text, the band of text below the cornice of the wall shows a trace of inscription- and it names Ramesses II. These three bits of evidence - the treaty stela, Prince Khaemwaset, and the band of text - long led most scholars to assign these reliefs to Ramesses II, particularly to the period shortly after the Battle of Kadesh. The usual analysis was that Ramesses II's strategic losses after the Battle of Kadesh were so severe that he had to begin anew the conquest of Syria- Palestine from deep in southern Canaan, having to retake Ashkelon.9 Even Kitchen in his monu- mental Ramesside Inscriptions, and in ancillary studies, classified these reliefs with those of Ramesses II, although he had noticed that the cartouches in the battle reliefs were usurped and showed traces of Sety II (1199-1193 B.C.) over those of Merenptah (1212-1202 B.C.). His main reason was the presence of Prince Khaemwaset, whom he associated with Ramesses II's well- known son.10 II The usurped cartouches are the key to the question of which king commissioned these battle reliefs; and my epigraphic collations of the cru- cial ones are shown below. This data was col- lected in 1976-77 while I was in Egypt as a member of the Epigraphic Survey of the Oriental Institute, University of Chicago, and collected material for my own research in my spare time. The late Dynasty XIX monuments are replete with usurpation, a practice that even has impli- cations for the royal succession. Even a cursory examination of these reliefs shows in several cartouches traces of Sety II over those of Meren- ptah, as even a photograph can show (fig. 11); and careful collation of them in company with my colleague, Dr. William J. Murnane, con- firmed the findings presented below. I examined these reliefs on a number of occasions subse- quently; and from these collations it became clear that Merenptah was the pharaoh originally named in the cartouches, and that Ramesses II was not named in them at all. Below are collated copies of the cartouches, supported by photographs. They are located by my numbering of the reliefs: Ashkelon, Scene 1; unnamed city besieged, lower register left of Ramesses II's treaty, Scene 2; upper register left of treaty, unnamed city, Scene 3; scene in upper register above Ashkelon, Scene 4; binding of captives (Shasu), Scene 5; prisoner collection and bundling, upper register, Scene 6; prisoners marched off to Egypt, lower register, Scene 7; upper register totally lost; presentation of pris- oners to Theban gods, lower register, Scene 8; upper register lost, except for loose blocks, Scene 9; triumph, large-scale, over northern foes, Scene 10 (preserved only on loose blocks now located in the field west of the battle reliefs).

Scene 2 (see figs. 10-11) (1) Cartouches over the king, standing astride prisoners and smiting a Canaanite within the city. (2) Cartouche in text over the horses' backs, Scene 2, being held by Prince Khaemwaset.

Original version Second version Final version Notes: Merenptah's prenomen and nomen traces lie .9 cm below the original surface on average, while those of Sety II range from .7 to .85 cm deep. This can be seen where Merenptah's traces, being deeper, seem to interrupt those of Sety II. Very scant traces of the ^ and ^ of Amenmesse's nomen lie about .45 cm deep; one trace appears just above the d of Sety II's nomen, the other between the stroke of Merenptah and the J of Sety II. The cartouches are shaved and scored to a depth of .15 to .4 cm. The purpose of the scoring was to improve the hold of a coat of plaster applied over the name to be obliterated, first Merenptah's and later Amenmesse's, in this case. A small trace of the plaster still remained in the back of the ram when I examined it. Amenmesse's traces are so few because of their relatively shallow cutting, .45 cm. Sety II's traces at a depth of .7-. 85 cm sufficed to obliterate all but the scant traces noted. It is probable that the plaster was applied both by Amenmesse and again by Sety II. The variation of the depth of Sety II's hieroglyphs results from carving over stone and plaster, the tools cutting more easily into the plastered areas than into the stone. The shaving of the surface of the cartouches is probably the work of Sety II. This is shown by a pair of cartouches of Merenptah on which usurpation was started but not carried to completion. They occur with the figure of Merenptah seated on the knees of the ram of Amun, on the inner eastern wall of the Cour de la Cachette (fig. 12). They are hacked, or scored, but seem not to have been reinscribed. Yet they are not shaved, as are those where Sety II ultimately placed his name. C. Loose block from the presentation of prisoners, Scene 8 (see figs. 17-18) Kitchen, KRI II, 167, 6-9, agrees that this block is from these war scenes, but see Le Saout, Cahiers de Karnak VII (1978-81), 231 and 252, pl. IV, 4b, who positions it in Scene 8. D. Loose block, from the top of a scene (see figs. 19-20) Split diagonally; king in blue crown, moving left, holds bow; probably is in a chariot (see fig. 19, lower part only and fig. 20). Cf. Le Saout, Cahiers de Karnak VII (1978-81), 232, 4c(a), and 257, pl. IX, 4c. The war scenes lacking the king's figure are Scenes 3 and 4, in both of which the king's horses rear to attack the foe. In neither scene are arrows visible in the surviving parts of the scene, but the king's horses are rearing in both, indicating attack. On this loose block the trace of the bow indicates that it is slack, not drawn, but the king's demeanor may be one of attack, using a spear or sword. The block may be assignable to either Scene 3 or 4, with perhaps Scene 4 the more likely, as the block shows no trace of erasure of earlier scenes. Scene 3, by contrast, was carved over an earlier, erased scene. The other loose block published by Le Saout, Cahiers de Karnak VII (1978-81), 232, 4c(b) 257, pl. IX, 4c, depicting a dead Canaanite foe and two lines of rhetorical royal text, also might belong to Scene 4. The conclusions that may be drawn from this survey of the wall and the loose blocks are that Ramesses II did not carve these reliefs (contrary to Le Saout, Cahiers de Karnak VII [1978-81], 229, with n. 98), but that they are the original</page><page sequence="10">198 JARCE XXIII (1986) Fig. 11.

Cartouche in text over the horses' backs. Notes: Merenptah's signs lie at an average depth of .6-. 7 cm below the original surface. Again scoring and hacking have been utilized .55 -.9 cm deep; but, significantly, around the anthropomorphic sungod, there is neither shaving nor scoring, showing that all three versions used this hieroglyph. The trace of Amenmesse's £ is carved .65 cm deep, accounting for the survival of its tip and base (shaving at those points is .55 cm). Sety IFs hieroglyphs range .4 cm to .7 cm deep. The sum of this evidence again shows that Sety IFs prenomen is the last version, the range of depths showing that it was carved in plaster and stone. The reed leaf cut only .4 cm deep vanishes inside the ram (.7 cm deep) but the t^iiand ram are both at .7 cm deep and thus the back of the ram and top of the mn sign seem to merge. The pattern of usurpation thus is similar to that in the cartouches over the king in this scene. Merenptah's name, the original version, was hacked and plastered by Amenmesse, but then Sety II shaved and plastered it before recutting his name over the two earlier versions. All three versions could employ the anthropomorphic sun-god because, as shown by Henri Gauthier (Le Livre des Rois d'Egypte, MIFAO 17-21 [1907-1917], vol. Ill, 127, 1; 128 III; and 135 XIII) and in my reconstruction of the three versions, all three kings used variants in which the anthropomorphic sun-god appeared. Note too that Amenmesse also could reuse the anthropomorphic Amun and ^ hieroglyphs of Merenptah. It seems very likely that Amenmesse's and Sety IFs variant cartouches arose from the extensive usurpation of each of their predecessor's monuments. Again, the evidence of this cartouche is that Merenptah commissioned the original relief, as his traces are the most uniform in depth. A further point arising from this finding is that the prince Khaemwaset who appears in this scene holding the chariot team over which the text appears, must be the son of Merenptah, and so may be called Khaemwaset II; he should not be identified as the like-named son of Ramesses II. work of Merenptah, later usurped by Amenmesse, and finally by Sety IF Further, the Karnak reliefs suggest that Merenptah's campaign in Canaan should be accepted as historical fact.11 IV Now that the reliefs are seen not to depict Ramesses IFs exploits and are added to those of Merenptah, several other points need to be addressed. The reliefs may now be associated with the closing lines of the Israel and Karnak stelae. The link is made through the named fortress in Scene 1, Ashkelon. The remaining associations are made through the sequence of places on the stelae, which match the arrange- ment of scenes on the wall: Scene 2, Gezer; Scene 3, Yanocam; Scene 4, Israel. Further support comes from the writing of the names on the Israel Stela and the themes of the scenes shown on the wall. Scenes 2 and 3 (figs. 3-4) show fortresses under attack, unfortunately unnamed. Scene 4 (fig. 5) differs, in that no fortress is depicted; nor was there ever one present. The ground rises gently to the left in Scene 4, and the key to the absence of a fort is the position of pharaoh's chariot. Despite heavy loss of the upper parts of Scene 4, it is clear from the rear hooves of the 11 To the evidence supporting the historicity of this cam- paign should be added an epithet found in Merenptah's titulary in the temple of Amada, Nubia, on his wall stela, w cf Kid^r, "Subduer of Gezer"; see KRI IV, 1 (line 9); Krauss in LA IV, 72 and 75, n. 14 s.v., ''Merenptah"; and Gardiner, AEO I, 184*.</page><page sequence="12">200 JARCE XXIII (1986) Fig. 14.

Detail of text over the king's horses. king's horses, that if the king's chariot and horses are reconstructed from extant traces, pha- raoh's horses nearly would touch the left margin of the scene and the pilaster of Ramesses IFs Peace Treaty. The difference readily may be seen by comparing the traces of pharaoh's horses in Scene 4 with those of his horses in Scene 1 (see fig. 5). Scene 1 (fig. 2) has the balanced composi- tion of the fortress at the left and the king in the chariot at the right. In Scene 4, pharaoh's chariot is in the center and so the rearing horses' front hooves almost would have touched the left end of the scene. No fort can be positioned at the left end; rather, the king is charging a mass of enemies. Thus Scene 4 matches the description of Israel in the stela, for it is there written M"^0mW?&gt; YsrSr/l, the determinative signi- fying a people without a specific city state, as contrasted with Ashkelon, Gezer, and Yanocam, all with the determinative q^d.12 Consequently, the parallel between the Israel stela and the Karnak Merenptah reliefs is perfect - three for- tified towns and one people battling in open country. Such a battle in open country is attested in other Ramesside war scenes, notably at Beit el-Wali, where Ramesses II attacks a Nubian village.13 Note that in the Beit el-Wali scene also, 12 See n. 3 above. Ahlstrom, Who Were the Israelites, 40, too facilely dismisses the significance of determinatives. The battle reliefs provide the basis for the Israel Stela text and indicate that the people determinative is appropriately used. Further, there is no other textual support in Egyptian sources for Ahlstrom' s proposal that Israel originated as a territorial name. 13 H. Ricke, G. R. Hughes, and E. F.

This certainly overstates the case.

Cartouches before the king's face, prisoner binding scene. Notes: The nomen shows evidence of scoring and shaving to a depth of .5 cm at the top and left sides; the remainder of both cartouches was later gouged too heavily to estimate. Merenptah's hieroglyphs are cut .9-1.0 cm deep below the original surface, while Sety IPs vary from .5-. 85 cm in depth. Thus once again, the variability of depth in Sety II's hieroglyphs suggests that they are the latest version. Despite the deep gouging of the wall in this scene, the cartouche frame of the nomen shows traces of two or possibly three different versions. Those of Merenptah extend farther down into the gouges because of their deeper cutting. This supports the view that Merenptah commissioned the original version. Some questionable traces of Amenmesse's nomen possibly are present. Of these, the likeliest is a trace running beside the stem of the central reed leaf of Sety II's nomen and then cutting across it. It could be a trace of /f|, lying slightly below the .80 cm depth of the reed leaf. It does not fit any of the signs of Merenptah's nomen; therefore it probably belongs to a second version, which would be that of Amenmesse. Concerning the other traces visible in the photograph, in the lower part of the nomen, «=*=, at .95 cm deep could be from Merenptah's name in a variant seen on a loose block possibly from this wall (see below, D). The traces of 1 T that Kitchen (KRI II, 166, 11 and n. lla) claimed to have seen are very doubtful, lying 1.0 cm deep in an area affected by heavy gouging. If accepted, their depth would require that they belong to Merenptah. Once more, then, the inscription sequence seems to be Merenptah as the original, Amenmesse usurping, and finally Sety II usurping from Amenmesse. the chariot is positioned toward the middle of the scene, and that it is followed by two smaller char- iots beariner the kine's sons. Merenptah's Karnak Scene 4 probably had a similar arrangement; though its upper part now is destroyed, loose blocks from this wall lie scattered in the open field to the west of the wall. Among several with portions of war scenes, one probably should be assigned to this scene. Loose block, very likely from Scene 4 The block shows a prince in a chariot moving left (figs. 21-22). See also Le Saout, Cahiers de Karnak VII (1978-81), 232 and pl. IX, 4c. I cannot agree with her (p. 232, n. 117) that this is Ramesses II's ninth son, Sety, who in no hitherto attested examples has his name deliberately erased, as does this prince. Sety-merenptah, Egyptians certainly did introduce details and inscriptional data to make it clear just what sort of peoples and places were depicted. Therefore, the scene genera included a type without a fortress (such as Beit el-Wali, the Nubian village, and Scene 4 in the Merenptah reliefs) for villages and encampments, and fortresses when a town or fortification was intended. The fortresses in Merenptah's reliefs are, following the classifi- cation of Alexander Badawy, A History of Egyptian Archi- tecture: The Empire, or the New Kingdom (Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1968), 448-55, scene 1 (Ashkelon) type IIIA (mis- located in the Ramesseum); scene 2 (Gezer) type IIA; and scene 3 (Yanocam) type IIA, all the Palestinian (Canaanite) types.</page><page sequence="14">202 JARCE XXIII (1986) Fig. 16.

Notes: The cartouche on this block shows the prenomen of Sety II; but as the photograph shows, it has been shaved back and scored, signifying usurpation. Upon close examination, traces of the earlier version were found. They belong to Merenptah (not as Kitchen, KRI II, 167, 8, n. 8a, states [Ramesses II]). In this case, the shaving was not too deep; accordingly Sety IPs hieroglyphs cut through Merenptah 's. No trace of Amenmesse was found; but based upon other cartouches on the wall, it seems likely that he had usurped it from Merenptah. The last line of text visible on the block, "when he returned from the countries of vile Retenu," supplies additional evidence that this block belongs to Merenptah' s reliefs. Fig. 19.

Loose block, possibly from Scene 4 of these battle reliefs. Notes: The cartouches on this block (106 cm x 92 cm x 68 cm show very clearly the usurpation from Meren- ptah. Both cartouches are shaved back and scored for plastering. Traces of Merenptah's names appear to cut through Sety IFs hieroglyphs in some spots. In fact, again, as in other scenes on the wall, Sety IFs signs have great variation in depth, in some spots deeper than Merenptah's, in others, shallower. This, as shown above, is typical of carving in a plaster- filled surface. No trace of Amenmesse's name was found on this block, but it may be surmised that he intervened.

Loose block, showing a prince, and the text of the crown prince, Sety; almost certainly from the top of Scene 4. See Le Saout, Cahiers de Karnak VII (1978-81) 232, 4c; and pl. IX, 4c (adjoining blocks). Notes: The block, 152 cm X 83 cm X 62 cm, comes from the top of a scene. The column width, 19.5 cm, matches other column widths in Merenptah's reliefs. It shows no trace of earlier, erased material, but in the first column of text, reading r-pH Sthy, the name Sthy has been subject to mutilation. The disposition of the texts on this block indicates that another prince and chariot (actually the Sety referred to in the text) was shown on the next block to the left, and the prince shown on this block had his name on the next block to the right, behind his figure. The only scene where these princes can be fitted is Scene 4, where pharaoh and his chariot are positioned in the middle of the scene; and there is enough space behind him where the princes may be fitted. This Sety, therefore, is Sety-merenptah, the crown prince of Merenptah; and the erasure of his name most likely is the work of Amenmesse. Merenptah's son, is simply attested as Sety (Kitchen, KRI IV, 82, no. 48.B).14 V In the Karnak reliefs of Merenptah, Scenes 2 and 3 present other interesting and important evidence. Careful inspection of these two scenes, with unnamed fortresses, revealed that they are carved entirely over earlier, erased reliefs (see figs. 4 and 3).15 The erasure was not very thor- ough, and many traces of the earlier material survive. Based upon the disappearance of por- tions of Merenptah's scenes and texts carved over these traces, plaster had been used to cover the remaining traces. The traces of the earlier version show a concentration of horses (moving left) and of water at the bottom of Scene 2. They are sufficient to show that Ramesses II's Battle of Kadesh was depicted here. This explains why Ramesses II's name occurred in the band of text below the cornice- he carved the earlier version of the reliefs under Merenptah's Scenes 2 and 3. The recutting of these scenes raises another prob- lem, namely the identity of the Prince Khaem- waset depicted in the right side of Scene 2 (see 14 For r-pct, "crown prince," see William J. Murnane, Ancient Egyptian Coregencies, Studies in Ancient Orien- tal Civilizations, no. 40 (Chicago, 1977), 58, n. 105. This is a hitherto unrecognized representation of Prince Sety- merenptah, and should be added to Kitchen, KRI IV, 82, and also to the list of M. E. Krauss, "Seti- Merenptah als Kronprinz Merenptahs*," Gottinger Miszellen 50 (1981), 15- 21; to her list should be added also the Prince Sety on a statuette in Cairo (KRI IV, 82, 10-12). 15 See also Wreszinski, Atlas II, pl. 57.</page><page sequence="18">206 JARCE XXIII (1986) fig. 23). Is he the well-known son of Ramesses II, as many scholars have implied,16 his figure, per- haps, being left over from the erased Battle of Kadesh?17 A careful examination of the Prince Khaemwaset depicted in Scene 2, as well as of his role, answers both questions. The prince appears (see fig. 3) holding Merenptah' s chariot team, while the king himself, dismounted, stands atop two enemies and grasps the hair of a defender whom he prepares to smite with a sword.18 Over the backs of the horses that Khaemwaset holds runs the following text: "first great chariot span of his majesty, beloved of Amun, of the stable of Ba-en-Re mery-Amun (Merenptah)"; the car- touche has been recut, as shown above (p. 197). Ramesses IFs name never was carved here. Thus Khaemwaset is a son of Merenptah and not the well-known son of Ramesses II. Additionally, this newly identified prince, Khaemwaset II, is a military personage in this scene, whereas Ramesses II's son, Khaemwaset, was high priest of Ptah and not a military officer.19 It is not un- usual to find Merenptah naming a son Khaem- waset. As shown by another study,20 Merenptah' s chief queen, Isis-nofret II, was a daughter of the high priest of Ptah, Khaemwaset I, and a grand- daughter of Ramesses II. What could be more natural than Merenptah and his wife Isis-nofret II naming one of their children after his maternal grandfather? The identification of Scenes 2 and 3 with Gezer and Yanocam suggested above (p. 197) is based primarily on the assumption that the places Fig. 23. Scene 2, detail; Prince Khaemwaset II. named on the Israel and Karnak stelae were arranged geographically. Indeed, if Ashkelon, Gezer, and Yanocam are identified on a map, they do lie in a south to north progression, from the coastal plain, into the hill country (for dis- cussion on the location of Yanocam, see below).21 If the Merenptah reliefs are accepted as repre- senting the same campaign that is mentioned retrospectively in the Israel and Karnak stelae, then the wall's narrative sequence leads to the same conclusion, for the first battle scene repre- sents the capture of Ashkelon.22 By the standard 16 For example, Kitchen, JEA 50 (1964), 68, n. 9, and implicitly all those who assign Merenptah' s reliefs to Ramesses II; see n. 9 above. 17 Stager, Eretz Israel 18 (1985), 63, n. 10. 18 See Ricke, Hughes, and Wente, The Beit el-Wali Temple of Ramesses II, pl. 12 for a similar scene. 19 Eugene Cruz-Uribe, "On the Wife of Merenptah," GM 24 (1977), 25 and n. 26 (deleting the reference to Khaemwaset from Wreszinski, Atlas II, pl. 57a, a reference to Merenptah's son Khaemwaset II, as shown above). Further, as Farouk Gomaa, Chaemwese Sohn Ramses' II und Hoherpriester von Memphis, Agyptologische Abhandlungen 27 (Wiesbaden, 1973), 20, observes, the representations of Khaemwaset in early military scenes of his father do not signify that he had a military career, as he was then too young to have performed military duty. 20 Cruz-Uribe, GM 24 (1977), 24-25; see too Gomaa, Chaemwese, 12-13, and 85 (Katalog no. 56). 21 See, e.g., Yohanan Aharoni and Michael Avi-Yonah, The MacMillan Bible Atlas, rev. ed.

Loose block, triumphal scene (Scene 10) Merenptah. of New Kingdom narrative sequence, Scene 2 would come to the left of Ashkelon (left of the Peace Treaty) and be Gezer on the stelae; Scene 4, upper register, right of the Peace Treaty, would be Israel on the stela.23 The remaining scenes of Merenptah' s battle reliefs include, in the lower register, a scene of binding of prisoners (Scene 5, fig. 6). These are Shasu, in contrast to the foe in the four battle scenes, who all are Canaanites, judging by their dress. Above this scene the upper register (Scene 6, fig. 7) shows the king collecting Canaanite prisoners prior to the return to Egypt. In the succeeding scenes to the right (Scenes 7 and 8), the first (fig. 8) shows a line of Shasu prisoners being marched off to Egypt before and under pharaoh's chariot. A vertical line of text referring to the "rebels who had fallen to trespassing his boundary," separates this last group from the next scene, Scene 8 (fig. 9), another procession of Shasu, identified by a horizontal line of text above them stating: "consisting of the Shasu whom his majesty plundered." Above this text just enough of the block remains preserved to show a file of Canaanites, readily distinguished from the Shasu by their long cloaks. Both of these files are part of the lower scene depicting the presentation of the spoils of the campaign to the Theban deities. Above and to the right the wall is demolished, but scattered blocks lying in the field to the West have been reconstructed in a recent study24 into a large-scale prisoner smiting scene (Scene 10, fig. 24a); and also possibly a fragment of Scene 9, showing the king receiv- ing the sword and setting off on the march. Again, some blocks among these show cartouches usurped from Merenptah by Amenmesse and Sety II. VI Returning to the battle scenes, the Ashkelon scene (Scene 1) has, besides the rhetorical text referring to pharaoh, a text referring to the townsfolk of Ashkelon (fig. 5):25 gathering scenes only). Standard New Kingdom narrative sequence is from the bottom upward. Le Saout's restoration of Scene 9, Cahiers de Karnak VII (1978-81), 252, pl. 4b, is an anomaly, as Scene 6 to its immediate left and Scenes 5, 7, and 8 below are all moving to the right and are parts of the return to Egypt sequence. 23 See Gaballa, Narrative in Egyptian Art, 100, and Kitchen, JEA 50 (1964), 48, n. 1. Kitchen, ibid., 68, n. 9, but for Prince Khaemwaset in Scene 2, would have equated the Ashkelon scene with the Israel stela, thus placing the start of the campaign in Scene 1. Merenptah' s reliefs move upward to the second register after Scene 2 because of the join of the wall to that of the Hypostyle Hall, occupied by other scenes. 24 Le Saout, Cahiers de Karnak VII (1978-81), 252, pl. IV, 4a-b, and 257, pl. XI, 4c. Contrary to Le Saout's n. 98 on 229 (and n. 18 on 215), the king's face on the loose block from the Canaanite War triumph (fig. 24a) cannot be compared to Merenptah from the Libyan War triumph (inside the Cour de la Cachette; see K. A. Kitchen and G. A. Gaballa, "Ramesside Varia II," ZAS 96 [1969], Tafel VIII); for a block line runs right through Merenptah' s face in the Libyan War triumph. Nor does the king on the loose block resemble the best known portraits of Ramesses II which show a strongly aquiline nose (confirmed by his mummy); see Karol Mysliwiec, Le Portrait Royal dans Bas-Reliefs du Nouvel Empire (Warsaw, 1976), figs. 227, 228, 230, 239, 244, 250, 254, 255, and 256. Rather, the king on the loose block resembles most closely the best known portraits of Merenptah, from his tomb (figs. 24b-c). Further, as Le Saout (p. 229) states, the Horus name on the block adjoining the loose block with the king shows only Sety II usurping from Merenptah, and no trace of Ramesses II (confirmed by my own research on the loose blocks). 25 KRI II, 166, 2-3; checked epigraphically by Dr. William J. Murnane and myself in 1977; verified by Murnane in 1986.</page><page sequence="20">208 JARCE XXIII (1986) Fig. 24b. Merenptah, from entrance scene from his tomb in the Valley of the Kings.

This text is rather unusual, although not un- paralleled among Ramesside battle reliefs.29 Additionally, two children are lowered from the ramparts of Ashkelon, one possibly dead (over the front wall), but the other one alive (over the back wall). Also of interest, below the spectacular falling Ganaanite who in part accounts for many photographic reproductions of this scene, is an enemy chariot (see fig. 2, bottom center). That it is Canaanite is indicated by the stumbling of the horses and the posture of the charioteer, who falls over forward as he looks back at pharaoh. This Canaanite chariot has wheels with only four spokes and a single rim, while all other chariots in these reliefs, Egyptian and Canaanite (in Scene 4), have six-spoke wheels with double rims. As three other Ramesside depictions of enemy chariots with four-spoke wheels are attested, a technical reason may account for their survival in use,30 rather than simple anachronism. In actual surviving models of chariots, those with wheels having six spokes also have a leather "tire" around the rim (the outer rim in the reliefs); they are also heavier overall in structure.31 By contrast, chariots with wheels having four spokes are light in structure, sometimes con- sisting of only a floor and a frame.32 The lighter chariots, accordingly, may have remained in use 26 im,D, "woe," see Leonard H.

This refutes Yigael Yadin, The Art of Warfare in Biblical Lands I (New York, Toronto, and London, 1963), 212-13, who claims that the six-spoked chariot can be used as a criterion for dating an Egyptian relief after 1400 B.C.

In Meren- ptah's reliefs the distinction is clear between the light chariot with wheels of four spokes and no leather "tire" around the rim, and the heavier chariots, both Egyptian and Canaanite, with wheels having six spokes and doubled rims, indicating the leather "tire." Merenptah's reliefs have several close parallels to the battle reliefs of Sety I found on the northern exterior wall of the Hypostyle Hall. The long rhetorical text to the right of the prisoner binding scene (Scene 5) is a duplicate of one carved in Sety I's scene of victory over the Shasu.33 Likewise, the scene of Merenptah bund- ling captives in his arms (Scene 6, above the prisoner-binding scene) has a parallel in Sety I's relief.34 These two scenes, however, are to a certain extent stereotyped. By contrast, the battle scenes are not copied from Sety I's material. Sety I never campaigned against Ashkelon, as far as is known, and neither did Ramesses II. Accordingly, Merenptah's reliefs, while drawing themes from Sety I's material, do show historical events of his reign. The retrospective references in the "Israel" stela (and Karnak duplicate), and also at Amada, all referring to the battles depicted in Meren- ptah's reliefs, lend support to the authentic his- toricity of the events shown. Further, preserved as they are in the context of the much more impres- sive victory over the Libyans, they show that the Palestinian campaign, though overshadowed, certainly was not forgotten. There are Shasu depicted in the prisoner- binding scene (Scene 5, fig. 6), and in Scenes 7 and 8 showing the return of the king and pris- oners to Egypt and the presentation of prisoners to Amun (figs. 8-9). In Merenptah's reign Shasu were found in southern Canaan and Sinai, as shown by P. Anastasi VI, 53-61. 35 This record, kept by frontier officials, shows a peaceful migra- tion of Shasu shepherds for the purpose of water- ing their flocks. They are described as Edomites. Fig. 24c. Profile of Merenptah's visage on the sar- cophagus lid in his tomb in the Valley of the Kings. But Shasu were found all over Canaan;36 and no doubt some of them who harried Merenptah's forces enroute to subdue the Canaanite cities and Israel, were captured and incorporated into the victory procession returning to Egypt. Yet one 33 KRI II, 166, 6-9; KRl, I, 7, 10-13; see now, The Epi- graphic Survey, The Battle Reliefs of King Sety I (Chicago, 1986), pl. 4, lines 1-7. 34 rig. 7 above, and Epigraphic Survey, The Battle Reliefs of King Sety /, pl. 13, for the parallel scene. 35 Caminos, LEM, 293. 36 In P.

See, e.g., Wreszinski, Atlas II, pl. 83-84 for Shasu among allies of the Hittites at the Battle of Kadesh.</page><page sequence="22">210 JARCE XXIII (1986) thing is clear, the Israelites (Scene 4) were not depicted as Shasu, but as Canaanites.31 Further, the scene of the presentation of prisoners to Amun, Scene 8, shows both Canaanites, in the upper file, identifiable by their long cloaks, and Shasu, in the lower file, identified by name and depiction (fig. 9). The Shasu in these wall reliefs raise the ques- tion of just where the contact with them occurred and also may shed light on the strategy employed in Merenptah's campaign. Although now in his 50s or 60s, at the time of the campaign, Meren- ptah had been trained as a military officer and had served as a general for some time prior to becoming pharaoh.38 So it is not surprising to see his campaign following, to an extent, the line of march of Sety I's campaigns, particularly the Shasu and Yanocam campaigns, designed to reassert Egyptian authority in Canaan.39 As far as Yanocam, the campaign's progress reflects earlier Ramesside wars, but then came a new turn - Merenptah encountered the Israelites. The loca- tion of Yanocam is the subject of much dispute, but it is most likely either at a site somewhere near the southern shore of the Sea of Galilee,40 or some 24 miles (39 kilometers) eastward, on the Yarmuk River, at Tell esh-Shihab.41 The attack on the Israelites came next; but in what direction did Merenptah proceed from Yanocam? Was it northeastward, as Aharoni and Avi-Yonah pro- posed?42 The earliest and densest archaeological traces of Israelite settlement, perhaps dating back to late in Ramesses IFs reign, lie in the northern highlands, in the central highlands, south of the Galilee region, and eastward across the Jordan River.43 So it is much more likely that Merenptah turned south after taking Yanocam and struck at the largest concentration of Israelites, and those who most likely would have endangered Gezer and Ashkelon. If this suggestion is correct, per- haps he employed a pincer movement, possibly linking up with crown prince Sety-merenptah, himself a general,44 after the prince had dealt with the Shasu in southern Canaan, to confront this more dispersed and substantial foe.45 There is some indirect evidence to support such an interpretation of Merenptah's strategy. First, in the Karnak reliefs Merenptah is not depicted battling the Shasu, but rather binding them (Scene 5, fig. 6), and further, leading Shasu prisoners back to Egypt (Scenes 7-8, figs. 8-9). Accordingly, he may not have personally defeated the Shasu, yet there was some sort of an opera- tion against them. Second, if I am correct in posi- 37 Stager, Eretz Israel 18 (1985), 60. This set of reliefs makes the distinction emphatically: Shasu are pictorially and text- ually Shasu; the Israelites in Scene 4 are Canaanites pictori- ally, and by inference textually in the Israel stela where Israel is linked with Ashkelon, Gezer, and Yanocam. This contra- dicts the positions taken in several recent studies, that the Israelites emerged out of a Shasu milieu; e.g., Raphael Giveon, Les Bedouins Shosou des documents Egyptiens, Documenta et Monumenta Orientis Antiqui 18 (Leiden, 1971), 267-71; Manfred Weippert, "Canaan, Conquest and Settlement of," in Interpreters Dictionary of the Bible, Supple- ment (Nashville, 1976), 129; also idem, "The Israelite 'Con- quest' and the Evidence from Transjordan," 32-34. 38 Louis A.

There, another son, Khaemwaset II, figures prominently. Where could prince Sety have been? Very probably he was leading a detachment of the army to deal with the Shasu, and later reappeared, perhaps taking the King's Highway in the Transjordan, to join in the attack on the Israelites. If Yanocam is to be located at Tell esh-Shihab, they may have swept jointly westward across the Jordan River Valley. If it is at el-cAbeidiyeh, then perhaps they linked up via the Jordan River valley route, and then swept westward into the central highlands. The phrase on the stela, "Israel is laid waste, and his seed (progeny) is not," may reflect the thorough- ness of the operation.46 As suggested earlier, the use of the masculine pronoun • / to refer back to the collective noun Israel may indicate keen observation by the Egyptian annalist, denoting an awareness that Israel traced its origins to an eponymous ancestor.47 VII Besides the great importance of these reliefs for the history of Israel, there also are other major ramifications for Egyptian history. First, no longer need one postulate a campaign against Ashkelon by Ramesses II sometime after his near debacle at Kadesh. This makes Ramesses' stra- tegic losses after Kadesh less serious than has hitherto been suggested. Second, Merenptah's campaign into Palestine is placed on firm his- torical grounds. Third, the reliefs provide striking confirmation of emerging archaeological findings about ancient Israel, that earliest Israelite settle- ments were in open, dispersed villages with no substantial fortresses. Another reference from Egyptian sources, P. Anastasi III, verso 6,4 to 6,6,48 may be joined with a pair of Biblical references, Joshua 15:9 and 18:15, to provide additional support for the appearance of Israel in Merenptah's time. First, the passage from P. Anastasi: Regnal-year 3, first month of Shomu, day 17. Arrival effected by the captains of troops of the Wells of Meneptah-hotphimace (l.p.h.) which are in the hills, in order to investigate (matters) in the fortress which is at Tjel. Next Joshua 15:9: And the border (of Judah) was drawn from the top of the hill unto the fountain of the water of Neph-toDah, and went out to the cities of Mount Ephron; Last, Joshua 18:15: and the south quarter (of the border of Ben- jamin) was from the end of Kirjath-jearim, and the border went out on the West, and went out to the well of waters of Neph-toDah: It was proposed long ago by F. von Calice49 that "well of waters/fountain of the water" was redundant in Hebrew, and was a garbled 46 Priebatsch {ZDPV 91 [1975] 29), while accepting the historicity of the Israel stela reference, dismissed its military significance as "a local action." However, in light of the representation of the places on the stela in the battle reliefs, and the widespread settlement of Israelites, as shown by Stager's paper, BASOR 230 (1985), 1-35, this seems a serious underevaluation. 47 See n. 3 above. 48 Caminos, LEM, 108; ANET, 258b, with n. 6. 49 Orientalische Liter atur-Zeitung (May 1903), 224; sup- ported by Walter Wolf, "Beitrage zum 'Tagebuch eines Grenzbeamten,' " ZAS 69 (1933), 42 (no. 8); Caminos, LEM, 1 1 1 (note verso 6,4 of P.

Doubts about the etymological possibility of the Egyptian to Hebrew have been expressed, principally by Werner Vycichl, "Agyptiche Ortsnamen in der Bibel," ZAS 76 (1940), 88-89, and fol- lowing him, Krauss in LA IV, 74, s.v. "Merenptah," espe- cially n. 13. But when it is considered that substantial time may have elapsed between when the placename initially passed into Hebrew speech (in the reign of Merenptah) and the time when it finally was written down (date of composi- tion of Joshua) in a garbled form, the etymological problems simply may be a factor of garbling in oral transmission combined with the loss of memory of Merenptah by the later Israelites. As for the Septuagint's variant form, NecpOaAAen, if the name was already strange to and misunderstood by the compositor of the Book of Joshua, is it surprising that the Greek-speaking compositors of the Septuagint may have further garbled it? Similar garbling occurs in Manetho's rendering of Egyptian royal names, and that from written sources.</page><page sequence="24">212 JARCE XXIII (1986) reading of "well/fountain of Merenptah." This interpretation not only eliminates the redun- dancy of the Hebrew, but also draws out the parallel to the passage from P. Anastasi III. It was standard practice in the Ramesside period to name prominent places where Egyptian garri- sons were posted for the then current pharaoh. P. Anastasi III names that pharaoh as Merenptah, and in the emended text of Joshua, the well of Merenptah could represent one such place with an Egyptian garrison. Whether or not these two places, in P. Anastasi III and in Joshua are one and the same,50 the importance of von Calice's reading is that the placename passed into Hebrew while Merenptah (1212-1202 B.C.) was ruling Egypt; ultimately at some later date the place- name was transmitted into the boundary texts of Joshua, albeit in a garbled form, suggesting that Israelite memory of Merenptah had been lost when the text finally was put into writing. If this interpretation is accurate, it provides striking literary confirmation from the Bible for the archaeological evidence of Israelite penetration and settlement in the highland areas. This pene- tration doubtless stirred up trouble among the Canaanite city states, and the situation may have provoked Merenptah' s campaign. The small chariot with wheels having six spokes shown in Scene 4 (fig. 5), among Israelite forces in Meren- ptah's reliefs, is in the hands of the foe. This implies that either an alliance had been formed between Israel and the Canaanite city states,51 or that the Israelites had captured some chariots in earlier raids on the Canaanites. The presence of the chariot and its implications, as well as the fact that Merenptah considered the operation against the Israelites important enough to merit a battle scene, suggests that the Israelites at this juncture were rather prosperous. Although the Bible fails to indicate when such a campaign may have struck, the general decline of Israel's prosperity signaled by the opening sections of Judges suggests a possible result of such an operation.52 VIII The position of the reliefs of Merenptah on the temple walls relative to his great Libyan victory text and also their position relative to Ramesses H's material shed some light on the campaign's dating. The retrospective references in the Israel, Karnak, and Amada stelae, denote a date prior to year 5. The position of Merenptah's battle reliefs on the walls of the temple corroborates this dating. To record his Canaanite campaign, Merenptah found blank wall space south of the Hittite Peace Treaty of Rameses II and north of the Vllth Pylon, on the exterior wall of the Cour de la Cachette. This is clearly demonstrated by the fact that the scenes showing Ashkelon and Israel, the binding and gathering of prisoners scenes, and the triumphal return to Egypt, pre- sentation of prisoners, and great triumph scenes, were all carved onto a previously unused expanse of wall. There is absolutely no trace of erasure of earlier scenes on any of these scenes (other than the usurped cartouches). By contrast, the pro- posed Gezer and Yanocam scenes (2-3) show extensive traces of earlier erased scenes - so clear, that they may be seen even on a photograph (figs. 3-4). A massive array of horses and a band of water indicate a segment of Ramesses II's Battle of Kadesh by the Orontes River. Scenes 2 and 3 of Merenptah's reliefs entirely overlie the earlier material; no doubt plaster was employed to mask the deep traces that were not erased. So Merenptah had to appropriate space for these two scenes,53 but otherwise had sufficient exterior wall space. By contrast, the great victory over the Libyans in his 5th year, far more impressive a victory than the operation in Palestine, was confined to inte- 50 Helck, Die Beziehungen2, 232, 311-13; so too Wolf, ZAS 69(1933), 42, no. 8. 51 Suggested as a possibility by Dr. Lawrence E. Stager. 52 Stager has suggested a period prior to the "Song of Deborah" (Judges 5), usually dated to the 12th or 11th century B.C.; see Eretz Israel 18(1985), 61. Judges 1:18-19 may be an indication, especially if the Septuagint version of Judges 1:18 is taken as superior to the Masoretic text, i.e., that the Israelites were unable to take the valleys and towns, specifically Gaza, Ashkelon, and Ekron, because the Canaan- ites had chariots of iron. Similarly the failure of the Israelites to take Jerusalem (Judges 1:21) may signify strong Egyp- tian control of the cities and strategic points through their Canaanite vassals. 53 It is possible that Ramesses II himself suppressed this series of Kadesh reliefs when he commissioned the carving of the Hittite Peace Treaty on the wall of the transverse axis; see William J. Murnane, The Penguin Guide to Ancient Egypt (Harmondsworth, 1983), 229-30.</page><page sequence="25">MERENPTAH'S CANAANITE CAMPAIGN 213 rior wall space in the Cour de la Cachette, where no battle relief was presented, but only a long inscription and a triumphal scene.54 War scenes generally occupy exterior walls; the Pales- tinian reliefs, therefore, predate the great Libyan triumph as also suggested by the retrospective passages in the Israel and Karnak stelae, and at Amada. By how much the Canaanite campaign predated the Libyan war is more difficult to establish, for the Canaanite reliefs have no date preserved. Year 1 probably can be excluded, for late in that year Merenptah altered his prenomen from Bj-n-Rc mry-ntrw to Bd-u-Rc mry-Imn;55 and the names on the Karnak reliefs are of the regular later version, Bd-u- Rc mry-Imn. Accord- ingly, years 2-4 may be postulated as the most likely dates for the Canaanite campaign.56 P. Anastasi III, verso 6,1 to 5,9, the frontier journal, shows considerable Egyptian activity between Gaza and the uplands of Canaan. It does not help date the campaign, however, unless the sugges- tion is accepted that the "Wells of Merenptah which are in the hills" is the group of springs at Lifta, near Jerusalem, and were so named by Merenptah after his victory over the Israelites, whom he compelled to evacuate Jerusalem itself.57 This suggestion would make it necessary to date the campaign to before year 3, I Shomu 17, the date on which the troop-commanders from the 54 KRI IV, 2-12; triumphal scene, K. A. Kitchen and G. A. Gaballa, "Ramesside Varia II," ZAS 96 (1969), 23, 25, and 27, and Tafel VIII; also KRI IV, 23-24. A similar situation recurs under Ramesses III at Medinet Habu where exterior wall space for the Libyan war of year 1 1 was exhausted, and the remainder was placed in a long inscription on the inner face of the southern tower of the first pylon. 55 The earliest known dated examples of Bi-n-Rc mry-Imn are a Theban graffito, year 1, II Akhet 2 (KRI IV, 180, 1 1) and a Gebel Silsilah dated text, year 1, II Akhet 5 (KRI I, 83-84, and line 15 on 84). Both of these dates are around the end of regnal year 1, assuming that Merenptah ascended the throne sometime after II Akhet 5, but before II Akhet 13, a distinct possibility. P. Gurob, fragment L, narrows the possible accession date to the range of I Akhet 19 to II Akhet 19 (A. H. Gardiner, Ramesside Administrative Documents [Oxford, 1948] 30, lines 10 and 14); it is narrowed further to the range of I Akhet 19 to II Akhet 13 by Ostracon no. 25504, marking the change from regnal year 7 to 8 by II Akhet 13 (Wolfgang Helck, "Bemerkungen zu den Thronbesteigungsdaten im Neuen Reich," Studia Biblica et Orientalia III: Oriens Antiquus [Rome, 1959], 120-21). Most recently, the range has been narrowed further to between I Akhet 29 and II Akhet 13, by the marginal texts recording a great inspection of temples late in year 2 at Deir el-Medinah, and early in year 3 at Deir el-Bahri by one official, Ioti (KRI IV, 26, 9A, B, and 10); also Kenneth A. Kitchen, "A Note on Bandeau Texts in New Kingdom Temples," Studien zu Sprache und Religion Agyptens zu Ehren von Wolf hart Westendorf, ed. Friedrich Junge, I (Gottingen, 1984) 549-50 with n. 23. Bl-n-RQ mry- ntrw in dated contexts only shows year one (KRI IV, 102, line 13 [Louvre Stela E. 3629]) and a Cairo stela (KRI IV, 103, line 4), and enough undated examples of Bi-n-Rc myr-ntrw survive on a variety of monuments to suggest that it was in use by Merenptah for about a year. Besides the dated exam- ples cited above, see KRI IV, 31-32, no. 13; 45, nos. 5, 6, and 7; 47, no. 3; 48, no. 6; 52, no. 25; 56, no. 26B; 58-59, no. 28A (the two prenomens interchanging); 104, no. 68, 1; 121, no. 71,1. Simple B3-n-RQ occurs in three dated texts: year 1, III Akhet 3 and year 2, II (?), Akhet 3 (KRI IV, 150-51, no. 92 A.I, A.2); and year 4, I Shomu 27 (A. F. Sadek, Graffiti de la Montagne Thebaine IV [Cairo, 1972] 3, 154, no. 3012). In the year 2, II (?) Akhet 3 text, the month probably should be read III Akhet, as the text deals with the inundation of the Nile, and two other examples (KRI IV, 150, no. 92 A.I and KRI IV, 154, no. 92 A. 10 [dated year 7, III Akhet 5]) also inundation texts, set the date in III Akhet, days 3 and 5 respectively. So, Bj-n-Rc mry-ntrw seems restricted to year 1 while simple Bj-n-Rc sporadically recurs in graffiti until year 4. A similar situation is attested for Ramesses II's prenomen; see William J. Murnane, Ancient Egyptian Coregencies, SAOC 40 (Chicago, 1977), 63. 56 Also suggested by Kitchen, Pharaoh Triumphant, 215; proposed by me in 1977, during my lecture in Toronto when the evidence in this paper was first presented. 57 Proposed by Manfred Weippert, "Fragen des Israelit- ischen Geschichtsbewusstseins," Vetus Testamentum 23 (1973), 423; see too Priebatsch, ZDPV 91 (1975), 22-24, with n. 15. Certainly this is a possibility, but it cannot be proven. The wells would hold the name of the currently ruling pharaoh from his accession, or from the date of conquest of the area. It seems more likely that the place-name would have passed into Hebrew intact if it were associated with a peaceful migration of Israelites into the area, rather than if associated with an Egyptian expulsion of the Israelites by Merenptah. As much of the material in Judges is older than Joshua and the introduction to Judges (see, e.g., T. W. Manson, ed., A Companion to the Bible [New York, 1939], 44-46), the early conquest of Jerusalem by Israelites (Joshua 10 and Judges 1:8) in the 13th century B.C. seems unhistorical, or, a later event that was backdated. Note that Judges 1:21 specifically denies the conquest of Jerusalem. Another example of such contradiction is Jabin, King of Hazor. In Joshua 11 he is slain, yet in Judges 4-5 it is only his general Sisera who is killed, while Jabin evidently survives. Judges 4-5, the "Song of Deborah," is generally accepted as one of the earliest accounts, perhaps contemporary to the events (probably post-Ramesses VI). So it seems highly unlikely that the Wells of Merenptah were so named as the result of a campaign of conquest, but rather were named at the change of reign from Ramesses II to Merenptah.</page><page sequence="26">214 JARCE XXIII (1986) Wells of Merenptah arrived in Tjel on their investigation; but it is not a certainty.58 Artifacts naming Merenptah and his successors of the XlXth Dynasty have been found in a number of sites in Canaan, suggesting that Merenptah' s campaign had the desired result of maintaining Egypt's hold on the region. Gezer59 and possibly Lachish60 have yielded objects with Merenptah's name. Sety IFs name occurs on fragments of objects found at Tell el-Fara (South),61 at Tell Beit Mirsim,62 and possibly on a scarab from Tell Masos.63 Siptah and Tawosret are attested at Acco,64 Beth Shemesh,65 and Tell Deir cAlla.66 IX All this evidence suggests that Merenptah's Palestinian campaign had the net effect of main- taining Egypt's secure hold on Canaan through the reign of Ramesses III, when Egypt's control was tightened.67 Tax collection was instituted and substantial administrative centers were built at a number of locations, and these persisted into 58 Priebatsch, ZDPV 91 (1975), 22-24, 29. I cannot agree, however, that Merenptah's campaign was only a local opera- tion. Rather, based on the reliefs of Merenptah, the language of Merenptah's stela, and the situation of Israel in the Book of Judges, it certainly was more than the "local action," Priebatsch would make of it. See, too, Merenptah's epithet w c/ Kjdjr, "Subduer of Gezer," incorporated into his titulary (KRI IV, 1, 9 [line 2]). Further, to gauge by the low, sober numbers of enemy casualties in Merenptah's year 5 Libyan- Sea Peoples campaign text, this pharaoh was not given to exaggeration in his historical inscriptions. 59 Sundial, ivory; see KRI IV, 24, no. 7B; also R.

This is a view that my own research supports, based on the continuity of the careers of certain high officials without interruption from the late XlXth Dynasty to the early XXth Dynasty. See also Hartwig Altenmiiller, "Tausret und Sethnacht," JEA 68 (1982), 107-115, who advocates a civil war between the two rulers ranging over Tawosret' s two years as independent ruler, and ending in Setnakht's year 2, II Shomu 10, a situation that precludes an interregnum. For a different view, advocating a short interregnum of less than one year, see</page><page sequence="27">MERENPTAH'S CANAANITE CAMPAIGN 215 the reign of Ramesses VI at some sites.68 Another aspect of Merenptah's campaign concerns the advent of the Sea Peoples in Canaan. The asso- ciation of Late Helladic III B pottery in an archaeological context securely dated to Tawosret and Sety II69 (whose reigns are now dated 1193- 1 185 B.C. and 1 199-1 193 b.c. respectively)70 makes certain one other point: there was no mass set- tlement of Sea Peoples in Canaan under Meren- ptah, or for that matter, during the rest of the XlXth Dynasty. This, of course, excludes small parties of Sea Peoples, such as the Sherden, who after attacking Egypt and being captured, were impressed into the Egyptian army.71 Some con- tingents of these serving in Egyptian armies may have been posted in Canaan, and thereby account for some of the so-called "Philistine" clay coffins found in archaeological contexts earlier than Ramesses III.72 It is also possible that raids, such as those Ramesses II repelled in the Delta early in his reign,73 may also have struck Canaanite coastal towns, wreaking some of the destruction datable to earlier than the end of the LH III B period. The large group of Sea Peoples who attacked Merenptah in year 5, after having armed the Libyans and allied themselves to them, came from the West.u The large migrating group, including Philistines, that marched down the Syro-Palestinian coast and eventually settled along the Canaanite coast came only in year 8 of Ramesses III.75 From the evidence of the Karnak reliefs, the two stelae, the Amada inscription, and the great Karnak inscription of year 5 recording victory over Libyans and Sea Peoples, Merenptah emerges as a very successful pharaoh. He not only met the challenges to Egyptian rule in Canaan and Nubia, but he literally saved Egypt from a thrust by the Libyans and Sea Peoples aimed at Memphis itself, and dealt these groups so stunning a blow that for at least one genera- tion Egypt's realms were safeguarded. Further, he maintained Ramesses IFs Peace Treaty with the Hittites and even shipped them grain and arms, as they faced famine and the first major onslaught of Sea Peoples emerging from the Aegean Sea. Finally he has provided us with the first extra-Biblical mention of and glimpse at ancient Israel, a view that closely agrees with emerging archaeological findings. University of Chicago Edward F.

See too P. Anastasi I (Wilson in ANET, 476b; and Caminos, LEM, 64). Further, for the date of Philistine settlement in Canaan see the discussion of Aharoni, The Archaeology of the Land of the Bible, rev and enl. ed., 180-85, especially 184, who would date Philistine settlement in Canaan even later, some years after the defeat by Ramesses III, in his year 8. Idem, The Land of the Bible, rev. and enl. ed., 267-75, particularly 268-69. Oren's paper, JSSEA XIV, no. 2 (March 1984), 37-56, supports this position; but Egyptian control seems to have disappeared rapidly after Ramesses VI, and this partly explains why Egypt is not mentioned in the Book of Judges as overlord of Canaan, and instead the Canaanite rulers are described as acting independently. Merenptah likewise may have impressed Sea Peoples captured in his war of year 5, and probably even Shasu from the Canaanite campaign, some of whom later appear in Ramesses Ill's army; see The Epigraphic Survey, Medinet Habu I: Earlier Historical Records of Ramesses III (Chicago, 1930), pls. 17- 18 (lower left, the First Libyan War, year 5); pls. 30-31 (lower left, the Sea Peoples War, year 8, in Djahy). In all these scenes, the Shasu serve as infantry. That they already are active in the First Libyan War further supports the idea that these are troops incorporated into the Egyptian army by Merenptah after his Canaanite campaign. 72 Oren, JSSEA XIV, no. 2 (March 1984), 52-53. The designation ''Philistine" for these clay coffins should be dropped unless they can be shown to have come from Philistine strata, or show some strong Philistine evidence in iconography or contents. Clay coffins were regularly used by Egyptians throughout Egyptian history, as shown by Liza Kuchman, "Egyptian Clay Anthropoid Coffins," Serapis 4 (1977-78), 11-22, with figs. 1-4. It is thus likely that many Egyptians posted in Canaan also used clay coffins. 73 Kitchen, Pharaoh Triumphant, 40-41. 74 KRI IV, 2-12; idem, Pharaoh Triumphant, 215. 75 Kitchen, "The Philistines," 57-60.
