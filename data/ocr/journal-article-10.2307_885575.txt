<plain_text><page sequence="1">Exhibition Reviews London, Sladmore Gallery Rembrandt Bugatti Much work remains to be done before the sculptures of Rembrandt Bugatti (1885- 1916) become widely recognised as not merely collectable objets, but the works of a sophisticated, sensitive artist. How he is perceived in academic and curatorial circles is inevitably affected by the paucity of serious literature on him, and it is to be hoped that the catalogue raisonne byJ.-C. &amp; V. Des Cordes, when it achieves a new edition next year, will be of appropriately sober and scholarly form. Meanwhile the present exhibition of twenty sculptures at the Sladmore Gal- lery (to 16thJuly), offers something more than a selection for collectors. It includes rare pieces such as a 1903 pair of camels, one of which has not been previously known, and a ten-inch high Crouching jaguar of 1908 (no.11; Fig.42), originally bought from the founder H(ebrard by Tiffany's New York. The piece is usually known in a version of half the size. Also unusual is the inclusion of two figure pieces, Nude athlete reclining (1907; no.8) and Le reveil (1907; no.9, Fig.43), which in their way are extemely revealing. Although from the very beginning of his career Bugatti had sculpted figures - Rodinesque nudes, Dalou- like peasants, flamboyant society portraits a la Troubetskoy - he was so entirely as- sociated with animal pieces by 1907, when he exhibited Nude athlete and Le reveil, that Le Figaro called them 'first manifestations' that he was 'adding to' his usual animal studies. While they were favourably re- ceived, the adjectives chosen by Figaro's reviewer - 'charming', 'simply alluring' - contrast tellingly with those used of his animals: 'powerful', 'astringent', 'supple'. While his animal sculptures are supremely concerned with the formal properties of rhythm, counterpoint and balance, his fig- ure pieces aim for grace and elegance, and these virtues tend to reside in the subjects (athlete, beautiful woman) rather than specifically in the artist's handling. And while Bugatti fixes his animals in specific, spontaneously expressive, idiosyn- cratic attitudes, his human figures adopt conventional life-room poses, the nudes often sporting a slightly period hairstyle or waxed moustache redolent of their epoch, which would seem more fitting in a fully costumed portrait. It is a pity the present show does not include any of the clothed portraits, which share more fully the qual- ities of the animal pieces, being caught in typical, everyday aspects. The acute characterisation in Bugatti's animals often lies, too, in his suggestion of skeleton and muscle moving under heavy fur, manes, loose flesh, feathers. Bugatti uses this kind of animal 'clothing', sometimes amounting to ostentatious display, both for its potential for simplification and formalisation, and 42.

Inevitably the closest equivalents to this in the figure sculptures are afforded by clothing. While never tritely anthropomorphic, Bugatti's animal works also have a signifi- cance beyond mere anatomical recording. There is undeniably a kind of psychology at work in them, a meditative, reflective inwardness. In the catalogue' to this exhi- bition it is suggested that it was with an intensive period of sculpting nudes around 1906-07 that psychological content, particu- larly a certain melancholy, enters Bugatti's work. It has to be observed, however, that an inwardness or psychological dimension seems paradoxically less evident in his human beings than in his animals. Indeed, he possibly returned to animal subjects as a vehicle for such a content, having failed to manifest it in what might have seemed the more appropriate figurative mode. If his humans seem less reflective, even less spiritual beings than his animals, it is because they are also less intensely physical. It is the very physicality of the animals which brings out, as if by contrast, their more-than-physical presence; the suggestion of the ghost in the machine of the body. Admittedly, when sculptors contemporary with, or immediately preceding Bugatti, such as Rodin or Rosso, sought to express elusive, metaphysical qualities of mind, consciousness and spirit in their subjects, they tended towards disembodiment, sub- limating faces and limbs into atmospheric backgrounds, melting and distorting bodies. The softening and elongating of forms in Bugatti's figures perhaps aspire to be simi- larly expressive. It remains, however, his animals which achieve real inwardness, expressed not through disembodiment but, as it were, superembodiment. If Bugatti's Colossal nude seated (1907; reproduced in the catalogue), echoes Rodin's 1880s Thinker, it may be that he was drawn to the work as being one of the few in which Rodin allows the mental and the physical to co- exist and contrast, without attempting to transmute or transfigure the body. Even so, it is Bugatti's Hamadryas baboon (1910) or Seated leopard (1912), with their 'zen' sense of composure, that read most strongly as his answer to Rodin's Thinker. Bugatti had uncanny empathy with animals. In the case of the Crouching jaguar we are told that the animal was uncontrol- lable by its keepers, becoming placid only in the presence of the artist, when it watched fascinated, providing the pose for the re- sulting, poignant piece. Numerous photo- graphs show Bugatti playing with 'wild' animals. By comparison he seems to have found human relationships difficult, stem- ming perhaps from his experience with a distant father (the furniture designer, Carlo Bugatti), and a mother who rejected him after a difficult birth and the subsequent loss of her health. Romantic associations later in life were no less traumatic, possibly contributing (along with the First World War) to his suicide. Pieces in this exhibition which may well have had private resonance for him - L'amoureuse (1904; no.3), Zebra and Grant's gazelle (1909; no.13) and The two friends (1911; no.15), a piece which possibly also bore the title The sick mother2 - all depict pairs of animals nuzzling each other; a variation on that ubiquitous motif in late romantic and early modern sculp- ture, the kiss.

In both works, but in the present one especially, one animal seems to comfort an elder in distress. However, the sources of the more emotive titles attached to Bugatti's sculptures need to be clarified. 43. Le reveil, by Rembrandt Bugatti. 1907. Bronze, 35 cm. high. (Exh.
