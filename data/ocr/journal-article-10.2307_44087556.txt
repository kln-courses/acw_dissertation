ISLE seeks to encourage such scholarship, writing, and teaching, while facilitating the development of a theoretical foundation for these activities. It also seeks to bridge the gaps between scholars, artists, students, and the public.

One reads this book with astonishment at the wealth of thoughtful and playful and provocative work that has occurred in this medium - and astonishment too that most scholars of environmental literature and nature in the visual arts have had minimal contact with independent film and video. MacDonald provides an immensely valuable, readable overview of this field." - Scott Slovic, editor of ISLE: Interdisciplinary Studies in Literature and Environment " The Carden in the Machine reflects Scott MacDonald's career-long lived engagement with avant-garde film and filmmakers. With deep respect for the artists and a rich, wide-ranging curiosity about the cultural histories that inform these films, MacDonald makes a powerful argument for why they should be screened, taught, and discussed within the wider context of American Studies. Throughout, MacDonald analyzes themes of race, history, personal and public memory, and the central role of avant-garde films in shaping our possible futures." - Angela Miller, author of Empire of the Eye $35.00 paperback, $75.00 hardcover at bookstores or order (800) 822-6657 www.ucpress.edu UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA PRESS</page><page sequence="20">^ ' ^^3 bonelight ruin and grace in the new southwest Mary Sojourner 1 84 pages, 2002 hardcover, $2 1.95 Since 1999, Mary Sojourner's unique voice has reached a national audi- ence through her commentaries aired on National Public Radio.
