            <italic>Free Will and the Human Sciences in Britain, 1870–1910</italic>, and <italic>Between Mind and Nature</italic>, both published in 2013, illustrate a claim dear to Roger Smith: namely, that history—including history of the human sciences—is central to the human sciences. <italic>Free Will</italic> charts a wide range of conceptions of the will, power, agency, activity, the self, and character, as well as causality, necessity, determinism, and materialism. Victorian physicians, physiologists, scientific and philosophical psychologists, and philosophers, as well as (though that is not the distinctive focus of the book) novelists, politicians, and ordinary men and women combined those ideas in complex ways, at times merging together questions and concepts that we, instead, tend to separate (e.g., the question of the freedom of the will and the question of its efficacy). As Smith reminds us, the will attained unprecedented salience in a culture that made it into the “base of character” and, largely unable to theorize social agency, made character into “the pivot of personal relations and politics” (<italic>Free Will</italic>, pp. 8, 10). After analyzing arguments about automatism and free will (Ch. 2), Smith turns to intellectual debates on the nature of volition, mental activity, and causality. He highlights the links between those debates, arguments concerning “the form of knowledge found in the natural sciences,” and debates concerning the identity of psychology and history as sciences. The central chapters are largely organized on the basis of the actors’ distinction between “empiricists” (e.g., J. S. Mill, Herbert Spencer, and Shadworth Hodgson) and “idealists” (e.g., Francis Bradley, James Ward, and, for his theory of knowledge, G. F. Stout). In general, empiricists tended to deny the commonsense perception of the will as an actual agent (a power), endowed with substantive reality and freedom. They also tended to allow only Humean causes and to deny the existence of “efficient causes” (that is, in Thomas Reid’s terminology, causes understood as real agents; <italic>ibid.</italic>, p. 83). Idealists, instead, usually rejected Hume’s constant conjunction account of causality and inclined to view the “individual will” as “the agent of spirit in the world” (<italic>ibid.</italic>, p. 66). However, Smith persuasively shows that the divides between the two camps were far more fluid than is usually thought, allowing for many exceptions and surprising convergences between self-avowed idealists and empiricists.</p>
         <p>Amidst close analysis of a wide range of scientific and philosophical texts (including Huxley’s “Evolution and Ethics,” the focus of Ch. 6), readers can at times feel that they are losing the forest for the trees, but persistence will be rewarded. <italic>Free Will</italic> offers much more than new insight into historical debates often bracketed by historians but central to the constitution of philosophy and of the human sciences at the turn of the twentieth century. In this volume Smith mobilizes historical analysis for a philosophical purpose that will strike a chord with many. Smith is very explicit about his desire “to be philosophical” (<italic>ibid.</italic>, p. 9). Thinking <italic>with</italic> his actors, he makes the case for a positive philosophical legacy of the late Victorian tradition of the “phenomenology” of the will and of activity. “Phenomenologists” (a historian’s term) like William James, James Ward, Stout, and “honorary” late Victorian Alfred North Whitehead emphasized the phenomenal reality of mental activity—that is, the reality of the unmediated awareness of feelings (perceptions, intuitions, etc.) of activity. Among these figures, Stout, whose work is more familiar to historians of philosophy than historians of science, embraced the traditional argument according to which “awareness of own agency” was “indivisibly one” with awareness of agency in the world (<italic>ibid.</italic>, p. 167). Stout adopted a long-standing form of “anthropomorphism” that made “human-action” into the “prototype of the notion of cause” and thus provided fuel for arguments against Hume’s conception of causation (<italic>ibid.</italic>, pp. 167, 170). James, Stout again, and other “phenomenologists” embraced a second kind of anthropomorphism, as they made feelings of activity—with their perceived built-in sense of direction and purpose—into the source of awareness of the presence of purposes in the world. Smith sympathizes with both positions. Opponents of Hume’s constant conjunction view of causality may not have been wrong “in thinking about human action as the prototype of the notion of cause” (<italic>ibid.</italic>, p. 170). Likewise, the projection of <italic>telos</italic> from humans onto nature was not a “superficial mistake” (<italic>ibid.</italic>, p. 8). Smith agrees with Victorian critics of naturalism that, by restricting knowledge to knowledge of nature and denying that poetic, moral, and religious experiences could qualify as “forms of knowledge,” naturalism ends up offering a much-impoverished picture of experience. “Causal, mechanistic, natural science knowledge,” he concludes, “is <italic>abstract</italic> knowledge.” While “nobody will question its power—for certain purposes,” it is incapable of “articulat[ing] values and [shaping] the worth of life in which we wish those values to take effect” (<italic>ibid.</italic>, p. 8).</p>
         <p>
            <italic>Between Mind and Nature</italic> contributes to a similar project. It offers a “critical history” of psychology, concentrating chiefly on the last two centuries (<italic>Between Mind and Nature</italic>, p. 10). The history is “critical” in at least two ways. First, it seeks to keep open alternatives to conceptions of psychology as a natural science championed, for example, by the behaviorists and by evolutionary neuroscientists today. Smith declines to privilege familiar plots, such as the story of the “advance” of psychology “towards objective biological knowledge” (<italic>ibid.</italic>, p. 16). Because we reconstitute ourselves in light of the stories we tell ourselves about what it is to be human, Smith finds it important to hand his readers a wide range of plots. He constantly reminds us of the availability throughout history of approaches competing with notions of psychology as a natural science—including not only Christian psychologies retaining a substantial soul but also, for example, Wilhelm Dilthey’s focus on “the value-creating activity of humans in history,” Edmund Husserl’s phenomenology, Carl Roger’s “humanistic psychology,” and post-Wittgensteinian proposals, such as in Rom Harré and P. F. Secord’s social psychology, to pursue “knowledge of human actions” through the understanding of language, rather than of causal processes (<italic>ibid.</italic>, p. 275). Smith joins the ranks of contemporary psychologists who suspect that, “however exciting as causal knowledge,” brain science and evolutionary theory cannot function as a source of “understanding of human mental, linguistic and social forms of life” (<italic>ibid.</italic>, p. 278). In short, psychology as a natural science is, as Weber noted, simply unable to answer “the only important questions”: “What should we do? How should we live?” (<italic>ibid.</italic>) Yet these are precisely the questions that many ordinary men and women hope psychology will answer or help them answer (<italic>ibid.</italic>, p. 279).</p>
         <p>Smith’s history is critical also in a second, post-Kantian way, for it aims to inquire into “the possibility of there being specifically psychological ways of thought” (<italic>ibid.</italic>, p. 10). Within this framework he takes up the task both of historicizing psychological categories and of explaining the “apparently banal statement” that “psychology is part of everyday social life” (<italic>ibid.</italic>, p. 15). When and how did that happen? Smith answers this question by following psychologists in a wide range of sites (hospitals, classrooms, experimental schools, child reception centers, factories, advertising agencies, the army, the natural habitat of chimpanzees in Tanzania, etc.) and, in short, by detailing, as Nikolas Rose has suggested that we do, how psychological knowledge came to be “grafted” onto social and cultural practices.<sup>1</sup> In this respect <italic>Between Mind and Nature</italic> is very different from <italic>Free Will</italic>, which focuses deliberately on “self-conscious debate among people who themselves signified the value of their exchanges” (<italic>Free Will</italic>, p. 9) and pays less attention to practices in which participants may have engaged either in order to cultivate the will, redirect attention, and so forth, or as they endeavored to make psychological and philosophical knowledge. Regardless, both volumes use history to rethink the divide between the natural sciences and the humanities. And both make historical knowledge central to the human sciences. In <italic>Free Will</italic> Smith “assert[s]” very explicitly that historical knowledge of debates on the will “<italic>is</italic> knowledge of the will and of free will” (<italic>ibid.</italic>, p. 8). Likewise, in <italic>Between Mind and Nature</italic> Smith’s fascinating, fast-paced, multistranded historical narrative is a way of doing psychology; indeed, Smith offers his “critical” history of psychology as a “contribution” to a “critical psychology” (<italic>Between Mind and Nature</italic>, p. 278). The two volumes confirm Smith’s truly remarkable breadth of knowledge, power of synthesis, and ability to use different historiographical and stylistic registers to convey a message that matters to many of us. Here is a historian who has shown that “history” itself does, indeed, matter.</p>
