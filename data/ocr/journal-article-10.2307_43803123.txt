<plain_text><page sequence="1">DREAM OR DELIRIUM? REVISITING THE AGES IN EÇA AND MACHADO K. David Jackson Eça de Queirós's recourse to the "diaphanous veil of fantasy" intro- duced in novels of the 1880s, O Mandarim (1880) and A Relíquia (1887), finds a counterpart in Machado de Assis's first major novel of the same decade, Memórias Póstumas de Brás Cubas (1880-81). The two authors were aware of each other's work, documented by Macha- do's sharp critique of characterization and motivation in O Primo Basílio (in O Cruzeiro , April 16, 1878). As if to suggest a further ocean- ic dialogue between the two great Luso-Brazilian novelists, A Relíquia was first published in the Rio de Janeiro journal Gazeta de Notícias in 1887, the same year of its publication as a book in Portugal. After 1880, according to Machado da Rosa, Eça explored the oneiric experiences of his characters and in the process enlarged the frame of conscious reality: 'Talvez que a sua maior originalidade resida na integração do subcons- ciente com a consciência da personagem, feita sob um plano em que as fronteiras da realidade externa se enredam no mundo da fantasia, sem contudo perderem as suas linhas prosaicas . . ." (Rosa 199). Oneiric ver- satility is equally an innovative, even experimental feature in Machado's Memórias Póstumas. The striking similarities of Brás Cubas's "deliri- um" with the dream sequences of Teodorico Raposo in A Relíquia offer an illuminating counterpoint in the use and meaning of scenes of imagi- nation and dreams and their role in the art of the nineteenth-century realist novel. Duílio da Gama, a Brazilian diplomat who frequented Eça's house in Paris, confirmed the Portuguese writer's special fascina- tion with Machado's oneiric episode: . . . uma das especialidades de Eça como 'entertainer' na sua casa de Neuilly, nos arredores de Paris, durante a década de 90, era a recitação memorizada do Capítulo VII, 47</page><page sequence="2">48 ROMANCE NOTES 'O Delírio,' da obra de Machado, Memórias Póstumas de Brás Cubas. Eça conhecia-o de cor. Nas palavras de uma testamunha de uma exibição do mestre actor/comediante que Eça seguramente era, ele 'gostava de o declamar pausadamente, com inflexões estudadas, que sublinhava e esclarecia, com um comentário, as passagens de mais apurada análise psicológica ou da mais subtil ironia.' (Lyra 199-200) What the fantasies in each novel most have in common is a universal re-visitation of the ages, placing the unsuspecting narrator in an abnor- mal reality with a privileged perspective on the theater of human history, described by Óscar Lopes as an . . amplo e imaginoso distanciamento histórico e geográfico" (83). Both create an aura of hallucination treated by the narrator with sarcastic and intense irony, contradicting the normal sense of reality in the attempt to reconstruct both personal and historical consciousness. Dreams are incorporated into Eça's and Machado's nov- els as a new counterpoint to descriptive realism, as Lopes comments: "Tanto em A Relíquia , escrita desde 1884, como mais tarde em A Ilustre Casa de Ramires (1900), o naturalismo das notações contemporâneas tem uma importante contrapartida de sonho, polarizada num subenredo que se insere na intriga principal" (85). Traveling back in time Brás Cubas' "Delirium" (Chapter VII) consists of a hallucinatory trip back through the centuries, involving magical perspectives, moral critique, and metamorphosis. In an uncanny parallel to Eça's novel of the same year, Brás first took the form of a Chinese barber shaving a mandarin, who mistreated him, before his body was transformed into a morocco-bound volume of St. Thomas Aquinas's Summa Theologica. Restored to human form, he was carried off by a hippopotamus on a furious ride to the origin of the centuries. The delirium is considered by Benedito Nunes to be one of three exemplary moments in Machado, all involving metaphor or fantasy, in which the author's fiction becomes a form of thought, absorbing and restating philosophies aesthetically.1 The chapter mixes the skepticism of Montaigne with Pascal's sense of the tragic; yet the delirium belittles philosophy with derisive laughter and 1 The others are Humanitismo of Quincas Borba and the comparison of life to an opera in Dom Casmurro (Chapter IX, "A Ópera")-</page><page sequence="3">DREAM OR DELIRIUM? 49 irony. Recourse to humor as a worldview regulates the philosophic reach of Machado's fiction, which alludes through ironic constructs to the uncertainties of faith and reason, a central theme in the novels. According to Nunes, leveling humor revives the medieval theme of the uselessness of philosophical questioning, on the one hand, expressing it with the cynicism of Menippean satire, taking illusion for reality, on the other. The delirium and its voyage through human history recapitulate the conflict between individual and universal wills, dramatized in Schopenhauer's pessimistic philosophy (19). In the passages in which Nature apostrophizes her egoism, cruelty, and self-preservation, Luiz Costa Lima sees an attack against the anthropomorphism of science in the post-Darwin era (66). The delirium can further be interpreted as a form of religious drama (cf. Morgenthaler), or a reconstruction of dream narratives from the biblical world (cf. Husser). Brás Cubas's re-visita- tion of the ages allows him to observe the folly and fatal history of humanity, from its origins up to the present time of civilization. In A Relíquia , Teodoro Raposo voyages to the Orient in a symbolic if fraudulent crusade to recover a sacred relic of Christianity. During his travels in the Holy Land, Teodorico is transported in a long dream chap- ter,2 occupying a large part of the novel, back in time almost two thou- sand years to witness the trial and passion of his god and the origin of his religion: "Em A Relíquia , cerca de um terço da história é constituído por uma inexplicada e 'miraculosa visão' do protagonista-narrador, que no decurso de uma peregrinação à Terra Santa o transporta ao auge da paixão de Jesus da Nazaré, segundo uma versão laica ao gosto da Vida de Jesus de E. Renan . . ." (Lopes 85). By voyaging to the past, Teodori- co acquired a different identity: "It was as if, suddenly, long, laborious centuries of history and religion had vanished from my memory ... I found myself thrown inexplicably back in time. I was no longer Teodori- 2 Óscar Lopes does not consider the lengthy episode to be a dream, because it con- trasts with an earlier dream sequence: "Não se trata de um sonho, porque se segue a um sonho, com o qual vivamente contrasta" (94). The episode is nevertheless symbolic ("Não pretende ser tomada a letra . . enveloped in an aura of strangeness and halluci- nation, intensified by an ironic density out of which there may emerge, according to Lopes, an aesthetically superior form of language and conscience (85). João Gaspar Simões classifies the episode as an historical evocation, while Machado da Rosa consid- ers it to be essentially pictorial: "Trata-se, no fundo, de um sonho plástico" (202). Carlos Reis has demonstrated that the narrative is neither burlesque nor picaresque, because of the limitations in knowledge, experience, and maturity of the narrator (289).</page><page sequence="4">50 ROMANCE NOTES co Raposo, Christian and university graduate; it was as if I had lost my individuality ... I too was an ancient ... a Lusitanian, who had sailed in a galley . . ." (158). His voyage is as much a symbolic re-enactment of the formative experiences of Portuguese history and mentality as it is a symbolic reencounter and re-examination of the mythical origin of national religion and psychology.3 The voyage to the Orient not only recapitulates fictionally Eça's own travels but additionally brings to the text two pronounced contemporary currents, with precursors in French literature: the description of the Orient and the revision of the origins of Christianity.4 Teodorico also reinvents his religious identity. Aware of his privileged position as an observer of biblical times, Teodorico pre- pares for his canonization: "I would be a previously unknown witness to the Passion! I would become St. Teodorico the Evangelist!" (154). As in Machado's chapter, nature and primal instinct also underlie visionary history: Teodorico notes the silent hour when the mountain wolves come down to the streams to drink, and he hears the curses of an angry, wild prophet whose beard resembled a lion's mane. What Teodorico observes in this land of religious primitives is that the person of Jesus of Nazareth is very different from that of official doctrine. His witness of the last days of Jesus is part of a radical de-mythification, based on Renan's Vie de Jésus , in which the divine folly of a visionary who "set out from his village to change die world" explodes the myths of a militant, hierarchical Christian society such as Portugal. Coleman speaks of "a new brand of fictional skepticism" in Eça, who chooses to suspend moral judgment in the name of relativism and the comprehen- sion of folly (165). When placed alongside Brás Cubas's bizarre psychic episode, Eça's radically revisionist regression to the origin of Christiani- ty can likewise be classified as a delirium, a fictional form of philoso- phy. Through irony and fantasy, it draws a contrast across time in a dream, like Machado's, marked by skepticism and derisive satire. 3 João Gaspar Simões comments on the connections between the novel and Portugal: "[em 1884] Já na capital, porém, no seu quartinho sôbre a Rua do Príncipe, trabalhava nesse livro. É possível que as emoções que Lisboa nêle acordava, após tantos anos de ausência, lhe tenham trazido ao espírito êsses dias de 1869, em que partira para o Egipto, sua primeira evasão do solo pátrio. O certo é que a idéia de 'A Relíquia' se relaciona com essa estadia em Portugal" (453). 4 According to Berini, the precursors include Balzac's Sur Cathérine de Médicis , Burton's personal narratives, Chauteaubriand's Voyage en Orient , Hugo's Les orientales and the Orientalism of Nerval, Flaubert, and Gautier. Machado da Rosa cites Flaubert's La Tentation de St. Antoine as a model for A Relíquia (198).</page><page sequence="5">DREAM OR DELIRIUM? 5 1 Satirical revisionism The brief narrator's prologue to A Relíquia that justifies his memoirs and prepares the reader for his oneiric voyage, placing the "heavy vest- ments of History . . . beneath the colorful mask of Farce!" (10), is com- parable to Brás Cubas's unreliable narrative introduction of his delirious backward procession in time. In a rational, objective tone Teodorico states that he had been miraculously a witness to events in the time of Pontius Pilate. He imagines an excursion to earlier religious holy lands, the sweet valley of the Rajagaha where the Buddha lived, or to the cave of Hira or holy sands of Mecca crossed by the Prophet. While his jour- ney to the Orient was responsible for his station in Portuguese society, yet the learned Topsius had ridiculed him for pious credulity. The apex of this satirical situation is found in the suggestion in Topsius's book that Teodorico has carried to the Orient the remains of his ancestors in two brown paper packages. The implication is that the Portuguese are themselves relics in the making, condemned to relive history while overlooking their own rivers, trees, and villas because "they were never brushed by the wings of armed and glittering angels . . ." (8). Teodori- co's miraculous re-visitation of the time of Christ means to compensate for this fatal deficiency in national life, but only, as he comments satiri- cally, were he to be viewed by the liberal bourgeoisie as a patriarch, and not the lascivious traveler "weighed down with the bones of ancestors."5 In this satire, Lopes sees a reference to the hypocrisy of the bourgeois class to which Teodorico pretends: "dominados por um moralismo senti- mental. pequeno-burguês muito hipócrita ... se mostrou receptivo às manifestações mais imaginativas e desenganadas da sensibilidade poéti- ca que então regia as sociedades burguesas mais evoluídas . . ." (85). Intensifying the convoluted satire of illusions, Teodorico desires to authenticate his own book rhetorically by invoking his status as knight commander and landowner, the pretence that he is writing at leisure on holidays, and the objective of writing a purely spiritual, philosophical lesson as a monument to the century. He has become yet another "defunto autor," like Brás Cubas, who speaks from a kind of afterlife, a 5 It is pertinent to the context of Eça's parody to note that in 1880 the bones of heroes of the Portuguese voyages, including Vasco da Gama, were conveyed to the Jerónimos Cathe- dral in Lisbon. See Sanjay Subrahmanyam, The Career and Legend of Vasco da Gama.</page><page sequence="6">52 ROMANCE NOTES supreme national perspective. In effect, he is confirming his own voyage as a recapitulation of and reward for the national paradigm. When he meets Alpedrinha on board The Cayman, Teodorico greets him as "the last Lusitanian who set out for India": Alpedrinha! The same divine thirst for the unknown took you there, to that land of the Orient, from whence the light-giving stars rise into the heavens as do the gods who teach us the Law. Except that you . . . have no heroic beliefs . . . rosary and sword . . . God nor King . . . That's why, among the people of the Orient, you wear yourself out in the only occupation befitting faith, idealism, the courage of the modern-day Lusitanian: hanging about on street corners or morosely carrying other people's baggage. (234) At the culmination of Brás Cubas's wild ride in the delirium, Pando- ra carries him to the top of a mountain, from whence he can view a syn- thesis of the centuries. This plastic, visionary scene reconstructs the theme of the crystalline globe, the "máquina do mundo," which the god- dess Thetys reveals to Vasco da Gama on a peak on the enchanted island of love in The Lusiads. There, Gama is able to view the future deeds of the Portuguese, whereas Brás Cubas is limited to the past. He witnesses a living condensation of all the ages in their harsh and intense spectacle: "all races, all passions, the tumult of empires, the war of appetites and hates, the reciprocal destruction of creatures and things" (19). Teodori- co, after his marvelous vision of a new-built white city in the Holy Land, likewise witnesses the extreme venality and homicidal self-inter- est of religious sects. Brás begs Pandora to digest him, to reabsorb him in her womb, but instead the goddess forces him to witness the parade of the ages. In the case of Teodorico, his incorporation into the womb of nature is the object of his quest for sensual and passionate bodies, the "solid, succulent" relics of his obsessive, universal devotion, quest, and devouring of the past. His incorporation in the erotic body of the ages is also a gesture of self-preservation, as he attempts to escape castration by his zealous aunt. Complex antitheses Beginning with its narrative situation, Machado's fantasy in the Memórias Póstumas presents a telling point of comparison in its juxta- position of death and eroticism, the symbolic present and past. This con-</page><page sequence="7">DREAM OR DELIRIUM? 53 trast belongs to the "complex system of antitheses" or antinomies that Coleman observes in A Relíquia (167). The interwoven themes are also prominent in A Relíquia , emphasizing the comic despair underlying both narrations, resulting from the ferocious de-mythification of histo- ry, both individual and collective, and motivating the presentation of experience in the metaphor of theater or performance. In the "Delirium," as he lays dying the now deceased narrator recollects the story of his own delirium as if he were conducting the scientific analysis of a per- sonal psychosis. Speaking from beyond the grave, the narrator is detached from personal experience, but nevertheless attempts to recon- struct its possible meaning in an ironic retrospective. His personal mem- oirs may be considered representative of a national society and psychol- ogy. The delirium is prepared in a previous chapter with strong symbols, whose relationship to the opaque, distorted meaning of the delirium is not readily apparent. Appearing at Bras's bedside in a scene reflecting Corneille is Virgflia, his life's great obsession, with whom he had a pas- sionate affair twenty years earlier: "We hadn't seen each other for two years and I saw her now not as she was but as she had been, as we both had been, because some mysterious Hezekiah had made the sun turn back to the days of our youth ... the eternity of nothingness was stronger than time, who is the minister of death" (13). Revisitation of the ages is established in this scene with the magical force of passion and prophecy, founded on a supernatural eroticism. Virgflia could be called Bras's relic, a goddess of past erotic powers, who symbolizes res- cue from death, or even resurrection. The scene's satirical foundation, ridiculing philosophy, springs from Bras's rhetorical assertion that the illusion of memory is better than pre- sent reality, which is never worthy of confidence: ". . . remembering is the least evil. No one should trust present happiness . . . With the passing of time and the end of rapture, then, yes, then perhaps it's possible really to enjoy, because between these two illusions the better one is the one that's enjoyed without pain" (13). There is a certain Orientalism in this argument, which seeks to avoid experience as suffering, but is at its core the sophistic and self-serving conceit of a memorialist who alleges that true enjoyment occurs when rapture is no longer present; re- visitation of the past through memory may be an illusion, but a superior illusion, since it ostensibly causes no pain. Brás allegorizes the satire by intro- ducing his theory of human editions, in which the present expels the</page><page sequence="8">54 ROMANCE NOTES past. The human editions, reminiscent of an evolutionary Summa Theo- logica of bodies and books, represent a subjugation of individual will to the timeless self-preservation of nature. In this guise, Virgflia appears as a goddess of nature and time, whose aged visage returns Brás's thoughts to the chronological present moment; her gutted beauty and spent pas- sion - "the beauty of age, an austere maternal look" (14) - symbolize the voluptuousness of nothing, the great passion of which nothing was left. She has become Pandora or Nature, as the goddess in the delirium: the figure of a wild and incomprehensible woman appearing out of diaphanous forms with eyes that blazed like the sun, who identified her- self as Nature or Pandora, his mother and his enemy who has grants him the torment of remaining alive with the prophecy, "You great lascivious man, the voluptuousness of nothingness awaits you" (17-18). Even under this condemnation for failure, pronounced by his god- dess in disguise, there is room for the dissimulation of illusion and satire; Virgflia relates news of the outside world with a certain wicked humor and salty tongue in which Brás shares the satanic pleasure of liv- ing, as if he were not on his deathbed. She apostrophizes: "Dying! We all have to die. It's enough just being alive" (14), thus unwittingly con- firms that passion must finally conform to the ages and be rendered unrecognizable by time. This philosophical fatalism is confirmed when Brás hears Virgflia speak disdainfully and indignantly about a friend of hers who is involved in an illicit love affair. He reacts with an anthropo- morphic reflection on human nature: "I asked myself what the hawks might have said about us humans if Buffon had been born a hawk . . ." (15). The hawk might have spoken as Nature did in the delirium; when Brás begged for more time to live, the goddess coldly stated that he was no longer needed. To devour or be devoured is all the same, and Brás realizes that he has now been devoured. If Virgflia appears to Brás in both erotic-religious and pagan-destruc- tive avatars, in A Relíquia a similar paradigm is embodied by Dona Patrocínio das Neves, whose religious fervor veils an intensely repressed sensuality (cf. Blackmore). In Teodorico's first dream, the naked Devil idealizes a return to classicism by invoking the languid silence of the sea, tales of travelers, songs of Muses, and the beauty of Venus. It is the vision of D. Patrocínio - pale, terrible, and obsessed with objects of filth - that wakes Teodorico in a sweat. Yet D. Patrocínio swoons with saint- ly pleasure in a delirium of her own making upon sensing the amorous</page><page sequence="9">DREAM OR DELIRIUM? 55 odor of the relic, still hidden in its package, in actuality Miss Mary's nightgown. This piece of linen redolent of sin betrays not only Teodori- co's sensuality but also exposes an occult paradigm of Lusitanian voy- ages and faith. Coleman captures this side of Patrocinio's devotion in the description of the "primitive and fanatic fetishism of [her] lumi- nous . . . altar . . . [and] oratory" (79). Bones of heroes Following a satirical urge in his learned travelogue, Topsius wrote that the bones of Portuguese ancestors were contained in the brown packages of Teodorico's voluptuous voyage; his assertion thus joins the themes of death and eroticism. Blackmore has demonstrated the fluidity between relics and fetishistic objects (52), an interpretation that also applies to the relationship between Virgilia and the dying Brás. The relic represents obsessive devotion and desire, according to Blackmore, through which it acts as a talisman linked to the concept of a voluptuous body. While symbolizing a link with the past, relics are at once ritualis- tic in their erotic fetishism and a-temporal objects, capable of collapsing stretches of elapsed, chronological time (48). Such is the case when Brás notices Virgilia enter his room, but sees her in the past. Teodorico and Topsius collapse time when they cross a square in Jerusalem and encounter a Roman-style bath house, in which Teodorico sees an idol to be worshipped, a fetish object in the form of a primitive force: "And beneath one of the columns in the atrium . . . stood a marvellous crea- ture, utterly immobile . . . like some idol: . . . magnificent, lascivious and pontifical, with her great limbs pale as marble . . ." (140-141). The principal objects symbolizing death and fetishistic eroticism in A Reliquia are, of course, the crown of thorns and Miss Mary's night- gown, whose equivalency and substitution brings Teodorico's profane peregrination to a crisis. Coleman perceives that the possible identifica- tion of the two relics on the symbolic plane lies at the core of Teodori- co's experience, casting his liberal skepticism against the power of mythical forms: "The initial duplicity or 'doubleness' of the two relics may well explain the nature and category of Teodorico's visionary voy- age back into the Holy City's past . . . The dream is more in the realm of a 'miraculous vision,' constructed with the detail and ardor so much</page><page sequence="10">56 ROMANCE NOTES in vogue in such a work as Flaubert's Salammbô" (179). Teodorico's passions and deliriums, however, have consistently crossed religious fetishism with voluptuous desire, at odds with his liberal education at Coimbra. The symbolism connects his Portuguese world of excessive if duplicitous devotion with the hallucinations and psychic delirium of his liberating and symbolic travels back through the ages to the source or primitive origin of passion: At night, after taking tea, I would retreat to the chapel, as if to a fortress of sanctity, and gaze upon the golden body of Christ, nailed upon his beautiful blackwood cross. But then the brilliant gleam of precious metal would gradually dim and take on the color of pale, warm, tender flesh; the skeletal body of the sad Messiah would fill out, become divinely transformed into beautiful curves; lascivious ringlets of black, curly hair would twine amongst the crown of thorns; on his chest, above the two wounds, two rosebud-nippled breasts would bloom, splendid, firm, erect; and I would see my Adélia there on the cross, naked, proud, smiling, victorious, profaning the altar and opening her arms to me! (55) This scene is reproduced in parody when, on board The Cayman to Egypt, Teodorico spies the long, lustrous cape of the nun who had rescued Mary's nightdress from the waves. In a delirium of passion, he imagines that he will rekindle her fertility, rescuing her from the sterile corpse of a god. In reality, he means to rescue his own biography and sexuality from sterility and anonymity. He is aflaime, as the idea of a carnal, religious love "flashed upon my soul." At this climactic moment, however, the ship shifts with a swell and Teodorico is overtaken by seasickness. Fantasy in the realist novel Subsequent novels by Eça and Machado continue to develop the oneiric dimensions of philosophy or satire. The theme of individual ver- sus universal will is satirized in Os Maias in the description of João da Ega's non-existent novel: "Ega's book! ... It was to be a prose epic . . . entitled Memoirs of an Atom, and was autobiographical in form. In the first chapter . . . Ega's atom . . . was still roaming amid the cloudiness of the primitive nebulae . . ." (100-01). The voyage through time of Ega's atom recapitulates Brás Cubas's vision of the centuries of human history in his delirium. The conflation of death and Eros appears in oneiric scenes by both authors. When Carlos de Maia learns that Maria Eduarda</page><page sequence="11">DREAM OR DELIRIUM? 57 had been purchased by the ostensible Brazilian husband, he condemns her for possessing a book that would reveal secrets of the unconscious: . . the book entitled Explanation of Dreams at her bedside . . . Now even the ardour of her kisses seemed to derive not from sincerity and passion but from the science of sex!" (427-428). In Machado de Assis' Dom Casmurro , Bento Santiago recounts a hallucination while the Emperor's coach passes in the street; he con- vinces the Emperor of Brazil to visit his mother for the purpose of releasing him from her promise of sending him to the seminary: "... I had a fantasy, nothing less than the idea of going to see the Emperor, telling him everything and asking him to intervene. I wouldn't confide this idea to Capitu. 'If His Majesty asks, Mamma will give way,' I thought to myself' (XXIX). In Teodorico's final delirium in A Relíquia , he confronts Christ, who comes alive from an illustration to confront Teodorico with his hypocrit- ical behavior. As in the earlier dream and delirium, once again there is a voyage back in time, a re-visitation of the ages: "I am not Jesus of Nazareth, nor any other God created by man. I pre-date all transitory gods; they are born in me; they live in me; they are transformed in me and they dissolve in me; and I remain eternally around and above them . . ." (273). This conclusive scene can be collated with Teodorico's vision of the Devil in his first dream. There, the Devil expresses his unspeakable tedium at the creation of yet another god, in a world where he is con- demned to remain for eternity. Thus, he too defines religious figures as psychological manifestations of an eternal natural principle. Preferring the perfect beauty and complex ferocity of classical gods, the Devil iden- tifies Maricoquinhas as the goddess Isis, who was mounted by Osiris amidst strident noise of bronze harps. In the Mediterranean world, Teodorico has met a classical goddess.6 6 The "amorous roaring of the divine cow" is the subject of a pointedly psychological dream in Os Maias: "But that night [Ega] dreamed of Rachel and Damaso. He saw them rolling along a never-ending road between orchards and vineyards, lying together in an ox-cart on a straw mattress displaying the rich lascivious black satin bedspread from the Villa Balzac; the two lay clasped together kissing under the cool shade of the overhang- ing branches to the sound of the squeaking wheels. And the cruelest feature of the unpleasant dream was that Ega, without losing his consciousness and manly pride, was one of the oxen drawing the cart! The ox-flies stung him, the yoke weighted heavily on his neck, and the louder the kisses behind him, the more he stretched up his head and dribbled, shook his horns and lowed pitifully to the heavens!" (514).</page><page sequence="12">58 ROMANCE NOTES The role of death and eroticism in the course of national social phi- losophy is the theme to which Machado de Assis returns at the conclu- sion of Brás Cubas's memoirs. In a final summary of his life, Brás offers a small positive balance: that he has not passed on to any creature the legacy of human misery. Yet what appears to be a large dose of philo- sophical pessimism conceals a final satire of illusions, his bitter grapes in an admission of surrender at the hands of fate. Virgflia is still present in these comments as erotic goddess, now a relic, because she was preg- nant with his child before suffering a miscarriage. Thus, as in Ega's dream, Brás lows pitifully to the heavens for the loss of Eros, deprived of offspring, through his own oneiric voyage through human folly. In their later works through the diaphanous veil of fantasy, Eça and Machado revisit the ages, where their voyages take myth and illusion to task by recasting philosophy in symbolic form. The dreams and deliria, which express these profound and subtle insights, need not disturb the genteel reader, however, who will feel the same relief as Brás Cubas, who awakes from his hallucination to nothing more than Sultan the cat with a ball of paper. Or the same triumphant joy Teodorico feels in returning to his former self and time after a few bottles of champagne, emptied in a toast to Knowledge and Religion. Does the sane reader not share that he lacked for a moment the shameless heroism necessary for the furtherance of human illusion? Yale University Works Cited Benini, Beatriz.
