At Kazakly-yatkan paintings are found in various types of spaces throughout the monumental building complex. Paintings in the western cor ridor may indicate a more dynamic nature to these particular images and point to their specific role in processions in this building. The idea of movement conveyed by the in situ procession, which moves northwards towards the portrait gallery in the northern half of the corridor, may also indicate a northerly flow of movement in the corridor, although the relationship between the procession and the portrait gallery is unclear. Yet the width of the gallery indicates that no more than three people could have walked com fortably through it, thereby suggesting that the paintings could only have been experienced si multaneously by relatively small groups. Irrespec tive of their meaning, the various contexts in which the paintings are found may indicate the various roles played by the paintings.110 The physical space in which the paintings are situ ated would also have impacted on how they were experienced by the audience. Certain stylistic traits of early Chorasmian paintings may be cautiously defined despite scant evidence. The use of black contour lines is a common element of the paintings. The simple style of portraying figures at Kazakly-yatkan and Koi-krylgan-kala may also be typical. Both the Koi-krylgan-kala archer fragment and the personages in the Kazakly-yatkan portrait gal lery are depicted in full profile. The figures have rich black hair and a similar form of the nose and lips. None of the figures have facial hair. There are, however, important differences, in particular in the dark flesh colour of the Koi krylgan-kala figure, and the details of the lines of the nostril, eyebrows, and eyes. The coloured facial skin finds some similarities with the crowd scene from Kazakly-yatkan, although the use of the two-tone facial skin colour in this scene is more sophisticated, and finds closer parallels with later examples from Toprak-kala.111 Where the evidence exists, it also seems that artisans in ancient Chorasmia used similar techniques in painting and pigment preparation. The well developed style of painting at sites such as Koi krylgan-kala and Kazakly-yatkan clearly demon strates that mural art was not in its infancy in Chorasmia during the 1st century b.c.e. The presence of wall paintings at large monumental sites such as Kalaly-gyr 1 and Kazakly-yatkan underlines the potential of other monumental structures in Chorasmia at sites such as Bazar - kala112 in yielding monumental wall paintings. This survey of early Chorasmian mural art highlights the importance of this rich visual form of expression that was popular also in other regions of Central Asia and Iran during this period. The Kazakly-yatkan paintings are signif icant in preserving the remains of an early flour ishing visual art genre in Chorasmia. However, poor preservation of sites and wall paintings and the extent of excavation at some sites make it difficult to comment on the degree to which the Kazakly-yatkan paintings should be distin guished from other early Chorasmian mural art. The size and monumentality of Kazakly-yatkan indicate the importance of this site in a regional context, hinting that its visual art has much to reveal about the socio-political situation in early Chorasmia. Regardless of their meaning, the Kazakly-yatkan paintings are remarkable in Chorasmia, and Central Asia, for their extent and diversity. These traits, together with the early date of the Kalaly-gyr 1 paintings, raise questions about the origins of, and influences on, early Cho rasmian wall paintings. Preliminary studies113 suggest Iran and the steppe are fruitful areas of research into these questions. Notes 1.

The most recent calibrated C14 analyses indicate a late 1st century c.e. date for the wall paintings in the western corridor. C14 analyses were largely funded by support from ANSTO (AINSE Grant 00/008). 7. Except for sites excavated by the Karakalpak Australian Expedition, Chorasmian chronology is rel ative, based on ceramic assemblages (see Vorob'eva 1959) and bronze trefoil arrowheads (Helms et al. 2001, 136-37; Rapoport and Lapirov-Skoblo 1963, 141-43). For discussions of Chorasmian chronology see Helms 1998; 2006, 14-15; Khozhaniyazov 2006, 27-28. For the work of the Khorezm Expedition see especially Tolstov 1948a; Tolstov 1948b. The present article follows Tol stov's chronology for all sites except Kazakly-yatkan, where recent calibrated C14 dating has been employed (see Helms et al. 2001, 136-37; Helms et al. 2002, 23; and Yagodin et al. forthcoming). 8. For a detailed outline of Chorasmian history during this period see Helms et al. 2001, 119-22. The terminology used by Tolstov is also problematic, in particular use of the terms "Kangiui" and "Kushan." For use of the term "Kangiui" see Khozhaniyazov 2006, 22, n. 55. There is no conclusive evidence to dem onstrate that Chorasmia was formally under Kushan control. 9. The best-known wall paintings in Chorasmia are from the High Palace and the extra-mural outer palace complex at Toprak-kala (Sultan-uiz-dag). See Koshelenko 1985, 334; Rapoport et al. 2000, 56-64; Rapoport and Nerazik 1984. The paintings are thought to date from the 4th-6th centuries c.e. (Rapoport 1994, 182; Tolstov 1946, 173). Another example of Choras mian mural art comes from Kzyl-kala, where figurative wall paintings fragments have been found that appear to be contemporary with Toprak-kala (Khozhaniyazov 1986, 58-60). Nerazik mentions fragments of figura tive paintings at Ayaz-kala II palace although they are unpublished and are not described further (Nerazik and Bulgakov 1996, 218, n. 31). Other sites dated to between the 4th century b.c.e. and the early centuries c.e. are also reported to have yielded remains of mono chrome painted plaster. However, at sites such as Kaparas these are not extensive and therefore are not included in this survey. According to the published literature the painting comprised a pink coating on the wall of tower 5 (Itina 1991, 166), room 5, and the walls of the steps leading to this room (Itina 1991, 176). The use of pink-coloured plaster as an interior wall finish also appears at Elkharas (Levina et al. 1991, 86, and see above), and Koi-krylgan-kala (Rapoport 1967, 214, and see above). 10. See n. 8 regarding Chorasmian chronology. 11. Rapoport and Lapirov-Skoblo 1963, 141, fig. 1. 12. Khozhaniyazov 2006, 37; Rapoport and Lapirov Skoblo 1963, 156; Tolstov 1962, 106-17. Evidence for this interpretation is debatable. Helms' idea that the site was the seat of a local Chorasmian ruler, perhaps built with Persian influences in mind, seems more probable. For further discussion see Helms' comments in Khozhaniyazov 2006, n. 91, Helms 1998, 89; see also Vogelsang 1992, 29, and Negus Cleary forthcoming 1, n. 39. 13.

See contra, Francfort 1979, n. 114, who discredits Tolstov's idea based on the Avesta that the inhabitants lived within the walls of the fortified settlements. 18. The only other previous monumental building constructed in Chorasmia was at Kiuzely-gyr. The complex of rooms and small "cellas" at Kiuzely-gyr are quite haphazardly arranged (Rapoport et al. 2000, 26 28, pt. 1, pis. 3 and 4) and do not exhibit the orthogonal organisation of the palace at Kalaly-gyr 1 (see plan in Rapoport and Lapirov-Skoblo 1963, fig. 2, and Rapo port et al. 2000, 32, fig. 9). 19. These sandstone column bases are composite with a square, three-stepped plinth and a round, pot like torus that was circular in plan and often had a beaded edge or incised lines round the middle. See Rapoport and Lapirov-Skoblo (1963, 146-47, fig. 3) for a discussion of the column bases at Kalaly-gyr 1 and the possible parallels with Achaemenid and Assyrian column bases. Other examples have been excavated at Kazakly-yatkan (Helms et al. 2001, 132, fig. 17), Gyaur-kala Sultan-uiz-dag (Rapoport and Trudnovskaya 1958, 359), Pil'-kala (Manylov 1965, 47), and Toprak kala Sultan-uiz-dag (Rapoport and Nerazik 1984, fig. 21, and Rapoport 1993, 169, fig. 4). The three-stepped bases may have had religious symbolism given the parallels with the stepped column bases of the temple at Takht-i Sangin and the Zoroastrian stepped altar bases depicted on Sasanian coins (Helms et al. 2001, 133). According to Invernizzi timber columns on torus stone bases are descended directly from Achaemenid architectural models (2000, 32). 20. Rapoport arid Lapirov-Skoblo 1963, 147, n. 32. 21.

Levina et al. 1991, 81-88. 32. This is also true of temple V in the extra-mural temple/palace complex of Toprak-kala (Rapoport 1994, 177). For a discussion of wall thickness and the possi bility of second storeys in ancient Central Asian mud brick monuments, see Boucharlat et al. 2005, 484-86. 33. At some Chorasmian sites a finer wall plaster was used that had gypsum added, giving a pinkish colour when a mix of local clay and gypsum was used in the plaster mix (for example at Kaparas, Elkharas, and Koi-krylgan-kala) or pure white finish, when more gypsum was included in the mix (Kolyakov and Vorob'eva 1991, 166, 176; and Levina et al. 1991, 86). 34.

Initially Rapoport dated the construction of the site to the Kushan period (Rapoport and Trudnovskaya 1958, 366) but later changed his mind (Rapoport et al. 2000, 50) to agree with Tolstov (1948a, 169) that it was constructed and occupied for a short time in the 3rd century b.c.e., then re-inhabited with some modifi cations in the lst/2nd century c.e. Rapoport noted the paucity of ceramics at the site and thus the poor ma terial on which to base the site dating (Rapoport and Trudnovskaya 1958, 363). The wall paintings may date to either period of occupation. 52. Khozhaniayazov 2006, 74; Rapoport and Trud novskaya 1958, 366; Rapoport et al. 2000, 50. 53.

Despite the obviously rich decoration of this room and hearth, there is no conclusive evidence that it was used for religious ceremonies. Rapoport and Trudnovskaya suggest it may have been the quarters of the garrison commander, or for official (secular?) cere monies (1958, 362). The reconstruction (fig. 4 above) shows the fire within a container resting on the altar. It is not clear from the report (Rapoport and Trud novskaya 1958) whether this reconstruction is justi fied by the material evidence but at Tash-kyrman-tepe evidence of burning at the back of the altar niche clearly indicates that the fire was held within a con tainer. See Betts and Yagodin forthcoming. 57. See above n. 19. 58. For example in Hall 8 of Kalaly-gyr 1 (see above), at Tash-kyrman-tepe (Betts and Yagodin 2007; Helms et al. 2002, fig. 12) and later at Toprak-kala (Rapoport et al. 2000, pt. 1, pl. 34). 59. Rapoport and Trudnovskaya 1958, 359. Similar coloured panels or "dados" are found at Elkharas (see above) (Levina et al. 1991, 89) and possibly at Kalaly gyr 1 (see the reconstruction of Hall 12 in Rapoport and Lapirov-Skoblo 1963, 148, fig. 4). 60. Rapoport and Trudnovskaya 1958, 359. 61. Rapoport and Trudnovskaya 1958, 362, suggest that Kalaly-gyr 1 may be the prototype for this style of ornamentation. 62. Rapoport and Trudnovskaya 1958, 359. 63. Justification for the figurative designs in the reconstruction is unclear. 64. Tolstov and Vainberg 1967, 7, fig. 3. 65. Tolstov 1960, 13. 66.

This line is clearly visible in the image repro duced in Rapoport 1967, fig. 80. 77. Rapoport 1967, 215. 78. See n. 5 above. 79. Khozhaniyazov suggests 47.7 ha (2006, 76) and Helms et al. (2001, 123) suggests an area of up to 50 ha. The true area is difficult to confirm at present due to deep sand dune coverage of the southern half of the site. 80. Helms et al. 2001, 138; 2002, 22. 81. Helms et al. 2002, 19. 82. Helms et al. 2001, 138. 83. Helms et al. 2002, 23; Yagodin et al. forthcoming. 84. This is at odds with the ceramic dating, which is "early Kangiui," 4th-3rd century b.c.e. (Helms et al. 2002, 23). See nn. 7 and 8 above. 85. See "Chronology" in Yagodin et al. forthcoming. 86. The area within the monumental gallery walls was originally thought to have been a hypostyle hall (see Helms et al. 2001, 133-34 and 2002, 18), or an open courtyard surrounded by a double-columned portico, but the results of 2006 and 2007 field seasons indicate that neither of these reconstructions are accurate. 87. These bases are very similar to those mentioned above at Kalaly-gyr 1 and Gyaur-kala. See n. 19 above. 88. Olkhovskiy 2000, fig. 9. 89. The use of stone in building construction was very limited due to the scarcity of good building stone locally. 90. It is assumed that these finds are associated with architectural ornamentation. Bronze bands and nails recovered from the fortress-temple of Ayanis in Urartu are thought to have decorated the walls—the nails used to fix the bronze to the mud-brick walls in horizontal bands (Çïlïngïroglu 2003, 205). However, bronze beads at Elkharas have been interpreted as part of the orna mentation of sculpture. See Levina et al. 1991, 106. 91. The pieces are currently being prepared for pub lication. Comparative furniture pieces come from the Achaemenid and Parthian worlds. See for example Ber nard 1970, fig. 13; Pugachenkova 1969, figs. 3, 4, and 6; and Jamzadeh 1996, 105. These carved ivory pieces are especially important because of the rare evidence they provide of the use of organic materials. The use of other organic materials, such as textiles, could also be considered. It is possible that large wall hangings, such as those found at Pazyryk, were used for both heating and decoration. 92. See Daly and Kidd forthcoming regarding the methodology followed in documenting the in situ paintings. 93. See Kidd in press. 94. See for example Sorenson 1997 and Roach Higgins and Eicher 1992. 95. Little is known about ceiling decoration in pre Islamic Central Asia. For structural details in early medieval Sogdiana see Marshak 2000.

Approximately 130-170 degrees Celsius is re quired to process gypsum plaster, compared with 700-1000 degrees Celcius for lime plaster (Sengupta 1980, 83). 99. Baker Brite 2006. 100. We are grateful to David Scott, Ioanna Kakoulli, Sebastian Warmlander, and the UCLA/Getty Conser vation Program staff and students for their assistance in the technical analysis of the Kazakly-yatkan paint ings. La Vaissière proposes that the material "sink abrush," noted in the Charter of Susa alongside lapis lazuli as a product extracted from Sogdiana and used in the construction of Darius' palace, is cinnabar. Fie further suggests that both lapis and cinnabar were spe cifically used in mural painting at Susa (La Vaissière 2005, 18-19). Known sources for cinnabar are the Fer ghana Valley (Gettens et al. 1972, 46) and in north western Iran (Briand 1963). 101. Baker Brite 2006, 59-60. 102. Baker Brite 2006, 59-60. 103.

For example Dashly-3 (Sarianidi 1998, 102 and 128) and Gonur North third temple (Sarianidi 1998, 120-22 and 124-25). 105. Rapoport et al. 2000, 54 and 62, pt. 1, pis. 34, 35, and 58. 106. Betts and Yagodin, 2007; Helms et al. 2002, 21. 107. The use of three-stepped altar podiums (associ ated with indented wall niches) at the main temple of Ai Khanum, (Temple à niches indentées), and the second Ai Khanum temple is interpreted by Boyce and Grenet to have been a local Central Asian device used to reproduce the look of the cultic terraces open to the sky (Boyce and Grenet 1991, 166 and 171). Sari anidi traces such niches to northern Mesopotamia and Iran in his analysis of the three-stepped niches ex cavated at Gonur-depe North. Sarianidi assumes that such niches had a symbolic meaning (Sarianidi 2002, 78). 108. Helms et al. 2001, 123, figs. 7 and 9. At Tash kyrman-tepe the main fire altar is backed by a three stepped niche (Betts and Yagodin 2007, 439, 441, fig. 3). 109. The outer palace temple (Building VI) at To prak-kala has a corridor surrounding the central cella (Rapoport 1994, 180). At Surkh-kotal, which has a very similar plan to Building VI at Toprak-kala, the cella at the centre is surrounded by a corridor on three sides (Schlumberger 1961, 80). At Takht-i-Sangin is the same plan with a four-columned eyvan at the centre 91</page><page sequence="24">K I D D ET AL.: Ancient Chorasmian Mural Art surrounded by corridors (Litvinskii 1994, 52). Both Surkh-kotal and Takht-i Sangin were constructed within fortified enclosures also. 110. See, however, Laurence (1995, 313-14) who underlines the difficulty of defining a relationship between decoration and function in mural art. 111. Marshak 2002, fig. 11. 112. Surface investigations have identified a monu mental structure buried in sand within the upper en closure of Bazar-kala, which has a very similar context to the building complex at Kazakly-yatakan (see plan in Tolstov 1948a, fig. 48). This structure has yet to be investigated. 113. Kidd in press. Bibliography Abdullaev, Rtveladze, and Shishkin 1991 K. Abdullaev, E. V. Rtveladze, and G. V. Shishkin, eds.
