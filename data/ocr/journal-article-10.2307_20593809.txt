Nineteen poets in twenty translations-nineteen poets among whom there are three Nobel laureates, two matinee idols, and one pope. Let us start with these palpable celebrities, and take, first of all, the Nobel prizewinners in alphabetical order. Vicente Aleixandre, the I977 laureate, is represented with A Longing for the Light, a generous selection from his work, early to recent, made by Lewis Hyde. Roughly half of it is translated by the editor, the other half byW. S. Merwin (unfortunately, one early poem only), Robert Bly, Willis Barnstone, and eleven others. The political credentials of Aleixandre (born i898 in Seville) are as good as his poetic ones: poor health and isolation removed him from Franco's world; he began publishing in I926 in Ortega's Revista de Occidente, was influenced by Dario, Machado, and Jimenez, and was friends with Lorca, Cernuda, Guillen, and especially Daimaso Alonso. A certain vagueness of poetic profile has nevertheless kept him, perhaps not quite undeservedly, less esteemed than some of his famous contemporaries. Significantly, Neruda refers to him somewhat patronizingly as the "poet of limitless dimension"; Jorge Guillen numbers him, less than enthusiastically, among the "poets of delirium and free form." 40</page><page sequence="2">JOHN SIMON Actually, Aleixandre's work falls, almost too conveniently, into those three phases schoolboys love: early, middle, and late. The early, emerg ing from a brief dalliance with traditional formalism and poesie pture, soon takes the shape of free verse and prose poems redolent of surrealism, the lava of the unconscious gushing forth partly also under the influence of Freud, whom the poet was reading at the time. Aleixandre called this "poetry as it is born, with a minimum of elaboration," admitting the prose poems to be, of all his works, the hardest to read. I find both the prose poems and the vers libre of this period unimpressive-too private, nightmare-ridden, undisciplined-which goes, I am afraid, also for three later volumes, up to and includingMiundo a solas (I936). From this, I quote one quatrain of "El arbol" ("The Tree"), in Lewis Hyde's translation: Immense knee where kisses will never try to act like false ants. Where the moon won't pretend to be a piece of fine lace. Because the white foam that might even dare graze it one night is stone in the morning, hard stone without moss. This excerpt exemplifies Aleixandre's early strategy of evasion, of describing things that are not rather than things that are. "Now the sun isn't horrendous like a cheek that's ready: / it isn't a piece of clothing or a speechless flashlight. / Nor is it the answer heard by our knees, / nor the task of touching the frontiers with the whitest part of our eyes," we read in "With All Due Respect," and I respectfully submit: "Don't tell me what it isn't-tell me what it is!" [Stephen Kessler translates esa difictiltad (this difficulty) as "the task," and linterna (lantern) as "flash light," out of that kind of perverse, translatorish self-importance that runs through this volume.] The sun, we learn forthwith, "has already become truth, lucidity, stability," which isn't much help either in fixing it in our consciousness. When it is not outright negation, the game is the tenuous equivocation of either-or. A poem in The World by Itselfis entitled "Guitar or Moon," and an entire collection of I935 is named Destruction or Love. Or, even more than not and nor, is Aleixandre's poetic prop. "In front of me, the dolphins or the sword . . ." "Like that final longing to kiss the shore good-bye, / or the painful footprint of a hermit or a footstep gone astray . . ." "Bull made of moon or honey . . ." "A horn or a sumptuous sky . . ." "An upward impulse wants to be moon, / or calm, or warmth, or that poison of a pillow in the muffled mouth . . ." These fragments represent only the most flagrant or's from four poems from Swords Like Lips printed consecutively in A Longingfor the Light. It is, throughout the earlier works, a pitiless proliferation that contributes to their hazi ness. With the collections Shadow of Paradise (I939-43) and, especially, Heart's Story (Historia del corazon) of I945-53, the middle period gets 4I</page><page sequence="3">POETRY under way and things look up. These are mostly reminiscences of the poet's childhood in Malaga and love poems; in them, Aleixandre achieves a blend of verdant innocence and lush description of nature, as well as perceptions of love expressed with a very personal conceptismo-perhaps a synthesis of Ruben Dario's wildness and Machado's restraint. The rhythms are meticulously balanced, and the long-breathed verses often lengthen out still farther at the end of the free-flowing strophes. A fine example from the earlier tome is "Ciudad del paraiso" ("City of Paradise"), dedicated "To Malaga, my city," yet to which Hyde's translation does signal injustice. "Angelica ciudad que, mas alta que el mar, presides sus espumas" becomes "town that stands like an angel over the sea and rules its waves." Even granted that the central panel of this verbal triptych, mas alta qpie el mar, with its marmoreal assonance given final chiseling by the framing parallelism of ma's and mar, cannot be reproduced in English, something like "exalted above the sea" might come nearer the mark, and "angelic city" is better than "town . . . like an angel." And, "rules the waves" having been pre-empted by Britannia, I would opt for "rules over its foam." Consider Aleixandre's "Acaso de una reja florida una guitarra triste / cantaba la suibita cancion suspendida en el tiempo; / quieta la noche, mas quieto el amante, / bajo la luna eterna que instantainea transcurre." "Suspended in time, a sad guitar seemed to sing / the unexpected song of a flower-filled lattice. / The night was quiet and the suitor even quieter / under the momentary moon that flows by forever." Thus Hyde; a more Jekyllish translation might run: "Perhaps from a flowery shelf a sad guitar / sang the sudden tune suspended in time; / quiet the night and quieter the lover / under the eternal moon rushing by in a trice." What is particularly inept about Hyde's version is the inversion; the progression from flowery shelf to suspension in time follows the order in which the senses apprehend the phenomena in question; more over, the song belongs to the lover, not to the lattice. Again, the move ment from momentary toforever is incorrect, and flotvs is too slow; this suggests duration, whereas impermanence is intended: though the moon is eternal, for the lover and for us it rushes by in an instant. And look now at the final couplet:"Alli el cielo eras tu, ciudad que en el morabas. / Ciudad que en el volabas con tus alas abiertas." Hyde translates: "You were the sky and the sky was your home, / city that used to fly with your wings spread wide." Not so. Malaga, on a cliff overlooking the sea, becomes the sky for someone gazing at it from below; so we must get something like "There you were the sky, city that dwelled in it" there is important, for it means that elsewhere, where the poet now lives, no such guardian city in the sky exists. Again, it is not that the city "used to fly" through the heavens; it still does, only no longer for the absent and sadly older poet. Hence we need a continuous action: "City that flew in it [the sky] with your wings outspread." The poems in Historia del corazo'n are mostly successful, the vestiges 42</page><page sequence="4">JOHN SIMON of surrealism discreetly heightening the intensely individual, sensuous perceptions. Especially notable are "The Old Man and the Sun," "Her Hand Given Over," and "We Feed on Shadow." I quote from the second: "Once more I touch your hand / . . . to touch / . . . the skin with its wings and beneath that / the stony bone that can't be bribed, the sad bone that never gets any / love.... [Hyde]. This should read: .... feeling under the winged skin the hard, unsubornable / bone, the sad bone that is beyond the reach of / love . . ." [Literally: "as far as which love never extends."] But in Aleixandre's last phase, things go wrong again. In poems like "If Someone Could Have Told Me" (from Poemas de la constimacion, i965-6), surrealism returns with a ravening vengeance; moreover, a fuzzy mysticism and populism set in. There are still fine passages, as in poems like "Whom I Write for" (or "Who I Write for," as Hyde, who, like his associates, is often ungrammatical, would have it) and "To My Dog," containing such a lovely line as "Residido en tu luz, immovil en tu seguridad, no podiste ma's que entenderme," which in the original has that pithy lyricism, that one talent of Aleixandre's which it is death to Hyde. This should become something like "Dwelling in your light, motionless in your assurance, you could do no more than hear me." Yet Hyde renders it as "You live in your light, your security does not change, the best / you could do for me was understand." One of the few effective late poems, "Llueve" ("It's Raining"), is no less tidily sabotaged by Robert Bly's translation. Take the beginning: "En esta tarde llueve, y llueve pura / tu imagen...." This becomes in Bly: "This evening it's raining, and my picture of you is raining." Lost are the compression and the word order with its near-chiasmus, so im portant because it acts as a linking device between perceptions; we need something like "Tonight it rains, as rains your pure image." But, on the whole, the late work is uninspired, and suffers from a facile anti intellectualism, as in this dictum from "Sound of the War," the last poem in the book: "Whoever touches lives. Whoever knows has died." Aleixandre is worth reading, but in a more fastidious selection and more responsible translations than proffered here. As Nobel laureates go, however, Aleixandre is a rather good one. Somewhat less can be said for Hermann Hesse, especially when he waxes mystically prolix, and when the verbosity is in verse. In fact, Hesse's early collections of poetry, up to and including the volume Crisis (I928), display some attractive short lyrics of the kind Richard Strauss set to music in his Four Last Songs-though even there the fourth, by Eichen dorff, far outstrips the three by Hesse. What we get in Hoturs in the Garden and Other Poems, translated by Rika Lesser, is two long poems published as plaquettes in I936 and I937, and four shorter ones from the late period, including one published posthumously in i962, the year of Hesse's death. There is no critical apparatus except for a brief, anony mous note on the back cover; it states that these poems were written 43</page><page sequence="5">POETRY while Hesse was working "on his great novel The Glass Bead Game [and] reflect the book's themes of mysticism and the search for perfec tion.... These poems elucidate Hesse's physical and metaphysical search for what he described as 'a sublime alchemy, an approach to a spirit that is unified in itself beyond all images.' " I find The Glass Bead Game unreadable, and I am highly suspicious of any search for a sublime al chemy, not to mention a spirit unified in itself beyond all images. In point of fact, "Hours in the Garden," the title poem, is an account of the horticultural activities of the poet in his garden at Montagnola. It is in hexameters, reminiscent of some of the duller productions of Klopstock, Goethe (Hermaun tend Dorothea), and any number of un distinguished German nature poets. Actually, the mode goes back all the way to Hesiod, and has not improved with wear. Here, for example, is a brief passage about the restorative blessings of Hesse's garden: "Jetzt auch flucht ich hierher, den Nacken gliih'nd von der Sonne, / Miide im RUcken, die Augen verwelkt, und will bis zum Mittag / Hier bei spielerisch miihlosem Tun mich erholen und weilen." In English, we get: "Now I, too, take refuge here, my neck red-hot from the sun, / My back tired, my eyelids drooping, and until noon I want / To rest and relax in playful, effortless occupation." This is typical of Lesser's meterless, pedestrian translation, which is the last thing the already footling original needs. What Hesse says is "Even now, I . . ." meaning "even in my advanced age," and not "I, too," like the family cat (earlier described as escaping into the garden), which is what Lesser takes it to mean. "Eyelids drooping" flattens die Auigen verwelkt (with wilting eyes) into mundane prose. Utterly prosaic, too, is "rest and relax" for erholen tund weilen (restore myself and linger); bei spielerisch miihlosem Ttin requires "playfully effortless," an adverb rather than Lesser's adjectival playful. The other long poem, "The Lame Boy," is a well-meaning but bathetic tribute and apology to a childhood playmate who, because he was working-class, was never brought home by young Hermann. The remaining pieces are insignificant, except insofar as they reveal Lesser's translatoritis in refusing obvious, God-given rhymes that would be perfect English equivalents for the originals. Where Hesse writes "Und schwemmte, schlimmte sanft die Wurzel ein," Lesser offers "Slowly poured sun-warmed water over [the roots]." But, surely, "flooded, mudded in the root" would do the trick better. Again, in the last poem, about the broken bough (himself), Hesse concludes: "Hart klingt und zih sein Gesang / ... Noch einen Sommer, noch einen Winter lang." And Lesser? "Its song sounds harsh and stubborn, / ... One more sum mer, one more winter long." It would have taken very little juggling to move that song to the end of the verse, and reap the benefit of an effortlessly accurate rhyme. Our third Nobel laureate is Eugenio Montale, whose The Storm &amp; Other Poems appears now in a complete translation by Charles Wright 44</page><page sequence="6">JOHN SIMON --complete, alas, only in its inclusiveness. By its inconclusiveness or inexactitude, however, this translation of La bufera e altro forfeits any serious claim to completeness. Not much needs to be said about Montale, whose reputation is secure though, I must confess, he is not a poet to whom I warm easily. Neither his "essentialism" nor his "hermetism" sits well with me, and there are poems in La btufera of which I can make very little sense. In the main, I prefer Montale's two previous collec tions, Ossi di seppia and Le occasioni, although The Storm does contain such justly famous poems as "The Eel" and "Hitler Spring," as well as several wildly imaged but delicately worded lyrics in which, between rampaging skies and uncaring seas, the poet must eke out an ambiguous relationship with nature and a mysterious, many-named beloved, both of whom seem to give with one hand only to take with the other. The Ligurian littoral is obsessively present ("each of us has a country like this one, even if altogether different, which must always remain his landscape, unchanging"), as is the elusive woman with the clouds of hair and rainbow eyes, and, however muted, the viciousness of war. But much, much is lost in Wright's translation, which sometimes mis understands and, at other times, overelaborates and waters down the original. Very seldom does it have anything like Montale's verbal music, granted that our language does not sing as spontaneously as the Italian. But must the English of this poet and professor of English from the University of California at Irvine be quite so slapdash? "You are him," we read; and "you, leapt down from some height, alter its color." There is a ghastly "and, too," reveille as a verb, and "different than." We get the over-accusative "that satisfied whomever [sic] would face the narrow gate," and the non-objective "meeting Diotima, she [sic] who resembled you"; and there are many missing subjunctives, as in "as though it feeds." Wright is thrown by proper names: Ariete (Aries, the ram) is left untranslated; so, too, is Pafntizio, in whom Wright evidently fails to recognize Paphnutius, the hero of Anatole France's Thais. Again, in English, it must be the "hills of Monferrat," not the "hills of Monferrini," which is the Italian adjective for Monferratian, as it were. Nevertheless, The Storm &amp; Other Poems won the PEN translation prize, and was considered for a National Book Award until too many mistakes surfaced, notably truffatissimi agi (ill-gotten gains, or comforts) rendered as "wily needles," based on a confusion between agi and aghi. But consider how Wright wrongs a poem like "The Shadow of the Magnolia," which begins: "L'ombra della magnolia giapponese / si sfoltisce or che i bocci paonazzi / sono caduti," literally: "The shadow of the Japanese magnolia is thinned out now that the purplish buds have fallen." But Wright gives us: "The shadow of the Japanese mag nolia / drapes thinner, bonier fingers over the ground now / that its purple blooms are gone . . ." This is sticking a cuckoo's egg into Mon tale's verse, and a cuckoo metaphor it is: draped fingers on the ground? 45</page><page sequence="7">POETRY When Montale writes la via piu' dura, Wright carelessly turns the harder way (via) into a harder life (vita); le fredde banchine del tta fitlme (the cold wharves of your river) becomes "the hoarfrost of your river banks"; constellations that remain "indistinct" in Montale are "un focused" in Wright; "the shiver of frost does not bend you" becomes "you are not jarred by the stutter and shiver of sleet," with the prolixity weakening the image. Similarly, "the file that cuts finely" turns into "the carver's file, once subtle and true," which is both inaccurate and verbose. "The empty. crust of the singer" (presumably the bark of the tree formerly inhabited by songbirds) becomes "the hollow hull," introducing an irrelevant boat image. Montale: ". . . Foltrocielo / che ti conduce e in cui mi getto, cefalo / saltato in secco al novilunio. // Addio." ("The beyond / that leads you and into which I hurl myself, mullet / that has jumped onto land at the new moon. // Good-bye.") Wright: ". . . the other side of the sky / that leads you on. There I swim, break water, / a fish in the high dry air under the new moon. // Addio." "The other side of the sky" is overliteral and cumbersome, "leads you on" has negative overtones, "I swim, break water" merely breaks wind, and "a fish in the high dry air" is plain nonsense. Moreover, leaving the addio untranslated is an affectation as if, somehow, the Italian word contained profundities the English equivalent could not render. But it is not only Montale's meanings and images that suffer; his very rhythm and melody are undermined. In the text, the syllabic count does not greatly vary from line to line: "non e piu / il tempo dell'unisono vocale, / Clizia, il tempo del nume illimitato / che divora e reinsangua i suoi fedeli. / Spendersi era piui facile, morire . . ." And Wright? "It is no longer, / Clizia, a season of singing in unison, a time / when the limitless god devours his faithful, then gives them back their blood. / Giving up was easier, dying . . ." Note the disparity between the last two quoted verses (the second of which is two verses in Montale), and observe, incidentally, that spendersi is to consume or spend oneself, not "giving up." If this is not evidence enough, the reader is invited to examine what Wright does to "The Eel," particularly to its ending, where, for example, immersi nel tmo fango (submerged in your mud) becomes "up to our hairlines in your breathing mud." And such stuff wins translation prizes! We come now to the brace of matinee idols-Russian ones, and thus, more appropriately, street-corner or sports-stadium favorites: Yevgeny Yevtushenko and Andrei Voznesensky, specialists, in Arthur Miller's phrase about the latter, in carving out "a private speech for public occasions, an intimacy which is yet open-armed about the world." Neither of these poets is to be taken very seriously, although Voznesen sky started out better than he is in Nostalgiafor the Present, and although this new collection is still superior to Yevtushenko's current The Face Behind the Face. What we have here is a kind of wit writing, vers de 46</page><page sequence="8">JOHN SIMON societ6 (but Marxist societe): neat poems with pointes simple enough for any alert collective-farm worker to get the point. Or else it is indeed private speech for public occasions-the poet pronouncing on political, social, artistic matters of general interest in a way that even the worst commissar must recognize as not quite the party line, but that will be tolerated by the party as a court jester's outspokenness was by his feudal lord or king. True, jesters sometimes got whipped, as did these poets when, on occasion, they went too far. But, for the most part, they know where to stop, and the state puts up with them as a reason ably harmless safety valve for public discontent. I suppose they enjoy this privilege-for which prose writers would be sent to the Gulag because they are mostly heard, not read; because the ear is assumed to be less retentive than the eye (or printed paper), and because ugly facts couched in verse may be written off as mere poetic licence. Thus Yevtushenko (translated by Arthur Boyars and Simon Franklin -I can't say how well, no Russian text being included) ends "Mother": When we grow old, then with delayed penance We come to our mothers, to mounds of moist earth; Then, holding nothing back, we pour out to them Everything that once, during their lifetimes, we could not say. As can be seen, Yevtushenko has spotted the new Western trends in spacing and line breaks, but he cannot be pronounced an apt copycat: except for the absurd "we pour out / to them," this looks rather like an exercise in diagramming a sentence. If the foregoing was the private Yevtushenko face, here now is the public one: Oh, how repulsive, When one defeated By scum Proceeds to suck up to it. Don't puff yourself up Into terrible turbulence, Don't drop down To kiss all the arses! Rebelliousness expressed in such pious generalizations is no match for the specific evils of totalitarianism. Whatever may have been the case 47</page><page sequence="9">POETRY formerly, nowadays the face behind Yevtushenko's face is just another mask. Voznesensky's Nostalgia for the Present is, like his previous collection, Antiwvorlds, translated by a consortium, extending all the way from Wilbur and Kunitz down to Ginsberg and Bly. Take, at random, "Lines to Robert Lowell," as rendered by Louis Simpson and Vera Dunham (who, with Max Hayward, was co-editor of the book). Though the poem begins in Russian "Peace / to your dust / foresighted President," the translators, for no good reason, start out "Bless / your grave, Mr. President. / You have been clairvoyant." Wordy and in accurate; surely mir (peace), which runs through the poem as a refrain, is a reference to the peace movement's slogan, and should not be turned into a sanctimonious blessing. Then, again for no reason, the translators suddenly become chary, and fail to translate lines 7 and 9 altogether. A little later, "Peace to my heart / and to millions of sun strokes" becomes "Bless my heart / and millions of hearts that stagger / at a touch of the sun." Again, where Voznesensky says that "the profession of birthing is older than that of killing," Simpson and Dunham trans late: "the art of creation / is older than the art of killing," which is a very different kettle of private speech. But what about the poetry? At the end of the volume, there is a historic narrative in verse episodes interspersed with prose documents the story must read better in the prose account by George Alexander Lensen, from which Voznesensky adapted it-followed by a number of indifferent calligrammes. For the rest, it is slick, self-assured verse a good century behind the times. Here is a typical closing stanza, loosely but at least elegantly and rhymingly, translated by Richard Wilbur: "A deep stream of love. / A bright rapids of sorrow. / A high wall of for giveness. / And pain's clean, piercing arrow." (The Russian stena is really a cliff or rock, not a wall, as it is rendered by several translators; but whoever is feeding them their trots evidently prefers wall.) And here is a quatrain from "Family Graveyard. To the Memory of Robert Lowell," honorably translated by William Jay Smith and Fred Starr: "The family graves lie deep within the wood: / Your parents both are there, but where in the dark are you? / The bookmarks in the book have been removed, / One cannot find the page as one leafs through." What can I say? I hope that Yevtushenko and Voznesensky are still favorites with the Russian crowds they are a lot better than their nearest Amer ican equivalent, Rod McKuen. But if you want a superior Russian popular poet-a balladeer who sets his verses to music and sings them to his own guitar accompaniment-I recommend Bulat Okudjava, preferable to both Comrade Y. and Comrade V. That brings us to Karol Wojtyla's Easter Vigil &amp; Other Poems, trans lated by Jerzy Peterkiewicz, with only one poem reproduced in the Polish original. Wojtyla is, of course, better known as Pope John Paul II, 48</page><page sequence="10">JOHN SIMON but these poems were written pseudonymously while he was still rising from curate to bishop; they could be described as pre-Vatican vaticina tions. Though some are longer and more ambitious, the short "Girl disappointed in love" is representative: With mercury we measure pain as we measure the heat of bodies and air but this is not how to discover our limits you think you are the center of things. If you could only grasp that you are not: the center is He, and He, too, finds no love why don't you see? The human heart-what is it for? Cosmic temperature. Heart. Mercury. This, I submit, fails on two counts: as poetry and as compassion. Loss of love will not be illuminated, let alone consoled, by such simplicities (sancta simplicitas, indeed!); and as poetry, or even pietistic poetry, this is sorry stuff At the utmost, the last hemistich could perhaps be sold to the Ford Motor Company for use as a commercial: "HEART. MER CURY." Call it popetry, and leave it at that. Another Pole, Czeslaw Milosz, is a respected poet (winner of the Neustadt International Poetry Prize-whatever that is), author of a number of prose works among which The Captive Mind stands out as a worldwide success, and now a professor in the Slavic Department of the University of California at Berkeley. The poems in Bells in Winter, interspersed with prose, are of several kinds: philosophical, science oriented, historical, surreal, phantasmagoric, satirical, Western Amer ican or Eastern European in their landscapes. Christianity and war hover in the background; not infrequently, the setting is academia, with its own little wars. At times, this is pleasant enough middle-of the-road poetry, as in the opening of "Ars Poetica?": I have always aspired to a more spacious form that would be free from the claims of poetry or prose and would let us understand each other without exposing the author or reader to sublime agonies. In the very essence of poetry there is something indecent: a thing is brought forth which we didn't know we had in us, so we blink our eyes, as if a tiger had sprung out and stood in the light, lashing his tail. This has the urbane tone of a civilized man speaking to his equals, but there is not much real poetry in it: sophisticated conversation must, 49</page><page sequence="11">POETRY to rise into poetry, become fiercely emblematic, unexpectedly arche typal. The diction, as translated by the author and Lillian Vallee, is not exciting either: "sublime agonies" or that tiger "lashing his tail." Yet sometimes Milosz is even more facile, as in the sequence of prose and verse aphorisms, "Notes," where we find such trivia as "Consolation: Calm down. Both your sins and your good deeds will be lost in oblivion." At other times, the tone is more visionary: "We were flying over a range of snowpeaked mountains / And throwing dice for the soul of the condor. / -Should we grant reprieve to the condor? / -No, we won't grant reprieve to the condor. / It didn't eat from the tree of knowledge and so it must perish." This, like so much of Milosz, is religiously tinted vagueness, and comes from a sequence of six fairly long poems, "From the Rising of the Sun," which is a sort of summa poetica, a kind of Polish-Lithuanian Waste Land (Milosz was born in Lithuania) written in any number of forms, all of them rather un interesting. It contains a goodly amount of autobiography, e.g., ". . . my shameful secret: / That, like the mermaid from Andersen's tale / I tried to walk correctly but a thin pain / Reminded me that I was foolish to try to imitate people"; some spiritual autobiography, as in this list of kindred literary spirits: "Chiaromonte / Miomandre / Petofi / Mickie wicz"-an oddly unassimilated group, though the last two were leading romantic poets in their respective countries; and quite a bit of cosmic questioning: "Who can tell what purpose is served by destinies / And whether to have lived on earth means little / Or much." But, in the end, most of this is rather windy, amorphous, unmemorable, with a ten dency to veer into opacity or banality. There are also occasional linguistic lapses: "as if the city . .. was con sumed by fire"; "so I ran further"; "some lazy earthly spirits" for earth spirits. There is modish spacing on the page; slashes and double slashes make gratuitous appearances: And lo our little sun // warms the frozen earth again Riding past green corn // palm in hand // the King entersJerusalem. But nowhere do I find strong evidence that Milosz is, as the poet and cultural politician Joseph Brodsky claims for him on the jacket, "one of the greatest poets of our time, perhaps the greatest." By far the best piece in this collection is a short, wistful yet wry, lyric dating back to I936, "Encounter": We were riding through frozen fields in a wagon at dawn. A red wing rose in the darkness. And suddenly a hare ran across the road. One of us pointed to it with his hand. so</page><page sequence="12">JOHN SIMON That was long ago. Today neither of them is alive, Not the hare, not the man who made the gesture. 0 my love, where are they, where are they going The flash of a hand, streak of movement, rustle of pebbles. I ask not out of sorrow, but in wonder. That, at least, is straightforward, unaffected, affecting. Now let us leap back in time for some recent translations of classics. First, chronologically, we have The Poems of Catillus, translated by Frederic Raphael (novelist, film and television scenarist, and former Cambridge classical scholar) and Kenneth McLeish (translator of classical drama, author of children's books, and former Oxford classical scholar). This, as you might have guessed, is not a translation at all, but another of those numerous versions or updatings to which miser Catullus is par ticularly prone; the penalty for having been one of the most "modern" poets of antiquity is, it seems, to be perennially modernized into specious contemporaneity. The tone of these "translations" is aptly heralded in the Introduction, where the beginning of Catullus's affair with Clodia, alias Lesbia, elicits the comment, "What better way to mark one's arrival in smart society than by humping the hostess?" In the very first poem, our Oxbridge translators give us a whopping grammatical error: ". . . you alone of Italy's sons has [sic] dared," But let us examine more closely the better known Poem II, "Passer, deliciae meae puellae." Here, typically, acris so/ct incitare morsits Lesbia's teasing her pet sparrow into biting more sharply becomes sexualized into "provoke the little pecker's peck." The phallicization continues: "For serious feelings, let them all go hang," with an obvious double entendre on the "hang." Like others before them, the translators fuse fragment hIa with this poem, and (referring to Atalanta's losing the footrace for stooping to pick up the golden apples) render qiod zonam soluit dins ligatam (which loosed her too-long-tied girdle) as "And pushed her over, at last, into love's free zone." There is method in this madness: the English cognate of zona, zone (as in James Joyce's "Begin thou softly to unzone / Thy girlish bosom unto him") means girdle as well as region, but from this to "love's free zone" is a misleading leap: where Lesbia was concerned, Catullus wanted her charms to be any thing but the free zone that she, to his misery, considered them. One more specimen, from one of the most famous of all, Poem V, "Vivamus, mea Lesbia, atque amemus." Even that opening ("Let us live, my Lesbia, and let us love") is falsified by "We can live, my Lesbia, and love." Why turn the urgency of let into the nonchalance of can? Presumably, just to be different. Again, the translators allow the sound of the Latin to govern their English: "asinine rumors" because of the original's unius assis (fractured Latin!); but where does the parenthetic remark in "The sun rises (they tell us); the sun sets" come from? A 5I</page><page sequence="13">POETRY tribute to Hemingway? The beauty of the original lies largely in that plural "Suns may set and rise," a plural that makes the sun and the cos mos bigger, more impersonal, infinite. And the end of the poem is totally botched. First, the gratuitous and prosy "We mnst do it over and over- / It's obvious-surely you see?" Then the flatfooted "If even we lose track of the figures, / No one can tax us for loving at all," with a pun on tax. But compare the original: "Let us confound our reckoning, so we ourselves won't know it, / And that no ill-wisher can give us the evil eye / When he learns that there can be so many kisses." Surely, the presence of malicious people out to blight an unblemished passion is more dramatic than that vague "No one can," even with its jab at the tax collector. And, surely, the command, "Let us confound!" is more impassioned than that hypothetical "If even we . . ." Provi dently, the publisher has not provided the Latin text to shame these English versions. We arrive, next, at a selection and translation, Poems of Pierre Ronsard, by Nicholas Kilmer, a lecturer at the Swain School of Design and previous translator of Horace and Petrarch. He has also, as the jacket copy informs us, "romantically illustrated" his translations with his own line drawings. It is immediately apparent that Kilmer can draw lines better than he can translate them. If ever a poet needed rhymed translation, Ronsard is he; Humbert Wolfe, for example, charmingly transposed the Sonnets for Helen into rhymed English verse. But Kilmer's licence goes beyond rhymelessness: he will translate a perfect sonnet in end-stopped hexameters into thirteen lines of enjambed free verse! Thus "D'un sang froid, noir, et lent, je sens glacer mon coeur, / Quand quelcun parle a vous, ou quand quelcun vous touche: / Une ire autour du coeur me dresse l'escarmouche, /Jaloux contre celuy qui reqoit tant d'honneur" becomes five lines: If someone speaks to you, or touches Your body, I feel my heart slowly Go cold, and cover with black blood Anger surrounds my brain with skirmishing. It is jealousy that anyone should be so honored. Clearly, the stately, chilling progression of line i-froid, noir, lent, glacer -must be observed by a translator; equally clearly, Ronsard's reverse movement from effect to cause is more dramatic than Kilmer's cus tomary order. "I feel my heart .. . cover ... with blood" is not English; but even were it, semantically and physiologically, plausible, it still would not be frightening; a heartfreezing, however, is scary. Anger (ire), moreover, surrounds Ronsard's heart, not his brain; and even the most literal rendering, "Jealous of him who receives so much 52</page><page sequence="14">JOHN SIMON honor," is livelier, more committed, than the passive and almost im personal "It is jealousy that anyone should be so honored." Kilmer's ineptitude and perversity go farther yet. In his Introduction, the translator correctly states that Ronsard "tends to begin with his visual argument and proceed to the abstract," only to add that he, Kilmer, finds it "occasionally more telling to reverse this order." And so, as he proudly announces, he takes from the sonnet "Comme on voit sur la branche au mois de May la rose . . ." Ronsard's "final line and [places] it at the beginning." The reason-if you can call it that is that Kilmer feels "obliged to bring about [Ronsard's results] by what ever means seem adequately efficient [wonderful phrase, that!], cour teous, and technically sound." And he continues: "My poems will be at times more vivid than Ronsard's; more elliptical; more surprising" -a Stakhanovite endeavor quite uncalled for; we would be quite happy with the good old unvivid Ronsard. In the sonnet in question, the poet proceeds from the spring rose prematurely destroyed by showers or excessive arder (a fine, mysterious phrase that Kilmer vivifies into "hot winds") to a prematurely dead friend, to whom he offers a basket of flowers, "Afin que vif, &amp; mort, ton corps ne soit que roses." That is a charming compliment, to which the poem builds up conventionally, but gracefully and touchingly. When Kilmer, however, begins with "Your body will be roses, living or dead," he not only gives away the show, he also commits an outrage against grammar, and thus against meaning: it is now the roses that are "living or dead," and a body of dead roses may be elliptical and surprising, but it also, quite literally, stinks. Andrey Bely (i880-I934), the great Russian symbolist and mystic, was equally distinguished as a poet and as a novelist. In verse, his last major performance was Pervoie svidanie, The First Encounter (1921), now available in a translation by Gerald Janecek, with notes and com ments by Nina Berberova, who knew the poet personally. The notes and comments are not without interest, but the translation, regrettably, is. What can we expect from translators (Berberova helped Janecek in various ways) who begin with the following headnote: "We gratefully acknowledge Professors Simon Karlinsky and Robert Hughes. . . for their invaluable and friendly help . . ."? You can acknowledge the help of Professors K. and H., but you cannot acknowledge them for their help. Forthwith, in the Introduction, Professor Janecek writes "no direct references . . . are explicit," which is redundant. We then hear about a four-point translation program in which there are first, second, third, and fourth priorities. Yet when something places third or fourth, how can it be a priority? Next, we learn that lines scanning ' %' \j - w - \ U - are "'paeonic' (as Bely would call them)"-would anyone call them anything else? Thereupon we get "overly important" for overimportant, and then "above-considered effects." After this, a perfunctory genu flection to the pseudoscience of semiology is hardly surprising. Moreover, 53</page><page sequence="15">POETRY a prose work of Bely's is thrice transliterated as Glossalolya. Since the Greek word, like its English and Russian equivalents, is glossolalia, either (as I suspect) Janecek keeps getting the title wrong, or he fails to explain something that, unannotated, reflects badly on Bely. Pro fessor Berberova's Preliminary Remarks, in turn, give us such solecisms as "two syllables and less," "amount of pyrrhics," and "eena meena mina mo," which is not so much a solecism as a misspelling. Turning now to the poem, it takes us no more than the first four lines to realize that the translation is hopeless. Bely's autobiographical philosophical-mystical poem of I3 I9 lines depends for its formal beauty on its iambic tetrameter-rather strict, but with cogent and subtle variations-with an a-b-a-b (occasionally a-b-b-a) rhyme scheme. In cidentally, Bely's fellow symbolist, Nikolai Gumilev, wrote back in i909 that Bely had "no real understanding of iambic tetrameter, largely because in Urn he failed to follow Pushkin's example of switch ing to "the fourth paeon as a variant that added the greatest sonority to his poetry." One wonders how Gumilev, who was executed in the year The First Encotunter was published, would have rated its versifica tion. In any case, even without knowing Russian, the reader will grasp that "Kirkoyo rudokopniyi gnom / Soglasnih hrusty rushit v tomi ... / Ya-stilisticheskiyi priom, / Yazikovye idiomy! . . ." cannot be con veyed by "With pick in hand a miner-gnome / Crumbles the con sonant crackle into tomes . .. / I'm-a device of style, / The idioms of our language," where the accidental near-rhyme (in an unrhymed translation!) falls in the wrong place, and where we blithely shift from tetrameter to pentameter to dimeter within four verses. This lamentable performance deserves no further consideration. To wash the bad taste out of our mouths, let us hasten to an out standing contemporary poet conscientiously translated in two separate versions: the Yugoslav Vasko Popa, whom we can read both in Collected Poems 1943-1976, translated by Anne Pennington (and rather grandi osely and fuzzily introduced by Ted Hughes), and in the much less inclusive Homage to the Lame Wolf translated by Charles Simic. Even though, like the poet Charles Simic, I am Yugoslavian by birth, I had not until now come to grips with Popa, and I must confess that reading him makes me feel joyous-not as a Yugoslav, but as a poetry lover. Vasko Popa is a Serb who lives in Belgrade, but was born (1922) in the Banat, the Danubian province in which Austro-Hungarian and Rumanian influences and, through them, general Western ones-can be experienced with particular intensity. This may have contributed to the cosmopolitan, universal nature of his poetry, consolidated by studies at the universities of Belgrade, Vienna, and Bucharest. But being born in the burgh of Grebenats, Popa is also in close touch with the fertile Pannonian soil that, despite foreign admixtures, is fundamentally Serbian. Hence, perhaps, the strong Serbian folk elements in this poetry. Only the utterly nearsighted would number Popa among the epigones 54</page><page sequence="16">JOHN SIMON of surrealism (such as Aleixandre and Milosz in some of their poetry, and Jean Follain and Robert Marteau, whom I am about to discuss, in all of theirs). Popa creates an animistic, anthropomorphic, mythic world out of an iridescent to-and-fro traffic between earth and cosmos, ani mate and inanimate, body and mind-even such personified abstractions as above and below, outside and inside, then and now. Within a very simple semantic structure-without rhyme, meter, often even stanzaic form-there are metaphors, personifications, symbols so daringly com plex yet ingenuously playful as to create a strange simultaneity of the ordinary, mundane, transient with the irrational, transcendent, sempi ternal. It would be a not entirely useless oversimplification to say that the witty and tragic, mysterious and childlike Popa is a cross between Blake and Jacques Prevert, between Murillo and Hieronymus Bosch. Many of Popa's poems form small cycles (which is Blakean, too) criss crossed by further interrelationships. Take the early poem, "On the Hat Stand" (thus Pennington; I'd say "On the Clothes Rack"): The collars have bitten through The necks of hanging emptinesses Second thoughts hatch out [actually "Afterthoughts"] In the warm hats Fingers of twilight peep [actually "The twilight's fingers"] From the widowed sleeves Green terror sprouts In the tame pleats This is characteristic of that curious interpenetration of the human and non-human, concrete and abstract, humor and horror in Popa's work. The very next poem in the minicycle "Besieged Serenity" from the volume Bark (so Pennington to me, Rind seems slightly preferable) is "In Forgetting": From the distant darkness The plain stuck out its tongue The uncontrollable plain Spilt events Strewn faded words Levelled faces Here and there A hand of smoke [or "An occasional hand . 55</page><page sequence="17">POETRY Sighs without oars Thoughts without wings Homeless glances Here and there A flower of mist [or "An occasional flower . Unsaddled shadows More and more quietly paw [or "Ever more quietly dig in"] The hot ash of laughter Here, as so often, Popa manages to personify a mood, a feeling, an abstraction-in this case, oblivion doing its work of dissolution. The fascination lies not only in images as simple as they are strange ("sighs without oars," i.e., floating out aimlessly), but also in the eerie interplay of the embodied and disembodied (which is turning into which?), and in the beauty with which decomposition-mental but also, by implica tion, physical-is expressed and endured. Or take, from the cycle "List" (or "Catalogue"), comprising homely fauna and flora sometimes reminiscent of Jules Renard's, the poem "Duck": She waddles through the dust In which no fish are smiling [actually "laughing," i.e., gaping] Within her sides she carries [why not "flanks"?] The restlessness of water [actually "waters"] Clumsy She waddles slowly The thinking reed Will catch her anyway Never Never will she be able To walk As she was able To plough the mirrors Details are enormously telling: the attempt to prosper on shore transference of water to land-is halfway between metaphor and plain statement, a literal description of the duck (which, by the way, is "she" only because of the Serbian noun's feminine gender); the "thinking reed," which, though Pascalian, is perfectly apt from a duck's point of view; the final coming full circle-transference of land to water-in "plough the mirrors," where water is endowed with the reflecting, broadening virtues of the mirror.</page><page sequence="18">JOHN SIMON Herewith a love poem from the beautifully entitled cycle "Far Within Us," in which war, separation, and reunion form three sub themes; this being one of thirty untitled lyrics: If it were not for your eyes [literally "If your eyes were not"] There would be no sky In our blind dwelling [or "apartment"] If it were not for your laughter ["If your laughter were not"] The walls would never Vanish from our eyes [literally "the eyes"] If it were not for your nightingales [as above] The tender willows would never Step over the threshold If it were not for your arms [or "hands"] The sun would never Spend the night in our sleep The master images in Popa are the sun (life, joy, goodness) and nothing ness; like Ormazd and Ahriman, they are locked in eternal combat. Hence the first verse of each tercet ends on not, which the beloved's sunny attributes, culminating in her full solarity, variously overcome by inducing the organic outer world to penetrate the man-made enclosure, by turning negation into a shining, natural assent. I could go on quoting forever, but let me end with a poem rendered by both translators. Here, again, is Pennington with "A Conceited Mistake": Once upon a time there was a mistake So silly so small That no one would ever have noticed it It couldn't bear To see itself to hear itself It invented all manner of things Just to prove That it didn't really exist It invented space To put its proofs in And time to keep its proofs And the world to see its proofs 57</page><page sequence="19">POETRY All it invented was not so silly Nor so small But was of course mistaken Could it have been otherwise Here now is Simic's "Proud Error": "Once upon a time there was an error / So ridiculous so minute / No one could have paid attention to it // It couldn't stand / To see or hear itself // It made up all sorts of nonsense / Just to prove / That it really didn't exist // It imagined a space / To fit all its proofs in / And time to guard its proofs / And the world to witness them // All that it imagined / Was not so ridiculous / Or so minute/ But was of course in error // Was anything else possible." As for me, I would translate as follows: "Haughty Error": "Once upon a time there was an error / So ridiculous so small / That no one could have noticed it // It did not even want / To look at to hear itself The things it invented / Just to prove / That in fact it didn't exist /It invented space / To place its proofs into it / And time to guard its proofs / And the world to behold its proofs // Everything it invented / Wasn't really so ridiculous / Or so small / But of course it was erroneous // Could it have been otherwise." From this, the reader may judge for himself where I agree with Pennington, where with Simic. On the whole, Simic tends to make things simple, which is right-but sometimes he oversimplifies. Pennington, generally, is more idiomatic-but she sometimes overelaborates or even misunderstands. Thus "Pig," in Pennington's version, begins: "Only when she felt / The savage knife in her throat / Did the red veil / Explain the game . . . whereas, properly, it should be "Only when she [really "it," the pig] felt / The furious knife in her throat / Did the red curtain / Explain the play to her . . ." Pennington overlooked the image of life as a tragedy on which blood descends like the final red theatrical curtain. Sometimes she misreads, as when, in "Before Play," she turns "with all one's weight" into "one's own weight," mistaking svom (all) for svojom (one's own). But, by and large, she does nobly by a sizable body of work in a remote language. And to think that I have no room to quote from those superb cycles, "Games," "One Bone to Another," and "Give Me Back My Rags" (actually "little rags")! Yet even from the fore going examples, readers should be able to tell that the difference between a pope and a Popa is as between heaven and earth-between an imagi nary heaven and an imaginatively realized earth.
