THE difficulties which beset an inquirer into the mental and social life of primitive peoples are obviously redoubled when the investigation concerns their esoteric orders. The mysteries of the savage enshrine his innermost religion and worship; for him they possess the sanction of high antiquity; their ceremonial rites, ordained in the beginning of things by the tribal deities, are preserved with jealous care from the gaze of women. children, and uninitiated men. It is convenient to describe such sacred corporations as secret societies; but this appellation, like the terms totemism and taboo, covers a wide range of esoteric phenomena not easily brought within the confines of a single definition. And, if the many remarkable similarities characterizing secret societies in, widely separated regions have had often an independent origin, we may be certain, also, that a more intensive examination of different cultural areas will disclose a vast amount of borrowing between related peoples. Comparative studies of the technique of masks and costumes, together with a systematic analysis of the initiatory rituals, when these can be learned in detail, should clear up many puzzling problems of diffusion. To outside observation the julicial and political duties of the secret societies appeared as their most striking feature, and quite naturally were the first to attract attention. Early in the eighteenth century Francis Moore's pictluresque description made the 3u?mbo Ju6mbo of the Mandingoes a household word. There was something irresistibly comic in the apparition of this masked and costumed bugbear, whose chief business seemed to be that of passing through a village at nightfall, frightening women and children half out of their wits, and scourging with his rod those members of the weaker sex suspected of a departure from the strait path of virtue. Further acquaintance with the secret orders of West Africa revealed the singularly important part played by many of them, such as Poro of Sierra Leone, Oro of Lagos, and Ilgbo of Old Calabar. They punish crimes and act as public executioners, serve as night police, collect debts, protect private property, and, where they extend over a wide area, help to maintain intertribal amity. When the Melanesian organizations, such as the Dukduk, first came into view it was noticed with interest how similar were their functions as judge, policeman, and hangman, to those of the African societies, a similarity which some have</page><page sequence="2">Totem Clans and Secret Associations in Australia and Melanesia. 483 ventured to explain by an hypothesis of prehistoric diffusion across a continent now sunk beneath the waters of the Indian Ocean. In view of the well authenti- cated instances of precisely the same duties, assumed by some secret societies in America, at points as far removed as Tierra del Fuego, Brazil, and California, a theory of diffusion seems, at least, in this instance, distinctly less plausible than a theory of independent origin. I see in these organizations, so widespread throughout the aboriginal world, one of the most remarkable efforts early man has made to establish, under conditions otherwise anarchical, some semblance of settledl government. But it would be a vital error to infer that the great secret societies of Melanesia and West Africa were consciously devised to preserve law and order in a savage community., There can be little doubt that this legal function is or has been incidental to their main business of initiating young men into manhood. Under their direction the calndidates are removed from defiling contact with women, subjected to various ordeals, instructed in all matters of religion, morality, and traditional lore, provided with a new name, a new language, and new privileges-in a word, made men. Such puberty ceremonies still belong to many of the Melanesian and African organizations, though now these bodies are more or less limited in membership, divided into degrees, through which canididates able to pay the cost of initiation may progress, and localized usually in some fixed lodge. Nevertheless, it is lnot impossible to reconstruct, at least in outline, the steps whereby the rude but powerful aristocracy of a secret society may have emerged from the puberty institution as we find it in Australia and in many other regions, that more democratic body which enrolls in its membership every male and adult member of the community. There is, however, another aspect of primitive secret societies, very prominent in the American fraternities, but hitherto not sufficiently emphasized in the discussion of related organizations in other parts of the world. I refer to their dramatic and magico-religious ceremonies. The initiates constitute a theatrical troupe, with masked and costumed actors often personating anlimals, and presenting songs, dances, and tableaux vivants, which often form an elaborate dramatization of the native leg,ends. Ancestor-worship and the cult of the dead loom large in their rituals: the chief masquerader is frequently a personification of the spirits of the dead; the performers wear skull-masks and represent ancestral individuals whose memory is to be recalled. Ceremlonies undoubtedly magical in character, such as rain-making and sorcery, the preparation of charms and spells, the cure of disease, and so on, are associated with many of the societies. These dramatic and magico-religious features appear to be closely connected with the structure and functions of totem clans. Hence, one is tempted to see not simply a psychological affinity between clans and secret societies, but their truly genetic relationship. Professor Frazer's extensive researches1 have made it evident 1 Totemtsm and Exogamy, London, 1910.</page><page sequence="3">484 HUTTON WEBSTER, PH.D.-Totem Clans antd that the lower races are very commonly divided into clans whose members naintain an intimate connection with species of natural or artificial objects called totems. Furthermore, it is well known that this social and religious institution of totemism, in different environments and under the stress of various circumstances, does disintegrate, either vanishing entirely or giving rise to a great variety of new groupings and combinations. Among the latter, secret- societies would seem to occupy an important place. I have elsewhere' presented a considerable body of evidence for the totemic clan organization underlying mnany secret associations in various parts of the world. The data from Australia and the Melanesian area are particnllarly instructive and deserve extended consideration. EASTERN AND SOUTH-EASTERN AUSTRALIA. The researches of such students as A. W. Howitt and R. H. Mathews indicate that in eastern and south-eastern Australia the initiatory ceremonies bring together all the local groups of a given tribe; or of several tribes when these by intermarriage have formed a community or " nation." The puberty rites thus present a distinctively tribal or intertribal character. It is to be noticed, however, that where the totemic organization is in a flourishing state, one section (class, moiety) phratry) of the tribe, or of several tribes, summions the other to the ceremonies. The tribe or community for its periodical meetings is in principle composed of the united exogamous divisions. The initiatory ceremonies themselves are invariably conducted by the inen of that section from which the novice will be allowed to choose his wife. The miembers of a phratry, sub-phratry, or totemic clan never initiate their own boys. Such arrangements clearly bear witness to the formation of tribal aggregates connected by the practice of exogamy2; just as clearly, it seems to me, they suggest an earlier stage of the social organization when the local (totemic ?) groups were independent bodies, initiating, their own members. A similar conclusion as to the original self-sufficiency of the Australian totemic groups may be drawn from the fact that during the puberty ceremonies of such communities as the Coast Murring, whose kuringal or- bunan exemplifies the puberty rites of the south-eastern totemic tribes, the songs, dances, and panto- mimes are exhibited in alternation by each of the two tribal divisions. In these performances all the animals represented are totems of the tribe, and the performers themselves, whenever possible, belong to the particular groups whose totem animals they represent.3 Such facts make highly plausible Mr. Howitt's sugges- tion that the " animal games " and dances presented at the initiatory ceremonies of tribes which, like the Chepara of Queensland anid the Kurnai of Victoria, appear 1 Primitive Secret Societies, New York, 1908, chap. ix. 2 A.

Indeed, there can be little doubt that secret dramatic ceremonies connected with totemic ancestors formerly enjoyed a wide diffusion amonig the natives of the south-east. The well-known narrative of David Collins2 describes the initiatory rites of the Port Jackson tribe, now extinct, aild makes it clear that in New South Wales a century ago there flourished that sacred drama of the totems which to-day can be discovered only in the remoter districts of Australia, where the natives still preserve their ancient lore. CENTRAL AND NORTHERN AUSTRALIA. If we assume, with Professor Frazer, that the totemism of the Central Australian tribes is less advanced than that of the coastal tribes, at least, on its. religious or magical side, we may expect to find in the central area a greater elaboration of the totemic ritual, so often, though by no means always, associated with the initiation of young men. It is unnecessary to dwell on the general similarity of these historical pageants and miracle plays throughout this region, or on the important place which they hold in the estimation of the aborigines, Proceedings which outwardly appear to be merely imitations of the actions of different animals are really part of the instruction of the novices in the sacred lore connected with the totems and the ancestors of the various clans. There are, however, certain significant differences between some central and nortl central tribes as respects the ownership and performance of dramatic ceremonies connected with the totems. Among the Warramunga where, as in other parts of Australia, the totem clans are sharply divided between the two exogamous phratries, the situation parallels that found among the Coast Murring of New South Wales: the dramatic ceremonies are regarded as the property of the whole totem group. Furthermore, though the members of a Warramunga clani celebrate their own ceremonies or ask someone else of the same phratry to do so; they may perform them only at the request of a member of the opposite tribal phratry.3 On the other hand, among the Arunta, each ceremony belongs to a particular inidividual, either by inheritance from the previous owner or as a gift from ain ancestral spirit; and it need not necessarily be either owned or performed by a member of the particular totem to which it refers. At the engwtra, the last stage in the long, series of initiatory rites, when members of all totemic groups meet and iningle, the owner of a given ceremony may request an individual of any totem, and consequently of either phratry, to take part in the performnance, the invitation being regarded as a compliment.4 I lowitt, op. cit., pp. 581 sq., 631. 2 An Account of the English Colony in New South Wales, London, 1804, pp. 365-374. 3 Spencer and Gillen, The Northern Tribes of Central Autstralia, London, 1904, pp. 192 sq., 298 sqq. 4 Spencer and Gillen, The Native Tribes of Central Autstralia, London, 1899, pp. 278 sqq.</page><page sequence="5">486 HUTTON WEBSTER, PH.D.-Totem Clans and Although the " primitiveness " of the Arunta is still sub judice, I find it difficult to avoid the conclusion that formerly all their totems were confined to one or other of the two exogamous sections, as is actually the case with the majority of existing totems.' Otherwise how shall we explain the fact that when preparations are being made for a given engwu?ra ceremony often only the members of one phratry will be present ; and the additional fact that when two performances are being prepared simultaneously they are always concerned with the two phratries. In the latter case, the actors of the respective phratries are carefully separated so that they cannot see one another.2 Furthermore, if the Arunta totems were once lirnited to one or other of the phratries, it would follow, on the analogy of neighbouring tribes, that the ownership .and performance of dramatic ceremonies was at one time confined to the several totem groups. Even now, every dramatic ritual is associated with a particular totemn, and at the enywura any initiated member of the totem group with which a given ceremnony is concerned may be present when preparations for its exhibition are in progress. No one else comes near except by special invitation of the owner of the ceremony. It is significant also that when a man has received a performance as a revelation from a spirit and gives it to another man, the recipient must be of the totem with which the ceremony is concerned.3 It appears to me, therefore, that the totemic organization of the Arunta, at least as concerns dramatic rituals, is undergoing a gradual transformation, and that ceremonies formerly regarded as the communal property of a single clan are now being parcelled out among the different totem grotups making up the tribe. This development in the direction of tribal solidarity would doubtless have gone further if the general meetings of the totem groups were not restricted to such great occasions as the engwitra. Magical rites for the multiplication of totem animrals are apparently unknown in south-eastern Australia, unless the dramatic representations still found there have or once had a magical content. Among the central tribes there are some note- worthy divergences as respects the ownership and performance of the totemic magic, so characteristic of this area. The so-called intichimma of the Arunta are regarded as the property of the clan group, for any initiated clansman may attend and participate in the ceremonies. In exceptional instances, nevertheless, mnembers of different totems may be invited to witness the rites. Under no circumstances are men who belong neither to the totem nor to the right phratry allowed to be present.4 The Urabunna ceremonies are similarly confined to the totem groups.5 On the other hiand, among the Dieri further to the south, a tribe very closely related to the Urabunna, it does not appear that performances for the mnultiplication of food anirmlals are restricted to the clans having these aniimals as totems; the rain-making ceremony is certainly given not by men of the water or rain totem, but by the entire tribe.6 Turning to the northern central tribes we find that I Spencer and Gillen, Native Tribes, pp. 120 sq. 2 Ibid., pp. 278 soq., 294. 3 Ibid., p. 294. 4 Ibid., P. 169. 5 Spencer and Gillen, Northern Tribes, pp. 284 sqq. 6 Howitt, op. cit., p. 397.</page><page sequence="6">Secret Associations int Austraclia and Melanesia. 487 anong the Kaitish the headman of a totem who performs a magical rite for its propagation is decorated by the men of the opposite phratry; then in the presence of members of both phratries he goes through a ceremony relating to the ancient history of his clan.' A like custom prevails in the Worgaia tribe, where the co-operative aspect of this totemic magic is clearly exhibited.2 The Warramunga ceremonies exhibit a stage more advanced. Here the mauical performances, for the nost part, consist simply of dramatic representations of scenes in the life of totemic ancestors; and such historical pageants, though regarded in each instance as the property of a particular group, may only be given at the invitation of the opposite section of the tribe. It is the members of the latter body who provide all the decorations for the ceremonies and receive presents from the performers.3 Still further northlwards, among the Tjingilli, a dramatic-magical ceremony may be given by all the men of one phratry anid therefore by men of many totems. Similarly, among the tribes about the Gulf of Carpentaria, the participants in magical rites may be any members of that half of the tribe to which the totem belongs.4 In north-western Australia, when magical ceremonies are given, the performers must be drawn exclusively from one of the four exogamous sub-phratries (phratries ?). However, no members of otber sub-phratries may attend at the celebration of the rites: their presence, it is believed, would break the magic spell.6 Thus, as we advance from the interior of Australia towards the coasts, the evidence appears conclusive that the organization by phratries tends to assume a special inmportance in the performance of magico-dramatic ceremonies, once confined to particular groups. The increased significance of the phratries is further reflected in the funeral customs observed in the northern central area, where, as among the Binbinga, Anula, and Mara tribes, distant groups belonging to the sub-phratries participate in the final rites and witness ceremonies relating to the ancestor of the totemic group to which the dead man belonged.6 Again, the increased significance of the phratric organization is indicated for the Warramunga by the conditional extension of the totemic food taboos to include all the members of one phratry. A Warramunga man will never eat an animal associated with a totemic group, belonging to his own phratry, unless it be given to him by a man belonging to the other phratry of the tribe.7 The elaborate systemn of food taboos strictly observed by the phratries and sub-phratries of the north-west central Queensland tribes, where clans are reported non-existent,8 may show that here also the larger social divisions are superseding or have already superseded an elder organization in totem clans. From a general point of view we are perhaps entitled to regard the Australian I Spencer and Gillen, Northern Tribes, p. 292. 2 Ibid., p. 296. 3 Ibid., p. 298. 4 Ibid., pp. 311 sqq. 5 E.

If now a wandering Australian tribe were to abandon its migratory habits and acquire a permanent abode, the secret association ol its male members would present many points of resemblance to esoteric organizations outside the Australian area. For the aborigines of Australia possess the equivalents of the men's house and the secret " lodge "; they possess the interesting system of age classifications, which in many instances furnish the "degrees" of the fully formed secret society; they possess anthropo- morphic deities presiding over the mysteries. They possess bull-roarers, bizarre costumes and disguises, which indicate the connection of the wearers with ancestral spirits, and so easily becomne a means of terrifying the uninitiated. Such features as these, more thoroughly fused, characterize the secret associations of Melanesian peoples. TORRES STRAITS: WESTERN ISLANDS. On the islands of Torres Straits we find a population in physical appearance and culture closely related to the Papuans of New Guinea, yet the affinities of the language spoken by the Western Islanders are Australian, a fact which may indicate that their original stock was Australian, though subsequently overlaid by a gradual Papuan infusion. From this point of view it is at least significant that a totemic system has been found in practice only in the Western Islands. The general features of the totemism in this region are well known, Originally, the members of each totem appear to have lived together in one district; a similar local segregation of the two phratries, for whose previous existence there is unequivocal testimony, has now been largely obliterated: with regard to marriage relations, local exogamy is superseding clan exogamy as among the Kurnai of Victoria and elsewhere in south-eastern Australia. The decline of the totemic organization in the Western Islands may be attributed in a measure to foreign influences; but it seems clear that much importanice must be ascribed to the geographical localization of the old totem groups and to the emergence of a settled village economy. The clans, however, have not wholly disappeared as social units; indeed, the solidarity of the totem clan is still one of the most marked features in the life of the people.' In several inistances the puberty ceremonies of the Western Islanders exhibit an underlyilng clan organization. In this part of Torres Straits the men's house (kwod) appears as an open space definitely aind permanently set apart for ceremonial uses. After initiation the young men could frequenit the kwod, and they habitually slept there. The institution thus corresponds, in part to the bachelors' camiip, in 1 Reports of the Cambridge Anthropological Expedition to Torres Straits, Cambridge, 1904, vol. v, p. 161.</page><page sequence="8">Secret Associations in Australia and Melanesia. 489 part to the bora ground, of Australian natives. Though some islands possessed only a single kwod, others, such as Mabuiag, had several, and each belonged to a particular clan. The Mabuiag folk also had a " national" kwod of all the clans on the sacred islet of Pulu, where the secret initiatory ceremonies occurred. The kwod contained the fireplaces of the five chief clans, so arranged as to exhibit the former dual grouping (phratries) of the Mabuiag people.' Similarly, when the natives of Tutu and Yam met in their common kwod for initiation, four mats and as mnany fireplaces were assigned to the four clans, and the arrangement once more suggested the dual division of the people. The youths undergoing initiation were allocated to that end of the kwod which was farthest away from the mats of their respective clans, and in the territory belonging to men of the opposite section of the community.2 Although the grouping of the clans of the Western Islanders has ceased to exert a preponderant influence on marriage relations, the dual system, as in Australia, is still disclosed at gatherings for initiatory purposes. Magical rites associated with particular clans are found on the island of Mabuiag, where two of the seven clans possess performances, in the one case to control the dugolng, in the other case to multiply turtles. Women and children and memnbers of other clans do not come near at such times. It should be noticed that in each case the magical rite takes place not in the village, but in the special kzvod of the clan. Furthermore, for the surlal ceremony the clansmen paint themselves to represent the turtle, wear headdresses of cassowary feathers, and dance round the turtle, whirling bull-roarers.3 No magical performances are definitely associated with the remaining clans of Mabuiag, nor are they mentioned as existing in the other Western Islands. In several islands there are various magico-religious practices, common, apparently, to the entire community, for the multiplication of food animals4; and these it is possible to regard, as formerly connected with totemic clans. Such, originally may have been the two turtle ceremonies at Gumu on the island of Mabuiag, where bull-roarers were swung and dances were given by performers swathed ill leaves. In another turtle rite celebrated by the Mabuiag folk in their communal lkwod, a number of men surrounded the four chief actors, while masked and costumed individuals, representing spirits associated with waterspouts, played about. The people of Mabuiag had also a three days' dance, which they regarded as "only play, like holiday," but which was clearly a representation of dugoi4g fishing. The performers wore masks and, petticoats of coconut leaves. In the light of the evidence from the Warramunga and other Australian tribes, this dramatic ceremony may well have been once a magical proceeding. Magic for the good of the crops5 is also represented by the ceremonies at Mabuiag, when certain individuals went through the gardens dancing and swinging bull-roarers to make I Reports of the Cambridge Anthropological Expedition to Torres Straits, Cambridge, 1904, vol. v, pp. 3 sqq., 172 sq., 213. 2 Ibid., vol. v, pp. 173 sq., 208 sqq. 3 ibid., vol. v, pp. 182 sqq. 4 Ibid., vol. v, pp. 330 sqq. 6 Ibid., vol. v, pp. 345 sqq.</page><page sequence="9">490 HUTTON WEBSTER, PH.D.-Totemn Clans and the plants grow. At Yam, when fruit was ripe and the yams and sweet potatoes were ready for use, a mnasked dance was held, and the performers toiled zealously through the entire night. In nearly all the Western Islands there were annual masked dances when the ubar was ripe, the object of which was to ensure a good crop of fruit. Their most characteristic feature at Yam was the presence of a single dancer wearing a huge conical mask or extinguisher of coconut leaves, and a leafy skirt. It was highly important that the performer's identity should be unknown, hence he came into the village at nightfall and disappeared at daybreak. The mummer was greatly feared by the men and women whom he chased about. A similar custom prevailed at Mabuiag, where two masked dancers participated in ceremonies lasting for several weeks.' Such performances among the Western Islanders help to explain the terrorist activities of secret societies in New Guinea and the Melanesian Archipelago. The relation of totemism to the cult of the dead appears in several of the Western Islands of Torres Straits.2 At Mabuiag certain individuals, necessarily of another clan than that to which the deceased belonged, cared for the corpse and gave pantomimic performances indicating the totem animal of the dead manl. At Muraiug these " undertakers" recited a special formula referring to the character- istic actions of the totem. Aside from such customs, the f uneral ceremonies had a communal character; at least this was so for the great dance or tai of the Mabuiag people.3 It took place not in one of the clan kwod. but in the " national kwod at Pulu, and always preceded the puberty rights held there. Preparations. for the tai were made in secret by certaini individuals, who went into the bush far away from the womnen and uninitiated men. The performers represented the ghosts of recently deceased tribesmen. They were disguised with leafy petticoats. and masks, and in this costume mimicked the characteristic gait and actions of the deceased. Such a dramatic entertainment could be witnessed from afar by womnen and children who were supposed to believe that the actors were really spirits of the dead; a female of sceptical tendencies who inquired too closely into the identity of the dancers " died that night." At some time during the performance two nmen would go into the bush to frighten the women by making thein believe that the spirits had come for them. The death dances practised by the inhabitants of Tutu and Yam were similar ceremonies.4 The masked men, we are told, used to go behind the houses in the night and blow bamboo whistles, whereupon the women cried. Thus the tai, in part a kilndly rite, containis the germs of that intimidation practised by the men over the weaker sex, which, though met in Australia, 1 At Mer (Eastern Islands) the people of different districts on the island held annual masked dances, which were probably magical performances to secure a good barvest. The dance in each case was rendered by representatives of a particular group; spectators from other groups might be present, buit they were not permitted to wear tlhe masks or otherwise joini in its ceremonies (Reports of the Cambridge Anthropological Expedition to Torres Straits, vol. vi, pp. 209 sq.). 2 1bid., vol. v, pp. 185 sq., 248 sqq. 3 Ibid., vol. v, pp. 252 sqq. 4 Ibid., vol. v, pp. 257 sq.</page><page sequence="10">Secret Associations in Australia and Melanesia. 491 reaches its fullest development in the secret societies of the Melanesian Archipelago. An important person in the mythology of the Mabuiag folk, was the culture hero Kwoiam.' He seems to have been an immigrant from Australia, who after death was apotheosized. His totem was the shovel-nosed skate (kaigas), or this and the turtle (surlal). Two magical crescents of turtle shell made by him were called auqud, the name regularly given to a totem. But in his cult at Mabuiag we have to deal no longer with the separate clalns but with the phratries. The two social divisionis had the crescents for their respective emblems, and the phratry names evidently referred to these magical insignia. Yet even at Mabuiag Kwoiam was sornetinmes spoken of as a totem; in some of the nieighbouring islands he was regarded as the "big augud." We may perhaps conjecture that, as the Mabuiagt clan system tended to pass into a more centralized grouping, Kwoiam the immigrant hero became associated with an indigelnous deity of totemic origin. In this way could be explained the definite connection of Kwoiam with the phratries, and the performance of secret ceremonies in his honour within the national kwod on the islet of Pulu, which tradition connected with some of his exploits. In several of the Western Islands the mingling of totemic groups has led to the decided pre-eminence of certain clans over others. Among the people of Tutu and Yam there seem originally to have been four totem clans segregated in two divisions, an arrangement still recognized in the initiation ceremonies. The kodal clan, however, has become the most important member of its group, and the kursi clan introduced from another island, or perhaps having developed in importance locally, has taken the leading place in the second group. The island of Tutu is now divided into two districts, belonging respectively to the kodal and kiursi groups. A consequence of these social changes, coupled with cultural growth, is probably to be seen in the gradual emergence of the two principal totem animals-k'lrsi, the hammer-headed shark, and kodal, the crocodile-into anthropomorphic personali- ties, identified with the immigrant brothers Sigai and Maiau. The saga of their wanderings across Torres Staits fills a large place in native mythology.2 Their images are kept in shrines in the k7wod near the centre of the island, where no uninitiated person may visit them; here the men's house has become a temple as in New Guinea and elsewhere in Melanesia. Women and children have indeed heard of Sigai and Maiau, but they do not know that the former is the same as ku'rsi, the hammer-headed shark, and that the latter is really kodal, the crocodile. As with the sacred name Daramulun, in the Australian rites, this mystery is onily imparted to the youths undergoing initiation. Various secret ceremonies take place in the shrines within the kwod; food is piled up in two heaps, one for kursi, one for kodal, and every year at the time of the north-west monsoon, when boys are being admitted to manhood, the men dance totem dances, the kcursi performers on the one side, and the kodal actors on the other. The songs addressed to Sigai 1 Reports of the Cambridge Anthropolo,gical Expedition to Torres Straits, vol. v, pp. 67 sqq.,. 153 sq., 367 sqq. 2 Ibid., vol. v, pp. 64.sq., 174, 373 Sqq.</page><page sequence="11">492 HUTTON WEBSTER, PH.D.-Totern Clans anid and Maiau gave fine weather, whether it rained or blew, and they possessed as well great potency in warfare. Thus on the islands of Yam and Tutu, as at Mabuiag, dramatic and magico-religious ceremonies connected with a hero cult seem to be largely supplanting the older totemic ritual. In other parts of Melanesia such esoteric rites have gathered round the figures of anthropomorphic ,deities, who perhaps likewise had a totemic origin. However this may be, the hero cults of the Western Islanders help us to understand why primitive secret -societies should so often enshrine the inner religion of an aboriginal people. ToRREs STRAITS: EASTERN ISLANDS. Among the Miriam of the Murray Islands, and probably also among the other Eastern Islanders of Torres Straits, totemism is not discoverable as an existing institution, though apparent traces of its former presence are not far to seek.' The relationship of the Miriam to the Western Islanders is very close, but in various social matters they have advanced beyond the latter people; among the Miriam, for instance, the territorial grouping of the totem clans has resulted in village exogamy, and the dual organization of the western clans has quite disappeared. In the Murray Islands, it is highly probable that formerly there were secret initiatory rites associated with the several clanis, but with one or two exceptions they appear to have dwindled away on account of the predominance of the bomai- rmal organization. Rites of initiation, together with the related magico-religious performances (zogo),2 and funeral ceremonies (keber),3 seem to have been originally held in the clan siriam, a term equivalent of the kwod of the Western Islanders. "I am of opinion," writes Dr. Haddon, ";that in early days the Miriam were organized in a similar manner to the Western Islanders, and that each local (totemic?) group had its taboo-grouind where lads were initiated, and where ceremonies were held, some of which almost certainly had for their object the control of fplants, animals, or the elements, while others, in all probability, were associated with the death of a member of the local group.'4 Various interesting features characterized both zogo and keber rites. Only certain men officiated in the zogo ceremonies. Their office appeared to be hereditary in particular families, and passed from father to eldest son. Zogo, moreover, were always connected with some group of the people, and were not practised by the community at large. Some belonged especially to districts or to villages on the island of Mer, and others were the property of one or other of the two divisions comprising the bomai-rnalu association.5 The keber ceremonies, the Miriam equivalent of the tai among the Western Islanders, were likewise associated with definite districts on the island of Mer. Such ceremonies, however, could be I Reports of the Cambridge Anthropological Expedition to Torres Straits, Cambridge, .1908, vol. vi, pp. 172 sqq., 254 sqq. 2 Ibid., vol. vi, pp. 242 sqq. 3 Ibid, vol. vi, pp. 126 sqq. 4 bid., vol. vi, pp. 272 sq.

Nearly all these funeral rites, which were marked by the presence of masked and costumed actors simulating the denizens of the spirit world, referred to members of the boi4tai-malt association.' The boniai-malu "fraternity" consisted of two divisions.2 One class of "shark men," the beizam boai, included the leading menmbers of the order; the other class (zangareb le) were singers and drum-beaters at the ceremonies. Certain other people, described as " friends " (tebud), acted as assistants to the two principal classes, but had no right to participate actively in the performances. It is natural to regard these two classes as representative of an earlier arrangement of the Miriam by phratries. Such groups are not to be considered grades or degrees, for an individual belonged to one or other of themn by birth, and did not progress from the one to the other. In general, the people of a given district on the island were restricted to a single division; only in two cases was there a want of correspondence between the bomai -maln grouping and the grouping, into districts. The shark brethren, the most important members of the order, were arranged in two sub-classes, the zogo le, who were entitled to wear the masks, take a leading part in all ceremonies, and receive all the presents of food; and the tami le, who ranked next to the zogo ie, and assisted them in the performances. Other and smaller groups which participated in the ceremonies, and danced animal dances, were the dog men, the pigeon men, and the geregere men.3 Though there is no direct evidence that these were derived from the Miriam totern groups, it is difficult not to regard them as at least in part the vestiges of ancient clans. In any case their performances present a close analogy to the dramatic representations. of totemic ancestors so characteristic of Australian initiatory rites. Even if we asstume that the cult of bomai-malu was introduced fronm abroad, apparently from New Guinea, there are certain facts presented by Dr. Rivers which suggest that the two divisions of the association may have fitted in with a dual organization previously existing on the island.4 Indeed, it is questionable whether inuch more than minor features of the bomai-maln cult, such as certain masks, have been imported into the Murray Islands; it would rather seem that the culture-hero bearing these names (bomai to the initiated, malu to the vulgar) had independently emerged from the totem of the shark people. The amalgama- tion of totemic clans leading to the decided predominance of one clan over the others, and coupled therewith, the rise of totems into tribal deities, is a phenomenon met elsewhere in Torres Straits. The bomai-malut association was organized on democratic principles.' All the male inhabitants of Mer, save certain individuals (nog le), regarded as " foreigners," enjoyed by birth the privilege of membership after initiation at adolescence.

The rites of initiation took place in three sacred grounds, and the participants were so tthoroughly disguised as to be unrecognizable. Bull-roarers were not employed in any of the ceremonies. The chief features of the secret performance appear to ibe the singing of ritual songs referring to the exploits of bomai-malu and the .solemn exhibition of the masks to the initiates. The latter were instructed in -their social, economic and religious duties, and were warned not to reveal the tsecrets, these injunctions being emphasized by terrorising and even by ill-treatment. Subsequently, a public ceremony took place which signified that the youths had now become duly admitted to manhood and henceforth were members of the community. It was on this occasion that the series of remarkable animal dances was performed. The bomai-maiu association had also its disciplinary and terrorist aspects; to keep up the element of fear and mystery, the members relied on Magur, a spiritual personality whose antecedents are obscure.' Part of the initiation ceremonies consisted in thoroughly frightening the novices with representations of Magur. Subsequently, they learned that this bugbear and his attendant mummers were not really ghosts, but only common inen dressed up. All breaches of discipline, or acts of sacrilage, or deeds that brought the individual into disfavour with the authorities, were puniished by Magur. In these several respects the bomai-malh association presents the familiar features of tribal secret societies elsewhere in Melanesia. BRIT1SH NEW GUINEA. On the southern coast of New Guinea a totemic system has been observed in the Mawatta (Mowat) tribe in the district of Daudai. The various clans, cassowary, alligator, dog, shark, and so on, appear to be grouped in two phratries, each with its principal and subsidiary totem. This dual grouping is recognized in the initiation ceremonies, for which two fences are erected, one fence for the crocodile-shark group, the other for the cassowary-dog group. No bull-roarers are used in the rites. The novices are told about their totems, and turtle shell miasks, representing human faces, are shown to them.2 In several instances, magical ceremonies are associated with a particular clan; the men who have sago for their totem go through performances to make the sago palm flourish, and members of the coconut totem work magic for the multiplication of their totem plant.3 Lilke the Mabuiag folk, the people of Mawatta resort to magic for the increase of the yam crop. Bull-roarers are swung when a garden is planted; without this ceremony the 1 Reports of the Cambridge Anthropological Expedition to Torres Straits, vol. vi, pp. 311 sq. According to the Rev. A.

Women may not see the mysterious instrument though they may hear its booming sound. We are not told whether those who perform this ceremony are masked anld whether they must have the yam for their totem. Initiation ceremonies (mogurm) take place at puberty, but they seem at present not to be very closely connected with the totems. Boys are said to know all about their totems before initiation.' West of Daudai and at the mouth of the Mai-Kasa live the Bugilai, the remnant of a much larger community which was forced eastwards by the savage Tugeri. The Bugilai were first visited by the late James Chalmers. They possess a totemic systemh as yet inadequately described. It is, perhaps, of some significance to learn that at the initiation of their young men " they practice sodomy, but not bestiality, as some other tribes do."2 Still further west, on the Bensbach River, which marks the boundary between British anid Dutch New Guinea, there is a totemistic tribe, the Toro, with bull-roarers and initiation ceremonies at manhood.3 In Dutch New Guinea, but close to British territory, the Kaya-Kaya or Tugeri have a well developed system of totemic clans. Here there are men's houses where all the male inhabitants of a village live and sleep, and, in addition, special resorts for the bachelors, who stay in them during the day. We may suspect, on the analogies elsewhere, that these houses were once restricted to the several clans. Initiation is now a communal festival, bringing together the inhabitants of several neighbouring villages. On such occasions there are many dances in which the performers wear masks and represent animals. The Tugeri anthropomorphize the bull-roarer as Sosom, a mythical giant, who kills the novices but brings them again to life.4 A very elaborate system of age-classes for both sexes exists among the Tugeri. The passage from a lower to a higher class is always the occasion for a feast accompanied by dancing. Each grade has its distinctive badges. Amongst the males, the first grade includes all boys up to adolescence. When the first signs of puberty occur the lads take up their abode in the bachelor's hall.5 It is probable that the several age-classes of the Tugeri are definitely associated with the secret initiation ceremonies, as is the case with the Elema tribes of the Papuan Gulf. Returning to British New Guniea, we meet an extensive totemic system on Kiwai Island, off the mouth of the Fly River. In Iasa, the largest village of I Frazer, op. cit., vol. ii, p. 34. 2 J.

Clans an,d Kiwai, there are sixteen dwellilngs, each occupied by a single clan. Some of the clains appear not to have houses in the settlement, and occasionally a few clans may have more' than one habitation. The men enjoy a room to themselves at each end of these communal structures-an interesting illustration of architectural adaptation to new social needs. The Iasa people are agriculturists, and their initiatory ceremonies reflect their economic environment. On such occasions there are secret rites to ensure plentiful crops; bull-roarers are swung and shown to the novices: the performers are decorated and wear headdresses of cuscus skin. It does not appear that these magical performances are now limited to particular clans; but this may fairly be presumed to have been once the case. A system of age-classifications probably exists, We are told of a certain mask worn by men at the last stage of initiation, when some of the candidates are nearly forty years old. The maskers are called eboro, or spirits; women and children are terribly afraid of them.1 In the Elema district, which stretches from the Alele River on the west to Cape Possession on the east, it appears that at least somne villages are divided into clans, each with one or more totems (ncdlare), representations of which are exhibited outside the club houses (eravo, elaro, erabo).2 These structures, among the Toaripi or Motumotu of Freshwater Bay, and probably among the other Elema tribes, are occupied in every instance by a single clan. Boys undergoing initiation are confined in the upper story.3 Initiation rites exist among the Toaripi. According to Mr. Chalmers, the tiparu or bull-roarer is only seen by men at manhood, and large quanltities of food must first be provided for the directors of the ceremonies. At such a time all the women and young children leave the village lest they hear the bull-roarer and die. Masked men who, according to Chalmers, are called oioi or spirits, enforce the taboos (safu) on the coconuts, sometimes executing an offender on the spot. Their masks are made of native cloth stretched on a wicker framne. The cloth is whitened with lime and painted in various colours to represent a human face. The oioi run and dance through the village swiniging heavy sticks and frightening women and children.4 The oioi of the Toaripi would seem to be identical with the harihu,5 among the Elema tribes generally. The latter name is applied both to the individuals composing the organization and to the masks they wear. Their chief duty at the present time is the protection of garden produce by taboos, which last till the crop is ripe for gathering. When the fruit is fit to eat the harihtt inform the chief, who 1 Reports of the Cambridge Anthropological Expedition to Torres Straits, vol. v, pp. 189 sqq., 218 sqq.; J.

Then the entire village join in a great feast, only the harihqt, who remain in the clubhouse, holding aloof. The taboos are supported, apparently, by sanctions, both human and divine, since an offender, shLould he escape the hands of the harihn, would certainly perish from contact with the spiritual power (vada), which invests the taboo sign. Novices during initiation in the eravo learn that the harihu are human beings and not spirits from tlhe bush. Any woman approaching a harihu would be killed, and children mercilessly beaten. When the maskers make their appearances they always come in from the bush side of the village, and for some time previously they live in a shelter near by, where they are visited by a few old men. After each visitation of the harihu, their masks are burnt.' There seems good reason for believing that the harihu is now an association of individuals from the various clans, local groups of which have settled in the different villages. Each Elema village has its own harihu, the members never appearing simultaneously in neighbouring communities. The mask of each individual harithu is said to differ from all others. The owner's clan badge is often worked upon the mask, although it is not perhaps absolutely necessary that this should be so. Probably the badges are also used to decorate the clan clubhouses. These several features recall the situation among the Western Islanders of Torres Straits, where most of the kwod belong to the several clans, and where also it is customary for the members of a clan to wear some disting,uishing emblem of their totem. The muasked dances forming a part of the agricultural rites in Yam and Mabuiag present a close similarity to the harihu performances, but in Torres Straits the dances have a purely magical purpose-to make the plants grow. The dancers, unlike those in New Guinea, do not serve as a native constabulary. But if the harihu members were originially regarded as the special representatives of the several clans, each of which was supposed to exert a magical power over the crops, one can understanad how the growing requirements of social and economic life might readily convert a magical ritual into such a quasi-judicial procedure as is found among the Elema of British New Guinea. According to the researches of Dr. Seligmann the settlements of the Western Papuo-Melanesians in New Guinea begin at Cape Possession and extend eastwards along the coast to Orangerie Bay. Among the Roro-speaking tribes which border on the Papuans of New Guinea at Cape Possession, the harihu reappear under the name of kaivakulnu.2 The custom, at least in its present form, has probably been introduced from the Elema tribes of the Gulf. The kaivaleukl are less dreaded here than their Elema counterparts, since there is a recognized form of punishment for men caught breaking the taboos of the crops. The kaivakuku cannot impose 1 After the dulkduk disappeir their house in the bush is burned, and the dresses they have worn are destroyed. " Great care is taken to destroy everything they have touched, the canes and cltubs being burned every day by the old men" (H. H.

In this respect the rule is the same among the Elema tribes. The right of belonging to the kativaknk is hereditary. The association has been found only in two or three Roro villages and in these appears to be decadent. Thus at Waima now there are only five members whereas formerly there were twenty. The settlements in Waima, most of which are local groups of different clans, number about twenty'; accordingly we may believe that the kaivakttku once represented the several clans. Such a conclusion is strengthened when we learn that clan badges or 5aac (oioi ?) are represented on the kaivakukt ma,sks.2 The marect or clubhouses throughout this region belong to the local groups of each clan found in the different villages. The badges of the clan are carved on the posts of these structures.3 Each clan likewise hbad its special marea for the puberty rites which, though now obsolete, must have been originally clan ceremonials. Yet the close contact of the several clans in a village came gradually to be reflected in the initiation ceremonies. Thtus at Waima, all youths, regardless of their clan affiliations, were confined together in one marcea, each of these structures in turn being the scene of initiation.4 The Mekeo-speaking tribes, the Biofa and Vee, dwelling further inland behind the Roro peoples, are also divided into exogamnous clans, usually comprising several local groups settled in the various villagyes. A few villages consist of one clan only. Each of the original clans possessed, and each local group of every clan should still possess, at least one ntfuc or clubhouse. There has been frequent contact between Mekeo and the more easterli of the Elema tribes; to this fact Dr. Seligmann attributes the adoption of certain Elema customs, notably that of the hariht (haivakuku).5 Further to the east, among the Motu and Koita tribes in the neighbourhood of Port Moresby, the clan system is in evident decay.6 The local groups of certain clans have become extinct and the clan badges themselves have little significance. The Koita form of the clubhouise, here styled dubu, is simply a large platform supported by carved posts. It is sacred to the spirits of the dead. There is clear evidence as to the former clan ownership of the dttbu. Most of the buildings are now raised in preparation for a special feast, esseiltially a clan ceremronial, to which however, visitors from other clans may be invited. No initiation ceremonies or secret associations are found among the Koita anid Motu. It is impossible to determine how far their numerous songs and dances,7 the majority of which are not obviously pantomimic, represent the survival of earlier clan performances. The Eastern Papuo-Melanesians, or Massim, occupy the south-eastern extremity of British New Guinea from Orangerie Bay on the south to Cape Nelson oli the north, and they are also spread over the adjacent archipelagoes.

Yet in certain parts of this area initiation rites are still celebrated, as at Bartle Bay (Southern Massim), where they distinctly show the disintegrating effects of contact with the missionaries.2 At the present day the physical development of the boy does not seem to play any part in determining when he is to be initiated. The novices sleep in a special building called by the same name, potumrra, which is applied to the clan clubhouses. There is no separation of the clans in the potuma during seclusion, but the ceremony, we are told, does not seem to exert any influence in the direction of uniting the various clan groups. Among the Northern Massim, comprisino the inhabitants of the' Trobriands, the Marshall Bennets, anid adjacent islands, though there is no initiation, the boys at about puberty are required to sleep in a separate building, which is shared by members of all the clans. The children are told to what totem they belong at a fairly early age; indeed, it seems that their parents explain the privileges and prohlibitions attaching to clan membership as soon as the children can be expected to understand them.3 The absence of secret associations throughout this area, accordiing to the hypothesis previously set forth, would be connected with the obsolescence of the puberty rites and with the continued existence of a well defined totemic system. Among the Massim the clans have not as yet fused ilnto an iniclusive tribal organization. GERMAN NEW GuINEA. In German New Guinea the only clear traces of totenmism which Professor Frazer's extensive researches have disclosed are found among the Yabim, a tribe near Simbang on Finsch Harbour. It is probably not without significance that here there exist the men's house (lum), and secret initiatory ceremonies at which sacred flutes are played and bull-roarers are swung. The mysterious spirit who presides over the rites of circumrcision, swallowing the boys but duly vomiting thema forth on receipt of a number of pigs, is called Barlum; the bull-roarer is " the roar of the Barlum." These ceremonies, perhaps originally confined to totemic clans, are now distinctly tribal in character, since their celebration, once every twenty years, brings together all the male inhabitants of several neighbouring villages.4 The barlum ceremonies include an area along the Maclay coast from Huon Gulf to Astrolabe Bay, where they are replaced by the asa5 ceremonies. On the whole the linguistic differences presented by these coast tribes do not seem to be perpetuated in their initiation rites; barlum among the Yabim appears quite comparable to asa among the Tamo. The asa rites are thorouLghly tribal; during their celebration a general peace is proclaimed between the districts contributing I Seligmann, op. cit., p. 4; Haddon, in Science Progress, 1894, vol. ii, p. 86. 2 Seligmann, op. cit., pp. 494 sqq. 3 Ibid., p. 706. 4 0.

Sir George Rook Island (Umboi) between German New Guinea and New Pomerania, appears to be a tribal secret society, after the order of the barlnm and asa associations. MELANESIAN ARCHIPELAGO (NORTH). The ethnography of the northern islands of the Melanesian Archipelago is still so imperfectly known that we must await future investigations to determine with exactness what relationship exists between the numerous secret associations in this region and a totemic organization of society. In the western part of New Pomerania masks and secret festivals are reported from such widely separated quarters as the French Islands to the north and South Cape (Cape Balli) on the south-western coast of the island. It is worthy of note that in the islands west of Cape Balli there are mummeis who make their appearance not only at the circumcision ceremony, but also, as among the Elema tribes of New Guinea, when a taboo is to be placed on the coconuts. Throughout this part of New Pomerania the secret associations appear to comprise all,the male members of a community. Circumcision and the use of bull-roarers form characteristic features of initiation as with the natives of Kaiser Wilhelm Land. Such facts have much significance as evidence for cultural contact between the two regions.3 Of the peoples dwelling in the more central parts of New Pomerania, the Sulka now on the south-eastern coast in the neighbourhood of Cape Orford are best known.4 The tribe is divided into two exogamous groups (phratries ?) with descent in the maternal line. Each group consists of nine branches, presumably totemnic. The Sulka have many masked dances on different occasions, some possessing a well-defined totemic character and others appearing in connection with the secret association called parol, after the common mother of the mummers. Women and children believe the maskers are spirits of the dead. The parol appears to be an inclusive organization of the men with the usual terrorist activities.

Their masked dances have little secrecy. They seem to be associated on the one hand with the cult of the dead and on the other hand with agrarian rites.1 The natives of the nlorth-eastern part of the Gazelle Peninsula are familiar with two secret associations, the already notorious dukdlec7, and less known though miore importan-t inqiet.2 The organizations have no connection with each other, dnlkduk, according to Parkinson, being a comparatively recent innovation, and ingiet, the ancient and fundamental institution. Ingiet may properly be described as a tribal society or inclusive association since the majority of men belong to it. Initiation often takes place when the novice is still a child if he has a father or uncle who himself is a member and who will pay the simiall fee necessary for entrance. Generally a number of young men are initiated together; thev are taken into the bush and secluded from all intercourse with the village people. Novices receive new names and gain the privileges of the inarawot or lodge.3 From another account4 we larn that ingiet exercises various disciplinary functions which often degenerate into robbery and murder. There are several features of ingiet as set forth by different observers, indicating that the association really consists of a number of milnor groups (totemic clals ?), each with its magico-religious and dramatic ceremonies. Thus we are told that there are many ingiet societies presided over in every case by an individual who is really a magician; he is above the ordinary member anid is practically the owner of the ingiet and its secrets. His office and knowledge are usually transferred to hiis nephew, sometimes to his son or brother. For a certain amount of shell-money he may sell the secrets to a stranger who then receives the necessary instruction.5 To much the same effect Parkinson declares that only certain persons know the secrets of the ingiet; such individuals may be said to possess their ownl ingiet, whose property they are. A man who has beeni initiated into all the different ingiet enjoys a high position in native society.6 Non-initiates are called, sionifi- cantly, a mana. The " secrets " apparently refer to the preparation and renditioln of dances and the performance of magical rites. Illitiates are regarded as possessing great powers of witchcraft and are generally applied to when anyone wishes such powers to be exercised against an eneemy.7 Public magic for the good of the community is represented by dances given in the 'marawot to dispel the influence of evil spirits; these performances have a totemic character and are participated in by a number of the various ingiet associations.8 1 Parkinson, op. cit., pp. 613 sqq., 620, 631. 2 The alternative name marawot (moramora) which Parkinson (op. cit., p. 598) applies to ingiet strictly refers only to the sanctuary or lodge of the meinbers. 3Parkinson, op. cit., p. 599; George Brown, felanesians and Polynesians, Lonidon, 1910, pp. 72 sqq. 4 R.

Clans and Certain other aspects of ingiet are symptomatic of an underlying totemic organization. It is said that the society at largre is divided into (two?) classes; whether these correspond in any way to the two classes among the natives of the Gazelle Peninsula does not certainly appear.' Though no particular food, animal or vegetable, is prohibited to the people as a whole, there are certain animals, such as the pig, shark, turtle, and dog, which are tabooed to menibers of the associa- tion after initiation.2 Old members, however, are said to be less strict in observing the tabu, a circumstance which recalls the relaxation of the food prohibitions in favour of Australian elders. It seems reasonable to regard the taboos as restricted to the separate ingtiet groups, for we are told that an animal absolutely forbidden to the memibers of a given ingiet might be eaten with impunity by others who did not belong to that particular group. Images ('igiet tabctaba), of these animals are kept in a special part of the marawrot, visited only by the head of a given group. On great festival occasions the images from several sanctuaries may be brought together and exhibited to new menmbers.3 Iniqet members when sick are carried to the marawot, where certain ceremonies are performed. The bodies of ingiet men are also often laid out in the marawot before burial, and the initiates assist in the obsequies.4 The relation of the association to theriomorphie ancestor worship is still obscure. Among the aborigines of Blanche Bay, and probably in other districts, the mysteries of ingiet are connected with belief in a mysterious being, the tutana vuraksit (" the eternal man "), scarcely to be described as either ghost or god. He dwells in the forest, and enjoys the power of turning himself into a bird (Tanysiptera nipgieceps), the name of wlhich he often bears.5 It is tempting to conjecture that the creature is or is becoming a totemic deity. The dkdvedk,6 which coexists with ingiet in the Gazelle Peninsula is also found in New Lauenburg, side by side with the latter association. The traditions of New Lauenburg natives declare that the first dukduk came to the island not many generations ago. There is some reason for believing the institution in its present form to be an importation-perhaps, from the Solomon Islalnds. As with ingiet, there are very few adult males who are ilot members, though boys, too, may marawot, though incorrectly referring it to the dcukduk association (Journal of the Anthwropo- logical Institute, 1898, vol. xxvii, p. 189). 1 Brown, op. cit., p. 274. 2 Brown, op. cit., pp. 72, 77, 273 sq.; Hahl, in Nachrichten itber IKaiser Wilhelrns-Land undc den Bismarek-Archipel, 1897, vol. xiii, p. 76. 3 These images are made of stone or wood, roughly carved and painted. Many of them have human form, and all are looked upon with superstitious dread as the abode of destructive spirits (Brown, op. cit., p. 76). In Guadalcanar we meet ani identical practice, though here in connection with the exogamous classes of the community (Rivers, in Journal of the Anthropo- logical I'nstitute, 1909, vol. xxxix, p. 169). In Florida images of birds and fish, crocodiles and sharks, the sun, moon, and mten, are kept in sacred houses, which occupy a part of the sanctuary of the rmatanbala association (R. H. Codriington, The lfelanesians, Oxford, 1891, p. 94). 4 Brown, op. cit., p. 78. 5 J.

Initiation, it is said, makes men of them, for the uninitiated are laughed at and spoken of as " women." The recent descriptions of the dukduk do not throw mucll additional light on its magical and dramatic activities, though there are some close resemblances to secret or semi-secret performnances in Torres Straits anid in British New Guinea. The dukdlck is also fouLnd in the southern part of New Mecklenlburg, but does not appear to have spread far along the coasts of that island. Secret associations unrelated to dukdqnk are reported throughout the northern half of New Mecklen- burg, as well as on the adjoining islands (Sandwiclh Island, Fisher and Gardner Islands). The ceremonies are said to be connected especially with ancestor cults.' It is in this part of New Mecklenburg that we find the natives divided into exoga- miious groups with birds for their totems. There are various dances in imitation of totemic birds, and the dancers who personate the bird always belong to its totemic group.2 Finally, it may be noted that on the islands Tanga and Aneri, which lie off the south-eastern coast of New Mecklenburg, all the natives have totems which are animals as well as birds. No mani may marry a woman of his own clan. At festive gatherings of all sorts there is manifested a considerable degree of solidarity between members of the same totem clan. Many dances are performed by masked men whom the women consider to be disembodied spirits. What connection exists in this region between the totemic system and such dramatic representations must await future elucidation. There is still much to be learned.2 MELANESIAN ARCHIPELAGO (CENTRAL). The secret associations in the Northern Solomons are not well known.4 The masks found in the little island of Nissan show the inaflulence of New Mecklenburg culture. Kokorra at Buka resembles dntkduk; in the case of the rukrnlk or bugri of Northern Bougainville the resemblance extends into details. On the island of Buka and in Northern Bougainville the people are divided into two exogamous classes, named after the cock and frigate-bird, which serve as their respective crests. In Southern Bougainville and in the island(is of Bougainiville Strait a larger number of birds serve as crests, and the people who have the same crest are not named after it, but possess a separate class or clan name. In Shortland Island or Alu, a recent observer speaks of the remarkable division of the natives " into secret societies or rather into totems "-a confusioln, under the circumstances, almost pardonable. It appears that inl the different villages, where there are usually settlements of several totems sidle by side, each has its own council house and its leader, who may be also the village chief. People who speak quite different languages or dialects may belong to one and the same totem. It is not unusual, even in time of war, for persons from hostile villages to go to and fro without 1 Parkinson, op. cit., p. 641. 2 Parkinson, op. cit., p. 279. 3 Ibid., pp. 652 sqq. 4 Ibid., pp. 656 sqq.</page><page sequence="23">504 HUTTON WEBSTER, PH.D.- otern Clans and being killed, since their totem protects them. It is probable that the different totemic groups are distinguished by appropriate badges.' In the southern islands of the Solomon group the natives are divided into exogarnous classes with female descent, but the classes have become more than two in number. In Florida there are, or were, six exogamous classes, five in Savo, six in Guadalcanar, and only tbree in Ysabel. In the latter island the three classes appear to be subdivided into smaller groups, each with its totem. Possibly these subdivisions or clans once existed all over Ysabel and the other islands where exogamy is still found. The exogamous classes of one island have their recognized equivalents in the exogamous classes of the other islands. The freemasonry existing between members of the same class, though of different tribes, impressed Mr. Woodford, who refers to the fact that lnatives who belong to the same " caste" can pass freely backwards and forwards between tribes at open war.- In all the Southern Solomons each class has one or more sacred objects, which, when animals, are not generally eaten. In Florida they are called tindalo ("ghosts "), being regarded vaguely as the ancestors of the respective classes. As the latter are intermingled in the villages, though one of them generally includes more miembers than the rest in any particular district, sacrifices are offered in each village or group of villages to all the tindalo of the classes. In the island of Ysabel the sacred objects reappear as tindadho; in Guadalcanar as tindalo; in Savo as manjali. If we accept the conclusions of Dr. Rivers, the totemic system in the Solomon Islands is in a relatively late stage of development, " in which the totemns and other sacred objects, including human ancestors, are all grouped together as tindalo."3 It accords with this generalization to learn that the tindalo, all of which are endowed with mana or inagico-spiritual power, appear to be connected with the so-called secret societies in these islands, much as totems are connected with clans in other parts of Melanesia. In Guadalcanar the emblems, or tindalo, are said to be regarded with the greatest veneration by the people. They are kept by the elders, who by means of them become magicians, able to produce rain and thunder at will, to cause the growth of the crops, and make both pigs and babies healthy. A lad learns about the tindalo only after initiation. The elders guard them jealously, as " in a community where no respect whatever is shown by youth to age they are a powerful nmeans for keeping the impetuous youth in its proper place."4 It may be also noted that in Florida, and possibly in other islands, the secret associations have charge of the festival of first-fruits, when the tindalo that preside over vegetation are propitiated.5 The matambala of Florida, which Dr. Codrington regards as another form of the qattu, a secret order of wide extent 1 Carl .Ribbe, Zwei Jahre unter den Kannibalen der Salomo-Inseln, Dresden, 1903, pp. 140 sq. 2 C.

Bigo, the gathering of first-fruits, is the inaugural step in the ceremonial. On this occasion the initiated from each village make bamboo structures called tindalo, which resemble the qatu masks or hats, though larger and higher. After these have been exhibited to the wondering women and children, who believe theni to be the handiwork of ghosts, they are taken back to the lodge and burnt.' The masked members of the order, as representing the tindalo, are given to the same terrorist activities which characterize so many other secret associations in Melanesia.2 MELANESIAN ARCHIPELAGO (SOUTH). The investigationis of Dr. Rivers indicate the existence of a well-defined totemic system in the Santa Cruz group (Sanita Cruz, Reef Island, Utupua, and Vanikolo), and in one of the islands (Efate) of the Southern New Hebrides. Among the Reef islanders, for instance, we find social divisions, mata, definitely exogamous, and each with one or more animals tabooed to members of the group. The men's house or afalal is a regular feature in this region. Each social division is supposed to have its own clubhouse, as among soine of the natives of British New Guinea, but at the present time the villagers live indifferently in these houses, and do not confine themselves to one of their own division. However, " if there should be a fight, the people owning an afalau would drive out members of hostile divisions."3 As far as I am aware, no secret associations have been discovered in the Santa Cruz group,4 a circumstance which may be not unconnected with the existence there of totemism in a still vigorous state. On the other band, Dr. Rivers' researches did not reveal any decisive evidence of totemism in the Banks' and Torres Islands, anid in the Northern New Hebrides. Considering the evidence previously presented, it is perhaps significant that here "the secret societies of Melanesia appear to have reached their highest develop- ment."6 Dr. Codrington assures us that they are very numerous. " In the Torres Islands alone there are a hundred of them, and every man belongs to four or five."6 The associations are universally called "the ghosts " (o tamrate).7 In the Banks' Islands a multitude of minor and mostly local associations exist, gelnerally named after birds. No doubt many of these are modern, since there is satisfactory evidence of new foundations from time to time. It is probable, however, that where the chief association, tamnate, is powerful, all the members of the other societies belong also to the tamate and co-operate with it. Another association, 1 R. H. Codrington, The ielaniesitans, Oxford, 1891, pp. 94 sqq. 2 Codrington, op. cit., p. 98 sq.; Penny, op. cit., p. 72. 3 Rivers, op. cit., p. 165. 4 Codrington, op. cit., p. 69. 5 Rivers, op. cit., p. 173. 6 Codrington, op. cit., pp. 75 sqq. 7 This fact led Dr. Codrington to suggest a connection of the Southern Melanesian societies with the dukduuk, since in Santa Cruz a ghost is duka; and in Florida, one method of consulting the ghosts is pacuduka (The Mlielanesiants, p. 710).</page><page sequence="25">506 HUTTON WEBSTER, PH.D.-Totem Clants and distinguished by its peculiar dance, is the qat, found in all the Banks' Islanlds, but not in the nieighbourilng Torres group. The qatu and qetu, variants of the qiat, are the important societies in the Northern Newv Hebrides.' It is scarcely necessary to dwell on the totemistic features still exhibited by these organizations.2 Professor Frazer has not been able to discover any certain traces of a totemic system in New Caledonia, and doubtl has been cast upon the existence of secret associations in that island. We know, however, of the apouema, which has some resemblance to dukdmak, and makes an appearance upon various occasion-s, such as a feast of the dead.3 Further research will doubtless yield much additional information concerning this institution. MELANESIAN ARCHIPELAGO (FiJi). Among the western tribes of Viti Levu, which in traditions, language, and physical type are recognised as Melanesian, there formerly existed the ntanga association. As Mr. Thomson has recently observed,4 it is highly probable that, in at least its known form, the nanga or mbaki was a late introduction on the island. The Waini-mala tribes can name six generations since they were settled in their present home, and henice the nanga cannot have been brought in at the most more than two centuries ago. The rites exhibit an entire dissonance with the Fijian religious system. The sanctuary of the nanga association was the earthly dwelling-place of the ancestral spirits, who were represented by the elders and by some of the iniddle-aged meni. The initiatory rites were thought to bring the youths into relations with these ancestral beings. The first fruits of the yam harvest were always piled in the nanga and allowed to rot there. Just as in the ingiet of New Pomerania, sick members of the association were taken to the nanga for recovery, so funeral ceremoniies over deceased members, we may conjecture, were likewise held in this sacred place. We are told that warriors before entering on an expedition always repaired to the nanga to be made inivulnerable. Such features of the association recall those of other Melanesian organizations; it is therefore doubly significanit to learn that the ntanga was divided into two groups, the kai veisina and the kai rukuruku, which traced their descent from two old men who drifted westwards across the Great Ocean and taught the mysteries to the people.' The ceremonies of the two divisions differed only in minor respects, and they used in common the stone enclosure, each division holding its performances in alternate years. Though the members of one class were forbidden, on pain of madness or 1 Codrington, op. cit., pp. 86 sqq., 92 sqq. 2 In this connection it is interesting to learn that the name of the suqe or supwe, an association found throughout the Banks' Islands and Northern New Hebrides, is probably identical with the Motu term dubu (d and s being interchangeable). Among the Motu of British New Guinea the clan clubhouses are called dubu. 3 Jules Patouillet, Trois ans en Nouvelle Cal7donie, Paris, 1872, pp. 178 sqq. 4 B. H.

It is difficult to regard the kai veisina and the kai ruku,ruku as other than representative of the ancient Wainimala phratries, which had imperfectly coalesced in one inclusive tribal organization.' The existence of various other secret associations in the Fiji Archipelago has been recently revealed through the researches of a Catholic missionary.2 Father de Marzan describes four secret associations, of which three are said to be of ancient origin. Onie, called kai buca, ceased to exist more than a quarter of a century ago. It was found among those tribes of the interior which did not possess the mnbaki or nanga rites. Initiates were recruited only from mien who had reached the age of virility. The actors performed their dramatic ceremonies in the village, but made their preparations in the bure or men's house. The 7calou? vatt (7caou = god, vatu = stone) was so namied because initiates, when possessed by the presiding spirit, became as insensible as stone. Hence the ordinary rites of the association were celebrated when the men were to go on the warpath and desired to become invulnerable. The society called luve ni wai is said to have been simnply a dancing organization. Father de Marzan considers the fourth association, kai nbakauvadra, of recent formation, an opinion highly questionable. With our present inadequate knowledge both of totemism and secret societies in the interior of Fiji, it is impossible to determine what relationship, if ally, existed between the two institutions. CONCLUSION. The evidence from Australia and Melanesia would thus seem to indicate that what were once clan rituals confined to totem groups, with advancing culture have often been diffused among other clans than those which originally enjoyed exclusive control of them. The amalgamation of clans within this area has given rise to fraternities whose performances appear to be essentially the rituals of the commingled totem groups. Behind the structure and functions of the secret societies we can sometimes detect the structure and functions of totemic clans. It does not necessarily follow that the formation of secret associations in every case breaks up the earlier totemic grouping. The clans may still survive as social divisions, though no longer in possession of distinctively clan rites and ceremonies. The secret society and the totemic organization may coexist in a primitive community. It appears, however, that the extreme development of secret societies, 1 Professor Frazer (Totemims and Exogamy, vol. ii, pp. 145 sqq.) has discussed, on the basis of Fison's account, the so-called revival of group marriage at rites of circumcision in the nanga. Mr. Thomson thinks that Fisoii was probably wrong in holding that the circumcision rite was a propitiatory measure performed when a man of note was dangerously ill. Mr. Thomson was assured by the natives that, though offerings were made in the nanga for the recovery of the sick, every youth was circumcised as a matter of routine (The Fijians, p. 157). 2 J. de Marzan, " Sur quelques soci6t6s secr6tes aux iles Fiji," Anthropos, 1908, vol. iii, pp. 718-728.</page><page sequence="27">508 Totem Clans and Secret Associations in Attstralia and 1Jfelanesia. as in the southern islands of the Melanesian Archipelago, is to be connected with the decline of totemism as a social institution. The formation of bodies which enroll their members from all parts of the tribe, irrespective of clan ties, must contribute to the disintegration of the clan structure. Doubtless the secret society has not furnished the only factor in the situation; we need to recognize the truth that a variety of influences may react on and affect the totemic system within a given cultural area. It does not fall within the scope of the present article to summarize the more recent anthropological researches outside Australia and Melanesia which tend to set forth in ever clearer guise the various activities of primitive secret associations as dramatic, magical, funereal, and initiatory organizations. In the light of the data already presented it becomes a plausible hypothesis that such functions are connected with an originial clan totemism. The accumulating evidence from Africa and America in favour of such an hypothesis has already reached impressive proportions; but its presentation must be deferred to another time, and to another place.</page></plain_text>
