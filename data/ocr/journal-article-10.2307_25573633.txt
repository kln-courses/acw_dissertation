<plain_text><page sequence="1">A BRONZE AGE RATTLE PENDANT FROM CLOON TOWNLAND, CO. GALWAY. JIM HIGGINS Rattle pendants are small bronze objects on rings which are believed to have been attached to horse harness (and perhaps other items) and which were used both as ornaments and to make noise Less than a dozen examples are known from Ireland and most of them are unprovenanced. They are dated by the other finds associated with them to the Late Bronze Age. Recently one was discovered in Co.Galway and it and its various parallels are discussed briefly below. Rattling objects of many different shapes became very common on a variety of objects during the Late Bronze Age and Early Iron Age and they were sometimes attached to horse harness, hung from the hubs of wagons, from miniature models of vehicles or 'cult wagons' on jewellery, belts and other items. Such objects were sometimes discoid, spoon-shaped, trapezoidal, occasionally leaf-shaped with circular loops or even vaguely anthropomorphic in outline. Those under discussion are simple discs with projecting loops which are often found attached to metal rings. The range of such items is vast and some idea of the variety of forms can be seen in Demakopoulou et all and Pare2 for example. A fragmentary rattle pendant was discovered in the townland of Cloon, near Cloonacauneen, Co. Galway, by Mr.Michael Feeney of Tirellan Heights, Galway. The object was found as the result of minor clearance of topsoil near the base of a drystone wall close to a shed belonging to the finder. Clearance work for a concrete pathway led to the discovery. According to the finder it seemed as if the object had been placed between the stones at the base of the wall and as if it had been discovered previously and had been deliberately set aside in the drystone wall foundations. The artifact is a small but heavy piece of cast bronze. Roughly disc-shaped or sub-circular in outline, the object widens slightly at the point along its circumference in the area in which there was originally a suspension loop. This had been cast in one piece with the rest of the object. The object is tarnished in places and bears some polish and patination in others. The item seems to have been cast in clay or stone mould and then filed down to remove excess metal around the edges. The casting was crude and the object varies in thickness. The edges are bevelled in places and in some places they have been filed to a blunt point. Elsewhere they are slightly rounded off. Only slight traces of the suspension hoop from which the object hung now survive, being represented by a mere stump or protrusion. The area around the stump of the loop has been filed on either side (Plates 1 and 2). On the front side of the object (Plate 1) in particular, grooves and between them slight 'ledges' have been left by the finishing and filing</page><page sequence="2">222 JIM HIGGINS 0 2 ZZZHcm PL 1.

A number of these 'rattle pendants' have been found in Ireland and most of them along with that under discussion are now in the National Museum of Ireland, Kildare Street, Dublin. Rattle pendants in general have been published by Thrane (1958) in a note in Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society.4 A further note in the same journal for 1962 by Rynne has dealt with the Irish examples.5 They have also been discussed by Eogan6 and Herity and Eogan7 among others, as will be seen below. A set of three of these pendants attached through their loops to a single ring is known from Lissanode, Co.Westmeath. These were noted briefly by Mahr and an illustration of them has been published by Rynne.8 The objects were in private possession when the latter wrote in 1962. They had been found .... 'with what were loosely described as bronze stirrups or bridle-bits, long since lost'.9 There are also unprovenanced rattles from the antiquarian Perry Collection in the National Museum.10 One of these has a separate bronze ring linked through it and in two of the five samples have had their internal ring-loop worn through, seemingly through use.11 Another complete example from the George Petrie Collection is also in the National Museum.12 A third unprovenanced bronze rattle pendant in the National Museum is an old acquisition. It is unusual in that its semi-circular loop is separately made and riveted on to a sub-circular disc with two rivets with conical heads. According to Rynne 'The probability is that it was found in Ireland, but the possibility of it being a foreign discovery must not be overlooked'.13 The majority of the Irish examples apart from the last mentioned one are of similar type to those from a Bronze Age hoard of horse furniture from Parc-y-meirch, Denbighshire in Wales. This Welsh hoard has been dated to the Late Bronze Age II or Bronze Age III by Thrane and to between 650 and 600BC by Hawkes and Smith.14 As Sheppard15 pointed out in the original publication of the Parc-y-meirch hoard, the number of British examples of rattle pendants are few. They are in fact as rare in Britain as they are in Ireland. Eogan in his discussion of the Dowris Phase finds of the Late Bronze Age suggests that 'The ultimate origin of these objects probably goes back to central or west-central Europe but the type is most common in Northern Germany and Southern Scandinavia where it is typical of Period V. In that region good parallels are found for the Irish pieces.16 He cites close parallels for some of the plainer unprovenanced Irish examples and those from Lissanode, Co. Westmeath with some German examples published by Sprockhoff17 and with some of the Danish examples illustrated by Thrane18 which, 'had recently arrived or developed in southern Britain or in north Western France in the late Bronze Age'. Herity and Eogan19 include rattle pendants among a series of objects which '...rarely found in Ireland but which may have come from southern England and include penannular bracelets with coil-ended terminals, rattle pendants and "phalarae".' Recent finds of bronze rattle pendants including a group of two on a ring found in a hoard of horse gear from Uckeritz on the island of Usedom, Mecklenburg</page><page sequence="4">224 JIM HIGGINS Vorpommern in Germany. This hoard which was discovered in 1975 and included 110 bronze objects 'which probably all belonged to horse harness' has been dated the Late Bronze Age; between the 9th and the 8th century BC.20 The Cloon example is somewhat unusual in that the attachment through which the pendant was attached to some form of ring or other feature is wholly outside the circumference of the disc, but given the usual arrangement of the separately looped unprovenanced example in the National Museum mentioned above, there may have been some variety in the forms which some of these rattle pendants took. There is in fact some variation in the way in which the pendants were attached to rings in Ireland and in the Parc-y-meirch hoard from Wales, too, there is also some variation. The Parc-y-meirch rattle pendants number six in all and are linked in three interlinked links similar to the Irish ones but with sloping lines as decoration. The ways in which the links are attached to the body of the disc also vary; some of the loops are attached at right angles to the disc. A visual comparison made between the Cloon and the other examples on display in the National Museum has convinced the writer that this object is of the same general type and had the same function. The other Irish examples in the National Museum also have the same finishing and filing of the edges of the discs to a blunt-pointed 'bevel', like those of the Cloon example. The edges are, generally, very slightly thickened on all five of the unprovenanced examples in the National Museum of Ireland, and the Cloon example also has these features. The dimensions of all the Irish pendants are closely similar to the Cloon example. The Lissanode examples average 6.25 cms. in width and 6.5 cms. in length, including the loop. They average 1.5 mm. in thickness. The five similar unprovenanced examples in the National Museum average 6.9cms. in diameter and the complete examples are 7.15cms. long, including their loops. They average 2mm. in thickness. The unusual example in the National Museum with the riveted loop and semi-pointed heads to its rivets is 7cms. wide and 1mm. thick. The Cloon example is 6.1 to 6.2cms. in diameter and is 1.2 to 1.4mm. thick. Given that these last two examples both have 'different' forms of loop but that they both and all all the other examples, provenanced and unprovenanced in Ireland, are so similar in their dimensions to within millimeters of each other, the writer would suggest that the unprovenanced example with the riveted loop is also Irish in origin. Conical rivets can be paralleled widely on Irish Bronze Age objects. They are found in the centres of sunflower pins and on sheet-metal vessels for example. The rattle pendants also vary in their decoration, some have raised rims around their circumferences and their loop together, others have borders around their loops only. Some French and Scandinavian examples have small bosses in the centre. None of the Irish examples have these features. These, including the unprovenanced example in the National Museum with separately attached, riveted loop are all so close in size that despite the variation that exists in the way their loops were attached it seems most likely that all the examples found in Ireland are likely to have been made here.</page><page sequence="5">A BRONZE AGE RATTLE PENDANT FROM CLOON TOWNLAND 225 Despite its fragmentary state, the Cloon rattle pendant with its variant form of attachment loop, is an interesting and valuable addition to the Irish corpus of such objects, and is important as a Bronze Age artifact from an area from which few finds of that vintage are known. I am thankful to its finder Mr.Feeney for reporting it to me and to Mary Cahill of the National Museum for her help with this note. I am also thankful to the Museum for permission to reproduce the photographs which accompany this brief note.
