With the 1991 publication of the second vol- ume of Maus: A Survivor's Tale, Art Spiegel- man concludes his painstakingly researched and rendered chronicle of a Holocaust sur- vivor. Based on extensive interviews with his fa-</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 1669 ther conducted during the late 1970s and early 1980s, the first volume of Maus, originally published in 1986, portrayed the ultimately futile efforts of Vladek Spiegelman and his family to escape the extermination program in Poland from 1939 to 1944; picking up where the first volume ended, at the gates of Ausch- witz, the second volume (1991) dwells in terri- ble detail on the fate ofJews in the concentra- tion camps. To those readers upset by this journal's re- cent institution of film and video reviews, it will not come as good news (for those still not in the know) that the Pulitzer Prize-winning Maus, parts 1 and 2, is a comic book. Maus is more than a curiosity, however, and Spiegel- man - a veteran underground cartoonist and currently coeditor of the comic anthology magazine Raw (where most of Maus originally appeared)-has done more than merely lend a pictorial dimension to our largely text-driven discipline. Maus is a significant contribution to the field of history, not in spite of the medi- um chosen by its author, but because of it. Maus is an oral history account and also an account of an oral history. Vladek's narration is framed and often disrupted by the relation- ship between the teller and the interviewer. It is a stormy relationship, punctuated by the petty demands and dismaying unreflectiveness of a father who emerged out of a lost world and the reluctant gestures and guilt-ridden resent- ment of a son raised in its shadow. Through this dramatic linking of Vladek's story to the context of its telling, Maus opens a space for further inquiry: Art Spiegelman realizes that his efforts to record and represent his father's story threaten to muffle the experiences of others. He fears that by articulating one Holo- caust survivor's perspective he has inadvertent- ly submerged the myriad of alternative ac- counts that perished in the camps. To remedy the imbalance, Spiegelman searches for his dead mother's Auschwitz memoirs, only to learn in the closing pages of the first volume that Vladek destroyed Anja Spiegelman's jour- nals following her suicide in 1968. Maus II con- tinues Vladek Spiegelman's account of his liv- ing death in the camps, and it also chronicles Art Spiegelman's search for other voices that might fill in the blanks of his father's memory as well as subvert the primacy of that narrative. The second volume thus lends greater nuance to and "problematizes" the documentation and analysis begun in Maus I. The complete Maus haunts the reader because its most com- pelling revelation, conveyed in this personal search, is one too often lost in the historians' craft: the terrible realization that often we can- not ever truly know. Spiegelman is exceedingly self-conscious about history as a construction and troubled by the fabrication of order, the distorting of historical experience, necessitated in the crea- tion of a comprehensible narrative. Moving be- yond words to confront the representation of history in images only deepens his concern. "I feel so inadequate trying to reconstruct a reali- ty that was worse than my darkest dreams," Spiegelman confesses early in Maus I. "Maybe I ought to forget the whole thing. There's so much I'll never be able to understand or visual- ize. I mean, reality is too complex for comics. . . .So much has to be left out or distorted." Throughout the second volume, we follow Spiegelman as he searches for ways to represent the undocumented past, often interrogating assumptions that he fears crept into Maus L As we follow Art Spiegelman's visual ver- sion of Vladek's oral version of the past, it be- comes increasingly clear that the author is also endeavoring to deconstruct his construction, and in a fashion unique to the comic book: through the interaction of words and images. Shunning the sweeping compositions, fetish- ized detail, or flamboyant style that character- izes so many contemporary comics (including some of the work in Raw), Spiegelman chose a style for Maus that succinctly conveys the sense of a place and the nature of a relation- ship. In panels that average about two inches in height, Maus's drawings are precise thumb- nail sketches, unfussy in their use of black and white, concise, diminutive ... and vulnerable to being overlooked. In short, the pictures work to reduce the gap between the words and themselves; even as the drawings supply infor- mation and move the narrative forward, the simplicity-the suggestiveness-of their ren- dering heightens our participation, requiring us to contribute our own comprehension as we also continually gauge their "authenticity."</page><page sequence="3">1670 The Journal of American History March 1993 Spiegelman's strategy for visualizing the past is a constant reminder to the reader that the lines on the page are an interpretation of events that the author had to, at least in part, imagine in order to tell. What we cannot overlook, what Maus in- sists we recognize, is its depiction of the charac- ters as animals. Jews are mice, Germans are cats, Poles are pigs. But, as even a cursory glance through either volume of Maus should attest, these characters are not anthropomorphic ani- mals; they clearly are people wearing masks. The rats that terrify Anja in a cellar where she and Vladek take temporary refuge should ob- literate any confusion; to settle the question entirely, in the second chapter of Maus II Spie- gelman overtly ties masks over the faces of Art and his psychiatrist (during an extended discus- sion that confronts the hazard of constructing the archetypal survivor out of the experiences of one individual). Plain and undifferentiated, these masks convey expression through simple comic-book codes symbolizing emotions, aided by gesture and pose. The mouse, cat, and pig masks are not a gimmick: they constantly con- firm Spiegelman's self-conscious construction while, at the same time, they subvert the stereo- types of racism constructed by the Nazis. Through the interplay of words and pic- tures, Maus presents a powerful narrative of the Holocaust mediated by the awareness of how history is constructed. It is a work that constantly insists on the reader's active partici- pation: a palpable discourse is embedded in its very design. Spiegelman's sophisticated use of the comic form owes a great deal to past comic-book histories here and abroad; he has built upon the strengths and weaknesses of the counternarratives that emerged from under- ground "comix," the countertexts of Latin American and European cartoonists, and more recent experiments in autobiography (interest- ed readers may consult Joseph Witek, Comic Books as History: The Narrative Art of Jack Jackson, Art Spiegelman, and Harvey Pekar, 1989, for some sense of the range and history of these works). For those professional histori- ans who are willing to take a peek at a popular form too often characterized as superficial, Maus presents an alternative approach that openly contends with issues about the narra- tive and analysis of the past.
