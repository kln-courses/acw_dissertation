<plain_text><page sequence="1">DESIRE, AND THE ART OF DEHUMANIZATION: MACEDONIO FERNANDEZ, JULIO CORT?ZAR AND JOAO GUIMAR?ES ROSA STEPHANIE MERRIM What people write on art is an educative work and in this sense it has a right to exist. We want to give back to mankind the ability to understand that a unique fraternity comes into existence at the intense moment when beauty and life itself, brought into high tension on a wire, ascend towards a flash point, the blue tremor linked to the ground by our magnetised gaze which covers the peak with snow. The miracle. I open my heart to creation. Tristan Tzara, "Note on Art," Dada 1. 7977 Our epigraph holds out a shimmering role for the critic, as an essential agent in guiding the reception of the avant-garde work of art. Agent of the praxis - the "miracle," what we will be calling the work's quotient of desire - the critic opens hearts to the otherwise unyielding creation. Now, as exegetes of the new and experimental Latin American fiction of the 1960's and '70's, I suspect that many critics fell prey to the revolutionary fervor of those years, and succumbed to the temptation to cast themselves in a similar role, as prophets and apologists.1 Including myself in those ranks, let me therefore admit that this study issues from a rather anachronistic desire on my part, being, implicitly, a rereading of my own less than critical readings of two revered authors over the last ten years. More explicitly, after an introductory excursis into larger issues, this study will reassess with a certain sobriety which is not yet skepticism, the theoretical premises and experimental dynamics of works by Cort?zar and Guimar?es Rosa. Such a revisionary reading of these erstwhile visionary texts will uncover - as our epigraph and remarks have already intimated - their kinship with earlier avant-garde works, including those of Macedonio Fern?ndez, especially in the aspects so poignantly articulated by Guillaume Apollinaire in his poem on the French avant-garde, "La Jolie Rousse," [The Russian Beauty, which I quote in English]: We are not your enemies We who want to present you with strange mighty lands Where flowering mystery surrenders itself to the takers Where there are new fires and colors unseen A thousand imponderable phantasms Who need to be given reality We want to explore bounty's enormous land all stillness Where time is to banish to call back Pity us battling always at the limits Of limitlessness and tomorrow Pity our errors pity our sins [quoted in Poggioli 1968: n.p.]</page><page sequence="2">46 Latin American Literary Review "We who want to present you with strange mighty lands/Where flowering mystery surrenders itself to the takers." Jos? Ortega y Gasset, who, writing in 1925 had ample perspective on the various avant-garde isms,2 provided a guide to the laws of these strange literary lands in his La deshumanizaci?n del arte [The Dehumanization of Art]. As the reader will recall, this daring treatise, so eminently modern in tone, flew in the face of the realist tradition to celebrate the 'dehumanized' features of the new art, and particularly its tendencies: to avoid all "living forms;" to consider art as a game and nothing more; and the tendency towards irony as one of its essential postures (Ortega 1928: p. 23). Dehumanization itself is defined by Ortega as the complete rupture of art from its "human aspect" (ibid.: p. 32). Not only dehumanized, according to Ortega, the new art aims to dehumanize its object as well: "el arte de que hablamos no es s?lo inhumano por no contener cosas humanas, sino que consiste activamente en esa operaci?n de deshumanizar. En su fuga de lo humano no le importa tanto el t?rmino ad quem, la forma heter?clita a que llega, como el t?rmino a quo, el aspecto que destruye" [not only does the art we are discussing not contain things human, it also actively consists in this operation of dehumanizing. In its flight from the human, it concerns itself less with the ad quem, the heteroclitic point of arrival, than with the a quo, what it destroys] (ibid.: p. 34). In its "asco a lo humano," [repugnance towards the human] (ibid.: p. 42) the avant-garde art also staunchly refuses any and all claim to transcendence - which in fact Ortega asserts as its defining characteristic (ibid.: p. 70). Was the new art, as Ortega would have it, but an advanced algebra of metaphors?3 What of the "flowering mystery [that] surrenders itself to the takers?" And of that moment "when beauty and life itself, brought into high tension on a wire, ascend towards a flash point" - that is, the Miracle brought about by the work of art? Valid as Ortega y Gasset's observations regarding their non-realist tendencies may be, one can hardly ignore the fervent belief of several of the avant-garde movements, insistently proclaimed through their manifestos, in the extraordinary powers of the work of art, its ability to achieve literary and not-so-literary ends which exceed the bounds of mere art or literature: Huidobro, "Arte po?tica" [of Creacionismo], 1916: ?Por qu? cant?is la rosa, ?oh Poetas!/ hacedla florecer en el poema. [Why do you sing of the rose, oh Poets/Make it flower in the poem]. Tzara, Dada Manifesto, 1918: Every page should explode, either because of its profound gravity, or its vortex, vertigo, newness, eternity, or because of its staggering absurdity, the enthusiasm of its principles, or its typography. On the one hand there is a world tottering in its flight, linked to the resounding tinkle of the infernal gamut; on the other hand, there are: the new men. Uncouth, galloping, riding astride on hiccups. And there is a mutilated world and literary medicasters in desperate need of amelioration (Tzara 1977: pp. 7-8). Joint [Surrealist] Declaration, 1925: Surrealism is not a new means of expression, or an easier one, nor even a metaphysic of poetry. It is a</page><page sequence="3">Desire and the Art of Dehumanization 47 means of total liberation of the mind and of all that resembles it (reprinted in Nadeau 1968: pp. 240-241). Oswald de Andrade, Manifesto Antrop?fogo, 1928: A transfigura?ao du Tabu em totem. Antropofagia. [The transfiguration of Taboo in Totem. Anthropophagy.] Second Manifesto of Surrealism, 1930: I would appreciate your noting the remarkable analogy, insofar as their goals are concerned, between the Surrealist efforts and those of the alchemists: the philosopher's stone is nothing more or less than that which was to enable man's imagination to take a stunning revenge on all things, which brings us once again, after centuries of the mind's domestication and insane resignation, to the attempt to liberate once and for all the imagination by the "long, immense, reasoned derangement of the senses," and all the rest. Octavio Paz, El arco y la lira, [perpetuator of Surrealism], 1970: La experiencia po?tica, como la religiosa, es un salto mortal, un cambiar de naturaleza que es tambi?n un regresar a nuestra naturaleza original.... [Poetic, like religious, experience, is a mortal leap, a changing of our nature which is also a return to our original nature] (1970: p. 137). These are statements of what I like to think of as desire, of the desiring text, the text projecting itself into the realm of super- and extra textual possibilities with its heightened - even messianic - claims for the work of art per se or of the work's impact on the reader. What I am calling desire, for its outreaching and incomplete quality, dovetails with and magnifies Borges' definition of the esthetic phenomenon from "The Wall and the Books" ("The imminence of a revelation that is not yet produced is, perhaps, the esthetic phenomenon") and, as suggested above, takes at least two principle forms: aesthetic and pragmatic [praxis]. As yet another example of the latter, we invoke the "convulsive" beauty of a surrealist work such as Breton's Nadja, which produces "jolts and shocks, many of which do not have much importance but which are destined to produce one shock which does" (Breton [1928] 1960: p. 160). Doubtless that one shock, like an electric charge, viscerally imparts the text's message of the emancipation of the human psyche (ibid.: pp. 142-43). On a rather more academic level, we might also recall Peter Burger's remarks from his recent Theory of the Avant-Garde on praxis as a defining feature of avant-garde versus bourgeois art. B?rger argues that "[t]he avant gardistes proposed the sublation of art - sublation in the Hegelian sense of the term: art was not simply destroyed, but transferred to the praxis of life where it would be preserved, albeit in a changed form."4 According to B?rger, the new art breaks down the boundary between producer and recipient: "All that remains is the individual who uses poetry as an instrument for living one's life as best one can" (B?rger 1984: p. 53). From this and our foregoing discussion, let us now formulate a few thoughts on dehumanization and 'desire': 1. Dehumanized as the work of art may be, it may still have designs on the human condition, more constructive or reconstructive than the dehumanizing effect that Ortega y Gasset proposes. 2. To deny, as does Ortega y Gasset, the transcendence of avant-garde art is, in part, to disacknowledge its desire. 3. The</page><page sequence="4">48 Latin American Literary Review examples we have seen may allow us to surmise that the more "dehumanized" or radical the work of art, the more transcendental its goals or claims, that is, the greater its desire (here one might also think of Russian Futurist poet Khlebnikov's "Trans-Rational" poetry). It stands to reason that a radical aesthetic, rather than arising ex nihilo, will draw motivation and sustenance from a radical aesthetic program. Clearly, post-World War II Latin American narrative has inherited the avant-garde's tendencies towards radical aesthetics and radical aesthetic programs (let us think of La vida breve [A Brief Life], Tres tristes tigres [Three Trapped Tigers], Paradiso, De donde son los cantantes [From Cuba with a Song], as well as the works under study here). Yet, as Emir Rodriguez-Monegal has stated in his El Boom de la novela latinoamericana [The Boom of the Latin American Novel] (1972), establishing the precise relationship between the new Latin American narrative and the avant-garde remains an "estudio a fare" (1972: p. 60). While we cannot presume to remedy this lack, we might examine one undeniable link between the Latin American avant-garde and the New Novel, the eccentric and prescient works of Borges' mentor, Macedonio Fern?ndez.5 Macedonio's works pulsate with both dehumanization and desire. His novel on the art of the novel, Museo de la novela de la Eterna [Museum of the Novel of the Eternal] (composed 1931-38; published 1967), for example, stands as a tribute to "inverosimilitude" with its inchoate and intermittent plot, its fifty-six prologues, and its characters who flaunt their status as fictional creations. All these serve Macedonio's "desire" to impart a jolt of unreality to his readers, inciting them to experience a salutary loss of self (a sense of the "no-yo" [the non-'T], a "choque de irrealidad [clash of unreality], the "efecto de desidentificaci?n" [effect of dis-identification] as the novel forcibly transmutes them from readers to co-producers and characters. In Rodriguez-Monegal's view the"primera anti-novela de la literatura latino-americana" [the first Latin American anti-novel] Museo also shifts "el peso de la obra hacia la especulaci?n te?rica" [the balance of the work towards theoretical speculation] (1972: p. 81). The fifty-six prologues mentioned above occupy more than half of the novel and outline a reader and production-oriented program for the "good" novel of which dehumanization and desire are both the tenets, and in the second part of the work, the instruments. More than an anti-novel, or a mere museum for the anachronistic "bad" novel that he rejects, Macedonio's text explicitly presents itself as the first "good" novel. In other words, this museum/novel houses both the doctrine and the text which purports to bear out the theory. In what measure does he succeed? Both Macedonio (in the novel itself) and his critics agree that Museo fails to do justice to its own theories. As Jitrik and Lindstrom argue, albeit in other terms, the doctrine - so high flung and fraught with desire - proved unrealizable, at least for Macedonio (see Lindstrom 1981 and Jitrik 1977, passim). Dehumanization and doctrine, as Rodriguez-Monegal's comment intimated and in this reader's opinion, prevail: Museo proves to be a desiccated text overburdened with theory and stripped of human elements in order to achieve its pragmatic desires. Its heightened quotient of dehumanization and desire, sadly enough, make the work's interest largely academic.</page><page sequence="5">Desire and the Art of Dehumanization 49 "Pity us battling always at the limits/ of limitlessness and tomorrow/ Pity our errors pity our sins." The example of Macedonio's Museo affirms our initial contention that as critics we must disengage ourselves from the extravagant promises/premises of avant-garde literature and begin to look with somewhat less pity and in more literary terms at the relationship between doctrine, (dehumanization, desire), and the text - examining what is sacrificed, what is substituted and what is achieved in these works. With their conjunction of dehumanization and desire, did the avant-garde writers go out too far: do their manifestos announce ideal projects impossible for the resources of literature to achieve? To what degree and in what ways do the novels themselves bear out the manifestos (in one art critic's opinion, "Surrealist art, stripped of much of the theoretical claptrap which it calls upon to support itself, becomes nothing more than an art of nonsense").6 As heirs to the radical spirit and aspirations of the avant garde, contemporary Latin American fiction should not escape similar scrutiny. In fact, at one point in Guimar?es Rosa's own literary manifestos, the prefaces to Tutam?ia, the author accuses himself through his character and alter ego Roasao, of literary preciousness, saying: "Voce ? o das formas, desartif?cios" [You believe in form, in artifice], and "Voce, ?m vez de fazer livros verdadeiros, impinge-nos" [Instead of writing real books, you impose things on us] ([1967] 1969: p. 147). The final and double-edged question which these comments, as well as "La Jolie Rousse," beg and which will guide our ensuing discussion is: how do the literary mechanisms which the experimental writers develop in order to translate theory into practice manage to do so, and, do they stand up in the long run as art or stand out as artifice and contrivance, bearing sad witness to the overly ambitious postulates and desires of the manifestos? Taken individually, Cort?zar's Rayuela [Hopscotch] and Guimar?es Rosa's "Urna Est?ria de Amor" ["A Story of Love"] well lend themselves to the investigation of these questions by virtue of their patently self conscious, experimental and pragmatic dimensions (by this last, I mean their implications for the reader). Further, both authors have written manifestos of sorts: to reread Hopscotch in light of the Morelliana proposed in the supposedly "dispensible" chapters of the third part, or "Urna Est?ria de Amor" in terms of the ideal theory of literature advanced both by the novella itself and in the prefaces of Tutam?ia, is, quite clearly, to chart the dynamics of the relationship between a prose text and the equivalent of the avant-garde's poetic manifestos. Interestingly enough, in carrying out such an investigation, we will find an unexpected platonic impulse as the key both to the bond between manifesto and text in the individual works and, when the two works are taken together, to the relationship between Hopscotch and "Urna Est?ria de Amor," unlikely bedfellows in other contexts.7 The straining towards a generative core that we unearth from beneath the amorphous works of both authors, takes a form not dissimilar to Borges' notion of artistic pobreza or poverty, the distilled essence of things. In his "Arte po?tica" [Ars Po?tica] Borges writes that upon returning to Ithaca, "harto de prodigios" [weary with wonders], Ulysses found it humble and green, "poor and pure." "Tal es la poes?a/que es inmortal y pobre" [Such is poetry/ which is immortal and poor] approaching Plato's pure Forms, art should be a mirror "que nos devuelve nuestra propia cara" [which returns to us our own true face],</page><page sequence="6">50 Latin American Literary Review to us our own true face], reflecting our essence rather than appearances. Where Borges makes "poverty" a fundamental theme of his works, implacably exposing the universal essence behind our seemingly unique visages, Cort?zar and Guimaraes Rosa build an "impoverished" zone into their discourse. That is, within the extensive mimesis of the texts we find an "anti-mimetic" (key to the essence, not the appearance) strata which carries out the tenets of the manifestos as well as involving the reader in its discovery. Anti-mimetic in the sense just described, this zone represents a new stage in the art of dehumanization. For, rather than defiantly eschewing "living forms," it uses non-representational or experimental techniques to probe the depths of life, of the "living forms," and to reveal the "ideal" Forms postulated by the manifestos.8 Is the programmatic Hopscotch a. nihilistic work, bent on self deconstruction? All of us have enough of the lector hembra ['female' or passive reader] in us to have been seduced by Horacio and La Maga's lyrical metaphors, abstract metaphysics and amorous 'pataphysics and thus to have been somewhat wary of the Utopian literary theories of Morelli, directed at precisely those zones of our reading pleasure. Literary utopias aside, one wondered how Cort?zar could consciously sabotage what is undoubtedly his richest writing - of Parts I and II, "Del lado de all?" [From the other side] and "Del lado de ac?" [From this side] - devaluing it through the tacit comparison with the "simian poverty" advocated by the Morelliana (Part III) "donde todo vale como signo y no como tema de descripci?n" ([1963] 1970: p. 545) [where everything has a value as a sign and not as a theme of description (1967: p. 390)]. The two poles of the novel, text (Pts. I and II) versus manifesto (Part III), would appear to stand in a relationship of antagonistic opposition, not unlike that of the avant-garde manifestos and the bourgeois literature they attacked. Perhaps for these reasons, then, in Hopscotch"s first decade few critics seriously undertook to examine the consequences of interpolating the "indispensible" with the "dispensible" chapters. The resulting schism between doctrine and text only further confirmed the work's nihilistic intentions, denying it novelistic coherence in the bargain - two lacks that one might now attempt to remedy. In any case it is true that the third part disarticulates and detracts, or subtracts, from the "good" writing of Parts I and II, although the sacrifice is ultimately a meaningful one and an integral part of the novel's plan. Alfred J. MacAdam, one of the first to disclose the schematic substructure of the novel that Cort?zar's preparatory notebooks, the Cuaderno de Bit?cora [Notebook of Bit?cora], have recently confirmed, wrote: "el mundo ficticio se rompe y su cualidad cerrada se sacrifica por algo que va m?s all? de la ficci?n" [the fictional world is ruptured and its closed quality is sacrificed for something that goes beyond fiction] (MacAdam 1971: p. 116; also see Barrenechea 1983). Hopscotch's sacrifice of the closed text takes its place among the series of sacrificial triangles which structure the novel and whose paradigm is the patently allegorical tablero episode of Chapter 41 where Talita traverses a board precariously suspended between two windows to link Traveller with Horacio. As in this episode, in each triangle a female victim is "sacrificed" in order to effect the relationship of doubles between two males.9 Once achieved, the</page><page sequence="7">Desire and the Art of Dehumanization 51 relationship of doubles may also render possible the long-desired union with the sacrificial victim, and thus access to the center. For Horacio, two paths above all lead to the center: "La Maga era uno de esos caminos, la literatura era otro" (Cort?zar [1963] 1970: p. 340) [La Maga was one of those roads, literature was another (Cort?zar 1967: p. 250)]. Horacio having failed to achieve an enduring "encuentro" [encounter] with La Maga, Hopscotch itself moves towards an encounter with literature as envisioned by Morelli in that Oliveira makes Morelli his doppelg?nger. To complete the triangle Oliveira-Literature-Morelli, Hopscotch sacrifices the traditional or what it calls the "female" aspects of literature, specifically those found in Parts I and II. Emblematic of the sacrificial gesture: Horacio reading and interlinearly un-writing in Chapter 34 a passage of Gald?s, favorite author of lector-hembra La Maga. A second reading of Hopscotch interpolating the "dispensible" chapters: cements the relationship of doubles; undermines the novelistic dimensions of Parts I and II, sacrificing them and lays bare the anti-novel which lurks beneath the novel, awaiting discovery by the lector-c?mplice [reader-accomplice]. The dispensible chapters both expand and contract our understanding of Chapters 1-56. Those chapters of Part III which are not Morelliana explode Parts I and II (recalling Breton's comment in and on Nadja: "I wanted it to be ajar, like a door," p. 156), many of them supplying additional information on the original chapters which one assumed to be fixed and immutable. On the other hand, the juxtaposition of the Morelliana or doctrine allows us to glimpse the anti-mimetic strata of Parts I and II, the common ground they unexpectedly share with Morelli's proposed roman comique. While Chapter 73, the first chapter of the second reading, immediately inaugurates the subversion with its questioning of literary language, it is the Morelliana itself which uncovers the novel's latent "poverty." At various points, but particularly in the notorious Chapter 62, Morelli proposes a biological theory of character in place of the prevailing psychological or literary notion: Si escribieras ese libro, las conductas standard (incluso las m?s ins?litas, su categor?a de lujo) ser?an inexplicables con el instrumental psicol?gico al uso. Los actores parecer?an insanos o totalmente idiotas. No que se mostrar?an incapaces de los challenge and response corrientes: amor, celos, piedad y as? sucesivamente, sino que [...] Todo ser?a como una inquietud, un desarraigo continuo, un territorio donde la causalidad psicol?gica ceder?a desconcertada, y esos fantoches se destrozar?an o se amar?an o se reconocer?an sin sospechar demasiado que la vida trata de cambiar la clave en y a trav?s y por ellos... (p. 417) [If I were to write this book, standard behavior (including the most unusual, its deluxe category) would be inexplicable by means of current instrumental psychology. The actors would appear to be unhealthy or complete idiots. Not that they would show themselves incapable of current challenges and responses: love, jealousy, pity, and so on down the line, but [...] Everything would be a kind of disquiet, a continuous</page><page sequence="8">52 Latin American Literary Review uprooting, a territory whose psychological causality would yield disconcertedly, and those puppets would destroy each other or love each other or recognize each other without suspecting too much that life is trying to change its key in and through and by them... (p. 305)] This "impoverished" prescription for characters hooks up with the Ideal design also envisioned by Morelli for the novel: the novel as figura [figure], the imago mundo or transcendental whole in which crystallizes the schematic pattern underlying all the disparate fragments and where, as we mentioned above, "everything has a value as a sign and not as a theme of description."10 When read under the subversive influence of Morelli's chapters, those characters of Hopscotch such as Horacio and Maga who at first seemed so full, so anthropomorphic, become de-realized, disanthropomorphized puppets. The novel thus reduces down to a series of dehumanized "figuras" which displace each other, that is, the triangles to which we have already referred. Its female characters (Berthe Tr?pat Emanu?le-Pola-Talita), all based on La Maga or the construct of the female which she represents, comprise an almost interchangeable series for their common function of allowing Horacio access to the center (as he suggests in Chapter 56, saying: "A esa hora y con esa oscuridad lo mismo hubiera podido ser la Maga que Talita o cualquiera de las locas, hasta Pola si uno se pon?a a pensarlo." p. 391). [At that hour and in that darkness it could have just as easily been La Maga as Talita or any of the madwomen, even Pola, if one really thought about it." p. 288]. Stripped of their individual psychology by this anti-mimetic and dehumanizing x-ray, the characters assume their final form as signs or symbols, and the novel as a fictive essay, a dialogue of ideas. Despite the "impoverishment" which the doctrine thus wrests from the text, Hopscotch consciously refuses to be the even more disembodied and desiccated novel that Morelli's theory would predict. For better or for worse, Cort?zar's own 62: Modelo para armar [62: A Model Kit] or Macedonio-Morelli's Museo de la novela de la Eterna come much closer to fulfilling those dicta.11 Horacio, with a penetrating remark in Chapter 124 on the dangers of experimentalism, criticizes the anti-mimetic excesses committed by Morelli, whose characters or "monos sabios" [wise monkeys] end up nullifying: "su propia fuerza mitopoy?tica, su 'alma,' para acabar en una especie de encuentro ab ovo, de encogimiento al m?ximo, a ese punto en que va a perderse la ?ltima chispa de (falsa) humanidad"(p.559) [their own mythopoetic force, their "soul," ending up in a kind of meeting ab ovo with a maximum shrinking into that point in which the last spark of (false) humanity will be lost, (p. 398)]. A dialogue between the aspiring doubles, Morelli and Oliveira/Cort?zar, Hopscotch fuses the novel and the anti-novel purposely not fulfilling its doctrine to remain a work that is "minuciosamente antinovel?stico (aunque no anti-novelesco)" (p. 452) [minutely anti-novelistic (although not anti novelish), (p. 328)], whose characters retain their mythopoetic force. As Ana Maria Barrenechea has incisively noted: La novela de Cort?zar - como muy buena parte de la literatura contempor?nea - ofrece dos tendencias polarizadas: una hacia</page><page sequence="9">Desire and the Art of Dehumanization 53 la focalizaci?n de un modelo y otra hacia la concretizac?on que trata de apagarla sin borrarlo del todo. [...] Con su peculiar manejo de los dobles en Rayuela, Cort?zar acent?a el modelo sin renunciar a una f?bula y unos personajes, cuyos predicados los naturalizan en cierta medida... (1983: p. 828) [Cort?zar's novel - like much of contemporary literature - contains two polarized tendencies: one, the focus on a model and the other, the concretization of the model, which tries to obscure it without entirely erasing it [...] With his peculiar manipulation of doubles in Hopscotch, Cort?zar accentuates the model without renouncing a plot and characters whose predicates to a degree naturalize them...] Thus, the doctrine may subvert and sacrifice the text, rendering it radically experimental, but fails to annihilate entirely its traditional novelistic appeal. In this respect, then, rather than a saturnine work that devours its own genre, Hopscotch emerges as an experiment that mediates between essay and novel, theory and text. Nonetheless, Cort?zar appears to have aspired to carry out perhaps the most ambitious (or Macedonian) of Morelli's precepts, the final of the triangular figures: the sacrifice of the lector hembra ['female' or passive reader] who views the work as a solution rather than as a set of possibilities, and the consequent exaltation of the lector c?mplice [reader accomplice] who then becomes the author's double. "Lo que el autor de esa novela haya logrado para s? mismo, se repetir? (agigant?ndose, quiz?, y eso ser?a maravilloso) en el lector c?mplice" (p. 454) [What the author of this novel might have succeeded in for himself, will be repeated (becoming gigantic, perhaps, and that would be marvelous) in the reader accomplice, (p. 330)]. To transform the lector hembra into the lector c?mplice is to galvanize him or her to participate in the search, to jump from box to box in the hopscotch, to understand the novel as a figure and thereby in some degree to abandon the western Logos and enter a non linear or causal order. Give the reader-accomplice, Morelli urges, como una fachada, con puertas y ventanas detr?s de las cuales se est? operando un misterio que el lector c?mplice deber? buscar (de ah? la complicidad) y quiz? no encontrar? (de ah? el copadecimiento), [...] En cuanto al lector-hembra, se quedar? con la fachada... (p. 454) [something like a fa?ade, with doors and windows, behind which there operates a mystery which the reader-accomplice will have to look for [...] and perhaps not find [...] As for the female reader, he will remain in the fa?ade" (p. 330)] The insistently episodic structure of the narration (which Morelli sees as a photo album, a gestalt), its Table of Instructions for a hopscotch reading or what is explicitly termed a "search," the absurd or aphoristic nature of several of the dispensible chapters, the lack of a definitive ending - that is, all of the work's most showy innovations or artifices - extend a hand to the</page><page sequence="10">54 Latin American Literary Review reader-accomplice with the transcendent intention of "simultaneanizing" him or her, "puesto que la lectura abolir? el tiempo del lector y lo trasladar? al del autor" (p. 452) [provided that the reading will abolish reader's time and substitute author's time" (p. 329)], as well as the messianic desire to contribute to the reader's "mutation, displacement, alienation, transportation" (p. 328). Towards this end Cort?zar deploys what we can understand as the negative space of the text, which much as he may deny it remains a literary maneuver like any other, stating, "Todo ardid est?tico es in?til para lograrlo: s?lo vale la materia en gestaci?n, la inmediatez vivencial (trasmitida por la palabra, es cierto, pero una palabra lo menos est?tica posible; de ah? la novela 'c?mica', los anticlimax, la iron?a, otras tantas flechas indicadoras que apuntan hacia lo otro," p. 454). [All artistic tricks are of no use in obtaining it: the only thing worth anything is the material in gestation, the experiential immediacy (transmitted through words, of course, but the least aesthetic words possible); this is where we get the 'comic novel,' anticlimaxes, irony, so many other directional arrows pointing towards the other thing (p. 329)]. Animating the negative space of the text, marshalling its arrow-like features to point the reader towards the figurai space, a space beyond - thus Hopscotch confesses its pragmatic desires, by means of which the failed encounter between Horacio and Maga will be reborn as the achieved and always renewable encounter between reader and text. The above dimensions of Cort?zar's literary project confirm Merleau Ponty 's suggestive assertion that "the lack of a sign can also be a sign." (quoted in Iser 1980: p. 179). Such an absent sign or complementary space assumes as prominent and problematic a role in the works of Cort?zar (fervent disciple of surrealism, as amply documented in Garfield 1975) and, we shall see, Guimaraes Rosa, as it did in the avant-garde. Conceivably, Hopscotch's excesses owe less to its nihilistic or destructive tendencies, than to its ambitious reconstructive designs on the reader, for whom understanding the novel's inherent poverty ideally comprises a step towards a larger, but ineffable, realization which extends beyond the reaches of the text. To venture a personal judgment, we might suggest that the extraordinary weight placed on extra-textual realization by Morelli's doctrine and left to the experimental mechanisms of the text to achieve, or not to achieve, constitutes an undue burden on the negative space of the text, one which may well bespeak artifice rather than art. The hermeneutic (to use Guimaraes Rosa's own term) thrust towards the non-sensical or "o nao senso" which runs through the four prefaces of Guimaraes Rosa's last work, Tutameia, echoes Hopscotch's desires both for the reader and the negative space of the text, transforming them into the keypin of a dehumanized literary program of "subtraction." "O livro pode valer pelo muito que n?le nao deveu caber" ([1967] 1969: p. 12) [roughly, as with all our translations of Guimaraes Rosa: The book may derive its value from everything it needn't contain]: this aphorism caps off "Aletria e hermen?utica" [Vermicelli and Hermeneutics], the preface which most directly explicates the aesthetics of "o n?o senso." Both the title of the preface, with its diaphoric juxtaposition of disparate elements, and the aphorism itself as a technique, with its illuminating charge, purport to reify the preface's message, to wit: that literature, through the aesthetics of "subtraction," should provoke a crossing {travessia) into the</page><page sequence="11">Desire and the Art of Dehumanization 55 realm beyond logic and "captar o incognosc?vel" (ibid.: p. 5) [capture the unknowable]. Rather than competing with history, the short story should aspire to the condition of the even briefer anecdote, a catalyst which like the joke "ensancha os planos da l?gica, propondo-nos realidad superior e dimens?es para m?gicos novos sistemas de pensamento" (ibid.: p. 3) [expand the planes of logic, offering us a superior reality and dimensions for magical new systems of thought]. In Guimar?es Rosa's view, a stylistics of "subtraction," characterized by negation, antinomy, oxymoron and "o n?o dito" [what isn't said], endows the anecdote with the metaphysical force to lead to or to incarnate "o nada residual" (ibid.: p. 5) [the residual nothingness]. Such a desire, according to Guimar?es Rosa, also motivates his famous neologisms, as described in the second preface, "Hipotr?lico" [Hypotrelics, an invented word] and underlies the heady jokes of the third, "Nos, os tremulentos" [We, the Tremulous], as well as the author's own literary production, whose genesis he attributes to a trance or para-psychological state. In its various aspects, then, the aesthetics of "o n?o senso" approach those of the Zen koan-riddle, by means of which one ideally attains, "o satori, ilumina??o, estado aberto as intui?oes e reais percep?oes (ibid.: p. 8) [satori, illumination, a state open to intuitions and real perceptions]. Like Riobaldo in Guimar?es Rosa's masterpiece, Grande Sert?o: Veredas [published in English as The Devil to Pay in the Backlandsl. Guimar?es Rosa drinks from every spring: the philosophical synchretism or harmonizing of the most varied currents of Eastern and Western thought encountered in the novel also inform his theory of literature.12 Thus Guimar?es Rosa's subtractive aesthetics of "o n?o senso," with their sense of literature and illumination, find their analogue in the Platonic conception of art set forth in the prefaces to Tutam?ia as well as his novella, "Urna Est?ria de Amor," to which we now turn. Both Tutam?ia's central preface, "Sobre a Esc?va e a D?vida" [On Toothbrushes and Doubt] and "Urna Est?ria de Amor" set forth an ideal notion of literature, in the Platonic and conventional senses of the word. Stating in "Sobre a Esc?va e a D?vida," "Meu duvidar ? da realidade sens?vel aparente - tal vez so um escamoteio das percep?oes ([1967] 1969: p. 148)" [My doubting is of apparent, sensible reality - perhaps only of the optical delusions of sight], the narrator of this parable of a mango tree introduces the Platonic dichotomies between illusion and reality, the real and the ideal, which dominate Guimar?es Rosa's theory of literature. According to his Tio C?ndido, literature must embody the second or ideal component of each pair; the narrator-writer himself, however, has his doubts: "Tudo se finge, primeiro; germina aut?ntico ? depois. Um escrito, ser? que basta?" (ibid.: p. 149) [Everything is illusory at first; the true germination - that comes later. To write, could it be enough?]. When we read Guimar?es Rosa's works in reverse order, "Urna Est?ria de Amor" offers an affirmative response to these doubts. One of three Corpo de Baile [Corps de Ballet] novellas which treat aesthetic phenomena {"Cara De-Bronze" [Face-of-Bronze] deals with poetry, "Recado do Morro" [Message from the Hill] with song), "Urna Est?ria de Amor" portrays the humble popular tale such as the romance or the literatura de cordel [stories on a string], in exalted and philosophical terms. As depicted in the novella, the popular stories issue from an unidentifiable or ideal source</page><page sequence="12">56 Latin American Literary Review and evoke in their listeners a special saudade [nostalgia], Guimaraes Rosa's personal term for platonic reminiscence: "As est?rias reluziam as v?zes um simples bonito, principalmente as antig?s, as j? sabidas, das que a gente tern em saudades, at?" ([1956] 1972: p. 134) [At times the stories sparkled with simple beauty, principally the ancient ones, the ones we already knew and which even held reminiscences for us]. The reference to light, encountered as well in other parts of the novella, recalls Plato's "Simile of the Cave" (explicitly referred to in Tutameia, p. 4), and suggests the story's capacity to transport its audience from illusion to a higher reality, as do those of storyteller Joana Xaviel: "Quando garrava a falas as est?rias, desde o alum?io da lamparina, a gente recebia um desavisado de ilus?o..." (ibid.: p. 134) [When she set herself to telling the stories, illuminated by the lamplight, we received a disabusal of illusion]. Stories effect the same magical transformations in their tellers as in their listeners, as here where they enable Joana to shed her time-worn shell and display her essential inner beauty: "Joana Xaviel virava outra. No clar?o da lamparina, tinha hora em que ela estava vestida de ricos trajes, a cara demudava desatava os tra?os, antecipava as belezas, ficava semblante" (ibid.: p. 130) [Joana Xaviel became another person. In the radiance of the lamplight, for a time she was dressed in rich clothing; her face changed, unchained of lines, it anticipated beauty, dissembled]. Finally, we see that, similar to the anecdote, what endows these stories with their superhuman powers is the ideal and not apparent truth hidden deep within them: "O velho Camilo instru?a as letras,... nao constru?a a cara dos outros no esp?lho. So se a gente guardasse de retentiva cada p?-de-verso, ent?o mais tarde era que se achava o querer solerte das palabras, vindo de longe, de dentro da gente mesmo" (ibid.: p. 129) [Old Camilo taught the lines,... he didn't construct the faces of others in the mirror. Only if the listeners retained in their memories every foot of verse would it be that later they found the wise intention of the words, coming from far away, from inside the very person]. Camilo, it bears repeating, "nao constru?a a cara dos outros no esp?lho" [didn't construct the faces of others in the mirror]. This remark, a powerful "reminiscence" of Borges' pobreza, invokes Guimaraes Rosa's own Platonic and anti-mimetic theory of representation. Returning now briefly to the prefaces of Tutam?ia, let us formalize the interrelated tenets of his aesthetics: 1) Hermeneutics, or interpretation: the world as text; the text as world: "A vida," writes Guimaraes Rosa, "tamb?m ? pra ser lida. Nao literalmente, mais em sua suprasenso. E a gente, por enquanto, so a le por tortas linhas" ([1967] 1969: p. 4) [Life is also to be read. Not literally, but in its suprasense. And we, for the time being, always read it through twisted lines]. 2) "Poverty:" To correct this misreading of text and world, countering the "tortas linhas" with a vision of the center, (Tio C?ndido tells us) "Tem-se de redigir urn abreviado de tudo" [You must compose an abridgement of the whole], and Ideal text, a generating center. The mangos of Tio C?ndido's tree, "sempre total ?vo e c?lculo, sement?, p?lpas, sua carne de prosseguir, terebentinas (ibid.: p. 149)" [always a total egg-like 0 and quotient, seed, pulp, its flesh to persevere, turpentennial] which are his</page><page sequence="13">Desire and the Art of Dehumanization 57 metaphor of God or the Platonic Form, serve as an emblem of the Ideal "poverty" of the text. 3) Mimesis: only an anti-mimetic representation, Guimar?es Rosa's "teor?a da alma" as presented in the final section of "Sobre a Esc?va e a D?vida," can reveal one's true or ideal mirror image. Quoting Tolstoy, the Brazilian author declares: "Se descreves o mundo tal quai ?, nao haver? em tuas palabras sen?o muitas mentiras e nenhuma verdade" (ibid.: p. 160) [If you describe the world just as it is, your words will contain nothing but lies and no truth at all]. Guimar?es Rosa's aesthetics of subtraction, as described above, presumably serves this theory. 4) Pragmatics: in the last analysis all of these elements implicate the reader, with the didactic hope of contributing, to use Guimar?es Rosa's characteristic term, to his or her travessia or crossing from illusion to truth: "urn livro, a ser certo, d?via de se confei?oar da parte de Deus, depor paz para todos, virtude de enga?ar com um clareado a fantasia da gente, empuxar coragens. Cabia de ir descascando o feio mundo morrinhento..." (ibid.: p. 164) [a book, a real one, should be fashioned by the hand of God, sow peace for all, its virtue - to beguile by enlightening the imagination, by jogging our courage. The task is to peel away the ugly weakened world]. The contrast between the doctrine's notions of subtraction, its luminous conception of the story, its concern for the reader's edification, and the confounding textual reality which awaits us in works such as "Urna Est?ria de Amor," could hardly be more dramatic. "Urna Est?ria" affronts the reader with the extensive mimesis of its protagonist's thoughts and an almost impossible ambiguity. First of Guimar?es Rosa's tangled sert?o-texis and testing ground for Grande Sert?o: Veredas, "Urna Est?ria" graphically reproduces the "tortas linhas" of the world, defying one to read them. As this last remark, as well as the link with Grande Sert?o: Veredas suggests, "Urna Est?ria" both enacts and details the rich and philosophical hermeneutic situation so central to Guimar?es Rosa's concerns: how to see through the convoluted sert?o or false paths of life, to reach the central veredas [paths] with their peace and truth - an act of interpretation and understanding. Prompted by premonitions of death on the next boiada [oxen-drive], "Urna Est?ria's" protagonist Manuelzao undertakes an examination of himself and his circumstances; the novella structures itself around his inconclusive readings. Or, in equal measure, his m/sreadings. We know from Sagarana that the characters of Guimar?es Rosa's literary world tend to divide into two camps, 1) positive, intuitive characters allied with the forces of nature, e.g. innocent country people of any ilk; 2) problematic, sometimes negative characters, alienated from nature and considering themselves superior to it by virtue of their reason (see Merrim 1983). A problematic character himself, Guimar?es Rosa's typical "divided man," Manuelzao contemplates and analyzes the landscape of characters who present themselves, like object lessons, at the festa. This process often results in his negative judgments of them, centering on the first group, of rustic intuitive characters, and particularly on the time ravaged storytellers, Joana and Camilo. When unable to see beyond their appearances to the couple's noble essence, Manuelzao rejects and condemns them. At the same time, he exalts a character of the second</page><page sequence="14">58 Latin American Literary Review type, the rich landowner Seu Vilam?o, foolishly taking him as his model. A register of these perceptions, the text becomes in part a map of his misreadings, drawn by a highly unreliable narrator and narrated through the double-edged style indirect livre. Though wholly unreliable, Manuelz?o is not wholly incorrect in his perceptions, which ever-contradictory, swing from epiphanies of sorts to the further perpetuation of self-delusion. Like Riobaldo in Grande Sert?o: Veredas, he is an oracle: the truth speaks through him but he knows not what he says. Until the very end of the novella, when Manuelz?o recognizes Camilo as his possible double, each of the protagonist's authentic realizations fades away, seeming to leave no trace. In this and other of its problematic aspects, "Urna Est?ria" represents an existential rewriting of the popular and formulaic literatura de cordel (stories displayed on strings in the marketplace) from which it takes its subject, the est?ria. According to Candace Slater, the cordel stories are structured around trials, challenges to which the character responds in a way that is clearly correct or incorrect, leading to a just reward or punishment (Slater 1982, pt. II, "Theoretical Approaches"). Over the six-step course of the cordel tale, an initial equilibrium is disrupted, put to various tests, and finally restored. "Urna Est?ria," which explodes the similar folkloric pattern found in Sagarana, internalizes and problematizes the cordel model. While each new object of Manuelz?o's meditation represents a trial or challenge, and the protagonist's thoughts his response, we can see that in the novella all concrete touchstones are removed: "Urna Est?ria" replaces the initial harmony, explicit events, clear-cut moral judgments and tangible reprisals of the literatura de cordel with the unshakable presence of death, with ambiguous characters, inconsistent blinker readings and abstract reprisals. Both challenge and correct/incorrect response take place within the character himself, in his mind, their rhythm one of self-imposed philosophical questioning. In withholding judgment, the author ensures the narration's unreliability, heightening the difficulties of interpretation. As we began by remarking, and as the above discussion further confirms, "Urna Est?ria" places almost insuperable barriers in the reader's path. In this hermeneutic exercise, reader's and character's roles fuse as both attempt to decipher the tangled material. Moreover, the unreliable narration forces us into an ironic as well as active interpretive stance. As oracles, Guimaraes Rosa's characters are necessarily bad readers, only sporadically capable of reaching the veredas in the sert?o: their misreadingi often bear tragic consequences (as with Riobaldo's misapprehension of Diadorim in Grande Sert?o: Veredas, which prohibited their union); the works serve as cautionary tales on the dangers of misreading. What is to keep us from falling into the same trap? Is the relationship between theory and text largely arbitrary, only ideal? The channel between theory and text, open-ended as it proves to be, may well lie in "Urna Est?ria's" built-in "poverty," the cantigas, songs, and, most of all, the digressive or interpolated stories encrusted in the text which serve as vehicles for its basic message or truth. The several cantigas and songs that appear in the novella, for example, organize themselves into series, variants of a few central invariants, each of which articulates an essential feature of Manuelz?o's situation: Travessia (to</page><page sequence="15">Desire and the Art of Dehumanization 59 death), Becoming, Love, and so forth. On a larger scale, "Urna Est?ria" ultimately shows as well as tells us of the est?ria's ideal function. Let us mention the central interpolated story, "O Boi Bonito" [The Pretty Ox], Old Camilo's last tale of an epic crossing which leads to the primal alliance between humankind and nature, with its message, "aqui todo o mundo carece de ser valente" (p. 185) [here, everyone must be courageous], purifies and projects Manuelz?o's own quandary onto an unambiguous allegorical plane. The message cyphered into the tale rights the protagonist's reading of his own condition and conceivably our reading as well. After hearing the tale, Manuelzao embraces his son, joyfully announces the boiada, and enters into the spirit of the festa abandoning his logical strictures and allying himself with nature and intuition. Now, limited as these "poor" gestures (cantigas, stories, songs) may appear, they bear extensive implications for Guimar?es Rosa's oeuvre. We can see that it is the popular or folkloric elements, in Guimar?es Rosa's system the allies of nature, which impart the essence of the work. These popular elements, in both "Urna Est?ria" and Grande Sert?o: Veredas embedded within the narration of a 'non-natural' or culto [educated] narrator, thus constitute a much-needed corrective gesture towards his unreliable narration. Such a corrective gesture subtly provides the readers with the keys to rectify both the narrator's and their own readings, therein mitigating the interpretive obstacles. In the measure, then, that these popular keys, "urn abreviado de todo" [an abridgement of the whole], condense the "truth" of the text, they endow it with a dynamic of expansion and contraction which, while still maintaining the rich explorations of the unreliable narrator, succeeds in giving form to the platonic movement postulated by the doctrine. Finally, it is worth noting that the presence of this essential contracted zone in Guimar?es Rosa's earlier extensive works links them with the later more elliptical stories written after Grande Sert?o: Veredas, thus embodying the notion of "subtraction" outlined in Tutam?ia. But what of the Ideal pragmatics also suggested by Tutam?ia and "Urna Est?ria"? One issue we have strategically left to the end is the incomplete or encoded nature of these revelations, which one might understand as the final link between text and doctrine. "Sempre que algo de importante o grande se faz, houve um silogismo inconcluso..." [Whenever anything important or great is accomplished, there has been an incomplete syllogism], writes Guimar?es Rosa in Tutam?ia (p. 11). As proof of this statement, the other central story recounted in "Urna Est?ria," Joana Xaviel's unusual tale of "A Destemida" [The Fearless Woman], lacks an ending, which fact shocks and preoccupies Manuelzao: "Mas essa est?ria estava errada, n?o era t?da! Ah, ela tinha de ter outra parte - faltava a segunda parte? A Joana Xaviel dizia que n?o [...] Mentira del?? A ver que sabia o resto, mas se esquecendo, escondendo" (p. 134) [But this story was wrong, it wasn't the whole thing! Ah, it must have another part - was it missing its second part? Joana Xaviel said it. didn't have [...] A lie? I bet she knew the rest, yet was eliding it, hiding it]. Any endings or answers, he realizes at the very end, must come from him, as listener/reader of the tale. Both the allusive cantigas and allegorical stories, then, demand the same response as do koans. Vehicles of Guimar?es Rosa's anti-mimetic intentions, as its indirect but true mirror</page><page sequence="16">60 Latin American Literary Review image they paradoxically proclaim the text's truth like a herald and cypher it like an oracle (Kermode 1979: p. 47). For their veiled meaning, interpretive challenge and enlightening reward, then, we may well equate these elements with Biblical parables. Parables - moral tales or hermeneutic riddles - enclose a secret message accessible only to the select but unyielding to the outsider. The open-ended parable event is complete only when a satisfactory interpretation is reached (ibid.: p. 24); and their interpretation illuminates the reader as well as the text (ibid.: p. 40). "He did not speak to them without a parable," said Mark of Jesus. Much could be said of Guimaraes Rosa, who provides provocative clues but refuses direct 'answers' regarding the text or the world, guiding but not defining the interpretive path from the "tortas linhas" [twisted lines] to the revelation beyond. 13 With their channeling of desire, then, like Cort?zar's Hopscotch, Guimaraes Rosa's works stand as the possible space of revelation but the revelation unrealized. Art or artifice? Both Cort?zar and Guimaraes Rosa, we have seen, rely heavily on the negative space of the text to complete the doctrine's prescription for the reader. However, whereas Hopscotch presumes to have the ruptures with logic and causality built inte the work's experimental design achieve the emancipation of the reader from the western Logos, "Urna Est?ria's" project reduces down to an essentially textual task, with the reader achieving a crossing of sorts by resolving choices planted by the work. Less messianic, perhaps, less demanding of the negative space, Guimaraes Rosa's early works remain - to use terms so bound up with the "boom" and the Sixties - more "readerly," Cort?zar's more "writerly." This we can attribute in part to Cort?zar's links to surrealism, with its "convulsive" beauty, and Guimaraes Rosa's to popular literature, with its didacticism and interpretive challenge. Yet both author's works, by virtue of the dialectic between mimesis and "poverty," manage to fulfill their doctrines without sacrificing their mythopoetic force, whose absence would relegate them to the confines of the purely dehumanized work (and here we might think again of Macedonio's Museo, Cort?zar's 62, even of Sarduy's De donde son los cantantes). Without hazarding further judgments, then, let us conclude by proposing the foregoing criteria: doctrine versus text, positive versus negative space (and "desire"), dehumanization versus mythopoetic force, as parameters in exploring the question of art or artifice, dehumanization and desire, in these and other avant-garde works throughout time. Princeton University NOTES 1 In this connection, one might well mention Carlos Fuentes' La nueva novela hispanoamericana (Mexico: Joaqu?n Mortiz, 1969), which might profit from a re-visionary rewriting.</page><page sequence="17">Desire and the Art of Dehumanization 61 2 By way of examples, Ortega discusses or mentions Debussy, Mallarm?, Proust, Pirandello, cubism, ultra?smo, expressionism, what he calls "suprarrealismo," and the "infrarrealismo" of Ram?n G?mez de la Serna and Joyce. 3 Naturally, Ortega's notion and term of "dehumanization" have not escaped criticism. Guillermo de Torre, for example, in his Literaturas europeas de vanguardia (Madrid: Caro Raggio, 1925, pp. 279-80) finds the term an exaggeration, since art can never dispense entirely with a human dimension. "Pure poet" Jorge Guillen magnifies this sentiment in his "Lenguaje de poema: Una generaci?n," (in Lenguaje y poes?a [Madrid: Revista de Occidente, 1962: 245]) saying, "Pero un poema 'deshumano' constituye una imposibilidad f?sica y metaf?sica, y la f?rmula 'deshumanizaci?n del arte,' acu?ada por nuestro gran pensador Ortega y Gasset, son? equ?voca. 'Deshumanizaci?n' es concepto inadmisible, y los poetas de los a?os 20 podr?an haberse querellado ante los Tribunales de la justicia a causa de los da?os y prejuicios que el uso y abuso de aquel novedoso vocablo les infiri? como supuesta clave para interpretar aquella poes?a." [But a "dehumanized" poem entails a physical and metaphysical impossibility, and the formula of the "dehumanization of art," coined by our great thinker Ortega y Gasset, rang false. "Dehumanization" is an inadmissable concept, and the poets of the 1920's could have complained to the Courts of Justice about the injuries and prejudices which the use and abuse of this novel term as a presumed key for the interpretation of their poetry inflicted upon them]. 4 B?rger, 1984: p. 49. Continuing this line of thought, B?rger writes that what distinguishes the avant-gardistes from their aestheticist predecessors "is the attempt to organize a new life praxis from a basis in art." 5 At least one geneology of the New Novel would read: Macedonio Fern?ndez - Borges - New Novel. Similarly, No? Jitrik, developing the notion of the self-questioning novel in his "Destruction and Forms in Fiction" (1980: p. 160) pinpoints Macedonio's Museo as "the book which inaugurates the great change in the [self-]conscious orientation of Latin American literature in this century." 6 Quoted in Matthews 1965, p. 54. In a similar vein, Charles Madge's pointed remarks in the Times Literary Supplement, 25 October 1963: "Of all the theories of artistic creation which have held sway during the present century, perhaps the bravest and most all-embracing was the theory of Surrealism, with its programme for the total reconstruction of human spiritual activity based on Marx and Freud. But of all the rooms at the T?te Gallery, for example, the one which seems to hold the least for us in 1963 is the surrealist room, with its emptily programmatic canvases, its hallucinations which were never hallucinated, its dreams that were never dreamt." 7 Or not so unlikely? Despite the enormous gap between their ostensible frames of reference (Parisian intellectuals in Cort?zar, Brazilian</page><page sequence="18">62 Latin American Literary Review backlanders in Guimaraes Rosa), both authors have been strongly influenced by existentialism and Eastern mysticism. They both thus partake of a similar ethos, the valorizing of feeling and intuition over logic and reason. 8 I argue that a similar process of dehumanization takes place in Tres tristes tigres in Chapter VI of my Logos and the word: The Novel of Language and Linguistic Motivation in Grande Sert?o; Veredas and Tres tristes tigres (Berne: Peter Lang, 1983). 9 In this regard, MacAdam has written (1971: p. 101), "El protagonista pretende alcanzar la afirmaci?n que desea estableciendo contacto con alguien que vive en armon?a con el universo y a quien define como su doble." [The protagonist seeks to reach the affirmation he desires by establishing contact with someone who lives in harmony with the universe and whom he defines as his double]. AND, "En Buenos Aires y Par?s, Horacio configura una situaci?n en que ?l forma un tri?ngulo con un amigo y una mujer. El hombre se transformar? en su doble, y la mujer ser? el catalizador que provocar? el proceso de comunicaci?n." [In Buenos Aires and in Paris, Horacio shapes a situation in which he forms a triangle with a (male) friend and a woman. The man will be transformed into his double, and the woman will be the catalyst who provokes the process of communication]. In Paris, he notes, the triangle is comprised of Horacio, La Maga and Ossip; in Buenos Aires, of Horacio, Talita and Traveller. Further elaboration of this idea is ours. For additional discussion of doubles in Cort?zar, see Barrenechea 1983, as well as Lida Amestoy, "A Quest from 'Me' to 'Us': Genesis and Definition of the Pursuer Motif in Cor?zar," in The Final Island: The Fiction of Julio Cort?zar, eds. Jaime Alazraki and Ivar Ivask (Norman: Univ. of Oklahoma Press, 1976), especially p. 154, for mention of the Jungian implications of the male female dynamic. 10 For a discussion of the notion of the figura in Rayuela, see James E. Irby, "Cort?zar's Hopscotch and Other Games," Novel, I, 1 (Autumn, 1967): 64-70. 11 It takes little speculation to assert that both in his person and literary theories Rayuela's Morelli is patterned after Macedonio Fern?ndez. Lindstrom reaches this same conclusion and lists the similarities between the two authors' novelistic programs (1981: p. 59). We also register Cort?zar's remarks on the technical constraints which he imposed upon himself in writing 62: Modelo para armar [62: A Model Kit], e.g.: "...62 es el libro que m?s trabajo me dio, m?s penoso de escribir por la t?cnica que me impon?a. De manera que cuando lo termin? me sent? m?s que contento profundamente aliviado" (Evelyn Pic?n Garfield, Cort?zar por Cort?zar [Veracruz: Centro de Investigaciones Ling??stico-Literarias, 1978], p. 36) [62 is the book that gave me the most work, the most difficult to write, due to the technique I set for myself. When I finished it, I felt less happy than profoundly relieved].</page><page sequence="19">Desire and the Art of Dehumanization 63 12 I discuss the synchretism of Grande Sert?o: Veredas and detail the meshing of the various ideologies in my "Grande Sert?o: Veredas: A Mighty Maze but not Without a Plan," Chasqui XIII, 1 (Nov. 1983): 32 68. 13 Such a withholding of information permeates Guimar?es Rosa's later writings as well, becoming a hallmark of works such as Primeiras Est?rias (Rio de Janeiro, Jos? Olympio, 1962). In what is perhaps the best known story of the collection, "A Terceira Margem do Rio" [The Third Bank of the River], for example, the reader must deduce the meaning of the title as well as the nature of the father's life-long quest, whose physical circumstances and effects the story details, but does not explain.
