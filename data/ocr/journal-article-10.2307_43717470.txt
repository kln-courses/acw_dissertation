<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Skin of Moses' Face - Transfigured or Disfigured? WILLIAM H. PROPP University of California San Diego, CA 92093 Thanks to Michelangelo's well-known portrayal of Moses, the debate over the understanding of Exod 34:29-35, in particular of the phrase welöD yādac kî qãran côr pânâyw in v 29 (cf. similar phrasing in w 30 and 35), is familiar to many readers of the Bible. While from the early Christian cen- turies to the present some have translated qâran as "became horned," most have insisted that the verb really means "was glorified" or "shone," despite the lack of a clear connection between these phenomena and the common Semitic noun *qarnu , "horn."1 Both of these renderings are in fact problem- 1 The oldest attestation of the translation "became horned" is Aquila 's kekeratõto ; see The Old Testament in Greek (ed. A. E. Brooke and N. McLean; London: Cambridge University, 1909) 1/2. 275 (note on Exod 34:35). Jerome adopted this interpretation in the Vg's cornuta esset {Biblia sacra iuxta vulgátám versionem [ed. R. Weber; Stuttgart: Württembergische Bibelanstalt, 1975] I. 126). In the sixth century, St. Gildas of Britain referred to Moses ' cornutam(que) faciem; the tenth-century Aelfric called Moses "gehyrned" (horned). See R. Mellinkoff, The Horned Moses in Medieval Art and Thought (Berkeley, CA: University of California, 1970) 23-27, 81-82. The artistic motif of the horned Moses, which apparently originated in eleventh-century Britain, is discussed by Mellinkoff on pp. 13-17, 61-75. Recently, J. Sasson has argued ("Bovine Sym- bolism and the Exodus Narrative," VT 18 [1968] 380-87) that the Hebrew text portrays Moses as horned. Other modern scholars reconstruct a legend that Moses wore a horned ritual mask; see H. Gressmann, Mose und seine Zeit (FRLANT 18; Göttingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1913) 246-47 n. 7; A. Jirku, "Die Gesichtsmaske des Mose," ZDPV 67 (1945) 43-45; E. Auerbach, Moses (Amsterdam: Ruys, 1953) 154-59; and K. Jaroš, "Des Mose 'strahlende Haut,'" ZAW 88 (1976) 275-80. The earliest source known to me that interprets qãran in Exod 34:29,30,35 to refer specifical- ly to radiance is Pseudo-Philo (Hebrew original first century c.e.): Et descendit Moyses, et cum 375</page><page sequence="2">376 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY | 49, 1987 atical; yet a third interpretation exists, ill-defended and hence little known, that is superior to both. The majority view, that qãran describes a radiant phenomenon, is sup- ported by the Peshitta, LXX, and targums. Closest to the Hebrew qãran côr pãnãyw is the Peshitta's Dzdhy mšk J dDpwhy,2 "the skin of his face was glorified." This could be a literal translation; each Hebrew word has a Syriac equivalent. However, comparison with the LXX and targums raises doubts. The original Greek rendering was probably dedoxastai hē opsis tou ehr õtos tou prosõpou autou ,3 "the appearance of the skin of his face was perfusus esset lumine invisibili , ut descenderat in locum ubi lumen solis et lune est, vicit lumine faciei sue splendorem solis et lune; see G. Kisch, Pseudo-Philo's Liber Antiquitatum Biblicarum (Publications in Medieval Studies 10; Notre Dame, IN: University of Notre Dame, 1949) 147. Similarly, Tg. Neofiti and Tg. Ps.-Jonathan have, respectively, nhr and J štbhr , both of which mean "shone"; cf. Neofyti I (6 vols.; ed. A. Diez Macho; Madrid/ Barcelona: Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas, 1970) 2. 231; and Targum Jonathan ben Uzziel (tá. D. Reider; Jerusalem: Salomon's, 1974) 136. In the eleventh century, Rashi (R. Shelomoh ben-Yishaq) defined qãran: šh^wr mbhyq wbwlt kmyn qrn, "that the light was shining and projecting in the form of a sort of a horn" (my translation); see Pentateuch with Targum Onkelos, Haphtaroth and Prayers for the Sabbath and Rashi's Commentary (5 vols.; ed. M. Rosenbaum and A. M. Sil- bermann; London: Shapiro, Vallentine, 1946) 2. 196. The translation offered by Rosenbaum and Silbermann is misleading; see n. 17 below. Various Christian commentators, such as Petrus Comestor (twelfth century), Rudolph von Ems (thirteenth century), Nicholas of Lyra (thirteenth- fourteenth centuries), Dionysius the Carthusian (fifteenth century), and Cornelius à Lapide (sixteenth-seventeenth centuries), also describe Moses as having had "horns of light" (Mellinkoff, Horned Moses, 85-93). Modern proponents of the shining interpretation are U. Cassuto, Perush cal Sefer Shemot (Jerusalem: Hebrew University, 1951) 313-15; J. Morgenstern, "Moses with the Shining Face," H UCA 2 (1925) 1-27; J. DeFraine, "Moses 'cornuta Facies,'" Bijdr 20 (1959) 28-37; M. Noth, Das zweite Buch Mose: Exodus (ATD 5; Göttingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1959) 220; F. Dumermuth, "Moses strahlendes Gesicht," TZ 17 (1961) 241-48; and B. S. Childs, Exodus (OTL; Philadelphia: Westminster, 1974) 609. The most ancient interpretation of qãran known holds that the word refers not necessarily to radiance, but rather to doxa (Greek) or zíw, yéqãrã ■&gt; (Aramaic), which may be translated "glory." Thus the LXX reads dedoxastai hē opsis, "the appearance was glorified" (Brooke- McLean, The Old Testament in Greek, 1/2. 274); and Tg. Onqelos reads sëgî zíw yéqãrã "the splendor of the glory grew great" (The Bible in Aramaic [5 vols.; ed. A. Sperber; Leiden: Brill, 1959] 2. 151). Similarly, Exod. Rab. speaks of qarnê hahôd, "the horns of glory"; see Midrash Rabbah (ed. M. A. Mirkin; 11 vols.; Tel Aviv: Yavneh, 1960) 6. 185-86. The Peshitta rendering ^zdhy is also in this tradition; see The Old Testament in Syriac According to the Peshitta Version, Genesis- Exodus (ed. P. de Boer and M. Koster; Leiden: Brill, 1977) 1/1. 201-2. The Church Fathers follow the LXX in their allusions to the glory (doxa, gloria) of Moses' face, though Tertullian and Clement of Alexandria refer as well to radiance. 2 Peshitta, Exod 34:29 (see n. 1). 3 Brooke-McLean, (The Old Testament in Greek, 1/2. 274-75. The variant chrõmatos, "color," for chrõtos, "skin," found in Codex Vaticanus and reflected in the OL color, is an inner-Greek assimilation to the notion that Moses' face was radiant. The Alexandrinus, Ambro- sianus, and Coislinianus codices read chrõtos, as do Origen (Commentarium in Evangelium</page><page sequence="3">THE SKIN OF MOSES' FACE 377 glorified. "This is not a literal translation, since there is no Hebrew equivalent for he opsis. Like the Peshitta, the LXX makes no explicit mention of radiance, though the range of meanings of doxa and doxazõ does not pre- clude such an interpretation.4 The renderings of the targums are more complex. Tg. Onq. Exod 34:29 has sëgî zîw yeqãrã D dèDappõhí ,5 "the splendor of the glory of his face grew great." Similarly, Frg. Tg. contains a gloss, šbhw zywwhwn dDpwy,b "the splendor of his face increased." Like the LXX and Peshitta, these targums do not allude specifically to radiance. In Tg. Neof, however, we read nhr zyw Dyqrhwn dDpwy,7 "the splendor of the glory of his face shone." Least literal, Tg. Ps.-J. has Dštbhr zyw Dyqwnyn dDnpwy dhwh lyh mn zyw Dyqr škntD d-haššēm* "the splendid aspect of his face, which he had received from the splendor of the glory of the Lord's Shekinah, was illuminated." It is note- worthy that the targums do not translate the Hebrew côr, "skin," while the nouns for "splendor" and "glory" have no equivalent in the MT. This is reminiscent of Gen 3:21, where kotnôt côr, "garments of skin," is rendered in Aramaic as lēbūšīn diyqãr , "garments of glory."9 As the midrashic tradition indicates, this interpretation stems from a wordplay, reading Dôr, "light," for côr, "skin."10 Joannis 32.26.334; PG 14, 816, A), Eusebius ( Demonstratio Evangelica 3.2.19; PG 22, 172, D), and Cyril of Alexandria ( Glaphyra in Exodum 340; PG 69, 536, A). Note that in v 35 the LXX lacks an equivalent to côr pěné mošeh; if we take this lectio brevior to reflect a purer Hebrew text, we must reconstruct *wérâJû bënê-yisrâ^êl Jet-pënê mošeh ki qârënû. 4 Greek doxazõ and the related noun doxa both have a broad range of meanings. This is apparent from the large number of Hebrew equivalents for doxazõ (fourteen) and doxa (twenty- five) listed in E. Hatch and H. A. Redpath, A Concordance to the Septuagint (2 vols.; Graz: Akademie, 1954) 1. 341, 343. See also " doxa " and " doxazõ " in TWNT 2 (1935) 236-57. 5 See Sperber, Bible in Aramaic, 2. 151. 6 The Fragment-Targums of the Pentateuch according to their Extant Sources (2 vols.; ed. M. L. Klein; AnBib 76; Rome: Biblical Institute, 1980) 1. 88, 181; 2. 59, 139. 7 See Diez Macho, Neofyti I, 2. 231. 8 See Reider, Targum Jonathan, 136. 9 To be more precise, Tg. Onqelos has lēbūšīn diyqãr cal měšak bisrěhon (Sperber, Bible in Aramaic, 1. 5), "garments of glory upon the skin of their flesh," thereby translating both &gt;ôr and côr. Similarly, Diez Macho, Neofyti I, 1. 19, reads Ibwšyn d J wqr Imšk bsrhwn, "garments of glory for the skin of their flesh." The Paris Fragmentary Targum has Ibwšyn dyqr mn[!J mšk bsryhwn, "garments of glory [made] from the skin of their flesh" (Klein, Fragment-Targums, 1. 46); and Tg. Pseudo-Jonathan has Ibwšyn dyqr mn mšk hwy' "garments of glory [made] from the skin of the snake" (Reider, Targum Jonathan, 5). "The snake" is obviously the snake in the Garden of Eden, but the rendering of Pseudo-Jonathan must also be related to the Jewish legend that God clothed Adam and Eve with the skin of Leviathan ( The Legends of the Jews [7 vols.; ed. L. Ginzberg; Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1909] 5. 103 n. 93). 10 Ginzberg, Legends, 97 n. 69; 103 n. 93. According to Gen. Rab., R. Meir (second century c.e.) was acquainted with a text of the torah that read ktnwt &gt;wr ( Bereschit Rabba [ed. J. Theodor; Berlin: Zewi Hirsch Izakowski, 1903] 196).</page><page sequence="4">378 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY | 49, 1987 Therefore, it is highly likely that also in Exod 34:29,30,35 the transla- tors of the targums were following an Dal tiqrê midrash that read the phrase as qãran Dôr pānāyw.u Two factors would have strongly abetted such a reinterpretation. First, the loss of distinction among the guttural consonants is widely attested for many Northwest Semitic dialects starting just prior to the common era.12 Secondly, Dôr pānīm is a more common phrase in the OT and would naturally be read as well in Exodus 34.13 There is further evidence that the Jewish exegetes were reading côr as Dor. The unexpected terms for "splendor" and "glory" found in the targums to Exod 34:29,30,35 appear in other targumic passages where the MT reads Dõr or nõgah. In 2 Sam 22:13 Hebrew minnõgah negdô is rendered mizzîw yéqãrêh;14 in Ps 36:10 bëDôrëkâ is translated bzy w yqrk; in Ps 44:4 Dôr pãneykã corresponds to nhwr zyw yqrk ; and in Ps 89:16 Dôr pâneykâ ap- pears in Aramaic as nhwr zyw J pk .,5 In other words, the targums use the very wording found in Exod 34:29,30,35 in other passages that refer to the radiance of Yahweh. This too indicates that in Exodus côr was read as Dôr. Final corroboration may be found in the Samaritan tradition, which describes Moses as crowned with qrn Dwrh, a "horn of light."16 It is interesting that the 11 See the comments of M. M.

Moreover, since the Aramaic sëgî zîw etc. is virtually synonymous to the Syriac Dzdhy and Greek dedoxastai, and since both the Peshitta and LXX were written during the period of guttural confusion18 and reflect as well Jewish exegesis, it is possible that they too derive their interpretation from the midrashic reading of côr as Dôr.{9 Yet another origin for the LXX rendering has been proposed. E. ben- Yehudah's Thesaurus contains the following note: "They [the LXX] do not translate', in fact, the word qrn, but interpret in Dal tiqrê fashion: Do not translate kî qâran , but kiyqãrãn ([like] the glory of the beasts of [Yahweh's] chariot, or the like)."20 That the LXX on occasion differs from the MT in word D. Heidenheim, Die samaritanische Liturgie (Bibliotheca Samaritana 2; Leipzig: Schulze, 1885) 21, text 1 1:14. Both these sources, when citing the biblical text where qâran is a verb rather than a noun, correctly read qrn cwr (MacDonald, Memar, 1. 124; Heidenheim, Liturgie, 4, 205, text 100:15). To qrn 3 wrh compare qeren hahôd in Exod. Rab. (cf. n. 1). 17 A. Even-Shoshan, Hammillôn Hehādāš (3 vols.; Jerusalem: Kiriat Sefer, 1979) 3. 1226. The tendency to read Jôr for côr in Exod 34:29,30,35 has persisted through our own day. For instance, in Rosenbaum and Silbermann ( Pentateuch , 2. 196) we read Rashi's comment on v 29 in the English translation: " Qrn is an expression connected with the wordqrnym 'horns,* and the phrase qrn Jwr [sic J the light-' horned, ' is used here because light radiates from a point and projects like a horn." The italicized English words are supplied for ease of comprehension by the translators, who have mistaken côr for J or ; Rashi gives no explicit indication that he is reading J or . Similarly, MacDonald {Memar, 2. 203) translates Jh mn qrn cwr pnyw (1. 124) as 'O, you [Moses] the light [s/cl of whose face shone!" 18 There are numerous examples of disagreement between the LXX and the MT as to whether a word is read with cayin or ^ālep. In cases where the masoretic reading seems preferable, we must suppose a confusion of these consonants either in the LXX Vorlage or in the minds of the translators. Often the Greek reading is the result of accident, but on occasion, as in Isa 17:10 (nacâmãn read as though the opposite of ne^ēmāri) and possibly in our passage, there is exegetical motivation. For examples of ^yin-^alep interchange, see E. Tov, The Text-critical Use of the Septuagint in Biblical Research (Jerusalem Biblical Studies 3; Jerusalem: Simor, 1981) 201; F. Peries, Analekten zur Textkritik des Alten Testaments (Munich: Ackermann, 1895) 68; A. Geiger, Urschrift und Uebersetzung des Bibel (Breslau: Hainauer, 1857)380; M. L. Margolis, "Studien im griechischen Alten Testament," ZA W 21 (1907) 258; J. Fischer, In welcher Schrift lag das Buch Isaias den LXX vor? (BZAW 56; Giessen: Töpelmann, 1930) 80-81. It must be admitted, however, that none of the examples listed by these authors is from the Pentateuch, the oldest part of the LXX. 19 Since the LXX and Peshitta allude to both skin and glory, we must recognize a double translation of the variety we saw in the targumic interpretation of Gen 3:21 . On this phenomenon, see S. Talmon, "Double Readings in the Massoretic Text," Textus 1 (1960) 145-84. 20 E. ben-Yehudah, Thesaurus totius hebraitatis veteris et recentioris ( 16 vols.; Jerusalem: Ben-Yehudah Hozaa-La^Or, 1940-58) 12. 6190 (my translation from the Hebrew).</page><page sequence="6">380 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY | 49, 1987 division is well documented;21 less satisfactory is ben-Yehudah's interpretation of the consonants kyqrn, for "like their glory" does not mean "was glorified." I prefer to read here a form of the Aramaic adjective yaqqîr, "glorious," and assume that the yôd of kî was read twice. The nun of qäran may simply have been ignored,22 or it may have been taken as the feminine plural suffix -ān, as if yaqqîrân modified pânãyw instead of cor.23 Note that doxa and doxazõ render yěqar and cãsâ yeqãr in Esth 1:4; 4:17; 6:3; LXX Dan 2:37 (doxa); Ps 37 (LXX 36):20; Esth 6:6,7,9,11; and LXX Dan 2:6 (doxazõ). The two theories presented above, that an cayin was read as an Dālep and that kî qäran was redivided, are not incompatible. Perhaps the targums were reading kî yaqqīr(ān) Dôr pânãyw, "the light of his face was glorious" (reading yaqqîr ), or "his face was glorious with respect to light" (reading yaqqîrân , though an Aramaic speaker would have expected the construct yaqqîrât). Some such reading would account for the LXX's dedoxastai. It remains difficult to explain the Greek opsis ; perhaps it is more than coincidental that in its place the targums have zîw, which I have rendered "glory," but which could with equal justice be translated "appearance."24 In any event, the probable midrashic origin of their renderings indicates that we may no longer simply appeal to the Aramaic or Greek versions in contending that qäran means "shone" or "was glorified." Is there any further support for the tradi- tional interpretation? Among the numerous scholars who have advocated the translation of qäran as "shone" are U. Cassuto, J. Morgenstern, J. DeFraine, M. Noth, and B. S. Childs.25 Besides citing the LXX, Peshitta, and targums, these writers, like their medieval predecessors, appeal to Hab 3:4: wénõgah kãDôr tihyeh qarnayim miyyãdô lô wěšam hebyôn cuzzôh. Since qarnayim seems parallel to nõgah and Jôr ; it has often been translated "rays." But Hab 3:4 is a dangerous prooftext, since it is manifestly corrupt; tihyeh is the wrong gender, "brightness was like light" is tautological, "from his hand to him" is self-contradictory, and the meaning of hebyôn is unknown. We need not accept his radical emendations to agree with W. F. Albright that "there is no real basis for the usual rendering 'rays' instead of 'horns, ł which is deduced from this one passage and does not appear in any early versions."26 Actually, 21 See Tov, Text-critical Use, 174-77, 199, 234. 22 Ibid., 164. The LXX also read the yôd twice. 23 On the LXX exegesis based upon the Aramaic, see ibid., 125, 164, 249-50; Fischer, Schrift, 9; Z. Frankel, Vorstudien zu der Septuaginta (Leipzig: Vogel, 1841) 201. 24 Opsis translates zîw in "Theodotionic" Daniel 2:31. 25 See n. 1. 26 W. F.

However, no Semitic language makes such an association. Nevertheless, L. R. Bailey has proposed as Arabic cognates qarnun, which basically means "horn" but also describes "the first visible part of the rising sun," and qarînatun, which generally means "spouse" but also refers to the pregnant women's disease eclampsia, which can culminate in a stroke during which the sufferer perceives bright lights.28 Neither of these lexical items, however, reflects a common Semitic usage of the root qrn to denote radiance. Qarnun probably does not refer to the rays of the rising sun but rather to the shape of its sliver, just as many peoples describe the crescent moon as "horned."29 Qarînatun has been defined as "epilepsy" as well as "eclampsia"30 and in any case has no connection with radiance. Since its primary definitions are "spouse" and "succubus," both from qarana, "to 27 Surprisingly, no scholar has brought in Ps 132:17: šām Dasmîah qeren lëdâwîd cāraktī nēr limšīhī, "there I will cause a horn to sprout for David; I will set (perhaps "[where] I have set"?) a flame for my anointed." This could be compared with 2 Sam 21:17, where David is associated with nēr yisrã^êl, "the flame of Israel." However, from other passages, viz., 1 Sam 2: 1, 10; 2 Sam 22:3 = Ps 18:3; Ezek 29:21; Amos 6:13; Ps 75:11; 89:18,25; 92:11; 112:9; 148:14; and Lam 2:3,17, we know that qeren may mean "power" or "majesty." Therefore, we should read in Ps 132:17 nîr, "dominion," as suggested by P. D. Hanson, "The Song of Heshbon and David's Aïr," HTR 61 (1968) 318 n. 29, rather than conclude that qeren is equivalent to nēr, "flame." Another neglected line of argument is the citation of biblical (as well as Akkadian and Ugaritic) references to shining faces. See J. C. Greenfield, "Lexicographical Notes II," H UCA 30 (1959) 141-51, esp. 144, 147. To my mind, texts such as Isa 60:5 and Ps 34:6 (cf. also Eccl 8:1) are the strongest support for the traditional understanding of Exod 34:29-35, since they refer to the shining (hē^īr) of faces after beholding Yahweh. In these passages, however, the shining of the face is a blessing rather than a fearsome phenomenon like that of Exod 34:29-35. Moreover, hē^īr seems to denote figuratively a joyous expression rather than the literal emission of light. Greenfield has successfully shown that the roots &gt;wr and śmh overlap in meaning, though he is more concerned with the translation of the latter as "shine" than with the former as "appear happy." 28 L. R. Bailey, "Horns of Moses," IDBSup, 419-20. Bailey apparently supposes that eclampsia is so called on account of the illusion of lights, since the name is derived from Greek ekiampsis, "shining forth." However, the Greek word also means "sudden happening," which is an appropriate name for a disease; see LS J, 511. 29 This is one of the explanations cited by G. W. Frey tag, Lexicon Arabico- Latinum (4 vols.; Halle: Schwetschke, 1830-37) 3. 435: "superior pars solis." Cf. the Akkadian usages cited in CAD Q, 137-38. 30 Qarînatun is defined as "eclampsia" in H. Wehr, A Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic (cd. J. M. Cowan; Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 1971) 760; however, R. Dozy (Supplément aux dictionnaires arabes [2 vols.; Leiden: Brill, 1881] 2. 339) defines qarînatun as "epilepsy."</page><page sequence="8">382 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY | 49, 1987 join," the medical use of qarînatun simply reflects the common superstition that demonic possession is the cause of seizures. Given the lack of solid support, it is not surprising that even in antiquity the traditional interpretation of Exod 34:29-35 had its dissenters. Aquila and Jerome, perhaps mindful of Ps 69:32, where maqrîn means "putting forth horns," rendered qãran as "was horned."31 This interpretation was popular- ized by the Vg; and, while Jerome understood "horned" to refer to the power to resist sin, his translation was often taken literally in the Middle Ages, and hence the emergence of the artistic motif of the horned Moses in medi- eval Britain.32 This line of exegesis has been revived by H. Gressmann, A. Jirku, E. Auerbach, and K. Jaroš, who regard Exod 34:29-35 as an etiology for the supposed custom of wearing horned ritual masks in ancient Israel, and by J. Sasson, who reconstructs a legend that Moses was actually horned at Sinai.33 Jirku believes that Moses is described as having descended the moun- tain with such a mask, which he would cover with a masweh in order not to frighten the people; Gressmann, Auerbach, and Jaroš, on the other hand, claim that masweh refers to the horned mask itself.34 Cassuto voices strong objections to this approach, asking why the condition of Moses' skin is emphasized and how he could have been unaware he was wearing a mask.35 Jaroš attempts to counter these arguments by interpreting côr pãnâyw, "the skin of his face," as a leather face mask and by attributing welõD yādac (Exod 34:29) to a later stage of tradition; in both cases he avoids the plain sense of the text. The chief objection to the theories of Gressmann, Auerbach, and Jaroš (but not Jirku) is that they reverse the account of Exod 34:34-35. The Bible indicates that Moses used to doff the masweh when carrying out his cultic duties and wear it at other times, while these scholars maintain that Moses wore the horned masweh only when in the service of Yahweh. Such 31 Aquila's kekeratõto . . . derma prosõpou mõsei (see n. 1) has the skin of Moses' face sprouting horns. This awkward language, faithful to the wording of the MT, is modified in Jerome's cornuta esset fades sua (n. 1), which simply ignores the Hebrew côr. 32 See Jerome's commentary on Amos, PG 25, 1067; and MellinkofT, Horned Moses, 77-78. 33 See the first paragraph in n. 1. 34 Throughout this article, I shall simply transliterate masweh; the meaning and etymology of the word are not certain. Most likely, the same root swy occurs in Phoenician swt, denoting some kind of garment, attested in the ninth-century Kilamuwa inscription (KAI 24:8) and the fourth-century "Batnocam" inscription (KAI 11:2 [cf. vol. 3, pl. 3]). For Hebrew, compare swt (vocalized sût ) in Gen 49:11, also a garment. In my opinion, since a swt was launderable (Gen 49:11) and therefore of cloth, the traditional rendering "veil" (Greek kalymma, Latin velamen) for masweh is most likely correct. 35 See Cassuto, Shemot, 313-15.</page><page sequence="9">THE SKIN OF MOSES' FACE 383 disregard for the present form of the biblical text diminishes the plausibility of the horned mask theory, as does the absence of evidence for the use of such masks in Israel.36 Sasson contends that the figure of Moses reflects both the Mesopota- mian AMAR.GA, "suckling calf," the son of Sin, and Ugaritic Mt, perhaps a person begotten by Baclu upon a heifer. If Moses was originally depicted as a bovine god or demigod, argues Sasson, it is logical that he should be replaced by a golden calf (Exodus 32) and that he should be horned. But Sasson's theory is also difficult in many respects. In the first place, the Ugaritic text he cites is not well understood. Secondly, the Bible speaks of the skin of Moses' face, while we would rather expect the head or forehead to sprout horns. Thirdly, if *hiqrîn (Ps 69:32) means "to grow horns," the qal form might be expected to have a specialized meaning.37 Finally, why should Moses be manifest as a pagan deity after meeting Yahweh?38 The two interpretations of qâran côr pânâyw discussed so far - that Moses' face shone (or was glorified) and that Moses grew horns (or wore a horned mask) - are in fact quite similar. According to both, Moses descended Sinai with the actual or assumed countenance of a Near Eastern deity, whether beaming or horned.39 But if his face shines, why not use the usual terms hē^īr, nāgah, etc., and why emphasize "skin"? Again, if Moses is horned, why not hiqrîn and why not "head" or "forehead" instead of "the skin of his face"? 36 Gressmann believes that the tērāpīm were cultic masks; see G. Hoffmann and H. Gress- mann, "Teraphim: Masken und Winkorakel in Ägypten und Vorderasien," Z AW 40 (1922) 75-137. This view is endorsed by Auerbach, Moses, 157-59. More recently, however, H. A. Hoffner ("The Linguistic Origin of Teraphim," BSac 124 [1967] 230-38; "Hittite Tarpiš and Hebrew Teraphim," J N ES 27 [1968] 61-70) has strongly argued for the derivation of tērāpīm from Hittite tarpis, "spirit, demon" (= Akkadian šēdu). 37 This is a minor objection. A. Sperber ( Hebrew Grammar [New York: J PS, 1943] 144-48) lists fifty-one verbs that are synonymous in the qal and hiphil conjugations according to masoretic vocalization. 38 Sasson disregards the cause-and-effect relationship between talking to Yahweh and the condition of the skin of Moses' face. He writes ("Bovine Symbolism," 387): "In this one vestige of a suppressed cult, this one single depiction of a horned Moses, symbolizing the old pagan faith, being brought face-to-face with the God of the new creed, Y H WH asserts his dominance. It is he who gives the orders. . . . From then on, there is no more mention of horns, no more mention of veils." This analysis would make more sense if Moses were described as horned before ascending Sinai. 39 The radiance of Yahweh is alluded to in many OT passages (cf. n. 13 and other examples, such as Num 6:25; Ps 31:17; 67:2; 1 19:135). For Mesopotamian references, see A. L. Op- penheim, "Akkadian pui(u)ķ(t)u and melammu ," J AOS 63 (1943) 31-34; and E. Cassin, Le splendeur divine (Paris: Mouton, 1968). The horned deity is ubiquitous in the ancient Near East; numerous examples can be found in A NEP-z. g., pls. 475, 489, 498, 505, 527, 538, 544, 654. For examples from the rest of the world, see L. Scheftelowitz, "Das Hörnermotiv in den Religionen," ARW 15 (1912) 451-87.</page><page sequence="10">384 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY | 49, 1987 Moreover, one is hard-pressed to find other ancient Near Eastern texts in which a human converses with a deity and comes away looking like that deity. On the other hand, the Bible is replete with tales of men who were maimed or killed by contact with the divine sphere.40 Accordingly, we might suppose that the unusual condition of Moses' skin after meeting Yahweh was in fact an injury or disfigurement. Many languages employ derivatives of "horn" either lexically or meta- phorically to denote unusual toughening of the skin.41 This usage was also read into Exod 34:29-35 by the medieval rationalist heretic Hiwi al-Balkhi, quoted by Abraham ibn-Ezra. Al-Balkhi argued that "because he had not eaten bread, Moses' face dried up like horn, and the reason that 'they feared' [Exod 34:30] was because his face was hideous."42 I believe that this under- standing of qäran is fundamentally correct, but the diagnosis is implausible - the skin does not dry as a result of starvation.43 More recently, Albright has similarly opined that "the word qäran. . . may most naturally be interpreted as meaning simply 'horny.'"44 Despite his rationalistic presuppositions, B. D. Eerdmans has given an explanation of qâran côr pãnâyw attractive in many respects. He conjectures that the Midianite smiths set up their forges on Mount Sinai and with smoke, hammering, and fire simulated cloud, thunder, and lightning. Moses, having gotten too near the fire, came down with his face "hardened like horn," whereupon the Israelites fled from Moses on account of his disfigured face. The function of the masweh was to spare the people the gruesome sight.45 If we discount Eerdmans's Midianite speculations, a perfectly plausible interpretation of Exod 34:29-35 remains. According to Israelite legend, Moses was granted the unique privilege of beholding Yahweh (Exod 33:18-23; 34:5-8) and of speaking with him directly (Num 12:8; Deut 34:10); however, he also 40 Gen 32:23-33; Exod 19:21-24; 20:19; 24:11; 33:20; Lev 16:13; Num 16:19-35; Deut 5:5; Judg 13:22; 1 Samuel 5-6; 2 Sam 6:6-7; 1 Kgs 8:11 (2 Chr 5:14); and Isa 6:5 demonstrate the potential hazards of contact with the supernatural and the dread felt by Israelites in the presence of Yahweh. 41 In English we have "horny," "corn" (of the foot), "keratoid," "keratosis," etc; in German, "Hornhaut" and "hornig"; in French, "corné." The Latin cornus may describe a wart, see Horace, Satires , Epistles and Ars Poetica (LCL; ed. H. Fairclough; Cambridge, MA: Harvard University, 1929) 69. In modern literary Arabic qarni and í aqran mean "horny" (Wehr, Dictionary, 760), as does qarnì in Modern Hebrew (Even-Shoshan, Hammillôn Hehādāš, 1227). 42 Ky bc bwr ŠP &gt;kl šbw pny mšh ybšwt kmy hqrn wtc m wyyr 3 w mpny šhyw pnyw mkcrwt; seeJ.

Presumably, this was some kind of light or heat burn. Exod 34:29-35 is from P; and in Exod 24:17, the Priestly narrative immediately preceding, P describes Yahweh's kâbôd as like a "consuming fire."46 Note that the redactor of JE and P has inserted this account after Exod 33:18-23; 34:5-8, Moses' partial vision of Yahweh's glory (J?).47 The implication is that Moses would have died had he seen Yahweh's face (Exod 33:20), but a glimpse of his back merely disfigures him. It is difficult to determine more precisely the medical condition that the Israelites called qäran. Since so many languages use the word "horn" in a similar fashion, it is likely that any Semitic cognates are parallel develop- ments rather than true "genetic" cognates; it is noteworthy that no ancient Semitic language besides Hebrew uses "horn" to denote an abnormal skin condition.48 It is worth mentioning, however, that in Syriac qarnāD is "a corn, [a] horny excrescence"49 and that Arabic uses Distaqrana of a boil which "swells to the point of rupture."50 These are simply two more examples of a common semantic development. What, then, are the possibilities for Hebrew qäran? One suitable skin condition is keratosis, a toughening of the layer of skin called keratin (&lt; Greek ¡ceras, "horn") that can be caused by drastic overexposure to sunlight. Also possible is the formation of black eschar, a common result of severe burning. Finally, qäran might simply mean "to blister" or "to become cal- loused" (cf. the English "corn" [of the foot]). In this case, perhaps qäran refers not so much to the toughening of the skin as to the formation of little bumps comparable to budding horns. Such reactions to prolonged exposure to light or heat must have been known in antiquity; the calloused hands of the smith before his furnace are compared to crocodiles in the Egyptian "Satire on the Trades."51 Since we can at most be sure only that qäran was a 46 For bibliography on the matter of source assignation, see Morgenstern, "Moses," 1 n. I. Signs of Priestly authorship are the references to Aaron (vv 30,31), the leaders (něsPím) of the community (v 31), the tablets of testimony (v 29), and Sinai (vv 29,32). Even if we remove from v 29 hācēdūt and sînay, following LXXB, the residuum is convincing. To regard the other evidence of the hand of P as the result of interpolation, as do Morgenstern, DeFraine ("Moses," 33), and Noth ( Exodus , 220), is arbitrary. Features such as the fear of Aaron or Moses' service in the tent might indicate the tradition's non-Aaronid origin, but more likely P's intent is to emphasize the dangers of cultic service for any non-Aaronid, even Moses the Levite. 47 On account of its extreme anthropomorphism, this section is likely to be Yahwistic. 48 There is one unclear allusion to a feature of the head called qarnu (SI) in a Meso- potamian omen text (F. R. Kraus, Texte zur babylonischen Physiogno matik [ AfO Beiheft 3; Berlin: Weidner, 1939] No. 6, Rs. 9). 49 A Compendious Syriac Dictionary (ed. J.

By this interpretation, Moses' practice of repeatedly exposing himself to Yahweh's presence (Exod 32:34-35) has no ritual significance.52 It is intended to renew not his glory, but rather his immunity, for his hardened skin renders him almost invulnerable to divine radiance. Like Achilles and Siegfried, Moses has unnaturally thick skin, but its virtue is apparent in the cult, not on the battlefield. In short, that the skin of Moses' face qâran is unlikely to be a sign of virtual apotheosis. Rather, Exod 34:29-34 describes the lawgiver's disfigure- ment on the one hand and immunity on the other. The story honors Moses as the human most intimate with Yahweh, but it also specifies the price he paid.53 52 Pace Gressmann (Moses), Auerbach ( Moses), and Jaroš ("Des Mose 'strahlende Haut'"), who attach great significance to Moses* donning and doffing the masweh.
