The archive for the essay is constituted by visualizations of Indian national territory produced by "barefoot" cartographic practice, which routinely supplemented the scientific map form of the nation with the anthropomorphic presence of Mother India. Such anthropomorphized maps, the author argues, prepared the ground picto?ally for the map of the nation to receive the sacrifice of the passionate patriot. The geography of a country is not the whole truth. No one can give up his life for a map. ?Rabindranath Tagore, 19191 The best of all Good Companions to take with you to a strange place is undoubt edly a MAP. ?W. W. Jervis, 19382 The strange place to which I take you in this paper is death, specifically, death for the nation s territory, although whether a map is undoubtedly a good com panion for you on this journey I leave for you to decide, for I hope to persuade you to the contrary. Several years ago, Benedict Anderson suggested that in an age marked by the dissolution of older beliefs regarding fatality and immortality and the paralyzing disenchantment that followed, nationalism emerged to recalibrate the meaning of death. He further insisted that unless we explore the connection between nationalist ideologies and death and immortality, it is impossible to understand why so many millions kill and are willing to die on behalf of what is, after all, an abstraction: "These deaths bring us abruptly face to face with the central problem posed by nationalism: what makes the shrunken imaginings of recent history generate such colossal sacrifices?" (Anderson 1991, 7). More recently, Sumathi Ramaswamy (sumathi.ramaswamy@duke.edu) is Professor of History at Duke University, in Durham, North Carolina. ^abindranath Tagore (1985, 90^91). 2W. W.

It is the object of a special kind of love?one whose demands are sometimes known to exceed all others, even to the point of death" (2001, 2; emphasis added). In this essay, I reflect on these assertions by considering patriotic pictures produced in colonial and postcolonial India in order to understand how these attempt to transform the national territory into a tangible and enduring object of such a special kind of love that it is deemed deserving of the bodily sacrifice of the citizenry. In doing so, I intend this pictorial essay to advance our under standing of "the passion of nationalism, of the heroism, self-sacrifice and sense of righteousness which it can provoke" (Kitching 1985, 109). What place do patriotic pictures occupy in the economy of such passion? This is the question I set out to answer by introducing the three anchor images of this essay The first of these, a print from the late 1940s from Calcutta, shows Mother India, or Bharat Mata, the female personification of the Indian nation and its territory (figure 1). Holding the Indian national flag in one hand, she stands on a partially visible terrestrial globe, on which is also perched a figure identifiable to the visually cued Indian viewer as Bhagat Singh, a young man from Punjab who was hanged by the British colonial state on March 23, 1931. He is handing her his bloodied head, presumably severed by the sword that lies next to him, while blood from his decapitated body flows onto the globe, and onto some roughly marked territories that appear to be parts of India and the adjacent country of Burma. In return, Mother India blesses him for his act of corporeal sacrifice.3 The second picture from around the same time was printed in Bombay soon after Mohandas Gandhi s assassination in New Delhi on January 30, 1948 (figure 2). The Mahatmas life story is arranged in visual vignettes around the central image of his bullet-marked body standing on a terrestrial globe, onto which is painted the rough outline of a place we recognize as the subcontinent. As in figure 1, in this picture as well, the blood from his carefully placed wounds drips down to earth, forming a puddle on the map of India. That the artist did not miss the tragic irony of the apostle of nonviolence being gunned down by an assassin s bullet is clear from the smoking revolver placed on the map of India drawn on the globe. Fast-forwarding to 1984 and to the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi on October 31, my third image is an election billboard from December ofthat year on display in a crowded marketplace in Hyderabad (figure 3). Blood from Indira's wounded body, draped in a white checked sari, flows onto a map of 3The print is possibly based on a painting done in the 1930s by Rup Kishore Kapur (1893-1978) that might have been published soon after as a chromolithograph. We learn from Kapur s grandson that "The day Bhagat Singh was hanged, [Kapur] painted in a day [a picture] of Bhagat Singh beheaded, giving his head on a plate to Bharat Mata. Bharat Mata is weeping. He painted it and [displayed it in Sambal] and shouted Bande Mataram [I revere the Mother] and he was taken by the police and was imprisoned for one or two years" (quoted in Pinney 2004, 128).</page><page sequence="3">Maps, Mother/Goddesses, and Martyrdom in Modern India 821 5??k Ht* fat. ?^ ?T?Te ?fc *n**TV Shaheed Bhagai Singh J.

What do these pictures want, I ask, inspired by the argument of W. J. T. Mitchells book by the same title (2005). And correspondingly, what does the map of India?the common protagonist of all three pictures?want of its viewer? To anticipate my response, I suggest that it wants the patriotic Indian to be prepared to surrender life and limb to the Indian national territory, much in the manner of Bhagat, Gandhi, and possibly Indira. It wants martyrs for its cause. But I am getting ahead of myself?I need to begin with the ruses</page><page sequence="4">822 Sumathi Ramaswamy Figure 2.

Geo-Graphing India As others have argued, the mapped form of the nation enables the whole country to be seen at one glance and synoptically, allowing the citizenry to take "visual and conceptual possession" of the entirety of the land that they inhabit as an imagined collective (Helgerson 1986, 51).

Hale once observed that without a map, "a man could not visu alize the country to which he belonged."4 More recently, Thongchai Winichakul has insisted that "our conception of the nation with its finely demarcated body comes from nowhere else than the political map ... A modern nation-state must be imaginable in mapped form" (1996, 76). If it were not for the map of the nation, in these readings, the geo-body would remain an abstraction, 4Quoted in J. B. Harley (1983, 26).</page><page sequence="6">824 Sumathi Ramaswamy leaving its citizen-subjects without any visual means to see the country, especially as an integral whole, to which it is anticipated they are attached. Arguably, without the aid of the map, it would simply not be possible to even conceive of the country as a unified bounded whole, let alone see it. Patriotism in moder nity requires peculiarly novel technologies of persuasion. On the face of it, the map of the national territory is among the most intriguing?and compelling? of these technologies. And yet, much work has to be done with and on the modern map of the nation to make it patriotically adequate and efficacious, to compel men (and some women) to die for and on its behalf. For even though the map form might enable the nation-space to be synoptically seen and perceived as a unified whole, and though it might allow the state to make the country visually legible and controllable (Scott 1998, 11-52), it also renders it profoundly un-homely, laid out on an impersonal cartographic grid on the face of the earth, emptied of quotidian meanings and local attachments and, most consequentially, voided of prior sentiments of longing and belonging. As recent scholarship on the disciplinary histories of geography and cartography demonstrates, the procedures and proto cols of these globalizing sciences over the course of the late eighteenth and the long nineteenth century overwhelmingly resulted in their seizing intellectual possession of the earth and asserting mastery over it through empirical observation, systematic classification, and calculating rationalization (Godleweska and Smith 1994). The world came to be cognitively tamed as it was measured, mapped, and rendered manageable. These sciences are a telling example of the Cartesian imperative to see the world as a representable object that Martin Heidegger wrote about when he proposed that "the fundamental event of the modern age is the conquest of the world as picture." In the age of the world picture, "the word picture' now means the structured image that is the creature of man's produ cing which represents and sets before. In such producing, man contends for the position in which he be that particular being who gives the measure and draws up the guidelines for everything that is" (Heidegger 1977, 134). Consequently, the age of the world picture does not mean a picture of the world in the sense of being its copy, "but the world conceived and grasped as a picture" (129), so that it appears as an "enframed" image. For Heidegger, such an enframing is revelatory of the emergence of the modern subject, who stands abstracted from a world that he could observe, manipulate, and have at his "disposal." "[T]he fact that the world becomes picture at all is what distinguishes the essence of the modern age.... There begins that way of being human that mans the realm of human quality as a domain given over to measuring and executing, for the purpose of gaining mastery over that which is as a whole" (130-32). Conceived, grasped, and enframed as a disposable object of calculation and mastery, the earth stands disenchanted. If we follow Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno in their assertion that the "program of the Enlightenment was the disenchantment of the world; the</page><page sequence="7">Maps, Mother/Goddesses, and Martyrdom in Modern India 825 dissolution of myths and the substitution of knowledge for fancy" (1972, 3), then the colonial program in India, launched at the height of the European Enlight enment, was the progressive, albeit fitful and incomplete, disenchantment of a place named India. For the colonial state in India, ruling the country was pre mised on knowing the country, such knowing and subsequent mastery beginning with the topographical, and doggedly dedicated to the "geo-graphing" of the land as it was made visible to the eye, measurable by instruments, and chartable on a map (Sparke 2005, xiv). Convinced that "Hindus as a rule are deficient in observation," and that they lack scientific curiosity, the colonial project claimed to write the true and correct geography of India, rescuing it empirically from the "fabulous" and "fanciful" spatial conceptions embedded in Hindu texts (Ramaswamy 2000, 595). Regardless of the prevalence of enchanted or pictur esque visions of land and landscape produced within an Orientalizing episteme, the India of official colonial geography was an abstract, rational, mathematized place, emptied of fanciful "inspiration" and fabulous imagery (Edney 1997). As Christopher Bayly notes, colonial Indian geography schoolbooks, modeled as they were on an eighteenth-century British geographic tradition influenced by Locke and Hume, were "relentlessly matter-of-fact and empirical. Geography was a science of measurement and description," interrupted every now and then with "unsystematic racialist assertion" (1996, 311-12). In particular, the method of colonial geography was "deliberately dry and un-theoretical, an anti dote to romance and imagination" (309; emphasis added). Not surprisingly, it banished native spatial visions that were not compatible with such aspirations to the margins of the normative. That many Indians in the colonial and postcolonial period succumbed to the lure of the map form, which enabled their country to be normatively presented as whole and complete is quite clear from the hold of the science of cartography on official practice and, in some measure, on the popular imagination well after British rule ended in the subcontinent. Yet, to many others, the map of India in and of itself appears not to have been an adequate representative device for picturing their country as homeland and motherland. It is to some such dissenting voices that I now turn in order to explore their potential to disrupt the disen chanted disciplines of modern geography and cartography, as well as to mark the inherent limitations of such transgressions. For, at the very least, this dissent leads me to ask, can the patriot feel "at home" in a geo-graphed India? Where indeed is the home(land) that the patriot is willing to kill and die for after geography and cartography have done their disciplining work? How is a space of calculation transformed into a field of care in which the devoted citizen might dwell with a sense of longing and belonging? (Tuan 1977). To respond to such questions, I begin with three voices?all male, all elite and upper caste, all Bengali Hindu, and all products of a modern edu cation?from roughly the same moment in the early years of India s long nation alist century. First, a character named Sandip in the 1916 Bengali novel Ghare</page><page sequence="8">826 Sumathi Ramaswamy Bhaire (The Home and the World), written by one of the emergent nations fore most thinkers, Rabindranath Tagore, insists that when he gives up his life fighting for the nation, "it shall not be on the dust of some map-made land," for "the geography of a country is not the whole truth. No one can give up his life for a map" (1985, 90-91).5 The sentiment expressed by Rabindranath's fictional prota gonist finds a real-life echo in Bipin Chandra Pal, a nationalist who was just as forthright in refusing to entirely cede to colonial science the terrain that was India in a book revealingly titled The Soul of India (1911): "The outsider knows her as India. The outsider sees her as a mere bit of earth, and looks upon her as only a geographical expression and entity. But we, her children, know her even today.... as our Mother" (1923, 106; emphasis added). A few years earlier, across the subcontinent in Baroda, when an interlocutor asked his then-teacher Aurobindo Ghoshe for advice on how to become patriotic, he is believed to have pointed to a wall map of India hanging in his classroom and replied, "Do you see this map? It is not a map, but the portrait of Bharat mata [Mother India]: its cities and mountains, rivers and jungles form her phys ical body. All her children are her nerves, large and small.... Concentrate on Bharat [India] as a living mother, worship her with the nine-fold bhakti [devotion]."6 All three utterances are revealing, for they signify not an outright rejection of the colonial geographic and cartographic project as much as an underscoring of its inadequacy ("not the whole truth," not "a mere bit of earth," "not [just] a map"). The modern map form of the country is indispensable, for, after all, it gives concrete shape to India in its entirety, following the precise protocols of mathematical cartography; it provides the basis for rule and governance, and it demarcates what belongs within its borders and what does not. In other words, it gives tangible form to a nation yearning for form. But nonetheless, as these voices from the start of the new century testify, doubts surfaced about this novel device that magically gave form to the ephemeral abstraction that is the nation: Could one (be made to) die for such a map, for the sake of what were, after all, lines drawn on a piece of paper? Indispensable it might be, but in and of itself, it seemed inadequate to compel the patriot to sacrifice life and limb. This inadequacy was to be countered and compensated for by reminding Indians, in case they had forgotten this ancient truth under the hegemony of empire and its schooling and bureaucratic practices, of what "India" really was: not a "mere bit of earth" nor the "dust of some map-made land" of statist 5First published at the height of World War I and translated into English (under the authors super vision) in 1919, Chare Bhaire has been hailed by most critics as a passionate critique of nationalism, especially its more extremist, violent, and irrational manifestations. Tagores Sandip is the very antithesis of the ideal man and citizen of the world, to which the poet-novelist himself aspired. 6Quoted in J. H. Dave et al. (1962, 38). 7Here, I am adapting Dipesh Chakrabartys well-known call to "provincialize" Europe and its thought (Chakrabarty 2000).</page><page sequence="9">Maps, Mother/Goddesses, and Martyrdom in Modern India 827 geography but a "living mother," Bharat Mata or Mother India. Her body? female, divine, Hindu?comes to be deployed?poetically, prosaically, and picto rially?to anthropomorphically (re)claim an India seized and enframed as map by scientific geography and cartography. Anthropomorphized Map, Carto-Graphed Mother/Goddess8 Much has been written by others on the emergence of the gendered representation of India as "Mother India" in the last quarter of the nineteenth century in Bengal, from where her popularity soon spread over the subcontinent during the course of the next few decades (for a review of this literature, see Ramaswamy 2002). This exceptional female figure appears as both divine and human; as "Indian" but also reminiscent of female figurations of the nation from other parts of the world, especially the imperial West; as invincible but also vulnerable; as benevolent but also bloodthirsty; as comely maiden but also as ageless matron; and as guardian goddess of the nation but at the same time in need of her sons' care and protection. Here, I build on this scholarship while drawing attention to the specific ways in which the gendered and divine form of Bharat Mata is pictured in a whole host of visual media, including calen dar art and wall posters, paintings, textbook illustrations and jacket covers of nationalist pamphlets and books, newspaper cartoons and mastheads, advertise ments, and the occasional commercial film (Neumayer and Schelberger 2007; Ramaswamy 2001, 2003; Sen 2002). While the persistence of the figure of Mother India in such pictures may not be surprising given the popularity of female divinities in the region, her association with modern cartographic devices such as maps and terrestrial globes is an innovation indeed. For, as histo rians of cartography insist, mapped knowledge is "hard won knowledge," a product of sustained cultural, intellectual, and pedagogic work (Wood and Fels 1992, 5). That even the relatively unlettered and unschooled frequently used the map form of the nation?its geo-body?to picture Mother India at a time when literacy rates in the colony were appallingly low is remarkable testi mony to the emergence of a set of practices and techniques that I refer to as "barefoot cartography," whose primary creative influence and aesthetic milieu is the art of the bazaar. Patricia Uberoi has defined bazaar or calendar art as "a particular style of popular color reproduction, with sacred or merely decorative motifs ... The art style extends beyond calendars and posters. In fact, it is a general 'kitsch' style which can be found on street hoardings, film posters, sweet boxes, fireworks, 8The neologism "carto-graphed" is meant to draw attention to the yoking together of the human or divine body and cartographic products such as maps and globes to produce a particular kind of spatial knowledge. In this study, a carto-graphed figure is one that is inscribed in the form of a map or drawn to accommodate, outline, or be attached to the map form of a country.</page><page sequence="10">828 Sumathi Ramaswamy wall-paintings, and advertising, and in the knick-knacks sold in fairs" (1990, 46). In this wider sense, bazaar art is ubiquitous across the nation, providing it with a shared visual vocabulary across regions and communities otherwise divided from each other (Freitag 1999). Historian of art Kajri Jain (2007) has brilliantly ana lyzed the social, moral-ethical, and commercial networks within which bazaar images have been produced, evaluated, disseminated, and consumed from the late nineteenth century into the present. And Jyotindra Jain has usefully shown how this art form uses "a visual language of collage and citation which, in turn, act[s] as a vehicle of cultural force, creating and negotiating interstices between the sacred, the erotic, the political, and the colonial modern" (2003, 13). Most influentially, Christopher Pinney has insightfully explored the visual politics of the deployment of bazaar imagery, which is enormously revealing of the "corpothetic" sensibility that under girds its anticolonial impulses (Pinney 2004).9 My own work builds on this scholarship while focusing on the deployment of the modern map form of the nation in and by that sector of bazaar art that I iden tify as patriotic because of its investment in and devotion to the territorial idea of India (albeit variously configured over time and across different interests). My conceptual analytic of barefoot cartography is meant to distinguish patriotic art's investment in the map form from the state's command mapmaking ventures, which are conducted with modern instruments of surveillance, measurement, and inscription by trousered and booted men of secular science.10 As I have already emphasized, the modern state s normative involvement in mapping is instrumental and regulative: to make land visually legible for rule and resource management and to determine sovereignty and police borders. From this per spective, the modern map is a classic example of a "state simplification," and as such, it attempts to systematize and demystify the state s terrain in the dispassio nate interest of command and rule (Scott 1998). In contrast, barefoot cartogra phy in India, even while cheekily reliant on the state's cartographic productions, routinely disrupts it with the anthropomorphic, the devotional, and the maternal. Undoubtedly, the barefoot is in contested intimacy with command cartography, as it dislodges the state's highly invested map form from official contexts of 9By "corpothetic," Pinney means the sensory embrace of and bodily engagement with images that is so characteristic of the modern visual regimes of the subcontinent, especially at the popular and devotional level across numerous religious, regional, and ethnic divides. 10I write this in spite of the fact that recent scholarship has effectively shown the extensive reliance by the British on native subordinates (bare feet and all!) in the work of the colonial surveys and mapping of the subcontinent (Raj 2006). My use of this conceptual category also draws on the everyday reality of the average Indians privileging of bare feet to perform numerous tasks ranging from the sacred to the mundane. Further, many images of artists at work on the subconti nent show them doing so with bare feet. As important, though, the analytic is meant to capture a metaphorical sense of "barefoot-ness" as a condition of being that facilitates a more earthbound and sensory, even corpothetic, relationship to soil, land, and territory than is arguably possible when fol lowing the protocols of a lofty and rarified science such as cartography.</page><page sequence="11">Maps, Mother/Goddesses, and Martyrdom in Modern India 829 production and use and re-embeds it?sometimes to the point of only faint resemblance?in its own pictorial productions; in doing this, barefoot mapmak ing reveals its own corpothetic and idolatrous investment in national territory, in contrast to command cartography's mathematized grids and lines of power. In particular, barefoot cartographic work suggests that, at least for some Indians, the map of India?that symptomatic scientific artifact used to delimit a measured territory called India?is not an adequate representation in and of itself for mobi lizing patriots to the point of bodily sacrifice, indispensable though it might be for bestowing a credible form upon the emergent nation. It has to be supplemented by something else, and that something else is more often than not the gendered divinized body of Mother India. Thus, barefoot mapmaking is not antagonistic or antithetical to state and scientific cartography in a simplistic manner. Rather, after the fashion of so much else in colonial India, where the gifts of empire and science were simultaneously disavowed and desired, patriotic popular mapmak ing takes on the map form but pushes it in directions not necessarily intended for it by either science or state. India's barefoot mapmakers are almost always male, generally Hindu, and not always products of formal schools or art training. Even with no obvious education in maps or training in their use, in the science of their production, or the aes thetics of their creation, these men play no small role in popularizing what Ben edict Anderson refers to as the "logo" outline form of the national geo-body so that it becomes recognizable and familiar, not needing the crutch of naming or identification, "pure sign, no longer compass to the world" (1991, 175). Regard less of the various social, economic, regional, and ideological differences that might prevail among them or the changes they might undergo over time, these men warrant being treated as a unified field in terms of their inexpert, undisci plined, and informal relationship to the science of cartography and its mathema tized products, to which they turn for various purposes. Their lack of specialist cartographic expertise should not, however, be read to mean that they are na?ve or apolitical. On the contrary, there are highly complex and competent ways in which a specialized product?one of the most prized inven tions of Europe, and consolidated by colonial surveyors and their Indian assis tants through many decades of triangulation, measurement, and inscription?is dislodged from its official circles of circulation and use and put to purposes that exceed those of science or state. In fact, I would even venture that in the late colonial period, when few Indians went to school and studied geography books or encountered maps and globes in their classrooms, it was through the mass media that the map form of the nation was rendered familiar to the average citizen, as it traveled?albeit in a highly condensed, even caricatured, form?across the subcontinent, incorporated into newspaper mastheads and car toons, merchandise labels and advertisements, god posters and calendars, and such. As it has circulated in this manner, the fidelity and integrity of the mapped form of the nation has varied, ranging from rough-and-ready sketches</page><page sequence="12">830 Sumathi Ramaswamy of the Indian geo-body to highly specific renderings with an astonishing attention to physiographic detail. From such a motley range of barefoot cartographic cre ations spanning the twentieth century, I have identified five different ways in which the anthropomorphic form of the mother/goddess is thrown into the company of the nation s geo-body represented by the map of India, and vice versa. The result of this convergence is that the mathematized map of India is "anthropomorphized," while the gendered body of Mother India comes to be "carto-graphed." First and most commonly, Bharat Mata literally occupies the map of India, partly or substantially filling up cartographic space with her anthropomorphic form (see, e.g., figure 4). There are many ingenious ways in which her body blurs or undoes the carefully configured boundaries and borders of command cartography. This is particularly true of contested national spaces such as Kashmir or Pakistan, even parts of Sri Lanka, which are frequently claimed by ingenious arrangements across the map of Mother India s limbs, hair, or clothing. If in such pictures the body of the mother/goddess, distinct from the outline map of the nation, anthropomorphizes the map by moving in to occupy it, there are others in which parts of Bharat Mata merge with the Indian geo-body so that the two are, in parts, undistinguishable. Thus, in a circa 1931 lithograph that was proscribed by the colonial state, the lower half of Mother India s body disappears into the map of India (extending toward and including Burma), on which are deli neated the country's rivers, mountain ranges, and other physical features (figure 5). The dependence of barefoot cartography on statist mapped knowledge is clearly on display here, as is the fact that the latter is not simply taken on board without adjoining it with the anthropomorphic form of Mother India. Thus, an image such as this connects with an important suggestion made by some key intellectuals early in the twentieth century that there is no distinction between the country named India by colonial geography and Bharat Mata, who resides in all its constitu ent parts. As Aurobindo Ghose insisted rhetorically in 1905, 'What is a nation? What is our mother country? It is not a piece of earth, nor a figure of speech, nor a fiction of the mind. It is a mighty female power (shakti), composed of all the powers of all the millions of units that make up the nation" (1956, 436). In a third configuration, rather than occupying the cartographic space of India or merging with it, Bharat Mata stands (or sits) on a map of the nation whose outline is sometimes sketched on a terrestrial globe that is sometimes shown partially and, at other times, as a whole sphere gridded by latitudes and longitudes (e.g., figure 1). In such pictures, Mother India appears as the mistress of a carto-graphed world, her crowned head reaching into the firmament as the national territory that she embodies on the globe on which she rests is visually inscribed, frequently, as the only one that matters on the face of this earth. The conceit of the modern terrestrial globe, Denis Cosgrove s recent study shows, is that it seemingly privileges no specific point on the earth's surface, "spreading a non-hierarchic net across the sphere." The dispassionate and</page><page sequence="13">Maps, Mother/Goddesses, and Martyrdom in Modern India 831 Figure 4. Ma ki Pukar (Mothers Call), artist not known, 1966.

Yet India's barefoot mapmakers betray their patriotic predilections by appropriating the normative terrestrial globe and putting it to a very different purpose by virtually erasing the presence of other lands and other nations from the surface of the earth, so that frequently only "India" looms large and visible, anthropomorphized and sacralized by the body of Bharat Mata perched perkily on it. In terms of a growing intimacy between the mother/goddess and the mapped form of the nation, the most consequential development occurs when the map of India as ground and as prop is dispensed with.

In such pictures, even without a map form, the mapped image of the country is presumed. For example, a 1937 chromolithograph titled Vande Mataram (I Revere the Mother), printed in the South Indian city of Coimbatore (possibly to celebrate the recent victories of the Congress Party in the country-wide elections), shows Bharat Mata clad in the flag of the nation (figure 6). The contours of her body sketch out the mapped outline of India, as her tricolor sari (with the Gandhian spinning wheel drawn along its border) billows out to claim the territorial spaces of the emergent nation. Finally, especially in the years after independence, Mother India moves out of the cartographic space of the nation to either sit or stand in front of the map of India, which appears as a shadowy silhouette in the background (figure 7). Such pictures offer an important contrast to the dominant representation in the earlier decades of the century of the carto-graphed Bharat Mata. As if with freedom from colonial rule, Mother India's claim on India's geo-body is secure enough to not have her occupy it or merge into it, as her visual votaries obviously felt compelled to do during the colonial period.

All the same, as the freedom movement draws to a close and India's indepen dence from colonial rule is secured, the map of India can be relegated to the background, a shadowy prop into which she can move in times of national crisis or threat. In his memoirs, published in 1936 at the height of the anticolonial struggle against British rule, Jawaharlal Nehru, destined to become the new nation's first prime minister, worried over the mystifying corporeality that seemingly ani mated the patriotic common sense of his fellow citizens: It is curious how one cannot resist the tendency to give an anthropo morphic form to a country. Such is the force of habit and early associ ations. India becomes Bharat Mata, Mother India, a beautiful lady, very old but ever youthful in appearance, sad-eyed and forlorn, cruelly treated by aliens and outsiders, and calling upon her children to protect her. Some such picture rouses the emotions of hundreds of thou sands and drives them to action and sacrifice. (1980, 431; emphasis added) The nation, we have been told, yearns for form. What these pictures reveal to us, what even Nehru's rationalism concedes, is that in colonial and postcolonial India, that yearning is never just content with the form bestowed upon the country by the scientific map, indispensable though it may be in delineating borders and boundaries, measuring distances between places, and drawing out the contours of mountains and rivers and forests and fields. For "action and sacrifice," patriotic</page><page sequence="16">834 Sumathi Ramaswamy Figure 7. "The Motherland," V. A. Sapar, 1967. Print, 37 x 36 cm. Publication details unknown. J. P. S.

Once brought into proximity with the country's map form, the plenteous divine female body shows up the insufficiency of one of the Enlightenment's and colonial sciences most consequential inventions. In the process, the map stands anthropomorphized, divinized, and feminized. The ground is pictorially prepared, in a manner of speaking, for the map to receive the sacrifice of men. Between Men, Map, and Mother In resorting to the figure of Mother India to supplement the mapped form of the nation, barefoot cartography reveals as well its preoccupation with male</page><page sequence="17">Maps, Mother/Goddesses, and Martyrdom in Modern India 835 bodies, especially the "big men" of official Indian nationalism.11 Such men are, as is apparent from the titles of patriotic prints, the "Jewels of India," the "Architects of Indian Resurrection," the "Gems of the Nation." When women appear at all in the company of the map of India, which is not all that frequently, they are invari ably shadowy presences or pictured as honorary men; they are generally not the principal object of the barefoot mapmakers adulation. In striking contrast to much popular art in India, where women are hypervisible in incarnations ranging from the goddess to the vamp, it is men who are accorded prominence in patriotic pictures, thus reiterating the dominant truth about nationalism as a masculinist project, fantasy, and hope. In such pictures, Bharat Mata appears as "the conduit through which collusions and collisions" between patriotic men are worked out, allowing in this process bonds of male homosociality to evolve between them (Krishnaswamy 1998, 47). Drawing on Eve Sedgwick's work (1985), I suggest that the nation is preeminently pictured as a male homosocial arena in which men jostle for power and privilege but also work out their mutual fascinations, anxieties, and hostilities through and around the exceptional figure of Bharat Mata. Thus, in many productions of barefoot mapmakers, Mother India shares the cartographic space of India that she occupies with male patriots, many of them identifiable figures from the dominant official nationalist pantheon, most especially Mahatma Gandhi or "Bapu," "Pandit" Nehru, and "Netaji" Bose (but never, of course, Muhammad Ali Jinnah).12 Together, the extraordinary mother and her devoted, mostly Hindu sons pictorially repossess what had hitherto appeared to be the domain of the British Empire?colored pink or red?in numerous colonial maps, atlases, and globes. Indian territory now passes under their joint custodianship, a custodianship in which the new (big) men of India own and rule the territory in the name of the mother. As Manu Goswami has noted in her study of the new discourses on territory that emerged in late colonial north India, "The resolutely 'subject-centered' language of possession was trans posed from individuals (upper-caste, Hindu, male) in relation to land to Bharat [India] as a national territorial possession. Bharat Mata marks the historically sig nificant reconstitution of colonial spatiality into national property" (2004, 203). These patriotic pictures are exemplary of this significant reconstitution in that they draw upon the artifact of the map, through which all manner of claims nI borrow the term "big man" from the anthropological work of Mattison Mines, who uses it to develop a model of leadership and status building through "the redistribution of benefits, [the leaders] generosity as a broker, and [the leaders] prestige." Some women can also be "big men" (Mines and Gourishankar 1990). 12Other than the anonymous Muslim body signified invariably by a fez-capped head, the only Muslim men whom I have seen in these pictures in the company of the map of India are those "loy alists" associated with the Congress Party, such as Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, and a relatively unknown associate of Bhagat Singh's called Ashfaqullah who was hanged by the colonial state in 1927.</page><page sequence="18">836 Sumathi Ramaswamy to territorial possession have been imagined, anticipated, and made in modernity, and in that they deploy the figure of the mother?convenient for the transform ation of the mathematized colonial territory of India from a terrain of statist cal culation into a nationalist homeland?to seal the deal in favor of the male citizenry. Not surprisingly, when she appears in the company of her men, Bharat Mata is generally shown as a stilled figure whose primary visual function is to draw attention to the activity going on around her, namely, the labor performed on behalf of the map of the nation and its territory by prominent male citizens. In return for their patriotic and filial service, her hand reaches out to bless the men occupying the map of India, almost as if signaling her approval of their pro prietary relationship to her territory. So much so that, especially around the time of Indian independence and after, Mother India's body is dispensed with comple tely, and only the heads or busts of her sons occupy the map of India in a gesture that Pinney has aptly characterized as the mapping of "physiognomy onto carto graphy" (1997, 847). It is as if with freedom from colonial rule, the male citi zenry's proprietary claim over Indian national territory is also secure, and map and man can relate directly to each other without the mediating figure of the mother. In barefoot cartography and the patriotic imagination that animates it, the ideal of masculinity is pictured as placing one's life and limb at the service of map and mother. Rejecting worldly pleasures and privileges, the ideal Indian man casts himself in this role, and he is pictured as selflessly dedicated to Mother India and the territory she embodies, although there are diverse models of filial service on display. Self-effacing service to the nation and its territory might be the road to visibility in the world of patriotic pictures, yet barefoot cartographic practice also reveals its ambivalences and anxieties?as well as pride?about the ultimate patriotic endgame for men, the crowning glory of martyrdom. The martyred male body?"the body in bits and pieces" (Axel 2001, 149), bloodied, decapitated, or hanged?is the honorable prize of the pictorial transaction between men and maps in the name of the mother. Thus, nationalist ideology?masculinist though it might be in conception and practice?brought with it its share of burdens and tragedies for men along with privilege, power, and visibility. Male martyrdom to map and mother in the name of India, subsequently offered to other male citizens as worthy of emulation, is exemplary of this net of risk and death in which some men found themselves entangled.13 We get a glimpse of the barefoot mapmaker's ambivalence about these larger than-life men and their apparent mastery in prints that depict the life story of the leader as a pictorial biography. In contrast to Mother India, who rarely appears 13For a detailed analysis of the deployment of the discourses of martyrdom in contemporary Hindu nationalism, see Christiane Brosius (2005, 233-78).</page><page sequence="19">Maps, Mother/Goddesses, and Martyrdom in Modern India 837 aged, decrepit, or dead in any patriotic production, being as she is both the immortal goddess and the very embodiment of an ever-youthful nation, however ancient its origins, her sons are very mortal indeed: They are born, grow into young men, age into adults, and even die, their very mortality ultimately marking the limit of their mastery. An example of this is a print from the 1950s, Jawahar Jiwani (Life of Jawahar), by the same artist who produced one of the anchor images discussed earlier (figure 2). The focus of this print is Prime Minister Nehru, who stands on a globe centered on a partially outlined map of India (left unnamed). His feet are firmly planted on Indian territorial space, making it his own even as his body and head reach into the firmament, suggesting that here is a man who has the world and India at his feet. Any sign of enduring mastery, however, is undone by the fact that he looks quite old, his customary pensive look supplemented by unmistakable signs of aging. He may be a master of the globe and of India, but that he is still a mere mortal is clearly underscored by the artist in the representation of various episodes from his life ranging from his birth to his development into youth and his maturation into adulthood and old age, arranged as visual vignettes around the central figure of the frail, aging prime minister. A lifetime achieving mastery, the print appears to suggest, leads not to perennial immortality but to old age and eventually death. This is even more striking in the print by the same artist that I introduced earlier titled Bapuji ki Amar Kahani (Gandhi's Eternal Story, figure 2). Painted by the Nathadwara artist Lakshminarayan Khubhiram Sharma, the poster pre sents a series of visual vignettes of Gandhi from his birth in a cradle swathed in the (recently created) Indian national flag to his death, his body ready for cre mation and draped in the tricolor, his last words Hare Ram, "O God," inscribed in Hindi across it. Sharma appears to have modeled these vignettes on readily avail able photographs of Gandhi at key moments in his eventful life: as a young London-bound student, as a stylish barrister in South Africa, as a satyagrahi who had cast off his Western ways, and then, from his later career as a nationalist leader back in India, launching and leading the historic Dandi march, behind bars at his spinning wheel, launching the Quit India movement, and so on. These vign ettes are, in turn, arranged clockwise around what Sharma obviously saw as the central feature of Gandhi's "eternal" life?his martyrdom for the nation and its map, an image that does not exist in the photographic record. Occupying the center of the poster is the smiling, dhoti-clad image of Gandhi, holding a staff in one hand and carrying a red book (possibly the Bhagavad Gita, his favorite scripture) in the other. Bright red blood from three carefully placed bullet wounds in his chest drips down to form a puddle on the outline map of the Indian nation etched on the face of a terrestrial globe. Photographic realism gives way to patriotic mythography The patriotic artist's visualization of the Mahatmas bloodied carto-graphed body is taken to its logical extreme in a recent painting by one Dr. Vijay Goyal</page><page sequence="20">838 Sumathi Ramaswamy on exhibit in the National Gandhi Museum in New Delhi in which the artist has painted in oil and blood Gandhi standing on a globe with the outline map of India (and some adjoining territories). That the doctor-turned-artist was willing to use blood?perhaps his own?to pictorially reenact and perform on canvas the primal act of the Mahatmas bleeding to death for the nation and map is a telling, if macabre, indication of the corporeal penchants of patriotic art. Goyal's literally bloody painting shows Gandhi with not one but three heads (two of them painted in the colors of the national flag), signifying his apotheosis and his assimilation into the Hindu pantheon with its many multiheaded and mul tilimbed gods. Indeed, in the pictorial transaction between (big) men and the map in the name of the mother, Gandhi's special task is to secure the blessings of the (Hindu) gods for the project of Indian nationalism. His body serves as the conduit between the earthly India, which is metonymically represented by the map form, and the celestial realm, which is inhabited not just by the deities of the Hindu pantheon such as Krishna or Shiva but also, in the eclectic spirit of Gandhian nationalism, by the Buddha and Jesus. With his progressive canonization and apotheosis, especially after 1948, Gandhi, too, leaves the earthly realm and joins this divine sphere, from which he showers his blessings on "India" and the men (and the occasional women) who occupy it, pictorially transforming in the process the disenchanted terrain of colonial calculation into the hallowed punyabhumi (blessed land) of the (Hindu Indian) nationalist imagination. A revealing example of this is an anonymous print possibly from 1948 and published by the Bombay-based Shree Vasudeo Picture Co. titled Swargarohan (Ascent to Heaven), in which Gandhi rises to heaven in a pavilion. The Hindu trinity?Shiva, Vishnu, and Brahma?along with their wives, waits to welcome him. Instead of eagerly looking toward this heavenly welcome, he gazes down on the world below that he has departed from, signified in the print by a globe on which is drawn a physiographic map of India, clearly appropriated from command cartography. Gandhi's apotheosized gaze, however, transforms India from a mere geo-graphed land on the face of the earth into a special territory worth dying for, as he demonstrated in and by deed (Ramaswamy 2008). His sacrifice for map and mother is all the more endearing to the patriotic artist, for if there is one man who is shown most masterfully in command of the Indian map in these pictures, it is certainly Gandhi, who is undoubtedly the most ubiquitous hero of this genre of political art. Although in his prolific verbal discourse, Gandhi did not invoke Mother India as often as some of his con temporaries, especially those who were overtly Hindu nationalist, he is clearly her favorite son in popular Indian visual productions. In posters and prints from the 1920s on, she looks to him to save her, smiles upon him as he breaks the chains that bind her, sheds tears over his passing, gathers up his bullet-punctured blood ied body into her arms, and heralds his entry into heaven. His inexhaustible command of nation and territory is striking in a circa 1948 picture by K. R.</page><page sequence="21">Maps, Mother/Goddesses, and Martyrdom in Modern India 839 * ^ fc^ir? * arwfc ?row: ? ? T?? ??ff *?* ft i? ?3R? * Wt? fo* ! Figure 8.

As the fumes from his funeral pyre vaporize into the skies above, they are transformed into the shadowy contours of a cruciform map of India, out of which Gandhi's head emerges, smiling cheerfully over his own cremation. The print seems to suggest that even in death, Gandhis body and the geo-body of the nation are inseparable: Such is the strength of the bond between the map and this particular man, who is the "immortal soul of India."</page><page sequence="22">840 Sumathi Ramaswamy Gandhis apotheosis also provides the occasion for the patriotic artist to imagine what life after death might be like for the nation's martyrs. In prints published around 1948, such as Gandhiji ki swargyatra (Gandhi's Pilgrimage to Heaven), by the Bombay-based poster artist Narottam Narayan Sharma (Pinney 2004, 140), and in the Calcutta artist Sudhir Chowdhury's The Last Journey of Bapuji (Neumayer and Schelberger 2007, plate 259), the Mahatma is shown being carried to paradise in a celestial chariot pulled by either angels or swans; waiting to greet him in the heavens above are the Hindu gods, as well as the Buddha, Jesus, and Nanak. In another anonymous circa 1948 print called Svarg mein Bapu (Gandhi in Heaven), while Gandhi ascends to heaven on a winged bird, Mother India (her sari and flowing tresses carefully arranged to produce a rough mapped shape of India) stands below with tears flowing down her face, recalling another dramatic print from Calcutta called Bapuji on Eternal Sleep (circa 1948) in which she, in a manner that powerfully echoes the Piet?, holds Gandhi's bullet-scarred body in her arms, blood from his wounds dripping down to Indian territory lush and luxuriant (Neumayer and Schelberger 2007, plate 261; Ramaswamy 2008). Such prints appear to suggest that although Gandhi might have died a mortal, he lives on eternally, as befits a true martyr. Not surprisingly, in Sharma's Bapuji Ki Amar Kahani, the Mahatmas dead body is visually subordinated to the martyr's living body, which wears a beatific smile notwithstanding the multiple wounds that puncture the chest (figure 2). The patriotic artist's adulation of Gandhi and his pictorial honoring of his martyrdom are perhaps not surprising in that he visually reiterates official as well as popular nationalism's reverence for the Mahatma, although his recasting as a carto-graphed body is a singular contribution of barefoot mapmaking, as I will explain a little later. The most dramatic images of martyrdom for map and mother in patriotic visual practice are perhaps not so much of Gandhi, however, but of a relatively unknown young man who came to be immortalized through popular pictures. On March 23, 1931, Bhagat Singh (b. 1907), a young Punjabi with avowedly socialist and atheist views on the nation and the world, was hanged by the colonial state (along with his "co-conspirators," Rajguru and Sukhdev) for assassinating a British police officer in Lahore in 1928. Almost immediately, Bhagat Singh's execution became the subject of the patriotic artist's visual imagination and has remained popular until today, much of this art converting his death through hanging into martyrdom by the sword for mother and map. A new category of male patriot thus became popular in patriotic visual imagination, frequently designated by a complex and charged category, shaheed or "martyr." The Arabic word shaheed, used in a Quranic context and in an Islamic universe for pious Muslims who died heroically bearing witness to God's truth, is resignified to refer to patriots who willingly?even eagerly?shed their blood for the ostensibly secular truth of the nation and its map.</page><page sequence="23">Maps, Mother/Goddesses, and Martyrdom in Modern India 841 In his recent exploration of Indian chromolithographs, Pinney rightly notes the compelling prominence of this hitherto unknown young man in popular visual practice of the last century, so that in an official colonial inscription, "for a time, he bade fair to oust Mr. Gandhi as the foremost political figure of the day" (2004, 124). Offering a skillful analysis of Bhagat Singh's visual persona in popular prints (in which he always appears as a young man with a striking mous tache, wearing Western clothes, his head adorned by the ubiquitous trilby), which are interpreted as the artist's admiration for his "audacious mimicry" and ability "to pass" as the white man, Pinney also insists that "official nationalism may have decried the activities of revolutionary terrorists, but popular visual culture asserted the nation's debt to those prepared to kill and be killed in the cause of freedom" (2004, 136). Indeed, it is with Bhagat's death that martyrdom for the nation becomes a sustained visual subject that captures the imagination of India's barefoot mapmakers, as well as the attention of the colonial state's censor ship apparatus. Some time after Bhagat's death by hanging appeared a print titled Bandhan Mein Bharata Mata Ka Bhent: Lahore Conspiracy Case Decision?Sentenced to Death, No. 1403 (figure 5). Proscribed by the colonial authorities, the print features Bharat Mata as a two-armed goddess, her hands bound in chains; only the upper part of her body is visible, the lower half merging into a topo graphic outline map of India, on which the principal rivers and some mountain ranges are faintly visible. Facing her are the decapitated bodies of several young men whom the print identifies as J. N. Dass, S. Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, and Sukhdev. Strikingly, each decapitated male body is shown dispassionately offering his head to Mother India, Bhagat Singh's standing out prominently with trilby still proudly on, eyes staring defiantly ahead. In this print, and in others published around the same time and subsequently the severed heads of these youthful martyrs, especially Bhagat's, are described in Hindi as bhent (gift) or as ball (sacrificial offering), and additionally qualified in English or Hindi as "first," "curious," and even "wonderful." The recipient of this "wonder ful" or "curious" bhent or ball is invariably Mother India, who sometimes receives the head(s) impassively, at other times with tears flowing down her face, her arms and legs bound in chains, but also sometimes, reaching out to receiving the macabre offering all too eagerly. Frequently she is in the company of the map of India: occupying it, merging with it, or sitting on a globe with the outline of India drawn on it. Even when the map of India is not present, Indian national territory is almost always suggested in the back ground by snow-capped mountains, luxuriant green fields, gushing streams, and silhouettes of temples, pictured through an aesthetic that I characterize as "patriotic pastoral" (see also Jain 2003; Pinney 2004, 93-103). In many such pictures, the lush, life-affirming plenitude of the background only shows up more dramatically the act of life-effacing martyrdom to map and mother being performed in the foreground.</page><page sequence="24">842 Sumathi Ramaswamy Most strikingly, in many a print, blood from Bhagat s severed head (and, sometimes, his decapitated torso) gushes out to form a puddle on the map of India (see, e.g., figures 1 and 4). When Richard Lannoy traveled in India in 1958, he photographed a patriotic print of Bhagat Singh posted in a goldsmith's stall alongside some "god posters" in a Ba?aras bazaar. The print shows Bhagat kneeling on a globe with the partial outline of the map of India drawn on it and colored yellow. Blood from his decapitated body flows down as red rivulets onto the map below him, while blood from his severed head, which he offers to Mother India, gathers in a puddle at her feet (Lannoy 1999, plate 494). Years later, in a recruitment poster from the mid-1960s called Ma ki pukar (Mother's Call), Bharat Mata occupies a map of India, the halo around her head character istically occluding the contested territory of Kashmir (figure 4). Bhagat Singh, dressed in white shorts and shirt, kneels in front of her and dispassionately hands over his severed head (with eyes closed, but still wearing the trilby). Blood from the severed head gushes onto Bharat Matas feet and onto the map of India; bright red blood also spurts out of the decapitated torso. Although it is important to reiterate that Bhagat was executed by hanging and not by decapitation, his martyrdom for mother and map is generally shown as such, for it allows the barefoot mapmaker to connect his death at the hands of a cold, calculating colonial state apparatus to the desired and desirable death of other exemplars of selfless devotion?such as the eighteenth-century Sikh martyr Baba Dip Singh, but others as well across India's many religions, including Islam?whose passing is depicted in a similar manner as bloody bodily mutila tions in popular devotional art.14 And what of Bharat Matas role in this visual pedagogy constituted around the wounded or decapitated body of the martyr?15 Another picture from the early 1930s by Prabhu Dayal might be helpful here (figure 9). Titled Svatantrata Ki Vedi par Biron Ka Balidan: Bharat Ke Amar Shaheed (Sacrificial Offerings on the Altar of Freedom by [Our] Heroes: India's Immortal Martyrs), it shows a female figure with a crown on her head standing in the foreground with a bloodied axe in one hand and a severed head in another, while other heads and decapitated bodies lie strewn around. Two young men?one of them clearly Bhagat Singh in his trademark trilby?wait before "the altar of freedom," their heads ready to be axed by the goddess. In this print, Prabhu Dayal pictures the unnamed goddess (possibly Mother India) as directly responsible for the death of her devoted sons in a manner comparable to several bloodthirsty goddesses 14For other examples and helpful discussions regarding them, see Brosius (2005, 258-61, 322-23) and Louis E. Fenech (2000, 158-77). 15I borrow the notion of "visual pedagogy" from Antoine de Baecque's work on revolutionary France, in which he argues that images of the wounded bodies of the martyrs of the Revolution were deployed again and again in paintings and prints in order to "make compassion arise," to "open the path of political awareness" in the community, and to produce "a ritualized call to political action" (1997, 281-307).</page><page sequence="25">Maps, Mother/Goddesses, and Martyrdom in Modern India 843 Figure 9.

This is a rare picturization, for in a majority of other cases, the most Bharat Mata does is arm her warriors with the sword of battle?the sword with which they presumably kill others, and possibly behead themselves as well. As the national movement picks up in fervor and as Gandhian nonviolence appears to yield few concrete results, the print suggests that the mother might not be satisfied with anything less than the bloody offering of the heads (balidan) of her most devoted sons. Indeed, the corporeal fragment of the severed bloodied head as the gift (bhent) or sacrificial offering (bali) to map and/or mother becomes such an over determined signifier of (youthful) male martyrdom in the patriotic visual economy that even the premature and accidental death of Subhash Chandra Bose?who was not executed by the colonial state?is pictured in a similar manner in prints such as Subhashchandra Bose Ki Apoorva Bhent (Subhash Chandra Bose's Extraordinary Gift) by an unknown artist, possibly from around 1945 (figure 10). Here, a headless Subhash?a favorite of the patriotic artist?stands uprights, holding his own severed (and smiling) head, from which blood gushes onto a framed outline map of India inscribed with his trade mark slogan Jai Hind, "Victory to India." Here, the martyr's blood appears to pic torially nourish and rejuvenate the nation's geo-body, presumably also fed by the</page><page sequence="26">844 Sumathi Ramaswamy Figure 10.

Similarly, in a striking circa 1947 print called Shaheed Smrity (Memory of Martyrs), the Bengali artist Sudhir Chowdhury places Bharat Mata in a patriotic pastoral landscape with the sun rising on the horizon (Pinney 2004, 136). Nehru (no great patron of this brand of violent nationalism) stands in front of her, gestur ing to a number of plates that have been placed before her, clearly as a ritual offering on the occasion of the independence of India. On each plate is the head of a young man, each one identified by name: Bhagat Singh, Khudiram Bose, Surya Sen, Debvrata, Rameshwar, and Kanailal Dutt. These men were either hanged or shot to death for various anticolonial intransigencies and assas sinations, but here their deaths are pictorially translated as decapitation, and their heads are visualized as ritual offerings to Bharat Mata in a manner that echoes</page><page sequence="27">Maps, Mother/Goddesses, and Martyrdom in Modern India 845 Nanak's injunction to his Sikh followers, "If you want to play the game of love, approach me with your head on the palm of your hand. Place your feet on this path and give your head without regard to the opinion of others."1 Indeed, there is a new "game of love" at play in twentieth-century India, and its object is the nation?and the mother and the map. This love finds expression in barefoot cartographic practice in an emergent aesthetic of the wounded and dismembered male body centered on the severed head, decapitated torso, bullet-scarred chest, and gushing life-blood locked to the nation's anthropomor phized geo-body The martyred male is a dispassionate carto-graphed body sacri ficed to the untarnished whole that is the national territory. This, barefoot cartographic work seems to suggest, is the ultimate fate of masculine patriotism in modern India?and one that has the blessings even of the apostle of nonvio lence, Gandhi, who in several prints even showers his blessings on such violent expressions of devotion to Bharat Mata. The martyred male body, even when in bits and pieces, invariably appears in a state of perfect composure, devoid of pain or suffering, even taking pleasure in sacrificing itself to the whole that is the nation. It is indeed an exceptional body, prepared to go to bits and pieces so that the body politic does not. At the same time, these pictures disavow the empirical fact of death, as the selfless patriot is shown transcending death by identifying with the greater life of the nation that lives on and, indeed, is renewed by the shedding of his blood. And what of women martyrs in this macabre visual pedagogy constituted around the wounded or decapitated male body in the service of map and mother? Although feminist scholarship has recovered the stories of several women from the 1930s who were involved in anticolonial acts of insurgency to the point of death (Forbes 1980), their passing is not visually celebrated by the barefoot mapmaker in the manner reserved for male martyrs as sacrifice to map and mother. Indeed, in this regard, contrary to Pinney's recent provocative argument (2004) about popular visual culture in India offering an alternative take on the official narrative sketched out by a dominant nationalism, patriotic artists are rather evasive in visualizing the death of the female patriot. To do this would possibly expose Mother India herself to pictorial death and herald the end of the patriotic project. This is why I think that the violent death of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in October 1984 offers a visual dilemma for barefoot cartography. In comparison with the men I have discussed here, and especially unlike the man with whom she shared her famous surname and unlike her equally famous father Jawaharlal, Indira is not a particular favorite of India's patriotic artists, who generally picture her in rather unimaginative and uninteresting ways (Neumayer and Schelberger 2007, 181-92). This was to change after the 1971 Bangladesh liberation war, 16Quoted in Fenech (2000, epigraph).</page><page sequence="28">846 Sumathi Ramaswamy when she came to be likened to the goddess Durga in popular and visual dis courses, her own secular and socialist political inclinations notwithstanding. Popular pictures, political iconography, and the modernist imagination of artists such as Maqbool Fida Husain also consolidated the image of Indira as India, and India as Indira, so that Mother India seamlessly became Mother Indira and vice versa. Indira comes to occupy the map of India in a manner that echoes images of Bharat Mata from earlier in the century. It is such a woman and icon whose violent assassination confronted artists of modern India, and they responded in various ways. On the one hand, Husain painted a series of fascinating abstract images of the event showing Indira's faceless body falling horizontally to the ground. At the other end of visual spectrum, folk artists of Bengal produced a scroll painting narrating the life of the prime minis ter that begins with a carto-graphed Indira holding aloft the Gandhian flag (with its trademark spinning wheel) and ends with her ascent to heaven after her assas sination (Blurton 1989). The poster artists of the bazaar responded in inconsist ent ways to the horror of the assassination. On the one hand, in N. Sharma's Prime Minister of India, which visualizes the life story of the prime minister in a manner akin to L. K. Sharma's picturing of the life of the Mahatma that we saw in figure 2, the fact of her violent death is completely glossed over as Indira's body is shown peacefully at rest (Neumayer and Schelberger 2007, 192). On the other hand, soon after her assassination, the Meerut-based H. R. Raja, who earlier had produced images of the martyrdom of Bhagat Singh, Chandrasekhar Azad, and others, painted Indira Gandhi: Mere Khun Ka Har Katara Desh Ko Mazbut Karega (Indira Gandhi: Every Drop of My Blood Will Strengthen the Nation; see Pinney 2004, 180). As Pinney notes, Indira is reported to have said this ["every drop of my blood will strengthen the nation"] at a rally in Orissa shortly before her death and her supporters believed this to be her premonition of her own murder.... Raja mirrors this linguistic message with a visual trace of Indira's blood?several drops and rivulets at the bottom left of the image?on what must be the surface of the image. Like all his [Raja's] images, this picture lacks depth. Indira is not a body located in three dimension space but a flat representation looking out at the viewer, and the most significant space of the image is not behind the picture plane, but in front, where the blood drips ... In Raja's portrait the only space that matters is that between Indira and the viewer, the space deter mined by her gaze meeting one's own and in which the viewer can reach out and touch the blood on the surface of the image. (2004, 179-80) Raja was heir to a tradition of producing political pictures that did not hesitate to show the martyrdom of men such as Bhagat or Bose in the most macabre manner. And yet, he refuses to show a decapitated or even wounded Indira</page><page sequence="29">Maps, Mother/Goddesses, and Martyrdom in Modern India 847 here, although the very manner of her death, as well as the martyred status she had attained by virtue of such a death, lends itself to such representation. Indira's ruling Congress Party did not, however, hesitate to turn macabre in this regard. Soon after the assassination, a number of street hoardings were put up in public spaces in the South Indian state of Andhra Pradesh during the national elections of December 1984 (which carried the Congress and Indira's son Rajiv to power). These show her dead face in profile, mapped across the Indian geo-body, or the bloodied body of the slain woman occupying a map of India, blood from her wounds dripping profusely down to the map (Rai 2004, 129, 142-43). Inscribed across these hoardings are words from her last speech, "When my life is gone, every drop of my blood with strengthen the nation."17 The most dramatic of such hoardings shows a highly anthropomorphized map of India (colored black) holding the slain body of Indira in its "arms" (figure 3). Blood from Indira's slain body drips down onto the map of India, its red color standing out against the white background of Indira's checked sari and the black map. Tears flow down the map's "face." Inscribed once again in Telugu are Indira's last words: "When my life is gone, every drop of my blood with strengthen the nation." In contrast to the carto-graphed male martyr, who wears an air of serene composure, even nonchalance, Indira's face in these hoardings is contorted and grotesque. This is certainly a body in pain, to draw upon Elaine Scarry's (1985) formulation, not one that seemingly enjoys or transcends it. There is no attempt in these images to flinch from visually imagining "the female subject in her apprehension of pain" (Sunder Rajan 1993, 33). In turn, the death of Mother Indira has transformed the map of India as well in figure 3. Painted a solid, even demonic black, it is simultaneously a geo-body that has been reduced to tears as it clutches at her wounded, bleeding body. The dangers of visualizing the carto-graphed body of any female martyr, but especially someone like Indira, are on full display here. Assimilated as she is into the figure of Mother India so that "India is Indira, Indira is India," the death of Indira also means the potential destruction and demise of Bharat Mata and, hence, of the map of India and the territorial totality that it iconizes. The limits of the barefoot mapmakers patriotism are reached in this hoarding, which runs the risk of pointing to the death of the very mother and map for which many of its martyrs gave up their lives in his visual imagination. The Carto-Graphed Martyr in the Age of the National Picture Every now and then, barefoot mapmaking appears to perform an autocri tique of its own praise practices. A striking illustration published in November I thank Srinivasacharya Kandala for translating the Telugu texts in these pictures.</page><page sequence="30">848 Sumathi Ramaswamy Figure 11.

Does the beautiful lady of our imaginations represent the bare-bodied and bent workers in the fields and factories? Or the small group of those who have from ages past crushed the masses and exploited them, imposed cruel customs on them and made many of them even untouchable? We seek to cover truth by the creatures of our imaginations and endeavor to escape from reality to a world of dreams. (1980, 431) I return us from the world of Indian visual dreams to scholarly reality by focusing on the carto-graphed body of the patriot/martyr, a product of the con tingent intersection of the cultural politics of corporeality and cartography in the age of the national picture. The carto-graphed body of the patriot/martyr, I want to insist, is specifically the outcome of a scholarly exercise in pictorial history, for it is only this kind of historical investigation that brings it to visibility. As Mitchell notes, "An imbrication of the sayable and the seeable, telling and showing, the articulable and the visible occurs at every level of verbal expression, from speech to writing to description, figuration, and formal/semantic structure" (1995b, 542-43). Correspondingly, rarely do images circulate in public spaces without some connection to the verbal and the textual; there are few pure images untouched by the verbal, the discursive, and the linguistic. Pictorial history challenges us to dwell on the overlapping zone between the sayable and the seeable so as to shuttle back and forth between the two. It exhorts us to explore those aspects of the human experience that are unsayable and nonver balizable, but also correspondingly, to come to terms with those that are unpictur able, even unseeable. Such a study compels us to pay attention to phenomena that cannot readily or immediately be translated into language, that are unsayable and only seeable. The image of the carto-graphed patriot/martyr, then, is one such only seeable image. It is the sedimentation of an ineffable surplus that can only be excavated by the practices of a new pictorial history that takes seriously Mitchell's argument that pictures "want equal rights with language, not to be turned into language" (2005, 47).18 Poetry and prose on the patriots and martyrs whom I have considered in this essay abound in the official and sub altern verbal archives of the subcontinent, yet these will not yield the figure of the carto-graphed martyr, which is exclusively a product of the pictorial archive. Such 18As an adjective, "ineffable" refers to that which "cannot be expressed or described in language; too great for words; transcending expression; unspeakable, unutterable, inexpressible," according to the Oxford English Dictionary. Mitchell refers to images as "vehicles of experiences and meanings that cannot be translated into language" (1995a, 208) and as "sedimentations of a non-verbalizable surplus" (2005, 9-10, 344).</page><page sequence="32">850 Sumathi Ramaswamy images recall for me the title of James Elkins s powerful book, On Pictures and the Words That Fail Them (1998). In the visual economy of popular messianic nationalism, to invoke Pinney (2004), Bhagat's death, and the death of other martyrs, made sense only when seen as an act of selfless sacrifice for the mother/land. Ironically, the only way to see that motherland as an integral whole is to resort to the indispensable modern science of cartography, inadequate though that might be in capturing the affective intensity with which the patriot relates to the geo-body of the emer gent nation. And this is because the form of the map alone makes India visible as an integral whole and identifiable as a particular piece of bounded territory on the face of the earth. Barefoot cartographic practice transforms that which is indispensable but inadequate by supplementing the mapped form of the nation with the anthropomorphic presence of Mother India, producing in the process a cartography of affect and patriotic efficacy to counter the impersonal and gridded lines of power of command cartography. Its productions synoptically enframe the map of India, the mother/goddess, and the martyr's body to picto rially show what is unutterable and verbally inexpressible. The carto-graphed body of the martyr with its livid blood dripping down to the map of the nation is the ineffable surplus made visible by the practice of pictorial history. In the words of Tagore's Sandip (with whose pronouncement I began this essay), "Such are the visions which give vigor to life, and joy to death!" (1985, 91).
