<plain_text><page sequence="1">Comment: Letter from Paris Dear H, The Thirteenth Arrondissement of Paris has always belonged to immigrants. In the eighteenth century, it was inhabited by tinsmiths from the Auvergne, masons from the Limousin, stonecutters from Normandy and woodworkers from Savoy. Fleeing the poverty of the provinces, they huddled outside the limits of the city walls in rickety houses built along the banks of a polluted river (the Bi&amp;vre) and across derelict meadows. As late as the 1930s, the area around the portes d'Italie, Choisy and Ivry was a no-man's-land dotted by Gypsy caravans and shacks. Louis-S6bastien Mercier, in his Tableau de Paris (1782-1788) wrote that it was the nastiest, most inflammable and most quarrelsome of the neighborhoods, where the denizens regularly drowned their sorrows in alcohol and even the police feared to tread; Hugo and Balzac in the nineteenth century echoed his sentiments, though with more sympathy and less scorn for its populace. This year, I and my family live in it and so can report that it is much improved, like the chateau just behind the Manufacture des Gobelins where we rent an apartment which only a few years ago was a blackened industrial ruin. But I can also report from having walked hundreds of miles around almost every corner of the Thirteenth that it still in large part belongs to immigrants (like us!) who every day generate novel combinations of Parisian style and imported custom. On the Right Bank of the river Seine, the city of Paris expanded radially after the French Revolution from its ancient center; these new neighborhoods were called "faubourgs" and organized around one street-spoke of the great wheel, like the rue du Faubourg-du-Temple, or the rue du Faubourg-Saint-Antoine. There are seven such streets on the Right Bank, but only one on the Left Bank, where the nineteenth- century expansion was much slower and structured instead around small villages that already existed. Just across the avenue des Gobelins from where we live, the boulevard Saint Marcel runs almost to the Seine, ending where the mental hospital La Piti6-Salpetriere abuts the Gare d'Austerlitz. The village Saint Marcel (also regularly referred to in chronicles as Saint Marceau), famous for its horse market, was enclosed by its own ceinture-wall up until the early seventeenth century. Today the boulevard is graced by two or three seductive bookstores where you can spend too many hours and euros, a statue ofJeanne d'Arc (because the street named after her starts there), and a two-level grocery store where your fully loaded shopping cart can be sent up or down, as</page><page sequence="2">~ Essential Reading from gODINE N Blue Dog, Green River by Brock Brower, illustrations by Nancy Lawton Evoking the majesty and mystery of landscape in the heartland of the American desert, Brock Brower spins a classic tale of a man and his dog, who together must brave the high waters that the canyon lands enfold.

The inhabitants of Saint Marcel were so unruly that they inspired the cruel measure taken in May 1657 and analyzed by Michel Foucault in his History of Madness: all the beggars and prostitutes, as well as anyone apparently mentally ill or criminal, were removed from the streets and permanently stored behind the walls of La Salpetriere. This incarcera- tion proved a fertile breeding ground for madness, and Freud did his internship there two hundred years later. A different kind of measure to improve the tidiness of the quarter, imposed throughout the nineteenth century, was to sow it with the salt of new streets. The avenue des Gobelins dates from this period of renovation, as do the boulevard Arago (lined with horse chestnut trees, now blighted) and the boule- vard Port-Royal (lined with healthier plane trees): they converge just where they intersect the avenue des Gobelins and together become the boulevard Saint Marcel. The five-way intersection is dominated by a McDonald's (which serves beer and wine) and a pigeon hotel: for some reason the trees on the traffic island facing the McDonald's attract all the pigeons in the area for rest and companionship. The renovation continued into the twentieth century. Eric Hazan, whose wonderful historical guide L'Invention de Paris: II n'y a pas de pas perdus (Editions du Seuil, 2002) should be translated into English, grew up here and writes about his neighborhood wistfully: "I remember taking walks with my father that we called 'promenades des Miserables' which led us on Sunday mornings from the rue du Banquier or the rue du Champ-de-l'Alouette, where Marius wandered dreaming of Cosette. The post-WWII destruction of the lower-class neighborhoods of Paris began there, in Saint-Marcel, which never really grasped the situation and continued to be red. During the years 1950-1960, the little streets, the impasses, the courtyards, the workshops of the old, afflicted quarter were systematically destroyed and, given what replaced them, nobody would ever have the idea of going there for a walk." As it happens, we do walk down the rue du Banquier every day. Our two youngest children, on the first day of school, were ejected from the primary school on the boulevard Arago where their classmates were the children of doctors and lawyers, and sent over to the rue Jenner where they learn French in a "cours d'adaptation" along with refugees from Northern African, Eastern Europe, Latin America, and Central Asia. I was cross about this abrupt and unannounced change of plan, mostly because of the dozen conversations I'd had with French adminis- trators from June to September about where my children would go to school, until I realized, after a few weeks, that my children were being taught by a gifted and seasoned veteran who had volunteered for the immensely delicate task of integrating children from all over the world into the French system.

One of my favorites is a surrealist poem by Robert Desnos, "La Fourmi," which asserts that various ants do not exist (fifty feet tall with a hat, pulling a cart loaded with penguins and ducks, fluent in French, Latin and Javanese) and then asks, "Hey, why not?" Moreover, on our way to school along the rue du Banquier and the boulevard de l'H6pital, we pass the workshop of an elderly ebenistewho always waves to the children as he makes and repairs furniture, a green space between two apartment buildings with four linden trees and four cats, and a pocket park with a view of the church of Jeanne d'Arc through a rood screen of Lombardy poplars, where the roses and lavender bloomed all through December. Someone whose work seems to be officially condoned has stenciled lovely graffiti on the collateral streets: there is a rainbow giraffe facing the Mobilier National on the rue de Croulebarbe, an elephant guarding the post office on the rue de la Reine Blanche, and a shadow-man named Nemo fishing as he runs down the traces of vanished stairs on the wall of a bisected building at the top of the rue Pirandello. The stenciled fish swim by placidly, because his line is baited with a flower instead of a hook and fly. Over Christmas, my children turned the whole apartment into a single Metro line, with stations labeled according to categories of Christmas presents (soccer equipment, stuff pertaining to Diddl and Diddlina-German mice with big feet who currently obsess French schoolgirls-and Middle Earth). This spontaneous reorganization of our apartment, while charming, was a big mess; however, it made me realize the extent to which our sense of space has been linearized by frequent use of the Paris M6tro system. Whatever is on "our" line seems close, and we tend to go there more often; the cars trundle along Line 7 (Mairie d'Ivry/La Courneuve) every two to five minutes. By contrast, it usually takes a long time to change Metro lines, especially at the unavoidable junctures of Chatelet, Montparnasse, or Republique; and the busses, whose lines provide woof where the weft of the M6tro doesn't reach, are even slower (but much more scenic), especially at rush hour. So northward we often end up in the Marais or at the Palais- Royal where you can walk right into the Louvre or in the quarter just north of Le Peletier that was called La Nouvelle-Athenes when George Sand and Chopin lived there, and pare Tanguy sold paints to Van Gogh, Cezanne, Renoir and Gauguin, and Delphine Gay entertained Hugo, Musset, Balzac and Lamartine in her salon. But, frankly, most of the time we head south because most of our life takes place in the Thirteenth. Three times a week we go down to the Porte de Choisy for soccer trainings, matches, and tournaments. The entrance to the Stade Georges Carpentier is the eye of a needle through which only one soul can pass at a time, flanked by a big gate that opens electronically but infrequently to admit a car or diminutive truck. Inside are three full- scale soccer pitches whose number can be multiplied by two if the teams play sideways, set off by all6es of plane trees like those along the</page><page sequence="6">MERCER STREET BOOKS Used, Out of Print and Rare Books and Records 206 Mercer Street, New York 10012 (between Bleecker &amp; Houston) 212.505.8615 www.mercerstreetbooks.com Open 7 Days Sunday 11-10 Monday-Thursday 10-10 Friday &amp; Saturday 10-Midnight</page><page sequence="7">12 THE HUDSON REVIEW boulevard Port-Royal. The plane tree is the European cousin of the sycamore; Paul Valery wrote a little paean to it called "La Platane" that captures its aspect very precisely, at once windy and composed: "Reticent, restraining shadow, in which the same bright blue / that carries you away, subsides in peace ..." At the Stade Carpentier we have learned, by force of circumstance if not by heart, to adhere to a certain feature of French life. The children must always arrive at least an hour ahead of time, to avoid being scolded by their coach. The first half-hour is spent on the steps of the office building at the entrance, waiting, apparently so that everyone can shake hands with everyone else. Then suddenly, unheralded, like chromo- somes in a cell about to undergo meiosis, the children line up against the wall and the coaches lead them off to the locker room where they spend another half-hour getting dressed. There may be still one more half-hour to wait while the other team arrives and gets dressed, but not always. After the games, everyone must spend another half-hour to an hour showering; we were sent fierce administrative letters advising us that if our children did not shower with the group, they would not be allowed to play. This tenet posed a problem for my daughter, who is the only girl on her team, but eventually we worked out a solution that, while not strictly permitted, is tolerated. (She goes home sweaty; likewise, the clochards in our neighborhood get to spend the night sheltered under the bushes of the empty lot between our chateau and the Manufacture des Gobelins.) French life is suspended perilously between the ferocity and the toleration of administrators. The avenue de Choisy begins at the western gate of the Stade. The avenue d'Ivry begins at its eastern corner, and they converge a few blocks north at the rue de Tolbiac. With the boulevard Massena, they form a triangle of broad, leafy streets that defines Paris' Asian quarter. It became home to refugees from Cambodia, Vietnam, and China starting in the mid-1970s; bordered by an Italian community around the church ofJeanne d'Arc to the north, and Antillaise and Senegalese communi- ties to the south, its streets offer day and night a mix of nations, colors, and languages, like the rainbows of waiting children that form and re- form against the wall at the entrance to the Stade Carpentier. The office of my research group in history and philosophy of science (REHSEIS / Paris 7 / CNRS-the French love acronyms) as it happens lies in this triangle. The first time I tried to find my office on the map of the Thirteenth, I noticed that its address lay on streets of a different color, which usually indicates a pedestrian zone. But when I arrived at Les Olympiades, a windswept concrete esplanade articulated by thirty-story apartment towers and one-story pagodas sheltering restaurants and shops, I could see no streets. The towers are named after the cities where Olympic games have been held.

So where are the streets? Underground! The whole district, not just Les Olympiades, pursues a great deal of its commercial life one story down. The most impressive such establishment is the depot and hyper-supermarket run by Les Freres Tang, where allegedly most of the proprietors of Asian restaurants in the greater metropolitan area come for provisioning. I personally have bought, directly underneath my office and at modest prices, blue dragon dishes, embroidered handbags, a black silk jacket with tiny gold elephants woven into the fabric, beads (including two hand-blown carp that I made into earrings), a faux-cloisonn6 lamp that looks nice from across the room, and tiny porcelain platters of asparagus, hard-boiled eggs with peas, skewered chicken, and flower- cakes for my daughter's dollhouse. I have also paused uncertainly at the door of the Buddhist temple down there, wondering if the interested passer-by should enter but putting it off for another day or life when I'm better at meditation. The scholar who runs my research group, Karine Chemla, has just published a great tome on the Chinese analogue to Euclid's Elements, Les Neuf chapitres. It is quite a lovely, as well as impressive, work of scholarship, with Chinese characters and diagrams facing the French translation. Raised in a family of Jewish Tunisian immigres, thoroughly Parisian, Karine speaks fluent Mandarin, so it is quite rewarding to visit the restaurants around the avenue d'Ivry with her. And some of our best conversations have been conducted on the edges of the playing fields at Stade Carpentier, watching the clouds and children, and eating frites. Les Neufs Chapitres is dedicated to her nephew Anthony, who is an excellent soccer player. On one corner of Les Olympiades, where the rue de Tolbiac crosses the rue Nationale, stands the M6diatheque Jean-Pierre Melville. It also houses the Bibliotheque Marguerite Durand, one of the few collections in France dedicated to feminism. Durand (1864-1936) started out, like her contemporary Colette, as an actress and journalist. However, when Figaro sent her to do a satiric piece on the International Feminist Congress of 1896, she was converted to a passionate, lifelong and highly politicized commitment to feminism--very much unlike Colette. Durand created her own daily paper, La Fronde, which was published from 1897 to 1905; its various campaigns won women the right to attend the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, to sit in on parliamentary debates, and to receive the L6gion d'Honneur. Durand lobbied hard for the right of women to stand for public office and for the creation of a governmental office to protect working women. She was also a great collector of documents concerned with women and their role in society. She bestowed her collection on the city of Paris in 1931, and herself became director of the first French library devoted to feminism until her death in 1936. Today the director is Annie Dizier-Metz, who has written a life of Durand; the library holds 40,000 books and brochures, 1000 periodical titles, 4000 letters and a splendid iconographic collection of</page><page sequence="10">Tou are invited to attend THE 2005 POETS' PRIZE CELEBRATION HONORING ROBERT WRIGLEY Lives of the Animals: Poems, Penguin Books (2003) AND FINALISTS: JOSEPH HARRISON, Someone Else's Name, Zoo Press TONY HOAGLAND, What Narcissism Means to Me, Graywolf Press JULIE KANE, Rhythm &amp; Booze, University of Illinois Press THURSDAY, MAY 19, 2005 7P.M.

I skirt the Mediatheque whenever I walk straight north from the office to the school on rue Jenner, and its mere existence always cheers me up. Further east, towards the river, is the new Bibliotheque Nationale, named after Francois Mitterand; its collection of 12,000 incunables and a wealth of early printed books makes my medievalist husband happy when he goes over there a couple of times a week to write about Marie de France, Heloise and Abelard, and the Romance of the Rose. He thinks that Heloise had a better philo- sophical grasp of desire than Abelard, because she knew it was uncommanded and uncontainable; and because she understood that other people are not merely ideas, and that reality cannot be added up like a sum. Despite its grand boulevards and cross-town perspectives, a great deal of Paris is hidden away in courtyards, behind forbidding and now electronically coded gates. Thus it is a good idea to visit Paris in October, when the mayor of Paris has organized a long weekend called '"Journees Portes Ouvertes d'Ateliers d'Artistes." For three days, from two in the afternoon until eight in the evening, you can visit some of the most charming hidden corners in Paris, where painters, sculptors, photographers, and graphic artists do their work. Many ateliers are located in houses, so you also catch a glimpse of the artist's life (dogs, children, significant others, furniture, plants). In the early eighties, I had my own courtyard-world across the river in Belleville, so these glimpses evoke for me a special nostalgic glamour. Each arrondissement has its own mayor; ours in the Thirteenth is Serge Blisko. This past October, he convinced 122 artists to exhibit their work in 66 different open-doored ateliers; so on that weekend, I took the "Portes-ouvertes" map with me and steered whatever child I happened to be with into a different world. One block from the entrance to the Stade Carpentier is the allee Marc Chagall, a whole row of artists' dwellings. But it is hidden behind the gates of an apartment complex and lies moreover one story below street level, dotted with potted plants, outdoor furniture, and half-finished objets d'art. We first visited the atelier of Magda Moraczewska, a painter and engraver. There was a young man in her studio, Daniel Bohbot, also listed on the brochure, so we asked him if his work was on display. At this, to the amazement of my two nine-year-olds, he opened up a trapdoor on the floor and took us down a rickety ladder to a windowless sub-basement filled with dozens of enormous oil paintings, each a meditation on what happens to color if it is thrown into a vortex. We asked him how he managed without windows and daylight; he shrugged and lit a cigarette. The smoke drifted around like half a genie, half a wish fulfilled, in Aladdin's cave. Two doors down, the atelier of Michael Bethe Selassi was a zoological garden populated by glossy, brilliant papier-mfiche creatures, striped and spotted, some knee-high and some twelve feet tall. Occasionally, the smaller creatures were thoughts and afterthoughts of the larger, more</page><page sequence="12">EMILY GROSHOLZ 17 anthropomorphic ones and sat on their heads like crowns. The next day, my oldest son and I found another such street at 22, rue Barrault, behind the Butte aux Cailles and the place Paul Verlaine with its red brick Art Nouveau swimming pool. This one is four stories up: a series of little houses with pointed gables like an Alsacian village perched on a roof. There we found the transplanted Dutch painter Jos Verheugen, whose photographic-realist, sometimes surrealist, self-portraits ap- pealed to my son, who is reading Kafka and Gogol. The focal point of the Thirteenth is the place d'Italie, where the Mairie stands across from the Centre Commercial with its palatial movie theater. From this center radiate the boulevard Auguste Blanqui where an open-air market tempts me every Tuesday, Friday, and Sunday morning; the rue Bobillot that defines the Butte aux Cailles; the avenue d'Italie, tracing the Roman road to the south; the avenue de Choisy, bordering Chinatown; the boulevard Vincent Auriol that crosses the Seine just north of the new Bibliotheque Nationale, where over the next few years the wasteland of train tracks will be converted into a waterfront development; the boulevard de l'H6pital that runs by La Pitie-Salpetriere; and finally my avenue des Gobelins that descends to the foot of the rue Mouffetard. When I cross the avenue des Gobelins in the morning to buy pains au chocolat, croissants and beignets (the Platonic form of a jelly donut), I see the dome of the Pantheon on Mont Ste. Genevieve due north, and, due south, the tower of the Centre Commercial. It is an open-face rectangular box with three lattice-work rhomboids suspended inside it, and six lattice-work sticks protruding from it. The "baguettes" explode the form of the box, and the rhom- boids affect its visual volume, like silver goldfish in a straight-sided bowl that only look like they're swimming if you walk around them. It is obviously designed to deconstruct the dome of the Pantheon, which recalls of course the older and flatter dome of the Pantheon in Rome, and so lead us to reflect ironically on the history of European architec- ture. This is a lot to ask of a person who is only trying to cross a wide, swiftly moving avenue to buy breakfast, because in Paris the bread fades more swiftly than Ronsard's roses. But Paris is always posing such questions, which is perhaps the main reason why we are here. EMILY GROSHOLZ</page><page sequence="13">BARNES &amp; NOBLE BOOKSELLERS Presents: Hudson Review Live!
