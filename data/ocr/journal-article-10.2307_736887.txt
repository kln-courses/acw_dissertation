<plain_text><page sequence="1">ALLEMANDE, BALLETTO AND TANZ BY JOAN RlMMER THOSE DANCES headed simply with a national name which have been danced in much of Europe at various times over the past four centuries are a disparate lot. They have ranged from those of regional origin, like 'Allemande' and 'Polonaise', to confections such as 'Anglaise', a contredanse made by European dancing-masters after what was thought to be an English model, and 'Ecossaise' and 'Schottische', contrived in France and Germany respectively and incorporating what were thought to be Scottish elements. In addition there have been regionally distinct varieties of some dance forms: for example, branles of Poitou and Metz, English gigue and French, Viennese and English waltzes. Of all these, the allemande dance-type is the earliest for which a sizeable body of musical notations and a number of dance prescriptions have survived. Though the title of a recent book by Richard Hudson' implies that it is a study of that dance-type, the opening paragraph of his preface makes clear that it is not. The book is 'devoted to the evaluation ofthe Allemande, the Balletto, and the Tanz from 1540 to 1750'. Vol. 1 'presents a prose history of the forms'; Vol. 2 'is an anthology of musical composi? tions'. By 'the forms' the author means the musical forms, for this is primarily a musical study. Would it not have been appropriate to title it as such, thus sparing disappointed ex- pectations in many readers, including this one? Later in the preface one reads 'It is not my intention to list every example, nor even to mention every source'. Since the author does not identify the kinds of material he has omitted, nor the reason for doing so, the non-specialist reader cannot know what is missing. The text is organized in three sections, with several chapters in each. 'The Renaissance' covers the Deutscher Tanz in Germany from 1540 to 1603, the allemande in France and the Low Countries from 1546 to 1615 and the balletto tedesco in Italy from 1561 to 1615; all are for various solo instruments or ensembles. 'The Transition' covers the vocal balletto in Italy in the 1590s with emphasis on Vecchi and Gastoldi; the vocal ballett and instrumental al- main in England from 1550 to 1650; the vocal and instrumental ballet in France from 1603 to 1619; the Tanz, ballet and allmand in Germany from 1598 to 1628; and the balletto in Italy from 1615 to 1640. 'The Baroque Period' covers the allemande in France from 1630 to 1731, the balletto and alemanda in Italy from 1640 to 1730 and the allemande and ballett in Germany and England from 1636 to 1750; again these are all for various solo instruments and ensembles. The preface includes a table showing the delta-like swirling of these varieties around western Europe, and dance prescriptions by Arbeau and Negri are given in facsimile and discussed in the relevant chapters. It would be both unrealistic and ungracious to castigate Professor Hudson for not doing what he did not set out to do: that is, to produce a study-in-the-round of Tanz, almain and balletto and of music associated with or related to them in some way. Nevertheless, certain matters with which he did not concern himself have a fundamental bearing on those with which he did. Meaningful interpretation of a notation, musical or otherwise, is dependent on some degree of acquaintance with the materials and activities that the notation is in? tended to convey. A cooking recipe, for example, is not much use if ingredients, techniques and expectations of taste are unfamiliar. An inescapable ingredient of any kind of dance is its motor impulse, and notations of dance-functional music outside the contexts, past or pre? sent, in which 'everyone knows', are almost meaningless without some indication which reveals that impulse. The only notations in this book which carry tempo indications are of late seventeenth-centurv Italian pieces for bowed strings and continuo. These seem 1 The Allemande, the Balletto, and the Tanz. 2 vols. pp. xiii + 264, xiii + 253. (Cambridge University Press, 1986, ?75.

Is it not the responsibility of an author or editor to provide a tempo, without which a dance-functional or dance- related notation is likely to be meaningless or even misleading to those not already familiar with the dance itself? While the tempo of compositions only loosely related to allemande must indeed have varied according to function, instrument or ensemble and textural treat? ment, music realistically made in that dance rhythm has the appropriate motor impulse built into it. And that impulse has parameters of tempo set by gravity and the mechanics of the human body: there is a point of slowness below which it is simply not possible to execute the characteristic step-units of the allemande or, indeed, any step-unit which incorporates a spring or a hop. In the opening paragraph of the first chapter ('The Deutscher Tanz for Lute, Cittern and Keyboard in Germany 1540-1603') the author states that 'the main dance is in duple meter, with four substantial beats in each measure', a curious description which suggests a slow tempo with emphasis on all four beats. In fact, the substantial beats, or rhythmic emphases, are not in each bar but in each complete musical phrase plus complete step-unit. In the six 4/4 notations of the Prinzentanz given in the first music example, the emphases are on the first beat of alternate bars (tempo: semibreve = c.58-60). All these show the clear, step- related rhythmic structure which was retained in dance-functional allemande music from the mid sixteenth century right into the nineteenth. Without appreciation of this fact, the discussion in Chapter 1 of such matters as 'The Melodies and their Structure', 'The Melodic Cadence', 'The Harmony', 'The Phrases' or 'Coloration' is academic to the point of parody. Discussion of the possible transformation of the Tanz tune into a triple-rhythm Nachtanz and of the latter's tempo relationship to the duple original is equally academic if the tempo of the Tanz itself has not been established. That method of contriving a triple afterdance seems not to have been employed very far into the seventeenth century, but triple (in whatever element) afterdances had not dis- appeared completely by 1603 as Professor Hudson asserts. Many seventeenth- and early eighteenth-century allemandes simply had afterdances made from different melodic material. Among the many dance-functional allemandes from the northern Netherlands are a number followed by 6/4 gigues (one of them made by transforming Arbeau's 'Buffens' tune), a couple followed by passepieds and one by a courante, as in Pietro Paolo Melli's Balletto detto VArdito gracioso of 1615 and Biagio Marini's Balletto sesto alemano et Cor- rente todesco of 1626 (Nos. 86 and 95b in Vol. 2). Yet another has an afterdance in single branle metre, an aspect of tripleness which the author seems not to have identified in some early examples in his second chapter, 'The Almande for Lute, Guitar, Cittern and Instru? mental Ensemble in France and the Low Countries 1546-1603'. Neither of the two pieces entitled 'Allemande' and set for guitar by Guillaume Morlaye (1552: Nos. 38a and b in Vol. 2) has four-bar units throughout. The first has exactly the pattern of the first two sections of the three-section allemande tune given by Arbeau a little over 30 years later: that is, an eight-bar section and a six-bar section. The second section of Morlaye's second allemande is made in the same way as that of his first. Its opening section, however, consists of a repeated unit in single branle metre: that is, a couple of three-bar phrases if notated in 4/4 as in this book.2 The step-unit, one to each musical unit, is double left, plus simple right or en place. The motor impulse is altogether distinct from that of six- bar sections with three two-bar elements, four bars plus two, or two bars plus four. This combination of single branle and Tanz occurs in reverse order in Almande gerre, gerre/ Almande Guerre, guerre gay for four-course cittern in Sebastian Vredeman's book of 1569 (No. 43a in Vol. 2) and with a patriotic text in Adriaen Valerius's Nederlandtsche Gedenck- Clanck of 1626 (Ex. 23a in Vol. 1). One may speculate as to which elements of the south German regional Tanz may have been incorporated into this centuries-old triple-beat struc? ture. The author notices its existence only in connection with Antonio Brunelli's vocal Balletto a5 of 1616, in the chapter 'The Vocal and Instrumental Balletto in Italy 2 In terms of dance structure, single branle is more realistically conveyed by notation in 3/2 with an appropriate tempo indication.

The connections of this balletto with the Tanz/allemande seem tenuous in? deed. Its three items (Ex. 57 in Vol. 1 and No. 88a in Vol. 2) are neat manipulations of a single piece of melodic material into three different dance metres ?single branle (here en- titled 'Ballo grave'), gagliarda and corrente. The triple element becomes not only pro- gressively shorter but also differently stressed in each, from the relentless triple impulse of the single branle, through the alternate-bar emphasis of the galliard to the light triple in the courante. Though it is noted that this kind of adaptive technique was that used to produce the German Nachtanz, the analytical comments provide a striking example of what may result if specific rhythmic skeleton and tune, text and dance tempo are not recognized: The Ballo grave . . . consists of seven three-bar phrases, each ending with a repeated chord. The phrases are so uniform rhythmically that the bass is completely isorhythmic and the other voices nearly so. The last two phrases end with the Tanz cadence, but modified by dotting one of its notes. This is a case of not seeing the branches for the leaves. The Italian text consists of six eight - syllable lines ?a quatrain rhymed abba and an end couplet with new rhyme. In the musical setting the last line is used twice, making seven lines in all; each line is stretched to fit a melodic unit in single branle metre by elongating the third, seventh and eighth syllables. Of course these units are rhythmically uniform, as are those of the dance-functional rumba, waltz, slip jig, strathspey, ratchenitsa etc. Though through-composed melodically, the piece does not consist of 'seven three-bar phrases'. Following the text layout it has 4 + 2 + 1, clearly defined harmonically by perfect cadences in the main tonality at the end of the fourth and seventh lines and an imperfect cadence at the end of the sixth, signalling that although this is the last text line the piece is not yet finished. The author notes that 'the last two phrases end with the Tanz [melodic] cadence'. Though he omits to say so, this is in the Canto Primo, with the double use of the final text line. It is present in the Canto Secondo at the end of every line of the quatrain; only the first line of the couplet is without it altogether. If viewed in isolation, the bass is indeed isorhythmic. But in rhythmic terms the piece is made by juxtaposing three formulas among the four upper voices; only the bass keeps to one throughout. In what sense was there any 'German-ness' in this dance? Was it simply a processional for paired dancers to single branle steps throughout, its relation to Tanz/allemande being in the pairing, the columnar floor pattern and the melodic cadences in the music? The other characteristics of Tanz were a spring or a hop after the last step of each half unit of double branle and a lift of the other leg. In fifteenth-century iconography that lift was a high, vigorous movement by men, obviously much modified by heavily skirted women. In a slow ballo with single branle steps the spring or hop is not likely. But the last two steps in each unit of single branle may well have been embellished with a discreet leg lift instead of a simple close with the foot. Arbeau's dance prescriptions for the almande are interpreted accurately enough in terms of foot placement, but do we really need to be told that 'R' stands for 'right' and 'L' for 'left'? Two complete units of double branle go to the eight-bar first section of music, each half unit ending with the greve (an equivalent of the boisterous knees-up of rustic Tanz) or the more gentle pied en Vair. The six-bar middle section has one complete unit of step and greve followed by one of double branle as in the first section. The eight-bar third section is simply the melodic skeleton of the first; to this is fitted one complete unit of double branle, each step, however, lasting twice as long as in the first section. It could be danced gently, simply resting on each step, or more energetically, with a little spring on each. If the step vocabu- lary given in technical terms by Arbeau and descriptively by Arena more than 60 years earlier3 is applied appropriately to Morlaye's two allemandes of 1552, one finds that the choreography of Arbeau's first two sections fits Morlaye's first allemande, while two units of single branle followed by the choreography of Arbeau's second section will fit Morlaye's second allemande. It is unrealistic to assume, as Professor Hudson does, that there was any such thing as the almande. By the late sixteenth century, dances called 'almande', 'almain' and 'balletto tedesco' were already distant by many decades, if not by more than a century, 3 See 'Antonius Arena: Rules of Dancing', trans. John Guthrie, Dance Research, iv/2 (1986), 3-53. 228</page><page sequence="4">from some exuberant progenitor, and processes of different regional and perhaps personal adaptation had been going on. Hudson attempts to fit Arbeau's almande patterns to Almande Prince, an eight-bar tune with a triple eight-bar reprise. And in his comparison of Arbeau's almande (a simple processional) with Cesare Negri's Balletto detto L'Alemana d'Amore (a complex extended contradance for two couples) the comment that 'In both . . . one or three walking steps lead to a movement that is executed in place without further foot movement' is no more than a non-technical description of step vocabulary documented in writing from the fifteenth century on and, by implication, in dance music and dance texts from the twelfth century on.4 The section entitled 'Social Function and Choreography' in the chapter 'The Ballett and the Almain in England 1550-1650' opens with the words 'The English Almain was one of the most popular social dances of the time', a statement for which no evidence is produced. Though there were many almains in manuscript and printed collections, it seems that the almain had a rather more specialized function than other contemporary social dances, and the section is, in fact, concerned with a specific use, namely in the masques and dance gatherings in the Inns of Court in London. A quantity of musical references and dance prescriptions for these have survived, and they include a number of almains, some of Con- tinental origin.5 The reasons for the use of almain in these affairs are obvious. A con- siderable amount of processional or promenade music was needed, both for entrances and for the slower dances in which spectators joined the masquers. As Professor Hudson remarks in connection with Arbeau's book, but not here, the current genres which filled a proces? sional requirement were pavan and almain. But pavan was not stylistically alterable to any extent, where as almain could be embellished with springs and hops or left plain, and faster and slower forms were available, as they have been and still are in functional military march. Music examples in both volumes give ample evidence of the sedate character of many almains. Sedateness, however, is easily guyed, and the satirical and comic use of almain is one of the aspects not considered to any extent. For example, the Comedians Maske in the Skene manuscript is an almain, and in Coryat's Crambe (1611) there is mention of 'a most mellifluous comical ayre . . . which the vulgar call The Punk's DelighV (punk = harlot) (see Ex. 1). This absurdly pompous almain tune was used in the first edition of Playford's English Dancing Master (1651) for a longways 'for-as-many-as-will' Country Dance. It was marked 'the new way': that is, with a series of figures, no doubt newly composed by one of Playford's dancing-master sources, instead of the old processional form. As was customary with prescriptions for urban Country Dance, only the figures were given, and one may speculate as to whether these were executed with almain step-units. Compared with music in other dance styles, the almain was rarely used for Country Dance in England, and it was generally of a quirky, not a sedate kind. But in the Celtic regions of the British Isles, locally composed sedate almains with jigs as afterdances were still being provided for some patrons well into 4 See D. R. Wilson, 'The Development of French Basse Danse', Historical Dance, ii/4 (1984-5), 5-12, andjoan Rimmer, 'Dance Elements in Trouvere Repertory', Dance Research, iii/2 (1985), 23-34. 5 See D. R. Wilson, 'Dancing in the Inns of Court', Historical Dance, ii/5 (1986-7), 3-16. 229</page><page sequence="5">the eighteenth century,6 and examples were sometimes included in tune repertory books for amateur players of flute, violin and oboe.7 Since most of those that have survived in notation were in harpers' repertories they do not appear in Professor Hudson's section on the Baroque period: he deals only with almains for ensembles and keyboard in England between 1636 and 1750. The last six chapters of Professor Hudson's book are concerned almost entirely with non- dance-functional music, or, at least, music in non-dance-functional presentation, and the great quantity of related notations in Vol. 2 amounts to about two-thirds of the whole. Apart from two pages on 'Musical and Social Function' in the chapter 'The Allemande for Lute, Clavecin, Guitar, Viol and Ensemble in France 1630-1731', there is little discussion of context or choreography. Some imbalance is inevitable, given the nature of the written evidence. But Hudson's terminology and interpretation are sometimes questionable, there are more sources of relevant written evidence than he uses, and there are other kinds of evidence available. In the section entitled 'The Tanz and the Ballett in Southern Germany' it is stated that A transition took place in Nuremberg from 1589 until around 1618 in which the Deutscher Tanz changed its principal medium from lute to ensemble, and its name from Tanz to Ballett. At first, voices and instruments were both employed, in the manner of Gastoldi's Balletti. Then the voices and texts were omitted, leaving a purely instrumental ensemble. Leaving aside the anthropomorphic view of the Deutscher Tanz, the change was not attest- ably in the dance, but in music stylistically derived from or related to it, produced by profes? sional persons for urban consumption according to changing fashions and tastes. Without doubt, some people continued to dance Tanz/allemande-type dances to music sung by the dancers. A description published in 1862 reads: In Gottingen and its surrounding district in the eighties of the last century, people danced an Allemande with Turns, whose text and music is preserved. One couple began the dance, singing the appropriate verse; then followed a dos-a-dos figure accompanied by a single voice. Each couple danced the whole song through, after which they were released, until every couple had performed the dance. The old song . . . is strikingly characteristic of the petit bourgeois taste of that period and that city.8 The text implies six units of single branle to the verse sung by both voices, followed by four complete units of double branle with the man's solo verse and another four with the woman's. The rhythm of the solo verses is comparable with that of some of the earliest notated Tanz tunes (see Ex. 2). In the chapter 'The Allemande in France 1630-1731' it is assumed that 'the choreography of Arbeau and literary references all testify to [the Renaissance Almande's] popularity as a social dance' and claimed that 'It is a matter of surprise, therefore, to discover that the Baroque Allemande, during the very period when it became one of the most frequent and popular movements in the instrumental suite, was, in general, no longer danced in France'. Arbeau's dance prescription and descriptions testify that the almande was in repertory in Provence, not necessarily that it was much danced elsewhere in France, a large country with strong regional cultures, in many of which dance was a significant component. On such evidence as there is about seventeenth-century French dance practice as a whole, it seems likely that urban northern France, to some extent influenced by the fashions of the French court, had a rather different repertory from meridional Provence and Atlantic Brittany (the two regions renowned for dance skill) and also from the eclectic repertory of the Low Coun- tries. In the Netherlands in the later seventeenth century and the early eighteenth, 6 For example, Carolan's Rose Dillon (Ex. 2 in Rimmer, 'Patronage, Style and Structure', p. 165), and Wyres Ned Pugh and Ymdaith Mwngc (seejoan Rimmer, 'Edward Jones's Musical and Poetic Relicks ofthe Welsh Bards: a Re-Assessment', Galpin Society Journal, xxxix (1986), 77-96). 7 For example 'Sheen sheesh igus souse lum' and 'Vaccatu en starri dugh' in J. &amp; W.

In the 1690s, and perhaps even earlier, younger members of the French court were dancing an Englishstyle Country Dance to one of the quirky dotted almains printed in Playford's English Dancing Master (Feuillet later made a French-style contredanse to the same music) and also to Tanz-like music with following gigue. L'Allemande, danse nouvelle, a danse a deux made by Pecour in 1702, is mentioned by Professor Hudson as the only choreography for a French allemande in his chosen period, and he describes the music thus: The melody is marked gaiment and moves mostly in quarter notes and a few eighths, therefore not at all like the usual slow and grave French allemandes that developed at the same time in instrumental music. It is indeed unlike them. But reference to his own first chapter could have shown Professor Hudson its stylistic ancestry. Though cast by its composer or adapter (Louis Lully, not Jean- Baptiste?) in Baroque melodic contours and without the old melodic cadence, it is a seventeenth-century example of Tanz, just as 'Ein Madchen oder Weibchen' is an eighteenth-century example. Together with the slower dance Pecour made to Campra's 'Aimable vainqueur', L'Allemande became hugely popular in social dance, and both were still in the theatrical repertory in Amsterdam in the 1770s. The last chapter ends: Such works [allemande, balletto etc] can be enjoyed exclusively for their individual artistic qualities. I believe, however, that a richness is added to the experience when one understands the history of the form. Then, when one hears the typical cadence, for example, in an Allemande, a Balletto or a Deutscher Tanz, one can remember the evolving tradition and the long and eventful history that began in 1540 in the city of Nuremberg. That history may be likened to a series of interlocking kaleidoscopes rather than an evolving tradition, and it did not end with the allemandes of the eighteenth century. If one can forget the funereal tempo at which the Christmas processional O come, all ye faithful' is now sung, 231</page><page sequence="7">and add to it characteristic English dotting, one has a spendidly quirky almain (compare Ex. 3b with the typical Ex. 3a); the style must still have been familiar in the eighteenth cen? tury when that tune is thought to have been composed; and 'Waltzing Matilda', that musical hallmark of Australia, is also in almain rhythm (see Ex. 3c).

During public celebrations of Lithuania's national day there are street processions in the capital, Vilnius. In one of them, filmed recently for a television series, there was a girls' drum band, dressed in blue uniforms with pillbox hats, tight jackets, flared miniskirts and high boots. The drums were beaten in almain rhythm, and the band processed in old almain steps. The effect was of a sober gaiety quite unlike that of any other western European dance pattern. Was it this characteristic that was found agreeable in much of Europe in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries? Professor Hudson is incurious about such matters; for him, 'forms distributed themselves'. Within its own terms of reference, Richard Hudson's study is most industriously researched and assembled. It is, however, a descriptive, not an interpretative study, and inevitably so, for interpretation of this mass of material needs wider terms of reference. 232</page></plain_text>
