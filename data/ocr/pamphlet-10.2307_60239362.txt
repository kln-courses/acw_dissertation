THE ORIGIN OF THE LORDS. "As far, at least, as our race is concerned, freedom is everywhere older than bondage. It is liberty that is ancient; tyranny that is modern "— E. A. Freeman. WHEN the great St. James's Hall meeting—the most intelligently revolutionary that has been held in the metropolis for half a century—unanimously voted in August last that the " House of Peers in Parliament is useless and dangerous, and ought to be abolished," it was noted by the Times, as a small crumb of consolation, that the naughty agitators had, after all, like true Englishmen, tallen back on a precedent more than two centuries and a quarter old. It was so, and so it always will be, in this "land of just and old renown." We cannot and do not wish to get beyond our precedents. It is the Peers and their apologists that are the dangerous innovators. We Revolutionists stand by the most ancient polity of the English People. What was that polity towards which, during more than eight centuries of struggle, the soundest portion of the nation has ever striven consciously or unconsciously, to revert Its rough outlines we now fortunately know, thanks to the de¬ voted labours of a little band of learned historic investigators. In England, before the Norman Conquest, there were practically three orders of men—the Thanes, the Ceorls, and B 2</page><page sequence="4">THE ORIGIN OF THE LORDS. the Slaves. Neither the Thanes nor the Slaves were a numerous class. Any Ceorl might become a Thane by acquiring five hides of land (600 acres), with whatever privi¬ leges attached to Thaneship. The slaves were either con¬ quered Celtic Britons or Saxon felons judicially condemned to penal servitude. The really important class were the Ceorls, most of whom owned and cultivated their own little farms, like the American homesteaders of the present day, the basis of their tenure, however, being mostly communal. "They were," saysHallam, " the root of a noble plant, the free socage tenants or English yeomanry, whose independence has stamped with peculiar features both our constitution and our national character." Alas! where are the yeomanry of England to-day Swallowed up in the devouring maw of the aristocracy, five hundred of whom, calling themselves peers or hereditary legislators, have possessed themselves of from one-sixth to one-fifth of the entire national soil! Out of 509 Peers 438 hold 14,250,000 acres. To these 438 untoiling lilies of the field the cultivators, or rather the consumers of agricultural produce, pay a yearly tribute called rent, of ^12,000,000 sterling Verily, if the Lords court destruction, they cannot do better than appeal to antiquity and precedent. They are careful, however, never to go beyond the hateful period of the thirteenth century, when the systematic oppression of the English people first became a hereditary trade on the part of kings and aristocrats. Even in Saxon England it is not to be concealed that the fatal virus of aristocracy had begun to circulate through the veins of society. According to the earliest records, many of the Ceorls had become annexed to the lands of the more powerful Thanes, to whom they were bound to render certain services. But in other respects the most dependent of the Ceorls were personally freemen and citizens. They were as " law-worthy " as the Thanes. The weregild, or composition for the slaying of a Ceorl, was 200s., payable to his family and not to his lord, as in the case of a slave. He was a legal witness. He had the right to bear arms. He was eligible for every magisterial office, and, as has been said, no barrier of birth or rank prevented him from becoming a Thane. He enjoyed in full all the local franchises in mark, hundred,</page><page sequence="5">THE ORIGIN OF THE LORDS. and shire, and he was, at all events constructively, repre¬ sented in the Grand National Council or Witanagembt (the Assembly of the Wise). The powers of the Witan were most extensive : (i.) They elected kings. (2.) They deposed kings if their rule was injurious to the people. (3.) They and the king appointed to vacant sees. (4.) They regulated eeclesiastical income and expenditure. (5.) They and the king levied the taxes. (6.) They and the king raised land and sea forces. (7.) They controlled the use of the national domain (folcland). (8.) They forfeited the lands of offenders and intestates. (9). They could revise every public act of the king. (10.) They considered, and with the king, promulgated every new law. (n). They made treaties. (12.) They were the Supreme Court of Justice civil and criminal. The unit of ancient English Society was the mark of township. Then came the hundred, consisting of an un¬ certain aggregate of townships. Similarly the shire embraced so many hundreds, and the entire kingdom was made up of the totality of shires. In the Moot, Gem6t, or Council, of mark, hundred, shire, and kingdom, every freeman had a right to an equal voice. On this all-important point there is hardly the vestige of a doubt. Universal suffrage is the birth-right of which more than " two millions of capable citizens " are at this moment shamefully deprived by their Hereditary Rulers. A charter of iEthelstan, a.d. 931, was confirmed " totd plebis generalitate ovante " (by the whole body of exulting Commons); while another Act, passed by the Witan sitting at Winchester in 934, is described as being executed " totd populi genemlitate " (by the entire body of the people). With regard to such declarations as the latter, the learned and cautious Kemble observes:—" Whether expressions of this kind were intended to denote the actual presence of the people on the spot, or whether populus was used in a strict and technical sense—that sense which is confined to those who enjoy the full franchise —or, finally, whether the assembly of the Witan making laws is considered to represent, in our modern form, an assembly of the whole people, it is clear that the power of self- government is recognised in the latter." Indeed, so much was this the case, that even after the Conquest, in 1086, in the reign</page><page sequence="6">THE ORIGIN OF THE LORDS. of the Conqueror, and again in 1116, in the reign of Henry I., Gem&amp;ts, Communia Concilia, or Parliaments (so called for the first time in 1246), were convened on Salisbury Plain, con¬ sisting of all the land-owners of the realm, whether tenants of the Crown (in capite) or sub-tenants. On the former occasion it was computed that no fewer than 60,000 hon. members put in an appearance But this was precisely the weak point in the early English democracy. Such assemblies might sanction laws; they could not make them. They had all the vices of the Roman Comitia, which inevitably lost their authority, to the destruc¬ tion of every popular liberty, just in proportion as the dominions of Rome were extended. A form of government in which every freeman represented himself was perfectly feasible in the moot of the mark, of the hundred, or even of the shire ; but in the moot of the nation it was bound, for the most obvious reasons, to fail. Yet, in the light of modern experience, this failure, fraught with its baleful train of all but ineradicable evils, was suscep¬ tible of easy prevention. Though every free man could not be personally present in the grand council of the nation, he might, from the earliest times, have been so by his delegate; and nothing is more astonishing, in the whole political his¬ tory of the human race, than that this seemingly obvious ex¬ pedient was never seriously tried till the immortal Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester, made it current coin. One almost grudges this bright particular star to the aristocracy. It is some consolation, however, to reflect that he was a Frenchman by birth. In 1265 this great man, convoking the first genuine House of Commons, solved a problem which had baffled the best in¬ tellect of Greece and Rome, and which, left unsolved, would, in all human probability, have found the England, and indeed the Europe, of to-day the hopeless prey of kings, priests, and aristocrats—that grand trinity of social and political evil. What Earl Simon did was to reduce the abstract right of every Englishman to a voice in the Grand Council of the nation—a right which had never been abrogated—to some¬ thing like a practical reality. The Commons—the communitas cotnmimitatum of boroughs and shires—is the true Witanagem&amp;t of pre-Norman England, and not the House of Lords, which</page><page sequence="7">THE ORIGIN OF THE LORDS. 7 is but an ugly wen or defacement of comparatively recent growth. Let us now see through what national misfortunes, by what crafty devices, Englishmen have come to be saddled with the crushing load of royalty and aristocracy, which to this day weighs them down body and soul. Our forefathers' failure to discover the true principle of national representation was the grand opportunity of kings, priests, and aristocrats. They took upon themselves to manage the people's affairs—not, of course, in the people's interest, but their own. The kings, whose office was originally strictly elective and revocable by the Witan—amounting, in fact, to little more than a republican presidency—first laid claim to the whole kingdom and all its inhabitants as a hereditary fief, and ultimately, under the Stuarts, as a gift to them and their ancestors from Almighty God. The king's comitates, or courtiers, were not slow to follow so excellent an example. They set up as hereditary peers and oppressors of the people, each in his own corner of the unfortunate country, which had at one time so richly promised to become the chosen home of freedom. It was but the other day that the Duke of Portland gravely announced the divine right of dukes to legislate for the people The process by which the aristocracy accomplished their nefarious ends was simple enough. Meetings of the Common Council of the Realm, both before and after the Conquest, were frequent enough; but, except on occasions of the greatest importance, they were unattended except by the king, the ealdormen (governors of shires) the king's thanes, the bishops and abbots, and the inhabitants of the immediate neighbourhood—Winchester, Gloucester, and Westminster generally—in which the assembly was held. Poverty and distance prevented even the lesser thanes from ordinarily participating in the national councils in any numbers. " The largest list of signatures," says Kemble, "which I have yet ob¬ served is 106; but numbers varying from 90 to 100 are not uncommon, especially after the consolidation of the mon¬ archy." Every freeman had the right to attend, and in theory every freeman, present or absent, did give his consent, his "Yea, yea," or his "Nay, nay." But "such right of attendance," says Freeman, with reason, " of course became purely nugatory. The mass of the people could not attend: 1*1</page><page sequence="8">3 THE ORIGIN OF THE LORDS. they would not care to attend; they would find themselves of no account if they did attend. They would, therefore, without any formal abrogation of their right, gradually cease from attending. By this process an originally demo¬ cratic assembly, without any formal exclusion of any class of its members, gradually shrunk up into an aristocratic assembly." Thus, by degrees, under the Norman Kings, the People's Land (Folcland) became the King's Land (Terra Regis), and the Council of the Wise (Witanagem6t) became the King's feudal Court (Curia Regis). Those councillors honoured with a personal writ, the " majores barones," became Hereditary Peers; while those summoned generally by the sheriff fell back into the unprivileged mass. The division of Parliament into two Houses, which consti¬ tutionalists would have us believe is an almost divine arrangement, had its origin in the meanest and most selfish of human motives. At first, after Earl Simon's reforms, the barons and the knights of shires voted and probably deliberated together, the clergy by themselves and the burgesses by themselves. Each order assessed itself. In 1333 the barons, knights, and clergy each contributed one-fifteenth of their substance, while the burgesses gave one-tenth. On this occasion the knights and burgesses deliberated together, but voted separately. There was no fixed order of procedure. The barons are believed to have assembled at the top of Westminster Hall, and the burgesses at the foot. After 1347 the knights and burgesses habitually deliberated together, and the clergy and barons together. Mutual jealousy, and not statesmanlike foresight, thus divided Parliament in two. But if the existence of a Second Chamber in any form is, so to speak, an unconstitutional departure from the One-Chamber Legislative system of our forefathers, a House of Hereditary Legislators is a still more extraordinary and unwarrantable innovation. How could such a monstrously irrational claim ever have come to be set up Who is responsible for it As usual, the lawyers. These unscrupulous allies of wealth and power in all ages of the world's history, came to lay down the singular doctrine that if the Crown once summon a man to the National Council, it must go on summoning his</page><page sequence="9">t THE ORIGIN OF THE LORDS. 9 representatives, however unfit, morally or intellectually, down to the latest generation. " Woe unto you lawyers for ye have taken away the key of knowledge." Yet, strange to say, Mr. Gladstone, wielding the prerogative of the Crown, might make every elector, and, for matter of that, every non-elector, in England a peer to-morrow ; and, according to the lawyers, all the first-born males of such noble lords would be entitled to succeed them as hereditary legislators. In Magna Charta, chapter xiv., King John stipulated as follows:—" We shall cause the archbishops, bishops, abbots, earls " (then governors of counties), " and greater barons to be separately summoned by our letters. And we shall cause our sheriffs and bailiffs to summon generally all others who hold of us in chief." It would thus appear that even at the date of the charter (1215) men were summoned to the Commune Concilium Regni by virtue of office and by classes, and not in consequence of birth. Indeed it was not till the reign of Richard II. (1377-99) that we find the absurd principle of heredity in full swing. The introduction of representative members into Parliament by Simon de Montfort doubtless suggested to the usurping oligarchy the idea of a hereditary chamber as an invincible barrier to further democratic progress. The privileged simulacrum should have been abolished when Earl Simon resuscitated the old popular assembly of our pre-Norman forefathers. It has not even so much as a historic raison d'etre. The House of Lords is merely a stand¬ ing embodiment of the usurpation and confiscation of ancient democratic rights by the greater barons, Court officials, and ecclesiastics, who alone were able, in consequence of their superior wealth and leisure, to attend the national council with some degree of regularity. It is merely a gigantic national fraud. If the Peers and not the Commons are the old Witanagemot as has been asserted, then historically every British elector, however humble, has a right to claim a seat in the Gilded Chamber. In throwing out the Franchise Bill, they should have done so totd plebis generalitate. Having thus briefly traced the origin of the so-called Upper Chamber of the Legislature, I shall in subsequent chapters show in some historic detail that it is not less objec¬ tionable in practice than it is irrational in theory.</page><page sequence="10">10 CHAPTER II. BLUE BLOOD. " I will have never a noble, no lineage counted great; Fishers, and choppers, and ploughmen shall constitute a state. And lo and behold! how these poor men shall govern the land and sea, And make just laws beneath the sun as planets faithful be." —Emerson. TH ERE is nothing more unaccountable than an English¬ man's proverbial love for a lord. It is a sentiment con¬ demned alike by the absurdity of the principle—if principle it can be called—of legislative heredity, and by the history of the peerage itself. It is equally repugnant to the precepts of Christianity and the dictates of common sense. " Be ye not called Rabbi, Rabbi," said the Divine Democrat; " neither be ye called master, for one is your master, even Christ, and all ye are brethren." If England were what she professes to be—a Christian State—she would most certainly recognise no titles of nobility. The able men who founded the mighty Republic of the West, as might have been expected, were not slow to exclude the pagan poison of aristocratic nomenclature from the Constitution of the United States. Article I., section 9, provides: " No titles of nobility shall be granted by the United States; and no person holding any office of profit or trust under them shall without the consent of Congress accept of any title of any kind whatever from any king, prince, or any foreign State." Well has Mr. Lowell written— " There is more in names Than most men dream of; and a lie may keep Its throne a whole age longer if it skulk Behind the shield of some fair-seeming name."</page><page sequence="11">BLUE BLOOD. II True, " my lord" is but a word; but words, though the slaves of the wise, are the tyrants of fools ; and we have it on the high authority of the late Thomas Carlyle that the people of these islands are unfortunately "mostly fools." I know a member of the present Liberal Administration, in other respects by no means an imbecile, who habitually quotes the worthless opinions of worthless " lords " of his acquaintance as if they had just dropped from the lips of a Socrates, a Confucius, or a Marcus Aurelius. The haughty Earl of Chatham and the Laodicean Palmerston were equally the victims of this strange disease of aristocracy. A gracious word from the second bestial Guelph would transport the elder Pitt with unspeakable delight, while the displeasure of the late Prince Consort was enough to make case-hardened " Pam " weep like a baby. Even at this moment it is but too evident that Ministers are anxiously seeking to devise means to extricate the Peers from the perilous position in which their insolent opposition to the enfranchisement of " two millions of capable citizens " has placed them. That Lord Hartington, the heir to a great duke¬ dom, chiefly carved out of stolen Church property, should advise surrender to the peers is intelligible enough. But what said Mr. Chamberlain, the most democratic member of the Cabinet, at Hanley " We begrudge the Lords nothing that rightly belongs to them—their rank and titles, their stars and garters—any power that they may secure by long prescription and high station," &amp;c. The President of the Board of Trade has seemingly forgotten that noble Lords, inasmuch as " they neither toil nor spin," can have very little that " that rightly belongs to them." Is this the voice of Birmingham This the doctrine of the Caucus What the people had a right to expect Mr. Chamberlain as the Coming Man to say was—"We be¬ grudge the Lords whatever does not rightly belong to them : to wit, their rank and titles, their stars and garters, and any power secured by long prescription or high station." It is precisely against these usurped possessions that the people are striking at this moment. It is hard to say whether the social or the political influence of an aristocracy is more in¬ jurious to a nation. The former produces snobs, the latter serfs, and a snob is first cousin to a serf all the world overt</page><page sequence="12">12 BLUE BLOOD. When Cromwell told a great Duke that England would never be well till his Grace was called plain Mr. Montagu he spoke the true language of democracy. It was found next to impossible to keep the Israelites of old from relapsing into the most degrading forms of idolatry. So long as a " grove " or a " high place " was left in the land, so long must they follow after strange gods. And so with this deep-seated English malady of lord-worship. Until the great high place of aristocracy at St. Stephen's—the centre and source of the contagion—is utterly cast down, there is no hope of moral health for the English people. " When I was a child," said the apostle, " I thought as a child; but whai I became a man I put away childish things." Shall it never be given to Englishmen to put away the childish things of aristocracy, and assert the imprescriptible Rights of Man In theory, no rational being can defend a government by hereditary legislators. Born law-makers, born law-obeyers If Lord Salisbury and his fellow peers were born to rule the people, then it follows, as the night day, that the people were born to obey my Lord Salisbury and company. Hereditary bondsmen we What is this but palpable tyranny And worse, it is the most stupid and irrational tyranny that could possibly be invented. See yonder birkie ca'ed a lord, Who struts and stares and a' that; Though hundreds worship at his nod, He's but a coof for a' that. The business of government, it will be generally conceded, demands some small degree of intelligence, knowledge, and wisdom; but the hereditary principle provides for none of these things. Our kings and peers—they are both in the same boat-—inherit power over their fellows not because they are wiser and better than the multitude, but because they have, or are supposed to have, a certain pedigree like a prize ox or stallion. Englishmen are ruled, not by rational but by animal succession; and, strange to say, while all the world wonders and jeers, we go on pluming ourselves on this very " peculiar institution." We know very well that the peerage contains some of the greatest rascals and fools in the realm, but that signifies nothing. So long as they keep out of gaols and lunatic asylums, the Duke of Portland has</page><page sequence="13">BLUE BLOOD. explained to us, they have a divine commission to deprive " two millions of capable citizens " of the franchise, or any other right to which the subject multitude may lay claim. Lord Salisbury has laid the country under a heavy debt of gratitude. He has made it plain to all men that the hereditary principle and the representative principle in government are absolutely antagonistic. He has arrayed the aristocracy against the people, the patricians against plebeians, the privileged few against the unprivileged many. Since the Revolution of 1688 it has been the cue of our hereditary rulers to absorb the energies of the English people in crushing the freedom of foreign States. They have now happily had the hardihood to call on us to fight for our own liberties at home. It is a battle worth righting, and it behoves all good democrats to buckle on their armour for the tray. Let us see, then, who are our antagonists. Whence their origin What their antecedents According to themselves, they " came over at the Conquest " with Norman William, and, for the nonce, I shall take them at their word. In " The New Book of Kings," to which this booklet is a sequel, it was shown that this William was a blood-stained ruffian of the deepest dye, who seized on the throne of England without a jot or tittle of legal or moral right. He pretended that the last English king—Edward the Confessor—had left him his heir by will, but he never could be induced to produce the document, and it is certain that Edward, with his last breath, recommended Harold as his successor to the Witan, or National Council, by whom he was unanimously elected king. To begin with, therefore, every man who accompanied William in his filibustering expedition was simply an undis¬ guised robber. Plunder was the sole object. But were they not high-class robbers Were they not Norman chivalry? To this the answer is that, as a rule, they were neither Normans nor chivalrous. An entire wing of William's army at Senlac consisted of Bretons, another was composed of Gascons. Thierry, in his " Histoire de la Conquetede l'Angleterre," throws a flood of light "on the origin of our " Old Nobility." " William," he tells us," " looked far beyond the confines of Normandy for soldiers of fortune to</page><page sequence="14">14 BLUE BLOOD. assist him in his great attempt. He had his ban of war published in all the neighbouring countries. He offered good pay to every tall, robust man who would serve him with lance, sword, or crossbow. A multitude flocked to him from all parts, from far and near, from the north and from the south. They came from Maine and Anjou ; from Poitou and Bretagne; from the country of the French king and from Flanders; from Acquitaine and from Burgundy; from Piedmont beyond the Alps, and from the banks of the Rhine. Adventurers by profession, the idle, the dissipated, the profligate, the enfans perdus of Europe, hurried at the summons. Of these some were knights and chiefs in war, others simple foot-soldiers. Some demanded regular pay in money, others merely their passage across the Channel, and all the booty they might take. Some demanded territory in England—a domain, a castle, a town ; while others simply wished to receive a rich Saxon lady in marriage. All wild wishes, all the pretensions of human avarice, were awakened into activity. William repulsed no one, but promised and pleased all so far as he could." But though the bulk of the invaders thus consisted of the moral debris of Europe, it is undoubtedly true that the nucleus of the expedition was Norman, or, to be strictly accurate, Danish. For centuries the Danish pirates had been the scourge of Christendom. They were justly dreaded more than wolves, famine, and pestilence combined, and the Conquest of England was in reality their greatest and most disastrous outrage on humanity. " Make up your minds to fight valiantly," William told his followers at Hastings, "and slay your enemies. A great booty is before us; for if we conquer, we shall all be rich. What I gain, you will gain. If I take this land, you will have it in lots among you. Know ye, however, that I am not come hither solely to take what is my due, but also to avenge our whole nation for the felonies, perjuries, and treacheries of these English. They massacred our kinsmen, the Danes—men, women, and children—on the night of St. Bryce," &amp;c. From the bloody Danes, then—a name of horror and detestation throughout Christendom—our hereditary rulers, according to their own showing, are descended. Credulous historians—and no country was ever cursed with a body of</page><page sequence="15">BLUE BLOOD. 15 more incompetent and self-deluded annalists than England— of course contrive to conceal this damning fact in regard to the origin of the peerage. They pretend that in their Neustrian home these incarnate Danish fiends suddenly acquired the humanity of Christians and the refinement of gentlemen. Nothing could be further from the truth. Mr. Freeman, who is not altogether free from the super¬ stition that the Normans were " chivalrous," gives the following account of William de Belesme, surnamed Talvas, a typical specimen of the people " whose peculiar mission it was," according to Mr. Froude, " to govern men ; "—" With Ivo the virtue of his race seems to have died out, and his descendants appear in Norman and English history as monsters of cruelty and perfidy, whose deeds aroused the horror even of that not over-scrupulous age. Open robbery and treacherous assassination seem tojhave been their daily occupation. The second of the line of William of Belesme had rebelled against Duke Robert, and had defended his fortress of Alencon against him. His eldest son, Warren, murdered a harmless and unsuspecting friend, and was for this crime, so the men of the age said, openly seized and strangled by the fiend. Of his other sons, Fulk, presuming to ravage the ducal territory, was killed in battle. Robert was taken prisoner by the men of Le Mans, and beheaded by way of reprisal for a murder committed by his followers. The surviving heir of the possessions and of the wickedness of his race was his one remaining son, William Talvas. This man, we are told, being displeased with the piety and good manners of his first wife, Hildeburgis, hired ruffians to murder her on her way to church. At his second wedding feast he put out the eyes and cut off the nose and ears of an unsuspecting guest. This was William, the son of Geroy. A local war ensued, in which William Talvas suffered an inadequate punishment, for his crimes in the constant devastation of his lands. At last a more appropriate avenger rose from his own house. The hereditary wickedness of his line passed on to his daughter Mabel and his son Amulf. Arnulf rebelled against his father, and left him to die wretchedly in exile. An act of wanton rapacity was presently punished by a supernatural avenger. Arnulf, like his uncle Warren, was strangled by a demon in his bed.</page><page sequence="16">l6 BLUE BLOOD. Such was the character of the family whose chief, first in power and in crime among the nobility of Normandy, stood forth as the mouthpiece of that nobility to express the feelings with which the descendants of the comrades of Rolf looked on the possible promotion of the tanner's grandson to be their lord." Ab uno disce omnes. No just writer would voluntarily dwell on the infamous origin and history of the hereditary branch of the legis¬ lature. Birth implies neither merit nor demerit on the part of him that is born. It is an event for which the Lord of Hatfield and the meanest beggar that ever ventured to knock at his gate—if any beggar ever had the presumption—are equally irresponsible. " 'Tis only noble to be good," as Lord Tennyson has most truly taught us. " Not all that heralds rake from coffined clay, Nor florid prose nor honied lies of rhyme, Can blazon evil deeds or consecrate a crime." Still, though ' the Grand old Gardener and his wife may smile at Lady Clara Vere de Vere's claims of long descent,' they are an exceptionally rational British couple. Suffice it for such to know that " God has made of one blood all the nations of the earth; " that there is no family in the land that can lay claim to a higher antiquity than Adam or the anthropomorphic ape; and that he is indeed a wise child who knows his own father. But unfortunately even now the Executive Government of the country, when it summons a man for the first time to the Upper House of the Legislature, ignores every dictate of reason, experience, and common sense. It not only creates one more irresponsible legislator, but it is stoutly affirmed by lords and lawyers that not even the Crown can prevent the new peer's representatives, be they fools or knaves, from ruling over the people as hereditary legislators down to the latest generation. In these singular circumstances it becomes a public duty to show that the lordly offspring of this extra¬ ordinary State arrangement have for the most part been fools or knaves, totally unworthy of the respect of any thinking man or woman. There is not a crime against public liberty nor an offence against private morality that cannot be laid at the door of</page><page sequence="17">BLUE BLOOD. 17 the Peers in their collective or individual capacity. It would puzzle the cleverest advocate of the hereditary principle to point to a single act of self-sacrifice or dis¬ interested patriotism that can fairly be ascribed to the Peers during their long monopoly of power and place from the Con¬ quest down to the present day. " Long prescription," so far as individual families are con¬ cerned, is a fiction ; the pride of birth is a mere childish conceit; pedigrees are the fables of the College of Heralds. We know the historj. of 2,500 peerages which neither the ingenuity of the heralds nor the theory of Malthus has been able to save from extinction. Every man for certain has had one mother, two grand¬ mothers, four great - grandmothers, eight great-great- grandmothers, and so on. Indeed, if the progression is worked backwards for a few thousand years, it will be pretty evident that all the daughters of Adam have been powerfully co-operating to bring any individual man of this generation into being. But as to fathers—or, at all events, as to grand¬ fathers—it is no cynicism to affirm that there is nothing but profound uncertainty. Where are the Miltons, Shaksperes, Bacons, Newtons—nay, whither have the Carlyles and Mills vanished Talk of coming over at the Conquest! There is not an English peerage in existence that has any but the most fanciful or mendacious claim to come within five centuries of that disastrous event. George III. alone was responsible for 522 creations! According to a current analysis of the peerage, 5 creations are of the thirteenth century ; 6 of the fourteenth ; 11 of the fifteenth; 18 of the sixteenth; 45 of the seventeenth; 126 of the eighteenth; and 293 of the nineteenth. But such reputedly old peerages as those of Hastings and De Ros (1264) are in reality quite modern creations. The true De Ros line, after the most extraordinary wanderings and pirouettings among Mannerses, Cecils, and Villierses, was so completely ex¬ tinguished with the second Villiers, Duke of Buckingham, that even the heralds of that day could not discover an heir to the title. George III., however, in 1806 was equal to the occasion. He found the long-lost De Ros straying about disconsolate somewhere, and restored him to his functions of hereditary c</page><page sequence="18">IS BLUE BLOOD. ruler. His descendant was convicted of card-cheating thirty years ago. The Hastings imposture was even more flagrant. The true Hastings had disappeared for centuries of usurping Le Stranges, Yelvertons, Stubbses, Cokes, Calthorps, Norths, Pratts, Stylemans, and Watlingtons, when Queen Victoria had the sagacity to detect in one Jacob Astley a descendant of a certain Sir John Hastings, who was favoured with a writ from Edward I. Indeed the antiquity of the peers is from beginning to end a gigantic hoax, credited by none but the most credulous, foolish, and vain of mankind. Like other superstitions of a less mundane character, it dies hard. " Almost the whole town," observes Mr. Byends in the Pilgrim's Progress, " are my kindred, but in particular my Lord Turnabout, my Lord Time-server, my Lord Fair' speech; also Mr. Smoothman, Mr. JFacing-both-ways, Mr. Anything; and the parson of our parish, Mr, Two Tongues, was my mother's own brother by father's side ; and to tell you the truth, I am become a gentleman of good quality; yet my great-grandfather was but a waterman, looking one way and rowing another, and I got most of my estate by the same occupation."</page><page sequence="19">ig CHAPTER III. OUR OLDEST NOBILITY AT WORK. Bleed, bleed, poor country Great tyranny, lay thou thy basis sure, For goodness dare not check thee FOR more than eight centuries of dishonour the story of our Old Nobility is one of all but uninterrupted and, alas! generally successful crime. It divides itself naturally into four well-marked epochs. In the first period, covering the times of Norman and Plan- tagenet royalty, they struggled fiercely to subjugate the monarchy to their purposes, and while thus engaged they occasionally forgot to oppress the people. Nay, they were even at times constrained to invoke their aid when the royal tyrant of the day proved too strong for them. At this stage in their career they were cruel, fierce, and bloody, like the robber horde from which they sprang. Eventually, in the War of the Roses, they succeeded in completely exterminating each other, literally verifying the profound saying of Christ, " He that taketh the sword shall perish by the sword." A very different order of men were the lords of the Tudor and Stuart regimes. These were mostly parchment-made nobles, mean, crawling courtiers, who lived to register royal decrees, and to go cringingly to the block for any offence, real or imaginary, which it pleased royalty to lay to their charge. The kings oppressed them, and they in turn avenged themselves, to the best of their ability, by oppressing the people. When the latter rose against the tyranny of C 2</page><page sequence="20">20 OUR OLDEST NOBILITY AT WORK. Charles Stuart, the peers had neither the courage to strike for the Crown nor for national freedom. They were the veriest poltroons that ever figured in a great constitutional crisis. Howbeit, adversity taught them not manly wisdom, but a species of low, aristocratic craft, which has stood them in good stead ever since. In 1688, when the third epoch began, they ventured on a make-believe, rose-water Revolution of their own. They contrived to convince the soft-headed mass that they were their best friends—the champions of every rational liberty. The power which they could not retain by force they rendered doubly secure by fraud. They stripped the Crown of nearly all its possessions, and made it a pauper on the bounty of the people. They pensioned themselves almost to a man for their services, and monopolised nearly every office of honour and emolument in Church, State, army and navy. To con¬ ceal their rogueries at home they plunged the nation into endless wars abroad. In the fourth era, i.e., since the Reform Act of 1832, they have persistently obstructed and minimised every good measure, while intensifying the worst features of the worst Bills that have come before them. At all times they have been the unswerving foes of freedom to the full limit of their capacity. It is impossible for any one who knows their story and loves his country to regard them as other than public enemies of the most malignant type. First Epoch (1066—1485). William the Conqueror was not merely a man of blood and iron, he was one of the craftiest villains that ever breathed. When he invaded England, he actually contrived to figure in the character of a Crusader. He brought with him a banner consecrated by the Pope and a ring containing a hair of St. Peter How he managed to possess himself of these important credentials it is not difficult to fathom. Edward the Confessor had an unfortunate early contracted partiality for Norman priests, whom he promoted with little discrimination to English benefices. They were animated by all the predatory instincts of their race, and soon became so universally odious that the Witan or Parliament met and out¬ lawed the whole tribe. Robert, Archbishop of Canterbury,</page><page sequence="21">OUR OLDEST NOBILITY AT WORK. 21 and William, Bishop of London, armed their retainers and fought their way to the coast " with apostolic blows and knocks." They carried their grievances to Rome, where they had no difficulty in inducing Christ's vicegerent to bestow his blessing on William's unhallowed enterprise. Had Christ himself been addressed on the subject he would probably have replied. " He that taketh the sword shall perish by the sword "—" My kingdom is not of this world." But then the Divine Democrat was so very unlike any of his professed followers that his judgments hardly count. After the battle of Hastings and the death of Harold, William proceeded to carry fire and sword through the land in true Danish style. He burned Romney and massacred the inhabitants; he set fire to Dover and advanced on London. The great city, however would not open its gates. In revenge he burned down Southwark, and then proceeded to devastate Surrey, Sussex, Hampshire, and Berkshire with merciless fury. Even his coronation in Westminster Abbey was a scene of massacre and arson. His followers set fire to the houses in the neighbourhood, and robbed and murdered the inhabitants to give due solemnity to the ceremonial. Though deprived of all effective leadership by the death of Harold, the English were still formidable foes, and William had to proceed with caution. He did not confiscate the entire soil of England at a blow, as his rapacious horde urged him to do. He at first seized just enough to make the people revolt, and then he plundered them of their remaining possessions for revolting. To goad the people into insur¬ rection he made his half-brother, Odo, Bishop of Bayeux—a more atrocious ruffian than himself, if that were possible— viceroy, and retired to Normandy, taking good care to carry with him as hostages all the leading Englishmen on whom he could lay his hands. To his accomplice, the Pope, he sent Harold's banner and a handsome share of the spoil. William's plan worked well. Odo and his advisers soon succeeded in driving the miserable English into insurrection. Their men-at-arms scoured the land from end to end, killing and robbing and offering such insults to the women as " turn the coward's heart to steel, the sluggard's blood to flame." Presently William returned with a fresh gang of Continental</page><page sequence="22">22 OUR OLDEST NOBILITY AT WORK. cut-throats, and what Ordericus Vitalis, William's panegyrist, aptly calls the "feralis occisio"—the dismal slaughter—began in earnest. The Norman " chivalry" were let loose on Northumbria. One honest Norman writer calls them a horde of " Normans, Burgolouns, thieves, and felons," and he was in a position to judge. From Durham to Hexham, from Wear to Tyne, William, surrounded by these choice originals of our Old Nobility, passed like another Tamerlane or Attila. Men, women, and children, and even the cattle, were indis- criminatingly butchered. From Durham to York not a town or hamlet escaped conflagration. Eighty years afterwards, when William of Malmesbury wrote, the whole region was one vast wilderness. " It was a horrible spectacle," says Roger Hoveden, " to see on the high roads and public places, and at the doors of houses, human bodies eaten by the worms; for there remained no one to cover them with a little earth." In their utter misery the people fed on putrid horseflesh, and even became cannibals. To escape from the pangs of hunger, they sold themselves and their wives and little ones as slaves to the very men who had robbed them of their all. The churches shared the fate of less sacred edifices. They were laid in ashes, and the unhappy clergy fled to Holy Island. The monastery of Jarrow, hallowed by the memory of the Venerable Bede, was burned to the ground by this brigand king with the consecrated banner. Holinshed thus describes the terrible straits to which the country was reduced :—" He (William) nothing regarded the English nobility. They did now see themselves trodden under foot, to be despised and to be mocked on all sides, insomuch that many of them were constrained, as it were, for a further testimony of servitude and bondage, to shave their beards, to cut their hair, and to frame themselves as well in apparel as in service and diet at their tables after the Norman manner— very strange, and far differing from the ancient customs and old usages of their country. Others utterly refusing to sustain such an intolerable yoke of thraldom as was daily laid upon them by the Normans, chose rather to leave all, both goods and lands, and after the manner of outlaws get them to the woods, with their wives, children, and servants, meaning from thenceforth to live on the spoil of the country adjoining, and to take whatever came to hand. Whereupon it came to pass</page><page sequence="23">OUR OLDEST NOBILITY AT WORK; 23 within a while that no man might tread in safety from his own house or town to his next neighbour ; and every quiet and honest man's house became, as it were, a hold and fortress, furnished for defence with bows and arrows, bills, pole-axes, swords, clubs, and staves, and other weapons, the doors being kept locked and strongly bolted in the night season, as it had been in time of war and amongst public enemies. Prayers were said also by the master of the house, as though they had been in the midst of the seas in some stormy tempest; and when the windows, and doors should be shut in and closed, they used to say Benedicite, and others to answer Dominus in like manner, as the priest and his penitent were wont to do at confession in the church." Among the miscreants who had worked this terrible ruin William parcelled out the fair soil of England. To his half- brother he gave no fewer than four hundred manors. William de Percy was made lord of eighty manors in wasted Northumbria ; while William de Garenne was presented with twenty-eight villages. By the close of the Conqueror's reign nearly the whole country had passed into the hands of the filibusterers, who literally gorged themselves with spoil. But, like thieves in general, they could not avoid quar¬ relling among themselves. William's authority was precisely that of a pirate chief—he ruled his felon gang by sheer terror. Many conspiracies were hatched against him. One brok.° out at Norwich on the occasion of a famous wedding. " He is a bastard man of base extraction," shouted the Normans. '' It is in vain that he calls himself a king; it is easy to see that he was never made to be one ; and God has him not in his grace." " He poisoned our Conan, that brave Count of Brittany," yelled the Bretons. " He has invaded our noble kingdom, and massacred the legitimate heirs to it," cried the English. Surfeited with spoil, and reeking with blood, many of William's principal followers deserted him, and returned to Normandy ; among others being his brother-in-law, Hugh de Grantmesnil, Earl of Norfolk, and Humphrey Tilleuil, Warden of Hastings Castle. William promptly branded them as traitors, confiscated the immense estates he had given them, and called to his aid a new band of continental marauders. His half-brother, Odo, he was obliged to imprison; and</page><page sequence="24">24 OUR OLDEST NOBILITY AT WORK. against his son Robert he was compelled to wage incessant war for the possession of Normandy. In all the doings of William and his wicked crew there is not to be found a single trace of patriotism, or regard for the interests of the English people. Their motives were in the last degree base. They are well illustrated by what the Conqueror's Secretary relates of his death:—" Barons, priests, and dukes mounted their horses and away almost before he was dead, to serve their interests with the living. The minor attendants rifled the apartments, and even carried off the royal clothes ; and the body was left almost naked on the bare boards for a whole day." Their conduct was precisely that of a pack of hungry wolves, which, the moment one of their number is killed or disabled, turn upon the unfortunate and devour it. If " noble lords " find any comfort in being descended from such reprobates as William and his barons, they are truly strangely constituted. But, happily, hardly one of them is so unfortunate in his ancestry. William Rufus, the Conqueror's successor, laid a heavy hand on those families that had profited most by his father's crimes. They conspired against him, and he cut them off without mercy. Among some of his victims were William of Alderic, the Earl of Shrewsbury, Walter de Lacy, and Odo, Earl of Holderness. Henry I., who succeeded Rufus, all but completed the good work which his brother had begun. His title was defective, and he was obliged to lean on the vanquished English for support. He drove from the kingdom his deceased brother's boon companions, on the pretext that their lives were a public scandal. The supporters of his brother, Duke Robert of Normandy—the Surreys, the Lancasters, and Shrews- burys—he pursued with relentless rigour as disaffected subjects until it came to this—that scarcely a single repre¬ sentative of the desperadoes who had triumphed at Hastings was left alive or remained un-outlawed. They had taken the sword, and they had perished by the sword. Such of our nobility, therefore, as have any claim to anti¬ quity ought at once, for shame's cause, to say nothing more about their Norman extraction. It is a lie, to begin with; and, were it true, it would certainly not be a thing to boast of. It is as if one were to glory in descent from the impeni¬ tent thief or Judas Iscariot.</page><page sequence="25">OUR OLDEST NOBILITY AT WORK. 25 But though the Rufuses and the Henrys rid the country of the first gang of masterful robbers, they by no means abated the evils of aristocracy. In place of the outlawed Claude Duvals, they imported a baser stock of equally greedy and unscrupulous adventurers, whom they quartered on the un¬ happy people. This process went on for centuries; and so long as we have Saxe Weimars, Leiningens, and Battenbergs swarming into the country, we can hardly flatter ourselves that the era of spoliation has closed. England has been con¬ quered, not once, but half a dozen times, in this way. During the struggle between Stephen and Matilda for the throne the evil rose to an intolerable height. Henry II. ordered a whole legion of these beasts of prey to quit the kingdom in one day; and " we saw," says a contemporary writer with delight, " the Brabancons and Flemings cross the sea to return to the plough-tail, and become serfs after having been lords." King John's noble companions were nearly all imported. Among these were Manleon the Bloody; Falco without Bowels ; Godeschal the Iron-hearted; Sottim the Merciless ; and Walter Buch the Murderer. The very names of these savages are sufficient to make one shudder. Yet they are unquestionably among the ancestors of our old nobility. John gave them large estates as rewards for their unheard- of barbarities, and they grew and flourished like a green bay- tree. In all ages of the world kings and aristocrats have neces¬ sarily been public enemies. Their interests are ever opposed to the general welfare. The reason is obvious. The watchword of democracy is equality of rights; the watchword of aristocracy is inequality. The English aristo¬ cracy is to-day what it has ever been—a predatory band. They are not permitted to murder, burn, and rob as in the good old times of Sottim the Merciless and Falco without Bowels. But they levy tribute on the whole people of these islands with merciless rigour. What they call rent is simply a pri¬ vate tax laid on the industry of the nation by a small gang of peers and other inheritors of the spoils of the Conquest. Rent is brigandage reduced to a system. So long as the English people are content to be tenants-at-will on their own soil and to pay for the privilege, they will remain virtually slaves, and</page><page sequence="26">26 OUR OLDEST NOBILITY AT WORK. the less they talk about freedom the better. America laughs at our delusions and ridiculous pretentions. Aristocracy has eventually ruined every nation which has tolerated it, and there are many signs that England is not to escape the common fate. Already we are notoriously behind the age in many respects. There is but one remedy. By a supreme effort the intolerable incubus of kings and aristocrats must be thrown off once and for all. Thanks to the leader of the aristocracy, Lord Salisbury, a clear issue has at last been put before the nation. The peers have fairly thrown down the gauntlet to the people, and it is for the people to take it up. It is not now a question of No Surrender to noble lords ; it is a question of No Quarter.</page><page sequence="27">27 CHAPTER IV. RUNNYMEDE AND MAGNA CHARTA. Shall the vile fox-earth awe the race That stormed the lion's den Shall we who could not brook one lord Crouch to the wicked ten '"TO understand the History of England from the Norman 1 Conqueror to the first Tudor, Henry VII., is not difficult if we keep one fact steadily before our minds, viz., that the Government had fallen into the hands of a gang of thieves, a leading aristocratic thief calling himself king, and a number of less fortunate aristocratic thieves who envied the leading thief his pre-eminence. The minor aristocratic thieves had two great objects in view during the whole of this period. Firstly,*they wanted each in his own domain to exercise kingly authority; and secondly, there being but one England to divide among them, they constantly strove by conspiracies against the Crown to have it reconfiscated. If they could but dethrone one king and set up another, then the adherents of the defeated prince had their lands confiscated, and the success¬ ful faction divided the spoil. As for the interests of the governed, they were never for a moment consulted, except in so far as their support was indispensable to Crown or nobles. Down to the reign of King John that support was almost invariably, and with good reason, given to the Crown. It was better to be afflicted by one grand vulture than by a host of minor harpies under no control whatever. It was, moreover, the cue of the conquered English to side with the</page><page sequence="28">28 RUNNYMEJDE AND MAGNA CHARTA. king with the worst title, because from him they were sure to secure the largest concessions. William the Conqueror understood the character of his fellow-robbers perfectly, and to retain his hold over them he, contrary to feudal usage, exacted oaths of allegiance not merely from them, the direct tenants of the Crown, but from their sub-tenants also. By this means he hoped to cripple the barons whenever they should attempt to levy war against the monarchy, and the expedient was partly successful. It was, moreover, a measure favourable, undesignedly favour¬ able, to liberty. In proportion as the sub-tenants were made dependent on the distant royal tyrant, they were rendered independent of the immediate local tyrant. The popularity of the English monarchy, a thing so unnatural in itself, may, in some measure, be accounted for in this way. As a bulwark against the nobles it possessed negative virtues, which the un¬ thinking mass foolishly came to regard as positive advantages. The great conspiracy against William in 1076 by the Norman Earls of Norfolk and Hereford and the English Waltheof had for its object the division of the entire kingdom among the three conspirators, one of whom was to be king. The conspiracies against William Rufus in 1088 and 1096, the former headed by Odo of Bayeux, and the latter by Mowbray of Northumberland, were equally attempts on the part of the barons to free themselves from the restraints of the Crown. Had they succeeded there can hardly be a doubt that the country would have been ruined beyond the possibility of recovery. Ruffianly as were the Norman kings, they were gentlemen as compared with their leading nobles. In the Reign of Henry I. the leader of these miscreants was one Robert de Belesme, of whom Henry happily rid the country after storming four of his robber strongholds, Nottingham and Tickhill, Bridgenorth and Shrewsbury. This choice specimen of our old nobility was about the only great inventor the aristocracy ever produced. He devoted his attention to the manufacture of new and ingenious instru¬ ments of torture, and delighted to witness the exquisite death-agonies of his numerous victims. In the art of im¬ paling, the most " unspeakable Turk " would have had some-</page><page sequence="29">RUNNYMEDE AND MAGNA CHARTA. 2o thing to learn from this fiend. " He was a man," says William of Malmesbury, "intolerable for the barbarity of his manners, remarkable besides for cruelty." Among other instances, he relates how for some trifling offence by its father he blinded his godchild, his hostage, by tearing out the helpless infant's eyes " with his accursed nails.'' During the reign of Stephen our old nobility actually succeeded in establishing in England their ideal of good government. During the struggle for the throne between the king and the Empress Matilda, every baron did what was good in his own eyes. Their hour was come. The Bishop of Winchester alternately cursed his brother Stephen and Matilda. " Neither King nor Empress," says William of Newbury, " was able to act in a masterful way or show vigorous discipline. But each kept their own followers in good temper by refusing them nothing lest they should desert them. And because they were worn out by daily strife, and acted less vigorously, local disturbances of hostile lords grew the more vehement; castles, too, rose in great numbers in the several districts, and there were in England, so to speak, as many kings, or rather tyrants, as lords of castles. Individuals took the right of 'coining their private money and of private jurisdiction." " All England," say the Gesta Stephani, " wore a face of woe and desolation. Multitudes abandoned their beloved country to wander in a foreign land ; others, forsaking their houses, built wretched huts in the churchyard, hoping that the sacredness of the place would afford them some protection." " Every powerful man," says the Saxon Chronicle, " made his castles and held them against him (Stephen), and they filled the land with castles. They cruelly oppressed the wretched men of the land with castle works. When the castles were made they filled them with devils and evil men. Then they took those men that they imagined had any property, both by night and by day, peasant men and women, and put them in prison for their gold and silver, and tortured them with unutterable torture; for never were martyrs so tortured as they were. They hanged them up by the feet and smoked them with foul smoke; they hanged them up by their thumbs or by the head and hung fires on their feet; they put knotted strings about their heads, and writhed them so that it went to the</page><page sequence="30">30 RUNNYMEDE AND MAGNA CHARTA. brain. They put them in dungeons, in which were adders, and snakes, and toads, and killed them so. Some they put in a ' cruset hus,'—that is, in a chest that was short and narrow and shallow, and put sharp stones therein, and pressed the man therein, so that they break all his limbs. In many of the castles were instruments called a ' lao (loathly) and grim;' these were neck-bonds, of which two or three men had enough to bear one. It was so made,'—that is, it was fastened to a beam, and they put a sharp iron about the man's throat and his neck, so that he could not in any direction sit, or lie, or sleep, but must bear all that iron. Many thousands they killed with hunger ; I neither can nor may tell all the wounds or all the tortures which they inflicted on wretched men in this land ; and that lasted the nineteen winters while Stephen was King; and ever it was worse and worse. They laid imposts on the towns continually, and when the wretched men had no more to give, they robbed and burned all the towns, so that thou mightest well go all a day's journey, and-thou shouldest never find a man sitting in a town, or the land tilled. Then was corn dear, and flesh, and cheese, and butter; for there was none in the land. Wretched men died of hunger; some went seeking alms who at one while were rich men ; some fled out of the land. Never yet had more wretchedness been in the land, nor did the heathen man ever do worse than they did ; for every¬ where at times they forebore neither church or churchyard, but took all the property that was therein, and then burned the church and all together. Nor forbore they a bishop's land, nor an abbot's nor a priest's, but robbed monks and clerks, and every man another who anywhere could. If two or three men came riding to a town, all the township fled before them, imagining them to be robbers. The bishops and clergy constantly cursed them, but nothing came of it, for they were all accursed, and foresworn, and lost. How¬ ever a man tilled, the earth bore no corn ; for the land was all foredone by such deeds, and they said openly that Christ and His saints slept." " As another instance of these bitter fruits of conquest," says that great glorifier of antiquity, Sir Walter Scott, " and perhaps the strongest that can be quoted, we may mention that the Empress Matilda, though a daughter of the King of</page><page sequence="31">RUNNYMEDE AND MAGNA CHARTA. 51 Scotland, and afterwards both Queen of England and Empress of Germany, the daughter, the wife, and me mother of monarchs, was obliged, during her early residence in England, to assume the veil of a nun as the only means of escaping the licentious pursuit of the Norman nobles. It was a matter of public knowledge that, after the conquest of King William, his Norman followers, elated by so great a victory, acknowledged no law but their own wicked pleasure, and not only despoiled the conquered Saxons of their lands and goods, but invaded the honour of their wives and of their daughters with the most unbridled license." Had these days of unlimited aristocratic tribulation not been providentially shortened, all English flesh must have perished. It was in memory of the chief actors that Lord John Manners devoutly wrote his ever memorable lines :— Let wealth and commerce, laws and learning die, But leave us still our old nobility. No sooner did Henry II. ascend the throne than he set himself determinedly to demolish the numerous strongholds— some 1,100, it is said—that had been erected in his predeces¬ sor's reign. The people backed him manfully, and something like order and settled government was again restored. The people and the king together were more than a match for the barons. But a time speedily came when the overgrown power of the Crown made its wearer, King John, equally intolerable to people, clergy, and barons. Then, for the first time since the Conquest, was seen the strange spectacle of the barons figuring as patriots, and obtaining the credit of wresting from the royal tyrant that Magna Charta which has sent our historians into such ecstasies. It was but the other day that the Earl of Carnarvon told us that this achievement of theirs entitled the peers to rank as the champions and perpetual guardians of English liberty. Let us see, therefore, how far this con¬ tention has any basis in fact. In the first place, Magna Charta was not a new Bill of popular rights. It was little more than an embodiment of the Charters of King Canute, of Edward the Confessor, and more particularly of Henry I. The last-named instrument was even in some respects more liberal.</page><page sequence="32">32 UUNNYMEDE AND MAGNA CHARTA. The soul of the whole business was Stephen Langton, Archbishop of Canterbury, a very different sort of Primate to any of our modern successors of St. Augustine. John had driven him with contumely from his see, and Langton never forgave him. But he had public injuries to redress as well as private, and it would be utterly unjust to say that he was spurred to action by sentiments of private resentment alone. Indeed, like Simon, Earl of Leicester, he was a statesman whose conceptions of popular right and just government were ages ahead of his time and order. The clergy were very largely recruited from the lower ranks of the free-men and even of the villeins, and it was impossible for them to be altogether negligent of the interests of the class from which they sprang. Langton read and explained the Charter of Henry I. to the rude, unlettered barons, and urged them to take vengeance on the common tyrant. They had only too good cause. On them even more than on Holy Church had John's hand been unendurably heavy. He had heaped on them injuries worse than death. Not merely had he seized their castles and gifted their estates to his foreign mercenaries, his Merciless Sottims, his Bowel-less Falcos and Company, but he had outraged their wives and daughters without number, and boasted of his licentious achievements. Yet they exhibited no real pluck or patriotism in bringing this second Nero to book. John they knew was a ruffian of the highest ability, and they quailed before him. Their first effort against the tyrant was a complete failure, though they appeared in the field as the army of God and Holy Church. John withstood their assault in Northampton Castle, and in a fortnight's time they retired with their retainers to Bedford, crestfallen and humiliated. But here came the turning-point, John had already in vain appealed to the freemen for aid against the barons. With a correct instinct, the people for the first time sided with the barons against the Crown. Bedford received them with open arms, and London enthusiastically proffered succour. The Scots in the north made a powerful diversion, as they have so often done when English freedom has hung in the balance, and the cause was won by the English people. The barons had in reality behaved with great pusillanimity, and their subsequent</page><page sequence="33">RUNNYMOEDE AND MAGNA CHARTA. 33 conduct showed how utterly unpatriotic their motives really were. The important rights guaranteed by the Charter to the freemen were the price of their indispensable support. As for the sole provision benefiting the villeins—benefiting them to the extent of not fining them for petty offences—to the deprivation of their tools—its insertion may be fairly set down to the credit of the good Langton. But though John quailed before this great uprising of the nation, and signed the Great Charter, he never had the smallest intention of observing its provisions. He at once sent off to the Pope, whose feudatory he had ignominiously become, with the approval of most of the baronial heroes of Runnymede, and induced his over-lord to cancel the entire Charter and lay the City of London under an interdict. Langton was ordered to excommunicate the king's enemies, but this the great statesman flatly declined to do. From Poitou, Gascony, and Brabant a horde of ruthless mercenaries was summoned, and with these John proceeded to efface the provisions of the Charter in blood. He swept the country from end to end, and even drove back the King of Scots to the gates of Edinburgh. London alone maintained the cause of freedom with a noble constancy. Again the wretched barons lost heart. The sight of their lands and castles in the grasp of John's mercenaries made them lose every sentiment of patriotism, if ever they had any. In their despair, they offered the crown of England to Louis, the son of the French king. The offer was accepted, and Louis landed with a strong force. The barons joined his standard, but the people wisely held aloof. At this critical moment King John providentially expired, and England was saved from an occupation which must have ended in her becorh'ing an appanage of the French crown. The people determined to set Prince Henry, John's son, on the throne, and in a year's time Louis and the barons were thoroughly beaten, the Charter reaffirmed, and the nation saved from a greater misfortune than even the Norman Conquest. It was afterwards divulged that, if Louis had succeeded in Jhis enterprise, he meant to destroy the entire English baronage, after the manner of the Conqueror. From this well-merited fate they were saved by the patriotism of Hugh D</page><page sequence="34">34 RUNNYMEDE AND MAGNA CHARTA. de Burgh's sailors and William de Collingham's bowmen. Their conduct, in truth, was as unintelligent as it was unpatriotic. In their haste to get out of the frying-pan of King John, they merely leapt into the fire of King Louis without the least regard for the national welfare. So much for the achievements of the deathless heroes of Runnymede, about which so much nonsense has been said and sung. Never, in point of fact, was there a more selfish or mean-spirited pack of fellows, if we except the Scots nobles in the struggle for Independence against Edward I. While Wallace and the Scottish people were fighting with unsur¬ passed gallantry to save Scotland from the fate of unhappy Ireland, the whole of the nobles, with the single exception of Lord Soulis, sold their country, not once, but several times, to preserve their private estates. The "Ragman's Roll" is a record of such infamy that one can only wonder how liberty- loving Scotsmen have allowed themselves to be rack-rented and evicted by " lairds " and " factors " so long. If they had ever suffered from a calamity like the Norman Conquest, one could understand such unmanly tolerance ; but though they never bowed to the Conqueror's yoke, they have yet tamely accepted from their rascally lawyers the Conqueror's feudal law. For a people that have justly earned a world-wide repu¬ tation for shrewdness, the facility with which they have permit¬ ted themselves to be robbed by goose-quills of a soil that swords could never wrest from them, is one of the most unac¬ countable facts in modern history. A Highland crofter, who will fight like a lion in the ranks of the Black Watch against any odds, in any quarter of the globe, will cringe like a beaten hound before the eye of an evicting " laird's factor." This by the way. But if our Old Nobility had no other virtue, personal courage and prowess have generally been conceded to them without demur. Now, like predatory animals in general, it is perfectly certain that at all stages of their history the aristocracy have exhibited the strongest taste for blood. But a taste for blood does not necessarily imply love of danger, and I am disposed to think that there is a good deal of the cowardly prairie cayote in our Old Nobility. Nothing but cowardice, or, at all events, a very commendable regard for a whole skin, could have induced anyone with the faintest</page><page sequence="35">RUNNYMEDE AND MAGNA CHARTA. 35 sense of the ridiculous to don an anc ent coat of mail. Rather than appear in such a garb, really courageous men would have run any reasonable risk of being killed on the spot. Once down, they could not get up for the sheer weight of iron in which they were encased. When they attempted charges, before the archers had done their deadly work, as they did at Falkirk and in several of the battles in France, they failed and floundered most ignominiously. Nor have the scions of aristocracy ever been good for much in the more recent days of the " gunpowder and glory business." In the Crimean War they were sorely incommoded, as we all know, " by urgent private business." One Lord Forth declared himself a coward, and refused to enter the trenches. The British Army the First Napoleon described as a host of lions led by asses, and his verdict has been confirmed by all subse¬ quent experience. Yet H.R.H. the Prince of Wales is a field-marshal, and cousin George is Commander-in-Chief! " Always a wonderful people, the English " In the years 1348 and 1349 che Black Death visited Eng¬ land, and carried off, it is estimated, from one third to one half of the entire population. The immediate result was an enormous increase in the value of labour. The demand far exceeded the supply, but noble lords were equal to the occasion. A royal proclamation was issued " by the advice of our prelates, and nobles, and other skilled persons, that every able-bodied man and woman of our kingdom, bond or free, under sixty years of age, not living by trading, shall, if so required, serve another for the same wages as were the custom in the twentieth of our (Edward III.'s) reign." By a subsequent Statute of Labourers, the nobles and other skilled persons established a regular scale of wages and ordered stocks to be set up " betwixt this and the Feast of Pente¬ cost," in every town in England, to enforce the penalties of the Act. Nor was this enough; the labourers were so unreasonable as to escape from one county to another in quest of better hire. To cure this evil there was passed, in 1361, a down¬ right Fugitive Slave Act, which ordained, among other severi¬ ties, that fugitive workmen, " in token of falsity, should be burned in the forehead with an iron formed and made to the letter F." This being so, it is not difficult to understand D 2</page><page sequence="36">36 RUNNYMEDE AND MAGNA CHARTA. that working men were forbidden to hunt, hawk, 'or jfdust, 'or appear in any dress not suitable to their lowly condition. Noble lords actually supervised the tailoring of the working class by Act of Parliament. But all would not do. In the beginning of Richard the Second's reign, rural England rose in insurrection under the heroic Wat Tyler, and the aristocracy were for a time beside themselves with terror. Their cowardice was only excfeeded by their treachery and cruelty. The demands of the insurgents were most reason¬ able. They were only four in number:— 1. The total abolition of serfdom. 2. The reduction of the rent of arable land to fourpence per acre—then a good price. 3. Full freedom to buy and sell like other men in fair or mart. 4. A general pardon. Tyler perished by the hand of the assassin Mayor of London, Walworth, and the boy-king undertook to be the leader of the simple-hearted peasants. By the advice of the panic-stricken nobles, Richard gave the people a Charter guaranteeing them all they asked, a general pardon included. They dispersed, trusting to the honour of Richard and his aristocratic advisers. They had but too good reason to re¬ pent of their credulity. The nobles rallied, and the mask was dropped. " Rustics ye have been and are," the perfidious Richard declared, " and in bondage shall ye remain ; not such as ye have heretofore known, but in a condition incom¬ parably more vile." In spite of Charter, in spite of pardon, no fewer than 15,000 good men and true were hanged, drawn, and quartered, according to Holinshed, by this perjured boy and the vile crew of Old Nobility that surrounded his throne. Richard, it appears, had some qualms about the heinous part he was made to play, but his noble lords had none. He asked them if they would consent to enfranchise the serfs. " Consent," they replied, " we have never given, and never will give, were we all to die in one day." Nevertheless, by the mere pressure of economic laws, both villeinage and the statutes regulating wages were practically at an end within fifty years of Tyler's rising. The change was great and beneficent. The Black Death was stronger than our Old Nobility. Indeed, it is not too much to say that no page of</page><page sequence="37">RUNNYMEDE AND MAGNA CHARTA. 37 English history records a single triumph of civilization that has not been achieved in spite of the aristocracy. In the Wars of the Roses we have such a revolting picture of aristocracy as fills the soul with loathing and horror. In all the other struggles in which the aristocracy have been engaged they have generally managed to reap some advantage at the expense either of the people or the monarch; but in the York versus Lancaster episode they positively laid violent hands on themselves. They literally committed suicide, like the swine in the Gospel, rushing headlong down a steep place into the sea, where they perished almost to a man. The prime object of Warwick the King-maker was, of course, to lay hold of the Crown, which he really over¬ shadowed. No fewer than 30,000 persons are said to have lived habitually at his board in the numerous castles which were his by inheritance or by skilful matrimonial alliances. His ruling passion was a mad ambition, in the pursuit of which he displayed an unmatched disregard of every principle of justice, of every sentiment of humanity. In Warwick aristocracy attained its apotheosis, or rather its supreme diablery. He pulled down Henry VI. and set up Edward IV. Then he pulled down Edward and set up Henry again. Eventually he died fighting against that very Edward for whom he had deluged England in blood. In all the windings of this bloody tragedy Warwick's one discernible motive seems to have been to get his daughters so united to royalty by matri¬ monial alliances as to ensure that some grandchild of his, some Neville, should be monarch of England. To accomplish this paltry end, he tried first to exterminate the Lancastrian barons, and then in turn to extirpate the Yorkists. He acted on the horrible principle of giving no quarter in the field, and the opposing side, of course, adopted his tactics. In the sickening shambles of St. Albans, Bloreheath, North¬ ampton, Wakefield, Mortimer's Cross, the first and second battles of Barnet, Towton, Hedgeley Moor, Hexham, Edgecote, Erpingham, and Tewkesbury, there perished over 100,000 Englishmen, literally sacrificed to this devouring demon of aristocracy. We read in ancient fable of fearful monsters who exacted such tribute from men ; but here we have an aristocratic ogre, with a maw more capacious and gory than any conception of myth or legend.</page><page sequence="38">38 RUNNYMEDE AND MAGNA CHARTA. Warwick, his father Salisbury, and his brother Lord Montacute, all perished. In the battle of Wakefield the Duke of York was slain, and his son, the Earl of Rutland— a boy of thirteen—was brutally murdered by Lord Clifford. Somersets, Exeters, Buckinghams,Northumberlands, Devons, Shewsburys, Pembrokes, and scores on scores of similar bloodthirsty miscreants, died sword in hand, or were sent to the block. In the battle of Northampton alone three hundred knights bit the dust. Public slaughter was amply supplemented by private murder. Henry VI. was privately murdered. His only son Edward was murdered. Clarence—" false, fleeting, perjured Clarence"—was murdered by his brother, Edward IV. Richard III. murdered his two nephews, the sons of Edward IV. He subsequently wanted to marry their sister, his niece, and the young woman was in raptures with the pro¬ spect. The amiable Richard she called " the master of her heart and thoughts." She sighed for the death of Anne (Richard's wife), the daughter of the King-maker. " The better part of February is past, and the queen still alive. Will she never die "—and allow her to be Queen of Eng¬ land, and her uncle's wife! With the Wars of the Roses the first era of English aris¬ tocracy comes to an end—an era of blood and iron, tyranny and rapine, cruelty and treachery, almost without a paralle in the annals of mankind.</page><page sequence="39">39 CHAPTER V. CREEPING THINGS. And the Devil quoted Genesis, Like a very learned clerk, How Noah and his creeping things Went up into the Ark. "Poor race of man," said the pitying Spirit, " Dearly ye pay for your primal fall; Some flow'rets of Eden ye still inherit, But the trail of the serpent is over them all." i- Second Epoch (1485—1688). DURING the period just described the trail of the aris¬ tocratic serpent was easy to track in all its bloodstained windings; but with the advent of the first Tudor king it suddenly assumes a more intangible and altogether more labyrinthine character. Their deeds being evil they studiously shunned the light. From being the peers, and often the rivals of the monarch, our Old Nobility suddenly sank into a herd of cowardly, cringing courtiers, doing all the dirty work of royalty with incredible submissiveness, and going meekly to the block when the reigning tyrant was dissatisfied with their performance. During the Tudor period the lords may be said to have had two functions : they registered royal decrees in their Upper Chamber, and gave employment to the Calcrafts and Marwoods of the day. Henry VII., with good reason, dreaded such straggling specimens of the older aristocracy as had escaped the Wars of the Roses, and as his reign abounded in small plots and impostures, he had an excellent excuse for cutting them off one by one and seizing their estates. He was a Louis XI. in craft, and no man could tell whose turn it would be next to undergo decapitation. He even managed to behead his chancellor, Sir William</page><page sequence="40">40 CREEPING THINGS. Stanley, to whom more than anyone else he owed the throne. Sir William's chief fault was that he was very rich, and Henry had always an eye to a fat confiscation. Surreys, Lovels, Ferrerses, De La Poles, Audleys, Ratcliffes, Fitzwalters, and more than thirty of Richard the Third's chief supporters, among them being the Duke of Norfolk, were attainted, with the usual consequences. But, dexterous as the Seventh Henry was in the use of the aristocratic pruning-hook, he was a mere tyro compared with his ever-memorable son, Henry the Eighth. He began with a will. His first victims were the Dukes of Suffolk and Buckingham. Then came the venerable Bishop Fisher, and the illustrious Sir Thomas More—four alleged lovers of Anne Boleyn; and the chief actors in the Pilgrimage of Grace, Lords Darcey and Hussey, Robert Aske, and others. Montacutes, Exeters, Nevilles, Fortescues, Dingleys, Crom- wells, the aged Countess of Salisbury, and scores of others, reddened the scaffold with their blood. The women showed more courage than the men. The Countess of Salisbury, whose only offence was that she was Cardinal Pole's mother, had to be held forcibly down on the scaffold, and was frightfully gashed and mangled. During Henry's reign the political and ecclesiastical executions were to be counted by the thousand. The Defender of the Faith, as has been well said, spared no man in his anger or woman in his lust. He made England an Aceldama, and yet he met with scarcely anything but abject servility from the suc¬ cessors of the " barons bold." The remorseless Earl of Essex, when his own turn came, whined piteously for mercy. To please the tyrant, the Duke of Norfolk urged on the ruin of both his nieces, Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard. "He had learned," he told the King, "that his ungracious mother-in-law, his unhappy brother and wife, and his lewd sister of Bridgewater, are in the Tower, which, from his long experience of his majesty's equity and justice, he felt sure was not done but for false and traitorous proceedings." Henry's last victim was Norfolk's son, the accomplished Earl of Surrey. Norfolk himself escaped by a miracle. He was in the Tower, but Henry had not time to sign his death- warrant when his own span of life was cut short by the levelling Power that removes kings and beggars, saints and sinners, with perfect indifference.</page><page sequence="41">CREEPING THINGS. 4' One of the causes which reduced our Old Nobility to this abject state of servility in Henry the Eighth's reign was the hope of plunder. Henry was all the while reforming the Church, as he was pleased to call it. About one-third of the national soil was vested in the Church, or rather in the great monastic institutions, and Henry resolved to seize on this rich inheritance and divide it among the vile upstart instruments of his will. It was a huge bribe to give stability to his despotism, and it succeeded well; so true it is that " a gift corrupteth the heart." Fear, fortified by avarice, is an all but irresistible motive-power even in the case of honourable men; in the case of courtiers it has never been known to fail. As to particular aristocratic families, who, like the Russells, Cavendishes, Cecils, and other Church Robbers, have monopolized political authority over this much-enduring people, I shall have something to say subsequently. For the present, let us glance at the effects of their aggrandize¬ ment. The Church lands were really the patrimony of the poor. The monks may have cultivated gastromony more than theology, but it is certain that they were not exacting landlords. They lived and let live ; the poor they cherished, the traveller they entertained. They were the best husband¬ men in England.. No sooner had their lands passed into the hands of the rapacious gang of courtiers, than the poor were reduced to the utmost extremity. The land was filled with beggars, thieves, and vagabonds. Henry and Elizabeth without avail covered the Statute Book with Acts of repres¬ sion. The poor had been robbed of their all, and this was how the robbers made provision for them. Anyone might seize them and set them to work. If they made off, and were caught, they might be branded with a V on the breast, and be adjudged slaves for two years. If they went off again, they were to be chained and beaten, branded on the cheek with the letter S, and made slaves for life. Beggars' children might be kidnapped and made slaves till they were four-and-twenty. If they ran away they were to feave their ear bored through with a hot iron an inch wide : if they absconded again, they were adjudged felons, and for a third offence they were to be put to death. Henry the Eighth is said by Harrison to have hanged no</page><page sequence="42">42 CREEPING THINGS. fewer than 72,000 of these victims of his own and his courtiers' pillage. Elizabeth hanged them at the rate of from three to four hundred per annum. With a diabolical cynicism, Henry actually demanded from parliament compensation for his sacrifices in the reform of the Church And all through our unhappy annals it has been the same. When our hereditary rulers have not been plundering and maltreating us in one way, they have been doing it in another. When they have not been chastising us with whips, it has been because they have found scorpions more effective. " When wilt Thou save the people, Lord— Oh, God of mercy, when ' Not kings and thrones, but nations ; Not chiefs and lords, but men." The history of our Old Nobility during the reigns of Edward VI., Mary, Elizabeth, and James I. is without a parallel for meanness, rapacity, and cowardice. " A Court," said Talleyrand, "is an assemblage of noble and distinguished beggars." They were nearly all " new men," mere creatures of royalty, raised by reason of their subserviency, their in¬ trigues, and their crimes to great dignities and estates. Henry the Eighth had carved out fortunes for them from the Church lands and the confiscated possessions of the older nobles whom he had so sedulously sent to the block. But the ring of upstarts only felt their hour really come when Henry expired and Edward VI., a boy of nine, came to the throne. They were now without a master, and they soon showed themselves in their true colours. " Set a beggar on horseback, and he will ride to the devil," says the proverb. The truth of this adage they illustrated to perfection, The Russells, Cavendishes, Wriothesleys, Fitzwilliams, Seymours, Dudleys, Petres, Bakers, Browns, Saddlers, Parrs, Wingfields, Dennys, Pagets, have been justly compared to fungi, which grow up luxuriantly wherever decaying or putrescent matter is to be found. The ring at once proceeded to bestow on themselves fresh honours and emoluments by forgery and by an unscrupulous use of the boy-king's name. The Earl of Hertford (Seymour), the king's uncle, the leader of the gang, conferred on himself this extraordinary title: — "The Most High, Noble, and Victorious Prince Edward, Duke of Somerset, Earl of Hert-</page><page sequence="43">CREEPING THINGS. 43 fort, Viscount Beauchamp, Lord Seymour, Guardian of the Person of the King's Majesty and Protector of all his Realms, his Lieutenant-General of all his Armies, both by land and sea; Lord High Treasurer and Earl Marshal of England, Governor of the Isles of Guernsey and Jersey, and Knight of the Most Noble Order of the Garter." The king was in reality a prisoner in his hands, and presently he designated himself, " Duke of Somerset by the grace of God " His brother, Sir Thomas Seymour, became at a bound Baron Seymour of Sudley and Lord High Admiral of England ; Wriothesley was successfully metamorphosed into Earl of Winchester and Earl of Southampton; Dudley, into Earl of Coventry and Earl of Warwick ; John Russell, into Earl of Bedford ; and, indeed, the most insignificant of the gang blossomed out into barons with corresponding incomes secured to them from what remained of the spoils of the Church and the estates of Henry's numerous lay victims. And their warrant for most of these wonderful transfor¬ mations—what was it A clause, almost certainly a forgery, in the will of the libidinous murderer, Henry VIII.! We know that it was Henry's object to effect some sort of balance in the Council of Regency between the old and the new nobility. It was not in the least likely, therefore, that he would at the last moment deliberately commit the interests of the Crown to the sole custody of men whom he well knew to be the most unscrupulous rogues in the kingdom. Besides, the Seymour version of Henry's dying behests could not be made to tally with the date of the will—a fatal defect in the instrument, which shows that forgers, like liars, should have long memories. As it was, however, this vile herd of Church-robbers took the affairs of the State into their own hands, and in a very short time the flames of insurrection broke out in a score of counties. They were, needless to say, quenched in blood; and then the thieves, as usual, took to quarrelling among themselves. Baron Seymour, the Protector's brother, plotted to supplant him He married the queen-dowager, Catherine Parr, and on that lady's death he secured the custody of Elizabeth, whom he proposed next to make his wife, obviously with the design of laying hands on the crown itself. The Duke of Somerset by the grace of God was, however, too</page><page sequence="44">44 CREEPING THINGS. many for him. He was arrested and executed, Somerset being the first to sign his death-warrant. Then came Somerset's own turn. Warwick also had designs on the crown, and with the aid of Wriothesley, Russell, and St. John, he conspired successfully against the Protector, who was arrested and sent to that ancient slaughter¬ house, the Tower, where his head was chopped off on the same block on which his brother's had fallen. Warwick then proceeded to decree himself and his followers fresh honours. He became Duke of Northumberland, Great Master of the Household, Warden of the Scottish Marches, Lord High Admiral, &amp;c. He married his son, Lord Guildford Dudley, to Lady Jane Grey, whom he persuaded the dying boy-king —dying of poison, most probably—to make, by will, heir to the throne. The attempt failed, and scores of noble heads paid the penalty—those of Lady Jane Grey, Lord Guildford Dudley, Lord Robert Dudley, Lord Thomas Grey, the Duke of Suffolk, and others. This Duke of Northumberland was the son of Henry the Seventh's hated jackal, Dudley, whom Henry the Eight beheaded for extortion and embezzlement. His grandson was that infamous Leicester who aspired to marry Elizabeth after the murder of his wife, the hapless Amy Robsart. Elizabeth's " Sweet Robin " was well worthy of his ancestry. Under Queen Mary the Bloody there was not the least difficulty in bringing the House of Lords back to Catholicism. On a promise from Philip and Cardinal Pole that they should not be asked to disgorge the Church lands, they knelt at the feet of the Papal Legate, and were absolved collectively froni the sins of heresy and schism. The cause of religious freedoip was fought out chiefly by obscure sectaries and a few faithful ecclesiastics sprung from the commonalty. Their sufferings by the rack and at the stake were an indelible disgrace to the English name. During Mary's reign, royalty, aristocracy, and priestcraft—the three great scourges of humanity— coalesced to crush the English people, and they nearly suc¬ ceeded. England was within an ace of becoming a province of Spain and of the Holy Inquisition. But if Mary's reign was surcharged with public horrors, that of Queen Elizabeth abounds in secret misdeeds of the most revolting description. Her ministers, ambassadors, and</page><page sequence="45">CREEPING THINGS. 45 lovers, recent investigations have shown, were worthy of their mistress : that is to say, like her, they were utterly con¬ scienceless, hesitating at no crime however wicked, no lie however mean, no treachery however base. A trio of more consumate rogues than Cecil (from whom Lord Salisbury professes to be descended), Walsingham, and Saddler, the chief instruments of the queen's will, it is impossible to con¬ ceive. Their whole time seems to have been spent in forging plots, applying the rack, administering bribes, and planning murders. How to destroy Mary Queen of Scots was the main object of Elizabethan diplomacy. Mary was beautiful and Elizabeth was not. This influenced the feminine jealousy of Elizabeth beyond measure. Again, Anne Boleyn had been married to Henry VIII. several months before the divorce of Catherine of Arragon. Hence Elizabeth felt that her own claim to the throne was barred, and that the unfortunate Queen of Scots was the legitimist heir. In these circumstances she stuck at no hypocrisy or villany that promised to rid her of her cousin Mary. The Scottish Protestant lords, who had just gorged themselves after the manner of the English Russells, Cavendishes, and Wriothesleys, with the spoils of the Catholic Church, occasionally roasting refractory abbots to make them part with title deeds, were all instigated to rebellion by secret subsidies judiciously supplied by Sir Ralph Saddler. Argyle, Montrose, Arran, Giencairn, Murray (Mary's half-brother), and even the reformer, Knox, were heavily bribed. The murderers of Rizzio and ol Darnley were in the pay of Elizabeth, just as were those of Cardinal Beatoun in that of her father, the Defender of the IFaith. In all the troubles that befell Scotland and Queen Mary in that wretched period, the finger of Elizabeth's agents can be distinctly traced, bribing and stimulating to deeds of iolence and wrong. Eventually driven to seek asylum in England by the achinations of Elizabeth and her Cecils, Walsinghams, addlers, and Davisons, Mary was first subjected to many ears' rigorous confinement, and then beheaded in defiance f the sacred obligations of hospitality and the law of nations. |" Sweet Robin " of Leicester had suggested poison as a good ipecific, while other courtiers held that slow torture would be</page><page sequence="46">46 CREEPING THINGS. more difficult of detection. Even after Mary's death-warrant had been signed, the preferability of private assassination was vividly before the mind of the " Virgin Queen." Walsing- ham and the scapegoat Davison were instructed to write to Mary's keepers to say that Her Majesty " wondered, with all their professed zeal in her service, that they had not in all this time found out some way to shorten the life of that queen." Sir Amyas Paulet, who was served with this precious document, replied in the utmost trepidation that " his goods, his life, were at her majesty's disposal—he was ready to lose them the next minute if it should so please her—but God forbid that he should make so foul a shipwreck of his conscience or leave so great a blot oa his posterity, as to shed blood without law and warrant." For this creditable aversion to murder, the " Virgin Queen " stigmatized Paulet as "a precise and dainty fellow," and named less scrupulous agents. Finally, however, she struck out a brilliant idea—Mary was to be executed by accident! Davison was instructed to deliver the death-warrant to the Lord Chancellor. He did so, and, to his amazement, was thrown into the Tower, where he perished after years of misery. Elizabeth mendaciously alleged that she had ordered the secretary to keep Mary's death-warrant in secret. All Elizabeth's leading nobles and ministers participated in this infamous judicial murder of a princess whom they, by their plots, had compelled to seek asylum in England. All the while Burghley kept the rack hard at work, and the consequence was a rich crop of Papist plots. Most of them, we now know, were pure inventions, to escape the ex¬ quisite tortures to which the suspects were subjected. The groundlessness of the charges of disloyalty urged against the Catholics was fully attested by their courage and fidelity when England was put in real peril— When that great Fleet Invincible against her bore in vain The richest spoils of Mexico, the stoutest hearts in Spain. Two samples of Burghley's statecraft will suffice. Francis Throgmorton, a Cheshire gentlemen of honourable repute, was thrice racked, and to escape a fourth application of the</page><page sequence="47">CREEPING THINGS. 47 infernal instrument, made a confession which enabled him to snjoy the comparative luxury of the gallows and disembowel- ment at Tyburn. With his latest breath he protested his entire innocence, which there was no reason to doubt. Dr. Parry, a member of parliament, took exception to certain peculiarly atrocious penal enactments. He was thrown into the Tower, from which he emerged so altered in demeanour that his friends were satisfied that the horrors of his prison-house had overthrown his intellect. He was even ready to aver that he had been employed by His Holiness the Pope to murder the queen. Nevertheless, he was ordered to the gallows forthwith. Like Throgmorton, he earnestly protested that his confession was an absolute fabrication to escape the rack, and that Burghley, Walsmgham, and Eliza¬ beth were well aware that such was the case. Burghley and the queen were alike deaf to his frenzied appeal, and he was hanged out of hand. Under James I. there was no improvement in the character of our Old Nobility. The great rack-master, Cecil pere, was succeeded by Cecilys. There was nothing to choose between these remorseless and coldblooded men. Bacon, a man of high intellect, was steeped in corruption, and tireless in his laudation of " privilege." The brilliant Raleigh was a shame¬ less adulator of royalty, and had his reward. The Somersets and Buckinghams were insolent royal favourites, with nothing to recommend them but their unspeakable vices and dandified exteriors. The first Stuart made anybody a noble who was willing to pay for a title, and some he even compelled to pay for such honours against their will. Before he had been three months in England he had made seven hundred knights. He invented the order of baronets, so much coveted by City aldermen and such like rank weeds of our social life. The price of this hereditary dignity was fixed at ^"1,000; a simple knighthood was knocked down at from /"60 to ^"300. Peerages, of course, cost a good deal more even than baronetcies. Of the for¬ mer there were but fifty-six in Queen Elizabeth's time. James speedily added sixty-two more. ^"10,000 were customarily paid by men who aspired to become hereditary legislators. Our Fanes, Spencers, Cavendishes, Montagues, Peters, Tuftons, Stanhopes, Sackvilles, all paid down lump sums to</page><page sequence="48">48 CREEPING THINGS. the British Solomon, for the privilege of perpetually mis¬ governing the people. To the peers by Church robbery were now added peers by purchase, and the latter process of manufacture is still actively persevered with under somewhat altered conditions. A great landowner who, by lavish and corrupt expenditure, is able to control a county or two in the interests of his party, is almost certain, sooner or later, to secure a seat in the irresponsible house. During the whole of this absurd king's reign, the peers, as in Elizabeth's time, crawled and fawned in the most loath¬ some manner. When the British Solomon talked some unusual nonsense at the Hampton Court Conference in regard to the royal prerogative, Bancroft, the Archbishop of Canter¬ bury, declared that he was inspired by the Holy Ghost. Bacon almost went as far. " The king," he declared, " was the voice of God in the mouth of man." Such language, coming from the lips of such a man, were enough to make angels weep. Nor are we yet emancipated from this de¬ grading lip-service of royalty. In Scotland, Mr. Gladstone recently strove to magnify the throne in a manner utterly unworthy of so great a man. Such exhibitions of hypocritical loyalty by statesmen are a degradation to them¬ selves, and ruinous to our political veracity as a nation. They almost tempt one to doubt whether we are not, after all, as Thackeray held, a nation of snobs, unworthy of the political martyrs, who have perished on scaffold and field and in vilest dungeons, that we might enjoy an inheritance of freedom. The part played by the Peers in the great Revolution of 1648 and the sham Revolution of 1688 was equally un¬ patriotic and contemptible. In the former they ruined the Crown by their pusillanimity; in the latter they ruined the people by fraud. In neither crisis did they exhibit the smallest regard for any interests but their own. Had they joined the Commons in resisting the despotism of Charles I., constitutional liberty might have been secured to the nation without a single drop of blood shed. Such a combination the king could not possibly have resisted. What, then, was their action while the freedom of England —nay, of the world—hung in the balance Charles demanded from his first parliament enormous supplies for</page><page sequence="49">CREEPING THINGS. 49 life. These the Commons refused, because they well knew that they were to be used for the suppression of the nation's liberties. They declined to grant him tonnage and poundage for more than one year. The peers resented this indignity put upon royalty, and threw out the Bill. The king gave them thanks, while the Commons were branded as " vipers." " For you, my lords," said he, " I am glad to take this opportunity, and all other occasions, by which you may clearly understand both my words and actions; for, as you are nearest in degree, so are you the fittest witnesses of kings. The complaint I speak of is in staying men's goods that deny tonnage and poundage." In dissolving parliament, he said: " I declare to you, my lords, and all the world, that it is only the disobedient carriage of the Lower House that hath caused the dissolution at this time, and that you, my lords, are so far from causers of it, that I have as much comfort in your lord¬ ships' carriage as I have cause to distaste their proceedings." Again, in a subsequent parliament, we find the Lords trea¬ cherously urging the Commons to grant the king supplies without the previous redress of national grievances. " Having the word not only of a king, but a gentleman," said they, "they would no more be capable of distrusting him than they would be capable of the highest undutifulnessto him." The Repre¬ sentative House, however, knew full well that Charles, though a king, was not a gentleman in the observance of his plighted word, and paid no heed to the lordly advice. The Upper House then had recourse to another and entirely unconsti¬ tutional expedient—they usurped the function of regulating the course of business in the elected chamber, by voting that " supply should take precedence of all other business." This was not quite so bad as the present claim of the Peers to dissolve parliament; but the Commons, justly incensed, demanded an apology for so gross a breach of privilege, and the hereditary legislators were fain to express contrition. As usual, Charles angrily dismissed parliament, thanking the traitors in the Upper House " for their willing ear and great affection!" When eventually the Long Parliament met and the royal banner was unfurled, noble lords found themselves in a position of supreme difficulty. Such of them, some forty in number, as had any stomach for fighting—a very meagre list</page><page sequence="50">50 CREEPING THINGS. indeed when it is recollected how many noble lords owed their patents to Charles and his father—hastened to the royal standard, which they believed would prove victorious. Some remained in London, terrified lest the people should triumph and their estates be confiscated. Others simply skulked, igno- miniously hiding in holes at home and abroad—holes from which they did not emerge till the Restoration brought them again into political life in much the same way as summer suns revivify adders, snakes, vipers, and other venomous and un¬ clean reptiles. Pym had well warned them of their fate. "Whether the the kingdom be lost or saved," said he, " they should be sorry that the story of the present parliament should tell posterity that in so great a danger and extremity the House of Commons should be found to save the kingdom alone, and the House of Peers should have no part in the honour of the preservation of it, you having so great an interest in the good success of their endeavours in respect of your great estates and high degree of nobility. My lords, consider what the present necessities and dangers of the commonweal require; what the Commons have reason to expect; to what endeavours and counsels the concurrent desires of all the people do invite you, so that applying yourselves to the preservation of the king and kingdom I may be bold to assure you, in the name of the Commons of England, that you shall be bravely seconded." Of all our old nobility but one man, Lord Fairfax, really preferred the interests of the nation to those of his order. The Commons had to save England alone. After the proclamation of the Republic, a number of peers had the assurance to return to their posts and endeavour to resume their legislative functions, but the Commons would not so much as deign to receive a messenger from them. They were promptly voted " useless and dangerous," and for nine years—from January 6th, 1649, to January 20th, 1658, when Cromwell made an abortive effort to constitute an Upper House—England was without a Second Chamber. During this period the high-water mark of national great¬ ness was indisputably attained. So rich did the people become under the vigorous rule of the Commonwealth that in 1653 the then vast sum of ^"900,000 a-year was offered for the</page><page sequence="51">CREEPING THINGS. 51 Customs and Excise, and offered in vain. The English flag floated triumphant on every sea, and commerce expanded by leaps and bounds. Princes, popes, and cardinals did suit and service to the majestic people that had put down kings, peers, and prelates, and dared to assert its own unfettered sovereignty. Are these glories incapable of revival Did the Restoration of 1660 and the sham aristocratic Revolution of 1688 extinguish for good all that is noble, chivalrous, and patriotic in the bosoms of Englishmen Let us hope not. Why should not 1888 witness as genuine a revolution as 1648 Heaven knows we have suffered enough for our backsliding since the restoration of kings and peers to their ancient functions of national oppressors. At the Restoration our Old Nobility enjoyed their own again, and speedily reduced the country to a depth of infamy hitherto unknown. In league with the astute traitor, Monk, who was made Duke of Albemarle for laying the country helpless at the feet of Charles the Second and his lewd crew, there was no enormity at which they hesitated. Not content with judicially murdering Sir Harry Vane, Major-General Harrison, and more than twenty other unflinching champions of freedom, they even had recourse to cowardly assassina¬ tions. Two "cavaliers," shouting "God save the king!" shot Mr. Lisle, the husband of Alice Lisle, as he was about to enter the door of a church in Lausanne, one peaceful Sunday morning, and scampered off. General Ludlow had to obtain a body-guard from the authorities of Vevey to preserve him from a similar fate. Milton, the sublime poet, the deathless advocate of freedom, was within an ace of being hanged. Nor did the aristocratic poltroons in the day of their pros¬ perity confine their attention to the living. They wreaked their vengeance on the mighty dead, They dug up the bodies of Cromwell, Ireton, and Bradshaw; and gibbeted them at Tyburn. Those of Blake, the heroic Republican admiral, who made England the first naval power in the world ; of Pym, a statesman as accomplished as Gladstone and assuredly not less honest; of May, the learned historian of the Long Parliament; and even the corpses of the un¬ offending mother and daughter of Cromwell were disinterred E 2</page><page sequence="52">S2 CREEPING THINGS. and " cast like dogs into a vile pit." Not a single trace of magnanimity marks the career of the restored aristocracy. They were as insolent and cruel in their unmerited prosperity as they had been craven in their merited adversity. At the Restoration, feudal land dues, mostly commuted into money payments, yielded about one-half the national revenue. This was not to be endured. At a blow our old nobility divested themselves of their undoubted obligations, which they transferred to the shoulders of the people, whom they have scourged with intolerable Customs -and Excise Duties ever since. They subsequently found it necessary to promise to pay a State rent of 4s. in the pound on true annnal value as some compensation to the nation for this intolerable swindle. But they have with unblushing dishonesty substi¬ tuted the original assessment of William the Third's reign for true annual value, with the result that the landlords are now paying little more than one million sterling, when they should be paying forty millions. "The Financial Reform Almanack" estimates that from 1688 to 1884 they have by non-payment of land-tax cheated the country out of the stupendous sum of ^"1,250,827,734! Of all modern aristocratic frauds this is the greatest, and if there were a reformer in the House of Commons worth his salt he would seize the very first oppor¬ tunity of bringing the Peers to their senses by moving that the land-tax be levied on true annual value. The Peers possess about one-fifth of the national soil, yielding them nearly twelve millions sterling in rent. Of this huge sum the 4s. tax would relieve them of two millions and two-fifths, and as their friends and relations hold most of the remainder of the soil, the forty millions would mostly come out of the pockets of those who have so long benefited by the original fraud. Were not the House of Commons crammed with aristocrats and landowners such a palpable swindle would not be endured for a day.</page><page sequence="53">53 CHAPTER VI. BURROWING ANIMALS. "Sir, this vermin of court reporters when they are forced into day upon one point are sure to burrow into another."—Burke. " We owe the English peerage to three sources—the spoliation of the Church, the open and flagrant sale of its honours by the elder Stuarts, and the borough-mongering of our own times. These are the three main sources of the existing peerage of England, and, in my opinion, disgraceful ones."—Lord Beaconsfield, " His Majesty then taking me into his hands and stroking me gently used these words, which I shall never forget:—' My little friend Grildrig (who had given a laudatory account of the Peers, Spiritual and Temporal), you have made a most valuable panegyric. You have clearly proved that ignorance, idleness, and vice may be sometimes the only ingredients for qualifying a legislator. I observe among you some lines of an institution, which, in the original might have been tolerable; but those half erased and the rest wholly blurred and blotted by corruption. It doth not appear that men were ennobled on account of their virtue, or that priests were advanced for their piety or learning; and by what I have gathered from your answers, you are the most pernicious race of little odious vermin that nature ever suffered to crawl on the surface.of the earth.'' —Swift. Gulliver in Brobdignag. " That which the palmer-worm hath left the locust hath eaten ; and that which the locust hath left hath the canker-worm eaten; and that which the canker-worm hath left the caterpillar hath eaten."—Joel. Third Epoch (1688—1832). THE " Glorious Revolution " of 1688 was almost as disas¬ trous an event for the English People as the " Blessed Restoration." It was made by the Anglican bishops and a handful of noble lords, who dreaded that if James the Second</page><page sequence="54">54 BURROWING ANIMALS should proceed further in his Romanizing policy they might be called upon to disgorge their estates, which had been carved out of church property. In the whole history of ecclesiastical hypocrisy there is nothing to match the effrontery of the passive-obedience-preaching Churchmen, the cruel perseci to_sof Dissenters, the bigots and authors of Uniformity Acts, Five Mile Acts, and Non-Resistance Bills, coming forward as the champions of civil and religious liberty. The moment they saw their livings and sees in danger from James's Romans, passive obedience was cast off like a worn surplice. The noble lay conspirators likewise saw their opportunity. Dutch William cared nothing for royal sway in England, pro¬ vided he could bleed the country to his heart's content of men and money for his continental wars. This suited the " Revo¬ lution Houses " exactly. Having relieved themselves of the land tax, which was practically a war tax, they were the only class in the community who had nothing to lose, but every¬ thing to gain, by foreign wars. War provided younger sons with army and navy commissions, and the more ports that were closed to commerce, the higher rose the price of agricultural produce, and the higher rent. " A long war and a short crop " became the favourite toast of peers and country gentlemen. In 1688 wheat, which had occasionally valued 26s. per quarter, stood at 46s. By 1773, under the fostering care of the " Revolution Houses," the price had mounted up to 127s. At the close of the long struggle it was still 116s. The price of meat was sextupled; of cheese quintupled ; of butter quadrupled ; of shoes trebled ; and of all other articles of food and clothing in proportion. From the accession of William and Mary, down to the Reform Bill of 1832, there was literally no check on the un¬ bridled sway of the aristocracy. For all the bloody wars waged against liberty in the New World and the Old, during that calamitous period, they, and they alone, were responsible. The House of Commons was merely an outpost of the Lords, almost wholly manned by brothers and brothers-in-law, uncles and nephews. They might very well have sat in one chamber. " All were John Thompson's bairns" Five-sixths of the Lower were directly or indirectly " placed " by the " Upper " House.</page><page sequence="55">BURROWING ANIMALS. 55 The wars waged by the aristocracy from 1688 downwards, it has been estimated, have cost the nation the inconceivable sum of ^"3,430,000,000 in payments ; ^"2,790,000,000 in interest on Debt; while £"750,000,000 odd remain to be paid, to say nothing of the sacrifice of more than Two Millions of precious British lives, Every one of these barbarous enterprises, of which the National Debt is a perpetual reminder, posterity will condemn, has indeed already con¬ demned, as a flagrant crime. Mr. Labouchere has been rallied for affirming at the Great St. James's Hall meeting at the end of last session that the House of Lords has inflicted greater calamities on the nation than all the thieves' kitchens in the land ; but really he greatly understated the facts. To let loose five thousand panthers among us would be a trifle to being saddled with five hundred peers. Marlborough's famous victories all ended in—Blenheim Park and the perpetual pension which the Government recently commuted for the shameful sum of £"107,000, administering to Mr. Bradlaugh a studied insult in the process. John Churchill was not merely repeatedly guilty of high treason; but he was convicted by Parliament of em¬ bezzling public moneys to the extent of £"400,000 and upwards. He escaped punishment. Why marvel at the assurance of the descendants of such a successful rogue The American war cost us £"136,000,000, and the grandest heritage on the planet—the now United States. We spent a billion and a quarter to restore the Bourbons, and lo! M. Grevy is President of the French Republic! So much for the statesmanlike fore¬ sight of our Old Nobility! Is it not time that this incorrigible ring of evil-doers should be rooted out once and for all Were one to impugn the moral government of this world, what stronger argument could be found than the continued existence of the House of Lords The " glorious Revolution " of 1688, from which we are wont to date so many imaginary national blessings, really had the effect of subjecting both the People and the Crown to the aristocracy. From 1688 to 1832 their power was simply unlimited. They brought in Dutch William, but with very few exceptions the " pure patriots " of the Revolution maintained a clandestine correspondence with the exiled James II. This William III. knew full well, and to keep</page><page sequence="56">56 BURROWING ANIMALS. them to their allegiance he was obliged to bribe his aristo¬ cratic supporters with gifts of nearly the whole of the Crown lands and of vast estates of outlawed Jacobites in Ireland and England. When William died it was found that the revenue of all the Crown lands that remained unalienated did not amount to more than £"15,000 per annum. Even as late as Charles II.'s reign they were rented at £"263,000. The Sidneys, Bentincks, Pellings, Ginckels, Rouvignys, and other native and foreign cormorants, robbed the nation of this magnificent heritage, and to compensate the Crown for its losses they invented the Civil List. In a word, the people were saddled directly with the cost of royalty, which at this moment amounts to a round million sterling per annum. One result of this nefarious transaction they were unable to foresee. Paupers are never popular, and royal pauperism is infinitely more objectionable than proletariat pauperism. Even " the Divinity that doth hedge a king " is not a very imposing figure begging-box in hand. By this notorious rob¬ bery, however, the aristocracy contrived thoroughly to manipulate the Crown. It remains to be seen how they were able to subjugate the people. Their chief weaponswereparliamentarycorruption and foreign wars. In 1785 it was shown beyond cavil that in a popu¬ lation of 30,000,000 only 15,000 enjoyed the franchise. Thirty- five constituencies having no electors at all returned seventy- five hon. members to parliament. Forty-six other places, each with less than fifty electors, returned ninety members. Ninety-seven members were actually nominated ; seventy were indirectly appointed by peers and the Treasury; 139 more were placed by individual commoners; m a word, a clear majority of the House of Commons were the nominees of 160 persons. It was to preserve this monstrous state of things intact that the aristocracy, down to 1832, the year of the Reform Bill, strained every nerve. It was for this intolerable regime that the Duke of Wellington was willing to risk a bloody revolution had he but been able to satisfy himself that the military would fire on the people. It was the dread that the soldiers would fraternise with the reformers when the crisis culminated that alone saved England from the horrors of a civil war.</page><page sequence="57">BURROWING ANIMALS. 57 Attempts, gallant attempts, there had been before 1832 to deprive the aristocracy of some portion of the unbounded power which they had contrived to concentrate in their hands, Sir Francis Dashwood in 1745; the younger Pitt in 1782; Mr. Grey in 1785 and again in 1795 and 1797; and Sir Francis Burdett in 1S19, had raised the question of reform, but raised it in vain. Bribery completely stifled the voice of the nation. The aristocratic revolutionists of 1688 were nearly all bribers or bribees. Mr. Speaker received one thousand pounds for expediting the passage of an Orphans Bill through the House, and was expelled for his clumsiness in the trans¬ action ; so also was the Chairman of Committees, who was equally imprudent. Danby, the Duke of Leeds, Lord President of the Council, was likewise convicted of accepting large bribes from the old East India Company, which in a single year spent no less than £"167,000 in secret service money. Danby contended that the interests of the glorious Revolution were involved in his pocketing the money of the East India Company! Wyndham thus faithfully summarised the situation:—" A minister possessed of immense wealth, the plunder of the nation, with a parliament chiefly composed of men whose seats are purchased, and whose votes are bought at the ex¬ pense of the public treasure." In ten years Walpole spent £"1,453,000 of " Secret-service" money! The bursting of the South Sea Bubble was an event which revealed to the meanest intelligence the true character of government by aristocracy. The Prime Minister, Sunder¬ land, pocketed bribes amounting to £"50,000 ; Mr. Secretary Craggs, £"30,000 ; the King's German mistresses, £"30,000, and. so on, from the greatest even to the least. But if the aristocracy thus shamelessly pillaged the nation for themselves, what is still more astonishing is that they were almost equally generous with their country's money in their dealings with Continental despots and princelings. Wherever freedom dared to lift its head abroad, there was {he purse of England open for its suppression. We not merely fought for despotism everywhere, but we paid the despots to fight for themselves. The long war waged against Louis XIV., as has been said, practically ended in the status</page><page sequence="58">58 BURROWING ANIMALS. quo ante helium—plus Blenheim Park and the Marlborough Perpetual Pension. The- Tory aristocrats, to spite the Whig aristocrats, stepped in at the very nick of time, and by the Treaty of Utrecht, secured to the Grand Monarque in his defeat almost all the fruits of victory. We then undertook to prevent the seizure of Silesia by that unprincipled Prussian, Frederick, whom even Carlyle's genius could not convert into other than an unmitigated scamp. The Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle formally secured to the Prussian robber his booty. After this we thought well to become the ally of such a successful thief. Having outraged Austria, it was time for Frederick to attack almost equally unoffending Saxony. We not merely lent him troops, but paid the ruffian £"670,000 per annum by way of subsidy. This step brought down on us Russia, France, Spain, and Austria, and ultimately lost us the United States ; for it is very doubtful if, without French aid, the colonists would have been able single handed to make head against the heavy odds opposed to them. After a long struggle with Spain we contrived by treaty to secure a great and honourable triumph. The " Assienta," a monopoly to supply the South American slave-markets with kidnapped Africans, was conceded to us for a period of four years True, the petty German despots came to our aid in the fratricidal struggle with our " kin beyond sea." That was to be expected in so bad a cause, but, as usual, they did nothing without ample backsheesh. The Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel had his £"10,000 per annum, the Duke of Brunswick his £"15,000, and the Prince of Hesse, who kidnapped a paltry 688 of his subjects for us, his £"6,000. It was even worse in the dreadful struggle to restore the Bourbons and to keep the worn-out monarchies and aristo¬ cracies of Europe on their feet. France rose in her might, and proclaimed to an astonished world the Rights of Man. England paid every tyrant, great and small, who would raise or promise to raise an armed hand against the Revolution. The Austrian Autocrat was encouraged to defend his throne by an annual subsidy, varying from a million and a half to two millions. The Russian Autocrat generally got from two to three millions yearly to enable him to maintain intact in his dominions the sacred heritage of serfdom. The Duke of</page><page sequence="59">BURROWING ANIMALS. 59 Brunswick, for a miserable contingent of 2,200 men, was allowed £"16,000 per annum; and even the services of the pirate Dey of Algiers were eagerly secured in this unholy crusade against liberty. In a single year the despots of the Continent were glutted with £"14.000,000 of British gold to encourage them to keep their wretched subjects in thraldom. These enormous sums, the pillage of the English Treasury, on which the toilers of this unhappy country are still paying interest in the shape of national debt, were almost wholly lost or fraudulently misapplied. When Napoleon made a conquest, he also made a " requisition," and the requisition was generally satisfied out of English subsidies. His majesty of Prussia peremptorily demanded upwards of two millions to enable him to take the field against the French in the Netherlands in conjunction with a British force. The sum was paid, and no sooner had he clutched the money than he set off to assist Russia in suppressing " Warsaw's last champion," Kosciusko. Poland was finally partitioned with British gold. Nice allies these Prussian vultures and Russian bears, but exactly such as our old nobility might have been expected to honour with their friendship and glut with gold which it was theirs to spend, but not to earn. The whole of this dreadful period of unbridled aristocracy is marked by a long train of bloodshed, corruption, debt, and protectionist legislation. The Corn-laws kept the people's stomachs empty of food, and the pockets of the peers and their relations full of rent. And yet, strange to say, even in those halcyon days it was found then, as always, difficult to keep our Old Nobility alive. George the Third had to recruit the diminishing brood of vampires by the creation, or restora¬ tion, as it was euphemistically called in some cases, of no fewer than 522 brand new peerages. If ever the English people can be aroused to an adequate sense of the terrible crimes which the aristocracy have per¬ petrated in their name and at their expense, they will either repudiate the National Debt altogether or lay its burden wholly on the shoulders of the class who have so long befooled and plundered them. If ever the National Debt—</page><page sequence="60">6o BURROWING ANIMALS. her Majesty's Debt, as it ought to be called—is to be paid off, let rent and not industry be the sufferer. As soon as the Land Restoration Leagues of England and Scotland have attained their object, as soon as rent begins to flow into the local treasuries or the imperial Exchequer instead of the pockets of noble lords and their squirearchical satellities, it will be easy to liquidate the national debt and to solve a good many other knotty pioblems at present insoluble.</page><page sequence="61">6i CHAPTER VII. TEMPORARY REJECTORS. " Since the Revolution of 1688 cruelty and oppression have been legalized, but the interior history, the social proceedings and everyday life of our rulers since that time would hardly appear less frightful than the horrors of ancient days. A more despicable set of wretches cannot be found than the nobles of England under the Georges. Licentious, mean, in every way thoroughly corrupt and cruel, it would be difficult to find their su¬ periors in vice in the world's history. The history that would fairly state all these things has yet to be written."—J. A. Roebuck. "Since the Reform Act the House of Lords has become a revising and suspending house. The house has ceased to be one of latent directors, and has become one of temporary rejectors and palpable alterers." —Walter Bagehot. Fourth Epoch (1832—1884). TEMPORARY rejectors and palpable alterers! This truly is the miserable function fulfilled by the Peers since the Reform Act of 1832. By that Act their power for mischief was curtailed, but their will to do harm has undergone no change whatever. Formerly they did evil, now they prevent good. Irish patriots we have seen dragged from their seats in the Commons because they obstructed Coercion Bills which were a disgrace to the Gladstone Ministry and the entire Liberal party; but here we have a House of arch-obstructionists, with no other visible object in life but to arrest the march of civilization—to prevent the emancipation of the oppressed. And strange to say, until the other day it has never been seriously proposed for more than two centuries to rid the country once and for all of this mediaeval hulk so inconveniently stranded in the mid-channel of nineteenth century progress. The oft-told tale of lordly opposition to the Reform Bill of</page><page sequence="62">62 TEMPORARY REJECTORS. 1832 it is not necessary to repeat. Suffice it to say, that at a time when there were not more than 15,000 electors in a population of 30,000,000, and when more than half the House of Commons were the simple nominees of peers, the Duke of Wellington, as Prime Minister and leader of the Upper Chamber, declared, "I am fully convinced that the country now possesses a legislature which answers all the good purposes of legislation, and this to a greater degree than any legislature ever has answered in any other country whatever. I will go further, and say that the legislature and the system of representation deservedly possess the full and entire confi¬ dence of the country." Lord Kenyon tersely summed up the sentiments of his brother peers, when he prophesied a few days before the passing of the Act, " The Bill will be the de¬ struction of the monarchy. (Would it had By forcing this measure on his reluctant sovereign, the noble Earl (Grey) has placed the king in a situation in which he could make no choice of a minister ; and his advice to exercise his preroga¬ tive in so unconstitutional a manner as to destroy the in¬ dependence of the House is abandoned and atrocious." Howbeit, this atrocity had the effect of saving the nation from all the horrors of revolution. Twenty-four hours' further delay, and crown and coronet would have rolled in bloody dust. If the king had not been induced to sanction a fresh creation of peers, the madness of the Lords would certainly have carried them on to destruction. On October 7th, 1831, they had rejected the Reform Bill by a majority of 199 to 158. Out of twenty-two Christian bishops only one could be induced to vote for the enfranchisement of the people. But though cowed by the formidable attitude of the people, the Lords were by no means reconciled to parliamentary re¬ form. In 1833 they rejected with very little ceremony Bills for the disfranchisement of the corrupt " freemen" of Stafford, Liverpool, Warwick, and Carrickfergus. In the same session they " amended " an excellent Bribery Preven¬ tion Bill out of existence, and in 1848 they threw out another similar measure bodily because it iniquitously proposed to disfranchise for life anyone convicted by an election com¬ mission of unblushing corruption. Men who could thus shield corruption were not likely to do aught to diminish the</page><page sequence="63">TEMPORARY REJECTORS. 63 scandalous cost of elections. Accordingly, in 1852, they rejected a measure for limiting the poll in counties to a single day. The Lords have always been singularly vigilant in render¬ ing the electoral register as inaccessible as possible. In 1857 it was proposed to allow an elector who had paid his rates to within six months of voting to exercise his right. The Lords held that the voter must have paid up to the date of election. They likewise disqualified electors who had changed their residence between registration and registration, and in 1838 they caused the loss of a useful Bill because it sought to enable trustees, as such, to exercise the franchise. In the Reform Bill of 1867, which probably escaped rejec¬ tion because it was the handiwork of a Conservative Govern¬ ment, they contrived to insert the abomination of three- cornered constituencies, and but for the firmness of the Commons they would otherwise have disfigured that measure even more seriously. In 1871 the peers threw out the Ballot Bill by a majority of forty-nine. The following year they read the Bill a second time, but insisted that secrecy should be optional. Eventually they reluctantly permitted secret voting to become the law of the land. As regards the Reform Bill of 1884, they have assumed such an attitude of insolent defiance that it is not too much to say that a large majority of the people have determined not to mend, but to end them. Disguise it as they may, they have deliberately attempted to usurp the Crown's prerogative to dissolve parliament, in the hope that a Conservative majority may be returned to the House of Commons—a majority prepared to aid them in manipulating the consti¬ tuencies in the interests of Toryism. So much for the peers and rsform. Next in importance to the relation of the people to the suffrage—nay, perhaps first in importance—comes their relation to the land. Let us see how the peers have dealt with this great question. The House of Lords is really a House of Landlords. The noble five hundred share among them nearly a fifth of the available soil of the country, and their brothers and nephews, uncles and aunts, hold most of the remainder. The peers alone extract from the toilers and</page><page sequence="64">64 TEMPORARY REJECTORS. spinners of the nation nearly £"12,000,000 per annum in the shape of rent. But for this unearned and unheard-of wealth, their pretended blue blood would avail them but little. Were it not for their bread acres they would have been ignomi- niously drummed out of St. Stephen's long ago. It may be true that " knowledge is power," but it is still truer that acres are power. This truth the aristocracy of England, at every stage of their shameful history, have appreciated so keenly, that in order to illustrate the proposi¬ tion they have not hesitated to rob successively the People, the Church, and the Crown of nearly all that once was theirs. The theft of the commons by Enclosure Acts was a mere matter of detail. And theoretically, as well as historically, the Lords are merely a chamber of robbers. Land is the free gift of God to all men, as much as the air we breathe. Hence its owner¬ ship is necessarily in society as a whole, and not in indivi¬ duals, let the process of acquisition be never so innocent. This being so, the land robbers of the Upper Chamber, as might have been expected, have dealt with their booty in much the same way as a crew of pirates would treat a captured merchantman. Rent is the cargo of the prize: eviction is equivalent to walking the plank; tenancy-at-will is the slavery into which buccaneers were wont to sell their victims. In a word, the House of Landlords have from first to last regarded the national soil of Great Britain and Ireland—of Ireland more particularly—not as the property of the people, but as their property. The dealings of the peers with the Irish land question will best illustrate the manner in which noble lords hold that it is competent for them "to do as'they like with their own." In 1845 the Devon Commission, composed exclusively of landlords, reported that the Irish tenants were subject to " greater sufferings than the people of any other country in Europe," and recommended compensation for improvements and for disturbance. Lord Stanley framed a Bill in harmony with the report, but notwithstanding that it was backed by a Conservative Government, it was successfully strangled in the Lords, and for five-and-twenty years more, Irishmen continued to endure " greater sufferings than the people of any other country in Europe."</page><page sequence="65">TEMPORARY REJECTORS. 65 In 1854 several Bills were introduced by Lord Aberdeen's Government to give compensation to Irish tenants for the reclamation of bog, the construction of roads and fences, the building of homesteads, of outbuildings, &amp;c. The Lords " amended " or ended them all out of existence. " It is notorious," said Sir J. Napier in 1855, " tnat tne House of Lords will pass no such measure, and that for a Government to propose it to them or pretend to support it is an imposture and a sham." In i860 an Irish Land Act was passed simplybecause.it did not contain a single provision of the least use to the tenant. Subsequent attempts in 1865, and 1867 to legislate on the lines of the Devon Commission were defeated without difficulty, and it was not till 1870 that a little headway was made. In that year Mr. Gladstone brought in a Bill which, but for the " amendments " on which noble lords insisted, might have spared us the terrible experiences that culminated in the butchery of Lord Frederick Cavendish and Mr. Burke. The Bill, as it left the Commons, empowered the farmers to sub-let small portions of their farms to their labourers. It moreover secured to tenants not in arrears compensation for eviction not exceeding seven years' rent; and what was still more important, it allowed compensation to tenants in arrear in such special cases as a failure of crops, &amp;c. Both these provisions the peers obdurately struck out of, the Bill,, with most disastrous results. In 1878 and 1879 the crops were all but a complete failure,, and the tenants necessarily fell into arrears by the thousand. A tenant two years in arrear of rent might be entitled in equity to five years' compensation for disturbance, but it mattered not. The provision for his protection in the Bill of 1870 had been deleted by the Peers, and he and his were at the mercy of the merciless evictor. There was yet time to repent- In 1880 Mr. Gladstone introduced a short Compensation for Disturbance Bill, practically reviving the clauses eliminated from the Bill of 1870. But his solemn warning to the Peers- availed nothing. By a majority of 282 votes to 51 they re¬ jected the measure. In sheer despair the downtrodden people determined to ' temper such intolerable despotism by assassination.' It is easy to lift up hands of holy horror; but F</page><page sequence="66">6 TEMPORARY REJECTORS. " death by starvation " cannot be endured by mortal men with equanimity. Besides, it ought never to be forgotten that Irishmen, unlike Englishmen and Scotsmen, are for¬ bidden the legitimate use of arms. They are as brave as any race under the sun, and but for the Arms Act would almost certainly have fought us gallantly in the open against what¬ ever odds. The existence of this Act explains if it does not justify some of the worst deeds of violence. " Beware," cried these ruined men, " Lest when our latest hope is fled Ye taste of our despair, And learn by proof in some wild hour How much the wretched dare." The lesson they taught was not lost. It required such strong medicine to secure the passage of the Irish Land Act of 1881 and the Arrears Act of 1882. Then the Lords showed once more that though they will yield nothing to reason or a sense of justice, they will concede almost anything to fear. They of course " amended " both the Land Bill and the Arrears Bill; but the Commons, with an incensed nation at their back, were resolute, and, nolens volens, they had to swallow both these bitter pills with many wry faces. They were small, inadequate pills, it is true; but they were the most nauseous that have ever been administered to the Land¬ lords' House. Fair rents and fixity of tenure wrested from us, and the luxury of eviction rapidly going! Alas alas! what next—and next Since the beginning of the century England and Scotland may be said, generally speaking, to have been governed by the House of Commons. Ireland, on the contrary, has been ruled by the Lords, and we have only to " look on this picture and on that," to apprehend how great is the difference between the responsible and the irresponsible control of a people. "Whyare the Irish discontented?" asked O'Connell, in the House of Commons. " Because," said he, "for seven hundred years England has governed them by a faction and for a faction." In 1829 the peers yielded to the demand for Catholic eman¬ cipation, only on condition that the Irish forty-shilling free¬ holders should be disfranchised. The Reform Bill of 1832 gave the suffrage to nineteen out</page><page sequence="67">TEMPORARY REJECTORS. 67 of every hundred adult males in England; in Ireland the percentage was not over five. Ministers admitted the glaring inequality; but in the face of a hostile majority in the Lords they were powerless. In 1835, 1880, and in 1883 a Bill to assimilate the Irish to the English registration system passed the Commons, and was presented to the Lords. The measure would, to some extent, have increased the Irish electorate by the removal of galling impediments, but on each occasion the hereditary chamber threw it out. On the first opportunity it was re¬ jected on a division by three to one ; on the last by fifty-two votes to thirty-two. In 1837 a Bill to afford Irish electors better polling facilities in large towns was extinguished by a hostile lordly majority of seventy-four to thirty-six. In 1850, when twenty-eight out of every hundred adult Englishmen had the franchise, the percentage in Ireland was two. To remove this inequality a Bill with an eight pound ratal qualification was sent up to the Lords. They fixed the rating at fifteen pounds, and it was not without the greatest difficulty that they could be induced to agree to a twelve pound rating compromise. As it was, they managed to ex¬ clude 90,000 " capable citizens" from the suffrage. As matters now stand, while the population of an English borough has the suffrage in the ratio of one in seven, in Ireland it is in the proportion of one in eighteen. In 1835, in 1836, in 1837, in 1838, in 1839, and in 1840 strenuous attempts were made to reform, as in England and Scotland, the close municipal corporations of Ireland, but to no purpose. The Lords defied the Commons, and Irish municipal reform had finally to be abandoned. One Bill, that of 1836, contained 140 clauses. The Lords struck out 106 of them, and wrecked the measure beyond recognition. In 1834, 1835, 1836, and 1837, an Irish Tithe Abatement Bill heartily supported by O'Connell and an immense ma¬ jority of the Commons—a majority, in 1837, of 229 to 13— suffered shipwreck in the Lords. In 1838, they permitted it to pass on condition that the Appropriation Clause, the most important in the Bill, should be struck out. Why Because their lordships held that it would be sacrilege to devote any f 2</page><page sequence="68">68 TEMPORARY REJECTORS. portion of the revenues of the Church to national purposes. It was not till 1869 that eventual retribution came in the dis- endowment of the alien Church in Ireland. Is it possible that even the treacherous Whigs, with all their hollow compromises—nay that even the Grand Old Man himself—can much longer preserve this " hospital for incurables," as Chesterfield justly called, the House of Lords, from destruction Their fate is vividy pourtrayed in the Scottish Kirk's metrical paraphrase of Job xiv. 1—15 :— " Guilty and frail, how shalt thou stand Before thy Sovereign Lord (the people) Can troubled and polluted springs A hallowed stream afford Determined are the days that fly Successive o'er thy head ; The numbered hour is on the wing. That lays thee with the dead." " March without the people," says Ledru Rollin, " and you march into night; their instincts are a finger-pointing of Providence always turned towards real benefit." It is the one function of the Peers to " march into night." Privilege afflicts them with a second nature, which causes them, like bats and owls, to prefer the darkness to light. They are politically reprobrate, and incapable of repentance. In small things, as in great, it is their constant habit to devise illiberal things. They are not pious, as their frequent ap¬ pearances in divorce and police-courts fully testify ; yet they are uniformly orthodox. They are not permitted to burn heretics as of old, but they never miss a favourable chance of harassing and insulting their Nonconformist fellow-country¬ men. In 1834 it was proposed to permit more than twenty persons to meet in any private house for divine worship, without exacting from the worshippers any declaration of their religious tenets. This latitudinarianism shocked their lordships beyond measure, and they made haste to throw out the Bill. In 1834 a modest measure enabling Nonconformist students who had studied in their own " private colleges" within a university to take degrees, was thrown out by noble lords on the ground that such a concession would " poison the wells of religion and virtue," and it was not till 1854 that the virus of</page><page sequence="69">TEMPORARY REJECTORS. 69 dissent was permitted to contaminate the pure springs of Anglican sanctity. In that year relief was granted on con¬ dition that non-juring students should enjoy no university emoluments, and it was not till 1871 that religious tests for fellowships, scholarships, &amp;c, were finally abolished. Twice did the Peers reject the Test Abolition Bill by overwhelming majorities after it had been read a second time without a division in the House of Commons. Justice delayed for forty years in such a matter is enough to make the heart even of a lukewarm friend of freedom of conscience grow sick. The agitation for the abolition of church-rates had been active since 1843, but it was not till 1858 that the question got fairly before the legislature. Then a Bill passed the Commons by a majority of more than sixty. The Peers threw it out by a majority of fifty-one. In i860 their majority was even more decisive—viz., ninety-one. In 1867 they still held out with a majority of fifty-eight, but in 1869 their lord¬ ships were fain to capitulate without any of the honours of war. How any body of men can be so utterly devoid of self-respect as to be perpetually sacrificing their most cherished convictions on compulsion is past all understanding. In trying to preserve for the Civil Service Church, which is largely manned by their relations, the solid pudding of uni¬ versity fellowships and church-rates, some excuse may be made for the peers. Even Radicals are found not to despise the loaves and fishes of office. But what can be said for gratuitous insults that bring no grist to the mill Two samples of these lordly affronts to Dissenters will suffice to show the malignant spirit of caste. In 1836 noble lords in the Dissenters' Marriage Act stipu¬ lated that whoever should take exception to the Church service should be condemned to have their marriage banns read before the board of guardians Two years previously they had amended a Poor-law Bill so as to prevent Noncon¬ formist pastors from obtaining access to workhouses, be the inmates of whatever religious persuasion they might. " Poison the wells of pauper religion and virtue," would you, ye im¬ penitent offspring of the Roundheads Mr. Chamberlain told us but yesterday that as a Dissenter he has an account to settle with the peers, and that he will not forget the</page><page sequence="70">70 TEMPORARY REJECTORS. reckoning. More power to his elbow England at this moment requires a leader like Pym, who will lead public opinion, and not be content reluctantly to follow it. Not satisfied with harassing the Dissenters while alive, noble lords have even carried their animosity into the silent graveyard, " where the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest." They have striven hard to convert " God's Acre " into a Church monopoly. For ten years they successfully opposed the Burials Bill, which became law in 1880, and even then they contrived to exclude Jews and all non-Christians from the benefit of the measure. Hebrew Tories, of whom we have so many odious specimens, are really the most ungrateful of men. For five-and-twenty years—till 1858—the Lords, session after session, spurned their claims to sit in parliament after they had been recognisd by immense majorities in the Commons. One would naturally have expected the chosen people to have much the same feelings towards noble lords as their ancestors entertained for Philistines, Hivites, and Hittites. Howbeit they lick the hand that smote, and they know best. It was hardly to be expected that the relentless foes of religious liberty would be much enamoured of educational enlightenment. When the first grant for national education (£"30,000) was passed by the Commons, the Lords' condem¬ nation of the proposal was unequivocal, 229 votes to 118. They did all they dared to spoil the Education Act of 1870, ex¬ punging in particular a clause permitting school boards to give free education in certain cases. Free education, as in the American Republic, is a necessity almost as pressing as suffrage extension or the solution of the land question. The sagacious peers saw the danger lurking under the clause. It was the thin end of the wedge of free national education, and they peremptorily declined to sanction its insertion. Against every extension of the principle of local self- government the Peers have invariably set their faces, maiming remorselessly when they dared not kill. The Great Municipal Corporation Bill (1835), as originally " amended " by the House of Lords, was a sight to see. They restored the corrupt " freemen " to the register; they made town clerks irremovable; they gave indirectly-elected aldermen life tenure of office; they excluded Nonconformist councillors from the</page><page sequence="71">TEMPORARY REJECTORS. 71 exercise of Church patronage; they insisted on a high pro¬ perty qualification; and they deprived corporations of the right to nominate justices. The country indignantly refused to accept most of these and other " amendments ;" but what¬ ever blemishes there are in the statesman-like Corporations Act are to be laid to the door of the Peers. The loss of right to nominate justices, and the vicious system of electing aldermen, are among the worst results of their mischievous interference. In 1838 they rejected a Bill empowering municipal justices to exercise the same control over town gaols as county justices possessed in counties. They took particular exception to a clause sanctioning the appointment of chaplains other than Anglican parsons. Study any recent statute, and if you stumble on a section limiting its usefulness, ten to one you will discover, on reference to Hansard, that it is the handi¬ work of the Lords. The Peers have always exerted themselves with peculiar energy to retain on the statute book as many barbarities of the penal code as they conveniently could. Their love of the hangman was, and is, ardent. With the utmost reluctance were they induced to restrict the death-penalty to cases of wilful murder. But blood they must have in some form. The revolting torture of domestic pigeons commended itself to the noble lords in 1883 as a manly British " sport." Mr. Anderson's humane Pigeon Shooting Bill was thrown out by a majority of two to one, Lord Fortescue remarking that it was " a frivolous Bill which it was trifling with the time of the House to bring forward." For the weak, the peers have no bowels of compassion. Witness their rejection, in 1838, of the Custody of Infants Bill, giving a woman separated from her husband, through no fault of her own, access to her children; their mutilation in 1842, of the Children Regulation Bill, protecting women and children from toil more crushing than was ever inflicted on negro slaves; their elimination from the Mines Bill (i860) of the clauses securing the pit-boys of tender years fixed hours of instruction ; and their futile attempt in 1880 to delete from the Employers' Liability Bill the clause rendering employers responsible for the acts of those to whom they delegate authority.</page><page sequence="72">72 TEMPORARY REJECTORS. There is in the House of Lords, a non-hereditary element— the Spiritual Peers—the twenty-six representatives of the Civil Service Church. They are a " survival" from those early common-sense times when men were summoned to the Commune Concilium Regni, not because they had "taken the trouble to be born," but because by reason of their piety and superior learning they were, or were supposed to be, the fittest councillors of the monarch. However this may once have been, it is very certain that for centuries they have out- Heroded their strictly hereditary co-legislators in trampling on every popular right, in violating every precept of the Christian religion. " It is a melancholy thing," says Sidney Smith, " to see men clothed in soft raiment, lodged in a public palace, endowed with a rich portion of other men's industry using their influence to deepen the ignorance and inflame the fury of their fellow-creatures." A bare record of some of their more recent enormities ought to satisfy even Churchmen that their career as legis¬ lators should at once be terminated. In 1807 power was sought by Bill to enable magistrates to provide rate-supported schools wherever they were wanted. It was a highly necessary, moderate, and efficient measure. The Archbishop of Canterbury lifted up his testimony against it, and it was rejected without a division. " Their lordships would feel," he unctuously said, " how dangerous it might be to innovate in such matters. Their lordships' prudence would, no doubt, guard against innova¬ tions that might shake the foundations of our religion." In 1810, "shop-lifting" to the extent of five shillings and upwards was punishable by death. It was proposed by Bill to substitute for the death-penalty transportation for life. The measure was rejected by a vote of 31 to 11. Not a single bishop was found in the minority; seven voted in the majority. It is almost incredible to conceive that at the beginning of this century 223 offences required the interven¬ tion of the hangman. Whenever it was proposed by Sir Samuel Romilly, Lord Holland, and other humane men to disestablish this hideous functionary, the bishops by voice and vote sedulously " guarded against innovations that might shake the foundations of religion."</page><page sequence="73">TEMPORARY REJECTORS: 73 In 1821 it was proposed to enable Roman Catholics to sit in parliament. Twenty-five bishops voted against the Bill, which was thrown out by a vote of 159 to 120. In 1822 a Bill was brought in to enable Roman Catholic peers to take their seats in the Upper House. Twenty-three bishops voted against it, and it was rejected. In 1829 a Catholic Emancipation Bill was eventually got through the Lords by a majority of 213 to 104; but small were the thanks due to the successors of the apostles, to the professed disciples of the Great Teacher who told the woman at the well of Samaria that the hour had come when the true worshippers should worship God in spirit and in truth— the hour when Samaritan mountains and Jewish Jerusalems, Anglican Establishments, and Papal Infallibilities should avail nothing. Twenty bishops voted against the third reading of the Catholic Emancipation Bill. In 1831 the Lords threw out the great Reform Bill by 199 votes to 158. Twenty-one bishops voted in the majority, his Grace of Canterbury declaring that it was " mischievous in its tendency, and would be extremely dangerous to the fabric of the constitution." In 1831 the Reform Bill passed the second reading in the Upper House by a vote of 184 to 175. Fifteen bishops were found in the minority. In 1833 the Jewish Disabilities Repeal Bill was introduced, and it was not till after a struggle of twenty-five years, not till 1858, that the Lords permitted it to become law. Twenty bishops voted against it in 1833, and eleven in 1858. Arch¬ bishop Howley held that " the moral and intellectual capacity of the Jews " disqualified them for all legislative duties. In 1834 twenty-two bishops voted to exclude the Dissenters from the universities. The Bill was lost, 187 to 85 noble lords voting against it. In 1839 it was proposed to appoint a committee of Privy Council to deal with matters affecting the education of the people. Fifteen bishops voted against the proposal, and it was rejected by 229 to 118 votes. Archbishop Howley led the opposition. In 1867, and again in 1869, the University Tests Aboli¬ tion Bill was rejected by the Lords. On both occasions a majority of the bishops who voted opposed the measure.</page><page sequence="74">74 TEMPORARY REJECTORS. In 1858 twenty-four bishops, as was to be expected, voted against the abolition of Church rates. The Bill was lost, there being a majority of 187 to 36 against it. Archbishop Sumner declared that Church rates were " essential to the permanent welfare of the Church." In i860 the Bill was again thrown out by a majority of 128 to 31. Sixteen bishops were in the majority. In i860, 1861, 1862, 1863, and in 1865, a Bill was brought in to abolish the declaration exacted from office-holders not to seek " to interfere with or weaken the Church, or disturb the said Church, or the bishops and clergy of the said Church, in the possession of any rights or privileges to which they are or may be by law entitled." On no occasion could more than one bishop be got to vote for the Bill. In 1865, the year before it was finally passed, ten episcopal legislators voted in the majority against it, In 1867 it was rejected for the third time. Seven bishops voted in the majority of eighty-two to twenty-four, and none in the minority. In 1876 sixteen, and in 1877eleven bishops voted to restrict the privilege of "Christian and orderly" funeral services in churchyards to Churchmen exclusively. In 1883 the Deceased's Wife's Sister Bill was lost on the third reading for the want of five votes. Seventeen bishops were in the majority. In 1883 one would naturally have expected the disciples of the gentle Nazarene who broke not the bruised reed, and whose mighty compassion embraced at once the " lilies of the field " and the " fowl of the air," would have had a word to say in favour of Mr. Anderson's Anti-Pigeon Torture Bill. But no; not a man of them thought it worth his while to speak or vote for the measure. The Prelates, it would appear, have aggregate salaries, &amp;c, amounting to £"166,771 with the patronage of 2,649 Benefices of the net annual value of £"887,733. A singular commentary is this truly on the pastoral equipments prescribed by Him who had not where to lay his head. " They should take nothing for their journey save a staff only; no scrip, no bread, no money in their purses: but be shod with sandals and not put on two coats." Mr. Russell Lowell in one of his finest poems—perhaps his finest—has admirably conceived a dialogue between the</page><page sequence="75">TEMPORARY REJECTORS. 75 returned Christ and such caricaturist exponents of his doc¬ trines as our Anglican Prelates:— " With gates of silver and bars of gold Ye have forced my sheep from their Father's fold; I have heard the dropping of their tears In heaven these eighteen hundred years." " O Lord and Master, not ours the guilt We build but as our father's built; Behold thine images how they stand Sovereign and sole through all our land." Then Christ sought out an artisan A low-browed, stunted, haggard man And a motherless girl whose fingers thin Pushed from her faintly want and sin, These set he in the midst of them, And as they draw back their garment-hem For fear of defilement, " Lo, here," said he, "The images ye have made of me! " It is not too much to say that there is not a good cause nor a respectable class in the whole community that has not experienced some injury or some contumely at the hands of our hereditary Episcopal legislators. In theory and in practice they are alike beyond endurance. Lord Salisbury recognises this and sighs for the creation of a Senate after the American model. He would " Americanize our institu¬ tions," the wicked innovator But perchance even this fond wish of his heart will be found unattainable. The torrent of democracy is not to be repelled even by a respectable sena¬ torial breakwater. In one of the ablest works (Mr. Lock- wood's volume, which appeared in New York the other day) on the American Constitution it is seriously proposed to abolish both the Presidency and the Senate as filthy mo¬ narchical rags. We recommend the book to Lord Salisbury, for early and careful perusal. It may be well at this stage to say a word or two on the utility of Second Chambers in general. Most countries, it is true, have imitated us in the division of their Legislatures into two Houses, but that proves nothing more than that man is a foolishly gregarious animal, ever prone to follow bell-wethers. If England had started not merely with a Second but with a Third and Fourth Legislative</page><page sequence="76">76 TEMPORARY REJECTORS. Chamber, there is no reason to doubt that it would have been generally discovered that the eternal fitness of things demanded that every legislature should consist of four houses. But if we were the first to start on a false track, let us also be the first to retrace our steps. I can see no better reason for a two- chambered Parliament than for two Town Councils with co-ordinate powers say in Birmingham or Manchester. The United States Senate is admittedly the giant of the whole forest of bi-cameral superstition and if I can effectually dispose of it, it will not matter much about the other senatorial brambles whether in Europe, South America or the Colonies. The origin of the American Senate was, everything con¬ sidered, almost as haphazard and irrational as that of the House of Lords. The original Articles of Confederation of the thirteen States correctly enough provided only for a single House, with an Executive Committee, the Committee to adminster the affairs of the State while the House was out of Session. But this rational arrangement was too good to last. The National Convention which gave the Constitution of the United States its present form contained a majority of politicians who, though they had been able to throw off the military yoke of England, were unable to divest themselves of the yoke of pernicious English precedents. They must have a King, Lords, and Commons in some shape. Accordingly, Article I., Section 3, was submitted: "The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each State, chosen by the Legislature thereof for six years, and each Senator shall have one vote." Of the debate that followed we know little, the Convention sitting with closed doors, as did likewise the Senate for the first five years of its existence ; but we know enough of the proceedings to point the moral of the wise Swede, Oxenstiern, " Behold, my son, with how little wisdom this world is governed! " Chief Justice Yates, of New York, made the following profound memorandum in his note-book :—" May 31st, 1787.—The 3rd resolve, to wit: ' That the National Legislature ought to consist of two branches.' N.B. As a previous resolution had already been agreed to, to have a Supreme Legislature, I could not see any objection to its being in two branches." Mr. Dickenson held that the Senate should be as like the British House of Lords as possible, and</page><page sequence="77">TEMPORARY REJECTORS. 77 consist of men of rank and property. The celebrated Alexander Hamilton was a great stickler for English forms, and wrote eloquently against " an improper consolidation of the States into a simple Republic." At the same time there were not lacking far-sighted men, like David Brearly, who advocated the complete obliteration of State lines, and the division of the whole country into equal parts based on population. Jefferson, also, was a One House man; and out of the thirteen States the delegates of three—the great State of New York being one of them—voted against the institution of a Second Chamber. The deliberations were naturally expedited by certain gnats, which infested the Convention Hall. In those days gentlemen encased their legs in silk stockings, which gave the pectiferous insects great advantages. The Senate met, and its members made the most ludicrous attempts to ape their hereditary English prototypes. Mr. Maclay kept a journal in which he describes the ceremony of the inauguration of President Washington :—" The President (of the Senate), Mr. Adams, rose in the most solemn manner. ' Gentlemen,' he said, ' I wish for the direction of the Senate. The President will, I suppose, address the Congress. How shall I behave How shall we receive it Shall it be standing or sitting ?' Mr. Lee began with the House of Commons, as is usual with him, then the House of Lords, then the King, and then back again. The result of his information was that the Lords sat and the Commons stood on the delivery of the King's Speech. ** Mr. Izard got up, and told how often he had been in the Houses of Parliament. He said a great deal of what he had seen there; made, how¬ ever, this sage discovery: that the Commons stood because they had no seats to sit in on being arrived at the House of Lords," &amp;c. But dearly was America to pay for this thoughtless adop¬ tion of English Monarchical forms, for this servile compromise of Republican principles. By giving power and dignity to the Senate, the House of Representatives has been degraded. Wherever two Chambers exist one must be master, and, unfortunately for the Western Republic, the master is the Aristocratic Upper Chamber. Hence Lord Salisbury's admiration for the American Senate, in which the little State of Delaware is put on a footing of equality with that of New York, with more than thirty times its population.</page><page sequence="78">78 TEMPORARY REJECTORS. The American Senators are individually superior to Mem¬ bers of the House of Representatives, but collectively they have ever been worse legislators. Take the crucial test of the Slavery Question. After the Mexican War the Repre¬ sentative House, by a majority of fourteen, passed a Bill admitting the conquered region as a territory, on condition that it should never be polluted by Slavery. The Senate would not so much as look at it. Again, in 1848, a Bill ex¬ cluding Slavery from the territory of California passed the House by a majority of thirty-nine. The Senate scornfully declined to consider it. By a majority of ninety-nine the House prohibited Slavery in Oregon. The Senate laid the Bill on the table, from which it was never lifted. In 1849 the Senate made an attempt to extend Slavery into the new territories by the daring expedient of affixing an enabling provision to the Appropriation Bill. The House, however, sternly rejected the amendment, and the Senate retreated. The idea of arresting the entire machinery of government in order to further the ends of slaveholders ought to have attractions for the mind of the descendant of that Cecil of whom Lord Clarendon wrote; "No act of power was ever proposed which he did not advance and advocate with the utmost rigour. No man so great a tyrant in this country." Suffice it to say that, but for the existence of the American Second Chamber, the Republic might have been spared all the horrors of the Civil War, with its holocaust of 900,000 lives and its loss of £"1,400,000,000 of treasure. What is wanted in the United States, in this country, and every other self-governing State, is a single Democratic Assembly, with an Executive Committee elected by and responsible to that Assembly. " Useless and dangerous" is stamped on the fa^j of every other more complex arrangement. ^h.? problem how the Lords are to be abolished is of easy solution. They cannot present themselves at the Gilded Chamber without writs, and these a Democratic Ministry could and would peremptorily stop. Should they come without writs, Inspector Denning could be instructed to take charge of them. Or the House of Commons could simply revive its resolution of 6th January, 1649, decreeing their abolition. Some fears have been expressed lest if this were done the</page><page sequence="79">TEMPORARY REJECTORS. 79 Peers should find their way into the House of Commons by the legitimate door of election. But why not If the people desire to be represented by gentlemen who neither " toil nor spin" let them. They will have none but themselves to blame if they are misrepresented. Besides, a sprinkling of Salisburys would give colour and variety to the popular assembly. We may have too much undiluted Grand Old Man; and I can even conceive of greater boons than a House of Commons exclusively composed of Broadhursts and Howells.</page><page sequence="80">8o CHAPTER VIII. BRIGHT EXAMPLES. " Not all that heralds rake from coffined clay, Nor florid prose, nor honied lies of rhyme, Can blazon evil deeds or consecrate a crime."—Byron. " The widow is gathering nettles for her children's dinner; a perfumed seigneur, delicately lounging in the CEil de Beuf, hath an alchemy whereby he will extract from her the third nettle, and call it rent."—Carlyle. IT has been shown pretty conclusively in previous chapters that the British aristocracy collectively have, from first to last, been public enemies of the most malignant type. It may now be well to glance at the achievements of a few of the more prominent families individually. Take the Churchills to begin with. How did they come to be hereditary rulers of England In this wise:— The Duke of York, afterwards James II., had an extraordinary taste for ugly mistresses; so much so, that one of them observed, " There are none of us handsome; and if we had wit, he (James) would not have the sense to find it out." Charles II. accounted for the plainness of his brother's harlots by maintaining that they were selected for him by his Father Confessor by way of penance. However, this singular love of female ugliness was the making of the Churchills. Arabella Churchill found her way into James's harem, and the fortunes of her brother, John Churchill, a penniless ensign, at once began to look up. He was a man of great intellectual ability, and undoubted physical courage, and being absolutely without</page><page sequence="81">BRIGHT EXAMPLES. 81 the impediment of a conscience, he rapidly improved his opportunities. The infamous Barbara Palmer, Duchess of Cleveland, the mistress of Charles II., conceived a violent passion for " handsome Jack," and on one occasion, when they were together, the king surprised them, and Churchill had to take a break-neck leap from her ladyship's bedroom window. The duchess rewarded this feat with a present of £"5,000, which the young man invested with the utmost prudence. This was the foundation of the family fortunes, which were subsequently augmented by contribu¬ tions from other court ladies, not less frail than Barbara Palmer. Virtue, it is affirmed, is its own exceeding great reward. This proposition can hardly be gainsaid, for the history of our old nobility conclusively shows that vice secures so many of the loaves and fishes, that hardly any¬ thing is left over to save virtue from penury. The career of John Churchill is one unbroken record of successful crime. Starting with hardly a sixpence in the world,, he was a major-general and a peer, both of England and Scot¬ land, before he was forty. " Faithful, but unfortunate," is the singularly inappropriate family motto. If it had run, " Faithless andfortunate," the mark would have been hit exactly. James II, reposed such complete confidence in the traitor, that he made him lieutenant-general of the kingdom. The very day before he deserted to William of Orange, he drew his sword in a council of war, and protested that he would shed the last drop of his blood in defence of his royal master. Marshal Schomberg told him roundly that he " was the first lieutenant- general he had ever heard of that had deserted his colours." Churchill had the effrontery to appeal to " the inviolable, dictates of his conscience and a necessary concern for his religion" as his excuse! Great Powers! Churchill's con¬ science Churchill's religion! For this abominable treachery he was made Earl of Marlborough by the Dutch king, who, however, was under no misapprehension as to the scoundrel's real character. Churchill, he held, " was a vile man, and he hated him, for though he could profit of treason, he could not bear the traitor." As a matter of fact, the earl was as faithless to William as to James. He was the centre of a G</page><page sequence="82">82 BRIGHT EXAMPLES. conspiracy to bring back the exiled tyrant, to whom he systematically betrayed the secrets of the Cabinet and the strength and dispositions of the military forces of Great Britain. Suspicion however fell on him, and he was arrested on a charge of high treason. By dint of the most unblushing falsehoods he soon contrived not merely to recover his liberty, but his command also. He at once plunged into fresh enormities. It was determined to send a secret expedition under General Talmash, to destroy Brest. Thereupon Churchill wrote to James, under date 4th May, 1694:—" It came to my knowledge what I now send you that the bomb vessels and the twelve regiments which are now encamped at Portsmouth, together with two marine regiments, are to be commanded by Talmash, and designed to burn the harbour of Brest, and to destroy the men-of-war there. This would be a great advantage to England, but no consideration can, or ever shall, hinder me from letting you know what I think may be for your service, so that you may make what use you please of this intelligence." Thus advised James warned Louis XIV., who at once re¬ warded the traitor with the gold for which he was ever clamorous, and prepared a warm reception for Talmash's force. The surprisers were the surprised. Eight hundred British soldiers fell, and their murderer enjoyed the recom¬ pense of his unheard-of villany When Queen Anne came to the throne, Marlborough and his wife, Sarah Jennings, were the de facto rulers of England, and of course the worthy couple took care to make ample provision for themselves in the distribution of public plunder. Between them they monopolized offices worth £"46,000 per annum. But even this vast income could not satisfy the rapacity of the man who " loved money better than woman or fame." He ^ook to wholesale embezzlement—the worst form of theft. The Commissioners of Public Accounts reported that, as commander-in-chief, he had pocketed £"63,000 from army bread contractors, besides corruptly receiving two and a half per cent, on the pay of foreign troops subsidized by England. Altogether, his defalcations amounted to more than £"400,000. The House of Commons resolved (1), " That the taking the several sums of money annually by the Duke of Marlborough, from the contractors</page><page sequence="83">BRIGHT EXAMPLES. 83 for furnishing the bread and bread-waggons for "the army in the Low Countries was unwarrantable and illegal;" and (2), " That the before mentioned two sums of £"282,366 9s. 7a., and £"177,695 17s. deducted from the troops in her majesty's pay, are public moneys, and ought to be accounted for." But though men called out to him in public places " Stop thief! " Churchill stuck to his plunder like a limpet, and not a penny could be recovered from him. Instead' of being compelled to disgorge his shameless gains, he was rewarded with that infamous perpetual pension which the present pattern duke commuted the other day for £"107,000! Against Queen Anne, as against Kings James and William, he plotted as he found occasion. Anne suspected him, and consulted the sagacious Lord Somers regarding him. Lord Somers told her that " Marlborough was the worst man that God Almighty ever made; that his ambition was boundless and his avarice insatiable; and that he had neither honour nor conscience to restrain him from any wicked attempt even against her person as well as against the country." Such, then, was the founder of this house of Marlborough. He had great ability, but it was the ability of the devil— ability divorced from honour, conscience, humanity. He was one of the greatest generals and one of the worst men Europe ever produced. The tendency to steal did not die out with John Churchill. The Dukes of Marlborough managed to secure the rangership of Wychwood Forest, in Oxfordshire, and when the Land Revenue Commissioners visited it they found that the then duke had practically made it his own in defiance of the terms of the grant. "The greatest part of the timber had been cut at much waste, and there is now very little left," was the Commissioners' plaintive report. The duke had, moreover, it was shown, " pocketed " in hard cash £862 6s. 3d., the property of the Crown. If, instead of being a duke, he had been a starving City clerk, he would have been speedily initiated into the mysteries of oakum- picking. Take next a family of British Brahmins of far more reput¬ able antecedents—the Cecils. The founder of this haughty family was one Richard Cecil, who, though Groom of the Robes to Henry VIII., contrived not merely to keep his head ;G 2</page><page sequence="84">84 BRIGHT EXAMPLES. on his shoulders, but even to fill his pockets. His father had been water bailiff of Whittlesea, and his grandfather, it is said, was a " publican." At all events, Lord Salisbury did not "come over at the Conquest." Dick Cecil did well in the courtier business. He first got hold of some Crown lands in Northamptonshire; then he annexed the priory of St. Michael, Stamford; next he absorbed the manor of Essendine, in Rutland; Tinwell manor, in Northamptonshire; to say nothing of grants made to him in Kent and Lincolnshire. William Cecil, the son of this robber, afterwards Lord Burghley, was still more successful in the trade of courtier. He began by devouring a hospital at Lincoln ; a monastery at Stamford; Ladybrigg Close, in Northamptonshire; the manors of Geddings and Boxe, in Hertfordshire, as well as the Hun¬ dreds of Hertford and Braughling. Burghley was a statesman who must have profited by the doctrines of Macchiavelli's Prince. He lived in plots, and has been justly described as " Spider " Cecil. He incessantly wove nets, from the meshes of which his victims rarely escaped. The rack was his great instrument of government, and he applied it with the utmost diligence. His son Robert Cecil, James the First's " little beagle," was, if possible, a more unprincipled upholder of despotism than his father. His unscrupulous abuse of power even shocked Lord Clarendon, the Tory and High Church historian. " No act of power," he bewails, " was ever proposed that he did not advance and execute with the utmost rigour. No man so great a tyrant in this country." He literally revelled in offices and sinecures of all kinds, and annexed manor after manor with unappeasable voracity. His talons were every¬ where—in York, Sussex, Kent, Norfolk, Essex. Nothing came wrong to him—abbeys, tithes, imposts on mines, glebe lands, advowsons, chases, warrens, profits of fairs, demesne lands and coppices in endless array. In the present Marquis of Salisbury all the tyrannical tra¬ ditions of the Cecils have received re-embodiment. The hard bargains he has driven with the Metropolitan Board of Works while endeavouring to improve his London property, and the costly litigation to which he has subjected the public, are simply scandalous. " Horrible Hatfield " is the outcome of his patriarchal notions of society and government. What</page><page sequence="85">BRIGHT EXAMPLES." 85' bitter irony it was to put this man on the Commission for the Better Housing of the Poor 1 Truly, Sir Charles Dilke has much to account for. " A king can make a belted knight, A marquis, duke, and a' that, But an honest man's aboon his might, Good faith he canna' fa' that." An exhaustive analysis of the peerage would show (i) how many noble lords owe their rank and estates to the rapine of conquest; (2) to royal favouritism; (3) to Church pillage; (4) to royal debauchery: (5) to purchase under the Stuarts; (6) to marriages of convenience; (7) to success in war; (8) to success in law, &amp;c. The late Lord Beaconsfleld held that all the chief sources of the peerage have been " dis¬ graceful," and it would be difficult, out of the five hundred existing creations, to point to five that can be set down to real merit. This proposition it would not be difficult to prove in detail; but I must be content with samples of the most and least creditable peerages. Having investigated the origin of two leading families of Tory aristocrats—the Churchills and the Cecils, it is but fair that I should now glance at two leading Whig families— the Cavendishes and the Russells. The Cavendishes are an old family—that is to say, they have a record, more or less genuine, for the last three centuries and a-half. It is also held to be a peculiarly honourable record. Be that as it may, such virtues as the Cavendishes possess have unquestionably been well rewarded. They have three peerages among them, and more than 220,000 acres ot the national soil, yielding them £"172,000 per annum. The first Cavendish, an obscure man, about whose origin very little is known, was employed by Henry VIII. as a well-qualified church-robber. He was Auditor of the Court of Augmentations, and he of course took very good care, like the rest of the Commissioners, not to augment the royal revenues alone. In 1540 he laid hold hold of the monastic lands of Cnilde- wicke, Cuffley, and Northawe, in Herefordshire. This was a promising start, which he promptly followed up by annexing Northawberry (Lincoln), and the site of Cardigan Priory, to say nothing of extensive raids into Cornwall and other</page><page sequence="86">86 BRIGHT EXAMPLES. counties. He was great in "exchanges," and generally appears to have had the best of the bargains he made, especially in his dealings with the Crown. He did not speculate in Church lands alone. He was almost as provident in the matter of wives. His third spouse, " Bess of Hardwicke," was a much-married lady, who even excelled her husband in the art of adding field to field. She had induced both her first husband and her brother to leave her their estates, and after the death of Cavendish, to whom she had several children, she married first Sir William St. Loe, and then the Earl of Shrewsbury. She stipulated that St. Loe's estates—he had daughters by a former marriage— should in default of issue by her go to the Cavendishes. Her son she married to Shrewsbury's daughter, her daughter to Shrewsbury's son. These mercenary marriages, intrinsically more immoral than prostitution, were the making of the great house of Cavendish. " Bess's" second son became Earl of Devon¬ shire, and her grandson, the son of her third son, the Royalist Marquis of Newcastle, of Civil War fame. Till after the Restoration the Cavendishes were mere sequacious courtiers and matrimonial speculators. Then came a change over the spirit of their dream. They had lost immensely in purse in their unsuccessful efforts to uphold the Stuart tyranny. Newcastle, it is said, alone spent a million sterling in the Royalist cause, and they prudently determined not to do it again. They foresaw fresh troubles brewing, and they resolved to turn patriots. The fourth earl supported the claims of the Dutch Deliverer, and reaped his reward in a dukedom. It would be the height of credulity to suppose that any regard for the public good influenced his conduct. Since "the glorious Revolution," the Cavendishes have literally revelled in public appointments of all kinds,' though displaying very little capacity for public affairs. And they have not forgotten their old trick of profitably marrying and giving in marriage. The fourth duke married the only daughter of the Earl of Burlington—the heiress of the Cliffords and the Boyles—and thus contrived to add immensely to the patrimonial estates. The family motto, '•'Cavendo Tutus,"—" By Caution Safe"—is eminently appro¬ priate.</page><page sequence="87">BRIGHT EXAMPLES. 87 The Marquis of Harrington, the ablest, perhaps, of all his race, is yet an exceedingly "dull man." Still there is no saying at what he may arrive by sedulously taking care and rowing with the stream. The founder of the family was what has been called an " agrarian Protestant"—he promptly turned Catholic when Mary came to the throne—and it is not impossible that the noble lord may yet figure as a ducal Republican. " Anybody's dog for a bone," would be an excellent motto for some of our old aristocratic Whig houses. Let us next consider the case of the Russells. Like the Cavendishes, they owe their greatness to the favour of the Crown and the spoliation of the Church. " The political merit of the first pensioner of the house of Bedford," says Burke, " was that of being concerned as a councillor of state in advising, and in his person executing, the conditions of a dishonourable peace with France, by instigating a tyrant to injustice to provoke a people to rebellion by giving his hand to the work and partaking the spoil with a prince who plundered a part of the National Church of his time and country, by being a prompt and greedy instrument of a levelling tyrant who oppressed all descriptions of his people. His grants were from the aggregated and consolidated funds of judgments iniquitously legal, and from possessions volun¬ tarily surrendered by their lawful proprietors with the gibbet at the door. His merits were by acts in which he served his master and made his fortune, to bring poverty, wretchedness, and depopulation on his country." Such was the founder of the great house of Russell whose praises have been in the mouths of all manner of Liberal publicists for generations. John Russell was in truth one of the wiliest and most unscrupulous courtiers of his time. In 1540 he was little more than a needy adventurer, when there fell to his bow and spear twenty-five manors in Devonshire, being the whole circuit of the Abbey of Tavistock, In quick succession he fixed his talons on Dunkeswell, Devon, and Aston Abbots, Bucks. Later he laid hold of Hagh, Lincolnshire, and Castle Hymel, Northamptonshire. In the reign of the boy-king, Edward VI., Russell was a member of the Council, and he and the ring that composed it fraudulently produced a clause in Henry VIII.'s will ordering that certain alleged promises</page><page sequence="88">88 BRIGHT EXAMPLES. of the defunct Bluebeard to the Seymours, Russells, Wrio- theslys, and Company, should be made good forthwith.' Thus armed, Russell proceeded successively to lay hands on Woburn Abbey, Melchburn Priory, Beds, and Thornhaugh, Northamptonshire. Later he absorbed Long-acre and Covent-garden, the property of the monks of Westminster. Truly did Burke call this outrageous despoiler " the Leviathan of all the creatures of the Crown." In our own day another John Russell—" Wee Johnny " of reforming zeal—did his best to emulate the rapacity of the founder of the family. Mr. Grenville Murray thus truthfully summarized the results of his statesmanship :—" So the Reformers having conquered made Johnny Russell a Secretary of State, and by-and-Ly a Premier ; and Johnny, looking on the horny handed men who had laboured to hoist him so high, told them to rest and be thankful, while he parted all the spoils of victory among his kinsfolk and acquaintances. He forgot not a cousin or a nephew in this royal distribution, which was carried on, with but few intermissions, for six- and-thirty years. All the great plum-devouring connection was installed in every post where public moneys could be fingered. They became lords spiritual and temporal, com¬ manders of armies and fleets, governors of colonies, and ambassadors; they sucked the udders of the nation through every teat; nothing was done in Great Britain and her dependencies but by them and for them, so that it seemed in tiuth as if the greatest empire in the world had been created to no other end than to make them all fat. As for the thinkers and workers who had made the pulse of the nation beat at the name of Reform—the Tom Moores and Sydney Smiths, the Leigh Hunts and the Landors—they were left to suck their thumbs in the shadow." A fortunate marriage with the heiress of Wriothesly, another insatiable Church robber, brought into the Russell family the immense Bloomsbury and Hampshire estates. No wonder that the Russells were active in promoting the "glorious Revolution." James II. and his Romans would have had something to say to such an unparalleled crew of sacrilegious cormorants as the Russells had they had their way. Outside London the Russell domain consists of more than</page><page sequence="89">BRIGHT EXAMPLES. 89 eighty-six thousand acres—rent, £"142,000. Inside London yards are as valuable as acres outside, and the income is consequently perhaps nearly as great. The last penny is wrung from the people for ground-rents, and building leases are granted on the iniquitous principle that both the solum and that which has been erected on it revert entail to the lessor at the expiry of the term of occupation—ninety-nine years. A '• glorious Revolution " truly was that of 1688 for the Russells. Londoners are as badly off as Highland Crofters, if they had the wit to see it. Let us now, by way of change, take an example of a law- made house of hereditary rulers—the Scotts, of Eldon. John Scott, the founder of the Eldon family, was the son of a Newcastle coal merchant. He eloped with a banker's daughter, and betook himself to the bar. Being a perfect embodiment of self-seeking and political illiberality, he soon found his way into th^ House of Commons through the portal of the rotten borough of Weobly. He was an un¬ blushing " king's friend," and Pitt had to reward him with the office of Solicitor-General. Speedily he rose to be Attorney-General, and in that capacity his peculiar merits soon came to light. He was the most zealous prosecutor of political offenders who ever disgraced the English bar. For nine mortal hours he strained every nerve to induce a jury to convict Thomas Hardy, the secretary of the Corresponding Society, of treason. Hardy was an intelligent and patriotic shoemaker, and the coalman's son was shocked beyond measure that one of such humble station should venture to hold opinions on the questions of the day adverse to the Government. In this prosecution as well as in that of the celebrated Home Tooke, he failed ignominiously. At the trial of the latter, the unblushing professional hypocrite professed to weep because the defence had chal¬ lenged the purity of his motives. He could willingly part with life itself for the sake of his country; but the aspersion of his good name he could not endure. For why It was the little patrimony he had to leave to his children. There¬ upon Mitford, the Solicitor-General, thinking, that profes¬ sional etiquette required that he also should produce his handkerchief, began to sob. " What in the world is Mitford crying for ?" asked a bystander of Tooke. w" Ah," replied</page><page sequence="90">go BRIGHT EXAMPLES. the wit, " he is weeping to think what a slender patrimony Sir John Scott's children will have to divide among them." In several similar prosecutions against good men and true he was unfortunately more successful, and in 1801 he reaped the highest reward attainable—the Lord Chancel¬ lorship. In this great office he had ample opportunities of wrong¬ doing, and he exercised them most sedulously. He contrived to throw out the Slavery Abolition Bill; He obstinately insisted on hanging for thefts of 5s. and upwards. He successfully resisted Lord Holland's Parochial School Bill, and enthusiastically applauded the Peterloo massacre. He bitterly opposed Catholic Emancipation, the Repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts, the abolition of the Corn-laws, the Reform Bill, municipal reform, the introduction of railways—in a word, of every enlightened measure he was the implacable and relentless enemy. He loaded his son with sinecure offices, and himself so completely neglected the duties of his court that Joseph Hume declared " that the greatest curse that ever fell on any nation was having such a chancellor." In his lifetime he bought large estates in Durham and Dorset: notwithstanding, he was able to leave behind him half a million in hard cash. How he came by such a prodigious sum is not apparent. He was an accomplished liar, whose habit it was to complain of the losses he sustained in the discharge of his public duties. When Solicitor-General he told the king that the office had entailed on him a sacrifice of £"2,000 a- year. His fee-book showed that he was a gainer by £"1,000 at the least. As Lord Chancellor, with an income of £"17,000 per annum, he complained that his elevation had impov¬ erished him. His fee-book showed that his receipts as Attorney-General had not averaged more than £"10,000 a- year. Such was the founder of this family of hereditary rulers. John Scott of Eldon's career forcibly recalls one of the sights which the arch-enemy of mankind saw in " the Devil's Walk:"— " He saw a lawyer killing an adder On a dung-hill beside his stable ; And the Devil smiled, for it put him in mind Of Cain and his brother Abel."</page><page sequence="91">BRIGHT EXAMPLES. 91 Yet another specimen of the law-made noble Lord. Take the Dundases. The first of the Dundas gang with whom we need specially concern ourselves was made Lord Advocate for Scotland in 1775. In 1802 he was raised to the peerage as Lord Mel¬ ville. His father was Lord President of the Supreme Court of Scotland. The family fortunes had been made by one Sir Lawrence Dundas, a leviathan army contractor, a synonym in those days for great public robber. Lord Melville was the bosom friend of Pitt, who, if he was an honourable man, selected his confidants with an extra¬ ordinary disregard of their reputation. Fox said of Melville —and Fox was a most lenient critic—that he " ever showed an eagerness to heap up emoluments and to systematize cor¬ ruption." He generally held three or four offices at the same time. He was Privy Seal of Scotland and Steward of Fife- shire. When he received the latter appointment, he exacted " arrears " amounting to £"3,000. Of what the arrears con¬ sisted no one ever knew. For his wife he managed to secure a pension of £"1,500 per annum. The wherefore was neither family poverty nor public desert. Shameless greed alone prompted to this raid on the public purse. Melville's hatred of liberty in every form was, if possible, greater even than Eldon's. Both were alike steeped in cor¬ ruption, but Melville was the more audacious of the two. Indeed, he disregarded the third injunction of the Dantean precept, " Be bold, be bold, be not too bold," and came to grief, though by no means adequate grief. Being at the same time Minister of War, Treasurer of the Navy, and President of the Board of Control, he had unsurpassed opportunities for robbing the national till. How far he actually improved them it is impossible to say. His instrument and accomplice was one Alexander Trotter, a Navy-office clerk, who started with the munificent salary of £50 per annum. This fellow was ultimately promoted to be Dundas's deputy, and during their connection the frauds perpetrated on the nation were legion. Contrary to law, Trotter kept balances of public funds with Coutts, the banker, amounting to £"100,000 and upwards, and with these he did an enormous bill-discounting business. In 1802 his dividends from stock were over £"11,000, and when he came to be examined by the House of Lords he</page><page sequence="92">92 BRIGHT EXAMPLES. admitted that he was worth £"65,000. Trotter steadily re¬ fused, when under examination, to answer questions incrimi-J nating Melville; but it was proved that he had been in the habit of advancing to his chief, from time to time, sums of £"10,000 and even of £20,000. Some of these advances had been invested in stock in Melville's name. But the damning fact against Melville was this—Parliament appointed a Commission of Naval Inquiry, and the worthy couple took the alarm. They met, gave mutual releases, and burned accounts for public monies amounting to £"134,000,000! Do honest men who wish to be exonerated from charges dis¬ graceful to them hasten to destroy the very vouchers of their integrity At the bar of the House of Commons Melville made a defence which the philanthropic Wilberforce declared was " an aggravation of his guilt." He was compelled to resign all his public appointments, and his name was struck off the list of Privy Councillors. He was subsequently tried by the House of Lords on ten counts, and acquitted One crow does not pick out another crow's eyes. Fellow feeling makes us wondrous kind. No serious doubt has ever been raised as to Dundas's guilt. Miss Martineau held that it was " impossible that many, if any, should believe him actually innocent of the charges brought against him." Such, then, was the founder of the Dundas family. He was a miracle of tyranny and corruption, yet his widow was adjudged worthy of a pension of £"i,ooo per annum. His descendants and collaterals have quartered themselves on the public with unsurpassed effrontery. Nothing in Church or State has ever come wrong to a Dundas. There are two peerages in the family, that of Zetland being the more important. The earl has a rent-roll of £"49,000, with estates in Yorkshire, as well as in Fife, Dumbarton, Stirling, and Clackmannan. In Orkney and Shetland (Zet¬ land) he possesses 43,400 acres. This last domain was held by the inhabitants down to 1643, not feudally, but allodially —that is to say, every man was his own landlord, like the American homesteaders of the present day. The tenure was Norwegian, not British. The Zetland title is therefore one of confiscation—confiscation not finally confirmed till 1742. Happily, however, what parliament has done parliament can undo. - If -ever we do come to have a thoroughly Democratic</page><page sequence="93">BRIGHT EXAMPLES. '93 House of Commons there will be such an examination of title-deeds to estates as will give our Old Nobility serious ground for reflection. The Fitzroys, Dukes of Grafton, may be taken as a specimen of the peerages which owe their origin to royal debauchery. The first of this family was the son of Barbara Palmer, Duchess of Cleveland, by " the most religious King " Charles II., if Barbara was to be believed. But this infamous woman was so shamelessly vile that no re¬ liance whatever was to be placed on her word. Her husband, Lord Castlemaine, was well aware of her infidelities, and did not scruple to profit handsomely by them. Pepys relates how Charles and his brother James both paid court to her at the same time; while her young affections were bestowed impartially on " handsome Jack Churchill" and other courtiers, with an occasional actor thrown in by way of variety. But whether the first of the Graftons was a Fitzroy (King's son), or a Fitz-Churchill, or a Fitz-Actor, is of no great consequence. Charles was pleased to saddle the nation with the Grafton incubus of hereditary rulers, and that is the point to be considered. Barbara Palmer's son was splendidly provided for. The Earl of Arlington had an only daughter, to whom, at the age of twelve, Fitzroy was married. Charles heaped estates on Arlington, or rather, his son-in-law, Fitzroy, as Arlington's heir. The manors of Grafton, Hartwell, Alderton, Blisworth, Stoke- Bruerne, Green's Norton, Pollersbury, Ashton, and Paulers- bury; lands in Grimscolt, Northampton, Hardingston, Shuttle- hanger, Houghton Parva; parcel of Chacomb Priory and of Sewardsley Priory; the forests of Salcey and Whittlebury, and several other substantial gifts were the rewards of Barbara Palmer's easy virtue. Arlington was indefatigable in the acquisition of spoil in every shape. He formed one of the hated Cabal Ministry, and like his colleagues and royal master, he was in the pay of the French King. Through Arlington came the Suffolk estates of the Fitzroys. He was Secretary of State, Privy Purse, and Postmaster-General. Hence, he had always money for the purchase of fresh estates when no further accessions of Crown lands were to be secured. But not content with these enormous grants of land, the Duke of Grafton contrived to secure two hereditary pensions,</page><page sequence="94">94 BRIGHT EXAMPLES. one of £"9,000 a-year, charged on the Excise, and the other of £"4,700 on the Post-office. The former was commuted in 1855 for £"193,777, the latter in 1856 for £"91,181. These vast sums, produced by the sweat and tears of honest English toilers, were paid to the Duke of Grafton for no better reason than that their ancestor ' took the trouble to be born," and discreditably born too. " Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph." As hereditary rangers of Whittlebury Forest the malversa¬ tions of the Graftons have been most unblushing. In 1608 the forest contained 51,000 stately oaks, reserved by the Crown as suitable for navy construction. In 1783, when timber was sorely needed for this purpose, it was found that 5,200 trees alone remained. A Treasury warrant was issued to cut down a quantity of what remained. The deputy sur¬ veyor charged with this duty, unfortunately for himself, forgot to put the warrant in his pocket when he set about the work. He was pounced on by the hereditary ranger, who procured his dismissal from the service, and heartlessly accomplished his ruin. Was not this a touching example of ducal patriotism? The Graftons have 13,600 acres in Suffolk; 8,400 in North¬ ampton ; 7,300 in Bucks, and 2,700 in Banffshire—total 32,000 acres, with a rent-roll of £"34,000. Their motto is simply delicious : " The ornament and reward of virtue " The "reward," alas! is only too painfully real; but as for the " ornament"—great heavens the ornament! Where does it come in In one respect the aristocracy paint themselves in their true colours. The coats of arms on which they pride them¬ selves are hideously symbolic of their innate character. Wolves, tigers, panthers, lions; hawks, vultures, eagles; snakes, adders, vipers; swords, spears, daggers, arrows; griffins, ghouls, demons—everything horrible in nature and in the realm of imagination—grace the escutcheons of our " Old Nobility."</page><page sequence="95">95 CHAPTER IX. SUMMARY. " Undoubtedly we are drawing towards great changes. The time has arrived when it is becoming impossible for the aristocracy of England to wield the English nation any longer."—Matthew Arnold. ii "V X 7HAT then," asked Cromwell of Pym, " is the great VV root of all our grievances?" "The Aristocracy," said Pym, " Give us their true history and you unriddle the secret of every national embarrassment." Surely truer oracle than this was never uttered. For more than eight centuries of dishonour the story of our Old Nobility is one of all but uninterrupted and, alas generally successful crime. It divides itself naturally into four well marked epochs. First Epoch (1066—1485). In the first period covering the era of Norman and Plan- tagenet Royalty, our Old Nobility were simply a gang of merciless bandits who had unfortunately succeeded in garrott¬ ing the entire English people. M. Thierry truly describes the Conqueror's companions among whom he divided the fair soil of England, as " adventurers by profession, the idle, the dissipated, the profligate, the enfans perdus of Europe." " Normans, Burgolauns, thieves and felons," is the summing up of a contemporary Norman writer. Of the de Belesmes, the leading Anglo-Norman house, Mr. Freeman says they were " monsters of cruelty and perfidy—open robbery and treacherous assassination seem to have been their daily occu¬ pation." Delightful ancestors these to have!</page><page sequence="96">96 SUMMARY. In Stephen's reign they all but compassed the complete overthrow of the State. " Castles," says William of New¬ bury, " rose in great numbers, and there were in England, so to speak, as many kings or rather tyrants, as lords of castles." These robber strongholds " they filled with devils and evil men." Life in England became intolerable, and in the words of the Saxon Chronicle, " men said openly that Christ and the Saints had gone to sleep." One vigorous popular protest was made in the reign of Richard II. The serfs rose in arms under Wat Tyler. The nobles were panic-stricken and induced the boy-king to grant a Charter of Rights and a general pardon. Presently how¬ ever, they rallied, assassinated Tyler, tore up the Charter and hanged fifteen thousand of the duped peasantry! Asked by the King to give their consent to the emancipation of the serfs they replied: " Consent we will never give, were we all to die in one day!" But what of Magna Charta and the deathless heroes of Runnymede Was not the Great Charter their handiwork Not at all. A more preposterous claim was never preferred. The Charter was the achievement of the freemen of England in general and of the citizens of London in particular. In fact the part played by the Barons was pusillanimous in the last degree. True, they made a stand in order to save their ill- gotten estates from the grasp of John's mercenary captains, but it was a stand feeble indeed. John defied them in Northampton Castle, and in a fortnight's time they and their retainers had ignominiously to seek refuge within the walls of Bedford. In reality the Charter was wrung from John by a great national movement, supported by a Scottish army in the north—London alone put twenty thousand men under arms. The true motives of the Barons became apparent when John rescinded the Charter, and with an army of im¬ ported mercenaries sent them flying in every direction. What did they then do To save their estates they openly sold their country to France. Louis landed with a strong force, and after John's death it cost the English much hard fighting to dislodge him. Had the baronial patriots had their way, England would have been reduced to the position of a French province—a greater calamity even than the Nor¬ man Conquest. True patriots these barons bold</page><page sequence="97">SUMMARY. 97 During the reign of the Conqueror and his immediate successors our Old Nobility, it is calculated, cut off by famine and the sword one-third of the English race Eventually, in the faction fights of the Red and White Roses, they all but exterminated each other. Unhappily they did not perish alone. In the laudable work of self-destruction they con¬ trived to immolate more than a hundred thousand English¬ men who had not the least interest in their wicked quarrels. Second Epoch (1485— 1688). In the Second Epoch, embracing the times of the Tudors and Stuarts, there grew up an entirely new order of noble fungi—parchment-made peers—base crawling courtiers, per¬ fect prodigies of avarice, cowardice, servility, lying, forgery, plotting and all the meaner and meanest human vices. Henry VII. and Henry VIII. sent them to the block by the score for any reason or none. The " Virgin Queen " thought nothing of boxing the ears of a great nobleman, or even of spitting in his face. The craven Duke of Norfolk with " the blood of all the Howards " in his veins, was a party to the execution of both his nieces, Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard, and congratulated the Royal Bluebeard on throwing his " ungracious mother-in-law, his unhappy brother and wife, and his lewd sister of Bridgewater," into the Tower. He and his fellow peers showed their respect for public liberty by decreeing that royal proclamations should have the force of law 1 This was the hey-day of the notorious Church robbers— the Russells, the Cavendishes, Cecils and Co. The immense Monastery Lands were the mainstay of the poor. Deprived of these, they were reduced to vagrancy by thousands. To repress mendicancy the despoilers by statute visited their victims with branding, slavery, and death. In Henry the Eighth's reign seventy-two thousand lord-made beggars were hanged out of hand. Elizabeth was content with hanging a modest three or four hundred per annum. The " Virgin Queen's " ministers—the Cecils, father and son—(from whom Lord Salisbury claims descent)—literally governed England by—tlie rack. Even Lord Clarendon, the Tory historian, could hardly tolerate the younger Cecil. " No act of power," he writes, " was ever proposed which he did not advance and</page><page sequence="98">98 SUMMARY. execute with the utmost rigour. No man so great a tyrant in this country." When the boy Edward VI., came to the throne the ring of upstart courtiers that got hold of him forged a clause in his father's will decreeing themselves im¬ mense estates and extraordinary titles. One fellow, Seymour, called himself Duke of Somerset by the grace of God! To save their estates they all punctually changed their religion with every change of government. In James the First's reign peerages were sold at the rate of £"10,000 each, rich men being occasionally compelled to become hereditary legislators against their will. When the storm-clouds of revolution finally burst about the head of Charles Stuart, the Peers showed scarcely a trace of capacity, civil or military. If they had helped the Commons to curb the royal prerogative not a drop of blood need have been shed. But they did not. In the hour of danger most of them slunk like rats into holes, whence they only emerged at the Restoration. But if they had none of the instincts of the lion, they had certainly some of those of the hyaena. They tore up and exposed to obloquy the dead bodies of Cromwell, Ireton, Bradshaw, Pym, Admiral Blake, and even those of Cromwell's mother and daughter Noblesse oblige! At this time land yielded the State nearly half its revenue. Of this most just obligation the nobles relieved themselves at a blow in 1660 by substituting Customs and Excise duties for the Land Tax. They subsequently undertook to pay 4s. in the pound on true annual rental, but they have since fraudulently kept to the original valuation of 1692, with the result that they are now paying one million per annum when they should be paying forty. Mr. W. A. Hunter, than whom there is no better authority, has calculated that whereas forty working men with aggregate wages amounting to £"2,000 (£5° a year for each) contribute £"12 to the revenue out of every £"100 of their wages, one man—an absolute non-pro¬ ducer, perchance—with an income of £"2,000 contributes but £"3 out of every £"100 of income. So much for the effects of the notorious Land Tax Swindle which has already caused the loss of £"1,250,000,000 of state revenue. Third Epoch (1688—1832). The third period of aristocracy extends from the " Glorious</page><page sequence="99">SUMMARY. 99 Revolution " to the first Reform Bill. This was the halcyon era of noble lords, of Continental Wars, Standing Armies, National Debts, and Pensions. They now wielded the pre¬ rogatives of Royalty, and usurped the functions of the Com¬ mons. In Dutch William's time they robbed the Crown of nearly all its vast estates, and made it a pauper on the bounty of the People by the invention of the Civil List. There being in the Georgian era but some 15,000 electors in a population of 30,000,000 they were able by unblushing corruption to take complete possession of the Representative Chamber. Nearly five-sixths of the members were their direct or indirect nominees. Their diabolical toast and watchword during this miserable period was, " A long war and a short crop !" Both tended to raise rents. They fought everywhere—in Europe, in Asia, in America—and always against Liberty. Every European despot, great and small, from the Autocrat of Russia to the Landgrave of Hesse Cassel, was subsidised with British gold in the vain attempt to restore the Bourbons, and to undo the beneficent work of the French Revolution. A subsidy of £"2,400,000 enabled Prussia to partition Poland. America was lost, to say nothing of the sacrifice of nearly two millions of precious English lives. Since 1688 we have paid in interest on lord-begotten war debt £2,790,000,000, and in reduction of the same £"3,430,000,000, while £"750,000,000 remain to pay Strict economists these noble lords in handling other people's money Fourth Epoch (1832—1884). The fourth epoch of aristocracy extends from the Reform Bill to the present day. " Since the Reform Act," says the discriminating Bagehot, " the House of Lords has ceased to be one of latent directors, and has become one of temporary rejectors and palpable alterers." Of this truth the following imperfect epitome of their recent achievements is sufficiently convincing evidence:— 1832—Refuse to open Universities to Dissenters. 1834—Refuse to allow more than 20 persons to meet for worship in a private house. 1834—Refuse to allow Nonconformist Ministers access to Workhouses. 1835—Population of Ireland 8 millions—voters 60,000 Lords refuse reform. Prevented for 40 years after. H 2</page><page sequence="100">IOO SUMMARY. 1836—Lords try to defeat Municipal Reform Act. Choice of Magistrates denied to Town Councils. So ever since. 1836—Order Dissenters' Marriage Banns to be read before Board of Guardians. 1839—Continue death penalty for sheep stealing against the will of the Commons. 1842—Mines' Regulation. Lords refuse to give women and children working in mines the full relief of Commons' Bill. Protection of miners against pre¬ ventable accidents not obtained for 30 years through Lords. 1845—Compensation for Tenants' Improvements (Ire¬ land) refused, and so for 25 years. 1858—Church Rates Abolition refused. Put off 11 years. i860—Mr. Gladstone takes Taxes (£"660,000) off Paper. This meant a Cheap Press. Lords throw out the Bill. i860—Refuse Education to Miners' Children. 12 years of darkness follow. 1867—Lords rob electors of city of London, Glasgow, Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham, &amp;c, of the third vote. 1868—-Throw out the Irish Church Disestablishment Resolutions. 1868—Emasculate Artisans' Dwellings Bill. 1867-70—University Tests Abolition thrice refused. 1870—Irish Land Act. Lords refuse Compensation, and insist on their right to evict distressed tenants. 1871—Ballot Bill thrown out. 1873-6—Refuse to amend Burial Laws. 1880—Reject Compensation for Disturbance Bill (Ire¬ land). Ireland given up to anarchy and crime in consequence. Civil war at a " measurable distance." 1883—Throw out Marriage Law Amendment Bill. 1883—Lord Salisbury spoils English Agricultural Hold¬ ings Bill—but retreats. 1884—Refuse the Franchise to 2,000,000 County House¬ holders What then, in brief, is the case against the Peers In the first epoch of their career they robbed the People ; in the</page><page sequence="101">SUMMARY. 101 second they robbed the Church; in the third they robbed the Crown ; in the fourth, as always, they have been the steady foes of suffrage reform, of Nonconformists, of Roman Catholics, of Ireland, of Agriculture, of Trade, of Education. " The Peers," says Lord Rosebery, " have no friends." This news is too good to be true ; but it is strange indeed that they should have any. All good legislation they retard, all bad legislation they expedite. Whatever progress we have made has been made in spite of them. They represent political privilege and social injustice. The Peers alone possess nearly a fifth of the whole soil of the country, for the restricted use of which they levy on the cultivators a private tax called rent of nearly twelve millions per annum. Not content with this, our Dukes, Marquises, Earls, and their relatives have within the last thirty-three years looted the Exchequer of more than sixty-six million sterling in salaries and pensions. Noble lords divide among them annually in the shape of annuities, pensions, salaries, &amp;c, £"639,865! They are a House of Landlords, and until they are abolished root and branch no solution of the great Land Question is to be dreamed of. They are the veriest octopuses of civilisation. Every State that has tolerated an aristocracy has eventually been ruined by it—witness Greece, Rome, Carthage, Venice, Spain, Austria. Latifundia perdidere Italian immo et provincias. And when the Hereditary House is abolished, the demand which will be made by reactionaries for a Representative Second Chamber must be sternly resisted. True, most nations have Second Chambers in imitation of our pernicious example ; but there is not one of them, however constituted, whose history is not a conclusive argument against such institutions. The Second Chambers of Europe and America are nothing more than standing monuments of the gregarious folly of mankind. Nations can no more have two wills than individuals. A Second Chamber at one with the First is superfluous; in opposition it is noxious. Lord Salisbury wishes to import here the American Senate (the last strong¬ hold of the slaveholders) at a moment when that body stands condemned by the ablest political thinkers in the Republic as a filthy rag of aristocracy. No, no, my Lord of Hatfield, you cannot be permitted thus recklessly to " Americanise our</page><page sequence="102">102 SUMMARY. our institutions." The fiat has gone forth—Delenda est Car¬ thago. Clear the way, my lords and lackeys i You have had your day Here you have your answer—England's yea against your nay.

Recently the question of the hour was the enfranchisement of " Two Millions of Capable Citizens." NOW it is the dis¬ franchisement of Five Hundred Irresponsible Hereditary Legislators. To effect this object, it has been determined to form a National League, which all patriotic citizens are earnestly invited to join. The reasons for this step hardly require enumeration. They are obvious to every reflecting mind—known to every student of history. In ante-Norman times, the Witan or National Council was essentially democratic. In the years following the Conquest it was rendered first oligarchic and then hereditary. The means used were force and fraud. Our House of Lords, the survival of a barbarous feudalism, is the offspring of that force and that fraud. We owe the absurd principle of heredity in legislation—as might have been expected—not to statute, but to the lawyers. In the fourteenth century they made the astonishing dis¬ covery that, if the Crown once summoned a man to the National Councils, it must go on summoning his represent¬ atives, be they fools or knaves, down to the latest generation The results have been such as might readily have been expected. By substituting the idea of birth for that of merit, the whole stream of social life has been poisoned at its source. Instead of producing freemen and public-spirited citizens, the tendency has been to breed flunkeys.</page><page sequence="104">And the political evils flowing from the hereditary principle are not less serious. When there is a Tory majority in the Commons, the Lords simply register the decrees of that majority. When there is a Liberal majority in the Commons, the Lords habitually veto whatever useful measures they dare, and mangle beyond identification such as they dare not wholly reject. Oftener than once within the century has Obstruction by Privilege brought the country to the Brink of a Bloody Revolution. In no Free State can a Hereditary Legislative Chamber be a permanent institution. We do not now raise the wider question of the utility of Second Chambers in general, though the gravest doubts have been started on that head. But we do emphatically affirm—and we trust we shall have many intelligent adherents—what the Long Parliament expressed with such decisive brevity—viz., " That a House of Peers in Parliament is useless and dangerous, and ought to be abolished."

To the Honourable the Commons of Great Britain and Ireland in Parliament assembled. The Petition of humbly sheweth :— i st. That there is in Parliament a House of irresponsible lawmakers generally known as " Peers ; " 2nd. That the members of the said House are mostly here¬ ditary, succeeding each other by reason of pedigree, or mere animal succession ; 3rd. That such qualification for the serious business of legislation renders Englishmen ridiculous in the eyes of rational persons all over the world ; 4th. That the said anomalous House has for centuries grievously oppressed the People of these Islands by the framing of bad laws, and the rejection or mutilation of such as have been of the clearest public utility; 5th. That, during the happy period of the Commonwealth, your Honourable House wisely passed an Act abolishing hereditary legislators as " useless and dangerous," and that the Nation in consequence reaped the greatest moral and material advantages at home and abroad. May it therefore please your Honourable House forth¬ with to revive said Statute of Abolition, permitting such Peers as the People in their wisdom may duly elect to serve them in Parliament to take their seats in your Honourable House. And your Petitioners will ever pray, &amp;c. (Signed,) [Drawn up by the Author.,]</page></plain_text>
