<plain_text><page sequence="1">Frank Palmeri Conjectural History and Satire: Narrative as Historical Argument from Mandeville to Malthus (and Foucault) I. CONJECTURAL HISTORY AND SATIRE In Book Three of the Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith attempts to explain the mechanism by which feudal economic and social relations in Europe came to be transformed into relations typical of and dependent on capital markets. The feudal forms were characterized by the power of large landowners, who supported hun dreds of retainers. However, Smith argues, with the gradual appearance of luxury goods, the great proprietors chose to adorn themselves rather than to support their re tainers: "For a pair of diamond buckles perhaps, or for something as frivolous and useless, they exchanged ... the price of the maintenance of a thousand men for a year, and with it the whole weight and authority which it could give them" (418-19). With their retainers dismissed, and their tenants becoming more independent, the large landholders bargained away their power, "not like Esau in time of hunger and necessity, but in wantonness of plenty, for trinkets and baubles fitter to be the play things of children than the serious pursuits of men" (421). Smith does not cite docu mentary or other sources to support his argument here, nor does he offer quantitative evidence or calculations. Instead, he provides a plausible hypothetical narrative to bridge the gap between earlier and later stages of society. His account is consistent with known or accepted facts and with an understanding of psychology ("all for our selves, and nothing for other people, seems, in every age of the world, to have been the vile maxim of the masters of mankind" [418]). But the narrative is also sharply Frank Palmeri is Professor of English at the University of Miami, the author of Satire in Narrative (1990) and Satire, History, Novel: Narrative Forms, 1665-1815 (2003), and editor of Humans and Other Animals in Eighteenth-Century England (2006). He is currently working on the afterlife of Enlightenment conjectural history in early anthropology and psychoanalysis, as well as writing a volume on the eclipse and reemergence of satire in the long nineteenth century.

Far from being unique or unusual, the combination of specula tive history and satire in this passage is exemplary of a frequent convergence of these genres of narrative in the eighteenth century. In this passage and in others, Smith constructs a speculative narrative in order to explain the passage from one stage of society to another, as did the other eighteenth century historians whose works will be considered here. The literary form most closely related to their narrative plots?satire?is often associated with the local and political and not with large-scale historical explanations. Part of the significance of the story of conjectural history in the eighteenth century, then, arises from its dis tinctive interweaving of fictional and historical modes. But perhaps most impor tantly, in both the fictional and the non-fictional modes, conjectural history demonstrates the indispensable role of narrative in providing answers to questions about the nature of human society and the identity of human beings. The narrative explanations provided by conjectural history constitute the bridge between sacred texts such as the book of Genesis and the modern discipline of cultural anthropology. When Enlightenment thinkers sought to work out a naturalistic narrative of the course of human societies, they had to develop a form of a universal history that would avoid having recourse to providence for its explanations. Outside the bible and religious traditions, however, the available evidence was limited, uncertain, and fragmentary, consisting primarily of the writings of travelers, merchants, and mis sionaries over the preceding two centuries of European exploration and expansion.1 To give an account of the earliest stages of human social life, and to fill in gaps or transitions between eras already represented in the historical record, they fashioned the genre of conjectural history, attempting to construct psychologically plausible narratives of what could or must have happened in order for human beings to have developed the use of articulate language, or to have brought into existence the insti tutions of religion and government. Dugald Stewart called these works "Theoretical or Conjectural" (34) histories because they offered hypotheses that would be in ac cord with and help explain the historical record, just as a history of physics or math ematics offers hypotheses that seek to be in accord with and help explain observable phenomena in the natural world. Such narratives were sometimes carried forward so that they overlapped with classical, medieval, or modern history, or even, on occa sion, anticipated future developments (as in Condorcet and Kant). Turning away not only from providential history set in a biblical framework, but also from political and antiquarian history, which remained national or local in their focus, conjectural his tory was universal and stadialist: it envisioned human societies progressing through the same stages of development. In most cases, as in the formulations of Adam Smith and Adam Ferguson, these were based on modes of subsistence and of correspond ing social organization, beginning with hunter-gatherers, then proceeding gradually through pastoralists or shepherds, to agriculturalists, and finally to men whose social relations are determined by their commercial ties. This essay argues that eighteenth-century conjectural histories consistently em ploy the two principal features of narrative satire: its leveling of vertical relations,</page><page sequence="3">66 Frank Palmeri and its unresolved juxtaposition of conflicting perspectives. Such satire, I have ar gued, brings the different levels in traditional hierarchies of value to the same plane, replacing traditionally established claims of spiritual and cultural authority with na turalistic or materialistic explanations.2 The conjectural histories almost by definition demystify or depart from previously authoritative historical understandings. A narra tive of the pre-history of human institutions that ignored, modified, or presented an alternative to the account in Genesis necessarily carried a critical and satiric implica tion, whether it traced the origins of language or recounted uninterrupted human progress without a fall. The effect was unavoidably and even more pointedly satiric when conjectural historians such as Hume and Mandeville took as their primary sub ject the origins and early history of religion itself. Many of the conjectural histories discussed here overturn the traditional Christian account of the establishment of human society by representing it as the result of a conspiracy. The agents behind the historical plots vary in such natural histories: sometimes they are politicians (as in Mandeville) or the rich (as in Rousseau); in several cases, the schemers are priests who first consolidate their power through the access they claim to the divinity (Hume, Diderot, Condorcet). One conjectural history satirizes anti-clerical d?mysti fications themselves (Burke), and the final one satirizes the Utopian vision of another (Malthus on Condorcet). In addition to levelling spiritual with naturalistic claims of authority, conjec tural histories make use of satiric form by distancing themselves from both sides of a philosophical or ideological conflict without articulating a normative middle ground. Narrative satire parodies or criticizes first one extreme in a cultural opposi tion, then turns to criticize or undercut its opposite, which may have been implicitly sanctioned before, leaving unspecified any mediating or third alternative. If tragedy leads toward the death of a character embodying one side of such a pair of opposing values, and comedy to a reconciliation of conflicting social groups or cultural terms, narrative satire rather produces an open-ended continuation of a fundamental anta gonism.3 These opposed values may vary from one narrative satire or from one con jectural history to another: such pairs include virtuous poverty and prosperous vice in Mandeville; polytheism and monotheism in Hume; or ancient Roman and modern French culture versus ancient Greek and modern German culture in Herder. Verse satire tends to be more one-sided and sermonizing as it typically satirizes only an emerging cultural framework as a falling off, rather than criticizing both an estab lished and an emerging regime of values. The two kinds of satire share a tendency to produce narrative stasis or at least an interruption of the forward progress of a larger narrative in which they play a part. Narrative satire leaves the most vital issues unre solved, suspended between opposed cultural or ideological alternatives; verse satire produces a sermon-like list of attacks or complaints. Neither works to move narrative to a state that differs substantially from its initial condition. A persistent tension therefore characterizes the relation between conjectural histories that attempt to nar rate in a brief compass the crucial steps leading from animal existence to civilized life, and the satiric forms of which they make use to distance themselves from tradi tional and established stories of human origins.</page><page sequence="4">Conjectural History and Satire 67 II. CONJECTURAL SATIRE FROM MANDEVILLE TO DIDEROT Bernard Mandeville's Fable of the Bees: or Private Vices, Publick Benefits, Part 1?including the poetic fable, "The Grumbling Hive," the many Remarks or notes on the poem, and the "Enquiry into the Origin of Moral Virtue"?was first published in 1714, then expanded in 1723 and 1724. Part 2 of the Fable, a philosophical dialogue on most of the same issues, was published in 1729. Conjectural history of the earli est institutions of human society is more prominent and extensive in Part 2, taking up most of the fifth and sixth dialogues, about a third of the whole. However, the argu ments of Mandeville's spokesman Cleomenes in the second part do not contradict but rather develop, clarify, and somewhat modify arguments that Mandeville had al ready advanced in the first part. In the "Enquiry" at the beginning of the first part, Mandeville asserts that human beings were first shaped to accept the restraints re quired by social life by means of flattery and manipulation. People learned to control or even deny their instincts in order to have their pride satisfied, to be praised as ra tional, self-sacrificing, and hard-working creatures by those who aimed to civilize them. The more powerful and cunning, meanwhile, were free to pursue their ap petites and pleasures as long as they did so circumspectly and under the pretense of seeking the common good. "This was (or at least might have been) the manner after which Savage Man was broke; from whence it is evident, that the first Rudiments of Morality, broach'd by skilful Politicians, to render Men useful to each other as well as tractable, were chiefly contrived that the Ambitious might reap the more Benefit from, and govern vast Numbers of them with the greater Ease and Security" (1, 46-47). By including the parenthetical phrase, Mandeville acknowledges the con jectural nature of his argument, which is unavoidable given the absence of any docu ments or remains from the earliest times. Like most conjectural historians, Mandeville specifies that the process he describes applies only to non-Jewish and non-Christian peoples, but this is a formal concession only, and the Fable implicitly means not to supplement but to supplant the account of human origins in Genesis. The alternate narrative here describes the civilizing process as a disciplinary taming, a breaking in to the yoke of society, which is carried out by "Politicians" using ma nipulation and trickery. Their success depends on the vanity, gullibility, and self-de ception of most human beings. This account of the origins of society and virtue satirically inverts the orthodox Christian account of human beings as potentially rational agents granted a direct revelation by the divinity of what is eternally right and true. The Fable of the Bees reveals its functioning as narrative satire also through the construction and course of its argument, which adopts opposed positions but leaves no normative middle ground for its readers.4 Mandeville typically demonstrates the beneficial effects of some form of behavior that has been condemned by severe moral systems, whether Christian or Stoic, but he does not move on to condone the behavior in question or to alter his characterization of it as a moral offense.5 The re sult is a simultaneous embrace of opposites, a paradox or oxymoron. For example, Mandeville shows that prodigality produces the beneficial result of circulating riches</page><page sequence="5">68 Frank Palmeri and making available to merchants, shopkeepers, workers, and servants profits or wages that they would otherwise not have had, but despite these benefits, he does not cease to characterize prodigality as a vice. The result is that he seriously celebrates the consequences of behavior whose morality he deplores (usually ironically), as in the phrase characterizing prodigality as "That Noble Sin" (1, 102). He makes the structure of his thought and feeling clear in Remark K: "Abundance of moderate Men I know that are Enemies to Extremes, will tell me, that Frugality might happily supply the Place of the two Vices I speak of [avarice and prodigality]. . . . Whoever argues thus shews himself a better Man than he is a Politician. Frugality is like Hon esty, a mean starving Virtue, that is only fit for small Societies of good peaceable Men" (1, 103). The tone here indicates the author's contempt for moderation in gen eral and for the middle ground of frugality in particular; nevertheless, he does not ex plicitly recommend prodigality but continues to call it a sin, accepting the framework of the strict moralists. As a result, the reader has no ground on which to stand that is between or apart from the contradictory judgments (one moral, the other political) that Mandeville yokes together. In the second part, Mandeville expands and refines his conjectural narrative. Without withdrawing any of the ironic paradoxes that characterized the first part, he moderates his expressions, alters his emphases, and gives a much more detailed ac count of the earliest stages of social life. He explains that there may not have been identifiable individual legislators or managers of mankind to begin with, and that the process of socialization must not have been a sudden and comprehensive, but a gra dual and imperfect one that occurred over many generations. In this more extensive account, Mandeville argues that fear motivated the first two steps human beings took toward the formation of society. First came fear of natural phenomena, including thunder and lightning, but particularly of wild animals. Such fear first produced reli gious beliefs (2, 207-14), as well as priests who managed such anxieties and claimed the ability to mollify the divine powers in animals or natural phenomena.6 Fear of other men may have appeared at approximately the same time (2, 230-31). Mande ville argues that only such fears for their survival could have made social animals of creatures as appetitive, cunning, and determined as human beings are. After these first two steps, the development of articulate language must have given a significant impetus and a powerful tool to socialization, although here especially Mandeville sees the process moving slowly and haltingly (2, 287-95). After the emergence of language came the safeguarding of property, division of labor, development of me tallurgy, and establishment of laws and government. Mandeville thus writes the first extended conjectural history in the form of a philosophical dialogue, but it remains strongly satiric as it traces the origins of society to the exploitation of fear by priests and politicians. Twenty years after the second part of the Fable of the Bees, Rousseau's Dis course on the Sciences and Arts (1750) presents both a sharply satiric jeremiad di rected at modern European culture and a sketch of a distinctive conjectural history of human society. In earlier, rudimentary stages of society, Rousseau maintains, before they developed artificial pretenses, people could see through each other more easily, but in modern society one never knows with whom one is dealing. As a result, in a</page><page sequence="6">Conjectural History and Satire 69 list of vices typical of verse satire, he says we can observe "no more sincere friend ships; no more real esteem; no more well-based confidence, [but instead] suspicions, offenses, fears, coldness, reserve, hate, betrayal" (38; OC 3, 8).7 In addition, Rousseau often casts his claim that advances in learning have led to or indicate a de cline in morals in paradoxical form as a conjunction of opposed but related develop ments. Thus, Rousseau maintains that even in their origins, the sciences reveal their connection to human vices: "Astronomy was born from superstition; eloquence from ambition, hate, flattery, and falsehood; geometry from avarice; physics from vain cu riosity; all, even moral philosophy, from human pride" (48; OC 3, 17). The sciences and learning in general, therefore, do not raise mankind above the level of the ani mals, but instead constitute means of satisfying human weakness and vice. Above all, civilization constrains human beings and disguises that constraint: the arts and sciences "spread garlands of flowers over the iron chains" that weigh men down in society (36; OC 3, 7). In both this first Discourse and in the Discourse on the Origins of Inequality (1755) Rousseau incorporates criticisms of culture characteristic of verse satire into a narrative framework recounting a conjectural history. In the methodological intro duction to the later work, Rousseau suggests setting to one side "the facts," that is, the traditional religious account based on the bible, and instead offers his "hypothe tical and conditional reasonings" (103; OC 3, 132).8 Part One of the Discourse avoids narrative to draw a portrait of the human animal before society; Part Two offers a conjectural narrative of the steps that could or must have led that human animal to found society. After personal property was established, and agriculture, metallurgy, and an early division of labor separated men into rich and poor, the rich man, seeing that his interests lay in protecting his property, conceived "the most cunning project that ever entered the human mind": "Let us unite," he said, "to protect the weak from oppression, to restrain the ambitious, and secure for everyone the possession of what belongs to him. Let us institute regulations of justice and peace to which all are obliged to conform"; in an echo of the First Discourse, Rousseau imagines that all who listened to him "ran to meet their chains thinking they secured their freedom" (159; OC 3, 177). Under the guise of providing equal treatment for everyone, this false contract secures the property of those with possessions while granting the prop erty-less nothing.9 It constitutes a parody and satire of the social contracts envisioned by Hobbes, Locke, and other philosophers in the natural law tradition who specu lated on the transition from a state of nature to a social state. Despite their substantial differences, Hobbes and Locke both believed that the social contract increased the security and peace of those who entered into it, as well as making available access to the new institutions of the law. For Rousseau, on the other hand, the law was estab lished by cunning manipulators under the guise of offering equal protection to all, al though in fact it exists only to protect the rich from the poor. Rousseau thus satirically demystifies both Locke's emphasis on the protection of property as the le gitimate foundation of society, and Hobbes's assertion that his contract must have been the only way to bring an end to the war of each against all. To the contrary, Rousseau asserts, the debased contract initiated by the rich leads to greater oppres sion and violence by means of government and laws until an extreme is reached in a</page><page sequence="7">70 Frank Palmeri state where all are equal because they are as nothing compared to the will of their despotic master (177; OC 3, 191). His close attention to the life of the human animal and the steps by which he may have become civilized provide for a satiric correction of his predecessors' philosophical discourse by means of detailed narrative.10 In an even clearer and more striking use of satiric form, Rousseau interpolates formal verse satire into his narrative in the Second Discourse. The long ninth note, for example, takes the form of a Juvenalian satire on civilized life. When he consi ders Maupertuis's question whether there is more good or evil in human life, Rousseau argues that if one is talking about life in society, then the evils, constraints, inconveniences, and sufferings far outweigh the benefits and gains. In this note, Rousseau concentrates on the distinctive enterprises and technologies of human be ings, the "mountains razed, rocks broken, rivers made navigable, land cleared, lakes dug out, swamps drained, enormous buildings raised upon the earth, the sea covered with ships" (193; OC 3, 202). All these efforts at improvement, however, lead not to greater happiness but to greater sufferings. Rousseau challenges us to calculate how many men are swallowed by the sea each year, how many die of unhealthy trades such as the mining and smelting of metals. Moreover, from increased trade come greater commerce, comfort, riches, and luxury, which entail the corrupting and weakening of the human frame. The growth of population following from trade also leads to wars in which the pursuit of profits by suppliers and medical providers cause even more deaths than do the enemy's forces.11 In the pattern that Rousseau observes here and throughout the Second Discourse, man's improvement, his technological progress itself, brings greater suffering and death than humans in a state of nature had experienced (192-203; OC 3, 202-8). This pattern agrees with and in fact re peats points made by Juvenal in his satires, especially Satire 3, where an old Roman catalogues the reasons that prompt him to flee Rome: the most civilized, powerful, and advanced city in the world turns out also to be the most inconvenient, insecure, unhealthy, and morally corrupt.12 Rousseau concludes the ninth note by asserting that modern society always pro duces "more real calamities than apparent advantages" (203; OC 3, 208). This for mulation makes clear the satiric and paradoxical point of the Second Discourse: every improvement in social life is also a regression, which is always either more significant or more real than the progress. For example, Rousseau says that after the first step toward social life which separated humans from animals, and which consti tuted the "true youth" of the species, "all subsequent progress has been in appear ance so many steps toward the perfection of the individual, and in fact towards the decrepitude of the species" (151; OC 3, 171). This sentence constructs yet again a paradoxical and satiric union of opposites that leaves no normative middle ground for the reader to occupy. Apparent improvement repeatedly constitutes real decline. We can note one further version of such an absence of mediating terms in this con jectural genealogy of modernity. Rousseau's vision leaves us suspended between the corrupt, modern, authoritarian states and simple, ancient democratic states such as Sparta or the Roman Republic, which are, however, now entirely unavailable. In the Social Contract, Rousseau attempts to point the way to the establishment of a legiti mate political authority and to specify the method of its functioning; most readers,</page><page sequence="8">Conjectural History and Satire 11 however, regard the project of establishing a legitimate contract and a direct demo cratic expression of a general will as Utopian and no more available in the modern world than are the institutions of the ancients. Since utopia is the complementary other side of satire, it makes sense that the satiric conjectural history in the Dis courses should be followed by the Utopian vision of the Social Contract, and that we should remain without a middle ground between the unavoidable despotism of the one and the unavailable democracy of the other. In Rousseau's discourses, the object of the satiric critique is the corrupting ef fect of inequalities of property and power. The origin and progress of religious feel ings return to be the focus of Hume's Natural History of Religion (1757) and Dialogues concerning Natural Religion (written, c. 1751, pub., 1779). Although the Dialogues do not constitute a conjectural history, they provide a clear analogue for the workings of Hume's satire of religion in the Natural History. In the Dialogues, Hume sets against each other a severe fideist and an optimistic deist. The first, Demea, argues that belief is based not on reason but on revelation, and that the divine intelligence does not resemble the human. The deist, Cleanthes, on the other hand, maintains that the ordered and harmonious design of the world enables us to infer an anthropomorphic creator. Philo, the skeptic, gives no evidence of deep belief like Demea's, but he directs almost all of his attack against Cleanthes' argument from de sign. By the conclusion of the Dialogues, both traditional faith and its seeming op posite, the deistic argument from design, have been discredited, and the reader is left with no ground on which to establish religious belief. In the Natural History, a conjectural account of the psychology and sociology of religion proceeds along a similar track to the same result. For Hume, as for Man deville, the origin of human speculations about the invisible and the unknown is fear. However, rather than asserting a conspiracy by politicians or priests, Hume focuses on the psychology of belief to construct a narrative of its beginnings and develop mental stages. His Natural History takes the form of a clinical report, a case history of a nearly universal human pathology. He emphasizes gloomy anxieties and terrors in the beginnings of religion (rather than a desire to celebrate or give thanks), main taining that people are "offener thrown on their knees by the melancholy than by the agreeable passions" (Ch. 3). Thinking back, like Rousseau, to what the mental world of the early humans must have been like, he infers that religious notions did not first arise in response to feelings of wonder at the beauty and harmony of the universe: far from extending to such exalted conceptions, the intelligence of early humans was bounded by concern for personal safety and survival. Hume's analysis of polytheism goes on to satirize a system of belief in which innumerable divinities associated with every stream and stone, as well as every area of human life, have greater power than humans, but otherwise exhibit the pettiest human emotions, including jealousy, anger, revenge, and a thirst for praise. Hume argues that theism grows naturally out of polytheism, from the desire to exalt one's local god or the ruling divinity of a nation (Ch. 6), and he discerns a con tinuity more than a break between these two main forms of religious belief. More over, when he considers the nature and social implications of theism, the result is a paradoxical reversal: what we expect to be a progress turns out to be regress.</page><page sequence="9">72 Frank Palmeri Comparing polytheism with monotheism on point after point, he finds that social benefits follow from the earlier and apparently less rational polytheistic form of be lief. Because theism claims to possess the sole truth, it is more intolerant and perse cuting (Ch. 9); for the same reason, theism suffocates philosophy and the life of the mind generally. By contrast, a polytheistic society does not grant religion access to a truth superior to all forms of rational inquiry (Ch.ll). Regarding life in another world as all-important, theistic belief withdraws people's minds and efforts from this world, producing dangerous zealots or self-absorbed monks; polytheistic belief tends to produce civic-minded, courageous citizens, more willing to fight the sources of suffering or injustice in order to improve conditions of life in this world (Ch. 10). Thus, after satirizing polytheistic systems in his first few chapters for being silly, inconsistent, allegorizing projections of human traits onto natural forces, in his later chapters Hume satirically criticizes the opposite, theistic form of religion for producing more pernicious results in social and intellectual life; although they are not the cunning, priestly politicians that Mandeville described, the asocial saints and monks that figure in Hume's account of theism are also associated with a taming and a diminution of human energies. In the final chapters of the Natural History, Hume argues that both theistic and polytheistic religions impiously ascribe immoral or amoral actions to their divinities: the polytheistic, because the anthropomorphic forces of nature are amoral; the theistic, because as the deity is elevated in power and knowledge, his vengeance and punishments carry him below human concepts of right and wrong (Ch. 13). In his conclusion, Hume considers both polytheistic and theistic forms of belief to be symptoms of pathological human tendencies, and con tinues to regard theism as the more dangerous. The extremes of what is good, great, and sublime border on "the absurd, the mean, the terrifying" (184). Hume asks his readers to "examine the religious principles which have, in fact, prevailed in the world. You will scarcely be persuaded, that they are any thing but sick men's dreams: Or perhaps will regard them more as the playsome whimsies of monkeys in human shape" (184). In this conjectural history of the origins of religious belief, therefore, Hume satirically inverts traditional judgments by satirizing both theism and polythe ism as pathological expressions of human fears and irrationality. It is a calculated ef fect of the form Hume adopts that the history of religion gives evidence of no progress: rather, this satiric narrative designates a stasis, an unceasing ebb and flow or "flux and reflux" of polytheism and monotheism (158). In the end, Hume leaves the reader without any authorized, moderate, or reasonable ground for subscribing to an organized religious belief: the only way to avoid the religious pathology is to es cape into the calmer atmosphere of philosophical thought and discussion.13 Diderot's Supplement to Bougainville's "Voyage" (c. 1771-72) is not primarily a conjectural history, whether one cast in a satiric form like Hume's or one contain ing satiric elements like Rousseau's; rather, it is a narrative satire that leads up to and imbeds a brief but powerful conjectural history in its concluding pages. Through the earlier speech of the nameless old Tahitian and the dialogue between the French chaplain and the younger Tahitian named Orou, Diderot establishes a stark opposi tion between modern European civilization and Tahitian society. The first is charac terized by assertions of property?from ownership of real estate and commodities to</page><page sequence="10">Conjectural History and Satire 73 possessiveness in personal and sexual relations?while the second takes shape around a conviction that individual, exclusive, and private property in goods or peo ple is unnatural, and that attempts to live by such perverse canons lead to repression, frustration, unhappiness, even violence and bloodshed. Diderot pursues the perni cious consequences of the unnatural requirement that love be unchanging through the dialogue between Orou and the chaplain, through the digressions, and through the short stories to which he refers at the end of the Supplement.14 The way that such a thesis implies a conjectural history of human societies is already clear from the old Tahitian's lament at the arrival of the French and its consequences. By introducing possessiveness in sexual relations the French have produced its corollaries: jealousy, hatred, and bloodshed. Their visit also infected the Tahitians with the poison of syphilis, and the example of their covetousness taught the Tahitians to feel superflu ous needs and to commit crimes such as theft. The old man asserts that before the Europeans came, the Tahitians held sexual partners in common, did not suffer from jealous rivalries or from syphilis, and did not work for what they did not need, but spent most of the day relaxing in the island's mild climate.15 In the conjectural history implied throughout by the Supplement, then, the con dition of the Tahitians before contact with Europeans serves as the point of depar ture, and the condition of life of the French, the civilized life of modern man, serves as the other terminus, the point toward which history has led. This trajectory is made explicit in the final framing dialogue, when B. offers a "historical sketch of almost all our misery": "Once upon a time there was a natural man; inside him was intro duced an artificial man, and within his breast there then broke out a continual war" which has involved torturous self-denial (71, 510-11). To the fundamental question posed by the conjectural histories, "Is it better to civilise man or to allow him to fol low his instinct?" B. replies, "If you propose to be his tyrant, civilise him; poison him as best you can with a morality contrary to nature. Shackle him in all possible ways. ... Or would you rather be happy and free? Then don't meddle in his affairs; there will be enough unforeseen incidents to lead him to enlightenment and deprav ity; and never allow yourself to forget that it's not for your sake but for theirs that wise lawgivers have moulded and shaped you as you are" (72, 511-12). This passage makes clear the parallels between Diderot's thinking in his specu lative "historical sketch" and that of the other satiric conjectural historians, espe cially Rousseau.16 B.'s characterization of civilization as a system of unnatural constraints echoes Rousseau's description in both discourses of civilization as a con dition of slavery enforced by hidden chains (see 36; OC 3, 7; and 159; OC 3, 177). Moreover, the Tahitians' way of life as depicted by Diderot corresponds closely with that earliest stage of social life which Rousseau considers the most nearly natural and calls the "true youth of the world," the period of the golden mean between nature and civilization where it would have been best for human society to have halted in its development (see Second Discourse, 150-51; OC 3, 170-71). The ironic reference to the disciplining of humankind by "wise lawgivers" recalls not only the illegitimate social contract proposed by the rich in the Second Discourse, but also Mandeville's account of the foundational taming of man as the work of cunning legislators in Part One of his Fable.</page><page sequence="11">74 Frank Palmeri Finally, like other narrative satires, the Supplement to Bougainville's "Voyage" leaves readers suspended between opposite positions. As the entire dialogue, and the old man's speech in particular, makes clear, the golden age of property-less relations between people has now been lost on Tahiti and elsewhere. In modern Europe, B. maintains, perhaps only the Calabrians still live in a state of lawless anarchy?brutal, untamed, and uncorrupted. The other European states gravitate toward the opposite extreme, exemplified by the oligarchic republic of Venice?hyper-civilized, authori tarian, and corrupt (72-74). B. suggests no available alternative between these two comparably amoral kinds of societies.17 III. HERDERAND CONDORCET J. G. Herder's Ideas for a Philosophy of History of Mankind (1784-91) is in some ways anomalous among the histories considered here. Herder's work is longer than other conjectural histories, and most of its second half provides a survey of civ ilized societies that begins with the earliest cultures in Asia, then turns to the West and proceeds as far as the Renaissance in Europe. Ideas attempts not to provide a complete narrative history of any of these societies, but rather to delineate the essen tial or defining spirit of the various cultures it considers. It is also true that Ideas is less naturalistic than most conjectural histories. Herder asserts that God gave man re ligion and language (256, 347), and he believes that priests were the original philosophers and men of science. On the other hand, he also argues that they eventu ally became servants of the powerful in pursuit of their own power (252-53, 341-42), and he provides a naturalistic account of the earliest stages of human lan guage in his Essay on the Origin of Language (1772).18 Like Mandeville, Herder maintains that rulers make use of superstitious religious beliefs in order to manipu late their people as though they were puppets (252, 342). And like Rousseau, he em phasizes the unacceptable moral oxymoron that "in large states, hundreds must pine with hunger, that one may feast and carouse: thousands are oppressed, and hunted to death, that one crowned fool or philosopher may gratify his whims" (223, 304). Thus, both the differences and the convergences between Herder's Ideas and the other conjectural histories are striking. Herder's global survey of cultures and their history enables him to be more critical and satiric than his predecessors of Eu rope's ethnocentric presumption of superiority. For example, he sees enslaved South American natives as "bruised worms, that appear hateful to our eyes because we have bruised them with our feet!" (159, 222); significantly, Herder considers that re sponsibility for such brutality is shared among all Europeans. In a similar spirit, he criticizes the European states because "it has been for centuries the object of united Europe to erect herself into a despot, compelling all the nations of the Earth to be happy in her own way" (224, 305). The scope of Herder's Ideas allows for such broad perspectives that enable readers to perceive continuities between human soci eties in history and the pre-history of human groups. Herder reflects at one point that the history of "our old Earth," including both historical periods and earlier times, "forms a melancholy picture of man-hunting and conquests: almost every little</page><page sequence="12">Conjectural History and Satire 75 variation of a boundary, every new epoch, is delineated in the book of time with the blood of human victims and the tears of the oppressed. The most celebrated names are those of murderers of mankind, crowned or crown seeking executioners" (247, 334). Such formulations echo the sharp satire in Gulliver's Travels, Book 3, of the historical record for celebrating traitors and mass murderers, yet consigning to obliv ion the brave and honest if unsuccessful defenders of their country. Despite Herder's acknowledgment of the accomplishments and limitations of most cultures, he focuses fiercely on the culture of Rome, finding nothing to praise in either the republic or the empire. However, this one-sided satire of Rome eventually leads Herder, unlike most of the other conjectural historians, to imagine a legitimate and plausible middle ground?a politically and culturally united Germany no longer dominated by Rome or by its modern counterpart, France. Herder sees the Romans as intent solely on the "mad aim" of unlimited subjugation and conquest: they were "ravagers of the world" (397, 529), and their city a "nest of robbers" (416, 552) whose art was all plundered (423-35, 561-76). By contrast, Herder believes the an cient Greeks exemplify the youth of mankind. He laments the loss of most Greek works of art, philosophy, and literature, even the disappearance of their gods. Yet he also acknowledges the dependence of Greek culture on slaveholding, and cautions against taking the Greeks as a model for literal imitation (368-90, 491-520). In these judgments of the ancient cultures, Herder seems to identify the political and cultural hegemony of the eighteenth-century French with that of the ancient Romans, and the independent spirit of contemporary Germans with that of the ancient Greeks. Still, although he represents the German tribes as valuing freedom and justice, he does not make them a lost ideal for which he longs nostalgically. In his view, the bar barism of the German tribes combined with the "barbarism of the papacy" to pro duce the "german romish chaos" (560, 740) of the Holy Roman empire, which enabled the Popes to support various petty nobles and powerful churchmen in order to keep Germany disunited. Thus, Herder criticizes the Germans for being partly re sponsible for their own lack of political unity, just as he criticized the Greeks for their slaveholding. However, he satirizes the Romans much more fiercely and com prehensively than either of these peoples whom he considers to be among the victims of Roman influence. In the one-sidedness of its attack on Rome, Herder's work re sembles not so much narrative satire as verse satire, one of the few literary innova tions of the Romans. Ironically, in Ideas Herder attacks the Romans relentlessly, yet in doing so employs a form that is closely identified with the Romans themselves. In the Sketch for a Historical Picture of the Progress of the Human Mind (1795) Antoine-Nicolas de Caritat, marquis de Condorcet, adopts a very wide historical per spective, as Herder did in his Ideas', the logic of Condorcet's narrative even carries him into a conjectural history of the future. Condorcet's Sketch, written while he was in hiding and condemned to death by the revolutionary National Assembly, articu lates the past history and present state of human society in nine stages. The formally innovative tenth stage devoted to the future foresees a new epoch of unending im provement in the conditions of human life. In his Introduction to the Sketch, Con dorcet uses some of the same terms that Rousseau and Stewart employed to describe such a project, acknowledging that his history cannot help but be "hypothetical" and</page><page sequence="13">76 Frank Palmeri "theoretical" because of the lack of documents and material objects to serve as its basis (9, 9). Already in the first stage, Condorcet diagnoses the principal kinds of his torical agents he believes determine the course of human affairs in succeeding ages. First among these is the man of genius, the scientific or technological innovator who works in isolation yet provides inestimable benefits to his kind; the bow was an in novation of such a genius (16, 16). The earliest stage of socialization also sees the separating out of two other classes of people: one of these, by far the most numerous, consists of followers, believers; the other is made up of priests who gain power by imposing on the simplicity of these superstitious men. Already in the first stages, "the credulity of the original dupes, and ... the crude cunning of the original impos tors" (17-18, 19) obstructs the progress initiated by lone scientific reasoners. Like Mandeville and Hume, Condorcet hypothesizes that religious beliefs orig inate in irrational and fearful suppositions about unknown forces; like Mandeville and Diderot, he understands the foundation of society to have been the result of a conspiracy by cunning legislators. Furthermore, Condorcet emphasizes and extends the insight of these thinkers that political authority has been allied with religious au thority throughout human history. In fact, in each successive chapter and stage of his history, he recounts both the advances and insights made by rational philosophers and scientists as well as the ways they have been blocked and rendered inconsequen tial by the combined forces of priests and kings. In the most salient instance of such a pattern, Galileo saw the imperfections on the surface of the moon, but was forced to retract his offending statements in the face of persecution by Catholic authorities. The example of Galileo's case persuaded Descartes to withhold publication of his own natural philosophy and thus retarded other advances in the physical sciences. It can also sometimes happen that actions of the oppressive authorities ironically lead to liberating results: the Popes did not intend that the Crusaders would return to Eu rope carrying an acquaintance with Muslim learning and science, but they did. At each stage, then, Condorcet sees tension at work between the same forces: typically, a step forward toward truth and freedom by the agents of reason provokes or is op posed by a step backward that tightens the authority of tyranny and superstition. The result of each chapter is a stalemate between opposing forces. Despite this approxi mate equilibrium between the strength of the two sides, Condorcet does not distance himself from both alternatives in the way that, for example, Diderot does in his Sup plement. Rather, Condorcet bitterly satirizes the political and religious authorities in each period and celebrates his heroes of reason. The resulting single-voiced satire more nearly approaches the form used by Rousseau, Herder, and formal verse satirists, than the narrative satire of Mandeville, Hume, or Diderot. The strongest evidence of Condorcet's identification with the scientists and technicians comes in the unique and prophetic tenth stage, which sketches a history of the future. Even in the ninth stage, devoted to Condorcet's own time, he under stands the liberated and revolutionary societies of France and America to be islands in the midst of repression and error. However, with the unexplained but imminent de feat of oppressive forces, Condorcet imagines a utopia of progress in which there will be a system of insurance to provide a livelihood for people in their old age (181, 213); a move toward the social, legal, and professional equality of women and men</page><page sequence="14">Conjectural History and Satire 11 (193, 228); the development of an artificial universal language in which scientific discoveries could be communicated (191, 225); an improvement in the general level of human intelligence and morality (185, 218); an increase in the productivity of the earth and a rise in the standard of living of human societies (188, 221-22); and the eradication of infectious and hereditary diseases leading to an indefinite extension of the period of human life (199, 235-36). Freed from the constraints of tyranny and religion, war and prejudice, human societies will develop toward perfection. Utopia may be the other side of satire, but the utopias of Rousseau and Diderot were located in the past. By locating his utopia in the near future, Condorcet implies a moral charge to work for its realization, developing the form of conjectural history beyond satiric d?mystification of the past and toward an ethical vision of the future. IV. CONJECTURAL HISTORY SATIRIZED The line of conjectural histories that extends from Mandeville through Con dorcet exhibits strong continuities in perspective and reiterated satiric implications. However, the d?mystifications carried out by these speculative histories were them selves capable of being parodied. A satiric counterattack took shape early in the his tory of the form, when Edmund Burke's A Vindication of Natural Society was published in 1756, a year after Rousseau's Discourse on Inequality and a year before Hume's Natural History of Religion. Thus, Burke's satire of conjectural histories possesses a strangely proleptic quality; it satirically parodies some works that had not yet been written, but whose potential realization in the culture Burke foresaw. The Vindication takes the form of a letter to a young lord from an anonymous noble man modeled closely on Henry St. John, Viscount Bolingbroke, whose previously unpublished philosophical works had just been printed posthumously in 1754.19 The Preface added to the second edition of the Vindication (1757) states that the aim of the work is to show that "without the Exertion of any considerable Forces, the same Engines which were employed for the Destruction of Religion, might be employed with equal Success for the Subversion of Government" (6). Burke as editor and au thor seeks to expose through parodie exaggeration the letter writer's project of chal lenging the legitimacy of civil society as he has already undermined belief in revealed religion. We may say that the aim of the Vindication is to demystify the de my stifiers. The noble letter writer argues that human society is founded on and character ized largely by warfare?the taking of huge numbers of human lives in the interest of temporarily expanding the political power of one man or a state. When the writer cal culates how many people were killed in wars and civic turmoil in the history of Eu rope and the near East before the religious conflicts of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, he comes to a total of thirty-six million. However, because this number represents those who died in only one corner of the world and omits modern history entirely, he goes on to suggest that a truer figure for the number of people killed by other men in battles might be one thousand times as much, or thirty-six billion. This would have been about seventy times the approximate population of the earth at the</page><page sequence="15">78 Frank Palmeri time, and thus likely to strike many readers then and now as disproportionate, in charging almost all deaths in human history to the effects of war and attendant depre dations such as famine, plundering, and disease (35-36 n.32, 38).20 The editor im plies that such grim calculations are inaccurate, include only a small part of the history of mankind, omit the extensive accomplishments of civilization, and are per nicious because they undermine established political authority. The noble letter writer would agree about the implications of his argument: his avowed thesis is that artificial society is illegitimate. He even makes explicit the par allel between arguments for natural religion and arguments for natural society: "If you say, Natural Religion is a sufficient Guide without the foreign Aid of Revelation, on what Principle should Political Laws be necessary?" (94). We might acknowledge that some exaggeration figures in his presentation of human history as a virtually un interrupted series of wars and massacres. However, if one were to accept the num bers the writer draws from classical sources, and halt the enumeration as he does before the sixteenth century, then multiply his total of thirty-six million not by a thousand but, say, by ten or a hundred?to take into account wars that occurred in other parts of the globe, or before written records, or whose history has been lost, and also to register the numbers killed in wars between 1500 and the letter writer's own time?the numbers are still sobering, if not staggering. The writer points out that not only are all these deaths chargeable to society, but, following Swift in Book 4 of Gulliver's Travels and Montesquieu in letter 105 of the Persian Letters, that im proved technologies of destruction increase substantially the numbers of those killed in modern warfare (39). Burke finds himself in a bind here: he implies that we should not consider how many people have died as a result of warfare because that way of thinking shakes the foundation of the social order, yet he introduces such calculations himself for the purposes of parody, and it is neither easy nor perhaps justified to turn away from such an account merely because it may have troublesome implications. Burke's edi tor may be in a position like Swift's tale-teller in A Tale of a Tub (of which there are numerous verbal echoes in the Vindication). He has deployed an ironic language some of whose ramifications may escape his control; some of what he intends to be taken ironically can be accepted straightforwardly, as accurate and insightful, if rarely stated publicly. In fact, under cover of writing what is unacceptable, Burke may have allowed himself to express truths in the voice of another that he could not otherwise utter and that he may not have consciously acknowledged. If his satire were clear and unambiguous, there would have been no need for him to write a Pref ace a year after the first edition explaining his satiric purpose and naming his in tended target. I would suggest that there is a powerful undertow in the Vindication, a strong resistance by the parodied voice to being parodied.21 In the course of his satiric at tack on the natural history of early society, Burke in fact anticipates and expresses some of the strongest critiques of civilization which will be made by later conjec tural historians. For example, his account of the wars of the Romans?the conquest of all their neighbors during the early Republic, the extensive destruction, death, and enslavements that took place during the Punic Wars, as well as the wars with the</page><page sequence="16">Conjectural History and Satire 79 Gauls, the Spaniards, the slaves, with Jugurtha and Antiochus, and the long and wasting civil wars (29-32)?carries an implication similar to Herder's later charac terization of the Romans as unoriginal and bloody-minded plunderers and thieves. Even more disquieting is the letter writer's discussion of slavery in both the an cient and modern worlds. In addition to the slavery in which perhaps three-quarters to nine-tenths of the inhabitants of the ancient world lived, the large majority of mankind throughout recorded history has endured either such literal slavery or a life without freedom under despotic and authoritarian rulers. Moreover, the writer ar gues, democracy does not appreciably improve the conditions of life because such a government merely replaces the unjust tyranny of one man with an unreliable and unjust tyranny of the many. Even the mixed form established under the English con stitution has only made the history of his own country a series of "continual Feuds, Wars, and Conspiracies. . . . Confiscations, Banishments, Attainders, and Execu tions, make a large Part of the History of such of our Families as are not utterly ex tinguished by them" (74-75). The letter writer finds that all forms of government lead to widespread inequities, corruption, and suffering. Finally, the writer's account of the delays, costs, and injustices instituted by the law closely parallels Rousseau's account of the establishment and the consequences of the false social contract in the Discourse on Inequality (76-84). "No Pretence can be so ridiculous" as the idea that the law was established to protect the poor and the weak from the rich and the strong: "If the poor Man is not able to support his suit, according to the vexatious and ex pensive manner established in civilized Countries, has not the Rich as great an Ad vantage over him as the Strong has over the Weak in a State of Nature?" (82). The double perspectives characteristic of narrative satire are at work in Burke's Vindication. The letter sets out to provide a satiric parody of the destabilizing effect of writings that search into the origins of civil society and natural religion, but it is possible, against this line of interpretation, to read the letter as a non-ironic conjec tural history itself, a narrative and a critique of the early stages of human society and of the institutions established in those days. On the principal issue that threads its way through all the conjectural histories?the value and costs of civilization?these two incompatible perspectives stand opposed and suspended in the Vindication, leaving readers with no secure or unambiguous ground of interpretation to occupy, and with no certainty where Burke takes his stand. One later satiric attack on the conjectural histories?especially on Condorcet's Utopian history of the future?exhibits little if any of the ambivalence in the Vindi cation. Although it has been called many things, Thomas Malthus's Essay on the Principle of Population (1798) has not, to my knowledge, been regarded as a conjec tural history. Yet the Essay takes its rise from a critical engagement with some asser tions of William Godwin and of Condorcet in his tenth stage that foresee the possibility of an end to hunger and famine because of increases in agricultural pro ductivity, and, as Condorcet puts it, because people may come to feel that it is more responsible to bring into the world greater happiness and a smaller number of chil dren, rather than the misery that attends uncontrolled reproduction (188-89, 222-23). Malthus replies with his well-known argument that as food supply rises, so will population, with the poorest portion of the population always living just at</page><page sequence="17">80 Frank Palmeri subsistence level. In order to support this response, Malthus's Essay takes the form of a conjectural history of the conditions of life among savages and pastoral or bar barian peoples in Chapter 2 of the first edition and in the greatly expanded Book 1 of the second edition of 1803. Using the same materials as the conjectural histories? accounts of travelers, missionaries, and merchants?Book 1 surveys the checks to population especially by means of misery and suffering in the least developed peo ples from around the world, then in remote, non-Western civilizations, and finally in the ancient Mediterranean world. Book 2 continues the survey focusing on the coun tries of northern Europe from Russia to England and Scotland. Thus, approximately half of Malthus's expanded Essay is devoted to a conjectural history of society that in effect rewrites and invalidates the satiric conjectural histories. Malthus does not ascribe the miseries of the social state to scheming politicians (as Mandeville does) or to power-hungry priests (as Diderot does), nor does he regard the earliest state nostalgically as the ideal condition for mankind (as Rousseau does). Rather, in all states of society, substantial portions of the population have lived in misery and want because of the iron law that population will always keep up with and push against the food supply, and will only be checked by starvation, disease, or war. Malthus's rep resentation of the conditions of life in all societies agrees with that put forward by the letter writer in Burke's Vindication; however, the cause of the ubiquitous wars and plagues in human history is not political society, as the letter writer maintains, but rather a natural law, capable of mathematical formulation, that would affect the human animal outside society as well as in the social state. Thus, in Malthus's hands, the tradition of satiric conjectural history gives way to the social scientific conjec tural history that informs the study of political economy in the nineteenth century. All of these thinkers from Mandeville to Malthus give narrative form to their speculations about how social groups must have originated and developed, in order to offer explanations of human society and its institutions. In addition, these narra tive constructions are consistently accompanied and shaped by satiric attacks on those who are seen as obstacles to the realization of the human potential for happi ness, whether these are understood to be priests, politicians, kings, or the Enlighten ment thinkers themselves. It may be that all history bears some satiric, revisionary relation to a previous historical vision. But, in addition to that, narrative satire and conjectural history share a similar structure because such satire remains open-ended, suspended between alternate cultural positions, and conjectural history, demystify ing in its aspirations but based only on hypothesis and speculation, itself remains suspended between sacred narratives of historical time and the modern narratives of the social sciences. However, such a complementary relation between narrative satire and conjectural history does not eliminate a persistent tension between them. Whereas the historical narrative possesses a forward drive that seeks to connect the conjectural past with the present as its likely explanation, the satiric elements in these works tend to freeze the diegesis and halt its progress, fixing attention instead on images such as the silver buckles in Smith, the fanatical monkeys in Hume, or the flower-draped chains in Rousseau. After Malthus had established a view of the nature of society in prehistoric as well as historical times, the tradition of conjectural history was submerged by other</page><page sequence="18">Conjectural History and Satire 81 genres of historical narrative. But the form did not die, and it continued to exert its influence by providing a framework for a number of social science disciplines?po litical economy, but also ethnology, sociology (especially sociology of religion), cul tural anthropology ([ADD:] E. B. Tylor's Primitive Culture and Darwin's Descent of Man, [ADD:] both 1871), genealogical history (Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morals, 1888), and psychoanalysis (Freud's Totem and Taboo, 1913; Civilization and its Dis contents, 1930). In fact, conjectural history provided a framework for the modern so cial sciences that study the establishment and the history of society, laws, and customs in naturalistic terms. A new kind of conjectural history re-emerges in Michel Foucault's histories, which assume an adversarial, satiric relation to those very social science disciplines with their newly established narratives of historical understanding. Like The Wealth of Nations, a work such as Discipline and Punish (1975) seeks to bridge a gap, to explain a transition from one stage of social and institutional life to another, with little documentary evidence of the means by which the change was effected. More over, it seeks to illuminate and demystify the ongoing disciplining of mankind by distinctively modern means in the contemporary world. Such a focus joins the con cern with the taming of mankind in Mandeville's Fable, Rousseau's Second Dis course, Nietzsche's Genealogy and Freud's Civilization and its Discontents. Like his predecessors in this line of conjectural history, Foucault's revisionary historical narratives satirically question the value of recent steps in taming the human animal by civilization.22 ENDNOTES 1. On Rousseau's use of narratives of travel, for example, see Pire. 2. On the levelling effect of narrative satire, see Palmeri, Satire in Narrative, 10-18. 3. My understanding of narrative satire here builds on Mikhail Bakhtin's works?especially chapter 4 of Problems of Dostoevski's Poetics, on the carnivalesque. On the open-ended suspension between op posed extremes in satire, see Satire in Narrative, 1-10. 4. George Hind argues that the Fable is a menippean satire. In my understanding of these forms, narrative satire is closely related to menippean satire but is less confined to formal features such as the interpo lation of verse in a predominantly prose work. Narrative satire, the broader category, includes menip pean satire. 5. Phillip Harm argues that the primary object of Mandeville's satire is the hypocrisy and inconsistency of respectable Christians in England. In his reading of the work, Mandeville originally attacks real or pretended rigorism, but beginning in 1723, he adds strong criticism of benevolism as being equally mistaken in its view of human nature (340). 6. The parallel with Vico's argument in the New Science is striking. The first edition of Vico's work was published in Naples in 1725; Part Two of the Fable first appeared in 1729.1 do not know of any evi dence indicating that Mandeville read or knew of Vico's argument before (or after) writing Part Two of the Fable. 1.

On the widespread and conventional nature of such disclaimers in the mid-eighteenth century, see, for example, Otis Fellows, 192. 9. An even more sharply satiric version of this contract appears in the Discourse on Political Economy, which Rousseau wrote as an article for the Encyclopedia in the same year as the Discourse on In equality. There again, the rich man proposes a founding compact: "You need me, for I am rich and you are poor; let us make an agreement between us: I shall permit you to have the honor of serving me on the condition that you give me what little you have left in return for the trouble I shall be taking to command you." Rousseau's Political Writings, 83. 10. Robert Wokler notes that in the Second Discourse Rousseau also went further than his contempo raries in calling into doubt the officially asserted absence of continuity between humans and other an imals, especially apes (1171). 11. Bolingbroke also argued that the growth of population in society would have led to wars in early human history (4, 51-53). 12. That Rousseau was thinking of the Roman satirist is clear from his quoting three lines from Juvenal's Satire 15 in Part One of the Discourse (131; OC 3, 155). I also discuss note 9 of the Second Discourse as a Juvenalian satire in Satire, History, Novel, 305. 13. For a discussion of the Natural History of Religion that stresses the reasonableness of philosophical theism, see Donald W. Livingston, 57-79. 14. Based on her close reading of the dialogue between Orou and the chaplain, Wilda Anderson finds that the mores of the Tahitians as represented by Diderot are not directed toward preserving non-propri etorial sexual relations, but rather have an economic aim: to encourage reproduction and to increase the number of children, who constitute the islanders' principal form of wealth (127-167). 15. On the differences between the representation of Tahitian mores in Bougainville's Voyage and in Diderot's Supplement, see Ralph Leigh, 119. 16. In his Confessions, Rousseau places the responsibility for the dark tone and satiric implications of his Second Discourse on Diderot, by whom he says he was influenced at the time (362, 377; OC 1, 389, 405). 17. Dena Goodman argues, by contrast, that the Supplement as a whole is structured so that it shapes ma terialist philosophy and the lessons of the travel narratives into a call for political action. 18.

On the resistance of the parodied discourse to the parodie discourse, see Bakhtin, Dialogic Imagina tion, 413, 419. 22. Not seeing Foucault's narratives as satiric conjectural histories has led some to criticize them on the positivistic ground that they are occasionally mistaken about historical particulars.
