<plain_text><page sequence="1">Religious Beliefs and Therapeutic Orientations of Clinical and Counseling Psychologists DYER P. BILGRAVEt ROBERT H. DELUTYt A 65-item questionnaire was used to examine the relations among religious beliefs and psycho- therapeutic orientations in a national sample of 237 clinical and counseling psychologists. Sixty-six percent of these psychologists believed in the transcendent; 72% asserted that their religiouts beliefs influenced their practice of psychotherapy, and 66% claimed that their practice of therapy influenced their religious beliefs. Psychologists who affirmed Christian beliefs tended to endorse the cognitive-behavioral orientation, and those who affirmed Eastern and mystical beliefs tended to endorse humanistic and existential orientations. These findings suggest (a) that most psychologists synthesize personal Weltanschauungen composed of elements derived from both their study of psychology and their exposure to religion and (b) that these syn- theses are not random, that specific religious beliefs are differentially associated with specific psychotherapeutic orientations. NTRODUCTION Each culture possesses a Weltanschauung, a comprehensive view of the world. The cur- rent Weltanschauung in the West is a curious amalgam, consisting of religious, humanistic, scientific, and romantic elements (Frank 1977; Kurtz 1985; Woolfolk and Richardson 1984). Its religious elements stem primarily from our Judeo-Christian heritage and stress a correct relationship with God reflected in loving relationships with others and in moral conduct. Its humanistic and scientific elements - sometimes referred to jointly as secular humanism stem primarily from our Greco-Roman heritage and the intellectual developments of the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, and positivistic philosophy and stress the use of reflective reason (a) to gain objective knowledge, (b) to choose wisely among conflicting values - none of which has a transcendent source - and (c) to work toward personal well being and social equality and justice (Woolfolk and Richardson 1984). Its romantic elements - sometimes referred to as romantic humanism - stem, in part, from the Romantic movement of the first half of the eighteenth century and stress subjective, immediate experience, the cultiva- tion of affect and intuition, and the creation of personal meaning through authentic choice (Kurtz 1985; Woolfolk and Richardson 1984). These diverse elements coexist in an uneasy, unstable balance: Often, they are in conflict. As with each culture, each individual, too, possesses a personal Weltanschauung, a personal belief system, an explanatory matrix, a unique map of the world and picture of self (Allport 1950; Berger and Luckmann 1966; Frank 1974, 1977; Fuller 1984; O'Donohue 1989; Quackenbush 1989; Rokeach 1973; Strupp 1978; Strupp and Binder 1984; Unger 1978). tDyer P.

It is largely socially constructed, derived and maintained through interpersonal transactions (Berger 1969; Berger and Luckmann 1966; Carver and Scheier 1982; Frank 1974). Consequently, this personal Weltanschauung is strongly influenced by the larger cultural Weltanschauung, which establishes the social context of these interpersonal transactions and marks the ideological boundaries within which an individual's conceptual world must be built. As our current cul- tural Weltanschauung possesses both strong religious and saentific-humanistic elements, it stands to reason that many individuals within our culture will have personal Weltanschauungen that also possess these elements. And among these individuals could be clinical and counseling psychologists who practice psychotherapy. That clinical and counseling psychologists possess world views with strong scientific elements can be taken as a given (Kimble 1989). But do these psychologists have strong religious beliefs as well? If so, what are these beliefs? How are they related to psychothera- peutic orientation? Do they influence psychotherapeutic practice? Does psychotherapeutic practice influence religious beliefs? These are among the questions that stimulated our curiosity and led to this study. There is a body of theoretical literature that suggests that many psychologists do take religion quite seriously. Some of psychology's leading historical figures invested consider- able effort in reflecting on the relations among religion, psychology, and psychotherapy. Among these are Hall (1891), James (1902), Jung (1936, 1938, 1970), Allport (1950), Maslow (1971), and Rogers (1980). Contemporary psychologists, too, are seriously attempting to integrate scientific and religious belief systems, especially in relation to the practice of psy- chotherapy. These psychologists are producing a body of theoretical literature that explores several interrelated themes. One theme is that the dividing line between religion and science begins to blur as a postpositivistic philosophy of science begins to challenge the traditional view that science is strictly empirical and rational (Jones 1994; O'Donohue 1989). A second theme is that psychotherapists use their values, often religious in both nature and origin, to determine the goals and to guide the course of their work (Bergin 1980, 1991; Beutler 1979; Gorsuch 1988; Jones 1994; Nilsen 1980; O'Donohue 1989; Strupp 1978). And a third theme is that religion and psychotherapy, at a deep level of analysis, are functionally and even structurally equivalent (Csikszentmihalyi 1993; Dow 1966; Frank 1961, 1974; Kilboume and Richardson 1984; Maton and Wells 1995; Van Eenwyk 1989). In addition to the literature addressing these broad themes, there is a small body of theoretical work that traces an affinity between a humanistic orientation and mystical beliefs. Tisdale (1990) asserted that the major assumptions of humanistic psychotherapy are highly congenial with those of Christianity's mystical and pietistic traditions. He noted a parallel between the emphasis in humanistic psychotherapy on the client's own immediat ?experiendingw and the emph in Christian mystical traditions on the centrality of the individual's inner, highly personal experience of God. Fuller (1982, 1984) argued that Rogers's theories stem from the same cultural Weltanschauung that gave rise to an American spirituaity, a spirituality that can be traced from Jonathan Edwards to Ralph Waldo Emerson to William James, a spirituality that contends that individuals 'have an innate psychological capacity to apprehend - and become inwardly connected - to an immanent divinity' (Fuller 1984: 31). Fuller proposed (a) that Rogers translated these religious beliefs into secular and psychological terms and (b) that Rogers's theories evolved directly from his early, extensive religious aining (includig seminary) and ambitions. Fulleres identification of the religious elements in Rogers' work is seconded by Jones (1994), who speaks of the TMquasi-religious view of persons behind the Rogerian person-centered counseling model" (194).</page><page sequence="3">RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND THERAPEUTIC ORIENTATIONS 331 In addition to this historical and theoretical literature, there is recent empirical work that strongly suggests that a sizeable proportion of rank-and-file American psychologists (a) believe in the transcendent, (b) rate spirituality as personally relevant, (c) believe that their religious beliefs help them to be effective therapists, and (d) even use religious language and specific religious techniques in their practice of psychotherapy (Bergin and Jensen 1990; Jensen and Bergin 1988; Shafranske and Malony 1990a, 1990b). The present study had four objectives. The first was to identify some of the specific religious beliefs held by clinical and counseling psychologists. In choosing this objective, we followed the suggestions of Bergin and Jensen (1990), Gorsuch (1988), and Jones (1994), who all urged that the religious beliefs of psychologists be made explicit. The second objec- tive was to examine the general hypothesis that specific religious beliefs are differentially associated with specific psychotherapeutic orientations. This hypothesis was based on the propositions (a) that many psychologists use selected religious beliefs and values to guide their psychotherapeutic work and (b) that individuals assimilate new information into preexisting cognitive models (Leventhal et al. 1984; Spilka et al. 1985). For many psycholo- gists, this may mean that psychological belief systems, developed in adolescence and early adulthood, must be assimilated into their preexisting religious belief systems developed much earlier. Consequently, these preexisting religious belief systems could well influence their choice of psychological belief systems and their degree of commitment to them. The third objective was to examine the specific hypothesis that mystical religious beliefs are more strongly associated with the humanistic orientation than with the other psychological orientations. This hypothesis was based (a) on the observation that both mystical religions and humanistic psychotherapies enjoin those seeking healing and guidance to "look within" (Tisdale 1990) and (b) on the proposition that Rogers's theories are secular translations of religious beliefs (Fuller 1982, 1984; Jones 1994). Finally, if the data did indeed reveal dif- ferential associations among religious beliefs and psychotherapeutic orientations, the fourth objective was to explore, albeit in a preliminary way, direction of causality. Although we based the study on a unidirectional model of causality (i.e., religious orientation influences choice of psychotherapeutic perspective), we realized that a bidirectional model (religious orientation and psychotherapeutic perspective mutually influence each other) might provide a more accurate description of psychologists' ideological development. METHOD Participants Participants were doctoral-level clinical and counseling psychologists. According to a sample size determination procedure developed for correlational methods (Welkowitz et al. 1990), 197 participants were needed. As a 40% return rate of mailed questionnaires is com- mon for national surveys of psychotherapists (Wogan and Norcross 1985), 501 psychologists were sent packets consisting of a questionnaire, a cover letter, and a stamped return envelope. These psychologists were selected from among those listed in four divisions of the Directory of the American Psychological Association (American Psychological Association 1993): 12 (Clinical), 17 (Counseling), 29 (Psychotherapy) and 32 (Humanistic). An approxi- mately equal number of psychologists were randomly selected from each division. This pro- cedure was not used to get a representative sample of American psychologists but rather to obtain a sample containing psychologists committed to a broad array of psychotherapeutic beliefs and practices. To be selected, a psychologist had to possess a doctorate in either clinical or counseling psychology, be licensed, and show professional involvement in coun- seling or psychotherapy.</page><page sequence="4">332 JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION Measure A 65-item questionnaire assessed (a) demographic variables (gender, age, ethnic iden- tity, academic degree, division of APA, date and type of degree, work setting, and state of residence); (b) membership in religious institutions; (c) frequency of attendance at religious services; (d) psychotherapeutic orientation (behavioral, cognitive-behavioral, psycho- analytic/psychodynamic, humanistic, and existential); (e) degree of agreement with a variety of specific religious beliefs; (f) degree of perceived spiritual support; (g) self-identification as born-again; and (h) degree to which one's religious beliefs are perceived to influence one's practice of psychotherapy and the degree to which one's practice of psychotherapy is perceived to influence one's religious beliefs. Psychotherapeutic orientations. The questionnaire asked participants to designate their theoretical orientations regarding psychotherapy. Self-designation is a common method for assessing theoretical orientation (e.g., see Fischer et al. 1975; Steiner 1978; Tremblay et al. 1986; Walton 1978). In addition, it has demonstrated concurrent and predic- tive validity - especially for behavioral and psychoanalytic therapists - when using two different criterion measures (Herron et al. 1987; Wogan and Norcross 1985). Self- designation is also more economical than orientation scales as scales carry the costs of com- plexity and length. Self-designation does have its limitations, however, when used with humanistic and eclectic therapists. Humanistic therapists may not possess a distinct orientation (Herron et al. 1987), whereas eclectic therapists combine several orientations, making it difficult to identify what any given eclectic therapist actually believes and does. The questionnaire addressed these limitations by following a procedure similar to the one used by Hill and O'Grady (1985). Along with asking participants to choose a single orientation, it also asked participants to rate their degree of commitment to four major therapeutic orientations (psychoanalytic/psychodynamic, cognitive-behavioral, humanistic/experiential, and exis- tential) on a 5-point Likert scale. This procedure allowed therapists who draw from several theoretical systems to articulate more clearly the structure of their own hybrid orientations. Religious beliefs. The questionnaire had 33 items assessing specific religious beliefs. Most of these items asked participants to rate their degree of agreement with the beliefs on a 5-point scale. Several of these items were taken or adapted from previous questionnaires. They included 1. An item asking about belief in God and an item asking about born-again status. These items were taken verbatim from the Gallup surveys on religion (The Gallup Organization 1985). They permitted comparison of the study's sample of psychologists to the general American population. 2. An item asking about Christology or belief in the divinity of Jesus. This item has proved to be a reasonably valid measure of Christian orthodoxy (Gorsuch and McFarland 1972). 3. An item asking about a literal and infallible interpretation of the Bible. This item was one that Gorsuch and McFarland (1972) wished they had used in their comparison of single- versus multiple-item scales for measuring religious values. They suspect it would have loaded highly on a "fundamentalism" factor. 4. An item asking about the importance of encouraging others to accept Jesus as their savior. This item was an adaptation of an item included in the Gallup survey on religions (The Gallup Organization 1985). Following a procedure used by Gallup, this item can be joined with two other items asking about born-again status and a literal interpretation of the Bible to construct an "Evangelical" scale.</page><page sequence="5">RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND THERAPEUTIC ORIENTATIONS 333 5. An item asking about the subjective importance of religion. This item was an adap- tation of one that Gorsuch and McFarland (1972) found to be an excellent measure of an intrinsically proreligious attitude, better even than multiple-item scales. The other items assessing religious beliefs were developed through literature reviews and through discussions with three professors of religion at two different institutions, psy- chology graduate students, and psychology professors. These items examined a wide range of specific religious beliefs, ranging (a) from atheism to belief in an active, personal God; (b) from Eastern to Western beliefs; (c) from highly conservative (e.g., "I believe in Satan") to highly liberal beliefs (e.g., "Religion is a system of rich and distilled symbols that point to deeper truths about human nature"); and (d) from highly concrete beliefs about God (e.g., "A physical being who actually lives somewhere and ... has many of the same attributes that we do") to highly abstract beliefs about God (e.g., "Utterly different and infinitely transcen- dent.... beyond all description, characterization, and comprehension"). The study did not use the most popular questionnaires for the study of religion: questionnaires assessing extrinsic/intrinsic attitudes toward religion (Allport and Ross 1967; Donahue, 1985), means/ends/quest orientations (Batson 1976), committed/consensual orientations (Spilka et al. 1977), mysticism (Hood 1975), and religious experience (Hood 1970). These questionnaires focus on religious attitudes, motivations, and experiences; this study, in contrast, focused on specific religious beliefs. Therefore, even though these estab- lished questionnaires possess demonstrated validity and reliability and a rich research his- tory, they did not serve the purposes of this study. In addition, these established questionnaires (with the exception of Hood's) were designed for use with religiously active Protestants; consequently, their use with other groups is questionable (Spilka 1985). Spiritual support. In addition, the questionnaire had 3 items forming a spiritual sup- port scale. This scale shows validity in cross-sectional and prospective studies, correlates positively with other indices of intrinsic religion, and possesses a Cronbach's alpha of .95 (Maton 1989). Procedure The questionnaire was sent to 501 psychologists along with a cover letter and a stamped return envelope. Psychologists who chose to participate returned the questionnaire directly to the first author. Anonymity was fully respected; respondents were not asked to give their names, and the questionnaires were not coded for either names or return addresses. RESULTS Of the 501 questionnaires sent, 31 (6%) were returned as undeliverable. Of the 470 delivered surveys, 239 (51%) were returned. Two of the returned surveys were rejected because the respondents did not meet inclusion criteria. Thus, 237 psychologists served as participants. It is not known whether respondents differed from nonrespondents. Demographic Characteristics Personal characteristics. Sixty-six percent of the responding psychologists were mile. Their mean age was 52 years (range: 32-81 years), 90% were European American, and they lived in all parts of the country, with the two largest concentrations in the East North Central (21%) and Pacific (20%) regions. Professional characteristics. All of the psychologists possessed doctoral degrees: 87%Z had Ph.D.s; 10% had Ed.D.s; 3% had Psy.D.s. A majority (59%) were clinical psychologists;</page><page sequence="6">334 JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION the rest were counseling psychologists. Forty-six percent worked in private practice, the largest percentage associated with any single work setting. Religious characteristics. A majority of these psychologists held religious beliefs: 66% believed strongly or very strongly in "God or a Universal Spirit," and 74% considered their religon to be "moderately important" to "extremely important" to their lives. The largest religious group represented by self-designation was mainstream Protestant (26%), followed by Jew and Catholic (both 16%), "other" (15%), Agnostic (12%), Eastern (8%), Atheist (6%), and Fundamentalist Christian (1%). Twelve percent of all the psychologists and 26% of the Christian psychologists reported a born-again experience. Two percent met criteria for classification as Evangelical. Of the 33 items tapping specific religious beliefs, "concrete" items were endorsed least, and "abstract" items were endorsed most. Three items received average ratings of less than 1.50 (on a 5-point scale, with 1 representing no agreement and 5 representing very strong agreement). In descending order, these items were (a) a belief that Muhammad is the greatest of Allah's prophets (M = 1.33, SD = 0.74), (b) a belief that the Bible is literally and infallibly true (M = 1.32, SD = 0.80), and (c) a belief in an anthropomorphic God (M = 1.25, SD = 0.70). Of the more frequently endorsed items, six received average ratings above 3.00. In ascending order, these items were (a) a belief that an ultimate reality is immanent in all things and that this reality is perceivable (M = 3.14, SD = 1.40); (b) a belief that religion is a system of symbols that point to deeper truths about human nature (M = 3.18, SD = 1.37); (c) a belief that God is utterly different and infinitely transcendent and so beyond description and comprehension (M = 3.20, SD = 1.66); (d) a belief that God is love (M = 3.21, SD = 1.51); (e) a belief that the basic value of religion is a code of ethics, community, and sense of exis- tential security (M = 3.61, SD = 1.15); and (f) a belief in God or a Universal Spirit (M = 3.73, SD = 1.49). Psychotherapeutic orientations. When given a forced choice, 40% of the psychologists identified with the humanistic/person-centered/experiential orientation; 34% with the cog- nitive-behavioral; 22% with the psychodynamic; and 4% with the existential. When asked to rate their degree of commitment to these four orientations on a 5-point scale (1 representing no commitment and 5 representing very strong commitment), the psychologists gave a mean rating of 2.88 (SD = 1.21) to the psychodynamic perspective, 3.02 (SD = 1.20) to the existen- tial perspective, 3.42 (SD = 1.06) to the cognitive-behavioral perspective, and 3.56 (SD = 1.07) to the humanistic perspective. Religious Beliefs and the Practice of Psychotherapy Seventy-two percent of the psychologists claimed that their religious beliefs influenced their practice of psychotherapy at a moderate or higher level; 66% claimed that their prac- tice of psychotherapy influenced their religious beliefs. Relations among Religious Affiliations, Area of Degree, Division ofAPA, and Psychotherapeutic Orientations A series of chi-square analyses explored religious affiliation as it related to area of degree, APA division membership, and therapeutic orientation. First, religious affiliation was differentially related to area of degree, x2(4, N = 233) = 24.4, p&lt; .0001, C = .32, X (with area of degree dependent) - .17. Specifically, Christianity predicted a degree in counseling psychology, and Judaism predicted a degree in clinical psychology. Second, religious affiliation was differentially related to membership in APA divisions, X2(12, N = 212) = 23.7, p &lt; .05. Specifically, Christianity was related to exclusive membership in the counseling division: In fact, 74% of those psychologists who belonged excclusively to the counseling</page><page sequence="7">RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND THERAPEUTIC ORIENTATIONS 335 division were Christian, whereas only 29% of those psychologists who belonged exclusively to the psychotherapy division were Christian. However, this relation between Christianity and the counseling division was weak, C = .19, failed to reduce error in prediction, X = .00, and was statistically compromised as 25% of the cells had expected frequencies less than 5. Finally, religious orientation was differentially related to therapeutic orientation, X2(8, N = 220) = 32.5, p &lt; .0001, C = .27, A (with therapeutic orientation dependent) = .12. Specifically, (a) Christianity predicted a cognitive-behavioral orientation; (b) both Eastern and 'other" religious affiliations predicted a humanistic orientation (in fact, 82% of psychologists who identified themselves as Eastern claimed a humanistic orientation); (c) atheism and agnosticism (when merged into a category called "Nonbeliever") predicted a psychodynamic orientation; and (d) Judaism predicted a psychodynamic orientation. Religious Beliefs The 33 items assessing specific religious beliefs were examined to determine their suitability for factor analysis. Six items were discarded: five because their correlations with the other items were too small in absolute value (&lt; .40) and the sixth because its removal made interpretation of the factor structure more straightforward and because its highest correlation with the other items was only .40. The remaining 27 items were subjected to a principal components factor analysis, using mean substitutions for missing values. This principal components analysis identified four factors meeting the Kaiser criterion of eigenvalues greater than 1. This criterion was considered accurate because the number of subjects was large enough, the mean communality was .67, and the ratio of factors to vari- ables was 0.15 (e.g., see Stevens 1992). The factors were then rotated four ways; the oblimin rotation was selected because it yielded the most conceptually clear pattern of loadings. After the oblimin rotation, three of the four factors were judged reliable, each meeting Stevens' criteria for reliability: All items had loadings above the absolute value of .40, and each factor had four or more items with loadings above the absolute value of .60. The first factor, with 13 loadings, was labeled "Orthodox Christianity." It included such statements as "I believe that we find salvation by truly believing in the redemptive power of God through the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ," and it accounted for 37% of the variance. The second factor, with 7 loadings, was labeled "Eastern/Mysticism." It included such statements as "I believe that we can experience God or the Universal Spirit directly through mystical experiences" and "I believe in reincarnation," and it accounted for 20% of the variance. The third factor, with 5 loadings, was labeled "Atheism/Agnosticism." It included such statements as "I believe that there is a very high probability that God does not exist; therefore, I assume that there is no God, and I live my life accordingly." This third factor also included negative loadings on such statements as "I believe in God or a Universal Spirit.' It accounted for 5% of the variance. Unfortunately, a "Jewish" factor failed to emerge. One potential Jewish item ("I believe the Messiah has yet to come") was discarded from the factor analysis because its correlation with any of the other items was too low. Other items that could have loaded on a Jewish factor (e.g., 'I believe that God has made a covenant with us: that as we love Him, keep faithful to Him, and keep His commandments, He will bless us and all those who come after us") loaded on the Christian factor instead. Items that loaded on these three factors were made into three scales (see Appendix). A psychologist's score on these scales was the sum of his or her unweighted scores on the items comprising the scale. In these scales, items with negative loadings on a factor were reverse scored. Cronbach's alpha was .95 for the Orthodox Christianity scale, .87 for the Eastern/Mysticism scale, and .85 for the Atheism/Agnosticism scale.</page><page sequence="8">336 JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION The Orthodox Christianity scale, along with discriminating Christian psychologists from non-Christian psychologists, also seems to discriminate among different types of Christian psychologists, perhaps on a liberal-conservative dimension. Out of a possible score of 65 points on the scale, those psychologists,who self-identified as Mainstream Protestant or Catholic received a mean score of 37 (SD = 12.4) and 38 (SD = 14.8), respectively; those who self-identified as Born Again received a mean score of 44 (SD = 14.6); the five psycholo- gists who could be identified as Evangelical received a mean score of 61 (SD = 6.1), and the two psychologists who self-identified as Fundamentalist/Evangelical/Charismatic received a mean score of 64 (SD = 1.4). In addition, the scale differentiated between the Christian psychologists (n = 69) who did not claim a born-again experience (M = 35.0, SD = 12.9) and the Christian psychologists (n = 24) who did claim such an experience (M = 46.8,SD = 12.7), t(91) = 3.9, p &lt; .0005. Prediction of Psychotherapeutic Orientations These three scales were used as independent variables in a series of multiple regres- sions to examine how well religious beliefs predicted commitment to psychotherapeutic orientations. These multiple regressions used as their dependent variables the four items assessing self-designated psychotherapeutic orientation (psychodynamic/psychoanalytic, humanistic/person-centered/experiential, cognitive/behavioral, and existential). Two multiple regressions were run on each of these four dependent variables. The first set of multiple regressions (a) controlled for gender and age by forcing their entry in the first step as a set and (b) then examined the predictive ability of the three religious scales- The second set of multiple regressions was performed to see if the religious scales, consisting of highly specific religious beliefs, would still retain their predictive ability after controlling for a generalized "pro-religiousness' as well as broad, self-designated religious affiliation. This second set (a) also first controlled for gender and age, entered as a set; (b) then examined the predictive power of three additional independent variables (frequency of religious attendance, personal importance of religion, and experience of spiritual support), entered by using stepwise selection; (c) then added self-designated religious affiliation (Christian, Jew, Nonbeliever, and Eastern), effects coded and entered as a set; and (d) finally added the three religious scales, again entered by using stepwise selection. In reporting the results of these regressions, the following conventions are used: (a) In the tables, for the sake of clarity, both B and fi values are reported, and (b) in the text, 13 values are reported for continuous variables and B values are reported for nominal, coded variables (e.g., see Cohen and Cohen 1983). Prediction of commitment to the psychodynamiclpsychoanalytic orientation. In the primary regression, commitment to the psychodynamic orientation was predicted by Ortho- dox Christianity (1 = -.16, p &lt; .05). Psychologists who had higher levels of agreement with orthodox Christian beliefs expressed lower levels of commitment to the psychodynamic perspective. In the secondary regression, commitment to the psychodynamic orientation was pre- dicted by self-designation as Jewish (B = .64,p &lt; .001). Jewish psychologists, as compared to the other psychologists, expressed higher levels of commitment to the psychodynamic perspective. These findings are summarized in Table 1. Prediction of commitment to the humanistic orientation. In the primary regression, commitment to the humanistic orientation was predicted by age (1 = .20, p &lt; .005) and by Eastern/Mysticism (1 = .34, p &lt; .00005). Psychologists who were older and who had higher levels of agreement with Eastern and mystical beliefs expressed higher levels of commit- ment to the humanistic orientation than did the other psychologists.</page><page sequence="9">RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND THERAPEUTIC ORIENTATIONS 337 TABLE 1 SUMMARY OF REGRESSION ANALYSES FOR VARIABLES PREDICTING COMMlITMENT TO THE PSYCHODYNAMIC/PSYCHOANALYTIC PERSPECTIVE Variable B p AR2 beta delta R2 Primary Regression (N = 222) Step 1 (forced entry) Age .00 -.03 Gender -.01 -.01 .00 Step 2 (stepwise entry) Orthodox Christianity .01 -.16 .03 Multiple R at last step = .16 Adjusted R2 at last step = .01 F(3, 218) at last step = 2.00 Secondary Regression (N = 210) Step 1 (forced entry) Age .00 -.03 Gender -.01 .00 .00 Step 2 (stepwise entry) No variables entered for this step Step 3 (forced entry) Jew (coded) .64 .30 Christian (coded) -.24 -.14 Nonbeliever (coded) .07 .03 Eastern (coded) -.29 -.11 .07 Step 4 (stepwise entry) No variables entered for this step Multiple R at last step = .27 Adjusted R2 at last step = .04 F(6, 203) at last step = 2.61 * ** NOTE: p&lt; .05; p &lt;.001. In the secondary regression, commitment to the humanistic orientation was predicted by five variables: age (D = .20, p &lt; .0 1), self-designation as Christian (B = -.31, p &lt; .0 1), self- designation as a Nonbeliever (B = -.48, p &lt; .005), self-designation as Eastern (B = .63, p &lt; .005), and Eastern/Mysticism (f = .29; p &lt; .0005). Psychologists who were older, who designated themselves as Eastem, and who had higher levels of agreement with Eastem and mystical beliefs expressed higher levels of commitment to the humanistic orientation, whereas psychologists who were younger and who designated themselves as Christians, atheists, and agnostics expressed lower levels of commitment. These findings are summarized in Table 2. Prediction of commitment to the cognitive-behavioral orientation. In the primary regression, commitment to the cognitive-behavioral orientation was predicted by three vari- ables: age (3 = -.18, p &lt; .01), Orthodox Christianity (3 = .13, p &lt; .05), and Eastern/Mysticism (, = -.16, p &lt; .05). Psychologists who were younger and who had higher levels of agreement with orthodox Christian beliefs expressed higher levels of commitment to the cognitive- behavioral perspective, whereas psychologists who were older and who had higher levels of agreement with Eastern and mystical beliefs expressed lower levels of commitment. In the secondary regression, commitment to the cognitive-behavioral orientation was again predicted by three variables: age (3 = -.16,p &lt; .05), spiritual support (I = .16, p &lt; .05), and Eastern/Mysticism ( = -.30, p &lt; .0005).

Prediction of commitment to the existential orientation. In the primary regression, commitment to the existential perspective was predicted by Eastern/Mysticism (3 = .36, p &lt; .00005) and Orthodox Christianity (p = -.14, p &lt; .05). Psychologists who had higher levels of agreement with Eastem or mystical beliefs expressed higher levels of commitment to the existential perspective, whereas psychologists who had higher levels of agreement with orthodox Christian beliefs expressed lower levels of commitment. In the secondary regression, the existential orientation was predicted by self- designation as Christian (B = -.10, p &lt; .05), self-designation as Eastern (B = .16, p &lt; .05), and Eastern/Mysticism (P = .39, p &lt; .00005). Psychologists who designated themselves as Eastern and who had higher levels of agreement with Eastern and mystical beliefs expressed higher levels of commitment to the existential perspective, whereas psychologists who self-designated as Christian expressed lower levels of commitment. These findings are summarized in Table 4. Prediction of the Conviction that One's Religious Beliefs have Influenced One's Practice of Psychotherapy The psychologists were asked to rate the degree to which they agreed with the state- ment, "Do you believe your religious beliefs have influenced your practice of psychother- apy?" This item was used as the dependent variable in a primary and a secondary multiple regression, both using the same variables as the multiple regressions involving psycho- therapeutic orientation. In the primary regression, agreement was predicted by Eastern/Mysticism (p = .43, p &lt; .00005) and Orthodox Christianity (5 = .30, p &lt; .00005). Those psychologists affirming either Eastern and mystical beliefs or orthodox Christian beliefs tended to agree that their religious beliefs have influenced their practice of psycho- therapy. In the secondary analysis, agreement was predicted by seven variables: (a) Importance of Religion (D = .54,p &lt; .00005), (b) Spiritual Support (p = .21,p &lt; .01), (c) self- designation as Jewish (B = -.52, p &lt; .0005), (d) self-designation as Christian (B = -.26, p &lt; .05), (e) self-designation as Eastern (B = .65,p &lt; .001), (f^) Eastern/Mysticism (5 = .18, p &lt;</page><page sequence="12">340 JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION .01), and (g) Atheism/Agnosticism (p = .18, p &lt; .05). Psychologists who believed that their religious beliefs have influenced their practice of psychotherapy tended (a) to deem religion to be personally important, (b) to experience high levels of spiritual support, (c) to self- designate as Eastern, and (d) to hold either Eastern/mystical or agnostic/atheistic beliefs. In contrast, psychologists who did not believe this tended to self-designate as Jewish or Christian. These findings are summarized in Table 5.

This item was used as a dependent variable in a primary and secondary multiple regression using the same variables as the multiple regressions involving psychotherapeutic orienta- tion. In the primary regression, agreement was predicted by Eastern/Mysticism (f = .49, p &lt; .00005) and by Atheism/Agnosticism (,B = -.17, p &lt; .0 1). Psychologists who subscribed to Eastern and mystical beliefs tended to agree that their practice of psychotherapy helped form these beliefs; psychologists who were atheists or agnostics tended to disagree that their practice of psychotherapy influenced their beliefs. In the secondary analysis, agreement was predicted by six variables: (a) Importance of Religion (,B = .38, p &lt; .00005), (b) Spiritual Support (,B = .19, p &lt; .05), (c) self-designation as Jewish (B = -.33, p &lt; .05), (d) self-designation as a Nonbeliever (B = -.51, p &lt; .05), (e) self- designation as Eastern (B = .68,p &lt; .005), and (f) Eastern/Mysticism (3 = .36, p &lt; .00005). Those psychologists who believed their work as psychotherapists influenced their religious beliefs tended (a) to consider their religion personally important, (b) to derive support from their religion, (c) to self-designate as Eastern, and (d) to hold Eastern or mystical spiritual beliefs. In contrast, psychologists who did not believe this tended to self-designate as Jewish, atheists, or agnostics. These findings are summarized in Table 6. DISCUSSION The results of this study confirm those of earlier investigations by Bergin and Jensen (Bergin 1991; Bergin and Jensen 1990; Jensen and Bergin 1988) and Shafranske and Malony (1990a, 1990b). Together, these studies found that psychologists are generally less religious than the American public.1 However, these studies also found that a sizeable pro- portion of psychologists (a) hold religious beliefs, (b) consider their religious beliefs person-</page><page sequence="14">342 JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION ally important, and (c) assert that their religious beliefs influence their practice of psychotherapy.

Two of these associations may be considered especially strong, showing up in multiple data analyses. The first is that Eastern and mystical beliefs are positively associated with the humanistic and existential perspectives, a predicted finding that converges with previous theoretical literature.2 This theoretical literature argues that the humanistic injunction to seek and to trust one's own immediate, inner "experiencing" (and so to connect with a universal, but subjectively experienced, self- actualizing tendency) derives from the mystical injunction to find God (and so to discover one's essential identity, rightful place in the world, and true direction) through meditation, contemplation, and prayer (Fuller 1982, 1984; Jones 1994; Tisdale 1990). The second major - and unpredicted - finding in this study is that psychologists who agree with orthodox Christian beliefs tend to choose the cognitive-behavioral perspective. At a surface level of analysis, this association of Christianity and the cognitive-behavioral perspective makes sense: The ideology of orthodox Christianity conflicts with the core assertions of both the humanistic and the psychodynamic perspectives but does not seem to</page><page sequence="15">RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND THERAPEUTIC ORIENTATIONS 343 conflict with core assertions of the cognitive-behavioral perspective. Consequently, the Christian psychologist can subscribe to the cognitive-behavioral perspective without experiencing the tension of committing to two incompatible belief systems simultaneously, without incurring the discomfort of cognitive dissonance (e.g., see Beutler and Consoli 1992; Festinger 1957). The incompatibility between Christian ideology and humanistic psychology stems from the conflict of the Christian belief that the individual is born a sinner and so stands in need of redemption by God with the humanistic belief that the individual is inherently trustworthy and has within himself or herself the resources needed for self-healing and self- directed growth. The tension between Christian ideology and the psychodynamic perspec- tive arises from the Christian affirmation of religion and the traditional psychoanalytic tendency, beginning with Freud himself, to "devalue" religious belief (Freud 1913/1950, 1927/1964). The seeming harmony between Christian ideology and the cognitive-behavioral perspective stems from the putative absence in the cognitive-behavioral perspective of any metaphysical ideology. The behavioral perspective, as commonly understood, is a set of scientifically derived "psycho-technologies" or explicit "means-ends relations" that have been found, through empirical research, to be effective in changing behavior (Woolfolk and Richardson 1984). In this understanding, behaviorism is devoid of metaphysical content, a prescriptive thrust, or an implicit system of values. Therefore, it does not conflict with the metaphysics, prescriptions, and values of orthodox Christianity. Consequently, behaviorism can be embraced by Christian psychologists with little or no ideological conflict. On a deeper level of analysis, however, this alignment of orthodox Christianity and the cognitive-behavioral perspective is not as untroubled conceptually as it first appears. In this deeper level of analysis, behavioral or cognitive-behavioral therapy is much more than a set of empirically derived techniques for solving emotional and behavioral problems: It is itself grounded in a fully formed ideology with its own preferred epistemology, set of pre- scriptions, ethical assumptions, values, and vision of reality (Cottone 1992). According to Woolfolk and Richardson (1984), behaviorism is based on the worldview of modernity, a view that stresses technicism, rationality, amorality, and classical humanism. This world- view of modernity directly conflicts with the worldview of Christianity. Modernity asks individuals to use their rational abilities to improve their lives, and it looks to science to improve the human condition. Consequently, it places all hope and confidence in human reason, and it asks individuals to observe carefully, think critically, and test all assertions empirically. In sharp contrast, orthodox Christianity places all hope and confidence in a transcendent God, and it asks individuals to acknowledge human limitations (or sin), seek divine forgiveness, trust in salvation, and subjugate their own wills to the will of God. It may be, then, that Christian psychologists, uncomfortable with both psychodynamic and humanistic ideology because they explicitly contradict the Christian world view, embrace the cognitive-behavioral perspective because it - alone among the major psycho- logical perspectives - seems compatible with their religious ideology. This embrace, however, is only partial. It encompasses the techniques of cognitive-behavioral therapy but not the more comprehensive world view of positivistic science and modernity within which those techniques were developed. This selectivity, then, permits the Christian therapist to claim a cognitive-behavioral orientation and adopt associated therapeutic techniques but still maintain a Christian identity. It permits a Christian therapist to say, "I use selected cognitive-behavioral techniques in the service of Christian ends" (e.g., see Jones 1994). But an unconflicted adoption of cognitive-behavioral techniques while remaining a Christian can only occur, perhaps, if the "deep structure" of the cognitive-behavioral perspective is held at arms length, blocked from influencing religious belief, resisted.</page><page sequence="16">344 JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION The Influence of Religious Beliefs on the Practice of Psychotherapy The majority of psychologists (72%) agreed with the statement that their religious beliefs influenced their practice of psychotherapy. These psychologists tended (a) to rate religion as personally important and (b) to experience high levels of spiritual support. This finding was anticipated in both the theoretical and research literatures. The theoretical literature has argued repeatedly that religious beliefs - by providing a compre- hensive and integrated framework of meaning, ethics, and prescriptions for action - must, in religiously committed therapists, influence therapeutic practice (Bergin 1980, 1991; Beutler 1979; Gorsuch 1988; Jones 1994; O'Donohue 1989; Strupp 1978). The research lit- erature has generated evidence supporting this assertion. Shafranske and Malony (1990a) found that 83% of their sample of 47 Californian psychologists agreed that their religious beliefs helped them be effective therapists and 68% agreed that they used religious lan- guage, metaphors, and concepts in their practice. In their much larger survey of 409 psy- chologists belonging to APA Division 12 (Division of Clinical Psychology), Shafranske and Malony (1990b) found that 74% of their psychologists felt religious issues were relevant to their clinical work - a figure very close to the 72% found in this study - and they reported that 57% used religious language or concepts with their clients. Interestingly, the present study also found that those psychologists who self-identify as Jewish are not as likely as the other psychologists to assert that their religious beliefs influence their practice of therapy. This finding was unanticipated, and it can be explained, possibly, in two ways. First, this study found that self-designation as Jewish is differentially associated with the psychoanalytic/psychodynamic orientation, an orientation that has his- torically maintained a relatively explicit agnostic or atheistic stance. The second is that psychologists may self-identify as Jewish either because of religious reasons, affirming specifically Jewish religious beliefs, or because of cultural reasons, sharing a genetic, his- torical, or social background. It may be that self-identification as Jewish for cultural reasons may not carry the same implications for psychotherapeutic practice as self-identification as Jewish for religious reasons and that this study failed to distinguish between these two types of identification. A further unexpected and curious finding emerged: Strong agreement with orthodox Christian beliefs predicted higher levels of agreement with the statement that one's relig- ious beliefs influenced one's practice of therapy, whereas self-designation as Christian pre- dicted lower levels of agreement. This paradox can be explained, perhaps, by examining levels of Christian orthodoxy. Forty-one percent of the sample self-identified as Christian, but only a relatively small portion endorsed highly conservative and orthodox Christian beliefs. For instance, only 2% of the sample reported, simultaneously, (a) a born-again experience, (b) a strong belief in the importance of encouraging others to accept Jesus Christ as their Savior, and (c) a strong belief in a literal and infallible interpretation of the Bible; and only 1% self-identified as fundamentalist. Given the evidence discussed previously that the scale used to measure orthodox Christian beliefs may also be considered an index of how liberal or conservative one's Christian faith is, it appears that highly conservative Christians (i.e., those who scored higher on the scale) tended to agree with the statement that their religious beliefs influence their practice of therapy, whereas more liberal or "mainstream" Christians (i.e., those who scored lower on the scale but who still self- designated as Christian) tended to disagree with the same statement. The Influence of the Practice of Psychotherapy on Religious Beliefs Sixty-six percent of the psychologists believed at a moderate or greater level that their practice of psychotherapy had influenced their religious beliefs. These psychologists were</page><page sequence="17">RELIGIOUIS BELIEFS AND THERAPEUTIC ORIENTATIONS 345 significantly more likely than the others (a) to consider their religion personally important, (b) to feel supported by their religious beliefs, (c) to self-identify as Eastern, and (d) to endorse Eastern or mystical beliefs. The psychologists who were less likely to believe their therapeutic practice had influenced their religious beliefs tended to self-identify as Jewish and Nonbelievers and to affirm atheistic and agnostic beliefs. In considering the finding that agreement with Eastern and mystical beliefs is asso- ciated with the perception of a bidirectional influence between religious belief and thera- peutic practice, it is important (a) to keep in mind the differential afflnity found in this study between Eastern and mystical beliefs and the humanistic and existential orientations and (b) to note that relatively few people in our predominantly Judeo-Christian culture have been raised in Eastern or mystical traditions. It may be - and this is highly conjectural - that some psychologists in our study (a) were either not raised in strong religious traditions or jettisoned their early religious traditions; (b) became interested as adolescents or adults in both "nontraditional" religious traditions and the major psychotherapeutic orientations; (c) perceived an affinity between Eastern and mystical traditions and the humanistic and existential orientations; (d) worked to integrate these religious and psychological ideologies into their understanding and practice of psychotherapy; and then (e) used the results of their therapy to further modify these ideologies. Perhaps these are the psychologists whom Bergin and Jensen (1990) describe as possessing "a spiritual humanism" or a "blend of humanistic philosophy and spirituality that has not been well articulated" (7). Interestingly, degree of agreement with orthodox Christian beliefs failed to help explain the variance of the item addressing the influence of therapeutic practice on religious beliefs. When this is put in the context of findings already discussed, it becomes possible to argue, albeit tentatively, that psychologists with strong, conservative Christian beliefs tend (a) to prefer the cognitive-behavioral perspective over other perspectives, possibly because the cognitive-behavioral perspective does not overtly contradict their religious beliefs and values, and (b) to agree that their religious beliefs influence their psychotherapeutic prac- tice. However, they do not perceive their work in psychotherapy as particularly influencing one way or another their religious beliefs. This pattern stands in sharp contrast to the pat- tern of psychologists who adopt an Eastern or mystical belief system. These psychologists tend (a) to endorse humanistic and existential therapeutic beliefs and (b) to assert a bidirectional influence between their therapeutic practice and their religious beliefs. Psychologists who self-designated as Jewish tended to indicate that their practice of psychotherapy did not influence their religious beliefs; they also tended to claim that their religious beliefs did not influence their therapeutic practice. When these two findings are placed side by side, it seems that Jewish psychologists, of all the psychologists, may allow the least bidirectional influence between religious belief and therapeutic practice. This finding may be explained in one of three ways: (a) as stemming from a methodological diffil- culty, as previously discussed, in measuring Jewish religious beliefs; (b) as resulting from the differential association, again as previously discussed, between Judaism and the psychodynamic/psychoanalytic perspective; and/or (c) as arising from a possible tendency in Jewish therapists - perhaps out of a keen awareness of their minority status - to carefully separate their religious beliefs from their professional practice, especially, perhaps, when treating Christian clients. Future Research Several directions for future research suggest themselves. One would be to extend the sample to include other mental health professionals (e.g., marriage and family counselors, social workers, pastoral counselors, and psychiatrists; see Bergin 1991). Another would be to assess actual therapy sessions to see if differences in religious belief correlate with differ-</page><page sequence="18">346 JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION ences in counseling process and outcome. A third direction would be to study the relations in psychotherapists among three, rather than two, classes of beliefs: psychotherapeutic, religious, and political. Each class provides ideological frameworks for understanding experience, and each advocates specific values for guiding action. A fourth direction would be to conduct a longitudinal study using graduate students in clinical and counseling psy- chology. As these students entered graduate school, they could be assessed for their relig- ious beliefs. When they finished five or six years later, they could then be assessed for their degree of commitment to the major psychotherapeutic orientations to see if their initial religious beliefs predicted their commitment to the various orientations. And a final direc- tion would be to explore further the possibility that psychotherapists with strong religious beliefs follow two different paths when confronted with the task of reconciling their religious and psychological beliefs: Some may use their religious beliefs to direct their practice of therapy while simultaneously shielding these religious beliefs from modification by the potentially challenging beliefs inherent within the major psychotherapeutic perspectives, whereas others may allow a greater bidirectional influence among their religious and psychological beliefs. If this finding is replicated in future research, it would be of interest to explore possible reasons for the disparity. Some of these reasons could be (a) degree of early socialization in a religious tradition; (b) contrasting attitudes toward religion, such as extrinsic/intrinsic attitudes (Allport and Ross 1967; Donahue 1985) or means/ends/quest orientations (Batson, 1976); or (c) differences in basic personality traits, such as degree of "openness to experience" (Costa and McCrae 1992). CONCLUSION This study found that many psychologists possess personal Weltanschauungen that include distinctly religious beliefs, consider these beliefs personally important, use these beliefs to help guide their practice of psychotherapy, and, conversely, use their practice of psychotherapy to modify these beliefs. This finding makes sense when viewed within the intellectual framework provided by those who advocate that knowledge is socially con- structed (Berger 1969; Berger and Luckmann 1966; Frank 1977; Woolfolk and Richardson 1984). As conceptualized within this framework, psychologists are exposed to two quite dif- ferent social contexts: one (usually family and church) that encourages a religious under- standing of the human condition, and the other (usually undergraduate and graduate education) that promulgates a scientific and humanistic understanding of the human condi- tion. Given this dual exposure, psychologists are then faced with the challenge of reconciling these two very different ways of making sense of the world. This study suggests that this reconciliation often follows predictable patterns. NOTES This article is based on the master's thesis completed by Dyer P. Bilgrave under the direction of Robert H. Deluty. Portions of this article were presented at the annual meeting of the Eastern Psychological Association on March 30, 1996, in Philadelphia. The authors extend their appreciation to Drs. Leon H. Levy, Kenneth I. Maton, and Raymond H. Starr for their advice and guidance. 1 In a recent Gallup poll (The Gallup Organization, 1985), 95% of Americans reported believing in 'God or a Universal Spirit," 40% claimed a born-again experience, and 22% could be classified as Evangelical. In this study, 66% reported believing in 'God or a Universal Spirit,' 12% claimed a born-again experience, and 2% could be classified as Evangelical. 2 Although it is true that the humanistic and existential orientations stem from different traditions, hold dif- ferent assumptions about human nature, and make different assertions about psychotherapy, these two orientations</page><page sequence="19">RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND THERAPEUTIC ORIENTATIONS 347 in this study showed highly similar patterns of association with religious beliefs and so are discussed, for the most part, as a unit.

I believe in life after death. 2. I believe in heaven. 3. I believe in hell. 4. 1 believe in Satan. 5. I believe that God is love. 6. I believe that God is a giver of laws and standards of conduct. 7. I believe that we have used our God-given free will to turn away from God, disrupting our relationship with Him. Therefore, I believe that we have sinned. 8. I believe that we find salvation by truly believing in the redemptive power of God through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ; by joining the Church; and by striving to do God's will. 9. I believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God. 10. I believe that the Bible is the literal, infallible truth. 11. I believe it is important to encourage others to believe in Jesus Christ and to accept Him as their savior. 12. I believe that God has made a covenant with us: that as we love Him, keep faithful to Him, and keep His commandments, He will bless us and all those who come after us. 13. I believe that God is personally involved in the affairs of mankind and that history is the record of God's unfolding purpose for human beings. Scale 2: Eastern /Mysticism 1. I believe that some kind of ultimate reality is immanent in all things. Therefore, we may find this ultimate reality, if we are properly attuned, in all things: in other people, in nature, in works of art, or in the core of our- selves. 2. I believe our innermost selves and God to be one and the same. 3. I believe that we can experience God or the Universal Spirit directly through mystical experiences. 4. I believe that all phenomena are composed of the yin and the yang, the masculine and the feminine. We do best to allow these two qualities to find their appropriate balance, to come into their own harmony. 5. I believe in reincarnation. 6. I believe that life is sheer illusion and that, through the knowledge derived from contemplation, our individual souls can be reunited with the Universal Soul, with the All. 7. I believe that life is suffering, that suffering is caused by desire, and that the renunciation of desire can cause suffering to cease. Scale 3: Atheism /Agnosticism 1. I believe in God or a Universal Spirit. (Negatively scored) 2. I believe that God is not a physical being. Rather, He is more like a "mind" which can be characterized as very intelligent, all-knowing, loving, and very wise. He is like us, only much better. (Negatively scored) 3. I believe that God is utterly different and infinitely transcendent. Therefore, He is beyond all description, characterization, and comprehension. (Negatively scored) 4. I believe that there is a very high probability that God does not exist. Therefore, I assume that there is no God, and I live my life accordingly. 5. I do not believe in God or any other supernatural agents.</page></plain_text>
