<plain_text><page sequence="1">A LITTLE-KNOWN PLANET This is a fine book,1 the best of its kind I have seen. Its immediate aim is to point out some of the fascinating life all around. It does this in more detail and with more scientific authority than recent somewhat similar books; its appeal therefore is to biologists, as well as the in- terested layman; and its success is complete. A further goal is to suggest that the world is not anthropocentric nor are living things anthropomorphic. Living things are their own justification for being, regard- less of their utility or even their esthetic pleasingness to man. The study of living things, then, is a fine thing for its own sake, because they are interesting; and knowledge is worth acquiring, as Housman said (I think in his In- troductory Lecture), "not because it is useful or orna- mental, but because it is knowledge, and therefore good for a man to acquire." The author implies and elaborates these goals in the first and last chapters. In the other eleven chapters he convinces with examples from the teeming world of in- sects just outside our doors. Separate chapters are given to the Collembola and their important role as soil animals; to the high success of cockroaches; to the aquatic and aerial lives of dragon- and mayflies; to the cricket "as poet and pugilist"; to fireflies; to butterflies; and to just ' Evans, Howard Ensign. 1968.

Times renders permanently immature (a parable for our times, or Times) ; to the locust; to para- sitic wasps; and to a balanced view of SILENT SPRING. While Dr. Evans' accounts of these insects emphasize their importance to man, he also covers details of struc- ture, physiology, and especially behavior. There is much anecdotal material in the book, and much good informa- tion not found in the standard entomological texts. The writing is authoritative and, perhaps therefore, sometimes heavy. The humor is too often arch and pon- derous-the chapter titles, for example, are coy and sound as if written by a boy proud yet with eyes cast bashfully down. Nevertheless, the book is important and, unlike most important books, much worth the reading. As I write this, three men and some billions of dollars are moving up to circle the moon, a lifeless bit of stone about which almost everything is known. Throughout his book, and in its title, Dr. Evans makes mild mock of our hunger to gather any knowledge that is expensive. We will spend any number of billions to confirm that the moon is barren rock. But we will pay almost nothing, not even attention, to understand the mysteries by which we are surrounded. CARL W.
