<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sacramentum Mundi: An Encyclopedia of Theology, Vol. I, ed. by Karl Rahner, with Cornelius Ernst and Kevin Smyth. New York: Herder and Herder, 1968. x, 421 pp. $135.00 for the complete six volume set; $105.00 for prepublication subscription; $94.50 with advance payment?This is the first of six volumes, the last of which is scheduled for publication in late 1970. Altogether they will comprise "a comprehensive survey of central theological topics conducted by a group of writers in basic sympathy with each other, whose theological views have emerged from a serious and disciplined study of the relevant sources and from an awareness of the problems posed by life and thought in the modern world." The Encyclopedia is being published simultaneously in English, French, German, Dutch, Italian, and Spanish editions and it has been billed as an international project. In actual fact, a German, and particularly, Rahnerian point of view overwhelmingly predominates in this first volume. This may be all to the good but the statistics are nonetheless revealing. Each of the 120 articles and parts of articles (some of the more substantial articles, e.g., "Bible," "Church," "Christianity," are broken up among several different contributors) is signed, by one or more of a total of ninety different authors. But out of these ninety, fourteen contributors, (eleven of whom are German and clearly under Rahnerian influence), account for approximately 42 per cent of the writing. Rahner himself has authored eight articles or parts of articles and ninety-eight columns; i.e., approximately 12 per cent of the total space. In short, this first volume certainly reflects what Karl Rahner is thinking. Whether that is what Catholic theology as a whole is or ought to be thinking is, of course, another question altogether. The more significant articles include those on "Angel" (by Rahner, and evidently a subject dear to his heart); "Apocrypha" (by J. Michl, perhaps the best piece of "hard" scholarship in this volume); "Apologetics" (by J. B. Metz and Peter Henrici; Metz's contribution is first rate and breaks new ground); "Baptism" (by B. Neunheuser and G. Baum, with Baum's piece on "Baptism of Desire" being particularly imaginative in a short space); "Bible" (J. Schreiner, K. Berger, K. Rahner, K. Smyth, A. V?gtle, and I. Herman) and "Biblical Exegesis" (by J. Schmid, P. G. Duncker, S. M. Iglesias, and Henri Crouzel; Schmid on "Historical Survey" and Crouzel on "Spiritual Exegesis" are very well done); "Bishop" (by K. Berger, W. Beinert, J. L?cuyer and K. M?rs dorf) ; "Charity" (by R. Carpentier, W. Molinski, E. Reisch; Car pentier's contribution is particularly noteworthy); "Christianity" (by K. Rahner and W. Kasper); "Church" (by M.-J. le Guillou, K. Rahner, E. Sauras); "Church and State" (by Paul Mikat); "Church and World" (by K. Rahner); "Church History" (by A. Franzen) ; "Confirmation"</page><page sequence="2">146 STANLEY O. HOERR, JR., AND STAFF (by P. Fransen, very well done). Also deserving of mention are philosophical articles by J?rg Splett: "Agnosticism," "Analogy of Being," "Anthropomorphism," "Body," "Categories," "Concept," and "Consciousness." These articles are almost Leibnizian in their clarity and conciseness. They are written from a definite point of view, viz., transcendental Thomism strongly influenced by Heidegger; but they quite ably speak for themselves and their subject matter. The focus of most of the articles is on the current state of discussion in Catholic theology. The attempt to be up to date is reflected on almost every page, with numerous citations from the documents of Vatican II. (The "Birth Control" article, however, has the ill-fortune of being pre- Humanae Vitae.) No attempt has been made to render the articles definitive in terms of detail (especially historical detail) or scope (Protestant thinkers, e.g., Bultmann, are dealt with as foils more often than not). Thus the title Encyclopedia is somewhat misleading if it is meant to indicate that the present work is in the same genre as, say, the Hastings' Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics or the Dictionnaire de Th?ologie Catholique. Sacramentum Mundi is more like a con temporary Summa than a multi-dimensional and exhaustive encyclo pedia. ? E. A. R.</page></plain_text>
