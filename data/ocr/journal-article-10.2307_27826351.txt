<plain_text><page sequence="1">MECHANISM IN NEUROSIS By MARVIN WEINBERG New York City "I would advise you to set aside your therapeutic ambitions, and try to understand what is happening. When you have done that, therapeu tics will take care of itself/'?S. Freud, in a letter to J. H. W. van Op huijsen, freely translated, and quoted by permission. IN 1948, N. Wiener, the mathematician, proposed a word, cybernetics, to denote the broad philosophical principles underlying the handling and use of signal, whether by mechanical devices or by living organisms. Long before that time, students of such diverse fields as engineering and psychiatry had learned to examine and share one another's approach and equipment, to great mutual interest and advantage. Such a tendency, appearing usually within limited circles, has acquired various names, from philosophy to cybernetics, and those so tending have been desig nated, with different degrees of charity, as dilettantes or as scientific generalists. The willingness to appraise and perhaps adopt some of the concepts and intellectual devices current in a distant field of study is un usual. However, there is no demonstrable biologic limitation upon the biologist whereby he is unable to gain instruction from a physicist, and, conversely, there is no organic mystery so profound that the engineer cannot be as well acquainted with it as the biologist?since, at all events, the one is no more likely to resolve it than the other. Of all students, the biologist is the farthest behind, chiefly because of the stubbornness and inaccessibility of his material. He is therefore the one most likely to be surprised and aided by peculiarities of thought which have developed about more maiiipulatable material. There is a fearsome aspect about any remote discipline. It seems less trouble to be complacent, to doubt there is anything of much use in the other field, to complain of lack of time, or point to one's preponderant gifts, as if the mathematical and biological intellects appeared in separate species. When anyone transgresses his own boundaries, either he is scorned for the incomprehensible object he has brought back, or, worse, the prize happens to become fashionable and is pressed into widespread disservice, for years being injected into learned writings and obstructing thought, or fascinating experimenters until innumerable careers have been dissipated in some cul-de-sac. Somewhere between hysteria and apathy there ought to be a region of adventurous interest. Orientation The living organism is viewed as a device for performing a certain function. The distinctive function of an organism is to live. At any level of evolution, the organism has the task of deriving the energy to support its operations, and of translating this energy into out ward performance of some sort. For these purposes it is equipped with a variety of coordinated systems, whether contained within the limits of a 74</page><page sequence="2">Mechanism in Neurosis 75 single cell or assigned to specially organized tissues and organs. But, in addition, the organism is concerned with obtaining and utilizing signal, by which is meant the entire body of information secured from the en vironment, and from the interior precincts of the organism itself, as well as that transmitted to its effector structures. For this purpose it has, above a certain level, a nervous system. Given a device the distinctive function of which is known, and an equipment dealing with signal in such a way as to discharge this function, the methods of treating signal and the general structure and operating characteristics of the equipment can be formulated. This can be done for any device which is to be designed : it is the task of the designer. But it can also be done for devices of such high order as to be beyond access of present-day technology. We are here concerned with two high-order devices which utilize signal, one being the human central nervous system, and the other a re markable object conceived by man and known as a chess-player. A num ber of analogous functions can be discerned in the two. The chess-player can perform its proper work; in a form to be explained, it can learn to per form its work; it exhibits behavior; and, by reason of its operating charac teristics, it can, under the conditions assigned, develop a neurosis. It therefore serves as an object of study, and its analogies to nervous func tion are here examined. From these analogies, and the points at which they fail, some observations can be made regarding the human nervous system. Certain efforts are not made in the present writing. Wiener has given extended con sideration to nervous function, and has devised semianimate "models" by way of il lustrating what are conceived to be some mathematical principles underlying nervous activity. Unfortunately the examples of nervous function tendered him, and their mathematical aspects, have given rise to strange objects of study indeed. Sigmund Freud used, for analyzing wit and humor, a body of material which is neither witty nor humorous; and Wiener, in turn, has gone far with material of a certain kind, al though it is evident that more cogent material can be found. The clinical aspects of neurological function, for example, readily suggest circuit arrangements akin to those used in the design of computing and predicting machines. Conversely, the designers of advanced mechanisms are aware that their operational character increasingly suggests that of a thinking organism.1 However, superficial resemblances are seized upon, and important similarities are neglected. The designer who finds erratic behav ior in a computing machine because of dirty contacts or a burned-out tube or a stick ing shaft is likely to say that his machine is becoming "neurotic"?because he thinks of this as a synonym for "erratic," and because he overestimates the probability of trifling mechanical defects (such as those) in a species that has persisted on this planet. For another example, the labored resemblance between arrays of elements (photo-cells, oscillators, etc.) and histological sections from the brain is too gravety pondered. This is to examine in too fine detail, since histology can reveal only the most general sort of functional interconnections, but it can also be made to show nearly any specified relation among structures. An apology is customary when offering a machine analogue for an organic system. The fact is that defects of the analogy ought to be instructive, rather than detri 1 The story goes that one evening an engineer, telephoning his laboratory, where appallingly advanced equipment was being developed, was told: "There's nobody here but us complicated electronic devices."</page><page sequence="3">76 American Scientist mental. That functions have to be given mystical terms like "thought," "imagination," "synthesis of experience," etc., is acknowledgment that an explanation is not really being attempted; for no literary art can compensate for the absence of a workable con cept. Regardless of temporary deficiencies of detailed knowledge, unless one is pre pared to view the nervous system as a working mechanism, there is no prospect of comprehending it at all. It is not of great consequence whether the present explanation of the chess-player, or of the nervous system, yields a complete and satisfying view. It is only attempted to draw certain outlines that might suggest how the thing works. The details, in the case of the chess-player, become a massive problem of design, whereas in the case of the nervous system, they are largely unknown. Granting these inconveniences, there should be no insuperable difficulty in examining the broad plan. The brain, it is agreed by many, is the organ that "thinks." Now, al though all our information about "thoughts" is finally of introspective origin?not even the electroencephalograph having ever portrayed one2?there is some recognition of the form in which signal traverses the nervous system, i.e., the "nerve impulse," and it is not perilous to assume that any performance of the system, however complex, consists only of certain transactions carried on with such signal. That is to say, we contemplate a traffic of signal to and from the brain, and we suppose that something is being done centrally with that signal? it is being combined, condensed, organized, stored, or whatever?which will account for anything we find the system doing. A certain point will not be specified at which the signal or its medium suddenly assumes an unfathomable or mystical quality; if a strikingly different character evolves, it is due to the extensive treatment, the numerous successive steps, applied to quite "ordinary" signal. Then, it is suggested, if the character of the steps can be sufficiently well discerned, either by com parison with simpler processes or by clues obtained from disturbances of function, it is a mechanism which has been described. Afferent signal, whether it originates in environmental stimuli or the large and vague splanchnic area, whether it is set off by incident light, sound, aromatic esters, or the momentary concentration of pyruvate in the blood, is converted into the form of the nerve impulse, which is the currency of the nervous system. This signal moves forward; it is con ducted somewhere. The history of much of it may be brief : it traverses a few neurons only, and is applied to an effector apparatus making a necessary mechanical or chemical adjustment at some low (i.e., im mediate) level. Some signal proceeds to higher levels and is utilized for those more elaborate kinds of performance which necessitate the use, at 2 This is a humorous observation. The EEG evidently records a massive periodic discharge, centrifugally from thalamus to cortex, and presumably also a returning fire on the motor side. One should have expected white noise rather than a distinctive wave-form, but the large neuronal population reporting to the cerebral cortex is evi dently synchronous, to a small extent, as might be expected of highly similar cells car rying on identical activity. As to the chance of distinguishing "a thought" in the EEG, this may be likened to recognizing the composition of the Elks' Club from the rum bling of a distant train.</page><page sequence="4">Mechanism in Neurosis 77 the same time, of signal entering from diverse sensory areas. And a small proportion of incident signal must be dealt with at the highest level of in tegration, broadly, the cerebral cortex. It is this signal that is of principal interest here. As it arrives, it is the composite of the excitation of a very great num ber of peripheral neurons?for example, at the retina?each excited in a different way and to a different degree, so that a detailed study of the signal would require weeks of effort, before what was seen could be satis factorily interpreted for its significance to the individual, if it were not for the fact that previous experience of (visual) signal has enabled the cortex to extract from the present experience all that is significant in a rapid, automatic process. A proposal for the technique employed is that any peripheral excitation is written into a combination of neurons, or, as we shall say, it is coded, and that the separate features of a familiar experi ence acquire, in addition to the code fully stated, a much abbreviated form to be known as a report, which alone need go forward, as long as it is the correct abbreviation for so much of the experience. The number of re ports must then be one or more orders lower than the number of indi vidual peripheral elements, and, in turn, a combination of reports con stitutes a code of even more condensed kind. The codes not only of visual but also of auditory, cutaneous, etc., sensibility, having usually been combined in the course of ordinary experience, the composite signal ob tained from the most varied array of sensory excitation must still reach a fairly concise expression. It will be proposed that efferent (motor) signal assumes the opposite organization, where an exceedingly concise signal initiates the action, but is at once expanded to &amp; formula for the details, not only of the action as it might be thought of, but also of a great number of preparatory and supporting actions that ordinarily are carried out entirely without notice. Further expansions, through collaborating motor systems, bring into activity an unthinkably large number of muscle fibers, nicely graded, emphasized, and antagonized, the number being comparable with the number of sensory elements involved in usual experience. At the "point" in the central nervous system where afferent and efferent signal has its most concise expression, or at the "highest level"? these are comfortable terms, although the neighborhood involved is prob ably much too diffuse to be shown anatomically as a "point," and "level" may have almost any significance?we should place "the little man" in side the nervous system. It is he who receives the ultimately condensed reports and issues the motor formulae. Available to him is a file, or storage area, to which he transfers brief representations of sensory and motor signal, and from which he elicits them at any time. But the organ ism is not wholly at the mercy of environmental stimulation, nor given to random motor activity, so that it is evident the little man does not exist merely to translate sensation into activity. Neither does he hand the re spective kinds of signal back and forth to and from the storage area, seeing and hearing today in order to have remembered tomorrow, and initiating impromptu performances learned at times past. The organism</page><page sequence="5">78 American Scientist requires that he make a definite kind of use of these facilities in order to seek certain desirable ends; only rarely can he proceed in a random fashion, or according to a "free will." The bulk of activity is stringently governed by directions contained in the plan of central nervous connec tions peculiar to the species. The little man is aware of the sensory signal reaching him, and of the extension in space of the organism of which he is a part, i.e., himself; but in addition, he is aware that he is aware of signal. This awareness of awareness, or second-order information, embraces only a minute portion of the total volume of signal handled by the little man. There are even unusual precautions against admitting some data, when they have been stored, into this kind of information. But the small sampling which is included is misapprehended as typical, and gives rise to a widespread belief that one hears oneself think, i.e., one is conscious (of one's think ing) . Though this be but little, much is made of it, since it is the entire ex tent of information that can ordinarily be secured about the subject of chief interest. Admitting a great simplification, it is proposed to examine the be havior of the organism as it is influenced by the single requirement of sur vival. This is chosen as the distinctive function about which to suppose the design of the nervous system has been calculated. The Chess-Player Shannon has invented a machine with the distinctive function to play chess games, and to win. It is a nonliving mechanism; its aff?rents are con cerned with the position of men on a chessboard, and its efferente move the men from one position to another. Its central connections, and its en tire behavior, are centered upon the objective of winning games. The ways in which the machine deals with this apparently limited environ ment, on the receptor and the effector sides, are simple enough me chanically; but its internal workings are those of a computing machine of high order. The fact that the chess-player has not actually been constructed and its workings demonstrated is not material at present; there is no important separation between a sound design and the working mechanism, except for time and expense, as designers know. But the "real" existence of the chess-player appears to suggest that authentic analogues of the nervous system are within reach of present-day technology, and this is an unfortunate illusion. Circuit elements are of enormous size and weight, they re quire prodigious energy, and they are not plastic. It would be unrewarding to assemble an analogue using relays that cannot acquire additional contacts as they are needed, circuits which treat the same signal no differently the first or thousandth time it passes, and programs that must be explicit from the first day. As the chess-player il lustrates, some of these handicaps can be overcome within a few millenia of operation^ and simpler circuits are discussed, nowadays, which exhibit a semblance of "learn ing"; but under these limitations, inorganic models do poor justice to the nervous sys tem. While many persons do not regard the game of chess as likely to be amenable to any system of straightforward computation, and would not find enjoyable a method of play based on it, the assumption is made that</page><page sequence="6">Mechanism in Neurosis 79 the game can be played in this way. The ultimate correctness of the as sumption has no importance. Now, even the human chess-player consciously assigns certain values to the several chessmen. The value of the queen, which controls a large part of the board in eight possible directions, is maximal; that of a pawn, with its limited mobility and range, is minimal; and so on. Suppose the values peculiar to the several pieces to be fixed and assigned in a certain way, and then modified in the light of the game situation, so that a rook in the open will have greater value than one hedged in by pawns and knights, etc. The aggregate of values so determined will express the goodness of the position at any time, or its worth to one side. This will take account of all that is good about one's own men, less the opponent's values computed in the same way, and, allowing for contingencies (such as a check), the im mediate worth should indicate in a general way how well the forces are being utilized. As the game advances, the worth assumes a series of values, positive or negative, and might increase if events are especially favorable. (By reason of the ingenious lambda function, the sign merely changes when computing for the opponent?making the chess-player more predatory than man himself.) Now, it is true that a clever check mate might depend on a succession of apparent catastrophes, in fact in vites them, and that in some other ways the worths might prove erratic for purposes of prediction. But if the computation is done for almost every choice of move and reply, the comparison of worths does suggest in a valid way which move is best : if the future cannot be predicted, at least a great number of immediate possibilities can be appraised. If, for example, at a certain instant, the chess-player has a choice of 20 moves, and to each of these the opponent can reply in any of 20 ways, the computation of only 400 worths enables the chess-player to reach the best possible situation a full move later; of 160,000 worths for two full moves later; and so forth, into a not very distant future. Shannon him self is inclined to be appalled at the way the effort grows, and would drop out unpromising lines as early as possible, while compulsory moves (such as replying to a check) command attention exclusively, so that in fact not all the computations need be made. As far ahead as the chess-player can reasonably go, the best result found is apparently the direction to pur sue. While the lifetime of a man would not suffice for more than a few moves, selected in this way, a computing machine could form its decision within a "legal" time. It is not an attractive game, perhaps, and the play lacks imagination; but there is no likelihood of overlooking anything, and with judicious short-cuts the chess-player could undoubtedly see as far ahead as the average human player. Depending on the appropriate ness of values assigned to the pieces, and various subtleties of "thought" built into the design, the machine would play chess of a certain quality, not greater nor less. The learning chess-player. Such a machine would undergo a certain ex perience in playing chess, and in this experience it would be found that</page><page sequence="7">80 American Scientist some particulars of the design could be improved. It is difficult, but not important, to say what these might be: perhaps the discrepancy between the values of knight and bishop was made too large, or too small; or some factor was needed to express the unusual worth of a discovered check; or whatever. Improvements should be anticipated. The designer would study the performance with great interest to determine what these ought to be. But the chess-player itself could be arranged to do that : to make use of its own experience, and thus learn to play better chess. The necessary provision would be an additional program3 which, at the close of a game, book the result into consideration and directed an examination of the play to see where an improvement had been possible. Circuit-wise, this Tfieans that the fact of winning or losing is impressed upon the machine as a signal, and that the whole record of play (including computation) is preserved for study. The study might take a number of forms, as defined in the program: for example, to ascertain whether the successive worths as computed truly represented the course of the game (particularly if it was unfavorable), or, if they did not, whether the trends, at least, did; to determine whether a different set of values might have represented the situation more correctly, and, if not, to modify the basic values, one at a time, in any order (or in no order), until the resulting worths revealed how and when the game was lost, and perhaps thereafter adopt the newer values. Having done these or other things to improve its faculties, the chess-player would be ready to play the next game differently, presum ably better. Thus the chess-player is a machine of high order initially, equipped to make a certain range of changes in its basic adjustments, depending on its experience in carrying out its distinctive function: a machine that executes its own critique, and continually modifies its behavior toward better performance of its function. But it had been equally possible to equip the chess-player with a blank set of values, so that its first task was to evolve a correct set. It might require a billion efforts to play chess before it completed this task and arrived at a semblance of a game, but after that its game might be exceedingly competent, and still improving. Finally, the machine might be started upon its career without values and without even a program, other than a "general" program to operate and seek to win games, so that its first task now would be to arrive at some method of operation, relying on nothing more than that the "game won" signal was desirable, and the "game lost" signal was not. It can hardly be estimated how long a time, how many abortive games, would be needed to reach an opera tional level from such a start; it is only clear that the quantities are finite. Given sufficient equipment, the chess-player would thus be able to 3 The program, in a computing machine, is the provision for recognizing the com pletion of a step, directing what is to be done with the result, readying equipment for the next step, directing reference to required data, setting the next process in motion, etc.</page><page sequence="8">Mechanism in Neurosis 81 generate a satisfactory chess-player through its own workings, without adjustment except as it saw fit to adjust itself, and without help from any "thinking" agency after the instant it was set in motion. It would exemplify a feeding-back of experience toward the better accomplish ment of specified function?even though the experience had so narrow a character as win-or-lose, and the function was the singular one of winning chess games. Some improvements. The usefulness of a recorded experience, for re viewing the game just past, tempts one to install an expanded memory having a detailed portion for the recent game and a comprehensive part for all past games. Perhaps much of the computation can be avoided if the identical situation has occurred in the past, and the outcome, of course, is known. Either the designer might think of it, or the chess player itself during its learning might have recourse to such remembered information. If the immediate result is favorable, it will place increasing reliance on memory, and if memory can substitute to an extent for com putation the machine is able to go farther ahead than ever?unquestion ably an improvement. Suppose a situation develops where two bishops are side by side, as at KB4: and at KKtk. The memory shows this circumstance in 16 out of 1045 games, where all 16 games were won. The chess-player makes (or has previously made) the assumption that what it remembers is appli cable to what is happening now. Circuit-wise, this means that the fact that a game was won (as the memory shows) confers a certain positive worth upon the several features of that game, and any situation which offers now, being found identical with such a remembered one, acquires that worth. Thus the combination of bishops can be recognized as advanta geous per se, apart from the results of computation, which might not even show that. There are interesting consequences. The behavior of the chess-player is less predictable, less "machine-like," because it utilizes an experience which is continuously expanding. Its response to an immediate situation may not conform at all to the calculable possibilities; it may know other grounds for a good (or bad) expectation. And in addition, it now has two different ways of forming a decision that may yield different choices. In order that no determination shall be ambiguous, an additional "im provement" can be introduced. This consists of a rule that, since the pur pose of all play is to win, no move may be made which contains any pos sibility of losing. Circuit-wise, this requires an indexing, or biasing, of all experience according to the likelihood of a poor outcome. Let us say that any position occurring in a lost game is negatively biased. As an addi tional precaution, the negative bias is made emphatic : it is fed-back, or regenerative, whereas nothing is done to emphasize positive bias?no state of affairs can be excessively good. For the benefit of spectators, a negative bias might be accompanied by a display of warning lights on the panel, an advance in operating volt ages as indicated by meters, and other manifestations of dismay and anxiety; a positive bias might be displayed in the opposite fashion, so</page><page sequence="9">82 American Scientist that whatever prospect the machine encounters, attractive or cata strophic, in its recollections and even during its computing, its "reaction" is visible. More serious than these outward manifestations is the influence of bias on the operations of the chess-player. Imposing with sufficient em phasis the rule, One must not lose, one has the chess-player reacting in nonlinear fashion, responding excessively to negative worths and never reaching a corresponding equanimity for positive worths. The pursuit of winning is made relentless. Even a slight possibility of untoward outcome must now prejudice the machine toward some other choice. The result may not be an improvement, after all, for the best opportunity might have to be neglected?and if only an optimal design of chess-player were here in question, this biasing method might be objectionable. How can the machine recognize "a slight possibility" of untoward out come? In reviewing its memory for a recorded game situation identical with any now being considered, it is apparent that, in general, it can find none, because the probability that any one situation will recur, except in the early game, is excessively small. Before long the machine concludes that nothing is accomplished by reviewing its memory for an identical situation. Among its eventual changes of program, it decides to admit any situation which is identical except for one detail, and, later, some other details; it widens the tolerance, and admits isolated configurations, or arrangements of men differing by a change of one square in any direc tion, etc. (Various methods of coding organic chemical compounds, which exceed in number the published reports, illustrate usual ways of in creasing the latitude. To demand precisely the desired reference from the files may bring nothing; but to neglect the last term in the code, then the last two.. .terms, will yield an increasing number of less closely related references.) But the chess-player must soon find that, with enough lati tude, it evokes practically every datum in its memory, and this, too, is of little use. It proves economical to stop searching after a certain part, say 5 or 10 per cent, of the data receives study. Thus the organization of per manent memory in the chess-player might be positional, with crucial pieces described first and incidental matters relegated to the part of the code which can be dropped out to broaden a search; and some rule of practice will dictate how far this process can go. Then "a slight possibility" corresponds to an untoward situation that somewhat resembles the one in question. But now a great many situations, including bad ones, can be found to meet this description, and the chess player might readily conclude that the presenting situation is largely un favorable. Owing to bias, it finds it altogether repugnant?not only the position, but also its memories of situations even remotely similar. The behavior of the chess-player is now quite different. The offered situation having at KB4: and at KKtk seemed favorable (16/16 games won) ; but a like situation with at KB? and at K4 appears in 5 games, of which 4 were lost, with at KB3 and at KKtS in 11 games, of which 7 were lost, and numerous others, making a total of 71 games, 29 of which were lost. As a simple probability, the two bishops side by</page><page sequence="10">Mechanism in Neurosis 83 side ought to seem fairly neutral (0.59 chance of winning), but to the biased chess-player, able to see only 29 lost games, the outlook is ap palling, and further inquiry along this line is dropped. Owing to easy prejudice and quick dismay, the chess-player is much less competent than before; yet these features were introduced as undoubted improve ments comparable with those used by the living organism. Neurosis in the chess-player. That bias is described as either positive or negative, along a single axis, is admission that the chess-player is not ex pected to show a full semblance of anthropomorphic emotion, but this is, for it, a system of emotions. Appropriate somatic responses have also been described to conform to these emotions, and seem to hint at an effort to improve the general efficiency when things are desperate, al though they are inadequate for the purpose?the better to resemble human operations. Since the machine has not been equipped to have awareness of itself or its activities, it has no idea that it is experiencing emotions, and since the universe does not contain a second chess-player, it could not communicate them if it had, so that its emotions have no social meaning. But they have operational meaning: bias is an attribute which the machine relates to its data and which influences the manner in which the data are used. From the operational standpoint, its bias de fines a cogent system of emotions. Owing to nonlinear bias, the chess-player may operate in a manner not nearly appropriate to the presenting situation; i.e., emotionally. But its reactions are still purely situational, and not neurotic. It is neurotic, however, when its operations are disturbed (as by the exclusion of valid moves) often, or as a rule, or in respect to certain events in the game consistently. It is neurotic when the bias attached to remem bered data is permitted to implicate other data less and less nearly re lated, and finally to attach to a sector of the memory so that its content cannot be effectively used. If a large group of moves, otherwise worth while, is rejected because of resemblance to situations marked by nega tive bias, and in consequence only limited and ineffectual moves can be made, then the function of the machine is surely impaired. Within fair limits, the same terms afford a clinical definition of neurosis. Conceivably, the chess-player might develop some ingenious methods of play?by exclusion, of course, since it can arrive at a method only by selecting it from among all possibilities, including simpler, more useful ones. If the selection was forced by neurotic behavior, its achievement is not altogether praiseworthy, since the effort had been excessive; and the achievement is itself characteristically neurotic. Thus the requisites for neurotic behavior in the chess-player are: (1) multiple bases for a determination, such as computation vs. memory; (2) systematic emphasis upon data of a certain kind, however secured, favor able to one result, and an opposite emphasis upon opposite data which is exaggerated, overemphasized, so that it influences broad groups of data which are not entirely (or not at all) relevant?owing to : (3) a faculty for association of data, so that when one thing is sought, a thing related is found, until the treatment of the immediate problem is no longer strictly</page><page sequence="11">84 American Scientist appropriate, but is much affected by what appears pertinent and im portant in prior experience, although it may be neither. Comparing the living organism, the chess-player is rather austere: (1) the living organ ism has many more bases, such as instinctual values, values contrived of dreams and fantasies, values imposed by instruction and example; (2) the living organism has multiaxial bias, rather than an influence so singular as positive and negative; and (3) the faculty for association exists in the living organism, while for the chess-player it had to be simulated by a scheme of widening cross reference. None of these diffi culties is fundamental. Design Considerations In either the inorganic or the organic device certain principles of design can be distinguished that define the problem in the other; other features are peculiar to only one device. The question of design, simply stated, is: This is the function to be carried out; how best (or most simply) can it be done? In any device, the most reliable and economical provision is likely to be distinguished by a profound simplicity, although this might be ob scured by the presence of a large number of elements of a kind, and, in the organic form, by a roundabout evolutionary history. It is probably erroneous to anticipate something complex, as one's suppositions tend to become when the problem is baffling; a quite simple provision, albeit ex traordinarily subtle, is the better design, and therefore the one to be looked for in the living organism. Coding. The chess-player has no concern with the carved shapes or the names of king, queen, and pawn, but it must be able to deal with these elements, recognize which they are, and where they are, and attribute to them the arbitrary customs of movement which form the mechanics of the game. This information must be translated continuously into a form which the chess-player can utilize. The process is known as coding. Whatever interior arrangements the machine may have, they must be gin with elements in which this information can be written. The elements must be relatively simple, but, because the information is intricate, they will have to be rather numerous. They may be relays, which at a given instant may be open or closed, or regions of a magnetic tape, bearing sig nal or not, or a number of other convenient forms all implying an alterna tive such as open/closed, inactive/active, or yes/no. These elements, whatever they may be, are binaries; the number of possible modes is two. A sufficiently large group can contain any specified number of dif ferent expressions, or codes. The information about the chessboard now becomes a form of signal that can be utilized for the internal processes of the chess-player. If it is concerned with the rook, which it knows as +0 + + + + 0, it draws upon its file of moves legal to a +0+ + + +0 occupying the position 000+/ 000+ and will ascertain that none exists, owing to the presence of +000++ + at 000+/00+0 and of +00+ + + + at 00+0/000+, a conclusion that might be reached in a few microseconds. The fact of the rook has been transduced to the code in use.</page><page sequence="12">Mechanism in Neurosis 85 Likewise, a given pattern of illumination falling upon the human ret ina is not utilized as electromagnetic energy, or light, when it proceeds along the optic tract; it is first transduced to a form of signal called a nerve impulse. There is no reason to suppose that this form of signal differs materially from that due to auditory stimulation or that due to pressure-excitation of a cutaneous nerve-ending. It is not light, sound, or pressure which is conveyed along the cranial nerves or dorsal columns; it is the arbitrary form of signal adopted for use in the interior of the device. This signal proceeds centrally, often through a succession of in terpolated elements (neurons), and finally is written into a group of neurons probably in the cerebral cortex itself, in what may be called a one-for-one representation of the peripherally excited cells. This is to say, nothing has yet been done toward organization or "interpretation" of the signal; it has only been written into an array of elements, or coded. (Literally, the ratio may be different from one-for-one: some 10 neurons are said to code the data from a single retinal cone.) The method used for coding is, of course, unknown; nor should one be impressed by the reliance, in inorganic designs, upon binaries. On the contrary, in view of the incomparable sensitivity of the dark-adapted eye, or its colossal dynamic range, or the flawless engineering of the femoral trabeculations, one is obliged to suspect that the living organism resorts to the method affording ultimate efficiency and economy, which is, in the case of elements for coding information, ternary rather than binary.4 Its form may be as simple, in fact, as: +, stimulate; ?, inhibit; 0, no effect. Its possibilities are impressive: if 10 neurons are at work, 310 signals can be stored, or 58,000 unique features can be represented in any desired way. If the work could be done as simply as this, 10 neurons could store a vocabulary. At the far side of the central processes, the chess-player is equipped to displace the carved figures on the board, and the man to contract cer tain muscles; at this point the performance is translated from the signal field of nerve impulses, relays, tapes, punched cards, and circuit voltages, and returns to a form bearing upon the environment. But between these limits, all transactions had been carried out in that form of signal used in the interior of the device, and neither the form nor the combinations of separate elements to express codes for external data need have any rela tion to the data themselves, except as the device chooses to relate them. Thus, the chess-player might have installed, or adopted, such a code as mentioned in the example; but any other code might have been used. Likewise, the old philosophical question of what two persons actually understand by "face," or by "red," cannot be resolved by discovering the codes represented in corresponding groups of neurons, or perhaps even in neurons in the same anatomical neighborhood, in the two subjects. The number and choice of cells are purely arbitrary, and depend on the pre cise order and intensity with which environmental signal was received 4 This proposition, tendered the writer by mathematicians, finds no mathematician willing to assume responsibility for it.</page><page sequence="13">86 American Scientist during the learning process, the neurons which happened to be available for code-writing, etc. To each individual, the contents of any other in dividual's cerebral cortex must have a totally inaccessible, purely ar bitrary form. This may be a sorry blow to serious or frivolous proponents of telepathy, for even if a medium for such communication could be dem onstrated, its content must necessarily be gibberish. Aphasia demonstrates clinically the reliance upon coding. Signal ar rives normally, is properly attended to, and sets off all the customary auxiliary adjustments (such as the optical details, position of the head and neck, posture), but there is a disorder of the coding equipment, and the patient is bewildered and exasperated to find, for example, that his morning Times has been printed in what is evidently Chinese, or some other language unfamiliar to him. His eyes may read the lines perfectly, but he gets no "sense" out of the information. Similarly, in motor apha sia, he may have a clear idea of what he means to say, and the apparatus for speech be intact, but what comes out is an incomprehensible m?lange of words?unless he writes his message. The fact that coding (and decoding) is carried on faultlessly through out a lifetime suggests exceptional provision of equipment. Consider the 10 neurons mentioned, and suppose a ternary base (+, ?, 0) in use. The following codes might be expressed, among the 58,000 which are possible : + + H-000 + dominant seventh chord + + H-0000 sister Agnes' pronunciation of "ah" + + H-000 ? noon whistle + + H-00++ resolution of dominant seventh + + H-00+0 Mrs. Jackson's "ah" + + H-00 H? tires braked on pavement + + H-00 ?h oboe, by its timbre + -00-0 the word "are" + + -I-00-squeaking door and so forth, to a total of 58,000 unique codes. Now, if neuron No. 9 in the array of 10 should fail, the resulting incomprehension or misinter pretation of signal must be devastating. Yet occasional failure of one ele ment in 10 is not unexpected among inorganic species. It must be con cluded either that the central nervous system is incredibly rugged, or that the number of neurons actually devoted to the coding process is so large that a reasonable incidence of failure is insufficient to disturb the process, and only an extensive lesion (as in aphasia) can derange it at all. It has recently been suggested that since the structure of a single protein molecule makes available many permutations, this would offer a most compact basis for coding in the nervous sytem. That neuronal cytoplasm is highly proteinaceous seems to com mend the proposal. But on reflection, the proposal is excessively good, for the nervous system could then be reduced to one or two cells and still contain encyclopedic data without beginning to exhaust the codes available. Since neurons are numbered in bil lions, it is safe to assume the coding element is the cell, rather than the molecule. A more serious defect is that such an idea treats the cellular proteins as idle material, and material freely subject to chemical rearrangement, whereas in fact the molecules</page><page sequence="14">Mechanism in Neurosis 87 are enormously occupied and stringently disposed; to impose further the task of code writing is to suggest insuperably difficult design. There is no doubt that protein-like molecules ptore elaborate codes in the organism: replicated in very large number, these make up the gene, and are the coding elements for heredity. Each cell of the organism is furnished with the full set, or at least with a sample set which it multiplies to quota, which dictates explicitly the form and func tion to be assumed by the cell, even though these are entirely different in each precinct of the organism?a remarkable system of coding. Perhaps not more than one element is responsible for the diversified congenital defects of the Turner syndrome,5 for example, so constituting a genie aphasia! It remains to be discovered how this nuclear material dictates the organization of cytoplasmic protein, i.e., how the information is recovered from the gene. And since every engineering detail of the organism reveals marvelous adjustment to the load, whether in the cross section of the erythrocyte or that of the bronchi, it also remains to be shown how information regarding the load is continuously entered into this code array: The block diagram. When vacuum tubes were new, a designer usually specified in full the connections of a circuit to the respective tube ele ments in order to make clear the expected mode of operation; but now that tubes have been employed for years in widely understood ways, it is sufficient to write a simple block diagram. Thus, an amplifier may be shown : -&gt; [AMP] -&gt; Another legend might be used to signify that an oscillator, a digital ar ray, a memory, or whatever, was interposed at this point, The details can be taken for granted, or perhaps they must be shown elsewhere, but they do not intrude to confuse what is the essential idea of the design. A block diagram for central nervous functions differs mainly in that the details are not available. The relation between ventral horn group and muscle (i.e., between lower motor neurons and their respective muscle fibers) can be written [LMN] ? [M] expressing fully that it is the lower motor neuron that excites the muscle fiber. Even such a detail as the arrow needs to be studied, for there are no copper wires that can be assumed in this system : both the propagation of the nerve impulse and its mode of firing the contraction mechanism have yet to be explained; but the diagram is valid notwithstanding. This must be stated, not to say labored, lest we forego any likely dia grams owing to want of confidence in the details. Thus, one can write for the simple tendon "reflexes" (which are not reflex at all, as they excite an open system, even though other pathways may close it) : [S] [SGC] -+ IN] [LMN] -+ [M] where S = a sensory ending transducing the sudden change in tendon 6 Turner's syndrome includes ovarian agenesis, short stature, a "webbing" or no table shortness of the neck, exaggeration of the carrying-angle at the elbow, ocular de fects, coarctation of the aorta, a "shield-like" configuration of the chest, and some other, inconstant features,</page><page sequence="15">88 American Scientist length owing to a blow of the reflex-hammer; SGC = a spinal ganglion cell, of which S is the receptor end; = an intercalated neuron or two; LMN = a lower motor neuron; M = a muscle fiber. Closing such a sys tem, with the addition of other spinal neurons, provides for the main tenance of normal muscle tone: r~ + [S]-+lSGC]-+[N]^[N]-+ I [N]-+\LMN]^[M]-1 I_I where, among the additional neurons, some are concerned with implicat ing functionally allied muscle of the-same or the opposite side, some with inhibiting antagonistic musculature, etc. A more complete diagram would include the upper motor neuron (corticospinal) connection, and the tracts of various high centers which regulate tone, posture, pre paratory and supporting movements, adjustments occasioned by equili bration, etc. To initiate any willful motor action is to set in operation all these ancillary regulatory nuclei, whereupon a vast number of detailed accom modations are rapidly, automatically made, with no other notice from the initiating level than a single key signal. The initiating signal is voluntary and familiar; we have a word for it?look, walk, say. But the number of muscle fibers actually called on to perform the act is inconceivably large; the simplest task would prove to be hopeless if they had to be supervised consciously. Thus one can readily imagine that the block diagram for motor function begins with a key signal at the highest level, expanded enormously and distributed to nuclei as a formula under which they de velop the immediate and ancillary patterns of action, and that these are issued, finally, via the spinal tracts, to the great number of lower motor neurons concerned. The arrangement of pyramidal and cerebellospinal and other extrapyramidal nuclei and tracts, portrayed in texts of neuro anatomy, can hardly be distinguished from conventional block diagrams for inorganic circuits. Unfortunately, the resemblance of block diagrams of the nervous system to those of electrical circuits intimates an electrical character of nervous function generally; and in fact one can hardly avoid seeing representations of "the nerve impulse" in cathode-ray tubes in these elaborate times. While, for the present discussion, it makes no difference what the nature of nerve excitation may be, one should not overlook the fact that it remains exceedingly ob scure. Electrical charges do appear, can be measured, and are associated with a release of certain cations (notably potassium) ; and these events are traced to the boundary (or "membrane") of the nerve fiber, which therefore is regarded as the very site of ex citation. The interior of the fiber maintains the process and, no doubt, serves as a framework that keeps the "membrane" from collapsing, as this would be unsightly. Almost all important therapeutic agents for influencing nerve function (morphine, atropine, etc.) are alkylamines, and the especially active, possibly native excitants (e.g., acetylcholine) are trimethylammonium compounds, which are cations active enough to displace another cation from protein and thus to produce an intense "elec trical" disturbance. Hence, as more is revealed of the intimate chemistry of nerve, we should expect to find that the mass of the fiber is actually at work and that a valence</page><page sequence="16">Mechanism in Neurosis 89 change in nitrogen is being exploited, but also that electrical events at the surface are adventitious. Since a correct view of the operational character of the nervous system must be equally valid even if the signal medium be hydraulic fluid travelling in a network of pipes, it does not matter which tail happens to be wagging the dog in modern physiol ogy. Association. The chess-player was endowed with a cross-reference system intended to imitate, crudely, the associative faculty of the nerv ous system. How far the imitation falls short, and for what reasons prin cipally, become evident from the problem of storing data for rapid and precise use. The problem is a vexing one in scientific work, where reference to the literature is never wholly satisfactory; it has attracted extended mathe matical consideration, and has been approached by apparatus terrifying to librarians. More recently there have been developed mechanical sys tems utilizing the principle that a search of the entire body of data will bring out the datum wanted, provided it has been coded under the same term used for the search. This essentially inept method is practical be cause of the high speed possible to machines, the condensation of ma terial on film, etc. Other methods, including many which have been privately invented by scientists for their own use, can be recognized as attempting to simulate the function of memory, or more particularly that of association. An example will show the nature of the problem. How can Jones' work with streptomycin, Am. J. Obst. Gyn. 280: 416, 1949, be best filed? An alphabet will provide for Jones, and for streptomycin, and when the paper has been carefully studied, it may prove advisable to make ref erence to it under tuberculosis, genitourinary, and under Salpingitis, tuberculous, as well as peritonitis, promizole, and Rubin test. This can be done by issuing references, notes, or abstracts, in multiple, so that a copy will appear under each term; competent librarians often show the data in one place, and make cross reference to that place from all the others that seem important. But an ideal treatment of all the pertinent subject matter proves to be quite out of reach. Should streptomycin follow Streptomyces, or should it appear among antibiotics? What should be done when its chemical structure is ascertained, to relate it functionally to the component amino acids (or whatever)? If an inquirer for Mycobacterium tuberculosis thinks of it as the tubercle bacillus, the Koch bacillus, or the acid-fast bacilli, where should he look? What should be done to the entries when Jones submits an erratum saying that the organism was of the bovine type? Filing methods are limited by a sort of dimensionality. One dimension is usually given by an alphabet, and often two alphabets (authors, sub jects) are used; the chemical literature lists patent numbers and empiric formulae, while biological systems even include taxonomy, geography, etc. These examples actually have an internal logic, and in some ar rangements a numerical code replaces "plain language" and so rein troduces the inherent logic of the subject matter. But even when syn</page><page sequence="17">90 American Scientist onyms are reduced, and the array is coherent, neither one nor several dimensions serve to file it without freely reduplicating the data, or mak ing a machine search of the entire library. The associative function of the cerebral cortex is unlike any of these provisions, and defies mechanical simulation, because it is multidimen sional. Practically any likely tag brings the inquirer to the datum wanted, directly and rapidly, and the further details are produced as they are wanted. "Green" elicits not only trees, traffic lights, dresses, paint, envy, and inexperience, but, in respect to trees, anything on file about specific trees and the habits of trees in general, detailed personal experience of trees, and all accompanying sentiments. The several codes can be interconnected on any conceivable basis, and the number of bases probably exceeds any suspicion. Some are evidently subtle, some tenu ous, as the poets know : even so evanescent a feature as instant can relate two codes lastingly though they bear no vital or logical connection?as the odor of hyacinth in a field, experienced at the same moment as a far away train whistle. An entire field of study has grown up about the so called conditioned reflex, a simple form of association of codes based on their occurrence in successive instants. If a type of neuron is specified as having an extremely large number of processes, and these processes are connected, even over some distance, with certain other neurons, then the latter become functionally related and the codes of which they form a part become interconnected in such a way that any or all of the codes can be elicited upon demand of any one of them. The design does not require so wide a distribution of this inter relating type as of pure coding cells, if the proportion is kept efficient. A single neuron serves the group; it operates as the address to any of these data, each of its "tags" eliciting a full code. Cells of this description abound in the cerebral cortex; but, of course, so do cells of virtually any other description, so this is not helpful. It seems unlikely that these multiple tags are set up as one learns; they ought rather to form the anatomical equipment for learning, being in stalled originally in the desired proportion, so that the process of learning is one of activating the tags or interconnections. By activation is implied establishing a frequent or routine transmission from one element to the next, a thing possible to plastic organic structure. Organization. The most primitive nervous systems are those in which one region of the organism is simply connected with another, through cells more irritable than the rest: afferent signal here becomes efferent signal elsewhere, or the distinction may not be obvious at all. Multiplied throughout the organism, this arrangement becomes the neural net, readily duplicated by inorganic equipment except for its plasticity. Plas ticity may be defined as that quality which is influenced by the passage of signal in such a way that the later passage of signal has other effect. Ordinarily one thinks of the change in treatment of signal as one of facili tation?the later signal passes more readily. But other changes are avail able, and if the consequences are adverse this fact may be fed back so that a different treatment is adopted. Imagining such a neural net set in</page><page sequence="18">Mechanism in Neurosis 91 operation, the passage of signal through it constitutes an experience that modifies the style of operation; the system is materially different follow ing any experience. In due time, if it prove advantageous to the beast and its progeny, certain afferent endings become efficient in transducing a given kind of stimulus (light, pressure), and the interconnections assume a degree of arrangement favoring the passage of signal in selected direc tions, as to an effector system of some sort. A relative efficiency might re sult; but the limitations upon a neural net are apparent. As long as any region has a single afferent channel, using a single modality of signal, only the crudest addition or combination of signals is possible, feed-back is wanting because there is no pathway to carry it, and efferent signal can be graded in only a rudimentary way. This is to say that there is a severe topologie limitation : the performance of a group of elements singly inter connected in a random manner, or even in a specified manner, cannot reach a high order. Adding multiple channels, and interposing nuclei for combination and redistribution of signal, with the tracts necessary to interconnect them, one has a modest central nervous system, limited but more prom ising, and not unlike an automatic telephone exchange in its ability to separate signal of different origins and to produce relatively precise re sults of a rudimentary kind. The economy of having the nuclei aggregated within a definite struc tural region is evident, when the interconnections are much more numer ous than the peripheral channels, and this region is the best one in which to locate special organs delivering elaborate signal over many channels. Depending on the point of view, the head should be placed as close as pos sible to the central nervous system, or vice versa. A large body of responsive activity is possible to organisms not yet equipped with a cerebral cortex, or experimentally deprived of it; it is seen that even the combination of an afferent and an efferent element "works" in demonstrable fashion ("reflex arc"), and the pathways available through the spinal cord alone furnish a remarkable degree of organiza tion. A large population of neurons is responsible for this; the intermedi ate cells placed in long pathways are not merely terminal blocks, but have important operational character. (A neuron is an expensive element; the occurrence of very long nerve fibers shows that cells are not inter posed for simple relaying, in order to cover a distance.) They are so placed for taking off signal for local use, even while the main body of sig nal passes farther on for its proper treatment. Take-offs are well shown in the optic pathway. Visual signal is continuously sampled and applied for the control of the head and neck, and of posture generally, in such a way as to support the effort of seeing; for controlling the extraocular muscles, to keep the eyes conjugately oriented so that the object of interest is represented at or near the fovea, and held in proper convergence for the distance of the object; to control the in trinsic eye muscles so as to maintain focus and regulate (in a limited way) the intensity of incident light as well as the system-aperture ; and even such incidental supporting actions as keeping the eyelid and the skin of the forehead out of the way. These mechanical adjustments, almost too "low" to be regarded as coded informa tion, are reported to other systems, and data from other systems contribute to them?</page><page sequence="19">92 American Scientist as when convergence and proprioception simultaneously gauge the size and distance of an object, or when the extraocular muscles are directed to "hunt" minutely to distin guish a boundary smaller than the effective resolution of the retina, or when the pat tern of global movement defines a geometric shape. Yet the actual treatment of the visual signal as information has not even been considered. Similar features occur in the auditory pathway: automatic and rather precise turn ing of the head, gain-control (applied, it may be suspected, through the ossicles), and doubtless others. A great deal of work, sensory and motor, is continuously being done by the spinal cord and brain stem; the animal lacking a cerebral cortex, or the human subject who has received the benefit of multiple electric shocks or cerebral surgery, behaves in all superficial respects like the intact specimen. The ordinary business of perception and motor activity is well performed; what is lacking might almost be thought intangible, but is not. The organism exercises a certain choice as to the modalities of signal it will use for the conduct of its business, for a wide variety of changes in the environment can provide useful information. Man has practically dis carded the olfactory sense, but he still shows, anatomically, the rudi ments of elaborately interconnected olfactory nuclei, so well organized in animals as to suggest that the data to be developed from the smells of this world are as intricate as from the sounds; that a detailed language, so to speak, exists which employs concepts now almost absent from the human mind, or at any rate not considered worth the neurons, the space, and the metabolism. Similarly, both the visual and auditory range is taken arbitrarily, and data in the infrared or above 20 kilocycles might as well not exist for unaided man. This is a curious state of affairs, because transducers are available in not distant species; and in seeking to under stand it, one must choose whether additional concepts are unnecessary or whether the cortical equipment is operating close to its capacity for highly developed codes. Oblique evidence for the latter is given by (a) Helen Keller, who is able to organize minimal sensory information to a degree comparable with normal persons of able in tellect, although her (intact) peripheral sensibilities have not been found more acute than in ordinary persons?as if a larger field for the handling of highly organized sig nal becomes available when the signal is more limited, and the ultimate processes at tain about the same degree of development; and (6) schizophrenic patients of high, sometimes immoderately high, intelligence?possibly suggesting again that more elab orate treatment is available for the circumscribed material the subject chooses to treat. One suspects that the number of elements needed rises exponentially as organi zation advances, and that the omission of primary data confers the same kind of ad vantage as the early dropping-out of unfruitful lines by the chess-player. With the superposition of the cerebral cortex as a specialized struc ture for forming and handling codes, and for using them to direct behav ior in a fashion which we are pleased to suppose is no longer automatic, we attain to the utmost central nervous development that we are ever likely, for philosophical reasons, to comprehend. The Living Organism The distinctive function of a living organism is to live; but, as Mac Gregor has explained, an organism has not survived biologically until it has propagated. A newborn child has therefore the function of surviving</page><page sequence="20">Mechanism in Neurosis 93 and of maturing to adult life. Beyond this point the children of men have proposed desiderata not expressed in the original design, but incidental to it, such as living to a great age. However, a child differs peculiarly from the chess-player in that it cannot be corrected by an end-of-game signal, by fed-back information that it has failed. Circuit-wise, the child accom plishes a seeming impossibility: it is influenced by data which are appar ently unavailable to it. We expect the anomaly to be accounted for by present concepts of the origin of species, holding that inherently unsuc cessful designs are abandoned somewhere in the course of phylogeny. It follows that a persisting design is strongly influenced by past failures. The results are indeed fed back, but in phylogeny rather than in one indi vidual, and they appear in subsequent generations as what we may call derivative data bearing upon survival. WTiat form the corrective data take is unexplained; "racial memory" and other anthropomorphic proposals have been widely rejected. But the matter may not be at all mysterious. If one observes an infant first learn ing to stand, and soon attempting to walk, in each of widely separated races and cultures, one finds the process identical in all respects save time, which is an individual affair. The ontogeny of this and other "basic" per formances is immutable, and we may suspect that this is because they depend upon a predetermined and unvarying plan of nervous organiza tion. Certainly any abrupt, high-amplitude auditory signal is circuited to extensive, definite motor patterns in infants everywhere on the planet, though they cannot know of a significance to be attached to loud noises. Without laboring the question of mechanism, we may define a "nor mal" child, one that is likely to succeed, as having sensitive recognition of the derivative data related to survival. It does not need to undergo malnutrition before it responds to hunger, and vehemently; it does not wait to be abandoned by adults and eaten by wolves before it places high value upon attention and affection. Unfortunately we are not competent witnesses to the fundamental character of the needs for survival. Certain needs are freely satisfied, without attention, and their profoundly urgent quality is overlooked. There are reminders : an adult who is thirsty is in such emphatic distress as to reveal that the species must not always have enjoyed liberal sup plies of water, and must have lost large numbers, not long since, for want of water. Today, with municipal water supplies, the problem seems trivial to the individual, but the species still has the more primitive opin ion. Such an example is self-evident, but other derivative data may be quite diverse and obscure, their origin forgotten and their quality almost literary, so that it can even be disputed whether survival itself is espe cially important. We enjoy, moreover, distractions beyond number, so that considerably more reflection is given to the best brand of television receiver, or the correct length of skirt for this season, than to the cer tainty of food supplies or safety from predatory animals. Comparing specifications, the chess-player deals with signal in such a way as to win games, the child in such a way as to survive. The chess player corrects its mode of operation according to fed-back information</page><page sequence="21">94 American Scientist about the result, the child according to fed-back derivative data based on prior results in the species. The environment faced by the chess player is singularly uniform compared with that of the child, but each has a single effector system, that of the child being rather more adapt able. The chess-player determines what to do by explicit computation of the worths of all possible activities, influenced by remembered informa tion; the child does not move by regular turns, and does not select a pro cedure from among all conceivably open to it, because some definite re quirement usually dictates what will be done, and when?but it, too, evaluates the activities possible by means of its own explicit compari sons and preinstalled and remembered data. The chess-player is endowed with an emphatic bias against failure, and is caused to apply this bias to data which are found even tenuously relevant; the child operates under multiaxial bias which it attaches to all of experience, since by associa tion it can make almost every possible datum relevant. Finally, either device is capable of a seriously unfavorable choice of behavior because it is influenced by memory-biased data which, if it could be known, are not appropriate to the real situation. Coding and reporting. When environmental signal has been transduced to the intramural form and then applied to a group of elements which ex press it uniquely, it is coded; but it is also identified. Since there can be no absolute with (or against) which to identify it, coding is sufficient identification when it establishes that the present signal is precisely the same, or not precisely the same, as any previous signal. The system has its feet on the ground nowhere, but it can develop any desired body of information. Most scientific pursuits engender their information in this way; it is well exemplified in bacteriology, as when a score of pneumococcus strains which are otherwise indistinguishable turn out to exhibit capsular swell ing, or not to, when placed in a serum prepared in a certain way. The find ing that this strain is the same as another, and not the same as a third, as shown by this test, soon gives rise to recognized "types" of pneumococcus and thus to a body of knowledge, which appears more informative than it is. The Wassermann test is an astounding example of the same sort of process, where a perfect witch's brew of ingredients, none known to be related to syphilis in any way, yields one result with syphilitic serum and a different result with normal serum?incomparably valuable informa tion, based on empirical sameness or difference. These self-evident exam ples are labored because it is essential to point out that a device which can distinguish between a code which is the same as any previous code and one which is not the same can deal with information as intricate as may appear in a lifetime, with no shortcoming except the want of an ab solute reference point. As it occurs in the visual system, the process might have the following form. The first visual signal to enter the visual-sensory cortex is simply written into the first cells available, and into many more cells than are actually needed. Perhaps some degree of differentiation takes place even</page><page sequence="22">Mechanism in Neurosis 95 here, as when the cortical cells outnumber the retinal elements, so that not only the fact of retinal excitation but also some details about the in tensity and color are coded. But the cortical neurons are doubtless taken arbitrarily, and the primary experience has no interpretable meaning whatever. There has been a visual experience; it has received a cortical representation. Now, there is a further signal. If it is due to precisely the same retinal excitation, it is coded identically; but if it is repeatedly the same, the firing of precisely this array of coding neurons has become, so to speak, habitual, and an abbreviation alone need go forward. A group of such abbreviations might be termed a report, condensing the excitation of a very great number of retinal elements in any usual or frequent man ner. There must be, as a rule, a great many exceptional details that must go forward uncondensed, or as codes proper, together with the report, until frequent experience of these details warrants their assuming a re port as well. The constant features of experience might be of any kind, and be reported in any desired way, so that cross reference may be taken to any aspect of the excitation that has been usual enough to activate additional reference-tags; they will not be limited, in general, to visual data, for in due time oculomotor and muscle information will add to re ports of the thing seen, just as visual information will supplement re ports of the thing heard. Visual reports express salients of an experience; the chief reports for a face, for example, must be precisely those used in cartooning?the essential features for universal recognition. The face of a stranger has to be rendered by supplementary codes, but on sufficient acquaintance he is fully reported. The condensation of codes to reports must, of course, be repeated with the reports themselves ; and early in this process one recognizes the occur rence of something akin to gestalt. The work is carried "higher" in several respects : the information is still more concise, it includes sensory data from still other sources, and it is approaching the most central level of perception, the little man. By this time it is closely connected with the speech formula for the name of the thing, the auditory report for the sound of the word, stored visual data for the word as printed, etc., etc. It is misleading, however, to retrace these steps by dissection, as an adult, because the way back is traversed by abstractions, developed much later (as when one hears discussed the "gestalt" for a square!), and because no memories of the process are retained, since nothing had been organized to stored form until the process had been carried on for two, three, or four years. Instead one might reconstruct the method by review ing the probable history of visual experience in the newborn child, a tax ing exercise that need not be stated here at length. The little man. This term refers to the "highest" or "most central" function in the nervous system, at which level afferent and efferent codes are dealt with in their most concise form. Thus far the multitudinous sig nal processes have merely been reduced for comprehension and workabil ity ; and if the only result is to present them in this form to an anthropo morphic animus, we are no nearer to a mechanism than before. In a block</page><page sequence="23">96 American Scientist diagram, however, we have this convergence of signal appearing thus: [somatic aff?rents k - [somatic efferente] i? [the little man ] ^ [visceral aff?rents] ' % [visceral efferente] [data storage] If we specify that the stored data embody phylogenetic experience (even granting that this may appear, rather, in much more diffuse form such as a circuit layout), the block diagram accounts for most of the be havior of the average mammal. But one feels that a human characteristic is lacking. The little man is conscious of himself as an organism, to be sure, from the signal available to him?just as a mouse, or a cow, is; the average cow knows clearly where the grass leaves off and the cow begins. But the little man has no consciousness, the circuiting which enables him to hear himself think. If we term his thinking the "central processes," and treat them as phenomena concerning which signal can be obtained quite as well as for optical events, the circuit need only introduce this signal among other aff?rents : [somatic aff?rents ] ^ [somatic efferente ] [visceral aff?rents ] -*? [central processes ] ? [visceral efferente ] [central aff?rents] ^ [data storage ] and it is found that the little man has disappeared. The resulting equip ment is capable of utilizing signal as before and of being aware that it is utilizing signal. Neither central processes nor data storage can be freely sampled as afferent sources; the psychiatric expression for this is that consciousness is as the visible, or lesser, portion of an iceberg. Of principal interest here is the specific, reactive process that resists the sampling of a certain kind of material?that which is strongly biased because it is regarded, by indi vidual or species, as dangerously derivative of survival. As in the chess player, not only the data but even the region storing them is too ominous to reach currency in everyday operations, or, above all, to be brought out by probing. This protective denial of biased material adds greatly to the time and effort entailed in clinical psychiatry. Such material has force for influencing behavior, but it is "kept in the unconscious." The central-central feed-back link offers, incidentally, an entertaining explanation of d?j? vu, the seeming recollection of an experience as it occurs, since all that is re quired is for the recognition of direct afferent data to be delayed slightly behind that of the ''consciousness'' link, a common practice in telephone work. Obsolescence, Neurosis, and Psychosis While the life of the chess-player is uniform, except for the tendency to treat apprehensively a larger and larger body of untoward experience, life in the living organism imposes a continuously changing system of val ues. But changes in respect to the real situation are not accurately fol lowed by the values in use, by the individual any more than by the spe cies. To consider a prevalent disorder: it is typical of the child to rely on his parents for some years, at first through necessity and later by cus tom, but the relationship seldom has value for survival by the time the</page><page sequence="24">Mechanism in Neurosis 97 child is an adult. Notwithstanding, if the infantile situation contained great uncertainties or dangers, though they were illusory, owing to de fects in the parental role, the subject may devote the rest of his life to the quest for a satisfactory parent. His choice of a spouse is said to be greatly influenced in this way. Obviously the requirement is obsolete, but this cannot be made known to the subject because he is motivated by infor mation strongly biased and "deeply" stored, so that he can have no access to it. A great variety of derivatives function as persistent wellsprings of be havior; by the time the subject is an adult seeking medical aid, they are uniformly obsolete. One defines neurosis, conveniently, as the state in which this behavior makes the subject unhappy or ineffective. Some measure of inappropriate, obsolete motivation is universal, but short of these limits it is not clinical. The outstanding difficulty in treatment is that of penetrating to the level at which the disturbing information is stored; for the thin layer of consciousness is highly reactive, most particularly to prevent such ac cess.6 One may undertake to dredge up, item by item, everything that has been stored, until the most troublesome matters become exposed to view and their influence upon behavior apprehended. The task then is to dissipate their force, and although the process is poorly explained it evidently requires much living in awareness of one's own primitive work ings. Or use can be made of drugs in which the layer of consciousness is peculiarly soluble, and, by techniques soon to be reported,7 introduce nullifying or alternative data which deprive the obsolete material of further significance. Psychoses, the various forms of clinical insanity, are characterized by the irrelevance of thought and behavior to reality, and by a determined unawareness of the patient that anything is wrong. That the brain occa sionally resorts to psychotic operation when injured, intoxicated, etc., implies that the psychotic mode is somewhat less difficult to pursue than the normal; it can be done with less than the intact equipment. That cer tain trends, e.g., paranoia, appear in both functional and organic psycho ses suggests that psychotic behavior assumes only a limited variety of general forms, within which the subject evolves whatever subject mat ter, utilizes whatever real and imaginary signal, happens to serve his pur poses. In view of the consistent failure (to 1950) to discover chemical or met abolic peculiarities in the functional psychoses, it may be well to con sider how the operationally intact brain might enter upon psychotic function. A simple analogy is given by a signal-generator which is ca pable of several modes of operation, depending upon a small change in cir cuit constants;8 or by the chess-player, making the assumption, some how, that pawns are worth more than queens, and developing extensive 6 It is for this reason that preoccupation of the patient with his own psychiatric div agations is so useless, however charming; and thus the modish use of poor Dr. Freud's own terms (compulsive, erotic, narcissistic, etc.) merely adds at the most superficial level some further work for the deeper mechanisms to do, which, evidently, they do without complaining. 7 R. M. Brickner : personal communication, 1949.</page><page sequence="25">98 American Scientist methods based upon it?efficient, self-consistent, and altogether falla cious. What is emphasized is that a plurality of modes is available for the operation of a high-order device. The brain may proceed from information about which all persons in the community are agreed; but much more attractive circumstances, a far happier outlook, can be engendered from homemade information. It may not prove circumspect for the central processes to note closely where sig nal has originated; or, in the tormented ideas of paranoia, there may be hopeless confusion about the origin. But given an "original" mode of op eration, the values are made consistent, the impulses arise logically, and a perfectly reasonable existence is developed, which most people fail to understand. Conflicting ideas of these other people must be excluded; particularly the suggestion that anything is wrong with the patient's thinking is rejected. (From anthropological data it is clear that locally accepted "reality" may seem quite absurd in another culture, and that it is the body of generally accepted delusions, rather than a body of fact, which determines what is "real" in any society, including the present one. Hence it may be more accurate to define the psychotic as one who remains out of communication with his fellows, the better to protect and enjoy his private fictions.) All the usual methods of treating psychotic persons have one action in common: all are destructive of neurons. Thus the one method now available for changing the operating basis is to damage the apparatus in which it resides, so obliging the brain to resort to another basis. There is a certain probability that the new basis will be more acceptable. The various "therapies" need not select neuron-groups which are primarily concerned in the disorder?although conceivably the most overworked neurons might be the first ones destroyed?for it probably suffices to disrupt a proportion of all circuits at random; whereupon signal is re-routed and handled differently to a slight extent. Small differences attract an ex traordinary degree of clinical notice. Summary Viewing the nervous system as a device for the reception and utiliza tion of signal, toward the purpose of discharging the function of the living organism, some features of its design can be postulated. Another device of high order, Shannon's chess-player, modified so as to be able to learn to play chess and exhibit abnormal behavior, is taken as an instructive analogue. By examining the nervous system as a problem in design, like any simpler mechanism, it is attempted to illustrate a pattern of reflec tion by which certain relationships can be distinguished, perhaps more easily than otherwise, and by which certain kinds of relationships can be anticipated from what is necessary or useful to the design. 8 It is not intended to suggest, as some have, that psychotic is to normal thinking as oscillation is to stable amplification, or that a psychosis is a "circular" process like auricular fibrillation and is therefore arrested by electroconvulsions?two naive mis apprehensions that have followed the feed-back concept into neurophysiology.
