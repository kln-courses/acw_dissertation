<plain_text> <page sequence="1">    45  Chapter Two   CONSTRUCTING THE FOURTH  DIMENSION: THE FIRST SERIES OF THE   SCIENTIFIC ROMANCES   Roland Barthes noted the transgressive potential of  analogy, writing that ‘its constitu- tive movement is that of  cutting across’.1  The relational nature of  analogous reasoning  is also the essential feature that identifi es the S cientifi c Romances : holding it together as a  larger text is the concept of  the fourth dimension itself. Hyperspace philosophy functions  as a site where two diff erent impulses – the ‘transcendental materialism’ described ear- lier – are linked. As a ‘Text’ (in Barthes’s sense of  the word), Hinton’s fourth dimension  disrupts the separation between objectivity and subjectivity, placing these two perceptual  modes in tension with each other.2  Hinton’s conception of  the fourth dimension of  space  is intrinsically idealist; however, in his ‘scientifi c’ arguments he supported his theory  along materialist lines. Nowhere is this contradiction more observable than in the fi nal  text of  the fi rst series, ‘Casting Out the Self ’, where he attempted to fi nd an empirical  means of  approaching the fourth dimension through introspection. The only way such  a confl icted project can survive its own construction is through its functioning as a Text  with a signifi cant amount of  ‘play’, again in Barthes’s sense of  the term:   ‘Playing’ must be understood here in all its polysemy – the text itself  p lays (like a door, like a  machine with ‘play’) and the reader plays twice over, playing the Text as one plays a game.  [...] The Text [...] asks of  the reader a practical collaboration.3    In this chapter I examine the ways the overall structure of  the S cientifi c Romances requires  the reader to work with Hinton in the construction of  the fourth dimension. Here I focus  on how Hinton explicitly calls upon the reader for ‘practical collaboration’ in playing his    1  Barthes, ‘From Work’, 193.   2  Barthes defi ned the ‘Text’ in opposition to the ‘work’, writing that ‘the diff erence is this: the  work is a fragment of  substance, occupying a part of  the space of  books (in a library for  example), the Text is a methodological fi eld’ (193). I am aligning transcendence with ‘romance’  or idealism here, and ‘materialism’ with Victorian empiricism and scientifi c discourse. I am  informed by Karen Armstrong’s discussion of  m ythos and logos as opposing worldviews. See  Armstrong, T he Battle for God . I also have in mind Ernst Cassirer’s distinction between what he  called ‘discursive thought’ and the myth- making activity of  the mind, with its tendency toward  pathetic fallacy.

In the  previous chapter I noted that before Hinton could justify attempts to obtain  experimental proof  of  the fourth dimension, he needed to demonstrate that it was pos- sible to imagine it. Because Hinton’s methodology is founded in analogy, the fourth  dimension can only be represented through a series of  relations. My focus in the pres- ent chapter is on how Hinton attempted to represent the fourth dimension in his fi rst  series of   Scientifi c Romances (1884– 1886). This series includes individual texts that were  published fi rst as pamphlets and later collected into a single volume. These texts diff er  widely: the fi rst, ‘What Is the Fourth Dimension?’ is a meditation on the mathematical  possibility of  a spatial fourth dimension. It is here that we are fi rst given Hinton’s dimen- sional analogy of  algebraic symbols and descriptive geometric shapes that I cited in the  fi rst chapter. The next text, or ‘romance’, is a short story titled ‘The Persian King; or,  the Law of  the Valley’, and it off ers an allegory of  Victorian thermodynamics, where the  fourth dimension is the implied means of  escape from entropic cosmic death. I discuss  these texts in some detail in the present chapter.   The next two texts in the fi rst series, ‘A Plane World’ and ‘A Picture of  Our Universe’,  inform my discussion throughout this book, but I do not thoroughly explicate them here.  ‘A Plane World’ is another philosophical meditation that employs a dimensional analogy  similar to Abbott’s  Flatland ; however, the structure of  this text is not a traditional nar- rative. As noted in the  previous chapter , Hinton’s aim in ‘A Plane World’ was diff erent  from Abbott’s satirical impulse in F latland . Where Abbott used the dimensional analogy  to comment on contemporary issues around class, gender and religion, Hinton wished  to examine ‘the physical conditions of  life on the plane’.4  To this end, ‘A Plane World’  consists of  direct exposition, anecdotes, diagrams and even cut outs of  ‘two- dimensional’  beings for the reader to make use of  in representing a plane world. ‘A Picture of  Our  Universe’ takes yet another approach to the fourth dimension, discussing it in terms elec- tromagnetism and the ether before turning to an argument in favour of  free will, which  is relevant to my discussion in  Chapter Three .5    In addition to focusing on the fi rst two romances of  the fi rst series in the present  chapter, I conclude by examining the fi nal romance, ‘Casting Out the Self ’. This text  off ers instructions for the reader’s guidance in performing a series of  exercises with 27  wooden cubes. This was the fi rst of  Hinton’s attempts to ‘approach’ the fourth dimension  through exercises with practical models. In off ering a detailed reading of  these three texts  here, my intention is to demonstrate the relational, ambulatory nature of  Hinton’s four-  dimensional aesthetic. This emphasis on relations is perhaps most obvious in his cube  exercises, though it serves a necessary function throughout his work. Just as the process of   reading Ruskin can become learning to see with Ruskin, the process of  reading Hinton’s   Scientifi c Romances becomes learning to ‘see’ four- dimensionally. The only way Hinton  could attempt to represent the fourth dimension was through a process of  correction   4  Hinton, ‘A Plane World’, S cientifi c Romances , 129.   5  Clarke examines ‘A Picture of  Our Universe’ with reference to D.

He described this in ‘The Persian  King’ as ‘the Arabic method of  description’, which is, he explained, ‘used for the descrip- tion of  numerical quantities. For instance [...] if  we are asked the number of  days in the  year, we answer fi rst 300, which is a false answer, but gives the nearest approximation in  hundreds. Then we say sixty [...]’, and so on. Or, to apply this method more directly to  his own prose, Hinton explained:   Firstly a certain statement is made about the subject to be described, and is impressed upon  the reader as if  it were true. Then when that has been grasped, another statement is made,  generally somewhat contradictory, and the fi rst notion formed has to be corrected. But these  two statements taken together are given as truth [...] and so on.6    Each text in the fi rst series of  S cientifi c Romances functions as a partial statement of  the  whole. The eff ect of  reading all of  the texts together is an overt manifestation of  aesthetic  response that, according to Wolfgang Iser, occurs during the process of  reading:   Whatever we have read sinks into our memory and is foreshortened. It may later be evoked  again and set against a diff erent background with the result that the reader is enabled to  develop hitherto unforeseeable connections [...]. Thus, the reader, in establishing these  interrelations [...] actually causes the text to reveal its potential multiplicity of  connections.  These connections are the product of  the reader’s mind working on the raw material of   the text, though they are not the text itself – for this consists of  just sentences, statements,  information, etc.7    Hinton’s fourth dimension cannot be fully articulated within any single text. It is only  through the creative act of  the reader who undertakes the process of  ‘establishing the  interrelations’ between the diff erent narrative, discursive and practical ‘statements’ that  the fourth dimension can be represented. Hinton was trying to engage his readers in an  act of  the Ruskinian imagination.   The initial movement of  the reader’s imagination through the juxtaposed texts within  the fi rst series is a dynamic one, highlighting what Iser called the ‘gaps of  indeterminacy’  which he identifi ed in James Joyce’s U lysses :   Each chapter prepares the ‘horizon’ for the next, and it is the process of  reading that provides  the continual overlapping and interweaving of  the views presented by each of  the chapters.  The reader is stimulated into fi lling the ‘empty spaces’ between the chapters in order to group  them into a coherent whole. 8   The reader of  the S cientifi c Romances must overlap and connect the diff ering perspectives  on the fourth dimension presented in each individual romance in order to imagine the  fourth dimension.

In fi lling the gaps  between texts and establishing the relations, the reader generates ‘the virtual dimension  of  the text, which endows it with its reality’. 9 An act of  strenuous imagination on the part  of  the reader would allow them to p erceive the fourth dimension.   To better understand how and why Hinton sought to engender this aesthetic response  through the formal aspects of  his work, we need to further examine the content of  his  early writings on the fourth dimension. With this in mind, I  turn to three signifi cant  romances from the fi rst series, ‘What Is the Fourth Dimension?’, ‘The Persian King’ and  ‘Casting Out the Self ’.   ‘What Is the Fourth Dimension?’   This is Hinton’s fi rst known publication on the fourth dimension, published in D ublin  University Magazine in 1880; it was later reprinted as the fi rst pamphlet in the fi rst series  of  the S cientifi c Romances in 1884, and as part of  the complete series in 1886.1 0 Formally  speaking, ‘What Is the Fourth Dimension?’ is the most traditional of  all the texts in the  fi rst series. It is a philosophical meditation on the possibility of  conceiving of  a fourth  spatial dimension. In its simple, straightforward style we can observe Hinton’s initial  assumption about the transparency of  language, that his fourth dimension could be  expressed in the traditional essay form.   This text is well- positioned as the fi rst in the series; chronologically it is an early writ- ing in Hinton’s career, and his early attempt to explain the fourth dimension within the  formal limits of  the essay mirrors the needs of  his readers to begin with a simple expla- nation of  this new idea. The reader thus begins the series with a question (‘What is the  fourth dimension?’) and each text in the series serves as an experimental attempt to fi nd  an answer. There is a provisionality to ‘What Is the Fourth Dimension?’ that sets the tone  for the entire fi rst series.   Writing in another context, Ian F. A. Bell notes the similarities between the analogy  as a methodology of  science and technique of  modernist poetry: to acknowledge anal- ogy as an instrument of  exploration is to rely ‘upon a yoking together of  conceptual  dissimilarity and relational agreement, laying the ground for revised notions of  diff er- ence that could be both objectively and speculatively exploratory’.1 1 The very texture of   the fi rst series of  S cientifi c Romances is relational; by ‘playing’ the text, the reader brings  together dissimilar but corrective representations of  the fourth dimension. The inter- rogative mode established in the title of  ‘What Is the Fourth Dimension?’ sets the tone for   9  Iser,  The Implied Reader , 279.   10  I write that this is the fi rst ‘known’ Hinton text on the fourth dimension because during my  research I have uncovered another, unsigned essay from 1878 titled ‘The Mystery of  the Fourth  Dimension’, also in the D ublin University Magazine . The title echoes James Hinton’s most popular  work, T he Mystery of  Pain ; additionally, the theory of  the fourth dimension explicated here and  the style of  writing lead me to conclude that it is highly likely that Hinton authored this text as  well. However, because of  the ambiguity concerning the authorship, and its lack of  inclusion  in the  Scientifi c Romances , I will not address it here.   11  I. Bell, ‘The Real’, 121.  </page> <page sequence="5">    49  CONSTRUCTING THE FOURTH DIMENSION 49 the reader, who is to undergo an aesthetic response that mimics the process of  scientifi c  discovery through hypothesis and experimentation.   The reader must traverse the individual texts of  the fi rst series, establishing the rela- tions that will allow him or her to perform a creative act of  imagination: conceiving of   the fourth dimension itself. For Hinton, the ethical importance for this aesthetic response  was that it resulted in an analogous act of  self- creation. As Bell explains, ‘to be creative,  then, is to explore, to question [...]. To question is to raise the possibility of  moving from  one state to another. It is always a liminal activity where the self  is poised for change  at the edge or boundary of  things’.1 2 The four- dimensional self  that will (hopefully)  emerge after reading the fi rst series is self- directed and self- creating: an artist of  a higher  order. Hinton fi rst pointed to this possibility at the conclusion of  ‘What Is the Fourth  Dimension?’, where he stated that, aside from the intrinsic interest of  the subject of  the  fourth dimension,   speculations of  this kind [...] have considerable value; for they enable us to express in intel- ligible terms things of  which we can form no image. They can supply us, as it were, with scaf- folding, which the mind can make use of  in building up its conceptions. And the additional  gain to our power of  representation is very great.1 3   Here Hinton maintained the diff erence between the ability to conceive of  something  and the ability to imagine it. However, being able to conceive or describe a thing is the  fi rst step in imagining it; this results in a signifi cant ‘additional gain to our power of   representation’. Here we see Hinton’s tentative movement toward a proposal of  a four-  dimensional aesthetic, the groundwork for which he was laying in the fi rst series. The  individual texts work as the scaff olding; it is the reader’s task to develop their own power  of  representation through the process of  making the connections between these texts.   Establishing this scaff olding is a necessary part of  the process of  formulating the rules  for seeing four- dimensionally. According to Raymond Williams, ‘the normal process of   perception [...] can only be seen as complete when we have interpreted the incoming  sensory information either by a known confi guration or rule, or by some new confi gura- tion which we can try to learn as a new rule’. 14 Hinton was trying to establish a new rule  for seeing through description by asking his readers to ‘think of ’ how four- dimensional  objects would appear. He deployed the dimensional analogy to substantiate an answer to  the question: ‘By what fi gure shall we represent 24  [?] ’. In his answer, Hinton described  the pattern of  progression from a line to a square to a cube, arguing that in this way we  can extrapolate the geometric properties of  a four- dimensional object. In ‘working in  accordance with the analogy’ it is possible ‘just as by handling or looking at it, [...] to  describe a fi gure in space, and so by going through a process of  calculation it is within our  power to describe all the properties of  a fi gure in four dimensions’.1 5   12  Ibid., 121.   13  Hinton, ‘What Is the Fourth Dimension?’, S cientifi c Romances , 31.   14  R.

Ruskin described this as  the ‘limit to the power of  all human imagination’: ‘no human mind has ever conceived’  something entirely new.1 7 Both scientist and artist can only describe something analogi- cally or metaphorically: as N. Katherine Hayles observes, ‘a completely unique object, if   such a thing were imaginable, could not be described. Lacking metaphoric connections,  it would remain inexpressible’.1 8 For Hinton, the problem was to bring the fourth dimen- sion into the realm of  the expressible. He found two ways of  doing this within the S cientifi c  Romances : by pushing ‘through’ the limitation of  the metaphorical nature of  language to  expose its polysemous creative potential, and by marrying form with content.   This marriage of  form and content can be observed in the texture of  continual sup- plementation and correction between the individual texts of  the S cientifi c Romances . In the  later texts of  the fi rst series, Hinton off ered various ways of  answering the question of  the  fourth dimension that is raised in the fi rst text. In doing so, Hinton directly challenged  what Beer calls ‘the naïve positivistic equivalence between object and event, or utterance,  [that] presupposes a single necessary theoretical outcome’.1 9 The range of  the appeal of   his hyperspace philosophy amongst Hinton’s contemporaries was in part due to its open- ness – its scope for ‘play’ – particularly in the fi rst series. Hinton’s decision to work out  his theories within the hybrid genre of  the ‘scientifi c romance’ indicates his awareness  that, as Beer observes,   language is a heuristic tool, but it may best function at the frontiers of  scientifi c knowledge  by adopting a mode which sounds strangely belletristic. Severe one- to- one equivalence may  prove to be paradoxically less exact as a working tool than the larger term during the period  of  theory formation.2 0   Hinton needed to keep his language multi- vocal in the fi rst series because he was try- ing to counteract the narrowing of  vision within current scientifi c theory. ‘What Is the  Fourth Dimension?’ begins with the proclamation that ‘at the present time our actions  are largely infl uenced by our theories. We have abandoned the simple and instinctive  mode of  life of  the earlier civilisations for one regulated by the assumptions of  our  knowledge’.2 1 Increasing specialization of  separate scientifi c disciplines meant it was  crucial to not lose sight of  ‘the constitution of  the knowing faculty, and the conditions  of  knowledge’.2 2 Here, again, we see the infl uence of  James Hinton’s lawbreaker: in  ‘What Is the Fourth Dimension?’ we are asked to question ‘whatever seems arbitrary   16  Beer, O pen Fields , 149– 72.   17  Ruskin, W orks , 4: 236.   18  Hayles, C haos Bound , 31.   19  Beer, O pen Fields , 157.   20  Ibid., 157– 58.   21  Hinton, ‘What Is the Fourth Dimension?’, S cientifi c Romances , 3.   22  Ibid., 5.  </page> <page sequence="7">    51  CONSTRUCTING THE FOURTH DIMENSION 51 and irrationally limited in the domain of  knowledge’. The particular limitation that ‘we  must suppose away’ is – for Hinton – our understanding of  space as limited to three  dimensions only. 23   Hinton’s interest in the fourth dimension was underpinned by what Alice Jenkins  identifi es as a Romantic understanding of  abstract space: ‘not space imagined as a thing,  but the  condition for imagining things’.2 4 Jenkins’s designation of  ‘abstract’ as opposed to  the material space of  geographic, social and political practices is most fi tting for Hinton’s  project, particularly in the fi rst series. Critical explorations of  the material spaces listed  above are, as Jenkins observes, more appropriately described as explorations of  place.  The fourth dimension of  Hinton’s hyperspace philosophy is no place, but rather the  space of  undiscovered possibility. Thus Hinton wanted to keep that space open for as  long as possible because ‘whatever pursuit we are engaged in, we are acting consciously  or unconsciously upon some theory, some view of  things’.2 5 Hinton struggled to over- come the problem that the three- dimensional ‘view of  things’ causes by limiting our  ability to imagine a four- dimensional object.   Were the four- dimensional analogue for a cube to pass through our three- dimensional  space, Hinton explained, ‘it would seem to us like a cube’. We must have recourse to the  dimensional analogy here:  ‘to justify this conclusion we have but think of  how a cube  would appear to a two- dimensional being. To come within the scope of  his faculties at  all, it must come into contact with the plane in which he moves’.2 6 Thus, the cube would  appear to the fl atlander as a square. ‘So, to form an idea of  a four- dimensional fi gure, a  series of  solid shapes [...] has to be mentally grasped and fused into a unitary concep- tion’.2 7 To see four- dimensionally is, therefore, to see as does Ruskin’s imaginative artist,  who is able to fuse together multiple ideas that are ‘separately wrong’ but, in unifi cation,  ‘will be beautiful’.2 8   For Hinton, the three- dimensionally limited imagination is only able to perceive four-  dimensional objects as a series of  three- dimensional ‘slices’, just as the being limited to  two dimensions would only be able to ‘see’ a two- dimensional slice of  a cube. In combin- ing these slices,   we should have to imagine some stupendous whole, wherein all that has ever come into being  or will come co- exists, which passing slowly on, leaves in this fl ickering consciousness of  ours,  limited to a narrow space and a single moment, a tumultuous record of  changes and vicis- situdes that are but to us. Change and movement seem as if  they were all that existed. But the  appearance of  them would be due merely to the momentary passing through our conscious- ness of  ever existing realities.2 9   23  Ibid., 5.   24  Jenkins, S pace , 152, original emphasis.   25  Hinton, ‘What Is the Fourth Dimension?’, S cientifi c Romances , 4.   26  Ibid., 16.   27  Ibid., 17.   28  Ruskin, W orks , 4: 233.   29  Hinton, ‘What Is the Fourth Dimension?’, S cientifi c Romances , 24.  </page> <page sequence="8"> 52 52 BEFORE EINSTEIN   Taken in the context of  fi n- de- siècle anxieties surrounding evolution and entropy, prog- ress and degeneration, this statement is both comforting and stifl ing. While nothing is  irrevocably lost, the future is already determined. For Hinton, the experience of  time  is an illusion:  it is simply the way that our three- dimensionally limited consciousness  encounters the fourth dimension. Like Ruskin – who argued that the highest form of   imaginative genius is one that ‘seizes, at the same instant’, all the incomplete compo- nents that can be successfully fused together to form a beautiful whole – for Hinton, the  four- dimensional consciousness perceives all that ever was or will be, simultaneously. 30  Temporal and spatial omniscience, like the ability to create something from nothing, is  the province of  the divine. ‘Imagination’, Ruskin argued, ‘is neither to be taught, nor by  any eff orts to be attained’. 31 This is where Hinton departed from his early mentor: his  hyperspace philosophy was founded on the belief  that by expanding the condition by  which we are able perceive and conceive (i.e. space), we are able to ‘educate’ and expand  the imagination.   Hinton’s explanation of  the lower- dimensional being’s experience with a higher-  dimensional object as an encounter with a series of  ‘slices’  sets the stage for the reader of   the S cientifi c Romances . Each text within this series functions as a single ‘slice’ that, when  combined and fused together by an act of  imagination, will give the reader a more com- plete picture of  Hinton’s fourth dimension. Here is where form expresses the content of   Hinton’s writing: the act of  reading the series thus becomes a creative act of  representing  the fourth dimension. According to Hinton,   when [this] faculty is acquired – or rather when it is brought into consciousness, for it exists  in every one in imperfect form – a new horizon opens. The mind acquires a development of   power, and in this use of  ampler space as a mode of  thought, a path is opened by using that  very truth which, when fi rst stated by Kant, seemed to close the mind within such fast limits.3 2   Bruce Clarke rightly observes that ‘ultimately, then, for Hinton the fourth dimension of   space [...] was not a discovery waiting to be confi rmed so much as a creative ideal – a  cultural prophecy and moral goal to which the mind ought to be conformed’.3 3 Thus the  fourth dimension is not a particular place to be discovered; it is the aesthetic and moral  potential of  each human consciousness.   In the fi rst series, there is certainly a looseness to Hinton’s impressionistic system of   supplementation, which indicates some amount of  resistance to insistence on point- by-  point equivalence between signifi er and signifi ed. This fl uidity would make sense, consid- ering the period in which Hinton was writing; however, to stop here would be to simplify  the matter. As Andrea Henderson has demonstrated, even though   literary critics and art historians have noted [...] the infl uence of  late Victorian mathematical  developments on modernist conceptions of  space [...], the development of  non- Euclidean   30  Ruskin, W orks , 4: 234.   31  Ibid., 233.   32  Hinton, A  New Era , 6– 7.   33  Clarke, E nergy Forms , 185.  </page> <page sequence="9">    53  CONSTRUCTING THE FOURTH DIMENSION 53 geometry had an earlier and more fundamental infl uence on developments in aesthetics  because [...] to relinquish faith in the representational powers of  classical geometry was  to recognize that symbolic systems generally, while they might be characterized by internal  coherence, might not be amenable to a ‘real interpretation’. 34   Hinton was in a strange position because, while the rise of  non- Euclidean geometries  created space in the public imagination for his hyperspace philosophy, his concept of  the  fourth dimension was the result of  pushing t hrough analogy for a ‘real interpretation’ of   the symbol x4  . Thus, while in his fi rst series he played upon the semantic looseness of  ‘the  larger term’ of  the ‘fourth dimension’, the very concept of  the fourth dimension itself  is  founded on an insistence on seemingly transparent representation taken to the extreme  of  hypostasization.   Hinton came to the conclusion that we are four- dimensional beings by getting further  entangled in the logic of  his own dimensional analogy. In using the dimensional analogy  to conceive of  two- dimensional plane beings, we are actually just imagining very thin  three- dimensional creatures:  ‘If  we consider beings on a plane as not mere idealities,  we must suppose them to be of  some thickness’.3 5 Lines and planes are simply abstrac- tions, and so the imagined plane beings would need to have some kind of – probably  miniscule – thickness in the third dimension. By fi nessing the limitations of  the dimen- sional analogy, Hinton made an important cognitive leap here: if  there is a fourth spatial  dimension, then we, as three- dimensional beings are either merely abstractions in the  mind of  a hyperbeing, or we have a four- dimensional existence ourselves. Hinton found  the fi rst possibility unsatisfactory; he compared it with Berkeley’s religious idealism and  concluded that ‘it is somewhat curious to notice that we can thus conceive of  an exis- tence relative to which that which we enjoy must exist as a mere abstraction’. 36 Again,  for Hinton, we are saved by our imaginations:  if  we are able to conceive of  a higher  dimension, then it is likely that we are of  that higher dimension ourselves. However, the  implication that we are unconsciously four- dimensional was not enough to completely  abolish the underlying fear of  being reduced to powerless abstraction of  the mind of  a  hyperbeing. This is a concern that haunts Hinton’s hyperspace philosophy, particularly  in the fi rst series.   Victorian Thermodynamics and the Fourth Dimension   Clarke writes that, in ‘The Persian King’, Hinton ‘gave the second law [of  thermo- dynamics] the slip by yielding to it so perfectly that it turned into the enabling condi- tion of  all motion and thus all energy’.3 7 Just as we have seen in ‘What Is the Fourth  Dimension?’, in this second romance we can observe the ‘dialectics of  subversion and   34  A. Henderson, ‘Math for Math’s Sake’, 457.   35  Hinton, ‘What Is the Fourth Dimension?’, S cientifi c Romances , 30.   36  Ibid., 31.   37  Clarke, E nergy Forms , 119.  </page> <page sequence="10"> 54 54 BEFORE EINSTEIN  support’ underpinning Hinton’s hyperspace philosophy.3 8 Before further analysing  Hinton’s methodology of  ‘pushing through’, it is necessary to understand the move- ment of  the fourth dimension from the context of  the new geometries to Victorian  thermodynamics.   In the second half  of  the nineteenth century a growing acceptance of  the theory of   evolution – fi nally given scientifi c authority by the publication of  Darwin’s research – also  necessitated the acceptance of  irreversible change and loss. Irreversible change, when  applied to thermodynamics, results in the concept of  entropy. The second law of  ther- modynamics states that a certain amount of  heat is lost in every exchange of  energy; it is  not destroyed, but it becomes inaccessible for further exchange. It is this diff erence that  allows for the transfer of  heat at all: heat radiates from bodies of  higher temperature to  those of  lower temperature until equilibrium is reached, and this process is irreversible.  Eventually, according to late- Victorian physicists, the entire universe would suff er a cos- mic ‘heat death’, a fi nal equilibration.   In ‘The Persian King’, Hinton never explicitly mentioned the fourth dimension;  rather, he created an allegory about entropy. These two concepts were fi rst linked a  decade earlier in an 1875 text by physicists Balfour Stewart and Peter Guthrie Tait, in   The Unseen Universe; or, Physical Speculations on a Future State . This text was widely popular: it  was in its fourth edition within a year of  initial publication. Stewart and Tait attempted  to bridge the expanding rift between the discourses of  science and religion; T he Unseen  Universe was written as a challenge to the materialist school of  science, and specifi cally in  response to John Tyndall’s 1874 Belfast Address to the British Association, in which he  argued that the relation of  religion to scientifi c culture was ‘grotesque’, and that religious  irrationality, ‘if  permitted to intrude on the region of   knowledge , over which it holds no  command’ would be a ‘mischievous’ and ‘destructive’ force.3 9   Stewart and Tait were particularly concerned with challenging the materialist denial  of  life after death:   Take away all hope of  a future state, – appear to demonstrate, if  not with absolute certainty,  yet with an approach to it, that such a condition of  things is antagonistic to well- understood  scientifi c principles, and we feel certain that the eff ect upon humanity would be simply  disastrous.   [...] We attempt to show that we are absolutely driven by scientifi c principles to acknowledge  the existence of  an Unseen Universe, and by scientifi c analogy to conclude that it is full of  life  and intelligence – that it is in fact a spiritual universe and not a dead one.4 0   The thought that there is nothing beyond the material, visible universe was particu- larly disturbing in the second half  of  the nineteenth century, after William Thomson’s  publication of  ‘On the Universal Tendency in Nature to the Dissipation of  Mechanical  Energy’ (1852), in which he identifi ed entropic implications of  the second law of    38  J- J.

In one letter, Maxwell asked Tait to imagine a container of  gas  molecules, divided into two chambers; one has a higher level of  thermal energy than the  other. The demon is located within the closed container, at the dividing partition, and is  able to sort through the molecules by opening and closing a door within the partition- ing wall. By sorting the molecules so that those with lower thermal energy pass into the  warmer chamber, the demon is able to violate the second law of  thermodynamics. As  Clarke observes, ‘Thomson’s name “demon” was an inspired rhetorical choice’.4 3 The  ambiguous fi gure of  the demon – an unholy divine agent both intermediate and inter- mediary – is, in the case of  Maxwell’s ‘neat- fi ngered being’, a useful fi ction engendered  by the desire to re- imagine entropic process in terms other than those of  theological and  economic dissolution.   In T he Unseen Universe , Stewart and Tait rejected Maxwell’s thought- experiment and  its implications. Instead of  attempting to save the material universe, Stewart and Tait  dwelled on its inevitable and total destruction:   It thus appears that at each transformation of  heat- energy into work a large portion is  degraded, while only a small portion is transformed into work. So that while it is very easy to  change all of  our mechanical or useful energy into heat, it is only possible to transform a por- tion of  this heat- energy back again into work. After each change too the heat becomes more  and more dissipated or degraded, that is, less and less available [...].   But while the sun thus supplies us with energy he is himself  getting colder, and must ulti- mately, by radiation into space, part with the life- sustaining power which he at present pos- sesses. Besides the inevitable cooling of  the sun we must also suppose that owing to something  analogous to ethereal friction the earth and the other planets of  our system will be drawn spi- rally nearer and nearer to the sun, and will at length be engulfed in his mass. [...] At length,  however, this process will have come to an end, and he will be extinguished until, after long  but not immeasurable ages, by means of  the same ethereal friction his black mass is brought  into contact with that of  one or more of  his nearer neighbours.   Not much further need we dilate on this.4 4   However, Stewart and Tait cannot seem to leave the subject alone: they continued into  the next section to ponder the   mighty catastrophes due to the crashing together of  defunct suns  – the smashing of  the  greater part of  each into nebulous dust surrounding the remainder, which will form an   41  See also Clarke, ‘Dark Star Crashes’, and Beer, O pen Fields .   42  Maxwell, T he Scientifi c Letters , 2: 332.   43  Clarke, ‘Allegories’, 69.   44  Stewart and Tait, T he Unseen Universe , 126– 27.  </page> <page sequence="12"> 56 56 BEFORE EINSTEIN  intensely heated nucleus – then, possibly, the formation of  a new and larger set of  planets  with a proportionately larger and hotter sun, a solar system on a far grander scale than the  present. And so on, growing in grandeur but diminishing in number till the exhaustion of   energy is complete, and after that eternal rest.4 5   Stewart and Tait needed to remind their readers of  the threat of  impending cosmic  death as the result of  universal degeneration via entropic dissipation. While, as Hayles  explains, much of  the rhetoric of  physical science writing in the second half  of  the cen- tury contained implicit ‘connotations that link these scientifi c predictions with the com- plex connections among repressive morality, capital formation, and industrialization in  Victorian society’, Stewart and Tait made the perceived moral and theological implica- tions of  entropy explicit.4 6 We live in a fallen m aterial universe, Stewart and Tait argued,  and nothing can reverse this. Here ‘the physical concepts of  dissipation and equilibration  [are] infused with the moral contents of  sin and death’. Stewart and Tait acknowledged  Maxwell’s demon in their text, but they managed to ‘evade the threat it posed to their  particular moralization of  thermodynamics’.4 7   The only hope for redemption, Stewart and Tait argued, is in another, immaterial or  quasi- material, ‘unseen universe’, the existence of  which is supported by ‘scientifi c anal- ogy’ and by what Stewart and Tait referred to as the ‘Principle of  Continuity’. Creating  an analogy that is loosely based on Thomson’s ring- vortex theory, Stewart and Tait  hypothesized the existence of  an unseen universe:4 8   Let us begin by supposing an intelligent agent in the present universe [...] to be developing  vortex rings – smoke rings let us imagine [...] just as the smoke- ring was developed out of   ordinary molecules, so let us imagine ordinary molecules to be developed as vortex rings out  of  something much fi ner and more subtle than themselves, which we have agreed to call the  invisible universe.4 9   By the fourth edition of  their text in 1876, this unseen universe had become located in  the fourth dimension. Unlike the anthropomorphic dimensional anthology that sug- gests we look for beings similar to ourselves in another, more limited plane of  existence,  Stewart and Tait proposed examining the movement of  particles at the submolecular  level. There was nothing, they contended, in scientifi c theory to disprove the existence  of  a ‘fi ner and more subtle’ invisible universe. Thus, on the assumption that it does in  fact exist:   45  Ibid., 127– 28.   46  Hayles, C haos Bound , 39.   47  Clarke, ‘Allegories’, 76 and 82.   48  After observing the movement of  smoke rings in Tait’s laboratory experiments, Thomson for- mulated a theory of  ‘vortex atoms’, emphasizing their indestructibility. Thomson’s work in this  area has been cited as a precursor to string theory, the Theory of  Everything and knot theory.  See Silver, ‘Knot Theory’s Odd Origins’.   49  Stewart and Tait, U nseen Universe , 217– 18.  </page> <page sequence="13">    57  CONSTRUCTING THE FOURTH DIMENSION 57  so we may suppose our (essentially three- dimensional) matter to be the mere skin or boundary  of  an Unseen whose matter has f our dimensions [...] but may itself  consist of  four- dimensional  boundaries of  the fi ve- dimensional matter of  a higher Unseen, and so on.5 0   This is the ‘redemption’ of  the visible universe in which we currently reside: ‘We shall be  led to a universe possessing infi nite energy, and of  which the developing agency possesses  infi nite energy’.5 1 The fact that the word ‘energy’ appears so often in this text is itself   indicative of  late nineteenth- century anxieties concerning the heat death of  the universe.  Here the fourth dimension is a transcendent, quasi- material realm that functions as a  safety net for dissipated energy lost to the visible universe.   ‘The Persian King; or, the Law of  the Valley’   Stewart and Tait’s unseen universe allowed them to argue that life after death was not sci- entifi cally impossible, while maintaining that the material, visible universe was coming to an  end, with all the theological and moral implications that entailed. While Hinton’s narrative  of  the Persian king was clearly infl uenced by Stewart and Tait’s text, he was not invested  in shoring up Christian theology here. ‘The Persian King’ is about entropy and, using the  fourth dimension, Hinton found another way around the second law of  thermodynamics by  ‘reversing its moral polarity’.5 2 In this story, the dissipation of  energy is read as the necessary  condition for all life and creativity.   ‘The Persian King’ is divided into two parts. The fi rst part is a narrative about a Persian  king who becomes trapped in a remote valley of  his kingdom and, it is implied, dies. In  this otherworldly, isolated valley, the king is approached by a mysterious old man named  Demiourgos, who describes himself  as ‘the maker of  men’.5 3 Demiourgos provides the king  with a pair of  child- like beings to supervise. The children remain inert until Demiourgos  instructs the king on how to control them by manipulating their physical sensations:   [Demiourgos] explained to the king how it could be possible to stimulate the children to activ- ity, for he showed him how he could divest anything that was done of  part of  its pain and  render it more pleasurable than painful. ‘In this way thou canst lead the beings I have given  thee to do anything,’ said the old man, ‘but the condition is that thou must take the painful  part that thou sparest them thyself ’. 54   In Hinton’s narrative, the Demiurge, the Platonic creator of  the world, is merged with  the limited Demiurge of  Gnostic philosophy, which is described as a craftsman who  assists in creating the world by fashioning the raw materials provided by the Supreme   50  Ibid., 220, original emphasis.   51  Ibid., 220.   52  Clarke, E nergy Forms , 111.   53  Hinton, ‘The Persian King’, S cientifi c Romances , 35.   54  Ibid., 39.  </page> <page sequence="14"> 58 58 BEFORE EINSTEIN  Being.5 5 The beings Hinton’s Demiourgos produces are limited because they are subject  to ‘a law [...] which binds them in sleepfulness and powerlessness’.5 6 In Hinton’s ‘fallen’  material universe, it is the king who must stimulate the beings provided by Demiourgos  by bearing a portion of  their pain.   In the second part of  this romance Hinton explains the narrative in relation to ther- modynamics, electrodynamic fi eld theory and the concept of  the luminiferous ether.  However, even in the fi rst part of  the story, Hinton frequently interrupts the narrative to  explain the physics concepts he is using. It is clear early on in the narrative that Hinton  is using the pleasure and pain dynamics of  the valley as an allegory for thermodynam- ics: ‘The smallest particle there is in the valley lies [...] without motion. Each particle has  the power of  feeling pain and of  feeling pleasure, but by the law of  the valley these are  equal. Hence of  itself  no particle moves’, Demiourgos explains.5 7 Every activity under- taken by the valley- dwellers entails undertaking an equal amount of  pleasure and pain;  so long as these sensations remain equal, the valley beings will remain in a state of  inac- tivity. By absorbing a fraction of  the painful part of  the activity, the king disturbs the  deadening equilibrium, stimulating the valley- dwellers into action.   The king devises a system for directing these valley- dwellers in increasingly complex  movements and activities by combining simpler, repetitive actions:   As the type of  fundamental activity, he chose an action and made the being go through it  again and again. Thus the being would go through the act A, then act B. When the action AB  was complete it would go through an act of  the kind A again, then through an act of  the kind  B. Thus the creature would be engaged in a routine of  this kind, AB, AB, AB, and so on.5 8   Here Hinton relied on an associationist psychological understanding of  the nervous sys- tem. According to Victorian associationist psychologist Alexander Bain, human brains  are educated by performing a set of  actions in quick succession so that they eventually  become automatically and physiologically linked, such as the kind of  coordinated actions  one performs when walking or playing a musical instrument. In his infl uential text, T he  Senses and the Intellect (1855), Bain wrote:   A stream of  conscious energy, no matter how stimulated, causes a muscular contraction,  a second stream plays upon another muscle; and the fact that these currents fl ow together   55  See Herbermann et al., ed., T he Catholic Encyclopedia , 4: 707– 8. Clarke makes the connection  between Hinton’s use of  Demiourgos and Plato’s T imœus , in  Energy Forms (178). According to  the  OED , ‘Demiourgous’, ‘Demiurgus’ and ‘Demiurge’ are all variables of  the same Greek  word, defi ned as ‘a name for the Maker or Creator of  the world, in the Platonic Philosophy; in  certain later systems, as the Gnostic, conceived as a being subordinated to the Supreme Being  and sometimes the author of  evil’. See  OED Online [accessed 21 May 2014]. Literally trans- lated, Demiourgos means ‘public worker’, and ‘was originally used to designate any craftsman  plying his craft or trade for the use of  the public’ (Herbermann et al., 707).   56  Hinton, ‘The Persian King’, S cientifi c Romances , 38.   57  Ibid., 42.   58  Ibid., 56.  </page> <page sequence="15">    59  CONSTRUCTING THE FOURTH DIMENSION 59 through the brain is suffi  cient to make a partial fusion of  the two, which in time becomes a  total fusion, so that one cannot be commenced without the other commencing also. 59   According to this physio- psychological approach, the commands for two separate bodily  actions can become ‘fused’ within the brain so that performance of  one action will always  trip the other, like a switch. Associationist psychology is underpinned by a mechanis- tic, utilitarian understanding of  human physiology and psychology. Drawing on Jeremy  Bentham’s theory that sentient beings are primarily driven by the opposing sensations of   pleasure and pain, Bain argued that ‘pain is what we avoid, repel, fl ee from; pleasure is  what we cling to and labour to increase’. 60 In controlling the amounts of  pleasure and  pain the valley- dwellers experience, Hinton’s Persian king works on the assumptions of   both Bain and Bentham. Unaware of  the king’s presence and feeling only the eff ects  of  the king’s manipulations, the valley- dwellers construct a utilitarian understanding of   themselves and their world. According to the narrator, ‘the inhabitants knew that they  sought pleasure and avoided pain, and the great object was to make their life more plea- surable’; they also knew that ‘sensation was passing off  into a form from which it never  reappeared [...], hence they concluded that sensation in the valley was gradually running  down’.6 1   Misunderstanding the cause of  all their actions, and thus their survival, the valley-  dwellers fear that when all sensation has been lost they will fall into apathy which, in their  world, inevitably leads to death. Hinton never explicitly mentioned the fourth dimension  in ‘The Persian King’; rather, he used commonly accepted nineteenth- century scientifi c  theories to construct an allegory that is actually a subtle critique of  the epistemology  out of  which those very theories arose. Here Hinton pushed through the second law of   thermodynamics, inverting the implications of  dissipation. The pain- absorbing Persian  king is the ‘permission’ that allows for all life and development in the valley rather than  ‘the gradual annihilation of  life’, which is how the scientists of  the valley interpret his  actions.6 2  A t the time in which the main narrative is set, the civilization of  the valley is a secular,  scientifi c society. The plot begins to take shape when a university student in the valley’s  metropolis is exiled to the outer, rural regions of  the civilization as punishment for ques- tioning one of  the fundamental physical laws of  the valley. The student encounters the  folk beliefs of  the rural agricultural workers, who are still somewhat superstitious and  acknowledge the existence of  the Persian king. However, the rural valley- dwellers also  misinterpret the king’s role in that they understand him to be an omniscient presence that  is pained by any pleasure experienced by the inhabitants of  the valley: ‘They thought it  pained him when they had pleasure, but not in the way in which was really the case. They  thought simply that it was pain to him to see them taking pleasure’.6 3 The student is able   59  Bain, T he Senses , 325.   60  Ibid., 89.   61  Hinton, ‘The Persian King’, S cientifi c Romances , 64 and 70– 71.   62  Ibid., 71.   63  Ibid., 78.  </page> <page sequence="16"> 60 60 BEFORE EINSTEIN  to apply his scientifi c education to the mythology of  the rural valley- dwellers in order to  discover the truth of  the king:   Now the student saw clearly some errors, some contradictions in their belief. For instance, he  knew that beings only followed pleasure, and directly pleasure was equalled by pain, sank into  apathy, and then gradually vanished away. Hence, he knew there need be no apprehension of   the power’s acting as they thought. He did not approve of  the results in their life, for it was in  consequence very gloomily framed [...]. But he knew as a scientifi c fact that there was con- stant diminution of  feeling; and since he also knew that beings in the valley did nothing except  it was more pleasant, he concluded that although pleasure and pain might both be disappear- ing, still pain must be disappearing to a greater extent. Now since the feeling did not become  nothing, but passed away out of  the perception of  the inhabitants, it followed that it must pass  away to some being. It did not disappear as feeling, but passed away from the sensation of  the  inhabitants. Is there a being, then, he asked himself – the power of  whom these simple folks  tell – who bears the diff erence of  pain, and so makes existence pleasant to us? And is that the  meaning of  what they say that our pleasure pains him? Is it just the truth read backwards[?]6 4   Here Hinton began to challenge the confl ation of  scientifi c epistemology with religious  ontology that resulted in the moralization of  the second law of  thermodynamics. The  student is able to work out the actual meaning of  the king’s action and thus transcend  the pleasure/ pain dynamics that underpin the valley- dwellers’ utilitarian understanding of   themselves and their world. To understand pain not as a motivating psychological force, but  rather as an epistemological eff ect, is to recognize the limited nature of  scientifi c epistemol- ogy in the valley, just as the valley’s scientists recognize the limits of  rural religious folklore.   The dogmatic, and thus limited, nature of  both science and religion is a theme that  recurs throughout Hinton’s work.6 5 The very title of  his S cientifi c Romances is signifi cant  for its combination of  two opposing discourses:  science, or realism, which prioritizes  objective observation and empirical evidence, and romance, or fantasy, which celebrates  intuition and the imaginative capabilities of  the individual subject. Here, again, we see  the infl uence of  James Hinton’s lawbreaker: Hinton, like the student, challenged the  second law of  thermodynamics and, by extension, the theological implications attached  to it. To some extent the pain- bearing king also demonstrates James Hinton’s notion of   service; certainly the conclusion that personal pleasure is not inherently morally suspect  was infl uenced by James Hinton’s philosophy.   Earlier in the history of  the valley, before the student discovered the truth, the Persian  king had revealed himself  and his work to another valley- dweller, a prince. The king  made contact with the prince, Hinton explains, because he was lonely. The king selected  the prince because he, too, was ‘destined to reign in his turn over a numerous people’.6 6   64  Ibid., 78– 79.   65  In his fi nal text, which was in press at the time of  his death, A n Episode of  Flatland , Hinton’s  autobiographical character, Hugh Farmer, rails against the dogmatism of  theology, continuing  on to remark that ‘the dogmatism of  scientifi c men is stronger than the dogmatism of  religion’  (73– 74).   66  Hinton, ‘The Persian King’, S cientifi c Romances , 52.  </page> <page sequence="17">    61  CONSTRUCTING THE FOURTH DIMENSION 61 To further increase the prince’s understanding, the king bestowed upon him the power  of  bearing pain of  the other valley- dwellers. However, the king’s revelation to the prince  had disastrous results. The prince was unable to cope with his newfound knowledge:   ‘One thing succeeds another in the valley; pain follows pleasure, and pleasure follows  pain. But the cause of  all being is in bearing pain. Wherefore,’ he cried, ‘let us seek an  end to this show. Let us pray to be delivered, that at last, pain ceasing, we may pass into  nothingness.’6 7   The student reacts very diff erently to his discovery; he does not ‘look upon nothingness as  the desired end of  existence. He felt the presence of  one he discerned through thought,  and this seemed more real to him than life or death’.6 8   The diff erence in the reactions of  the prince and the student result from the diff er- ence in the ways in which they learn of  the king: the king reveals his powers to the pas- sive prince, while the student must undergo a process of  learning unassisted by the silent  and unseen king. After living with the rural valley- dwellers and learning of  their beliefs,  the student studies a number of  historical and scientifi c texts, undergoing a period of   speculation and introspection that leads to his discovery of  the king. Having come to  the conclusion that the rural valley- dwellers have simply read the truth ‘backwards’, the  student goes out walking alone one night. Unlike the prince, the student does not receive  any direct communication from the king:   Now it may be considered surprising that the king did not communicate in some way with the  student, for by means of  his rays he was in possession of  all that had gone on in his mind. But  the king had found over and over again that if  he manifested himself  to any one of  the inhab- itants of  the valley, the eff ect, though good at the immediate time, was most disastrous for the  following time. [...] So when the student went out into the open air he saw nothing except  the stars, and heard nothing except the wind. [...] He had not gone far when he saw a kind  of  luminousness. Is the moon beginning to rise? He thought. But he found he had passed the  light and was leaving it behind. He could not have passed the moon thus. He went towards  the light, and when he had reached it, it seemed like a slender staff  of  light.6 9   This staff  of  light allows the student to share in the king’s pain- bearing ability, as the  student quickly discovers through a process of  trial and error. The king neither appears  nor speaks to the student at any time. Unlike the prince who acquires the knowledge of   the king by revelation – a ‘divine right’ of  sorts – the student must learn and earn for  himself  knowledge of  the king; it is the process of  discovery that prepares him for this  knowledge.7 0   67  Ibid., 53.   68  Ibid., 98.   69  Ibid., 80.   70  The diff erences between the prince and student are also legible as analogous to an opposition  of  Judaism to Christianity that privileges the latter. The prince, like Moses, is the passive recipi- ent of  the king’s revelation, while the student must work it out for himself, as an ‘everyman’. In  </page> <page sequence="18"> 62 62 BEFORE EINSTEIN   The student is therefore able to fully comprehend the king’s role in the valley: he does  not confl ate the king’s action of  absorbing pain with the notion of  an omnipotent ‘fi rst  cause’. In his attempts to explain the nature of  the king’s action to a friend, the student  observes that ‘a cloak has been woven. The nature of  [the king] is hidden. His nature has  been connected with introspective questions about the origin – of, of  all things, the way  in which we perceive’.7 1 Here we return to Hinton’s larger project of  accessing the fourth  dimension. The Persian king is an allegorical representation of  the fourth dimension,  that – as in Stewart and Tait’s unseen universe – absorbs the energy lost to the visible  universe. The student must learn of  the fourth dimension without divine assistance; in  feeling ‘the presence of  one he discerned through thought’, the student fi nds something  ‘more real to him than life or death’. By making what Hinton’s contemporary, John  Tyndall, described as ‘a leap of  the prepared imagination’, the student is able to discover  ‘a world not less real than that of  the sense, and of  which the world of  sense itself  is the  suggestion and justifi cation’.7 2   Because he occupies the world behind the senses, the king has become associated  with the omnipotent and the supernatural, but he is neither of  these. The king is  limited, and the fact that the valley- dwellers refuse to accept the student’s discovery  and eventually execute him for his radical beliefs seems to be a reaction informed  by the earlier religious teachings in the valley. The notion that such a being exists  and that he condones the suff ering of  the inhabitants of  the valley – or worse, yet,  is incapable of  preventing suff ering – is possibly more disturbing than the presumed  non- existence of  the king. Such is the view of  the student’s friend: ‘This seems to me  a very dismal doctrine. I can imagine some poetry in the idea of  a being of  infi nite  power, strong and glorious, but none in the idea of  a suff ering being’.7 3 The sublime  idea of  infi nite power, the ‘poetry’ of  an omnipotent king, is the pathetic fallacy that  lies at the root of  the problematic nature of  epistemology within the valley, as the  student observes:   Whatever we apprehend, we apprehend as powerful. Now since this quality of  powerful  comes in with regard to everything, it is probably introduced by the mind, and is rather a part  of  the mental action in giving an idea of  reality than a quality of  reality. [...] Of  course, if   we think of  [the king] at all, we must conceive of  him as powerful; t he nature of  our mental action  demands this .7 4  this reading, the prince’s failure to discover self- determination through a kind of  Nietzschean  will- to- power (or, perhaps, more appropriately a ‘will- to- passivity’), parallels Moses’s failure to  enter the Promised Land. Like Jesus, the student is denied the king’s assistance, even when he  is martyred. Unlike Jesus, however, the martyring of  the student does not result in salvation  for the valley- dwellers; rather, their refusal to acknowledge his message of  self- determination  results in the collapse of  their civilization.   71  Ibid., 85.   72  Tyndall, F ragments , 128 and 132.   73  Hinton, ‘The Persian King’, S cientifi c Romances , 83.   74  Ibid., 85, emphasis added.  </page> <page sequence="19">    63  CONSTRUCTING THE FOURTH DIMENSION 63  Instructive here is Ernst Cassirer’s concept of  ‘momentary gods’ created   when external reality is not merely viewed and contemplated, but overcomes a man in sheer  immediacy [...] then the spark jumps somehow across, the tension fi nds release, as the subjec- tive excitement becomes objectifi ed, and confronts the mind as a god or daemon.7 5   Drawing on Victorian philologist Max Müller, Cassirer argued that these ‘momentary  gods’ are at the root of  human language and epistemology. Hinton viewed this as the  limited ‘nature of  our mental action’ and wanted to push beyond it. In overcoming the  pathetic fallacy with reference to the action of  the invisible king, the student of  ‘The  Persian King’ surpasses Ruskin’s highest order of  poet. He has become a sort of  hyper-  perceiver, one who has faced forces ‘inconceivably above’ him and not seen ‘untruly’.7 6  The king is no god for the student, momentary or otherwise. However, the king – as a  representative of  the fourth dimension in this story – shares affi  nity with the demon of   Maxwell’s thought experiment.   Maxwell’s proposition highlighted what Clarke calls the ‘crucial if  debatable obser- vation that entropy is [...] an epistemological eff ect, a product of  the limitations of   human perception[,] for instance, our inability to manipulate matter at the molecu- lar level’.7 7 Hinton was also concerned with exposing the limitations of  both scientifi c  and religious epistemologies, with their shared emphases on origins and endings. In the  direct discourse that forms the second part of  ‘The Persian King’, Hinton unpacked his  allegory, explaining that in the physical sciences, ‘we have thought of  motion as a thing  in itself  impaired by the multitudinous obstacles it meets in the world’. 78 The result of   interaction between objects is friction; through friction, a small portion of  heat that is  generated is dissipated, never again to be accessible. But rather than stop here, where  the science of  thermodynamics – limited as it is by the three-d imensional, linear tem- poral logic of  both science and theology – does ‘let us look on the circumstances more  impartially. Let us look on them as something co-e qual with motion. Let us fi nd in that  mode whereby all motion comes to an end[,] the originating cause also whereby all  motion comes to be’. 79   The king animates the valley by a paradoxical act of  will- to- passivity; he is ‘bear- ing rather than exerting force’.8 0 The force itself  does not originate with the king,  who actually functions as an absence, a void that allows sensation to ‘pass off ’. As the  king bears a portion of  the painful sensation of  all actions for the valley- dwellers –  creating an imbalance in sensation that initiates a prompt to action – so does the   75  Cassirer, L anguage and Myth , 33.   76  Ruskin, W orks , 5: 209.   77  Clarke, E nergy Forms , 119.   78  Hinton, ‘The Persian King’, S cientifi c Romances , 108.   79  Ibid., 108.   80  Ibid., 127.  </page> <page sequence="20"> 64 64 BEFORE EINSTEIN  disappearance of  heat in the three- dimensional universe allow for movement. Hinton  explained:   The ultimate transformation of  all energy of  motion is into the form of  heat. [...] This  passing of  energy into the form of  heat must not be regarded as a side circumstance, as less  essential to the laws of  nature than that law we call the conservation of  energy. 81   In Hinton’s interpretation, what is perceived by most as deadly chaos is actually a posi- tive, creative force. This void is constitutive, similar to the transvaluation of  negative  space that Stephen Kern identifi es as characteristic of  the early modernist aesthetic:   The traditional view that space was an inert void in which objects existed gave way to a new  view of  it as active and full. [...] I will refer to this new conception as ‘positive negative space.’  Art critics describe the subject of  a painting as positive space and the background itself  as  negative space. ‘Positive negative space’ implies that the background itself  is a positive ele- ment, of  equal importance with all others. 82   This shift in perception is indicative of  the beginnings of  a trend of  acceptance and even  celebration of  disorder and the relativity of  perception and, as Clarke observes:  ‘This  unusual championing of  dissipative processes – an appreciation for, rather than denigra- tion of, friction and resistance – is the truly predictive portion of  Hinton’s text’.8 3   Hinton’s treatment of  causation is equally indicative of  the shift away from the model  of  reliance on a singular deity possessing ‘infi nite energy’, as we see in Stewart and Tait’s  theological cosmology. ‘In past times’, according to Hinton,   people really felt sure about certain things being causes which we now know had a very slight  connection with the result. Incantations have been supposed to have an eff ect on physical  phenomena, such as eclipses. [...] To say one external event is the cause of  another is to put  an absolutely unknown and spiritual relation in the place of  impartial observations. [...] To  be the antecedent in a chain of  movements is the fact which we can observe about any move- ment in the external world. We cannot strictly say what movements of  gases, water, &amp;c. cause  this volcano. We can only say what movements of  gases, water &amp;c., precede this volcanic  eruption analogous to movements which have preceded other volcanoes.8 4   Physical events in the external world do not function as causes in themselves, Hinton  argued. When writing of  a ‘true’ causal relationship, he described it as a ‘spiritual and  unknown relation’: ‘To cause a motion is the name for the action of  our soul upon mat- ter’.8 5 Here causation involves an act of  human will: ‘W e are the cause of  actions we will.  The notion of  a cause is derived from our “will” action, and the notion of  cause ought to   81  Ibid., 107.   82  Kern, T he Culture of  Time and Space , 153.   83  Clarke, E nergy Forms , 120.   84  Hinton, ‘The Persian King’, 108– 10.   85  Ibid., 110.  </page> <page sequence="21">    65  CONSTRUCTING THE FOURTH DIMENSION 65 be kept to this connection’.8 6 Therefore, when observing a chain of  events in the external  world, it is impossible to attribute a ‘theory of  mind’ to any particular event.8 7 However,  omitting causation ‘from the external chain of  events’ does not necessarily preclude the  possibility of  any agency in the external world, according to Hinton: ‘Let us not intro- duce the notion of  causation at haphazard. But if  we fi nd in the external world signs of   an action like our own will action, let us then say, Here is causation’. 88 To be a source of   ‘true’ causation – in the context of  Hinton’s greater project – is to be a ‘four- dimensional  agency’.   Nevertheless, this four- dimensional agency should not be read as necessarily implying  a divine fi rst cause. Hinton had already suggested that human beings are actually four-  dimensional agents in ‘What Is the Fourth Dimension?’. As I observed in the  previous  chapter , there is an avoidance of  discussion of  origins in much writing about the fourth  dimension, Hinton’s included. While Hinton often described the fourth dimension as if  it  were t he transcendent metaspace, throughout his work he simultaneously undermined any  attempt to read hyperspace philosophy as an absolutist project. This tension is observable  throughout Hinton’s work, and in ‘The Persian King’ we can observe the open- endedness  of  Hinton’s project in the relationship between the king and Demiourgos. This relation- ship is collaborative, as is, by analogy, the relationship between Hinton and the reader.  Although it is through the agency of  the king that the valley- dwellers are animated, he  is not the cause of  their existence. The king merely sets the beings into motion by fol- lowing Demiourgos’s instructions; Demiourgos has created them by playing music on his  pipe. Demiourgos’s powers are similarly limited; he is neither able to animate the valley-  dwellers himself, nor can he create them so that they will be self- animating. Therefore,  we cannot observe a singular ‘fi rst cause’ within this narrative, and it is here again that we  encounter the limits of  language. A fi rst cause cannot be explained by analogy because  nothing corresponds to it. Thus, as Cassirer observed, Yahweh of  the O ld Testament can  only explain himself  to Moses as ‘I am that I am’. 89 This is pure tautology, and can be  extended to a meaningless infi nite series.   According to Hinton, the only way to make such an infi nite series cognizable is to  impose an artifi cial limit on it, usually through the device of  personifi cation. Hinton  acknowledged the false limitations he sets up in ‘The Persian King’, writing that, when  using the king as a personifi cation of  ‘an ultimate medium’, ‘it must be remembered that  this conception of  an ultimate medium was merely a supposition to enable us to see and  roughly map out the relations of  the things we were investigating. Where we were really  landed was an infi nite series’.9 0 According to Hinton, an infi nite series typically appears  as a result of  using fl awed instruments of  measurement or observation. Hinton turned to  algebra for an example: ‘Infi nite series occur when the object which it is wanted to repre- sent in algebraical terms cannot be grasped by the algebra’. Just as algebra breaks down   86  Ibid., 108, emphasis added.   87  See Zunshine, W hy We Read Fiction .   88  Hinton, ‘The Persian King’, S cientifi c Romances , 110– 11.   89  Cassirer, L anguage and Myth , 77.   90  Hinton, ‘The Persian King’, S cientifi c Romances , 120.  </page> <page sequence="22"> 66 66 BEFORE EINSTEIN  when it tries to represent the ‘trigonometrical idea’ of  c osine x , language, which is based  on the presently limited perceptual abilities of  the three- dimensional human conscious- ness, begins to break down when it encounters the fourth dimension. In algebra, ‘when  there is no single term or set [...] which will serve, the object is represented by means of   an infi nite series’.9 1 Thus, working with a similarly limited instrument (language) Hinton  provided the reader with a series – multiple though not infi nite – of  texts, each of  which  presents a diff erent perspective on the fourth dimension.   The personifi cation of  the king is used in the fi rst part of  ‘The Persian King’ because it is  diffi  cult to describe or explain a void or absence in the place of  a divine agent. This diffi  culty  arises out of  one of  the limitations of  language which, as Beer has observed, ‘is anthropo- centric. It places man [s ic ] at the centre of  signifi cation’.9 2 Thus, there are no ‘terms’ that can  grasp such a concept as Hinton’s void in the place of  a divine agent, just as in ‘What Is the  Fourth Dimension?’ he struggles to describe the appearance of  a four- dimensional object.  Hinton’s hyperspace philosophy paradoxically supports and undermines humanism. On the  one hand Hinton is like Derrida’s b ricoleur in that his hyperspace philosophy is ‘no longer  turned toward the origin’, and his methodology in the S cientifi c Romances   affi  rms freeplay and tries to pass beyond man and humanism, the name man being the name  of  that being who [...] through the history of  all his history – has dreamed of  the full pres- ence, the reassuring foundation, the origin and the end of  the game. 93   On the other hand, Hinton argued that human beings are capable of  transcending  their current limitations and realizing their hyperbeing potential as four- dimensional  agents.   Hinton described those who possess this four- dimensional consciousness as ‘true  personalities, conscious of  being true selves, the oneness of  them lying in the [fourth  dimension], but each spontaneous in himself  and absolute will, not to be merged in any  other’.9 4 The student in ‘The Persian King’ attains this status and, like the king, is able to  absorb the pain of  others through a kind of  will- to- passivity. Thus, the student becomes a  true agent of  causation; it is because of  this that the politicians and scholars of  the valley  fi nd him threatening and repugnant. ‘He made me feel like a puppet’, one council mem- ber complains, and even the student’s friend admits that ‘he seems to lack the ordinary  springs of  motive’. Fearing his infl uence on the community, that they too may become  ‘diffi  cult to govern’ if  they transcend their mechanical existence of  pursuing pleasure and  avoiding pain, the council has the student executed.9 5   After the student’s death, the king departs from the valley because, he explains, he is  ‘weary’. The fate of  the valley- dwellers is the same as that proposed by Stewart, Tait and  other proponents of  cosmic heat death:   91  Ibid., 121.   92  Beer, D arwin’s Plots , 47.   93  Derrida, ‘Structure’, 254.   94  Hinton, ‘The Persian King’, S cientifi c Romances , 128.   95  Ibid., 93– 94.  </page> <page sequence="23">    67  CONSTRUCTING THE FOURTH DIMENSION 67  As soon as the king had departed from the valley the beings in it began to sink into the same  state of  apathy as those were whom he had fi rst found there. [...] A chill death in life crept  over the land. ’Tis useless to ask after the fate of  any one of  those that were there, for each  was involved in the same calamity that overwhelmed all. [...] The busy hum of  life in the  streets was hushed. [...] In every spot was such unbroken quiet as might have been had all  the inhabitants gone to some great festival. But here was no return of  life. No watchful eye,  no ready hand was there to stay the slight but constant inroads of  ruin and decay. The roads  became choked with grass, the earth encroached on the buildings, till in the slow consuming  course of  time all was buried – houses, fi elds, and cities vanished, till at length no trace was  left of  aught that had been there. 96   In refusing to acknowledge the limited nature of  their current lives, the council members  of  the valley damn themselves to a universal death. For Hinton, the struggle to transcend  the three- dimensional is not the same as Stewart and Tait’s redemption through ‘a uni- verse possessing infi nite energy’, with a ‘developing agency [which] possesses infi nite  energy’.9 7 Rather, the reader – like Hinton’s student – is encouraged to use both ‘modes  of  access’ to the king/ fourth dimension: one is through empirical knowledge of  the out- side world, or scientifi c understanding, and the other is through the self, or Romantic  introspection. To succeed in this endeavour is to become a kind of  hyperbeing, a true  personality, unable to be infl uenced by god or human.   ‘Casting Out the Self ’   The fi nal text within the fi rst series of  the S cientifi c Romances provides Hinton’s fi rst attempt  to access the fourth dimension through practical exercises with model cubes. Here the  reader is guided through the manipulation of  27 cubes, whereby, through an act of  aes- thetic will, they are to ‘cast out the self ’. Again we can see the oppositional forces within  Hinton’s hyperspace philosophy: the stated purpose of  the cube exercise in ‘Casting Out  the Self ’ is to strip the thinking subject of  its subjectivity, to break down the boundary  between self  and other. The problem is that to actually accomplish such a task would  involve annihilation of  the self, to become Ruskin’s paradoxical invisible man. Thus,  Hinton’s project partakes of  the ‘suicidal narrative of  knowledge’ that George Levine  identifi es as particularly resonant in nineteenth- century scientifi c culture.9 8 In ‘Casting  Out the Self ’ Hinton proposed a radical deconstruction of  the self  while at the same time  anxiously guarding against total dissolution by maintaining agency through emphasis on  the manipulation of  physical objects. Here Hinton was attempting to expel what he saw  as a false limitation on human consciousness: the three- dimensional self.   What Hinton viewed as an extractive (‘casting out’), deconstructive activity in this  text actually becomes a creative process; the manipulation of  cubes in ‘Casting Out the  Self ’ is analogous to the reading process that is engendered by the genre variation within   96  Ibid., 101.   97  Stewart and Tait, T he Unseen Universe , 220.   98  Levine, D ying , 5.  </page> <page sequence="24"> 68 68 BEFORE EINSTEIN   Scientifi c Romances . In his hyperspace philosophy Hinton seemed to be simultaneously  questioning and guarding against the unexpected and accidental. As Bell has noted, to  question is to foreground the liminal nature of  subjectivity. By stripping away the three-  dimensional self, Hinton sought to construct a daemonic four- dimensional subject that  necessarily exists at the boundary of  things.   ‘Casting Out the Self ’ is the most explicitly collaborative of  all the texts in the fi rst  series: by instructing the reader through a number of  exercises with a set of  model cubes,  Hinton sought to change the reader’s intuition of  space from an unconscious activity  to a conscious one. To achieve this, it is necessary fi rst to become self- conscious, and  then to ‘cast out’ all elements of  self. At work here is what Levine identifi es as ‘a view  [that is] built into the idea that the senses that are the gateway to all knowledge must  be disciplined and checked in order to provide that knowledge’.9 9 Hinton called on the  reader to undergo a process, the function of  which is to deny the subject’s normal, three-  dimensional sensory perceptions in order to uncover what he claimed was a more direct,  unmediated encounter with ‘true’ knowledge: intuition of  the fourth dimension.   While in many ways Hinton’s hyperspace philosophy is directly opposed to Henri  Bergson’s l a durée pure , Bergson’s defi nition of  intuition in his I ntroduction to Metaphysics  (1903) is particularly apt here: ‘By intuition is meant the kind of  intellectual sympathy by  which one places oneself  within an object in order to coincide with what is unique in it  and consequently inexpressible’.1 00 Hinton wanted the reader to physically and psychi- cally identify with each cube, and in this way to ‘feel’ space. In this fi nal romance of  the  fi rst series, Hinton attempted to transcend analytical conception and perception of  the  fourth dimension, to gain an intuitive knowledge of  space that would allow for the four-  dimensional imagination to develop. Again, Bergson is useful here:   To analyse [...] is to express a thing as a function of  something other than itself. All analysis is  thus a translation, a development into symbols, a representation taken from successive points  of  view from which we note as many resemblances as possible between the new object we are  studying and others which we believe we know already.1 01   To intuit, by contrast, is to know the thing from the inside out. To intuit is to no longer  need to view the ‘slices’ of  the fourth dimension successively; rather, the intuitive encoun- ter with four- dimensional space allows the subject to surpass the Ruskinian imagination,  to see all of  the three- dimensional world simultaneously.   Hinton’s fi rst set of  cube exercises in ‘Casting Out the Self ’ appears to have grown  out of  a personal crisis of  knowledge: ‘The beginning of  it was this. I gradually came to  fi nd that I had no knowledge worth calling by that name, and that I had never thoroughly  understood anything which I had heard’.1 02 Hinton’s crisis of  knowledge seems to be    99  Ibid., 2.   100  Bergson, I ntroduction , 7.   101  Ibid., 6– 7.   102  C.

Hinton, ‘Casting Out’, S cientifi c Romances , 205.  </page> <page sequence="25">    69  CONSTRUCTING THE FOURTH DIMENSION 69 linked to a fear of  self- dissolution and to a growing sense of  mortality. The timing of  this  crisis is telling: in the text, Hinton describes it as occurring when he fi nished his formal  education. ‘Casting Out the Self ’ was originally published in 1886, the year he received  his MA. Hinton was already living away from Oxford, working at Uppingham College  as a mathematics instructor.1 03 It was also the year of  his bigamy conviction. However,  ‘Casting Out the Self ’ was composed before these events, and so, while the strain leading  up to these various upheavals was no doubt building, the period of  crisis he refers to is  more likely to have occurred in the previous decade when another series of  major life  events occurred: in 1875, Hinton’s father died; in 1876, he completed his undergraduate  work at Oxford; within the year he had taken a post at Cheltenham Ladies’ College as a  mathematics instructor, and in 1880 he married his fi rst and legal wife, Mary Ellen Boole.  Of  the timing of  this existential crisis, Hinton wrote:   I will not go into the matter further; simply this was what I found [that he knew nothing],  and at a time when I had fi nished the years set apart from acquiring knowledge, and was  far removed from contact with learned men. I could not take up my education again, but  although I regretted my lost opportunities I determined to know something. [...] And I would  earnestly urge all students to make haste in acquiring real knowledge while they are in the way  with those that can impart it; and not rush on too quickly, thinking that they can get knowl- edge afterwards. For out in the world knowledge is hard to fi nd.1 04   The sentiments expressed here are not atypical. Lacking, for the fi rst time in his life,  the structure provided by an institution of  formal education, the narrator appears to be  struggling against a sense of  self- dissolution, fi gured here as the sudden dissipation of  the  illusion of  knowledge. By undermining both his previously acquired knowledge and his  ability to obtain knowledge in the future, the Cartesian model of  the thinking subject is  thrown into radical doubt. He is also anxious about facing the challenge of  unstructured  learning: ‘Out in the world knowledge is hard to fi nd’.   Hinton found comfort by creating another, highly structured, process of  learning to  undertake. This bizarre form of  self- affi  rmation through self- abnegation resulted in his  cube exercises:  he began by memorizing the relative positions of  216 wooden cubes  arranged in such a way as to compose one larger cube. For practical reasons, in ‘Casting  Out the Self ’ Hinton reduced the number of  cubes needed to perform this exercise to 27,  arranged in a 3 × 3 × 3 unit. ‘Now’, he wrote,   this is the bit of  knowledge on which I propose to demonstrate the process of  casting out the  self. It is not a high form of  knowledge, but it is a bit of  knowledge with as little ignorance in  it as we can have; and just as it is permitted a worm or reptile to live and breathe, so on this  rudimentary form of  knowledge may we be able to demonstrate the functions of  the mind. 105   103  Ballard, ‘The Life and Thought’, 29.   104  Hinton, ‘Casting Out’, S cientifi c Romances , 206.   105  Ibid., 208.  </page> <page sequence="26"> 70 70 BEFORE EINSTEIN  25 26 27 16 17 18 7 8 9 7 8 9 9 18 27 4 5 6 6 15 24 1 2 3 12 21 3  Figure 2.1    Hinton could just as easily have written that ‘this is the bit of  knowledge’ on which he was  able to demonstrate the existence of  his subjectivity. By enabling himself  to ‘demonstrate  the functions’ of  the mind, Hinton confi rms the existence and the functioning of  h is  mind. In this text, he represents knowledge – ‘rudimentary’ though it may be – as being  indicative of  a functioning mind, which he compares to the basic activities that are neces- sary to life in evolutionarily ‘lower’ species. According to Hinton, this ‘bit of  knowledge’  is the knowledge of  space relations. The manipulation of  the cubes allows the subject to  demonstrate its knowledge of  the relations of  the blocks to each other while simultane- ously attempting to avoid any reference to the subject’s position to the block of  cubes as  an external reference point, or as an agent.   For example, Hinton explained, ‘if  I say cubes 1 and 2, I mean the two which lie next  to each other’ (Figure 2.1).1 06 The relation between these two cubes is the common side  between them. Hinton memorized the relations between all 27 of  the cubes, and then  began the process of  ‘casting out the self ’. ‘First of  all,’ he explained, ‘when I had learnt  the cubes, I found that I invariably associated some with the idea of  being above others.  When two names were said, I had the idea of  a direction of  up and down.’1 07 The idea of   up and down are what Hinton calls ‘self  elements’: ‘I only conceive of  an up and down in  virtue of  being on the earth’s surface, and because of  the frequent experience of  weight’.  This is a description of  the experience of  embodiment, what Hinton described as a  ‘condition aff ecting myself ’.1 08 The language here assumes a Cartesian dualism of  mind  and body, but Hinton’s cube exercise is an attempt to access a psychical, four- dimensional  self  that has been incorrectly fused with a three- dimensional body. While underlying  Hinton’s view is the assumption of  a transcendent, absolute reality, there is also space  here for the radical enumeration of  perspectives: the medium of  the three- dimensional  body causes the human mind to misapprehend one level of  dimensionality as an exclu- sively singular reality. There is an awareness here that human perception of  reality is not  absolute; perception is aff ected by physical factors ranging from simple diff erences, such   106  See Fig. 2.1, Hinton, ‘Casting Out’, S cientifi c Romances , 208.   107  Ibid., 208– 9.   108  Ibid., 209.  </page> <page sequence="27">    71  CONSTRUCTING THE FOURTH DIMENSION 71 as variations in eye placement across species to the intricacies of  neurological structure.  With this in mind, Hayles explains:   Our so- called observables are permeated at every level by assumptions located specifi cally in  how humans process information from their environments [...] it becomes clear that observ- ables really mean observations made by humans [...]. In short, we are always already within  the theater of  representation. 109   Hinton appeared to regard his cube exercises as a means of  stepping outside this theatre,  a problematic project, as this theatre – physical embodiment – is also the framework that  enables the human subject to exist. Hinton was not consciously seeking self- annihilation  in the form of  physical death; he did not seem to make this connection here. In his  view it is only by stepping out of  the theatre of  three- dimensional embodiment that one  can access the fourth dimension through the imagination. William J. Scheick notes that  cubists  – or at least their followers – similarly sought to encounter the fourth dimen- sion by privileging imagination over sensory perception, writing that contemporary art  critic Maurice Raynal ‘concluded that Cubist artists conveyed this [fourth] dimension by  “painting objects as they t hought them” rather than how their senses perceived them’.1 10   Hinton decided that in order to fully escape the theatre of  representation and access  the realm of  pure abstraction, one must ‘cast out’ the eff ects of  gravity and ‘handedness’,  perceptions of  up and down and left and right.1 11 The only way to remove these self-  elements from one’s knowledge of  the block of  cubes, Hinton claimed, was to turn the  block upside down, invert it, and relearn the blocks in each new position:   It was, I found, quite necessary to learn them all over again, for, if  not, I found that I simply  went over them mentally the way fi rst learnt, and then about any particular one made the  alteration required, by a rule. Unless they were learnt all over again the new knowledge of   them was a mere external and simulated aff air, and the up and down would be cast out in  name, but not in reality. It would be a curious kind of  knowing, indeed, if  one had to refl ect  what one knew and then, to get the facts, say the opposite.1 12   Like the Persian king with his subjects, Hinton favoured experiential learning rather than  memorization of  a system of  rules. However, his system for manipulating the cubes is  carefully circumscribed within its own set of rules.   Following the ‘correct’ procedure for his cube ‘games’ requires, in Hinton’s words,  ‘considerable mental eff ort’ and time. For Hinton, however, it is the only means of   approaching a way of  knowing and seeing that is not limited by three- dimensionality.1 13   109  Hayles, ‘Constrained Constructivism’, 28.   110  Scheick, T he Splintering Frame , 22, original emphasis.   111  ‘Handedness’ was, for Kant, and for many present- day philosophers, a contentious issue  concerning the opposition of  absolutist and relationist concepts of  space.

This  new spatial awareness is a deconstruction of  the ‘I– thou’ opposition: there is no up or  down, left or right in the cube exercises, and thus, it is implied, there is no physical  subject. In order to achieve this dissolution of  the self, the exercises must be done physi- cally:  the reader must actually handle the blocks, not just conceive of  them mentally.  Thus, ‘Casting Out the Self ’ is a text that resists mere consumption. As a Text, this  romance requires that the reader ‘s et it going ’.1 14 Once such textual game- playing has  begun, according to Iser:   Author and reader are able to share the game of  the i magination , and, indeed, the game will  not work if  the text sets out to be anything more than a set of  governing rules. The reader’s  enjoyment begins when he himself  [s ic ] becomes productive, i.e., when the text allows him to  bring his own faculties into play. 115   While Hinton certainly invited his readers to share in this ‘game of  the imagination’ that  is intuiting the fourth dimension, this creative impulse sits somewhat uneasily with the  stated purpose of  ‘Casting Out the Self ’, to remove most of  the reader’s faculties from  play. The very ineff ability of  the spatial fourth dimension makes Hinton’s project a highly  creative and unstable one: no matter how carefully he laid out ‘rules’ and guidelines for  the mental construction of  the fourth dimension, this act of  construction is necessarily  the responsibility of  the reader. Thus, there are as many fourth dimensions as there are  readers of – or participants in – Hinton’s texts.   The maintenance of  an unstable unity is built into the structure of  the S cientifi c  Romances : each individual text in this collection plays off  the others, mimicking Hinton’s  hypothesis that the fourth dimension can only be perceived from the three- dimensional  perspective as a series of  ‘slices’. Moving from one ‘slice’ to another – the perspective  engendered by the ‘instructions’ contained within each individual text – the reader expe- riences what Iser described as the ‘concrete fl uidity’ of  the text, where ‘the reader is  constantly feeding back reactions’ as they encounter ‘new information’.1 16 In a man- ner echoing Hinton’s ‘Arabic method of  description’, each succeeding viewpoint of  the  fourth dimension off ered to the reader within the  Scientifi c Romances builds upon the pre- vious ones, at the same time illustrating that, in Iser’s words, ‘the whole text can never  be perceived at any one time’.1 17 It was Hinton’s goal, however, to instil in his readers a  simultaneous and unifying aesthetic capability that transcends Ruskin’s highest human  imaginative achievement. Although Hinton often wrote of  the fourth dimension as a  transcendental metaspace, the dynamism of  his S cientifi c Romances   – the insistence on  obtaining knowledge through relations and movement of  consciousness – resists an abso- lutist, monological model of  reality. The game can only be played – the Text can only  instruct the reader on intuiting the fourth dimension of  space – by off ering itself  ‘to a   114  Barthes, ‘From Work’, 197, original emphasis.   115  Iser, T he Act of  Reading , 108, emphasis added.   116  Ibid., 68.   117  Ibid., 108.  </page> <page sequence="29">    73  CONSTRUCTING THE FOURTH DIMENSION 73 diff raction of  meanings’ and the dynamism of  his S cientifi c Romances , with its insistence on  obtaining knowledge through relations and movement of  consciousness, would appear  to belie this totalizing goal.1 18 Thus we observe the paradoxical nature of  Hinton’s hyper- space that he insisted is a transcendent, yet material, realm that the unifi ed, embodied  subject can only encounter through diff racted, multiple ‘approaches’.   Referring to his own trial- and- error experimentation with developing intuition of  the  fourth dimension through his cube exercises, Hinton claimed in A  New Era of  Though t that  ‘I can lay it down as a verifi able fact, that by taking the proper steps, we can feel our four-  dimensional existence, that the human being somehow, and in some way, is not simply a  three- dimensional being – in what way it is the province of  science to discover’.1 19 Hinton  was careful to remind the reader of  the practical implications of  his hyperspace philoso- phy: ‘We have to choose between metaphysics and space thought’, he explained, because  while ‘in metaphysics we fi nd lofty ideals’, metaphysics without practical application  ‘reduces the world to a phantom and ourselves to lofty spectators’. 120 Unlike metaphysics,  Hinton’s more practical ‘space thought’ must be approached through active engagement  with the world. By following his instructions, he explained, we can learn to intuit the rela- tions within a block of  cubes without reference to the human body, and then   we discover in our own minds the faculty of  appreciating the facts of  position independent  of  gravity and its infl uence upon us [...]. The discovery of  this capacity is like the discovery  of  a love of  justice in the being who has forced himself  to act justly. It is a capacity for being  able to take a view independent of  the conditions under which he is placed, and to feel in  accordance with that view. 121   Here Hinton claimed asceticism as the means by which the four- dimensional aesthetic  can be achieved. He implied that the view independent of  one’s surroundings – and the  view that accompanies this independence – is the perspective accessible from the fourth  dimension. This is a perspective that is not available to those who are simply ‘lofty spec- tators’, but only to those ‘who ha[ve] forced’ themselves ‘to act justly’. Knowledge and  vision are necessarily linked to morality here: to ‘see’ from this perspective is to ‘feel in  accordance with that view’, and thus have a personal stake in it.   The paradox of  aesthesis through ascesis is part of  what Levine calls the ‘dying to  know’ narrative that underpins nineteenth- century scientifi c epistemology and, perhaps  surprisingly, aesthetics as well:   Ascesis, though almost always taken as a condition for the disinterest and objectivity necessary  for adequate scientifi c observation and experiment, is also a way beyond the entrapment of   the self, both a social and aesthetic extension of  the particulars of  individual sensation to the  shareable conditions of  true knowledge. [...] When Pater insists on the necessity ‘to know   118  Barthes, ‘From Work’, 195.   119  Hinton, A  New Era , 46.   120  Ibid., 37.   121  Ibid., 32– 33.  </page> <page sequence="30"> 74 74 BEFORE EINSTEIN  one’s own impression as it really is, to discriminate it, to realise it distinctly,’ he is pointing to  a truly ascetic activity that is often mistaken for self- indulgent. Experiencing sensation is one  thing; literally knowing it, discriminating it, entails repression of  self, almost a denial of  the  sensation being experienced. Pater is arguing for a way to be objective about subjectivity, to  fi nd a position outside experience from which to experience it and possess it.1 22   Likewise, for Hinton, to know an object from the inside is to feel as it ‘feels’, to be able  to isolate ‘self- elements’ – or sense- impressions – and exclude them. To feel empatheti- cally in accordance with something other than self  is contingent upon a certain lack of   egoism: hence, there is a desire to ‘cast out’ or dissolve the self. Just as Pater wanted to  transcend experience in order to fully possess it, Hinton sought extension of  self  through  dissolution: for example, Hinton claimed that the ‘capacity for being able to take a view  independent of  the conditions under which’ the embodied subject exists ‘can only be  done by, as it were, extending our own body so as to include certain cubes, and appreci- ating then the relation of  the other cubes to those’. 123 If  we read ‘casting out the self ’ as  extending the body – or the sensation of  the embodied subjectivity – to encompass other,  external perspectives, the title of  this text takes on an entirely diff erent meaning from that  of  self- surrender. Rather, here the self  is ‘cast out’ like a net, in order to draw in objects  around it. The self  thus becomes a larger agent; like the student who gains access to the  Persian king’s light rays, the self  here gains power through its violation of  the dichotomy  of  internal and external.   After establishing a means for conceiving and perceiving the fourth dimension in the  fi rst series of  S cientifi c Romances , in the second series Hinton turned his attention inward,  to an exploration of  the social, ethical and personal implications of  his hyperspace phi- losophy for the individual subject. Although throughout this book I continue to revisit  the ideas Hinton expressed in the fi rst series, in the  next chapter I shift my focus to the  second series of  S cientifi c Romances .   122  Levine, D ying , 249.   123  Hinton, ‘Casting Out’, S cientifi c Romances , 33.  </page> </plain_text>
