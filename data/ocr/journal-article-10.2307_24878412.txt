<plain_text><page sequence="1">ri : Shamanism: Darkness, Silence, Absence</page><page sequence="2">Editorial Wording the Invisible An Archetype of Shamanism Margarita De Orellana In Mexico, shamans are present in indigenous as well as mestizo communities. Their practice has much in common with that of their counterparts around the world. However, every community also has its own experiences of shamanism, its own specific beliefs and rites. If we were to write a history of shamanism in this country, we would fill hundreds of tomes. Gifted with the ability to cure physical and spiritual ailments, to recover lost souls (which they are used to dealing with), to communicate with all kinds of beings including animals and ancestral spirits, to travel through the world in a disembodied state, shamans are distinguished for the intensity and transcendence of their religious experiences. This issue of Artes de México features some of the observations and experiences of writers who are familiar with this religious phenomenon and who have worked in Tzeltal, Huichol, Nahua and Tepehua communities for long periods of time. Their accounts describe moments that reveal the power of shamans to deeply affect their followers, and perhaps also the invisible powers they invoke. Anthropological work of this kind normally stays within the confines of the academic world. But at Artes de México, we believe that it can be shared with readers who are curious to know more about an essential aspect of our cultural diversity. Thus, we want to thank the eight writers featured here for sharing with us some of the discoveries they made during their wide-ranging studies. Shamans perform different duties depending on the community to which they belong. One of the roles of the Nahua tlamatki is to make miniature figures so that the nenenkame (spirits) can interact with them. Huichol shamans seek to transform themselves into their ancestors and the objects of their visions, like peyote, rain or corn. Tzeltal shamans have to protect sick people from the noise of the spirit world, since it is the adversary, the enemy of health. I am sketching out just a few broad strokes of what appears in this issue. The forms of religious expression described here consistently involve three things: darkness, silence and absence. In the darkness of the night, shamans see more clearly, and it is when their sacred rites usually take place. Silence is a source of life and hope, especially in the Tzeltal community of Cancuc. Absence is indispensable in order to achieve stability, equilibrium, among humans, and it indeed allows the shaman to find or capture errant spirits. These religious experiences immediately call to mind poetry, a dimension of life that reveals hidden realities, where dreams play an important role and display a surprising aesthetic. In rites, we behold the beauty of songs, prayers, offerings, and of silhouettes moving against the light of the fire. We also discover both ancestral wisdom and contemporary insight that have little to do with the values of those who sell us the idea that our modern lives can only follow one path, that there is only one way of being. In these pages, we try to capture and share moments of a life that dazzled us, a life loaded with meaning and beauty. Indeed, conveying this is one of our goals. Translated by Jill Derais The Malady of Noise Pedro Pitarch "Ç* ilence" is the name of the shamanic songs of the kJ indigenous Tzeltal people of the highlands of Chiapas. As a whole, the songs are called ch'ab, meaning "to silence," The songs for recovering lost or kidnapped souls are called ch'abatayel, that is, "to muffle" or "to render mute." And the songs for keeping in check the toxic emotions of the spirits and the dead are referred to as biktal ch'ab, which translates as diminishing or deadening by means of silence. The main function of the chants sung by shamans at ceremonies for curing or preventing illnesses is thus to silence, to smother, to dampen the noise of the spirit world. In the afterworld—known as the Other Side in the Tzeltal language: an invisible world which is the opposite of the solar world we live in—the spirits are in a constant state of excitement, celebrating and playing music. If in pre-Columbian times, the Other Side was usually represented as a place of music and dancing, nowadays the indigenous Tzeltal people consider it a place of constant noise and commotion, likening it to a traditional Mexican feast. The Other Side has also been characterized as a modern Mexican cantina or nightclub where alcohol is served and where people frantically dance and listen to ranchera, norteña or pop. One shamanic song tells of how the spirits celebrate the fact that they have captured an indigenous person's soul at a party where: So many sit in a row on the curb, so many sit in a row on a Spanish bench. They have four feet, they have four hands. Their feet may dance, their hands may dance. They may be enjoying nine melodies for string instruments. They may be enjoying dancing to nine dances. They may rejoice with their Spanish music, they may rejoice with their Spanish guitar. From the point of view of humans, however, all of this merriment has dark, harmful consequences, since the rejoicing of the spirits and the dead brings forth illness in the human world. Death travels to our world in the form of music and loud noise. It's not that illness is like noise, it's that illness is noise. Normally impossible to see, the spirits can nevertheless be heard clearly, sometimes violently, and it is precisely their sounds that produce the illness. When someone gets sick at home, it is not uncommon for the other occupants of the house or the neighbors to hear some type of loud noise during the night, though it is hard to say whether they hear it in a waking state or in a dream. They might hear, for example, a group of spirits following a procession like those organized by mayordomos for saints, with violin, harp and guitar players. Or they might hear guitar and accordion music like that played in Evangelical churches. On other occasions, the loud noise of cars being driven by Catholic priests is heard outside the house, or trucks with bishops at the wheel, trains conducted by Jesuits—Christian noise, that is, through which the spirits attempt to claim the soul of an indigenous victim. &lt; Lorenzo Armendariz, Tenejapa, Chiapas, 1993 73 Margarita De Orellana Pedro Pitarch &lt; Lorenzo Armendaríz, Tenejapa, Chiapas, 1993 Translated by Jill Derais</page><page sequence="3">-2k Lorenzo Armendariz, Tenejapa, Chiapas, 1993 With his song, the shaman addresses the ailments he is treating, and they respond. An ailment—in this example, heart pain—exposes the spirit that caused it: I am here! Who spoke of me? Who uttered my name? A priest in a black cassock, the driver of a Spanish automobile, the conductor of a Spanish train. But by speaking, the spirit also describes itself and its "acoustic nature": the illness has made its presence known in the humans' visual world in the form of a song, of whistling, of "Spanish music," which, in this case, is like saying'noise from the afterworld": I am here. I've come whistling, I've come crooning, I've come singing, I've come slowly, like a Spanish record, like Spanish music. I've come singing, I've come whistling. The illness enters the body of the victim through the joints and the shaman must then find traces of music in the blood, for instance. Here, the illness is seen as coursing through the blood stream as if it were European or Spanish string music, which is nothing like indigenous music, based as it is on wind and percussion instruments: how many of the enemies, how many of those with nahuales, how many have you put to sleep: your children, your offspring, Father, Lord. In the shade of the sacred tree, in the shade of the sacred reeds, may his sacred time be at hand, may his sacred destiny be at hand. His body, calm, his being, soothed, may he be protected there, may he be swaddled there, may he remain in the enclosure, may he remain in the pen, remain calm, no more, remain in silence, no more. The paradox, of course, is that the spirits' noise is only silenced by songs in which the shaman expatiates for hours, nights, sometimes even weeks. He may not sing or speak loudly, but there is no doubt that the potency of his words depends in part on his continuous utterance of them, on their repetition. This language is defined by a kind of compulsion: the shaman not only builds a protective barrier, an "enclosure," but fills it with words and sounds to ensure that there is no room left for noise from the Other Side to filter in. This is the same prophylactic principle that guides the practices of indigenous people who have joined Evangelical I came here spinning like a Spanish spinning top, like a Spanish spinning top. This is how I turn, this is how I spin. This is how I got here, this is how I got into the vein, this is how I got into the flesh. This is how I've found shelter, you'll say. This is how I've latched on, you'll say. This is how I've taken root, you'll say. This is how I've spread my tendrils, you'll say. This is how I've spread through veins, you'll say, spread through the flesh, you'll say. I've laid out my nest, you'll say, I've laid out my music, you'll say. During the prayers for protection that follow the healing songs, the person praying places the patient, convalescent and weak, within an enclosure or "pen" in which he must remain, calm and silent, in order not to attract evil or enmity—a small space, such as the home or the village, which is precariously defended against the primordial state of existence that is noise. The following protection song shows how a space of silence is created around the patient: May he remain in the enclosure, may he remain in the pen, may his heart be happy, may his heart be full of joy. How many of the aggressors, -2k Lorenzo Armendariz, Tenejapa, Chiapas, 1993</page><page sequence="4">churches. The feverish devotion with which Evangelists (but also Catholics) sing songs and surround themselves with language, the constant flow of words and sounds in sermons, hymns, the reading of biblical passages: all this fills the cramped interiors of indigenous churches during the long Sunday services. The discourse is extravagant—a bit like the chanting of shamans—but it produces the feeling of a protective barrier, a therapeutic space that is a defense against the words and noises threatening one's existence. It must be the same principle that explains why radios are always left on, day and night, or why the indigenous people who settled in the Lacandón Rainforest defended themselves against forest spirits—such as tigers—by placing four loudspeakers around the outskirts of settlements. But indigenous people are not deceiving themselves: what truly stops the spirits' relentless harassment is not these provisional defensive measures, but rather the act of facing and silencing them. To render the spirits mute is to make them disappear, to make them leave the area, to ensure their continued absence. The spirits' silence guarantees human life, and the spirits' merry commotion is the death of the living, perhaps because their presence, their existence in the afterworld, is conveyed through clamor. Silence is what, albeit provisionally, enables life. The rest is white noise. Translated by Clara Marin Paradoxes of the Invisible Noisy Darkness &amp; Luminous Silence Johannes Neurath Western esotericism considers shamanism an archaic spiritual practice, a vestige of a mindset that existed prior to the emergence of civilization. To this we must add the pastoral image of the wise indigenous healer, who maintains an intimate relationship with nature and works incessantly to keep the universe in balance. The Huichol, or Wixaritari, world-renowned for their "veneration of peyote" and "shamanic art," are indeed a paradigm for these ideas. But the Huichol and their shamans—mara'akame in the singular, mara'akate in the plural, "those who know how to dream"—live in a complex universe where these romantic ideas make little sense: humans and animals hunt each other, dreams are dangerous experiences that are hard to control, and the visionary world of the ancestral gods— Deer, Sun and Peyote—coexists with the contemporary world, with all of its problems and political, economic and religious contradictions. The Huichol mara'akame s practice involves establishing successful relationships with the beings that exist in the world. This is why offerings, including ritual foodstuffs, are made to the various gods. When someone has not fulfilled this obligation and is indebted to a particular deity, they are stricken by "arrows of illness." Gradually, without being able to control the process, they turn into the animal that is the deity. People afflicted with the Deer disease become as thin as deer and then metamorphose into deer after they die. The Fire disease is a stomachache. Our Grandfather Fire gets angry when his ritual hearth has not been cleaned, or when his fire has not been tended, and takes up residence in the offender's belly. Thus, one of the mara'akames most important tasks is dealing with animals that hunt humans, offering them food, drink and tobacco in exchange for the lives of those who have gotten sick. At the same time, the mara'akame removes from his patients' bodies the "arrows of illness" and other projectiles that the animals have fired at them. But how does the mara'akame become the intermediary between people and their ancestral gods? During the shamanic initiation, a relationship of identification is established with the latter. The apprentice shaman strives to become his own forebears (who are deities) through sacrifices and by seeking visions. So the ritual specialist himself creates and invents the world of the gods through his chanting and visions. He identifies with the deer that voluntarily surrenders to the hunter, and through this act, he is able to transform himself into the objects of his visions: peyote, the sun, rain, corn... But the metamorphosis is more complicated than one might think, since by changing states the shaman's perspective on things also changes. Thus, for instance, the light of dawn is the darkness seen through the eyes of the hunter transformed into a deer and of the deer transformed into peyote. This world of the first dawn created through the visions of the mara'akate in the desert is a silent place where one of the few things one hears is the high-pitched, syncopated music of instruments like the rebec (xaweri) and the timple (kanari). The first rains are born of the tears of hunters and prey, who feel sorry for each other. The deer asks to be killed and teaches the hunter important lessons before dying. The hunter identifies with his prey and therefore understands the deer's teachings. But in spite of the visions, dawn is an unattainable world, forever out of reach. Only an animal sacrifice can allow the shaman to have a perfect vision and to travel effectively to the Desert of Dawn. To survive the visionary experience, he must at some point put a halt to the identification game between hunter and prey, so as not to become a deity yet, but rather to continue to be part of the ungenerous society of humans, with its lack of knowledge and absence of light. The dawn of the world that occurs with the revelation of the gods is not the only important thing in Huichol shamanism. The mara'akame also knows how to negotiate the dark world below, populated by mestizos, saints, prehistoric beings such as giants and mammoths, marine animals, winged serpents, mermaids, vampires and chupacabras. The world of darkness is the most ancient part of the world and it is covered in vegetation, but it is also the city, the technology and the modern economy of non-indigenous folk, which is why it is filled with devices used by the mestizos. Tine underworld's main deity is the Black Charro, or horseman, a figure from mestizo folklore, which is associated with the death of Christ during Holy Week and with the kieri, a dangerous psychotropic plant. The shaman also knows how to prevail upon mestizo (Catholic) saints so that they grant Huichols success in livestock farming, business ventures and the politics of the mestizo world. However, one does not relate to the beings of this world through sacrifice, like one does in the Desert of Dawn, but rather through commercial exchanges and transactions. Here, in principle, the rules are strict: promises must be fulfilled, or else corporate leaders may get upset. But one can also attempt to fool, cheat or steal from the clumsy mestizo gods. Mythological figures such 75 Translated by Clara Marin Johannes Neurath</page><page sequence="5">' "Mk HH a Lorenzo as Kauyumari, the deer god or the god of language, and Armendariz, Takutsi, the god of fertility, are famous for having stolen Las Latas, ritual objects from the inhabitants of the dark world. And Jalisco, 1993 Watakame, the first farmer, followed the ants down into the underworld where he discovered the five different types of corn. The darkness is noisy in contrast to the desert's transparent silence. When the great drum beats the monotonous rhythm of our heartbeat, we know we are in the world below. The drum is made from a hollow tree trunk and is associated with the Huichol version of the myth of Noah, whose Ark was made out of a hollow tree, and then boarded by a man and a female dog, along with corn, squash and fire, at the onset of the great flood. The hollow tree trunk is a microcosm, and Huichol communities indeed identify with the Ark's passengers as they manage to stay afloat in the midst of a mestizo society and successfully navigate through this sea of darkness. Huichol shamans are nocturnal beings seeking dawn. As Regina Lira mentions, their songs have titles such as "Book of Night,""Echo in Bed" or"Night of the Flower." In many stories, it is the wolves that were the first to venture out of the sea of darkness and thus became the first mara'akate. It is also believed that shamans are werewolves or that they have wolf-like bones. Young people whose vocation it is to become a shaman constantly dream of wolves, going hunting with their wolf companions in their dreams. When one decides not to take on the responsibility of becoming a mara'akame, he undergoes a healing ritual to remove the wolf bones from his body. Dreaming about wolves is dangerous, especially when the apprentice shaman still has trouble controlling his dreams. Sometimes the wolves and their human companions will kill a deer, and if a human feeds on this meat with the wolves, his metamorphosis into a wolf is irreversible. Also during the hunt, a deer can appear as a beautiful young woman and seduce the hunter; she then takes him home and feeds him grass. Eating the food of the "other" is equivalent to being captured by the prey. When they die, certain mara'akate do finally go live with the wolves. There are special religious sites for wolves, where they gather with dead shamans to dance in circles, performing a rite identical to the Huichol mitote celebration. To us these sacred sites look like rocks strewn about and natural rock formations, but the wolves see them as the shrines and buildings of Huichol ceremonial centers. All of the beings with which the mara'akame interacts are ambiguous: even the most benevolent-seeming gods are potentially dangerous. But one can always negotiate, even with obnoxious mestizo leaders. To deal with so many things, and to travel to the places where the gods dwell, the mara'akame undergoes metamorphoses and appears in various places at once. The ritual songs of the Huichols studied by Regina Lira describe the way in which the shaman-singer dons multiple identities: the antagonistic gods Kauyumari and Irumari, one representing day and the other night, meld with the singer, who suddenly no longer interacts or converses with Kauyumari, but rather says"Kaunemari," ne indicating the first person singular. In these songs, it is quite common for the mara'akame to be in various places at once. What he says may also sound contradictory. Events are sometimes told in the first person, and sometimes as if they happen on their own and do not involve the narrator. The mara'akame asks himself questions about what is happening. The perspective shifts constantly: to quote Lara, the singer "accumulates" points of view. The key to success is to always maintain control over the process, to know when it is time to step back and return to the human world. The idea is to influence animals, gods and saints, but not fall under their influence. The difference between a shaman and his patient is that the patient cannot control the process of transformation. Now then, how much does Huichol art have to do with shamanism? As I explained in the book La vida de las imágenes (The Life of Images), Huichols oftentimes have no intention of producing powerful images, but rather seek to make pieces that can be sold as "ritual art." Artisans present themselves as mara'akate, and their work as expressions of'indigenous spirituality," depicted through certain stereotypical symbols—peyote, corn, deer, eagles and other sacred animals, or the mara'akate themselves in action, with their équipai chairs, feather-decorated rods, gourds, God's eyes and other paraphernalia. Aimed mainly at a New Age audience, or at a public interested in indigenous folklore, this marketing strategy glosses over Huichol art's undeniable aesthetic and ritualistic complexities. Indeed, it is easier to understand these complexities if we approach Huichol shamanism from the angle of rituals and their intricacies, where the mara'akame is a shrewd, experienced, cosmic diplomat who undergoes metamorphoses, who can be at various places at once and who knows how to negotiate with the gods and saints in order to allow his human patients to live longer lives. Translated by Clara Marin Dreams of the Invisible Darkness, Silence 8c Absence in Tlacotepec Laura Romero It was thirteen years ago when I first heard the Nahuas from the town of San Sebastián Tlacotepec talk about the causes and effects of disease. Since then, four of the town's shamans or ixtlamatkeh have died; they taught me a great deal about the physical and spiritual world that the Nahuas inhabit. Despite the time and effort they invested in trying to explain the essence of this world to me, many things still remain a mystery. And there is only one reason for this: my eyes were never really open. Describing the inner workings of Nahua shamanism in a first-person narrative allows me to focus on the differences that shamans establish among the entities of the cosmos. What they saw in me, what allowed me to a Lorenzo Armendariz, Las Latas, Jalisco, 1993 Laura Romero</page><page sequence="6">connect with them, though it later vanished, illustrates a characteristic that many native communities attribute to the body: its instability. Dreaming Is Knowing When I first got to the mountains, I would stay up to transcribe the interviews I had conducted during the day in the dim light of a twenty-five-watt bulb. I was staying with Doña Maria, one of the community's oldest midwives. After nightfall people slowly went off to bed: their nightly routine didn't revolve around prime time, like it does for most. Maria didn't even have a television. Every night she would tell me: "It's time for bed, Laurita! You're just wearing out your eyes!" I'd ask for a few more minutes, but she'd bluntly reply: "All you folks do is read and analyze. That's why you're so crazy. We don't learn from books, we learn from dreams, because in our dreams, our eyes are open. So, come now, time for bed." I'll never forget how those words influenced the way I did by fieldwork from that point on. While under Doña Maria's roof, I would tuck away my pen and notebook, walk over to her sleeping quarters and take the cot next to hers. In the summertime, we brought the sleeping mats outside and, in the darkness of the village, I would lie there and listen to her. I wasn't dreaming, but I was learning. The other person to whom I owe much of what I learned over those six years is Don Angel—a slender yet solid man. When I was introduced to him by his eleven year-old godson, I realized the complex life history of each of the ixtlamatkeh: their deeds, stories and gifts were revealed to me gradually, yet it all became increasingly difficult to understand. Each shaman has his or her specialty, from medicinal herbs to midwifery, but what set them apart from the rest of the community is their knowledge in general. When I interviewed locals who weren't healers, a question would inevitably come up for which their answer was, "I don't know. You should go see one of the ixtlamatkeh. They'll surely know." What they know above all is how to see and how to speak. Not exactly "seeing through one's eyes," but rather the ability associated with perceiving the true form of beings, as one can be easily deceived in a universe where things change shape and beings change their minds constantly. The gift of the ixtlamatki is best understood in terms of one of the Nahuas' primary concerns: the loss of one's soul, which was precisely the focus of my research. For the Nahuas, the loss of one's soul is felt as an absence. One of its most crippling effects is madness, which manifests itself when people with absent souls begin to forget that they belong to a community that protects them and makes their existence possible. In this sense, absence is part of what the Nahuas of Tlacotepec understand as being human. They know that the absence of one's soul disrupts the flow of everyday life, because it changes the way a person feels, hears, sees and desires. Madness can also come from the wilderness, from inside the hills where the Lords of the Mountain dwell—the Master and Mistress of Tlalocan (the realm of the rain god Tlaloc), who can snatch away someone's humanness. But the ixtlamatki, unlike the lost souls, is able to control his madness: he can adapt to the places inhabited by "the others" without becoming one of them. Hie Hummingbird, My Animal Companion In Tlacotepec, Doña María talked about a hummingbird that had come to the village. This wasn't just any hummingbird: to her, it (like other animals) was my tonalikniuh, a part of myself that lived in the wilderness. It lived around the Popocatépetl, according to Doña María, and it sheltered one of the thirteen parts of the tonal— one of the souls that conforms a human being. Whatever happens to the animal is felt by its human counterpart and vice versa, because they are the same being. But what was strange was to see my animal companion in the village, because they tend to remain far away from their human companions. I seemed to be luring it close, perhaps because I wasn't from the region. One day, Doña María found a small hummingbird, dead, on her land. She immediately summoned me and said: "Your animal companion is a hummingbird. It's a bad omen that it came here to die. We have no way of knowing for sure if this is your hummingbird or just a random hummingbird. So go to the river, pluck its feathers, throw it into the water and let the current take it away. You have to do this. If this is your animal companion and you leave it here, where it'll get covered in ants and maggots, you too will die." My eyes—those of a mestizo woman who saw the tiny corpse of what could have been a part of me cradled in my hands—revealed my uncertainty and fear. But I could not question Doña Maria's resoluteness. "And hold on to the feathers. Always keep them with you," she added. Fortunately, the hummingbird continues to visit Doña Maria in Tlacotepec today. Hie Ixtlamatki: The One Who Is Born Twice The shamanic gift is the ability to see what is missing, what is absent, to listen to what the silence can reveal. If we examine the therapeutic practice of ixtlamatkeh, we see how these elements come together, particularly if we look at each shaman's personal story. Throughout their lives, shamans continuously shift between being and not being, and there are two moments in which this shift is most obvious. The first occurs when the shaman is still in his or her mother's womb. After the first trimester of pregnancy, the tonal, which the Nahuas consider the most unstable of the souls, enters the fetus, as evinced by its first movements. At this point the future being starts to acquire a rudimentary form of humanness. According to midwives, prior to taking on human form, we all resemble amphibians—frogs in the case of women, and toads in the case of men. They base this on what they observe during miscarriages. When the fetus interrupts the process of becoming human and is stillborn, its body is laid in the river, because it is believed that it wanted to go back to its mother, the Siren. If the fetus is a shaman, the development process continues, but something singular occurs: it leaves its mother's womb at night to head to the mountains, most often to Kobatépetl ("snake hill"), the Tlalocan of the Nahuas. The unborn shaman goes inside the mountain, locating the safest entrances. It becomes familiar with the properties of plants and learns things from other healers. Mothers become terribly frightened 77 The Hummingbird, My Animal Companion In Tlacotepec, Doña María talked about a hummingbird that had come to the village. This wasn't just any hummingbird: to her, it (like other animals) was my tonalikniuh, a part of myself that lived in the wilderness.

Hie Ixtlamatki: Hie One Who Is Born Twice</page><page sequence="7">&gt; Laura when they wake up and find their belly empty. However, Romero, they must remain calm: they can tell no one besides an Popocatepetl elder ixtlamatki about the incident. If, out of carelessness Volcano, or ignorance, a mother wakes up her husband or cries, her March 2015 unborn child will not return, because it will no longer find the entrance to the "cave" (its mother's womb). This nocturnal journey is the first of many throughout the shamans life. When the shaman is born into the human world—we must not forget that, by then, he has already performed actions as a being in the wilderness—his body is covered with a thin membrane, sometimes black, sometimes white. The skilled midwife will immediately realize that this represents the gift, and she will only inform the mother of this. If the entire body is covered, the shaman will have greater powers than if only the head or the hands are sheathed. This second skin protects the parts of the body that will serve as the future ixtlamatki's instruments. The moment of birth is crucial in the shaman's development. Prior to his first breastfeeding, the child must be wrapped in a thin blanket, placed in a basket or in a small cardboard box, and hidden in the loft, where he will remain for seven days. If someone should ask about the newborn, they must be told that the mother has taken him into town. Under no circumstances shall the family tell others what is taking place, because if they do, the newborn will depart and never return. During these seven days, the child travels to the mountains, where he hides his shaman's "clothes" and eats for the first time. Eating food there grants him membership in the non-human world. The membrane or "clothing" is the shaman's non-human body, her protective skin, a garment that she wears in front of'the others." In the same way that regular humans join the congregation of the dead when they abandon their bodies and thus shed their human condition, the ixtlamatki loses her ability to interact with the non-human realm if the midwife ruptures the membrane accidentally. The shaman will also fail to develop her therapeutic capacities (or her destructive powers if she were to become a sorceress). The repercussions of one's actions are marked on ones skin. If someone has done something wrong, even in a dream, or has unwittingly trespassed on the territory of the Lords of the Mountain, they will get sick. The lords make blemishes appear on one's skin: pimples, white splotches or burn marks. But the ixtlamatki's extra layer of skin protects him, giving him the power to interact within these normally forbidden realms. The membrane symbolizes his potential: it is a garment that must be worn as part of a protocol in order to gain access to the non-human realm. Silent Words, Deaf Ears, Eyes that See in the Dark Although my eyes were not completely open—and probably never will be—my ears and mouth were. When the shamans referred to my silence, to the silence of all kixtianos and xinolas, meaning mestizos, they were referring to those of us who do not speak properly. We are nontli orpinotl:"mute" We are also deaf: deaf to the true language, the one that they speak. It is the language of the plants that possess healing powers because they are the offspring of the Lord of the Mountain, the language of hunted animals, like the deer, the language spoken by the Masters of Tlalocan, by the earth and by the souls—indeed, it is the language of all souls. We mestizos speak but we are mute. Our silence is shaped by the harsh sounds of words that seem hurtful, because our tongue resembles the barking of dogs or the gobbling of turkeys. It is popoloca, gibberish. It is the parlance of the "outsiders," who fall into a different ontological category altogether, owing to their inability to express themselves correctly. Those who never learn Nahuatl develop a stiff, twisted, inflexible tongue—and nothing inflexible is desirable because it is a constraint, a limitation. Spanish is the tongue of bureaucracy, of government spokespeople, doctors and nurses, teachers and engineers. But nothing good has come from Spanish. Spanish leaves a mark on those who emigrate from their communities: it seeps into their minds and threatens to replace their mother tongue. Yet those who master Spanish will still have the advantage of having spoken Nahuatl first. Not everyone's eyes can be opened, nor does everyone open their eyes the same way. Open eyes are those that know how to dream, but above all those that know how to see in the dark, which is the true way of acquiring knowledge. Hunters and healers are the best observers. Their power resides in the ability to discern what others cannot, what is absent or what is confusing because it blends with other images. The term curandero or "healer" illustrates our limited capacity to describe the real meaning of the Nahuatl term ixtlamatki:"to know with one's eyes," to know by seeing, visualizing the surface of things. "To know" not in the sense that we anthropologists (or others scientists) lend to the term: to know is not only to memorize but also to think, see, hear and smell. Shamanic "seeing" is not with the eyes; for instance, Don Luis was a blind ixtlamatki who looked at what eggs had to say. After cleansing the patient with an egg, he holds it in his hands and makes a diagnosis. He would take the patient's pulse, touching the temples and forehead, listening with his fingers for the ailment's symptoms. At night, when everyone was asleep, Don Luis's tonal would leave his body to go find lost souls. Then, he saw with his eyes, since ixtlamatkeh can see in the dark as if it were daylight. Their knowledge allows them to move through the dark with such skill that they see what remains hidden to others. Sometimes they enter dangerous environments, dominated by the nahualmeh, the world's "counterforces." In these situations, they light the way with a kind of torch made of pisietl, a mixture of lime and ground tobacco: the heat emitted by the lime serves as a light source so they can keep searching for their sick patients' souls. On these treacherous journeys, the shaman is also accompanied by twelve medicinal plants, which are 78 &gt; Laura Romero, Popocatepetl Volcano, March 2015</page><page sequence="8">the daughters of the Lord of the Mountain. Some of these plants' Nahuatl names include the word tototl, meaning bird, in which case they scan the area from the sky, while the plants called tekwani make the journey underground. The word tekwani has many meanings in Nahuatl: it sometimes refers to the animal companion of powerful men or women, like leaders or healers; more literally, it means "man-eating animals," like jaguars or large snakes. In this case, however, tekwani refers to "feline plants" that can travel to the darkest corners of the cosmos, places that not even shamans can see. These companion "spirits" do not act the same way for all ixtlamatkeb. Their actions depend on the shamans command of the language: he must learn to awaken the forces that lie dormant in the elements of nature. To solicit, for instance, the help of lime and tobacco, he voices the following chant: We are performing a remedy We are performing a custom [...] It is safe to come out, it is safe to appear [...] In the sky, along the path Where we will go together, where we will find him, Where we will roam, where his spirit was left behind, Floating in the air, that's where we shall go Where the cloud snakes live Those who do harm [black magic] Or those who knocked him down We will pick him up With a great gift, with a great tlapatkayotl I do not have envy in my hands, I do not have disease in my hands [...] I will walk ahead of them, I will soar above them [...] You will accompany me in the air, on our journey To where your son fell from the earth To where you have hidden him Speech: Presence 8c Power Crossing over the threshold between being and non-being, the Nahua shaman must find what is missing, what is unsaid, what is unseen. What she is able to communicate is precisely what is not there, what is not easily observed. Her diagnostic process highlights the very fact that what she sees is not perceptible to others. Shamans have several methods of diagnosis to choose from: cornseed, stones, eggs and playing cards. The method most often used in Tlacotepec involves a raw egg: the shaman rubs it on his patient to cleanse him, and then breaks it into a glass of water. The shapes formed become a text that is interpreted by the shaman, who visualizes stories, grievances, conflicts, death, curses whispered to the sick person, the route that a thief has taken or the series of events that led to a given situation. The ixtlamatki retrieves the patient's memories, guiding him through his confusion to unveil what the actual conflict is about. The words that the ixtlamatki speaks activate the networks of interaction that she needs to fulfill her objectives. She turns objects such as tobacco and lime into subjects in order to involve them in the therapeutic ritual. The ixtlamatki's discourse has a centrifugal and a centripetal force. With the former he distributes the powers implicated in the ritual, specifically in the case of the search for lost souls, in all the corners of the universe where the soul might be hidden or held captive. With the latter, the shaman beckons the soul to the place of his ceremonial act, addressing these words to the tonalxibitl, the medicinal plant associated with the tonal: You, tonalxibitl, of the seven leaves You will awaken your son who is on the earth, who is in this world You will bring your son who is on the earth, who is in this world Our Lord Jesus Christ You, tonalxibitl Make him look, awaken him Now go and bring him here There is no denying the power behind the shaman's craft. But in order for it to work, there has to be a society around her that agrees with her categorization of beings, knowledge and its forms. Nahua culture is one such society and the ixtlamatki is one of its cornerstones. She is like the conductor of a complex ontological orchestra in which each musician plays his part and then waits in silence, taking his turn, listening to the others, following the score. And occasionally, as happens on the concert stage, the symphony can be performed without the conductor. In the plight of the lost soul, however, the shaman's intervention is indispensable. The remedy consists of a complex oratorical ritual that must be delivered by someone who completely understands the inner workings of beings and the relationships between them, someone who has dedicated his life to seeing in the dark with his eyes closed—yet more open than most people—in the dreary depths of the Kobatépetl. The ixtlamatki knows the language of otherworldly forces, of souls and of mestizos. The Nahua shaman's job is to use language to create and recreate the world. A Being That Is a Doing-in-the-World The shaman possesses an exceptional quality: she is a spirit and she is a person. This duality allows her to be acknowledged in her community as the operator of a politic that has implications not only in human society but also in the cosmic realm. She is a being who can take the shape of a bird or a cat and can enter the most uncertain places in the universe. She is not a figure conceived by a society forced to create a magical world because of its intellectual fragility. Rather, shamanism is a way of being in the world, a way of doing. Like many other indigenous communities across Mexico today, the Nahuas of Tlacotepec face high rates of migration, poverty and unemployment. Their day-to-day lives are marked by struggle and a lack of opportunities, particularly for the younger generation, but also by the ritual actions of the ixtlamatkeb. There is a tendency to romanticize indigenous cultures by viewing aspects of them as expressions of a glorious past, but there is also a tendency to blame the poverty of indigenous communities on their beliefs. However, in the setting of these very private therapeutic rituals, one can sometimes hear in the background the lyrics of an epic narcocorrido (a ballad about the violence of the drug trade). And one can also hear the whispers of the shaman, who, without raising his voice, cries out to the lost souls, pleading for their return: "May his soul return, may his redness return! Remember, my sweet soul! Open your eyes!" Translated by Paige Mitchell 79 Translated by Paige Mitchell</page><page sequence="9">Perspectives of the Invisible Dreaming &amp; Seeing Through the Eyes of Spirits David Lorente Fernández The Nahuas of the Sierra de Texcoco believe that there are different types of dreams and different ways of dreaming. On the one hand, there are inconsequential dreams, which reflect the Western understanding and dictionary definition of a dream: "the imagining of events or images in one's mind during sleep." On the other, in meaningful dreams, dreamers have premonitions, gain access to cosmic realms and meet otherworldly beings. For most people, meaningful dreams occur unexpectedly and are beyond their control. This is not the case for shamans who are known as tesifteros (deriving from the Nahuatl term for "hail," tesihuitl) or as graniceros (deriving from the Spanish word for hail):"they who control the hail,""they who predict the weather," or more simply "bringers of rain." The meaningful dream is at the core of their shamanic initiation process and plays a central role in rituals, as the shaman forecasts the weather, comes up with remedies for ailments and determines the composition of sacred offerings. While the average person dreams while sleeping, this is not the case of the granicero, whose ability to dream is considerably more flexible. The Nahuatl verb temiqui is normally translated as "to dream," but its broader semantic scope encompasses both certain kinds of nighttime dreaming and "daydreaming." After they have received their gift—which involves being struck by lightning or certain types of illnesses, seen as an initiation—graniceros begin to have dreams both during the night and during the day. In the sierra, it is believed that one doesn't have to be asleep to dream. In Spanish, which is the language that the Nahuas of the sierra use for day-to-day communication, they call what they experience during sleep sueños or "dreams," while daytime experiences are known as privarse, "to have a spell" or "fit." In either situation, the awakening is important: it marks the end of the process. After someone has come out of a daytime spell, they might say,"he woke up," or when someone is awake but lost in thought, they compare it to dreaming, saying "I think she is asleep." From this perspective, it seems somewhat irrelevant whether the event takes place at night or in the day. During the dream, the spirit (or animancon in Nahuatl) frees itself from the body and embarks on a journey. Meaningful dreams are, in essence, spiritual pilgrimages to other cosmic realms. After their initiation, gram'ceros must learn to develop a level of conscious, willful control over their dreaming. Dreaming is not just about traveling to another realm, but about changing the way one perceives things—it is about gaining a visual understanding of what beings and objects actually are. In short, dreaming is learning to see through the eyes of the soul. The Spirit Is Itself a Body: The Shamans Vision In the dream state, the spirit emerges as an anthropomorphic entity that inconspicuously wanders around outside the dreamer's body. The animancon is composed of a series of smaller entities, which cluster around the joints—the pulse points. The spirit is the sum of all the pulse-spirits throbbing in one's body: in the head, neck, torso, elbows, wrists, knees and feet. The secondary spirits function as points of connection to the soul, and when they are unified as a whole, they form the animancon. Secondary spirits can slip out of the body individually or as a group, in the form of the unified soul. They normally flee due to a sudden scare: the bigger the fright, the more likely it is for spirits to depart en masse. Sometimes they are also abducted by hostile entities. In dreams, however, the spirit leaves the body willingly as a unified whole. Nahuas believe that in addition to the spirits and unitary soul, the body (the tonacayo,"our flesh") is also home to the yolotl, or "heart-soul," which determines one's individual psychic strength and endurance. Those with a strong heart-soul can become shamans; those with a weak yolotl lack character and are sickly. While the soul resides in the heart at the body's core, secondary spirits are like capillaries or extensions of the soul radiating throughout the body. The pulse points are seen as tiny hearts that are replicas of the central heart, while the unified spirit is like a psychic silhouette that envelops the physical body's outer surface, containing its mass. A local shaman gave the following explanation: "The spirit is a double of the body, which we have inside us; it's what gives us life." The spirit takes the shape of the container that molds it. The healer added,"Imagine the body is a balloon and the spirit is the air inside it. The body is like an overcoat or a glove." The spirit is essentially like a matryoshka doll, a body inside a body. Just as the physical body is clothed, the spirit body has the physical body as an overcoat or outer casing. The heart-soul is an inseparable component of the body that only leaves it at the moment of death. The spirit, however, can leave the physical body and function in other worlds as an autonomous entity, as a body in and of itself. People get confused when their spirit-body escapes in dreams, and so graniceros must learn to become experts at dreaming, travelers who have learned to control the body that is their spirit. When graniceros dream, their spirits travel like bodies and they must realize that their dream experiences, their disembodiment, are part of a metamorphosis. Freed from their physical bodies, shamans become spirit bodies. Controlling this process involves training one's perception. Underwater Beings The beings that bestow the graniceros their gift, through a strike of lightning or a physical ailment, are spirits as far as humans can tell. They are called ahuaques, or "lords of water," and they control the flow of springs and rivers and govern weather phenomena like rain, hail and lightning. They are described as spirits but also as humans, and this does not represent a paradox to the Nahuas. The ahuaques are seen as both anthropomorphic and ethereal, and are sometimes referred to as "air within water." But the granicero knows that they are disembodied humans, like he is when visiting them in dreams, and that in this sense they have spirit bodies. According to Nahua myth, the ahuaques are human beings identical to those on the earth's surface, whose constituent spirits are the product of specific ways of dying: infants who died before they were baptized, individuals who were struck dead by lightning or who died from "rain diseases" (i.e. diseases associated with water) or deceased graniceros. Finally, there are the children that these underwater beings have on their own. 80 David Lorente Fernández</page><page sequence="10">Despite their powers, the ahuaques are not supernatural beings or deities, but rather tlacatl, or people: they have human bodies, distinct personalities, first and last names. They have a certain age and gender, and are presumed to have the same life expectancy as humans. They speak the same language as the inhabitants of the sierra. They have social structures and eat the same foods as humans do: grains, vegetables, beef, pulque. Indeed, out of all the different kinds of human beings, the ahuaques are believed to be the most prevalent: if we were speaking of ethnic categories, they would be compared to mestizos. Although they are human, the ahuaques vision, their way of perceiving their surroundings, differs from the Nahuas'. Based on the accounts of graniceros, the difference lies in the fact that Nahuas "see" with the eyes of the physical body, whereas the ahuaques "set with the eyes of the spirit body. Where the Nahuas see spirits, the ahuaques see actual human bodies: for them, the disembodied human spirit is a body. They see themselves as made of flesh and blood, and they see the granicero, who visits them in his dreams, the same way. Things that humans perceive as unsubstantial or ethereal, like scents, smoke, vapors or gases, are dense substances, solid materials, tangible matter in the eyes of the ahuaques. The aroma of cooked meat, the pungent smell of pulque and the perfume of fruit and flowers are the same as the object from which they issue, and are thus edible, drinkable, touchable. Ahuaques also have a very different perception of the rocks in and around mountain streams, disrupting the flow or lying deep beneath the surface. These boulders, often curiously shaped, are their homes, and it is said that every day at high noon, they exit them through tiny doors. What the Nahuas perceive as weather phenomena—clouds, rain and hail—are food for the ahuaques, edible fruit. A rainbow is the colorful manifestation of the ahuaques breath. This is precisely what shamans'"dream training" entails. Graniceros must learn how to see and understand the underwater world through the eyes of their spirit bodies. Acquiring these perceptual skills, gaining the spirits' perspective in the dream state, is at the core of their initiation. To a large extent, learning how to "dream" is about learning how to "see." Thus, while regular dreamers might speak of images and figures in terms of what Westerners call the symbolism behind dreams, graniceros understand that dreams must not be interpreted, because it is not about deciphering their hidden symbols, but rather about understanding the world from a new perspective—a perspective that one must acquire in order to truly see. When the granicero starts to see himself as an ahuaque and is accepted as one of them, he learns how to adopt the spirits' perspective. He sees the ahuaques as human beings, equipped with a body, a face, distinctive features, clothes and tools. The shaman also perceives aromas or vapors as foods, the same way the underwater beings do. To the granicero, the pebbles or stones on the riverbed are houses identical to those nestled in the mountains. But how does one learn to cultivate the dream experience, if it is so far removed from one's day-to-day experience? Substances 8c Vapors The granicero begins to "dream" immediately after his initiation (after being struck by lightning or an illness). To some extent, these dreams are imposed on the novice granicero by the ahuaques, who prompt his spirit body to make the journey to their world, located among the clouds or underwater in mountain streams. Upon his arrival in the other world, the ahuaques offer the novice granicero a meal, marking the first occasion on which the shaman's spirit body ingests typical ahuaque food, like "beans, sweet peas, squash, other garden vegetables and fruit." From a worldly perspective, these foods are just a mixture of aromas and emanations, but from the otherworldly standpoint, they are actual nourishment, tasting fresh and juicy. Ordinary people are not able to eat in the dream state, and if they unwittingly do so, they will get sick or become trapped in that realm. But for the novice granicero, consuming food in dreams does not represent any risk, since it is part of the process through which he constructs his ahuaque-like spirit body. By eating the food, a friendship is established between the ahuaques and the granicero, who becomes a relative of the water spirits through the ritual. Since everyone involved is a disembodied human spirit perceived as an actual individual, these relationships are equivalent to the bonds built between worldly Nahuas. By consuming the dream food, the initiate partakes in the spirits' feast and thus joins this community of humans, which exists in parallel to the one living in the mountains. These initiation feasts are repeated from time to time during the shaman's life and constitute the setting for the transmission of knowledge: a space is created in which the granicero can learn firsthand about the ahuaques' vision and perspective. The father of a. granicero explained to us that his son had been recruited by ahuaques as a child, when he was struck by lightning, and described his dreams: "When he was a young boy, he would dream during the day. He'd sit in the cornfields and daydream. We'd put a gunnysack under him so he wouldn't be lying directly on the cold ground, but he'd grab it and toss it away, and then quickly fall into another spell. Once the clouds dissipated, he'd rest calmly again. Later, he'd wake up and rub his eyes. Then I'd tell him,'Get up, it's time for lunch!' And he'd respond,'No father, I don't want to eat right now, I'm not hungry. The ahuaques already gave me something to eat."What did they give you?' I asked.'They gave me squash, and peas, and fava beans.' They'd feed him all sorts of vegetables, and yes, I could see his belly looked full." &lt; Everardo Rivera, healing ceremony performed by rhe shaman Don Antonio at the site known as el vientre de Rosita, la Volcana, Iztaccíhuatl Volcano, 1989 &lt; Everardo Rivera, healing ceremony performed by rhe shaman Don Antonio at the site known as el vientre de Rosita, la Volcana, Iztaccíhuatl Volcano, 1989</page><page sequence="11">In this account, the ahuaques encourage the child's spirit body to ascend into the clouds in a daydream. People throughout the region give detailed descriptions of dreams that feature journeys to the otherworldly realms of the ahuaques. The late, well-respected granicero Juan Velázquez told a village healer about a dream he had as a child, when his mother sent him to the woods to fetch firewood. The healer explained: "Daydreaming in the hills, Juan found a small table covered in offerings for the Day of the Dead, heaped with bread, mole, candied pumpkin, oranges and bananas, which belonged to the ahuaques. He saw the food was still warm and fresh, so he started eating. What he couldn't eat, he saved for later, shoving some bananas and oranges into his shirt. Then he got the firewood and returned home. He went to sleep for quite some time, and in his dreams, he heard the ahuaques shouting,'Juan, come join us!' He was startled awake when his mother called him to the dinner table, but he wasn't hungry. Then he remembered he had saved bananas and oranges in his shirt, but they were gone: the bananas had become clouds and the oranges, hail. All that was left in his shirt was puddles of icy water. After that Juan's voice got raspy, as if he'd contracted tonsillitis. He wouldn't get better, and it was clearly the ahuaques doing. He finally gave in and became a. granicero. When he saw dark, menacing clouds form, he'd perform the necessary rituals to respond to the ahuaques, sending the clouds elsewhere." Juan's story illustrates the process through which someone becomes ill during the initiation, when he is recruited and then trains to become a granicero. It also underlines the difference in perspective between the ahuaque world and that of the Nahuas of the sierra. When Juan awoke from his dream and returned to ordinary reality, what were oranges and bananas in the otherworldly realm were hail and clouds in the terrestrial world. These perceptual games, these shifts in perspective, are a crucial aspect of shamanic initiation—of learning how to see through the eyes of the spirits in one's dreams. Translated by Paige Mitchell Thresholds of the Invisible Hie Diviner &amp; the Masseuse: Shamanic Practice in Tepetzintla, Puebla Alessandro Questa In the very beginning, stories sat around the fire telling people to one another. —Roy Wagner 1 It was almost midnight when I stopped the car, after seeing three Totonac women at the side of the dirt road between Tonalixco and Santa Maria Tepetzintla. One of them was elderly and walked with difficulty, holding her stomach with a pained expression. Another very young woman held her up, helping her along as she kept her eyes on the road, hoping someone might come by and give them a lift. The third was a girl only a few months old sleeping on her mother's back. "Where are you going?" "We're going to see the diviner. My grandmother's unwell." "Which diviner? Sostenes?" "Yes. The one in Tepetzintla. But we don't know where he lives." "Get in, I'll take you. I know Sostenes." The diviner and his wife welcomed us into the main room of their house, with the altar lit by heaps of candles. Was he expecting us? His altar—laid out over three wood and metal tables—reflected multicolored light that bounced off religious pictures and statues. A multitude of figures of saints and of the Virgin Mary looked at us from their glass cases with painted brass edges, tangled up in strings of Christmas lights and tinfoil garlands. The profusely decorated altar also had flowers in plastic vases, boxes of candles, incense burners, soft-drink bottles, Styrofoam decorations, salt, family photographs and stuffed animals. "We have a question." "What is it?" Sostenes does not speak Totonac, only Nahuatl and Spanish. The young woman, Rosenda, translated what her grandmother was saying—how and where it hurt, when the pain had started—from Totonac to Spanish. While he listened, the diviner asked his wife for a yard of black ribbon, candles, holy water and tobacco. He took four wax candles and bound them in black ribbon, and then let the paraffin from a votive candle drip into a glass of holy water. The hot paste in the water created curious shapes that refracted the light from the other candles. Sostenes performed several actions while reciting prayers that were incomprehensible to his guests: " Holy Mar... to Bartol... divin... respect... raise... in truth..." The diviner reached into his pants pockets and took out a small piece of quartz and a translucent marble, which he used alternately as lenses, looking through them at the lit candles and at the glass full of wax drippings. Sostenes was trying to see something. Finally, he declared: "You left it at the river, but elsewhere too. I'm going to go fetch it in many places, nine places or more, in Tepango, Zacatlán... it seems there's even one around Amixtlán." "Excuse me, Sostenes"—I interjected, a bit inopportunely, as usual—"but what is it you're going to get in all those places?" "Well, evil, I mean, let's say it looks like sticks tied together with colored threads, bones buried under the house, candles under rocks, things like that." He paused. "And you're going to go to all those places?" "Yes, I go all the way to Puebla and Mexico City, and even farther... here at my altar, I just leave a candle, and that's how I go, I mean, from here." 2 An hour before dawn, we climbed up the hill to the last house. "God bless, my friend, you got here after all. Come in, let me light the candles on my altar"—said Juana. The four of us waited a long while, without looking at each other, still half asleep. "Come this way." Behind the cinder-block house, painted pink with 82 Alessandro Questa</page><page sequence="12">white metal doors and window grates, there was another construction, made of adobe with a low door of rotting wood and a roof of sheet metal and tile. The one room inside was lit with a bare bulb. There were two beds. Anselmo laid down on one, the rest of us sat huddled on the other. "You hadn't come back. Remember I told you that you had to come four times at least so my little angels could help you." The conversation continued as Juana poured alcohol into a glass and crumbled the tobacco from two cigarettes into it. "It's time, my friend." Juana dipped her hands into the tobacco-laced alcohol and then began massaging Anselmos legs, pressing down on his hamstrings and joints. From time to time small dark objects appeared in her hands, which she skillfully deposited in a clear plastic bag on the bed. Because Juanas body blocked the light from the bulb and because the bag was on the dark blanket, we couldn't really see her hands or what she had in them. As the mysterious objects fell into the bag, they made noise, and we couldn't help but count: "...eight, nine... twenty-five..." We tried to see what was in the bag, but all we could make out was a dark blob. "You've got more this time, my friend. Look, look, look... another one."—Juana smiled—"Look, you've even got a bone, looks like a chicken bone. This time they really worked you over, my friend." Juana kept commenting casually about other similar cases, about the horrible things that are forms of" bad air," which she has removed from powerful men that have come to her for help. She told us, incidentally, that her spirit allies cannot be stopped by the political or economic power of any coyotl or mestizo, and that the "bad air" she removed from people's bodies materialized as horrible objects. I couldn't hold back my curiosity any longer. I got up to grab the bag. Juana froze and told me not to put my hand in it. Reaching for the bag, I knocked the light bulb with my head and it started swinging, casting flashes of light on the dark, warm blob inside the bag. It held a damp mixture of pieces of household items, rocks and animal and vegetable detritus: a broken pen, a bone, dried chilies, red thread, metal wire, a plastic lid, newspaper, cigarette butts, leaves and stones. "Why don't you put it over there." It was my turn. I was nervous as I lied down and stared at the ceiling while Juana started looking for the "bad air" in my body. With her kneading, old aches reappeared and I realized I was expecting Juana to discover something new, something different. What is a shaman, a witchdoctor, a diviner? What does their practice involve, technically and otherwise? The two ethnographic sketches above serve to illustrate some of the diverse interactions that the Nahua in the northeastern sierra of Puebla have with disease and its causes; they also make us reconsider our assumptions about the identity and practice of the various ritual specialists, spiritual healers and diviners that academic circles associate with the figure of the "shaman." The practice of indigenous shamanism has traditionally been understood by anthropology as a form of mediation between humans and spirits through the intercession of an expert who attempts to understand both collectives and negotiate between them, normally with the goal of increasing social cohesion and improving individual health. The shaman, the central figure of this scheme, is usually described as a privileged being, endowed with special powers of speech, perception and action. These abilities are grounded in his or her exclusive knowledge of the invisible world of the spirits. Much anthropological literature about shamanism in Mexico has focused primarily on these personae, given their charisma, fantastic stories and creative ritual pronouncements about invisible worlds. With almost equal interest, anthropology has discussed the veracity, efficacy and potential usefulness of "traditional healing" in terms of herbal medicine and physiotherapy. In both cases, divisions have been established between shamanic practices, following, perhaps unwittingly, the logic of the specialization of experts in Western philosophy and medicine. Though it seems that this "anthropological shamanism" assumes the existence of the shaman as the central figure of an academic dialogue between experts, this principle is not so clear in light of the complexity of indigenous praxis. The relationship between indigenous people and spirits transcends the standard notion of the shaman as a singular, charismatic figure. Indeed, the Nahuas' communications and negotiations with various spirits are not limited to the curing of illnesses. Spirits form part of processes associated with the fertility of crops, animal husbandry, weather patterns and even local political transactions. From the indigenous standpoint, shamanism is part of everyday practices that are not centered on an oral cosmology (which anthropology so often emphasizes) and reach far beyond the narratives produced by shamanism itself. Nahua shamanism revolves more around silent practices than the uttering of words. Normally, respected shamans perform in absolute silence, finding most of their knowledge impossible to express since it is based on a person's innate gifts. For the Nahuas, shamanic power lies in the practitioner's perceptive capacities and in the knowledge and manipulation of techniques. Though some of this knowledge is ungraspable and unconveyable, another part of it can be creative and experimental. The practice of interacting with spirits is based on a series of speculative physical actions (vision, transformation, touch) that try to show associations between humans, nature and spirits. It is also based on the potential transformations between these various subject-objects ("bad air" into detritus, illnesses into stones) through adaptive improvisation, creatively using and experimenting with material processes, places and people. This is why, locally, "doing" has a higher value than "saying." v Lorenzo Armendariz, Catemaco, Veracruz, 2005 V Lorenzo Armendariz, Catemaco, Veracruz, 2005</page><page sequence="13">Varied interactions occur day-to-day between people and spirits without the intervention of a shaman, in the fields and on roads, at springs and in temazcales (sweat lodges) or even at home. Most Nahuas in the northern sierra of Puebla are not only able to speculate at length about the spiritual effects or hazards, for instance, of crossing a river in the middle of the night, cutting a tree without asking permission from the forest or leaving garbage in someone else's field; they can also interpret up to what point they must seek out the help of one ritual specialist or another, a healer or a diviner. Added to these processes of discernment and consultation, there is a wide range of non-verbal actions that serve to renew, protect and discriminate between the different spiritual "agencies." Though interactions with spirits can be very dangerous, it would be an oversimplification to say that they are always harmful. The spirits are "grandparents," "lords" and "dwellers" of the wilderness who share their environment with humans and who are included in the latter's social life—in productive practices as well as in ritual celebrations and political processes. Indeed, the people of the sierra, as smallholder farmers, midwives, woodcutters, mothers, dancers, butchers or community leaders, develop experience and technical knowledge in order to protect themselves and redress, propitiate and contextualize their relationships with invisible beings. The introductory vignettes illustrate the actions of two types of specialists involved in very different methods of spiritual and physical intervention. On the one hand, Sostenes detects by sight the harm that someone has experienced through the breaking down—or breaking apart—of their body, where signs of illness are hidden in various places in the local terrain. He functions as a seer or tlamatk, "the one who knows." Using various triggers (light, in the case described), he activates his exceptional perception, in order to reveal the spiritual damage caused by ill-intentioned witchdoctors. Sostenes is someone who got the ilwalalis,"that which is given," at a young age, indicating a different destiny. In his dreams, certain spirits have introduced him to others, and all these beings are tied to the landscape of the sierra: mountains, caves, springs, churches and squares. Each seer receives his main power from a different patron spirit—his kixpatla, or "changed vision." This ability allows him to manipulate, invert or diversify the perspectives between spirits, animals and people. On the other hand, Juana is a masseuse or tejtlachiwilkixtani,"she who removes the filth or bad air." Her practice is based on a different theory of the spiritual world from Sóstenes's. Juana is the daughter and granddaughter of midwives, tesemej (or tese, singular). Juanas mother and grandmother taught her to heal when she was still quite young. This matrilineal inheritance is what has allowed Juana to establish alliances with various spirits or "little angels." With her practice, she cures the invasion of tlajchiwil or forms of'bad air" in her patients. The bad air is a product of envy and evil desires, generated wittingly or unwittingly by neighbors and acquaintances. The tlajchiwil accumulate in different parts of the body and cause discomfort, pain and problems. This spiritual damage, stored inside the body, is expelled by the masseuse. Her hands remove the bad air from the body and it immediately takes the shape of objects that inspired the harm. The masseuse is also an expert at interpreting the meaning of this wide range of objects. As we saw in the example, mass-produced goods, rocks and animal and plant detritus all play a part in this and have specific negative effects on the body. Thus, Juana can tell whether a red thread is a "leash" caused by someone's lust for her patient, if a bone was inserted into the body because of professional envy or if a shard of broken bottle explains an argument between neighbors. She can also tell whether these things were "introduced" on purpose or by accident. After the masseuse has extracted these objects, she burns them in private, and this concludes her intervention. Though the two healers we described resort to different perceptual methods (vision and touch), they both reveal their knowledge in the practice of a series of non-verbal techniques rather than in a text, a metanarrative, a memorized ritual discourse or a negotiation uttered out loud with spirits. Indeed, in a broader sense, shamanism is more about practicing a dynamic technology than about applying a static cosmology. Sostenes and Juana show us a small part of the complex web of relationships that the Nahuas maintain with the world today. But they also reveal something more important to us, and that is differences of opinion. The knowledge and experience of contemporary indigenous societies—and surely of historical ones, too—do not depend on a single, monolithic, totalizing cosmology; rather, these societies express their vitality through dynamic tensions, disagreements and a cultural openness to constant change that inevitably leads to reflections of a philosophical, moral and political nature. To see, to interpret and, crucially, to intervene in the actions of the spirits is what the real power of the shaman is all about. This power is not limited to the cosmological knowledge of a handful of shamans, but rather disseminates itself in a broad range of often-discordant local practices and theories. These silent debates within indigenous societies— evinced in everyday practices and, consequentially, in divergent theoretical principles—allow us to glimpse the diversity, history and creativity of indigenous experience. Indeed, in their dealings with the spiritual world, the Nahuas construct politically inclusive social models that are eminently interspecific and irreproachably human. Translated by Jill Derais Revelations of the Invisible Nahua Shamanism: The Necessary Darkness Iván Pérez Téllez Over recent decades, the Nahua community of Cuacuila has undergone an accelerated process of modernization. Nonetheless, the surrounding region of Huachinango continues to be known as a focal point for shamans. Thus, in spite of wave after wave of Catholic and Protestant evangelization and high enrolment in government schools, Nahua shamanism remains strong. This has made some Nahuas uncomfortable, since, despite their efforts to temper their indigenous identity, traditional gods keep intruding upon their lives. Indeed, among the Nahuas, a sort of instability or wildness of the soul threatens both the scope of evangelization and the premises of modern Western schooling, revealing a society strongly influenced by animism. In this context, the arbitrator between the human 84 Translated by Jill Derais IVÁN PÉREZ TÉLLEZ</page><page sequence="14">community and non-human collectivities is the tlamatki: "the one who knows," the one who has been chosen by the gods because he has the tlamatkayotl, the gift of shamanic knowledge that makes both worlds intelligible to him. The Initiation When someone gets sick repeatedly, presenting symptoms of having been chosen by the deities (fainting spells or mimiquilistli, seizures, manic episodes), they are suspected of having the gift. Nahua families normally refuse to accept this fact at first, since it is a sign of paganism, of indigenousness, not entirely in keeping with modern times. Eventually, they consult a shaman for a diagnosis. According to Nahua beliefs, when otherworldly powers seek an outlet, they set their sight on an uninitiated individual and perturb him so much that he temporarily loses his mind. These powers—spirits or nenenkame, literally/those who move"— can only be properly dealt with after the process of initiation is complete. But they are appeased in the interim through constant offerings of food (wentli) in the caves where they dwell. If the chosen individual rejects the gift or interrupts the initiation process, he is likely to die, since the ultimate way of acknowledging otherness is to become the other. The uninitiated person is being asked to join the ranks of the deities, but in this case it occurs before his natural death. Something similar occurs, for instance, with certain illnesses associated with the Lord of Water, who, by giving away his clothing (itlake atl) to someone, can make him ill. The ailing individual must recognize the Lord of Water as a person whom he has unwittingly offended. He must make offerings and tell the Lord of Water, "I don't like your clothes," or else he will die and become a water spirit. The period of illness constitutes a type of apprenticeship. During the initiation, which lasts roughly a year, a novice accompanies a shaman on a series of trips to grottos to make offerings of flowers, candles, and especially food. On each of these occasions, the shaman introduces the apprentice and invites the "hill-people" to his future initiation ceremony on the agreed-upon date. In a way, this already entails a commitment, since, even though the period of initiation varies depending on the available economic resources, the apprentice shows that he accepts a relationship by following the protocol, whereby the deities stop being disruptive. To some extent, the initiation seeks to give the powers something physical to focus on besides the apprentice shaman. In order to achieve this, a chest (kaxaktli) is made, which contains six chunks or "bodies" of copal incense ( kopali) clothed in colored tinfoil and placed on miniature chairs. All this forms a replica of the "host cave." The enveloped pieces of copal serve as transitional bodies so that the powers may reach the shamans altar (iyantli) and be consulted. The altar must also replicate the darkness that the non-human powers need, since deities can only display their agency, their ability to act in the world, in the gloom of the cave, in the dark of mythical time and of the night. To finalize the initiation process, a rite named Wey Xóchitl is performed in one of the regions main caves—Xochitepek, Kusasantla or Sempoaltepetl—to invest the copal bodies with power and to create an invisible, remote link between the cave and the shaman's altar, the latter being a replica of the former. This is achieved by taking soil from inside the cave to the novice's home and burying it at the base of the altar, and by placing the six copal bodies, brought to life with the blood of small birds, inside the chest or kaxaktli. The House of Souls: The Altars Cave-Like Darkness The process of linking the cave to the altar is complex and delicate, since it involves taking soil from the host cave and burying seven small portions (xopechtle) of it on the way from the cave to the shaman's altar. The first portion is left in the cave, the others at different points along the way, but mainly on the shaman's property: at the gate to the yard, under the front door, in the center of the house, and under the altar. All of these spots are marked by stone slabs. The smaller portions buried along the way, which sometimes incorporate the carcasses of small birds, are designed to attract the shaman's future clients. Upon the death of a shaman, however, the connection between the cave and the altar must be severed. Otherwise, the deified shaman will recruit a family member to look after and "work" with him. Since Nahua shamans are asked to interact with the deities before their natural death, they are fated to join the nenenkame when they die; in the past, in a predominantly agricultural context, they were believed to become atmospheric phenomena—lightning people, thunder people, cloud people, fog people—joining the non-human collective that was responsible for storms. Different tales describe how atmospheric phenomena are actually people wearing suits of fog, lightning, thunder, rain, etc. Thus, to avoid a family member's forced recruitment or even death, the deposits must be unburied—especially the bundle containing the pieces of copal that established the connection between the cave and the altar—and returned, along with the rest of the ritual artifacts, to the host cave. On the final day of the initiation, six children (three girls and three boys) are made to carry all that is needed to build the altar: tables, the trunk, the miniature furniture, and ritual fetishes, which normally consist of twelve copal "bodies" and an equal number of birds. People dance to violin and guitar music—xochisones—with all of the objects at the apprentice's house before "presenting" them in the cave. Six of the birds taken to the cave have their throats slit, and with the blood, the shaman lends power to six copal bodies and buries them in the cave. A similar action is performed with the six remaining birds and copal bodies, which are left under the new shaman's altar. The offering of these ritual objects concludes the entire initiation process. It bears similarities to Nahua weddings, where the bride is given away at the groom's home, in the way that the powers are escorted from the cave and brought to the shaman's house. Also, the shaman's relationship to the powers is akin to a marriage, since following norms a Iván Pérez, agricultural and prosperity ritual, Yelotepelt Hill, Cuaxicala, Puebla, January i, 2013 a Iván Pérez, agricultural and prosperity ritual, Yelotepelt Hill, Cuaxicala, Puebla, January i, 2013</page><page sequence="15">of sexual propriety is essential if the shaman and his or her nenenkame are to get along. It is said that the shaman "must respect" his altar in the same way that one respects a spouse, since the nenenkame are xochitl, which means "flower" but also "sacred." Another name for the performer of rituals is xochitikitine, "one who works with flowers." Here, the term has a sacred connotation, and thus the powers are also known as xochitlakame, "flowered men," and xochisiwame, "flowered women." A shaman and his or her nenenkame are always of the opposite sex, and at least one of these spirits will have the status of auxiliary consort. In this sense, the rules governing a shaman's sex life are so strict that he normally only has one child, and not always a biological one. The Nahuas consider that procreation is not so much a biological event, but rather something that is granted by non-human powers. It is possible to think that it is the nenenkame that give the parents their child, or that at least allow it to live, and thus conception is not seen as that important. When someone has not yet accepted her "gift" and takes offerings to caves in order to delay her initiation, she must not have children. If the uninitiated were to conceive one, it most likely would not survive, since the nenenkame would claim it as one of their own and incorporate it into their collective. The relationship that the non-human powers establish with the shaman demands constant attention. Every day at dawn, the shaman burns incense at his altar and makes sure the candles are lit. Every Tuesday and Friday—itonal yeyekatl,"the windy days"—he places new flowers on the altar, while on the main feast days of Catholic liturgy, he must make food offerings of atole and tamales. At the end of the year, he must restore the six pieces of copal kept in the trunk, since they too deteriorate. Year after year, the copal bodies end up accumulating'things that are told to them" as the shaman consults them. In this context, perhaps the most rigorous demand to which shamans are subjected is sexual abstinence through most of their lives, as prescribed by their nenenkame. In order for their ritual work to be effective, they often cannot have sex with their human partner. If they do, they may once again succumb to illness or delirium. To a certain extent, the shaman's activity also depends on the type of nenenkame with which she has bonded, since the Nahuas believe there are three types: the hardworking, the lazy and the untamed. The hardworking obey social conventions and understand reciprocity: from early on, they make sure the shaman looks after them and also tends to patients, since it is their job ( tekitl) to heal. Lazy nenenkame make the shaman sleep constantly and keep her from working. Untamed nenenkame shun social conventions, possess the shaman impulsively and can drive her mad even after she has been initiated. Whichever type of nenenkame the shaman works with, they are sheltered in the darkness provided by the altar. The deities are used to living in the shadows of the cave. The shaman always uses ritual discourse (tlamatkatlatoli) to communicate with them. Communication is possible between humans and non-human due to the fact that the deities also possess an inner being similar to that of humans, though tiny in size. Since they lack a body that would allow them to interact with the human world (tlaltikpak), the shaman must make them "bodily envelopes" to inhabit. Indeed, since our bodies are so different from theirs, encounters between humans and non-humans are desultory, and tend to be detrimental to humans when they do occur. Thus, though a great number of beings inhabit the Nahua cosmos, interactions with them are rather infrequent, and it is not always obvious when they take place. However, non-human powers are able to show themselves as they truly are in one's dreams: the deceased grandfather (mihki or yeyekatl) appears as he did when he was alive, while the rainbow (ayukusamalotl) can take the form of a boy, the moon (wekapantlakatl), that of an elderly man, and water (iteko atl), of a man or a woman. But to receive an offering and to interact with the human world, they take the form of tiny beings, which is why they are given food in proportion to their size: small tamales, atole in tiny cups, small pieces of bread. Something similar happens at human burials: the deceased person is buried with miniature utensils and dishes to take on his journey to Miktlan. In this way, since humans and non-humans share an inner being—conceived as a miniature version of the human body—they are able interact and resolve conflicts of interest under the right circumstances. When Gods Need Bodies Nahua shamans fabricate miniatures so a deity may temporarily acquire a physical body and interact with them, and occasionally, with other people participating in a ritual. It is also possible for the shaman's body to serve as a receptacle for the different non-human powers, as long as she remains cloaked in the altar's darkness, along with the rest of the fetishes. The dead can then temporarily inhabit her in order to speak to their relatives, as when an inheritance has to be divvied up, or when death is sudden and the family needs to speak to their deceased relative one last time. Something similar used to occur with agricultural deities that heralded the rain in community rituals, or with the souls of people who had traveled outside the community. The shaman is thus needed to deal with the absence or loss of a loved one, with the apparent silence of divinities, or with trouble in general. Nahua shamanism operates on the basis of a lack of meaning in the face of the "silence" of things that are apparently inert or not entirely visible (fire, water, the mountains, the dead), but that nonetheless reveal their power or agency when they have been ignored or somehow made angry. Translated by Clara Marin Invisible Presences The Movement of Things: Darkness, Silence 8c Absence in Eastern Tepehua Shamanic Rites Carlos Guadalupe Heiras Rodríguez To fill a silence, to offset an absence, to dispel the darkness or to use it to transform the world, in other words, "to make things move": that is the intent of Eastern Tepehua shamanism. The ritual aimed at this goal is called Jalakilhtúntin in Tepehua (literally, "the movement of things") and costumbre in Spanish, "custom." If these rites concern the community as a whole, they are called costumbres grandes, "major customs." In these ceremonies, the Tepehua call forth the rain or ask for it to stop, they give thanks for the corn before it is harvested, or they mark the start of the sowing 86 Carlos Guadalupe Heiras Rodríguez</page><page sequence="16">season, coinciding with a changeover in the community's leadership. However, when the rites are aimed at recapturing a sick persons lost soul, bidding farewell to a dead persons soul, welcoming a newborn, cleansing an abandoned house, settling disputes among the living or resolving problems with the dead, they are called "domestic customs." Somewhere in between communitarian and domestic customs, we find the Katanit or "customs of promise," in which shamans give thanks to the gods for their gift. Tepehua shamans are exceptional men and women who collaborate under a gendered division of ritual work. They are denominated healers, seers, witchdoctors (not necessarily in a pejorative sense) and midwives (who are exclusively women). In the Tepehua language, female shamans are called haat'akuunü and male shamans, haapapaana. The condition for undertaking a shamanic rite is to establish a relationship between humans, non-humans (supra-human divine beings, the dead, who used to be human, and infra human animals) and human fragments—i.e. the many souls that conform a complete human being (the Tepehua believe women have twelve souls and men, thirteen). Of all the unique tasks that shamans from the southern La Huasteca region perform, the one that has attracted the most attention, since the beginning of the twentieth century, is the making of anthropomorphic cut-paper figures depicting various non-human or partially human entities. This ritual tradition is common among the Nahuas of the Huasteca, the Eastern Otomi and the Tepehua, but is most often associated with the crafts of the Otomi community of San Pablito, The Eastern Tepehua combine this ritual tradition with the making of tied bark figurines, like those made by the Totonac of the La Huasteca region of Puebla and Veracruz. The shaman lends a presence to the non-humans and quasi-humans, rendering them visible, by clothing the figurines. Thus, he makes up for the absence or the invisibility of these entities. After the shaman callr them forth with the cut-out paper or tied bark figurines, humans can attempt to communicate with them, and ask them to help them with their crops, with their way of life or with ensuring that the community's members maintain cordial relations. If the rite involves a sick persons absent souls, the shaman can be a mediator in order to reincorporate them into the patient's body and bring about a recovery. These interactions require humans to make offerings of incense, food and drink: copal or frankincense, soft drinks, beer, liquor, coffee, biscuits, bread, to which can be added chicken or turkey blood, or sometimes the whole, cooked, sacrificed animal. The blood plays a crucial role in the rite, as it establishes a kinship, a blood tie between humans and non-humans, or between humans and their errant souls. For all these transactions, a shaman must be present to utter the ritual litany. Fertile Words Like many other indigenous Mexican peoples, the Tepehua employ traditional agricultural techniques centering on the cultivation of corn. Though the Tepehua also traditionally hold jobs as day laborers, clerical workers and small business owners, the ritual life of the community is still based on farming. One agricultural rite is the "custom of young corn," and confronts the community with non-human groups like the dead, divinities and animals associated with corn. The rite establishes a relationship with these animals, feeding their spirits with blood to prevent them from ravaging the crops. The shaman cuts out figures of these animals without speaking to them, but not because he will not heard. Indeed, the words of the shaman always find eager listeners, which in the case of the "custom of young corn" are corn seeds, i.e. the spirits of the plants that are cultivated. In this rite, the dead and divine beings are made present, and the shaman speaks to them in order to end the silence that exists between them and humans, since maintaining this silence means that the dead will inflict illness upon the living, and that divinities will punish humans with failed crops. During the cleansing ritual, or Katálakapalháu, which takes place before any "custom," the shaman asks the dead to free any human soul they may have captured. Soon after the rite is over, he entrusts someone to dispose of the figurines he used in the wild where no one can find them, effectively banishing the dead from the community. In this way, the shaman eliminates their presence for a few hours, for strictly ritual purposes, only to restore it immediately afterwards. The dead are present among humans more often than is desirable, since they are attracted by anger, contention, envy, rumors, jealousy and adultery. The shaman asks the divine beings present in the seeds to bless the whole community, to lend it their support and to ensure bountiful harvests. It is hoped that the divinities will watch over all the plants in the fields and help them grow. Their presence is desired because food shortages are always a threat: crops can fail for a variety of reasons—for instance, soil depletion, erosion, too much sun, too little rain (the consequences of climate change, I would say)— but most importantly, because people are gradually casting aside the tradition of the "customs." Light 8c Shadow In the past, when traditions were more broadly respected, "major customs" were often celebrated over the course of several days. Now celebrations almost never last more than a single night, beginning in the evening and ending the next day before noon. One exception is the "New Year custom," which signals the end of the sowing season and celebrates the changeover in community leadership. The festivities reach their emotional peak when the first rays of the sun light up the altars of houses facing east. This is also the case of the "custom of promise," in which the shaman, who this time becomes the patient, is cleansed and bathed by the rest of the community, including other shamans, in the warm light of the dawn. In the "custom of young corn," laypeople and shamans alike kneel facing the sunrise while throwing corn seed, beans, squash seeds and marigold petals into the air like confetti, which is later gathered up v Carlos Heiras, Tepetate, Ixhuatlán de Madero, Veracruz, 2012 v Carlos Heiras, Tepetate, Ixhuatlán de Madero, Veracruz, 2012</page><page sequence="17">again to be conserved for sowing the following season. This moment of lucidity follows a night of dancing and ritual that shows the deep ecstasy of Tepehua mysticism, as the laypeople address a strange prayer to the sun, some silently, others mumbling out drunken words. Blood sacrifice is essential to the "custom of promise" and the "custom of young corn." The sun is believed to emerge from its voyage through the underworld towards dawn thanks to the life-giving blood that humans have awarded it. In the bright light of morning, the custom concludes with a dance. The laypeople carry a table that symbolizes the terrestrial plane, with its four corners, its center covered with offerings, like an altar. It is the earth in its cosmic dance, lit by the radiant sun of dawn: this is the culmination of'the movement of things" that sheds light on the darkness. Since the goal of certain collective rites is to defeat the forces of the night and kindle the rebirth of the sun, the nighttime is also essential: the hours of darkness permit the transformation that makes it possible to offset an absence or interrupt the silence. Renewed Ties The ritual treatment of certain ailments is based on the establishment of durable social ties; illness is the result of a social relationship gone bad, one that must be mended: unresolved disputes must be ritually arbitrated, otherwise they may become chronic, or even lead to someone's death. Such a situation calls for a collective custom named Tamaóshamishín. If the parties in dispute are alive and their differences reconcilable, they are persuaded to meet and to come to an agreement. If they have irreconcilable differences, then one of the parties in the dispute must be "replaced," so that the "surrogate" and the surrogate's spouse can make peace with the sick person and their family. The surrogate will ask for the afflicted party's forgiveness, and also forgive them, in order to resolve the conflict, without the intervention of the actual disputant he represents. After the reconciliation, the surrogate severs relations with the rehabilitated person and their family. However, if a relative, living or dead, is the one being "replaced," the surrogate keeps playing his role permanently, and the sick person's family relations are reconfigured for good. Ten years ago, the community of Tepetate was the setting for a typical case of a reconciliation ritual. It involved a man who had died while he was still angry with his daughter and son-in-law for getting married without his permission when they were younger. Years into her marriage, long after her father had died, the daughter got sick. Under these circumstances, the reconciliation mechanism allows the dead father to be replaced by a new one. Thus, his "new" daughter and "new" son-in-law ask to be forgiven (for their disobedience) in order to rekindle a relationship that was disrupted many years ago. The "father of custom" will never refuse to forgive his "new" relatives, and he will ask them to forgive his stubbornness. The surrogate father and his wife need to reestablish blood ties with their "new" relatives. The shaman persuades souls to travel from one body to another by transferring the blood of the "new" parents to their "new" daughter. In order to do this, the parents each prick one of their toes, and the shaman daubs this blood on various parts of the sick daughter's body. The new daughter and son-in-law apologize to their new parents, and also forgive them. The laypeople are responsible for filling the silence, and offsetting the absence, by saying prayers and singing songs that allow the parents to become present again. Translated by Jill Derais Invisible Bonds Knowing How to Smoke: The Therapeutic Practice of the Mexicaneros &amp; Tepehuanos of Durango Neyra Patricia Alvarado Soli's Among the Mexicaneros (Nahuas) and Tepehuanos living in the Huazamota River valley in Durango, the knowledge and training someone has to cure "delicate" illnesses—the initiation they must have followed—is described as "knowing how to smoke." From a local perspective, illnesses are the result of not having followed ritual prescriptions: not having made the offering of a candle to a patron spirit, having sexual relations on a fasting day, eating salt, not taking part in the collective rites (el costumbre), or not properly bidding farewell to a dead person's soul. The symptoms of illness are diarrhea, vomiting, drowsiness, lack of appetite, wasting away and death, and this can happen to adults, children or animals. These illnesses cause conflicts within families and among members of the community. The therapeutic practices that are used to treat them depend on the attending specialist and the illness, which is conceived as social and compels the reestablishing of both individual and collective health. These specialists are called curander in Nahuatl and mag'm in Tepehuano. They "know how to smoke," they know how to pray and divine; their initiation is seen as the equivalent of what the seminary is for Catholic priests. Their communication with extraordinary beings defines them as shamans. They undergo a five-year initiation, during which they fast on hilltops and make reed arrows, to which they attach beads, cotton balls and the feathers of different birds. Their knowledge and ritual practices allow them to manipulate the forces of the underworld and those of the celestial world. One of their most important rites involves bidding farewell to the soul of someone recently deceased, with all of the family members participating. Before the appointed hour, everyone makes an offering of a ball of cotton and a ball of wool to the shaman, with which he makes white and black yarn. After everyone has assembled in the yard, sitting in a line, the specialist calls the dead person, talks to him, offers him some of the food that everyone has prepared and suggests the dead person speak with each family member to settle any quarrels. Then he winds the cotton yarn between all the attendees, tying them to it as if it were a sort of guide. He removes it and later places it in the ancestral cave. He then winds the black yarn around each participant but cuts it into pieces, which he subsequently burns as he looks towards the west. The east, the sun and the color white are life, while the west, darkness and the color black are illness and death. However, the latter also engender life: this is the case of the Mexicanero myth of the sacrifice ofTepusilam, which created the landscape as we know it today and the movement of the world.
