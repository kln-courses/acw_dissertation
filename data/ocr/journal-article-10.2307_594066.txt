<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SACRED TREE ON PALESTINE PAINTED POTTERY HERBERT GORDoN MAY GRADUATE SCHOOL OF THEOLOGY, OBERLIN COLrL1GE THE SACRED tree is one of the more common symbols on Palestine painted pottery of the Late Hyksos and subsequent periods.1 It is normally the palm tree, and the bunches of dates may be recognized even in the more conventionalized designs. The usual forms have two bunches, one on each side. Several late Hyksos examples ap- pear with simply the two bunches at the top of a bare trunk.2 Associated with the tree on this painted pottery are birds, fishes, and animals, often in heraldic arrangement and depicted in the act of eating from the tree. It is not always easy to identify the horned animals on either side of the tree, but in the majority of instances they may be goats.3 Gazelles or stags sometimes appear. On the Late Bronze Age pottery offering stand from Megiddo there are lions beside the sacred trees.4 and a decorated jug from Tell-el- Fara presents a total impression of goats ( ?) and doves on opposite sides of a square in which there is a lion, and perhaps the lion is here a substitute for the usual tree.5 On the inscribed ewer from 1 For a collection and description of such designs on pottery from the late Hyksos, Late Bronze, and Early and Middle Iron Ages, see R.

The horned animals with the tree seem to characterize the post-Hyksos period, while the birds with the tree, without the animals, are found in the late Hyksos period. 251</page><page sequence="2">252 Herbert Gordon May Tell ed-Duweir occur a lion, stag, doe, and bird, while the animals on either side of its seven-branched tree are goats." It has been reasonably argued by Vincent,7 Engberg,8 and others that the tree in these painted pottery designs is a religious symbol, representing the sacred tree. The present writer would demon- strate that it is to be regarded, at least occasionally, as a symbol for the mother goddess. We may begin by noting a Mycenaean ivory from Minet el-Beida depicting the mother goddess with grain in her upraised hands, while on each side of her is a bewhiskered goat, standing with its hind feet on the ground and its front feet against the goddess." Although this is an imported Mycenaean ivory, representing typical Mycenaean art, yet it does suggest the key to the interpretation of the painted pottery tree design with a goat or goats on either side, wherein the sacred tree is the substitute for the mother goddess here depicted. The goddess as the center of an heraldic arrangement is common in Minoan-Mycenaean art, and very frequently she is not actually depicted, but in her place between the two animals appears her symbol, such as the star, mountain, altar, or baetylic column.'0 In Mycenaean art the sacred tree stands primarily for the mother goddess, as many illustrations show.1' She is represented in vary- I J.

The lion on the above-mentioned Tell el-Fara vessel is possibly a symbol of the goddess and a substitute for the sacred tree. The lion is, of course, a common symbol of the mother god- dess, and the lions on the Megiddo offering stand beside the trees may give a hint of the significance of the trees. The association of the birds, very often doves, with the tree, especially in the late lyksos pottery, points to the same conclusion. Three designs from Tell el-Ajjul, depicting the dove perched upon the top of a tree,13 recall the Middle Minoan III bronze votive tablet, picturing a dove perched on a sacred tree, with a fish nearby.14 The association of the fish with the tree recalls the deity Asherah of the Sea, and the fact that the Old Testament Asherah is a tree.15 In one painted pottery design, besides the goats, there is a fish on each side of the tree. The fishes are connected with the tree by a stream (?) flowing from the tree to their mouths.'6 One may compare the frequent Mesopotamian representations of the mother goddess with two fish-filled streams flowing from a vessel in her hands,17 or the Egyptian tree goddess with streams issuing from her vase. As we shall see, the Megiddo offering stand provides a signifi- cant example of the tree with streams.'8 12 See, for instance, the signet ring showing the advent of the goddess in a bark. She has dismounted from her throne, which is overshadowed by her sacred tree: Arthur Evans, Palace of Minos at Knossos II (London, 1928) 250, fig. 147 a. She is also represented in ecstatic dance, with an attendant plucking fruit from the sacred tree: Arthur Evans, Palace of Minos at Knossos III (London, 1930) 142, fig. 93, and p. 140, fig. 91.

There is the late nineteenth dynasty stele of Tehuti-iletep and Kayay, with a goddess pictured in a sycamore tree, giving food and water to a man and woman kneeling before her. The goddess bears the name of Isis on her head, and holds in her right hand a vase from which issue four streams of water, while in her left hand is a tray of food.1"l Hathor is designated as " mistress of the sycamore," 20 and the goddess Nut appears in a sycamore in a vignette of the Book of the Dead.2' The date palm is clearly as- sociated with the goddess on a nineteenth dynasty Egyptian relief, in which the palm tree has human arms and female breasts, one arm holding a jar from which two streams issue, and the other holding a tray of food.22 It is with the palm tree that we are primarily concerned, and we may note the palm tree as it occurs on the later cylinder seals and reliefs of Mesopotamia, where it is more often associated with a goddess. Danthine's study shows this clearly for the scenes in which the palm tree appears with the seated deity.23 The seals seem to play all possible variations on the theme of the sacred tree. Some are reminiscent of the painted pottery designs, with goats, Megiddo sherd, pl. XL, fig. C, has the same dotted circles which occur on the Megiddo pottery offering stand. Streams are also doubtless intended on the Early and Middle Iron Gezer sherds, ibid. pl. XLI, figs. 0, P, R, cf. also fig. K. l9See M. A.

Danthine objects to the interpretation of the tree as a symbol of the goddess, preferring to consider it a symbol of vegetation behind the seated vegetation deity, since the same divinity is not always associated with the same type of tree or plant. The goddess is associated with the palm tree on a seal from Ur, depicting a procession of three approaching the seated goddess, behind whom is a palm tree with boughs and fruit. See L. Legrain, " Gem Cutters in Ancient Ur," Museum Journal XX (1929) 295 and pl.

We need not stress the point that the Asherah was a sacred tree, symbol of the goddess, probably represented with the branches lopped off.26 In Genesis 35: 8 we are told that when Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, died, she was buried below Bethel at the foot of the oak, which came to be called the Oak of Weeping. This tree seems originally to have been associated with the mother god- dess, one of whose chief roles was lamentation for the dead god. The name Deborah signifies a bee, and the Canaanite mythology may have been influenced by Hittite myths, for it was the humble bee, who in the Hittite mythology, was sent by the Lady of the Gods to search for Telepinu, and succeeded in finding him.27 The Oak of Weeping (nZZ 1VX) connotes that wailing rites were customarily performed at this local sanctuary. The tradition of the burial of 24 See Ward, op. cit. 229, fig. 701; p. 238, fig. 714; p. 225, fig. 680; von der Osten, op. cit., pl. XXI, fig. 292; pl. XXIV, fig. 360; pl. XXXI, fig. 458, etc. For discussion of the Mesopotamian sacred tree, see A. Jeremias, op. cit. 89 ff. Otto Weber suggests that the motif of the animals on both sides of the sacred tree lost all connection with the cult and became purely ornamental: "Altorientalische Siegelbilder," Der Alte Orient (1920) 119. Contrast N. Perrot op. cit. 19 f. An Assyrian cylinder seal associated the palm with armed Ishtar: Ward, op. cit. 248, fig. 751. 25 On the stele of Ur-nammu from Ur the palm tree in the hourglass offering stand seems to have symbolized the goddess, for an actual frag- ment of such a stand bears a cartouche with the words: " Property of the Moon Goddess "; see L. Legrain " Scene of Libation to the Enthroned God and Goddess," Museum Journal (1927) 83 ff. The sacred willow tree, planted on the banks of the Euphrates, is brought by a goddess to the holy garden of Ninanna in Erech, and after it is cut down by Gilgamesh, it is used for the throne and couch of the goddess Inanna, according to a Sumerian creation myth: see S.

This sacred tree was associ- ated with the goddess, even as the sacred pillar at Bethel symbolized the god. That the tradition of the burial of Deborah here is ultimately mythological in its origin is made plausible by the incident earlier in the same chapter. Jacob buried at the foot of the sacred tere- binth at Shechem the foreign gods of his household. The tale is an attempt to purify the Jacob saga from the rather obvious polytheistic elements apparent in the references to the teraphim. It is difficult to credit Jacob with such monotheistic zeal, and it does not sound reasonable that he would have buried pagan gods beneath the ground of a sanctuary which he considered holy and legitimate. The original narrative may have stated that Jacob buried 'eldhim (= teraphim) at the foot of the sacred terebinth, and the 'eldhim may have been the clay images of the mother goddess.29 If so, the story may evidence the association of the goddess with the tree at Shechem.30 The parallel with the Deborah tale is obvious. 28 One might perhaps object, and argue that the burial of Saul beneath the tamarisk tree at Jabesh Gilead, which means, of course, at the sanctu- ary, would as well imply the association of the sacred tree with the god (1 Sam. 31: 13). In answer it may be pointed out that the burial of Saul here is a tale of historical origin and character. Saul was buried here as many a Sheikh has found his burial place in the shade of the sacred tree at the modern weli. In the case of Deborah, however, we are dealing with a tradition grounded in Canaanite culture, and with an incident of dubious historicity, strongly colored with mythological conceptions. We will not deny that the sacred tree might be associated with a god, and at times this is its significance. See Jer. 2: 27 and the place-name mtn aYr in Judges 20: 33; see the discussion by A. Lods loc. cit. Compare Cant. 2: 3 and 8: 5. It is, however, to be noted that the name ?)n, as a personal name, is given only to females, viz., the daughter-in-law of Judah, the daughter of David, and the daughter of Absalom. 29 See H. G. May, Material Remains of the Megiddo Cult 26 ff. For heldhim = teraphim see H. G. May, " Ephod and Ariel," AJSL LVI (1939) 47 ff., and the bibliographical references there. 30 This and the Deborah tale may reflect the belief that the deity was actually buried at the foot of the tree, perhaps in some "holy sepulchre " cave. If so, at least in the Deborah tale, we may have something reminis- cent of the dying vegetation goddess, as we certainly have, for instance, in the prototype of Jephthah's daughter, in Judges 11: 29 ff.</page><page sequence="7">The Sacred Tree on Palestine Painted Pottery 257 Two passages in Canticles may throw light upon our problem. In Canticles we have preserved for us a liturgy whose origins are to be ascribed to early Canaanite days. 31 The maiden speaks to the youth; in 8: 5. "Beneath the apple tree I awakened you, where your mother was in travail with you. where she who bore you was in travail." The symbolism here is based upon the conception that the tree god- dess gave birth to the vegetation god. A Tammuz liturgy refers to " the sacred cedar where the mother bore him." 32 There is a myth of Adonis, according to which the god was born from a myrtle tree, the bark of which burst after ten months gestation, allowing the infant to come forth. The mother's name was Myrrh, and she had been changed into a tree soon after she had conceived the child.33 Plutarch (De Iside et Osiride) relates how the chest in which Osiris had been concealed floated to Byblos, there to be en- closed in the trunk of an erica tree, and to be released later by Isis. This and the account of the sycamore tree which enveloped the embalmed body of the god are echoes of the same motif.34 In fact, there is probably some not very distant connection between the Djed-column and our passage in Canticles.85 The other Canticles passage is 7: 8-10. Your very stature is like a palm and your breasts like clusters. I said, let me climb the palm tree, let me take hold of its clusters, 31 See T. J. Meek, Hebrew Origins (New York, 1936) 140, and biblio- graphical references there. 32 See S. Langdon, Tammuz and Ishtar (Oxford, 1914) 11. ss For bibliography see J. G. Frazer, Adonis Attis, Osiris I (New York, 1935) 227; ibid. II 110. 84 See J. H. Breasted, Dawn of Conscience (New York, 1934) 95, 101; J. G. Frazer, op. cit. II 9. ss Petrie is not wrong in interpreting in the light of the conception of the deity in the sacred tree the following reputed saying of Jesus in the Oxyrhynchus Papyri: "Raise the stone, there thou shalt find me; Cleave the wood, and there I am." See the text in G. A. Barton, Archeology and the Bible (Philadelphia, 1937, 7th ed.), p. 550.</page><page sequence="8">258 Herbert Gordon May And let your breasts be like clusters of the vine, and the breath of your nose like apples, And your palate like finest wine, flowing pleasantly into my mouth, stirring my lips and teeth."8 The same identification of the bunches of dates with clusters of grapes appears on the Mycenaean signet, where the branches of the sacred tree of the goddess terminate in clusters of grapes.37 More important, however, for our theme is the characterization of the clusters of the date palm as the breasts of the goddess. On the above-mentioned Megiddo pottery offering stand the tree on the left side on the front of the stand as it appears in the Illustrated London News possesses two bunches of dates so depicted that there can be little doubt but that they smybolize the breasts of the god- dess. It may also be significant that the trees on the side of the offering stand to the left of the one we have been describing disclose streams flowing from beneath the date bunches as well as from the branches, and we recall the glyptic representations of the deity with streams, the water flowing not from a vase, but directly from the upper portion of the body. We have here a clear illustration of the remark made by Vincent fourteen years ago, that, symbol and image being interchangeable, the sacred tree can naturally take the place of the anthropomorphic image of " la divinite jaillissante." 38 If in the painted pottery designs, as in our Canticles passage, the clusters of the palm symbolize the breasts of the goddess, we can understand why only two bunches are normally depicted, and this makes more intelligible the Tell el-Ajjul late Hyksos sacred tree with only the two bunches of dates and no branches at the top of the trunk. A palm tree symbol of the mother goddess is implied also in Judges 4: 5: "And she (Deborah) was sitting 89 beneath the Palm Tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel, in the highlands of Ephraim."

It is, of course, recognized that frequently the god, or even Gilgamesh, as well as the goddess, were depicted with streams: see Ward, op. cit. 289, fig. 881; p. 276, figs. 835, 836. 3H Hebrew n:1=. For a study of this term, which may be especially</page><page sequence="9">The Sacred Tree on Palestine Painted Pottery 259 The presence of a sacred palm tree of Deborah in the same vicinity where there was also the Oak of Weeping of Deborah suggests the existence of at least two sanctuaries at which a goddess Deborah was worshipped in the Canaanite cults of an earlier period.40 It is more than probable that the prophetess-judge Deborah received her name as a result of some special connection between her family and this local sanctuary.4' Much more data could be adduced to support the interpretation of the sacred tree on the Palestine painted pottery as a symbol of the mother goddess. Space forbids further elaboration, and enough has been presented to make clear the line of argument.42 significant in this connection, see W. C. Graham, " Some Suggestions To- ward the Interpretation of Micah 1: 10-16." AJ8L XLVII (1931), 239 ff. 40 The interpretation of 7111:1 1in as a place name (see The Bible, An American Translation, ad loc.) does not vitiate this discussion, for the place-name would have arisen as a result of the presence of the local sanctuary with its sacred palm associated with Deborah. Note also the place name ?1n Adz in the same general district. Danthine associates this picture of Deborah beneath the palm tree with the glyptic representa- tions of the goddess seated at the foot of a palm tree: op. cit. 101, note 1. 41 We may add that J. M. P. Smith's excellent translation of Hosea 14: 8 (The Bible, An American Translation, ad loc.) shows the association of the goddess and the sacred tree: "What more has Ephraim any need of idols? I am his Anath and his Asherah; I am like a green fir tree; From me is his fruit found." "Danthine concludes that the sacred tree is essentially a symbol of fer- tility and fecundity, acquiring little by little a prophylactic value. She explains certain scenes where it might be argued that the tree is a symbol of the deity by the assumption that the tree was also more than a symbol, containing within itself a " numen de fertilit6," and by virtue of this could be associated with all the fertility deities, particularly with the great goddess Ishtar. See Danthine, op. cit. 152 ff., 162 ff. While the variety and number of divine personalities associated with a variety of trees may render difficult any precise definition of the relation between the tree and the anthropomorphic deities, this does not mitigate the fact that the sacred tree is closely related to the goddess, and may at times appear even as a substitute for her, and we may describe it as her symbol. The snake, which also appears as a symbol of the goddess, has at the same time other asso- ciations and a variety of meanings.</page></plain_text>
