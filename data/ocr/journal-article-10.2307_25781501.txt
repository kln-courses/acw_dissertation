<plain_text><page sequence="1">KICKING AGAINST THE THERMOLATERS: Beckett's "Recent Irish Poetry" Sinead Mooney "Recent Irish Poetry" (1934), while well-known to Beckett critics, has most frequently been read only in terms of a straightforward binarism between "antiquarian" Celtic twilighter and modernist "other." This essay attempts to move beyond the familiar reading by examining the essay's dialogue with other contributors to the "Irish Number" of The Bookman in which it originally appeared, to survey readings of the text as Irish modernist manifesto, and to treat it as a "precipitate in prose." Beckett's characteristically abrasive, Poundian review essay, "Recent Irish Poetry," appeared in The Bookman's special "Irish Number" in August 1934, under the pseudonym "Andrew Belis." After its rescue from pseudonymity in The Lace Curtain in 1971, its reprinting in Disjecta and, more recently, in the Field Day Anthology, it has received continual attention from Beckett critics, and, more recently, critics interested in national or regional varieties of modernism.1 The vast majority of the attention "Recent Irish Poetry" has received from Beckett critics has simply registered in passing a straightforward binarism between "antiquarians" and "others," a cloying and conventional revivalism opposed by a reactive poetic modernism predicated upon modernist rupture. "Recent Irish Poetry" has, in fact, tended to provide an easy shorthand for those critics primarily interested in adumbrating a Beckett who is an ahistorical pessimist, whose paucity of geographical reference suggests an allegory of the 'human condition', or an absolutely transcendental articulation of the human plight. In its savage disdain for Irish subject matter, the essay has provided an easy staging-post for an argument which sees Beckett as purging himself of 'parochial' Irish subject matter and pointing</page><page sequence="2">30 Sinead Mooney ahead to a mature career of entirely hermetic writing. However, the text deserves a more careful reading than this simple binarism, which smacks too much of what Beckett excoriated as the "danger" of the "neatness of identifications" in his "Dante ... Bruno . Vico .. Joyce" (Disjecta,l9-33, 19). This essay aims to recontextualise the essay in its original Bookman context, and amidst contemporary Irish cultural debates, to survey some of the critical readings it has generated, but also to treat this remarkably abrasive, haughty and allusive piece as a text in its own right, a "precipitate" to be set alongside the interpolated essays in aesthetics which stud Dream of Fair to Middling Women and the poems of Echo's Bones. The chief contention of "Recent Irish Poetry" is well known, and easily reduced to its constitutive parts. In characteristically argumentative tones, Beckett, as "Andrew Belis," delineates a distinction between those among the "younger Irish poets" influenced by the Revival and those who are aware of, and influenced by, the currents of European and Anglo-American modernism, listing "Corbiere, Rimbaud, Laforgue, the surrealistes and Mr Eliot, perhaps also [...] Mr Pound" (Disjecta, 75). The former camp - among whom are listed those Beckett sees, somewhat simplistically, as the progeny of Yeats - Austin Clarke, Monk Gibbon, FR Higgins, James Stephens and a host of more minor figures - are dismissed as "antiquarians," anachronistic hacks purveying second-hand, sub-Yeatsian "Ossianic goods"; the latter group, among whom he names only Brian Coffey and Denis Devlin, but which includes, by implication, himself, receives a somewhat grudging approval for its "awareness of the new thing that has happened" (Disjecta, 70). The Beckett reader is most familiar with "Recent Irish Poetry" as presented by Ruby Cohn in her 1983 collection of Beckett's journalism and miscellania, Disjecta. Unannotated and presented in the context of Beckett's other writings, it is hardly surprising that it has most often been treated by Beckett critics as merely Beckett's individual kicking against the pricks of the now-stale pieties of the Celtic Revival, a salutary, if predictable, reaction to the contemporary cultural pieties of his native country. It is fruitful, thus, to encounter the essay in its original form in the "Irish number" of the London periodical The Bookman, published in August 1934. Literary journalism being no private speculation in a vacuum, but rather, as Jason Harding notes, "an intervention in an ongoing cultural conversation" (1), "Recent Irish</page><page sequence="3">Kicking Against the Thermolaters 31 Poetry" in The Bookman acquires an entirely new set of contextual meanings, and emerges as profoundly involved in the contemporary debates on Irish cultural issues, and the question of appropriate literary forms for the new state that continued to enliven the letters pages of Irish publications, and spilled over into the British periodicals.2 There was, of course, no "natural" Irish home for Beckett's vituperative brand of dissent from contemporary pieties, no "little magazines" such as existed in Paris; had he remained in Ireland, The Bell might have been an obvious organ for Beckett's writing, but, as matters stood, Seamus O'Sullivan's The Dublin Magazine, relatively apolitical, was the least of the available evils, and the only regular Irish outlet for his stories and poems during the 1930s. By 1934, however, Beckett was based, albeit unhappily, in London, undergoing therapy at the Tavistock Clinic and, with the sales of the recently-published More Pricks Than Kicks proving dismal, attempting to make a living from literary journalism in English periodicals. (That the language of analysis forms something of a subtext to "Recent Irish Poetry" is no coincidence; the "breakdown of the object" is not unrelated, symbolically, to Beckett's own breakdown.) "Recent Irish Poetry" was not the result of an independent choice of topic, but a commission from Hugh and Ross Williamson, The Bookman's editors, much as his first radio play in the 1950s came about in part at the behest of the BBC Third Programme. In both cases, external factors brought about a text which would not otherwise have occurred, and which is in part a re examining of the possibilities and limitations of a particular mode, whether radio play or critical essay. The Bookman's Irish Number offers an abbreviated account of reactions to post-Partition Ireland's impact on literary activity, with the blurring of lines between Church and State leading at best to social conservatism and a pervasive philistinism, at worst to the draconian culture of censorship which resulted in the 1929 Censorship of Publications Act which would form the basis for Beckett's next Bookman commission. One of a series of "national" issues, the Irish Number was followed in September 1934 by a Scottish issue and in November by a Welsh one, before the December issue in which Beckett reappears with two reviews, "Ex Cathezra" and "Papini's Dante" (Disjecta, 11 and 80). All three issues dedicate a large proportion of their space to considering contemporary cultural currents and aspects of national identity, though the Irish issue, unsurprisingly in view of the relatively recent achievement of Irish political independence, is an</page><page sequence="4">32 Sinead Mooney edgier, more multivocal and more unsettled affair than either of the other two. The range of voices encountered in The Bookman Irish Number strongly suggests a microcosm of the cultural shift from the exhilaration of the Celtic Revival proper - when a broadly inclusive cultural nationalism had, arguably, inculcated an authenticity in literary endeavour, and invigorated pre-independence writing with a variety of passionate and heroic symbolism - to the more restrictive ideologies of the Free State. This is aptly illustrated by a full-page cartoon by the illustrator and Punch contributor Thomas Derrick, which depicts "The Celtic Twilight" as a violent storm scene; a sinking Galway hooker, a beached corpse, and some terror-struck shawled women huddled by a thatched ruin suggest the ruin of hopes and the severe restrictions of economic opportunity, as well as the unlovely reality of the current period of self imposed cultural confinement and provincialism - an unlovely dawn, or sardonic postscript to the dreams of the Celtic Twilight. The exaggerated demesure of "Recent Irish Poetry" is more understandable in the light of the kind of insularity demonstrated in "The Trend of Anglo-Irish Literature" by Norreys Jephson O'Connor, which criticizes the Celtic Revival for the opposite reason to Beckett, for its failure to "fully accomplish its purpose - the setting forth in lasting literary form of the tales and legends of literary Ireland" and disapproving of the turn towards "Russian and other continental authors - an attitude strengthened by the experimentation and the growing reputation of James Joyce" {Bookman, 232). Closer to Beckett's own preoccupations is a short story by Frank O'Connor, on the opposing page to "Recent Irish Poetry." Entitled "The Man That Stopped," it both looks ahead to the eccentric tramps of Beckett's mature writing and offers a satirical quasi-allegory of the Free State. The title character is a harmless solitary who becomes locally notorious for his habit of lapsing into catatonic trances on the street, is harassed by priests, authoritarian policemen and lynch mobs, and ends by becoming the scapegoat of a city, denounced as an English spy. In fact, "The Man That Stopped" encourages a reorientation of the Novellas towards their Free State roots, with their nauseated account of Irish patriotism as anachronistic coprophilia - the excrement of "nauseated time" being "sniffed up" by patriots, faces on fire" {Novellas, 18) - their hostile reduction of Catholicism to a set of "slovenly and wild" gesticulations (39) and their expulsions and wanderings punctuated by suspicious authority figures. O'Connor's</page><page sequence="5">Kicking Against the Thermolaters 33 other contribution to the "Irish Number" (like Beckett, his double contribution is concealed under the use of baptismal name and pseudonym), sandwiched between "The Man That Stopped" and "Recent Irish Poetry," is a more robust and direct dissection of the government-directed attempt to Gaelicise the education system. Its broadsides against a language "which no one seems to have the desire to use [...] except those with nothing to say" (Bookman, 240) inform to some extent the disdain "Recent Irish Poetry" manifests for Austin Clarke's Celto-Romanesque experiments in incorporating some of the technical features of Gaelic poetry. Considering "Recent Irish Poetry" in its Bookman context, surrounded by other contributors debating the nature of "Gaeldom" should alter our reading of Beckett's use of "gael" and "antiquarian." Too many Beckett critics have interpreted "antiquarians" as a simple slur on the outmoded forms of the revivalists. However, the specific "antiquarianism" of the Irish revival involves what is essentially a racial politics. For of course, the "rupture" espoused in "Recent Irish Poetry" is not a merely formal one. It enacts a sharply-felt but displaced ideological dissent from the normative narrative of identity which prevailed in the Free State. It also offers an implicit riposte to the propaganda of Moran and Corkery, in particular the latter's insistence, in Synge and Anglo-Irish Literature, on the normative and normalising function of a national literature, the continuity between individual and national identity (Corkery, 2-3). Against this obligatory national narrative Beckett musters all his considerable iconoclastic powers, opposing to the "incorruptible, uninjurable and unchangeable" position of the "accredited" national poet his vision of the "rupture of the lines of communication" (Disjecta, 70) in racial as well as aesthetic terms.1 Though Moran and Beckett, ironically, join in their dislike for the Revival, Moran's belief in the necessity for a pure Gaelic strain in the new Ireland, his promulgation of a narrowly racial identity and a singular, monolithic version of the nation's birth, would become more specific targets of Beckett's ire a year later in "Censorship in the Saorstat", but are implicitly so in "Recent Irish Poetry," which finds aesthetic correlatives for issues which are also political, arguing against cultural isolationism, and for internationalism, for Ireland's literature to submit itself, like Coffey and Devlin, to the influences of the French avant-garde and Pound. This rejected racial identity emerges if we unpack one of the text's most striking and characteristically multilingual and multi-layered</page><page sequence="6">34 Sinead Mooney allusions - its praise of Denis Devlin's "Est Prodest" for not "proceeding from the Gossoons Wunderhorn of that Irish Romantic Arnim-Brentano combination, Sir Samuel Ferguson and Standish O'Grady" (Disjecta, 76). Here the 'fathers of the Irish Revival' are both belittled as 'gossoons' (a lowly youth or lackey, corruption of the Irish garsuri) and relativised by being compared to the collectors of an early 19th-century collection of folk-songs, Das Knaben Wunderhorn (1806 8). Even though Devlin is here being damned with faint praise by Beckett's suggestion that his work is derivative of Eluard - whose work, like Beckett, he translated - its most important feature for Beckett is not where it does derive from but where it does not. Eluard and French surrealism offer an attractive escape route in the otherwise omnipresent matrix of Ferguson and O'Grady-derived material, the brush with which the "antiquarians" are tarred, the family likeness of the revivalist works Beckett is rejecting. Perhaps even more than Yeats, the embroiderer-in-chief whose artistic potency Beckett cannot help acknowledging even as he disparages it, O'Grady and Ferguson are the figures against whom Beckett must stage an Oedipal revolt. Recently, "Recent Irish Poetry" has generated repeated readings as a 1930s Irish modernist manifesto, such considerations constituting some of the more nuanced accounts of the text. Patricia Coughlan, in an important essay on Beckett's 1930s poetry, regards 'Recent Irish Poetry' as an instance of classically modernist insistence on the "processual qualities of self and world" - as distinct from their realist accommodation - already stated in his study of Proust three years earlier, with Schopenhauer's proposed dissolution of the body-mind and self-world dichotomies as its philosophical underpinning (Coughlan and Davis, 179). Coughlan's argument for Beckett's primarily disjunctive or deconstructive brand of modernism, rather than the mythopoeic modernism of Yeats, supports John P Harrington's sense of "Recent Irish Poetry" as in some sense the "work of angry young man repudiating his elders" ( 29), and further links the text's staging of an aggressively Oedipal break with the fathers of the Revival with the period of psychoanalysis Beckett was undergoing at the time of writing and with the intensely Oedipal contemporary poem "For Future Reference." The iconoclastic energies associated with the destruction of father-figures are also much in evidence in the well</page><page sequence="7">Kicking Against the Thermolaters 35 known 1937 letter to Axel Kaun, which is replete with images of violent destruction, of tearing, boring, assault {Disjecta, 170-3). Certainly, in its insistence on novelty - the "new thing which has happened", and the concomitant problematisation of literary conventions - "Recent Irish Poetry" could be read as offering an impatiently belated version of Woolf s account a decade earlier in Mr Bennett and Mrs Brown of the famous "change" which took place "in or about December 1910." This awareness of modernist rupture is seen as finally limping onto the Irish scene, impeded, according to Beckett's account, by an anachronistic continued reliance on outdated Celtic thematics, the "segment after segment of cut-and-dried sanctity and loveliness", as he dubs it, in one of several sardonic misquotations of Yeats {Disjecta, 71). However, "Recent Irish Poetry" has also become a central text in a recent spate of studies of Irish poetic modernism - with MacGreevy, Devlin and Coffey, Beckett's modernist pair and middle man as significant figures - for whom the text as manifesto deserves analysis for its part in articulating and popularising a tendency to oversimplify Irish poetic modernism into, on the one hand, a rejection of Yeats and Revival and, on the other, a compensatory embrace of Joyce and modernist rupture. The division of Irish poetry into what John Wilson Foster has called the "Romantic" and the "pluralist" is deeply unsatisfactory in many ways, requiring the conflation of Yeatsian revivalism with "myth" and Joyce with reality, ignoring the mythic investment in Ulysses and Finnegans Wake, and suggesting, finally, a monolithic understanding of both Revival and modernist poles (217). In fact, far from being mutually incompatible, critical consensus would now promote a view that it is precisely the Celticism of the revival, via 18th" and 19th-century antiquarianism, that makes it part of European modernism. Beckett's "Recent Irish Poetry" for Davis and others is, thus, an influentially and substantially wrong document, which falsely conflates the cultural nationalism of the revival, with its mission of representing Ireland to itself, with the autonomous, politically independent entity of Free State Ireland and its far more obviously ideological self-images, as promulgated by the arch-polemicists of Irish Ireland, and de Valera. Beckett, whose own brand of modernism is deconstructive, embraces a willed placelessness, and is markedly influenced by the continental assaults made on institutional art by surrealism and Dada, simply does not recognize the modernist elements of the revival, in part because of its emphasis on an essential Irishness</page><page sequence="8">36 Sinead Mooney he deems ossifying. Similarly, he omits or deforms the modernism of both Yeats and Clarke, so that, as Davis points out, "Beckett's Yeats and the younger antiquarians are largely straw men, his depiction of the Revival a burlesque" (143). Certainly, "Recent Irish Poetry" is a violently personal and idiosyncratic piece of work, with exaggerated antipathies which do seem to be out of all proportion with the slight and conventional poetry against which they fulminate. J.C.C. Mays, in his introduction to his 1989 edition of Denis Devlin's Collected Poems describes it as "bear[ing] the same relation to reality as an infra-red photograph which obliterates contours" (Devlin, 26). While the essay is savagely contemptuous towards the Revival, its account, on the other hand, of those modernists who oppose the "antiquarians" is half-hearted at best. Devlin and Coffey may be, for Beckett "the most interesting of the youngest generation of Irish poets," but, he does not "propose to disoblige them by quoting from the volume of verse which they published jointly in 1930" (Disjecta, 75), thereby suggesting their achievements are more potential than actual. What appears at a cursory glance to be an essay taking up a coherent critical stance dissolves on closer reading into a curiously clotted affair of coinages, misquotations and segments of bravura sarcasm. In fact, "Recent Irish Poetry," entirely in line with the rest of Beckett's work, is no satisfyingly transparent text through which we can look to some extra-textual "reality." We are on firmer ground reading "Recent Irish Poetry," as John Pilling suggests, if we regard it as a "precipitate in prose" in its own right, to set beside the poetic precipitates of Echo's Bones which appeared the following year (123). If we regard "Recent Irish Poetry" as a "prose precipitate", its chief "characters" are the head antiquarian Yeats and his imitative mob, opposed by the "others" - the ambivalently-praised MacGreevy, the barely-differentiated modernist "pseudocouple" Coffey and Devlin. What, then, does Beckett do with these creatures his irascible critic/creator Belis has more or less fashioned, having marshalled his dramatis personae into their constituent camps of "antiquarian" and "other"? Beckett proceeds to enact critically his own theme - that it is the "act" and not the "object" of perception that matters; the poets (or "puppets") of whom he writes never emerge as individuals in their own right, as he is far more interested in his own responses to them. Alex Davis is right to note that Beckett merely "deploys his contemporaries, at least in part, as vehicles</page><page sequence="9">Kicking Against the Thermolaters 37 for his own animosity" (16). He does, however, manage a surprising number of textual effects using his rather pallid material, perhaps anticipating his later experiments in renunciation and permutation. The individual "antiquarians" or "twilighters" upon whose reliance on outmoded forms, aesthetic primitivism and identitarian politics Beckett waxes so harsh, have received little or no critical attention in commentaries on "Recent Irish Poetry," in part because Beckett's derisive rhetoric does not allow any of them to emerge from the fractured surface of his prose with any clarity. Yet it is worth considering how Beckett selects and constructs his chief "straw men," and how he deploys them in "Recent Irish Poetry," particularly in his somewhat slapdash quotations from individual poems. Let us select two representative individuals, Monk Gibbon and James Stephens. It seems likely Beckett had read Austin Clarke's 1932 Observer review of Monk Gibbons Seventeen Sonnets (1932), in which he derides Gibbons Hopkinsesque "experimentation" at the expense of the simplicity and child-like nature of his earlier collection For Daws to Peck At (1929), "which achieved singular notice, for it was mentioned publicly by a Prime Minister" ( 54-55). Beckett also sees Gibbon as a representative figure, but unlike Clarke, finds him representative of a negative trend, his elaborately child-like stance laughably philistine; the "seed" in the short quotation (again, with mistranscriptions) from the poem "Remorse" (For Daws to Peck At) used in "Recent Irish Poetry" is the seed of "philosophy" - "too small you'd think to do much wrong" - which, sown within the heart of the careless poet, comes to "stifle song." Hence Beckett's acerbic statement that Gibbon considers thought a "microbe," bacterium or virus, infecting the unself-conscious purity of "song." Beckett's references to "Chacun Son Gout" (For Daws to Peck At) illustrate very precisely his earlier complaint at the thermolaters' limited, celticist "circumference of themes," from which they make their "selection": "On life, on honour, each what will/Strings lyre, harps homage out, his chosen theme" (Gibbon 1929, 16). The quotations from James Stephens' Theme and Variations (1930) and Strict Joy (1931) appear to have been chosen for their emphasis on scenery, innocence and the transformational power of poetry - the poet "as beauty expert" tendency of which Beckett complains. The poem whose title Beckett renders as "Strict Joy" is in fact called "Strict Care, Strict Joy", and is an exclamatory four-part poem in which the speaker annexes himself to the Gaelic bardic line of Raftery and "Egan O'Rahilly" (Aodhagan 6 Rathaille, author of "Gile</page><page sequence="10">38 Sinead Mooney na gile") in his ecstatic ability, via the "strict care, strict joy" of his poetic craftsmanship, to transform misery in life into beauty in art: So Raftery, tuning a blind man's plight, Could sing the cark of misery away; And know, in blindness and in poverty, That woe was not of him, nor kind to him (Stephens 1931,22) One imagines that Beckett, later to become the chronicler of elderly dispossessed wanderers who have outlived their usefulness would have been profoundly irritated by this banalisation of suffering, its "smartening up" of "mournful or miserable" (and thus inappropriate) themes; the bardic lineage he ignores. "Reveries on a Rose," which Beckett offers as a "sample" of the smartening-up process of the antiquarians, is a stilted take on a love triangle mediated via a rose which the beloved woman has given to the speaker while she is with another suitor: He is there, And she is there, And I am here: I think it clear He should be here When I am here (Stephens 1931,21-22) Stephens, thus, is one of the primary targets of Beckett's ire for the "good housekeeping" of his poetic aesthetic, and for his enthusiastic participation in what Beckett terms, playing on "Swedish drill," the "Celtic drill of extraversion" {Disjecta, 73). ("Extraversion" would have been a term familiar to Beckett from the writings of Jung, who noted in 1916 that the "extraverted" individual "gives his fundamental interest to the outer or external world, and attributes an all-important and essential value to it," specifying "regressive extraversion" as a form of hysteria in which "the hysteric projects onto the objective world the illusions, or subjective values of his feelings."2). "Recent Irish Poetry," in its stringently clinical diagnosis of contemporary poetry, diagnoses the "thermolaters," in their "flight from self-awareness," as suffering</page><page sequence="11">Kicking Against the Thermolaters 39 from just this form of "hysterical extraversion," with any element of poetic self-perception sufficing only as a propellant to take the poet outside the self and "land the practitioner into the correct scenery" (Disjecta, 71). However, as well as constituting a sideswipe at the radiant landscapes of the Revival, the metaphorics of space of "Recent Irish Poetry" also suggest some knowledge of Daniel Corkery's rhetoric in The Hidden Ireland (1925) and Synge and Anglo-Irish Literature (1931). Beckett replaces Corkery's insistence on "Irish homeliness," "land" and "nation" in properly representative Irish literature with his skeptical vision of "the space that intervenes" (Disjecta, 70) between the perceiving consciousness and a far from stable world. Instead of the "correct scenery" or, more sarcastically, "decor," which he excoriates as the most "accredited" of the "accredited themes" of the antiquarians (the term seems to suggest a national theme-bank in which Beckett has no credit) we have a characteristically skeptical "no-man's land, Hellespont or vacuum" (Disjecta, 70). The tamed and radiant "accredited" landscapes of the Revival are replaced with a distinctly unheimlich investment in the void. The opposite of the "accredited" Celtic landscape can also be found in Beckett's contemporary poems based on the Provencal dirge or lament in Echo's Bones, with their marred physicality, their anti-anthropomorphic landscapes, their frequent darkness, and in the idiosyncratic and brilliant translation Beckett made two years before "Recent Irish Poetry" of Rimbaud's Le bateau ivre, which has precisely this hallucinatory sense of the natural world as composed of solitary and terrible "objects" which refuse any kind of synthesis or cohesion and smack of the kind of anti anthropomorphism he found so appealing in the landscapes of Cezanne; a landscape, he remarks in a letter written to Thomas MacGreevy in early September 1934 (at the time "Recent Irish Poetry" appeared) "unapproachably alien, unintelligible arrangement of atoms, not so much as ruffled by the kind attentions of the Reliability Joneses."3 "Recent Irish Poetry" is, in fact, a curiosity as a piece of literary journalism. While it wears its homage to the Pound of Make it New on its sleeve, its tone is uneven, its scope of allusion obscure, its form deliberately untidy and ranging from poses of virtual omniscience to declarations of total ignorance - the extraordinary litany of self proclaimed ignorance of the final paragraph, where Beckett deliberately undercuts the sneering omniscience of the preceding judgements by claiming to know "nothing at all" of the poetry of Niall Sheridan,</page><page sequence="12">40 Sinead Mooney Donagh McDonagh, Irene Haugh and Niall Montgomery, in effect, disclaiming competence in the task the review has undertaken, in a pre empting of the mature writing's continual ethics of incompetence {Disjecta, 73). In fact, the piece enacts the kind of rupture it formulates as constitutive of modernism. It is an exploration of "rupture of the lines of communication," and also a practical demonstration of such a rupture, in its elaborate metaphors, ironic montages and uneasy textual surfaces. Like his strictly 'creative' prose - although, I would suggest, the opposition is a false one - his "narrative," such as it is, is full of gaps, slits, "dislocations" that serve as part of the text's metaphorics of rupture, the rhetorical violence with which it combats the "complacency" and "correctness" of the Celtic scenery of the "antiquarians." At this time, Beckett was charmed by Tristram Shandy's wilful incompetence, its narrative full of carefully contrived defects; something of the same "roughness of surface" (Forster, 176) is evident in "Recent Irish Poetry," with its deliberate flouting of the norms of 'competent' critical writing. At the same time, its tone is nervously academic, refuting the glimmer of the Celtic Twilight with the glitter of an ostentatiously multi-cultural and multi-lingual frame of reference. If what Beckett is against emerges much more clearly than what he favours, much as the desire to rupture the smooth surface of conventional narrative emerges in his contemporary "creative" prose more emphatically than what he proposes to erect in its place, the important thing is that the completed work - in criticism as in his poetry and prose of the period - flaunts its own (paradoxically) untidy incompleteness, flouts the "stiff inter-exclusiveness" of "neat construction" he dismisses in "Dante ... Bruno . Vico .. Joyce' {Disjecta 19, 22). It does this, it has to be said, far more successfully than the rather pallid short story, the reticent, sub-Freudian "A Case in a Thousand," which appears in the same issue of The Bookman, which, while it likewise manifests a preoccupation with the psychoanalytical, specifically the oedipal, is altogether a more conventional affair. David Lloyd has influentially pointed out an "aesthetic of non-identity" in Beckett's writing, its rejection of a nationalist literature which serves to 'mediate subject and object, to produce reconciliations between individual and totality', and suggested that the modernist 'homelessness' of his wanderers constitutes a reaction to the Irish Free State (144). In fact, as Beckett's critical writing resists incorporation into the "clear," it also resists incorporation into cultural nationalist</page><page sequence="13">Kicking Against the Thermolaters 41 politics. "Recent Irish Poetry," regarded as a prose precipitate, offers a sample of a narrative stance in opposition to the monologic narrative of Irish nationalist literature, offering instead its savagely untidy, self divided, dialogic non-narrative. Looking ahead as it does to Beckett's mature writing in its self-proclaimed incompetence and its striking lack of the kind of epistemological certainty or closure we expect from criticism or narrative, "Recent Irish Poetry," finally, resembles Bakhtin's well-known concept of the 'dialogic' text, refusing subjection, in either national or aesthetic terms, to a 'finalising artistic vision', destroying the 'unified and integral fabric of narration' (Bakhtin, 198, 14), and, above all, refusing to confirm a particular order of the world as being there, behind the language of the text.
