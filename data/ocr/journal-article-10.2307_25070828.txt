<plain_text><page sequence="1">PURITAN POETICS: THE WORLD, THE FLESH, AND GOD Robert Daly STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO No American Puritan has left us an ars poetica. It is, moreover, difficult to see a pattern of explicit poetics emerging from their scat tered comments (always made in passing in works devoted to other subjects) on the nature and function of poetry. John Cotton declared that a man may be said to commit sin "when he imagineth, deviseth, plotteth sin, as a Poet his fictions" and seven pages later in the same work urged his readers "to turn Poets of righteousness, it is the seed of God that sets you awork." The English Puritan Richard Baxter ended his Saints' Everlasting Rest with a poem from George Herbert's The Temple. Jonathan Mitchell expressed his belief in the important reli gious function of poetry in his commendatory preface to Michael Wig glesworth's Day of Doom: A Verse may find him who a sermon flies, Saith Herbert well. Great truths to dress in Meter Becomes a Preacher, who men's Souls doth prize. Poetry has a salvific function and is therefore part of God's ministry on earth. It becomes a preacher, not merely to write poetry, but to write it carefully and well: No cost too great, no care too curious is To set forth Truth and win men's Souls to bliss. Wigglesworth had done this, and Mitchell commended his poetry, not as a recreation, but as reading of the utmost importance: In costly Verse, and most laborious Rhymes, Are dish'd up here Truths worthy most regard: No Toys, nor Fables (Poets' wonted crimes) Here be, but things of worth, with wit prepar'd. For Baxter and Mitchell, both writing in the middle of the seventeenth century, poetry could be salvific and was therefore important.</page><page sequence="2">Puritan Poetics 137 For one of their eighteenth-century successors, John Bulkley, po etry was a recreation for the idle hours of lesser men. His preface to Roger Wolcott's Poetical Meditations was an embarrassed "Apology for the manner in which this Worthy Person has given us the Ensuing History, in Composing which he has Diverted some of his Leisure Hours." Wolcott's poetry was really metrical history and therefore worth reading. Not central to the man's life, it was merely a diversion for his "Leisure Hours." Wolcott was, moreover, an exception to the rule that "the Accomplished Poet and the Great Man are things seldom meeting together in one Person." For another eighteenth-century American Puritan, poetry was an appropriate pastime for a minister but dangerous if taken too seriously. In his Manductio ad Minister ium, Cotton Mather recommends Virgil as a guide to manners and Homer as a guide to morals, arguing wittily that, though a pagan, Homer has much in common with Puritans: "He commonly pro pounds Prayer to Heaven as a most necessary Preface unto all Impor tant Enterprises . .. and he never speaks of any Supplication but he brings in a Gracious Answer to it. I have seen a Travesteering High Flyer, not much to our Dishonor, Scoff at Homer for this; as making his Actors to be like those whom the English call Dissenters." Though he considers the poetry of Homer and Virgil important enough to de fend (and that of Ovid important enough to decry), Mather advises his candidate for the ministry not to take poetry too seriously. He advises him to write an occasional "Epigram" because "it may a little sharpen your Sense, and polish your Style, for more important Performances." Though the young candidate for the ministry might "make a little Recreation of Poetry," he is solemnly warned: "Be not so set upon Poetry, as to be always poring on the Passionate and Measured Pages. Let not what should be Sauce rather than Food for you, Engross all your Application." Though Mather's warnings continue ("and let not the Circean Cup intoxicate you"), these examples are sufficient to sug gest that by 1726 Mather could recommend poetry only as a pastime, not as an important part of the holy life. When poetry became impor tant, it became dangerous, and Mather-his own deep enjoyment of the classical poets notwithstanding-warns his young ministerial candi date against it as ardently as Jonathan Mitchell had earlier urged his "Preacher" toward it.1 As these examples suggest, scattered Puritan comments about po etry neither add up to any coherent poetics nor illuminate Puritan po etic practice. To understand the ideas and attitudes that obtain in Pu ritan poetry, then, we must turn to aspects of Puritan thought that, though not explicitly literary, have literary implications. Having done</page><page sequence="3">138 Early American Literature, Volume XII, 1977 so, some earlier critics concluded that Puritan thought was inimical to the production of lasting art and poetry. We now know, however, that such art and poetry exist and that their existence and nature contradict some earlier critical generalizations and the expectations engendered by our present view of Puritan poetics. Earlier scholarship suggests several solutions to this problem. One might conclude that different "Puritans" believed different things and that Perry Miller's "mono lithic" New England mind was a brilliant synthesis achieved only in Miller's own mind and was a misrepresentation of a "pluralistic" real ity.2 Or one might posit imagistic, symbolic art as a psychic need so deep and powerful that no amount of cultural iconoclasm could oblit erate it entirely. Allan I. Ludwig has argued eloquently that the ex istence of such art in "iconophobic" New England must be attributed to "a burning need for imagery. It is a need so engrained that even when the mind dreads imagery for fear of idolatry, religious art en dures. The New England Puritans found their need for imagery so great that not even their storied fear of idolatry could come between them and the thousands of stone images they carved and rooted in the hilly New England landscape for a period of some 165 years." Ludwig later extended his explanation to include two other cultures that ex emplified the same paradox: "Nothing testifies more to the need for symbols than the suppressed iconophobia of the Hellenistic Jews, the early Christians, and the American Puritans. All three, to judge from their literature, were aware of the dangers of idolatry and all three have subsequently been found to have had a wealth of religious art no matter what the intellectual elite of the time might have thought about imagery."3 In these cultures, intellectual prohibitions were no match for psychic needs. This argument is useful as far as it goes. But in light of the Puri tan attempts to resolve or at least record their every thought and experi ence, to make sense of their lives, and to search the chaos of experience and history for some perceivable order, it seems unlikely that they would simply carry the contradiction unexpressed throughout one hun dred years of tacit inconsistency. They may very well have found their psychic needs overpowering their intellectual prohibitions: that process may well have been the root cause of their art. But they would cer tainly have attempted to rationalize the process, to make some sense of it, to make it part of a complex but consistent world-view. We may wish to deem their entire intellectual history one long rationalization of dimly recognized psychic needs, but if we are to understand the Pu ritans' conscious motives for writing the poetry they did, we must ex amine that rationalization. We must read carefully the Puritans' state</page><page sequence="4">Puritan Poetics I39 ments concerning those ideas and systems that seem inimical to the production of poetry: their fear of graven images, their Ramism, their contemptus mundi. We must examine other traditions, hitherto largely ignored, in which they also participated: the belief that the sensible world was a book written by the finger of God and that man could read something of God in it, a belief systematized in a kind of typology whose adepts read the world as type and therefore spiritualized all im ages and expressed in a kind of meditation called "meditation from the creatures" in which men used verbal images drawn from objects in the sensible world to raise their apprehensions and affections to God. The fear of graven images was an obsession with the Puritans. Like most of their obsessions, however, it resulted, not in the childish dogmatism imputed to them by some nineteenth-century commenta tors but in a consistent system of clear, taut, definitions and distinc tions. One distinction that Puritans did not make was that between material and mental idols. John Cotton, for example, argued that the Second Commandment "forbiddeth not only bodily Images (graven or molten or painted) but all spiritual images also."4 A verbal idol, such as might be found in poetry, would be as great a sin as a material idol carved in stone. For that reason, Puritan poetry was clearly influ enced by the fear of idolatry; to understand the poetry, we must ex amine the fear. We know that Puritan poets did in fact write and read image-filled poetry. We need to know why they felt they could. We need to know how they defined and recognized an idol. Cross references and marginal explications in the Geneva Bible afford us a clear answer. Though set from different type, the editions of the Geneva Bible published in London in 1582, i60o, and 1616 were identical in text, cross references, and marginal explications. A Puritan using any of these editions would have read in Exodus 20.4-5 the familiar prohibition of idolatry. Thou shalt make thee no graven image, neither any similitude of things that are in heaven above, neither that are in the earth beneath, nor that are in the waters un der the earth. Thou shalt not bow down to them, neither serve them: for I am the Lord thy God a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, upon the third generation and upon the fourth of them that hate me. In this phrasing of the admonition, man is forbidden both to make im ages and to worship them; though juxtaposed, the two are kept sepa rate. In a marginal note to verse four, however, the editors referred the Puritan reader to Leviticus 26.I and Psalms 97.7, in both of which the two prohibitions are phrased as one: "Ye shall make you none idols</page><page sequence="5">I40 Early American Literature, Volume XII, 1977 nor graven image, neither rear you up any pillar, neither shall ye set any image of stone in your land to bow down to it: for I am the Lord your God." In uttering the prohibition more succinctly, the Psalmist de fined idolatry as the worship of graven images: "Confounded be all they that serve graven images, and that glory in idols." In these refer ents, idolatry was defined as the worship of idols, not merely the copy ing of natural objects. In an explanatory note to Exodus 20.5, more over, the editors wrote: "By this outward gesture all kind of service and worship to idols is forbidden," and in a marginal note on the word "jealous" as used in Deuteronomy 5.8 (to which the reader was re ferred by a marginal note next to Leviticus 26.I), the editors explained that God was jealous "of his honor, not permitting it to be given to other." Now, there are other passages in the Bible to which the editors could have referred, passages in which the force of the prohibition is on the mere making of images, rather than the worshipping. That they did not, that they chose passages defining idolatry as the worship of im ages, indicates that they defined and recognized idols according to their usage. An idol was not merely a copy of some material form; it was an object of worship. A Puritan needed only his Geneva Bible to enable him to make that distinction. That Puritans did in fact make the distinction is evident in both their definitions and recognitions of idols. In 1642 John Cotton lim ited his definition of idols to images used in worship. In 1648 the Pu ritan divines gathered at the Westminster Assembly agreed that the Shorter Catechism represented their beliefs. It represented American Puritan beliefs as well. American Puritans, gathered at the Cambridge Synod of 1648, asserted in the preface to their Cambridge Platform that the confession of faith and the longer and shorter catechisms of the Westminster Assembly expressed "not their judgments only, but ours also." They gave their "professed and hearty assent and attesta tion" to "the public confession of faith, agreed on by the Reverend as sembly of Divines at Westminster." The Cambridge Platform was in turn approved by the Reforming Synod at Boston, in 1679; it remained the basic statement of New England Puritanism until the adoption of the Saybrook Platform in 1708 in Connecticut. Few documents, then, are so representative of the enduring core of Puritan belief as the Short er Catechism. To the question "What is forbidden in the second com mandment?" the Catechism's answer was: "The second command ment forbiddeth the worshipping of God by images or any other way not appointed in his word." This same distinction informs Samuel Mather's Testimony from the Scripture against Idolatry &amp; Superstition (1672), in which he argues of the prohibition of graven images:</page><page sequence="6">Puritan Poetics 141 I. That it is not meant of Images for Civil use, but for worship; thou shalt not bow down to them, nor serve them. For the Civil use of Images is lawful ... but the scope of the Command is against Images in State and use religious. 2. Neither yet is it meant of all Images for religious use, but Images of their own devising, for God doth not forbid his own institutions, but only our inven tions.5 Mather's distinctions are precise and clear. Only images used as ob jects of worship and religious images devised by man are forbidden. In September of I655, Michael Wigglesworth recorded in his diary his determination to thank God for His mercies by erecting a pil lar: "In memorial of his former mercies received in answer to prayer and of all his goodness hitherto I will erect EBENEZER, A pillar to the praise of grace."6 Wigglesworth was going to rear up a pillar and a pillar with religious significance at that. Surely he had read Leviticus 26.I; yet, in a journal packed with the tortured self-flagellation of a New England conscience unchecked by any sense of proportion, Wig glesworth calmly and guiltlessly proposed to set up a pillar. He even provided a sketch of this unmetaphorical pillar. Why wasn't it an idol? It was not an idol because he had not reared it up in order "to bow down to it" (Leviticus 26.I). It was not an object of worship. The same definition is implicit in William Bradford's description of the maypole at Merrymount. With references to pagan acts of worship, Bradford described Morton and his followers "quaffing and drinking . . . drinking and dancing . . . dancing and frisking ... as if they had anew revived and celebrated the feast of the Roman goddess Flora, or the beastly practices of the mad Bacchanalians." Because it had be come an object of worship for these idlers, it was an "idle or idol may pole."7 It is clear, then, that the Puritan imagist feared only one kind of image, an image demanding worship. Though hundreds of symbolic images appear on Puritan gravestones, images of God the Father and of Christ are conspicuously absent. Ludwig has observed that "only one direct representation of God the Father is known to exist in New Eng land" (the Charles Bardin stone, carved late in the eighteenth century in that hive of heresy, Rhode Island, and identified by Dickran and Ann Tashjian as a representation of Moses) and that "Christ himself never appeared directly." In Catholic Ireland, scenes from the Passion were often cut on gravestones, and Christ was pictured directly, but no such scenes appear in New England.8 In the only systematic and comprehensive exposition of seven teenth-century American Puritan theology, Samuel Willard's Corn pleat Body of Divinity in Two Hundred and Fifty Expository Lectures</page><page sequence="7">I42 Early American Literature, Volume XII, 1977 on the Assembly's Shorter Catechism, Willard defined idolatry, not as the making or copying of any image, but as the making and worship ping of an image of God: "It is a madness and wickedness to offer at any Image or Representation of God: How many solemn cautions did God give his people against this by Moses, besides the express forbid ding of it in the second Command; and God declares it to be a thing Idolatrous." Preaching in the late seventeenth century, Willard summed up the prohibitions of his predecessors. An idol was differenti ated from a harmless image by its usage. If one sacrificed to an image, undertook to "offer at" it, it became an idol. Any direct representation of God Himself as a person would require worship and would therefore be an idol. To worship such an "Image of God," rather than God Himself, wrote Willard, would be "highly to dishonor him, and pro voke him to Jealousy."9 For the Puritans, not only the worship of a false god, but even direct representations of the true God, religious im ages to which people bowed down in Catholic and Anglican churches, were idolatrous. Images of God's creation, however, linked to Him by His own word in Scripture, were clearly not forbidden. As we shall see when we examine the Puritans' attitudes toward the created world and the proper religious use of it, such images were encouraged. The co existence of Puritan fears of idolatry with imagistic gravestones and poetry, then, derived neither from a paradox nor from the Puritan abil ity to hold in suspension ideas that really contradicted each other. Rather, it derived from a distinction quite clear to the Puritans and not entirely lost on their descendants. Another allegedly baneful influence on Puritan poetry was the pervasiveness in Puritan culture of the rhetorical system of Peter Ra mus. Ramist Puritans were presumed to have separated dialectic from rhetoric, defined the latter merely as the ornamentation of self-evident truths, and considered poetry only a subset of rhetoric in which one applied ornaments more heavily than in prose. A Ramist poem, then, consisted of a central axiom bejeweled with tropes and figures chosen by the poet according to no particular rule. Such poetry was applique work, its decorations adventitious, and its function trivial. Though several critics have agreed that Ramism stultified Puritan poetry,10 they have been unable to agree upon the exact literary implications of Ramism. In 1939, for example, Perry Miller declared that the meta physical style of such as John Donne and Lancelot Andrewes "is to be linked to the Aristotelean logic and rhetoric," that "the theory of the metaphysical sermon is to be found in an adaptation of Aristotle to the</page><page sequence="8">Puritan Poetics I43 needs of the preacher." He attributed "the opposing style, the Puritan form," to the influence of Ramus and asserted that a Ramist poet would ornament his poetry with imagery that was merely decorative. Less than a decade later, however, Rosemond Tuve argued that Ra mus, not Aristotle, lay behind the metaphysical style and that Ramism had effected the replacement of merely decorative imagery by the more functional metaphysical conceit.'1 Such contradictions derive less from critical misreading than from ambiguities in the Ramist system itself. Ramus, with some assistance from his disciple, Omer Talon, whose Rhetoric was written as a companion volume to Ramus' Dialec tic and was re-written by Ramus after Talon's death, divorced rhetoric from dialectic. (He did so only in theory and argued that the two must always be united in practice.) From the time of the Greek Sophists, dia lectic and rhetoric were intertwined, and the traditional five-part rhe toric comprised a fairly complete education, according to Father Walter Ong: "In antiquity a boy was given a foundation of general informa tion on all possible subjects (inventio). He was taught to use this ma terial in composition (dispositio), his mnemonic skill was developed (memoria), together with his literary style (elocutio) and his oral de livery (pronuntiatio). These five activities added up to a rather com plete education program extending over a good number of years.'12 Ramus greatly simplified all this. Since he wanted rhetoric to be com pletely separate from dialectic and since invention and disposition (or judgment) threatened to overlap with dialectic, Ramus decided that they were really a part of dialectic and not the concern of the rhetori cian. Memory he identified with judgment on the basis that judging things properly helps one to remember them. That left within the pur view of rhetoric only elocution, or striking expression, and pronuncia tion, which was ignored in Ramist writings though presumably taught orally. Ramist rhetoric, then, was striking expression, which, Ong has pointed out, "was conceived largely as 'ornament' or 'garnishing'." Though Ramists attempted to dichotomize this category into "trope" and "figure," their division was hardly consistent or discrete: "In the Ramist view trope is always some sort of metaphor, and figure is any thing else that strikes one as unusual." The Ramist rhetorician con cerned himself with ornamenting the truths that he had found and organized as part of dialectic. It was as simple as that. It may in fact seem childishly simple. The recognition that it was so is one of Ong's significant contributions to our understanding of Ramism. Ramus and his followers were teaching children, boys in their early teens. We can understand much of the vagueness and form</page><page sequence="9">144 Early American Literature, Volume XII, I977 ulaic oversimplification of Ramist rhetoric by considering the audi ence to which it was directed. In early Greek education-upon which Ramus based his own system-dialectic was taught before rhetoric. Indeed, as Ong has observed, "common sense would dictate" this or der. Yet "Ramus taught rhetoric as a one-year course before dialectic," a course "comparable to a grade school or junior-high-school subject in America today." As part of the trivia, rhetoric was "the business of youngsters"; Talon was "quite representative of the general Renais sance pattern" in his insistence that in teaching rhetoric "one must have regard for the 'tender' years of his pupils." Rhetoricians were aware that such regard often necessitated simplication and distortion of their subject: Melanchthon defended his acceptance of the "view that dialectic and rhetoric differed in that the former presented things in a naked state, whereas the latter clothed them with argument" by arguing that, "although many persons objected to it, it was one which little boys could understand." Limited to the understanding of little boys, Ramist rhetoric "maintains the low theoretical level enforced on the subject (in postclassical times) by its place in the lower reaches of the curriculum, and evinces no real understanding of the semantic importance of metaphorical or of any similar processes." We may be sure, then, that when Talon wrote in 1545 that "just as wisdom treats of the knowledge of all things, so rhetoric treats of ornamentation and striking expression," he meant exactly that. Though later critics have argued that Ramists, when they wrote of "ornamentation," had in mind something more intellectually respectable than mere applique work, Ong has convincingly demonstrated that they did not, that such Ramists as Johann Bilsten or Johann Alsted defined "rhetoric quite flatly as 'the art of expressing oneself ornately'."13 Clear enough to a child, this definition and the maxims surrounding it have proved puz zling to adults who, by failing to consider Ramus' audience, have brought to the study of his system far more intelligence and sophistica tion than the system will bear. Convinced that cached within the childish maxims of Ramist handbooks was an adult rhetoric, Perry Miller and Rosemond Tuve have attempted to draw it forth, only to come up with contradictory versions of it. Later critics have recognized that Ramism implied no single cogent rhetoric. William Wimsatt and Cleanth Brooks, for ex ample, have noted that the Ramist reshuffling of . . . ancient rhetoric . . . was a procedure of highly am biguous import. It might mean, on the one hand, that a person decided: "Invention and disposition, the two substantial sinews of argument, are really parts of logic. Rhetoric in fact is mainly logic. What good rhetoric wants is a severe and honest</page><page sequence="10">Puritan Poetics I45 style of adherence to argument. The elocution is the trimmings-or the clippings. Save them who will." This in fact was the kind of I7th-century thinking repre sented in . . . the plainish, anti-metaphysical, anti-baroque style which in England would appear in pulpit eloquence, in the scientific writing of the Royal Society, and even in literary prose, for instance, in the lucidly conversational idiom of Dryden. Though the plain style of these examples depended on many more in fluences than Ramist method, it is clear that an adult writer could use his early training in Ramism as a base on which to develop a plain style of writing. But at the same time, a person caught in the consequences of Ramist rhetoric and logic might conceivably entertain a different train of reflections, somewhat as fol lows: "The art of rhetoric, as distinct from philosophy and science, has after all been always a matter essentially of style. Leaving the content and structure of argument, therefore, to the logician, the scientist, the theologian, let me discuss rhetoric in its pure form, that of the figures and tropes."14 Such a person might well move from Ramist maxims to the develop ment of a florid style, as did Ramus himself and the Puritan Stephen Gosson, whose attack on poetry is far more ornate than Sir Philip Sid ney's defense of it. If one believed that all figuration was ornament for a truth that could exist just as well, be just as true, without the gar nishing, one's figures were likely to be adventitious. In theory, then, Ramist method encouraged no particular style to the exclusion of all others. Those trained in its rhetoric could grow up to write metaphysical high style, Puritan plain style, or anything be tween these extremes. What was true of prose influenced by Ramism was true of poetry as well. The man who considered his writing essen tially dialectic would seek to express plain truth: the man who con sidered his writing essentially rhetoric would seek to ornament his writing with figures and tropes. Though Perry Miller has argued that the Ramist necessarily considered poetry a subset of rhetoric, and though Roy Harvey Pearce has asserted that "Ramist logic . .. made dialectics one with poetics," Ramus was not so sure. In Omer Talon's Rhetoric, poetry was treated as a part of rhetoric on the grounds that "it is speech which is out of the ordinary in that, as sound, it attracts attention." Yet later Ramus decided that poetry was "a separate art, like medicine."15 Just as it had implied no single rhetoric, so Ra mist theory implied no single poetics. Poetry was under no theoretical compulsions that would identify it as peculiarly Ramist. In practice the same amorphousness of Ramist influence is evi dent. Father Ong has noted that "Ramists did not write . . . much po etry at all," and from the study of practicing poets influenced by Ra</page><page sequence="11">146 Early American Literature, Volume XII, 1977 mist thought no consistent pattern emerges: Ramism influenced di verse poets, good and bad. Among major poets influenced by Ramism, Perry Miller listed Philip Sidney, who wrote into his Arcadia the fig ures from William Temple's commentary on Ramus; Christopher Mar lowe, who portrayed Ramus' death in The Massacre at Paris "in terms which make clear his intimate knowledge of the doctrine"; and John Milton, who rewrote Ramus' Dialecticae. Among poor poets influ enced by it, Ong mentioned the Jesuit scientist Ruggiero Boscovich, whose five-thousand-line poem entitled The Eclipses of the Sun and Moon explained Newtonian physics, and Paolo Lucini, who wrote a three-thousand-line paraphrase of Newton's Opticks.l6 Neither Ra mus nor his successors, then, wrote deeply and consistently about po etics; nor was any inevitable effect wrought by Ramism upon the po etry of all influenced by it. Nevertheless, one literary implication of Ramism is quite clear. For the Ramist, rhetoric was trivial; rhetorical garnishing was decora tion, fit for children or for the idle hours and mental relaxation of men. If poetry was merely a subdivision of rhetoric, then "poetry was applique work of the worst mechanical sort."17 Had the Puritan poet considered his figures merely decorations, the products of his own mind and imagination, he would have considered them and his poetry trivial. For the Puritan, however, such figures and symbolic corre spondences were not created by the rhetorician and therefore part of elocutio; they were created by God and found in the world by the poet. If they were to be put into the Ramist classification at all, then, they would be classified under inventio as part of dialectic. For the Ramist, inventio (coming from in venire) meant to "come upon," "discover," or "lay open to view"; it is not well translated if we take it to mean "invent" in the same sense as "create" or "make."18 Although the Ramist system implies no particular poetics to the exclusion of all others, it clearly obtains in the poetics of the Puritans, who considered their poems descriptions of God's world, not creations of the poet's fancy. Though Anne Bradstreet's poetry, for example, evinces skill and a deep concern with her art, it was designed neither to demon strate that skill nor to assert her role as a maker of verse, but to respond to the glory of God immanent in the created world and seen, not made, by the poet. Her words to her children might well have been addressed to all readers of her poetry: "I have not studied in this you read to show my skill, but to declare the truth, not to set forth myself, but the glory of God."19 Puritan poetics dealt primarily with perception and articulation rather than with the poet's creation, and the common no tion that Puritan poetry was merely rhetorical decoration applies more</page><page sequence="12">Puritan Poetics I47 to the sugared cliches of eighteenth-century American poets than to the poetry of the seventeenth-century Puritans, whose figures, as we shall see, were part of their dialectic, part of their perceived world. Whether a poet considers his figures and symbols ornaments of his own creation or intrinsic parts of the world he perceives depends upon whether he considers the sensible world intrinsically symbolic. In working out their own view of the sensible world and of its role in soteriology, the Puritans had to reconcile two potentially contradictory traditions. One traditional view of the sensible world was that it was evil, delusory, a prison for the spirit of man. Several heretical Christian sects, among them the Gnostics, Manichaeans, and Cathari, exempli fied extreme forms of this view. Even among the orthodox, treatises on contemptus mundi formed so recognizable a genre that when Lothar of Segni (later Pope Innocent III) wrote in II95 a work entitled De miseria humane conditionis, scribes added the genre prefix by which this classic has since come to be known, De contemptu mundi.20 The poetic implications of such a world view are clear enough. Had the Puritans' contemptus mundi been as simple and extreme as that of the Gnostics, Manichaeans, and Cathars, they could not have celebrated the beauty of the natural world, seen it as the good gift of a loving God, read it for some revelation of His will, and used images drawn from it to figure spiritual states and heavenly delights. Had they been able to write poetry at all, they could have written either poetry comprising only religious abstractions or Swiftian denunciations of a filthy world figured forth in scatological imagery. Secular poetry would have been both meaningless and sinful; sacred poetry of a con crete or symbolic sort would have been impossible. We know, how ever, that the Puritans did write both secular and religious poetry. They found their rationale for doing so in other religious traditions to which they were heir: a tradition in which the created, sensible world was a book written by God as a message, a revelation to his creatures; a tradition of structured meditation first codified by Loyola and made acceptable to Protestant sensibilities in the writings of such Puritans as William Fenner, Robert Dingley, and Richard Baxter; and the branch of that tradition called "meditation from the creatures" of which the American Puritans could have read in Thomas Taylor's Meditations from the Creatures (London, I628) but more probably did read in Baxter's Saints' Everlasting Rest, in a section entitled "heavenly contemplation assisted by sensible objects." That the world was a book written by God to be read by man was</page><page sequence="13">148 Early American Literature, Volume XII, 1977 as much a commonplace among the Puritans of the seventeenth century as it had been among such medieval writers as Alain de Lille, Julian of Toledo, John Scotus, Pseudo-Hrabanus, and Bernard of Clairvaux.21 Though their Calvinist belief in a sovereign God might imply to a modern reader the concomitant nominalist belief in an unintelligible multiverse, Puritans clearly believed that God had created an intelli gible universe. Thomists believed that God was essentially rational and therefore necessarily created both a rationally intelligible universe and rational creatures to perceive it. Puritans put no such limits on the sovereignty of God. Essentially indescribable, God had freely chosen, in an act of loving condescension, to take on the attribute of reason and to create an intelligible universe, not from necessity, but from His desire to accommodate the finite nature of man. God had revealed Himself through His creatures, and man was under a moral imperative to seek his God through the creatures. Their Bible told them as much: "Forasmuch as that, which may be known of God, is manifest in them: for God hath showed it unto them. For the invisible things of him, that is, his eternal power and Godhead, are seen by the creation of the world, being considered in his works to the intent that they should be without excuse" (Romans I.20; Geneva Bible, London, 1582). The Puritan understanding of this admonition is clear in the writings of Alexander Richardson and Samuel Willard. Richardson, an English Puritan minister, wrote that man learns by the creatures of God "to see his order in them." Born without knowledge of the crea tures or their order, man yet possesses natural "faculties" by which he may seek out that order. "And this teacheth man thus much, that he is to seek out, and find this wisdom of God in the world, and not to be idle; for the world, and the creatures therein are like a book wherein God's wisdom is written, and there must we seek it out."22 In his systematic exposition of American Puritan beliefs, Samuel Willard provided the theological rationale for such ascents from the creatures to the Creator as those practiced by the speakers of Richard Steere's Earth Felicities, Heavens Allowances and Samuel Danforth II's "Ad Librum," "God being the great and ultimate Object of Relig ion," wrote Willard, "the knowledge of him is the first thing neces sary to be sought after." The first source of such knowledge, the first medium through which "God would reveal himself to us" is the cre ated world, which both demonstrates God's existence and begins to lead us to him. "The works of Creation do undeniably prove the Being of a God. . . . The things that are made lead us by the hand to him that made them." Admittedly, that part of God's nature reflected to the un derstanding of man through the creatures is not His essential Glory and does not compass God but only, as in the promise to Moses, his "back parts";</page><page sequence="14">Puritan Poetics I49 This Incomprehensible Being hath made such discoveries of himself in his Back Parts, as present him a suitable Object for Faith to rest upon. There are some pre cious rays of the Divinity, that irradiate us by way of reflection; by which we may so far acquaint ourselves with God, as may make us happy. God is called a Sun, (Psal. 84.11). Now if we fix our eyes directly on the body of the Sun, it will wholly dazzle us; but if we look on the reflected light or beams of it, we are safe, and it is com fortable; and so it is here. The Divine perfections are irradiated upon our Under standing through a dark glass . . . which displays of himself to his Creatures, God is pleased to call his back parts . . . because they fall short of the plenary discovery of his Native Excellency, in the immediate unreflected manifestations of it. ... His knowledge of himself, and that knowledge of him which he imparts to us, are infin itely disproportionable. Yet even the little knowledge of Himself which God imparts to us through the two revelations, nature and scripture, is completely suf ficient to our earthly needs and to our salvation. Willard saw God's re fusal to reveal more of Himself as an act of love, an accommodation to the finite nature of man. He cited Exodus 33.20, "Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me and live," and concluded that "in these Backparts is contained all that we can stand in need of. Let us but read over all those Glorious Golden Letters, in which the Name of God is displayed, in his Word and Works, and lay by them the slate of the Believer, lay all of his wants open, take the full account of all that can be thought of requisite to this everlasting Beatitude, and we shall find that nothing is here wanting to answer it to the outside, and beyond that." Through his reading of the world and the Bible, therefore, the Puritan could discover all that he needed to know of God, indeed all that he possibly could know this side of heaven. He could read "the name of God" in His "works" as well as in the Bible. And he could be sure that his perception and reason were giving him accurate, though incomplete, knowledge of God's nature and His expectations of man. Willard believed that faith only confirmed and extended the findings of human reason. "Because Heaven's mode and way is not known unto us, therefore he speaks to us in the language or manner of Earth." It pleases God "to fit his discovery of himself to us to our manner of entertaining it . . . and by such a way we come to see something con cerning him who is himself invisible: and this tells us how useful or necessary reason is to Faith; it being an instrument which is used to convey the discoveries of God unto it; and therefore Faith doth not re linquish or cast off reason; for there is nothing in religion contrary to it, though there are many things that do transcend, and must capti vate it."23 In his attitude toward the religious significance of the created</page><page sequence="15">I50 Early American Literature, Volume XII, 1977 world and the reliability of man's faculties in perceiving that signifi cance, Willard was hardly a lone rebel or a cloistered scholar working out in his study sophisticated heresies that would have shocked the average Puritan. His words were spoken as sermons to the congrega tion at Old South Church in Boston. Had they found his views unor thodox, they could have admonished him, sent letters to other pastors in order to determine his orthodoxy, and finally have voted to replace him. Many other congregations had taken these steps against ministers rash enough to depart, however slightly, from the view of their par ishioners. That they did none of these things indicates that Willard's views were to a great extent accepted by the members of his congrega tion, that they saw the relation between the creatures and the Creator much as Willard did. They insisted, like Willard, that their statements about God could neither compass Him nor say anything of His essence. Such statements applied only to what Willard called His "irradiations" or "back-parts" or communicable glory, human predicates or attributes (such as goodness, rationality, the brightness of a Sun) that God had chosen to take upon Himself so that He could be understood, to a lim ited but sufficient extent, by His creatures. Within the limits set by these qualifications, the Puritans could-for all practical (i.e., moral) purposes-read their world and Bible for reliable, accurate, and suf ficient knowledge of God; they could be sure that such knowledge as God chose to impart through these media was understandable in hu man terms, that their passionate love for an anthropomorphic God was neither sin nor delusion. They could legitimately ascend from predica tions about His creatures to predications about Him who had invested those creatures with meaning in order to make possible just such an ascent. Things not only meant; things meant God and salvation. Such was the Puritans' view of their world and its maker. Living in a symbolic world, the Puritans found types, or symbols, in both their Bible and their own experiences. Samuel Mather had ar gued that man could not make types: "It is not safe to make any thing a Type merely upon our own fancies and imaginations; it is God's Prerogative to make Types."24 But no commandment forbade man to see types, and Puritans saw them everywhere. Though Perry Miller and Ursula Brumm have asserted that Edwards was original in ex tending the typological method from Biblical exegesis to a reading of the spiritual significances of the sensible world, it is clear that this method had been practiced by medieval writers and by the Puritans of</page><page sequence="16">Puritan Poetics I5I the seventeenth century. They, like Edwards after them, saw "the na tural world (the only one accessible to human comprehension)" as "the image of and the key to the transcendent world of religion, which could thus be understood indirectly." Like him, and like their medi eval predecessors, they believed that "the things of the world are or dered [and] designed to shadow forth spiritual things." They, like Ed ward Taylor, saw "the world slickt up in types."25 In 1674 Joshua Moody, assistant pastor at the First Church, preached the election sermon in Boston, using the common figure of human existence as a war and finding in the technical commands of the parade ground and in the movements and accoutrements of battle a wealth of spiritual significance put there by God. He explained the figurative method as the best way to speak of God in the language of men, as indeed the way that God Himself chooses: "As for my man ner of speaking in the using of many Metaphorical Expressions, and Allusions unto the Calling, Postures, and motions of Soldiers . . . I conceive a man should take Measure of his theme to cut out his Lan guage by, and make it up something according to the mode of his Au ditory." Since his theme was the spiritual significance of secular call ings, Moody was careful to point out that God was constantly "spiritu alizing all our Employments" and that his own use of figures was not presumptuous creation, but merely an explication of God's method: "From the King upon the Throne to the Hewer of wood and drawer of water, the Lord is in his Word teaching us by such familiar and known Metaphors taken from those Callings that we are versed in."26 For Moody as for the others, the transcendent God had condescended to treat on man's level, had chosen to be immanent in the world in forms that man could understand. Though they steered a middle course be tween complete anthropomorphism and complete unintelligibility, the Puritans steered rather closer to the former than has been commonly believed. The world they inhabited, no less than the Bible from which they tried to draw the pattern for the perfect church and society, was a communication from God, to be studied closely and explicated accu rately. Though its abuse could lead them from Him, its proper religious use was a "plain man's pathway to heaven." It offered the poet a world rich in intrinsic symbols, correspondences, and significances that were not decorations but necessary parts of the truth he attempted to tell. One way in which the Puritan used the world in his quest for heaven was in religious meditation. Norman Grabo has recognized that "the art of Puritan devotion was basically a method for channel ing emotion into verbal structures-a poetic method."27 Meditation was a central concern for English and American Puritans throughout</page><page sequence="17">152 Early American Literature, Volume XII, 1977 the seventeenth century, and the meditational handbooks used by the Puritans dealt with the essentially literary problem of using verbal methods to arouse and express emotion. So close were meditation and poetry in Puritan thinking that Anne Bradstreet entitled one of her best long poems "Contemplations," Philip Pain entitled his only extant poems Daily Meditations, and Edward Taylor referred to the poems written at monthly intervals for over forty-four years as "Preparatory Meditations." To understand Puritan poetry, and the attitudes toward the world, imagery, and language that inform it, we must examine this system of ideas and attitudes that stood so closely and clearly behind it. Histories of Catholic meditational practices and of Puritan med itation after Baxter have been well told and require no detailed repe tition here. Until the beginning of the seventeenth century, most works on meditation were written by Catholics and brought into England by the Jesuits. From these early writings on, the function of meditation was to arouse the affections and to bring the Christian into more inti mate emotional relation with his God. In his Introduction to the De vout Life, St. Francis de Sales defined meditation: "When we think of heavenly things, not to learn but to love them, that is called to medi tate: and the exercise thereof, Meditation."28 St. Ignatius Loyola provided a relentlessly structured method for the arousal of his love in his Spiritual Exercises. The "Exercitant," as Loyola called the person meditating, was to exercise in sequence three faculties of his soul memory, understanding, and will. Subject matter for the meditation, e.g., doctrine, Scriptural incident, or some object with spiritual signifi cance, was called up by memory, and one first attempted to get as de tailed and vivid an apprehension of it as he could using only his mem ory and imagination. Then one exercised one's understanding, or rea son, upon the image or proposition supplied by memory until, after thorough intellectual examination, the work of understanding was complete. Only then did the exercitant judge the subject and submit it to his will and affections, which were moved to great joy or sorrow. Meditation drove dogma into imagination, enlivened doctrine into thoroughly apprehended truth. Among Puritans this formerly Catholic method of spiritual exer cise received quick and wide acceptance. Answering in I589 the charge (made by the Jesuit Robert Persons) that the English had no devotional writers, Edmund Bunny contended that the Reformers were reading handbooks of meditation. By 1628 they were writing them. In that year, the English Puritan minister Thomas Taylor published his Meditations from the Creatures, "as it was preached in Alderman</page><page sequence="18">Puritan Poetics I53 bury." "I thought fit to afford a little help, to lead up careful Chris tians into this mount of Meditation: in which mount God will be seen." Though "the Lord himself, his Word and Decrees, are the principal object of ordinary Meditation," Taylor wished to extend tra ditional meditation to include among its objects images drawn from the sensible world. He suggests that "so are his works and execution of his decrees a fit object" and cites the example of David, who "ac knowledgeth himself occupied in contemplation of the heavens and stars . . . that he is led to God by them." The relationship between God and the world, then, is not dualistic but hierarchical. God is an author, and the world is His book, to be read by man and not despised, mistrusted, or ignored: "The world is his book; so many pages, as so many several creatures; no page is empty, but full of lines; every qual ity of the creature, is a several letter of this book, and no letter without a part of God's wisdom in it." If the world itself is metaphorical, then "the voice of the Crea tures is not be banished out of the church," and ministers must be metaphorical in their conceivings and their preachings: "If all Scrip tures be profitable to teach and improve, then those that teach divine things from natural." This metaphorical method had Biblical sanc tion, since "the Prophets and Apostles, and Christ himself were most in this kind of instruction, by Parables and Similitudes: therefore Ministers and Pastors may do the like." In focusing on the metaphorical nature of the physical world and the metaphorical language of the Bible, Taylor was moving toward an understanding of meditation as a literary, as well as a religious, ex ercise, and he knew it. Discussing metaphorical predications about the nature of God, he clearly moves into the realm of literary criticism: "Hands and fingers are ascribed to God metaphorically. And here the heavens are called not the works of his hands, but his fingers: to note his singular industry, his exquisite workmanship and art, and also special love and care." For Thomas Taylor, then, meditation from the creatures lifted one's thoughts and affections to God, not by denying the physical world, but by reflecting on it in words, by translating God's physical metaphors into verbal metaphors. The world was a text, a system of metaphors, a language, a voice, and Taylor con cluded his treatise with an appropriate Latin tag: "Vox Dei est in om nibus, per omnia, de omnibus et ad omnia, loquens nobiscum semper et ubique." In the third edition (London, 1632) of this popular book, he provided his own translation: "The voice of God in all the creatures and by them all speaketh unto us always and everywhere." The sens ible world was part of the word-a voice to be heeded, a book to be</page><page sequence="19">154 Early American Literature, Volume XII, 1977 read-and meditation was a verbal, a literary method of practicing one's religion.29 For the Puritans who later came to America, as for Thomas Tay lor, meditation was a verbal method of taking a truth from the physi cal world or of giving life to a truth already understood intellectually by driving it home to the affections, to the nerve ends. In The Soules Preparation for Christ (London, 1632), Thomas Hooker defined med itation: "It is a settled exercise for two ends: first to make a further in quiry of the truth: and secondly, to make the heart affected therewith." That Hooker's meditative technique was metaphorical is clear from his examples: "It is with meditation as it is with usurers that will grate upon men, and grind the faces of the poor, and suck the blood of the needy, they will exact upon men. ... So doth meditation, it exacts and slayeth the soul of a poor sinner, you have committed adultery in a corner but you shall not carry it away."30 For Hooker, the language appropriate to meditation was concrete, imagistic, and metaphoric be cause this kind of charged language would affect the heart. It was not only possible for meditation to use such language, linking the invisible things of God with the visible things of this world-the holy practice of meditation with the cruelty of usurers-it was necessary; it was commanded.31 Early in his career, for example, young John Cotton wrote that "a man that is enlightened with the knowledge of God's will, and the mystery of Salvation; may lawfully in his meditations make use of di verse Creatures or Things, that are apt and fit to represent Spiritual things unto him."32 In I648 the Shorter Catechism of the West minster Assembly, a work which exerted a pervasive influence among Puritans, made the practice of meditation a duty, a necessary part of preparing oneself for the Lord's Supper. However, the most perva sive influence on Puritan meditational practices and the poetry they informed was a book published in England in January 1649/50, Richard Baxter's The Saints' Everlasting Rest, a work so influential among Puritans that until recently scholars assumed that it was the first Puritan treatise on meditation and ignored its predecessors. Well qualified to succeed in making acceptable to his fellow Protestants Catholic methods of devotion, Baxter had sided early with the Puritan cause and had served as a military chaplain in the Parlia mentary armies during the Civil War. Though he contributed to the Restoration, he turned down the bishopric that would have been his re ward and suffered sufficiently under Charles II and James II to qual ify for popular investiture as living Protestant martyr. In 1659 he was to publish A Key for Catholicks, to open the jugling of the Jesuits, a</page><page sequence="20">Puritan Poetics I55 work which would have cleared him of the charge of being soft on Catholics, had anyone thought to make it. His Saints' Everlasting Rest appeared almost exactly one year after the execution of Charles I. Nine editions in twelve years bespeak a ready audience. Called by one scholar "one of the most popular Puritan books of the entire seven teenth century" and the major book of a man whose "various works were common to the libraries of both New England and the southern colonies,"33 Baxter's enormous tome was intended as a guidebook for the Puritan's journey to heaven. The most important part of that journey was meditation; hence the most important part of Baxter's book was "The Fourth Part. Containing a Directory for the getting and keeping of the Heart in Heaven: By the diligent practice of that Excellent unknown Deity of Heavenly Meditation. Being the main thing intended by the Author, in the writing of this Book; and to which all the rest is but subservient." In this section of one of the most popular and influential of Puritan books, Baxter repeated several themes in Thomas Taylor's Meditations from the Creatures and brought together most of the attitudes that made Puritan poetry pos sible: the positive approach to the sensible world, the recognition that though the senses were potentially dangerous they had their part in worship, the rationale for the use of sensuous imagery drawn from the creatures to describe the invisible things of God, and a complex but consistent statement of the uses and limits of language in meditation. Baxter began by insisting on the centrality of meditation to the holy life: "All that I have said is but for the preparation to this: The Doctrinal part is but to instruct you to this: the rest of the uses are but introductions to this." Primary among "Some Advantages and Helps for raising and Affecting the Soul by this Meditation" were the senses and their objects. Baxter's detailed discussion of them made explicit many of the complex but consistent attitudes implicit in Puritan poetry. Why sure it will be a point of our Spiritual Prudence, and a singular help to the fur thering of the work of Faith to call in our sense to our assistance: if we can make friends of these usual enemies, and make them instruments of raising us to God, which are the usual means of drawing us from God, I think we shall perform a very excellent work. Surely it is both possible and lawful, yea, and necessary too, to do something in this kind: for God would not have given us either our Senses them selves, or their usual objects, if they might not have been serviceable to his own Praise, and helps to raise us to the apprehension of higher things. Though they recognized the potential dangers of the senses, Puritans could use them in religious meditation and therefore in the literature that recorded that meditation. Like all things worldly, the senses</page><page sequence="21">156 Early American Literature, Volume XII, I977 trapped men who thought that there was nothing beyond them, but they, again like all things worldly, had a proper use. Indeed, even God used them when revealing himself to man through Scripture. And it is very considerable how the holy Ghost doth condescend in the phrase of Scripture, in bringing things down to the reach of sense; how he sets forth the excel lencies of Spiritual things in words that are borrowed from the objects of sense; how he describeth the glory of the New Jerusalem, in expressions that might take even with flesh itself: As that the Streets and Buildings are pure Gold, that the gates are Pearl . . . That we shall eat and drink with Christ at his Table in his Kingdom: that he will drink with us the fruit of the Vine new; that we shall shine as the Sun in the Firmament of our Father: These with most other descriptions of our Glory are ex pressed, as if it were to the very flesh and Sense; which though they are all improper and figurative, yet doubtless if such expressions had not been best, and to us neces sary, the Holy Ghost would not have so frequently used them. Baxter's tone here was insistent; he realized that he had to make his case, to assure his readers that he was not urging them to become mere ly men of sense. But, he did make the case, as the many examples of sen suous expression of spiritual truths testify. For Baxter, who wrote poetry, as for the American Willard, God had condescended to treat on man's level in His use of figurative lan guage, and that condescension compelled an appropriate response from man. "He that will speak to man's understanding; must speak in man's language, and speak that which he is capable to conceive. And doubtless as the Spirit doth speak, so we must hear; and if our neces sity cause him to condescend in his expressions, it must needs cause us to be low in our conceivings." Indeed the central and defining event in Christianity, the Incarnation of the invisible God in visible man was, like creation and all other metaphor, God's act of making part of Himself available to the understanding of man. "It is one reason of Christ's assuming and continuing our nature with the Godhead, that we might know him the better, when he is so much nearer to us: and we might have more positive conceivings of him, and so our minds might have familiarity with him, who before was quite beyond their reach." Baxter was, of course, aware of the dangers of idolatry (into which he asserted the Catholics had fallen) and of the limits of lan guage. He realized that an anthropomorphic view of God and heaven was a psychic necessity, not a metaphysical fact: But what is my scope in all this? is it that we might think Heaven to be made of Gold and Pearl? or that we should picture Christ, as the Papists do, in such a shape? or that we should think Saints and Angels do indeed eat and drink? No, not that we should take the Spirit's figurative expressions to be meant according to strict propri ety: or have fleshly conceivings of spiritual things, so as to believe them to be such</page><page sequence="22">Puritan Poetics I57 indeed: But this; to think that to conceive or speak of them in strict propriety, is utterly beyond our reach and capacity: and therefore we must conceive of them as we are able; and that the Spirit would not have represented them in these notions to us, but that we have no better notions to apprehend them by; and therefore that we can make use of these phrases of the Spirit to quicken our apprehensions and affec tions. Correspondences between the invisible things of God and the visible things of earth exist by fiat of God and can be expressed only through some form of figuration. Though these figures do not express God and heaven as such are known by God Himself and by those saints who are with Him in heaven, they do express as much of the beatific vision as man on earth can and needs to know. Limited and potentially danger ous, they are hardly to be scorned by mortal man. In Baxter's prose, then, we find the theological rationale for the figures that constitute so much of Puritan religious poetry. We find here the explicit statement of the attitude that enabled Puritan poets to delight in the sensible world, to state its vanities only in comparison with the joys of God and heaven, and to use the former to figure the latter. Even God had taken upon Himself the attributes of man, and though to afford a direct picture of Him would certainly have been idolatrous, as both Baxter and Willard had warned, nevertheless, man could understand and speak of and love God as anthropomor phically as God had "accommodated" His revelations to the tempo rary, earthly understandings of His creature. Having justified the uses of figuration to describe things spiritual, Baxter concluded: "The like may be said of those expressions of God in Scripture, wherein he rep resents himself in the imperfections of creatures, as anger, repenting, willing what shall not come to pass, &amp;C." They are "improper, drawn from the manner of man," but "we can see no better yet."34 Baxter made explicit the Puritan attitudes toward the sensible world, the religious use of images drawn from it, and the limits and necessity of figurative language based on that imagery. These atti tudes were far more pervasive and uniform than a doctrinaire pluralist would expect. Though the Puritans neither wrote an explicit ars poet ica nor, like Blake and Yeats, constructed their world-view in order to provide symbols for poetry, their world-view was positive, symbolic, and therefore far more conducive to the production of poetry than the world-view hitherto imputed to them. The poetics implicit in their prose writings avoided the worship, not the making, of images. Based on the belief that the world was the gift of a loving God, it comprised many paeans to the beauty and abundance of the natural world, a world perceived both as an a fortiori argument for the beauty and</page><page sequence="23">I58 Early American Literature, Volume XII, 1977 goodness of God and as a God-wrought system of symbols intended to lead man to heaven. Puritans believed that meaning resided in the symbolic world itself, and their poetics has far more in common with the Latin concept of the poet as vates ("seer"), one who sees and says the truth, than with the Greek concept of the poet as poeta ("maker"), one who creates verbal artifacts. We may use the critical tools provided by the New Critical view of the poem as verbal artifact in our reading of Puritan poetry, but it is clear that the making of such artifacts was not their intention when they wrote it: their avowed task was simply to say, to utter, the truth they saw. The sensible world, the senses, the words used to arouse and de scribe the meanings and affections appropriate to them, all were lim ited but necessary; all had their parts to play in salvation. Though not the ultimate object of man's love, they were created by God out of His love for man in order to give man a suitable object for his earthly love. Puritan poets, like' all Puritans, knew that if they were to pass to the next world they must turn their attention from the unmixed love of this one. Ultimately less real than God and heaven, this world had, none theless, both its delights and its uses.35 NOTES 1John Cotton, A Practical Commentary ... upon the First Epistle General of John (I656), quoted in Norman S. Grabo, "John Cotton's Aesthetics: A Sketch," Early American Literature, 3 (1968), 8. Herbert's poem appears on the last two pages of Richard Baxter, The Saints' Everlasting Rest, 9th ed.

John son has pointed out (Miller and Johnson, I, 77-78, and II, 668), the view held by Bulkley and Mather that poetry is trivial relaxation is not in evidence in the theory and practice of seventeenth-century American Puritans. Lawrence A. Sasek, The Literary Temper of the English Puritans (Baton Rouge, La. I96I), p. Iio, finds it expressed earlier in the laws and writings of the English Puritans and demonstrates that in England "the plays, ballads, and romances were looked upon by the puritans as a form of recreation, and placed under the same laws as games or athletic exer cises." Even in England, however, not all poetry was considered trivial, and "the pu ritans could accept the Homeric and Virgilian heroes, but not Robin Hood." Though American Puritans did not all march in step and wheel precisely at the turn of the century, it is in general true that in America poetry is considered important, often centrally important, in the religious life of seventeenth-century Puritans and comes to be considered an entertaining pastime only by eighteenth-century Americans.</page><page sequence="24">Puritan Poetics I59 2 For a survey of revisionist (usually pluralist) scholarship in Puritan intel lectual history, see Michael McGiffert, "American Puritan Studies in the I960'S," William and Mary Quarterly, 27 (1970), 36-67. 3 Allan I.

Pertinent passages from Pseudo-Hrabanus may be found in Spicilegium Solesmense, ed. Jean Baptiste Cardinal Pitra, 3 (i855; rpt. Graz, Austria, 1963), 436. This evidence first came to my attention in a lecture, "Medieval Symbolism and Imagery," given by James Marchand at Cornell University on 24 April 1972. 22 Quoted in Perry Miller, The New England Mind, p. 162. 23 Willard, Compleat Body of Divinity, pp. 37-45. 24 Samuel Mather, The Figures or Types of the Old Testament (1683), 2nd ed. (1705; rpt. New York, I969), p. 55. See also pp. 53, 129. The Puritans usually used the words emblem, type, sign, or similitude to refer to what most modern liter ary critics have defined as symbol. The Tashjians have noted that the interplay "be tween allegory and emblem was often so fluid as to render hard distinctions arbi trary," Memorials, p. i68. In The Puritan Origins of the American Self (New Ha ven, Conn., 1975), Sacvan Bercovitch has clearly detailed the changing nature of these distinctions in tracing the development of Puritan typology from an orthodox "hermeneutical mode connecting the Old Testament to the New," p. 35, to a more widely applied "typology of current affairs" that "we would now call symbolic in terpretation," p. 113. The word "symbol" in our modern sense was first used by Spenser and appeared quite rarely in seventeenth-century writings; its meaning was usually approximated by one of the words listed above, all of which appeared far more often (OED). 25 See Perry Miller's statement of the originality of Jonathan Edwards' world view in the introduction to his edition of Edwards' Images or Shadows of Divine</page><page sequence="26">Puritan Poetics I6I Things (New Haven, Conn., 1948), p. 7, and Ursula Brumm, American Thought and Religious Typology, trans.

(I954; New Haven, Conn., I962). Martz asserted that structured meditation became a concern of the Puritans only after i650, after Baxter had made palatable to them methods of med itation that were essentially Catholic. That Baxter was not nearly so original as he claimed to be has been demonstrated by Norman Grabo in "Puritan Devotion and American Literary History," p. 12. Grabo discussed the importation into England of Catholic handbooks on meditation in Edward Taylor (New Haven, Conn., I96I), p. 60. For a discussion of Puritan meditation after Baxter, see U. Milo Kaufmann, The Pilgrim's Progress and Traditions in Puritan Meditation (New Haven, Conn., i966). St. Francis de Sales is quoted in Louis L. Martz, The Poetry of Meditation, p. I5. 29 Thomas Taylor, A Man in Christ, or: A new CREATURE. To which is added a Treatise, containing Meditations from the CREATURES (London, I628), pp. 2, 5-8, 23, I04. 30 Thomas Hooker, The Soules Preparation for Christ. or A Treatise of Con trition (London, 1632), pp. 84-86. 31 Indeed, the Puritan dependence upon language and upon literary meta phors (e.g. the creatures are letters in a book written by God) was so great that they could not comprehend a religion based upon "visions and magic" rather than upon words. See Frank Shuffelton, "Indian Devils and Pilgrim Fathers: Squanto, Hobo mok, and the English Conception of Indian Religion," New England Quarterly, 49 (March 1976), 109-1I6. 32 Drawing the customary distinction between the legitimate act of seeing the symbols that God had put in one's way and the idolatrous act of making them, Cotton continued: "but he must not take upon him to determine them to be used as signs for such an end and purpose." Written early in his career, these statements were later published as Some Treasure Fetched out of Rubbish (London, i660), p. 29 and are quoted by Grabo, "Puritan Devotion," pp. 19-20. Cotton more than Hooker feared the possibility of idolatry lurking in the religious use of images, but even he acknowledged the value of meditation on the creatures and believed that if one kept clear the distinction between seeing signs and making them, one would be safe. 33 Martz, The Poetry of Meditation, p. 154, and Louis B. Wright, The Cul tural Life of the American Colonies 16o7-1763 (New York, 1957), p. 140. 34 Richard Baxter, The Saints' Everlasting Rest, 9th ed. (London, pp. 694, 749-51. Where before he had recognized the dangers of idolatry, Baxter now noted</page><page sequence="27">162 Early American Literature, Volume XII, 1977 the dangers of dealing only in religious abstractions: "Go to then; When thou set test thyself to meditate on the Joys above, think on them boldly as Scripture hath ex pressed them; Bring down thy conceivings to the reach of sense. . . . Both Love, and Joy are promoted by familiar acquaintance: When we go to think of God and Glory in proper conceivings without these spectacles, we are lost and have nothing to fix our thoughts upon" (p. 751). 35 Nowhere is this love clearer, and nowhere is the distance between the Pu ritan and the Gnostic or Manichaean or Catharist dualist greater than in their atti tudes toward the death of the body. The Catharists, for example, believed that the proper life of man on earth consisted of the endura, ritual suicide by starvation. But the Puritans did not despise the body, nor were they half in love with easeful death. Though neoplatonic in some respects, the Puritans saw the body as something more than the prison from which the soul should happily escape at its first opportunity. Samuel Willard wrote of death: "It makes a separation between the soul and body. This is the very nature of it, and is in itself a misery; and for that reason the Godly themselves have a natural reluctancy against it; they would not pass through it if they could go to heaven without it," Compleat Body, p. 233. David E. Stannard has presented considerable evidence "that the Puritans were gripped individually and collectively by an intense and unremitting fear of death."
