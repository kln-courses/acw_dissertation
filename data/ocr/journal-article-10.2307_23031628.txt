Carlos Gonzalez Faraco Abstract. - The initial failure to identify the Virgin Mary in an apparition, a widespread feature of Marian vision narratives in Europe, may well have psychodynamic implications of the sort advanced by Michael Carroll in his classic study, "The Cult of the Virgin Mary" (1986). However, in this article we argue that it also serves an important rhetorical role in Catholic knowledge struc tures that circulate both regionally and locally. Drawing princi pally upon our analysis of vision narratives from southern Spain, as well as other sources, we argue that the misidentification ele ment is a central component of a general schema of human-su pernatural interaction in the culture of European Catholicism.

By quite some margin Roman Catholicism is the most successful religion in human history, at least if one judges success in the mundane terms of its number of adherents, amount of resources con trolled, longevity, and - perhaps of greatest interest to anthropologists - its worldwide geographical dis tribution. The singular contribution that ethnogra phers have made to the study of Catholicism has been to work against the religion's stereotype as a slow-moving, monolithic enterprise that imposes orthodoxy at all costs and from the top down. An thropologists have excelled at demonstrating the so cial adaptability and cultural complexity that actu ally characterize the religion as it is practiced in the widest range of social arenas (Murphy 2008). Eth nographers and social historians have documented that in any given Catholic setting there are usually at least three interacting layers of religious culture in circulation. There are so-called universal con structions of Catholic culture that ultimately ema nate from the Vatican and the "official" church and which the clergy introduce and promote among the laity. There are also regional Catholic practices and devotions that characterize entire nations, such that we can without too much effort distinguish Irish Ca tholicism from its counterparts in Haiti or the United States. Just as easily one can usefully differentiate Andalusian from Basque Catholicism or an Iberian Catholicism from a Melanesian version of the re ligion since regional distributions of Catholic cul ture may be found within nation states or they may cut across political and social boundaries. Finally, there are local expressions of Catholic culture that distinguish the beliefs, practices, levels of partici pation and enthusiasm of one community (broadly conceived) from others within a regional tradition.1 1 Of course, the actual distribution of Catholic culture varies greatly from place to place with each setting requiring its own analysis.</page><page sequence="2">512 Anthropologists have also demonstrated how the historically shifting intersections and divergences of these distributions of Catholic culture are driven both by the periodic efforts of the clergy to bring the laity into line with changing ecclesiastical prefer ences and by the reciprocal resistance of lay people to this pressure to conform. Moreover, the different institutional entities of the church, its religious re gimes as Mart Bax (1985) puts it, selectively seek to promote or suppress the cultural models and de votional complexes of the different strata of Catholi cism in their efforts to outmaneuver one another and to influence the laity. Devotional practices and be liefs move back and forth across the landscape and in and out of favor with various Catholic lay and ecclesiastical constituencies. It is unfortunate that when anthropologists bring psychodynamic interpretations to bear on this reli gion they so rarely factor in this considerable social, cultural, and symbolic complexity. This is particu larly true in the case of the cult of the Virgin Mary, despite the fact that, for rather obvious reasons, it has long attracted psychodynamic analysis. Errors in these interpretations inevitably result when the complexities and nuances of Marianism suffer the parody of descriptive reductionism, in which pesky details of cultural distribution and organization are ignored or simply go unobserved. 1 his problem otten entails one ot two misadven tures. The first is misapplying broad ethnographic generalizations to local circumstances to which they do not apply. The second is invoking local, or even personal, conditions to explain widespread phenom ena. In his landmark work, "The Cult of the Vir gin Mary," Michael Carroll (1986) commits both of these ethnographic errors in his otherwise fas cinating psychological interpretations of Marian ism; this is particularly true when he turns his at tention to southern Spain (Murphy and Gonzalez Faraco 2007). In asking the interesting question - Why is Mari anism stronger in some parts of the Catholic world than in others? - he turns to the exemplary ethno graphic work of David Gilmore (1983; Gilmore and Gilmore 1979) and Stanley Brandes (1985) in Andalusia, a region so renowned for its devo tion to Mary that it proudly bears the title, "La tie rra de Maria Santisima" (The Land of Mary the Most Holy). Carroll makes particular use of Gil more's work on machismo, or hyper-masculinity, in the community of Fuenmayor to construct his own hypotheses about why Marianism is so intense in southern European societies, concluding that "the association of the Mary cult with southern Italy and Spain can ... be traced to the prevalence of the fa Michael D. Murphy and J. Carlos Gonzalez Faraco ther-ineffective family in these regions" (Carroll 1986: 61). Both exaggerated masculinity and in tense devotion to the Virgin Mary, argues Carroll, are produced by the weak presence of fathers in the lives of their young sons, which results in a strong but repressed desire for the mother that is effective ly expressed in and managed by Marian devotional ism. Without going into the details of Carroll's es sentially Kardinerian argument, let us simply point out that intense Marianism is simply not present in either of the two communities studied by his only ethnographic sources from southern Spain - Gil more and Brandes. For example, one will look in vain for a listing for the Virgin Mary in the indices of Gilmore's (1980, 1987) first two monographs on Fuenmayor and it is precisely data from that com munity that appears to have provided Carroll with his best evidence for his father-ineffective family hypothesis. Most of the working-class people of the town pointedly avoid the typical processional ritu als associated with the cult of the Virgin and they show no particular enthusiasm for her private devo tions. Indeed, the only popular working-class devo tion to be found there is one centered on the "Christ of Calvary" and it is pursued almost exclusively by women (Gilmore 1980: 150 If.). Thus, Carroll puts himself in the awkward position of summoning up the ethnography of this particular town to illustrate the general conditions that he alleges give rise to hyper-Marianism when that community itself is dis tinguished from its neighbors for its relative lack of interest in the cult of the Virgin.2 2 In Gilmore's "Carnival and Culture" (1998), he does men tion the importance of the cult of the Virgin Mary in An dalusia, but he does not describe it for Fuenmayor per se, because by all indications it is conspicuously undeveloped there. Although Brandes (1980: 181) describes the Virgin Mary as "important" for the townsmen of Monteros, it is clear that a brotherhood organized around devotion to Christ is of much greater significance for the townsmen. It is ironic that Brandes and Gilmore, impeccable ethnographers who also exhibit great insight into psychodynamic issues, elected to study communities in Andalusia that are unusually tepid in their embrace of the cult of the Virgin Mary. Carroll (1986) simply ignores this fact while Breuner (1992) takes this ser endipity to be an indication that perhaps Marianism is not a central focus of male religiosity in the region. Although Breuner quite correctly uses the lack of Marian enthusiasm in Carroll's only sources from southern Spain to question his central thesis, she commits the reciprocal error of unwarrant ed overgeneralization. The briefest perusal of the ethnograph ic literature in Spanish for Andalusia (for recent overviews of this work, see Cantero 2005; Rodriguez Becerra 2006 and 2007) should disabuse one immediately of the notion that Andalusian men are indifferent to the cult of the Virgin, but neither Carroll (1986) nor Breuner (1992) cite a single eth nographic source in Spanish. Anthropos 106.2011</page><page sequence="3">Identifying the Virgin Mary In what follows, we will shift attention from the least Marianist town in Andalusia that we know of - Gilmore's Fuenmayor - to Almonte, the com munity that is home to the largest, most emotion ally intense cultus in the region, if not in the entire world. Although Almontenos are alternately praised and condemned for it, no one doubts the extraor dinary fervor of their devotion to their patroness, La Virgen del Rocio, "The Virgin of the Dew." We will draw upon some details of Almonteno devo tionalism to engage another, more subtle, ethno graphic weakness that we find in Carroll's work: invoking local, even personal, conditions to explain more widespread phenomena. His psychodynamic interpretation of a feature of foundational Marian apparitions - the initial failure of seers to identify the Virgin Mary in their visions - will be placed in a wider ethnographic context in order to argue that this recurring element of Marian vision narra tives serves an important rhetorical role in addition to any psychological significance that it may bear. After considering Carroll's views on this phenom enon in 19th-century France, we will discuss some important features of popular Catholicism in An dalusia before describing Roci'o's cultus. With that background to both regional and local expressions of Marianism as context, we will relate and inter pret three of the many miracles attributed to Ro cio by Almontenos and others. Along the way we shall demonstrate how the delayed identification el ement figures in various cultural models (of both local and regional distribution) of human contact with the sacred. Our argument is simple, what Car roll regards as a recurring personal detail that re veals much about the psychodynamics of seers is simultaneously an important element of a general Catholic schema of human contact with the super natural. Moreover it is an element that is deployed specifically to allay the culturally constructed skep ticism that attends apparitions of sacred personali ties in Roman Catholicism. Identifying Mary In "The Cult of the Virgin Mary" Michael Carroll (1986: 148-172) argues that the young French vi sionaries associated with the famous apparitions at Paris (1830), La Salette (1846), and Lourdes (1858) did not initially understand the female figures in their visions to be the Virgin Mary (see also Car roll 1985). Rather, he proposes, others suggested her identity to them and only subsequently did they come to believe that they had failed, at first, to rec ognize the Virgin. Carroll uses this thematic conver Anthropos 106.2011 513 gence in these cases to support his contention that the apparitions appearing to these seers were projec tions of ambivalent, sometimes multiple, maternal figures from their personal psychohistories and that only later did other people encourage them to frame their experiences in a culturally appropriate and so cially salient manner. They saw "Mother," Carroll suggests, and others convinced them that she was really the "Virgin Mary." Because of their strictly personal relevance to the seers, those elements of this initial confusion that proved puzzling or prob lematic to other devotees were either overlooked or consciously edited out of succeeding devotional ac counts of these famous 19th century miracles (e.g., Carroll 1986: 153, 155 f., 157, 168).3 Carroll's resourceful method of analysis in cludes scrutinizing just those details of the original accounts that eventually suffered deletion or modi fication in order to uncover clues for his psychody namic interpretations of these important events in European Catholicism. For example, Carroll (1986: 149-156) argues that while Maximin, the principal seer of the apparitions at La Salette, asserted that he did not know if the lady he had seen in his vi sion was the Virgin Mary or not, others came to the conclusion that she was the Mother of God and in terpreted her extraordinarily apocalyptic utterances accordingly. Yet, they did not accept Maximin's claim that the lady told him that her son had beaten her. Not only did most early commentators dismiss this as an error on Maximin's part, but modern ac counts have tended to delete any mention of it alto gether. Carroll (1986: 153) seizes on this anomaly to argue that, "... what Maximin first saw and heard was a mother who complained of being beaten by her son." Only later, after the vision had been dis cussed with others, did it come to be defined as an apparition of the Virgin Mary. After examining the facts known about Maxi min's childhood, Carroll (1986: 154) concludes that the boy suffered grievously from physical abuse at the hands of his stepmother and that his hallucina tion was actually the fulfillment of an unconscious wish to strike back at her. Carroll (1986: 154f.) ar gues further that his psychodynamic interpretation helps to make sense out of some features peculiar to the visions at La S alette, particularly the unusu ally harsh tone of the Virgin's message and the fact that she is depicted as weeping. Offering similar 3 Carroll also discovered the same pattern - an initial failure by principal seers to identify apparitions as the Virgin Mary fol lowed by accounts that delete discrepancies - in the visions at Fatima (1986: 177) and Pontemain (1986: 196, 200). See also Carroll (1983, 1985).</page><page sequence="4">514 interpretations of the details of the apparitions at Lourdes and Paris, in each case Carroll finds the female figure in the hallucination to be an uncon scious projection of a problematic maternal figure from the principal seer's life whose identity as the Virgin Mary was not immediately apprehended but rather suggested to the visionary by others. His detailed analyses of Marian visions provide us with instructive examples of how the emotion ally charged and highly personal experiences of in dividuals are both promoted by the specific social circumstances shaping their lives and incorporated into an ongoing religious system. This latter process has been characterized by Obeyesekere (1981: 50) as the "conventionalization of personal symbols," by Zimdars-Swartz (1991: 19) as "the movement from private experience to public meaning," and by Slater (1990b: 109f.) as the "exteriorization of pri vate experience." At least one result of the sociocul tural tailoring of these young seers' psychological projections (i.e., the apparently retroactive coding of "Mother" as "Virgin Mary") has been the cre ation of highly cathected foci of religious venera tion upon which millions of Catholics have orga nized and elaborated their emotions as well as their theologies. The contemporary power of the Marian vision pilgrimage complex is revealed in the comprehen sive survey of Christian pilgrimage in Western Eu rope conducted by the Nolans (1989). Their work indicates that the thousands of shrines located in Western Europe annually attract at least 100 mil lion visits by pilgrims and religious tourists (No lan and Nolan 1989: If.). Fully 65% of the 6,150 shrines in their sample are dedicated to one of the Virgin Mary's many different advocations (Nolan and Nolan 1989: 9). Often these Marian shrines have emerged in the context of miraculous events, including apparitions of the sort studied by Carroll. In the profound religious experiences of a select few, many millions continue to find rich symbolic material to invest their feelings into and articulate their religious thinking around. William Christian (1984: 240), a painstaking and insightful investigator of Spanish apparitions, has astutely observed that a large, but inherently inde terminate, number of people have visions, but only very few of these dramatic supernatural encounters ever succeed in becoming matters of sustained pub lic interest. An important task for students of these and related phenomena, therefore, is the specifi cation of those sociocultural processes that cause some visions to inspire the multitudes while the vast majority do not. The success of any particular epiphany in initiating or sustaining a widespread re Michael D. Murphy and J. Carlos Gonzalez Faraco ligious devotion depends upon much more than how well the private emotions of the seers resonate with the collective psychological concerns of their soci ety. If visions are to be accepted by a wider social audience, thereby becoming useful screens for the projection of vivid sentiments, they must meet some minimal, and culture-specific, standards of credibil ity. Writing about a very different sort of religious tradition (Taiwanese sectarian societies), David K. Jordan (1990: 99) pinpoints the psychological basis of this requirement, At least some religious customs ... require a more or less constant system of legitimation by which the believer can justify his belief to the nonbeliever ... and by which he can specifically neutralize the nonbeliever's objections and reduce dissonance for himself. In other words, visions must pass cognitive muster, both to self and to others, if they are to establish or sustain a cultus. Of course, emotional resonance and intellectual suitability may be necessary but they are not suf ficient conditions for the phenomenal success of some visions.4 Christian's groundbreaking work in Spain (1972, 1976, 1981a, 1981b, 1987, 1989, 1996) has greatly illuminated the often complicated mix of ecological, political, economic, and cultural forces that must converge to lift some few appari tions out of social obscurity. Not the least of those factors that shape the initial emergence and even tual success or failure of an apparitional cultus is the complex play of lay and ecclesiastical interests, as Mart Bax (1990) has thoroughly documented for the contemporary case of Medjugorje in Bosnia (see also Skrbis 2005). In her broad-brushed histor ical sketch of the shifting politics of apparitions in Spain, Roma Riu (1989: 517 f.) demonstrates that the apparitional scenarios that lay seers and church officials entertain have converged and diverged over the centuries as each develops and refines its own "strategies of legitimization" of human interaction with the divine. The focus of much of what follows will be on demonstrating the importance of fram ing an account of the miraculous in such a manner that its authenticity be established among people - both lay and clerical - who not only believe in the reality of miracles, but also in the necessity of dis tinguishing them from unfounded claims of super natural encounters. The ecclesiastical authorities of the church, of course, are notorious for their posture of institution alized skepticism about claims of human encounters 4 Carroll himself is fully aware of this point (1986: 145 f.). Anthropos 106.2011</page><page sequence="5">Identifying the Virgin Mary with the supernatural, but European miracle narra tives describe events that even by local, lay defini tion are inherently unusual, even implausible. We have yet to speak with a Spanish believer in con temporary supernatural intervention, for example, who did not also admit, sometimes even insist, that some purported miracles, including apparitions, are in fact either fraudulent or the result of psychologi cal delusion. Thus, it is reasonable to expect that some effort will be made in the presentation of an apparition narrative to dislodge its intended audi ence from a position of tentative skepticism, a skep ticism that is every bit as culturally informed as is the conviction that sometimes miracles really do oc cur. The claim that at first a seer either cannot identi fy or misidentifies the supernatural subject of his or her vision, we submit, serves to disarm this antici pated wariness and thus contributes to authenticat ing the miraculous events which initiate or promote a cultus and its pilgrimage. We also believe that this device simultaneously serves to reassure the seer of the authenticity of his or her own experience. In many European miracle stories the seer is de picted as being young, humble, innocent and with out guile, as being initially unaware of the super natural significance of what has occurred to him or her.5 Moreover, in these stories the seer is invariably portrayed as someone who is not actively seeking an encounter with the sacred much less with a par ticular supernatural entity. Often doubt, or the inno cence begot of simple ignorance, precedes recogni tion of a sacred engagement (e.g.. Turner and Turner 1978: 41). Reflecting on the ingenuous traits charac teristic of many Marian seers, Marina Warner (1976: 311) comes to exactly the opposite conclusion that we wish to advance here when she writes that: The confidence that Catholics place in the visions of chil dren like Bernadette and the others who were mostly il literate and often neurasthenic brutally reveals the des perate thirst believers have for assurances that the faith is still credit-worthy. For Warner these seers are so utterly bereft of cred ibility that to pay them the slightest heed betrays a stunning gullibility. Yet, the apparent social, and even cognitive, incompetence of seers does not nec essarily require the suspension of critical faculties; on the contrary, this quality may allay the very sus picions that the exercise of skepticism arouses. In our view, the initial failure of the protagonist of the miracle story to recognize the identity of a super 5 E.g., Turner and Turner (1978); Christian (1981a); Nolan and Nolan (1989). Anthropos 106.2011 515 natural personage - especially when combined, as it so often is, with the seer's youth, naivete, and hum ble social position - works to soften the skepticism of those who might otherwise suspect chicanery or psychological dysfunction. home alleged encounters with the supernatural contain persuasive elements that simply make them more believable, in vernacular and/or ecclesiastical tprmc ArrniintQ nf thp.sp p.vp.nts will thrivp — that is, enjoy wider and more long-lasting distribution - while other less compelling tales will not. In oth er words, socially successful accounts correspond to widely shared cultural models of apparitions. By tidying up elements of the original miracle stories of primary seers the representatives of the official church make apparitional narratives more closely conform to cultural models that they (and lay so phisticates) find convincing. That the initial failure to identify the Virgin was not deleted in subsequent accounts of the French miracles suggests that the of ficial "editors" of these stories understood, whether consciously or not we do not know, that this was a crucial rhetorical element in popularly entertained apparitional models that did not conflict with ec clesiastical construals of human encounters with the supernatural. Our tactic, then, will be to reverse Carroll's method. Instead of examining those appar ently idiosyncratic details that suffer deletion from later accounts, we will center analysis on a narra tive element that is not only retained, but that en joys a recurrent role in other genres of miracle sto ries. We hope to convince the reader that elements of widely distributed knowledge structures were at work in shaping these hallucinations, and the sto ries told about them, even before the mysterious figure in the apparitions was identified as the Vir gin Mary. Marianism and Miracles in Andalusia Isidoro Moreno, a prolific scholar of vernacular re ligion in southern Spain, has argued that the key to Andalusian religiosity is its fundamentally "anthro pocentric" nature (1982: 230f.; 1985b: 46f.). Of course, the quality of anthropocentrism hardly dis tinguishes Andalusian religiosity from that of many other societies; Guthrie (1980), for example, is not alone in making that quality part of the very defi nition of religion itself (see also Barrett and Kiel 1996). A particularly important feature of Anda lusian Catholicism, however, is that the many dif ferent iconic representations of the Virgin, Christ and the saints are treated as if they were separate and distinct personalities from whom divine assis</page><page sequence="6">516 tance can be sought in times of need.6 It is widely believed, for example, that some statues have spe cialties rather like medical doctors and that there is wisdom when seeking supernatural intervention in matching one's calamity to the appropriate advoca tion of Christ or the Virgin Mary. Further evidence of the individuation and personification of sacred statues is found in the Andalusian custom of engag ing in emotional arguments about which of two stat ues of the Virgin is prettier or which of two repre sentations of Christ is most productive of miracles (Mitchell 1990: 122; Velasco Mafllo 2000). A second characteristic feature of Andalusian Catholicism, of course, is its unabashed emphasis on the Virgin Mary (see Cantero 2005; Rodriguez Becerra 2007). Although it is very unsettling for many priests and bishops, there is no doubt that most Andalusian Catholics are far more interested in the Virgin Mary than they are in Jesus Christ, God the Father, or the Holy Spirit. It is also evi dent that the relationship between the Virgin Mary and her devotees is paradigmatically associated with the relationship between mother and child.7 Just as the Spanish child seeks maternal intercession on his or her behalf when some paternal concession is required, so Spanish Marianists favor working through their heavenly mother when divine inter vention is desired (Christian 1972: 100). The preferred manner of inviting the mediation of the Virgin Mary is through the promesa, or vow, made to one of her many specific advocations (Ro driguez Becerra 1982, 1989a, 2006). In a moment of deeply felt need, intervention may be formally requested by making a contract taking the form of a promise to perform some spiritual exercise and/ or provide the Virgin with a votive offering if the requested outcome is forthcoming (Rodriguez Be cerra 1982). These offerings, or exvotos, may take many forms, including metal or wax representations of body parts, locks of hair, photographs, wedding dresses, and military uniforms. As Rodriguez Bece rra (1989a: 123) so nicely puts it, an ex-voto is "the fulfillment of a promise materialized in an object." If a devotee receives an unasked-for benefit, he or she may attribute it after the fact to a particular Vir gin, Christ, or saint, thus inspiring an action de gra cias, or act of thanksgiving. A traditionally favored manner of expressing gratitude for a favor, whether it be bargained for in advance or not, is to render or commission a votive painting depicting the crisis 6 Moreno Navarro (1985a: 173); Cantero (2005); Rodriguez Becerra (2006, 2007). 7 Parsons (1969); Brandes (1981); Saunders (1981); Gilraore and Uhl (1987); Corbin and Corbin (1987: 69). Michael D. Murphy and J. Carlos Gonzalez Faraco precipitating a supernatural intervention and, per haps, its resolution (Rodriguez Becerra y Vazquez Soto 1980; Rodriguez Becerra 2005).8 For centuries these votive paintings have operated as wonderfully explicit visual texts for the instruction of potential visionaries, despite the fact that most do not actu ally represent visions in the strict sense. For exam ple, an ex-voto representing the cure of an illness might picture a person in bed, surrounded by con cerned loved ones, with the Virgin shown hovering above. Although the folk artist does not intend that the scene be taken literally, only desiring to indi cate within the limitations of the medium that it is Mary who is responsible for the happy outcome, the scene does resemble an apparition. Ex-votos clearly serve as externalized, imagistic cultural models for would-be seers. The Cult of the Virgin of the Dew Since the early 14th century the statue of "La Vir gen del Rocfo," has been housed in a sanctuary lo cated in a remote part of the municipality of Almon te bordering on the vast marshlands of Andalusia's Guadalquivir River.9 The legends that recount the miraculous circumstances under which Rocfo's cul tus began conform to a pattern of narratives labeled "The Shepherds' Cycle" (El ciclo de los pastores) by Vicente de la Fuente in 1879.10 Although there are actually two competing versions of how Rocfo came to be discovered, one favored by Almontenos and another promoted for complicated reasons by other Rocfo devotees (Murphy 1989), both agree that the statue was uncovered by a man in the wild marshes of the town of Almonte and that this dis covery, or invention, initiated her cultus. The first known written account of the discovery, and the one that is cited by most contemporary Almonte nos, stipulates that at the beginning of the 15th cen tury a man, either hunting or tending flocks in an area of Almonte's marshlands known as "Las Roci 8 Since the Vatican II reforms many shrines no longer display them or other ex-votos in the "hall of miracles" (cuarto de los milagros) that used to be a ubiquitous feature of Andalu sian sanctuaries (Rodriguez Becerra 1995). Nonetheless, the "spiritualization of materiality" (Eipper 2007) continues to be a hallmark of Andalusian religiosity. 9 See Infante-Galan (1971); Gonzalez Gomez y Carrasco Te rriza (1981); Comelles (1996, 1998; Diaz de la Serna Ca rrion et al.

Inves tigating the source of their excitement, he discov ered a life-sized statue of the Virgin Mary placed upon the trunk of a tree. He put the statue on his shoulders and set out for the town of Almonte lo cated some 15 km distant. Along the way, how ever, he felt fatigued and stopped to sleep. When he awoke he found that the statue was gone. Dis traught, he returned to the place of his discovery and there he found the statue exactly as when he first saw it. Leaving the statue in the setting that it obviously preferred, he hurried to Almonte where he told of what had occurred. Almonte's clergy and civil authorities returned with him to the marshes where they found the statue in the place and in the manner he had described. Filled with devotion and respect, they took the statue out of the thicket and carried her to the parish church of Almonte to wait until they could construct a temple for her in Las Rocinas. They built an altar for Roci'o so that the trunk of the very tree on which she was found could serve as her pedestal. The Almonteno discovery story just summarized contains most of the eleven narrative elements that Honorio Velasco Mafllo (1989; see also 2000) has identified as typical of the hundreds of examples of the Shepherd's Cycle narrative to be found through out Spain (see Table 1). Two of these elements, one of which is instantiated in the Almonteno version and the other which is not, are of particular inter est to the present topic. In the Almonteno account, like so many others, the discoverer of the sacred ob ject does not initiate or even seek an encounter with the sacred. He (and 80% of the time it is a "he") is engaged in his ordinary pursuits in the countryside when the sacred suddenly reveals itself to him. A second, related element in many of these accounts is that very often the discoverer initially fails even to recognize that he has found a representation of the Virgin Mary. Typically, the statue is identified first as either a "sefiora (lady)," or a "mujer (woman)," or an "imagen femenina (feminine image)," and then, only later, as the "Virgen" (the Virgin Mary). In the official version of Rocfo's invention, there is no hint of this initial misidentification element. Instead, in the florid style of the 18th century it stipulates that, ... he discovered the image of that sacred Iris [who is] free from the thorns of sin; he saw among the brambles the simulation of that Mystical Bramble [who is locat ed] in the middle of the ardor of original sin [but is free from it]; he saw a statue of the Queen of the angels, of natural height, placed upon the trunk of a tree (Quoted in Diaz de la Serna C. et al. 1987: 45).

Honorio Velasco Mai'llo's Shepherd's Cycle Schema (1) The story is one of the discovery of a sacred ob ject (usually a statue of the Virgin Mary) in a par ticular place, often at some distance from human settlement, by an individual who takes notice of it to a nearby community. (2) The discoverer is usually a low-status youth, often a shepherd. (3) The discoverer does not purposefully seek an encounter with the supernatural: it is thrust upon him or her. (4) The place, if not the time, of the discovery is rig orously defined. (5) The discovery is anticipated by mysterious physi cal signs, often bright lights or sounds. (6) At the moment of the statue's discovery the mys terious is converted into the supernatural.

(8) The discoverer initiates the appropriation of the statue by attempting to take it to a community. (9) The statue mysteriously resists being taken from its spot to the community, often three times. (10) The discoverer begins the process of the social ex tension of belief by bringing news of the events he has experienced to a nearby community. (11) The new cultus is institutionalized by the con struction of a sanctuary for the statue usually at the place of its discovery. Yet, in the alternative (and increasingly popular) version of Rocfo's discovery, one well known to Al montenos even though they might not accept it as authentic, the discoverer at first takes the statue to be something more mundane than a religious icon: Frightened, he saw the image of a small sculpture that at first he believed to be a doll because its size was no great er than a vara [note: 85 cm or 2.8 ft] in length (Editorial Andaluci'a 1981: 66). Almontenos are fully aware that in the alternative version of the discovery of Rocfo the man who en counters her at first believes her to be a child's toy, not a representation of the Virgin Mary.</page><page sequence="8">518 The Rocfo discovery story fits a script that is well known not only in Iberia but also throughout the rest of Europe, especially in France. In their analy sis of the foundation narratives of 3,126 pilgrimage shrines in Western Europe, the Nolans (1989) iden tify stories of the "found object" type as accounting for fully 18% of the total sample, including 36% of the Iberian cases and 21% of the French shrines. We mention these details not only to suggest that the misidentification element in one version of Rocfo's discovery is well known in Almonte, but to point out that the French seers discussed by Carroll very likely were exposed to them, as well. Although of ten depicted as poor students or illiterate, most of the young French seers of the 19th century dem onstrated a good grasp of the popular devotions of their time (see Carroll 1986: 160-164), and this un doubtedly included stories of the "Shepherd's Cy cle" variety. Finally, the Nolans (1989: 259) note that "a considerable number of the 563 found ob ject stories have a similar structure." That is, the el ements of these tales, while admitting of different instantiations, seem to have traveled relatively intact throughout Europe. It is quite relevant to the thesis of this article that the founding of the cultus of Rocfo and the mytho logical charter for her pilgrimage is not based on an apparition (aparicion) or vision of the Virgin herself, but rather on the miraculous discovery (in vencidri) of a statue that represents her. Invencio nes have been rather more common in Spain than elsewhere, in part at least, because of the wisdom during the era of the infamous Spanish Inquisition to have some concrete evidence that a miraculous event had actually occurred (Christian 1981b: 90— 93; Carroll 1986: 133). With but a single excep tion, the regional sanctuaries established in Spain between 1520 and 1900 were not based on appari tions (Christian 1989: 109). The keen, if not exactly kindly, interest that inquisitors paid to people who claimed to have had visionary experiences must have had a chilling effect on anyone who consid ered telling others of his or her extraordinary expe riences. Certainly, there were more than a few cas es of visionaries, including priests and nuns, who suffered severe penalties for refusing to keep quiet about their encounters with the sacred. Having a vi sion was not sanctionable in and of itself, but pro moting it once it had been officially determined to be of dubious authenticity was. The inordinate number of invenciones that figure in the foundation stories of medieval Marian devotions in Spain, and their close correspondence to an explicit cultural model, is additional evidence that establishing credibility is as important a factor in the successful diffusion Michael D. Murphy and J. Carlos Gonzalez Faraco of accounts of miraculous events as are consider ations of psychodynamic appropriateness or affec tive appeal. We believe that it is a mistake to conclude from this, as Carroll (1986: 132-134) seems to do, that Spaniards have been less likely to experience appa ritions simply because most miracles that serve to establish devotions are not apparitional in nature. As we will describe at greater length below, although an apparition did not initiate the Rocfo cultus, a large number of apparitions have been reported by her devotees. It is not clear exactly when the first Rocfo broth erhood was established in Almonte after her alleged discovery, although officials of the "Hermandad Matriz," or Principal Brotherhood, place its foun dation during the mid-sixteenth century (Reales Espina 2001). Afterwards, affiliated brotherhoods (,hermandades filiates) began to appear in towns bordering on the marshes and by the end of the 19th century, ten had been established in the prov inces of Sevilla, Huelva, and Cadiz. The main func tion of each brotherhood is to administer its com munity's participation in the spring pilgrimage to Rocfo's sanctuary, which by the turn of the 20th century was attracting about 5,000 pilgrims annu ally (Nogales 1900). During this century, Rocfo's cultus and her pilgrimage have experienced prodi gious growth.11 By the turn of the 21st century, up to a million people attended her spring rituals, with many tens of thousands in the company of 107 af filiated brotherhoods from all eight provinces of Andalusia and beyond (Murphy y Gonzalez 2002b; Cantero 2005). Although she began her devotion al career as the patroness of a single community, Rocfo has emerged as the key symbol of region al identity in southern Spain.12 The annual spring pilgrimage to Rocfo attracts enormous national as well as regional media coverage and the Almonte nos have become renowned for the vigor with which they defend their community's primacy in her cul tus. Almonteno social life is infused with Rocfo de votionalism and cannot easily be understood apart from it. The aggressive commitment to their advo cation of the Virgin is frequently characterized by critics as violent, fanatical, barbaric, and even pa gan (e.g., Umbral 1988; Diaz Perez 2001), but such criticisms evoke equally passionate defenses (e.g., Burgos 1985). 11 Murphy (1992, 1993); Murphy y Gonzalez Faraco (2002, 2006a). 12 Rodriguez Becerra (1989b); Moreno Navarro (1995); Osten feld-Rosenthal (1997); Murphy y Gonzalez (2002, 2006b); Cantero (2005). Anthropos 106.2011</page><page sequence="9">Identifying the Virgin Mary Given her enormous popularity it is not surpris ing that many miracles have been attributed to Ro cio13 and this is attested to by the large number of ex-votos that have been wrought in her honor and that are preserved by the "Hermandad Matriz" and by private collectors (Rodriguez Becerra y Vazquez Soto 1980). While the town or Almonte contains its fair share of skeptics, many Almontenos volunteered tales of Rocfo's direct intercession in their lives. Most of these narratives, however, do not depict spectacular events. Many people tell stories closely following the cultural model of the promesa, or vow, briefly described above. For example, faced with the seri ous illness of a close relative, one Almonteno prom ised to walk the 15 km to Rocfo's sanctuary in si lence if the sick person be spared. When the patient eventually recovered, the vow was fulfilled and the cure attributed to Rocfo. Other stories of Rocfo's miraculous interest in the people of Almonte in volve the spontaneous invocation of her name in a moment of crisis. For example, one man told us that while driving at a fairly high rate of speed, one of his tires blew out and he lost control of his car. Al most instinctively, he blurted out Rocfo's name just before he regained control of his vehicle and averted an accident. He credits his escape from serious in jury or death to Rocfo's intervention. Yet, not all of the miracle stories related to us in Almonte concern matters of life and death. We were told of many cases of Rocfo's efficacy in mat ters large and small: she has helped the infatuated melt hard hearts, barren women conceive children, students pass exams, the unemployed find jobs, the absent-minded locate lost valuables. Almontenos also believe that Kocio provides mi raculous protection and benefits to the entire com munity, particularly in times of great need. For ex ample, La Venida de la Virgen, or "The Coming of the Virgin," is a major Rocfo ritual that is related to her miraculous intervention in the collective lives of the townsmen. Since at least the 16th century when ever the Almontenos have felt particularly threat ened - by pestilence, hunger, drought, or political turmoil - they have gone en masse to Rocfo's re mote shrine and ceremoniously carried the statue on their shoulders back to the town.14 The statue is then installed in front of the altar of Almonte's par ish church where she offers a comforting presence during a time of general stress. When the crisis has 13 E.g., Cruz de Fuentes (1908); Jurado Carrillo (1919); Alvarez Gaston (1981). 14 Alvarez Gaston (1977); Lopez Pelaez (1998); Flores Cala (2005); Murphy y Gonzalez Faraco (2007). Anthropos 106.2011 519 Fig. 1 : La Virgen del Rocfo dressed as a shepherdess (left) and as a queen (right). passed, Rocfo is duly credited and the townsmen organize a triumphant procession to return her to the sanctuary of the marshes. Since the middle of this century, however, the venida has been regularly scheduled so that it occurs at least once every seven years, "Whether we need her help or not," as one Almonteno asserted.15 Two Manifestations of Rorio Whenever the venida takes place, the statue under goes an impressive transformation. Her clothes and adornments are changed for the magnificent, but grueling, 15 km procession from the sanctuary to the town. The change produced in her appearance is so marked that the uninitiated might easily con fuse the dual manifestations of Rocfo for two entire ly different statues of the Virgin Mary (see Fig. 1). The result of this periodic change of clothing is a relatively rare form of secondary splintering in An dalusian Marian iconography (Murphy y Gonzalez Faraco 2007). 15 One explanation for the innovation of actually scheduling the venida is that Almontenos, perhaps for the first time in their history, have enough control over their lives to make com munal supernatural intercession a rare necessity. Therefore, if they want to see Rocfo in their town, they must plan for her to come even in the absence of crisis. Another possibility is that by arranging for Rocfo to pay regular visits to the town, Almontenos underscore the unique nature of their relation ship to the sacred statue in the face of the explosion of inter est in her in the region.</page><page sequence="10">520 Michael D. Murphy and J. Carlos Gonzalez Faraco Sometime near the turn of the 17th century, Al montenos, following the fashion of the times, began to clothe their statue in the elegant fancy dress of the great ladies of Spain (Infante Galan 1971: 54; Gon zalez Gomez y Carrasco Terriza 2002). Framing the richly embroidered outer skirt and flowing cloak of the Virgin are ornaments reminiscent of the "Lady Clothed in the Sun" described in the New Testa ment's "Book of Revelations": a beautiful crown topped by twelve stars, stylized sunbursts (rafagas) arrayed along both of her sides, a crescent moon at her feet (Carrasco Terriza 2009). When wearing this costume adorned with celestial lights Rocfo is said to be "dressed as a queen" (vestida de reina), a ref erence to a number of her principal titles: "Queen of the Heavens," "Queen of the Marshes," "Queen of Andalucia." This is the appearance Rocfo pres ents when in her sanctuary, which is all the time save for her processions to and from Almonte ev ery seven years. When Rocio travels between her basilica and the town, she is "dressed as a shepherdess" (vestida de pastora). The crown, sunbursts, and crescent moon are removed and Rocio is outfitted in the traveling attire of the highborn Spanish ladies of the 19th cen tury (Murphy y Gonzalez Faraco 2007: 346-351): a full length dress, a short shoulder cape, a wig of hair done in long curls topped by a wide-brimmed summer hat decorated with wild flowers and the fruits of the harvest.16 While the effect produced hardly conjures up the image of a humble shepherd ess, that title being less descriptive than theological ly evocative, when compared with her regal attire, this costume certainly serves to humanize Rocio. It is in that sense that the Virgin of the Dew can be said to shift periodically between two significantly dif ferent degrees of anthropomorphism. The fact that Rocio appears in two radically different forms - and that one representation more closely resembles an ordinary, human mother - figures prominently in the miracle stories we will now finally relate. Three Modern Miracles Attributed to Rorio All three of the Almontenos who told us these sto ries are believers not only in Catholicism but also in the contemporary existence of miracles. This is a particularly important factor in the case of Ro cio because of the extremely polarized views, corre sponding roughly (but only roughly) to the politics of the left and right, concerning the meaning and For a more complete description see Infante-Galan (1971: 69 f.). significance of the Rocfo cultus in Andalusia (Mur phy 1992, 1994; Murphy y Gonzalez Faraco 2005). Those who prefer to see only superstition, folklore, or mystification in Rocio's pilgrimage are likely to use the recounting of miracle tales to ridicule her cultus17; their rhetoric, equally worthy of anthro pological investigation, is of quite a different order and will not be considered here.18 It is worth noting, however, that all three narrators emphatically deny any desire to persuade confirmed atheists or high minded iconophobes. These three accounts were collected in the mid 1980s. In subsequent conversations, other Almonte nos reported versions of two of these stories (No. 2 and No. 3). Each narrator was asked to relate any miracles that he or she knew of that could be attrib uted to Rocfo and no one told fewer than four sto ries. Significantly, in each case the first story told is the one we report here. Miracle Account No. 1 "Jose," a 47-year-old shopkeeper responded to our query about Rocfo miracles by affirming that he had become a devout follower of "La Virgen del Rocfo" because she cured a serious childhood illness that he suffered: My devotion for the Virgin of the Dew began in my child hood, when She saved my life. I am not an Almonteno by birth. I was born in another place, but when I was young, my family moved to Almonte, where I have lived ever since. Just a few years before our move to Almonte ... I was only nine years old ... I contracted a very severe ill ness, I had a fever so high that the doctor told my mother that he feared for my life. In one of the moments in which the fever rose a great deal, so high that I became deliri ous, I had a vision. In this vision, a very beautiful woman came to me and uncovered me, moving away the blanket that covered me ... and she touched me on the forehead with her finger. I immediately fell into a deep sleep. When I awoke the fever had completely disappeared. I was 17 E.g., Grosso (1981); Gonzalez (1981); Umbral (1986, 1988); Diaz Perez (2001). 18 A number of scholars have fruitfully discussed the role of politics in the local and worldwide debates about the meaning of visions in the cult of Mary (see especially Bax 1990; Perry and Echeverrfa 1988; Christian 1984, 1987). While not con cerned with Marianism, Candace Slater's extraordinary stud ies of saints' tales in Brazil (1986,1990b) and Spain (1990a) provide us with exemplars for the investigation of this and many other issues. Slater (1990a; 181) presents a brilliant case for her point that even archaic narrative forms, like the miracle story, can "foster spirited debate" about contempo rary social and political issues. Anthropos 106.2011</page><page sequence="11">Identifying the Virgin Mary cured. Since my family had not yet moved to Almonte, I did not recognize that this woman was the Virgin of the Dew, inasmuch as I had seen photographs or postcards of her only dressed in her queen's garb. Some years after this illness, when we had come to Almonte, and someone for the first time showed me a photograph of the Virgin dressed as a shepherdess, I immediately realized that this was the woman of my vision. Do you understand, now? I did not know what had occurred to me until much later after it had happened. Do you think that a child could in vent such a story as this? I am convinced that the Virgin makes miracles to he who asks for help when he needs it. And I don't care if others believe differently or not. Mi devotion por la Virgen del Rocfo viene de mi ninez, cuando Ella me salvo la vida. Yo no soy almonteno de nacimiento. Nacf en otro sitio, pero cuando contaba con pocos anos, mi familia se instalo en Almonte, donde vivo desde entonces. Precisamente poco antes de ese traslado (tenia yo solamente nueve anos), contraje una enferme dad muy grave, con fiebres tan altas que el medico le dijo a mi madre que temfa por mi vida. En uno de los momen tos en los que la fiebre subfo mucho, hasta el extremo de hacerme delirar, tuve una vision. En ella, una mujer muy bella se me acerco y me destapo, levantando la manta que me cubrfa, y a continuation me toco la frente con su dedo. Entre de inmediato en un profundo sueno. A1 des pertarme, la fiebre habfa desaparecido por completo. Es taba curado. Como mi familia aun no se habfa trasladado a Almonte, yo no podfa reconocer en aquella mujer a la Virgen del Rocfo, a la que habfa visto en fotos o postales solo con su traje de reina. Cuando, algunos anos despues de esta enfermedad, nos vinimos a Almonte, y alguien me enseno por vez primera en mi vida una fotograffa de la Virgen vestida de pastora, caf rapidamente en la cuenta de que aquella era la mujer de mi vision. ^Comprendes aho ra? No supe lo que me habfa sucedido hasta mucho tiem po despues. (jCrees tu que un nino puede invertarse una historia como esta? Yo estoy convencido de que la Virgen hace milagros a quien le solicita ayuda cuando la necesita. Y no me importa si otros creen lo contrario. Miracle Account No. 2 "Paco," a 36-year-old member of a prominent Al monteno family, began his repertoire of miracle sto ries, not by telling of his own experiences but by re lating a story about a Rocfo visionary, named "Ana," who originally lived far from Rocfo's sphere of in fluence: I'm going to tell you of the case of a woman to whom the Virgin of the Dew appeared. She was called "Ana" and was a native of the province of Jaen. One day, Ana had a Anthropos 106.2011 521 vision of the Virgin Mary, but she did not recognize which of the Virgin's manifestations it was, although the word "Rocfo" did appear in her vision. Given that she lived in an area of Andalucfa that then had little to do with Rocfo devotion, this expression [this word] meant nothing to her. And she began to investigate its significance. Someone in formed her about the existence of a Virgin named Rocfo in the province of Huelva. She sent a letter to the bishop of our diocese inquiring about that Virgin. Shortly after wards she received a written reply accompanied by a pho to of the Virgin of the Dew dressed as a queen. Looking at the image she did not recognize in it that which she had seen in her vision, so she wrote again to the bishop, but this time she carefully described the details of the image that had appeared to her. For a second time, the bishop re plied to her request for information. This time the photo [note: that the bishop sent] was of Rocfo in her shepherd ess dress. Looking at the photo Ana immediately identi fied it as the image of her vision. She took this fact as a clear indication that she should move to El Rocfo in order to be closer to the Virgin. Voy a contarte el caso de una mujer a la que se le apare cio la Virgen del Rocfo. Se llamaba Ana y era natural de la provincia de Jaen. Un dfa, Ana tuvo una vision de la Virgen Maria, pero sin llegar a reconocer de que Virgen se trataba, aunque en su vision aparecfa una palabra: "Ro cio". Dado que vivfa en una zona de Andalucfa entonces poco relacionada con la devotion rociera, esa expresion no le decfa nada. Y empezo a indagar sobre su significa do. Alguien le informo sobre la existencia de una Virgen asf llamada en la provincia de Huelva. Mando una carta al obispo de esa diocesis preguntando por esa Virgen. Poco despues recibio contestation escrita accompanada de una foto de la Virgen del Rocfo vestida de reina. Al ver la ima gen, no reconocio en ella a la que habfa visto en su vi sion, por lo que de nuevo escribio al obispo pero esta vez dandole detalles minuciosos de la imagen que se le habfa aparecido. Por segunda vez, el obispo contesta a su soli citud. En esta ocasion la foto correspondfa a la Virgen del Rocfo con su traje de pastora. Al verla, Ana la identified inmediatamente como la imagen de su vision. Entendio el hecho como un clara indicacion de que debi'a trasladarse al Rocfo para asf estar mas cerca de la Virgen. Miracle Account No. 3 "Elena," a middle aged woman whose family has long been involved in the administration of the Ro cfo cultus in Almonte, told us of an event that oc curred in Almonte three decades earlier: What I am going to tell you happened in Almonte, back in the 1950s. One day a girl of no more than four years</page><page sequence="12">522 of age was playing and, I don't know very well how, she fell into a well. And right away she began to cry and to shout asking for help. A lot of time passed and nobody heard her cries. After a while, a man happened to pass by and he heard her shouts. With the aid of other neighbors, the girl was at last able to be pulled out of the well with out suffering any injuries of consequence. But this was not an easy task because of the narrowness of the shaft and the danger that getting to the girl represented to her. While the delicate operation of raising her from the well was ongoing, the people tried to console and calm her by talking to her. Nevertheless, the girl responded by saying that she was alright and that she was not afraid because a beautiful woman was with her, accompanying her. Once she was saved, pulled out of the well without much in the way of injuries to her body, nobody paid attention to what the girl had told them, taking it as an expression of her imagination, a consequence of the fear and tension that the girl had experienced in that dark well. Three years later, the Virgin came to Almonte. The girl, now seven years old, was overcome by strong emo tion upon seeing the Virgin dressed as a shepherdess mov ing through the streets of Almonte to the parish church. She said to her parents: "Her! Her! She is the Lady who saved me!" Lo que te voy a contar sucedio en Almonte, alia por los anos cincuenta. Un dfa, una nina de no mas de cuatro anos de edad estaba jugando y, no se muy bien como, se cayo en un pozo. Y al momenta empezo a llorar y a gritar pi diendo auxilio. Pasaba el tiempo y nadie oia su llanto. Al cabo de un rata, paso por casualidad un hombre y oyo sus gritos. Con la ayuda de otros vecinos, la nina pudo por fin ser sacada del pozo sin haber sufrido heridas de conside ration. Pero esta tarea no fue facil, por la estrechez del brocal y la peligrosidad que suponfa llegar hasta la nina. Mientras duraba la delicada operation de subirla, la gente intentaba consolarla y tranquilizarla hablandole. Sin em bargo, la nina les repondio que nada le sucedfa y que no tenia miedo porque con ella estaba, acompanandola, una senora muy hermosa. Una vez estuvo a salvo, fuera del pozo, y sin apenas danos en su cuerpo, nadie presto aten cion a lo que la nina les habfa contado, tomandolo como cosa de su imagination, consecuencia del miedo y la ten sion que habfa vivido la nina en ese oscuro pozo. Tres anos mas tarde, la Virgen vino a Almonte. La nina, con siete anos cumplidos, al ver a la Virgen vestida de pastora por las calles de Almonte en su camino hacia la iglesia parroquial, cayo en una fuerte emotion. Y asf dijo a sus padres: "jElla, Ellla, esa es la Senora que me salvo!" The most obvious commonality in these apparition stories is the initial failure of the three seers to rec ognize Roci'o because she was dressed in her trav Michael D. Murphy and J. Carlos Gonzalez Faraco eling clothes when she appeared to them, instead of in her regal garb. It is striking that in the tell ing of these stories much more emphasis is placed on this initial confusion than on the strictly mirac ulous aspects of these encounters with the Virgin. Our strong impression is that these storytellers be gan their accounts of miracles with what they con sidered to be the strongest, most disarming, case in their repertoires. All three narratives were immediately preceded by what can only be characterized as formal dis claimers: each narrator took pains to avoid the ap pearance of a hard sell approach to the extraordinary stories they were about to tell. Jose echoed the sen timents of the other two storytellers by proclaiming that he did not expect everyone to believe in mira cles and that was fine with him. He said that his own personal experience and that of his friends would be his guide in these matters, and others could suit themselves. Another common feature in these narratives is that at the time of the apparitions all three of the seers lack important knowledge about Roci'o. The first visionary is a boy from a community other than Almonte, the second is an adult outsider without the slightest idea of who Rocfo might be, and the third is a very young child who had not lived long enough to have seen Roci'o dressed as a shepherdess. Thus, these three people all embody one of the most well established traits of successful Marian visionaries: social naivete. Of course, in the case of these par ticular miracles their ignorance is not an elective feature in the story; it is absolutely essential if the misidentification element of the narrative is to work. No adult Almonteno could fail to recognize Rocfo in either of her guises. The initial inability of the three seers to identi fy Rocfo strengthens the credibility not only of the visions themselves but also of the less compelling narratives that followed in the storytelling sessions. These secondary accounts either depict less dramat ic, almost mundane, events or they detail health cri ses whose resolution could easily be attributed to some cause other than supernatural agency. Taking advantage or the unusual circumstance of Rocfo's two very different costumes, this styl ized initial confusion about her identity in tales of her visitations is, we believe, central to an Almon teno strategy of persuasion that draws upon and combines both local and regional cultural elements. Eventually, the use of such strategies may gener ate stereotypic formats or cultural models like the promesa complex (in both its individual and col lective forms) and the Shepherds' Cycle, which as sume greater and greater authority with imitation Anthropos 106.2011</page><page sequence="13">Identifying the Virgin Mary and repetition (Christian 1981a: 36, 208). Ironical ly, however, the very popularity of such a model can work to undermine its effectiveness in specif ic cases, including, it would seem, that of Rocfo. Juan Infante-Galan (1971: 21-23), for decades the Official Chronicler of Rocfo's Principal Brother hood, dismisses the story of Rocfo's discovery as a "poetic legend" on the grounds that so many other purported invenciones of statues of the Virgin share precisely the same characteristics (see also Lopez Taillefert 1997). Clearly, the use or a cultural model, or even a single narrative element such as the one discussed here, runs some risk of diminishing success with overuse. But it is also possible to error by the simul taneous application of too many different models of human contact with the supernatural. In a charm ing and illuminating article, whose title in English would be "Francisco Martinez Wants to Be a Shrine Keeper," William Christian (1989) recounts the sto ry of an 18th-century Spanish shepherd and itiner ant laborer who tried to secure more lucrative and less onerous employment by faking various encoun ters with the divine. Having decided to become a shrine keeper, or santero, Francisco Martinez knew that it would be easier to preside over a new devotion than to dis place the santero of an already established sacred center. Thus, he endeavored to associate himself with a new miraculous sacred image likely to attract alms-bearing pilgrims seeking interaction with an efficacious supernatural intermediary. At least this was the opinion of the inquisitor who ultimately was called upon to judge the authenticity of a series of encounters with the supernatural that Martinez alleged to have experienced. Before eventually recanting and admitting his series of frauds, Martinez claimed that his experi ences began when a mysterious, fair-haired youth appeared before him and predicted that various su pernatural events were about to transpire. The pil grim, "recognized as an angelic messenger only in retrospect," advised Martinez that his crucifix would begin to sweat blood from its wounds. Mar tinez eventually displayed a crucifix that, in fact, he smeared with his own blood. Although this appar ent miracle attracted a great deal of lay attention, a priest confiscated Francisco's sacred object, thus ef fectively thwarting his plans. Undaunted Martinez claimed that while performing the Stations of the Cross, he had a vision in which a small, black image of the Virgin Mary appeared to him, instructing him to go to a nearby town to tell the people to visit her in a place she designated. Martinez told his story to a local priest who accompanied him to a rocky ra Anthropos 106.2011 523 vine where they found a small statue of Mary. Un fortunately, perhaps because of the sheer number and diversity of his supernatural encounters, Mar tinez was not believed and under questioning re vealed that the only part of his story that was true was that a real pilgrim did speak with him, but with out making any predictions or performing any mira cles. He not only admitted to doctoring the crucifix with his own blood, but also revealed that he had stolen the small statue of the Virgin, had stripped it of its clothing and blackened its face to disguise it. He hid it in the ravine and made up the story of the vision. Martinez's scam unwittingly reproduces the cul tural stratigraphy of supernatural visitations of hu mans in the history of Spanish Catholicism. The most recent knowledge structures are utilized first and when they do not produce the desired effects, Martinez works his way back through earlier cul tural models which had progressively fallen out of favor, either because of pressure from ecclesiasti cal authorities or because they lost credibility with (or appeal for) laymen. Presumably, if the secular and church authorities had not intervened, he would have ended his search for a new job by discovering the corpse of a Christian saint martyred by the Ro mans. In any event, it would appear that successful seers not only develop their accounts around well established cultural models, but they also instanti ate these models in a credible manner. Unsuccess ful seers, like Francisco Martinez, fail to do one or the other. Note, however, that he begins his false ac counts by claiming to have failed initially to iden tify a supernatural personality; he intentionally lied about mistaking an angel for a pilgrim. Discussion In suggesting that problematical identifications of the Virgin Mary may serve a rhetorical role in sto ries of her apparitions, we do not wish to imply that Carroll's psychodynamic analysis of particu lar seers is necessarily misguided or incorrect. In deed, especially in the two accounts from Almonte that involve children, Carroll's sort of analysis, with some slight modification, can contribute to our un derstanding of their extraordinary experiences. Yet, there are important differences between the Rocfo apparitions and those addressed by Carroll. First, Rocfo's visitations did not establish a new Marian devotion but rather serve to sustain one of great vintage; these visions are of a "preexisting image" (Christian 1981a: 206 f.) with a substantial reputa tion for the performance of miracles. Second, and</page><page sequence="14">524 Michael D. Murphy and J. Carlos Gonzalez Faraco perhaps more importantly, in the Rocfo miracles in volving the children it is not necessary to look to Oedipal conflicts or problematic relations with a mother figure to identify the proximate source of the apparition. The two children appear to have un consciously elaborated a nurturing mother figure as a solution to a problem whose genesis was high fe ver in one case and claustrophobic entrapment in the other. Thus, whereas the idea of "mother" is a problem that inspires the visions of the French seers studied by Carroll, hallucinatory maternal images are psychological responses to dilemmas of a quite different order in at least two of the Rocfo miracles. This, of course, underscores that which is obvious to anyone who actually observes Andalusian Marian devotionalism close at hand: the Virgin Mary is an extraordinarily multivocalic and flexible symbol; she performs a variety of psychological, cultural, and social work for her diverse constituency (Noter mans 2008). Those who seek some sort of generic psychological characterization of her do so at the risk of trampling over considerable social complex ity and cultural nuance. Mary's great salience in An dalusia (and elsewhere) resides not in a single psy chodynamic service that she provides for her vast and varied body of devotees. Rather, her success as a symbol is due, in part at least, to the fact that she not only offers the believer several different kinds of psychological comfort (e.g., the satisfaction of pre-oedipal dependency needs, relief for problems of insecure gender identity, and partial resolutions of oedipal difficulties), she also serves as a vehi cle for the elaboration of various art forms and for the creation of aesthetically pleasing social contexts (Murphy y Gonzalez Faraco 2002b). Additionally, the organization of her cultus constitutes a struc tural backbone that provides social continuity for many Andalusian communities, regardless of what sort of political regime happens to be in place at the moment. Carroll s psychodynamic explanation or contu sion about the Virgin's identity in the visionary ex perience is not incompatible with our emphasis on its role in the culturally constructed and historical ly shifting knowledge structures that underlie and generate socially successful accounts of apparitions. We would simply contend that the initial failure to identify an apparition is not just a threshold that an intense psychological experience must cross if it is to be incorporated into a religious tradition; it simul taneously serves as a rhetorical device that reduces cognitive dissonance and cultural ambivalence and by so doing helps produce that very transit from the private to the public realm. Moreover, it is a very ro bust and versatile narrative element that appears in a variety of culturally scripted interactions of humans with supernatural personalities and sacred objects. We have described here its role in the reported ex periences of 19th-century French visionaries, in the much older narratives of the Shepherd's Cycle, in Francisco Martinez's invention of a "mysterious pil grim," and in the unusual case of Rocio's dual repre sentations in contemporary apparition tales. Other examples, from Spain and elsewhere, could be adduced if space permitted, but suffice it to say that this narrative element appears easily to lodge itself in cultural models circulating in all three distributions of Catholic culture, the universal (or at least the European), the regional, and the local. This suggests that perhaps the misidentification el ement is a central component of a general schema of human-supernatural interaction in the culture of Catholicism. The eventual recognition of the Virgin may indeed mark the movement of a private experi ence, with strictly personal significance to the seer alone, into the public realm of Marian devotion alism. But it may also represent the intuitive (and perhaps unconscious) understanding that a tempo rarily reluctant visionary, one who obviously is not attempting to engage the supernatural, is a more be lievable visionarv. Melford Spiro's view that religion's primary util ity lies in its "disguised representation and gratifica tion of the repressed wishes" (1987: 182) is in total accord with the central thesis of Carroll's work on the cult of the Virgin Mary. Carroll's skillful use of that insight enables him to explain why some peo ple are more likely to experience apparitions than others; it also helps him to account for the varying content of those experiences. Yet, Spiro also argues that for religion to do its affective work, it must be invested with cognitive salience (1987: 161-184). Guided by that observation we have sought to un derstand why some accounts of the miraculous cap ture the attention of larger audiences, or simply en joy more frequent and privileged retelling, while others inspire little and fleeting interest. In his in fluential definition of religion, Clifford Geertz neat ly makes the point that we would underscore here by asserting that the moods and motivations pro duced by religion are clothed in "an aura of factual ity" (1973: 90). The delayed identification of appa ritions is so frequently encountered in accounts of Marian visions precisely because it contributes im portantly to establishing just that aura of factuality. Fieldwork for this article was conducted in 1984-86, 1996, 2003, and 2006 in and around the Andalusian town of Almonte.
