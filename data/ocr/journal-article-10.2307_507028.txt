Adrimi-Sismani, A. Batziou-Efstathiou, M. Besios, A. Cambitoglou, E. Christmann, P. Chrysostomou,J.L. Davis, A. Douzougli, N. Efstratiou, D.V. Grammenos, B. Hansel, A. Hondroyanni, G. Karametrou, S. Kotsos, H. Koukouli- Chrysanthaki, Z. Malakasioti, D. Malamidou, S. Morris, J. Papadopoulos, S. Papadopoulos, A. Papanthimou, A. Pap- asteriou, M. Pappa, E. Poulaki, V. Rondiri, C.N. Runnels, M. Savina, T.E Tartaron, G. Toufexis, R. Treuil, K. and D. Wardle, N. Wilkie, C.L. Zachos, and H. Ziota. T. Cullen, D.V. Grammenos, P. Halstead, G.H. Hourmouziadis, A. Kalo- girou, and K.D. Vitelli provided incisive comments on large sections of the manuscript. A. Vargas and M. Magafa helped design the maps and, together with P. Skoufis, ensured com- munication between continents. We repeatedly and extensively discussed among our- selves most of the issues we treat. The closest collabora- tion has been between Andreou and Kotsakis, who wrote the sections on Thessaly, central and eastern Macedonia, and Thrace, with Kotsakis writing primarily about the Neo- lithic, and Andreou about the Bronze Age. The note on the history of research in Macedonia, the sections on west- ern Macedonia and Epirus, and the short concluding note on the earliest Neolithic were written by Fotiadis.

However alien they may be to the Neo- lithic and Bronze Age, such divisions continue to play powerful and multiple roles in the production of archaeological knowledge; they are devices as much as they are obstacles.' Our way of coping with their ill effects is indirect. In the body of the review we treat each modern province (1Iepuqpppta) in turn, beginning with Thessaly, continuing with western, central, and eastern Macedonia and Thrace, and end- ing with Epirus. We resist, however, the temptation to develop grand syntheses of the prehistory of each province, or of northern Greece as a whole. The effort to write such syntheses would entrap us in a laby- rinth of assumptions and theoretical presuppositions that we are not prepared to accept, and it would en- tail leaps of faith and, ultimately, violence to the archaeological evidence. We prefer instead to be as synthetic in our scope and conclusions as circum- stances in each province allow. We cannot overstress the fact that our conclusions, drawn upon the work of hundreds of researchers, are provisional. We expect-in fact, we hope-that they will be chal- lenged in the very near future. That is all the more likely for northern Greece today, since many field projects are currently in progress, and they have thus far been reported only in preliminary fashion. We focus here on questions of regional signifi- cance, and on interregional comparisons and com- parisons between archaeological phases. The state of archaeological knowledge is uneven across the regions with which we are concerned, with the re- sult that we cannot be wholly consistent from one region to the next in the questions we address, nor can we attempt interregional comparisons in all cru- cial respects. Our strategy is therefore opportunis- tic: we exploit the particular strengths of archaeo- logical knowledge in each region, and we point out the weaknesses. We have adopted the broadest chronological framework and terminology, and we use calendrical rather than radiocarbon dates (table 1).2 Even this em Siedlungshiigel der Bronze- und Eisen- zeit Makedoniens, 1975-1979: Die Gra- bung und der Baubefund (Prahistor- ische Archdiologie in Siidosteuropa 7, Berlin 1989).

It is small consolation that political boundaries often follow geographical ones (e.g., coasts, massive mountains, steep climatic gradients). Geographical boundaries, and the regions they define, are negotiable, and have limited authority outside particular political fields. See M.

Particularly troublesome is the phase we designate as "Middle Bronze Age," which can be identified only in Thessaly and parts of Mac- edonia. Where the phase remains elusive, we resort to the broader term "later Bronze Age," covering the time period from ca. 230012200 to ca. 1100 B.C. Sub- divisions within the phases shown in table 1 are possible for many sites and regions. These are dis- cussed along with the other data from the respec- tive sites and regions.3 THESSALY The pioneering work of Tsountas and Wace and Thompson during the early 20th century has made Thessaly the focal point of Neolithic research in Greece (fig. 1).4 Long before any systematic frame- work was established in other parts of Greece, re- search in Thessaly possessed an elaborate chrono- typological system suitable for describing the culture history of the area. To some extent this privileged position is still held today, and some of the central issues of Greek prehistory, such as the beginning of a farming economy or the emergence of social com- plexity, revolve around research in Thessaly, although questions of culture history and chronology are still discussed. The refinement of the chronological framework was the main objective of the German and Greek excavations carried out from 1953 to 1977 at a num- ber of Thessalian sites. This approach was the nat- ural outcome of a long-established concern with the importance of the Aegean for European chronology. In the last decade or so, research in Thessaly has moved into a phase of synthesis, with less emphasis on excavation and more on the analysis of excavated data. At the same time, new issues have been put forward and new methods and approaches adopted. Gulf of Volos The most intensively excavated area of Thessaly is its coastal region. Research, which started here 3 For the perplexities surrounding the date of the ear- liest Neolithic, see E.E Bloedow, "The Date of the Earliest Phase at Argissa Magoula in Thessaly and Other Neolithic Sites in Greece," MeditArch 5-6 (1992-1993) 49-57. 4 For an account of the Greek archaeological research in Thessaly carried out from 1881 to 1975, see C.J. Gallis, "A Short Chronicle of Greek Archaeological Investigations in Thessaly from 1881 until the Present Day," in La Thes- salie, Actes de la Table-Ronde 21-24juillet 1975, Lyon (Collec- tion de la Maison de I'Orient m6diterran6en 6, Lyons 1979) 1-30.</page><page sequence="4">540 STELIOS ANDREOU, MICHAEL FOTIADIS, AND KOSTAS KOTSAKIS [AJA 100 at the turn of the century and continues to date, has produced a fairly complete excavation record cover- ing extensive parts of settlements and cemeteries from the Early Neolithic to the Late Bronze Age. Sesklo (fig. 1:1). A new period of research was ini- tiated at Sesklo in 1956 by D.R. Theocharis. With shorter or longer intervals, this period lasted until 1981, and is partly summarized in NEoAitO1K 0 E16dq and partly in a number of preliminary reports.5 The initial objective was the reexamination of the stra- tigraphy of the mound, but the focus of investiga- tion gradually shifted to the extended Middle Neo- lithic settlement outside and around the tell of Sesklo. Theocharis named this part of the settlement the polis (Sesklo B), in contrast to the original acropolis of Tsountas (Sesklo A), and he put forward a model of urban development and population concentration that had no antecedents in the Greek Neolithic.6 The total excavated area approaches 4,500 m2 and the estimated area of the settlement amounts to 12 ha, unequally divided between the acropolis and the polis. The acropolis, where Tsountas's original exca- vation had been conducted, is in the form of a tell, 8.5 m high and ca. 0.3 ha in area. The polis stretches out on the flat slope to the northwest, on the edge of a dissected terrace of Tertiary lacustrine marls. Both parts are flanked on the north and south by deeply cut streams that, by Tsountas's time, had already eroded a large part of the tell. The stratigraphy of the site, clarification of which was one of the principal aims of Theocharis, was checked in a number of trenches. On the tell itself, the stratigraphic sequence was uniform.7 The lowest part was characterized by the absence of pottery and was considered "preceramic."8 The rest of the stratig- raphy was divided into Early Neolithic and Middle Neolithic, each further subdivided into three phases. The Early and the Middle Neolithic end stratigraph- ically with an extensive destruction.9 The Late Neo- lithic, already investigated by Tsountas, was not studied stratigraphically to any extent by Theocharis.1o No significant architectural finds support the di- vision of the Early Neolithic period into three parts. The division rests mostly on observations of ceramic change. The architectural evidence, though tenuous, points to small rectangular houses built with pise walls and posts or with stone socles and mudbrick." By contrast, the MN phases (I, II, IIIA, IIIB) corre- spond to architectural episodes of rebuilding houses and floors." The MN IIIB phase ends with a wide- 5 D.R.

See also infra p. 597. 9 Wijnen (supra n. 7) 11. Contrary to the MN, the EN destruction was not observed in other parts of the settle- ment. Therefore it would not be wise to treat it as a general feature of the Sesklo stratigraphy. 1( Theocharis reports levels belonging to the FN "Rach- mani" phase from the acropolis and ascribes them to three subphases. See Prakt 1966, 6. No further information is available from this stratigraphic section. Weisshaar's (Pef- kakia I, 85) reconstruction is insubstantial. 11 Wijnen (supra n. 5) 56-63. 12 Prakt 1968, 25; Prakt 1971, 15; Kotsakis 46-51. Also, K. Kotsakis, EaKXo. 01 avaoKaacpg rov A.P.

Otto, Die verzierte Keramik der Sesklo- und Diminikultur Thes- saliens (Mainz 1985) 66 attempts to subdivide the MN se- quence of Sesklo into six subperiods (MN IA, IB, IIA, IIB, IIIA, IIIB) on the basis of stylistic observations on the pot- tery published by Tsountas. The stratigraphic support for this subdivision is insufficient and contradicts some of Theocharis's observations. See Theocharis 1973 (supra n. 5) 79, 119 and Prakt 1968, 27-30. I.

Moreover, large areas of Sesklo B are devoid of cultural deposits. The evidence in the extended settlement points toward a pattern of hab- itation of considerable spatial and temporal discon- tinuity, with parts of the site remaining either tem- porarily or totally uninhabited.'6 There is no such evidence at Sesklo A, where spatial discontinuity is limited. Dispersed traces of EN habitation are also present at Sesklo B, occasionally near the surface, but LN material is absent. Significant differences between the two areas of the settlement are observed in architecture as well. All the buildings explored at Sesklo A are freestand- ing, sometimes with considerable space around them, or built around yards. By contrast, buildings at Sesklo B form tight clusters, sharing walls and facilities. At least some of these clusters preserve facilities for food-processing and storage, normally distrib- uted in separate rooms."7 A typical example of a Sesklo A dwelling is given by house 39: it is spacious (8.5 x 5.5 m), with one entrance on its narrow west side, and no internal divisions. Three areas are dis- tinguished inside: a stone-built platform associated with storage vessels, a hearth situated next to it, and a work area with grinders, querns, and an oven on the far east end. The arrangement integrates essen- tial needs of the household in one defined unit.18 The differences between the two areas in the Mid- dle Neolithic are emphasized by the stone "fortifica- tion walls" that encircle part of the tell. The walls were observed initially by Tsountas and since then their defensive function has been debated.'9 Their size and construction make it more probable that they served as retaining walls, supporting terraces on which houses were founded.20 Whatever the practical purpose of these features, they represent the concern of the inhabitants for maximizing the available space on the tell itself, a concern absent from Sesklo B. At the same time, the effort to sep- arate the two parts of the settlement stresses further their differences during the Middle Neolithic. Closely related to the dual habitational pattern at Sesklo is the spatial distribution of pottery, which was preserved thanks to the extended final MN de- struction. The frequency of painted pottery is con- sistently higher at Sesklo A than Sesklo B. Together with differences in ceramic technology, this discrep- ancy between the two areas seems but another as- pect of the dual settlement pattern at Sesklo.21 In this respect, the original acropolis-polis model might still be relevant, as it implies a deeper difference be- tween the two areas. The size of the population, how- ever, given the more or less dispersed habitation at Sesklo B, was probably a 10th or less of the high figure (3,000-4,000) estimated by Theocharis. Moreover, the 13 Prakt 1972, 8-9; Kotsakis 46-51. This widespread de- struction level permits a clear and positive chronological correlation of the final deposits as well as of the houses, floors, and constructions associated with them in differ- ent parts of the settlement. 1' Excavations uncovered 22 MN houses, and a consid- erable number of partly preserved other structures. They were all built with stone socles and mudbrick. For an ear- lier discussion of the architecture of Sesklo, based on pre- liminary reports, see R. Elia, A Study of the Neolithic Archi- tecture of Thessaly, Greece (Diss. Boston Univ. 1982) 128-33, 169-74, 216-33. For the "potter's house," see Prakt 1968, 27-30. This house is reconstructed by Theocharis 1973 (supra n. 5) fig. 16 as a two-storied building, a reconstruc- tion that has been widely accepted, e.g., in A. Sherratt ed., 7he Cambridge Encyclopedia of Archaeology (Cambridge 1980) fig. 15.6. Examination of the stratigraphic evidence, how- ever, does not clearly support the existence of the second floor. ' K. Kotsakis, "The Use of Habitational Space in Neo- lithic Sesklo," in La Thessalie A, 125-30; contra Wijnen (supra n. 7) 14-15. "' Kotsakis (supra n. 15) 127-28 notes that this pattern resembles that of the extended LN sites of central Mac- edonia and contrasts with the pattern of persistent occu- pation of tell sites (see infra p. 585). It is extremely inter- esting, however, that at Sesklo both patterns are present simultaneously, especially if a socially recognized signifi- cance was attached to the tell part of the settlement, which physically represented the long lineage of the households of the community. 7 E.g., houses A, F, and Z2, Kotsakis (supra n. 5) fig. 3.4. 18 This arrangement is seen in the well-known house model from Platia Magoula Zarkou; see K.I. Gallis, "A Late Neolithic Foundation Offering from Thessaly," Antiquity 59 (1985) 20-24. 1., Theocharis 1973 (supra n. 5) 65; Dimini 85. 20 Kotsakis (supra n. 12): at least one house was founded on top of one of these walls. Most of the MN houses were founded on varying levels, and the whole settlement on the tell must have had a steplike, terraced appearance. 21 Kotsakis 55-56, 95-102. For the technological differ- ences between the two areas of Sesklo, see Y. Maniatis, V. Perdikatsis, and K. Kotsakis, "Assessment of In-site Vari- ability of Pottery from Sesklo, Thessaly," Archaeometry 30 (1988) 264-74. The archaeometric analysis on a small strat- ified sample from both areas has found a marked prefer- ence for calcareous clays in Sesklo A, non-calcareous in Sesklo B. Macroscopic examination of the pottery from both areas seems to support this conclusion.</page><page sequence="6">542 STELIOS ANDREOU, MICHAEL FOTIADIS, AND KOSTAS KOTSAKIS [AJA 100 instability of the extended part of the settlement con- trasts with the permanent "urban" characteristics of a polis, and the supposed fortification walls of the acropolis can be more reasonably interpreted as re- taining constructions. Finally, although the differ- ences between the polis and the acropolis are clear, they need not imply a formally stratified society with a well-defined elite controlling social production. It is rather a difference in scale, which, at least as far as pottery is concerned, results in a certain in- equality of access to raw materials and produce.22 An interesting methodological lesson can be learned from the example of Sesklo. The complex intrasite variability of the archaeological features shows clearly that comparisons among sites are po- tentially misleading. Given the generally limited ex- tent of excavations in Greece, it is unwise to describe excavation sequences as "typical" and to base com- parative conclusions on them. Most of the syntheses of the Neolithic in Thessaly have not considered this important factor of latent variability within sites.23 Little is known about Sesklo after the Neolithic, mainly because the higher levels had already been removed by Tsountas. In the area of Sesklo B, there are no traces of Bronze Age habitation, except for MBA cist graves, common at Sesklo A as well.24 Traces of massive retaining walls on the mound must also belong to this period, although their exact date is obscure.25 Houses of the Middle Bronze Age are reported from the western side of the tell, but evi- dently this part of the Bronze Age settlement did not spread as far as the Sesklo B area. Particularly interesting is the observation of traces of EBA hab- itation in area E, ca. 130 m southeast of Sesklo A, across the Seskouliotis ravine.26 Pyrgos (fig. 1:2). On a low hill that overlooks the Gulf of Volos, ca. 250 m north of Sesklo, lies the small site of Pyrgos (25 m in diameter), already identified by Tsountas and excavated by the IF' Ephoreia in 1979.27 The excavators explored a deposit containing mainly LN "classical Dimini" pottery and a level with FN "Rachmani" pottery, including incised sherds with white or pink filling, and crusted ware. A thick layer of burnt debris separates the two deposits. The inventory of finds and the few architectural remains point to a more or less permanent settlement. If this small site is directly associated with LN Sesklo, it would match the MN pattern of dispersed habitation around the acropolis. In this case the site could rep- resent a small cluster of households placed a few hundred meters away from Sesklo, overlooking the extended plateau, where the prime farmland lies. Further to the north, two previously known sites, Spartia (fig. 1:3) and Palaiokastron, have recently been reinvestigated.28 Together with Pyrgos and Sesklo, they seem to have flanked, during the Late Neolithic, the Tertiary plateau of lacustrine marls of excellent arable qualities (100-200 masl). Unlike Pyrgos, they are long-lived sites, occupied until Hel- lenistic times or later. Spartia and Palaiokastron are situated on the main pass linking the eastern plain of Thessaly with the small coastal plain of Volos. Sesklo is connected to the coastal area via a route that passes from the Seskouliotis stream to Dimini, Petromagoula, and Pefkakia (fig. 1:4-6). To the south- west the route continues to the Aerino plateau, where four more prehistoric sites were located, of which Persoufli Magoula is also a site of considerable lon- gevity. Another pass, at 300 masl, leads over low mountains to the area of Pyrassos (fig. 1:8) on the present coast of the Pagasitikos Gulf. Dimini (fig. 1:4). The well-known site of Dimini was reinvestigated by Hourmouziadis in 1974-1976. The main objective was to reexamine the architec- ture and to consider the relationship of the site to neighboring settlements in an attempt to integrate 22 Kotsakis 264-300; K.

Mottier, Die deutschen Ausgrabungen auf der Otzaki-Magula in Thessalien II (BAM 22, Bonn 1981) 39-54, regards the Otzaki sequence as typical and bases on it the relative chronology of the excavated MN Thessalian sites. On these grounds she views the Sesklo sequence (p. 43) as contemporary with the deeper levels of MN Otzaki, and argues for an early abandonment of Sesklo. The available I'C dates from the last MN phase at Sesklo, however, argue clearly against such a conjecture, as does the A313-y pot- tery of the "degenerate" (pl. E, 113-2-1, no. 72) style, which is very common in MN IIIB Sesklo and appears also in final MN levels at Otzaki. 2.

Spatial infor- mation became available on a large scale,30 although the intensity of the investigation was not uniform throughout the settlement. The tell of Dimini lies on the higher western edge of the coastal plain of Volos. It sits on an out- crop of schist, at 18 masl and 3 km from the present coast. A major episode of alluviation, dated by '4C to the fourth millennium B.C., has formed the plain, pushing the coast away from Neolithic Dimini.31 The other sites on the Gulf of Volos, Pefkakia and Petromagoula (fig. 1:5-6), have retained their coastal location. Clarification of the function of the six concentric perimeter walls at Dimini, uncovered by Stais and Tsountas, was the initial objective of the reexami- nation. Hourmouziadis carefully evaluated the archi- tectural evidence, and concluded that the purpose of the perimeter walls was to enclose four main do- mestic areas or "courtyard groups." The four wards were situated at a lower level around a central court. Each ward contained a larger building and a num- ber of storage or food preparation facilities as well as work areas.32 Communication was ensured through the radiating entrances. According to Hourmouzi- adis, the pattern of the six concentric perimeter walls was the outcome of the gradual growth of the settle- ment and reflected the insistence of the inhabitants on dividing their settlement into well-demarcated areas using internal boundaries. The walls also satis- fied the need to support and maximize the available space on the small rocky spur of Dimini. The previous interpretation of the walls as defen- sive constructions was seriously questioned by Hour- mouziadis. He argued that their size and location do not conform with their presumed purpose of pre- venting hostile intrusions. He could find no evidence, for instance, that the height of the walls exceeded the measure of a simple boundary wall." His main argument, however, derived from his view of social organization: he argued that a Neolithic fortified acropolis, defending the central part of the settle- ment, would imply a stratified social structure, in- compatible with the presumed "Neolithic mode of production.":4 It must be remembered, however, that a territorial demarcation, in any form, primar- ily controls access, physically or symbolically, to the settlement or to a part of it." Such barriers to ac- cess, mainly perimetric ditches, are not uncommon in Neolithic settlements."6 In any case, the interpre- tation of the walls at Dimini is a reminder that ar- 29 Hourmouziadis, Dimini 25-27, describes this system as a threefold structure comprising the subsystems of the orga- nization of space, economy, and non-productive activities. 30 Several scholars have taken advantage of the recent spatial data: P.

Only in late antiquity did alluviation prevail, extending the plain toward the sea. Nevertheless, anthropogenic FN and BA alluvia- tion remains a plausible suggestion, and conforms with observations made in the Larisa plain. See A. Demitrack, The Late Quaternary Geologic History of the Larissa Plain, Thes- saly, Greece. Tectonic, Climatic and Human Impact on the Land- scape (Diss.

In two subsequent articles, Hourmou- ziadis explains more clearly what he believes to be the ba- sic elements of a "Neolithic mode of production," which he considers incompatible with an antagonistic social re- ality involving aggression and defense: G.H. Hourmouzi- adis, "Etoayoyfi oato vEottKll6 tpdno n7apayoyiq," Anthro- pologika 1 (1980) 118-29 and Anthropologika 2 (1981) 39-54. Nevertheless, in the case of Dimini, equal access to house- hold production, as suggested by Hourmouziadis, would seem inconsistent with the seclusion of the productive units behind stone walls. :" According to Hourmouziadis, Dimini 51, Neolithic Dimini extended outside the acropolis, covering an area of 3 ha, though in a less organized fashion. The extent of the settlement was confirmed by subsequent research in the area of modern Dimini: V. Adrimi-Sismani, ArchDelt 32 B' (1977) 131-34. We have already seen a similar arrange- ment at Sesklo. 'l Ditches have been reported from a number of LN sites in Thessaly. For Arapi Magoula and Argissa Magoula, see H. Hauptmann and V.

Accord- ing to Hourmouziadis's observations, the typical "megaron" form at Dimini resulted from a later, EBA modification of the central court area. The mod- ification was related to the demographic decline of the mound and the deterioration of the communal character of the central court, which was then taken over by a single household, apparently an eminent one.38 The reconstruction of the gradual formation of the "megaron" at Dimini is convincing and warns against the strict typological approach to architec- ture. The dating, however, of the Dimini "megaron" to the Early Bronze Age is not supported by decisive stratigraphic evidence, since all the deposits there had already been dug by Stais and Tsountas.39 More- over, similar LN architectural finds from Sesklo, Ayia Sophia, and possibly Visviki seem to point to an ear- lier dating.40 Within the limitations of the uneven scale of ex- cavation, Dimini offers an opportunity to observe the spatial arrangement of various finds, including food preparation and storage facilities. They are fairly evenly distributed across the discrete domes- tic areas and tend to be located indoors rather than in the open areas. A good example is house N, which contained four food preparation and two storage facilities, though not all of them were in use at the same time.41 Of the other facilities scattered throughout the site, one was identified as a special- ized pottery workshop.42 The composition of the faunal assemblage related to food preparation and consumption was found by Halstead to vary insig- nificantly within the different domestic areas, which may indicate generally equal access to produce; the possibility remains, however, that some domestic units consumed more meat than others.43 The ma- jority of faunal remains were classified as sheep/goat, while the percentages of pigs and cattle fluctuated. Eight intramural infant cremation burials were un- covered, all placed near hearths and in pots, some made especially for this purpose.44 Figurines are present almost everywhere but their distribution shows a strong concentration in the three periph- eral domestic areas rather than the central court.45 Objects made of Spondylus have a similar distribu- tion. A concentration of finished rings was identified in house N, while an even greater concentration of buttons and cylinder beads was found in the area of the pottery workshop (area C). Regardless of the possible interpretation of this pattern, which can partly be due to uneven intensity of excavation, the quantity and type of objects prove that LN Dimini was a significant node in the extended exchange net- work of Spondylus.46 :7 I.

Particularly useful is the dating of the Ayia Sophia "megaron," although this has been only partially uncovered and is not altogether comparable to the megara at Dimini and Sesklo. To these examples one may add the recently found LN "megara" at Makriyalos in Pieria; see infra p. 573. 41 Dimini 133-59. See also Halstead 1984, ch. 5.2.3.

According to Tsuneki</page><page sequence="9">1996] THE NEOLITHIC AND BRONZE AGE OF NORTHERN GREECE 545 The poor preservation of the post-LN architectural remains has led to conflicting reconstructions of the later occupational history of the mound. The circuit walls were possibly replaced by a ditch, and occu- pation became more sparse and horizontally dis- continuous.47 Halstead argues for the transforma- tion of the hill into a segregated elite area in the Final Neolithic and Early Bronze Age. He considers the segregation of the hill as part of a process, be- gun in the Late Neolithic, toward an institutional- ized hierarchical organization."8 Whether the end of the Neolithic at Dimini is marked by crisis and disintegration or by continuity and consolidation of a central authority remains an open issue. A conspicuous change is manifest near the end of the Middle Bronze Age, when the hill was again demarcated by a mudbrick perimeter wall. From that period onward the evidence of occupation is limited to a few burials.4t' The transformation of former habitation mounds to burial grounds was a practice not uncommon at Thessalian sites during the later part of the Middle Bronze Age, and may represent a type of bounded burial, existing in the region prior to the appearance of the first tholoi and built tombs.50 According to Halstead, the move may be related to the action of elites wishing to isolate their burial grounds. The most important development for the under- standing of the later history of the site has been the excavation of an extensive LBA settlement on the alluvial plain at the foot of the mound. Since 1978 the Archaeological Service has excavated several blocks of houses flanking a wide street. Surface finds and trial trenches indicate that the town was ca. 10 ha in size.51 The latest architectural remains were found a little below the surface, and the excavation provides a picture of the layout of the settlement in its last phase, which was characterized by pottery of the late LH IIIB or early IIIC style. Earlier deposits, reached in small trenches beneath the floors, show successive habitation from the Middle Bronze Age onward.52 (supra n. 30) 13, the Spondylus rings were exclusively man- ufactured in house N, and beads and buttons in area C. Halstead (pp. 607-608), however, points out that waste prod- ucts from the manufacture of rings, buttons, and beads were found in almost every part of the settlement, which suggests a more dispersed production of these objects. He proposes, therefore, that these objects were unequally ac- cumulated by individual domestic groups as exchange to- kens for "social surplus." This exchange may also have in- cluded copper artifacts. A copper flat ax and an earring have been analyzed and discussed by V. McGeehan-Liritzis and N.H. Gale, "Chemical and Lead Isotope Analyses of Greek Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age Metals," Ar- chaeometry 30 (1988) 201-207, 211-15, 222-23. The Dimini artifacts were made of arsenical copper, the provenance of which cannot be identified. For a more general discus- sion of personal ornaments in the Thessalian Neolithic, see N.

Dating these modifications with any accuracy is impossible. 41 Halstead 1984, chs. 5.2.4 and 8.1.2-3. House remains dated to the EBA have recently been found in the lower ground, south of the mound, but no details have been pub- lished. See V. Adrimi-Sismani, "H uKrlvaimlK1 n 6X1 OTo AtCffvt: N'6Tcpa 8&amp;68oE4va yta Triv IohK6," in Iolkos 22. The massive foundations of a large building between the first and sec- ond perimeter walls on the southwest, found during the early period of excavations, may, according to Halstead 1984, ch. 5.2.4, represent the remains of a FN central build- ing. Hourmouziadis and Adrimi-Sismani argue for the iden- tification of the same building with the elite residence or the "palace" of the LBA settlement: Dimini 107-10, 149, fig. 6 and pl. 1; Adrimi-Sismani, "MuKirvaiK6q otKtaGi6q Atiirviou," in Ancient Thessaly 275-76, pl. 59a. The docu- mentation offered by Tsountas, however, is insufficient to decide the matter one way or another. 4" For the MBA wall and contemporary habitation on the lower ground, see Adrimi-Sismani in Iolkos (supra n. 48) 23.

Niemeier eds., Politeia: Society and State in the Aegean Bronze Age (Ae- gaeum 12, Liege 1995) 69-72. The mortuary reuse of hab- itation mounds may imply an attempt by an elite to ap- propriate symbolically the past qua conspicuous ruins. In most cases, however, it is uncertain that the burials belong to an elite group. 51 V.

The houses, with a stone socle and mudbrick superstruc- ture, were comprised of several rooms around court- yards, where wells were located. Walls and floors were occasionally plastered. One of the most regularly planned houses had a main room with a hearth and two smaller rooms at the back. A fenced corner in one of the rooms of another house contained a bull figurine and a possible altar, probably indicating a domestic shrine. Several rooms were used for stor- age and as specialized working areas, including a space with traces of metalworking. Finally, a pot- ter's kiln was uncovered at the eastern limits of the settlement.53 The layout indicates a complex, well-organized community, with central planning and craft special- ization. The two tholos tombs and a possible central building at the top of the tell point to the existence of a central authority. Dimini offers the most com- plete picture of a Thessalian LBA community, so far unique in the region. PeJkakia (fig. 1:5). Pefkakia Magoula, another im- portant coastal site on the Gulf of Volos, had been investigated in the late 1950s by Theocharis, but sys- tematic research was undertaken in 1967 by MilojZ'i' and lasted until 1977. The magoula was formed on the slopes of a rocky promontory.54 It now extends over 2 ha, but it has suffered much erosion from ris- ing sea level and repeated human interventions. The Neolithic settlement must have been small, limited primarily to the top of the promontory. By contrast, trenches dug at lower levels on the side of the tell revealed thick deposits from the Bronze Age and few traces of the Neolithic.55 The information on the Neolithic sequence comes from a single trench, 13 x 10 m, on the top of the mound. A small area produced deposits of the Late Neolithic ("classical Dimini"). The rest was taken up by a sloping outcrop of the natural rock that lay immediately under the levels of the succeeding phases.56 Three FN architectural phases were de- fined with rectangular houses built on stone foun- dations and with clay floors. Plans cannot be recon- structed, but the state of preservation was best in the last phase, where parts of four houses were dis- tinguished. They were arranged in parallel rows sep- arated by narrow alleys. One of the houses contained several small pits and storage vessels, a large rectan- gular pit lined with mudbrick and filled with ash, and a rectangular clay hearth. Under the floor, near the lined pit, was a burial furnished with two obsid- ian cores.57 A stone platform cutting into the house wall recalls the food-processing facilities of house N at Dimini. It is not clear, however, whether this construction was approached from the outside.58 In the previous, second, phase, preservation was poorer, but enough survived to indicate that the orientation of houses was the same and that storage facilities were abundant. The orientation of houses was different in the earliest phase. Parts of two houses were defined, while a wall 1.20 m thick was located on their west side. The excavator interpre- ted this wall as defensive, but its location makes the defensive function again ambiguous; it might well be an internal boundary as at Dimini. Pefkakia is the only site that stratigraphically com- pletes the sequence of Neolithic phases in Thessaly as reconstructed by Milojcid. For this reason it holds a central position in the chronological debate still continuing in northern Greek and Balkan archaeol- ogy.59 The main argument revolves around ceramic wares and their stratigraphical position. In general terms, the pottery from Pefkakia displays elements characteristic of the Aegean FN phase, such as red- slipped wares and crusted wares, "elephant lugs," and 7-9; Adrimi-Sismani 1977 (supra n. 51) 131-34.

Ten uncalibrated '4C dates from the site are tightly clustered between 3820 ? 70 b.c. and 3560 + 65 b.c., and the difference between the six "Dimini" phase dates and the four "Rachmani" ones is very small.6' Clearly then, the LN-FN se- quence at Pefkakia was relatively short and must be placed around the accepted date for the LN-FN boundary near the end of the fifth millennium B.C. The short duration is also confirmed by the mini- mal changes in the layout of the houses from one architectural phase to the next. Furthermore, re- peated episodes of leveling, an expected activity in building on a slope, must have obliterated and dis- turbed a good part of the original deposits. The par- ticularly poor state of preservation of the archi- tectural remains, especially in the lower phases, and the high frequency of pottery from earlier phases in almost all of the excavated deposits support such a claim.62 Despite the series of '4C dates, the excavator pro- posed a much lower date for the "Dimini" and "Rach- mani" levels at Pefkakia, making the last phase syn- chronous with EH I and part of EH II. That dating was based on the presence of a small number of EH II Urfirnis sherds in the upper Rachmani deposits.63 A small amount of black-on-red LN pottery of east- ern Macedonian origin found in the lower Rach- mani levels was thus dated by analogy equally low. This dating has been regarded with much skepticism by archaeologists working in southern as well as in northern Greece.64 It is clear then that the Pefkakia sequence repre- sents only a small fraction of the total assumed time span between the end of the Late Neolithic and the beginning of the Early Bronze Age. Consequently, an exact stratigraphic definition of the "Rachmani" phase is still wanting. This generally holds for all sites reported to have "Rachmani" deposits, where even the stratigraphic succession from the "Dimini" phase is assumed rather than shown.65 On the other hand, it has to be pointed out that the long and convoluted discussion of the comparative chronol- ogy at Pefkakia has overshadowed the significance of the presence of imports, which reveal the long- distance connections of the site, already in the Late Neolithic.66 The Early Bronze Age at Pefkakia was represented by substantial deposits and architectural remains. The extent of the settlement appears to have been larger than during the Neolithic, since EBA deposits have also been found at the base of the mound. The remains were originally described by Milojciid, who reported a defensive wall with a bastion in an early phase, a large apsidal building with a hearth and several episodes of rebuilding, and the so-called "Trojan megaron" in the final phase. Recently, Christ- mann has subdivided the EBA levels into seven build- ing phases. He assigned the circuit wall to phase 3, the reconstructions of the apsidal building to phases 5-7, and the "megaron" to the two subphases of phase 7.67 During the Early Bronze Age Pefkakia maintained its overseas connections, but their scope was now broader, and oriented toward the south and east rather than the north.68 The presence of the solid ?on Pefkakia 1, 16-25, 44; E.

The MBA habitation at Pefkakia is considerably better understood.69 The MBA sequence has been divided into seven phases, preceded by a transitional phase between the Early and Middle Bronze Age.70 From phase 2 onward, the settlement was closely com- pacted, in a pattern that lasted until phase 6. The stone-built oblong houses stood on terraces along the slope of the mound. Internal arrangements var- ied but houses were consistently divided into a num- ber of rooms. Storage facilities in various forms were abundant, and a few industrial installations were also found.71 Buildings were closely packed, leaving little free space. They give the impression of self-contained units, partitioned into separate spaces, often with a discrete function. The repeated occurrence of in- fant burials inside the houses, occasionally marked with stone slabs, may further stress the self- containment of the household. Similarly, the increas- ing importance of hunting during the Bronze Age may also have been part of a strategy to sustain the self-sufficiency of the household through individual or privately negotiated acts.72 In phase 7 a signifi- cant change is observed in the southern part of the mound, where the former habitation area was oc- cupied by cist graves of infants and some adults.73 Material culture began changing already in the earlier MBA levels, but the changes can be seen more clearly after phase 3. The most obvious was the grad- ual adoption of a new type of table ware, Gray Min- yan, and the appearance of several types of matt- painted vessels. Gray Minyan became the dominant fine ware after phase 4. Matt-painted sherds were already present in the transitional phase, but fine and coarse matt-painted pots appeared mainly after phase 5.74 Domestic plain wares relate Pefkakia to the inland sites of the region, such as Argissa. By contrast, special pottery products, such as Gray Min- yan and matt-painted pottery, differentiate the site from the inland regions, particularly during the later Middle Bronze Age. In that period pottery was also coming from central Greece, the northeastern Pel- oponnese, Aegina, the Cyclades, and possibly other areas not easily identifiable.75 A less detailed picture is available for the LBA settlement. Previous research had already shown that the southern terrace of the mound was reinhabited in a period corresponding to the LH III pottery phase. A cemetery with rectangular built tombs was placed at the edge of the magoula, and a substantial building nearby was abandoned in the period corre- sponding to LH IIIA. Recent research has demon- strated that the settlement extended well beyond the mound, acquiring a size of ca. 8 ha.76 Parts of a sub- stantial building with plastered walls, benches, and extensive storage space were found at some distance to the southeast, and parts of a second to the south- west. The building had two phases, the second of which contained late LH IIIB-early LH IIIC pottery. After that period the settlement seems to have been abandoned. '. Pefkakia III.

The excavations at Petro- magoula might be crucial for understanding the FN-EBA sequence in coastal Thessaly. The site lies on the former coastline midway between Pefkakia and Dimini. The stratigraphic sequence presents two main architectural phases with a maximum depth of deposit of 2.80 m down to bedrock. No complete architectural plans were found, but houses with stone socles and a circuit wall are reported. Storage facil- ities were abundant both indoors and outdoors. The finds included a group of copper and lead objects.77 The pottery of Petromagoula displays affinities with the "Rachmani" levels at Pefkakia. It also includes incised pieces (absent from Pefkakia) related to groups dating to the beginning of EH I.78 It is prob- able that the very beginning of the Bronze Age is present at Petromagoula, in contrast to Pefkakia. In that case, Petromagoula may date closer to the end of the Final Neolithic, thus narrowing the gap left by the high 14C dates of Pefkakia. Compared to the Middle Neolithic, intensity of occupation in the wider area of the Volos bay, includ- ing the hills around Sesklo, seems to have increased during the Late and Final Neolithic. Seen in this light, the foundation of Petromagoula would be part of a regional trend, which could also be responsible for the alluviation of the Dimini bay through the anthropogenic erosion of higher ground.79 Kastro/Palia (fig. 1:7). Modern buildings impede the investigation of the impressive tell of Kastro/Palia at the tip of the gulf, near the western edge of mod- ern Volos.80 Several crucial aspects relating to its stratigraphy and history during the Neolithic and Bronze Age remain obscure, and the interpretation of earlier and recent finds, especially in respect to the organizational aspects of the site and its impor- tance in the regional LBA settlement network, is at best equivocal. Over several years the IF' Ephoreia has excavated over a dozen test pits spread over the site mainly as part of rescue operations.' The new excavations confirmed some of Theocharis's claims and chal- lenged others. Up to 2 m thick, the EBA and MBA deposits contained remains of apsidal and rectan- gular houses with stone walls, clay and paved floors, and occasional infant burials.82 During the Middle Bronze Age KastrolPalia participated in the same exchange network as Pefkakia.83 Less substantial were the LBA deposits. Recent excavations were unable to locate further traces of the building designated a "palace" by Theocharis. Various architectural phases were represented in the deposits, dated by pottery of LH IIB-LH IIIB2 styles. Finally, despite several instances of burnt and ashy layers, no destruction horizon has been identified in any LBA phase or between the LBA and Proto- geometric levels.84 It would be an exaggeration to say that the LBA 77 L.

Earlier Mycenaean-style pottery in very small numbers has been reported but not illustrated, and was found together with pottery designated as "Middle Hel- ladic." The characteristics of early LBA assemblages in Thes- saly have not yet been determined with precision. It is gen- erally accepted that MH burnished ware continued and that pre-LH IIB pottery was rare in the area around Volos and absent further inland. Consequently, it is probable that some of the Thessalian deposits generally reported as MH could date to the LBA. On the other hand, the plan, extent, and specific date of occupation during the period of LH IIIC pottery and the transition from LH IIIC to Protogeometric remain undetermined; see Malakasiotou (supra) 53.

The remains display strong hor- izontal and vertical discontinuities and, for that rea- son, assessments of the size and density of LBA oc- cupation would be speculative. In view of the growing evidence from Dimini and Pefkakia, however, LBA Kastro/Palia emerges as a less prominent settlement than previously thought. Rescue excavations over many years in the nearby district of Nea Ionia have unearthed an extensive cemetery, ca. 500 m to the north of the settlement, representing most periods of occupation at Kastro/ Palia.85 Twenty new cists and one pit, with LH IIB and LH IIIA style pottery, have recently been added, found underneath 3.50 m of alluvium.86 The graves held single adult inhumations in a contracted posi- tion and were generally poor in grave goods. The most common finds were Mycenaean alabastra and piriformjars, but a bronze dagger, sealstone, bronze ring, a few beads, and decorated bone pins have also been found. One grave stands out: in addition to pots of fine quality, it contained a type CII sword with an alabaster pommel, and a razor.87 The proximity of the tholos tomb at Kapakli to the settlement has been a crucial component of the argument for the dominance of Kastro/Palia in the Volos area. Avila has restudied the finds and pro- posed a new date in LH IIIA for the main period of use.88 The construction, size, and contents of the tholos exemplify the strong contrasts characterizing Thessalian society during this period. It may be sug- gested that an important medium for the expression of these contrasts was the varied use of the contem- porary Mycenaean material culture by the different segments of the population. Avila contrasts the high craftsmanship of the gold objects with the much lower technological standards displayed by local Mycenaean (LH I-LH IIIA1) pottery.89 These con- trasts may indicate dissimilar modes and levels of adoption of cultural traits from southern Greece by the elite and the rest of the community. At the same time, they may display the different levels of incor- poration of Thessalian society into the Mycenaean cultural system.90 Finally, in recent years the identification of the settlement at Kastro/Palia with Homeric Iolkos has been questioned on archaeological, literary, and to- pographical grounds. The incentive was undoubtedly the discovery of the extensive LBA settlement at Dimini. The presence of three closely spaced and equally large contemporaneous settlements along the coast of Volos poses difficulties for the recog- nition of a regional hierarchical structure on the ba- sis of differences in settlement size. Similarly, the absence of clearly differentiating elements in terms of monumentality, craft specialization, administra- tive features, and burial practices among the three sites impedes unequivocal recognition of a political and administrative center for the area. Therefore, the identification in coastal Thessaly of a state, resem- 11 Summary of research in Batziou-Efstathiou (supra n. 69) 59-60. D. and M.

Two other distinct burial grounds can be related to the settlement. Sixteen LBA cist graves were excavated by Tsountas at the edge of the mound. More LBA cist graves have been found recently in the same area (un- published). For the tholos tomb excavated by Kourouni- otis at Kapakli ca. 500 m to the northwest, see below. 1 A.

An almost identical jug, a cup, and sword were found in another grave excavated by D. and M. Theocharis (supra n. 85) fig. 2. Single burials in a contracted position, primarily in cist graves, seem to be the rule, at least since the third millennium B.C. in Thessaly. For a discussion of EBA and MBA burials in Thessaly, see Hal- stead 1984, ch. 5.2.4-5 and figs. 5.4-5. Presumably the prac- tice continued through the LBA. For LBA single inhuma- tions, see Halstead 1984, ch. 5.2.5, and Feuer 70, where inland examples are discussed. 18 A.J. Avila, "Das Kuppelgrab von Volos-Kapakli," PZ 58 (1983) 15-60. The stylistic affinities of some ornaments leave open the possibility of a longer use of the tomb (Avila 49-56). The 20 burials were arranged in groups, and grave goods were concentrated in four of the burials. The tomb (10 m in diameter) was rich in gold ornaments along with silver objects, glass paste, and ivory. It also contained Myce- naean, red-burnished, and Gray Minyan pottery (presum- ably all of LBA date; Avila 23, 55-56). 89 The differences between local Thessalian Mycenaean and Peloponnesian Mycenaean pottery are seen in the treat- ment of the clay, modeling techniques, surface treatment, decoration, and firing. Avila (supra n. 88) 57 observes that, occasionally, local non-Mycenaean pottery displays a higher technological standard. The differences, therefore, do not stem from technological skills alone, but also from the par- ticular role of pottery in the Thessalian "market," and from economic aspects such as the level of mechanization or the scale of production. One may assume two distinct modes of ceramic production between early LBA Thessaly, on the one hand, and the Argolid, on the other. There is great scope for further work on local non-Mycenaean and Myce- naean patterns of ceramic technology, production, circu- lation, and consumption. ,n Avila (supra n. 88) 57.</page><page sequence="15">1996] THE NEOLITHIC AND BRONZE AGE OF NORTHERN GREECE 551 bling in organizational features the Mycenaean states of central and southern Greece, is problematic.91 Almiros area. An intensive survey has been initi- ated in the area southeast of Almiros, around the Hellenistic city of Halos. Preliminary results confirm the known pattern of prehistoric occupation in the coastal area and further inland around Zerelia Ma- goula (fig. 1:9). A LBA rock-cut chamber tomb at Kato Mavrolofos makes a useful addition to the few other examples in Thessaly. Pottery of LH IIIA2 and LH IIIB was associated with at least six burials. Metal finds were missing but the plundered tomb was fairly rich in glass and carnelian beads, conical and bicon- ical "buttons," and glass and steatite seals.92 Eastern Plain No major excavation has been conducted in the eastern Larisa plain since the intensive activity of the mid-1960s. During the last 20 years, however, the results of these early excavations have gradually ap- peared in an impressive number of volumes present- ing in detail the evidence on which the preliminary synthesis by Miloj'id had been based. Argissa (fig. 1:10). Among the first sites to be ex- cavated by MilojEid in the Larisa area, Argissa Ma- goula is a large tell with an estimated area of 5 ha, the cumulative result of a long history of shifting occupation through the Neolithic and Bronze Age."9 The publication of the excavation was completed in 1981 with the presentation of the MBA levels and the few later finds. Architectural remains of the EBA habitation were very sparse. The only evidence for the earlier part of the period are the three succes- sive ditches that probably marked the western limit of the site, carrying on a Neolithic tradition. The remains of two rectangular post-framed houses with facilities for storing and processing food inside and outside, on top of the earlier ditches, indicate the expansion of habitation during the later part of the period.94 The MBA stratigraphy was divided into seven building phases with a sterile level at the bot- tom of the sequence.95 The two large post-houses of the last EBA phase were succeeded in the next phase by three smaller, elongated ones built with mudbricks. From the second phase onward habitation became dense. Narrow alleys separated the houses, which were usually packed with hearths, bins, and storage facilities. An emphasis on storage inside houses char- acterizes all MBA phases. The plan in the excavated part of the settlement was more or less stable, but the position of the houses shifted laterally from one phase to the next. In the sixth phase the plan be- came very irregular, and houses with different orien- tations covered the excavated area. The last MBA and the following LBA phase were much eroded.96 As at MBA Pefkakia, access to domestic space was restricted, in contrast to the pattern of the last EBA phase, when several domestic activities took place outside. On the other hand, functional partitioning within the house (persistent at Pefkakia) was not ev- ident at Argissa. At the community level, the arrange- ment of spaces in the excavated part appears less complex than at Pefkakia: no indications of terrac- ing or large-scale constructions involving commu- 91 Hourmouziadis 1982 (supra n. 44) 33-35 suggests that Homeric lolkos refers to the area rather than to a partic- ular site. This is supported by the fact that Pefkakia and Dimini were abandoned at the end of the 13th or early 12th century B.C., while Kastro/Palia continued through the Protogeometric period. On the basis of the archae- ological evidence from Dimini and the reinterpretation of literary sources, it has been proposed recently that Di- mini should be identified with Homeric lolkos: Adrimi- Sismani, in Ancient Thessaly (supra n. 48) 277-78; and in Jolkos (supra n. 48) 36-43; B.G.

Whether this variance sim- ply reflects the difference between a site built on a flat surface and one built around a natural knoll, or differences in community organization between a coastal and an inland settlement, remains an open question. Similarly, the precise meaning of the often- mentioned inland/coastal distinction in Bronze Age Thessaly remains obscure. The near absence at Ar- gissa of imports of pottery from southern Greece marks a difference from Pefkakia, and demonstrates the crosscutting, but not overlapping, exchange net- works of the two communities.97 Otzaki (fig. 1:11). The publication of the old ex- cavations at Otzaki Magoula by Milojc id was com- pleted in 1983 with the presentation of the stratig- raphy and the Neolithic architecture. The excavated area of less than 400 m2 represents a very small frac- tion of the total area of the magoula, estimated at 9 ha.98 In the 4 m of MN deposits there were as many as 16 reconstructions of houses, some with further subphases. Throughout the Middle Neolithic the gen- eral layout of the settlement remained stable, despite successive rebuildings of individual houses. The main characteristic of this layout was its compactness and the limited open space, in contrast to sites such as Achilleion or Sesklo A. The rectangular houses, oc- casionally of the "Tsangli" type with internal but- tresses, had a stable plan, with one, and rarely two, rooms. All houses were built of mudbrick, with the exception of the latest MN phase, where lines of post- holes mark a change in the building technique. Posts were also used in the earlier phases for the support of walls and roofs. The information provided for the plans and phases of the buildings is rich, but the function of rooms and of the limited open space between them has not been determined. Storage and food- processing facilities are not mentioned, with the ex- ception of the occasional hearth. Apart from pottery, which was abundant, the number of other finds is astonishingly limited.99 The significance of that pattern is unclear. The rich architectural remains of the MN period contrast strongly with the poor preservation of the LN and FN levels. The bulk of information for these periods came from ditches and pits that had been dug from and through LN levels, where no substan- tial architectural remains were found to support stratigraphic observations.'1~ A number of deep and wide ditches, similar to those found in other sites from the Early Neolithic onward, were also identified and characterized as defensive. The same interpre- tation was given to a strong earthen construction with a wooden-post frame.101 The defensive func- tion, however, is incompatible with at least one of the ditches, which runs through the middle of the settlement, while the course of the others and the character of the earthen construction are inde- terminable. The difficulty of approaching the func- tion of these constructions in a more meaningful way is exacerbated by the absence of information on their contents, except for pottery. 02 Ayia Sophia (fig. 1:13).

Few Gray Minyan and even fewer matt-painted sherds were found at Argissa, which does not necessarily indicate a lack of long-distance contacts. Indeed, contacts may have existed with areas to the north and west. At the moment, however, it is not easy to distinguish these ex- changes, not least because of our poor knowledge of MBA communities further north and west; see Hanschmann (supra n. 95) 109-16; Pefkakia III, 231-35, 285-89. 9' V.

The pottery is divided into monochrome, incised, painted red- on-white, and scraped wares, but the frequencies of wares, types, and motifs are not recorded. There are notable differ- ences in the pottery repertoire from the coastal area, both in shapes and motifs. 111 Military trenches dug during the Balkan wars of 1912 have significantly affected the shape of the mound: Mil- ojEic, Otzaki III (supra n. 98) 7. Miloj'ic, on the basis of the stratigraphy of the pits, assigned the black-burnished "Larisa" ware to FN, but evidence from Platia Magoula Zarkou and other sources, discussed below, has since shown this assignment to be erroneous. Similarly, much of the ceramic material that defines the "Otzaki A-C" and "Rach- mani" phases does not come from closed contexts but from pits and ditches: H. Hauptmann, Die deutschen Ausgrabun- gen auf der Otzaki-Magula in Thessalien III (BAM 21, Bonn 1981) 42, 66, 134. K.I. Gallis, "Results of Recent Excavations and Topographical Work in Neolithic Thessaly," in La Thes- salie A, 58, strongly doubts the validity of the Otzaki scheme.

It is a low and extended mound, rising only 3 m above the plain and covering 2 ha.~ ' The brief excavation explored an area of 400 m2 in the center, where many pits had been sunk. The stratigraphical observations on these pits allowed Milojc'id to define the sequence succeeding the LN "Otzaki" phase. Deposits of ear- lier LN phases were also found but have not yet been published. An important LN feature was uncovered. A plat- form constructed of mudbricks, with three consec- utive phases, occupied a central part of the site. It was connected to the lower parts of the mound. On top of the platform the porch of a building, inter- preted as a "megaron," was uncovered. Two mudbrick walls formed a sort of gateway to the east. The ar- rangement recalls the central court at Dimini, which also stood higher than the surrounding courtyards and was connected to them by gateways. The platform area at Ayia Sophia was separated during the final LN by a ditch, possibly surrounding the central part. The significance of the terraced area is highlighted by its proximity to a unique feature with a possibly ritual significance. Immediately to the east, an ear- lier artificial mound, with a clay platform on its top, covered three successive small rectangular structures of mudbrick, associated with two burials. The struc- tures were filled with fine compact earth, mixed with a few fragments of human and animal bone. The surface of the artificial mound was burnt hard, and a circular pit with a clay rim was constructed at the top. The pit was filled with ashes.1'4 The association of a probable megaron with a fea- ture related to the ritual treatment of the dead is not a common characteristic of Neolithic Greece, and it is not, therefore, easy to decipher. Halstead argued that the mound represented a"revered minor- ity burial" and that its association with the megaron reinforces the evidence available from other sites for the emergence of an institutionalized elite dur- ing the LN period."15 Alternatively, the association of the megaron with a place of mortuary ritual could imply a form of symbolic control over the dead by a certain privileged group, materialized in this re- vered spot. The find only permits a glance into rit- ual in Neolithic communities, an area little under- stood, yet with a potentially significant role. Soufli Magoula (fig. 1:14). A group of EN crema- tions was found at Soufli Magoula and published by K.I. Gallis of the IE' Ephoreia.'16 The cemetery was found (accidentally) at the perimeter of the ma- goula, where in 1958 Biesantz had excavated a small group of LN cremations in urns. The new finds con- sisted of 15 concentrations of human bones, ceramic vessels and sherds, animal bones, and traces of fire. In almost all cases a miniature bowl was found with the cremation, and one cremation was accompanied by a stone ax. The burials had been made in shallow, irregular depressions, dug into the levels of the early settlement. Two deeper round pits approximately 1 m in diameter, constructed with care, were inter- preted as incinerators. They contained ashes, hu- man and animal bone, and some sherds but no com- plete vessels. The reconstruction of the burial procedure in its details is not possible from the available information. Selection of particular parts of the skeleton for buri- al, mainly the skull and the limbs,"07 is evident. More meaningful perhaps is the presence of the buri- als in the habitation area of the settlement, the de- posits of which covered the cemetery soon after. Velestino (fig. 1:17). The area ofVelestino (ancient Ferai) is one of the few naturally watered spots in the arid southern part of the eastern plain. The area was densely inhabited since the Early Neolithic, with the population living in dispersed settlements.,08 These settlements were abandoned by the Early Bronze Age, with the exception of a huge tell, known as Magoula Bakali, in the vicinity of the Hyperia spring. Excavations at the foot of the tell uncovered remains of an extended MBA settlement and ceme- '10: MilojEic (supra n. 40) 1-14; Atlas no. 42. The site is reported to have EBA and MBA phases.

During the Late Bronze Age, habitation spread further east and north, over an area of almost 25 ha. The MBA cemetery of cist and pit graves was suc- ceeded by a LBA cemetery of small cist graves with contracted burials accompanied by few grave goods. A potter's kiln, where LH IIIC pots were fired, was excavated at the periphery of the settlement.1'9 The settlement pattern in the area of Velestino is an example of the aggregation of smaller Neolithic communities into larger, long-lasting Bronze Age set- tlements. This pattern, common in inland Thes- saly,l"l is very different from that observed in the coastal areas, where settlement was more stable, and communities may have continued their autonomous existence until the end of the 13th century. The eastern Thessalian plain has also been the focus of significant palaeoenvironmental research. Demitrack has studied alluviation cycles on the plain and the possible impact of human settlement on the landscape. Her studies indicate the existence of a series of alluvial fans at the edges of the plain and a series of Peneios alluvia, dated to the Pleistocene and Holocene. The middle Holocene episode of alluviation (the Girtoni alluvium) has been dated to 7000-6000 B.P. and has been tentatively related to the activity of farmers in the Middle and Late Neolithic."' An extensive survey program has been undertaken in the eastern plain during the last 20 years by the IE' Ephoreia (Larisa)."2 One hundred and three new sites have been added to those previously known, raising the total of prehistoric sites in eastern Thes- saly to 255. Most of the additions are low mounds or are located in hilly areas. The pattern that emerges shows an initial slight preference for habitation in the plains rather than the hilly areas, followed by an expansion to the open plains in the Late Neolithic, and recolonization of the hills and uplands in the Late Bronze Age. A marked increase was noted in the number of settlements in the LN period and a sharp decline during the Middle and Late Bronze Age. The FN period presents the sharpest drop in the number of sites, which, in view of the length of the period, is difficult to explain."" The general trends accord well with the data from the whole of Thessaly presented by Halstead, with the exception of the coastal area, where settlement was more stable. 14 Site dimensions as reported by Gallis are system- atically larger than those used by Halstead, and the discrepancy affects estimates of population size and the perception of social structure."5 The incompat- ibility of the two data sets stems from the employ- ment of different measuring techniques, none of which, however, complies with the requirements of modern survey work."6 A more accurate estimate of size would require intensive, systematic sampling of Thessalian sites. Western Plain The western plain of Thessaly displays a lower con- centration of settlement in the prehistoric period with the exception of the hilly area near Farsala. This sparseness of habitation is usually attributed to un- welcoming physiographical characteristics and also to the low intensity of archaeological work. Apart "0 A.

The initial objective of the excavation at Achilleion (1973-1974) was the explo- ration of the "preceramic" phase that Theocharis had reported from the site."" A "preceramic" horizon was absent from the excavated area, however, and the cultural sequence at the site was divided into four main phases, covering without interruption most of the Early and Middle Neolithic. A long series of '4C dates placed that sequence in the period 6500-5500 B.C.119 Traces of plastered floors and large pits were de- scribed by the excavators as houses and/or storage areas in the first phase. Rectangular houses (some built with pise on stone socles, others around a frame of posts) appeared in succeeding phases. The gen- eral impression is one of a loose spatial arrange- ment. The area around the houses was littered with hearths, and ovens or food-processing facilities, and it seems probable that the greater part of everyday work took place outdoors; few traces of activity were found inside the houses. The architectural evidence does not, however, permit firm conclusions. During phase IVa, dated to the advanced Middle Neolithic, a deep ditch probably segregated the central part of the settlement.120 The continuous sequence of pottery at Achilleion permits the understanding of regional ceramic vari- ation, an aspect often underestimated and inter- preted in chronological terms. Contrary to the pat- tern at other sites, early painted ware continues at Achilleion up to the Middle Neolithic. Also, the absence of MN scraped ware (A3E, A3,) from the Achilleion deposits contrasts with the dominance of this ware in the Larisa area during the same period.2' With the exception of obsidian, little evi- dence is available concerning the contacts between Achilleion and other regions. According to Elster, the obsidian tools were not manufactured at the site, in contrast to tools made of other stones.'22 Platia Magoula Zarkou (fig. 1:19). Founded on Pleistocene alluvium near the Peneios River, the tell of Platia Magoula Zarkou is today only 6-7 m high. Another 5 m of deposits lie below the present sur- face of the plain, providing a measure of alluviation in the area since the foundation of the site. Recent geomorphological work has established the chronol- ogy and sequence of alluviation and has shown that the size of the tell did not exceed 2 ha.123 The excavation investigated 10.5 m of deposits in one trench of 8 x 5 m in the center of the mound. Deposition began in the EN III phase and continued through the Middle and the early Late Neolithic, forming a mound ca. 5 m high. The site was reoc- cupied in the Early and Middle Bronze Age. The tran- sition from the Middle to the Late Neolithic is 117 Study of the material from the excavation at Prodro- mos continued: P.

Only the central area of the tell appears to have preserved intact cultural deposits, which may mean that the Neolithic settlement was significantly smaller than the area occu- pied by the tell today.

Black-burnished pottery constitutes a long-recognized horizon of the Late Neolithic of Thessaly, with connections to areas to the north and south, but a particular variety of fine pots with white paint or plastic decoration had been distinguished by MilojEid and Hauptmann and placed in the Final Neolithic, immediately after the phase of "classical Dimini," on grounds of indirect stratigraphic evidence. Such an attribution was met with reservations by many, who proposed an earlier LN date for this pottery. The excavations at Platia Magoula Zarkou offered the necessary stratigraphic confirmation for dating "Larisa" ware to the begin- ning of the Late Neolithic.'25 Although the place of "Larisa" ware in the Thes- salian cultural sequence may now be fixed near the beginning of the Late Neolithic, the chronological distribution of the broader class of LN black-bur- nished wares is still obscure in its details. Their as- sumed absence from later LN levels cannot be in- ferred from Platia Magoula or Makryhori 2, where only part of the LN sequence is represented.126 On the other hand, the regional variability of Neolithic pottery is still very little understood in Thessaly, and it is arguable that many of the differences observed are regional rather than chronological."27 Labora- tory analysis of wares characteristic of the transition from the Middle to Late Neolithic has indicated var- ious patterns of ceramic production and distribu- tion. The Gray-on-Gray ware was probably produced in a few places, while the black-burnished wares had a less centralized production pattern. Such differ- ences introduce an obvious element of variability in the distribution of wares that normally form the basis of the definition of phases in the Thessalian Neolithic.'28 Information about the community of Platia Ma- goula comes from its cemetery, a few hundred me- ters to the north.29 More than 60 cremations in pots of common domestic types were found in shallow pits. A stone wall of the same period possibly delim- ited the area. Occasionally, the urns were covered with an inverted vessel and/or were accompanied by another. A number of flint tools, some with traces of use or of fire, were also found. Red-fired sherds, in groups or singly, were found near, over, or inside many of the undecorated urns, as well as scattered throughout the cemetery, but figurines were conspic- uously rare. Some parts of the body, such as the skull and limbs, were consistently selected for inclusion in the urns, which occasionally contained bones of different individuals.130 The cemeteries at Platia Magoula and Soufli Ma- goula are the only known cases of organized burial grounds in Neolithic Thessaly.

The Soufli cemetery is adjacent to the settlement, and the pits with the cre- mations were dug in habitation deposits, while the Platia Magoula cemetery is set some distance from the settlement, and perhaps defined by a wall. One could hypothesize that the practice of segregating a part of the living space of the settlement, observed in the Middle and Late Neolithic, is repeated here at the symbolic level. A further step would be to sug- gest that LN groups had a pronounced perception of social order, which could be a reflection of an emerging stratified social structure. There are hints for such a development from LN contexts but, to a great extent, the issue remains open. Geomorphological work at the site of Platia Ma- goula indicates that the first settlement was estab- lished in the active floodplain of the Peneios River. During the Early and Middle Neolithic, flooding re- sulted in the formation of a deep alluvium (the Girtoni alluvium), which covered the surroundings of the site.':31 Alluviation had ceased before the foundation of the cemetery. According to van Andel et al., that sequence of events has interesting impli- cations for the adaptation of early farmers to their environment. The foundation of sites in an active floodplain suggests a farming practice that takes ad- vantage of periodic flooding and benefits from crops sown in the spring, and may also imply seasonal oc- cupation of the site. This conclusion is in contrast to the prevailing opinion that early farming in Thes- saly was geared toward farming on light arable soils fed by rain and based on winter-sown crops.132 The observations about Platia Magoula and their impli- cations have been projected to other Thessalian sites with a similar setting. 133 This model of early farming rests on the assump- tion that flooding occurred with a predictable reg- ularity and that agriculture was based on spring-sown crops. At present the stratigraphic evidence from other Thessalian sites is not detailed enough to sup- port the identification of periodic flooding. More- over, archaeobotanical evidence from EN sites is very limited, particularly regarding the weed component, a sensitive indicator of environmental conditions.134 Another question for future research is the appli- cability of this model to other Neolithic sites. Theopetra Cave (fig. 1:21). At the western edge of the plain, Theopetra Cave has been excavated by the Greek Archaeological Service since 1987. The cave has a long history of occupation starting in the Mid- dle Palaeolithic. The Neolithic deposits were to a great extent disturbed, but ceramic evidence suggests occupation in all periods of the Neolithic. A series of 25 14C dates has been published, covering the period from 40,000 b.c. to 4450-4249 B.C.135 The potential importance of Theopetra Cave for Neolithic research lies in its long habitation from the Palaeolithic to the Neolithic, challenging the pre- vailing opinion that Thessaly was uninhabited for a long period before the EN.136 The dates from the cave form a broadly continuous sequence covering the crucial period from 9000 B.C. to 6500 B.C. There is a hiatus between 6500 B.C. and 5200 B.C., but, ac- cording to the preliminary reports, archaeological material fills that hiatus. On the other hand, the sedentary or transient character of the Theopetra settlement is debatable, and the relation of the site to the potentially more stable open settlements of the plains remains unclear. Until the evidence from Theopetra is published, no firm conclusions can be drawn.

Al- though these weaknesses had been pointed out quite early,'13 it has been only gradually realized that the stratigraphic evidence that supports the definition of phases on the basis of pottery types may not al- ways be secure. It has also been realized that the vari- ability of pottery, both within sites and across regions, cannot be interpreted in exclusively chronological terms. As a rule, excavations have been limited in extent, and do not permit evaluation of the various aspects of variability of the Thessalian assemblages. Finally, the scarcity of 14C dates supporting the scheme limits its applicability considerably. The difficulties are exacerbated in the case of the Final Neolithic and the transition to the Early Bronze Age, where the very long time span defined by 14C dates from surrounding areas is not compatible with the sparse archaeological remains from Thessaly. Sim- ilar problems, to a lesser extent, apply to the chrono- logical sequence of the Bronze Age. Here, the difficul- ties are clearly seen at the outset and the close of the Late Bronze Age. Although the number of excavated sites in Thessaly is considerable, there is need for new extensive excavations with secure architectural remains and closed deposits. Another weakness of chronological resolution in the Thessalian sequences arises from the processes of site formation, especially in mounds. Milojc'ii had perceptively observed the variability in the intraset- tlement pattern and the shifts of habitation at sites such as Otzaki and Argissa, or the complexities of the formation processes at Ayia Sophia.'39 The inter- pretation, however, of the archaeological levels in terms of the reconstructed chronological phases needs still to be evaluated against the possible dis- tortion caused by formation processes. It is worth noting in this respect that in the Bronze Age se- quences of Argissa and Pefkakia, where the defini- tion was based on architectural phases, the problems were minimized. Understanding the processes of site formation is necessary for reconstructing intrasettlement spatial organization and arriving at demographic estimates. The case of Sesklo shows that there are diverging patterns of intrasettlement organization that need not have a temporal meaning. Bounded sites in the form of mounds seem to be the rule during the Neo- lithic, and are possibly related to specific patterns of social behavior and economic practice. Neverthe- less, unrestricted, extended sites in the form of Sesklo B may also exist in numbers. Surface material from Thessalian sites has been collected primarily for use in dating, but also to some extent for determining intersettlement regional and temporal patterns. In evaluating the changes in size of settlements, there is no doubt that surface collection data are con- strained by serious weaknesses, related to collection strategies and geomorphological and other postde- positional distortions. Despite the restrictions, a pat- tern seems to emerge, indicating a gradual shift from dispersed settlements in the Neolithic to nucleated, larger ones during the Bronze Age, especially in the Middle Bronze Age and the Late Bronze Age. Evi- dence from excavations also suggests a trend toward nucleation in the Bronze Age. Some nucleated sites are very large and exhibit new characteristics in the spatial arrangement of habitation.140 The farming economy of prehistoric Thessaly has been described by Halstead.'41 During the initial stages of the Neolithic, the small-scale economy re- lied on reciprocity and networks of obligations and alliances to cope with environmental uncertainties and the limitations of Neolithic production. A di- versified agriculture based on a wide variety of do- mesticates and on breeding a range of livestock was a primary constituent of Neolithic subsistence. Di- versification seems to be further stressed during the later Neolithic and the Bronze Age, and the scale 137 V.

It retained, nevertheless, its unspecialized character. Colonization of more marginal lands and amplification of animal husband- ry in the final stages of the Neolithic and particu- larly during the Bronze Age are now discernible. Pal- ynological evidence from Thessaly and elsewhere shows a change in the upland vegetation that could be related to forest degradation through intensive grazing.142 The Neolithic economic regime, based on reci- procity and social obligations, would have placed a heavy emphasis on the social organization of pro- duction. Throughout the period the social charac- ter of consumption and storage must have been stressed in various ways. Although the evidence for ritual or symbolic behavior is minimal in Thessaly, some form of ideological coercion stressing sharing between members of the community must be as- sumed. The decorated, open ceramic shapes, suit- able for display of food consumption, and the pres- ence of facilities for cooking and storage in open, public areas, at least in the Early and Middle Neo- lithic, are probable indications of an idealized economic reality.'14 The unequal distribution of painted pottery among households at Sesklo or its greater frequency in pits at Achilleion may attest to its ideological function. During the Early and Mid- dle Bronze Age the eclipse of painted pottery was accompanied by a turn to a more private and self- contained household, with storage areas being in- creasingly moved inside the house. Storage vessels were common among the few painted pots of the Middle Bronze Age, probably stressing further the importance of private surplus. The obligation for social sharing and the need for storage and diverse productive activities can create a social context for conflict and dissent among members of a community. The house models and the often "personalized" human figurines may rep- resent, among other things, an emphasis on the pro- ductive unit and its members. 44 The rise of social elites could be precisely an expression or even a res- olution of a long-term conflict between communal appropriation through sharing and production on the household level. On the other hand, the archae- ological traces of these social hierarchies are ad- mittedly faint prior to the Late Bronze Age in Thes- saly. In tracing social hierarchy in Thessaly, we should expect not a cumulative evolutionary continuum but rather a process, marked with breaks and even re- gressions. Breaks in the cultural sequence, such as the "Rachmani" FN phase or the early part of the Early Bronze Age (fourth millennium B.C.), provided they are not simply gaps in archaeological evidence, should caution against a simplifying evolutionary reconstruction. Nor is it easy to observe in LBA Thes- saly a complex sociopolitical formation as the cul- mination of an evolutionary process. The recent evidence from excavations in the coastal area has shown the difficulties in recogniz- ing the formation of a state during the Late Bronze Age. Despite the fact that the material culture of the area shows close affinities with that of central and southern Greece, the hierarchy of sites, a typical char- acteristic of southern Greek state organization, is here expressed in a random distribution, which dis- plays little patterning in terms of size and location of sites.145 The impression is one of small-scale pol- ities. The appropriation of Mycenaean cultural traits, such as those observed in Thessaly, does not by ne- cessity imply the adoption of the Mycenaean polit- ical and economic organization prevalent in some southern areas. What must be investigated is the par- ticular political and ideological use of these traits, within and in opposition to a tradition of local po- litical structures.146 Another aspect of Neolithic and Bronze Age econ- omy is craft production, generally assumed, at least during the Neolithic, to have been primarily a house- hold activity. This perception of an idealized, sim- ple Neolithic self-sufficiency is gradually changing, as a result of more extensive research and a deeper understanding of the complexities involved.

Perles has shown that obsidian tools were man- ufactured by specialized knappers, probably itiner- ant; and chemical analysis has indicated the circu- lation of specific classes of pottery among sites and the production of ceramics in special centers, oc- casionally concentrated in small areas, as in the case of LN Gray-on-Gray ware.147 We still have a very limited understanding, however, of broader as- pects of Neolithic society, such as social boundaries and disruptions, mobility and sedentism, inequal- ity and gender, and conflict within and between communities.148 Very little work has been done on the modes of production and exchange in Bronze Age Thessaly. Non-systematic, macroscopic observations leave no doubt that pottery was exchanged between Thessa- lian sites and distant regions during the Early and Middle Bronze Age. For the Late Bronze Age there are indications from several sources- chemical analy- sis, pottery kilns, and macroscopic ceramic analysis- of different conditions and centers of pottery pro- duction, and the exchange of pottery between sites and with regions outside Thessaly. The picture, how- ever, is still tentative."14 NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF RESEARCH IN MACEDONIA Already in the early 20th century, Macedonia came to occupy a peculiar place in the consciousness of prehistorians. It was discussed in terms of what it had not been as often as in terms of what it was, in terms of deficiency as much as in terms of impor- tance. It was considered, for example, a key province for the study of European prehistory, but also (espe- cially its western part) a backward area in itself, with "a native tendency to isolation."'15 It was claimed to be the ancestral Bronze Age homeland of the leg- endary Dorians,'15 yet, as everyone knew, only upon leaving that home did the Dorians shed their prim- itive habits and achieve distinction. Examples are too many indeed. Macedonia was construed as a pas- sage, or a highway, between lands of obvious impor- tance, Europe and Old Greece or Anatolia,'52 and archaeologists from Rey to Rodden would invoke that condition as a justification for excavating in Mac- edonia.153 As early as 1902, Schmidt had concluded, from a collection of potsherds in Berlin, that the province's connections were with the "northern hin- terland" (i.e., central Europe).'54 Heurtley wrote his monumental book in hopes of "removing that im- pression ... the slogan 'Macedonia goes with the North'," and compensating for "the tacit omission of Macedonia from books dealing with the prehistory of the Aegean";'55 the land west of the Struma (Strymon) belongs primarily with the Aegean, he argued, at a time when few could pay attention. Other researchers, including S. Casson, would make it clear that Macedonia was European - not Mediterranean - by nature; they sought and found the province's north- ern character, not in its latitude vis-a-vis "mainland 147 For craft production and specialization, see C.

The vision of Macedonia's Otherness took form in the context of late 19th- and early 20th-century quests for identities, for nations, races, and their or- igins, and was directed by the geopolitical concerns of the time.'57 We still live with the consequences,"15 however, and that fact cannot be accounted for in the present review. The most recent textbook on the Bronze Age in the Aegean, for example, once more largely omits discussion of "the northernmost parts of modern Greece" (and other circum-Aegean areas), since, "although demonstrably in contact with the Aegean cultures, [those parts] have an essentially different history."''5 That may well be so; but unless the boundary between "the Aegean cultures" and the north becomes the object of intensive investigation, and its problematical nature is fully documented, to speak of essentially different histories for the Aegean and the north can only have one effect, however unin- tended: it continues to reify Identity- in this case cultural - as a stable, homogeneous, inalienable es- sence, always the same. Did not, for example, the "con- tact" have any material consequences for "the Aegean cultures"? In the era of world system approaches, with their emphasis on interaction among centers, pe- ripheries, and margins (to mention but one set of notions that has become available recently to pre- historians),'16 a "given," stable cultural identity for "the Aegean" is a notion that needs considerable jus- tification. In the end, Macedonia in prehistory can be considered a part of "the Aegean" or "Europe" only as long as the last two constructs continue to evade our analyses. Questions of cultural origins had been prevalent in Heurtley's book,161 "and the sections on racial contacts form[ed] a brilliant climax to the whole."162 Invasions as well as local developments were invoked as explanations of change in "wares" and figurine types. But the work offered much more than this, and it wasjustifiably called "a scientific record of last- ing value."'163 A ceramic cultural sequence was estab- lished, even an absolute chronology; while the latter was short by ca. 2,000 years, the former was remark- ably close to the one that we rely on today for dating unstratified materials. Time was measured in thick- ness of deposits (in half-meters). Moreover, as the excavations were dispersed over a very wide area, from the Florina basin to the coast of Chalkidiki, regional differences were emerging.164 The departure of Heurtley's team from Macedonia in 1931 was followed by a 30-year period during which a minimum of fieldwork was carried out at prehis- toric sites. When the joint Cambridge-Harvard ex- cavations at Nea Nikomedeia began in 1961, the pre- history of the province was once more a "lacuna to fill,"'65 since much fieldwork had in the meantime been conducted in every area with which Macedonia was thought to be connected, from Anatolia to Hun- gary to Thessaly. The new project was also conceived with a view to Macedonia's key location - this time, however, in the context of the "spread" of Neolithic farming. Diffusion and ethnogenesis were no longer the leading concerns of mainstream European pre- history.166 The project, staffed with people from de- partments of anthropology, comparative zoology, for- estry, and the like,167 brought to Greece "in one piece" a radically different set of questions and ethos of practice, a "scientific humanism" that had devel- 15'6 Casson (supra n. 150) 1-5. 157 The issue is treated in detail in M.

But the ex- citement was short-lived for many reasons, includ- ing the realization that, in regard to the spread of Neolithic farming, the conventional geographical boundary between western Asia and eastern Europe (the Hellespont-Bosporus strait) was "irrelevant and even misleading.""'7 Still, the project at Nea Niko- medeia marked the beginning of the modern phase of prehistoric research in Macedonia and beyond. It was followed by excavations at several sites, in- cluding the important one at Sitagroi, and, in the, 1980s, by the projects described individually in this review. The first chair of prehistory at the University of Thessaloniki was created in 1964, and was occupied by N. Platon, whose area of fieldwork was Minoan Crete.'72 Only under his successors, D.R. Theocharis and G.H. Hourmouziadis after the mid-1970s, were courses in the prehistory of northern Greece offered as regular parts of the curriculum, and prehistoric research undertaken by the University in that area. Dissertations by students on northern Greek topics are now proliferating. Equally important, a few zeal- ous women and men, with a declared interest in pre- history, have in recent decades joined the ranks of the ephoreias in Macedonia. The present review owes much to their field efforts. WESTERN MACEDONIA Environmental Change During the first half of the Holocene, temperatures continued to rise in western Macedonia (west of the Axios River; fig. 2), and in the fifth millennium B.C. summers in the uplands may have been warmer than today by up to 40 C. 73 Cooler, more humid condi- tions, approximating those of the present, became progressively prevalent in the last two millennia of prehistory, especially after 2500 B.C. The effects of the extensive Neolithic habitation are hardly con- spicuous in the region's palynological record.174 A decrease of forest, in particular, is not in evidence until "about 3100-3300 B.P." (uncalibrated).'75 What- ever the exact chronology and scale of that de- crease,176 it seems to have affected the conifers; oak and, at 1,200-1,500 masl, beech continued to regen- erate through much of the historical period. None- theless, the episode may have initiated a cycle of slope erosion and deposition of coarse sediments along the peripheries of valleys: a change to more frequent torrential discharge in streams is suggested by the appearance of the plane tree in the pollen record."77 As a further result, surface outlets in some basins may have been blocked, and marshes may thus have formed or expanded, for example, in Kitrini Limni." 78At the same time, the walnut and, in the lowlands, the olive were introduced as cultivated trees. 168 See M. Fotiadis, "Modernity and the Past-Still-Present: Politics of Time in the Birth of Regional Archaeological Projects in Greece," AJA 99 (1995) 59-78, with further references. 169 For a summary see, e.g., R.J.

The vegetational and other changes it suggests are thought to be largely anthropogenic.179 Assuming that the chronology is not in error by several hundred years, the changes occurred during the Late Bronze Age. Archaeolog- ically, the period remains poorly known. Even so, an increase of population at a scale that would jus- tify forest clearings can be precluded. It is more likely that clearings would result from new ways of exploit- ing the land's resources. Lumbering has been sug- gested,1'8 and large flocks, requiring summer pas- tures and, hence, vertical transhumance, also are a possibility.'8' In either of these cases, the uplands (1,000-1,500 masl) should be affected most, and, in that respect, the pollen record may offer a clue: de- cline was noted among the conifers, which must have occupied the higher elevations, rather than in the oak forest. A further, tantalizing possibility suggests itself: in view of the region's archaeological record for the period 1500-1100 B.C., it is virtually impos- sible to explain either large, transhumant flocks or systematic lumbering; simply, there could not be enough consumers for the products within the re- gion. Should we speculate, then, that the products (e.g., ship lumber, wool) were destined for an inter- regional trade network? Would that also mean that western Macedonia was drawn, as "margin,"182 into the world system of the eastern Mediterranean Late Bronze Age? These are questions, however, not con- clusions, all the more so since the region's archae- ological record would at this time suggest negative, rather than affirmative, answers. Sea level change is a complicated matter, and studies that purport to reconstruct prehistoric shore- lines on the basis of sea level curves derived from broad areas offer no reliable guides.'83 In zones of high seismicity, and of extensive deltaic prograda- tion, such as the Gulf of Thessaloniki,'84 strictly lo- cal geological data are essential before the coastal environment can be reconstructed. For the time be- ing, only one recent study fulfills that requirement, covering a small area, the "Gulf of Kastanas7' for the last ca. 4,000 years.'is5 Material Sequence and Archaeological Phases For the Neolithic, the material sequence of west- ern Macedonia today rests firmly on stratified, cor- relatable deposits at several of the province's sites. In addition to Nea Nikomedeia, four sites have yielded 14C dates-Servia and Servia V (Varyti- mides) in the Aliakmon valley,'6" Megalo Nisi Gala- nis in Kitrini Limni,'87 and Mandalo in the Yannitsa 179 For a possible change in the pattern of rainfall, con- current with the anthropogenic changes, see esp.

Problematical periods are the Early and Final Neolithic- the first, because we lack secure 14C dates (and deposits) from its begin- ning, the second, because none of the excavated de- posits can be confidently assigned to the fourth mil- lennium B.C. The sequence for the sixth and fifth millennia B.C. is more comparable to that of Thes- saly than to that of eastern Macedonia,'89 which has prompted many researchers in recent publications to treat western Macedonia in the Neolithic as a prov- ince of Thessaly. This practice should be avoided. To call the Late Neolithic of the region "Late Di- mini," for example, or to consider "Larisa wares" typ- ical of LN sites in western Macedonia can only lead to confusion, especially since the applicability of such terms to Thessaly itself as a whole is far from self- evident.l'9() For the Bronze Age, one has still to rely on poorly correlated stratigraphies from sites across a very wide area, stretching from Thessaly to the Troad. That is so, despite 14C dates from Servia, Mandalo, and, now, from Arhondiko near Yannitsa (fig. 2:6, 12, 14).11 The two EBA phases at Servia are ceramically distinct, but their chronological ranges remain ob- scure.1'- Mandalo covers a large part of the third millennium; when the study of the contexts and their stratigraphic order progresses, certain questions of material sequence may find answers. Arhondiko may in the future help us to distinguish another phase in the sequence, a "Middle" Bronze Age perhaps, around 2000 B.C. Mycenaean (LH IIIB and IIIC) fab- rics appear at many sites, but their full contexts, where they exist, have yet to be studied and published. In short, knowledge of the Bronze Age material se- quence in western Macedonia remains fragmentary, and one often resorts to annoyingly vague designa- tions of time for particular archaeological contexts. The designation "later Bronze Age" is occasionally used in this review for contexts that, we think, should be dated in the range 2200-1100 B.C., but for which we may not be more specific. Recent Projects Middle Aliakmon valley: riverine zone. The land- scape along the middle course of the Aliakmon changed dramatically in the mid-1970s with the dam- ming of the river. A strip 30 km long and up to 3 km wide was flooded before the land was systematically surveyed. The site of Servia (fig. 2:6)- known since 1911, excavated in 1930 and again from 1971 to 1973-- now lies under many meters of water, as does the nearby EN site Servia V, excavated in 1972- 1973.193 Of the sites that had been known in the area before the 1970s, some escaped inundation (e.g., Vasilara,194 fig. 2:8), but the entire valley floor, in- cluding the terrace on which the Neolithic settle- ment of Servia was established,'95 is lost to archaeol- ogy. Recent surveys by the IZ' Ephoreia indicate the magnitude of the loss. Surveying along the shore of the newly formed lake, in parts of the terraces that are seasonally exposed, A.

Hondroyanni-Metoki (infra n. 196) 109-10. The site was first inhabited in the Late Neolithic, and continued to be occupied through the Bronze Age. 195 Settlement at Servia was established on a surface of yellowish silt, probably of lacustrine origin, which was found topped with a (fossil) soil profile. That surface, at ca. 260 masl and 17 m above the braided river channel at the time of excavation, appears to have been safe from floods since the Early Neolithic: I.A.

New foundations were laid in every archaeological phase, down to the later Bronze Age. The Bronze Age chronology of those sites is, for reasons outlined above, much less firm than their Neolithic chronol- ogy. Mycenaean sherds indicate activity at some sites toward the close of the Bronze Age,198 but they do not, by themselves, guarantee extensive habitation, as the example of Servia demonstrates.199 When the chronological problem and the loss of the entire lower terrace are taken into account, little can still be said about the settlement pattern. Most clearly, the site of Servia no longer appears as a lonely outpost. The riverine zone of the middle Aliakmon has been extensively settled since the Early Neolithic - at least since an advanced phase of that period.20? Site numbers increased in the course of the Neolithic. In the Late Neolithic, a small cave, within a few hundred meters of Servia, came into use.201 Five of the recently found sites were inhab- ited during some part of the Final Neolithic,202 two of them located less than 1.5 km from Servia. The well-documented LN abandonment at Servia does not represent a region-wide event. A literal interpre- tation of the chronological evidence from the two neighboring sites would in fact suggest that they were settled as Servia was abandoned, which may also be the case for Vasilara (5 km downstream).203 Equally noteworthy, the two sites show no evidence of hab- itation in the Early Bronze Age, when Servia was re- occupied. At that time, the top of a towering hill across the river from Servia (Neraida, 150 m above the valley floor, fig. 2:7) was also inhabited.204 Settle- ments could be located at short distances from one another: around Servia, distances between archae- ologically contemporary sites are in the order of 0.5-1 km.205 Site abandonments are as much in evi- dence as site occupations - an observation that, with- out geomorphological and further archaeological data from the lost valley floor, will remain uninter- pretable. Finally, the concentration of sites of all peri- ods in the vicinity of the Servia bridge -nine con- firmed sites within an area ca. 4 km2- perhaps in- dicates more than a preference for settlement in land of superior agricultural potential; it may also sug- gest that a trail between Thessaly and Macedonia, well traveled in the historical period,206 was firm geographical knowledge in prehistory as well. In 1993, a lowering of the lake exposed an orderly cemetery of pithos burials and cists. Forty-one graves in an area 0.3 ha in size were promptly excavated. Preliminary analysis of the goods deposited with the dead shows a date "in the advanced phases of the Early Bronze Age."207 Middle Aliakmon valley: terraces and Aiani. The area north of the Aliakmon is a terrace of Tertiary sediments with outcrops of limestone. It rises from 250 masl near the river to 650 masl near Kozani, and is flanked on the west, north, and east by mountains (1,300-1,850 masl). The largest part of that extensive surface (ca. 220 km2) has never been systematically surveyed, yet several sites are known. Some are lo- cated near springs (and old villages), as at Karyditsa and Amygdalia;208 others occupy eccentric locations (e.g., hill slopes over deep ravines). As far as one can judge, none of the sites antedates the Late Neo- 1,36 G. Karametrou-Mentesidi, ArchDelt 42 B' (1987) 418- 19, 426, and 429-31; A.

Intensive research will, however, be necessary before patterns emerge.209 The important question is whether the settlement pattern here, in the rela- tively dry Tertiary zone, is different from that in the riverine zone, which has a distinctive-and privileged- pedology, hydrology, and even climate. Aiani, a major center of the early historical period in Macedonia, is also located in the Tertiary zone (fig. 2:5). The main site, Megali Rahi, is a true acrop- olis, rising 40-80 m above its immediate surround- ings, to 480 masl. Recent excavations of the IZ' Ephoreia211 indicate that the acropolis appears to have been occupied from the Bronze Age to the first century B.C. The earliest features, in a level area near the summit, are two small oval buildings with stone foundations, one of them with a rectangular hearth in the middle.211 The buildings are associated with pots- including mugs with two handles- that the excavator compares with those of Armenohori (70 km to the north; fig. 2:1). The latter is "the only site which could date between the Early Bronze Age and the Early Iron Age [previously] excavated in western Macedonia."212 However fragmentary, the evidence suggests habitation of the acropolis in the later Bronze and Early Iron Age as well. In the saddles and ridges below the acropolis, Karametrou found an abundance of LN (mainly black-burnished) ceram- ics, and a second extensive site of similar date was identified through exploration a few kilometers away.213 At the northern foot of the acropolis, in a colluviated area, excavation revealed a series of later Bronze/Early Iron Age burials in pits and cists, along with a hearth-like structure and a pile of ca. 80 broken pots. The majority of the pots are "matt-painted," but the pile also included a complete Mycenaean pot and parts of others. At least one of the graves con- tained a Mycenaean alabastron next to a matt-painted bowl and a bronze pin.214 The finds of Aiani are important for several rea- sons.215 First, the widespread distribution of LN material documented by the excavator raises the possibility of dispersed settlement on the Tertiary terraces around Megali Rahi. Second, the early build- ings on the acropolis itself suggest occupation dur- ing a period (ca. 2000 B.C.?) for which, in western Macedonia, we know virtually nothing. Radiocarbon dates would, in this case, be extremely useful. Third, a pile of broken matt-painted pots and a hearth within a cemetery from the end of the Bronze Age raise intricate interpretative questions, as the exca- vator emphasizes. Fourth, the concurrence, in a few contexts, of local matt-painted and Mycenaean pots is notable, for it is without clear precedents in west- ern Macedonia. The matt-painted pots of Macedonia, Epirus, and Albania have been the subject of much discussion and controversy in the past. Thanks to new excavations and to distribution studies carried out in the 1970s, it is now known that comparable techniques of matt-painting appear and disappear at different times in different regions, from Kosovo to southern Italy.216 In western Macedonia they have been thought to occur both toward the end of the Bronze Age and in the Early Iron Age, yet the evi- dence for the date assigned to specific finds has often been superficial. The Aiani finds do not yet resolve such problems, but they may point to a date for the 20W The head of a Mycenaean figurine and a Mycenaean amphora also come from the area, but they are without precise context: G.

Grevena and the upper Aliakmon catchment. The most striking discovery thus far reported by the inter- disciplinary, comprehensive survey of the Nomos of Grevena undertaken by Carleton College217 is that of"at least" 15 EN sites.218 Most of those sites are less than 1 ha in area, and occupy terraces and relatively flat areas near major streams. Mudbrick features in many instances suggest a considerable degree of per- manence. More fieldwork will be needed, however, before one can determine why, around 6000 B.C., people settled in a landscape dominated by deeply incised terraces, and why they left their hamlets soon after. Could the EN evidence produced by the Gre- vena project be indicative of a larger pattern, yet to be mapped in other parts of western Macedonia? The distribution of Bronze Age sites is no less inter- esting: some were found in higher elevations, near 1,000 masl, and those of the Middle Bronze Age - with occasional pieces of "Gray Minyan"- often "are on rather large, isolated hill tops."219 In this last, im- portant respect, Grevena in the Middle Bronze Age begins to sound a little like, for example, Messenia (see below, "New Questions"). Further north, along the eastern foothills of the Pindos range, several sites have been found in re- cent years.220 At the same time, a LN site on the shore of Lake Kastoria, Dispilio (fig. 2:2), has come under excavation; intriguing finds include what may be the trace of a small flatboat, and a mysterious wooden tablet.221 Kitrini Limni area. Since the 1950s, strip mining and industry have brought havoc to the Ptolemais system of basins, creating new deep valleys and pre- cipitous hills. Neolithic sites were first identified here in 1913, but systematic surveys did not begin until the mining had transformed an area ca. 50 km2 in the central part of the system.222 The southernmost and highest of the basins, Kitrini Limni (floor at 650 masl), has to date survived largely intact, and has been since 1987 the object of intensive surveys, ex- cavations, and experimental methods.22" Systematic survey has also been undertaken in the mountain- ous hinterland (Vermio), at elevations 850-1,480 masl. A summary of conclusions follows. Neolithic settlement on the basin floor began no later than 5600 B.C., as the presence of various EN elements (e.g., bowls on low bases, with red-slipped surfaces and linear patterns in white paint) at one site confirms. Another site, 5 km away, as well as a remote cave on Mt. Vermio (940 masl), may have been used at that time. The location of the confirmed EN site, Megali Toumba Ayiou Dimitriou, is noteworthy: it is adjacent to the central and least dry part of the basin floor, yet a few meters above it, on a low ridge, commanding a view in all directions.224 For a pi- oneer agricultural community settling in a newly opened landscape, there is hardly a more privileged location in all of Kitrini Limni. The site was occu- pied in the Middle, Late, and Final Neolithic as well, becoming eventually the most conspicuous mound on the basin floor, with more than 5 m of deposits. It was used again some time in the Bronze Age, per- haps as a burial ground. At least three more sites on the basin floor were settled by the Middle Neolithic (as shown by the pres- ence of distinctive pot profiles with red-slipped sur- faces, occasionally with "flame" patterns, known, e.g., from MN Servia).225 During the Late and Final Neo- lithic, on the other hand, 13 sites-some between 5 and 10 ha in area-were settled. While all those 217 The project is directed by N.C. Wilkie. A substantial report will appear in Hesperia. See N.C. Wilkie, "The Grev- ena Project," ArchMak 5 (1993) 1,747-55; G.

Eleftherios, 853 masl), 2.5 km outside the basin, and overlooking a major trail (now, national road) to the Aliakmon valley, was also used in the Late or Final Neolithic.226 In the later part of the Final Neolithic, the basin floor appears to have lost much population. Typical EBA pieces are rare on the surface of the sites; small quantities were also found in "pockets" at the exca- vated site, Megalo Nisi Galanis (fig. 2:4). Here, pot- sherds from all the traditionally recognized EBA phases were identified, as well as a few later Bronze Age pieces.227 Some FN deposits in the periphery of Megalo Nisi Galanis were found buried under a dark lacustrine clay, which indicates an expansion of marshes in the basin floor. That episode, however, has yet to be dated with precision, and need not, therefore, be the cause of site abandonments in the basin floor (cf. above, "Environmental Change"). Finally, while the Mt. Vermio survey was successful in identifying small sites (including several tumuli, situated over pastures at 1,050-1,150 masl), it located no definite Bronze Age sites. The excavation at Megalo Nisi Galanis has iden- tified two main phases, a "Late" and a "Final Neolithic." The LN deposits rest on a nearly level part of the basin floor, directly on a thin horizon of dark clay that covers the soft, clay marl substratum. Settle- ment began at a time when the red-slipped pots known from the Middle Neolithic were still being produced.228 In the course of time, those were pro- gressively replaced by dark-burnished pots with rounded profiles, and, later still, by "black-topped," distinctly carinated ones.229 This last ceramic sub- phase has been dated at the site to the range 5200- 4950 B.C.23's The end of the Late Neolithic is, how- ever, missing from the excavated trenches- the re- sult of digging by the subsequent, FN occupants of the site; traces of that subphase (e.g., small sherds with "classical Dimini," or comparable, patterns) are found in later deposits. The Final Neolithic of Megalo Nisi Galanis is, in terms of ceramics and stone tools, comparable to the "Rachmani" phase in Thessaly (e.g., Pefkakia), and it shares many elements with the early part of the Final Neolithic in southern Greece (e.g., Kitsos Cave). Two dates from different contexts show hab- itation in the period 4700-4450 B.C.231 Pottery now is much more abundant than before. Hemispherical and conical bowls in a wide range of capacities (0.12-9 liters) predominate, followed by jars with capacities up to 30-35 liters. What truly character- izes the ceramics of this phase, however, is a variety of clay bodies (calcareous and non-calcareous), sur- face treatments (including frequent application of white and pink "crusts"), pigments, and a broad range of new types of containers and other utensils (e.g., "strainers" and asymmetrical and angular vessels).232 Taken together, the increase in the quantity of pot- tery and the proliferation of fabrics and shapes strongly suggest that the ceramic craft radically ex- panded, its products becoming useful in a large spec- trum of diverse practices; one is tempted to speak of a "ceramic revolution," the full articulation of which with other crafts and activities needs to be systematically explored. The lithic material from the FN deposits comprises heavily used and reused blades (often as scrapers and drills) from a variety of high-quality cherts, obtained mostly as ready- made tools or blanks through long-distance trade. Obsidian of Melian texture is present in the upper- most deposits, which also contain objects from ma- rine shell, and pieces of gold sheet and wire. In house construction, a calcareous concrete was used; it prob- ably was a man-made material, prepared by mixing lime with a sandy sediment collected for the pur- pose from streambeds.233 Some surfaces were covered with fine white plasters. 22 E Petsas, Prakt 1965, 27-28. EBA occupation is in evi- dence as well. 227 Examples of both the earliest and the latest ceramic materials from Kitrini Limni are illustrated in Fotiadis and Hondroyanni-Metoki (supra n. 187); "tubular lugs," "corded" designs, and clay "anchors" should be added to the EBA material. 22" Cf. "phase 6" at Servia, Ridley and Wardle (supra n. 186) 212-13. 229 The groups of rounded dark-burnished pots and car- inated "black-topped" vessels have some elements in com- mon (e.g., "rippled" decoration), yet they appear to have been produced by two very different ceramic recipes, at least at Megalo Nisi Galanis (Fotiadis, personal observa- tions, 1994; cf. Ridley and Wardle [supra n. 186] 216-17). The technology of the LN carinated pots is treated exten- sively in Kalogirou (supra n. 223), esp. 72-106. For means by which the distinctive shine of the LN carinated pots could be achieved, see, e.g., Vitelli (supra n. 128) 143-44. 23" Two dates: 6150 ? 90 B.P. (Beta-48508) and 6250 ? 170 B.P.

Most deposits thus far excavated at Megalo Nisi Galanis are secondary, and contexts-especially FN ones - are highly frag- mentary. Nevertheless, that is the only site thus far excavated in western Macedonia with an almost com- plete LN sequence topped by a rich Final Neolithic. Drosia (fig. 2:3).234 Drosia is located in a small ba- sin (ca. 8 km2, 500 masl) in the upper catchment of the Agras River, east of Lake Vegoritis. The cultural horizon, up to 1.20 m thick, occupied a gentle rise, and extended over at least 1.4 ha. Excavation in 1992 by the IZ' Ephoreia in an area ca. 40 m2 uncovered remains of house floors, made of clay set on an in- frastructure of worked timbers. At least two such floors were identified ca. 10 m apart, and one of them preserved a small grinding facility, a slab supported by small stones. In the space between the two floors a pit was found, 3 m in diameter and 40 cm deep, containing a large amount of potsherds, stone tools, and animal bone. Outside that pit, the cultural de- posits contained few artifacts. The site must belong to the period 6000-5500 B.C., as is shown by hemispherical bowls with red- burnished surfaces and occasional bands of red paint, and by "barbotine" patterns on some of the larger vessels. The excavator calls attention to the relatively large number of ground stone tools (mainly axes or adzes from serpentinites) in comparison with the number of chipped stone blades and scrapers (made on both good- and poor-quality cherts). Three lower bodies of clay figurines, three "sling bullets," a "spool," and a chert "arrowhead" are also mentioned. Drosia, then, is a single-period, EN/MN settlement with dispersed houses, the first site of its kind to be identified in this part of Greece.235 It lies in a well- watered, fertile part of the landscape amid high mountains, but also along the main natural artery (Via Egnatia)236 from the plains of central Mace- donia to the upland basins of Pelagonia and Ptol- emais. It may therefore have been not simply one more settlement of pioneer farmers in search of a cultivable patch, but also a station along the trails of prospectors and traders, a socially marked place in a sparsely populated landscape.237 The finds ought to be examined with that possibility in mind. Eight thousand years after it was formed, the cultural horizon is extremely fragile, and hardly detectable from the surface, even though the house floors lie less than 50 cm below. The circumstances of discov- ery are instructive: the site was spotted as it was be- ing bulldozed away, in the course of industrial de- velopment. One lesson is that such sites are difficult to detect, and, in certain areas, scores of them may lie hidden under recent alluvia. Yannitsa area. In the low terraces flanking the plain of central Macedonia on the northern side, between the courses of the Loudias and the Axios, recent explorations by the IZ' Ephoreia have pro- duced evidence for at least 15 new prehistoric sites. Information on most of them still is sketchy,238 but one site, Yannitsa B (fig. 2:13), has been under ex- cavation by P. Chrysostomou since 1989, and short reports appear regularly.23" The site is located in a densely built area within the city limits of Yannitsa, and only small parts of it can be excavated. Late Neo- lithic deposits have been estimated to cover an area of 6-8 ha; in their southern quarter, in an area near springs, they appear to rest directly on deposits, up '234 S.

In one of the soundings into those EN depos- its, Chrysostomou uncovered the remains of three superimposed structures, the lowest resting on the natural surface and being elliptical in plan, the others being rectangular. The small internal diameter of the elliptical structure appears to be ca. 4 m.24" All three structures had walls built around frames of sturdy posts. The walls of the upper two structures rested in foundation trenches (50-60 cm wide, 40 cm deep), and the floor of one of them had been lined with a hard calcareous material.241 From an- other sounding Chrysostomou reports a massive foundation, perhaps of a platform, constructed with fieldstones set in clay.242 The above are the earliest structural remains to be uncovered in northern Greece since the excava- tion of Nea Nikomedeia (fig. 2:11). An early date is suggested, first of all, by the associated pottery, which is characterized by an abundance of red-slipped, deep hemispherical bowls (often on ring bases, many with solid and linear patterns in white paint) and by small quantities of pots with impressed decoration.243: Even more telling perhaps are a few "studs" ("ear- plugs"),44 known to mark a very early ceramic Neo- lithic horizon from Iran to Thessaly.245 A date around 6000 B.C. or earlier seems likely. A series of '4C dates from the site is essential, and might also resolve remaining questions on the date of Nea Nikomedeia.246 The settlement stood near the coast of the Aegean, ca. 25 km around the gulf from Nea Nikomedeia.247 A third EN settlement appears to have been located between Yannitsa B and Nea Nikomedeia. Material of the Middle Neolithic is reported from yet another site, while later Neolithic components are claimed for more than 20 sites in the area.248 It is worth re- membering that one of the latter sites, Aravissos, is the source of a small hoard of gold objects (unfor- tunately, a "chance find") that have close parallels among the funerary furnishings from the cemetery of Varna (Bulgaria).249 Mandalo (fig. 2:12). A small mound (area under 0.5 ha, height 7-8 m), Mandalo is located on a nar- row interfluve, ca. 40 masl, in the northwestern part of the Yannitsa terraces. A substantial portion of the mound (ca. 10%) was excavated from 1981 to 1988 by the University of Thessaloniki, and a group of 19 generally consistent radiocarbon dates now is available.25" Two main periods of occupation have been distinguished, a "Late Neolithic" and an "Early Bronze Age," separated by an occupational hiatus of ca. 1,000 years. The "Late Neolithic" of the site spans the second half of the fifth millennium B.C. (12 useful dates, ca. 5700-5300 B.P.)-a time period that, according to the chronological framework we have adopted in this review (table 1), is part of the Final Neolithic. The ceramic and other parallels (e.g., implements for copper working, acrolithic figurines) also are with sites, in Greece and beyond, that be- long to the Final Neolithic.

No such discrepancy exists for the second period of occupation, the Early Bronze Age at the site, which covers the years 2900-2200 B.C. (five dates in stratigraphic order, ca. 4300-3850 B.P.). In both periods, habitation structures were built with pise, piled onto frames carried by large posts. White plasters and clays were commonly used for floors and hearths (cf. the FN phase at Megalo Nisi Galanis). House plans, however, have proven intrac- table, despite efforts251 and the relatively broad ex- posures. Toward the end of the Neolithic occupation, a large wall made of fieldstones was erected. Almost 2.5 m wide and more than 1.4 m high, the wall may have ringed the settlement, or some part of it; alter- natively, it may have formed a barrier on one side only. A second, outer wall is veiled in comparable uncertainties. Parts of those walls may still have been standing above ground 1,200 years later, during the EBA occupation.252 A child burial in an urn also was part of the Neolithic settlement, and the remains of an adult were at some point reburied in a pit lined with mudbricks and a clay floor.253 Tojudge by the volume of debris (mainly building materials) accumulated in so small an area, habita- tion structures must have been tightly packed. Still, the community can never have numbered more than a few dozen people- that is, assuming that the com- munity lived within the walled area, and not in houses dispersed in the plain below.254 In the last instance, the walled site might even have been a chiefly estate. But the possibilities are many, and one must wait for the in-depth studies of the many classes of data. One point is clear. Despite its small size, Mandalo cannot be thought of as a settlement marginal to the regional economic system, nor perhaps to the political one: inside the wall, a variety of productive activities took place, including the manufacture of textiles, perhaps at some scale;255 and, toward the close of the fifth millennium, a coppersmith appears to have lived there.256 Makriyalos (fig. 2:10). The recently excavated Neo- lithic site of Makriyalos occupies a hill, ca. 1 km in- land from the modern coast, in the rolling landscape of northern Pieria. Surface remains cover an area of ca. 50 ha. Of these, 6 ha were intensively excavated from November 1992 toJune 1994, in one of the larg- est, best coordinated salvage efforts ever conducted in Greece.257 The excavators have distinguished two components, with a minimum of spatial overlap. The earlier component is securely datable by the pre- ponderance of characteristic black-burnished pots to the early part of the Late Neolithic. At that time the entire settlement was encircled by a system of ditches. Habitation structures within the circle were partly sunk into the ground; they survived as pits, often overlapping, in groups separated by extensive open spaces. One of those groups of pits was found littered with exceptionally large quantities of cultural residue, ranging from scraps of animal bone to com- plete figurines. As the preliminary reports make clear, the concen- tric ditches - up to three - were maintained through substantial, continuous investments of labor. Dug and redug as a series of adjoining pits into the Ter- tiary substratum, the largest one reached in places a depth of 4 m, and widths exceeding 5 m. Subse- 251 See esp. K.

Refuse from the settlement, including human bone, frequently found its way into the ditch. Not all of the accumulation, however, was due to ac- cidents (e.g., collapsing ditch walls, or trapping of loose debris from above): burials, both primary and secondary, had intentionally been placed in the ditch. Such evidence is intriguing. The ditches no doubt served a variety of purposes, including defense against raiders and against intrusions of the wild. But the episodic nature of digging, the irregulari- ties in proportions and sections, and, even more, the episodes of partial infilling, at least with burials-- all of those also require explanation. One is re- minded of remarks made by I. Hodder about ditches at a British site: "the enclosure was less a thing than a process. Ditches were continually being subdivided and joined." For Hodder, the larger entity, the en- closure in this case, was the product of "segmented labour activities" involving, among other things, com- petition between the social segments responsible for the work.258 In the enclosure of Makriyalos too, one is tempted to see a process as much as a thing: the ditches may well have constituted a field of conten- tions not only between a human community and na- ture, but also among the social units-kin groups or other- making up the community. Such a hypoth- esis deserves exploration. The later component at Makriyalos yielded a very high proportion - thus far unique outside Thessaly-- of "classical Dimini" ceramics, with painted as well as incised patterns. The new settlement occupied a smaller area, adjacent to that occupied before. The density of structures in the inhabited space was higher, but appears to have varied through time. Most structures were, again, partly sunk into the soft ground. They were found as roughly circular pits of various depths and diameters, many preserving evidence for superstructures supported on frames of posts. One of the deepest pits was fitted with an earthen staircase, and had served as storage space; large jars had once stood on its floor. Gravel pave- ments outside the large pits had ovens built on them, while small pits served as depositories--some for seashell - or perhaps as cooking facilities.259 In ad- dition to the circular, partly subterranean structures, a number of rectangular, "megaroid" buildings with apsidal ends stood above ground. They appear to form a coherent pattern, and possibly belong to a distinct subphase. An infant cremation burial, bones in a small urn, was also found within the settled area, while several inhumations in pits were made at one point beyond the edge of the inhabited area. Finally, this settlement too, or some part of it, appears to have been bounded or divided by ditches. The salvage excavation of Makriyalos is a land- mark, opening a new, vast potential for research into Neolithic societies in Greece, thanks not only to the size of the area exposed, but also to the fine grain of observation. The contexts recovered- salvaged, indeed-are immensely rich.26? Neolithic settle- ments that spread over hill slopes, with houses sep- arated by ample open spaces, have been known from surface surveys in Macedonia since the 1970s.261 They have held the promise of large exposures, and of contexts modified only by natural forces and agri- culture, but not by repeated, long-term habitation. Makriyalos, the first such settlement to be extensively excavated, stands up to those promises. The pres- ence, side by side, of two distinct components is also interesting for at least two reasons: it provides a unique basis for a comparative approach to the phases of the local Neolithic; and it also hints at dis- continuities in the habitation of prehistoric sites in Greece-discontinuities one suspects, but cannot easily document, while excavating mound sites. Several other sites, contemporary with Makriyalos and later, have been discovered in northern Pieria in recent years, and some have been excavated.262 Mt. Olympos. Spathes (fig. 2:9), a 13th-12th cen- tury B.C. cemetery, with finds that might be equally at home in Mycenaean Thessaly, was excavated in 1985- 25 I. Hodder, "The Haddenham Causewayed Enclosure -A Hermeneutic Circle," in Hodder, Theory and Practice in Archaeology (London 1992) 232-33. 25' Pits found filled with ashes may, but need not, be places where fires were lit. They can also be places where fires were put out- safe depositories for embers still burn- ing, or storage for the resulting, highly useful ashes. The issue becomes critical when one attempts to determine whether hearths were indoors or outdoors, and whether, therefore, food consumption involved hospitality and rec- iprocity or was a sign of emerging redistribution; e.g., Hal- stead 1989, 74-76; Halstead 1994, 206-207. 26( The finds of Makriyalos display an incomparably large variety in materials and types, including obsidian and stones from distant sources, Spondylus shell as finished ornaments and raw material, and several copper artifacts. 261 See Kotsakis (supra n. 15) 127-28. 262 E.g., K.

Poulaki-Pantermali (IET' Ephoreia).263 Located on a steep, westward slope of Mt. Olympos, at 1,000-1,100 masl, the site overlooks a major high pass between Thessaly and Macedonia. No settle- ments are known in the area, but the valley floor be- low, 800-900 masl, has some potential for garden farming and tree orchards, and an intensive survey would be essential. In any case, the placing of the cemetery on a high slope with a broad horizon is noteworthy (though far from unique; see, e.g., above, the tumuli of Mt. Vermio). The graves - 34 excavated in an area of ca. 0.2 ha - were arranged in rows. The shafts, many of them ex- ceeding 2 m in length, were carefully dressed and roofed with heavy slabs, and were sealed from above with red earth. They had been repeatedly opened for new burials, including children. The dead were often buried with a carved sealstone on their chests, and with personal and other items-jewelry, pots, bronze weapons, and some biconical and conical "buttons" An unspecified number of those items are of readily recognizable Mycenaean types (e.g., ala- bastra, both rounded and straight-sided, ajuglet, two swords), and/or are objects usually found in graves in "Mycenaeanized" provinces (e.g., strings of glass paste and amber beads, the former with volute de- signs). The remains of another cemetery with com- parable graves and furnishings have also been found at some distance along the same mountain pass.264 As a consequence of those discoveries, the "border/ frontier boundary" of Mycenaean Thessaly in the area of Mt. Olympos may have to be drawn a little further west than Feuer drew it in 1983.265 But, un- til a detailed publication of the grave contents ap- pears, it is impossible to proceed with a more ex- acting interpretation. Did, for example, the graves belong to military personnel, dispatched by one of Thessaly's chiefs to guard a crossover into his terri- tory? Or did they belong to a "wild bunch"- mountain bandits, living off booty from traffic through the pass? Lumbering may also have been carried out in the area, the cemetery being located at the altitude where oaks give way to a dense conifer forest (see "Environ- mental Change" above). New Questions The maps of Neolithic and Bronze Age site dis- tributions in western Macedonia are rapidly being filled. Any attempt to analyze and interpret the emerging patterns, however, is compromised by the virtual absence of intensive surveys, especially of the kind that employ controlled (probability) sam- pling, and of geomorphological research. Only a few, tiny areas have undergone intensive surface survey (e.g., segments of the Aliakmon riverine zone; parts of the western watershed of Mt. Vermio). Geomorphic change, moreover, while evident to the trained eye in many areas, and also gleaned from the pollen record,266 is nowhere adequately dated, nor are its magnitude and complexities documented by refer- ence to quantified field data. Take as an example the Kitrini Limni basin. In the center of the basin floor,267 the surface on which some of the Neolithic settlements were established is today buried under a lacustrine clay at least 1 m thick. In theory, many small, especially EN, sites may lie under that deposit. The eastern quarter of the basin floor, on the other hand, is covered by large, coalescent alluvial fans, in part postdating the pre- historic occupation. What significance can one at- tach to the absence of prehistoric sites in that area? If none, and if no significance can be attached to the presence of only one confirmed EN site in the basin, how can one speak, for example, of the pro- cess of Neolithic colonization and the spread of agri- culture in the basin? In brief, the list of what one can infer from site distributions in western Macedonia today is consid- erably shorter than the list of what one should not attempt to infer. Let us focus on a few, specific, pos- itive points, those that might pose challenges to es- tablished views, or reinforce them. It appears, for example, that for every site with an EN and/or MN (roughly 6500-5400 B.C.) component identified in recent years, two to three sites with later Neolithic (LN and/or FN) components have been identified.268 Even when we consider the possibility that the later phases comprise a longer period of time than the earlier ones (table 1), that statistic still seems to lend 261 E.

First of all, an in- crease of population in the later Neolithic phases (noted by many for several circum-Aegean areas) is beyond dispute; not only are there more LN and FN sites, but some of them (e.g., Megalo Nisi Galanis, and other sites in Kitrini Limni) are, by Aegean stan- dards, massive. But that pattern does not seem to hold for every river valley and basin, as the evidence produced especially by the Grevena survey suggests. Furthermore, speculation that Greek Macedonia was virtually empty for the period 6500-5400 B.C. ap- pears to have been rash.27 The recent discoveries, accidental and systematic, of EN and MN sites in five different parts of western Macedonia strongly suggest that we have yet to learn a good deal about the late seventh and early sixth millennia B.C. In almost all five areas (except, perhaps, Grevena), the confirmed early sites are located at, or very near, the lowest points of the landscape- that is, in prox- imity to groundwater or streams. A dispersal to a variety of locations, including locations in elevated, dry land (e.g., terraces north of the Aliakmon), is noticeable for the later sixth millennium B.C. The significance of that pattern - far from unique to west- ern Macedonia271 - has yet to be fully understood. The dispersal, for example, cannot be seen as strictly the result of population pressure. Nor is it obliga- tory to see locations in relatively dry land (e.g., on terraces) as "agriculturally marginal": the marginal- ity in question depends as much on the goals of agri- cultural production as on pedology and rainfall."72 Finally, the suggestion that farming in dry parts of the landscape was made possible by the develop- ment of the ard meets several difficulties, both evi- dential and theoretical.273 In short, the Late Neo- lithic expansion remains a fascinating issue, in need of field and analytical investigations. Most remarkable is the occasional presence of later Neolithic material in sites that cannot have been se- lected for their farming potential.274 The strategic location of Ag. Eleftherios (near Kitrini Limni) with regard to an important trail was noted earlier, but it is impossible to specify the function of the site in the regional network. The significance of such sites is that they hint at dimensions of Neolithic societies systematically marginalized in our analyses. In par- ticular, the view of the Neolithic populations of mainland Greece as sedentary farmers, peaceful, hospitable, prudent, and devoted to nothing but production,275 has detracted attention from the po- tential those "farmers" had for practicing mobility. When mobility is discussed, it is primarily in the con- text of orderly modes of exchange.27 Yet practices of mobility also include common forms of aggres- sion and tactics of warfare-raids, ambushes, cun- ning embassies, misleading footprints. We should be paying more attention to all the precautions taken against such dangerous traffic, from ditches and walls around settlements to means of territorial surveil- lance and of intelligence about distant places.277 Rather than being skirted, the forms of aggression should be treated as central aspects of Neolithic po- litical economies; they appear to us to contribute as much to the formation of value (especially "pres- tige" value) as "elite" pots and specialist craftsmen. It is in the Bronze Age, however, that "high places"' affording large views and, hence, possibilities for ex- tended territorial surveillance, become occupied with some regularity (e.g., Megali Rahi, at Aiani, fig. 2:5; Neraida hill, fig. 2:7; and sites in the Grevena area). Whatever complex social transformation brings the new pattern about,278 it is not peculiar to Mace- 269 E.g., Demoule and Perles (supra n. 115) 398; cf.

The observation does, however, cast doubt on the common view that life in Bronze Age western Macedonia continued in isolation, becoming an im- poverished version of Stone Age manners, with noth- ing socially important happening (except inva- sions).28s There are important questions to be asked and investigated in the field: are the province's Bronze Age acropolis sites the marks of a new political econ- omy and organization? Were they the central places (in the "Assiros" or any other model)281 of a regional network of settlements yet to be systematically re- corded? Were they also lookouts, signaling stations, or cult places? Speculation will not substitute for evidence, which in some cases (e.g., Neraida) has been destroyed. CENTRAL MACEDONIA Environmental Change Pollen data from regions adjacent to central Mac- edonia (the area between the Axios and Strymon rivers, fig. 2) indicate a continuous expansion of de- ciduous forest during the early Holocene, both in the plains and the mountains, with a peak around 8000-7000 B.P. Forest expansion was succeeded by a decline, which at Philippoi is dated to 3500 B.P. and at Yannitsa to 4500 B.P., and may be partly at- tributable to human activity. Evidence for extensive clearing in the lowlands, possibly dating from the end of the second or beginning of the first millen- nium B.C., also comes from the mouth of the Stry- mon. The palynological evidence from the Yannitsa plain indicates generally unstable conditions related to successive inundations and sedimentations of the area, between 8500 and 7000 B.P.22 Geomorpholog- ical study in the Axios valley has shown that a ma- rine transgression connected to the sea-level rise after 8000 B.C. culminated around 4000 B.C., creating a deep gulf and areas of brackish water. During the Bronze Age the settlement of Kastanas was on an island, but successive alluviations by the Axios and episodes of land rise resulted in the silting of the gulf by 200 B.C.283 Environmental research has not confirmed any substantial changes in the climate during the last 8,000 years, although regional vari- ation cannot be excluded.284 Material Sequence and Archaeological Phases In contrast to eastern Macedonia, secure series of stratified 14C dates are generally lacking from central Macedonia, with the exception of the Bronze Age sites of Kastanas and Assiros. The chronology of earlier periods is of necessity relative, and relies on comparisons of the local ceramic sequences with those of eastern Macedonia and the Balkans, and occasionally with Thessaly. To some extent, com- parisons with other regions have resulted in a con- fusing terminology: the earliest levels are designated "Middle Neolithic" in Balkan terms but "Late Neo- lithic" according to Thessalian and southern Greek terminology. The same holds true for the "Chalco- lithic" and "Final Neolithic."285 In the discussion that follows we use the Aegean terminology. The earliest deposits in the region, dating to the end of the Middle Neolithic or beginning of the Late Neolithic, come from a small excavation at Vasilika, where a specific class of painted pottery has been related to the Thessalian MN painted styles.28' In 27" For the complexities of the transformation in Cen- tral Europe, see S.

Deposits that could be securely assigned to the Final Neolithic are difficult to define.28" Kastanas remains the only site with a stratified sequence for the third millennium, yet the dearth of material in the earliest four building phases and the clustering of three '4C dates in the later phases, between 2000 and 1800 B.C., preclude estimation of the time span represented by the site's stratigraphic sequence.28" The chronology of the Early Bronze Age has to rely, therefore, on general ceramic affini- ties with adjacent areas, and firm definition of sub- phases is still wanting. Stratified deposits with ce- ramic affinities to the earlier MBA phases in Argissa Magoula have been found at Kastanas but the later part of the Middle Bronze Age and the early Late Bronze Age, equivalent to the prepalatial Late Bronze Age in central and southern Greece, are still poorly documented. Recently excavated material from To- roni, Ayios Mamas, and Toumba Thessalonikis prom- ises to fill this gap.29? The later LBA stratigraphy is more adequately recorded at Kastanas, Assiros, and Toumba Thessalonikis. Mycenaean pottery of LH IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC styles in LBA stratified deposits has been used to establish a chronological scheme. Four 14C dates from the latest LBA phases at Assiros are fairly consistent and conform to the conventional chronology for the beginning of LH IIIC, around 1200. A long series from Kastanas offers dates around the 13th century B.C. for levels with LH IIIB pottery, but the late 13th-century date for levels with LH IIIC and Protogeometric pottery seems too high.29" Recent Projects The majority of prehistoric sites in central Mac- edonia were first systematically described by D.H. French in the 1960s. Additional sites have been iden- tified by the IET' Ephoreia, and the number has risen to 220.292 The temporal distribution of sites offers a rough account of the general trends of settlement. From the Late Neolithic to the Early Bronze Age a rise in density is observable. The increase in num- ber of sites in the later Bronze Age is accompanied by a decrease in the size of those sites. On present evidence, therefore, a process of nucleation cannot be documented in central Macedonia, in contrast to Thessaly.293 Most inventoried sites are tells, but a number of flat and inconspicuous Neolithic sites have recently been identified. Some of these are huge and reach dozens of hectares.294 287 Bln-3185 (6630 ? 50 B.P., 5580-5480 B.C.) and Bln- 3186 (6650 ? 50 B.P., 5585-5480 B.C.). See D.V.

Intensive survey since 1986 in the western Langadas basin has investigated the pattern of prehistoric human activity.295 The tectonic basin is dominated by two lakes, remnants of a larger sin- gle lake that contracted during the Early and Mid- dle Quaternary. Neolithic and Bronze Age sites are distributed unequally across the recent alluvium, the alluvial fans of the lower Pleistocene terrace, the heavier soils of the upper Pleistocene terrace, and further, on the surrounding mountains, where arable land was scarce, but not altogether unavailable. Two LN sites located in areas dominated by heavy, water- retentive soils are large and flat, reaching 30 ha. It has been suggested that their size is primarily due to a shifting, unrestricted occupation, interspersed with cultivated land.296 Why this pattern was pre- ferred to the more restricted habitation character- istic of tells is not immediately apparent. It may be suggested tentatively that proximity of habitation and fields facilitated the intensive cultivation of the land, compensating for the low workability of the heavy soil. In an area of relative aridity, such as that around Langadas, the productivity of this water- retentive soil in conditions of drought would be a vital advantage and would justify the extra labor re- quired. Another possibility, to be explored in the future, is that the sites were seasonally occupied. The problem of aridity, however, was probably resolved in a different way in the case of Kavallari (fig. 2:19) and other Neolithic sites located near the lakes, in areas that were regularly inundated.297 Neither of the flat, extended sites continued to be occupied in the Bronze Age. The number of sites declines generally in the Early Bronze Age, but dur- ing the Late Bronze Age, habitation becomes increas- ingly more dense, limited to small, steep-sided tells and to sites on hill summits. Traces of perimeter walls are preserved in some cases, and can be assumed in others, but their function, whether protective or retaining or both, cannot be confirmed. New sites in high places with an unrestricted view of the sur- rounding landscape were established at the end of the period and continued to be occupied into the Early Iron Age. The shift to settlement near a greater variety of soils and landscapes denotes an emphasis on diversified production, which is also detectable in the impressive archaeobotanical evidence from Assiros.29" The major settlements of Langadas devel- oped on the alluvial fans of the lower terraces. One of these, Assiros, possibly evolved during the Late Bronze Age into a regional economic center. Assiros (fig. 2:17). The 14-m-high tell of Assiros lies in the western part of the Langadas basin, and was extensively excavated in 1975-1979 and 1986- 1989. Nine building phases were identified on the top, of which phases 9-5 cover the later Late Bronze Age. The phases are dated by the occurrence of LH III pottery, with LH IIIA2 in phase 9 and continuing with LH IIIC in phases 7-5. Earlier deposits were dug on a limited scale on the side of the mound, providing a tentative date for the beginning of oc- cupation in the late Middle Bronze Age.299 A massive earthen bank and a casemate wall, re- peatedly reconstructed at the edge, supported the buildings inside, and, according to the excavator, de- fended the site.30?

The buildings had mudbrick walls with a frame of posts. A destruction by fire at the end of phase 9 preserved an impressive quantity and variety of charred seeds, stored in six storerooms occupying half the excavated area. The storerooms were crowded with pithoi, large baskets, and smaller clay containers. The quantity and pattern of storage sug- gested a communal storeroom, in contrast to the next two phases (7 and 6) of the Late Bronze Age, which have been more extensively excavated, and date to the 12th century. Storage facilities in these phases were dispersed throughout the settlement, and stor- age appears to have been a more private affair than previously.3')l The settlement consisted of at least four large, elongated complexes with rectangular rooms separated by narrow streets. Open and roofed spaces were found in each complex, equipped with ovens, hearths, occasional pithoi, and other food- processing and storage facilities. The final LBA phase (5) shows few changes in the alignment and internal arrangement of the buildings. The smaller amount of pottery, particularly of Mycenaean type, precludes close dating.s32 Handmade pottery with a limited variety of wares and shapes, mainly plain burnished ware, comprises the overwhelming majority of the finds at Assiros, as at all other Bronze Age sites in Macedonia. Matt- painted and incised vessels with white or pink fill or incrustation are a small portion of the ceramic repertoire and indicate a specialized production on a small scale. Mycenaean ceramics appear with in- creasing frequency, but remain, until the end of the Bronze Age, a very small fraction of the assemblages. Small shapes predominate, indicating that Mycenae- an vases probably reached Assiros as "luxuries."', Excavations at Assiros offer a wealth of informa- tion on an inland LBA settlement in central Mace- donia, the result of the intensive strategy employed, with several aspects of prehistoric life and different types of evidence investigated. During the 13th and 14th centuries (phases 8 and 9), Assiros in all prob- ability acquired a principal position in the regional economic structure, becoming the focus of agricul- tural storage, which exceeded the needs of this set- tlement. It has been suggested that a hierarchical political structure, analogous to that of the south- ern Greek palaces, had been established in central Macedonia by that time.s3o4 The bioarchaeological finds, however, along with the rest of the archaeo- logical evidence, do not support a specialized and extensive agriculture, nor a centralized economy. Rather, they can be better understood in the context of a small-scale, diversified, intensive farming and animal husbandry regime.315 Storage at Assiros, therefore, may not represent mobilization of surplus to serve an elite controlling production and ex- change, but a reserve against the unpredictabilities of a subsistence economy. Assiros could have been the focal point of a regional settlement network with a hierarchical structure, but a small-scale and un- stable network very different from the contempo- rary polities of Mycenaean Greece.3o6 The regional evidence helps to clarify further the picture: in the western Langadas basin, the nearby tell of Perivolaki 301 The storerooms of Assiros offered a wealth of infor- mation on storage techniques, crop-processing methods, and farming practices. The stored crops included einkorn, broomcorn, millet, bitter vetch, macaroni wheat, and hulled barley (pure crops), and emmer and spelt (a mixed crop). Flax, lentils, and unrecognizable seeds have also been found. See Jones (supra n. 298) 117-23; and Wardle 1989 (supra n. 299) 462. 302 Wardle 1989 (supra n. 299) 455. 303 For a discussion of pottery and other finds from the site, see Wardle 1980 (supra n. 299) 244-53. For an excel- lent summary of LBA Macedonian ceramics based on the sample from Assiros, see Wardle 1993 (supra n. 299) 121-24, 127-29, 130-33, with reference to previous work. Accord- ing to macroscopic observations and some chemical anal- yses, Mycenaean-style pottery at Assiros falls into three broad groups, designated by Wardle as "local," "imports" from centers of the southern mainland, and "provincial," a non-homogeneous group. Coastal central Macedonia has been tentatively suggested as one of the sources for the last group. The earliest "local" Mycenaean sherd in Assiros was found in phase 9. By phases 7 and 6, "local" and "pro- vincial" pottery predominated in the Mycenaean pottery assemblages. Despite their long coexistence, the handmade and Mycenaean (wheelmade) wares apparently stem from two independent manufacturing traditions. Only occasion- ally did other Mycenaean objects find their way to Assiros, see, e.g., Wardle 1980 (supra n. 299) 253. For chemical anal- yses, see Jones (supra n. 149) 108-112, 494.

This pic- ture of small-scale networks is corroborated by the evidence from Toumba in Thessaloniki (see below). Kastanas (fig. 2:16). Four seasons of excavation at Kastanas, a 14-m-high mound on the left bank of the Axios River, explored parts of another long- lasting Bronze Age and Iron Age settlement. The site, an island during the Bronze Age, was located near a coast occupied by several tells, the most imposing of which is the well-known mound of Axiochori (Vardaroftsa) .07 The excavation revealed a deep stratigraphy with Bronze Age and Iron Age levels.38s The Bronze Age was separated into 17 building phases: eight assigned to the Early Bronze Age and the beginning of the Middle Bronze Age, and the rest to the Late Bronze Age. A period of abandonment separated the two groups of building phases.309 The architectural pic- ture for the EBA phases is elusive. Sparse architec- tural traces indicate lines of posts with one possible apsidal building and a complex of post-framed rooms containing clay benches and food-processing facil- ities.:31 More information comes from the LBA phases. The characteristic features in phases 18-14 are parts of apsidal or rectangular freestanding build- ings, laid out in a random way, without an apparent overall plan.:1" Hearths and food-processing facili- ties are concentrated mainly inside the buildings. A preference for larger, more widely spaced houses, and the adoption of mudbrick for construction of walls mark the beginning of the Late Bronze Age. Such features have been exposed over a limited area, however, and their significance cannot be evaluated. Transformations of the settlement layout are ev- ident in the final part of the Late Bronze Age. The orientation of post-framed houses in phase 13, with ovens and hearths inside and outside, changed.312 In phase 12, the independent buildings were re- placed by complexes of rooms, built with mudbricks and supported by posts. The buildings were arranged in a more compact way, reminiscent of the layout at Assiros in phases 7-5. Food-processing facilities were appended in special, possibly roofed, areas out- side the houses, while storage facilities were absent. It has been suggested that one of the complexes served a large number of occupants. The next change in settlement layout is dated to the 10th century B.C. or later. Apart from stratigraphic and architectural evi- dence, the work at Kastanas has produced signifi- cant bioarchaeological data. According to Kroll,313 a highly diversified subsistence system during the Early Bronze Age was succeeded in the Late Bronze Age by a more specialized and extensive system of agriculture and stock-raising. The end of the Bronze Age was marked by the adoption of a more balanced regime, namely, intensive small-scale cultivation of a wide variety of crops and a new interest in gath- ering and, especially, hunting.314 The changes in the layout of Kastanas and the or- ganization of production during phases 18-14 of the Late Bronze Age have been regarded as evidence for a more centralized social organization, influenced by developments in southern, Mycenaean Greece.315 Evidence from Assiros and the Langadas survey im- 307 For the geomorphological study, see Schulz (supra n. 185) 375-93. 308 Kastanas 25-62, esp. 52-54.

No Mycenaean pottery was found in the earliest LBA phase (19); LH IIIA2 pottery appears in phase 18, and LH IIIC pottery in phase 14. In phase 12, however, Middle Proto- geometric pottery was found along with pottery preserv- ing Mycenaean LH IIIC features. Quantities of wheelmade pottery rose dramatically during this phase: Hdinsel (supra n. 291) 189-91; Podzuweit (supra n. 291) 203-23. Phase 11 has been assigned to a period contemporary with Proto- geometric. On the basis of similar Mycenaean pottery at Kastanas and Assiros, phases 18 and 17 of Kastanas may be correlated with phase 9 at Assiros, phases 16-14b at Kastanas with phase 8 at Assiros, and phases 14-13 with 7-5 at Assiros. The date of phase 12 at Kastanas remains an open problem, especially since 14C determinations in- dicate a date in the 12th century B.C. or earlier. A similar assemblage is missing from Assiros but was recently found at the Toumba of Thessaloniki (see below). 31 Aslanis (supra n. 289) 32-35, figs. 13-14; 45-53, figs. 23-24.

The communal storerooms at Assiros are conspicuously absent from the Axios site, as are the earthen banks and casemate walls at the edge. A possible explanation may lie in the rank of each site in its regional network: Kastanas in the Late Bronze Age may have been part of a polity of which it was not the center.2" Gallikos valley. Very little work has recently been done in the Gallikos valley. During excavations at Toumba Nea Anchialos (fig. 2:15), a third-millennium pottery deposit and possibly the remains of an EBA pottery kiln were found in the area of the Archaic cemetery. Recent excavations at the tell have offered indications that the earliest phase of occupation there may be placed at the end of the Late Bronze Age.321 Area of Thessaloniki. Two Neolithic sites have been explored in the coastal plain of Thessaloniki by the IET' Ephoreia. Stavroupolis is located on the hills to the west, and the other site in a flat area at the center of the city. Both sites are extended and flat. The latter, for which more information is available, has been dated to the final Middle Neolithic and early Late Neolithic, and the only remains of habitation were pits, similar to those at Makriyalos.322 Toumba Thessalonikis (fig. 2:20). Toumba Thessa- lonikis, or Toumba Kalamaria, is an imposing tell in the hills surrounding the small coastal plain of the inner Thermaic Gulf. The tell is 1.3 ha in area and stands 23 m above a plateau formed by the de- posits of an Iron Age settlement spread around the base. Once a prominent feature of the landscape, it is now blocked by modern high-rise buildings. Ex- cavations since 1984 by the University of Thessa- loniki have uncovered deposits ranging from the late Early Bronze Age to the fourth century B.C.323 Five 316 Extensive agriculture and overproduction geared to a surplus for exchange and trade have been claimed for Kastanas. Questions have been raised, however, regarding the interpretation of the archaeobotanical evidence:Jones (supra n. 305) 141. 317 Kastanas 335-37. 3 18Channeled ware, considered an indication of north- ern intruders, appears at Kastanas for the first time in phase 13, in extremely small quantities, and continues modestly into later phases: Hochstetter 1984 (supra n. 308) 188-94; for the "Mycenaean elements" in the architecture of phase 12, see Andreou and Kotsakis 1992 (infra n. 323) 265-66. 319 A wider variety of Mycenaean pottery motifs was noted at Kastanas, although Mycenaean pottery appeared at the same time at both sites. Comparison of frequencies from the two sites, however, is inhibited by a lack of de- tailed quantitative data. The appearance of Protogeo- metric style is much more obvious at Kastanas than at As- siros, but the suggestion that Mycenaean pottery produc- tion continued on the former site during the Early Iron Age has been questioned by Wardle 1980 (supra n. 299) 252. Decorated and undecorated wares, including double cooking vessels with central European affinities, displayed a similar variety at both sites. Other finds relating to every. day activities were also identical. For the Mycenaean pot- tery of Kastanas in the wider Macedonian context, see Pod- zuweit (supra n. 291); C. Podzuweit, "Der spitmykenische Einfluss in Makedonien," in ArchMak 4 (1986) 467-84. For comparisons between the material culture of Assiros and Kastanas, see Wardle 1993 (supra n. 299) 121-24, 127, 129, 133-35.

For other finds, see Hoch- stetter 1987 (supra n. 308) 94-101. 320 The nearby site of Axiochori, one of the largest mounds in Greek Macedonia, may be the equivalent of Assiros in the Axios area. Indeed, such a suggestion was made by Hiinsel for the subsequent Early Iron Age: Kastanas 340-41. 321 S.

The earliest three (phases 5-3) belong to the later Late Bronze Age, and in their deposits little LH IIIC-style pottery was found. The penulti- mate phase (2) contained some pottery with compass- drawn concentric circles and new shapes more akin to Protogeometric shapes, along with Mycenaean-style features.324 Earlier Bronze Age phases have only been reached in trenches on the side of the mound. Habitation levels dating from the end of the third millennium have been found both at the bottom and near the top of the mound, indicating that the settlement had spread across the slope of the natural hill, in stepped terraces, reminiscent of the arrangement at Pefkakia during the Middle Bronze Age.325 Architectural re- mains of the Middle Bronze Age were found in a small area at the bottom of the mound.326 The lay- out changed in the Late Bronze Age, when massive casemate constructions (6 m wide x 3 m high) were erected midway down the slope, surrounding the tell. The houses were on the top of the mound, supported by a strong retaining wall.327 The purpose of the massive constructions is not entirely clear. They had a retaining function, but at the same time they con- trolled access to the central part of the settlement on the top. The LBA houses were tightly clustered. A system of narrow lanes separated large blocks of rooms in a layout that was maintained for the last three phases of the Late Bronze Age. The large buildings were constructed of mudbrick reinforced by wooden posts. They comprised living quarters and extensive store- rooms with large pithoi. One 225-m2 complex was uncovered, with storerooms occupying more than half the area.328 The inventory of finds is similar to that from Assiros and Kastanas. Several bronze im- plements were collected, a hoard of which included a double ax and was found in one of the rooms of the large complex. The same complex also contained a bone horse bit of Central European type.329 The earliest, unstratified, Mycenaean pottery dates to LH IIIA1. Later on, both imports and local products are found, although Mycenaean pottery never seems to have exceeded 5.5% of the total assemblage.330 The formation processes of the mound are very complex, and offer an idea of the difficulties involved in the interpretation of the stratigraphic sequence of some high Bronze Age tells. The successive con- struction of massive earthworks at different levels on the slope creates a stratigraphy that does not fol- low the regular principle of superposition of layers. It may even result in an "inverted" stratigraphy, where older layers are found above later ones. Of equal im- portance are the implications for the mobilization of a workforce to erect these ramparts. In this respect, tells like Toumba and Assiros stand apart from sites like Kastanas, where no traces of this intensive ac- tivity can be discerned. At Assiros the difference is amplified by the centralized storage of phases 9 and 8. At Toumba, information on storage is not as con- clusive, but the scale of the collective effort inferred from the earthworks points again to a centralized social structure in the Late Bronze Age. Thermi and Vasilika (fig. 2:21-22). The Neolithic sites of Thermi and Vasilika are located in the valley of Anthemous to the east of Thessaloniki.

The amount of wheel- made pottery at Toumba rises dramatically during phase 2. Also notable at Toumba is the absence of channeled ware from this and earlier phases. 325 See supra p. 548. 326 The latest of these levels contained incised pottery, a few sherds of dark-burnished, ribbed cups, and even oc- casional matt-painted sherds. These features comply to some extent with Heurtley's original definition of the MBA, see Heurtley (supra n. 150) 89-91. The levels must be later than those designated by Aslanis (supra n. 289) at Kastanas as early MBA.

The Thermi sequence was divided into three main building phases that were related to phase III at Vasilika. At Vasilika architectural remains are sparse, limited to the later deposits. They testify, how- ever, to the use of mudbricks and stone socles. The picture from Thermi is clearer, mainly be- cause a larger area was excavated. The site's main feature is an open surface, ca. 60 m2, paved with cobbles. In one of the trenches, deposits indicating a period of abandonment were found between two successive cobbled yards. Everyday activities took place in these yards, including food- and crop- processing and knapping a low-quality flint taken from a quarry some 12 km away. A hearth and sev- eral pits were related to food preparation activities. In the next phase (II), clay floors and traces of stone and post-built walls covered the cobbled yard. The general impression from the small excavation at Thermi is one of considerable discontinuity in the use of space, with activities shifting between open yards and habitation structures, and with temporary abandonments.332 Chalkidiki. Prehistoric research in Chalkidiki re- sumed the last few years, ending a long period of inactivity since Heurtley's work in the 1920s. While previous work in the area had focused on the flatter northern and western coasts, at mound sites such as Kritsana and Ayios Mamas (fig. 2:25), recent re- search has turned to the peninsula itself. Settlements here are often found on natural knolls by the sea and on rocky promontories, some of which, like the mounds in the plains, were occupied for long periods. On the western side of the Kassandra peninsula, at Cape Poseidi, a sanctuary with successive build- ings dating from the 10th century B.C. has been ex- cavated since 1989 (fig. 2:23).33" Beneath the earliest apsidal temple, dated by Middle and Late Protogeo- metric pottery, a deep deposit of ashes and animal bone indicated an earlier altar. The deepest levels there, underneath deposits described as Protogeo- metric and Submycenaean, reportedly contained LH IIIC-style pottery along with handmade wares. It has been suggested that both the wheelmade and hand- made pottery display closer affinities to Lefkandi wares than to local wares.:34 No LBA buildings have been found, but, if the earliest levels could be related to a sanctuary, then Poseidi would be the only spe- cialized site known from Bronze Age northern Greece, with indications of ritual that are missing from the tells of central Macedonia. The location of the site on a prominent spot by the sea, however, and the Euboean connections implied by the pottery might indicate its close relationship to seafaring pros- pectors at the close of the Bronze Age.335 On the eastern side of the Kassandra peninsula, the EBA settlement of Polichrono (fig. 2:24) was located on the slope of a natural hill, ca. 100 m from the shore of the Gulf of Toroni.3:6 Rescue ex- cavations revealed successive terrace walls with scanty remains of habitation. A more interesting find was a small pit interpreted as a potter's kiln at the out- er limit of the settlement, postdating the terrace walls.337 Bowls with incurving rims and trumpet lugs, one-handled tankards, pointed cups, and pithoi with plastic decoration date the find to the later part of the third millennium. 33 Toroni (fig. 2:26). Excavations over a number of years at the strategically located, steep promontory of Lekythos at Toroni have revealed extensive re- mains of occupation ranging from the Early Iron Age to the Ottoman period. A very significant de- velopment of recent years, however, has been the dis- covery of stratified remains belonging to a FN and Bronze Age settlement. Prehistoric pottery of the third and early second 332 There are only four pieces of obsidian of unspec- ified provenance reported from Thermi: Grammenos (supra n. 292) 234.

The traces of earliest occupation comprise a small number of burnished and white-painted FN sherds found on bedrock. EBA remains have been preserved more frequently: several closed deposits include architec- ture and floors belonging to different phases, occa- sionally accompanied by traces of destruction by fire. Among the EBA material, obsidian flakes, a "Trojan" anthropomorphic lid, not necessarily imported, sev- eral pieces of sauceboats, and a clay figurine have been found.340 Toroni is the only site in Greek Macedonia with a documented continuous stratigraphy from FN to the earliest part of the Late Bronze Age.34' MBA levels with mudbrick walls contained dark-faced handmade pottery and also wheelmade Gray and Yellow Minyan wares, presumably imported. More- over, imports from southern Greece continued to appear during the early Late Bronze Age. Toroni offers the earliest indication of imported Mycenaean pottery in the northern Aegean, with a handful of sherds of LH I, LH IIA, and LH IIB styles.342 One rubble stone foundation was connected with a de- posit of locally made two-handled bowls imitating Minyan shapes and associated with imported LH I and II sherds.343 The later phases of the Late Bronze Age, however, are poorly represented by a few sherds from handmade and Mycenaean wares. The special relationship of Chalkidiki to the Ae- gean has been pointed out since the beginnings of prehistoric research in Macedonia on the basis of very limited evidence.344 The comparison of the archaeological record from Toroni with that from Bronze Age tell sites in the rest of central Macedonia should allow a better evaluation of the impact Aegean connections may have had on local developments.345 Ayios Mamas (fig. 2:25). The recent resumption of investigations at the tell of Ayios Mamas promises to offer new evidence on the network of sites in Chal- kidiki from the Neolithic to the Late Bronze Age.346 Rescue excavations by the IET' Ephoreia of an EBA cemetery immediately west of the tell have revealed an aspect of EBA communities so far unique in the archaeological record of central Macedonia.347 The remains, comprising ca. 15 graves, were found amid burials of the Late Roman period. They displayed a variety of mortuary practices, such as contracted inhumations in pithoi sunk in shallow pits, or placed directly in pits strewn with pebbles, and one cre- mation of an infant. The graves were often delim- ited by rows of stones, and the pithoi selected for burials had plastic decoration and striated surfaces. Almost all burials were furnished with pots or copper/bronze ornaments. One of the best-preserved burials was furnished with ajug, cup, and a necked jar with vertically pierced lugs, which finds its best parallels in the Cyclades.348 In the jar, 25 beads, 339 A.

G. 141 A series of '4C dates from various stratified deposits is forthcoming, see Cambitoglou and Papadopoulos (supra n. 290) 164. Although the pottery from Toroni displays many strictly local features, its publication is expected to clarify the ceramic sequence of the third and early second millennia over a broad area. 342 Sixteen sherds of mostly open Early Mycenaean ves- sels have been found in stratified and mixed deposits. See Cambitoglou and Papadopoulos, in Zerner et al. (supra n. 339). 34 The occurrence of LH I and II pottery with imported or imitation Minyan ware is a good indication that MBA wares continued in coastal Macedonia, as well as elsewhere, into the earlier LBA phases. Minyan pottery in the Chal- kidiki sites of Ayios Mamas and Molyvopyrgos is better related to types common during the last phase of MH or the beginning of LH, see Pefkakia III, 382-83.

The surviving evidence from the ceme- tery is very incomplete, as scattered fragments of EBA pithoi indicate; nevertheless an impression of con- siderable care is dominant. New Questions Recent research in the province has once more failed to identify traces of habitation prior to the late sixth millennium. A number of possible expla- nations can be put forth: obliteration of the remains of early human settlement by postdepositional fac- tors, unsuitability of the area due to particular en- vironmental conditions, or the occupation of the area by non-sedentary populations, invisible to re- search geared to stable farming sites. In the Langa- das basin, for example, where survey was intensive, several episodes of erosion and alluviation after the Late Neolithic were identified.349 The absence of sites, however, cannot be accounted for by geomor- phological changes alone, unless early sites were ephemeral and were located exclusively on the al- luviated or eroded areas - an interesting possibility, but one that clearly needs additional firmly dated regional geomorphic and archaeological support. In the meantime, it is difficult to decide whether Mac- edonia east of the Axios River was uninhabited from the Upper Palaeolithic to the Middle Neolithic, or has simply been insufficiently researched. As a result of the uncertainties surrounding the time depth of settlement, major themes such as Neo- lithic colonization or Late Neolithic expansion can only be partly understood. Does the LN settlement pattern indicate the adoption of full-fledged farm- ing by a population previously exploiting the aquat- ic resources of the region or does it depict the ini- tial episodes of agricultural colonization of an empty area? Alternatively, does it represent the growth and expansion to less desirable locations of farming com- munities limited previously to specific niches? The extended sites that highlight the Neolithic settle- ment pattern imply a particular type of habitation and land use, but in view of the gaps in evidence, their relation to any of the alternatives remains ob- scure. What is perhaps more clear is the contrast between the extended sites and the tell sites that ap- pear also during the same period. Tells represent an option for continuity of settlement, which can be the result of economic choice but has also a defin- able ideological content.35 They were prominent points in the landscape, the mark of a community's permanence and its inhabitants' lineage, an instru- ment for constructing the identities of prehistoric people. The three recent large excavations on tells, focus- ing on the Late Bronze Age, and new data from sur- veys encourage discussion of political and economic aspects of the prehistoric communities of central Macedonia. The outstanding position of some settle- ments during the later Late Bronze Age in terms of capacity and centralization of agricultural storage, scale of public works, extent and size of occupation, and internal arrangement of houses suggests the op- eration of a hierarchical social organization, inte- grating neighboring sites. We have no details for the structure of this hierarchy, or for its ideological con- tent, which is markedly invisible in the archaeo- logical record. The range of the hierarchical net- works, however, must have been relatively limited, judging from the scale of production, small number of sites involved, their proximity, and restricted size. The limited range is probably reflected in the ab- sence of a strong symbolic expression of authority, which is also missing from the internal arrangement of houses at the settlements. This, however, remains an issue for future research, with the hope that information on mortuary practices will be forth- coming. Equally, the processes by which complexity rose and developed in the third and early second millennium B.C., or possibly earlier, are presently little understood. A recurrent issue in research since Heurtley worked in the area has been the relationship of LBA Macedonia with the "Mycenaean world" This relationship has been perceived in different forms by various researchers, ranging from more or less regular trading contacts to the establishment of southern colonies along the coast of central Mac- edonia. The arguments put forth in support of these propositions, occasionally not without considerable excess, range from similarities observed in building techniques to assumed analogies in political organi- zation, but the presence of Mycenaean-style pottery in the excavated deposits and on the surface of LBA 'WI The causes and exact dates of the alluviation-erosion episodes are not known, but there is at least one Neolithic site (Kavalari) in the Langadas basin that seems to have been partially buried under an alluvium of ca 1.25 m, either during, or right after, its use. For discussion of the absence of earlier Neolithic phases in the Langadas basin and its relation to environmental or postdepositional factors, see Morrison (supra n. 282) 274-75.

Although the relationship between Macedonia and the "Mycenaean world" never ceases to fascinate ar- chaeologists, it is still too early to define meaning- fully its intensity and nature.352 EASTERN MACEDONIA Environmental Change The environmental evidence from eastern Mac- edonia (the area between the Strymon and Nestos rivers) does not give a significantly different picture from that discussed above for central Macedonia, although it has been suggested that the Drama plain remained generally wooded, despite some small-scale fluctuations during the Bronze Age.353 Erosion and alluviation from the Strymon and Angitis rivers have been noted in the two plains of Drama and Serres as major contributors to postdepositional distortion of the archaeological record.354 The geomorpholog- ical evolution of the lakes and marshes at the bot- tom of the basins is not yet clearly understood, and human habitation in relation to this part of the plains is still unclear. Material Sequence and Archaeological Phases The Neolithic sequence in eastern Macedonia be- gins with Sitagroi I, dated by '4C to 5500-5200 B.C. (late Middle Neolithic in Thessalian terms). The only earlier case may be Toumba Serron (fig. 2:29), re- ported from surface finds as belonging to an earlier "Karanovo I" horizon.355 The earlier phase of the LN sequence for the region is represented by Dikili Tash I and Sitagroi II, and is defined by the presence of "black-topped" and "rippled" pottery along with a vari- ety of distinctive painted wares. It is dated by a series of 14C dates from Sitagroi to ca. 5200-4800 B.C.356 The later Late Neolithic, highlighted by "graphite" and "black-on-red" wares, is represented by the strati- graphic phases of Sitagroi III and Dikili Tash II. Ab- solute dates indicate that the sequences of the two sites are probably not coterminous, and Sitagroi III may continue into the Final Neolithic, i.e., after ca. 4500 B.C. The 14C dates from Sitagroi III, however, are not decisive since they all derive from the early levels of the phase. In addition to the well-known sequences of Sitagroi and Dikili Tash, Pentapolis has supplied six dates for two EBA phases, which agree with the Sitagroi IVIVa 14C sequence.-357 Combining the stratigraphic sequences of the three sites, a sub- division of the Early Bronze Age into two phases is possible. An earlier phase in which "channeled" ware is a well-known feature (Sitagroi IV-Va, Dikili Tash IIIA, Pentapolis I; ca. 3200-2500 B.C.) is roughly contemporaneous with EH I/II, and a later phase (Sit- agroi Vb, Dikili Tash IIIB, Pentapolis II; ca. 2500-2200 B.C.) with late EH II/III.35 It has not been possible, however, to identify a stratigraphically distinct MBA phase nor an early LBA phase, before 1400 B.C. Three '4C dates covering the period 1200-1000 B.C. were obtained from the LBA settlement of Angista. The samples came from deposits that contained a few sherds of LH IIIC type.359 31' For a recent summary, see Wardle 1993 (supra n. 299). Also Cambitoglou and Papadopoulos, in Zerner et al.

Outside these areas, large parts of the region appear blank, but this reflects the intensity of research and lack of systematic re- porting rather than the preferences of prehistoric communities.361 The number of sites increases through the Neolithic, and, after a sharp decline and discontinuity during the Early Bronze Age, sites reach the highest number for all periods during the Late Bronze Age. A few LN and Bronze Age sites are caves.361 These general trends are observed in both the Serres and Drama basins. In the Neolithic period, settlements tend to be located on the lower terraces, in areas providing light arable along with other types of land. In the Serres basin, more than half of the known sites are abandoned at the end of the Neo- lithic, and the number of sites in the Drama basin also declines. In the later Bronze Age, however, sites are established on higher ground with less light ar- able around and further away from the plain. At the same time, conspicuous locations on hilltops are se- lected.6"2 The occupation of higher ground is a fa- miliar LBA trait from the other regions discussed above, but whether it reflects an increase in antag- onism and warfare or an economic decision is at pres- ent difficult to determine.363 The limited evidence is also not particularly helpful for defining regional hierarchical structures, such as those suggested for central Macedonia. Perhaps the rarity here of the large and distinctively high settlements seen in cen- tral Macedonia is a sign of diverging social trajec- tories between the two areas.364 Recent Projects Dikili Tash (fig. 2:35). Excavations at Dikili Tash started in 1961 as a joint Greek-French project, and with long intermissions continue to date.365 The mound is situated near a rich spring, at the edge of an extensive marshland, drained in recent times. The actual depth of the deposits and the extent of the settlement are among the problems investigated by recent work at the site. Geomorphological research at the present edge of the mound has shown that the archaeological deposits alternated with alluvial lake deposits, signifying the fluctuating levels of the marshland. 66 The stratigraphy of the mound, already established by early excavations, is divided into four main phases that cover the Late Neolithic (Dikili Tash I-II), the Early Bronze Age (Dikili Tash III), and the Late Bronze Age (Dikili Tash IV), with hiatuses between 6"" The area of the Nestos delta was surveyed for pre- historic sites during excavations at Paradeisos. The absence of sites in the area is taken to indicate a large-scale infill- ing from alluviation: P.

Many hearths and ovens were found, but it is unclear whether they were located inside or outside houses. One feature deserves special notice: a potter's firing pit, found partly sunk in a floor, together with a large pit filled with ashes and another filled with clay, a silo filled with carbonized lentils, and two mysterious joined cavities. The as- semblage belongs to Dikili Tash I. The firing pit had a single chamber containing deformed pots, char- coal, and ashes.369 Apart from its contents, it re- sembles the common ovens found at the site, which implies that firing pottery was within the capacities of the regular household. Recent excavations on the eastern plateau, below the top of the mound, have yielded complete plans of post-buildings arranged in regular rows, with oc- casional indications of an upper story. The houses are 10 m long x 5 m wide and are separated by nar- row lanes.371 This architecture was dated to the lat- est part of Dikili Tash II and provides the only in- formation on the layout of a Neolithic settlement in eastern Macedonia. In another sector of the ex- cavation, a thick destruction level of the early LN period was uncovered. The remains of pise houses of undetermined plan, again with ovens and silos, were explored.371 Over a final destruction deposit on the eastern plateau, dating to the end of the Late Neolithic, sparse remains of EBA occupation were preserved, including post-built houses equipped with pits and horseshoe-shaped ovens. A long post-built house with internal partitions, at least 12 m long, was found there.72 It was rebuilt at least three times, the last probably with a stone socle. Two hearths were located at the two ends and during the last phase the house was equipped with a stone platform. A street sep- arated it from another house to the north. At the top of the mound, five occupation phases were iden- tified through successive floors with hearths and ov- ens, but no house plans could be determined. EBA activity at the base of the mound is indicated by re- cent finds, but occupation on the mound itself dur- ing that period was possibly more limited than pre- viously, as the absence of EBA deposits on the southern slope indicates.373 Another long apsidal building at the top of the mound is the sole structure dated to the Late Bronze Age. The building was constructed of mudbricks and was at least 10 x 4 m in size. Most remarkable were two elliptical plaques of clay, placed on an earlier floor, lying opposite one another, near the long walls of the building.374 They had a square hollow in the middle filled with ashes, two round bowls on each side, and were decorated with parallel curvilinear grooves running around the edge of the plaques. Part of a clay figurine and several spindle whorls have also been reported from the building, which was de- stroyed twice by fire.'75 Notable is the suggested use of flint from the Dan- ube area for the flaked tool industry at the end of the Neolithic, while obsidian was represented by very few pieces. Copper objects were present in LN and EBA levels in very small numbers. Finally, a variety of objects made of bone, lead, shell, and clay were found mainly in the Neolithic deposits of the site."76 Sitagroi (fig. 2:32).

The results in this respect were revolutionary for the whole of southeastern Europe and, since the completion of fieldwork in 1970, have been discussed repeatedly, despite the fact that the first volume of the final pub- lication appeared only in 1986. We shall not, there- fore, deal extensively with these results.377 The ex- cavation focused also on the placement of the prehistoric settlement in its broader palaeoeconomic context, thus carrying on a tradition seen earlier at Nea Nikomedeia. In the deep trenches excavated at Sitagroi, only clay floors could be identified for the Neolithic phases. No substantial parts of buildings or features were unearthed, except for a number of hearths, pits, and the occasional wall of pise or posts. The general pattern of habitation is suggested by the stratigra- phy of the deep trench ZA, where house floors were found alternating with layers described as middens. In this- admittedly small- area, habitation was not continuous, and occasional, short-term abandon- ment may have taken place. This possibility finds support in the results of phosphate and particle-size analyses of the sediments.37' More information is available for the layout of the settlement during the Early Bronze Age. Houses were as a rule built of posts and elongated, possibly following a single orientation and regular layout.379 During phase Va, houses at the top were probably closely packed together.38s The apsidal "Burnt House" of that phase was 8 m long, with a concen- tration of food-processing and long-term storage fa- cilities inside the apse. Various domestic activities were indicated by the presence of a hearth, and a number of vessels and tools in the main room.381 The "Long House" (at least 15.5 m long) of phase Vb, in the same area, preserved less information, with the exception of a stone shaft-hole ax head and sev- eral intramural infant burials. During the same phase, evidence from trenches away from the top indicates the existence of similarly long buildings and possibly a less packed arrangement of habitation. In the eroded uppermost level, traces of intensive storage and other domestic activities were not connected to house remains. Habitation continued after the late EBA phase, but no architectural remains have been found associated with the mixed deposits.382 It is not possible to correlate changes observed in the regional settlement pattern with changes in the pattern of habitation at Sitagroi. The vertical strategy of the excavation precludes obtaining infor- mation about changes in the general layout of the settlement, density of habitation, or architectural features. Consequently, the proposition that, during the Sitagroi III phase, a demographic growth at the settlement level should be correlated through nucle- ation to a decrease in the total number of sites in the Drama basin certainly needs further support.383 The Neolithic pottery of Sitagroi - especially that of phase III- is very rich in decoration and tech- nically advanced.384 Its distribution over an exten- sive area possibly signifies the existence of long- distance exchange networks, parallel to exchange networks of raw materials such as metal, flint, etc., but also perhaps foodstuffs. At the present level of research, it is impossible to place these potentially interconnected networks into a wider social and eco- nomic context, similar to that discussed in Thessaly, nor is it possible to define more closely their specific content and extent. Equally poorly understood are the consequences or causes of a shift in orientation toward the Aegean at the end of the Early Bronze Age, evident in the similarities in pottery from both areas, and, more importantly, in the occurrence of tin alloys.385 Toumba Dramas/Arkadikos (fig. 2:33).386 A brief ex- cavation at Arkadikos, near the town of Drama, was conducted in 1991.

The site of Dimitra lies on a Neogene formation very close to the Angitis River alluvium, in the Serres basin. Two trenches were dug to investigate the stratigraphy. The Neolithic se- quence was divided into three phases (Dimitra I-III), corresponding to phases I-III of Sitagroi, and hab- itation levels were also found dating to the Late Bronze Age (Dimitra IV). Very little was discovered in respect to architecture except for a LBA house/ retaining wall associated with a destruction deposit. A wealth of material came from the Neolithic strata, including gold and copper beads from all phases, Spondylus rings and beads, and a good sample of bio- archaeological material, which was systematically collected.3s8 Two 14C dates from phase I appear ex- tremely high in relation to the Sitagroi I dates.389 Pentapolis (fig. 2:28). A small-scale excavation was conducted at the low mound (2.5 m high) of Pentap- olis in the central part of the Serres basin. The site is situated on the middle terraces surrounding the plain, in a landscape of high erosional activity and dominated by conglomerates and red clays. The brief excavation produced deposits showing two phases dated to the Early Bronze Age, and traces of later, LBA habitation, which have been eroded. A series of 4C dates confirmed a chronological overlap with Sitagroi IV and V. The small trench preserved re- mains of mudbrick walls, floors, a hearth, and a clay bin.3990 Stathmos Angistas (fig. 2:31). Stathmos Angistas is a tell on the summit of a hill rising ca. 45 m above the surrounding alluvial valley of the Angitis River. Since the center of the Bronze Age settlement had been destroyed by a Macedonian tomb, LBA levels were explored only near the western edge of the site. The excavation revealed two main LBA strata.391 Mudbrick terraces supported the edge, while floors with pithoi, clay bins, hearths, and an oven belonged to roughly rectangular houses with mudbrick walls. Handmade pottery, in plain coarse, coarse with plas- tic decoration, burnished, incised, and occasional painted and graphite-coated wares, comprised the majority of the ceramics. In addition a small amount of wheelmade Mycenaean pottery was found (0.08%). The two phases were dated by the presence of LH IIIA2/B and LH IIIC pottery, respectively. The pres- ence of Mycenaean pottery along with the terraced formation of the mound gives Stathmos Angistas a "central Macedonian" appearance.392 Paradeisos (fig. 2:36). A small excavation was con- ducted for one month in 1976 at Paradeisos, situ- ated strategically on the right bank of the Nestos River. Deposits were 1.7 m deep and belong mainly to the LN period, contemporary with Sitagroi III. Thin EBA deposits were also found, and LBA pot- tery on the surface testifies to the long life of the settlement.393 New Questions As a result of sound fieldwork, analysis, and pub- lication since the late 1960s, eastern Macedonia offers a chrono-typological framework for the Neolithic and Early Bronze Age that is more complete and secure 387 K.

In this respect, it offers a useful example for other re- gions with longer histories of research. Major issues that occupied the previous generation of archaeol- ogists have been elucidated, and it would not be an exaggeration to say that the data from this area could be used with care as safe time pegs to assist the clar- ification of difficult chronological problems, even in areas as far removed as Thessaly. There is an ur- gent need, however, for the extension of the chrono- typological framework to include the later Bronze Age, for which information is minimal. We now understand many aspects of the palaeoenvironment, but work done in the 1970s on the interaction be- tween settlement and environment needs to be con- tinued in a more intensive form. Finally, it is time to start translating the well-known cultural features of the region into human terms by investigating the changing relationships within and between eastern Macedonian communities, an aspect of prehistoric life that at present is very little understood. THRACE Greek Thrace is generally absent from reviews of Aegean prehistory. This is surprising since one would think that both the Rodopi plain to the south as well as the lower Evros valley to the east would attract researchers interested in prehistoric interaction among Anatolia, the Aegean, and the Balkans. Nev- ertheless, it was only a few years ago that a prehis- toric excavation of some scale was undertaken by the Archaeological Service, which has also conducted smaller-scale excavations of early sites in the area.394 No secure stratified sequence has been sufficiently published for any period of western Thrace. In the absence of 14C dates, comparisons with the material culture from sites in eastern Macedonia, southern Bulgaria, and the northeastern Aegean offer the only basis for dating archaeological assemblages. Recent excavations at the site of Makri promise to rectify the situation for the Neolithic period by providing a more secure stratigraphy for the fifth and early fourth millennium B.C. than is presently provided by Paradimi, and may offer evidence for even earlier Neolithic occupation. Dating problems are more se- vere for the period 3500-1000 B.C. due to a general dearth of excavated sites and the absence of long, continuous stratigraphies. Previously known sites with Neolithic and occa- sional EBA occupation are primarily mounds along the edges of the plain and near the coast, and caves with sparse traces of intermittent occupation from Late Neolithic to historical times.395 Only recently have less conspicuous sites, some in elevated areas, been discovered, indicating at least for some peri- ods more varied patterns of habitation than were suspected in the past. The preliminary results of a recent joint project conducted by the Ephoreia of Komotini, the Uni- versity of Thessaloniki, and A. Ammerman for the investigation of the plain of Rodopi and adjacent areas offer additional reasons for the general scar- city of prehistoric sites in the area. Eustatic sea-level rise, large-scale alluviation in deltaic areas and along floodplains, and the late formation of Lake Vistonis in the western part of the plain, though not accu- rately datable, possibly prohibit the recovery of pre- historic sites other than large mounds. Geomorpho- logical changes may also have rendered large parts of the lowlands unattractive for occupation during certain periods of the prehistoric past. On the other hand, exploration of the Pleistocene terraces along the southeastern edge of the area identified a con- centration of sites, some of small size, belonging to various prehistoric periods, including a few Middle Palaeolithic and several LN sites..'6 Whether the geomorphological changes were initiated by human activity and whether occupation of the Pleistocene terraces was related to economic and political pro- cesses are questions for future research.

Sakellariou. Bakalakis dug a small control trench (7 x 1 m) in 1965 to check the stra- tigraphy of the tell and correlate the abundant ma- terial produced by the earlier excavations with specific strata. The 4.5-m stratigraphy of Paradimi was divided into four main Neolithic phases, cov- ering the span from the end of the Middle Neolithic to the Final Neolithic (roughly equivalent to phases Sitagroi I-III), and one phase belonging to the Early Bronze Age. The publication is heavily biased toward pottery, and gives little information on the settle- ment. The pottery comprises dark-faced vessels with carinated shapes, "black-topped" and "channeled" wares in the earlier phases, and graphite decoration as well as some "black on red" in the later Neolithic deposits.397 Paradimi is a well-known site, although the level of research hardly justifies its prominent position in the literature. The recent publication gives a some- what clearer view of the evidence, but does not war- rant the view that the Paradimi "culture" is unique, with features demonstrating its position at a cross- roads between east and west, north and south.398 Similar views have been expressed about Macedonia as a whole, and even Thessaly (see above); they are based, however, on perceptions of the geopolitical position of the sites and regions in question rather than on archaeological evidence. Proskinites (fig. 2:39). A brief excavation at a site 5 km from the coast, near the village of Proskinites, south of Komotini, explored ca. 3.5-m-deep Neolithic deposits. The low mound is fairly large, ca. 8 ha, and is located at the boundary between the limestone hills and the Pleistocene terrace. The two 4 x 4 m trenches uncovered only elusive structural elements, probably from post-framed houses, more substantial remains of clay-lined pits, and rich furnishings in the form of pottery and other implements, includ- ing a rich repertoire of chipped stone, mainly from local chert and flint, and several large ground stone tools. Ceramic vessels, mainly monochrome or dec- orated with channeling, reportedly resemble the rep- ertoires from Paradimi I-II, a few kilometers to the north, and the more distant site of Sitagroi I-II.399 Makri (fig. 2:42). The mound of Makri, 11 km west of Alexandroupolis, is typical of Neolithic sites in the area. It is located on a rocky outcrop rising ca. 50 masl on the face of which opens a cave with sparse remains of habitation from different periods. The mound is fairly small but trial trenches up to 50 m away from its base on the north side have uncovered habitation deposits underneath several meters of re- cent alluvium, indicating a settlement of ca. 1 ha. Some 200 m further north another trial trench re- vealed, beneath 2.50 m of alluvium, a deposit with flakes and tools yet no pottery, provisionally inter- preted as a flint-knapping floor, not necessarily re- lated to the main settlement.400 The site was also occupied in the historical period and the Bronze Age, but the prehistoric remains in the 250-m2 excavated area belong exclusively to the Neolithic period. The 4-m-deep deposits of the set- tlement have been assigned to two periods, Makri I and II, separated by a destruction deposit and end- ing in a uniform destruction horizon. Monochrome pottery prevailed in both phases, with occasional in- cisions or impressions in Makri I, and rare painted "white-on-red" pottery was also found. In Makri II, monochrome pottery continued to be produced, with clays taken from six local sources; carinated shapes appeared along with channeled decoration.401 Ef- stratiou assigns the later phase to the period covered by phases I-II at Sitagroi and Paradimi I-III, and attributes the rarity of painted pottery to regional variation. It is proposed that Makri I could date to a period earlier than Sitagroi I, possibly going back into the Early Neolithic, suggesting a closer connec- tion with recently discovered assemblages in east- ern Thrace and Anatolia.402 The possibly early date of the site is a new devel- opment for the prehistory of the northern Aegean.

Buildings in Makri II were constructed with frames of posts with occasional use of mudbricks and stone. Traces of a possible stone enceinte wall need further clarification, but more important for the understand- ing of community organization is the concentration of storage facilities in the form of several clay bins and a large plastered pit in a central part of the set- tlement. The area, presumably roofed, was 60 m2 in extent and was also furnished with a clay platform and three conical objects that have been alternatively interpreted as horns of consecration or as fire-stands. It is suggested that the complex may represent a com- munal storage area or centralized storage controlled by an elite. Information, however, on the general lay- out of the settlement is still insufficient, and no com- plete house plans have yet been documented. Nev- ertheless, numerous floors have been uncovered, often plastered and preserving a rich inventory of finds and features. Finally, there is evidence for the practice of intramural adult burial.403 Information on EBA patterns of occupation and material culture is sparse. It has been suggested that habitation continued in some of the earlier mounds and that affinities with the material culture from the northeastern Aegean and southern Bulgaria are dis- played.404 A major change has been recognized in the pattern of settlement during the Late Bronze Age. New sites were established during that period on eminent, naturally protected hilltops, away from the plain, in the upland areas near or away from the coast. 405 Two of the excavated sites, Ay. Georgios Ma- roneias and Asar Tepe (Kremasti Erganis) (fig. 2:40- 41), both near the southeastern edge of the plain, also display large enceinte stone walls (ca. 1.40 m thick), with protected entrances and towers. More importantly, they contain areas segregated by addi- tional walling at the very top, and rectangular or el- liptical buildings inside. However, at Mourgana (fig. 2:37), another recently excavated small site, the post- framed houses were only protected by the precipitous natural formation of the hill.406 The appearance of monumental constructions, the spatial segregation observed in some settlements, and the differences in construction and layout between settlements may imply changes in the sociopolitical organization of Thracian LBA communities. The low quality of cur- rent field data, however, prevents any detailed under- standing of these new developments or of the pro- cesses that brought them about. Several issues remain open, such as the accurate dating of the enceinte walls or the economic implications of the shift in settlement to the upland areas. EPIRUS Epirus (fig. 3) is mountainous, difficult to explore and, because of ubiquitous steep grades, its landscape is subject to intense erosion and deposition. Field- work has been erratic. In view of those conditions, it is not surprising that few Neolithic sites are known in the province. It may in fact be more surprising that as many as 10-15 Neolithic sites are known.407 A few are caves- that is, relatively stable, protected microenvironments. Others, masked by recently de- posited sediments, were discovered "by chance," dur- ing construction of soccer fields or drainage ditches; they would have been undetectable by conventional surface surveys, however intensive. Such facts under- line the rarity of stable areas in the Epirotic land- scape, where Neolithic settlements might be easy to come upon. Remote sensing, in conjunction with GIS applications, should one day prove very useful in identifying surfaces, either buried or eroding, that 403 A. Agelarakis and N.

Epirus. Principal sites mentioned in the text. Contours at 500 and 900 masl. were settled in various phases during the Neo- lithic.408 Noteworthy, however, is the absence of Neolithic mound sites. That may suggest that settlements were relatively ephemeral, buildings were dispersed, lim- ited use was made of earthen materials for construc- tion, and/or that population density was never very high. By no means does it compel us to project the "Sarakatsani model" of pastoralism and transhu- mance onto the Neolithic;409 the model is best re- served for the historical period or, at the earliest, for the Late Bronze Age. The most interesting Neolithic find of recent years is a modest structure, dated to the range 3600-3100 B.C. (four 14C dates), in the Doliana basin (ca. 300 masl; fig. 3:1). Here, in the vicinity of the headwaters of the Kalamas River,410 excavations by the IB' Ephoreia uncovered two superimposed "hut" floors (4.5 x 3.5 m) in association with hearths, an abun- dance of potsherds, and animal bone- a distinctive assemblage, without known parallels in the Neolithic and Early Bronze Age of Epirus.411 The excavators named this assemblage "Doliana," cautiously also comparing the ceramics with those of Chalcolithic sites in Albania (Maliq phase IIb and Tren).412 A pol- len core from Gramousti, a former lake bottom 500 m west of the site, had previously been analyzed. The results are at odds with the archaeological record: forest reduction both preceded and, especially, fol- lowed the known Neolithic occupation, while in the 408 These are the research strategies employed by the Nikopolis Project, a current joint venture of Boston Uni- versity, the IB' Ephoreia, and the 8th Ephoreia of Byzan- tine Antiquities:J.

The Nikopolis Project has preliminarily reported ca. 20 secure Bronze Age sites in the lowlands of southwestern Epirus, many of them largely buried, and exposed only in road cuts and other scarps.414 Two of those sites yielded 14C dates within the sec- ond millennium B.C., but a ceramic chrono-typology remains an elusive objective. Bronze Age settlement appears to have been extensive in the vicinity of small coastal plains, such as the Acheron River mouth. A walled acropolis in "Cyclopaean" masonry, Xylokastra (or Ephyra), has been known in that area for some time (fig. 3:3);415 the Nikopolis Project now adds possible terrace walls in the same masonry. Myce- naean ceramics are rare (ca. 50 out of 2,500 Bronze Age sherds) throughout the survey area. A reconstruc- tion of the LBA site distribution with regard to land resources in southwestern Epirus ought to be within reach when the study of the survey data progresses.416 An important question concerns the nature of the acropolis at Xylokastra. Is it a Mycenaean "fort;' or "trading post:' comparable in its functions (at least initially) to, for example, the forts established by Eu- ropeans in North America in the 16th century and later? Or is it the material mark of an indigenous social transformation, indicating the emergence of a line of chiefs, who engaged in transactions with the polities of southern Greece, and managed to em- ulate some of their ways? The existence of burial tu- muli within the acropolis, and of a tholos tomb at Kiperi (fig. 3:4), 10 km away,417 is compatible with either of these scenarios. Authorities have as a rule favored the first scenario,418 but the quality of evi- dence from the excavations at Xylokastra is less than satisfactory, and the interpretative efforts have been speculative. The site may, for example, have been a port of call along a probable "amber route"''41 (and it even yielded an amber bead),420 but only well-designed fieldwork could substantiate such speculations. As is well known, in the latter half of the second millennium B.C. quantities of bronze, especially in the form of weapons, were deposited in graves and buried as hoards throughout Epirus.421 The pattern seems to set Epirus largely apart from the other provinces examined in this review, but its signifi- cance has yet to be fully realized. For some, those deposits constitute evidence for "pastoralist warriors or chieftains whose appreciation of fine craftsman- ship and wide-ranging contacts enabled them to ob- tain suitable weapons."422 Recent interpretations of somewhat analogous patterns in other periods and regions are geared to broader questions, and are in- formed by more sophisticated premises, such as the macroeconomic distinctions between "core" and "periphery,' and between "gift" and "commodity" To A. and S. Sherratt, for example, the ritual deposition of metal might indicate a political economy that is out of step with the LBA Aegean "core,' yet is already transformed by it through a "contagious process' the spread of the "desire for luxuries" among local elites.423 S.

They also -especially Shennan's - are aimed at interpreting thoroughly re- searched portions of the European archaeological record, and take into account a multitude of strands of local evidence.425 For Epirus, the problem seems to be far more basic and discomforting: a scarcity of field data. The underdevelopment of prehistoric research-a chronic condition-has stunted prog- ress. The archaeological imagination has always been resourceful in Epirus. It is time, however, for inten- sive fieldwork. A NOTE ON THE EARLIEST NEOLITHIC Good analytical work on the evidence for the ear- liest Neolithic in Greece has recently been published by Perles.426 The conclusion once more weighs heavi- ly on the side of an allochthonous origin, and on colonization from the Near East. For Thessaly, in par- ticular, "neolithisation" is regarded by Perles as a fully exogenous process.427 The Neolithic coloniza- tion of Greece, she further suggests, may not be an isolated event but an extension of a process already attested in the Near East, namely the "PPNB exo- dus.'428 Notwithstanding the reservations Perles her- self has about aspects of the relevant evidence, about her interpretation, and about similar interpretations offered in recent decades, colonization at some scale appears to her to be beyond doubt, as does the (ulti- mately) Near Eastern origin of the colonists. We take a more dim view of the evidence.429 We think that questions about the earliest Neolithic in Greece will not be answered by "paper-and-pencil" operations but by fresh fieldwork. Exercises such as Perles's have great analytical merit. The conclusions, however, can be only as good as the evidence upon which they rest, and here one meets with serious problems. For example, no northern Greek province (not even Thessaly)430 has been researched thor- oughly enough to justify the inference that it was uninhabited during the Pleistocene/Holocene transi- tion and during the ensuing one or two millennia. The recent discoveries of probable Mesolithic sites in coastal Epirus,431 and the tantalizing 14C dates and finds from Theopetra Cave underline precisely this point. True, we cannot imagine that scores of Meso- lithic sites will be discovered throughout northern Greece in the future; yet- it is worth remembering- the factors responsible for their scarcity in our rec- ords are not very well understood. Have we, for in- stance, been searching for Mesolithic sites in the wrong places? The pattern for the entire southern Balkan peninsula- if one can call ca. 15, widely dis- persed, for the most part poorly dated occurrences a pattern - suggests a preference for locations near the (former) coast and other bodies of water. This observation will, no doubt, encourage some to invoke (once more) submergence and burial by alluviation as the reasons for the invisibility of the Mesolithic in northern Greece. Our aim is different, however- 424 S. Shennan, "Commodities, Transactions, and Growth in the Central-European Bronze Age,"Journal of European Archaeology 1:2 (1993) 59-72, esp. 66. 425 It is in fact impossible to do justice to Shennan's ar- gument (supra n. 424) without frequent reference to the rich data base for the Early Bronze Age in Central Europe. 426 Perles 1989 (supra n. 8) 109-27; Perles (supra n. 136) 642-49; Perles and Vitelli (supra n. 147) 226-33; Demoule and Perles (supra n. 115), esp. 364-65. See also Bloedow (supra n. 8). 427 van Andel and Runnels (supra n. 133) further am- plify this view. See also Runnels 1995 (supra n. 136) 725. A different model, involving "borrowings" and interaction between colonizers and local Mesolithic groups, is envis- aged for Franchthi and, perhaps, for Sidari: Perles 1989 (supra n. 8) 117-20; Perles (supra n. 136) 646. 428 PerlTs (supra n. 136) 648-49; J. Cauvin, "La neolith- isation au Levant et sa premiere diffusion," in Aurenche and Cauvin (supra n. 8), esp. 14-24. 429 Papers and comments on the earliest Neolithic in Europe-a veritable industry since the 1980s-as a rule cover very large areas (e.g., the whole of Greece, the Bal- kans, or the entire continent). Such broad perspectives are dictated by the need for comparative treatment, but also by the scarcity of data pertinent to particular, relatively small regions. We cannot in this review delve into the larger picture and theoretical controversies for we must limit our- selves primarily to the evidence from northern Greece.

Both the Epirotic and the Thracian finds are from surface sur- veys; their chronology is as yet problematic.</page><page sequence="61">1996] THE NEOLITHIC AND BRONZE AGE OF NORTHERN GREECE 597 to direct future research to promising coastal spots and other areas rich in aquatic resources. A second problematic area is the paucity of data from very early Neolithic sites in northern Greece - sites that, according to calibrated 14C dates, were probably occupied ca. 6500 B.C. or earlier yet.432 We concur with Perles's assertion4 3 that the chipped stone industry of"preceramic" Argissa (and Sesklo) has a distinctly Neolithic, rather than Mesolithic, character.44 We find it methodologically unsound, however, to generalize from just two sites to the en- tire province of Thessaly. In short, the sample for Thessaly ca. 6500 B.C. is at this moment pitifully small to permit inferences of regional significance with regard to the nature and origin of the earliest Neo- lithic. Nothing militates against the possibility that some of the province's ca. 120 recorded EN sites conceal deposits roughly contemporary with those of "preceramic" Argissa and Sesklo, and that such deposits contain a chipped stone industry compa- rable to that of "aceramic" Franchthi. There are further problems, including problems with chronology.435 Demic diffusion from the Near East is considered the sole process by which Neolithic culture reached northern Greece, but was it? The evidence in favor of a positive answer is not as con- siderable as is currently thought.436 But we wish to speculate no further, either about the earliest Neo- lithic of Thessaly, or about the "absence" of late seventh/early sixth millennium sites in Greek cen- tral and eastern Macedonia, and Thrace.437 Rigor- ous, persistent fieldwork is in order. We only hope that the next wave of excavations into the Early Neo- lithic of northern Greece will be carried out by people who understand the difference between "strata" and deposits, people who, unlike our pre- decessors, will not subscribe to the "layer cake" view of the archaeological record (and of culture and his- tory), and will be knowledgeable about, and atten- tive to, site formation processes. We also hope that they will document the data obtained from their re- searches in clear and incontrovertible ways.

MilojEic's notion of"Stein- gerate" may have been less inclusive than ours today, and his collection strategy may have systematically favored the discovery of pressure-flaked blades, at the expense of the products of a flake industry, such as those that later be- came known from, e.g., "aceramic" Franchthi. The same reservations may also hold for Theocharis's work. 35- Of eight '4C dates available from the earliest Thes- salian Neolithic (the "preceramic"), three have appeared, without comment, in a table only: Coleman 209 (the dates are those from Argissa, with the prefix "H"); another two (UCLA-1657A and UCLA-1657D) are entangled in bizarre histories: Bloedow (supra n. 8) 50-53; no context for any of the eight dates has been adequately published. For dis- turbing problems with the dates from EN Achilleion as well, see Nandris (supra n. 119). Furthermore, we are doubt- ful that 14C dates obtained early in the history of radio- carbon dating can be calibrated with confidence in the results. 43 Cf.
