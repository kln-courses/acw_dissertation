<plain_text><page sequence="1">From Hardy to Empson. The Swerve of the Modern MICHAEL L. JOHNSON IN THE ANXIETY OF INFLUENCE: A Theory of Poety, by now generally considered a venerable volume in the canon of the "herme- neutical Mafia" associated with Yale University, Harold Bloom dis- cusses six categories of poetic influence or "revisionary ratios that govern intra-poetic relations" (8) in order "to de-idealize our accepted accounts of how one poet helps to form another" (5). Using a word borrowed from the ancient mystery cults, he terms one of the categories the tessera, which refers to a pattern of influence whereby "A poet antithetically 'completes' his precursor, by so reading the parent-poem as to retain its terms but to mean them in another sense, as though the precursor had failed to go far enough" (14). Bloom notes that the poetry of Wallace Stevens "abounds in tesserae, for antithetical completion is his central relation to his American Romantic precursors" (67). He offers "The Owl in the Sarcophagus," Stevens's elegy for his friend Henry Church, as an example of a poem that manifests a tessera in relation to Walt Whitman's "The Sleepers," and he argues that, among other things, "Where Whitman identifies night and the mother with good death, Stevens establishes an identity between good death and a larger maternal vision, opposed to night because she contains all the memora- ble evidence of change ..." (68).' The whole argument is brief, but it does cogently illustrate one of Bloom's categories. At the conclusion of that argument, however, Bloom makes a most interesting point, one that he does not elaborate with much evidential detail: "It seems true that British poets swerve from their precursors, while American poets labor rather to 'complete' their fathers. The British are more genuinely revisionists of one another, but we (or at least most of our post-Emersonian poets) tend to see our fathers as not having dared enough" (68). The "swerve" or clinamen, as Bloom more officially denominates this category with a word borrowed from Lucre-</page><page sequence="2">Michael L. Johnson tius's De rerum natura (where "it means a 'swerve' of the atoms so as to make change possible in the universe"), refers to "poetic misreading or misprision proper," a pattern of influence whereby "A poet swerves away from his precursor, by so reading his precursor's poem as to execute a clinamen in relation to it." That action "appears as a corrective movement in his own poem, which implies that the precursor poem went accurately up to a certain point, but then should have swerved, precisely in the direction that the new poem moves" (14). The clinamen typically entails a "reductiveness" that Bloom describes as "a kind of misprision that is a radical misinterpretation in which the precursor is regarded as an over-idealizer." Thus, "As the poets swerve downward in time, they deceive themselves into believing they are tougher-minded than their precursors" (69). In reference to his point concerning British and American poets, Bloom alludes to instances of clinamen in the works of Yeats in relation to those of Blake and Shelley, in the works of Lawrence in relation to those of Hardy and Whitman, and so on, but he does not present and consider in detail an instance that would exemplify the clinamen for two British poets in a manner analogous to that in which the instance noted earlier exemplifies the tessera for two American poets. Consideration of such an instance would not only exemplify the clinamen more fully and help distinguish it (explicitly) from the tessera and (implicitly) from his other categories but would also corroborate Bloom's interesting distinc- tion between British and American patterns of poetic influence. More- over, it would demonstrate a kind of characteristically (though not exclusively) British "anxiety" marking the largely blurred interface of premodern and modern poetry, an anxiety analogous to its American counterpart as exemplified in the relation between the aforementioned poems by Whitman and Stevens - and perhaps lead finally to a clinamen of my own. Such an instance, a tremendously suggestive one in regard to the criteria posited above, may be found in a comparison of a "premodern" poem by Thomas Hardy, "A Plaint to Man," written from 1909 to 1910, and a "modern" poem by William Empson, "This Last Pain," written in the early 1930s. Hardy's poem, written in terza rima (one of Empson's favorite stanzaic forms) with a concluding couplet, shows his usual avoidance of "the jewelled line" through a self-conscious rhythmic cragginess. Its persona is one of Hardy's versions of an anthropo- morphic god, who speaks to man generally: When you slowly emerged from the den of Time And gained percipience as you grew, 48</page><page sequence="3">South Atlantic Review And fleshed you fair out of shapeless slime, Wherefore, O Man, did there come to you The unhappy need of creating me - A form like your own -for praying to? My virtue, power, utility, Within my maker must all abide, Since none in myself can ever be, One thin as a phasm on a lantern-slide Shown forth in the dark upon some dim sheet, And by none but its showman vivified. "Such a forced device," you may say, "is meet For easing a loaded heart at whiles: Man needs to conceive of a mercy-seat Somewhere above the gloomy aisles Of this wailful world, or he could not bear The irk no local hope beguiles." -But since I was framed in your first despair The doing without me has had no play In the minds of men when shadows scare; And now that I dwindle day by day Beneath the deicide eyes of seers In a light that will not let me stay, And to-morrow the whole of me disappears, The truth should be told, and the fact be faced That had best been faced in earlier years: The fact of life with dependence placed On the human heart's resource alone, In brotherhood bonded close and graced With loving-kindness fully blown, And visioned help unsought, unknown. (325-26) Empson's poem, written in quatrains consisting of pentameter and 49</page><page sequence="4">Michael L. Johnson tetrameter couplets, shows a more regular rhythmic structure (as well as a more intricate and elliptical play of syntactic and semantic structure). Its persona is a human being who is only a slight lyrical projection from the poet himself and who also speaks (perhaps with some inconsistency or shifting of address) to man generally: This last pain for the damned the Fathers found: "They knew the bliss with which they were not crowned." Such, but on earth, let me foretell, Is all, of heaven or of hell. Man, as the prying housemaid of the soul, May know her happiness by eye to hole: He's safe; the key is lost; he knows Door will not open, nor hole close. "What is conceivable can happen too," Said Wittgenstein, who had not dreamt of you; But wisely; if we worked it long We should forget where it was wrong. Those thorns are crowns which, woven into knots, Crackle under and soon boil fool's pots; And no man's watching, wise and long, Would ever stare them into song. Thorns bur to a consistent ash, like man; A splendid cleanser for the frying-pan: And those who leap from pan to fire Should this brave opposite admire. All those large dreams by which men long live well Are magic-lanterned on the smoke of hell; This then is real, I have implied, A painted, small, transparent slide. These the inventive can hand-paint at leisure, Or most emporia would stock our measure; And feasting in their dappled shade We should forget how they were made. Feign then what's by a decent tact believed 50</page><page sequence="5">South Atlantic Review And act that state is only so conceived, And build an edifice of form For house where phantoms may keep warm. Imagine, then, by miracle, with me, (Ambiguous gifts, as what gods give must be) What could not possibly be there, And learn a style from a despair. (32-33) Both poems, separately, have been ably interpreted by others, so I will labor the reader with my own interpretations only to the extent necessary to establish, through comparison, the components of the clinamen that Empson's poem effects in relation to Hardy's. First, however, let me deal with the issue of the possibility of the direct influence, as conventionally understood, of Hardy's poem on Emp- son's. After a first reading-and more so after several-the poems seem remarkably alike in a number of ways. Their thematic concerns are quite similar: both involve authoritative statements about the illusory nature of the objects of religious belief, specifically about Western man's vision of a Christian deity (a deity that, as J. Hillis Miller and others have noted, began growing progressively more and more troublingly tenuous, at least for some writers, in the nineteenth century); both conclude by qualifying difficult disillusionment with a kind of op- timism, somewhat traditionally humanistic in Hardy's poem (one of the most optimistic in the 1914 edition of Satires of Circumstance), more complexly poised and existentialistic in Empson's. The vocabulary of Empson's poem, though obviously conditioned by a different context, echoes that of Hardy's noticeably: "despair" occurs in both, as does "form"; "conceivable," "phantom," and "shade" in the former certainly recall, respectively, "conceive," "phasm," and "shadows" in the latter; and so on. A number of rhymes echo too, though probably only accidentally, like the sounds of the titles. And, of course, both poems pivot thematically on strikingly similar variations of the slide show as an image of illusory reality, variations that seem obliquely to allude to the cave allegory in Plato's Republic. This kind of evidence-of which more could be educed--argues strongly that Empson must have had Hardy's poem at hand or at least have had it more or less vividly in mind when he wrote his own. I have no proof that either was the case, and Empson has not been a helpful correspondent about such matters; but I would venture to say that it is a good bet that one or the other was. If so, then the clinamen effected by 51</page><page sequence="6">Michael L. Johnson "This Last Pain" in relation to "A Plaint to Man" may be interpreted as having been quite directly articulated. If not, then that clinamen will have to be interpreted as having been more indirectly articulated, in relation to the precursive poetic attitude embodied more generally in Hardy's poetry. In any case, the question of whether or not Hardy's poem served as a source, in the way in which conventional source-and-influence scholar- ship understands that word, is perhaps only partly relevant. After all, Bloom's systemization of influence, from which my discussion of the clinamen is an extrapolation (one that, true to the American modus of ephebic pretension, is more tessera than clinamen), does not mandate the establishment of such a simple, direct connection. Indeed, the kind of critical quest he proposes is one "of learning to read any poem as its poet's deliberate misinterpretation, as a poet, of a precursor poem or of poetry in general," one of coming to "Know each poem by its clinamen" (43), one, most fundamentally, "of knowing the hidden roads that go from poem to poem" (96). And that quest, as outlined by Bloom's antithetical criticism, must avoid both ontological-semantic tautology ("in which the poem is and means itself') and reductive paraphrasis ("in which the poem means something that is not itself a poem") and embrace the notion that "the meaning of a poem can only be a poem, but another poem-a poem not itself" In order to enter into critical consider- ation, that other poem need be only "any central poem by an indubit- able precursor, even if the ephebe never read that poem." In such a consideration, then, Bloom declares more boldly than I have, "Source study is wholly irrelevant; here we are dealing with primal words, but antithetical meanings, and an ephebe's best interpretations may well be of poems he has never read" (70). Hardy is certainly an "indubitable precursor" of Empson (though one perhaps not as obvious as Donne), as even a cursory comparative reading of their poetic works will demonstrate. Furthermore, Bloom's declaration above, while certainly moot in many regards, has at least a strong intuitive validity, particu- larly given the vague enterprises that all too frequently define the field of conventional source study and the extremely intricate and diffused mechanisms by which literary influence typically operates. My discus- sion, to whose main line of development I now return, is not strictly dependent on the unqualified truth of that declaration-though it is acceptive of the general purport of the statements immediately preced- ing-and should not prove especially question-begging. Both "A Plaint to Man" and "This Last Pain" are centrally con- cerned, the former perhaps more explicitly than the latter, with how scientific vision ("the deicide eyes of seers") has questioned the existence 52</page><page sequence="7">South Atlantic Review of an anthropomorphic god (finally, in both poems, the Christian God, though Hardy makes no explicit mention of Christianity and Empson refers only to "gods" generally near the end of his poem). Both are concerned with how that vision has insisted that man must consider any such god to be a projection of human fantasy and, to live authentically, must depend on merely human resources for understand- ing the universe and ordering his life within it. In Hardy's poem that god still exists tentatively, though his image is being flooded off the screen of projected illusion. Indeed, that god is the persona of the poem, one who foresees the historical situation destined to occasion Empson's poem, that "to-morrow" when "the whole of me disappears ." Hardy is still able to imagine the voice of that god, but Empson swerves from even that meager affirmation of divine ontology in order to accommodate his inherited situation and address it in less comfort- able terms. (Hardy could not forgive God for not existing-an irony with which Empson could sympathize but which he could hardly embrace.) During the time between Hardy's poem and Empson's, scientific vision had become so complex, so epistemologically involuted and fine-tuned, that Empson's poem embodies a far more tentative mode of statement about "All those large dreams by which men long live well ...." In the universe of a disappearing god, Hardy's poem proposes a positive but simplistic alternative for moral order. In the universe of a god wholly vanished, Empson's swerves and proposes a more extreme alternative, one that involves a precarious reliance on an imaginative decorum characterized by "a decent tact." Hardy's poem betrays the poet's underlying fear of indifference (the quality he most dreaded and by which he was most fascinated in the personalities of the idiosyncratic pantheon with which he populated his poems), while Empson's betrays his underlying desire to elevate a carefully equili- brized indifference to the status of a refined attitude of survival, even a way of life, almost a Buddhistic one. (It is noteworthy in this connection that the epigraph for Empson's Collected Poems is the Buddha's "Fire Sermon.") The persona in Hardy's poem calls for a shared feeling of human brotherhood as an anodyne for despair in a universe being stripped of traditional religious values. The persona in Empson's, on the other hand, swerves from that limited and "over-idealized" possibility and calls for a shared intellectual attitude as a way of coping in a universe finally bereft of those values. The antithesis is defined in a sense by the difference between a kind of nostalgic humanism and a kind of prospective existentialism. Hardy's naive persona sees despair as hav- ing given rise to the illusion of an anthropomorphic god and proposes 53</page><page sequence="8">Michael L. Johnson that man can acknowledge that illusion for what it is and replace it with a concrete and compassionate humanism. Empson's sophisticated per- sona, on the other hand, sees despair as arising from the acknowledge- ment of that illusion, from the admission that, as Empson says in his gloss on "This Last Pain," "human nature can conceive divine states which it cannot attain." His persona does not propose that, "though not every ideal that can be imagined can be achieved, man can satisfy himself by pretending that he has achieved it and forgetting that he hasn't" (Empson 102), but that man can learn a style from his despair. That style, a difficult modus vivendi, does not involve a reaching for any simple humanism; rather, it equilibrizes itself tensionally between the poles of what is imaginable (and "could not possibly be there") and what appears to be otherwise verifiably, if problematically, real (the parallel to Hardy's "fact" to "be faced"). Hardy conceives his poem as a sincere statement of truth and an exhortation to action in the face of that truth. Empson conceives his as a statement that is more self- conscious (partly perhaps because subjected to the influence of Har- dy's) and tentative, what his mentor and critical precursor I. A. Richards would call a "pseudo-statement," one justified less by its referential rhetorical power to move its reader than by its perlocu- tionary power to organize a provisional attitude that the reader is invited to share. Hardy offers an alternative that seems to be gener- ously sufficient and even comfortable, though not answering to man's most troubling religious impulses. Empson offers something bleaker and, given the terrible sense of unease tangled through his poem, may share, in the execution of his clinamen, something of the character of Milton's Satan (as Bloom interprets him), who, "organizing his chaos, imposing a discipline despite the visible darkness, calling his minions to emulate his refusal to mourn, becomes the hero as poet, finding what must suffice, while knowing that nothing can suffice" (22). The form of Hardy's poem, no matter how "artificial" or otherwise architectural, is akin to but swerving from the forms typical of his precursors, especially in its deliberate metrical roughness. That of Empson's pretends to an elegant perfection, one not so much reacting against the rough texture of Hardy's - and thereby, in the manner of the tessera, attempting to polish or "complete" it-as swerving free of it, finally, toward the fulfillment of its own performance. Empson's poem might even be interpreted as having begun as a parody of Hardy's and as having thereby achieved the thrust to swerve into a different orbit. And yet, even if Empson's poem did achieve its own orbit, I have the clear intuition that it carries the memory, the "misinterpreted" mean- ing, of Hardy's poem with it. As Bloom says, "A poem is not an 54</page><page sequence="9">South Atlantic Review overcoming of anxiety, but is that anxiety" (94). Or, if Empson's poem were to be interpreted as an evasion of Hardy's, as an evasion of even a parody, then it is perhaps important to remember, in Bloom's words, that "Each poem is an evasion not only of another poem, but also of itself, which is to say that every poem is a misinterpretation of what it might have been" (120). So there are ways in which Hardy's poem looks forward to Empson's and Empson's back to Hardy's. The swerved perspective in which the latter "re-vision" occurs is, as Bloom's earlier generalization would suggest, characteristically British. The unmistakable sense of disjunc- tion between the two poems inheres exactly in Empson's clinamen, his swerve toward concerns that Hardy avoids or is otherwise not prepared to encounter. Hardy's poem prefigures the more problematic concerns with which Empson's has to deal and thus occasions its swerve. Empson's in turn prefigures the thematic elaborations of later British poems and occasions all manner of swerves undertaken by various poets associated with various movements in subsequent British poetry of this century. Thus, it is fairly easy to demonstrate, for example, the ways in which a number of John Wain's poems swerve in relation to more or less specifiable precursor poems by Empson. And it is fairly easy to discern that there is a clear difference in the operation of the anxiety of influence in the Hardy-Empson-Wain sequence of clinamina compared to, say, the Whitman-Stevens-Ashbery sequence of tesserae: the first is characterized by swerves, more or less accomplished, the second by completions, likewise more or less accomplished. That the modern British poet, like his precursors, tends to manifest poetic influence through the clinamen rather than the tessera characteris- tic of his American counterpart implicates a general difference of antithetical attitudes toward poetic tradition: the British poet is respect- fully revisionary, the American poet somewhat disrespectfully revolu- tionary. That difference, in the moder period, can probably be accounted for in large part by the fact that modern British poetry never underwent the reevaluative revolution in form and subject matter that Pound and his ephebes created in modern American poetry, indeed could not have undergone that revolution because of an entrenched pattern of influence perpetuated by clinamina rather than tesserae. Two very different culturally-conditioned pretensions to "tougher-minded- ness" are involved. It is worthwhile to remember, since criticism itself is, according to Bloom, necessarily antithetical and consists of "a series of swerves after unique acts of creative misunderstanding" (93), that Empson is better known as a critic than as a poet, a critic who is coming increasingly to 55</page><page sequence="10">Michael L. Johnson be recognized by structuralists and poststructuralists of various persua- sions as a forefather or latter-day darling, and that he is regarded by Bloom as one of the two "best critics of our time" because he, along with G. Wilson Knight, has "misinterpreted more antithetically than all others" (95). As I hope I have shown, Empson the poet also is acting as antithetical arch-critic, certainly in "This Last Pain" and arguably in other poems as well, in relation to appropriate precursors. In that role he again shares something of the character of Milton's Satan, this time in relation to Hardy as Milton's God, for he, as figured through the persona of his poem, is one who is properly concerned with illusions projected "on the smoke of hell" (by which last word Empson, 102, says he "meant only Sheol, chaos") and who embodies Bloom's concept of the "strong poet," a type whose ephebic hubris may be comprehended in Blakean terms: "The strong poet indeed says: 'I seem to have stopped falling; now I am fallen, consequently I lie here in Hell,' but he is thinking, as he says this, 'As I fell, I swerved, consequently I lie here in a Hell improved by my own making"' (45). It is arguable that the kind of poetic influence that has made possible such a situation and attitude for the ephebe has, to some extent at least, been, in Bloom's words, "more of a blight than a blessing, from the Enlightenment until this moment" (50). It is also arguable that "the covert subject" of "This Last Pain" as well as of much of the rest of Empson's limited poetic output (like that, as Bloom contends, of most of the poetry written since the Enlightenment) is "the anxiety of influence" itself, the poet's "fear that no proper work remains for him to perform" (148). This latter argument would seem to apply more accurately to British poetry, especially modern British poetry, than to American poetry. To the extent that "This Last Pain" reveals that covert subject-and I believe it does to a considerable extent--it must be regarded as a "strong poem" by a "strong poet," one that embodies an ankious self-consciousness and poetic aporia. If it is true that "strong poems that too explicitly re-write precursor poems tend to become poems of conversion . ." (108), then the conversion of Empson's persona, as dramatized at the end of the poem, is perhaps no more admirable than that of Satan in his own affirmation of "a style from a despair." Such conversions may themselves involve an ironic "over-idealization" as well as a deceptive (self-deceptive) "tougher-mindedness." Near the end of The Anxiety of Influence, when his survey of the categories of poetic influence is virtually completed, Bloom avers, especially in reference to British poets, that "It is as though the final phase of great modern poets existed neither for last affirmations of a lifetime's beliefs, nor as palinodes, but rather as the ultimate placing 56</page><page sequence="11">South Atlantic Review and reduction of ancestors" (147). In "This Last Pain" Empson surely does enact some such placing and reduction of Hardy. The anxiety and the problematic drive for discontinuity implicated in that action might be interpreted profitably by borrowing and adapting a dictum from Richard Wasson. Writing of the difference between modern and contemporary literary sensibilities (mainly British and American), he observes that "Where modems raged for order, our contemporaries cope with chaos" (476). The same distinction could be made, mutatis mutandis, at a higher level on the helix of history ("upward" in time, in Bloom's terms), in regard to the premoderns and moderns, particularly insofar as their periods are represented by the two poems I have been considering: Hardy's calls for humanistic moral order in a universe becoming godless; Empson's proposes merely a way of coping with the paradox-ridden chaos of a universe in which that godlessness has come to its evacuating fruition. The swerves of "This Last Pain" in relation to "A Plaint to Man," of Empson in relation to Hardy, of many modern British (and some non-British) poets in relation to their premoder precursors may be clearly illuminated, like the swerves of subatomic particles in a bubble chamber, in the light afforded by that distinction or other versions of it. Likewise, spiraling (or swerving) back down the helix of history ("downward" in time), I can discern the relevance of Wasson's dictum, as originally stated, in the realm of contemporary critical inquiry. There Empson's own post-New-Critical ephebes, whose work is characterized by a heady and international mixture of patterns of influence, have found in the analysis of the text that, as G. Douglas Atkins epitomizes it, "In place of stable meaning appears what Derrida calls 'freeplay,' a tremendously creative and exhilarating possibility" (777). That possibility has motivated cries of nihilism from more conventional critics, but it is ripe for the continued attention of those critics with post-modern sensibilities who are by this time almost veterans at learning "a style from a despair." It is a possibility that Empson would surely understand and appreciate, given his penchant for creatively coping with the equivocal interplay of signifiers whose signifieds, like images projected upon "some dim sheet" or "the smoke of hell," are the subject of radical doubt-that "edifice of form / For house where phantoms may keep warm." But he might warn, ironi- cally, that "if we worked it long / We should forget where it was wrong." University of Kansas 57</page><page sequence="12">58 Michael L.
