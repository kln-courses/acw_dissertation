In zine issue the of September/October I Military published Images what maga- 2003 I issue of Military Images maga- zine I published what I believed to be an old copyprint of a photograph taken of a soldier from the Indian Wars wearing per- haps the finest beaded buckskin scout outfit in the country. It was hope that someone would recog- nize this exact photo or at least recognize who our mystery person was. Another identified photo of the scout in his buckskins would seal the deal. We had no luck in locating such a photo and so we followed the photo spread with an article published in the January/February 2005 issue of Military Images , which revealed that I had an ulterior motive. I let the readers know I bought the actual beaded buckskin outfit seen in the photo in 1992, seven years prior to my finding the photo on Ebay in 1999. 1 also let them know that on the hem of the shirt was stenciled a partial name and what everybody believed to be a partial 7th Cavalry insignia. We had done both high and low tech forensics on the stencil to come up with the name, "R. Crispin," but a search of the Private Robert Crispin 5th United States Cavalry National Archives and many other sources got us no closer to posi- tively identifying our "scout." Then I met artist and Florida Deputy Sheriff, Chris Colman, who had a background in criminal investigation, and he volunteered to join the search. Chris began checking the 1 880 Census data for the western states and territories, when all of a sudden there he was, our "scout", and that he was a pri- vate then currently stationed at Fort Laramie, W.T. Although, we could see from the census data that Crispin was stationed at Fort Laramie, it didn't add up why a member of the Seventh Cavalry would be stationed at a fort gar- risoned by the Fifth. And then Chris came up with the solution. The "7" on the stencil was actual- ly a degraded "5!" What a break and armed with the new informa- tion and with help from Ms. Sandra Lo wry at Fort Laramie and independent researcher, Bonnie Zullo of Fairfax, VA., we were able to get extensive data on Crispin from the National Archives. Most of it was pension data which revealed that Crispin served one hitch from August 1876 to August 1881, and that he sus- tained injuries severe enough to make him nearly unemployable as a farmer when he returned home to New York and after 1888, heavily dependent on government disabili- ty payments. At the end of the previous article we were left with a number of unanswered questions and more than a tad of wishful thinking. We began wondering again about the photograph of Crispin wearing his buckskin suit. Where was it taken? Our persistent and very patient publisher, David Neville, always insisted that the photo was an orig- inal taken in Central Square, New York City, which didn't make sense to Chris and I. And although the only listing we could find for the photographer, E.C. Adams, placed him in Vancouver, British Columbia, in our hearts, Chris and I knew the photo had to have been taken somewhere out west. We concentrated our efforts on Cheyenne and Laramie. Another issue involved the guns. Although the sidearm looks september/october 2006 27</page><page sequence="3">like a standard issue Colt .45 SAA, the rifle is a non-standard issue Remington or perhaps Whitney rolling block rifle. And , of course, we wanted to know whether he wore the scout suit as part of his official duties? Could he have been in uniform as the unit's for- ager? According to Sandra Lowry at Fort Laramie, the troops, espe- cially the enlisted men, wouldn't have been allowed out of uniform while on duty and that if there was somebody acting as a unit's hunter, it was not an official designation. But she also noted that the men would hunt as much as they could when off duty. Tom Buecker, cura- tor of the Fort Robinson Nebraska State Museum, concurred, and added that sometimes they could check out heavy or specialized weaponry when hunting on their own. But Joe Reasoner of the National Park Service seemed to 4iave the most definitive answer in regards to soldiers hunting. During the early days of the Indian Wars, according to Joe, hunting was severely restricted. There was a high desertion rate in the 1860 's and 70 's and so permission to leave the post was not a common event. Much depended on the demeanor of the commanding offi- cer or company commander. The best shot in the company might be allowed to hunt on Sundays if he was not essential at the fort and on campaign it was common for sol- diers to supplement their bland diet with exotic game by hunting and fishing. However, there was always the danger that soldiers doing so could be cut off from the main force and killed by Indians. There was also the danger of acci- dents happening or a detail giving Above: The 1880 U.S. Census reveals Robert Crispin to be a soldier stationed at Fort Laramie, Wyoming Territory. His name is seventh from the top on this handwritten census. away its location or element of surprise. And in the early days, ammunition was a rare commodity with each soldier being account- able for every round. On the other hand, Joe said that during the late 1880s and 1890s, as the danger of hostilities decreased, ammunition became much more readily avail- able, and duties on the frontier became more mundane, the sol- diers were given much more lati- tude to pursue their sport. In fact, according to Doug McChristian, also of the NPS, there were hunting parties outfitted for several days by the army with the condition that any game not eaten in the field be brought back to the fort and distributed among the company messes. It is not clear whether Crispin would have been allowed to wear his suit on such expeditions, but it certainly seems possible or even likely. However, it is just as clear that Crispin prob- ably would not have worn his beaded scout outfit while on active duty, which still squares with there being regimental markings on his shirt. While engaged in these discussions, we again contacted Vonnie Zullo of Horse Soldier Research Service and asked for regimental records of the Fifth Cavalry. What still remains of them are so fragile that one of the pension auditors complained about their condition during Crispin's lifetime! So, Vonnie sent us a rep- resentative sample of Company A's service during Crispin's enlist- ment. What we found was quite interesting and reinforced the fact that Crispin was "out there." Company A and Crispin participat- ed in the Big Horn and Yellowstone Expedition of 1876. American Horse's village at Slim Buttes was looted and destroyed on September 12 by the Third Cavalry and Company A was among the companies which engaged Crazy Horse who had rid- den to its defense. The Muster Rolls reveal that on July 19, 1877, Company A joined other units of the 5th Cavalry, which were detached to escort General Sheridan to the Little Big Horn, and interestingly enough, they fur- ther reveal that Company A was sent on a hunting expedition into the Big Horn Mountains from August 6 to August 1 1 of that same year. Crispin was on the roll call and later participated in the hunt for Dull Knife's band during the Cheyenne Outbreak from Fort Robinson during January and February 1879. Curiously, Crispin always maintained that he was also a part of the Chief Joseph cam- paign on his pension applications, but was always overruled by gov- ernment auditors because Company A garrisoned Fort Laramie at the time. We have found no evidence in the muster rolls to support his claim. 28 military Images</page><page sequence="4">Probably the most signifi- cant action that Company A was involved with was the Ute War of 1879. The Utes, living on the east- ern slopes of the Rockies in Colorado, had basically enjoyed good relations with the whites, with many of their warriors employed as scouts at one time or the other. The major exception was when Agent Nathan Meeker decid- ed in 1878 to force the Indians on the White River reservation from their hunting and gathering ways onto farms and into cabins through threat of starvation if need be. Tensions escalated until September 1879 when Meeker decided to ask for army protection at the Agency. Elements of the 5th Cavalry under Captain J. Scott Payne and the Fourth Infantry under Major Thomas Thornburgh were among the troops that responded to the call for assis- tance, the column and its supply train attacked by Ute snipers at Milk Creek, Colorado on September 29. The Ute snipers had positioned themselves where they could pick off the troopers one at a time, Major Thornburgh being one of the first killed. The wagon train circled itself in a classic defensive maneuver, affording the soldiers some protection, but still twelve soldiers and teamsters lost their lives and many others were wounded. The Utes then returned to the Agency and struck Agent Meeker to the ground with a tent pole, killed six other civilian employees, and kidnapped his wife and daughter (later returned unharmed). A rescue party was raised that resulted, as Captain George Price described it in his 1883 clas- sic book, Across the Continent Above: An illustration of the Battle of Milk Creek, Colorado, during which the soldiers defended themselves behind a corral of wagons. Besieged by Ute war- riors for nearly a week, the soldiers held out until a relief column from the 5th U.S. Cavalry reached the battlefield on October 5, 1879. (From " The Bravest Five Hundred of '61" by Theo. F. Roden bough 1891) with the Fifth Cavalry, in "a move- ment of troops such as had never been witnessed in the Department of the Platte, if, indeed in any department." Quite simply, Colonel Wesley Merritt, with two squadrons of cavalry and five companies of infantry conducted a "lightening march," when they left Rawlins, Wyoming Territory at 1 1 :00 AM on October 2, 1 879 and arrived 170 miles and three days later at Milk Creek, Colorado on October 5, 1879. There they raised the siege and dispersed the enemy. A quick look at the muster rolls show that Company A and Private Crispin were part of the rescue effort and a more careful look revealed that they were part of the burial detail, as well. Although the body of Major Thornburgh was evacuated, the other twelve men killed at Milk Creek were buried on the spot because it was deter- mined to be too dangerous to try to take them along. Only in the last year did archeologist Brad Edwards discover their unmarked graves and he is trying to get the government involved in giving their remains a proper burial. It was during this time that my fellow researcher, Chris Colman, decided to undertake the seemingly monumental task of try- ing to capture the spirit and per- sonality of Robert Crispin on can- vas. The first major problem he had was that the scout suit seemed so out of proportion that he won- dered whether the photo was dis- torted. I told Chris that having owned much 19th century clothing over the years, that this was not unusual and that, considering the types of heavy labor people were engaged in, it was apparent to me there must have been a lot of "Popeye the Sailormen-types" liv- ing well into the 20th century. It was also during this time that we decided to take another look at Crispin's pension file. Although Crispin didn't die until December 1934, his wife, Emma, predeceased him in 1929. After the death of his wife, Crispin lived the September/ october 2006 29</page><page sequence="5">remainder of his years with Emma Crispin's niece (by marriage), Lucy Simcoe of Waverly, New York. While studying the pension file in the middle of the night, it occurred to me that Simcoe was an unusual name and that Waverly must be a small town. So, I decid- ed to merely call directory assis- tance, and lo and behold, there was a Locey Simcoe in Waverly! Was this Crispin's grandniece or was it merely wishful thinking? While at it, I decided to look for Waverly on my poor excuse for a map, and although I didn't find Waverly, I did find the town of Central Square, New York on the western edge of Oneida Lake! For me, it was another epiphany of historic proportions, and it all made sense! Dave was right or at least mostly right! He suggested that Crispin came back from the army in August 1881, had his photo taken by E.C. Adams, and then got mar- ried three weeks later in Elmira, New York. Although this went against the data we had on Adams, further research revealed that Adams started his photography business in Central Square, moved it to New York City, went on to document the gold rush in the Yukon, and ended up in Vancouver, British Columbia. It occurred to me that Robert and Emma Crispin probably honey- mooned at Oneida Lake and the photo was taken in Central Square at the same time. Armed with this new infor- mation, we agonized about the best way to Locey Simcoe. And then we had another revelation when Chris found Locey listed on the website of the 380th Bombardment Group, which had made the longest bombing mis- Above: Artist Chris Colman at work on the painting of Private Robert Crispin.

Although our natural impulse was to just pick up the phone and call, my role model and surrogate dad, James Waste of Alta, California, convinced me not to, and so we decided a formal letter of introduc- tion might be a better approach. We sent the letter and when after a week we received no reply, we could resist our urge no longer, and made the call. Locey's wife, Bettie Simcoe, was on the other end of the line, but when we asked if we could talk to Locey, she informed us that he had died in August 2003. She explained that she had written us a letter some days back and that we should get it soon. When the letter finally arrived, out dropped an old snap- shot of what appeared to be a tremendous tomahawk! With feverish hands I read from Bettie 's letter that, "Locey, my husband, prized highly a tomahawk given to him 'by a male relative' when he was a boy." I thought to myself, "Is this the tomahawk at the end of the rainbow?" Would Bettie con- sider selling it? Even if not, I felt we had more than fulfilled our wishful thinking. Not only had we located the widow of a descendent; but she had a tomahawk in her basement, which had been collect- ed by our "mystery scout" prior to 1881. How unbelievable! How many items of such historical sig- nificance can still be lying in peo- ple's basements yet to be discov- ered? And of those items, how many simply get tossed out in the garbage or sold in a garage sale. Was this, as both Jim Waste and Chris Colman insisted, all meant to be? We told Bettie that her tomahawk was very valuable and that she should get it appraised by one or more of the big New York auction houses. Then after she did, perhaps she could come back with a number that would make her happy, should she be inclined to sell it. I didn't want to make an offer because if the natural conflict of interest that would arise from my appraising and trying to buy the tomahawk at the same time. And besides, at this point, the important thing was to get the story told. But after two months of not hearing anything, one way or the other, we approached her 30 military images</page><page sequence="6">again. She replied that we'd have to deal with her son, Joseph of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, as he stood to inherit the piece. We contacted Joe and gave him advice similar to that we gave Bettie. While waiting for some sort of reply, we realized that the most important thing we could be doing was trying to identify the toma- hawk's tribal origin. This was important in and of itself, but even more important because we might gain insight into where and under what circumstances Crispin may have gotten the tomahawk, based on his known whereabouts and activities. Tomahawks in general are considered to be among the most prized items among collectors, not only because they were considered to be weapons, at least the ones that were actually used, but because they were considered to be luxuries in their own time, which only Indians of wealth and stature, or those who had proven their prowess in battle, could afford. And as stated by my friend, Norm Exton of Orcas, Washington, "Their was no greater calling among the Indians than to be a warrior." Most Western toma- hawk's had a place to attach a beaded drop, but probably 95% of them over the years became sepa- rated from their original drops. The fact that the Crispin toma- hawk still had its original drop (although kept in a frame) was a tribute to both Robert Crispin and his grandnephew, Locey, and also testimony to how very few hands the piece had gone through. When after several more weeks we had not heard anything from Joe, I simply made him an offer, which he accepted. The tom- The Crispin Tomahawk &amp; Beaded Drop (Jack Ringwalt collection) ahawk at the end of the rainbow was mine! But not yet in my hands, so it was with more than a little trepidation, that I opened the box. Inside the box was what I fig- ured to be, for me, the ultimate tomahawk, decorated or perhaps repaired with two areas of tightly coiled brass wire bands and four sections of brass furniture tacks circumnavigating the stem. Towards the but end of the stem was a twisted buffalo hide hanging thong and the remains of a buffalo hide sock and thick buffalo lashes where the beaded drop had become detached. Inside the box with the tomahawk was the framed tomahawk drop, just as it looked on the photo Bettie had sent, except that it somehow seemed much larger than I expected. The brass bands each had two sets of parallel diamond designs engraved in them and the steel head had sev- eral ticks going around the rim of the bowl and along the mid-ridge of the neck. There were also two sets of notches along the file-cut "V" area, with the ones closest the front of the hawk appearing to me to be almost anthropomorphic. In the recesses of the steel head and around many of the brass tacks (as well as the entire backside of the beaded drop) there are vestiges of red paint. Another very exciting aspect of the pipe tomahawk was that it had been drilled and still contained tobacco residue. Towards the end of the Indian Wars, tomahawks became strictly ceremonial pieces that weren't sharpened or even drilled. The Crispin tomahawk oozed humanity and after observing the sharpened blade, there was no doubt in my mind that the tomahawk had "reached out and touched some- body." The only thing more I could of asked was for the tomahawk to ne in better condition. Although the weapon itself was in pretty good shape, the buffalo hide bead- ed drop was very fragile, with the fringe being almost brittle, and so I elected to keep it in a frame, for the time being. The long fringe had been braided almost like a pony- September/ october 2006 31</page><page sequence="7">tail, which was a stylistic adapta- tion adopted by many of the west- ern tribes, especially the Crow and Shoshoni, in the 1870s. But we had the real deal and so honest use was to be expected! Our search for a tribal ori- gin intensified! Tomahawks made on the Great Plains usually had drops attached to a small-carved protuberance on the bottom of the haft. Tomahawks made further west on the Plateau or in the Great Basin areas generally had their drops attached at the very end of the haft with a side sock device and lacing holding it in place. Similarly, Plains tomahawks tend- ed to have very large metal heads, often triangular, with smaller drops. On the other hand, toma- hawks from the Plateau and Great Basin areas tended to have smaller heads with straight leading edges and disproportionately large drops. This was no hard and fast rule, and tomahawks could change posses- sion through trade, purchase, gift, or battle. We were very fortunate that the Crispin beaded drop exhibited a style of beadwork that was characteristic of only a few tribes. Additionally, the stylistic use of brass tacks and wire wrap- ping tended to be used by some tribes more than others, although wire wrapping could always affect a repair, if need be, no matter what the tribe. To get more specific answers to our questions we turned to the experts. Although there is a vast diversity and experience about tomahawks among dealers, most believed that the tomahawk was Shoshoni and that the "Shoshoni style" was adopted by the Crow and other tribes in the area. The next logical step was to Chief Washakie of the Shoshoni tribe. Revered by his own people for his bravery and leadership, Washakie's tribe allied themselves with the US Army, providing scouts to fight the Sioux, Cheyenne, and Arapahos. Reportedly, Washakie lived to be more than 100, dying in 1900. The tomahawk Private Crispin brought home may well be of Shoshoni ori- gin. (CDVbyC.R. Savage, Pioneer Art Gallery, Salt Lake City, Utah. Michael Kraus collection) go to the restorers. They are, or are supposed to be, more objective than dealers, and have typically studied a vast variety of material during the course of their restora- tion work. I approached two of the top restorers in the country, Bill Plitt of Sante Fe, New Mexico and Mark Miller of Kalispell, Montana. Bill felt quite sure that the tomahawk was classic Shoshoni and that it was old when Crispin came in possession of it. He also added that, "most of the time you see old photos of similar tomahawks in the hands of war- riors waiting to join the battle. This tomahawk saw actual service- many times." Bill also raised the interesting point that the scout suit was not necessarily made by the Santee or Teton Sioux- that floral beadwork was used by nearly all the tribes, and that the beaded scout suit could even be Shoshoni. Although Mark Miller conceded the tomahawk might certainly be Shoshoni, he felt just as strongly that the tomahawk was Crow, and that it dated to about 1860! Mark said he had seen the exact design on the drop as part of larger bead- ed items clearly identified as Crow. The Shoshoni lived on the eastern slopes of the Grand Tetons in Wyoming and the Crows lived in Montana. Both served with great distinction as allies of the whites during the Indian Wars. Additionally, Benson Lanford of Ashland, Oregon felt the toma- hawk was Ft. Peck (Montana) Sioux. Many of the Sioux, espe- cially the Yankton and Hunkpapa, but also some Santee and other tribes, surrendered at Fort Peck Agency because there were still a lot of buffalo to be hunted and they could enjoy living the old way dur- ing summer, while depending upon rations during the winter. Furthermore, Metis (half-breeds) traders often came down to Fort Peck from Canada, but the army discouraged this because they often brought liquor with them and competed for what game was still available. The Assiniboine fre- quented Fort Peck as well. Bill Holm, recently retired from the University of Washington, felt the tomahawk was made even further west and could have been made by any number of tribes, making it nearly impossible to pin down where. Although Bill Holm might have given the most accurate 32 military images</page><page sequence="8">assessment, it was the least satisfy- ing and it's important to note that both Holm and Lanford were unaware of the full context of the larger story. But we do have the larger context of the full story, acquired through years of research and much good fortune, which in my opinion, entitles us to make some possible conclusions of our own. We know that Private Robert Crispin was stationed at Forts Laramie and D.A. Russell, Wyoming Territory from August 1876 through August 1881 and that the Crow and Shoshoni Reservations were the closest in proximity. We also tracked Company "A"s movements through Wyoming, Colorado, Montana, and Nebraska and know they often had Shoshoni and Crow scouts with them. The fact that Norm Exton made a startling dis- covery among the documented pieces of the Ogden B. Read Collection, residing at the University of Vermont, simply but- tresses our case. Lieutenant Ogden B. Read and the men of the 11th U.S. Infantry were assigned to pro- tect the Missouri River Agencies and in 1879, Lieutenant Read pur- chased from a Crow Indian at Terry's Landing, Montana Territory a tomahawk that was nearly identical to ours. (Please see Raymond J. DeMallie and Royal B. Hassrick's, "Vestiges of a Proud Nation," edited by Glenn E. Markoe, Robert Hull Fleming Museum, Burlington, Vermont, 1986, p.131). So where does that leave us, in terms of how and under what circumstances, Crispin got both his beaded scout outfit and his tomahawk? In some ways, no bet- A close up of the buckskin suit worn by Private Robert Crispin.

We can never know all the answers for sure, but we can make some fairly educated guesses. One of the big questions I had was how Crispin could end up with a Santee suit when the Santee were located so far east in Nebraska. There was, of course, a lot of intertribal trade and white commercial establishments that sold Indian goods. There is also the possibility that the suit was not made by the Santee at all, but by one of the more local tribes. However, in reading about the Santee Sioux, I found out that only the ones that surrendered or were captured during the Great Sioux war of 1862 were sent to Santee, Nebraska. The ones that escaped fled west and joined the free tribes of the Dakotas and Montana. A number of Santee participated in the Battle of Little Bighorn and more than one thousand Santee were receiving rations at Fort Peck, Montana in the late 1870s. Many Sioux Indians at Fort Peck, as well as Crows and Shoshonis, traded and sold goods at Terry's Landing, Montana, where we know the Read tomahawk was col- lected. So, certainly the Crispin scout suit and tomahawk could have been collected from the same place or area, perhaps from the same person, except that the scout suit was custom made for Crispin. But the question, which looms even larger in my mind, is how could Crispin afford such magnificent examples of Indian craftsmanship? A private's pay was not very much in the forst place and there was nothing in his pension papers, or in any of the local New York historical soci- eties, to indicate he was ever any- thing but dirt poor. And yet, Crispin's beaded scout suit must have been expensive, as expensive as anything Buffalo Bill ever wore. Similarly, the tomahawk must have been some Indian's prized possession and was probably quite old when Crispin came into pos- session of it. While researching the pre- vious article, Chris told me he had found Bob listed by the Mormons as "Indian." I duly noted that, but failed to admit my ignorance about where and how the Mormons got their information. So, I asked Chris again and he told me, "from the census data." Inspired by that response, I took another look at the 1880 Fort Laramie Census and in the column, which lists the race of each individual, the census-taker and clearly written by Bob's name an "I" over a "W." Originally, I thought the census-taker just scratched out the "W", for whatev- er reason, but now I could clearly see he had made an intentional September/ october 2006 33</page><page sequence="9">change. The same census-taker had also said that Crispin's parents were from Arizona, which of course was a bald-faced lie. I did- n't pay much attention to it, dis- missing it as either census error or a practical joke by Bob, but I can hardly imagine a census-taker being that gullible. However, if Bob was wearing his beaded suit that might have helped his little ploy, but probably not enough. On the other hand, if Bob had been accompanied by an Indian woman as well, that might have indeed convinced the census-taker that, at the very least, Bob had a Shoshoni, Crow or Santee Sioux wife! I ran this scenario past Bill Plitt of Sante Fe and he felt that it made sense, and that the toma- hawk could have belonged to the woman's first husband. Holy cow! Who knows, but we have learned two valuable lessons from this whole ordeal. The first is that things happen for a reason and the second is to never give up' # The Editor would like to thank the fol- lowing people for their help in bringing this article to fruition: Chris Colman for his fine painting of Robert Crispin and friendship of the author, and Michael Kraus for photographs and the sketch of Private Crispin's final resting place.
