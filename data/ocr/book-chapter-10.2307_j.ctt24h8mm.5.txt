<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Dreamtime Superhighway: an analysis of Sydney Basin rock art and prehistoric information exchange 3 SOCIAL CONTExT  While anthropology can help elucidate the complexity of cultural systems at particular points in time,  archaeology can best document long-term processes of change (Layton 1992b:9) In the original thesis one chapter was dedicated to the ethnohistoric and early sources for the  Sydney region and another to previous regional archaeological research. Since 1994, Valerie  Attenbrow has published both her PhD thesis (1987, 2004) and the results of her Port Jackson  Archaeological Project (Attenbrow 2002). More recent, extensive open area excavations on the  Cumberland Plain done as cultural heritage management mitigations (e.g. JMcD CHM 2005a,  2005b, 2006) have also altered our understanding of the region’s prehistory. As Attenbrow’s  Sydney’s Aboriginal Past  (2002)  deals  extensively with  ethnohistoric  evidence  from  the  First  Fleet and early days of the colony the ethnohistoric and historic sources explored for this thesis  have been condensed to provide the rudiments for the behavioral model developed for prehistoric  Sydney rock art.     The British First Fleet sailed through Sydney Heads on 26 January 1788. Within two years  an epidemic of (probably) smallpox had reduced the local Aboriginal population significantly –  in Farm Cove the group which was originally 35 people in size was reduced to just three people  (Phillip 1791; Tench 1793; Collins 1798; Butlin 1983; Curson 1985; although see Campbell  2002). This epidemic immediately and irreparably changed the traditional social organisation of  the region.   The Aboriginal society around Port Jackson was not studied systematically, in the  anthropological sense, by those who arrived on the First Fleet. Numerous accounts were made  of the more obvious aspects of Aboriginal culture (e.g. Bradley 1786-92; Collins 1798, 1802,  1804; Dawes 1790; Hunter 1793; Phillip 1789, 1791; Tench 1793; Watling 1794; White 1790).  Over the next 50 years a number of detailed references to Aboriginal life in the region were made  (e.g. Barrallier 1802, Angas 1847, Threlkeld 1824-1859 in Gunson 1974, the Russians between  1814-1822 in Barratt 1981), but explicitly anthropological work was not undertaken in the region  until the late 19th century, when R.H. Mathews (1896d, 1897c, 1897e, 1898b, 1900, 1901, 1908;  Mathews and Everitt 1900) studied the languages and social organisation of various tribes in south- eastern Australia. These studies, however, took place in already devastated communities living  in much altered circumstances more than 100 years after contact, and after a second epidemic of  smallpox in the 1830’s (Butlin 1983, Curson 1985).   While the Sydney ethnohistory is disjointed and its interpretation requires many ‘leaps  of  faith’,  the  First  Fleet  journalists were  ‘trained military  observers’  and  the  very  survival  of  the colony depended on ‘their observations and assessments’ (Isabel McBryde, pers. comm.,  1990). Also, in the early days of the colony, there was an atmosphere of philanthropy. Governor  Phillip was intent on carrying out orders to ‘establish with th[e native inhabitants] a strict amity  and alliance’ and to treat them ‘with the utmost kindness’ (Phillip 1789[1970]:36). Many of the  descriptive accounts are useful in establishing daily activities of the Port Jackson Aborigines at  1788. The attendant interpretations and conclusions, however, particularly about the more abstract  qualities of Aboriginal life, must be treated carefully (and see Clendinnen 2003).  In 1788 certain obvious differences were observed between groups of people living in the  region. These included tribal (family and language) groupings, economic and social divisions  terra australis 27 16 </page> <page sequence="2"> Chapter 3: Social Context (coastal/inland, gender divisions, social prohibitions, ceremonies etc.). While this evidence is not  sufficient to develop a firm behavioural model, it does provide material ‘clues’ for the interpretation  of the stylistic patterning encountered in the art (and see Attenbrow 1988, 2002; Kohen 1986,  1988, 1993; Kohen and Lampert 1988; Lawrence 1968; Ross 1976, 1988; Vinnicombe 1980).  Previous archaeological models based on these observations provide contradictory interpretations  on social organisation (cf. Poiner 1971, Ross 1976, Kohen 1986).   This review establishes the behavioural parameters relevant to an interpretation of the art  produced by the prehistoric inhabitants of the Sydney region. Of particular importance, are the  social divisions which were recognised across the region and the types of social ‘boundaries’  which might have existed.  Stylistic behaviour depends not only on social cohesion, and the  maintenance of social ties, but also on social exclusivity, and the maintenance of boundaries  between groups of people (Wiessner 1983, 1990; Wobst 1977).  Social organisation and language boundaries [They are] divided into families. Each family has a particular place of residence, from which  is derived its distinguishing name. This is formed by adding the monosyllable Gal to the  name of the place: thus the southern shore of Botany Bay is called Gwea, and the people who  inhabit it style themselves Gweagal.  (Collins 1798[1975]:453) The Sydney region falls within the south-east coast cultural-area group (Peterson 1976). While  people would usually have subsisted in smaller localised groups, these groups would have  formed part of a larger population. The social organisation of the Aboriginal people around Port  Jackson was observed as named groups associated with designated tracts of land. It was generally  recognised that the basic economic unit in the region was the family group - one or two adult  males, their wives and dependants (young and old) - several of which usually teamed together to  forage in a fairly restricted area (Lawrence 1968:171).   Within a year of arriving in Sydney a number of named groups had been recognised by  the recorders on the First Fleets; the Cadigal, Cammerragal, Wannegal, Wallumedigal, Gweagal,  Boromedegal, Noronggerragel, Borogegal and the Gomerrigal (Phillip to Lord Sydney, 13 Feb,  1790; HRA 1,1 [1914]:160). Only the first six of these were provenanced. Linguistic information  (Capell 1970, Dawes 1790) has been used to supplement this list (Kohen 1988: Figure 2).  The complexity of kin relationship within and between family groups was not recorded –  and nor is the relationship between family groups in the larger social structure understood. The  presence of linguistic sub-groups was indicated by different dialects although the connections  and social mechanisms which enabled the larger ‘culture’ group to function were not understood.  The division of territory was still less clear, although most early writers observed that smaller  groups had specific connections with particular locations (e.g. Collins 1798[1975]:453, Hunter  1793[1968]:62).   When considering the nature of territories and boundaries, particularly in terms of how  these  may  be  reflected  in  rock  art,  it  is  recognised  that  ‘boundaries’  are  not  entirely  useful  concepts when it comes to viewing Australian Aboriginal territorial organisation. Aboriginal  territorial organisation is much more complex than any Eurocentric concepts of individual, or  even corporate, ownership (Rigsby and Sutton 1982; Sutton 1995). While the anthropological  literature is divided over the basic units of territoriality, definitions of ‘the tribe’ and the bases  for territorial organisation, certain substantive matters are basic to a consideration of territoriality  in contact Sydney. By necessity these are projected from ethnographic material from elsewhere  on the continent. The following generalisations regarding Aboriginal territorial organisation are  relevant: terra australis 27 17 </page> <page sequence="3"> Dreamtime Superhighway: an analysis of Sydney Basin rock art and prehistoric information exchange i)   the demarcation of defined tracts of territory and sets of totemic sites was usual in Aboriginal  society. The extent of  this area can be defined as  the extent of  the resident population’s  ecosystem (Peterson 1976:58). While the periphery of this may have been vague, the  ‘heartland’ of any group’s estate gave that group its habitation and name; ii)   a kinship defined ‘residence group’ occupied a defined tract of land (its range). This small  scale exploitative population combined for various economic reasons: conservation of  effort, population pressure, seasonality and scheduling, a mixed diet and the division  of labour (Peterson 1976:59). Band size varied considerably by region across Australia  (Peterson 1985:50); iii)  residence groups comprised not only the members of the local descent (and therefore  language) group, but wives, and also others of ‘foreign agnatic stock’ (Stanner 1965:11).  There  was  fairly  fluid  movement  of  individuals  between  groups.  Band  size  has  been  recorded as being remarkably consistent amongst hunter gatherers generally and Australia  in particular (Peterson 1985:38). These are cited as variously being between 25-50 people  with the optimum being 30 (Davidson 1938, Tindale 1974);  iv)  in many instances, ‘zones of indeterminacy’ exist between adjacent groups ‘without clash  over title’ (Stanner 1965:12). These and indeterminate tracts (used, for instance, as access  routes) were not the exclusive possession of any one band; v)  the local group population was usually part of a larger regional or ‘culture-area’ population  (Peterson 1976:51) and as such, shared a number of cultural traits and/or characteristics  (Kroeber 1939, McCarthy 1940, Lampert 1971b). Visits between groups within a region  were ruled by convention. ‘Constant interaction of th[is] kind characterised both the  religious and the secular life. There was a real interest in mixing with neighbours, and a  strong moral requirement to share life-supports with them’ (Stanner 1965:2). The evidence  in the Sydney region is sparse [e.g. Collins (1798) and Howitt (1904)] but would appear  to  indicate  that  as many  as  200 men  or  600-800  people might  congregate  for  the final  sequences of initiation ceremonies; vi)  the Aboriginal life pattern had a marked polarity; the population aggregated and dispersed in  successive phases. Periodicity and length of the phases varied considerably, but generally,  the local group clustered in good times and dispersed in the bad;  vii)  the degree of interaction between groups depended on general ecological conditions and  good seasons, on population density and a tendency towards the conservation of effort; e.g.  by division of labour and the ethic of reciprocity (Peterson 1976:58; Stanner 1965:3-7).  Localised seasonal abundances, such as evidenced by the Bogong moth feasts (Flood 1980),  the Bunya nut festivals (Morwood 1987), the annual mutton bird migration (Threlkeld in  Gunson 1974:65, Lampert 1966:97), would also have encouraged interaction, as would  have the (less predictable) ‘windfall’ resources such as beached whales reported in the  Sydney region (Tench 1793[1961]:176, Bradley 1786-92:120, Collins 1798 [1975]:490,  Threlkeld in Gunson 1974:55); On these bases, certain parameters for the current analysis are clear.   Distinct bands, speaking separate languages or dialects would have been identifiable,  and have inhabited discrete tracts of land. Given the relatively rich ecological conditions  of the Sydney coastal region, each of these groups could have maintained a degree  terra australis 27 18 </page> <page sequence="4"> Chapter 3: Social Context of economic independence, since their ranges would have provided for the basics of  survival (Stanner 1965, Godwin 1990).   These bands would have been part of a larger clan group, whose estate would have  represented the extent of the land inhabited by that larger group of people with economic  and ritual rights. This larger group is assumed here to be the language group.   Interaction between the clan groups would have occurred on the periphery of these  estates for economic activities. Shared ritual responsibilities would have required  interaction between these sub-groups of the larger culture area, and social conventions  would have controlled such visits. Ritual and economic relationships between people  and land (Hiatt 1962:284, Peterson 1985:24), and the distinction between land-using  and right-holding groups would have regulated this interaction.   Interaction between clan (or language) groups to hold ceremonies indicates larger scale  group cohesion of the culture area population, and there is evidence that considerable  stability in social activities is thus achieved; e.g. ‘correct’ designs are maintained on  Pukamani Poles amongst the Tiwi by supervision from neighbouring (totemically  related) individuals (Hart 1970). Hiatt (1965) records similar ‘owner/manager’  interaction in Gidgingali ceremony, as they have been made to bark painting production  (Morphy 1977, 1989; Taylor 1987, 1989). Collins commented (1798 [1975]:467) on an  initiation ceremony which could not commence in the absence of elders from adjacent  ‘tribes’. Similar social customs (as manifested by ceremonial behaviour) were observed  across the Sydney region, and these appear to have relied on ritual relationships with  neighbouring groups.   Specifically anthropological descriptions of social organisation in the Sydney region were made  by R.H. Mathews (although see comments above). He states that all members of the Darkingung  community (in the north-west of the region) were segregated into two moieties (phratries) Dilbi  and Kuparthin, whose names correspond with the Kamilaroi (Mathews 1897e:161, 170). Each  moiety was further subdivided into two sections, for the Darkingung these were named Bya and  Kubbi (for the former moiety) and Ippai and Kumbo (for the latter). On the basis of these moieties  and sections, totemic affiliation and marriage relations were determined. While totemic affiliation  controlled many social interactions, it did not dictate general economic activities; ‘members of  each group, and consequently of the totems also, [were] found in all the local divisions of the  tribe’ (Mathews 1897e:159).  Mathews notes that the Darkingung tribe had ‘uterine [matrilineal] descent’ (Mathews  1897e:170), with a dispersal of male and female members of the same totem. Conversely, Mathews  records that the groups in the south-west of the region – the Gandangara speaking tribes (which  by implication include the Darug: see below) had patrilineal descent, but that the women married  out of the group into which they had been born (Mathews and Everitt 1900:264). Here, while the  females of the same totem were dispersed by marriage, the males of the same totem, would have  co-resided: there was patrilineal descent and virilocal residence.    Peterson (1986:17) indicates that these post-marriage arrangements would have resulted  in two different types of residential groups, with the Darkingung exhibiting characteristics of the  mixed group and the Gandangara adhering to the characteristics of a kin group. Peterson argues  that the latter situation was the culturally prescribed ideal, both anthropologically (e.g. Radcliffe- Brown 1931) and by individual adult men. The former, however, was probably more common.  Most groups probably oscillated between the two, depending on economic obligations and ritual  (Peterson 1986:26).   Several early commentators noted an inequality amongst the ‘tribes’ around Port Jackson,  stating that the Cammaraygal (from the North Shore) were the largest and strongest group by  terra australis 27 19 </page> <page sequence="5"> Dreamtime Superhighway: an analysis of Sydney Basin rock art and prehistoric information exchange the  ‘influence of  their  numbers  and muscular  appearance’  and  that  ‘there  is  no doubt of  their  decided superiority over all tribes with whom we were acquainted’ (Collins 1798[1975]:453).  These comments were recorded after the 1789 epidemic, which (as mentioned above) greatly  affected the groups on the southern shore of Port Jackson. This relative ‘superiority’ may have  reflected the survival of an intact band of initiated people upon whom the relict bands depended  for continuing social activities and cohesion. However, the possibility of one group in the region  exerting overriding control in the social sphere may be of relevance.  Linguistic Evidence The linguistic evidence for the region indicates the presence of discrete language groups (Capell  1970; Dawes 1790; Mathews 1897c, 1901; Mathews and Everitt 1900; Threlkeld in Fraser 1892;  Tindale 1974; Troy 1990). This evidence is sketchy, and there are conflicting views on how it can  be interpreted (Kohen 1986, 1988; Kohen and Lampert 1988; Ross 1976, 1988). The boundaries  between these different language groups, as well as inter-relationships between these create the  greatest disagreement in archaeological interpretation.    The geographic distribution of linguistic groups within the region relies heavily on late  nineteenth century research into relict groups and regions, i.e. Kamilaroi and Wiradjiri (e.g.  Mathews 1897c, 1897e, 1903, 1904). Linguistic evidence collected at contact was largely in the  form of unprovenanced word lists (Collins 1798: Appendix XII, Hunter 1793[1968]:523, Tench  1793[1961]:291-3). The Dawes manuscript provides a detailed and comprehensive analysis of the  Sydney language - and details interaction between several notable Sydney Aboriginal people such  as Barangaroo and Benalong and their wives (e.g. Dawes 1790:14).   Lancelot Threlkeld arrived in Sydney in the 1820’s and completed a detailed and  provenanced grammar of the Guringai3 language sometime thereafter (Capell 1970). This  agrees with a vocabulary by J.F. Mann (Capell 1970), completed in the 1870’s and based on the  information of Long Dick, son of Bongaree4. The Dawes, Threlkeld and Mann manuscripts, while  giving detailed vocabularies, do not indicate the geographic distributions of these languages.   Mathews’ earlier work in the region defined three distinctive languages, the Darkingung,  Gandangara and Tharawal. Darug was defined as a dialect of Gandangara (Mathews and Everitt  1900:265). Mathew’s definition provided an incomplete coverage of the region, specifically not  including the coastal area north the Hawkesbury and possibly not north of Port Jackson (Capell  1970). Mathews placed the Darkingung to north of the Hawkesbury River in the drainage basins  of the Macdonald and Colo Rivers, Putty Creek and Wollombi Brook (Mathews 1897c:1). The  Gandangara were said to have existed in ‘the coastal district ... from the Hawkesbury River to  Cape Howe, extending inland to the Blue Mountains, and thence southerly ...’ (Mathews and  Everitt 1900:262). The Tharawal speaking people were spread over the coast from Port Hacking  to Jervis Bay ...extend[ing] inland for a considerable distance (Mathews 1901:127). Mathews  recorded Darug dialect being spoken at ‘Campbelltown, Liverpool, Camden, Penrith, and possibly  as far east as Sydney, where it merged with Thurrawal’ (Mathews and Everitt 1900:265).   Capell linguistic analysis (1970) concluded that four language groups (each with varying  numbers of dialects) existed in the region at contact. These were Guringai, Darkingung, Darug and  Tharawal (Figure 3.1). The presence and location of the Gandangara language is not discussed in  Capell’s paper.   The Guringai inhabited the coast between Port Jackson and somewhere north of Wyong,  where it met the Awaba language (Threlkeld in Gunson 1974, Mann 1885).   The Darkingung speakers occupied land to the west of the Guringai, north of the Hawkesbury  River (following Mathews 1897c). The boundary between the Guringai and Darkingung is along  Mooney Mooney Creek (cf. Kohen 1986, Smith 1983) and thence northerly (Capell 1970:22).  3The orthography for these languages varies between sources. Unless being directly quoted the spellings used throughout this thesis will be Guringai, Darkingung, Darug, Tharawal and Eora. 4Bongaree was ‘king ... of the Pittwater tribe’ (Macquarie 1822:258) or ‘Broken Bay tribe’ (Barratt 1981: Plate III). terra australis 27 20 </page> <page sequence="6"> Chapter 3: Social Context Figure 3.1: The four language areas defined for the region (after Capell 1970: Figure 1). The Guringai’s western neighbours south of the Hawkesbury were the Darug speakers. This  boundary is placed along Berowra Creek and the Lane Cove River to the northern shore of Port  Jackson.   Darug speakers inhabited the area south of the Hawkesbury River covering the Cumberland  Plain and including the upper reaches of the Georges and Nepean Rivers. South and/or east of  the Georges River between the Darug and the coast were the Tharawal speakers, their southern  boundary occurring well south of this study area (cf. Tindale 1940).   Between the Guringai and Tharawal on the coast, Capell places a dialect ‘or even sub- dialect’ (1970:22) of Darug, which he calls the ‘Sydney’ language, described elsewhere as the  Eora (Tindale 1974, Troy 1990). The extent of this dialect was ‘limited to the peninsula on which  terra australis 27 21 </page> <page sequence="7"> Dreamtime Superhighway: an analysis of Sydney Basin rock art and prehistoric information exchange Sydney now stands’ (Capell 1970:22). This designation is based primarily on the fact that both  Tharawal and Guringai are ‘affix-transferring’ languages, but that Darug is not.    A problem with Capell’s organisation is the nature of several of his boundaries: specifically  smaller water courses - such as Mooney Mooney and Berowra Creeks. It many coastal areas of  Australia, tribal boundaries occur at the edges of catchments (viz. Peterson 1976, Tindale 1974)  rather than dissecting catchments and logically - band ranges. Mathews’ (1897c) description of  Darkingung territory supports a watershed model, and certainly in the rugged and drier area  occupied by the Darkingung, it makes sense that the ‘heartlands’ of these clan estates has ridgelines  as their boundaries.   Many of the ridgelines around the Sydney region, e.g. the Boree Track and Kulnura/Peat’s  Ridge, were documented access routes (and see Ross 1976: Map 2.1). Due to the rugged sandstone  landscape, movement around the region would have been mostly by way of ridgelines. It makes  sense that major access routes would have occurred in ‘zones of intermediacy’ (Stanner 1965:12)  - on the periphery of a clan’s estate (and see Layton 1989:2, 1992b:9). It would seem unlikely that  boundaries between clan estates and language groups would have been creeklines, unless these  were major river systems (such as the Hawkesbury or Part Jackson) whereby access and crossing,  required a canoe.    Conversely, the linguistic evidence indicates that Broken Bay, a significant physical barrier,  was  not  a  language  boundary.  The Hawkesbury  River  near Wiseman’s  Ferry,  does  appear  to  have been a language boundary (between Darkingung and Darug speakers), while ethnohistoric  evidence suggests that the people on the Hawkesbury in the vicinity of Richmond Hill lived on  both sides of the river - ‘[o]n the opposite bank of the river they had left their wives and children’  (Tench 1793[1961]:230, my emphasis). In the south of the region, the Georges River appears to  have been the boundary between the Eora and Darug, and the Darug and Tharawal.   There is no dispute that distinctive linguistic divisions existed within the region at European  contact. The geographic distribution of these groups is less clear.    To the north and south of the region there is firm linguistic evidence for a separation of coastal  and hinterland groups; the Darkingung and Guringai in the north and the Darug/Gandangara and  Tharawal in the latter. In the centre of the region, primarily covering the Cumberland Plain and  Sydney peninsula, there is a suggestion of linguistic continuity between the coast and Cumberland  Plain. For  the purposes of  this study,  the distribution of  the four  language groups (Figure 3.1)  present at contact, the Darkingung, Guringai, Darug and Tharawal, will be tested.  land use strategies and habitations Early sources suggested that there was little contact between the coastal and inland tribes (e.g.  Tench 1793, Collins 1798[1975]). This was based on differences in economic behaviour as well  as on findings made during early explorations that the Port Jackson Aborigines had no knowledge  of the country north or west of Parramatta, nor south of the Georges River (Phillip 1792, Tench  1793, Barrallier 1802). A complete separation of ‘hunters and fishers’ was reported, presumably  in terms of coastal and inland groups, and some archaeological interpretations agree with this  (Ross 1976, Kohen 1986, Kohen and Lampert 1988). Numerous references indicate that specific  adaptation to different resources existed.   Along the coast, the protein portion of the diet was seen as being entirely based upon  seafood. Captain Cook noted that ‘shellfish is their chief support yet they catch other sorts of fish’  (Cook [Beaglehole ed.] 1955:312). Collins gained some insight into the range of foods eaten; Fish is their chief support  ...  the woods, exclusive of the animals which they occasionally  find in their neighbourhood, affords them little sustenance; a few berries, the yam and fern  root,  the  flowers  of  the  different  Banksia,  and  at  times  some  honey, make  up  the whole  vegetable catalogue. ... The wood natives also make a paste formed of the fern-root and  the large and small ant bruised together; in the season they also add the eggs of this insect.  (Collins 1798[1975]:461-2) terra australis 27 22 </page> <page sequence="8"> Chapter 3: Social Context Archaeological research indicates that this seafood bias in the coastal diet has been overstated  (McDonald 1992a, Megaw 1968a). At the Angophora Reserve site, maritime resources (i.e. fish  and shellfish) contributed to less than 8% of the calorific content of food remains (Wood 1989:82),  while Attenbrow’s Port Jackson work has similarly identified the importance of  terrestrial and  avian fauna in the dietary remains of coastal rockshelter sites, particularly at Balmoral Beach  (Attenbrow 2002: Table 7.2).   Ethnohistoric reports indicate considerable diversity in adaptations to environmental  conditions. Barrallier in his expedition through Darug and Gandangara territory in the early  nineteenth century, describes the swamps in the Nepean River area as being excellent sources of  fish, shellfish and ‘enormous’ eels and he states that; the people from this area usually fed upon opossum and squirrels, which are abundant in that  country, and also upon kangaroo rats and kangaroo, but they can only catch this last one with  the greatest trouble, and they are obliged to unite in great numbers to hunt it.   (Barrallier  1802 [1975]:2-3) Such a kangaroo hunt, with a large group using fire, spears and ‘tomahawks’ was described near a  Menangle Swamp. The participants were spaced at ‘30 paces ... [and] formed a circle [covering]  an area of 1 or 2 miles’ (Barrallier 1802[1975]:3). In the order of 100 people appear to have been  involved in this hunt, suggesting co-operation between several bands.   Lizards and grubs, ‘particularly those which are found in the trunks of trees’ (Barrallier  1802[1975]:6, Collins 1798[1975]:462), were also documented as part of the diet. For the purpose  of collecting these grubs (Cahbrogal) a specific utensil was used, this being described as: a switch about twelve inches long and of the thickness of a fowl’s feather ... One of the extremities  of this stick is provided with a hook. ... [which is used upon finding evidence of these grubs in the  bark of trees having] widen[ed] the hole ... with their axe ... dip their switch into the hole, and, by  means of the hook, draw it out, and eat it greedily. (Barrallier 1802[1975]:6)   Other specialised inland adaptations to localised resources include ‘squirrel traps’ in hollow trees  and ‘decoys for the purpose of ensnaring birds’ (Tench 1793[1961]:154-5). These decoys were  assessed as having great utility as they were full of quail feathers. These structures were described  as complex (see also Phillip in HAR, 1:156 and Collins 1798[1975]:462) and were made of reeds  and ‘underwood’. They were described as being ‘long and narrow, shaped like a mound raised  over a grave; with a small aperture at one end for admission of the prey; and a grate made of sticks  at the other’ (Tench 1793[1961]:154-5). One such structure described by Collins ‘was between  40-50 feet long’ (1798[1975]:462). He also describes animal and bird traps near inland lagoons as  consisting of excavated holes with camouflaged tops.   Early accounts remarked on the tree climbing facility of the inland tribes’ men (Hunter 1793,  Tench 1793, Collins 1798, Barrallier 1802). This was done for the purpose of obtaining possums  (usually with assistance of smoke) and was achieved by cutting notches for toeholds ‘with a  stone hatchet’ (Hunter 1793[1968]:430), Tench 1793[1961]:233). Kohen (1986:46) argues that  possums and other tree dwelling animals were the woodland tribes’ staple, and that edge-ground  hatchets were the dominant subsistence item in the inland toolkit. With the exception of hatchet  heads, evidence for these types of resources procurement is not preserved the archaeological  record. Bones (terrestrial or maritime) are rarely recovered from Cumberland Plain open sites  contexts (e.g. JMcD CHM 2005a, b). Living sites Most early references focus on the bark huts used as Aboriginal dwellings across the region. The  coastal versions of these were described as being larger than the inland ones, being ‘formed of  pieces of bark from several trees put together in the form of an oven with an entrance ... large  terra australis 27 23 </page> <page sequence="9"> Dreamtime Superhighway: an analysis of Sydney Basin rock art and prehistoric information exchange enough to hold six to eight people’ (Collins [1975]:460). Worn-out canoes were often recycled for  this purpose. Tench described a group of five such huts on the northern arm of Botany Bay as a  village (1793[1961]:210). Given the above estimate of the holding capacity of these, groups of up  to 40 people could have been so accommodated. There are other references to ‘villages’ on the sea  coast around Botany Bay and Pittwater (e.g. Collins 1798[1975]:47, Worgan 1788[1978]:26).   The huts of the ‘woodsman’ (Collins 1798[1975]:460), were described as being made of  the bark of a single tree, bent in the middle and placed on its two ends on the ground ‘exactly  resembling two cards, set up to form an acute angle’ (Tench 1793[1961]:154; and see Phillip  1789[1970]:55-57) and ‘affording shelter to only one miserable tenant’ (Collins 1798[1975]:460).  These shelters (gunyahs) would be grouped together, up to a total of nine (Barrington 1802:20).  Observers also noted the use of rockshelters:  They appear to live chiefly in the caves and hollows of the rocks, which nature has supplied  them with, the rocks about the shore being mostly shelving and overhanging so as to afford a  tolerable retreat. (Barrington 1802:20) Collins also commented on the occupation deposit found in shelters, stating: these proved a valuable resource to us, and many loads of shells were burnt into lime, while  other parts were wheeled into gardens. (Collins 1804[1910]:306) The bark constructions in the open have not survived in the archaeological record. The fact that  the majority of Aboriginal occupation evidence for the region derived from shelter sites at the  time this thesis was written (cf. chapter 4) is significant, given that shelters may not have been the  focus for habitation at contact – or indeed the last millennium (JMcD CHM 2005a, b, c).  material culture The material culture of the Sydney region is poorly represented in major museum collections5  (Lampert and Konecny 1989). Drawings and descriptions in journals (e.g. Watling 1794, White  1790[1962] and see Barratt 1981) are thus the best source of this information. These have been  discussed and illustrated extensively in previous research (Attenbrow 2002; Kohen and Lampert  1988; Lampert 1988; Lawrence 1968; McBryde 1979, 1989; Megaw 1967, 1969, 1993; Ross  1976) and only relevant aspects will be described here.    Of interest here are regional and localised differences noted by early diarists, in particular,  those aspects which may be depicted in the art.    Items  of material  culture  include  those  used  for  fishing,  hunting  and  collecting  as well  as weapons. The men’s repertoire included spears (hunting, fishing and ritual), spear throwers,  clubs, ‘swords’ or boomerangs, shields (bark and wooden), and stone hatchets (Bradley 1786- 92[1969]:121-8; Collins 1798[1975]:487; Hunter 1793[1968]:55; Tench 1789[1961]:50,  1793[1961]: 184,191,200; White 1790[1962]; 152). Women’s belongings included fishing hook  and line, digging sticks, various bark items (e.g. dilly bags, fishing tackle, water baskets), wooden  bowls and large shells used as containers (Hunter 1793[1968]:63; Tench 1793[1961]:143-6,  186; White 1790[1962]:157, 201; Threlkeld in Gunson 1974:54, 66-8; Bellinghausen in Barratt  1981:35). 5There are sizeable Australian collections in the British and Pitt Rivers Museums, but the number of items deriving  from Sydney - this point of first contact with European settlement, is not large. Scattered items have been discovered in  obscure museums around the world (Coates 1999). terra australis 27 24 </page> <page sequence="10"> Chapter 3: Social Context Shields  Two  types of  shields were described  in contact Sydney. The first was quite  light, being made  of bark. This type was used by children in practice combat, in defence against sharpened reeds  ‘[with] which they are soon expert’ (Collins 1798[1975]:466).   Threlkeld describes most comprehensively the construction of the wooden shields, albeit  from around the Lake Macquarie area (Awabagal/Guringai tribes). These were ‘three feet long  by eighteen inches ... lozenge shaped, pointed at top and bottom, and pigeon breasted rather than  flat. ... The shields are always painted with white pipeclay and are generally ornamented with a St  George’s Cross, formed by two bands two or three inches wide, one vertical the other horizontal,  coloured red ...’ (in Gunson 1974:68). Rossiyisky describes the wooden shields from the Sydney  area very similarly, although noting that ‘they are daubed with various red and white figures’ (in  Barratt 1981:23; my emphasis). Bellinghausen adds that these shields had a ‘dry white colouring  substance over which was painted red stripes’ (in Barratt 1981:41).   No mention was made in any of the early references to shield designs varying across the  region, although Campbell’s illustration of a Yoo-lang ceremony (1798[1975]: Appendix 6; Plates  4, 5 and 6) shows a variety of shield designs, none matching that of Threlkeld (and see shield  designs and other material objects depicted in drawing of Bennelong in McBryde 1989: Plate  19).   Further  reference  is made  to  this  item of material  culture  in  the  synchronic  analysis  of  the art. The shield motif, particularly in the engraved assemblage, is dispersed widely along the  coastal strip. ceremonial behaviour and initiation The evidence for local ceremonial behaviour is of primary importance in assessing the nature of  social interaction across the region. Linguistic differences indicate a separation of groups across  the landscape. The ceremonial activities observed indicate that there was an overriding similarity  and larger scale group cohesion amongst the peoples of this culture area. These people, however,  spent most of their time in distinctive areas, speaking different languages and/or dialects.    Corroborees were observed in the first years at the settlement, and there is evidence that  both genders took part in these at varying stages (Collins 1798[1975]:486). Dancing and singing  played an important part in ceremonial behaviour as did body painting.   All groups from the hinterland were described as having very similar bungung (e.g.  Mathews 1897c, 1897e). The main reason cited for these ceremonies was the initiation of young  men. A subsidiary reasons was the resolving of ‘tribal wrongs which may have been perpetrated  since the last initiation gathering’ (Mathews 1897c:10).  The ethnohistoric and later reports all describe the initiation ceremonies as involving a  number of neighbouring ‘tribes’ and large gatherings of people (Collins 1804[1910]:311; Mathews  1897c:1-2; Mathews and Everitt 1900:276). Men only took part in the initiation of young men.  The women remained in a separate camp (Mathews 1897c, Mathews and Everitt 1900) where it  could be presumed (Bell 1983) that they undertook ceremonies of their own. Indeed Mathew’s  description of the women during the bungung ceremony, suggests just this: Every morning the mothers of the novices, accompanied by all the old women of the tribes  present, repair to the watyoor [a specially prepared area], and light one or more fires in the  cleared space, around which they sit and sing songs which have reference to the novices. ...  These women are collectively known as the yanniwa, and the young women or children, or  any of the men, are not permitted to go near them when assembled at the watyoor. (Mathews  1897c:7) terra australis 27 25 </page> <page sequence="11"> Dreamtime Superhighway: an analysis of Sydney Basin rock art and prehistoric information exchange Mathews describes Darkingung and Gandangara ceremonies as involving the construction of bora  rings and ground sculptures, the latter usually involving large earthen sculptures of Daramulan  the ‘sky god’ (Mathews 1904:see below). There is no suggestion amongst any of these sources  that rock engravings of such figures served this same purpose.   Collins’ description of a Yoo-lang tooth avulsion ceremony (1789[1975]:466-86; Plates 1 -  8) is based on an eyewitness account made on the 25th January 1795. The ceremony was held in  Farm Cove in Cadigal territory, and was presided over by the Cam-mer-ray elders. Also present  was ‘Pemulwoy - a wood native’ (Collins 1798[1975]:466) and leader of the Botany Bay Bidiagal  tribe (Bridges 1970, Dawes 1790). No bora ring was constructed, or earth sculptures built, but an  ovoid area was cleared.   Mathews described tooth avulsion for all initiated males in Darkingung, Gandangara and  Tharawal speaking areas (Mathews 1897c, Mathews and Everitt 1900). Collins (1798[1975]) also  described the practice in the Sydney Eora area. Phillip described the Guringai Pittwater people  as also ‘missing a front tooth’ (HR NSW 1[2] 1893[1978]:131). However, there is conflict in the  ethnographic literature and ethnohistoric documentation. Mathews is unequivocal in his description  of tooth avulsion taking place, specifically amongst the Darkingung and the Gandangara. He says  of the former: the time spent at [these ceremonies] occupies about a fortnight. ... About the middle of this  period, preparations are made for the extraction of one of the novice’s upper incisor teeth.   (Mathews 1897c:7)  and; Early the next day the boys ... are shown a colossal horizontal image of Dharamulan ... After  that, one of the front upper incisors is punched out of each novice in succession.  (Mathews  and Everitt 1900:279) On the other hand, one of the major stated differences between the coastal and inland people was  that the latter did not practice tooth avulsion (Ross 1988:48, 1990:3-4). The statement is based on  comments by Tench (and Phillip HR NSW 1[2] 1893[1978]:131), made on an early journey to the  Nepean/Hawkesbury, in which two natives met with on the River had not ‘suffered the extraction  of a front tooth’ (Tench 1793[1961]:230).    The ethnohistoric sources are equivocal. Most sources only commented on the rare presence  of both teeth, rather than the more common absence. Tench, for instance, comments that ‘the  deficiency of one of the fore teeth of the upper jaw ... we have seen in almost the whole of the  men’ (Tench 1793[1961]:46; my emphasis). Phillip also noted (1789[1970]:42) that ‘several old  men were seen [in an excursion to Broken Bay] who had not lost the tooth nor had their noses  prepared to receive that gross appendage [long bone or stick]’.  This evidence is inconclusive and could be interpreted in three ways. Either;  i) the people located in Port Jackson with both their front teeth were visiting the coast  from inland tribes;  or,   ii) tooth avulsion was not universal on the coast or inland;  or,   iii) the men seen on the coast with both upper incisors had not yet been initiated [see  Collins’ comment about a novitiate who fled in fright during his Yoo-lang when it  came time to remove his tooth (Collins 1798[1975]:481)].  A gender and location specific trait was described for the coastal women in Sydney. There are no  conflicting reports on this practice. This form of social identification involved the removal of the  terra australis 27 26 </page> <page sequence="12"> Chapter 3: Social Context first two joints of the little finger on the left hand. There is no evidence that this was initiatory, in  the normal sense of the word, since by all accounts it was performed very soon after birth;  the operation is performed when they are very young, and is done with a hair, or some other  slight ligature. This being tied around at the joint, the flesh soon swells, and in a few days ...  the finger mortifies and drops off. (Collins 1798[1975]:458)  Collins interprets this as a practical solution: ‘these joints of the little finger were supposed to be  in the way when they wound their fishing lines over their hands’ (Collins 1798[1975]:458). It also  been interpreted ‘fishing magic’ (Leroi-Gourhan 1968, Marshack 1972):  [the mortified section] was taken out into the bay, and with great solemnity, committed to  the deep. The belief was that the fish would eat this part of the girl’s finger, and would ever,  thereafter, be attracted to the rest of the hand from which it had come. Thus [she] would always  have success at fishing because of the peculiar lure in her fingers. (Scott 1929[1982]:4) Whatever the cause, this form of mutilation readily identified the women from the coastal tribes,  and is firm evidence for the maintenance of group identification at a personal level. There is a  shelter site near Mackerel Beach (Pittwater) in which the (left) hand stencils have been identified  as female, based on the fact that the little finger is extremely short.  These issues were discussed in some detail in the original research since the practices of tooth  avulsion, bodily mutilation and body decoration are excellent examples of a public information  system (Wobst 1977) operating in contact Sydney. Indeed, in terms of boundary maintenance  and group identification, these means would have been extremely effective. If tooth avulsion did  occur in one part of the region and not in another, one might assume that a significant cultural  boundary,  or  at  least  group  affiliation,  existed  and was  being demonstrated. Such  a  boundary  might be reflected by an art style boundary.  Culture Heroes Mathews prodigiously documented ceremonial events practiced in the late nineteenth century,  which he described as the Bora Religion.   Biaime is the principal hero in the Bora mythology (Mathews 1904:340) and is said to have  had his home in an outcrop of granite near the town of Byrock, approx 740km from Sydney. The  outcrop was called Bai by the Aborigines, this word ‘signifying the semen of men and animals’  (Mathews 1904:340). Dharamulan was: a sort of half brother or near relative of Baiame’s. His name is made up from dhurra, thigh,  and mulan, one side, the whole name meaning leg-on-one-side, as he is said to possess one  leg only. ... He has a voice like rumbling distant thunder. It fell to his lot to separate the youths  from their mothers and teach them the Burbung ceremonies. ... A bullroarer is also frequently  called Dharamulan, its humming sound ... represents his voice. ... he has the magical power  of changing his shape, and making his body smaller and larger at pleasure ... (Mathews  1904:343-5) Radcliffe-Brown (1930) describes the myth of the rainbow serpent as being ‘the belief in a gigantic  serpent which has his home in deep and permanent water holes and represents the element of water  which is of such vital importance to man in all parts of Australia’ (Radcliffe-Brown 1930:343). In  New South Wales he states: [the] cult of the karia (rainbow serpent) was often an element of the Bora or initiation  ceremonies of the NSW tribes. ... Many of the sacred Bora grounds had representations of  the serpent in the form of a sinuous mound of earth up to 40 feet or more ... beliefs about  the rainbow serpent were explained to the younger men, [as they were for] Biaime [whose  terra australis 27 27 </page> <page sequence="13"> Dreamtime Superhighway: an analysis of Sydney Basin rock art and prehistoric information exchange representation in earth occurred at] practically every Bora ground ... (Radcliffe-Brown  1930:345)  Mathews (1904) also describes a Darkingung story with a ‘mythical malevolent creature  resembling a man whose body had a red glow like burning coals, who had his abode in rocky  places on the sides and tops of mountains. ... His name was Ghindaring (Mathews 1904:345).  The Gandangara and Tharawal had an aquatic monster called Gurungaty, who ‘resided in deep  waterholes, and would drown and eat strange blacks, but would not harm his own people’. The  Tharawal had another fabled monster Mumuga, who possessed great strength and resided in caves  in mountainous country. He had very short arms and legs, with hair all over his body but none  on his head. While being unable to run very fast, ‘he evacuates all the time as he runs, and the  abominable smell of his ordure overcomes the individual, so that he is easily captured’ (Mathews  1904:345).   Art The early accounts of rock art in the region are minimal. None of the early writers sought informed  opinion about the art they observed, and the conclusion most often drawn was that these were the  doodles of children. One reference (Angas 1847 [1969]) suggests that these sites were the domain  of the local ‘priests’ (see below), but this was an observation made well after the impact of contact  on social organisation within the region. It was only much later (e.g. Elkin 1949, McCarthy  1947b, 1956, 1959a) that ceremonial significance was attributed, by ethnographic analogy, to the  engraved art in the region.    Arthur Phillip recorded the earliest reference [on 22nd April 1788] to the widespread  distribution of engraved Aboriginal art: In all the excursions of Governor Phillip, and in the neighbourhood of Botany Bay and Port  Jackson, the figures of animals, of shields, and weapons, and even of men have been carved  upon  the  rocks,  roughly  indeed, but  sufficiently well  to ascertain very  fully what was  the  object intended. Fish were often represented, and in one place the form of a large lizard was  sketched out with tolerable accuracy. On the top of one of the hills the figure of a man, in the  attitude usually assumed by them when they begin to dance, was executed in a still superior  style.  (Phillip 1789[1970]:58) Phillip expressed surprise that the local inhabitants had developed an art form prior to other  aspects of ‘civilisation’, illustrating the settlers’ total incomprehension of the nature of the society  confronting them:  That the arts of imitation and amusement should thus in any degree precede those of  necessity seems an exception to the rules laid down by theory for the progress of invention.  But perhaps it may better be considered proof that the climate is never so severe as to make  provision of covering and shelter of absolute necessity. Had these men been exposed to a  colder atmosphere, they would doubtless have had clothes and houses, before they attempted  to become sculptors.  (Phillip 1789[1970]:58) Other early commentators also noted the presence of the engravings around the settlement. In  Botany Bay ‘on many of the rocks are to be found delineations of the figures of men and birds  very poorly cut’ (Tench 1789[1961]:79). In Port Jackson:  various figures [are] cut on the smooth surfaces of  large stones. They consisted chiefly of  representations of the natives in different attitudes; of their canoes; of several sorts of fish and  animals, and considering the rudeness of the instruments with which the figures must have  been executed, they seemed to exhibit tolerably strong likenesses. (White 1790[1962]:141)  terra australis 27 28 </page> <page sequence="14"> Chapter 3: Social Context George Angas ‘discovered’ the engravings in the 1840’s (Angas 1847[1969]:201). He and one of  his friends took ‘Old Queen Gooseberry’ (Bungaree’s wife)’ as a guide to visit numerous groups  of carvings on North Head, and to tell them ‘what she knew’ about them (Angas 1847[1969]:202).  Angas says ‘[a]t first the old woman objected, saying that such places were all koradji or ‘priests’‘  grounds, and that she must not visit them; but at length, becoming more communicative, she told  us all she knew and all that she had heard her father saying about them’ (Angas 1847[1969]:202).  Unfortunately, Angas does not record the stories he was told.   The systematic recording of engraving sites (including their geographic locations) did not  commence until the late 19th century, when R.H. Mathews (e.g. 1895a, 1895b, 1895c, 1895d,  1896b, 1896c, 1897a, 1897b, 1897d, 1898a, 1899) and W.D. Campbell (1899) became interested  in the task.   A comparison of Mathew’s sketches of earthen sculptures (cf. Mathews 1896a: Plate 1)  with the Sydney style engravings does reveal some similarities: both are simple outline depictions,  mostly large, of anthropomorphs, birds and animals. Elkin (1949) and McCarthy (1961) made  much of these similarities in their interpretations of the Sydney art. In particular, Mathews’ and  Howitt’s documentation of the Bora Religion and its principal mythical ‘culture heroes’, the  rainbow serpent, Dharamulan and Biaime (Howitt 1904; Mathews 1904, 1908; Radcliffe-Brown  1930) were pivotal to McCarthy’s interpretations of the Sydney engravings (e.g. 1956, 1959a,  1961).   Elkin states that rock engravings ‘were cut to serve as records and symbols of historical,  moral and totemic import which could be and were interpreted’ (Elkin 1949:32). The work of  Elkin (1949), McCarthy (1961) and Sim (1966a) has been interpreted as indicating that the  second part of male initiation ceremonies took place in rock engraving galleries (Morris 1978:50),  specifically  those  assemblages  containing  depictions  of  mythical  beings  (Elkin  1949:135,  McCarthy 1959a:213, Morris 1978:43).   Morris explains Collins’ 1795 eyewitness account of such a ceremony (which does not  mention the use of rock engravings) as being only a partial record of the overall event with the  more secret-sacred aspect taking place in the absence of women and Europeans, presumably on a  nearby engraving site. Collins account, however, describes only men and the novitiates as being  present at the tooth avulsion ceremony that he witnessed (1798[1975]:467-85). Interestingly,  Mathews also speculates that Collins only witnessed part of the entire ceremony, on the basis  that no bora ring or earthen sculptures were mentioned in Collin’s account (Mathews and Everitt  1900:281).   An alternative but equally appropriate interpretation is that while the ceremonies within the  region were analogous, they were not identical.  The unsubstantiated ethnographic analogies such as those made by Elkin (1949), McCarthy  (1961), Sim (1966a) and Morris (1978) about engravings in the region must be considered as  tenuous. It is possible that the engravings were connected with ritual behaviour, but this was  not documented. The fact that eyewitness accounts of ceremonies (e.g. Collins 1798[1975]) and  ethnographic descriptions (Mathews and Everitt 1900) do not mention the art as having a role in  these ceremonies tends to weigh against it - at least at European contact. Body marking and personal attire Ambition must have its badges, and where cloathes (sic) are not worn, the body itself must  be compelled to bear them. (Phillip 1789[1970]:42) It is obvious from early accounts that the Sydney Aborigines practiced, and had a considerable  sense of, body decoration.  Notwithstanding the disregard they have shewn for all the finery we could deck them with,  they are fond of adorning themselves with scars, ... It is hardly possible to see anything in  terra australis 27 29 </page> <page sequence="15"> Dreamtime Superhighway: an analysis of Sydney Basin rock art and prehistoric information exchange human shape more ugly,  than one of  these savages  thus scarified, and farther ornamented  with a fish bone stuck through the gristle of the nose. The custom of daubing themselves with  white earth is also frequent among both sexes ...  (Tench 1789[1961]:47) The references to body painting indicate that women and men had equal access to pigment  materials. It may be assumed, then, that both genders indulged in other forms of artistic behaviour  - such as the pigment art - using these materials.  While there is some question that the cicatrices observed were purely for decoration (cf.  Mathews 1898b, 1904), other aspects of personal adornment can have had no other purpose: To their hair by the means of yellow gum, they fasten the front teeth of kangaroo, and the  jawbone of a large fish, human teeth, pieces of wood, feathers of birds, the tail of the dog,  and certain bones taken out of the head of the fish, not unlike human teeth [otoliths?]. The  natives who inhabit the south shore of Botany Bay divide their hair into small parcels, each  of which they mat together with gum, and form them into lengths like the thrums of a mop.  (Collins 1798[1975]:457) Collins further described the use of pigments for body decoration ‘on particular occasions’, stating  that red signified fighting, while white was used for the more ‘peaceful amusement’ of dancing  (Collins 1798[1975]: 457). He also gave the fullest description of the nature of body decoration,  and indicates that there was considerable variation present (see also illustrations by the anonymous  Port Jackson painter, in McBryde 1989: Plates 9, 13, 31, 32). The descriptions indicate that body  painting designs may have personal (i.e. not a controlled group schema) although this is not  certain. He says: The fashion of these ornaments was left to each person’s taste; and some, when decorated  in their best manner, look perfectly horrible ... In general waved lines were marked down  each arm, thigh and leg; and in some the cheeks were daubed; and lines drawn over each rib,  presented to the beholder a truly spectre-like figure. ... Both sexes are ornamented with scars  upon the breast, arm and back ... in some instances these ... resemble the feet of animals.  (Collins 1798[1975]:457-8) There  is extensive evidence  that body scarification was widespread  in  the Sydney  region  (see  illustration by the anonymous Port Jackson painter in McBryde 1989: Plates 9, 11, 31; and Megaw  1993: Figure 14a).    Mathews’ (1904) work around the Upper Lachlan River indicated that body scarification  was related to totems and food avoidance. The position and extent of the scarring was regulated  by  the customs of  the  tribe  to which  the novice belongs. Mathews  indicated  that  scarification  was an ongoing process for identifying which foods were no longer taboo. The position of the  scars signified the type of animal being released from prohibition. The goanna was marked on  the shoulders below another row of scars which denoted the emu, tree grubs were marked by  vertical cuts on the left arm, the carpet snake on the chest, below collar bone, and so on (Mathews  1904:262-269).     Mathews does not describe whether the order is dictated by the individual’s totem,  although it could be assumed that this would be the case. It is likely then, that different moieties/ sections would be differently scarred, and that this would have acted as information to the general  group about an individual’s totemic affiliations, as well as level of initiation. It too would have  been a facet of social cohesiveness.    Items of apparel observed around the region included various bands worn around the  head, neck and waist (Collins 1798[1975]:459, 465-6; Tench 1793[1961]:186) and Collins also  described the ritual gear associated with tooth avulsion. Each novitiate, after tooth removal, was  given ‘a girdle around his waist in which was stuck a wooden sword; a ligature was put around  his head, in which were stuck slips of the grass-gum tree: which, being white, had a curious and  not unpleasing effect’ (1798[1975]:484-5, Appendix 6; plate 8).   terra australis 27 30 </page> <page sequence="16"> Chapter 3: Social Context  There were rare reports of possum skin rugs being used in the region. Phillip described  one such cloak found near the Hawkesbury River as being ‘made of the skins of the opossum and  flying squirrel, very neatly sewed together, the inside ornamented in diamonds of curved lines, by  raising the skin with the point of a small bone, which is made sharp for the purpose’ (HR NSW  1[2] 1893[1978]:310). This example was apparently much smaller than those observed on the  southern Tablelands (Flood 1980), being described by Bradley as of the size ‘to cover a child’  (1786-1792[1969]:167-8). The paucity of references to these (e.g. also White 1790[1962]:156;  Collins 1798[1975]:486) suggests that the items were rare (cf. the number of references stating  that the Aboriginal people wore nothing e.g. HR NSW 1[2] 1893[1978]:129, 132, 222; Hunter  1793[1968]: 59; Stockdale 1789[1950]:44; Tench 1789[1961]:36,47); Worgan 1788[1978]: 13,  18).   Some items of apparel and body markings depicted on anthropomorphic figures in the art  include:    bands (on head, neck and waist);    body painting designs;    designs representing cicatrices;    hair ‘styles’ and headdresses;     (possibly) nose bones; and,    (possibly) possum-skin cloaks. The impact of european contact on Aboriginal society While the European settlement in Port Jackson affected most severely the Aboriginal groups  living south of the Harbour, the Aboriginal occupants of Broken Bay and the Hawkesbury River  were also in contact with Europeans in 1788. Governor Phillip and a party of men in a long boat  and cutter explored this northern waterway only a few weeks after the First Fleet arrived. First  contact here was friendly and Phillip commented on the large numbers of people in Brisbane  Water and Pittwater (Phillip 1789[1970]:40).  The 1789 epidemic caused major cultural upheaval that was not restricted to the immediate  environs of the settlement.  On visiting Broken Bay, Collins noted: The pox has not confined its effects to Port Jackson, for on many places our path was covered  with skeletons, and the same spectacles were to be met with in the hollows of most of the  rocks in the harbour. ... (1798[1975]:496) As European settlement expanded, the Aboriginal population dwindled rapidly. In 1840, only 35  Aboriginal names were listed in the Gosford census: and by 1841, only 16 years after the opening  of the Lake Macquarie Mission, Threlkeld had to close down because he ran out of Aborigines to  teach. Government blanket returns also illustrate the decline in the Aboriginal populations. The  evidence suggests that traditional life continued for a short time after contact. The diabolical 1789  epidemic, however, must have severely affected social organisation. An indication that the fabric  of society quickly disintegrated is in the very low frequency and restricted distribution of contact  art, i.e. motifs of European subject completed in the traditional style.   Relatively few contact motifs have been recorded and these are restricted to the environs  of Broken Bay and the Hawkesbury River. None of these occur close to or south of Port Jackson.  Many of these motifs are in areas from where Europeans would have been first sighted from a  distance and usually across the water, in boats (McDonald 2008).  terra australis 27 31 </page> <page sequence="17"> Dreamtime Superhighway: an analysis of Sydney Basin rock art and prehistoric information exchange  Mathews observed ‘blacks in the Wollombi district execut[ing] paintings in caves up till  1843 ‘ (Mathews 1895c:56). While isolated artistic incidents may have occurred up until this time,  it is clear, that within 50 years of white settlement the population had been drastically reduced and  the culture which had previously thrived no longer existed in its pre-contact form.  The art of the region, and its associated archaeological evidence, survives without the  traditions which created, explained and gave it purpose. Ethnohistory provides evidence for the  complexity of the social system operating here at contact. The archaeological record supports  some early accounts and often provides supplementary evidence. There are instances where the  archaeological record refutes early accounts (e.g. dietary focus, the distribution of tooth avulsion  and some aspects of mortuary behaviour). The 1789 smallpox epidemic means that social traits  and organisation observed after this time must be viewed with extreme caution. Archaeological  evidence for long term changes preceding the arrival of white settlers also indicates that projecting  these interpretations into the past must be done cautiously.   The relevance of ethnohistoric evidence to patterning in the art From the evidence gleaned it is possible to propose a behavioural model for the region. It is also  possible to suggest how certain features of traditional life might affect, or be reflected in, the art  of the region. The following aspects are relevant: 1)  four languages are recognised as being spoken across the study area at contact. These are  the Darkingung, Guringai, Darug and Tharawal.  The assumed geographic distribution of the four language groups will be based on Capell’s  model (Figure 3.1). Certain of the boundaries will be tested in an effort to resolve existing  conflicts  in  interpretation (viz. Kohen 1986, Ross 1976). Testing should also consider a  watershed model (viz. Peterson 1976) contra a creekline equals boundary model; 2)  residence groups ‘bands’ in the region consisted of named economic units with designated  tracts of land. ‘Tribes’ are perceived as having comprised a number of these smaller residence  groups, speaking dialects of a common language. Within the range of any one linguistic  group or tribe, there would have been a number of smaller localised bands (maybe as many  as fifteen) who would have had kin and/or totemic links with people in other groups and  therefore modes of access to resources; 3)  considerable social interaction within and across linguistic boundaries occurred. Organised  social events (initiation ceremonies, dances etc.), as well as the exploitation of windfall  resources (such as whale feasts) resulted in aggregations of large numbers of people of  mixed language groups. Ritual behaviour in the region required the participation, and  possibly consent, of neighbouring tribes; 4)  there is no evidence for a rigid demarcation of territorial boundaries, although many of  the initial observations did occur on the resource rich coastal strip and possibly within one  linguistic group. The evidence suggests that the maintenance of clearly defined territorial  boundaries was an unlikely behavioural trait. The spatial organisation of art traits may  not demonstrate characteristics of smaller scale boundary maintenance (Wobst 1977),  particularly at the band level; 5) the presence of distinguishable, localised bands as well as broader language boundaries  suggests that there may have been a highly complex pattern of artistic behaviour and  signatures within and across tribal (linguistic) ‘boundaries’; terra australis 27 32 </page> <page sequence="18"> Chapter 3: Social Context 6)  there is no direct evidence that art played a primary role in ceremonial behaviour, nor that  it had any mortuary significance;   7)  food resources, economic options and adaptive material culture and modes of personal  adornment varied across the region. This could be reflected in the different emphasis on  maritime and land animals on the coast and inland, as well as a differential distribution of  certain material culture items and body decoration; 8)  to the north and south of the region, economic differences (east - west) may be reinforced by  cultural difference. In both of these areas linguistic boundaries existed at contact between  a coastal and hinterland peoples. The absence of sandstone (art sites) on the Cumberland  Plain makes resolution of the Darug/Eora debate beyond analysis in this context;  9)   contact motifs occur in the art in areas where the first contact/sighting was made and where  the production of art retained its cultural milieu. The 1789 epidemic means that the time  scale for such motifs within the fully functioning artistic system was extremely limited.  The fact that so few post-contact motifs do occur suggests that the cultural destabilisation of the  region should not affect the integrity of cultural traits in the prehistoric art assemblage.   terra australis 27 33 </page> </plain_text>
