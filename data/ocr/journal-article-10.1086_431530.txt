      <p>To Europeans, the vast, seemingly impenetrable rain forests and swamps of Amazonia have long represented the epitome of virgin, chaotic nature. In recent decades, however, anthropological and archaeological research has presented a completely different picture. For thousands of years, the tropical lowlands of South America have been populated by many different cultures and societies that have left their marks on the landscape. I would like to review some of the evidence that has contributed to this shift of perspective and to offer an interpretation of the processes that, over the millennia, have generated the cultural diversity of indigenous Amazonia. This interpretation is based on a synthesis of ecological, economic, and cultural perspectives on the emergence and interrelations of the different ethnic groups involved. A fundamental point of departure is the recognition that Amazonia in the first millennium BC was part of a continentwide trade network and that a variety of phenomena, including ethnic identity, linguistic differentiation, cosmology, stylistic diffusion, warfare, kinship, marriage strategies, stratification, subsistence, and environmental change, should to a considerable extent be understood as products of the dynamics of this larger system.2</p>
      <p>The reconstruction of Amazonian prehistory3 raises issues of general theoretical interest for our understanding of the emergence of domestication, sedentism, and social stratification in several parts of the prehistoric world. The focal questions seem almost universally the same: What kinds of social processes are signified by the appearance of domesticates, permanent settlements, longdistance exchange, and evidence of status differentiation? How are the geographical distributions of various elements of material culturesuch as ceramic styles or subsistence technologiesrelated to ethnolinguistic or other divisions recognized by prehistoric populations, and what do these divisions in turn signify? It is my hope that tracing the ethnoarchaeological continuities in the Amazonian material will provide sounder foundations for interpretation than are usually available in the archaeology of Neolithization4 and that the similarities in the material record will prove significant enough to warrant consideration of possible parallels with other areas. I believe that generalization may indeed be possible at the abstract level of issues such as the relationship between material culture, language, and ethnic identity, the relationship between ethnicity, economy, and ecology, and the relationship between trade, social hierarchy, kinship, sedentism, and intensification of resource use.</p>
      <p>We should begin by rejecting the image of Amazonia as pristine wilderness. The physical evidence alone forces us to reconceptualize the region as in some respects a <italic>cultural</italic> landscape. Studies in historical ecology suggest that more than 12% of the supposedly pristine Amazonian rain forests are anthropogenic in origin in the sense that they would not exist in their present form without human intervention (Bale 1993:231). Detailed studies of landscape change among the Kayap and Kaapor in Brazil (Posey 1985; Posey and Bale 1989; Bale 1993, 1994), the Waorani in Ecuador (Rival 1998), and the Nukak in Colombia (Politis 2001) have revealed how even the unintentional deposition of seeds and nuts from wild plants can generate new geographies. In different parts of Amazonia, longabandoned settlements and gardens constitute important resources for contemporary indigenous groups (cf. Oliver 2001:7273). In both dry and wet savannas in Brazil and Bolivia, anthropogenic islands of forest (such as the <italic>apt</italic> of the Kayap) illustrate how human influence under certain conditions can enhance rather than reduce biological diversity. Through intentional and unintentional selection of species, Amazonian huntergatherers have for several millennia been shaping their rain forest environment. Moreover, environmental conditions even in Amazonia can be locally modified by humans to an extent that makes it difficult to argue that the tropical environment precludes the emergence of complex societies based on intensive exploitation of natural resources (Neves 1999:225).</p>
      <p>Extensive areas of dark, anthropogenic soils (or anthrosols) called <italic>terra preta de ndio</italic>, generally densely littered with fragments of pottery, suggest large, sedentary settlements of considerable longevity along the major rivers (Neves 1999:22223; Petersen, Neves, and Heckenberger 2001; Denevan 2001:10410; Lehmann et al. 2003; Glaser and Woods 2004). These finds appear to corroborate the earliest historical reports, for instance, from Orellanas expedition down the Amazon in 1542 (Carvajal 1934), which predate what appears to have been a period of massive depopulation following the introduction of Europeanderived epidemics. Sixteenthcentury European explorers were impressed by the populous chiefdoms lining the banks of the Amazon and farming its periodically inundated, sedimentrich floodplain or <italic>vrzea</italic> (see Hemming 1978, Roosevelt 1993, Porro 1994, Carneiro 1995).5 Judging from discoveries of earthworks such as raised fields (<italic>camellones</italic>), mounds, and causeways in the llanos of Bolivia and Venezuela, significant tracts of wetland savanna were also reclaimed for intensive agriculture and habitation (Denevan 2001:21590; 1991). Add to this the remains of settlements with defensive ditches in various areas (Neves 1999:222; 2001:286; Heckenberger 1996; Heckenberger, Petersen, and Neves 1999; Petersen, Neves, and Heckenberger 2001:97, 99), the many discoveries of prehistoric cemeteries with large funerary urns (see Guapindaia 2001), and the more than 300 finds of rock art in Brazil alone (Pereira 2001) and it will be obvious that Amazonia was thoroughly <italic>inhabited</italic> in 1492. Yet, by the end of the eighteenth century, following the ravages of epidemics, slavery, and European colonization, hardly a trace remained of the once populous chiefdoms of the floodplains.6 These were among the first indigenous societies to succumb to epidemics and slave raids, and their material culture, dominated by organic materials such as wood, fibers, skin, and feathers, has left little for the archaeologists but fragments of pottery. Only in the most isolated, upriver areas, such as the Vaups, eastern Peru, and upper Xing, were fragments of indigenous societies able to survive into the age of ethnography. As a consequence, European travelers in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries have been inclined to perceive the tropical lowlands as the very antithesis of culture.7</p>

               <p>This view of Amazonia draws inspiration from the application of worldsystem type perspectives to precapitalist societies (e.g., ChaseDunn and Hall 1991, Schortman and Urban 1992, Sanderson 1995, Denemark et al. 2000). Although the need for consideration of regional and interregional relations and linkages has considerable longevity in archaeology (see Wilmsen 1972, MacNeish, Patterson, and Browman 1975, Sabloff and Rathje 1975, Earle and Ericson 1977, Fry 1980, Francis, Kense, and Duke 1981) and is often recognized as crucial to an understanding of cultural variation in Amazonia (see Heckenberger 1996:426; Viveiros de Castro 1996:188), attempts to interpret societal development in preColumbian South America in terms of worldsystem dynamics have been few, tentative, and mostly confined to the Andean area (Gassn 2000, Hornborg 2000, La Lone 2000). Nor have studies of worldsystems or interaction spheres in archaeology generally concerned themselves with ethnicity.</p>

               <p>The term Neolithic Revolution or Neolithization is misleading in several ways, but the prehistoric processes which it denotesthat is, the intensification of resource use based on domestication of plants and animals and the emergence of stratified societiesconstitute real challenges for archaeological research not least because such processes on different continents seem to have certain similarities. What I mean by Neolithization is not the <italic>origin</italic> of crop cultivation, which by this time had already occurred in Amazonia for several millennia (Oliver 2001:6566; Heckenberger 2002:118; Neves et al. 2003:34), but a relatively sudden intensification of agriculture in conjunction with the emergence of sedentary, densely populated, and stratified societies. It is important to recognize the gradual domestication of food plants such as manioc as a process distinct from and generally much earlier than Neolithization in this sense. Following traditional usage, however, authorities such as Donald Lathrap have characterized the Amazonian domestication of manioc as a first step in the Neolithic Revolution of the New World (cf.

Twentiethcentury anthropologists and archaeologists such as Julian Steward and Betty Meggers have offered similar interpretations (Meggers and Evans 1957, Meggers 1971).</p>

         <title>Meaningful Places: Fragments of a Prehistoric Arawakan Cartography</title>
         <p>In order to reconstruct the ways in which prehistoric Amazonians may have perceived and engaged with their regional environment, we might begin by considering the role of placenames among contemporary indigenous groups. The Gspeaking Suy of central Brazil, for instance, inhabit a familiar landscape rich in memories, meanings, and reference points (Seeger 1977:35355). When he joined a group of Suy for a canoe trip, Anthony Seeger discovered how essential it was for them to know the names of significant places along the rivers. Like a Suy child, he was taught a number of anecdotes and other oral history connected with the different places and was expected to memorize their names. He recounts a list of 46 toponyms that were pointed out to him during a single trip and adds that the list would have been longer if he had not already been acquainted with some of the territory traversed. Of these 46 names, 12 refer to places where specific kinds of game are abundant, 17 to particular events in the lives of elder Suy, and 10 to geographical peculiarities such as river bends and rapids. Seeger notes that new names are continuously generated and older ones may be forgotten but older men generally know more names than younger men. He concludes that the naming of places serves to socialize and familiarize an extensive geographical area and offers a cultural map consisting of both history and practical knowledge of where to find food and other resources.</p>
         <p>As it can safely be considered a universal human practice, we must assume that a similar kind of mental cartography has preoccupied all the populations that have inhabited Amazonia over the millennia. For our present purposes, an interesting aspect of such cartographical consciousness is its regional extension in space. This has recently been highlighted by the documentation of certain ceremonies among Arawakspeaking groups in the northwestern Amazon (Hill 1993, 2002; Vidal 2003). Here, on the margins of the Amazon and Orinoco Basins, Arawakspeakers have for millennia mediated a lively trade that has connected the central Amazon with the Caribbean in the north and the Andean highlands in the west. The proclivity to trade, forge alliances, and maintain farflung fields of identification is commonly represented as a cultural peculiarity of Arawakspeaking groups throughout their vast, if fragmented, area of distribution from the Antilles to Bolivia (Hill and SantosGranero 2002).8 An important element in their maintenance of a geographically dispersed Arawakan identity, it seems, may have been the recurrent ceremonial recitation of historically significant placenames. Among the Wakunai of the Iana and Guaina tributaries of the Ro Negro, Jonathan Hill (2002:23637) has documented a list of ceremonially chanted toponyms that form a chain reaching from the mouth of the Orinoco over the Ro Negro all the way to the mouth of the Amazon. These named places are often referred to as the homes of mythical ancestors (in particular Kwai, the first human) but reflect a living knowledge of riverine geography that is undoubtedly connected to ancient Arawakan trade routes.</p>
         <p>As signs for meaningful places, toponyms are merely words and in societies without writing risk vanishing with the people who use them. A more tangible and less ephemeral species of signs is the many petroglyphs and rock paintings that have been discovered in various parts of Amazonia (Pereira 2001). The densest concentrations of rock art are along the upper tributaries of the Ro Negro (particularly the Vaups), some of the northern tributaries of the central Amazon (Urubu, Uatum, Erepecuru), and the large tributaries in the southeast (Xing, Araguaia, Tocantins). The concentrations in the northwestern Amazon (Vaups) are of particular interest, as this is an area where we have access to unusually detailed ethnographic information. Local Arawakspeakers say that their ancestors carved the petroglyphs when the rocks were still soft to commemorate mythical events and persons such as Kwai (Zucchi 2002:2089). Tukanospeakers in the area have also assisted anthropologists in deciphering the petroglyphs of the Vaups. They have for centuries lived in close interaction with Arawaks, which has resulted in a cultural affinity that was no doubt accentuated by their joint escape upriver to evade European colonialism, slave raiders, and epidemics (Hill 1996<italic>b</italic>:15859; Aikhenvald 1999<italic>b</italic>; SantosGranero 2002:3536; Heckenberger 2002:111).9 Tukanoans thus share the Arawakan preoccupation with distant, named places commemorating the movements of their ancestors (see rhem 1981:12226), and the Tukanospeaking Barasana have identified one of the petroglyphs on the Pirparan River as Nyi, the mythical place where the first humans were created (Pereira 2001:220). Such ethnoarchaeological connections are not restricted to the significance of archaeological remains in contemporary indigenous mythology but include direct continuities in iconography and material culture. Anthropomorphic petroglyphs by the Vaups, for instance, are identical to the figure of the mythical <italic>yag</italic> mother that the Barasana carve into the floor of the <italic>maloca</italic> (long house) on ceremonial occasions (HughJones 1979:78).10 Similar continuities have been documented on the upper Xing. Iconographic affinities have also been proposed between petroglyphs and prehistoric ceramics, for instance, along the upper Madeira and at Monte Alegre and Marac on the lower Amazon (Pereira 2001:22728). Such comparisons may one day help us generate more detailed hypotheses about the emergence and diffusion of distinct cultural traditions in prehistoric Amazonia. At this point it will suffice to observe that petroglyphs in Brazil can be divided into two fairly distinct traditions that extend throughout vast areas north and south of the Amazon, respectively (Pereira 2001). The northern tradition is dominated by anthropomorphic figures, the southern by zoomorphic designs. The northern style extends into Colombia, Venezuela, and the Guyanas (Pereira 2001) and even into the highlands of Ecuador and northern Peru (Williams 1985, Polia Meconi 1995). Considering the connections with Arawakan cartography ethnographically documented along the upper Ro Negro (see Zucchi 2002:209), it may not be unreasonable to suggest that much of this rock art may reflect the propensity of Arawaks to mark, name, and memorize significant places along their extensive trade routes.</p>
         <p>The broad distribution of the Arawakan linguistic family contrasts with the more consolidated distribution of other large language families in South America, such as the Tukano, the Pano, the Carib, and the G.11 In contrast with the predatory cosmology attributed to other Amazonian groups (see Viveiros de Castro 1992, 1996; Descola 1993, 1994; rhem 1996), the Arawaks ethos emphasizes peaceful relations with other Arawakspeakers even over great geographical distances (SantosGranero 2002). The prohibition of endowarfare has been codified in ritualized greetings serving as reminders that, whatever their genealogical or geographical distance, Arawaks do not kill each other (RenardCasevitz 2002:130).12 Arawaks have also shown a characteristic willingness to incorporate other ethnic groups into their communities, as is exemplified by the history of the upper Ro Negro (Hill 1996<italic>b</italic>, Aikhenvald 1999<italic>b</italic>, Neves 2001) and the upper Xing (Heckenberger 1996:255, 259, 26263, 420; Seki 1999) since preconquest times. Such cultural institutions have undoubtedly been significant for their capacity to integrate remote areas of the South American lowlands into a common, continentwide trade network. From their point of origin somewhere in the northwestern Amazon, Arawakspeakers during the second millennium BC expanded northward along the Orinoco to the Caribbean and south along the Ro Negro to the central Amazon (Heckenberger 2002:1047). From the Amazon area, Arawakan languages continued to spread southward along the Purs and Madeira Rivers to the lowlands of Peru and Bolivia, where Arawakspeaking groups established themselves as middlemen in the trade between the lowlands and the Andean highlands.</p>
         <p>The pervasive presence of Arawakspeakers, with their characteristic cultural emphasis on river navigation, trade, intensive agriculture, hierarchy, and geographically extended identities, undoubtedly played a crucial role in the emergence of a regional exchange system in prehistoric Amazonia. The Arawak phenomenon, however, poses a number of theoretical and methodological problems yet to be resolved. To what extent can archaeological remains of material culture such as ceramic styles be identified with specific ethnolinguistic groups? To what extent can linguistic groups be assumed to represent ethnic entities? To what extent can ethnic groups be assumed to represent some kind of demic, biologicalgenetic continuity over time, as implied by conventional categories that tend to reify peoples or cultures? A new synthesis of Amazonian prehistory will require not only a careful consideration of existing data but also a theoretical perspective that adequately accounts for the relations between material culture, language, and identity.</p>

               <p>Thus, for instance, it was an Arawakspeaker (Lokono) who provided the Moravians in Surinam with a continentwide digest of the location of various ethnic groups and their associated political relationships with each other (Whitehead 2002:73 n.10, referring to Staehelin). In southeastern Peru, the historical memory regarding a common, Arawakan identity in some cases appears to be more shallow (Gow 2002), but Arawakspeakers here appear to share a similar preoccupation with writing history into the landscape (SantosGranero 1998).</p>

         <title>Economy, Ecology, and Ethnicity in a Regional Perspective: The Significance of Trade</title>
         <p>Until recently, anthropological attempts to account for cultural variation in Amazonia in processual terms have resorted to notions of environmental determinism, diffusion, migration, or combinations of these factors (Schmidt 1917; Nordenskild 1930; Meggers and Evans 1957; Steward and Faron 1959; Lathrap 1970; Meggers 1971; Brochado 1984; Oliver 1989; Zucchi 1991, 2002; Wilson 1999; Myers 2004). For several decades, however, most Amazonianist anthropologists have been less concerned with comparative or regional understandings of indigenous cultures over time than with what Christopher Crocker (1977:256) has called the tautological hermeneutics of individual local groups in the ethnographic present. Against this background, the recent appearance of a volume on the comparative history of Arawakan societies (Hill and SantosGranero 2002) is very gratifying. The challenge for a renewed concern with diachronic cultural processes in a regional perspective is to take due account of earlier concerns with ecology, diffusion, and migration while acknowledging more subtle and intangible factors such as politics, exchange, identity, and the autonomous logic of symbolic systems emphasized by most modern anthropologists.13</p>
         <p>The best way to go about this, I believe, is to begin by assuming that cultural and linguistic variation in Amazonia has been generated through a continuous, dynamic interaction between ecology, economy, and ethnicity (fig. 1). Various natural environments have afforded particular populations different options regarding subsistence, economic specialization, and exchange with other groups, and these economic activities in turn have modified the environment as well as provided foundations for ethnic identity construction. Viewed as a regional system of exchange, Amazonia had by the first millennium BC developed a differentiated politicaleconomic structure in which the geographical positions of specific populations contributed to shaping the roles that they came to play within this system. It must nevertheless be emphasized that the indigenous groups engaged in this exchange should be viewed not as passive recipients of impulses from either their economic or their ecological environment but as agents creatively developing their own cultural responses to the economic and ecological niches that were available to them. It is precisely their status as agents or <italic>subjects</italic> that obliges us to include ethnic identity construction and historical selfconsciousness as central factors in our account. Ethnic identity is a product of the dialectic between externally attributed and internally experienced qualities, often closely interwoven with traditional modes of subsistence and the specific kinds of landscapes within which they are conducted (Barth 1969). Ethnogenetic processes (cf. Renfrew 1987, Hill 1996<italic>a</italic>) therefore involve ecology and economy as well as culture, language, politics, and history.<fig-group content-type="figgrp" id="fg1" position="float" seq="1">

         <p>The point of departure of any account of the ecology of Amazonia must be the fact that it harbors the largest contiguous rain forest in the world (approximately 5 million square kilometers) as well as the worlds most voluminous river (with a flow of water 5 times greater than that of the Congo and 12 times that of the Mississippi). The area is customarily described as composed of 98% <italic>terra firme</italic> (older, poorer, and slightly higher land) and 2% <italic>vrzea</italic> (fertile, periodically inundated floodplains along the shores of major rivers). The ecology of the Amazon Basin is actually much more diverse and complex than is suggested by this simple distinction (cf. Moran 1993), but the fertile sedimentary soils of the <italic>vrzea</italic> in any event seem to have been a scarce and coveted resource for prehistoric populations. Intensive cultivation of maize and peanuts may have been conducted on the floodplains as early as the first millennium BC (Roosevelt 1993; Oliver 2001:6566). In addition, these same riverbanks offer the greatest abundance of fish, turtles, manatees, and other aquatic resources. Historical sources indicate that the floodplains were densely populated and intensively exploited when the first Europeans traveled down the Amazon River in 1542, mentioning series of huge settlements obeying a paramount chief, extensive cultivation, and numerous turtle corrals (Carvajal 1934; Porro 1994). Archaeological excavations in the vicinity of Santarm and Manaus have confirmed significant prehistoric population densities, but the actual size of individual settlements is a contested issue. Roosevelt (1993:274) believes that some sites may have had tens of thousands of inhabitants, while Meggers (1992:3536) considers such concentrations ecologically infeasible.</p>
         <p>The occurrence of complex, stratified societies along the main rivers of prehistoric Amazonia should not, however, be reduced to a direct reflection of the fertility of their floodplains. These rivers were simultaneously the main arteries in a continentwide trade network the extent of which we have only begun to appreciate. Access to rare prestige goods from remote areas was, here as elsewhere, an important foundation for ritual and politicaleconomic authority. Such authority, in turn, was what enabled chiefs to maintain densely populated settlements and persuade their followers to intensify the exploitation of natural resources (Heckenberger 2002:118).14 Although most of this trade undoubtedly consisted of organic plant and animal products that had no value for Europeans and quickly decomposed in the tropical climate, leaving no traces in either the historical or the archaeological record, there is plenty of early historical as well as archaeological evidence for such longdistance exchange throughout Amazonia (Lovn 1928; Gade 1972; Lathrap 1973; Oberem 1974[1967]; Roth 1974[192429]; Camino 1977; Lyon 1981; Myers 1983; RenardCasevitz et al. 1986; Boomert 1987; Burger 1992; SantosGranero 1992; Whitehead 1993, 1994; Dreyfus 1993; ArveloJimnez and Biord 1994; Hill 1996<italic>b</italic>; Gassn 1996, 2000, 2002; Kurella 1998; Taylor 1999; Shady 1999; RenardCasevitz 2002).</p>
         <p>Although inferences from historical evidence about precolonial conditions are always risky, the complex ways in which many of these trade relations reflect longestablished and altogether <italic>indigenous</italic> demands and consumption patterns often suggest time depths antedating 1492. For instance, green stone amulets (called <italic>muiraquit</italic> on the lower Amazon and <italic>takourave</italic> in the Guyanas) [See CA+ fig. A] were traded for gold objects and other products from the Vaups, the Orinoco, and the Roraima (Boomert 1987; Whitehead 1994:38). These amulets were often shaped like stylized frogs and may have been connected with a frog cult in eastern Amazonia (Whitehead 1993:29596).15 From three main manufacturing areascoastal Surinam, the lower Amazon (NhamundTrombetasTapajs),16 and the Virgin Islandsthey were traded widely and used, for instance, as prestigious ornaments in womens necklaces and as a medium of elite ceremonial exchange, including brideprice and death compensation (Boomert 1987:3641). Representations of what may be <italic>muiraquit</italic> on ceramics from Santarm, where many such amulets have been found, suggest that they may also have been used as ornaments on womens headbands (Gomes 2001:141).17<fig-group content-type="figgrp" id="fg4" position="float" seq="2">

         <p>Historically, three extensive trade networks converged on the central Orinoco llanos (Hill 1996<italic>b</italic>:14950; Spencer 1998:109). From the north and east, Caribs came to trade blowguns, arrows, baskets, arrow poison (curare), dyes, and pearls for shell beads (<italic>quirpa</italic>), turtle oil, smoked fish, gold, and salt. Arawaks traded forest and savanna products for gold, salt, and cotton textiles from the Chibchan chiefdoms in the northern Andes, and in the south they traded, among other things, gold and curare for shell beads, turtle oil, and smoked fish. Shell beads were used both as prestigious ornaments and as a medium of exchange. They were particularly in demand among Arawakspeakers such as the Achagua in the Orinoco area and were still being produced at the beginning of the nineteenth century by the Otomac in Uruana, on the central Orinoco, where people from all over the llanos regularly came to trade (Gassn 2000:595). Notable in all this trade is the occurrence of foodstuffs. The high population densities and intensive food production on the floodplains should in part be understood against this background. Significant portions of the fish, turtles, and even cassava were evidently produced for export (Whitehead 1994:36).</p>
         <p>The significance of regional trade networks for the formation and reproduction of economically and ecologically specialized ethnic groups can hardly be overestimated. In eastern Peru, the salt cakes traditionally produced by the Campa of the subAndean <italic>montaa</italic> have served as a medium of exchange along the trade routes reaching deep into Amazonia (RenardCasevitz 1993; 2002:13136). Arawakspeaking groups such as the Campa, the Mojo, and the Piro regularly visited the Inca capital, Cuzco, to trade forest products such as medicinal herbs, birds, and tropical hardwoods for Andean metalwork and other highland products. Chiefs among, for example, the Conibo and the Cocama based their power in part on their access to objects of silver and gold obtained from Cuzco through Piro traders (Taylor 1999:199).18 Different lowland groups have been specialized in specific kinds of products. For example, Arawaks in the area were known for their cotton textiles with decorative motifs or feathers woven into the fabric, canoes, and pearls, while Panoans were known for their painted pottery, mats, hammocks, and gourds (RenardCasevitz 2002:133). Such trade reinforces ethnic boundaries while institutionalizing their transgression and cementing interethnic alliances to this day. The Arawakspeaking Yanesha (also known as Amuesha) recognize as real human beings (<italic>ache</italic>) not only other Arawaks such as Campa and Piro but also riverine Panoans such as Shipibo and Conibo. Among the qualities that qualify them for inclusion in this category are their drinking manioc beer and wearing the <italic>cushma</italic> (p. 133). Piro count both Campa and Yanesha as people like us, while marginalized Panoans such as Amahuaca and Yaminahua are classified as wild Indians who walk about naked and eat raw, unsalted food (Gow 2002:155).19 Such moral barriers within the lowlands were generally more difficult to overcome than the ethnic boundaries distinguishing highland and lowland groups with a mutual interest in trade. Along the eastern slopes of the Andes (fig. 2), there has for several centuries been lively interaction between people of the mountains and the lowlands, for instance, between the Quechua and Aymara and the Campa, Piro, and Mojo in southern Peru and Bolivia, between the Quijos and the Omagua in Ecuador and northern Peru, and between the Chibcha (or Muisca) and the Achagua in Colombia (Oberem 1974[1967]; RenardCasevitz et al. 1986; Taylor 1999:199201; Lovn 1928; Kurella 1998; Gassn 2002). From Colombia to Bolivia, the primary agents of this trade have often been Arawakspeakers.20<fig-group content-type="figgrp" id="fg2" position="float" seq="3">

         <p>Indigenous trade in eastern Peru, the northwestern Amazon, and the upper Xing area has encouraged alliances and a certain degree of cultural homogenization without dissolving the ethnolinguistic identities of individual groups. On the contrary, trade and specialization should be regarded as central factors in the very emergence of such ethnic identities. Material culture is an important medium for expressing ethnic specificity but can, as we have seen, be shared by several ethnically distinct groups speaking different languages. Elements of material culture such as ceramic style are frequently adopted from other ethnolinguistic groups (see DeBoer and Raymond 1987, DeBoer 1990). There are many indications that language generally constitutes a more profound core of ethnic identity than material artifacts (see Dixon and Aikhenvald 1991<italic>b</italic>:8; Neves 2001:26768). In the northwestern Amazon, for instance, Tukanoans use their different dialects to define the boundaries for exogamous marriages (Sorensen 1974[1967], Jackson 1983, Aikhenvald 1999<italic>b</italic>), while speakers of various Arawakan dialects are included in the common ethnolinguistic category of <italic>wakunai</italic>, people of our language (Hill 1996<italic>b</italic>:144). In both cases a common language is a fundamental criterion for drawing societal boundaries. To shift language is no doubt generally a more profound transformation of identity than to adopt new elements of material culture.</p>
         <p>By implication, historical linguistics should be able to tell us important things about social processes in the past. However, substantial inferences from linguistics regarding prehistoric cultural processes in Amazonia have been few, contested, and inconclusive. Although much detailed linguistic research has been carried out in the area (cf. Klein and Stark 1985, Campbell 1997), Dixon and Aikhenvald 1999<italic>a</italic>), there seems to be little general agreement on how to interpret the results. Linguists have generally been more hesitant than archaeologists to draw processual conclusions from linguistic data. The latter (e.g., Lathrap 1970; Meggers 1987; Brochado 1984; Rouse 1986; Oliver 1989; Zucchi 1991, 2002) have been inclined to view contemporary language distributions in Amazonia as fairly straightforward reflections of past migrations and the associated diffusion of material culture such as pottery. Linguists have rightly remained skeptical of such essentializing equations of language groups, ceramic styles, and genetically coherent (demic) populations but often seem to have lacked the social theory with which to replace them. While emphasizing the ubiquity of areal diffusion through borrowing and language shifts (Campbell 1997:34652; Aikhenvald and Dixon 1998; Dixon and Aikhenvald 1999<italic>b</italic>; Facundes 2002), their accounts of the social processes historically resulting in such linguistic change rarely make use of anthropological perspectives on ethnic identity formation in relation to regional exchange (e.g., Barth 1969; Jones 1997).21 Renfrews (1987) modification of conventional migration theory shares Lathraps (1970) conviction that language distribution may reflect the expansion of agriculture22 but also opens European archaeology to wider theoretical questions regarding ethnogenesis that have hitherto been lacking in Amazonian archaeology. Recent applications of this concept to Amazonia (Hill 1996<italic>b</italic>, Schwartz and Salomon 1999, Hill and SantosGranero 2002) have usefully reconceptualized historical processes in the area, but its ramifications for archaeology have yet to be consistently worked out. Although there are recurrent concessions to the fluidity and provisionality of ethnic identities in the history of indigenous populations in the region, it has proven difficult, in practice, to abandon notions of essentialized, bounded peoples as coherent, persistent entities to be identified in the archaeological record (see Heckenberger 1996).</p>

               <p>With obvious reference to Roosevelt (1994), Viveiros de Castro (1996:195) writes: As to the hopes of a theoretical new synthesis, I believe that any unification still lies somewhat ahead. Although researchers from opposite traditions, united by the unanimous desideratum of transcending the classical antinomies between nature and culture, history and structure, political economy of change and analysis of monads in cosmological equilibrium, mentalism and materialism, and so on, are certainlyand auspiciouslyedging closer, it is difficult not to see the persistence of attitudes that were characteristic of earlier phases of the discipline. It seems a paradox, I would add, that the anthropological preoccupation with cosmological monads to such an extent has eclipsed the farranging perspectives of earlier generations (e.g., Schmidt, Nordenskild, Tello, Steward, Meggers, Lathrap, scholars who allowed themselves to sense connections between Cuba and the Beni and between Chavn and Maraj) <italic>in the very decades</italic> that have seen the birth and growth of worldsystems analysis.</p>

               <p>In indigenous Amazonia, in particular, many anthropologists have confirmed Clastress (1987) observation that the standard response to any pretense of authority is to walk away and set up a new village elsewhere. To understand the emergence of stratified societies in Amazonian prehistory, we therefore need to reconstruct the outlines of integrative ideologies capable of counteracting such centrifugal forces. The ceremonial life of contemporary Arawakan groups in the northwestern Amazon (cf. Hill 2002) suggests such an ideological system, embedding social hierarchy in compelling constructions of inclusive ethnic identities ultimately founded on familiar notions of consanguinity.</p>

         <title>Linguistic Distribution and Societal Structures</title>
         <p>The archaeologist Donald Lathrap (1970:7479) suggested that the adoption of manioc horticulture propelled the initial expansion of protoArawak and protoTup from the central Amazon around 3000 BC, the former primarily toward the north and west and the latter primarily toward the south and east. He thought that the distribution of language families in Amazonia had been generated by an outward movement of horticulturalists from the central Amazon along the major tributaries and later also along the northern and eastern coasts of South America. This pattern of expansion, he argued, differed from, for example, that of the Panospeakers, who appear to have moved overland across the drainage basins of the Madre de Dos, Purs, Juru, Ucayali, and other rivers in western Amazonia (p. 81). In recent years, as Heckenberger (2002:103) observes, linguists have been able to identify probable areas of origin for Arawak (the northwestern Amazon), Tup (Rondnia), Carib (the Guyana uplands), G (the central Brazilian uplands), and Pano (the borderlands between Peru and Brazil).23 Tup, Carib, and G all appear to have founded their linguistic identity in upland areas and originally traveled primarily on foot, as did the Panoans. This suggests a conspicuous contrast to the Arawak, with their ancient connection to rivers, canoes, and water transport (Schmidt 1917; Lathrap 1970:7374; Neves 2001:273; Heckenberger 2002:1046; Hill 2002:228).</p>
         <p>The distribution of Arawakan languages suggests a pattern of expansion along the very barriers that surround and separate other linguistic families: the Orinoco, Ro Negro, Amazon, Ucayali, Purs, and Madeira Rivers, the llanos of Venezuela and Bolivia, and the coastal areas of Guyana (cf. Heckenberger 2002:1056). [See CA+ fig. B] Considering the discovery of pottery near Santarm dating from the sixth millennium BC (Roosevelt et al. 1991; Neves 1999:219), however, it is unlikely that the highly productive floodplains and aquatic resources in these areas were unoccupied prior to the Arawakan expansion beginning in the second millennium BC. Whether earlier populations were displaced by or incorporated into the Arawakan network, the linguistic distribution maps suggest that the Arawakan expansion created ethnic wedges that contributed to the geographical demarcation of other, spatially more consolidated linguistic families such as the Carib, the Tukano, and the Pano. In some cases, it is even possible to detect how a wedge of Arawakan languages has split a language family, as in the case of the Panoan groups on either side of the Arawaks along the Purs and the Madeira (cf. Erikson 1993:55). The dispersed pockets of Arawakan dialects that have been documented along the river systems from the lower Orinoco to the upper Madeira appear to be the remains of a network of Arawakspeaking societies that in prehistoric times spanned the whole of western Amazonia. In view of their role in integrating regional exchange, these Arawakspeakers should be viewed less as ethnic wedges than as the social glue of ancient Amazonia.<fig-group content-type="figgrp" id="fg5" position="float" seq="4">

         <p>Although Arawakan groups have been characterized as comparatively peaceful and as the undeserving victims of raids by Caribs and others, their societies were undoubtedly the most powerful and expansive polities of preColumbian Amazonia.24 Their identity was based on having appropriated most of the fertile floodplains, dominated trade along the major rivers, and established densely populated and allied chiefdoms along these riverine trade routes. Several of the other Amazonian language families such as Carib, Pano, and G appear at least originally to have been denied access to these resourcerich areas. The difference between the riverbased Arawak and the more marginalized upland groups can to this day be detected in elements of their kinship systems (Hornborg 1998:17980). Kinship terminologies and marriage rules among most Carib, Pano, and G express locally endogamous, atomized, and introverted exchange relations, while many Arawak groups emphasize exogamy (cf. Gow 1991; Hill 1993:910; 1996<italic>b</italic>:144). In some cases, an inclination to extend the category of classificatory siblings codifies the encouragement of distant alliances beyond an expansive field of consanguineous kin (Gregor 1977:277).25 Although Arawaks in the northwestern Amazon are generally patrilineal, the apparent expansiveness of Arawakan identity may in some areas in part have derived from an inclination among offspring of interethnic marriages to identify with their more prestigious, Arawakan parent, irrespective of whether this implied patri or matrifiliation. The Arawakan preoccupation with genealogy and extended kinship categories is rare among Amazonian societies except the Tukanoans, with whom, as we have seen, Arawakspeakers have maintained close cultural interchange for centuries. It is no doubt connected with their equally rare emphasis on social stratification and with their ambition to incorporate rather than confront neighboring groups. Archaeologically, the concern with descent and ancestors is obvious in the many finds of elaborately ornamented burial urns of probable Arawakan affiliation, stylistically distinguished as Guarita, Marac, [See CA+ figs. C and D] Arist, Aru, etc. (see Guapindaia 2001).<fig-group content-type="figgrp" id="fg6" position="float" seq="5">

         <p>Neither Carib, Pano, nor Gspeakers appear to have achieved the same degree of political centralization or social stratification as the Arawak (Heckenberger 2002:115). The Tupspeakers developed extensive chiefdoms to the south and east of the Arawakan sphere of influence, but their expansion seems to have been based more on military conquest than on trade and diplomacy (Brochado 1984).26 From their point of origin in Rondnia, between the upper Madeira and the upper Tapajs, the Tupspeakers expanded eastward and conquered vast territories south of the Amazon and in southeastern Brazil, where the Tupinamb shortly prior to the European arrival had displaced Gspeakers along the coast (cf. Morey and Marwitt 1978:254).27 A westward expansion of Tup languages was also under way when the Europeans arrived, as Tupspeakers had recently established themselves in a narrow zone along the upper Amazon as far west as the Ucayali (the Cocama) and the Huallaga (the Cocamilla) in Peru. The most powerful of these Tupspeaking groups was the Omagua, which at the time of Orellanas expedition in 1542 controlled the floodplain between the Napo and Juru Rivers. The Omagua are reported to have launched annual war expeditions up the tributaries (Lathrap 1970:152; Morey and Marwitt 1978:251). Which ethnic groups or languages the Tupspeakers had displaced or incorporated along the Peruvian floodplains is not known, but Heckenberger (2002:122 n. 6) suggestsunfortunately without much supporting evidencethat the Omagua, Cocamilla, and Cocama were former Arawakspeakers who had recently adopted a Tup lexicon.28 [See CA+ figs. E and F] In the sixteenth century, at any rate, Tupspeaking societies controlled the southern bank of the central and lower Amazon. Although the evidence is inconclusive, Arawakspeakers may at one point have dominated the opposite, northern bank, suggesting that the main Amazon here served as an ethnic boundary.29 [See CA+ fig. G] Demographically and politically, the Arawaks in this area seem to have suffered greater losses from European diseases and slave raids than the Tup or Carib, two ethnolinguistic groups that at this time appear to have expanded at the expense of the enfeebled Arawak. It is significant, not least for our reconstructions of linguistic diffusion along prehistoric trade routes, that the Nheengat trade language that was adopted by Arawakan groups along the Ro Negro in the colonial period had Tup roots (Sorensen 1974[1967]:15253; Aikhenvald 1999<italic>b</italic>:38788; SantosGranero 2002:35; Hill 2002:240). Although beyond the scope of this paper, it appears that the argument against simple migrationism could also be applied to the spread of Tup languages (cf. Brochado 1984:402), which in many areas appear to have supplanted Arawak in the late precontact and contact periods.30<fig-group content-type="figgrp" id="fg8" position="float" seq="7">

                  <p>Historical data on the distribution of indigenous groups belonging to the six major linguistic families of Amazonia. Map created by Love Eriksen using Thiessen polygon interpolation of a total of 2,092 points of encounter between Europeans and Amerindians in Amazonia between 1500 and 1944, based on Nimuendajs Mapa ethnohistrico (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatstica, Rio de Janeiro, 1987). Only 949 of the encounters were with groups subsequently classified as belonging to one of these major families, but many here classified as Others may in fact have belonged to one of them. This compilation indicates, for instance, that there were Arawakspeakers on the north bank of the lower Amazon (opposite the Tapajs and the Xing) in the eighteenth century and that they once controlled the whole length of the Purs, linking the area around the mouth of the Ro Negro with southeastern Peru, and the Caquet, linking it with the highlands of southern Colombia and northern Ecuador. It also points to the presence of Arawakspeakers on the lower Orinoco in the sixteenth century and on the upper Orinoco in the nineteenth.</p>

         <p>A regional systemic view of prehistoric Amazonia also prompts us to rethink the occurrence of warfare and the ideology of predation that has been posited as generic to indigenous cultures in the area (cf. Viveiros de Castro 1996). It would not seem correct to attribute a predatory cosmology to Arawakspeaking groups in general (cf. SantosGranero 2002). To the extent that it has been applicable to, for example, Carib or Tupspeakers, this must to some extent be understood historically in the context of the disorienting demographic, economic, political, and cultural convolutions of the colonial period, involving indigenous groups in slave raids on their neighbors, competition for European trade goods, and the rivalry between Dutch, Spanish, and Portuguese in South America (see Whitehead 1990, 1992; ArveloJimnez and Biord 1994). The European arrival rapidly reorganized the entire regional system and in many areas induced complete reversals in the balance of power between ethnic groups. Seventeenthcentury sources from the Orinoco mention extensive fortifications among the Achagua and other Arawaks on the floodplains, who had been decimated by their encounters with Europeans and were now being subjected to systematic predation by previously marginal groups such as the Carib and the Guahibo (Morey and Marwitt 1978:25153). Although archaeological discoveries of defensive ditches in various areas of Amazonia confirm that warfare was by no means a postconquest invention (Heckenberger 1996:423; Neves 1999:222; 2001:286; Heckenberger, Petersen, and Neves 1999; Petersen, Neves, and Heckenberger 2001:97, 99), in many areas it was undoubtedly exacerbated by social upheavals following the European arrival. To some extent, competition over scarce resources focused on the same kinds of things as before (e.g., prestige goods, now of European origin [cf. Gassn 2000:590]), but the conditions and rules of the game had been decisively transformed.</p>
         <p>Although a recent and authoritative summary of Amazonian linguistics (Dixon and Aikhenvald 1999<italic>a</italic>) advocates extreme skepticism with regard to higherlevel genetic groupings, several studies have suggested various degrees of affinity between the four most important language families in Amazonia: Arawak, Tup, Carib, and G.31 To the extent that there is a foundation for any of these studies, it would lend support to the hypothesis that at least these families are to be seen as products of regional ethnogenetic processes rather than traces of migrations from other parts of the continent.32 The possible significance of ecological factors in such processes also deserves to be considered. Meggers (1982,1987) has suggested that droughtrelated fluctuations in the extent of forest vegetation have contributed to the geographical distribution of different language families, some of which (e.g., horticulturalists such as the Arawak, the Tup, the Pano, and the Carib) were originally confined to distinct forest refugia but subsequently expanded, at the expense of savannadwelling huntergatherers, with the recovery of the rain forest as the climate grew more humid. Dixons punctuatedequilibrium model similarly implies that linguistic families such as Arawak, Carib, and Tup, prior to the punctuation represented by the adoption of agriculture, originated as the result of relative confinement within specific geographical zones (Dixon and Aikhenvald 1999<italic>b</italic>:17). However, ecological factors can be assumed to be significant for the distribution of, for example, Arawak (wetland agriculturalists) and G (huntergatherers of the dry savanna) without any reference to paleoclimatic fluctuations or ecologically induced isolation. On the contrary, an anthropological perspective on the formation of ethnolinguistic identities would emphasize ecologically induced <italic>interaction</italic> rather than isolation (Barth 1969). The geologically recent expansion of Arawakspeakers on floodplains and wet savannas from the llanos of Venezuela to the llanos of Bolivia over the course of a millennium and a half (see Heckenberger 2002:1067) suggests the systematic exploitation of an existing socioecological niche in intensive interaction with the populations of other such zones rather than reflecting postPleistocene changes in biogeography or long periods of homogeneous, egalitarian equilibrium. Furthermore, as studies in historical ecology show, the relation between ecology and cultural identity cannot be a matter of oneway causality when the biophysical environment is continuously transformed by human activity.</p>
         <p>A convincing account of the genesis of ethnolinguistic divisions in prehistoric Amazonia needs to recognize the recursive relation between ecological and economic specialization within regional exchange systems, on one hand, and ethnic and cultural creativity, on the other. The various cultural traits and institutions that enabled Arawakspeakers to integrate longdistance trade networks in ancient Amazonia should be understood not only as prerequisites for but also as <italic>products</italic> of these exchange systems. Cultural patterns do exhibit a certain degree of autonomy and inertia, acknowledged in notions such as ethos or tradition, but rather than replace environmental determinism with cultural essentialism we should ask how the cultural creativity of the protoArawak may have constituted a response to the economic niche afforded them by the opportunities of riverine trade. Heckenberger (2002:121) asserts that he does not wish to replace ecological with cultural determinism, but his recurrent references to the underlying symbolic structure and other cultural features (pp. 11013) of the Arawaks at times seem to echo the essentialist approaches of early diffusionists such as Schmidt (1917) and Nordenskild (1930). Heckenberger suggests (p. 121) that if Julian Steward and his followers had recognized the historical relationship between the various Arawakan chiefdoms in South America, as did Schmidt, they might have come to the startling conclusion that culture, as much as ecology or demography, plays a key role in differential cultural development in Amazonia. The distributional patternthe correlation between language and cultureis unmistakable: Where we find Arawak speakers we typically also find social hierarchy, sedentism, and regionality.</p>
         <p>Although Heckenbergers understanding of the Arawakan expansion is probably the best account to date, he does not offer an analytically distinct alternative to the conclusion of earlier diffusionists that Arawak high cultureunique in the lowlandswas already present in the ancestral Arawakan <italic>peoples</italic> of ancient Amazonia (p. 110, emphasis added). Thus he ultimately fails to bridge the theoretical gap between traditional diffusionism and modern anthropological theories of ethnicity.33</p>
         <p>Instead of treating either ecology or culture as an independent variable, a more dynamic ethnogenetic perspective can illuminate the emergence of cultural traits in a regional and historical perspective by focusing on the historical structures of regional exchange systems rather than ecology or culture in themselves. This would seem to be fertile ground for a synthesis of processual and constructionist perspectives in the study of prehistoric ethnogenesis. Viewed from a regional perspective, as Hill (2002:229) observes, the protoArawakan territories around the Iana and Guaina Rivers in the northwestern Amazon were actually centrally located in relation to the riverine connections between the Orinoco and Amazon Basins. If this was indeed the area in which Arawakan traits and institutions originally developed, it is not difficult to imagine a close connection between their cosmopolitan ethos (cf. SantosGranero 2002) and their role as longdistance traders. When this contagious ethos became entrenched along the trade routes, however, it would be misleading to represent its diffusion in terms of the movement of peoples.</p>

               <p>The language most closely related to Cocama/Omagua is in fact the Tupinambderived trade language Nheengat (Jensen 1999:12931), which was widely adopted by former Arawakspeakers in western Amazonia. Jensen (p. 129, referring to Cabral) is convinced that the Cocama language is a result of a language shift from an unknown nonTup language to Tupinamb. Interesting little clues regarding the ethnic identity of the sixteenthcentury Omagua are Carvajals (1934) references to their exquisite polychrome pottery and, not least, Cristbal de Acuas observation in 1639 that the Omagua obtained this pottery from the Curucirari in exchange for cotton cloth (Hemming 1978:233). In Peru, cotton cloth has traditionally been produced by Arawaks and painted pottery by Panoans (see RenardCasevitz 2002). The polychrome decoration of recent Panoan pottery should probably be traced to their close coexistence with the Cocama during the seventeenth to nineteenth centuries (Lathrap 1970:184; Myers 1976; Brochado 1984:304; DeBoer and Raymond 1987:12829; DeBoer 1990:87, 103). Lathrap (1970) and Brochado (1984) have suggested a general connection between the Amazonian Polychrome Tradition and Tupspeakers. It should be noted, however, that Maraj Islandthe source of the earliest known polychrome ceramics in Amazoniawas inhabited by Arawakspeakers (Aru) at the time of European contact (cf. Meggers and Evans 1957; Aikhenvald 1999<italic>a</italic>:6669).</p>

               <p>According to J.

In Terrence Kaufmans (1994) maps, however, this bank appears to be more or less empty at time of contact. Considering that the worst ravages of Europeanderived epidemics probably occurred long before the actual arrival of European colonizers, both maps may be valid, reflecting the situation around the years 1500 and 1650, respectively.</p>

               <p>Brochado (1984:4023) writes that the importance of the acculturation and incorporation of alien groups by the Guarani and Tupinamb  cannot be overstated. These processes constitute one of the most important mechanisms of population increase through colonization.  In many cases, acculturation and complete physical and cultural absorption of the vanquished was the end result in the long run. These processes of <italic>guaranization</italic> or <italic>tupianization</italic> included the adoption of either the Guarani or the Tupinamb pottery, which makes them identifiable archaeologically. The widespread transition from Barrancoid to Amazonian Polychrome ceramics in many areas from the lower Amazon to the Ucayali (Lathrap 1970, Myers 2004) suggests not so much migration and demic replacement as an ethnolinguistic shift from Arawak to Tup in the centuries before and after the European arrival.</p>

               <p>Geneticists have expected to find a correlation between languages and genes in Amazonia, but CavalliSforza, Menozzi, and Pizza (1994:341) report that it is very difficult to make inferences about the order of entry of the people who today speak Carib, Equatorial [Greenbergs (1987:83) macrocategory including Arawak and Tup], Ge, and Panoan, on the basis of genetic data. They add that it seems natural to suggest that they entered in the order in which they are found in South America, those located farther south being first, implying that Panoan, Equatorial, and G are of roughly the same age. This is highly improbable for several reasons. A general objection would be that the major language families in Amazonia have more discontinuous distributions  than  is found in any other part of the world (Dixon and Aikhenvald 1999<italic>b</italic>:1), which makes it impossible to order them in terms of spatial succession. Both Carib and Arawak, for instance, range from the Antilles to the upper Xing. Among more specific objections would be the conclusion of historical linguists that the Panoan languages, rather than equaling Arawak or Tup in age, indicate a fairly shallow timedepth and recent expansion and split (Loos 1999:227). To their credit, CavalliSforza and colleagues admit that their considerations could have more weight if there was a good correlation between linguistics and genetics in South America but that, unfortunately, there is not, or it has not yet been found. Earlier and similarly futile attempts to find such correlations include Steggerdas (1950) observations on the virtually identical anthropometry of Arawak, Carib, Tup, and Pano.</p>

               <p>In fact Schmidts approach occasionally seems more in agreement with modern understandings of ethnic identity construction and cultural hybridization than some recent accounts of Arawakan migrations. For instance, he made several observations on indigenous language shifts (e.g., among the Kaua and Chan) and explicitly suggested that Arawak served as a trade language in the northwestern Amazon (Schmidt 1917:1921, referring to KochGrnberg and Nordenskild). He also emphasized (pp. 3661) the role of elite gift exchange and (male) exogamy in the expansion of Arawakan culture and observed that the incorporation of nonArawak women would have resulted in the assimilation of ceramic styles and other features from neighboring groups.</p>

         <title>Language, Ceramics, and Prehistoric Identities: Toward a Nonessentialist Approach</title>
         <p>A central challenge for Amazonian archaeology has long been to trace connections between ethnolinguistic groups and ceramic styles. Pioneers such as Nordenskild (1930) observed similarities between pottery from the Caribbean and the lower Amazon and suggested a common, Arawakan origin. Meggers and Evans (1957) discovered similarities between ceramics from the Napo River in Ecuador and from Maraj Island at the mouth of the Amazon and interpreted them as evidence of a downstream migration of groups with Andean roots.34 Lathrap (1970:15051) reinterpreted these same similarities as the result of an upstream migration of Tupspeakers. He went on to suggest a number of other correspondences between the distribution of ceramic styles and presumed migrations of linguistic groups, such as between various fineline incised traditions (Santarm, Paredo, Milagro, etc.) and Caribspeakers (pp. 16470) and between Cumancaya pottery and protoPanoans (p. 140). More central to his argument, however, is the connection between SaladoidBarrancoid pottery and the migrations of Arawakspeakers (pp. 112, 123).35 An important link in this argument is the Guarita style from the central Amazon [See CA+ fig. H], which appears to be related to the Barrancoid ceramics from the Orinoco (pp. 15659). Recent archaeological excavations at sites such as Autuba and Hatahara [See CA+ figs. I and J], near Manaus, confirm this ceramic continuity (Petersen, Heckenberger, and Neves 2003).<fig-group content-type="figgrp" id="fg11" position="float" seq="10">

         <p>Most experts today seem to agree that there is indeed a connection between the distribution of SaladoidBarrancoid ceramics and Arawakan languages but do not share Lathraps (1970:112, 120) conclusion, following from his model of prehistoric migration routes, that these pottery styles originated in the central Amazon.36 Oliver (1989) has attempted to find support for Lathraps hypothesis that ancestral Arawakspeakers brought early ceramic styles from the central Amazon northward along the Ro Negro to the Orinoco, but the absence of chronologically relevant finds along the Ro Negro and the Amazon contradicts such an interpretation (Neves 1999:22829; Zucchi 2002; Gassn 2002:27071). The oldest polychrome ceramics in Brazil may well be the Marajoara style from Maraj Island, dated at around AD 400 (Schaan 2001; Oliver 2001:62; Petersen, Neves, and Heckenberger 2001:101) [See CA+ fig. K]. Such polychrome pottery (red and black on white) also occurs along the lower reaches of larger tributaries such as the Tocantins, the Xing, and the Madeira but generally only up to the first rapids, suggesting a connection with navigable waterways and <italic>vrzea</italic> environments (see Meggers et al. 1988:288).<fig-group content-type="figgrp" id="fg14" position="float" seq="13">

         <p>The occurrence of Guaritarelated pottery on the main rivers from the lower Amazon to the upper Ro Negro toward the end of the first millennium AD probably reflects intense trade relations along these waterways. Guaritatype pottery was manufactured along the entire extent of the Ro Negro up until European colonization. As the whole area along the Ro Negro was inhabited by Arawakspeakers (Tarum, Manao, Bar, and others) at this time, it seems legitimate here to assume a connection between the Guarita style and Arawakan languages (Neves 2001:275). Even today, in the upper Ro Negro area, there is a sharp distinction between the ceramics manufactured by the Arawakspeaking Baniwa on the Iana River and the dark, monochrome pottery made by Tukanoans on the Vaups (p. 274; cf. Aikhenvald 1999<italic>b</italic>:389, referring to Galvo).</p>
         <p>Several additional indications of correspondences between ceramic styles and Arawakan languages have been presented in recent years.37 For instance, Zucchi (2002) has identified a Saladoidrelated ceramic complex (parallel line incised tradition) that she suggests was manufactured by Arawakspeakers on the Iana and other upper Ro Negro tributaries around 1500 BC. On the Brazilian coast just north of the mouth of the Amazon, Guapindaia (2001:16971) has confirmed the connection, posited much earlier by Nimuendaj (1926:23), between Ariststyle pottery from about AD 400 and the Arawakspeaking Palikur documented both historically and ethnographically in the area. Finally, Heckenberger (2002:109) has postulated connections between SaladoidBarrancoid ceramics and Arawakspeakers in four widely separated areas: the West Indies, the Orinoco, the central Amazon, and the upper Xing.38</p>
         <p>There thus seems to be little doubt that pioneers like Schmidt and Nordenskild are being vindicated in having suggested that the distribution of pottery styles can tell us something about the distribution of Arawakspeakers in different parts of South America (fig. 3) [See CA+ figs. LT], but the implications of such correlations are unquestionably more complex than the patterns of prehistoric migrations that they and their followers (e.g., Meggers, Lathrap, Brochado, Oliver, Zucchi) have imagined. Whether or not connected to ecological arguments like those of Meggers or Lathrap, earlier models of ceramic and linguistic diffusion in Amazonia have assumed a too simple relation between diffusion and migration. It may seem reasonable to believe that actual (demic) Arawakspeaking groups brought SaladoidBarrancoid pottery with them during their initial southeastward expansion along the Ro Negro, as seems to be the consensus even among modern Arawakan scholars (cf. Hill and SantosGranero 2002), but at the moment we have no way of knowing <italic>what</italic> actually expanded, whether a population or merely particular ways of talking and making pottery.<fig-group content-type="figgrp" id="fg3" position="float" seq="14">

                     </italic> BC) and the most significant period of reorganization with the close of the Middle Horizon (ca. AD <italic>
                        <sc>1000</sc>
                     </italic>). The Early Horizon is defined by the diffusion of the lowlandoriented Chavn style across the Andean crest and the close of the Middle Horizon by the collapse of the highland polities Tiwanaku and Wari. Rather than Amazonian developments being viewed as repercussions of political developments in the Andes or vice versa, the two processes are better approached as recursively connected within a single system of mutual interdependence.</p>

         <p>Considering the rapidity and apparent ease with which indigenous populations along the Ro Negro were able to adopt the Nheengat trade language and European utensils in the colonial era and a great number of other Amazonian examples of language shifts and interethnic cultural adoptions (cf. Aikhenvald 1999<italic>b</italic>, 2002), it is puzzling that we should continue to think about preColumbian cultural processes in terms of reified peoples migrating across the Amazon Basin. Nheengat is spoken as a first language by some populations on the upper Rio Negro to this day (Jensen 1999:127).39 In view of its conspicuously riverine distribution pattern, there is a distinct possibility that the Arawakan language family (i.e., protoArawak) similarly originated as a trade language of prehistoric Amazonia (see Schmidt 1917).40 At any rate, it should be obvious that more recent ceramic styles were able to spread quite rapidly in different directions along the network of trade routes controlled by Arawakspeakers up until the arrival of Europeans. From this perspective, at least, there is no contradiction between concluding that Arawakan languages and SaladoidBarrancoid pottery styles originally spread eastward along the Ro Negro and the lower Amazon, on one hand, and suggesting that other ceramic styles employed by Arawakspeakers at times may have spread in the opposite direction, on the other. An influential and contagious Arawakan identity may indeed have been founded on a fairly coherent, if provisional, constellation of traits, including language and ceramic style, but this does not allow us to draw any conclusions about population movements. Rather than continuing to reproduce the billiardball model of migrating, essentialized peoples pushing each other across the Amazon Basin and thus generating our linguistic and archaeological distribution maps, we should be asking ourselves what prehistoric linguistic and stylistic diffusion could tell us about communicative processes within a panAmazonian system of exchange relations.41</p>

               <p>This interpretation was shared by Hilbert (1968). Rather than a culturally marginal region passively receiving impulses from upstream, however, the lower Amazon was clearly a major center of innovation. Pottery finds near Santarm may be the oldest on the continent (Roosevelt et al. 1991; Neves 1999:219).</p>

               <p>In fairness to Lathrap, however, we should add that he does consider the possibility that the earliest Barrancoid ceramics originated on the network of waterways connecting the Ro Negro and the Ro Orinoco, spreading along with the Maipuran branch of Arawakan languages mainly during the first millennium B.C.

Such ring villages, in which a circle of extended households surrounds a ceremonial plaza have long been associated with Gspeakers (see Hornborg 1990), but Heckenberger (2002:109) argues that they were equally characteristic of Arawaks from the Antilles to eastern Peru and the upper Xing, and elsewhere (Heckenberger 1996:219) suggests a connection with defensive works.</p>

It is still spoken fairly extensively along the Rio Negro and elsewhere in pockets in the Amazon region (Campbell 1997:23). Similarly, even Quechua originally spread through the central Andean area as a trading language (Schwartz and Salomon 1999:457; Torero 2002:91105; Stark 1985:181).</p>

               <p>The ceramic style known as Guarita provides an interesting example in that it suggests a continuity in material culture that in some areas survived a major linguistic shift. Although the (Barrancoid) roots of this style appear to have been among Arawakspeakers of the northwestern Amazon (Lathrap 1970:15657; Neves 2001:275), in southern and eastern Amazonia it seems itself to be ancestral to the socalled Amazonian Polychrome Tradition, subsequently associated with Tupspeakers (Brochado 1984:31321). Rather than debating whether all Guarita pottery was made by Arawak or Tupspeakers, we might therefore conclude that, at some point in space and time, a population manufacturing Guaritarelated ceramics appears to have shifted from an Arawak to a Tup language.</p>

         <p>To dissociate the Arawakan ethos and its various stylistic markers from the notion of a biologically delineated population is not to stop asking questions about material processes in Amazonian prehistory. Whatever genes they may have carried, the Arawakspeaking potters of the floodplains in the first millennium BC were engaged in a process of social transformation that also had major ecological repercussions. The tropical landscape still carries imprints of these transformations. As in other areas of the New World (see Cronon 1983:4951), the pristine nature or wilderness discovered by the Europeans has to a large extent proven to be a cultural landscape (see Hornborg 2001). The black (<italic>terra preta de ndio</italic>) or dark brown (<italic>terra mulata</italic>) anthropogenic42 soils that occur along most larger rivers are less acidic and contain more humus, nitrogen, and phosphorus than surrounding soils and are appreciated by both indigenous and nonindigenous farmers for their high fertility. <italic>Terra preta</italic> occurs in patches normally varying between 1 and 100 hectares in extent, with an average around 21 hectares. Some sites, however, are considerably larger, measuring 500 hectares at Santarm, 350 hectares at Juriti, west of Santarm, and 200 hectares plus 1,000 hectares of <italic>terra mulata</italic> at Belterra, by the Tapajs (Denevan 2001:105). Sites are typically elongated and run parallel to riverbanks, for instance, at Altamira, on the Xing (1.8 km  500 m, 90 hectares), and at Manacapur, near Manaus (4 km  200 m, 80 hectares). A recent survey maps almost 400 sites in Brazil alone (Kern et al. 2003) [See CA+ fig. U. The deposits may be up to 2 m in depth. Most researchers agree that <italic>terra preta</italic> was formed in connection with dense, sedentary, and extended human habitation, indicating more permanent and often larger communities than those that have been documented ethnographically in Amazonia.43 It has been proposed that the black soils are the result of human habitation, while the dark brown soils are former agricultural land (Herrera et al. 1992:102, referring to Andrade; Petersen, Neves, and Heckenberger 2001:100). <italic>Terras pretas</italic> are usually associated with artifacts such as pottery, whereas <italic>terras mulatas</italic> are not (Kern et al. 2003:73). The most fertile (black) anthrosols appear to be the result of continuous deposition of household garbage, ashes, feces, urine, bones, shells, and other organic material.<fig-group content-type="figgrp" id="fg24" position="float" seq="24">

            <italic>Terra preta</italic> begins to form at roughly the same time along the larger rivers in Amazonia a few centuries BC. At Hupaiya, near Yarinacocha, by the Ucayali River in Peru, the oldest deposits of <italic>terra preta</italic> have been dated to 200 BC.44 At the large site of Autuba on the lower Ro Negro, <italic>terra preta</italic> may have begun to form around 360 BC. (Petersen, Neves, and Heckenberger 2001:97, 100). In view of the correlations between ceramics and linguistics mentioned above, the abundant finds of Barrancoid ceramics at both Hupaiya and Autuba, as at other sites with <italic>terra preta</italic> along the Amazon (see Myers 2004:91), could be mustered in support of the hypothesis of an Arawakspeaking population on the intensively cultivated floodplains from at least 500 BC up to its identification as such by Europeans. These anthrosols indicate a population density that could not have been sustained with the current (shifting) agricultural practices of indigenous people in the area (Oliver 2001:73; cf. Roosevelt 1993). The evidence suggests that the floodplains of Amazonia in the first millennium BC experienced an unprecedented concentration of human population in conjunction with significant economic intensification and that these material processes were part and parcel of complex new social formations associated with what we have referred to as an Arawakan culture and identity.</p>
         <p>Another lasting imprint of complex social systems and economic intensification in Amazonia is the earthworks that have been identified in association with preColumbian settlements and cultivation systems. The most conspicuous of these are the extensive drainage systems that have been discovered in the seasonally inundated wet savannas of Bolivia, Colombia, and Venezuela and in other waterlogged areas (floodplains, deltas, coastal zones, lake shores, marshes) in the Guyanas, highland Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and highland Bolivia (Denevan 2001:21590; Parsons 1985). In these widely separated areas, a similar method of drainage was employed, the basic idea of which was to construct artificially raised fields to protect the crops from periodic inundations. [See CA+ fig. V Such raised or ridged fields have been given various names in different parts of South America, but a commonly used name is <italic>camellones</italic>, which was already in use in the sixteenth century by Spaniards in the Orinoco llanos and in highland basins of Colombia and Ecuador. It was also being used at least by 1674 for the famous <italic>chinampas</italic> of the Aztecs in Mexico, which appear to belong to the same agricultural tradition. The term <italic>camellones</italic>, which refers to camel humps, was obviously invented by the Spaniards after 1492 but is used to this day in the Beni area in Bolivia (Denevan 2001:217, 220, 23738, 252). Raised fields had several functions in addition to drainage, including soil aeration, reduction of root rot, increased nitrification, pest reduction, reduction of acidity, moisture retention (in the ditches), enhancement of fertility by application of muck from ditches, facilitation of weeding, facilitation of harvest, and increase in soil and water temperatures (p. 220).45<fig-group content-type="figgrp" id="fg25" position="float" seq="25">

         <p>It was not until the 1960s, following William Denevans discovery and exploration of extensive areas of prehistoric <italic>camellones</italic> in the Llanos de Mojos in Beni, Bolivia, that researchers began to grasp the significance of these methods of cultivation in South America. Earlier scholars who had mentioned cultivation on mounds or platforms in various parts of South America include Mtraux in 1942 (having probably received the information from Nordenskild), Schmidt in 1951 (Schmidt 1974 [1951]), and Sauer in 1952 (Denevan 2001:218). Schmidt had perceived a connection between mound cultivation in the Llanos de Mojos, the Titicaca Basin, the Antilles, Maraj Island, and other areas of South America, and Sauer also recognized in these mounds a pattern characteristic of the New World Tropics. The only historical information on the ridged fields in Beni that Denevan was able to locate, however, was a note by two Jesuits from 1754, and the only modern researcher who had previously observed them personally was Nordenskild in 1916 (p. 217). The reason these fields emerged from obscurity in the 1960s is that the patterns they create are clearly visible from the air but difficult to discover on the ground.</p>
         <p>Similar systems of cultivation have subsequently been reported from the llanos of Venezuela and Colombia, coastal areas in the Guyanas, river valleys and waterlogged basins in the highlands of Colombia and Ecuador, the Guayas Basin in coastal Ecuador, the Casma Valley on the north coast of Peru, and the Titicaca Basin on the border between Peru and Bolivia. Their occurrence in the highlands as well as the lowlands undoubtedly reflects an ancient exchange of ideas between the two areas. Their shapes and proportions vary, but there are individual fields in the Orinoco area that are over 1 km long, some in Beni that are 25 m wide, and some by the San Jorge River in Colombia that are 2 m high. Raised fields can occur over very extensive areas, particularly in the Titicaca Basin (120,000 hectares), the lower Sin River and the Momps area between the Cauca and San Jorge Rivers in Colombia (90,000 hectares),46 the Guayas Basin (50,000 hectares), and the Llanos de Mojos in Beni (at least 6,000 hectares). In addition to <italic>camellones</italic>, the Beni area features a great quantity of artificial mounds, causeways, and canals. Most of these earthworks in the Llanos de Mojos are located between the Beni and Mamor Rivers, tributaries of the Madeira. Ridged fields have also been reported from forested areas southwest of these llanos (Denevan 2001:247).</p>
         <p>By multiplying the known acreages of raised fields with experimentally established productivity figures, it is possible to estimate how many people they could have sustained. Experimental cultivation of raised fields in the Titicaca Basin has yielded up to 16 tons of potatoes per hectare. Such harvests would theoretically have been able to sustain almost 40 people per hectare cultivated land (Erickson 2000:336; Denevan 2001:22022, 272). Experimental fields in Mojos have yielded 25 tons of manioc and 2 tons of maize per hectare (Denevan 2001:222, 252). Irrespective of the level of optimism with regard to nutrient yields, however, these estimates should always be tempered by the recognition that a significant portion of the harvests would have been used for feasting and brewing manioc beer rather than pure subsistence. In fact, judging from historical and ethnographical documentation of indigenous consumption patterns throughout much of South America (e.g., Goldman 1966:86, 203; Gastineau, Darby, and Turner 1979), it appears likely that such ceremonial consumption was a major incentive for agricultural intensification in the first place. The domestication and consumption of manioc and maize in South America have undoubtedly from the very start been involved in the maintenance of social reciprocities ranging from local kinship obligations and trade partnerships to chiefly redistribution. The taste for manioc or maize beer should therefore not be underestimated in our understandings of prehistoric agricultural intensification in Amazonia.47</p>
         <p>Again, various kinds of evidence suggest an Arawakan ethnolinguistic identity as the common denominator of these widely dispersed but apparently related cultivation systems. When the Europeans arrived, the llanos of Bolivia, Venezuela, and Colombia as well as the Antilles and coastal Guyanas had for a long time been inhabited by Arawakspeakers. Historical sources mention mound cultivation using digging sticks among the sixteenthcentury Taino of Hispaniola and the eighteenthcentury Palikur on the northeast coast of Brazil (Denevan 2001:227; RenardCasevitz 2002:14041). The ridged fields in the Llanos de Mojos were probably constructed by the Arawakspeaking Mojo using similar methods. Excavations of <italic>camellones</italic> in Venezuela have yielded ceramics that Zucchi attributes to Arawakspeakers expanding north along the Orinoco after AD 500 (Denevan 2001:226; Denevan and Zucchi 1978). The Andean chiefdoms in highland basins in Colombia, Ecuador, and the Titicaca area all maintained close interaction with various ethnic groups in the adjoining lowlands, prominent among which were Arawakspeakers. Lathrap (1970:16263, 16970) has interpreted the prehistoric societies of the Guayas Basin in western Ecuador as an extension, by way of an unusually accessible segment of the Andean highlands, of Amazonian cultural traditions. In his view, the <italic>camellones</italic> of the Guayas Basin are remains of the Milagro culture of AD 500, whose pottery (funerary urns, appliqu decoration, etc.) is reminiscent of Santarm, Kondur, and other ceramic styles from the lower Amazon.48 Lathrap (p. 169) also associates the raised fields in the San Jorge Basin in Colombia with funerary urns with Amazonian affinities. Finally, he adopts Kingsley Nobles hypothesis that an early population of the Titicaca Basin, today represented by the Uru and the Chipaya, was an Arawakspeaking group with roots in the lowlands (pp. 72, 74). This view appears to have been endorsed by several influential linguists, including Greenberg, Surez, and Migliazza (see Campbell 1997:189; Ruhlen 1987:373). Clark Erickson has suggested that the earliest raised fields in the Titicaca Basin were built by the ancestors of the Uru around the beginning of the Chiripa period 800200 BC (see Denevan 2001:273), and David Browman (1980:117) has also identified the Chiripa culture with the ancestors of the Uru and the Chipaya.49</p>
         <p>It would therefore be possible to argue that, from the beginning of the first millennium BC, more or less all occurrences of raised fields in preColumbian South America may have been associated with an Arawakan sphere of influence. The apparently simultaneous appearance of ridged fields in areas as far apart as northern Colombia and the Titicaca Basin around 800 BC does not support the notion of migration as a significant factor in the distribution of this system of cultivation. The earliest dates are from the Guayas lowlands of Ecuador, where Valdiviatype pottery associated with raised fields suggests a timedepth going back to around 2000 BC (Parsons 1985:155). Other dates from various parts of lowland South America include the Beni area around AD 1, the Guyanas AD 200, and the Orinoco AD 500 (Denevan 2001). Like the sequence of pottery dates, this chronology should be interpreted as reflecting not a process of migration but the diffusion of an agricultural technique along a continentwide network of wetland agriculturalists integrated by intense social exchange and a common ethnolinguistic identity.50 We might even suggest that the finds of riverside <italic>terra preta</italic> and marshland <italic>camellones</italic> are complementary manifestations of this same social network, reflecting the conditions of both cultivation and preservation along the rivers and in the llanos, respectively. Ridged fields suggest the adaptation of intensive agriculturalists to wetland environments of a more predictable nature than the major Amazonian floodplains, where the annual floods are much more violent. At the same time, as Lathrap (1970:2930, 39, 16061) has proposed, the idea of artificially raised fields may well have been inspired by the natural series of sedimentary ridges created by such floods along the rivers, as it was precisely these natural ridges that were intensively farmed by the populations on the floodplains.51</p>

Considering recent research on Amazonian dark earths and following Denevans (1992) observation on the excessive labor requirements of shifting cultivation using stone axes, many now agree that shifting cultivation became prevalent in Amazonia only after the European introduction of metal axes, implying that preColumbian horticulture in Amazonia was generally of a more permanent character (Myers et al. 2003; Mora 2003; Neves et al. 2004:44; Myers 2004:74; Denevan 2004).</p>

               <p>It has long been common for archaeologists to refer, as does Ester Boserup, to population growth as the explanation of agricultural intensification and increasing social complexity (see Lathrap 1970). Rather than view population growth as an independent variable, however, we should ask what sociopolitical factors lie behind the emergence of larger and more sedentary concentrations of population (see Petersen, Neves, and Heckenberger 2001:101; Gassn 2002:295). In Amazonia it is evident that community size depends on the ability of political and ritual leaders to integrate greater concentrations of people, which in turn depends on ethnicity, kinship, and a hierarchical cosmology. These ideological factors of integration must nevertheless be continuously supported at a symbolic and a material level through ceremonial feasting, generally focused on the consumption of manioc or maize beer (see Goldman 1966:86, 203; RenardCasevitz 2002:128; Gassn 2003) and the redistribution of rare prestige goods (see Heckenberger 2002:11718; Gassn 2002:292). The latter two activities are archaeologically reflected in agricultural intensification and longdistance trade, respectively. It is therefore only to be expected that sites with evidence of intensive agriculture tend to be strategically located along riverine trade routes (see Herrera et al. 1992, Mora 2003, Kern et al. 2003). The ceremonial consumption of beer is also abundantly reflected in finds of ceramic brewing and drinking vessels (Lathrap 1970:5456, 8586, 88, 100101, 183). Once major investments in agricultural intensification and sedentism have occurred, of course, a factor that could provide powerful incentives for further demographic concentration is warfare (Heckenberger 1996:203).</p>

               <p>Lathraps suggestion that these similarities are the result of a migration of Caribspeakers from the lower Amazon to Ecuador is less persuasive than his general observations on cultural connections between Amazonia and early coastal Ecuador (see also Lathrap, Collier, and Chandra 1975).

               <p>Some linguists (see Ruhlen 1987:373) have posited affinities between UruChipaya and Kallawaya, an almost extinct language spoken by a group of traveling herbalists and medicinemen who have mediated between the Aymara and Quechua in the highlands, on one hand, and Arawakan groups in the lowlands, on the other at least since the time of the Tiwanaku culture 200 BCAD 1000 (see Wassn 1972, Bastien 1987). Campbell (1997:23) lists Kallawaya as a trade language. Around 70% of the Kallawaya lexicon is based on the extinct language Puquina (or Pukina) (Stark 1972), which enjoyed high prestige among the Inca and has been proposed as the language of Tiwanaku (see Parsons and Hastings 1988:227). Puquina has been classified by linguists such as Payne, Derbyshire, and Torero as Arawakan (Browman 1994; Campbell 1997:23, 17879, 190; Torero 2002). Campbell (1997:6, 189, 210) notes that Chipaya has sometimes incorrectly been called Puquina and rejects any affinity between them but does not explicitly object to the classification of either Chipaya or actual Puquina as Arawakan. Torero (2002:48892) suggests that Puquina was the language of Pukar, at the northern end of the Titicaca Basin, and Uru that of Chiripa, at the southern end, and that both share an Arawakan derivation (cf. Browman 1994). If the Kallawaya herbalists, who have been peddling coca and other tropical plants in the Andes since very early times, had a historical connection to ancient Arawakan trade networks, it would fit very well into the general argument of this paper. Browman (1978) proposes that cultural development in the Titicaca Basin should be understood partly in relation to the trade in narcotic and medicinal herbs from the lowlands, and Burger (1992) offers a similar interpretation for Chavn de Huntar. According to Isbell (1988:18081), such trade along the eastern slopes of the Andes may also help explain the iconographic affinities between the Titicaca Basin (Chiripa, Pukar, Tiwanaku), the Mantaro Basin (Wari), and the upper Maraon area (Chavn de Huntar; but cf. Burger 1992:220). Moreover, the site layouts of Chiripa and Pukar have been interpreted as transitional between the ring villages of the lowlands and the quadrangular layouts characteristic of subsequent Andean sites (Lathrap, Marcos, and Zeidler 1977:1011; Hornborg 1990:76; cf. also Lathrap, Collier, and Chandra 1975:4345).</p>

               <p>The <italic>chinampas</italic>, the earliest of which have been dated to around 1100 BC (Parsons 1985:157), should probably be regarded as deriving from the same continentwide communication network. Circumstances which strengthen such a connection include the early occurrence of raised fields on the Caribbean coast of Colombia, the presence of moundcultivating Arawaks on Hispaniola, and indirectly even the presence of Arawakan languages on Cuba. Considering that the Maya had close Arawakan neighbors, it is interesting that some linguists have suggested affinities between Maya and Arawak (Schuller, Noble, Migliazza; see Meggers 1987:171) or even Maya and Chipaya (Olson, Stark, Hamp, Voegelin and Voegelin, Surez; see Campbell 1997:189, 324). Although Campbell dismisses all such proposals about genetic relationships, this should not preclude the identification of significant areal affinities. To pursue the discussion of early cultural connections between South America and Mesoamerica is, of course, far beyond the scope of this paper, but the many intriguing stylistic and iconographic affinities traced by Lathrap and others (1966, 1971, 1974; Lathrap, Collier, and Chandra 1975) would be difficult to explain without the assumption of longdistance exchange networks spanning vast distances in prehistoric Nuclear America. The distribution maps for Arawakan languages may be the most tangible evidence we have of such cultural connections.</p>

               <p>A similar landscape of naturally ridged fields appears to have stimulated intense cultivation on Maraj Island and other coastal areas in eastern Brazil (Brochado 1984:33941). Brochado (p. 395) suggests that the spread of Tupinamb initially coincided with an ecological niche characterized by ridgeswale topography resembling that of northwestern Maraj. As mentioned above, however, Maraj was inhabited by Arawakspeakers at the time of European contact. Parsons (1985:161) and Myers (1992:87, 91) suggest a widespread connection between raisedfield agriculture and monumental earthmoving architecture such as the mounds of Mojos and Maraj.</p>

         <title>Conclusions</title>
         <p>The complex distribution maps tracing the linguistics, ethnography, and archaeology of Amazonia represent a daunting jigsaw puzzle. Anthropologists and archaeologists have long been struggling with the challenge of finding intelligible patterns behind the patchy indications of cultural diversity. Some have sought clues in the natural environment, others in historical processes or an autonomous, semiotic logic of culture. In this paper, the analytical platform that I have chosen as a point of departure is that of regional and interregional <italic>exchange systems</italic>. Exchange systems are ecologically, historically, and culturally <italic>conditioned</italic>, but they simultaneously generate tangible ecological, historical, and cultural <italic>consequences</italic>. Thus they constitute a theoretical juncture where different scientific perspectives and levels of analysis can be integrated in recursive, nondeterministic ways. The geographical distribution of natural resources, territorial boundaries, and cultural patterns of consumption are all important for the development of exchange systems, just as, again, the trajectories of exchange systems are important for environmental change, politics, and cultural identities. It is often precisely these three aspects of prehistoric social changepatterns of resource use, power structures, and delineation of cultural boundariesthat we most urgently want to reconstruct, particularly in our attempts to understand the driving forces behind transitions to sedentism and agricultural intensification on different continents.</p>
         <p>In South America, expansive exchange networks have previously been postulated as underlying the diffusion of, for instance, the Chavn art style (cf. Lathrap 1971, Burger 1992) and the Quechua language (Schwartz and Salomon 1999:457; Torero 2002:91105; Stark 1985:181), neither of which is believed primarily to have involved demic migration. I have suggested that a similar interpretation can be applied to the spread of Arawakan languages and certain aspects of material culture and agricultural practices that tend to appear in conjunction with them. This interpretation is based primarily on the following facts: (1) Many and sometimes widespread language shifts (e.g., to Nheengat) have occurred in Amazonia without involving migration. (2) The areas outside their homeland in the northwestern Amazon that first adopted Arawakan languages were, with the probable exception of the upper Xing, already fairly densely populated by that time. (3) Arawakspeakers have long been active traders, often along the very rivers that have been postulated as their primary migration routes. (4) Arawakspeaking groups also practiced extensive intermarriage with other ethnolinguistic groups. (5) Arawakan languages spoken in different areas often show more structural similarities to their nonArawak neighbors than to each other (Aikhenvald and Dixon 1998). (6) Attempts to find correlations between Amazonian languages and genes have been conspicuously unsuccessful (CavalliSforza, Menozzi, and Piazza 1994:341).</p>
         <p>The archaeological evidence suggests that floodplains and wet savannas in various parts of lowland South America in the first millennium BC experienced the emergence of a new kind of expansive and densely settled society characterized by extensive ethnic alliances and power hierarchies based on longdistance trade and intensive exploitation of both terrestrial and aquatic resources. The intensification of resource use should be understood partly in direct relation to trade, as some of it seems to have been production for export, and partly in relation to a rising need for surplus production generated by the consumption demands of the elite, the craft specialists, and the demographically more concentrated settlements. These demands should in turn only partly be understood in terms of subsistence, as a significant proportion of the product would have been allocated to ceremonial consumption of, for example, manioc or maize beer.</p>
         <p>This sociocultural pattern may originally have crystallized among Arawakspeaking populations inhabiting the border zone between the Amazon and Orinoco Basins, an area that had long seen a lively trade and high density of interaction between different ethnic groups. The familiarity with rivers and river traffic initially favored the rapid expansion of Arawakspeakers downstream along the Orinoco and the Ro Negro, an expansion based as much on alliancemaking and the ethnolinguistic assimilation of other groups as on actual population movements. With time, the expansive inertia of the Arawakan ethos as described above was more or less dissociated from the distribution of biologically definable populations. Successively more distant groups along the waterways continued to gravitate toward the prestigious new way of life and its rewards and obligations, became a part of the Arawakan network, adopted its language, ceremonies, and patterns of consumption, and finally served as its missionaries in a continuous outward movement that spanned a millennium and a half and covered most of the continent of South America. This continentwide network absorbed and disseminated new cultural traits from the groups thus Arawakized while maintaining a recognizable core of Arawakan features including language, pottery styles, and ceremonial life. In several cases it is difficult to ascertain whether traits were adopted from neighboring groups or part of the original cultural package. Such cases include the sacred trumpets, mythical cartographies, petroglyphs, and hierarchical descent ideology shared with the Tukano, the circular villages shared with the G, and the raised fields shared with the Andeans. This fluidity or readiness to absorb new elements is a general hallmark of ethnogenetic processes, but a more remarkable aspect of Arawakan ethnicity is the extent to which a recognizably coherent constellation of core features has been able to reproduce itself over such vast areas and over such long periods of time (Hill and SantosGranero 2002). A conclusion that suggests itself is that this particular constellation of traits was uniquely well suited to the task of integrating the regional exchange system of prehistoric Amazonia.</p>
         <p>The process described above has ecological as well as political and cultural aspects. Earlier attempts to account for prehistoric intensification in Amazonia and elsewhere have generally chosen to emphasize one of these aspects at the expense of others. It would be misleading, however, to imagine that the process was in any significant way determined either by ecological conditions, political aspirations, or cultural idiosyncrasies. All these aspects should rather be viewed as components of a more general socioecological logic. The process of Neolithization that we can discern in Amazonia during the first millennium BC is fundamentally a <italic>regional systemic phenomenon</italic> in the sense that it is a crystallization of a given set of geographical, historical, and cultural conditions. This <italic>systemic</italic> character is reflected, for instance, in the observation that something new occurred simultaneously in the last few centuries BC over vast areas of Amazonia, a manifestation of which was larger and more sedentary settlements with the capacity to generate <italic>terra preta</italic> (Petersen, Neves, and Heckenberger 2001:101; Neves et al. 2003:29). Abrupt changes can also be detected in several sites in central Amazonia around AD 700 (Neves et al. 2004). Local cultural discontinuities associated with the integration and transformation of continentwide exchange networks should offer possibilities of juxtaposition and correlation (fig. 3). The set of relevant systemic conditions for such synchronized developments would include the geographical distribution of natural resources such as turtles, shells, and green stone and cultural constellations of symbolically and sociologically constituted demand for such products, from the Andean demand for feather mantles and hallucinogenic plants to the central Amazonian demand for frogshaped amulets (see Boomert 1987:3436). Systemic conditions also include the specific geographies of navigable rivers and cultivable floodplains and the distances from and the historically given political conditions in other parts of the continent such as the Andes and the Caribbean. Finally, we must count among these crucial conditions the culturally specific motives of traders and chiefs along the rivers, which necessarily involve prehistoric Arawakan political economy, kinship systems, and marriage rules. One example of these latter factors is the use of green stone amulets and shell beads as brideprice among various groups in the Amazon and Orinoco Basins (Boomert 1987:37; Gassn 2000:589).</p>
         <p>Ultimately, the challenge is to understand the ethnic and cultural specificity of Arawakan societies as a <italic>product</italic> of these ecologicalhistoricalcultural constellations and fields of gravitation. Although the appearance of having conveyed this specificity over Amazonia by means of prehistoric migrations continues to bias much of our thinking on the Arawak phenomenon, an ethnogenetic perspective has much more to offer. It will allow us to see that the Arawakan capacity to occupy the main arteries of Amazonia should be interpreted not as an essential cultural superiority intrinsic to a specific population but as an expression of the new kinds of social relations that were selected for in the context of the regional systemic processes of the first millennium BC. An early template for such new social structures may indeed have crystallized in the northwestern Amazon during the consolidation of a core area of the emergent system, but the subsequent diffusion of such structures should be understood as a product of the integrative logic of this expanding system. The Arawakan niche in this system emerged because the human qualities it fosteredthose of waterborne traders, cosmopolitan alliancebuilders, and sedentary agriculturalistswere a requirement for regional integration. After this constellation of features had been consolidated and embodied in the cultural repertoire of early Arawakspeaking populations in the northwestern Amazon, it proved highly contagious and hugely successful from the perspective of cultural selection. This is what the distribution maps for Arawakan languages and SaladoidBarrancoid pottery can tell us. Meanwhile, other ethnolinguistic categories (e.g., Tup, Carib, G, Pano) that emerged in opposition to this cultural repertoire were equally shaped by these processes and are in their own ways also products of an overarching regional system.</p>
         <p>The issue raised by the Arawak phenomenon is ultimately how to understand prehistoric ethnogenetic processes in more multiplex terms than traditional notions of trait diffusion and demic migration. Arawak is a set of related <italic>languages</italic> that appears to have diffused along Amazonian waterways in prehistory, but it would certainly be misleading to imagine them as a set of peoples in the implicit biologicalgenetic sense of the word. Throughout Amazonia, anthropologists have discovered how easily ethnic groups have adopted basic cultural patterns from their neighbors. There is in fact as much mention of the Tukanoization or Panoization of Arawaks as of the Arawakization of Tukano and Pano (Hill and SantosGranero 2002). The frequency of marriages across ethnolinguistic boundaries in most areas illustrates how illusory our (and their) notion of a people may be. A good guess is that Arawakspeakers in Colombia have more in common genetically with their Tukanoan neighbors than with Arawaks in Peru or Bolivia. Complete language shifts have also occurred in many areas (cf. Aikhenvald 1999<italic>b</italic>, 2002; Jensen 1999:129; Neves 2001:277). Against this background, it seems important to reconsider our assumptions of essentialized Arawakan peoples migrating across South America. I have suggested that we should rather view Arawak as the cultural <italic>medium</italic> that integrated much of prehistoric Amazonia as a regional, socioecological system. The expanding network of riverine Arawakspeaking societies should be seen not as the infiltration of externally derived invaders but as a phenomenon internally generated by the regional system itself: a culture of trade and communication that absorbed and disseminated traits from different parts of the continent while maintaining its focus on a core set of integrating features, paramount of which was the language itself. It is important that we not reify such fluid cultural constructs. The challenge lies in conceptualizing cultures or even popular notions of peoples as entities largely disconnected from populations in a biologicalgenetic sense. It obviously becomes more difficult to speak of cultures when we acknowledge how ethereal, constructed, and continuously hybridized they must be, but the recent renegotiations of culture theory in anthropology cannot avoid affecting our interpretations of prehistory. This acknowledgment of the ethereality of cultural identity is finally only the recognition that we as researchers are no less susceptible to the illusions of ethnic essentialism than the authors of such illusions.</p>
