If you associate the title L'amour au jardin with Emma Bovary, sneaking into the garden at night from the bed of her snoring husband, to throw herself into the fiery embrace of Rodolphe, you are mistaken. Jean-Pierre Otte deals with the sexual life of garden flowers and in- sects only. He displays the intricate tactics they are forced to resort to in order to save their species. Human beings choose their lovers; the vegetable and animal worlds are at the mercy of fickle chance.

Is Otte's stance anthropomorphic? Of course it is. The reader follows the author in a voyeuristic display of a frenzied choreography of sexual activities in the garden. Otte bases his descrip- tions on long observations, to which he adds his poetic fancy, and presents his findings in a witty style, studded with striking images. He wrote this book for the greater glory of Nature and LIFE. Take, for instance, the stunning trick of the bee orchid. With a chemistry as complex as that that went into the concoction of Chanel No. 5, made up of eighty ingredi- ents, the flower duplicates the scent emitted by the female bee at copulation time. The gullible male seeks out the flower and searches excitedly for a nonexistent opening. Thereupon arrives a second male, tempted by the scent and pounces on the first one. The self-respecting male re- fuses to be taken for a female. While they are furiously wrestling and wiggling, the orchid is pollinated. The two frustrated males depart and carry the pollen to treacher- ous sister flowers. The thirteen flowers described all invent their individ- ual initiatives. The grape hyacinth produces two sets of flowers. The fragrant blue ones have neither a stigma nor nectar to offer to the visitors. They are the "teasers." The frustrated insect searches further, goes lower, and is re- warded by the brownish, insignificant flowers which he pollinates, while getting intoxicated by their ample supply of nectar. The lilliputian flowers of the fig attract only the small- est species of flies and offer them a "mariage de raison" from which both parties profit. They enact the medieval poetic theme: Tamour et la mort." The fig has two sets of flowers, the first ones to be fertilized, the second ones of- fering a safe nest for the tiny fly eggs. After having laid the eggs, most flies die. When the young males emerge from their larvae, they throw themselves on the females and die from the effort. Love leads to death but produces life. Further sections of the book deal with the love life of in- sects and describe, among others, the cannibalistic love of the golden or garden beetle, the poisonous kiss of the fe- male spider, the ravenous appetite of the praying mantis. Without any preamble, the male beetle mounts the female. As soon as she is fertilized, he trots away. The furious fe- male, as if considering his uncourtly act as a rape, runs after him, knocks him down, turns him on his back, rips his belly open, and devours its contents with gusto. The female praying mantis goes even further in this love that ends in the stomach. She beheads the enraptured male, who car- ries on headless with the sexual act, while the female, who is not a vegetarian, devours her steadfast partner bite by bite. The female spider, four times larger than the male, ensnares him in her artful net. In the posture that he is forced to take to mount her, his belly is just at the level of her hooks. She swiftly implants her hooks in his belly; he collapses and offers his body to feast on. Sometimes the male tries to escape, but the female holds him fast in her net and gives him the mortal blow, the poisonous kiss. Otte claims that, as a modern writer, he wants to estab- lish an intimacy that is lost today. He does not intend to enrich the scientific knowledge of his readers, thus alien- ating them even further. He wants rather to involve them, through sexuality and all the senses, with the intimate tur- bulence of LIFE. Maria Green University of Saskatchewan</page></plain_text>
