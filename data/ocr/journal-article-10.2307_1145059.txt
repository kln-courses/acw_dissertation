<plain_text><page sequence="1">Disney's America Sings By James H. Bierman Walking from the Disneyland plaza into Tomorrowland, it is difficult to comprehend at first that the Carousel Theatre, partly visible behind the PeopleMover and the Mission to Mars, is a completely circular building. Once you arrive at the point where a view of the theatre is not blocked by any other structure, your proximity to the wall of the theatre reduces its curve and makes it appear straighter, just as proximity to the earth's surface causes it to seem flat. As a result it is mildly perplexing to pass the turnstiles, after de- positing an 85-cent ticket, and follow the metal guide rails that lead to the outer wall of the theatre. However, it is at most a four-minute wait until the entire theatre turns itself and brings a door in front of the spot where you are standing. This door opens automati- cally, and you are permitted to enter a comfortable 240-seat auditorium just in time for the beginning of America Sings, regardless of what time it is. Statistics illustrate that this is one of the most popular theatrical events existing in the world today, and yet there is hardly ever a wait of more than four minutes. What dissolves this paradox is the fact that both the Carousel Theatre and the stage show presented there are, like nearly all the permanent attractions at Disneyland, fully automated. The smiling, uniformed usherettes at the door serve as little more than decoration for a show that requires no people for its running, not even actors. It is a show performed entirely by robots. America Sings takes the form of a comical musical review that sets out to trace 200 years of our nation's musical heritage. Forty separate songs are combined in a recorded score orchestrated and conducted by Buddy Baker and presented in a sequence of six acts (1. Prolog, 2. Early South, 3. Old West, 4. Gay Nineties, 5. Modern Times, and 6. Finale) designed to carry the spectator chronologically through four distinctive eras of American music. Above, audio-animatronic figures perform "Hound Dog."

BIERMAN A primary factor in shaping the dramatic form of America Sings is the theatre that it was intended to occupy. The Carousel Theatre is an enormous circular building encom- passing 83,000 square feet. The entire 200-foot-wide building with the exception of a central area, is powered to rotate around its focal point. The unmoving core is sectioned off into six stages with a common backstage space at the center for machinery. Around the cen- tral area is a doughnut-shaped auditorium that is divided into six theatres of 240 seats. When, once every four minutes, scene changes occur, the entire outer part of the building rotates sixty degrees, transporting each section of audience sequentially from one stage to the next. Efficiently, prolog and epilog scenes also leave time for loading and unloading audiences. As a result, the robots performing a given act do not have to wait until the en- tire play has run its cycle before they can go on again. Every four minutes, they are faced with a new audience of 240 people for a total of 3,600 people an hour. Throughout Disneyland, similar systems are devised to move large masses of people quickly, comfortably, and efficiently without waiting in long lines. Such systems allow the park to entertain from thirty to forty thousand "guests" ("customers" is a forbidden word) a day. America Sings played to audiences in excess of two million "guests" in its first three months, and it is estimated that, with occasional changes, the show could run ten to fifteen years. Its predecessor at the Carousel Theatre, The General Electric Carou- sel of Progress, has been seen by more than 50 million people in its showings at the New York World's Fair and at Disneyland. Now running at Walt Disney World, it is scheduled to play for another 50 million people, perhaps more. Even Shakespeare's Hamlet was probably seen in live performance by only a fraction of that number in its 375-year history. Opening scene of "The Carousel of Progress." 64</page><page sequence="3">DISNEY'S AMERICA SINGS With a total viewing audience equal to half the population of the United States, there can be little doubt regarding the propaganda value of these plays in communicating their particular vision of American cultural history. Considering the persuasiveness of this thea- tre as well as its success in drawing audiences, there is no question that it merits study for its social impact if not for its theatrical value. Of course, the efficiency of the Carousel Theatre is not calculated only in terms of the number of people it can accommodate, since it would obviously be a more efficient use of energy to rotate the smaller central core of the building, creating the kind of scene changes that one normally finds with the use of a revolving set. Martin Sklar of WED Enterprises (Walter Elias Disney) states as a rationale for moving the entire audience rather than the scenery, that the six million dollars' worth of machinery behind the scenes is too complex to move. Considering the demonstrated genius of the Disney "imagineers," one suspects that the decision to move the audience rather than the stage is tempered, if not entirely motivated, by the effects such a theatre produces on its audience. These effects are complex and difficult to isolate. The most obvious one is the sheer impressiveness of a technology that moves the whole audience so silently and smoothly that, had they not seen the entire building move when they were outside waiting to enter, they would have thought that only the scenes were shifting. The smooth motion is further masked by the theme music that accompanies the scene shifts and a slightly stroboscopic play of speckled lights meant to divert the audience's attention. A second effect is that the actual physical experience of motion beautifully comple- ments the play itself. It provides an experiential metaphor for America Sings' invitation to "travel through history" by making the event a "ride" as well as static theatre. The Disney designers employ extreme subtlety in integrating this sort of effect into the show itself. Each of the acts of America Sings starts with a quartet of geese performing stage right and terminates with an owl and eagle stage left who lead the way into the next act. The motion stage right to left picks up the direction of the audience's counterclock- wise movement and propels the show harmoniously forward. This is further complemented by the sequence of songs in each act which builds toward a climactic large group number and then leads into the owl and the eagle's "traveling music." Using a complex multiphonic sound system with speakers over the audience, in specific locations above and onstage, and installed in the robots themselves, the music builds in excitement and energy until that ex- citement is literally translated into movement. The hosts, travel guides, and masters of ceremony for this festival of song are a sprightly American eagle dressed in red, white and blue named Sam (Uncle Sam) and his sidekick, a whimsical owl. Sam speaks and sings with the melodious voice of an old Disney performer, Burl Ives, while the owl employs the more playful voice of Sam Edwards. In the prolog and finale, the eagle and the owl occupy a large colonial-style gazebo that is stationed center stage. Otherwise, they are integrated into the end of each act and appear stage left. Their gazebo, which is also a pedestal and a band platform, has behind it a show curtain that first places it on the common of a New England colonial village and finally shifts it to New York City's Central Park. This shift sums up the transition from the beginning to the end of the show-from the American Revolution to the present-and provides a historical frame to enclose the distance we have "progressed." The forty songs researched, collected, and arranged by Al Bertino, include a wide range of America's most familiar ones: "Yankee Doodle," "I Dream of Jeannie," "Pop Goes the Weasel," "Dixie," "Little Liza Jane," "Camptown Races," "Single Girl," "Down By the Riverside," "Home on the Range," "After the Ball is Over," "Bill Bailey," "Ta-Ra-Ra- Boom De-Ay," "Singing In the Rain," "Beat Me, Daddy, Eight to the Bar," "Hound Dog," "See Ya Later, Alligator," "Shake, Rattle and Roll," and "Twistin, U. S. A." They are 65</page><page sequence="4">JAMES H. BIERMAN performed by a selection of anthropomorphic geese, alligators, possums, fox, chickens, turkeys, mongrels, prairie dogs, vultures, rabbits, horses, wolves, pigs, frogs, and birds. A background in film animation serves Marc Davis, the designer, well in this three-dimen- sional idiom. His choice of stylized animals and his detailed design, including outrageous costuming, creates an impressive sequence of visual metaphors to strengthen the perfor- mance of the songs. One may imagine the musical numbers in The Three Little Pigs, Dumbo, and Fantasia transported to the Broadway stage with all the self-conscious theat- ricality that the Broadway musical idiom implies. The scenery has an intentionally two-dimensional appearance: the use of spotlights and other lighting techniques has an obvious theatrical dimension. Scrims are employed with front and back lighting to reveal new stage spaces, and a variety of moving set pieces that enter and exit in all possible directions complement the motion of railroad carts, cars, trees, plants, and the characters themselves. The show even makes use of the Elizabethan- style stage-within-a-stage upon which bits of action are revealed. The lighting also calls atten- tion to itself, not only in its extensive use of spotlights and extreme lighting, but also in the choice of gels. The vibrant colors of the "Modern Times" setting are lit with a combina- tion of magentas, blues, and greens. Together they form a white light, but separately, they illuminate the show in strong colors. The cumulative effect of Davis' staging techniques is best experienced in the large group number that concludes each act. With the "build" that precedes it, and the massive staging emphasis, one has the impression of witnessing a Broadway show-stopper with all its volume and energy. What we see is not a final chorus number, but a collection of fox and chickens dressed in their Sunday finest belting out a soulful rendition of "Down By the Riverside" with the voices of twenty black spiritual singers. The selection of the voices for the songs illustrates considerable care and research. The piano-playing pig who sings "Beat Me, Daddy, Eight to the Bar" has the voice of Ray McKinley, the singer who originally recorded the song in the 1940's. The prairie dog who sings unfamiliar verses to the familiar "Home on the Range" is Lloyd Perryman, an origi- nal member of The Sons of the Pioneers. Blie grass singer Jean Ritchie's a cappella rendi- tion of "Single Girl" for a mother possum hanging her offspring out to dry is appropriately plaintive, and of course, Burl Ives sets a middle-American standard in the world of folk music. In numerous places the songs are cut or edited to provide continuity for the show. Lyrics are occasionally altered for the same purpose, particularly in the case of the "travel- ing music" and theme song, "Yankee Doodle," which is given new verses throughout to carry the narrative structure of the review: Now came ragtime, blues and jazz. The nation was a-jumpin' The fox trot and the bunny hug Had everyone a-stomping. Then swing and big bands were the rage. The songs, they were most pleasin' Rock and roll soon took its toll, And dancers stopped a-squeezin'. In other cases, songs were edited to avoid anything that might be offensive to the Disney- land audiences. "Who Shot the Hole In My Sombrero?" was originally designed to be sung in a strongly accented voice by a Mexican mongrel dog on a donkey. The actual threat of Chicano demonstrations caused the mongrel to be Americanized, the lyrics to be rewritten. 66</page><page sequence="5">"Single Girl": mother possum "hangs" babies out to dry. and singer Rex Allen's Mexican accent converted to a Texas twang. In a similar fashion, the word harlot, in "Wandering Boy" was changed to siren in the temperance version of the song finally adopted. Such changes point to an obvious level of the play's intention. In an effort to present a harmless view of American history through song, editing and alteration was necessary to avoid the potentially offensive. The same is true of the speech presented by Disney's famous robot of Abraham Lincoln in Great Moments With Mr. Lincoln in The Hall of Presidents-a speech which is carefully edited to avoid any mention of such abrasive issues as dissent, racism, and civil war. The thematic material of America Sings appears to go little deeper than the concluding remarks of the eagle, Sam (again to the tune of "Yankee Doodle"): Yankee Doodle always says, "The past is just the start. Tomorrow will bring songs to you That come straight from the heart." Another thing he had to say, was- "Life is just a song." So-everybody get in tune, And let's all sing along. The performance then terminates with an ironic response. It is not particularly surprising to hear the audience singing along with the robot performers at the end, but it is arrantly strange to hear them applauding. For what ears is their applause intended? Disney's enormous success in providing popular inoffensive entertainment is, in part, a function of his knowledge of his audience, and in part, a function of his canny ability to provide them with the amusement they desire. His conspicuously middle-class American public is treated with respect and admiration in his entertainment enterprise. He never talks down to his public, but celebrates an enormously generous vision of its realities. As a result, works like America Sings are thoroughly infiltrated with charming commentaries on moments that are warm and familiar to American life. Their thematic stress on the American way of life, free enterprise, and individualism blends perfectly</page><page sequence="6">JAMES H. BIERMAN with their idiosyncratic charm, and leaves their audiences feeling better about their own lives. Performing robots, called "audio-animatronic figures" by the Disney people in an effort to avoid the negative connotations of human automation, have an extraordinary performance record at Disneyland, Walt Disney World, and the two seasons of the 1964- 1965 New York World's Fair. There are presently thousands of these performers in the magic kingdoms, and their numbers are increasing rapidly in accord with their enormous popularity. Audio-animatronic drama is the product of WED Enterprises, the planning, design, and engineering branch of Walt Disney Productions in charge of the magic king- doms. Over the last twenty years, the approximately forty employees of WED Enterprises have brought audio-animatronic drama from a primitive state to an impressively sophisti- cated one. Starting with Walt Disney's enormous interest in mechanical toys, the first mechanical figures were constructed in the early 1950's. The protomorphic audio-animat- ronic figure was a mechanical version of Buddy Ebsen doing a dance routine that had been previously recorded on film. This robot performed in front of a small proscenium arch constructed over a disproportionately large console that housed a whole complex of vacu- um tubes, flywheels, cams, levers, and electrical wiring. It was programmed by a long loop of perforated paper resembling a piano roll. The mechanics were so voluminous and so complex, they upstaged the robot itself and-given the cumbersome qualities of pre-com- puter, pre-transistor electronics-Walt Disney was forced to temporarily abandon his vision of a robot theatre. Nonetheless, his intention to create better animated beings was so strong that he certainly did not forget them. By 1962, technological advances had allowed the robot figures to progress through thousands of years of evolution. The cam and lever joints in the figures were comple- mented by the presence of more sophisticated ones utilizing hydraulic and pneumatic valves. The hydraulic movements were fluid and allowed a figure to slowly and carefully rise from its chair. The pneumatic system provided quick movements like the batting of an eyelid or the rapid movement of a dog's paw in scratching fleas. The animals of Nature's Wonderland and the Jungle Cruise in Disneyland combined both systems, but with the 1963 opening of the Enchanted Tiki Room, a theatre-in-the-round musical review per- formed by hanging audio-animatronic birds and flowers, the cam and lever system was abandoned. The following year, WED Enterprises engineered four shows for the New York World's Fair, including the remarkably sophisticated Great Moments With Mr. Lincoln for the Illinois pavilion. With Disney's Abraham Lincoln, audio-animatronic drama entered its golden age. Because of his political reverence for Abraham Lincoln, Disney continued to push the technology of the developing robots toward greater realism. WED Enterprise's John Hench reports that Disney rejected early stylized designs in the hopes of creating figures that seemed to breathe. This is no secret. Disney, himself, said of the quest that led him to develop audio-animatronics: I felt that there must be some way . . some undeveloped means of com- munication . . . perhaps some new art form . . . that could combine the best of traditional media to capture the real countenance, the warm sin- cerity and the contagious dedication of Abraham Lincoln. Such a medium, I realized, would have to offer the three-dimensional authenticity created by a talented sculptor, as well as the color and life left on canvas by the genius-painter's brush. The drama and personal rapport 68</page><page sequence="7">Four of the Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln. of the theatre were indispensable. This technique must have the artistic versatility and consistency of the motion picture . . Walter Elias Disney, Great Moments With Mr. Lincoln (record jacket), Disneyland Record S3981. Although Mr. Lincoln now shares the Orlando, Florida, stage with thirty-six other presi- dents in The Hall of Presidents, he still has the task of holding the audience's attention for a ten-minute speech. In Great Moments With Mr. Lincoln (the earlier version which is still showing at Disneyland), he stands center stage unaccompanied. This focus demands that his acting be varied, impressive and realistic. The Lincoln robot was designed to be natural and move with economy and simplicity. None of his gestures are overstated or ex- treme in any way. A slight movement of the eyes or hands serves for emphasis. A slight twist in the torso introduces a rhetorical appeal. As with the realistic characters in The General Electric Carousel of Progress, Mr. Lincoln's performance was closely modeled on that of real actors who first performed his motions for film. A frame-by-frame analysis of these film sequences and the use of a harness which electrically recorded the move- ments of the joints allowed for their precise reproduction in the robots. Such an approach to acting is entirely synthetic, and a performance is constructed instant-by-instant rather than responding to an actor's internal impulses. Many of the writers and designers of these shows are former animators, and they deal with audio-animatronics as three-dimensional animation, not as acting. What most advanced the technical growth of the robots was the invention of sound readers to be installed in each valve. This allowed their movement to be governed by re- mote control in response to inaudible sound impulses. The technology necessary for the invention of this system was first developed by government research as a means of con- trolling the launching of space rockets, and then converted for use in the magic kingdoms. To activate the sound readers, WED Enterprises developed a computer control system called DACS for Digital Animation Control System or Disney Audio-animatronic Control System. This system allows animators to program the performance of the robots while sitting behind an elaborate console. The manipulation of levers, buttons, and dials sets the figures in motion and automatically records their movements on a program that can be monitored instantly, edited, erased, re-recorded, or simply preserved for guiding the continuous running of the show. Eventually, all the cues for the entire show are recorded on a one-inch tape that acts as the "brain"of the theatre piece and provides not only the inaudible sound impulses that govern the movement of the automata, but also the voices (usually emanating from speakers installed in the chests of the figures), the entire sound system, and cues for the lights as well as all other staging effects. In all, ten inches of this thirty-two channel magnetic tape records the program for less than a quarter of a second</page><page sequence="8">JAMES H. BIERMAN of action, and contains as much as 64,000 pieces of information, including the cues for as many as 438 discrete actions. America Sings was created as a result of a two-year process similar to that of the ani- mated films. It began with the original design and story presentation in the form of story- boards rather than a script. Such an approach treats the performance more like a cartoon than a play by isolating discrete frames of action without articulating transitions. It is a more appropriate mode for a cast that resembles a series of caricatures rather than char- acters, and leads to the extreme economy in the development of action which character- izes much of the existing audio-animatronic drama. Nothing is overbuilt, over-articulated or overdeveloped, and action is portrayed with directness by stylized and extreme gesture. Whereas the literary antecedent for The Carousel of Progress was Thornton Wilder's Our Town, the creators of America Sings looked back to Aesop's Fables for their models. In the more recent shows, such as America Sings and Country Bear Jamboree, the principal creators (Al Bertino, writer, and Davis, designer) have turned away from realism. From a range of existing automata that extends from realistic human figures to stylized human figures, and from realistic animals to stylized animals, they have chosen to work with exaggerated and anthropomorphic animals. Partly as a result of their stylization, and partly due to the limitations of the medium, the robots are given a smaller vocabulary of movements which are more extreme than that of their realistic counterparts and more im- mediately expressive. However, because they have fewer movements, they are less capable of holding an audience's attention for any length of time. While the immediate impact of each robot is impressive, it cannot be sustained, and shows like America Sings are com- pelled to include as many as 114 characters appearing in rapid succession in order to sat- isfy the audience's demand for variety. This cast is enormous when compared with the realistic Carousel of Progress or with Mr. Lincoln's solo performance. Along with America Sings, several other audio-animatronic shows fit into the overall fabric of the American Revolutionary Bicentennial celebration at Disneyland and Walt Disney World. The list of shows specifically celebrating American life includes Great Mo- ments With Mr. Lincoln, The Hall of Presidents, The Carousel of Progress, Country Bear Jamboree, and Mission to Mars. To these must be added the official Disney Bicentennial pageant, America on Parade, the only show on this list performed by human beings (al- though they are made to resemble large dolls): Every day at three o'clock, this theatrical event takes place, bringing together a curious mixture of tradition and innovation. Com- bining the staging idiom of the medieval Corpus Christi play with the Pasadena Rose Bowl Parade, America on Parade sets out to provide "an entertaining and delightful look at America's heritage" for thousands of spectators lined up along the sidewalks from the heart of Fantasyland down Matterhorn Way and Main Street to the Disneyland Town Square. These spectators witness a progression of elaborate floats that serve as moving stages for the performance of larger-than-life-sized dolls of recognizable Disney figures (Mickey Mouse, Pluto, Donald Duck) and others dressed up in costumes characteristic of various stages of American history from the Revolution to the present. While loudspeakers broadcast appropriate music and occasional voice-over narrative, the human performers buried inside the dolls perform in dance and mime. WED Enterprises has invested so much energy and resources in audio-animatronic drama that there can be no question that they will be receiving dividends on their invest- ment for a long time to come. Several of their present productions are scheduled to run for another ten years. Others are already in the planning stages. Since the productions are being updated every few years, there is never a finished show, but one that alters with the times. Davis anticipates that the last act of America Sings will continue to undergo peri- odic changes as modern music continues to change. In a similar fashion, The Carousel of 70</page><page sequence="9">Famous Disney characters perform during "America on Parade. " Progress has been periodically altered to keep up with ecology, women's liberation, and other changing trends in American life-styles. Another way the dramas continue to change is that WED Enterprises continues to experiment with new technologies and new materials that are incorporated into their art. There is, for example, a continued investigation of materials. At present, the figures have a fiberglass skeleton and skull over which is stretched a vinyl skin that is molded to resemble human skin in its features and texture and adapted to take actual stage makeup so that the face features can be read at a distance. The Disney researchers hope to replace the vinyl skins with a latex substance, since latex has a memory (an ability to alter its form and return to its original state) which vinyl lacks. However they must first develop a form of latex that is durable enough to stand continuous movement and, in some cases, exposure to such elements as rain, hot sunlight, and smog. In a similar fashion, the WED Enterprises taxidermy department is charged with devel- oping synthetic furs for robot animals that are realistic, durable, weather resistant, and easily cleaned. The enormous interest in the synthetic at WED Enterprises results in an ironic conservation of the natural. The business of the Disney people is not to kill animals, but to make them. The major developments of robot drama that one can expect in the future are esthetic ones. As audiences begin to recognize and accept the popularity and specific advantages of robot dramas in fairground situations, directors, designers, and writers outside the Disney organization will be drawn to them. Despite the popularity of a mentality that re- sists automation in domains previously reserved for humans such as the arts, the impact of the Disney shows is unquestionable. One writer who has already been attracted to the audio-animatronic medium is Ray Bradbury. A persuasive robot enthusiast in such stories as Downwind from Gettysburg, he has also written an unproduced time-machine show for the Disney automata. Bradbury's experience with the Disney robots has led him to en- visage a theatre of the future in which the spectators will be able to mingle with robot re- productions of great historical figures.</page><page sequence="10">JAMES H. BIERMAN As in the case of Mary Poppins, Disney's art of animation evolved toward the integra- tion of human actors in animated films. The same direction is possible with three-dimen- sional animation, and has already been tentatively explored in Mission to Mars where a live usherette converses with a robot figure in front of the audience. To allow the audience to freely interact with robot performers would demand computer programs for the robots far more complex than those already in use, but given the already highly sophisticated stage of the art, it is not impossible to imagine. With audio-animatronic drama, the future is collapsed into the present, and the amazing facts resemble science fiction. From Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley's Frankenstein to Ray Bradbury's I Sing the Body Electric!, the recipe for the generation of robots in science fiction consistently calls for an enormously compulsive imagination in combination with an extraordinary technology. Both of these ingredients were present in the creation of Disney's audio-animatronics. Disney is often represented as a combination of Leonardo da Vinci and Thomas Edison. There is some exaggeration in the comparison, but behind it, there is no question that he was a master at organizing and controlling systems and at using them for public entertainment. Audio-animatronics is such a system, and now that Disney is dead, it is still being employed and developed quite skillfully by his successors. They have had success in using the automata to create an enormously popular theatre. It would be interesting to see what would come of such a theatre if it were placed in the hands of other creators with other esthetic values.
