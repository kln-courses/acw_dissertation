Manama: Cul ture and National Heritage, Kingdom of Bahrain. $47.00 cloth. ISBN 978-877934-373-3. The Tylos period in Bahrain lasted from 324 b.c. to the 7th century a.d. Rescue excavations of burial mounds pro duced many artifacts of this period and the analysis of the pottery and glass vessels is presented in this volume. Many of the glass vessels are of well-dated and widely distributed types and therefore help cross-date the pottery vessels. Ty pological developments reflect cultural interactions in terms of influence and choice. Arnold, Philip J., Ill, and Christopher A.

Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. $50.00 cloth. ISBN 978-0 88402-350-0. The classic-period cultures of Veracruz are best known for elaborate ball-game rituals and inscriptions with long count dates. This area acted as a nexus between the civi lizations in highland Mexico and the lowland Maya. The chapters in this volume are written from the perspectives of archaeology, art history, and linguistics, and focus on an cient iconography and writing, socio-political landscapes, and the interplay between local developments and external influences at many sites.

London: Equinox Publishing Ltd. $95.00 cloth. ISBN 978-1-84553-013-6. Study of writing systems has traditionally focused upon their invention and decipherment, rather than how they come to be disused or replaced. Despite this fact, the dis appearance of writing is also very significant as a marker of radical change. This volume presents a broad range of pa pers covering both the Old and New Worlds that address this problem. Case studies date from the 2nd millennium B.C. to the present, and "writing" is defined in the broad est sense possible.

Despite a common conception that mobile peoples do not leave recognizable archaeological traces aside from "ephemeral campsites," the papers in this book make it clear that the application of specific and well-defined methods make an "archaeology of mobility" possible. These articles discuss the archaeology of mobility at sites throughout the world and try to redefine pastoralism within a broader con text by using the term mobility.

It presents information about how to maintain acceptable standards in underwater archaeology. It includes a general introduction to the topic and associated tech niques and practices, but also emphasizes that archaeology is not just a set of techniques: it has fundamental principles and theoretical underpinnings.</page><page sequence="2">474 Publications Chuipka, Jason P., and James M.

Archaeology, history, and economics can all contribute to investigating the development of American capitalism in the Chesapeake Bay region. The archaeological evidence comes from revolutionary period bakeries in Annapolis, Maryland, and Alexandria, Virginia. These establishments, and the bakers who ran them, are used to examine the de velopment of local production centers from household based manufacturing, through larger workshops, to mech anized factories.

IS BN 978-0-8130-3263-4. Family, as opposed to corporate, farming as a way of life is on the decline in America. Farmstead archaeology is a key component of historical archaeology, and helps to record an important chapter of American life that is drawing to a close. This book discusses the archaeological exploration of farmsteads as it is relevant to understanding the lives, con sumption patterns, and transcontinental migrations of Americans. It includes case studies and gives an overview of current trends in farmstead archaeology.

The author uses this site to examine the status positions of individual inhabitants. He analyzes individual households and reconstructs the size, life history, symbolic associations, and integrative mecha nisms of the community at King. The site is also situated within the regional political system.

Austin: University of Texas Press. $60.00 cloth. ISBN 978-0-292-71822-7. Stone plaques have been found in graves in southern Por tugal and Spain that date to the NeoHthic and are engraved with geometric, zoomorphic, or anthropomorphic de signs. The author of this volume uses a range of theoretical and methodological approaches to argue that most of these plaques were genealogical records of the deceased that marked regional and local group identities. These recorded identities perpetuated and reinforced inherited social dif ferences during the Late Neolithic in Iberia. Mills, Barbara J., and William H.

The authors in this book present case studies that show how social memories are made, not simply experienced, by means of repeated, patterned, and engaged social practices. The goal of the volume is to explore the ways in which the social memories of past societies can be studied through material remains. This approach is possible because social practice and memory have archaeologically visible material consequences.

This study fo cuses on architecture and ceramics in these valleys, and us es these data to evaluate how migration affects how identi ty is expressed in migrant and indigenous groups.

The contributors to this volume interpret 35 years of re search at the Salmon ruins in the Middle San Juan region of northern New Mexico and southern Colorado. The an cient Pueblo sites in this area rapidly became population and political centers during the 11th and 12th centuries. Recent research, presented here, suggests that this change resulted both from migration and colonization by people from Chaco Canyon, and from the emulation of Chacoan characteristics by local groups. Roth, Barbara J., and Robert J. Stokes, editors 2007 Exploring Variability in Mogollon Pithouses.

The chapters in this volume illustrate the variation in pit houses by drawing on recent fieldwork and presenting the results of recent research. The articles cover many parts of the Mogollon region: the Mogollon highlands, the Mim bres River Valley and associated uplands, and the Jornada region of se New Mexico and western Texas.

ISBN 1-84553-044-6. Ground stone artifacts have received less methodological attention than other classes of artifacts until recendy. The authors in this volume seek to redress that imbalance by discussing the variety of approaches that can be used to an alyze these artifacts. They also present case studies that are based on original data and which focus on issues of pro duction and exchange, interpreting function and primary versus secondary use, and ground stone artifacts as symbols of luxury and as ritual equipment.

ISBN 978-1-4073-0265-2. The study of craft production systems has been a major fo cus of research in the west, but such discussions are less common with regard to materials from Bronze Age China. Many craft production areas have been excavated at the site of Zhouyuan, and this volume presents a detailed study of one example, a jue-earring workshop excavated between 2002 and 2003. The study discusses manufacturing tech niques, degree of standardization and specialization, the organization of production, and the social status of craft producers and consumers.</page><page sequence="4">476 Publications Vandkilde, Helle 2007 Culture and Change in Central European Prehistory, 6th to 1st Millennium B.C. 215 pages, many black and white illustra tions, references, index.

The contributors to this volume present case studies of the Mesa Verde, Rio Grande, Kayenta, Mogollon, and Hohokam regions. They draw on a wide range of archaeological data sets that are examined through modern social theory to produce an improved understand ing of the ancient Southwest.

She focuses on unknown cit izens who were not recorded in history books, such as an accountant, a coachmaker, the founder of an African Epis copal church, and others. Also, she includes a discussion of the political aspects of modern archaeology. Yoder, Thomas D., and James M. Potter, editors 2007 Animas-La Plata Project. Vol. 4.
