<plain_text><page sequence="1">65 III.-THE EXPERIENCE OF POWER. By W. R. BOYCE GIBSON. THE problem of power is discussed by Hume in close affiliation with that of necessary connexion, and, for all the main purposes of his argument, Humne considers it irrelevant to distinguish between the two meanings. " Let us exanmine," he says, " the impression which underlies the idea of power or necessary connexion," a proposal which clearly takes for granted that one and the same imnpression will account for both ideas. But does Hume discover this common impressional origin ? As we all know, he claims to have discovered it in "the customary tranisition of the imagination from one object to its usual attendant " (Enquiry, Sect. VII, Part II). In brief, the habit of expectation induced by the frequent observation of certain constant sequences of events is the impression from which is derived both the idea of power and the idea of necessary connexion. Now if we examine more closely the lnature of this ultimate impression, we shall see, I think, that whilst it provides what is at least a plausible original of the idea of necessary con- nexion, it cannot be said to provide an equally convincing original of the idea of power. Psychologically, it is primd facie quite intelligible that the experience of the constant con- junction of certain events should stamp in the habit of such expectation, and so induce a belief in necessary connexion. We are so prone to treat our stiffened prejudices as infallible that we feel that much might be said for the view that our prejudice in favour of necessity is simply a psychologically strengthened impression of uniformity. But when we turni from the idea of necessary connexion to the idea of power, the solution seems at once less plausible. E</page><page sequence="2">66 BOYCE GIBSON. For is it really intelligible, as a matter of genetic psychology, that the idea of power should be derived from the impression of sequences uniformly followed or from the habit of expecta- tion which the observatioin of such sequences engenders ? Uniformity, habit may perhaps constitute a sound psycho- logical basis for a belief in the idea of necessary connexion, but do they form an equally sound psychological basis for a belief in the idea of power? How can the uniformity with which natural events succeed each other breed psychologically the belief in an initiating agency, or even in that " unknown circumstance of an object by which the degree or quality of its effect is fixed and deterinined" (ibid., footnote), and which, says Hume, we call its power? But Hume has something further to say oin this very subject. In an instructive footnote of the Enquiry (Sect. VII, Part I) he takes up the suggestion that the original impression from which the idea of power is copied is the niisau. or strong endeavour of which we are conscious through the resistarnce we meet with in bodies that oppose us, and, after arguing against the thesis, makes at the close an important concession. "It must be confessed," he says very frankly, " that the animal nisus, which we experience, though it can afford no accurate, precise idea of power, enters very much into that vulgar, inaccurate idea which is formed of it." Hume's point here seems to be that, though common sense might glean ideas of connexion from this quarter, science could not do so. But are science anid common sense thus disconnected and divergent ? Is it not truer to say that the scientific idea of power, whatever that may be, is but the vulgar idea rectified and elaborated, and variously adapted to new and special requirements, but in no sense rejected ? At any rate, the reader is apt to leave this footnote with the feeling that an impression which, on Hume's own slhowing, can give rise to a vulgar and inaccurate idea of power is a more hopeful original of that idea than an impression of uniformity and routine which might very well be</page><page sequence="3">THE EXPERIENCE OF POWER. 67 brought forward as the original of the idea of absolute powerlessness. The frank though somewhat grudging concession to which we have just referred does not appear to Hume to prejudice in any way the sceptical drift of his main argument. None the less a more whole-hearted recognition of the common-sense view would have driven him to admit that the impression underlying the idea of power is different from the impression he had himself discovered for the idea of necessary connexion. He would have seen that his main argument could not remain valid in respect of the idea of necessary connexion, except in so far as that idea was dissociated frorn the idea of power, that is, treated in the abstract. Hence it would still remain open for a critic to take his stand on the " vulgar" impression of power, and show, if he could, that when properly appre- hended, it included an intuition of intrinsic connexion which needed no plurality of instances or habit of expectation to give it a meaning, but was itself the authentic source of the idea of causation.* An important advance in this direction was made by Hume's imnmediate successor, Thomas Reid. The view already tentatively advance(d by Locke, that the idea of power or efficient cause is gained from the consciousness we have of the operations of our own minds, was explicitly favoured by Thomas Reid. "It is very probable," he writes, "that the very conception or idea of active power, and of efficient causes, is derived from our voluntary exertions in producing effects; and that, if we were not conscious of such exertion, we should have no conception at all of a cause, or of active power, and consequently no conviction of the necessity of a cause of every change which he observes in nature."t * Vide Dr. F. C. S. Schiller's " Humism and Humanism," Proc. Arist. Soc., 1906-7. See also the Note appended to this paper. t Works of T. Reid, Hamilton's edition, p. 604. E 2</page><page sequence="4">68 BOYCE GIBSON. From this passage it might seem to follow that Reid was prepared to admit that as voluntary agents we had a direct consciousniess of power. That we have any such consciousness, however, he explicitly denies. Power, he tells us, "is neither an object of sense nor of consciousness." " We are conscious," Reid goes on, " of the operations of our minds, but power is not an operation of the minld. If we had no notions but such as are furnished by the external senses, and by consciousness, it seems to be impossible that we should ever have any conception of power " (ibid., p. 446). However, there is a third source of immediate knowledge, according to Reid, namely, belief or conviction. "We have very early, from our constitution," he says, " a conviction or belief of sorne degree of active power in ourselves " (p. 513), and not only in ourselves, but also in others. This conviction is implied in every act of volition. "Every volition implies a conviction ,of power to do the action willed" (p. 447). In this it differs from desire with which this conviction of power is not bound up. Thus we may desire to visit the moon, but we do not will to do so, because we realise that we have not the power to do as we desire. Again, the conviction in question is implied in all deliberation, " for no man in his wits deliberates whether he shall do what he believes not to be in his power" (p. 447); it is also implied in the resolution consequent on deliberation, and in every honest promise that we make, "for he is not an honest man who promises wlhat he does not believe he has power to perform" (p. 447). What Reid precisely understands by this belief or conviction is not altogether clear. His most faithful and characteristic feeling on the matter is that it is just an innate assur*ance accompanying an intuitive judgment for which no other warrant can be given than that it is "intended by the Author of our Being to guide our actions" (p. 447). The main point, however, is that, for Reid, this conviction is not to be identified with consciousness, not even with consciousness of Self or of</page><page sequence="5">THE EXPERIENCE OF POWER. 69 an external world. Of the existence of Self and world we have no more than a conviction. Consciousness Reid defines as a powver, "that power of the mind by which it has an immediate knowledge of its own operations " (p. 512), and power, as Reid puts it, " lies behind the scene " of mental operations. We think and feel and sense, yet are not conscious of ourselves as thinking, feeling, sensing. When James says "The universal conscious fact is not 'feelings and thoughts exist,' but 'I think' and 'I feel,"' he is saying more than Reid would care to say. The " I think"' and " I feel" is with Reid a belief or conviction in which the only object of consciousness proper is the concrete but still depersonalised operation of thinking or feeling,. Reid's divorce between consciousness and conviction follows inevitably from his view that consciousness, like Power generally, " lies behind the scene." The phrase betrays the fact that Reid, despite his repudiation of nouimena behind the scene of phenomena, is still under the spell of the " substance " view to this exteint that he obscurely pictures self, world, and power as quasi-substantive presences which as such may not intrude into the world of consciousness. What we are conscious of is the operation without the operator. Reid is not prepared to adnmit that the operation is itself the trans- parent medium through which the operating agency reveals itself. In a word Reid denies Self-consciousness; he sub- stitutes for it personal conviction. Reid's attitude becomes clearer in the light of his treatment of the conception or idea of power. For, unlike Hume, Reid admits that we have a well-grounded idea of power, though he holds that this idea is rooted not in any actual consciousness of power, but in a belief or conviction of its efficacy. As a result of this difference of origin we only have a relative as opposed to a direct conception of power. " Of some things," he writes, " we know what they are in themselves: our conception of such things I call direct. Of other things we know not what</page><page sequence="6">70 BOYCE GIBSON. they are in themselves, but only that they have certain properties or attributes, or certain relations to otlher things; of these our conception is only relative" (p. 513). Thus, supposing it should be asked, What is mind ? The answer comes: It is that which thinks. But I ask not what it does, says Reid, or what its operations are, but what it is. " To this," he says, " I can find no aniswer." So again we read that " our notion of body is not direct but relative to its qualities. We know that it is something extended, solid and divisible, and we know no more" (p. 513). We are now in a positioni to consider the extent to which Reid takes us beyond the conclusions of Hume. Negatively, as a destructive critic, Reid is strong. His strength comes out inore particularly in7 this, that he sees precisely where the main problem lies. In Section VII of the Introductioin to his I&lt;quiry into the Human Mind, after having, made a brief survey of the philosophies of Descartes, Locke, Berkeley, Hume, and more particularly of the Treatise of Human Nature, Reid comes to the conclusion that the system of all these authors is essentially the same, and leads to scepticism. "The facts," he says, "give reason to apprehend that Descartes' system of the human understanding, which I shall beg leave to call the ideal system, and which, with some improvements made by later writers, is now generally received, hath some original defect; that this scepticisin is inlaid in it, and reared along with it; and, therefore, that we must lay it open to the foundation, and examine the materials, before we can expect to raise any solid and useful fabric of Knowledge on this subject'" (p. 103). We do not propose to enter here into Reid's clear-sighted criticism of the Ideal theory, as he calls it, the theory of which the main tenet, speaking, broadly, is that what we know through experience are not things but ideas. His conclusion is that the sense-impression in the very act of its beinig appre- heinded refers us beyond itself to soimiething other than itself,</page><page sequence="7">THE EXPERIENCE OF POWER. 71 and utterly unlike itself, as unlike as is the point of a sword to the pain which its incision iniflicts. This reference to a substantive reality transcending the direct impression is spoken of by Reid, in his earlier treatise at least, as a " sugcrestion" and the impression is called a " sign." But the sig,nificate is not of the same order as the sign, and the suggestion is not as with Berkeley a means of relating one impression to another. Sign and significate are ab initio and prior to the growth of any association systenms welded together into one composite whole of experience, though our awareness of the sign, significantly enough, is different in kind from our awareness of the significate. Of the latter we have only a conviction, not a consciousness. Into the mechanism of this relation between sign and significate Reid does not profess to enter. "How a sensation should instantly make us conceive and believe the existence of an external thing altogether unlike to it, I do not pretend to know; and when I say that the one suggests the other, I mean not to explain the manner of this connexion, but to express a fact, which everyone may be conscious of-namely, that, by a law of our nature, such a con- ception and belief constantly and immediately follow the sensation " (p. 131). Yet, sympathize as we may with the genieral drift of Reid's criticism, we are bound to admit its insufficiency. Thus Hume and Reid both agree that we are conscious of an impression of voluntary exertion as such. Reid, however, maintains that we are not only conscious of the impression but convinced by a native act of intuitive judgment-through which sign and significate are primitively linked together-of the existence of the active power of which the voluntary exertion in question is the impressional sign. The disciple of Hume protests that he can see no justification for weighting the impression with this ilntuitive judgment of existence, thereby answering the question at the same time as it is asked. Reid responds that this is precisely what Nature does for us; she makes her signs so</page><page sequence="8">72 BOYCE GIBSON. transparent that we at once divine the hidden meaning and apprehend the deeper reality which they signify or suggest. But if this is really so, we can imagine Hume replying, how is it that one and the same immediate act of consciousness does not make us aware of sign and significate alike ? You tell me two things which I find hard to reconcile. On the one hand you affirm that the impression corresponding to the idea of power is at bottom something of the nature of substance of whose existence we have no direct consciousness but only a conviction; and yet at the same time you tell me that it is very probable that we could have no conviction or conception of power were it not for the immediate consciousness we have of voluntary exertion. Which, then, is the true original of the idea of power; is it the " something behind the scene of operation " or is it the voluntary exertion itself ? And this is the question which, in nmy opinion, Reid still leaves unanswered. His thought is still clogged by the Cartesian doctrine of substance, though, in its more construc- tive movement, it is permeated by the regenerating conviction that the true starting-point of philosophy is not the impression (which is after all only an abstraction) but the more concrete and fundamental intuitions of world, self and spiritual power. Reid has clearly seen that Hume's foundations are unsatis- factory, but he has only obscurely grasped the true reason why the standpoint adopted by Hume must by its very nature debar him from true philosophical vision. For this further specific service in the elucidation of the problem philosophy is indebted not only to the Critical Epistemology of Kant, but also and more proximately and directly to the Introspective Psychology of Kant's younger contemporary, Maine de Biran (1766-1824). Fran?ois-Pierre-Gonthier Maine de Biran was born in 1766, the son of a physician at Bergerac. He died in 1824. As a young man he joined the life-guards of Louis XVI, but the regiment was disbanded in the early days of the Ptevolution,</page><page sequence="9">THE EXPERIENCE OF POWER. 73 and he retired to his father's estate at Grateloup. The enforced leisure of the Revolution period decided his vocation as a philosopher. It was precisely the same need for temporary seclusion during the Revolution ferment that made a philosopher of de Biran's earlier contemporary, Destutt de Tracy. Both were by profession soldiers, men of action compelled by circum- stances to content themselves with leisure as a second best, and maybe this fact is not wholly ungermane to the tendency shown by both thinkers to emuphasise the active element in their analysis of human nature. De Biran's philosophy is essentially personalistic, and in this special sense that for him the primary fact, the " first pivot," as he puts it, "of human science, is our own direct experience of ourselves as causal agents. The source of all our ideas of power and causation is the Self, the Self conscious of itself as Will, i.e., as a free, originative power. This fundamental importance attached to self-consciousness as the primary iiltuition reveals the influence of de Biran's great compatriot, Descartes. And de Biran is quite aware that he is in his own way carrying on the Cartesian tradition. But his own way is not at all identical with that followed by Descartes, and he is at much pains to make the difference clear. Broadly speaking, we may express the difference in two ways. In the first place, de Biran objects radically to what he terms the ontological treatment of mind as a substance; and in the second place he gives the primacy to Will, and stands out as a Voluntarist against all forms of Rationalism. Thus, where Descartes says Cogito, de Biran says Volo, and the " cogito ergo sum" appears in the following revised form:-" Je me sens ou m'apervois cause libre, donc je suis reellement cause" (I feel or perceive myself as a free cause, hence I am really a cause). Where Descartes posits an intuitive connexion between his consciousness and his sutbstantial self, de Biran posits the intuitive connexion betweein his consciousness and his causal self. Nor is the distinction by any means nmerely verbal or to be overcome simnply by identifying the categories of</page><page sequence="10">74 BOYCE GIBSON. substance and causality. For what Descartes means by " consciousness " cannot be the same as what de Biran means, since, as de Biran himself puts it, we have no consciousness of substance, ulo immediate feeling of it, as we have a conscious- ness of force or of causation.* " If Descartes," he says else- where, " had put cause in the place of substance when recording the primitive fact upon whiclh, as he so clearly and so profoundly realised, the whole of science must ultimiately depend, Spinozism would never have been born" (ibid., p. 192). But in this declaration de Biran's meaning is not ftully given. We mnust add that in order to have stayed at its source the drift towards Spinozism, Descartes, after substituting cause for substance, would also have had to modify his view of con- sciousness. De Biran thus distinguishes slharply between the rnoi, the self, the actual subject in the psychological sense of the term, and the soul, as the absolute or ontological subject. If we start from the ontological soul-in-itself which has no intrinsic connexion with consciousness but endures persistently before, during,, and after consciousness, we can do nothing but revolve helplessly round our abstract startingi-point until we fall a prey to David Hume. On the other hand, the starting-point of the psychological self when the self is immediatelv apprehended as first cause and as an original source of power, is a spring of synthetic possibilities, the self, as de Biran expresses it, beiing " a cause which is conscious of itself in and through the effects which it produces " (ibid., p. 375). In drawing this distinction between soul and self De Biran is developing, aaain in his own way, a distinction which had been already drawn, though differenitly, by Locke. Locke distinguished between a self or person on the one hand, and a soul or spiritual substance on the other. The Self has con- sciousness, personial identity, individuality (Essay JI, 27, * ATouvelles considerations 8ur les rapports du physique et du moral de ihomme (edited by M. Cousin), p. 249.</page><page sequence="11">THE EXPERIENCE OF POWER. 75 ?? 9, 16, and 25), and as such is quite distinct from the immaterial substance he calls Soul. Personal identity consists, says Locke, "not in the identity of substance, but . . . . in the identity of consciousness" (ibid., II, 27, ? 19). "For it being the same consciousness that makes a man be himself to hiinself, personal identity depends on that only, whether it be annexed solely to onie individual substance, or can be continued in a succession of several substances" (ibid., ? 10). Locke's whole discussion of this point is so attractively and suggestively presented that we may take it for granted that de Biran's own ,distinction between self and soul starts from the distinction as drawn by Locke. It is, moreover, Locke himself who makes clear the abstract, ghostly character of spiritual substanice. With regard to substance in general, he says: " If any one will examine himiiself concerning his notion of pure substance in general, he will find he has no other idea of it at all, but -only a supposition of he knows not what of . . . . qualities." This is Locke's notion of " substance in general." That of -spiritual substance is still miiore impalpable. For it is framed fronm that of substance in general by the addition of the lnegative characteristic " immaterial." It is true that Locke occasionally follows the Cartesian practice of referring to spiritual substance as a " thinkinig thing," but what is a "thinking thing " that has no consciousness ? For his criticism of the doctrine of spiritual substance, de Biran, though undoubtedly owing something to Locke, is, -on his own confession, more especially indebted to Leibniz. De Biran has written an essay on the philosophical doctrine *of Leibniz, anld one of his familiar Leibnizian quotations is the following: "If we would shed light on the idea of substance, we must revert to that of force or energy . . . . Active, actually active force is not the bare potency as recognized in the schools. Indeed, we must beware of interpreting it, after the scholastic fashioni, as a simple faculty or possibility of acting which, in order to be effectively brought into action, needs the</page><page sequence="12">76 BOYCE GIBSON. incitement of an external and, as it were, an alien stimulus. Genuine active force includes action within itself ; it is an entelechy, a power that is a mean between the simple faculty of actingu anad the act itself as determined or carried out: this energy contains or einvelopes the effort."* In a striking article on " Self and Soul," which appeared in the Philosophical Review, May, 1908, Professor Mary Calkins points out that the difference between the barren abstractness of the notion of soul or spiritual substance and the concreteniess of the notion of self arises largely from the fact that whereas the latter is found directly through introspection, the former is reached indirectly vi&amp; the body. " Instead of starting, like modern personalists, from the introspective observation of the conscious self, the spiritualistic philosophers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries," she says, "describe the soul from the standpoint of its relation to the body, that is, they attribute to the soul predicates which are mere negations of bodily characteristics . . . . Because body is extended and divisible, therefore, it is argued, the soul is unextended, indivisible, simple." It is interesting to note, by way of comparison and contrast, that in Professor Bergson's nomen- clature the soul stands for what is supremely vital, and the self, alas! is somewhat in the background. But no one will accuse Professor Bergson of reaching his notion of " soul" by way of that of the body! Yet despite the difference in nomenclature in tbhis respect between Bergson and de Biran, these two philosophers are fundarmientally at one in their insistence that it is onily from the point of view of the actual experieint that any true notion of "soul," or "self," can be gained. And havino won a fruitful point of view in the depths of the living soul itself, they are both prepared to part altogether with the ontological notionl of self as spiritual substance. Moreover, it is a natural * Opera Leibn. ed. Dutens, Vol. II, p. 18. "De primee philosophiae emendatione et notione substantive."</page><page sequence="13">THE EXPERIENCE OF POWER. 77 consequence of having found in common the fruitful and intimate standpoint of genuine inward experience that Bergson and de Biran agree in the independenice they claim for psychology, particularly in relation to physiological science. The complete independence of physiology and of psychology proper is one of de Biran's main contentions. " If one were to ask," writes a professor (M. Laromiguiere) whom de Biran is subjecting to one of his mercilessly thoroughgoing criti- cisms, " if one were to ask how a certain definite movement of the braini produces a feeling, in the soul, how the soul's action can possibly set the brain in motion, we should reply that we know nothilng about it." "Yes," says de Biran, "but before we enquire how the thing is possible, we must first ask whether the hypothesis is well founded, or can be accepted as describing soniething which actually happens. A certain definite movement of the brain, you say, produces a feeling in the soul. Now who knows that this is true, anld how can we even conceive it? Physiological observation teaches us that the body is an organism, that there are such things as brain, nerves, etc. But in what relation does this visible organisation stand to feeling, and, above all, to the force which produces movemnenit, to Will or to Self ? " If there is an abyss," continues de Biran, " our philosopher does not appear to have placed himself at the point of view whence he could have seen where the abvss really lies, namely, in the very hypothesis which he accepts as a fact" (Nouvelles Contsiderations, etc., p. 258). In another connexion, when the same unfortunate professor has been stating that " experience informs us, from time to tiine, of an action of the soul which is followed by a move- ment of the brain, and this by a movement of the organ towards, or from, the object," de Biran, after much preliminiary criticism, continues: "Thus it is only physiologically, and, on the basis of conjectures more or less hazardous, rather than front any witness of direct experience; that we represent to ourselves</page><page sequence="14">78 BOYCE GIBSON. the transmission of impressions to the brain, thence to the soul, which then reacts after its own fashion, and so on. What is quite certain is that all this organised mechanism bears no resemblance wbatever to the psychological phenomiena of inner experience to which we give the names impression, sensation, feeling-and still less to the cause, or force, which pro- duces these phenomena " (ibid. p. 256). On another and similar occasion, when de Biran has detected Physiology in the act of taking upon itself the functions of Psychology, he breaks out in the following terms: "Do I need all this apparatus of reactions and organic movements, in order to know when I am active and when I am passive? Do the physiologists really hope to explain on these lines iy own personal activity ? Cannot they see that they simply deface and obscure this activity when they attempt to represent or depict it by means of inmages or symbols that are foreign to it, seeking for its presence in the object before they have grasped it in the subject, and as it is in its own nature ? " (ibid., p. 257). Perhaps we have now said enough to indicate in a genieral way what de Biran understanids by the psychological point of view which he adopts. It is opposed both to the ontological and to the empirical standpoints as traditionally understood; the metaphysiciails erring, as he says, in rnaking of the soul a substance or thing-in-itself, the empiricists fallin, under the sceptical criticism of Hume. De Biran can at least give a clear answer to the question as to which is the true original of the idea of power, the " something behind the scene of operation'" or "the voluntary exertion itself." For to him the former is but the discarded abstraction of spiritual substance, and the latter rich with the indwelling presence of the self. "The myself," says de Biran, " exists only in its willed effort" (ibid., p. 374). " I consider it an assured truth,'.' he writes again, " that the basis and essential support of both science and belief is the consciousness of self, or the causal activity which constitutes the self" (ibid., p. 390).</page><page sequence="15">THE EXPERIENCE OF POWER. 79 We pass on now to de Biran's more direct criticism of Humne. De Biran's criticism of Hume's opinion concerning the nature and origin of the notion of Causality, more par- ticularly concerning the influence of volition over the organs of the body, is contained in an appendix to a work of which the title is: Further Reflections upon the Relations Existing Betweerv the Physical and the Moral Nature of Alan,-a posthumous work first published in 1834, 10 years after his death, by M. Cousin.* De Biran concentrates his attention on a single paragraph or two in Sectioni VII of the Enquiry (marginal Section 52 in Selby-Bigge's edition), where Hume discusses the " pretension" that we are conscious of the will's influence over the organs of movement, and that the idea of power is " an idea of reflection ' won by reflecting over this conscious experience of inward power. This argument de Biran divides under seven main heads. (here rearranged and reduced to six), and each of these he criticizes in turn. Occasionally he takes liberties with the text or is misled by a translation, but in no case, so far as I can judge, does he make Hume responisible for sentiments which the latter would have disavowed. Hurne's First Point.-," The influence of volition over the organs of the body is a fact of experience on a par with all other natural events." By way of reply, de Biran categorically denies the parity in question, and insists on the essential distinction, in respect of' knowledge and of certitude, between inner and outer experience. " A fact of inward immediate experience is not known in the same way as a fact of outward experience is known. An operation of the will or the self resembles in nothing, the so-called operations of Nature. The representation of an object * C.f. Dr. F. C. S. Schiller's independent treatment of the same. problem in " Humism and Humanism," Proc. Arist. Soc., 1906-7, pp. 99-106.</page><page sequence="16">80 BOYCE GIBSON. or phenomenon is perfectly compatible with reflective question- ing as to the reality of the object or the external cause of the phenomenon; but the internal apperception of the act or the power, the actual performance or exercise of which I myself attribute to myself, is its own object or prototype. 'Tis an original sentiment, the type of every idea of external force, so that there is no primitive external type which it could take as a model." A second difference between inner and outer experience follows from the first, and it is this, that " the number of repetitions adds nothing to the persuasion or belief in a real, infallible union between cause and effect in so far as the union or relation between the elements is immnediately apper- ceived, as in the case of that between the act of volition and the movements of our limbs. On the other hand, in the association of images or ideas, the persuasion that a certain given phenomenon will follow certain others w hich have constantly accompanied it on previouis occasions, grows with the number of repetitions; habit is here the soul of belief in the measure of its intensity." flume's Second Point.-" We learn the influence of our will fromi experience alone. And experience only teaches us how one event constantly follows another; without instructing us in the secret connexion, which binds them together and renders them inseparable." De Biran's most direct answer to this point is contained not in the First Appendix but in another writing of his where he is found replying to the cognate question: " Why do we set up a necessary connexion between volition and effort?" " Voluntary effort, qud immiediately apperceived," he says, "is a single fact composed of two elements, a single relation uniting two terms, neither of which can be isolated from the other without changing its nature or passing from concrete to abstract, from relative to absolute. Volition considered as in the soul and outside its effect, resolves itself into the notion of</page><page sequence="17">THE EXPERIENCE OF POWE12. 81 absolute force, a notion of an entirely different type, and certainly not primitive. On the other side, the effect, the movement considered objectively as a function of the muscle or organ of movement, and out of relation to the will which actualises it or actualises itself in it, is a physiological fact, or a passive sensation like any other. In affirming the connexion, I will not say between two facts, but between two essential elements of one and the same fact, we are simply expressing what is, indeed, the primnitive fact of consciousness, and take no step beyond this. "We are confronted, it is said, with this alternative: Either the connexion . . . is the object of an immediate perception, or we interpolate it through a process of reasoning. In this latter case we relapse into the scepticism of Hume or into the formalism of Kant." "Certainly," adds de Biran, " and so it only remains to justify the first alternative." The justification however is very brief. It follows from the insight that the connexion in question is involved in the very nature of the self qud self. For the self is a cause which is aware of itself in and through the effects which it produces. The primitive and intrinsic connexion between cause and effect lies in the very nature of self-consciousness as a fact of inner experience. Hume's Third Point.-" The influence of volition over the organs of the body can never be foreseen fromn any apparent energy or power in the cause, which connects it with the effect, and renders the one an infallible consequence of the other." The precise feature in this assertion upon which de Biran seizes is the view that the energy iii question is not itself an apparent fact, a fact of experience. As against this view he contends that this energy or power, though never manifested as an objective presentation is manifest to the experient himself in inner experience. " It is quite true that, so far as outer experience is con- cerned, the fact can never be foreseen in the power of the F</page><page sequence="18">82 BOYCE GIBSON. cause; and simply for this reason, that we see nothing beyond the fact, and do not see or perceive in any way the power of the cause. It is quite otherwise in an inner experience such as that of free effort or the effective influence of volition within the movements which it produces. We feel the effect at the same time as we apperceive the cause, and the first act of consciousness at once teaches us to foresee the fact of move- ment within the very power of its cause which is ourself." " What is meant," he continues, " by the expression 'mani- festation of power or energy' ? Does this imply an objective representation of power? It is quite certain that there is nothingr of this kind in the immediate consciousness we have of our own energy or mnotor activity. But how is any one to prove that in order that the reality of this internal force should be attested with the full evidence of conisciousness, and possess for us the value of a principle or primitive fact, it is necessary that it should manifest itself in the form of an objective representation ? " Hutme's Fourth Point.-" We learn fromi anatomy that the immiediate object of power in voluntary mnotion is not the member itself which is moved, but certain muscles, and nerves, and animal spirits, and, perhaps, something still more minute and more unknown, through which the motion is successively propagated, ere it reach the member itself whose mnotion is the immediate object of volition. Can there be a more certain proof that the power, by which this whole operation is performed, so far fronm being directly and fully -known by an inward sentiment or consciousness, is, to the last degree, miiysterious and unintelligible." " Why should we trouble ourselves," says de Biran in -reply, "about the way in which the soul's action influences the different parts of the body which it puts into play, *whether it be that it influences some single organic centre directly, or makes its contact through fluids or animal spirits, ,the existence of which is assumed, though the assumption can never have been ratified by experience ? We readily graiit</page><page sequence="19">THE EXPERIENCE OF POWER. 83 that this kind of problem is insoluble; but what is not insoluble, what is not even a question though it is above all things else the very point at issue, is to know whether in every voluntary act or movement we have or have not the consciousness of power, of energy, of the force which starts the movement, holds it in leash, or stops it altogether? " If not, then I ask: How do we contrive to get any idea whatsoever of nisus and of force when we inwardly distinguish a voluntary act which we ourselves create from an involuntary movement which takes place without our co-operation, and in spite of us ? "cIf, however, we have this consciousness of power, and it is impossible to deny that we have it, for the reality of a power of movenment is, as a matter of fact, verified in the only possible way in which it could be verified, namely, by con- sciousness, or the intimate feeling of a free effort, it is very evident that there will be no need for us to ascertain how the soul acts, or whether its action takes place immediately or througlh a more or less lengthy series of intermediate effects before being able to assure ourselves of the reality of this motive power which is our very self (qui est le nous-mdmes), ancl to be authorised afterwards to refer to this same source all the notions of force which are derived from it. " We may then confidently maintain the thesis directly opposed to that of Hume, and whereas the latter pretends that our invincible state of ignorance concerning the soul's action on the body, as also concerning the means or the circumstances of that action, is certain proof that this mlotive power, far from being intelligible to consciousness, is, on the contrary, mysterious and unintelligible to the last degree; we would assert the very opposite and say: It is precisely because we have an immediate consciousness of this power, and can know it through no other channel, that it cannot be conceived as a thing in itself or represented to the inmagination through the means or instruments of its exercise. F 2</page><page sequence="20">84 BOYCE GIBSON. " In a word, it is precisely because the immediate evidence for its existence is so perfect from the subjective point of view, that, from the objective point of view, it is mysterious and unintelligible to the last degree." Hume's Fifth Point.-" Is there any principle in all Nature more mysterious than the union of soul with body; by which a supposed spiritual substance acquires such an influence over a material one, that the mnost refined thought is able to actuate the grossest matter ? Were we empowered, by a secret wish, to remove nmountains, or control the planets in their orbit, this extensive authority would not be more extra- ordinary, nor more beyond our comprehension." "With regard to the foregoing argument," says de Biran, "let me make a remark calculated to cut short many discussions and insoluble questions. " When we take the self, the experiencing self, as cause, and the muscular sensations as effect, there is no occasion for asking what is the ground of the intimate relation which unites these two terms in the consciousness of willed effort, inasmuch as it is the psychological fact in which our very existence consists, a fact beyond which we cannot pass without getting out of ourselves or changing our point of view; but a truly inexplicable mystery must await that inquirer who, after assuming the soul to be a thinig or an object, and the body another object, endeavours to picture to himself how a simple and active substance can act, or exercise its motive power upon a substance that is passive and comiiposed of parts. " Indeed to explain how this mutual actioni, this nexus of the two substances takes place, it would be necessary, first of all to picture to oneself a force which is in itself alien to the self;. .e., represent in the form of an image and in objective fashion what can only be given subjectively in the intimate self- consciousness which the thinkino subject enjoys in action andc creative effort." Now " suppose I wish to listen to a melody, and at once, as.</page><page sequence="21">THE EXPERIENCE OF POWER. 85 by magic, the sounds of the melody strike my ear, could I attribute the result to myself as an effect of which my will was the efficient cause, just as though I had produced the sounds by my own singing? . " Who can deny the essential difference between these two cases ? And how can we fail to see that this difference consists precisely in this, that there is willed effort and consciousness of causation only in the second case, and in the first case nothing of the kind ? It is the statement of this difference which here concerns us and not any sort of explanation: an intimate fact such as that of a power finding effect through the movements of the body is not a thing that we explain; for in the order of knowledge it comes first, and itself helps to explain all the facts of our intellectual and moral nature, as it does all the notions of which it is the principle." fume's Sixth Point.-" If by consciousness we perceived any power or energy in the will," then, argues Hume, not only must we know this power and its connexion with the effect, we must also "know the secret union of soul and body, and the nature of both these substances, by which the one is able to operate in so many instances upon the other." We have here a hypothetical statement, says de Biran in reply, which tends to nothing less than a comnplete reversal of all legitimate grounds of reasoning, and the purport of de Biran's objection amounts, I think, briefly to this, that the statement makes the certitude of an inner fact depend upon that of a problematic piece of external knowledge which can in no way be inferred from it. He therefore sets to work to reconstruct the hypothetical statement in question, and in so doing to re-establish the natural order of reasoning. The re- constructed sylloaism runs as follows:-(It takes the form: " If A, then not B. But B, .. not A.") "If the inner consciousness which reveals to us an active power within our voluntary effort were dependent on the absolute knowledge of the soul or of its union with the body, or finally of the nmanner. in</page><page sequence="22">86 BOYCE GIBSON. which the two substances mutually interact, we should then not be able to enjoy the intimate sense of power without at the same time possessing an objective knowledge of the separate substances and of the means of their interaction. " But, as a nmatter of fact, we have the iniward apperception of an active power inseparable from that which constitutes our very existenice; . . . we have the consciousness of an immediate and intimate union between the cause or the force we call 'ourself' which produces the movement, anid the effect produced, namely, the muscular sensation, and we have all this apart fromn any knowledge of the soul in itself as a presenited object, or of its union with the body. "Therefore," runs the conclusion, " the intimate sense of power which we enjoy is independent of all objective knowledge about spiritual and corporeal substances and their reciprocal union." "Thus," says Maine de Biran, " by distinguishing two points of view or two sorts of elernents which the sceptic is perpetually confusing. . . we overthrow at a stroke the whole scaffolding upon which his arguments depend for support." In the careful answer to Hume which we have just been considering we have the essence of de Biran's philosophical position. It is the position of a psychologist who holds that philosophy cannot dispense with a psychological basis, and we would venture the conviction that no thinker has defined with greater clearnless or precision the ultimate standpoint of a philosophical psychology. Not only has de Biran vindicated the intrinsic independence of psychology in respect of physiology and other natural sciences, on the one hand, and of ontology on the other, but he has shown that the central truths of psychology and philosophy are confluent, if not identical, anld that the leading concepts of philosophy-self, world, cause- have their origin and ground in the experience of personal power. Placing himself at the inner standpoint of the experi- ent he has shown that the well-spring of reality, the " datum</page><page sequence="23">THE EXPERIENCE OF POWER. 87 datissimum," is neither an object nor a substance, nor even a subject in the abstract, but a subject felt and realised as a present source of power, a concrete myself or " moi." In this fixing of the experiencer's standpoint as not only central for psychology but ultimate for philosophy as well, de Biran, in my opinion, has made the first esselntial movement towards setting Modern Philosophy on a fruitful basis, the basis of personal experience; and, by his critical reconstruction in this very sense of the Cogito ergo sum, has taken the essential step towards liniking the Cartesian starting-point with that of such thinkers as Henri Bergson and Rudolf Eucken. For these, like de Biran, are committed to the conviction that the experience of spiritual power is the fundamental fact with which philosophy has to reckon. But if it is necessary to emphasize the value of the work which de Biran has done in exposing the inadequacy of Hume's standpoint, it is perhaps no less important to recognize the limitations of his psychological answer to Hume. That a psychological basis is indispensable to philosophy is de Biran's firm conviction. That it is insufficient is what he did not see so clearly. Connectingr the causal efficacy of the self with muscular sensations instead of with the qualities of a relatively indepenident and resistent not-self, he is unable to give any clear account of how we come to realise and to know the existence of a world external to ourselves. Further, as his editor and critic, Victor Cousin, clearly saw, de Biran fails to do justice to the power of reason; hence, to call himi the French Kant without further qualification is certainly misleading. Nor was de Biran in aniy sense a mystic, so that the self which he has doine so much to vivify and liberate is still left some- what like a windowless monad with no direct access to wider and loftier sources of spiritual life. We must therefore look beyonld de Biran, but before we attempt this further advance it may be well to define more clearly the main bearings of our present enquiry.</page><page sequence="24">88 BOYCE GIBSON. The aim of this paper is to trace the stages through which the experience of power has been recoanised through psycho- logical analysis as the central fact of life, the fundamental "impression." With this aim before us we have taken-and still take-as our main clue, the clear challenge of David Hume that we show him, if we can, the impression from which the idea of power, or necessary connexion, can be validly derived. Witlh this clue in our hands, we shall find that the relevant line of further search lies in a psychological direction which, in proportion as we penetrate more deeply into the problem, opens out into the concrete issues of morality and religion. The strictly ethical answer to Hume's challenge comes from the Critique of the Practical Reason. With Kant the First Critique is but the prologue to the Second, and the Second alone gives a direct answer to Hume's main question. It proclaims that the source of the idea of causality, though it transcends experience, transcends, that is, the phenomenal realm with which scientific knowledge is alone concerned, is not wholly inaccessible. It lies in the moral will, i.e., in the pure practical reason. The " impression" here reappears in the transfigured guise of a categorical imperative, as the power of the pure principle of duty.* But our clue, faithfully held, must prevenit us from resting in a solution which can assign no psychological basis to the experience of power, and we should be driven by the very urgency of the challenge, as we take it up from Hume himself, to look for a solution in which this ethical depth is revealed within the intimacy of personal experience. However, to follow up our problem into the moral and religious sphere would take us beyond * Here, again, we realise the importanice of not associating too closely the ideas of power and of necessary connexion. For the only revelation of power which Kant recognises is that of a free causality. The moral imperative is not a "must " but a "should," not a necessity but an obligation.</page><page sequence="25">THE EXPERIENCE OF POWER. 89 the limits within which we have proposed to confine ourselves. Our main aim, as already stated, is to follow the psychological line of development from Hume, and to emphasize the important, and, indeed, indispelnsable character of this line of enquiry, when its resources, its spiritual resources, are properly understood. We proceed to point out a further limitation to the scope of the present paper. It is clear that so long as we keep to our clue, and are look- ing for a positive solution to Hume's question, we shall not be concerned with those answers to Hume which, however effective they may be in other respects, start by agreeing with Hfume that experience can show us no such impression as that of power or necessary connexion. For our present purpose these critics may be identified with Hume himself, for they, no less than he, challenge us to point thenm to a genuine " impression" of power. The Kantian Critique of Pure Reason, and the Avenarian Critique of Pure Experience, come under this head. They differ, it is true, in essential respects. Kant holds with Hume that the idea of necessary connexion is still essential to science, differingy fromn Hume only in the coniviction that it can be furnished from a source that transcends experience, whereas the pure experientialists such as Avenarius, Mach, and Karl Pearson imaintain that the idea of necessary con- nexion is a mere anthropomorphic fetish, and must be jealously precluded from science altogether; if science, they say, is not to degenerate into pseudo-science, causality must make way for correlation, aind explaniation for description. But these differences, though they vitally concern the relation of causality to scientific knowledge and method, do not concern its relation to the experience of power. We shall, therefore, leave them on one side and concenitrate on the main issue, as already developed along psychological lines, and brought to a first halting-place by the important developments of Reid and de Biran.</page><page sequence="26">90 BOYCE GIBSON. The line of development from Hume taken, in respect of the problem of power, by Reid and de Biran, may with good reason be characterised as psychological. It is no doubt quite true that Reid was greatly interested in Hume's view of knowledge, and that his main concern lay in exposing the insufficiency of the foundations of a system which ran so inievitably into scepticism. None the less it was through psychological analyses of perception and volition that he strove to break through the meshes of the ideal system, and bring feeling and thought back once mnore into living touch with reality. Maine de Biran again found it necessary to grapple with the Cartesian doctrine of substance, and to steer a middle course between empiricism and ontolooy. But his whole standpoint, in so far as it had any positive bearinig, was frankly and deliberately introspective. Hence, in pursuincg the psychological tack, we are following the lead of Reid and de Biran. In a work published under the title Science ct Psycholoyie (1887), de Biran severely criticizes the views of his con- temporary and predecessor, Destutt de Tracy. The main gist, I believe,* of this criticism is that de Tracy's developments are vitiated by his sensationalismn, and are, as they stand, powerless to meet the criticism of Hume. This, no doubt, is literally true, but the criticism is not sympathetic. De Tracy's work, in my opinion, supplements de Biran's in an important direction, and initiates a line of argument which, in the hands of Professor Stout and others, has already proved very fruitful in elucidating the problem at issue, the experience of power. Moreover, it carries on a mode of treatment which is very clearly illustrated by the main argumnent, and suagests an important question of method, the discussion of which is * I regret that I am unable to speak more definitely on this point, but after a first hasty glance at the article in question, when reading in the British Museum, my further attempts at enlightenment were baffled by the volume being continually " in use."</page><page sequence="27">THE EXPERIENCE OF POWER. 91 needed for setting our own position in a clearer light. We turn then to the Projet d'Jle'nients d'Ideologie by Destutt de Tracy, and in particular to those chapters which deal with the problem of the origin of our consciousness of an external world. De Tracy is confessedly a sensationalist, a disciple of Condillac, but his sensationalism proves on analysis to represent rather a respect for felt reality and a dislike of ideas that have no corresponding impressions than for any crude attempt to rest all experience on a groundwork of mere sensations. A striking feature of his writings, in fact, is the important, indeed pre- dominant part assigned there to the active element in experience. He agrees with de Biran in asserting that it is only through voluntary movemnent that we become conscious of the existence of an external world. So long as we do not act, he says in effect (ibid., p. 114), but remain motionless, content passively to receive the impressions which come to us, these impressions can bring no tidings of an external world. In particular passive touch is as incapable as any other form of sensation of leading, us to suspect the existence of bodies. From this passive touch, he continues, we should distinguish the sensation which accompanies the movement of a limb. " Whenever we move any of our limbs we are apprised of our having done it, we feel that we have done it. We have here a genuine sensation. It has no name, but it is essential that we should draw attention to it. We shall call it the sensation of movement" (ibid., p. 44). Apart from this sensation of movement the impression we receive from the experience of bodily resistance would convey no hint of the existence of the resisting body. As a first step towards this new insight, the sensation of resistance must be appreciated as a sensation of resisted movement. "Let us suppose for a moment that we have the ability to move as we do but without feeling that we do so . . . . I miiove my arm about but am not aware that I am doing it; my arm collides</page><page sequence="28">92 BOYCE GIBSON. with a hard body, but of this I know nothing. I experience the sensation we call resistance, but I know not wherein it consists nor that it has resulted from an opposition to my movement, since I am quite unaware that I have been making any movement at all . . . . But add to this faculty of motion the circumstailce that when we move we are conscious that we do move, and a new order of things begins to reveal itself; for from the moment that a certain specific consciousness accom- panies my movemenit I am necessarily made aware at once so sooni as that consciousness ceases" (ibid., p. 1105). We have then a sensation of resisted nmovement. But for the perception of an external world more is needed than a sensation of resisted movement. " I move my arm about," continues de Tracy, " but am so far unaware that it is my arm that is moving, nor even that I have an arm; however, I experience something that is the sensation of movement; my arm meets a body which stops it. I ani so far innocent that there are such things as bodies. The sensation of movement ceases and I feel that it has done so. But I have not yet an inkling of the cause of this cessation. Here I am then, able to move, and conscious of my movement, and yet still as ignorant of the existence of ani external world as when I experienced only a series of passive impressions of touch .. At least, it is not proven that I am necessarily led by this change of feeling to recognize that that which puts a stop to my sensation of movement is a being external to myself." And de Tracy adds with a pleasing frankness: " I once thought that it was so, but I believe now that I ventured too far." As he puts it in another context, " the two sensations, those of move- ment and of cessation of movement, though no doubt very opposite in quality, are hardly more so than those of whiteness and blackness, of heat and of cold" (ibid., p. 129). The missing link in the total experience through which a perception of the existence of an external world is reached is found by de Tracy in what he calls will, which he defines as</page><page sequence="29">THE EXPERIENCE OF POWER. 93 "the faculty of feeling desires" (ibid., p. 326), or, more fully, following Condillac, as " the faculty we have of experiencing desires, whether these be inclinations towards certain con- ditions of existence or aversion towards others" (ibid., p. 189). It is part of the nature of desire, according to de Tracy, that it cannot without contradiction originate the opposition to its own tendency, which is to persevere in producing the desired effect (cf. ibid., p. 118). Hence the sensation of resisted mnovement, now strengthenied into a sensation of resisted desire, proves the reality of an existence other than that of the desire itself, and, as de Tracy adds: "I believe that no one will be tempted to deny that that which resists my will is something other than myself" (ibid., p. 120). "When I move," we read, ' and know that I move, and at the samre time experience the desire to go on moving, under these circumnstances, if my move- nment stops and my sensation of movement ceases whilst my desire still subsists, I am bound to confess that this can be no effect arising from my own constitution. I am necessarily made aware of an existence other than mine, an existence which opposes the fulfilling of my desire. This desire is in me; it is me. That whiclh resists it, and is contrary to it, is outside me and distinct from me. Here, then, we have mallifestly a being which feels, which is myself, and a being which is felt and is not myself-two quite different and separate existences . . . . of which the second would never have been known had not one of the integral conditions of the- first been a susceptibility to movements, and to movements. moreover, which are not only felt, but carried out in obedience to certain felt desires." With de Tracy, then, the primary fact of experience is the consciousness of our own felt activity. To feel at all is to be conscious of our own existence as a feeling subject, or, as he frequently expresses it, as " a feeling power " (une vertu sentante), where under "feeling power" is to be included the active feeling of relations, i.e., active judgment, and the active</page><page sequence="30">94 BOYCE GIBSON. feeling of inclinationa and aversion, i.e., active desire. But thlere is a further point to note. Our own existence is identified with the feeling of desires which fulfil themselves throuah movement. We feel this movement, but at the start only as a rudimentary feeling of desire in action. Further reflection, it is true, shows us that the sensation of movement is really the product of the resistanlce offered by the inertia of our own bodies, so that but for this resistance we should have no ground even for the knowledge of ourselves as embodied. But de Tracy implies that we tend originally to overlook this resistance of our own body to the impulse of desire, the distinction between feeling self anid bodily self being drawn only at a later stage. The expansion of the consciousness of self into the consciousness of a not-self that resists the self, first occurs when the consciousness of our ownl felt bodily activity under the impulse of felt desire is abruptly broken in its forward flow by an obstacle which desire repudiates as alien to itself. This fundamental property of body as obstacle which de Tracy refers to as " the force of inertia" (ibid., p. 121) is thus, from the point of view of our acquaintance with bodies, the primnary fact. And de Tracy proceeds to show in detail how from this basis of acquainitance a further acquaintance with all the other properties of bodies is progressively built up, for it is his belief that the science of inature is best elaborated under the guidance of a " genetic psychology " of our knowledge of matter. Now with regard to this and similar attempts at " genetic psychology " I should like to draw a distinction, the over- looking of which often leads to confusion. It would, I think, be unjust to de Tracy to assume that the account which he gives us of the steps by which we come to a knowledge of the external world and thence to physical science on a sound basis was intended to be genetic in the ordinary psychological sense of the term. The account gives us the "ideological,"</page><page sequence="31">THE EXPERIENCE OF POWER. 95 not the " psychological," genesis. Hence the complete absence of any reference to our experiences as infants and children need not surprise us. De Tracy's procedure here is akin rather to the voyage of exploration which reflective self- consciousness makes from its own centre as a starting-point on reaching its first maturity, a voyage of which Fichte's philosophy, for instance-or, in part, Hegel's Phenomenology- gives a clearly-defined record. This dialectical exploration, as we might call it, through which the self-conscious impulse of philosophy aims at defining itself and its relations to the not-self is the genesis through which the self enters into intellectual possession of its great inheritance, the Universe, and this deliberate mapping out by the self, this building up of its own world from the home-centre, is something quite different from the time-development of self-consciousness from babyhood upwards. When the philosophical reason has miatuired, it feels the need of reappropriating in a rational way the riches which the time-spirit has garnered up moment by moment and day by day and ordered in association-groups and acquired dispositions. Such adventurous reappropriation of experience, this rational reassimilation of the time-growth within the new Order of Self-consciousness is the Reason's Copernican revolution and a true philosophical expression of the experience of power. In this revaluation of all values the presiding genius is the personal self, and the synthetic principle whereby the power of the self takes systematic effect is the logic inherent in the structure of self-consciousness itself. This conception of a philosophical development, of a spiritual genesis, that is, according to the Order of Reason, we owe in its more developed modern formns to the superb insig,ht of Hegel and of German Idealism generally. But humbler thilnkers like de Tracy have played their modest part as forerunners, and the relative simplicity of their work in this respect is in itself an advantage. Let us differentiate from this point of view the</page><page sequence="32">96 BOYCE GIBSON. contribution of Maine de Biran from that of the French i(leologist. De Biran saw deeper than de Tracy and so found the true startingr-point in the self as a creative power. IDe Tracy's view was more comuprehensive, more directed world- wards, and he mapped out in main tentative outline and at a lower level than de Biran's the world of which the rational self is destined to be the synthetic principle of order. At a lower level, I say, because de Tracy's sensationalistic bias prevents him from so grasping the intrinsic nature of the self as to trace its active and perpetual presence in the logical structure of the science he justifies by reference to it. These complementary points of view suggest the direction in which we might expect to look for the further developmiient of our problem. We would require in the first place a more penetrating psychological analysis of the desire and volition which these thinkers alike refer to as ultimate realities, and in the second place an uplevelling of the relation in which the voluntary self stands to its spiritual world. This latter uplift we get in Kant's defence of the practical reason, accompaniied as it is with the implied conviction that it is more important that the spiritual world should be moral than that it should be intelligible. But the opportunity of supplying the former desideratum through the First Critique Kant deliberately threw away. Holding as he did that empirical psychology no less than physics was conversant with phenomena only, since sense-intuition was the only ascertainable form of immediacy whether in inner or outer experience, his repudiation of Rational Psychology left no opening for a more living psycholocry that should concern itself with experienced realities. Maine de Biran also repudiated Rational Psychology with its doctrine of soul as a substance, but he did so only to fall back on a psychology of the self as a free first cause. Hence it is de Biran and not Kant wlho inaugurates the New Psychology, the psychology whose analyses of volition and desire elucidate the very experience of moral power issuino in a moral order</page><page sequence="33">THE EXPERIENCE OF POWER. 97 which, in its formal though essential aspect, is revealed to us by Kant in the Critique of the Practical Reason. We pass on then to consider, with a brevity ill-matched to the richness of the material, the meaning and value of the later developments of this New Psychology, and we beg leave for this purpose, and under limitations which the need for brevity imposes upon us, to take up for consideration the well-known work of Professor Stout. What meaning and valuie does Professor Stouit put upon the experience of power and necessary connexion ? We shall, I think, be in a better position for answering this question if we start by asking another: What is Professor Stout's attitude in regard to Hume's fundamental view con- cerning the relation of idea to impression ? Moreover, in considering a question of this kind, it is essential to distinguish between a merely proximate attitude, on the one hand, and a fundamiental attitude on the other. The proximate attitude is bound to be largely critical, for it would be strange indeed if the units of flume's philosophical thinking could pass, without change, into the foundations of any modern system. But where the proximate attitude is critical and indeed subversive, the fundamental attitude may still be radically sympathetic. Professor Stout's fundamental attitude towards Hume's view seems to me to be radically sympathetic. He sees that if an idea is to be a living thing, it must have its roots in an "impression," in something felt or experienced,* and that if an idea is to be convincing we must, as Hume says, be able to fix the " impression " out of which it has grown. It is not easy to estimate the importance of this funda- mental agreement of attitude between Hume and Stout, without first distinguishing, between two forms of immediacy- sense and self-feeling-which, for all the purposes of his * I neglect here the etymological significance of the "impression" as something stamped from without on our plastic sensibility. But so does Hume. G</page><page sequence="34">98 BOYCE GIBSON. criticism, lHume fuses together under the single name "impression." If self-feeling is no more than an inner sense, or even if the feeling of desire stands on the same level of immediacy as the sensation of hardness, then agreement with Hume's fundamental dictum that ideas are derived from impressions can only lanld us in a scepticismn of the reason, in a belief that reason is not only the slave of sense but its mere beggarly element. Yet even de Tracy, of the school of Condillac, saw through the fallacy of identifying the immediacy of felt desire with the immediacy of sense, for he realised not only that the feeling-immediacy was more fundamental, but also that it was in the baulking of the one immediacy through the other that we first became conscious of the existence of an external world. flune's confusion of the two immediacies left a double problem to his successors, that of liberating the reason from its enslavement to sense, and that of providing, for the liberated reason an impressional origin suited to its peculiar dignity. Kant was so absorbed in the work of liberation, and in the process committed himself so hopelessly to the abstractions of an epistemological method, that he was disabled from determining the new immediacy in any other form than that of a Categorical Imperative whose fiat had no intelligible and no experienceable connexion with the life of inner feeling and desire. No one-unless it be Hegel or Stout himself* has insisted more than Kant did on the indissoluble bond between mediacy and immediacy. Concept severed from intuition is as powerless as intuition severed from concept. Kant's liberation of the reason was in no way intended as a * Cf. especially Prof. Stout's fundamental article on " Immediacy, Mediacy, and Coherence " (ifind, January, 1908), but note also the article on " Primary and Secondary Qualities," in Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, 1903-4, p. 159, the address on " Things and Sensations" (Proceedings of the British Academy, Vol. II, pp. 8 sq.), and the " Reply to Mr. Joseph" (Mind, January, 1911, pp. 3-5).</page><page sequence="35">THE EXPERIENCE OF POWER. 99 functional severance from sense, but only as a severance of origin. The category, though not derived from the sensory impression, cannot work apart from it.* Kant's insistence on this indispensable co-operation of concept and impression is doubtless one of his outstanding merits. But meanwhile the concept, though not precisely " shot out of a pistol," is consigned to the transcendental unity of apperceptioni as its new guardian, and so passes out of the serfdom of sense into the service of a logical principle. Now it is characteristic of Professor Stout's defence of the reason that it does adequate justice to both aspects of the problemi of immediacy. It gives to thought the immediacy of sense to feed upon, but it also leaves to thought a spiritual immediacy of its own, an immediacy out of which it originates. Nor is this spiritual immediacy to be confused with any mere intellectual intuition-such as the intuition of a possibility or a universal-for this could do no more thanl give thought a new object: it could not give it the vitality from within, the experience of power and of direct inward contact with the riches and novelties of the universe. It is in this latter and deeper sense of the relation between mediacy and immediacy that Professor Stout supplies a new rendering of Hume's principle without in any way surrendering it. And in so far as he does so he reveals his essential sympathy with the pragmatic outlook.t For the view that knowledge is rooted in a certain cognate immediate experience, that ideas spring from a vital basis of kindred feeling and * We should remember, of course, that it is only in reference to scientific knowledge that Kant insists on this direct intimacy between concept and intuition. The category and the sense-intuition (inner or outer) are both essential to a judgment of experience, but the category has no part in a judgment of perception. Moreover, as Kant's theory of the regulative Idea shows clearly, we can "think" without the direct co-operation of sense, though we cannot "know": i.e., know in the systematic sense of scientific knowledge. t Vide Prof. Stout's critical notice of F.

In the case of Pragmatisnm, the " impression" tends to be identified with the nexus of purposive needs which seeks for its complex satisfaction a correspondingly complex world of values, and recent psychological research has shown how these fundamental needs of our nature take the form of emotional instincts, of primaewal conative tendencies, the driving power of life residing in these instinctive propenlsities. But if we are to find the impulse which gives birth and direction to the philo- sophical idea, and is the mother of all the philosophical systems we must look to what we would call the " higher" instincts, " higher " in the sense that their need is not to satisfy the bodily but the ideal self, the self whose dominating values are not meat and drink, pleasure and fame, but truth, beauty and goodness. The experience of power is in last resort the experience of the power of these ideals in the shaping and perfecting of life, with all that such experience implies for the spiritual consciousness; and since it is the ideal which is the constitutive principle of spiritual life, we would add that the experience of power is in last resort the experience of the power of the instinct of spiritual self-preservation. Of all the profounder implications of this conviction there is one which is peculiarly central and of special importance for our purpose: I refer t6 the experience of freedom. It is this experienice which is central for de Biran, to whom the. last vision of reality is that of the self as self-consciously a free cause. Professor Stout, as we know, idenitifies freedom with self-determination, quite irrefutably, of course, provided that by the "self" we really do mean the self and not some spurious substitute, and by determination, fr-ee determinationi. What then are the conditions of free determination, the conditions which render it intelligible, and how does Professor Stout conceive them ? The question is crucial in regard both to the experience of</page><page sequence="37">THE EXPERIENCE OF POWER. 101 power and its relation to necessary coninexion. I can barely do more, however, than point out the immnense services which, in my opinion, Professor Stout has rendered to the philosophy of this subject, not only by his theory of conation but by his theory of volitioni as well. In his theory of an "intrinsic" connexion between endeavour and its fulfilment, a connexion which qud intrinsic proves to be teleological, and, as such, capable of being known and studied a pr-iori, i.e., indepen- dently of all the circumstance with which the progress of the conative quest may be invested, we have, as I take it, a view which most happily reflects the vision or " impression " whence the idea of "necessary connexion" has originated; and the masterly analyses of the ideas of " tendenicy" and " possibility" with which Professor Stout has strengthened his conative theory are, in my opinion, of the very greatest value. Further, Professor Stout's clear distinction between volition and conation, based on the presence of self-determination in the former under the distinctive aspects of deliberate choice and resolute decision, is surely the indispensable preliminary to setting the freedom of self-determination in its right relations to the intrinsic or necessary connexions through whose mieans free agency realises its chosen ends. From this point of view, necessary connexion becomes the medium through which the power of free agency reveals itself. Power, far from beino identifiable with necessary connexion, subsists in relative independence of it. It is independent of it in a sense analoaous to that in which the ideal is independent of the actual, or the distinctively humiian of the distinctively aniimal. Hume, as is well known, regards liberty as a form of necessity, and therefore as in no sense opposed to necessity but only to constraint. The solution is illusory, for on Hume's own showing we can give no reasonied defence of our belief in necessity, neither can we give any reasoned defence of the specific form of necessity which we call liberty. On liberty as on necessity generally custom is Hume's last word, and his</page><page sequence="38">102 BOYCE GIBSON. " reconciling project " ainounts to no more than a confession that custom does not necessarily imiply constraint. But if by necessary connexion we mean the intrinsic connexion of teleological necessity, and by freedom we mean something other than necessity, we are able to suggest a reconciling project which is not illusory. The teleological necessity is the connexion which gives coherency to a conation, but within the volitional situation, and in respect of the activities of deliberation, choice, and decision, the conation assumes the status of a real possibility; it is just a possible motive of choice which becomes actual only on being adopted. So far, then, necessity appears in its true hypothetical nature as a function and dependency of possibility. But possibility in its turn is a function of freedom, anid is real only in relation to deliberation, choice, and decision; it is only in relation to free choice that possibilities are real. Free volition, then, though it inay be teleological, profoundly so, cannot be a teleological necessity. Necessity is at root a characteristic of conation as such. In relation to volition conation is just a real possibility of action. Therefore in relation to volition, necessity is a futnction of possibility and only indirectly, and through the mediuimi of free agency, a function of actuality. Once the inducing motive is adopted and enters integrally into the volitional life as the idea that animates and guides our resolution, there is a new connexion, a connexion between resolution and its fulfilment, a connexion not of necessity but of freedom. There is in any case the "fiat "-it shall be fulfilled; and this element, the libertarian, though it does not interpret the depths of our freedom, is yet an indispensable factor in the (logical) transition from necessity or must-ness to what we know as obligation. But the " shall " finds its true interpretation only in the " should " of spiritual obligation. With this " should " or " should not," we have, as I take it, the ultimate connexion between resolution and its fulfilment, the spiritual connexion of freedom.</page><page sequence="39">THE EXPERIENCE OF POWER. 103 We may therefore sum up by concluding that the intrinsic necessity within the conation, the status of real possibility to which the conation itself is reduced when brought within the orbit of the volitional situation, the fiat of virtual freedom, the imlerative of spiritual obligation, are the stages through which niecessity is transceinded, and reconciled to freedom through being subdued to the service of spiritual oblig,ation. Necessity is reconciled to freedom only by being subordinated to it, and the persistent victory of freedom over fate is the full experience of power. [NOTE.-With regard to Dr. F. C. S. Schiller's discussion of Hume's treatment of power in his article on "Humism and Humanism" (Proc. Arist. Soc., 1906-7), the relevant point, as Dr. Schiller has explained to me in a private letter from which I am permitted to quote, was this: " Hume began by attacking the current philosophic notion of causation ('necessary connexion') in the Treatise, and had no difficulty in making hay of it. It then occurred to him, or was pointed out to him, that behind that notion lay the common-sense notion of power, which rested, to all appearance, on a definite 'impression,' and so invalidated his criticism of 'necessary connexion,' even as the facts of 'self-consciousness' defied is analysis of the 'self.' In both cases Hume meets the difficulty very cleverly in the Appendix to the Treatise. The problem of the Self he declares inexplicable and leaves aside henceforth (in which practically all philosophers have followed him). 'Power,' on the other hand, he anialyses as a special case of 'necessary connexion,' i.e., of a habitual sequence volition-motion. Then by the time he writes the lnquiry he expands his objection to an acceptance of the 'impression' of power by adding physiological and biological arguments to show that its testimony is illusory. (These again have been generally accepted.) The essential difference between the Treatise and the Inquiry is that whereas in the former he is only engaged in upsetting metaphysical dogmas, in the latter he is beginning to see that the really solid philosophy to upset (or to build on) is that of common-sense. Henlce, too, his growing preference for 'instinct' and 'feeling' as against the (philosophic) 'reason.' But he never shook himself clear of the erirors which are common to common- sense and philosophy, though he did see that the latter commonly aggravates them. Hence there is no answer to Hume until it is recog- nised that the whole traditional 'Frage-Stellung' on Causation is false, and that philosophy is worse than common-sense, in that its solution is practically worthless as well as theoretically illusory. The truth is that the causal problem is not primarily one of synthesis but one of anzalysis. I.e., how and why do we come to dissever the continuous flow of experience with causal chains ? What is the justification of this fiction, this</page><page sequence="40">104 THE EXPERIENCE OF POWER. seemingly arbitrary departure from the given? Common-sense does not question this analysis but supposes it done, and starts from such pragmatically useful analyses as have been worked out, and then the philosopher asks, 'but have you connected aright?' This is an ignoratio elenchi: the proper questionis for philosophy to put to common-sense were: ' Have you analysed aright, and how did you ever come to analyse at all?' So at present the whole philosophic ' criticism' is all a waste of labour. The case of the ' Self,'' Soul,' or 'Substance' is precisely similar. Philosophy has succeeded only in criticising a pragmatically serviceable notion into an absurdity, and fourld no answer to Hume's criticism of that absurdity."]</page></plain_text>
