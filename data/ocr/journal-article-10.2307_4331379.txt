STAMOS Graduate Studies, Philosophy York University North York, Ontario, M3J IP3 Canada When we turn to the writings of Charles Darwin, we enter the modem era (in more ways than one) - for it is undeniably true that, roughly speaking, his theory of evolution by natural selection is the dominant paradigm in evolu- tionary biology today. What is less obvious is that it is with Darwin that the modem species problem really begins. The interesting thing about this, of course, is that instead of attempting to solve the problem, or even just to point us the way, his writings have proved highly paradoxical, so that the question of his species concept is often overlooked and ignored. Unlike most authors on the modem species problem, however, I believe that a more than superficial look is worth the effort, and that a serious attempt to understand Darwin's real versus apparent species concept may shine new light on the ontology of species. Darwin, of course, did not begin his intellectual life as an evolutionist. In spite of having read his grandfather Erasmus's Zoonomia during his university years and having listened "in silent astonishment" to a university friend enthusiastically discuss the views of Lamarck, it all had, he tells us, no immediate effect on his mind.' Indeed, even throughout his voyage on the Beagle, completed in October 1836, he remained a theist and a creationist.2 Shortly thereafter, however (in March 1837), he reviewed impor- tant feedback from the omithologist John Gould, conceming in particular his mockingbird specimens from the Galapagos Islands,3 and in July 1837 he 1 From Darwin's autobiography, in Charles Darwin and Thomas Henry Huxley: Auto- biographies, ed.

STAMOS began his Transmutation Notebooks.4 In September 1838 he read Malthus.5 And in 1839 he could say that his theory "was clearly conceived."6 Nevertheless, what is evident throughout the period of the Transmutation Notebooks (from July 1837 to July 1839) is that Darwin continued to believe in the objective reality of species. In fact the species concept he held was based on the zoologically minded criterion of reproductive isolation.7 Such a concept, however, applies to species reality only at any one slice of time: in itself it need not presuppose evolution, as can be seen with Buffon. What, then, about species reality through time, in terms of evolution and descent? There is scarcely any clear evidence to help us determine what Darwin thought on this matter.8 However, I have discovered a piece of evidence that appears to suggest that Darwin at this time thought that the relation of common or shared descent still gives grounds for species reality contra species nominalism. First, we must turn to a classic passage on species nominalism found in John Locke's Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1700): This, then, in short, is the case: Nature makes many particular Things, which do agree with one another, in many sensible Qualities, and prob- ably too, in their internal frame and Constitution: but 'tis not this real Essence that distinguishes them into Species; 'tis Men, who, taking occa- sion from the Qualities they find united in them, and wherein, they observe often several individuals to agree, range them into Sorts, in order to their naming, for the convenience of comprehensive signs; under which indi- viduals, according to their conformity to this or that abstract Idea, come to be ranked as under Ensigns: so that this is of the Blue, that the Red Regiment; this is a Man, that a Drill [baboon]: And in this, I think, consists the whole business of Genus and Species.9 Now consider an interesting passage to be found in one of Darwin's notebooks: Origin of man now proved. - Metaphysic must flourish. - He who understands baboon would do more towards metaphysics than Locke.10 4Darwin, autobiography (above, n. 1), p. 48. 5 See Notebook D, in Charles Darwin's Notebooks, 1836-1844, eds.

" Yet it seems to me that the above correspondence is too great to be dismissed as coinci- dental. Darwin scholars typically interpret this note of Darwin's as a reference to the metaphysics of mind. According to Sandra Herbert and Paul Barrett, for example, "Darwin believed the similarity of expressions in other animals to man strengthened, even 'proved,' the transmutationist case."'12 Of course, Notebook M (along with N) was explicitly devoted to, and contains much in the way of speculation on, expressions and the evolution of mind, and Darwin was notorious for ascribing in an anthropomorphic style human thoughts and emotions to animals.'3 However, if I am right, then Darwin, in the passage above, is not (or is not only) referring to the metaphysics of mind, but to ontology. His claim, I suggest, is that, given evolution, not only must Locke's ontology be expanded to include biological species in an extramental sense, but these species are themselves the very units of evolution. Indeed, it is interesting to note that Darwin in his notebooks thought that the baboon is a living ancestor of mankind.'4 That Darwin's mind on the day he wrote the note quoted above (August 16, 1838) was focused on the issue of the ontology of species (particularly over time, as evolutionary units) is evidenced by a note written on the very same day but placed in Notebook D. Discussing changes in geography and corresponding changes in adaptation in the organic world, Darwin wrote that the view of "the world peopled with Myriads of distinct forms from a period short of eternity to the present time, to the future ... [is] far grander than idea from cramped imagination that God created. (warring against those very laws he established in all organic nature) the Rhinoceros of Java &amp; Sumatra."''5 At any rate, when we turn to Darwin's Origin the situation changes dramat- ically. Indeed as Ernst Mayr put it, "When one goes to the Origin of 1859 and reads what it says about species, one cannot help but feel that one is dealing 11 Antony Flew, Darwinian Evolution (London: Paladin, 1984), pp. 46-47. But see Adrian Desmond and James Moore, Darwin: The Life of a Tormented Evolutionist (New York: W. W. Norton, 1994): according to Desmond and Moore (pp. 87-88), among the works that Darwin was examined on in his final examination at Cambridge (January 1831) was Locke's Essay. '2Sandra Herbert and Paul H. Barrett, "Introduction to Notebook M," in Barrett et al., Darwin's Notebooks (above, n. 5), p. 518. 1' Unlike Descartes and many others, Locke, in subscribing to the Great Chain of Being, did much the same as Darwin (see Essay [above, n. 9], IV.xvi.12). Nevertheless, he denied that animals below man have the power of abstract thought, and he affirmed that this "puts a perfect distinction betwixt Man and Brutes" (Il.xi.1O). 14Cf.

STAMOS with an altogether different author."'6 In the Origin many passages could be cited in support, but the following two are among the most often quoted: From these remarks it will be seen that I look at the term species, as one arbitrarily given for the sake of convenience to a set of individuals closely resembling each other, and that it does not essentially differ from the term variety, which is given to less distinct and more fluctuating forms. The term variety, again, in comparison with mere individual differences, is also applied arbitrarily, and for mere convenience sake.'7 In short, we shall have to treat species in the same manner as those natural- ists treat genera, who admit that genera are merely artificial combinations made for convenience. This may not be a cheering prospect; but we shall at least be freed from the vain search for the undiscovered and undiscov- erable essence of the term species. (p. 485) It is interesting to note that Darwin in the second of these two passages seems clearly to share with Locke (and many others) the inference that if species do not have essences (cf. pp. 45 and 484), then they must not be real. Of course, little need be said about the fallaciousness of this reasoning. (Species may be real without strict essences by being cluster classes, inhabitants of ecological niches, spatiotemporally localized individuals, or - my own view - internal relation complexes.) Whether Darwin actually held the above fallacy will be discussed shortly. What is also of interest is that it is still held today, at least among some philosophers. According to David B. Kitts and David J. Kitts, for example, "To suppose otherwise [i.e., to suppose that there are no conspecific essences] is not to give reason to change our view of species, but to give reason to abandon the concept of species altogether. Biologists search for the underlying trait which explains the necessary relationship between an organism and its species in the genetic structure of the organism."''8 Because of the two passages quoted above from Darwin's Origin, and many more19 - many of which are reminiscent of Locke simply in their use of the words "arbitrarily" and "convenience" - many biologists and many philosophers of biology have taken Darwin to mean literally that species are not objectively real, that they are real in name only (species nominalism).20 16 Mayr, Growth of Biological Thought (above, n. 7), p. 266. 17 Charles Darwin, On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, I st ed. p. 52.

Indeed, this was immediately felt subsequent to the publication of the Origin. For example, Louis Agassiz, in spite of his irrational holdout against Darwin, wrote in 1860: "If species do not exist at all, as the supporters of the transmutation theory maintain, how can they vary?"'21 Recently Elliott Sober has suggested that Darwin's masterpiece would be better titled On the Unreality of Species as Shown by Natural Selection.22 I think this reading of Darwin is not only paradoxical but wrong. But before presenting my case, I want to briefly examine two theories on why Darwin would write what he wrote above. Mayr, like many others, does not doubt the sincerity of those passages and accepts them at face value. Drawing mainly on Darwin's correspondence during the 1840s and (especially) the 1850s, Mayr surmises that Darwin's species nominalism resulted mainly from his friendships with botanists during that period and from the botanical literature, much of which was negative in regard to the reality of species.23 For my part, I find this theory difficult to accept. It seems to me that Mayr here is merely taking his own difficulties with botanists in regard to his own criterion of reproductive isolation and projecting that difficulty back in time, by blaming botanists contemporary with Darwin for a negative influence on Darwin. I think this will not wash, for the simple reason that Darwin himself tells us (as we shall see) that virtually all of his professional contemporaries were species realists. Mayr's additional theory is that in denying the reality of species Darwin was employing a clever strategy. Since the creationists were maintaining that species are distinct and immutable, and since Darwin in the Origin wanted to prove that species may change indefinitely, he wisely denied the reality of species and employed for the sake of convenience (as we shall also see) only a morphological concept based solely on degree of difference. In employing a purely arbitrary criterion - arbitrary because it provides no objective criteria for a distinction between species and varieties, on the one hand, and between species and higher taxa, on the other hand - he could deny the objective Evolution (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1970), p. 13; Jonathan Howard, Darwin (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1982), pp. 17, 37; Niles Eldredge, Time Frames (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1989), pp. 109-110; Paul Thompson, The Structure of Biological Theories (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1989), p. 8; and Marc Ereshefsky, ed., The Units of Evolution (Cambridge: MIT Press, 1992), p. 190. 21 Quoted in John Beatty, "Speaking of Species: Darwin's Strategy," in The Darwinian Heritage, ed.

"When species are thus conceived, the origin of new species is not an insurmountable problem."24 The problem with this theory is that it would seem to entail that species on Darwin's view are in some sense objectively real. But that contradicts Mayr's reading of the Origin and what he says about the influence of botanists. Thus, Mayr contradicts Mayr. A more plausible version of the strategy theory is provided by John Beatty, who points out that Darwin makes it clear that the Origin was addressed to the community of professional naturalists of which Darwin himself was a member. Within that community, the term "species" was heavily theory- laden, so much so that it precluded evolution. Thus, to speak of species as evolving was a contradiction in terms. According to Beatty, He tried to get around this difficulty by distinguishing between what his fellow naturalists called "species" and the non-evolutionary beliefs in terms of which they defined "species." Regardless of their definitions, he argued, what they called "species" evolved. His species concept was therefore interestingly minimal: species were, for Darwin, just what expert naturalists called "species." By trying to talk about the same things that his contemporaries were talking about, he hoped that his language would conform satisfactorily enough for him to communicate his position to them325 In adopting a nominalistic concept of species, Darwin could bypass their theory-laden definitions while at the same time, in retaining their use of the tern "species," he could provide evidence to effect a reinterpretation of the referents of that term. Thus, according to Beatty, Darwin only seemed to deny the reality of species.26 A clever strategy indeed. What most strengthens Beatty's theory is that he finds the presuppositions that underlie it explicitly discussed in the work of the British botanist Hewett Cottrell Watson, whose writings Darwin was well aware of.27 Not only did Watson discuss the difficulties in changing the meaning of an entrenched theory-laden term, but he also made clear the distinction between the definitional use of the term "species" and its referential use, and even suggested that the way to effect theory change is to deny the theory-laden definitional use while maintaining the referential use. In fact, that is precisely what Watson did in communicating the result of his experiments on the commmon descent of cowslips and primroses, two commonly regarded species that Darwin, interestingly, made much of in the 24 Ibid., p. 269. 2 Beatty, "Speaking of Species" (above, n. 21), p. 266. 26Ibid., p. 270-. 27 Ibid. pp. 271-274.</page><page sequence="7">WAS DARWIN REALLY A SPECIES NOMINALISP? 133 Origin.28 On Beatty's theory, then, Darwin found in Watson not only a clear discussion of the difficulties he faced in effecting so radical a paradigm shift, but also a plausible strategy for effecting that shift. Although Beatty's theory is well thought out and argued, and may indeed best correspond to history, I find it difficult to accept for at least two reasons. First, it seems to me upon reading the Origin that Darwin intended it for a much wider audience than the community of professional naturalists of which he himself was a part. Not only is it written with exceptional clarity and relative simplicity, but Darwin defines terms whose definition would be entirely superfluous for an audience as narrow as Beatty maintains. For example, on page 390 Darwin defines what an endemic species is - something even a rank amateur would not need done for him. But more importantly, Beatty himself draws the consequence that if his theory is right, it means that Darwin, in his denials that the term "species" can be defined, denied the reality of the species category, not the reality of species taxa. Though the latter too are for Darwin indefinable, they are nevertheless real, and for Darwin what naturalists call species are really "chunks with[in] the genealogical nexus of life."29 This, says Beatty, the "suggestion that natural history could really get by without definitions of the categories of classification - especially a definition of 'species' - is admittedly hard to swallow."30 Never mind, as Beatty goes on to point out, that subsequent evolutionists have since replaced (though their replacements are many) Darwin's nominal- istic definition of the species category with real definitions, and that Darwin should be seen today as a sort of liberation biologist (in analogy to modem theology). If Beatty is right, it means that Darwin was fundamentally con- fused and had in mind nothing like a distinction between species taxa and the species category - a distinction that is necessary if one is not to implicate oneself in a fundamental confusion. (No species category, no species taxa.) It seems to me that the principle of charity requires us here to back up a bit and pursue another trail. It is important, of course, not to read Darwin as one would read a modem biologist today, but to read him (as one might read, say, David Hume on natural religion) in the context of his time. In order to do this properly, we must be clear on the predominant species concept shared especially by Darwin's professional contemporaries - interestingly, Darwin himself, in the Origin, provides us with just about all that we really need to know on this. Indeed, it is almost as if he foresaw that the paradigm he sought to overthrow would quickly be forgotten. At any rate, I believe that 28 See Darwin, Origin, pp. 49-50, 247, 268, 424, 485. 29 Beatty, "Speaking of Species" (above, n. 21), p. 278. 30 Ibid., p. 280.</page><page sequence="8">134 DAVID N. STAMOS the dominant species concept of Darwin's day can be divided among seven points (at least for our purposes): (1) Species are the product of divine creation and are immutable. Interest- ingly, it was this aspect of their divine creation that constituted their reality: "Several eminent naturalists have of late published their belief that a multitude of reputed species in each genus are not real species; but that other species are real, that is, have been independently created" (p. 482). The unreal species lead us to the second point: (2) Although species are immutable, this only means that they cannot change into other species, not that natural (secondary) causes (laws) cannot cause them to vary and produce varieties (subspecies, races, etc.). Thus, varieties are the limits of species variability. "Generally the term ['species'] includes the unknown element of a distinct act of creation. The term 'variety' is almost equally difficult to define; but here community of descent is almost universally implied, though it can rarely be proved" (p. 44). Again: "species, commonly supposed to have been produced by special acts of creation, and varieties which are acknowledged to have been produced by secondary laws" (p. 469). Finally: "It has often been asserted, but the assertion is quite inca- pable of proof, that the amount of variation under nature is a strictly limited quantity" (p. 468). (3) Varieties are not objectively real. Although this is not clearly brought out by Darwin, it is important to point out that for the majority of naturalists in Darwin's day (and for many today, though for somewhat different reasons) both the rank variety and the groups commonly ranked as varieties were thought to be ultimately arbitrary and unreal, since they both lacked essences and were not specially created, being merely convenient groupings based on accidental (nonessential) variations of conspecific individuals.31 (4) Each species has a species-specific essence that can be captured in a definition. This, of course, was Aristotle's view, at least in his logical works.32 Although it was common in Darwin's day, there is no precise passage in the Origin where Darwin brings this out. However, it is presupposed, as we shall see, when he gives his own alternative view. (5) An inherent quality and special endowment of species is that they are intersterile. "The view generally entertained by naturalists is that species, when intercrossed, have been specially endowed with the quality of sterility, in order to prevent the confusion of all organic forms" (p. 245). 3' See, for example, Mayr, Growth of Biological Thought (above, n. 7), pp. 288-289, 640- 641,741. 32 See Aristotle, Topics 101 b35.</page><page sequence="9">WAS DARWIN REALLY A SPECIES NOMINALIST? 135 (6) Varieties of species do not have the above quality but are interfertile. "A supposed variety if infertile [intersterile] in any degree would generally be ranked as species" (p. 271). (7) Higher taxa are not divinely created but are manmade and arbitrary. Although this was not as commonly held as points one to six, Darwin tells us that many naturalists "admit that genera are merely artificial combinations made for convenience" (p. 485). Before we examine Darwin's reply to each of these points, we must recog- nize that (in his eyes, anyway) prior to the publication of the Origin, evolution was not in some sense "in the air," but that virtually all naturalists subscribed quite strongly to at least the first six of the above seven points.33 Now for Darwin's replies: (1) For Darwin, the theory that species were divinely created by miracle made very little sense of the evidence from biology and geology. The evidence from geology, as Lyell had concluded, bespoke an extremely old earth, and one that was not static: its terrestrial environments were constantly (and, for the most part, very slowly), changing (pp. 282-283). Species must be adapted to their environments if they are to survive, and therefore they must change with their environments. Moreover, the theory of divine creation made little or no sense of immediately observable phenomena, such as vestigial organs (pp. 199-200), adaptive radiations (pp. 397-398) and other anomalies of geographic distribution (p. 394), embryological evidence (p. 449), and the evidence of the fossil record (pp. 333, 465). (2) The idea that species may vary only to a certain degree (varieties) but not indefinitely had, for Darwin, no basis in fact or logic (p. 469). For this conclusion he employed the evidence that may be garnered from breeders, what he called "the best and safest clue," remarking further that it is "very commonly neglected by naturalists" (p. 4). If breeders making selections on individual variations could effect such remarkable changes over only a few centuries, how much more could natural selection from a changing environment accomplish over vast periods of time? As Darwin himself put it, "What limit can be put to this power, acting during long ages and rigidly scrutinising the whole constitution, structure, and habits of each creature, - favouring the good and rejecting the bad?" (p. 469). (3) Rather than risk having his whole argument dismissed offhand by arguing for the very difficult conclusion that varieties are objectively real, a conclusion precluded on commonly accepted criteria, Darwin simply con- ceded for the sake of argument that "the term variety, ... in comparison with mere individual differences, is ... applied arbitrarily, and for mere conve- nience sake" (p. 52). 33 See Darwin, Origin, p. 310, and autobiography (above, n. 1), pp. 73-74.</page><page sequence="10">136 DAVID N. STAMOS (4) If species change and gradually evolve into other species, and if selection operates on favorable variations of conspecific individuals, it follows that any characteristic thought essential to a species need not be found in all of its member organisms, and that even if one characteristic is so found, it is only accidentally so, and not necessarily so. This conclusion is evident throughout Darwin's writings, as in the following passage: "if every form which has ever lived on this earth were suddenly to reappear, . . . it would be quite impossible to give definitions by which each group could be distinguished from other groups, as all would blend together by steps as fine as those between the finest existing varieties" (p. 432). Again: "the points in which species differ from other species of the same genus, are called specific characters; and as these specific characters have varied and come to differ within the period of the branching off of the species from a common progenitor, it is probable that they should still often be in some degree variable" (p. 156; cf. p. 45). And yet again: "community of descent is the natural bond which naturalists have been seeking, and not some unknown plan of creation, or the enunciation of general propositions" (p. 420). (5) In studying the observations and experiments of zoologists and botanists, Darwin came to the empirical conclusion that (a) while, on the one hand, it is a fact that "hybrids [when they do occur] are very generally sterile" (p. 245), (b) it is also a fact that when there is fertility between species, when all these species are considered together, the fertility grades insensibly from slightly above zero to 100 percent (Chap. 8). His conclusion, then, is that sterility between species can be considered neither a "specially endowed quality" (p. 261) nor a "universal law of nature" (p. 250). Since "the sterility of hybrids could not possibly be of any advantage to them" (p. 245), it could not be something that could be selected for by nature. (Natural selection, according to Darwin, operates principally only for the good of the individual, though sometimes also for groups; cf. pp. 200-202.) Sterility, therefore, must be "incidental on other acquired differences" (p. 245) - and if incidental, it cannot be part of what a species is. (6) If species are to evolve, and if evolution must be quite slow and gradual, it follows that varieties must not be the limits of mutability but must instead be what Darwin called them, namely "incipient species" (p. 52). It was extremely important, then, for Darwin to prove that there is no fundamental distinction between species and varieties, which was contrary to what almost all other naturalists supposed. And once again, to support his conclusion he appealed to the evidence and controversies supplied by professional biologists them- selves. Admitting "the almost universal fertility of [conspecific] varieties when crossed" (p. 460), it can nevertheless "be shown that neither sterility nor fertility affords any clear distinction between species and varieties; but</page><page sequence="11">WAS DARWIN REALLY A SPECIES NOMINALIST? 137 that the evidence from this source graduates away, and is doubtful in the same degree as is the evidence derived from other constitutional and struc- tural differences" (p. 248). Consequently, "I do not think that the very general fertility of varieties can be proved to be of universal occurrence, or to form a fundamental distinction between varieties and species .. . it is not a special endowment, but is incidental on slowly acquired modifications, more espe- cially in the reproductive systems of the formns which are crossed" (pp. 271- 272). (7) Although many naturalists thought that higher taxa were arbitrary and unreal, others did not, but to Darwin the criteria of these realists made their categories appear "almost arbitrary" (p. 419). On the other hand, he believed that "all true classification is genealogical" and that "community of descent is the hidden bond which naturalists have been unconsciously seeking" (p. 420). What should be apparent is that point six immediately above is the most important and pivotal point in what Darwin himself described as "one long argument" (p. 459): it is a sort of Archimedean fulcrum, with which he would indeed move the world. What needs to be kept in mind, however, is that in the various passages where he overtly denies the reality of species, the context of his discussion is invariably the issue of whether there is a fundamental and universal distinction between species and varieties.34 This is a crucial point, completely missed by Mayr and insufficiently explored by Beatty. Darwin's strategy against his fellow naturalists, it seems to me, turns out to be, and is best described as, a sort of consistency argument. "He includes monsters; he includes varieties, not solely because they resemble the parent- form, but because they are descended from it. He who believes that the cowslip is descended from the primrose, or conversely, ranks them together as a single species, and gives a single definition" (p. 424). In denying the reality of species, Darwin was not just trying to better communicate his own theory of evolution. Rather, he was perfecting his own consistency argument: (P1:) If you employ common descent in ranking varieties and monsters and males and females and larvae and adults as conspecific, in spite of often great dissimilarity (cf. p. 425), (P2:) if you believe that varieties are not real because they are created by natural mechanisms rather than divine fiat, (P3:) if you have no good reason to believe that what are called varieties are the limits of mutability, but instead you have very good reasons to believe that they are indefinitely mutable, then (C:) you must as a matter of consistency conclude that what are called varieties are incipient species and that what are called species are indefinitely mutable. Corrollary: You must, then, conclude not only that varieties are not real but that species are not real either! 34 See Darwin, Origin, pp. 44, 47, 49,51-52, 248, 268, 484-485.</page><page sequence="12">138 DAVID N. STAMOS Now that is really clever. And that I think was Darwin's strategy. But what then did he really think about species? To answer that question is to jump onto center stage of the modem species debate. For we find in Darwin a distinction that has often been employed in modem writings, though often without credit to Darwin, a distinction without which the question of the reality or unreality of species must remain utterly ambiguous - namely, the distinction between vertical species and horizontal species.35 To be a true species nominalist, one must deny the reality of both. On the other hand, if one accepts either one as a real category (with members), one must then be a species realist.36 What is the difference between a vertical and a horizontal species? The distinction borrows from the now entrenched metaphor of the tree of life. Horizontal species are the species that result from cutting through the tree horizontally at any one level. Horizontal species, then, are the species that exist at any one time. By "any one time" no one who ever discusses horizontal species means a single instant or a microsecond; rather, what is meant is a period of time. This might sound arbitrary, and to some extent it is, but what is almost always meant is a period of time less than that required for gradual speciation. For my own part, the minimum time required would be the period that is necessary for the relations to obtain that define species, and the max- imum time allowable would be the period that still allows for the species relation to be transitive (i.e., if organism a is conspecific with organism b and organism b is conspecific with organism c, then a and c must also be conspe- cific). Mayr's biological species concept, for example, is admittedly a purely horizontal concept, which he also describes as a nondimensional concept: "The biological species concept, expressing a relation among populations, is meaningful and truly applicable only in the nondimensional situation. It can be extended to multidimensional situations only by inference."37 Although I 35 See, for example, George Gaylord Simpson, Principles of Animal Taxonomy (New York: Columbia University Press, 1961), p. 129, and Emst Mayr, Toward a New Philosophy of Biology (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1988), pp. 187, 314. 36 Horizontal species, of course, are ontologically prior to vertical species. If vertical species are real, then so must horizontal species be real. But if vertical species are not real, that does not mean that horizontal species are not real (any more than in the case of evolving languages). Horizontal species may be real without being vertically real. But clearly if horizontal species are not real, then neither are vertical species. To affirm the unreality of biological species taxa, then, although one must affirm the unreality of both vertical and horizontal species taxa, the issue comes down to whether horizontal species taxa are real. 37 Mayr, Growth of Biological Thought (above, n. 7), p. 273. It should be noted that by "multidimensional" Mayr is referring to populations compared at different times and different places. Whether members from two different populations completely separated in either space or time, or in both, can furtively interbreed can never be deternined by observation but can only be inferred. Such inferences result in a multidimensional species concept. Since horizontal species refer to conspecific populations that may be separated geographically but not temporally, Mayr's nondimensionallmultidimensional distinction, contraly to what he thinks</page><page sequence="13">WAS DARWIN REALLY A SPECIES NOMINALIST? 139 will not go so far as to agree with Mayr that multidimensional species are "in most cases biologically uninteresting, if not altogether irrelevant,"38 it is clear that horizontal species play the dominant role in biology today: in the study of population genetics, in the study of biodiversity, including food chains and food webs, and in biological control. Turning to vertical species, they are, of course, species looked at vertically, employing the full dimension of time. For species to exist vertically, we must be able to say (if only roughly) when they began and when they came to an end. To return to the metaphor of the tree of life, a vertical species would be a branch of some sort. There is, of course, a degree of arbitrariness here as well. Shall any twig, for example, be a species, or may twigs be conspecific? Since species produce varieties, there must be twigs, but when do we count them as species? Or in other words, what kinds of branching points are to count as speciation events? Moreover, what about nonbranching speciation, such as the Homo line? Although vertical species seem to be more problematic than horizontal species, it must be kept in mind that whatever the problems are, they do not affect the reality or unreality of horizontal species. To illustrate this, we need only borrow and expand upon what proves to be one of Darwin's most appropriate analogies, namely his language analogy:39 English, for example, is no less real if it should prove impossible to say when it began, and it would be no less real if in the future it should prove impossible to say when it came to an end. Now what about Darwin? I do not think it can be doubted that he was a species realist in regard to horizontal species. He says, for example, "To sum up, I believe that species come to be tolerably well-defined objects, and do not at any one period present an inextricable chaos of varying and intermediate links" (p. 177). Now certainly it is true that Darwin, in the Origin, employed an overtly morphological species concept, which may easily be thought arbitrary and subjective. He says, for example, that, as a consequence of his view, "Systematists will have only to decide (not that this will be easy) whether any forrn be sufficiently constant and distinct from other forms, to be capable of definition; and if definable, whether the differences be sufficiently important to deserve a specific name" (p. 484). Elsewhere he says that "varieties, when rendered very distinct from each other, take the rank of species" (p. 114). Again, he says: elsewhere (cf. Mayr, Toward a New Philosophy [above, n. 35], p. 314), does not perfectly correspond to the horizontal/vertical distinction. 38 Mayr, Growth of Biological Thought, p. 286. 39 See Darwin, Notebook N, p. 65, and Origin, pp. 422-423.</page><page sequence="14">140 DAVID N. STAMOS Hence, in determining whether a form should be ranked as a species or a variety, the opinion of naturalists having sound judgment and wide experience seems the only guide to follow. We must, however, in many cases, decide by a majority of naturalists, for few well-marked and well- known varieties can be named which have not been ranked as species by at least some competent judges. (p. 47) In the same manner Darwin often uses the phrase "good and distinct species" (see pp. 61 and 259), which should make it clear that when he speaks of '"well-defined" species (pp. 171, 174, as well as above), he is not thinking of definition in the Aristotelian sense but is instead merely referring to the fact that the distinctiveness as well as the status of such species qua species is clear and uncontroversial - a usage that has remained to the present day.40 All of this, of course, can be explained using some sort of strategy theory. But even without a strategy theory, it becomes obvious that Darwin was not a nominalist with regard to horizontal species (thinking that only individual organisms are real), since he provides objective criteria for the objective existence of horizontal species. One of these is the existence of sterility barriers. In spite of his evidence and arguments against the view that species are specially endowed with sterility barriers and that these are lacking between conspecific varieties, he admits (what he need only admit) "that this is almost invariably the case" (p. 268). It is the exceptions that make his case, which themselves prove that both interspecific sterility and intraspecific fertility "cannot, under our present state of knowledge, be considered as absolutely universal" (p. 254). It is the evidence that these two criteria are almost universal that allows Darwin to steer a course right down the middle between species nominalism and species essentialism; in other words, on the one hand it allows for species (for the most part) to be objectively real, while on the other hand it allows for the indefinite mutability of species - both of which are required for his theory. Incidentally, the above course is characterized in his injunction against a priori assumptions in favor of experiments: "No one can tell, till he tries" (p. 265). Interestingly, there is another relational criterion that Darwin gives for the objective reality of horizontal species. Instead of reproductive relations, this one has to do with competitive relations. According to Darwin, "the struggle almost invariably will be most severe between the individuals of the same species, for they frequent the same districts, require the same food, and are exposed to the same dangers" (p. 75). Of course, whether he is right about 40Cf. Emst Mayr and Lester L. Short, Species Taxa of North American Birds (Cambridge, Mass.: Nuttall Omithological Club, 1970), p. 1.</page><page sequence="15">WAS DARWIN REALLY A SPECIES NOMINALIST? 141 intraspecific competition is beside the point.4 What is important is that no true species nominalist would assent to it, since it provides an objective criterion for inclusive entities higher than that of the individual organism. Turning now to the matter of vertical species, Darwin's position in the Origin is not quite so clear. On the one hand, he clearly subscribed to and may even be said to have authored the historical version of the Great Chain of Being.42 He says, for instance, "looking not to any one time, but to all time, if my theory be true, numberless intermediate varieties, linking most closely all the species of the same group together, must assuredly have existed" (p. 179). Moreover, he thought of the history of life on earth as "the great Tree of Life" (p. 130), comprising "one long and branching chain of life" (p. 301) with "an infinitude of connecting links" (p. 463). Again, he often speaks of "the scale of nature"43 and often employs the Latin dictum "Natura non facit saltum."44 411 myself am skeptical, but am of course incompetent to pass judgment. I think of, for example, members of Pongo pygmaeus (orangutans), which in the wild live an almost exclu- sively solitary existence: it seems evident that their competition comes mainly from man and not from each other. But this may indeed be an exception. Darwin may be right as a rule - his "almost invariably." Against my view, it is almost a truism in ecology that species occupy niches, and that if two species occupy the same niche, one will eventually cause the extinction of the other, this is known as the competitive exclusion principle (or Gause's axiom). It would seem to follow that "niche differentiation should reduce competition between species relative to that within species" (R. Law and A. R. Watkinson, "Competition," in Ecological Concepts, ed. J. M. Cherrett [Oxford: Blackwell Scientific Publications, 1989], p. 273). However, as Law and Watkinson point out (pp. 275-276), there are almost no data to support this or any conclusion on the relative strengths of the two types of competition. 42 Of course, one might naturally credit Lamarck instead. Not only did he stress gradualness, but on his view all extinction is pseudo-extinction. He believed that any given species does not cease to exist by evolving into another species but continues to exist in that new form (cf. Mayr, Growth of Biological Thought [above, n. 7], p. 349). One consequence of this view is that it makes out of the tree of life one large phylogenetic continuum (Simpson, Principles of Animal Taxonomy [above, n. 35], p. 51) and consequently one big species. And from this one big species it is easy to conclude that there are no species (plural) in any conventional sense, that any method of chopping up the continuum is entirely arbitrary. And that was precisely Uamarck's view: like numerous species nominalists before him, but now for entirely new reasons, he found himself forced to conclude that only individual organisms are real, although he was later to recant (Mayr, Growth of Biological Thought, p. 264). However, unlike Darwin (cf. Origin, p. 484), Lamarck apparently did not hold a belief in common descent, the view that all life can be traced back to one or a few ancestors in the very remote past. And yet he did, in a sense, inaugurate the historical version of the Great Chain of Being, modifying the Great Chain into branches, with all lineages beginning at the most rudimentary level and evolving upward through levels of ever-increasing complexity, upward all the way to humans, who are still evolving. Combined with what was then the widespread belief in constant and rudimentary spontaneous generation - a view not shared by Darwin, who, like biologists today, thought that the favorable conditions for the origin of life were long distant in the past (Mayr, Growth of Biological Thought, pp. 582-583) - Lamarck's tree of life is perhaps better thought of as a homogeneous forest. 43 See Darwin, Origin, pp. 88, 168, 208, 313, 345, 388, 406, 468. 44 See ibid., pp. 194, 206, 210, 454, 460, 471.</page><page sequence="16">142 DAVID N. STAMOS Why would Darwin maintain this view? He was, of course, aware of mon- strosities (see p. 44). But what he was concerned to explain was evolution, and this for him had to be gradual rather than saltational. In sexual species (which constitute the majority of species), evolution by saltational jumps would seem highly unlikely. If the monstrosity were fertile (which most are not) but reproductively isolated from its parent species, it would require a suitable monstrosity of the opposite sex in order to breed; the result, however, would be an extremely small gene pool, subject to extreme inbreeding, and it would quickly die out (cf. pp. 248-249). On the other hand, if the monstrosity were interfertile with its parent species, the novel characteristics that con- ferred a selective advantage would have to gradually make their way through the gene pool, resulting in gradual rather than saltational evolution. Darwin apparently was unaware of what today is called "instantaneous speciation": sympatric speciation by either hybridization or polyploidy, the former sometimes (allopolyploidy), the latter always (autopolyploidy), result- ing in at least three times the haploid (half) somatic chromosome number of the parent(s). Although extremely rare in animals, instantaneous speciation is not uncommon in plants. However, with sexual species the problem of inbreeding remains. "Thus most speciation must be gradual."45 Darwin, of course, did not have the benefit of modem genetics. His main reason for rejecting saltational evolution would seem to be based on symbiotic relationships. He was strongly impressed by the many delicate and intricate symbiotic relationships "which we see everywhere through- out nature" (p. 132), what he called "co-adaptations." Saltational evolution seemed to him to offer no natural explanation of these relationships: The author of the "Vestiges of Creation" [Robert Chambers] would, I presume, say that, after a certain unknown number of generations, some bird had given birth to a woodpecker, and some plant to the misseltoe, and that these had been produced perfect as we now see them; but this assumption seems to me to be no explanation, for it leaves the case of the coadaptations of organic beings to each other and to their physical conditions of life, untouched and unexplained. (pp. 3-4) Moreover, Darwin was intent on providing a completely natural explanation of evolution. Evolution by saltation may have seemed to him as providing a slippery slope toward explanation by miraculous intervention, the view that "certain elemental atoms have been commanded suddenly to flash into living tissues" (p. 483) - a view that he found not a little difficult to believe. Duglas J. Futuyma, Evolutionary Biology (Sunderland, Mass.: Sinauer, 1986), p. 228.</page><page sequence="17">WAS DARWIN REALLY A SPECIES NOMINALIST? 143 At any rate, does Darwin's historical Great Chain of Being make him a species nominalist as regards vertical species? With some slight hesitation, I would say it does not. To begin, there is his claim that "all true classification is genealogical; [and] that community of descent is the hidden bond which naturalists have been unconsciously seeking" (p. 420). For a true species nominalist, on the other hand, there can be no such thing as a true classification of species, genealogical or otherwise, since there are no species in reality to classify. Further, unlike Lamarck, Darwin did not think that all extinction is pseudo- extinction (the gradual evolution of one species into another), but rather that it is often real extinction. For instance, he tells us that as a consequence of natural selection (cf. p. 317) "those [species] which do not change will become extinct" (p. 315), and that "Rarity, as geology tells us, is the precursor to extinction" (p. 109). No true species nominalist, of course, would ever assent to these propositions. To echo Agassiz, if species do not exist at all, how can they become extinct? Moreover, Darwin seems clearly to have subscribed not only to real extinction, but also to the view that extinction is forever. Anticipating what is today known as Dollo's Law, he concludes that "When a group has once wholly disappeared, it does not reappear; for the link of generation has been broken" (p. 344). In addition, he clearly thinks that even if a species should come to inhabit the exact same niche of an extinct species, it would be a different species, if only morphologically, since it brings with it different ancestral characters (p. 315). Where the real difficulty arises is with speciation. As Mayr points out, Darwin did not have a clear theory on speciation.46 Indeed, given his insis- tence that all evolution must be extremely gradual (p. 108) and that all species must evolve or face extinction (p. 315), it might be argued that evolution and speciation on Darwin's view provide one with a continuum in which it is ulti- mately arbitrary where one chops it up to delimit vertical species. Granting this, one consequence we must recognize is that even if the chopping up of a continuum is ultimately arbitrary, it is not necessarily unreal, for something real is being chopped up. The resulting species are not, after all, fictions, like unicorns, centaurs, and mermaids. The resulting vertical species, then, though ultimately arbitrary, are in some sense still real. But this may not satisfy. What we have to remember, at any rate, is that Darwin clearly thought of speciation, for the most part, as a branching pattern, as evidenced in his one and only diagram in the Origin (pp. 514-515), in his discussion of it in terms of species (pp. 1 16-1 17), and in his claim that "In a tree we can specify this or that branch, though at the actual fork the two unite and blend together" (p. 432). And far from contending that all evolution 46 Mayr, Growth of Biological Thought (above, n. 7), pp. 410-417.</page><page sequence="18">144 DAVID N. STAMOS must proceed at a constant speed, Darwin did accommodate the possibility of various rates of evolution, albeit very slow, including extremely slow rates and possibly even stasis - he did, after all, coin the term "living fossils" (p. 107), possibly represented as species F in his diagram.47 In sum, it seems clear that Darwin, explicit claims to the contrary, thought that species taxa are objectively real both horizontally and vertically. More- over, in spite of his claim that "we shall at least be freed from the vain search for the undiscovered and undiscoverable essence of the term species" (p. 485), there appears no good reason (contra Beatty) to believe that he would have denied the reality of the species category, although he may not have had a sufficiently clear idea in order to define it. But, of course, it need only be remembered that to define it would have been for Darwin to contradict and defeat what needed to have been a lifetime strategy.
