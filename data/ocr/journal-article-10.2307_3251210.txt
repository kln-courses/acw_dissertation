Les hommes sont si necessairement fous, que ce serait etre fou, par un autre tour de folie, de n 'etre pas fou. Pascal, Pensees, B 414 The sophia in philo-sophia is the antonym of pathos. Thus philoso- phers are, for the most part, the enemies of the phil-pathe, the trage- dians. If, as Epictetus defines it, "tragedy is uniquely the narration in tragic verse of passions experienced by men fascinated by external objects,"' philosophy seems by its very self-definition to be the over- coming of passion by Reason. Indeed, from its inception, philoso- phy conceived of passion as its radical other, the difference by which it fashioned its own identity (Meyer, 293). Hence the semantic disso- nance we experience when confronted by a concept such as 'philos- ophy of passions.' This ironic dissonance would become all the MLN, 110 (1995): 918-942 ? 1995 by The Johns Hopkins University Press</page><page sequence="2">MLN more evident if we consider a tragedy whose subject is philosophical practice. The Clouds of Aristophanes, let us not forget, is a comedy. Moral philosophy (ethics) is clearly on the defensive here. Its traditional role having been challenged and supplanted first by the Moralists (Montaigne, Pascal, La Rochefoucauld) and then by social scientists, moral philosophy is in want of a discourse capable of constructively accounting for passion. "Passion" here does not refer necessarily to grandiose excesses (thumos) depicted by Homer or Wagner, but quite simply it refers to our mundane daily psycho- drama: hate and love, fear and confidence, calm and anger, shame and impudence, compassion, emulation, jealousy, good will, indig- nation and contempt (Meyer, 75). Although very different in na- ture, the two books considered here set themselves the identical tasks of creating (Meyer) or rediscovering (Nussbaum) a philosoph- ical practice which will make an adequate description and analysis of the passions possible and which, by the inclusion of passion in the categories susceptible of philosophical analysis, would henceforth overcome the perennial dichotomy between logos and pathos. Le Philosophe et les Passions and The Therapy of Desire share a com- mon anxiety about the state of contemporary philosophy. Both evi- dently seek to go beyond nihilism, facile relativism, historicism and psychoanalysis; both challenge the apparent sterility of academic moral philosophy, be it analytically or continentally inspired; and, finally, both share a common allegiance to some form of cognitive rationality in their attempt at a conceptual corraling of passions. But the similarities end here. Nussbaum's book is an idiosyncratic account of Hellenistic philosophy in which she advances a polemi- cal argument regarding the relationship between reason and pas- sion and the role of philosophy as the true healer of excessive emotions or passions. This argument challenges virtually all the anti-foundationalist critique of metaphysics from Nietzsche down to Rorty. Meyer's book is both a history and a critique of the concept of passion in western philosophy from Plato to Kant (part I) and a cohesive theory of passions (part II). Nussbaum argues, to a large extent, for a philosophical return to a Hellenistic form of rationality and pragmatic commitment to a philosophical therapeutics, while Meyer axiomatically rejects all concepts of passion arising out of the Plato-Kant tradition. Meyer offers us "problematology"-a philo- sophical practice which rejects propositionalism, postulating a form of questioning which does not obliterate foundational questions.2 Finally, these two books are particularly well suited for comparison 919</page><page sequence="3">ESSAY-REVIEW because each conceives of itself as the critique of the other. Nuss- baum's substantial acceptance of the Hellenistic conception of the logos represents a form of propositional rationalism which Meyer explicitly rejects. On the other hand, Meyer's skepticism (anti- foundationalism), linguistic pragmatism and phenomenology would place him in a modern perspective to which Nussbaum is acutely averse. The Therapy of Desire is a polemical book. It is not simply an an- tiquarian gloss which tries to reconstruct the historical, philological and philosophical cohesiveness of ancient texts. Although such an effort is also a major component of Nussbaum's book, and here as in her previous work brilliant and insightful analyses abound (espe- cially regarding Lucretius), the interdisciplinary and conceptual in- terest lies rather with the theoretical assumptions and the polemical anti-modern conceptual models which generate the entire subse- quent argument. Nussbaum makes two initial cases for the study of Hellenistic philosophy. The historical case is convincing. In most philosophy departments a gaping hole exists between Aristotle and Descartes. Epicureanism, Skepticism and Stoicism (not to mention Augustine, Aquinas and Maimondes and Renaissance philosophy in toto) are rarely part of the curriculum, yet they are absolutely crucial for the understanding of all subsequent history of thought, in particular the history of Medieval and Renaissance thought. The Therapy of Desire, being in part an engaging and accessible exposition of the ethics and cultural history of Hellenistic philosophy, should contrib- ute to the ongoing rediscovery of this post-classical philosophy. But the interest of the book lies in what Nussbaum calls the "trans- contextual ethical truths" (8) of Hellenistic philosophy. Whatever legitimacy historicism, and its corollary relativism, are allowed, the insights of the Epicureans and Stoics3 cannot be reduced, as Foucault asserts, to a biou techne (art of life or technique de soi).4 This would obviously reduce Hellenistic philosophical theory and prac- tice to the level of "religious and magical/superstitious movements" (p. 5), and thereby undermine its permanent claims to truth. "What is distinctive," writes Nussbaum, "about the contribution of the phi- losophers is that they assert that philosophy, and not anything else, is the art we require, an art that deals in valid and sound argu- ments, an art that is committed to the truth" (ibid.). Given his view that "knowledge and argument are themselves tools of power" (ibid.), Foucault argues that these techniques are another variation 920</page><page sequence="4">MLN of power politics. Nussbaum, on the other hand, contends that such a commitment to transcendental truth is anything but one more trick in a panoply of power tools, and that this particular type of philosophical rationality is ontologically and epistemologically dif- ferent from non-philosophical modes of knowledge. Similarly, Nussbaum criticizes John Rawls because of his belief that ethical theorizing is a matter of practical reasoning, an histori- cal, culture-specific activity, without any claim for transcendental reality.5 "[Rawls] concludes that the notion of truth can be ap- propriate only in an inquiry that is a search for the nature of an altogether independent reality. Ethical theories, lacking such an independent goal, cannot claim to embody truth" (22). While Nuss- baum also denies the possible existence of supra-human Platonic ethical truths, she wants to preserve the notion of truth ("transcon- textual ethical truths") understood in terms of her main analytical tool and the metaphor which generates the entire argument: the medical analogy. Since the whole argument of the Therapy of Desire rests on the validity of this analogy, I shall concentrate exclusively here on its two aspects: first, the competence of the physician, and second, the disease, the passion, of the patient. Simply put, the medical analogy is predicated on the following argument: the relationship between physician and patient is analo- gous to the relationship between philosopher and ordinary human being. The analogy is certainly historically valid. Unlike their classi- cal predecessors, Epicureans and Stoics have a much more prag- matic attitude toward the applicability of philosophical concepts hic et nunc for the amelioration of individual lives. The goal of their philosophy is eudaimonia, human flourishing through the use of reason. To clarify this concept, Nussbaum contrasts the medical model of ethics to the Platonic approach and to the approach based on ordinary belief. Plato errs in postulating ethical norms "inde- pendently of human being, human ways of life, human desires" (17). Besides being empirically wrong, such suprahuman categories would obviously make the Platonic physician "sadistic and callous" (20). In contrast, ordinary belief-based ethics involves the notion that "ethical inquiry and teaching are simply the recording of tradi- tional social belief and have no legitimate goal beyond this. Ethics, in this view, begins from what we might call an assumption of social health, the assumption that, for the most part, people have been brought up to have true ethical beliefs and reliable intuitions, and that ordinary beliefs and intuitions can be treated as criteria of 921</page><page sequence="5">ESSAY-REVIEW ethical truth and rightness" (24). But such an ethics, based on a common, historically secreted consensus as to the true good, would be anathema to the Epicureans and Stoics. Being a passive follower of custom, the non-philosopher is a victim of the ordinary rather than being a happy participant in it. Ordinary beliefs provide a starting point, a place where the problems are located, but they do not offer a normative model. The nomos is the disease and not the cure. In short, "moral medical philosophy" seeks to reproduce the a-symmetry which predicates the physician-patient situation. Like the physician, the philosopher knows the truth and is capable through the practice of an art of curing the patient. And like physi- cians Epicureans, and Stoics take into account the real, individual and specific subjectivity of their patients, their beliefs and desires, hopes and fears. This, then, would be a philosophical practice far more human than any abstract philosophy of Being, whence its attraction for Nussbaum. Let us return to the notion of truth. Within the logic of the medical analogy, truth is claimed through appeal to the following criteria: 1) internal consistency 2) correspondence 3) broad coher- ence and fit (23). Internal consistency, namely the surveying and sort- ing out of "beliefs toward the end of consistency" (ibid), is a neces- sary but not sufficient condition for healing. "By bringing to light the hidden contradictions and tensions in a system of beliefs, a pragmatic medical ethics can claim to be doing something that is at least necessary in the search for truth" (23-24). This survey com- pleted, the philosopher/physician proceeds to evaluate the corre- spondence of the survey data with his "normative yet empirical" (ibid) positive knowledge of Nature. The second criterion, correspondence, presupposes not only the aforementioned self-transparency of the subject (e.g. ability to har- monize contradictions through the use of Reason), or the transpar- ency of the patient to the philosopher, but also the transparency of nature. Epicureans and Stoics, although in very different ways, ground their ethics in a normative account of Nature. Epicurus, for example, holds that "an account of the ethical end is inseparable from his general epistemology, according to which the senses are themselves entirely reliable, and all error comes from beliefs" (108). Hence, Epicurus sees consciousness as capable of being a reflective screen of external reality, a true mirror of the Real, were it not for the obfuscation of false beliefs. In the case of the philosopher, the correspondence between phenomena, somatic sensation and intel- 922</page><page sequence="6">MLN lection is complete. More importantly, a correct reading of Nature, of natural signs, conveys a prescriptive code of ethics. Correspon- dence, therefore, implies the possible symbolic adequation of two independent sets: (m1, m2, m3, . .. . mn) for the mind, and (nl, n2, n3 ... nn) for Nature. The tragic, existential opacity of Man in Nature vanishes to oblivion in this ideal adequation. Everything being transparent and normative and teleological (in a diffused sense with Epicurus and in a grand narratological sense with Zeno), the "therapy of desire" would consist in the imposition upon the patient of the apodictic and prescriptive Truth of Nature. To arrive at this ideal, the Epicurean student will be confronted with "a pro- cess of argument [...] often called diorthosis, 'correcting'" (131). The truth criterion of coherence and general fit proves to be just as problematic. As we saw, Nussbaum rebuts Foucault by asserting that Hellenistic ethics, since it constitutes itself as a systematic philosophi- cal inquiry with strong transcendental truth claims, is not to be reduced to a biou techne, a form of psychological bricolage lacking theoretical coherence and fit and bearing only incidental and lo- calized relationship to truth. In other words, Nussbaum holds fast to the distinction between logos and nomos and does not allow for a relativizing of the former into the latter. It must be remembered that Epicureanism and Stoicism presented themselves as complete systems of thought. From the beginning to the end they insisted that no part of the system could be independent of or superior to any other part.6 Logic, physics and ethics form one coherent system, the premises of which are always dogmatically asserted (e.g. atomism in Lucretius; cosmos, providence, logic, physics in Stoicism). In Sto- icism, as Goldschmidt demonstrates, "The conquest [...] is a passage from the same to the same [un passage du m&amp;me au meme]. In the structural movement of the system, the starting point coincides with the finishing line."7 Stoicism is not a deductive system; the initial founding "proposition" regards the whole of Being and the Real. In other words, it is impossible to isolate one argument within the system for a particular truth-claim; it all stands and falls together, logic as much as physics and ethics. Truth, consequently, can then be claimed on two distinct levels: internal logic within the system and/or adequation to the Real, the fit between logos and phenom- ena. Despite the arguments that both the Hellenistic philosophers and Nussbaum make, the inherent tension between a dogmatic and totalizing philosophical system and the contingency and individu- ality of the medical situation becomes evident. The philosopher- 923</page><page sequence="7">ESSAY-REVIEW physician possesses total knowledge; he only wonders about how to move his sick patient along from point a to point b. Whatever is contingent and individual is not the analysis of the problem or the solution, but simply the tactics required in a particular cure. The philosopher here is clinical in that he is willing to deal with individ- ual cases hic et nunc. But, in real clinical medicine, the good clini- cian never possesses this totalizing and universal medical semiology, never infers natural apodicticity in every aspect of existence, and never worries too much about the coherence and fit of a given remedy with metaphysics, cosmology and logic. It is now clear why Nussbaum needs to attack all manner of histor- ical (Foucault) or ontological (Rawls) relativism. Even if one only partially subscribes to this medical conception of Hellenistic philos- ophy (as at times she herself does intimate), its entire validity rests on the acceptability of the a-symmetry between the philosopher and the commoner. And, in turn, this a-symmetry depends wholly on the availability of "transcontextual [ethical] truths" to the philosopher. Yet, nowhere are we told how a Zeno or an Epicurus attains this higher knowledge. We return to the foundational paradox of the Meno8, as Meyer will continuously insist: how is the passage from ignorance to knowledge possible? How can I ignore yet know at the same time? In short, how can the philosopher, living in the sensible, contingent world, like all other humans, arrive at a true and total knowledge and meaning of all sensible phenomena (Epicurus) or understand his role within the Cosmos and its providence (Zeno)? How does one arrive at this meta-positionality vis-a-vis Being and Nature? Furthermore, a close scrutiny of the three criteria guiding the Hellenistic medical conception of philosophy suggests a number of other problems. The notion of consistency, for one, presupposes the (possible) transparency of the subject to him/her self. Can we speak today of harmonizing all "contradictions and beliefs" within our subjectivity? Is it possible, as Descartes and the rationalists still thought, to achieve simultaneously this empirical adequation be- tween knowledge and Being? Certainly, a Socratic introspective search, an Aristotelian gradual acquisition of good habits or even a psychoanalytical slow process of self-discovery, are conceivable as positive and partially achievable goals, but never the total self- adequation with Nature. Even more disturbing for me is Nuss- baum's evasion of the contemporary debates (e.g. Rorty) regarding the viability of a theory of meaning based on general fit, correspon- dence and cohesion. 924</page><page sequence="8">MLN To be sure, Nussbaum does seem to be somewhat troubled with the dogmatic epistemology and ethics of the Stoics and Epicureans. But her solution of "using Aristotle's ethical thought as a background and a foil" (8) seems, from a modern polemical point of view, to be equally problematic. This Aristotelian critique certainly points to core problems in Stoic and Epicurean epistemologies but for a contemporary reader it does so insufficiently, since Nussbaum's po- lemical argument is not limited to a comparative history of ancient ethics but extends to a critique of anti-foundationalism. Aristotle conducts inquiries; he starts with not knowing and sifts his way to- ward a partial understanding by dialectics, by deduction and by induction. Stoics and Epicureans move from dogmatic knowledge to prescription. The tension between the two practices is obvious. This Aristotelian "foil" may be interesting from a striclty historical point of view, but is insufficient in the polemical context of champi- oning Epicurean and Stoic theory and practice against Rawls and Foucault. Nussbaum passionately argues here for an Aristotelicized version of Hellenistic philosophical practice as a counter practice to the paralyzing impotence and nihilism of modernity. Yet I wonder whether Nussbaum's Aristotelicized revisionism of Hellenistic phi- losophy really constitutes that magic bullet sufficient to do away with the gnawing skepticism of the Derridas and Rortys? As in the case of truth criteria discussed above, Nussbaum does not directly tackle the core problems which animate modern critique. On the contrary it seems that for Nussbaum Reason corresponds only to its Greek Aristotelian variety; all critiques of this type of reason are then auto- matically assigned to the domain of the "irrational." The founda- tional hypotheses of Epicurus and Zeno are never questioned or justified per se: How do they arrive at their insights into the true nature of things and the universe as a whole? How is the passage made from Nature to apodictic reason? How is human subjectivity and contingency the grand disease to be cured by the logoi of the philosophers? How is Nature to be the transparent guide in all things? The paradox of virtue-based, naturalist ethics is just a more exacer- bated case of the paradox of ethical naturalism in general. Be they strict or liberal naturalism, they all suffer from varying degrees of (false) argument from unproven hypothesis, circular logic and an- thropomorphic projection. With the exception of early Hebrew thought and (perhaps) strict Platonism, virtually all Greek, Roman and later European philosophy seeks to ground itself in one form or another of naturalism. Modern liberal philosophy, for example, 925</page><page sequence="9">ESSAY-REVIEW grounds itself in a philosophy of Natural Right. Circular argumenta- tion here is inevitable: all positive proofs are predicated upon and proven by unfounded presuppositions: i.e. x is bad because it is contrary to Nature; and it is so because I hold y to be the true state of Nature; the State of Nature being always a confounding matrix of cognitive data and anthropomorphic projection. For every (natu- ral) instance of piety offered by Lucretius and Rousseau there is a corresponding instance of (natural) cruelty offered by Euripides and De Sade. Ideology consists in creating necessary adequations of a particular idiosyncratic custom with Nature. Plato circumvents natu- ralism by inventing the theory of forms, so that the Real of Nature is but the shadow of the Real. Early Hebrew thought circumvents natu- ralism by grounding the Law in the word of God, in strict opposition to the horror of Nature. The medical analogy can only be sustained by the Epicurean and Stoic metaphysician at the price of turning Nature into a metaphorical sign system containing its own apodictic moral imperatives, all of which are then exclusively known to the philosopher. Only then can the a-symmetry between patient and doctor be theoretically sustained as a viable analogy. Let us now, then, turn to the patient and her disease, the passions. For the sake of economy and clarity, I will henceforth limit my comments to Stoic therapeutics. Nussbaum creates a fictional character who is the patient. Her name is Nikidion (small victory). She is a Greek hetaira, a courtesan. In a surprising move for an academic book, Nikidion is the imagin- ary student/patient of the three Hellenistic schools. Through her eyes, her imagined subjectivity, her imagined experiences, the reader is introduced to the multiple therapies of desire offered by each school. Through Nikidion we shall imagine ourselves as Helle- nistic Greeks trying to cure our excessive desires by the therapy of the physician-philosophers. With this rhetorical device two comple- mentary aims are achieved: first, the reader is in the text because he or she identifies with Nikidion and, second, the distance between our philosophical horizons and those of the Greeks diminishes by our identification with the "victim," who experiences the same uni- versal problems experienced in our own daily life. Nikidion sym- bolizes victory over abstractness (philosophy) and over difference (Greek/Modern). Nikidion's disease is passion. As in Epictetus' definition of tragedy and the tragic hero, the patients of passion suffer from false judg- ments and beliefs which induce excessive ascription of importance 926</page><page sequence="10">MLN to externals. The description of passion starts on firm Aristotlelian grounds. Unlike Freud, who believes that emotions are "a mindless surge of affect" (88) or "some kind of a mindless process" (101) (an apparent reference to Freud's drive and instinct theory), Aristotle offers a cognitive view of the emotions which erases the difference between emotion (involuntary) and thinking (voluntary). Aristotle postulates that emotions are states of "intentional awareness, con- taining a view of their object" (81). Aristotle's analysis rests on the consensus of Greek philosophy concerning the emotions: 1) "Emo- tions are forms of intentional awareness [...] directed at or about subjects". 2) "Emotions have a very intimate relationship to beliefs, and can be modified by a modification of belief. [...]" 3)" . . . Emo- tions may appropriately be assessed as rational or irrational, and also (independently) as true or false, depending on the beliefs that are their basis or ground [...]"(80-1). As examples of Aristotelian analysis of passion (with implicit reference to identity, non- contradiction and causality), Nussbuam discusses the emotions of fear and pity, demonstrating that in both these basic emotions there must be a "rich intentional awareness of its objects, resting on be- liefs and judgments of many sorts, both general and concrete" (86). That is, I fear x of which I am intentionally aware and the reason I fear x as opposed to say loving x is that I hold certain beliefs about its nature. Thus emotions are cognitive responses to my subjective per- ception of the Real. From the purely subjective point of view they are eminently rational. They may, however, be true or false or objec- tively rational or irrational depending on my beliefs. If my beliefs correspond to the truth, then my emotions are both rational and true; if my beliefs are false, then emotions are false. "Emotions [in Aristotle] [...] are individuated by reference to their characteristic beliefs" (88), and, thus, it is not surprising that Aristotle, unlike Plato and the Stoics, does not categorically condemn passions and emotions. Thus Nussbaum's "Greek" cognitive scheme seems to be: external stimulus -X perception -- intentional awareness -&gt; [existing belief] -&gt; judgment -- action-emotion. With the exception of the ability of the therapist to change emotions simply by modifying belief, this scheme corresponds in a rough manner to the concept of emotion advanced by Marcia Cavel in her recent book The Psychoanalytic Mind, From Freud to Philosophy.9 For Cavel "belief is a particular sort of attitude toward a proposition, since other attitudes toward the same proposition are possible."10 The cognitivist view of emotions, 927</page><page sequence="11">ESSAY-REVIEW asserts Cavell, "show[s] us in our guise as organisms interacting with the world around us, which makes for confusion about both per- ception and emotion."11 Without challenging this fundamental cog- nitivist scheme, it is possible to wonder about the nature of the concepts of belief and judgment. In other words, does belief result exclusively from a conscious cognitivist activity or is it an opaque combinatory sedimentation comprised of cognition, deep cultural structures and practices (habitus), unconscious behavioral adapta- tion and primate social biology-as well as billiard-like conscious cognition? With these questions in mind, I would like to zero in on the crucial theoretical moment in the Therapy of Desire: the transition from Aristotle to Chrysippus. There are "four theses that are de- fended within this [Stoic] tradition about the relationship between belief or judgment and passion. 1. Necessity. The relevant belief is necessary for the passion. 2. Constituent element. The belief is a (necessary) constituent element in the passion. 3. Sufficiency. The belief is sufficient for the passion. 4. Identity. The belief is identical to the passion" (371). Aristotle holds (1) and (2) to be true; his position concerning (3) is unclear. Now, in order to make the case for Stoic psychology as a model of "transcontextual [ethical] truth," a model of perennis philosophia, partially endorsed by Nussbaum against modernity, the reader, who intuitively assents to a mild ver- sion of (1) and (2), would have somehow to swallow steps (3) and (4). For all Stoic psychology of the passions down to Marcus Au- relius, relies on this Chrysippian scheme whose stated aim is the complete extirpation of the passions. Now Nussbaum explains very carefully all the subtleties of this position (different sorts of judgments, beliefs, appetites, innate dis- positions, etc.). But however we turn the question, and whatever "common sense" and "plausibility" arguments are advanced, from a modern point of view, the identification of passion with judgment cannot be ironed out by generous subtilitas. In Stoicism, all passions, in the final analysis, are identical with mistakes in judgments based on false belief; they are all condemnable over-valuing of "externals." Nikidion will be told repeatedly that all emotions stem from her inability to extricate herself from the world of the stulti, fools. Even were she sincerely grieving for the loss of a loved one, her emotion would be condemned for ascribing to the lost person too much importance (379). She will become a sage once she assents only to representations philosophically consistent with the Stoic world view. 928</page><page sequence="12">MLN At that moment, controlling her representation to herself of exter- nal stimuli, withholding assent from all things not philosophical, she would live in an eternal present of the sage, undisturbed by all things external, entirely autonomous. The disease of passion is then a cognitive sickness of the weak- minded. Not only drunkard fools and noble tragic heroes suffer the disease of passion but all of humanity save the (Stoic) philosophers. Nikidion, like us, to escape her sickness, must transform reality into an all embracing cognitive matrix. As Goldschmidt insists, Stoicism, unlike Platonism, accepts reality as it is (its vaunted naturalism and sensualism, acceptance of the sensible) but only at the price of trans- forming reality through and through (Nature is Reason). Conse- quently, the a-symmetry between the (meta)physician and the (al- leged) patient is not relative but massive. As the Stoic sage has access to a transformed reality, he can guide the rest of us who are pris- oners of raw reality, assenters to raw representations. The Platonic omniscience is completely reproduced here, except that it is the world hic et nunc that is transformed in Stoicism and not a supra- lunar reality in the realm of forms. The medical analogy, upon which rests the whole of Nussbaum's argument, can only be sus- tained as a polemical model, as a model of compassionate philo- sophical practice for us today, at the price of entertaining the plau- sibility of both the omniscient cogito of the philosopher and the exclusively cognitive nature of the patient's disease. In reading The Therapy of Desire I am struck by how Nussbaum reproduces in her book exactly what Goldschmidt cautioned against in the the fourth and final postface to his Le Systeme Stoicien et l'Idee du Temps: first, explaining Stoicism against the background of Aris- totle; second, isolating one element within the Stoic system; third, trying to understand Stoicism in "analytic terms," canceling thereby the utter otherness of Stoic rationality to us moderns.12 Nussbaum's style of argumentation is to start with "plausible and intuitive" prem- ises (i.e. Aristotle "reasonable" cognitivism) and argue that Stoic arguments are simply their radicalization. Arguing from Aristotle, appealing to common sense, concentrating within the Stoic system solely on psychology, inducing a personal identification with Niki- dion, all have the same strategic objective of doing away with the radical otherness of Stoicism. This otherness consists precisely in the definition of Reason as the understanding of the order of the universe (cosmos) and the necessity of adjusting all human actions and thoughts to the order of the universe, to the thoughts of god 929</page><page sequence="13">ESSAY-REVIEW (cosmic sympathy). "This consciousness of the self," writes Pierre Hadot, "is not only a moral consciousness, it is also a cosmic con- sciousness: the 'attentive' man lives without interruption in the presence of God in the 'memory of god,' consenting joyfully to the will of Universal Reason and seeing all things with the same gaze of god himself."13 There is no break between physics and morality: it is as if carved out of one block of logos. The Stoics always insisted that each element in their philosophy must cohere with the rest: ad singula respondere [...] totam sententiam explicare, insists Cicero.14 Thus when Nussbaum writes that "A mo- tivation for me in writing about them [Epicureans and Stoics] was to discover whether it was possible to accept their arguments about the elimination of anger, while still rejecting their more general attack on passions such as love, fear and grief" (509), one wonders what is the possible connection among this very limited interest and the vaunted "transcontextual ethical truths" and the three truth criteria mentioned at the beginning as an alternative to modern relativism. Nussbaum not only isolates morality within Stoicism, but also within this Stoic moral theory she finally rejects the equation of all passion with error of judgment while seeming to accept the possibility of the extirpation of anger, as if anger as a passion had an ontology and a global functional logic different from that of other passions. Iron- ically, this a la carte acceptance of Stoic morality, with only casual regard to its coherence within Stoic cosmic rationalism, has the effect of reducing it to a type of a subjectively seen 'timeless wis- dom,' a spiritual coping mechanism, a tranquilizer (as Paul Veyne would say) 15 that is precisely what Foucault meant by a biou techne: After all the theoretical concessions, qualifications, historicizations and outright "cherry picking" are taken into account-within Nussbaum's anti-anti-foundationalism polemical context-what "Hellenistic medical therapeutics" offers us is another pharmacon of the biou techne variety for the unsuccessful treatment of our post- modern blues. Michel Meyer places the problem of passion at the heart of the western philosophical project. Passion is the Other of reason, its imaginary nemesis, the projection of its own (passionate) impulse, its real yet denied raison d'etre. Greek philosophical culture (save Socrates and the Skeptics) provides answers which often obliter- ate the foundational questions. From the theory of reminiscence in Plato's Meno, to the absoluteness of the principle of non- contradiction in Aristotle, and to the dogmatic shift from the same 930</page><page sequence="14">M LN to the same in Stoicism, through Hobbes' Leviathan, Descartes' cogito and the Kantian a-priori-all are variations of attempts to cre- ate a rational philosophy forming its own causa sui. Propositionalism had both to obliterate the question at the origin of the inquiry (in Plato, how can I know if I do not know where to search? In Des- cartes, am I deceived by the senses?) and invent a guarantor of ultimate rational veracity (the Forms in Plato; rationally proven God in Descartes; the arbitrary a-priori in Kant). In opposition to reli- gious beliefs, myths, social customs, superstitions, tragic theater, and so on (all effective answers to human questioning), Greek rational- ism demarcates its claim to absolute Truth, its answer, by the notion of apodicticity-the absolute cosmic and natural necessity of its propositions and answers. Meyer defines the classical Greek project as the idea that "the logos could have access, by its internal re- sources, to the apodicticity of the order of things, to their nature, of which man is a part and which he should then reflect to be what he really is" (96). Nussbaum's criteria of correspondence and coher- ence clearly consititute a strong version of this logos. At its heart, philosophical rationalism constitutes a response to the human existential demand for certitude. Twenty-five centuries of philosophy notwithstanding, this ideal adequation between na- ture and humanity is yet to be achieved. Progress in fact has been so questionable that virtually all philosophers since Descartes have tried to re-establish philosophy on firm grounding once and for all. Nussbaum, for one, seems to be so distraught over the state of modern philosophy that she prescribes a rethinking of philosophi- cal practice along the lines of an Aristotelized reading of Hellenistic philosophy. As far as we know, humans are the only organisms in nature whose telos is not a given. Unlike plants and animals, human beings experi- ence almost every facet of existence as a form of conscious or un- conscious questioning to which culture is an answer; human beings are the only phenomenon in nature who experience the problem of means and ends as an open question. That is why we are the only entities in nature in need of a self-generated ethics. Between Being and the Real there is an inadequation which, according to Meyer, only passion can mediate. Philosophy desires to short circuit the endless and necessary questioning, as well as obliterate the answers which custom provides, answers to the unbearable weight of human indeterminancy, with its own rational necessity: the necessity of its answers to the exclusion of all others. But, perennially, there lies an 931</page><page sequence="15">ESSAY-REVIEW enemy who foils this imperial project-passion, the obstacle be- tween the pure concept and the practice of real beings in the world. "Propositionalism," writes Meyer, " answers the most fundamental question there is: what does it mean to answer? This question gov- erns all the other [questions], it models them, because the solution brought will be valid for any possible solution, since it is precisely a matter of determining that which constitutes a solution in general. As the questioning is open to a multiplicity of options, the answer, being one of them, does away at once with any alternative, therefore with any problem" (289). If the principle of non-contradiction is my a-priori guarantee of the veracity of any proposition, then all that which contradicts this absolute truth would be rejected as "irra- tional". Since philosophy is cognitive by nature, the move to ratio- nalize passion, rendering it in this manner a proper subject of intel- ligible properties (i.e. judgment) is inevitable within the internal logic of Greek philosophy. In the world of the intelligible, proper- ties must necessarily be what they are; in the world of the sensible, properties are contingent. The whole struggle of philosophy is to somehow reduce the ontological difference between the intelligible and the sensible; to pretend that what holds for intelligible proper- ties (logic, grammar, mathematics) must also encompass the vari- able, contingent multiplicity of the sensible. Passion, being at the heart of the unpredictable contingency in humanity, becomes the radical Other of propositionalism: "Propositionalism, at heart, has only the fault of its absolutes. Demonstration, necessity, are certainly excellent forms of discourse, but could not pretend to be the only ones, without having to relegate all others to the darkness of the irrational. And there, propositionalism is destroyed by itself, be- cause it only conceives of itself as exclusive of its exclusions. The reason for this is simple: to accept plurality in answerhood means admitting that the problematic and the multiple can inscribe them- selves in it, and resurface under the form of questions in the an- swers themselves. But, propositionalism is born of necessity, which thus affirms itself circularly, but also excludes all that is not apodic- tic" (291). Now this critique of traditional philosophy is not original. What is new is Meyer's attempt to go beyond a purely negative critique of philosophy and ground philosophy in what he calls "problematol- ogy"-a philosophy of questioning, a rational skepticism which poses questions having no answers in advance; a philosophy built around the problematological difference, meaning that it always 932</page><page sequence="16">MLN keeps alive the difference between questions and answers (300). For Meyer the opposition should not be between (Greek) rationalism and post modern irrationalism, as it is in Nussbaum, but between propositional rationalism and interrogative rationalism. And pas- sion, being that theoretical monkey on philosophy's back, would naturally prove to be the perfect subject for the exploration of the difference between the two approaches. Throughout Le Philosophe et les Passions, Meyer poses three interre- lated questions: 1) What is Man? i.e. what specifically can passion reveal about the human condition? 2) What is passion if we are to define it positively and not simply in opposition to an idiosyncratic (e.g. Greek) form of rationality? 3) What is it precisely about tradi- tional philosophical discourse which necessitates the exclusion of passion from "the philosophical life"? These questions are explored within two contexts, first, that of an examination of a series of prob- lems relating to philosophy and passion from Plato to Kant; and second, that of an exposition of what could be a positive phenome- nology of passions. By way of continuation and contrast to Nuss- baum, I will first briefly sketch Meyer's analysis of passion in Aris- totle and then explore some aspects of Meyer's own functional understanding of the passions. We saw earlier that Nussbaum noted the indecisiveness in Aris- totle's view of passion (cognitivism but without necessity), leaving the explanation for it open. Meyer insists on the fact that this indeci- sion springs from tension within Aristotle's philosophy in general. There are in fact two Aristotles: one, close to Platonism, wants to resolve the duality of the intelligible and the sensible in a gener- alized apodictic system. This Aristotle rejects passion almost along Platonic lines (cf. Metaphysics, 1022bl5). The other Aristotle accepts man as an entity "free as to its choices of ends, plunged in the contingent, assigning itself each time particular objectives which he is driven to redefine" (65-6). This is the Aristotle of the Rhetoric. Aristotle, Meyer insists, holds simultaneously two moralities: a mo- rality of the apodictic logos and a morality of contingency. The objective of the Rhetoric is to teach the orator how to manipu- late the emotions of the jurors. To do so, the orator must first know what emotions are. Meyer reads the rhetoric of the passions in Aris- totle within the framework of intersubjective phenomenology. He is aware of the fact that one cannot speak of consciousness and subjec- tivity in a pre-Cartesian context-Greek philosophy is a philosophy of Being and not of subjectivity-but, nevertheless, decides that for 933</page><page sequence="17">ESSAY-REVIEW the modern reader, with this caution always in mind, the conceptual transposition is instructive. Passion, therefore, is the instantiation of the dialectic of identity and difference which is constantly negoti- ated within any social group. "Passion is the consciousness I have of the consciousness of the Other concerning me, and at once, it is an image of our rapport which I interiorize, a difference which fuses or which explodes" (72). I am with a given person and I perceive (I make the judgment would say Nussbaum) that he or she disdains me; a hostile image of our rapport forms in my imagination; this interiorized hostile difference with the Other renders our rapport hostile. Passion is that which I suffer from the Other; it is "the Other in me so long that he has an image of me against which I react." This intersubjective consciousness, declares Meyer, is "the essence of pas- sion in the Aristotelian Rhetoric" (72). The political implications here are obvious. A community that resolves to renounce violence must find a way to negotiate differ- ence so that there might exist a minimum of common identity. But common identity is a result of negotiations whose ultimate product is an equilibrium which is in turn always menaced by excess of passion. Excessive difference in the dialectic of identity can become harmful, whence the doctrine of the mean in Aristotle. At the heart of the political pact there lies the micro-intersubjective Sartrian hell: to have an identity I must be different; but if everybody asserts this difference how can we coexist politically? "Each wanting to be one self, each becomes inevitably the same as the other, who wants the same thing while wanting to be different" (173). The drama of this (ego) negotiation is the drama of the passions-the sign of the contingent in a political animal whose telos is never a natural given. To talk of politics is to talk of passion; to talk of community is to talk about the negotiation of passion. That is why the understanding of passion is the single most important element in the (courtroom) judicial process. The other political alternative is a totalitarian dic- tatorship of the logos as fantasized by Plato and Zeno. There real debate is absent since all problems have been resolved in advance, and passion is circumvented by the apodictic logos. To a large extent the political and social marginalization of philosophy is a function of philosophy's unwillingness to acknowledge the rhetorical reality of human intersubjectivity. The so-called "sophists," recognizing that logos itself in matters human is part of the mutable, contingent reality, lacking from a human point of view any cosmic necessity, being never in correspondence with the order of things, insisted 934</page><page sequence="18">M L N upon a practice of philosophy which is consistent with this lack of adequation and correspondence. Only then, based on a shrewd assessment of the reality of human affairs, its passionate substratum, could philosophy become pertinent to the agora. For Meyer the subjective a-priori is passion. The theory of reminis- cence, the cogito, the Kantian a-priori are all products of the passion- ate quest for the answer to a perennial question: where, in the final analysis, can the contingent subject anchor his or her existential need for certitude? Desire to know, impulse to search, these are manifestations of the original passion, the degree zero of the philo- sophical quest, and, according to Meyer, the only possible solution to the paradox of the Meno: "Passion is at once the obstacle to the truth and that which pushes me toward it" (294).16 The more dog- matic the rationalism, the more transparent its passion: Stoicism. No longer seen as the opposite of reason, no longer excluded as the menace to the immutable stability of thought, passion consti- tutes the space of the interface between the subject and reality. It is the filter, the valve, which mediates between the continual shock of the real and the subject's desire for permanent stability. From the subjective point of view, reality presents itself as an endless series of questions for which passion functions as an answer. "Passion assures the continuity of the real. How is this continuity assured? Each new problem is seen on the basis of questions already resolved, and apprehended in function of answers which were brought to them in the past. The new questions become then rhetorical questions, in the sense that they present themselves as interrogative forms of already accepted truths. [...] if the question was able to be sup- pressed as such [...] this has to do [...] with the human desire to live in self-assurance and security. This nourishes an "I am right" cease- lessly re-enacted, and upon which are transplanted all ideologies and unconscious constructions"(302). Hence notions such as com- mon sense and plausibility are seen for what they are: not the shared, timeless, universal mental substratum of humanity, but historical and culture-specific responses to the questions of the Real. Common sense is the common filter a culture imposes upon its interpretation of reality so that the illusion of a stable, timeless continuity between subjectivity and the Real is accomplished. Common sense, like all passionate phenomena, is an homeostatic mechanism assuring the cohesion of the subject (and the culture) in that menacing sea of change that is the Real. For Meyer common sense represents the "essentialized passion" of a culture, the self-imposed filter between 935</page><page sequence="19">ESSAY-REVIEW its consciousness and reality, its responses to the questions of reality crystalized into unquestioned timeless truisms. Taking his cue from psychoanalysis, Meyer asserts that "As long as we will have not understood that the self is a story (histoire), we will not have resolved any of the grand problems that the concept of subjectivity poses since Descartes and Kant" (305). Story-telling in- volves a narrative reduction where raw data (the Real) is reduced into a sequence having its own internal dynamics and its own logic. But the psychoanalytic inspiration stops here. Echoing Nussbaum, Meyer entitles his theoretical chapter "For a critique of pure pas- sion", meaning a critique of passion seen as a dark, innate and unconscious mechanism which, by definition, escapes all rational discourse. For Meyer rhetoric, pragmatics, and phenomenology (all done within the problematological framework) are capable of a rational discourse concerning the passions. What then is the rhetoric driving this subjective story-telling? Its social framework, as we said, is common sense and ideology. On the micro-level Meyer identifies three rhetorical devices capital for the construction of the barrier against the real: deliteralization, denomina- tion, hierarchization. These mechanisms are not symptoms of a cogni- tive disease, susceptible to 'correction' once they are understood. Rather they indicate the basic paradox of the passions in that there is a "certain refusal of the real in the act of getting a grip of the real, so that we can live it and live in it. But reality is a function, and not a content" (303). Deliteralization is chief among these mechanisms: signs, stimuli from the outside do not possess their corresponding necessary in- terpretation. If such were the case, most human passion would then indeed be errors in judgment. But, in fact, most passion around us today such as the videos of Rodney King and Reginald Denney, to cite just the most obvious examples, demonstrate that a video graphic representation, the closest thing we have in the domain of representation to the Real, can still give rise to a wide variety of genuine de-literatization on the part of the viewing subject. These extreme examples illustrate the rhetorical process in which we en- gage countless times every day. A stable ego ideal is incompatible with the cognitive requirements of the Real. We cannot function if our basic assumptions about the Real are constantly challenged by contrary data. That is why integral skepticism is a psychological impossibility. By deliteralizing the real, we can reduce difference to sameness, assuring thus the stability of the subject. The questions of 936</page><page sequence="20">MLN the Real, its problematicity, are nullified in favor of an illusion, but a very potent and functional illusion, of changeless, timeless stability. The criterion of the success of passion is not truth but efficacy. It is precisely this feature of nomos which so terrified Greek philoso- phers: instead of deliterazing the real through myth and custom, they wanted to create new cosmically apodictic criteria of judgment that would escape the arbitrariness of custom and opinion. Instead of the perception of reality as a function of nomos, philosophy wished to eradicate this functionality by the discovery of a necessary and absolute identity of judgment with what is. Within this logic, passion is necessarily the enemy, the eternal foil for those searching for a supra-human order. Denomination and hierarchization represent the same subjective act of ordering. To name an act is to imply a judgment. For some Brutus was a murderer, for others a liberator. Violent acts may be named riots or uprisings. The name, at any case, reveals a judgment, that is a reduction of the Real to its subjective and passionate expression. This is why language and metaphors communicate instantly a men- tality and an ethics. Naming is closely connected to the more gen- eral concept of hierarchization. The act of deliteralization and de- nomination express the subjective passionate interpretation of the real, a process accomplished by a (necessary) pre-established hier- archy of meaning and value assigned to events. "This circularity [between passion and perception] functions in that the chosen de- nomination anticipates implications which must follow, these impli- cations being known by other means" (320). This is the subjective a-priori of consciousness; the buffer zone between the desire for stability and the ruthless demands of the real. In order to tell a story, the story of the Self, passionate reduction is inevitable. Some narra- tives, certainly, are better than others. But, given our existential inadequation with the Real, the act of passionate reduction per se is inevitable. In short "Passion reflects this discrepency between the metaphorical and the literal" (341). This rhetoric of the passions exhibits an underlying logic. It is the logic of the "Amalgam between properties and subjects of proper- ties, a logic of contagiousness and contiguity: x is a but "to be a" applies also to y, which is b, and then even to z and so on." (326). Muslims are our (e.g. Serbs) traditional enemies (x is a), this also applies to one named Mohammed who was my neighbor and dated my sister (to be a applies to y); being Muslim he should then be viewed as my mortal enemy, etc. Being a logic of substitution, the 937</page><page sequence="21">ESSAY-REVIEW amalgam can seem absurd to somebody looking at a rhetorical- historical situation from the outside. Indeed the discrepancy be- tween the literal and the figurative, which is the space of passion, can result in fantastic amalgams and substitutions. But it is only 'fantastic' to someone looking in from the outside; for the subject, however, this amalgam is eminently rational. Thus, amalgam and substitution result in syllogistic reasoning which in turn reveals the thorough subjectivity of perception and judgment. But beyond its rhetorical and logical aspects, passion should be understood in relation to existential problems. First is the notion of consciousness itself. Traditionally, two theories of consciousness have emerged: consciousness of the object (Descartes) and con- sciousness of the self (Romanticism). Between Classicism and Ro- manticism, the criterion of truth has been displaced from the Real to the self. The transparent consciousness implied in Descartes has the following problem: how is it possible at the same time for con- sciousness to be submerged irreflexively in the world and to have a critical consciousness of itself? There is a sequential time difference here that remains a perennial problem. Meyer locates this problem- atic time difference as the space where passion integrates a cohe- siveness to consciousness: "The temporal difference is the identity of consciousness. The unreflected consciousness is distinct from the consciousness of the self, while being the same, therefore conscious- ness, because it is not at the same instant that the return to the self and the forgetfulness of the self take place. Passion worms its way into this [temporal] discrepancy and reveals itself by this act as the time of consciousness. To live one's passion, is to live one's tempo- rality" (347). Passion is then the index of this hesitation between the absolute of the Real and the contingency of the subject. And here we see clearly why passion is so inextricably tied to the notion of time. The acceptance of one is a function of the acceptance of the other. For the Stoics "to conquer passion means abolishing time: [creating] a coincidence among the consciousness of the self and the consciousness of things external, and that time of their discrep- ancy [being] abolished. The unity of Reason gives man then a pre- sent without age, as if he wanted to extirpate himself from the flux of time" (347). Goldschmidt shows that Stoicism's entire project could be understood as a concentrated effort to cancel out the paradoxical and passionate whirlwind of time (i.e. we are either absorbed in regrets of the past or fear of the future, but never in touch with the present)17 and somehow to live in the eternal pre- 938</page><page sequence="22">MLN sent of the sage. According to Meyer, Stoicism here (as in so many other aspects) expresses in a forcefully dogmatic fashion the funda- mental human desire to see the problem of time and change neu- tralized in favor of an immutable logos (for the philosopher) or common sense (for the commoner). Much the same can be said about history: Plus ca change plus fa reste la mime chose says the popular proverb. The self strives to possess a stable identity, an autonomy vis-a-vis time and history. Passionately we erect an identity against time (348). To accomplish this feat there must be a denial of change, a denial of that which threatens my ego ideal. As we said, common sense and plausibility serve the function of erecting a fiction of timeless and history-less 'analytic' continuity. The stronger the culture, the more stable its consensus as to its consciousness of the real and its negotiation of the problem of means and ends in ethics. Strong cultures create a tight corre- spondence between questions and answers. Given that we are all today sons and daughters of Romanticism, Meyer is correct in insist- ing that this bon pensant sens commun is equally a passionate discourse to which subjects cling with as much passion as to any discourse of revolutionary rapture. But in the West the time when a Descartes could still imagine denying historical and temporal change is long gone (348).18 The acceleration of history has made it increasingly more difficult to deny what Meyer calls the shock of the real. From Cartesian passion for a mathesis universalis we pass to a Hegelian passion for History. The logos as it were changed optics from geometry to history. Increas- ingly the rupture between historical change and personal ethos becomes apparent. Cervantes writes the great novel of this rupture. It is the first great novel about the discrepancy between personal ethos and history, between questions of the self and answers of the Real.19 The novel, a specifically modern western phenomenon, be- comes the genre representing this passionate difference between individual consciousness and objective history. Passion then no longer functions mostly as a cultural homeostatic buffering mecha- nism but increasingly as the mark of the individual revolt against historical common sense: the passion of Madame Bovary against the passion of Monsieur Homais. The logic of passion governs three large domains: the rapport to the self (the story of the self), to the other (inter subjective con- sciousness) and to things (history, events, etc.) (380). A filter be- tween the subject and the real; a valve regulating their interaction; a 939</page><page sequence="23">ESSAY-REVIEW rampart against the passage of time, change, history; a catalyst of change, knowledge, quest; a source of automatic answers and the origin of revolutionary questions; an inter subjective "hell"-these are its paradoxical realities and functions. Paradoxical, because no one single proposition could conceptualize passion's essence. We can not say that passion is A and not -A thereby creating its identity. Starting with the paradox of the Meno, Meyer shows that each time propositionalism deals with passion, the result is inevitably paradox- ical. Passion has a rhetorical and not a propositional reality: it "works with the conflict between propositions".20 To seize the reality of passion, its multiple facets must be brought to the surface. But because it is so often for us a concept of projection-"I am reason- able, you are passionate"-we are blind to the pervasiveness of pas- sion. Meyer's contention is that we must first critique propositional thought, showing that while it is adequate for most scientific reason- ing, it falls short in the understanding of human contingency. Second, within a rhetorical framework that is eminently rational, but not propositional, using pragmatics, language theory, rhetoric, psychology, phenomenology, it is possible to conceptualize passion without falling into the traditional philosophical trap of seeing it as the other of Reason, as the obstacle which humanity, if it is to "grow up" must surmount. Passion for Meyer is the specificity of humanity: "Passion is, because we are, and must be" (380). In sum, Nussbaum's neo-Aristotelian critique of anti-founda- tionalism has two unhappy results: first, an endorsement of a specifi- cally Greek form of rationalism, to the exclusion of all others; second, the (perhaps unintended) re-activation of the age-old meta- physical opposition between logos and pathos. Meyer, on the other hand, seeks to form a new rationality which, by its problematologi- cal foundation and openness to rhetoric and linguistics, circum- vents the problems of propositionalism. Meyer's analysis of passion is the fruit of a close empirical study of contingency. Within this optic, passion assumes a positive role-it is the mark of humanity, Reason being but one of its manifestations. To be sure, neither Nussbaum nor Meyer (nor perhaps anybody else) can account within their schemes of passion for the Augustinian-Freudian prob- lematics of absolute evil-so pertinent to this twentieth century. Nevertheless, Meyer's "problematology" of passion represents a se- rious attempt to bridge the gulfs between philosophy, literature and science.21 If passion is no longer seen as the enemy, philosophy, 940</page><page sequence="24">MLN literature and criticism may at last recognize each other as mani- festations of a shared problematic-Passion.
