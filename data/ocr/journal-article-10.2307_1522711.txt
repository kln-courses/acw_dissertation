The dated label of a Delhi bookbinder, Nizam ul Huq, affixed to the inside of the manuscript's modern cover makes it likely that Hanna purchased the Raimayana manuscript in I886 or shortly before. The Rdmaiyana was unquestionably the centerpiece of a collection of manuscripts and paintings assembled during Hanna's tour of thirty years in India.2 European travellers and collectors had no opportunity to see original imperial manuscripts in this era, and they routinely trumpeted their newfound treasures with rather more enthusiasm than knowledge. Hanna offered a typically exalted view of the Raimadyana, claiming that The book contains 129 full-page miniatures, exquisitely drawn and illu- minated in the highest style of Persian art, far superior to anything in the keeping of the British Museum, or the South Kensington Museum, or amongst the Oriental manuscripts in India House. The Emperor Akbar's, Shahjahan's, and Shah Alam's seals are affixed to the first and last pages. The work and the paintings are signed by the artists. The Jeypore Razm Nama, which is a little larger, cost Akbar more than ?40,000. This great work, like the Jeypore Razm Nama, was probably stolen from the palace at Agra when the Jats plundered that city in the eighteenth century.3 Elsewhere in the catalogue, Hanna erroneously wrote that the artists of his manuscript were listed in the A'n-i Akbar? (Annals of Akbar) and that the I69 miniatures of the Jaipur Razmndma (Book of Wars) were by the same artists.4 Hanna also maintained that his copy of the Ramayana was commissioned by Akbar (reigned 1556-I605), who, he believed, must have spent at least ?20,000 to have it produced.5 This grandiose estimation must have made the purchase of the manu- script on October 24, I907, by the Detroit industrialist Charles Lang Freer (I854-1919) for ?I,ooo seem quite a bargain.6 A I916 inventory list for the new museum that would bear Freer's name places the insurance value of the man- uscript at $Io,ooo, twice that of the purchase price. At the same time, the number of miniatures listed as being in the manuscript quietly increased to 130, a correction of Hanna's earlier mistabulation. Though Vincent Smith (1848-I920) had seen only a few of Hanna's paint- ings in reproduction, he extolled their merit in a brief article in I9I0, but re- 9</page><page sequence="8">sponded to Hanna's boastful claims by stating that the Dara Shikuh and John- son Albums in the India Office Library, which he had examined, were at least as good as any Mughal painting in Hanna's collection.7 Smith also lamented that the Rdamyana manuscript had not been purchased by a museum in Eng- land or India, despite Hanna's low asking price. Notwithstanding a gradual increase in the interest in Indian painting over the next four decades, the Freer Rdamyazna remained unnoticed by the scholarly world until I96I, when Richard Ettinghausen (I906-79), curator of Islamic art at the Freer Gallery, reproduced two of its finest paintings in a slen- der but serious picture book of Indian paintings.8 His two entries drew atten- tion to the flyleaf note written by the Khankhanan or commander-in-chief of the Mughal armies, 'Abd al-Rahim, who supplied a starting date of A.H. 996/A.D. I587-88 and a completion date of I007/I598-99. Disregarding Hanna's exuberant claims that the manuscript belonged to Akbar himself, Ettinghausen used the evidence of the flyleaf note to assert that the Freer man- uscript was commissioned by 'Abd al-Rahim Khankhanan as a direct copy of the imperial Ramayana manuscript. Ettinghausen reasoned further that since the imperial manuscript would not have left the capital, which at this time was Lahore, the copy must have been produced at the capital as well; hence, he dis- missed the relevance of the Khankhanan's assignments to various provinces of the empire in determining the provenance of the manuscript. Listing twelve artists whose names were ascribed on fifty paintings, Ettinghausen noted that their names did not appear among the seventeen imperial artists mentioned in the A'in-i Akbari, and concluded that they must have constituted a workshop separate from the imperial atelier. Each of the ascribed miniatures in the Rdmdyana named a single artist, a fact which led Ettinghausen to differentiate the working method of this independent workshop from that of the imperial atelier, which generally assigned two or more artists to each illustration. Ettinghausen's observations on the art historical issues presented by 'Abd al-Rahim's copy of the Ramayana have served as the basis for all subse- quent discussion of the manuscript.9 The most substantive work on the Ramaya.na to follow was the I98I exhibition catalogue of the Freer Gallery's collection of Indian painting, The Imperial Image, in which Milo Beach repro- duced twenty-two pages and the flyleaf along with comparative paintings from a few other manuscripts associated with the Khankhanan.'? In relating the stories of the Ramdyana illustrations, comparing a single example of the different narrative and stylistic concerns of the illustrations of'Abd al-Rahim's copy with those of the imperial manuscript, and summarizing all that was known of the artists in 'Abd al-Rahim's atelier, Beach raised many of the is- sues explored in this study. About that time I began to lay the groundwork for a comprehensive study of the manuscript, which became the focus of my doctoral dissertation. In so doing, I was fortunate enough to discover a number of new dates in the manuscript, some of which I published in I985 as part of my study of imperial 10</page><page sequence="9">and subimperial Mughal copies of the Razmndma, the Persian translation of the Mahdbhharata." More recently, others have used the illustrations of the Freer manuscript to grace a lavishly produced retelling of the Radmdayana with a devotional orientation which blissfully ignores the historical dimensions of the manuscript and its Persian text.12 Hidden within the Rdmdyana manuscript are innumerable traces of the processes by which the book came into its original and present state. Our task as historians is to uncover and decipher these clues as best we can. Accordingly, in addition to developing the contextual aspects of 'Abd al-Rahim's Rd- mdyana, I have followed the lead of L.M.J. Delaisse in undertaking an "archae- ological" study of the manuscript - an approach still rarely applied to Asian manuscripts - and have meticulously examined the Freer Rdmadyana as an ob- ject, poring over every aspect of the manuscript in an effort to understand the impact of contemporary painters, scribes, and owners upon the book.13 This kind of investigation has the obvious benefit of making one very familiar with the manuscript, so that hitherto undetected or neglected ascriptions, labels, and dates seem to leap out from the folios. Our experience of the Rdmdyana is enriched as we come to understand the subtleties of the creative and pragmatic decisions involved in the composition and writing of its text, and the formu- lation and execution of the imagery of its many illustrations. We cannot hope to recreate fully the conditions under which the manuscript was initially pro- duced and used, but at the very least we will become more aware of our own historical and aesthetic assumptions as we compare them to the responses of the privileged few who recorded their impressions of the manuscript and its artists in earlier times. The focus upon the Freer Rdmdyana and other manuscripts associated with 'Abd al-Rahim introduces three major issues of Indian painting. First, the manuscripts associated with this high-ranking noble constitute the most coherent corpus of Mughal painting produced for a patron outside the imper- ial family. This allows us to assess the role of artists dismissed by the imperial atelier in the creation of a transitional style of Indian painting, broadly called Popular Mughal painting, which ultimately disseminated Mughal concepts and forms to regional schools of painting in India. Second, the avowed rela- tionship between the imperial manuscript of the Rdmdyana and 'Abd al- Rahim's copy, separated by only a decade, presents an opportunity to examine how a group of artists outside the imperial atelier responded to the existence of a specific imperial model. Finally, the extensive written and visual docu- mentation for the paintings produced by 'Abd al-Rahim's atelier invites com- parison to the imperial workshop. Limited to a single patron, a period of some thirty years, and only a handful of manuscripts, this body of material affords an ideal test case to interpret variations in the style of painting. In short, what meaning did the subject matter and style of these manuscript illustrations hold for this seventeenth-century patron and his artists? 11</page><page sequence="10">Notes I Catalogue of Indo-Persian Pictures and Manuscripts Collected by Colonel H.B.

Although cus- tom forbad the use of images in religious texts, the courtly tradition in the Is- lamic world had long encouraged the collection of lavishly illuminated copies of secular texts. Several of the manuscripts discussed here illustrate standard poetical works of classical Persian literature, which celebrate age-old themes of love, heroism, and national destiny. Another moves beyond the epic genre of the Shdhndma (Book of Kings), a time-honored text which glorifies the lin- eage and feats of ancient Persian kings, to recount in historical fashion the achievements of the more immediate past. This interest in the particulars of history, so at odds with fundamental Indian notions of time and the individ- ual, manifested itself to an unprecedented degree in the I58os and 590os in a se- ries of illustrated historical accounts of the Mughal dynasty and its ancestors right up through the reign of Akbar himself. Of central concern here, however, is another important type of text tran- scribed and illustrated in the Mughal library establishment. This was the newly commissioned translations of ancient Indian literature into Persian, long the court language of Muslim kingdoms in India. Such a cross-cultural interest in Indian learning was not without precedent in the Islamic world in general, and particularly at the Sultanate courts of north India. The renowned thirteenth-century poet Amir Khusraw Dihlawi, for example, had extolled the achievements of his Indian compatriots in astrology, mathematics, language, and music. Despite periodic bouts of iconoclasm, Firtuz Shah Tughlaq (reigned 1351-88) had also recognized the erudition of both religious and secular Indian texts and ordered the translation of specific works on astrology and astronomy. The keen interest in the Indian wealth of pragmatic knowledge continued under Sikandar Lodi (reigned 1489-I517), whose reign saw the translation of a highly esteemed Sanskrit medical treatise.' And at the outset of the Mughal period, the Hitopadesa, an ancient Indian compilation of animal parables, was translated into Persian and dedicated to Akbar's father, Humayiun (reigned 1530-I542, I550-I556).2 During Akbar's reign (1556-I605), however, the sporadic translation of Hindu works became a sustained rush; indeed, the number and breadth of In- dian texts translated in the enormous imperial library indicate the new earnestness with which the Mughals approached the intellectual storehouse of 13</page><page sequence="12">the subcontinent. Learned brahmans were summoned to interpret Sanskrit texts for the leading scholars of the court, who then produced loose Persian translations of the Sanskrit originals. Working sometimes individually, some- times collectively, scholars such as Abu al-Fazl, his brother Shaykh Fayzl, Bada'iun, and Ibrahim Sirhindi introduced to the Mughal court texts as var- ied as the Artharva Veda, a text on magic and rituals, the Lildvati (The Play- ing One), a mathematical treatise, the romance of Nala Damayanti, the Rd- jatarangini, a twelfth-century history of Kashmir, and the Simhdsanadvatrimsfat and Kathd Saritsdgara (The Ocean from the Rivers of Story-Telling), two col- lections of stories.3 While the scientific and belletristic genres had formed the core of Persian translations of Sanskrit literature in earlier times, works of Hindu philosoph- ical and religious lore began to attract the attention of the Mughal court in the I58os. The emperor's personal inclination to religious speculation was so wide- ranging in scope that in 1579 Akbar proclaimed his own eclectic faith, the Din-i Ilahl, which several members of the court accepted as their own. In keep- ing with this climate of non-sectarianism, the translation bureau undertook the translation of Hindu devotional texts such as the Bhagavad Gitd (Song of the Lord) and the Harivamsa (Genealogy of Krsna), as well as the Yjgavdsistha, an exposition of Vedanta philosophy, and the great Hindu epics of the Mahd- bhdrata and the Rdmdyana. In his unofficial and often critical history of Akbar's reign, the Muntakhab al-Tawdrikh, the chronicler Bada'uni offered this assess- ment of Akbar's interest in these venerable texts: Now he ordered those Hindu books, which holy and staid sages had writ- ten, and were all clear and convincing proofs, and which were the very pivot on which all their religion, and faith, and holiness turned, to be translated from the Indian into the Persian language, and thought to himself, "Why should I not have them done in my name? For they are by no means trite, but quite fresh, and they will produce all kinds of fruits of felicity both temporal and spiritual, and will be the cause of circum- stance and pomp, and will ensure an abundance of children and wealth, as is written in the preface of these books."4 Abu al-Fazl, whose role as official chronicler led him to cast all of Akbar's ac- tions in the most flattering light, gave voice to this same sentiment in his in- troduction to the Razmnama (Book of Wars), as the Persian translation of the Mahdbhdrata was called. Unlike Bada'ini, however, he expressed a willingness to overlook some of the perceived factual errors of the epic Hindu text so that its readers could benefit from the broad wisdom of its stories: Although this work contains numerous extravagant tales and fictions based on imagination, it affords many instructive moral observations, and is an ample record of felicitous experience.5 14</page><page sequence="13">A second, but no less important motive for the translation of Hindu works was the emperor's desire to promote social harmony: Having observed the fanatical hatred between the Hindus and the Mus- lims and being convinced that it arose only from mutual ignorance, the enlightened monarch wished to dispel the same by rendering the books of the former accessible to the latter.6 Because the effectiveness of this policy rested on an unbiased presentation of Hindu thought, Akbar strove to ensure the accuracy of the translations. Hav- ing forced Bada'uni, a devout Muslim who could not abide the emperor's fas- cination with Hindu affairs, to participate in the two-year project of translat- ing the Mahabhdrata, Akbar occasionally called upon him to defend passages which seemed to impose a Muslim interpretation on the translation; in one case, he accused Bada'iun of misrepresenting a subtle philosophical point of the Hindu belief in metempsychosis, the ability of a soul to pass from one body to another, a belief which Akbar himself embraced.7 This kind of review did not stop Bada'uni from denigrating the subject of his labors. He considered the Rdamyana superior to the Mahabhdrata, but privately decried both texts for the pointlessness of their stories and their lack of historical truthfulness, specifically in their mention of eras whose antiquity exceeded the 7,000-year period at which Muslims placed Adam and the be- ginning of the human race.8 He even feared that his involvement in their trans- lation might result in damnation.9 Despite the religious reservations of Bada'uni and probably a good number of his orthodox Muslim contempo- raries, the translation of Hindu literature continued unabated throughout Akbar's reign. Several of these newly translated Hindu texts were furnished with illustrations, whose imagery must have been powerful aids in fixing the entertaining and exemplary behavior of the ancient heroes and sages of India in the minds of their new courtly audience. The Formation of the Mughal Style Just as the Mughals' decision to tap the philosophical and literary heritage of India continued a long tradition of cultural appropriation, so too did their pro- found cultivation of painting build upon a longstanding appreciation of the visual arts in both the Persian-speaking world and northern India. Literary sources testify to the once-flourishing practice of adorning the surfaces of palaces and temples with painting. Our knowledge of the ancient Indian mural tradition is woefully inadequate, however, being limited to a few sites with fragmentary remains, of which the fifth-century rock-cut caves at Ajanta and the twelfth-century monastery at Alchi are the best-known examples. Small illustrated copies of the sacred books of Buddhists, Jainas, and Hindus were less vulnerable to the vicissitudes of harsh weather and human destruc- tion, and so have been preserved in much greater numbers in examples dated 15</page><page sequence="14">I.

We can surmise that they worked on commission for anyone with the resources and desire for their services. To judge from the remarkable stylistic consistency of painting executed across much of northern India throughout the late fifteenth and six- teenth century, it appears that individual patrons had little effect on the style of painting employed by these artists. Paintings most often took the shape of a series of loose leaves, almost al- ways horizontal in orientation, which were placed between decorated wooden covers but not otherwise bound. Images gradually displaced the written word on the folio over the course of the fifteenth century. In fact, written informa- tion was soon relegated to the form of a short caption above or below the paint- ing, or a somewhat longer selection of verses on the reverse. A page from a dispersed manuscript of the Bhagavata Purana of circa I520 represents the indigenous Indian tradition at its best (fig. I). The young Krsna subjugates a demon who has assumed the form of a terrifying whirlwind; fresh from his conquest, the blue-skinned deity reappears before his mother. Both events transpire in a single plane, which is broken up by a simple architectural structure and three different colored backgrounds. These devices isolate the compact groups of female onlookers, whose large eyes, blockish profiles, cur- vaceous bodies, and richly patterned skirts are constant features of this style. 16</page><page sequence="15">2. A school scene. By Mir Sayyid 'All. ca. 1540. Arthur M. Sackler Gallery of Art S86.022I. 27 x I5.I cm. The rhythmic poses of the repeated figures, the vigorous draftsmanship, and the juxtaposition of solid patches of bright color combine to produce an image of enormous visual appeal and immediacy. The dominance that this kind of work held in the spectrum of painting in northern India was shattered by the arrival of a political force which was to change Indian culture forever. Led by Babur (1483-I530), the Mughals made a series of thrusts from Kabul into India, culminating in their crushing defeat of the forces of Ibrahim Lodi, ruler of the largest of the Muslim kingdoms, near Delhi in I526. Babur's subsequent victory over an alliance of Rajput kings en- couraged him to press ever deeper into the Gangetic Valley, and to establish a permanent presence in India. Babur sought to transform the area he controlled - which he considered inhospitable - with gardens and architecture styled after those in his Central Asian homeland. It is very likely that painting was also part of this infusion of Timurid culture. In his memoirs Babur alludes to various ancestors' ability in writing and painting, and comments succinctly on the skill of a few professional Persian artists. These scattered observations tes- tify to Babur's awareness of painting as a mark of cultivation, but furnish no clue as to the amount or nature of painting sponsored by Babur himself. Far more certain are the changes ushered into India during the reign of Babur's son and successor, Humayun. Upon suffering a series of defeats at the hands of Sher Shah Suir, an Afghan ruler who established a rival kingdom in northern India, Humayun was forced to take refuge at the court of the Safawid ruler Shah Tahmasp in Persia in I543-44. Humayun's interest in art must have been whetted as he beheld the magnificent illustrated books produced by Shah Tahmasp's atelier, the largest and most accomplished in the Islamic world at the time. By good fortune, Tahmasp's lifelong patronage of painting had begun to flag, and he agreed to allow two younger members of the atelier, Mir Sayyid 'Ali and 'Abd al-Samad, to accompany Humayun on his return to India. Humayun took advantage of the death of Sher Shah in I545 and the fractious condition of his opponents to regain his empire about I554, but died soon af- terward in an accidental fall down the steps of his library. Both Humayun and his son Akbar encouraged the newly acquired artists to establish a painting workshop on the scale of the Safawid model. The handful of paintings attributed to either Mir Sayyid 'All or 'Abd al- Samad in Persia provide a clear idea of the artistic heritage brought to India by the Persian masters. In one of these, a scene of the bustle of activities in a schoolyard, Mir Sayyid 'Ali uses a patchwork of brilliantly colored areas to or- ganize the composition in a manner typical of Persian painting (fig. 2). To- gether with the elaborate patterns of tiles, carpets, and mats, this geometric framework discourages any attempt to read the painting as a single, spatially unified entity. Instead, it invites the viewer to meander among the painting's many discrete passages, pausing to dwell on the exquisite detail and the ab- stract beauty of color and line in each. The figures, who appear first as yet an- other set of colored shapes, also contribute to the compartmentalization of the 17</page><page sequence="16">scene by their arrangement in simple pairs or in small groups united by glance and gesture. Through his witty observation of the foibles of human behavior, Mir Sayyid 'All breathed new life into the well-established types of Persian painting, and encouraged viewers to delight in anecdotes such as the prepara- tion of paper, the copying of lessons, or the punishment of a wayward pupil. Mir Sayyid 'All and 'Abd al-Samad fostered in the fledgling Mughal ate- lier many elements of Safawid art. Foremost among these was an appreciation of fine draftsmanship and meticulous application of colors, qualities often ab- sent from the more roughly executed paintings of the Indian tradition. Stan- dard Persian compositions were adapted for the ubiquitous courtyard, audi- ence, and battle scenes. The Persian architectural construction of tall decorative screens enclosing a shallow hexagonal space was altered only slightly in Mughal depictions of buildings. Similarly, the Safawid formula of rendering landscapes as a series of overlapping pastel-colored, fan-shaped zones culminating in a high horizon became the foundation of nearly all early Mughal landscape scenes. Such stock Persian figures as willowy, beardless youths, heavily bearded elders, and lithe females, all depicted in typical three- quarter view, were also easily transplanted into painting produced in the emerging Mughal empire. Yet practically from its very inception, Mughal painting incorporated some overtly Indian elements as well. A few local features had appeared in Per- sianate manuscripts illustrated under the auspices of Muslim rulers in Mandu, Bengal, and the Deccan from the late fifteenth century on, but generally these had been limited to slight differences in the palette, the occasional misunder- standings of Persian conventions, and the use of Indian conventions in the de- piction of some women. Indigenous Indian elements became far more pronounced in Mughal painting. Local features began to intrude upon well-established visual con- ventions: Indian plants cropped up in Persianate fields and gardens, indige- nous creatures were admitted to ranks of the pictorial animal kingdom, and dark-skinned figures, commonly associated with India, assumed a much broader range of roles.?0 The traditional Indian female type in profile view, pre- sent sporadically in Islamic painting in India for more than half a century, be- came more common, and was occasionally accompanied by male figures with the typically squat proportions and angular profiles of indigenous painting. No matter what their source, Mughal figures seem more animated than their Persian or Indian counterparts, an effect achieved primarily through a set of in- creasingly explicit and individualized facial expressions, and secondarily through ever more demonstrative poses and gestures. Mughal artists also were inclined to temper the Persian predilection for brilliant, pure hues with earth- ier tones and rudimentary modeling. Artists trained in local Indian traditions occasionally reverted to old habits of distributing hot colors in large flat patches uninterrupted by the minute patterns in which Persian-trained artists characteristically reveled. 18</page><page sequence="17">. ~^ ^ ^t j I' ' ' .... .. ... 13.

As early as the i56os, European emissaries and missionaries brought to India as curiosities and religious propaganda examples of European prints, which made their way into the hands of imperial artists and began to inspire a modest suggestion of the effect of light on form, a notion completely alien to both the Persian and Indian traditions. By the end of the sixteenth cen- tury, a number of Mughal artists had absorbed some European conventions for the rendering of volume and pictorial depth, and had conveyed the usefulness of such devices to some of their fellow artists. Shortly after the beginning of the seventeenth century, other Mughal painters had even begun to adopt elements of European symbolic vocabulary. Nevertheless, European art remained a minor component of Mughal art because it was a fundamentally deracinated style. Imitated rather than practiced, it could not compete with the continu- ous stream of artists from Persia and the regions surrounding the Mughal cap- ital who shaped the course of painting produced at the imperial atelier. The application of rudimentary modeling to faces and the contours of garments in Mughal painting lends Mughal figures a decidedly more physical quality than their somewhat ethereal counterparts in Persian painting. The very familiarity of these conventions of modeling, which are drawn from the Western artistic tradition, has led many Western scholars to see in Mughal painting a naturalism rooted firmly in objective reality, which marked a radi- cal departure from the Persian tradition in both form and spirit. This new vi- sion is widely attributed directly to the influence of the vigorous Akbar, only thirteen years old upon his accession to the throne in I556. Indeed, most ac- counts of Mughal painting have focused squarely on the emperor's dynamic, inquisitive personality as the driving force behind its formal innovations, a view whose shortcomings will be made apparent throughout this study. The initial fusion of Persian, Indian, and European art seems to have oc- curred in a remarkably short period of time, approximately I56o-65. A single manuscript, the ..Tu.tinma (Tales of a Parrot) now in the Cleveland Museum of Art, was long held to be the key to the critical formative stage of Mughal paint- ing (fig. 3).IISome of its 2i8 illustrations are rendered in a fully realized Mughal style, while others show only a few elements of the new Mughal style com- bined with the earlier indigenous traditions. Thus, the variety of styles in the ..Tu.indma appeared to demonstrate the process of assimilating painters with different artistic backgrounds into the imperial atelier. This analysis of the Tu.t.ndma has recently been undermined, however, by the discovery that nearly two-thirds of the illustrations in the Tu.tindma are painted over an incomplete layer of paintings in the Sultanate or Candayana tradition.'2 Examination of the manuscript under infra-red light has revealed that some artists retained the composition and other features of the underlying Sultanate paintings and reworked only the faces and costumes. In Figure 3, for example, the artist retained the two-tiered composition together with the dec- 19</page><page sequence="18">orative valance and columns, but changed the throne from its original squar- ish shape to a much narrower one with a hexagonal base and tall throneback. The discoloration around several figures reveals the changes made in their po- sitions and repainted faces and clothing. The revelation that all of the pure Candayana-style elements in the manuscript are actually vestiges of the earlier layer of painting compels us to see much of the variety of style in the .T.tindma not as a function of the atelier's recent incomplete assimilation of its new mem- bers, but rather as a function of the degree of overpainting in the manuscript. This discovery has several implications which are particularly relevant to this survey of the development and later diffusion of Mughal painting. First, the assimilation of artists trained in other traditions to an established Mughal workshop involved many fewer individuals than we once thought, probably no more than a half-dozen or so. Although an important indigenous Indian style (known as the Caurapaficasika style and seen in fig. I) is quite pronounced in a few ..T.tinama illustrations, it was infused only slowly into the mainstream of the Mughal style, and soon vanished as a distinct entity. Second, it is significant that when Mughal artists were content to limit their repainting of the existing Candayana-style illustrations in the ..T.tinma, they focused primarily on the faces and costumes of the main figures. We may surmise that these features were considered the critical aspects of the Mughal style, for they persisted in every variety of painting derived from the imperial Mughal idiom long after other original features were eliminated or greatly simplified. Third, the ..Tt.Fnama, redated to circa 1570, no longer stands out as an ex- ample of a wide range of contemporary but disparate styles being employed in a single manuscript. This pattern is more in keeping with the homogeneous style employed in the illustrations of two early Mughal manuscripts, a poeti- cal text of the romance of Duwal Rani and Khizr Khan dated I568 and the Anwdr-i Suhayli, a book of animal fables dated 1570. Moreover, it demonstrates the strong leveling function of the imperial painting workshop itself, which was able to impose a coherent style even on artists who had little or no experi- ence working together. Mughal Painting during the Reigns of Akbar andJahdngir Together with literary references, contemporary ascriptions written in the lower margins of the illustrations establish that ranks of the workshop grew from approximately thirty painters at the time of the colossal Hamzandma pro- ject of circa I557-72 to about 130 artists by the mid 590os. The atelier's tremen- dous increase in size made possible a significant expansion of its annual pro- duction, which included illustrated manuscripts, individual paintings, and designs for other objects made in Mughal workshops. Because the variety and amount of activity obviously necessitated collaborative efforts, the atelier de- veloped a relatively fluid hierarchy which allocated tasks, maintained stan- dards of quality, and ensured the timely completion of concurrent projects. 20</page><page sequence="19">Certain artists were usually charged with the design of illustrations, while the actual application of colors was given over to less accomplished or more junior members of the atelier. Visual evidence suggests that master artists also had a hand in the most important details of the painting, which seem to have in- cluded some faces, although extended ascriptions also attest that on occasion this duty fell to still other artists who specialized in portraiture. The two Per- sian founders of the atelier, Mir Sayyid 'Ali and 'Abd al-Samad, supervised in turn the fifteen-year production of the I400 paintings of the .Hamzandma. Other projects were probably assigned to the guidance of various officials of the library or workshop who performed the role of deputy supervisors. The extent to which these supervisors affected the selection of texts, scenes, and artists is slowly becoming better understood. The discovery of a growing number of scribal notes dictating the subject of the painting, the number of days to be allocated to it, and the date by which it was to be com- pleted indicates the many levels of authority within the atelier and the specific decisions made within the atelier itself.I3 One measure of the control exercised at the level of the individual manuscript project is the general consistency of the style used across all the illustrations of a given manuscript. It now seems clear that the atelier deliberately produced different kinds of illustrated manuscripts. Certain types of texts, such as the dynastic histories and Hindu religious texts that dominated the I58os and I590s, were habitually large-scale undertakings, both in the number and size of illustrations. Persian poetical texts were almost always smaller affairs, usually decorated with fewer but more refined images produced by artists working alone. Multiple copies were made of both types of texts, occasionally with obvious differences in qual- ity. These distinctions of subject and quality did not correspond to further ones involving choices in overall style, as we will see that they did in sub- imperial painting. Instead, imperial painters involved in every kind of project availed themselves of the most recent developments in style, with the often markedly different levels of success apparently depending primarily on the amount of time and talent they were able to invest. The formal changes in painting produced during the last thirty years of Akbar's reign built upon earlier developments. Artists began to create pock- ets of deep space in the upper reaches of the compositions described earlier by employing an abruptly graduated figure scale and the European device of at- mospheric perspective, which reduced distant ranges of tiny trees to tints of blue and green; by the 1590os, these areas were integrated regularly with the foreground and middleground, in which the action transpired. Mughal painters also continued to elaborate the volumetric rendering of form, partic- ularly in clothing and architecture, and expanded the range of facial expres- sions. The complexion of Mughal painting changed more dramatically during the reign of Jahangir (I605-27). Jahangir (then known as Salim) had suc- cumbed to thoughts of rebellion during his exceptionally long tenure as crown 21</page><page sequence="20">prince. After a bid to take control of Agra in his father's absence was thwarted in I6oo, Jahangir withdrew eastward to Allahabad, where he defiantly pro- claimed himself shah (king). He remained estranged from the imperial court until I604, when he was finally reconciled with his ageing father. The estab- lishment of an independent court required customary cultural appurtenances, including a painting studio. Ascriptions on the handful of manuscripts asso- ciated with this four-year period at Allahabad suggest that Jahangir's atelier was relatively small, numbering approximately five artists, several of whom were Persian emigres.14 Upon his accession, Jahangir promoted a host of new trends in the impe- rial atelier. One of the most important was a reinvigorated taste for Persian subjects and styles, spearheaded by the artists who had accompanied him from Allahabad. This more delicate taste was perfectly suited to the series of poeti- cal manuscripts that occupied the imperial atelier for most of the first five years of Jahangir's reign. Historical and Hindu subjects virtually disappeared from the range of texts to be illustrated; indeed, the production of individual paint- ings soon supplanted the illustration of any kind of manuscript as the focus of the atelier's efforts. Paradoxically, the renewed cultivation of the lyrical qualities of Persian painting coincided with an unprecedented outburst of naturalism. A meticu- lous observation of physiognomic subtleties informs most paintings produced during Jahangir's reign, but portraiture, which had grown from a minor genre in the I58os to a major one by I6Io, was easily the most dramatic expression of this impulse. The emperor became a frequent subject of his painters, who de- picted him either engaged in activities traditionally associated with rulership - feasting, hunting, or receiving homage - or in innovative allegorical guises emphasizing his unwavering dedication to justice and religion. From these overtly propagandistic images and the many paintings and manuscripts inscribed byJahangir, scholars have concluded that Jahangir's pa- tronage of art was far more personal than his father's. Jahangir himself offers tes- timony to this effect, asserting that he was able to distinguish one master's hand from another, even down to details such as the eyes and eyebrows on a face.'5 Even if we take the emperor at his word and grant him this remarkable degree of aesthetic sensibility, we must also acknowledge that this kind of patronage is truly exceptional in the annals of Indian and Persian history. Instead, swayed by the similarity of this connoisseurship to modern art historical practices, many scholars have eagerly projected Jahangir's inclination and ability onto pa- trons of all stripes, so that acute visual awareness and sustained personal inter- vention have become the primary model in the study of patronage in Indian art. The Diffusion of Painting in the Imperial Mughal Style We can put this model of patronage to the test by considering the production of painting for patrons other than the reigning Mughal emperors. Although the documentation for a broader range of patrons at the Mughal court is more 22</page><page sequence="21">extensive than it is for many other dynasties, the situation is hardly unique, for possession of a library was a traditional mark of culture in the Islamic world. Manuscripts embellished with illustrations or non-figural illuminations would have enhanced the value of books treasured as repositories of knowl- edge. Nonetheless, painting was an art to be enjoyed discreetly, for image- making had long been condemned as idolatry by the Muslim orthodoxy. Akbar summoned a traditional defense for his avid interest in painting, claim- ing that the art did not challenge God's role as creator, but rather heightened one's awareness of God as the supreme maker: There are many that hate painting, but such men I dislike. It appears to me as if a painter had quite peculiar means of recognizing God; for a painter in sketching anything that has life, and in devising its limbs, one after the other, must come to feel that he cannot bestow individuality upon his work, and is thus forced to think of God, the giver of life, and will thus increase in knowledge.'6 Such pious protestations may have deflected the most vehement criticism aimed at Akbar's support of painting by the religious zealots of the Mughal court, but it is very doubtful that this kind of religious sentiment or philo- sophical speculation ever outweighed sheer entertainment as a motivation for the emperor's cultivation of the visual arts.17 This is all the more true of his im- mediate entourage, who, occupying much less prominent positions in society, probably escaped the threat of such religious censure altogether. Indeed, no more powerful rationale for their behavior could be found than the emperor's example itself. Thus, whether for reasons of social fashion, conspicuous self- promotion, or sincere interest in literature and painting, some members of the Mughal nobility and merchant class set out to imitate imperial sponsorship of the arts, and began to collect and commission the same types of manuscripts produced in the imperial atelier. Whatever the reasons for the newfound interest in painting, patrons without access to the imperial workshop sought out artists who could produce acceptable versions of the paintings made at the Mughal court. The logical source of such talent was artists who had once been trained in the Mughal style, but no longer worked in the imperial atelier. Just as artists had once flocked to the capital from all parts of the country in search of fortune, they also returned from the imperial court to regional centers maintained by Mughal nobles and feudatories. Contemporary literary sources are silent on the causes of this re- verse migration, but most scholars believe that it was governed by aesthetic criteria, with artists whose talent did not meet the exacting imperial standards being discharged from imperial employ. That many works presumed to be by these artists display features common in the imperial style of about 1580 makes it likely that the first dismissal of artists occurred about this time, but the most important winnowing of the imperial atelier undoubtedly took place around 23</page><page sequence="22">i600. The emphasis on fewer but finer paintings under Jahangir brought about a further reduction in the size of the atelier from approximately I30 artists in the I590S to as few as twenty-five by I615. Numerous examples of the art produced by former employees of the im- perial atelier and sponsored by this class of patrons appeared between I590 and I620. This new variant of Mughal painting was first distinguished from im- perial Mughal art by Pramod Chandra, who coined the term "Popular Mughal" art to denote the breadth of its class of patrons and its derivative re- lationship to imperial Mughal painting.'8 Other authors have proposed the al- ternative terms of "provincial Mughal" painting to indicate the alleged geo- graphical distance from the capital,I9 or "subimperial Mughal" to draw attention to the social status of patrons just outside the pale of the imperial family.20 By virtue of tradition and its inherent scope, the term "Popular Mughal" remains the most useful word to describe the myriad offshoots of this style; "subimperial Mughal" will be reserved here for works which are firmly or plausibly associated with members of the Mughal nobility. The i598-99 Razmndma In the absence of a dedicatory inscription or owner's seal on a given painting in the Mughal style, how can we ever know the patron's identity or social standing? Students of Indian art will immediately recognize mainstream ex- amples of the imperial style, whose development during the reigns of Akbar and Jahangir is readily charted around plentiful examples of inscribed and dated manuscripts. Yet alongside these well-known and well-documented Mughal works are many others whose origins are more difficult to ascertain. As these works drift further away from established reference points, our confidence in stylistic comparisons grows more tentative, and it soon becomes clear that the formal criteria that lead us to consider an unascribed work to be outside the bounds of imperial painting are often unspeakably subjective. One example which highlights the uncertain parameters of imperial Mughal painting is a widely dispersed Razmndma manuscript dated I007/ I598-99, the earliest of the four known illustrated copies of the Razmndma pre- pared in the aftermath of Akbar's own illustrated manuscript of the Razm- ndma, which was completed in I586.21 The I598-99 Razmndma does not attain the physical and creative standards achieved by many imperial manuscripts of the I590S, such as the I596-97 Akbarndma divided between the British Library and the Chester Beatty Library in Dublin. The difference is readily apparent in two representative works (figs. 4-5). The thin, brittle paper of the Razmndma barely supports its lightly painted images; the Akbarndma's sturdier folios match the luster of its illustrations, which usually are richly painted and highly burnished. This qualitative difference continues in aesthetic choices as 4. Krsna reconciles Yudhisthira and Arjuna. By Fattu. 1598-99 Razmndma. Ashmolean Museum I978.2590. 22 x I3 cm. well. Fattu, the artist of the Razmndma page (fig. 4), begins the spatial sim- plification of his scene by ridding the courtyard of its foreground wall.

Private collection, Paris. 22.8 x 12 cm. common in Mughal painting, but makes little attempt to provide it with the three-dimensionality that his counterpart in the Akbarndma does. It is likely that this decision was precipitated by Fattu's recognition of the limitations of his technical ability, which are readily apparent in the unwieldy form of the gateway to the rear. Likewise, after reducing the number of figures by half, Fattu strips much of the detail from their faces and clothing. The figures be- come virtually uniform in age and facial shape, and their clothes lose all sense of pliancy. By contrast, Man6hara imbues the figures in his Akbarndma illus- tration with a sense of real mass by dwelling on the shadows that give volume to their faces and clothes (fig. 5). The physical and pictorial impoverishment of the Razmnama has led some scholars to remove the manuscript from the canon of imperial painting, which is arbitrarily defined by the finest works. Because the emperor did not want for resources, they assume that he would not have tolerated anything but works of the very highest quality. Thus they contend that a manuscript like the I598-99 Razmnama must have been made for someone of more modest means and therefore of less exalted status.22 The equation of the quality of painting with the rank of the patron is im- plicit in many studies of Indian painting, but nowhere more so than in the class-conscious distinction between imperial and subimperial Mughal paint- ing. The notion is logical enough on the surface, but is belied occasionally by another, more telling type of evidence. In the case of the 1598-99 Razmnama, the presence of ascriptions to many known imperial artists, including twelve who had worked on the imperial Razmnama itself a decade before and twenty who contributed to the I597-99 Bdburndma, is incontrovertible evidence that the manuscript was produced within the imperial atelier.23 Hence, the 1598-99 Razmndma forces us to decide whether our determination of the patron should depend more heavily on a subjective standard of visual quality or on a roster of artists linked historically to a given patron. One peculiar feature of the manuscript is the number of ascriptions which name hitherto unknown painters such as Fattfi who soon disappear from the documents of Mughal painting. The preponderance of little-known painters, whose ascriptions often indicate a filial or fraternal relationship to es- tablished artists, might suggest that the project was handed over to a group of inexperienced painters, thereby suffering an inevitable decline in quality. While this certainly accounts for some aspects of the Razmndma's appearance, it is also true that the work of novice painters in the I598-99 Razmndma is nearly indistinguishable in both style and quality from that of their senior counterparts. The unexpected aesthetic parity between inexperienced and sea- soned artists implies that the quality of a manuscript's illustrations was shaped by some factor beyond the raw ability of the artists involved. The best explanation for this phenomenon seems to lie in notes written in the painting fields and lower margins of a wide range of imperial manu- scripts which specify the amount of time allocated to an individual illustra- 25</page><page sequence="24">tion. These working times, which run from as few as five days to as many as sixty-five, are quite uniform within a given manuscript.24 A remarkable corre- lation exists between the amount of time devoted to an illustration and the level of quality found in different manuscripts. As these notes document, paintings with large dimensions, dense compositions, and fine detail always required more time to execute than smaller works rendered in a more summary manner. That these two types of manuscript illustrations were produced in many cases by the same group of artists supports the argument that the impe- rial atelier actually intended to produce manuscripts of various levels of qual- ity. In the absence of any discussion of this practice in literary accounts of the time, we can only speculate on the reasons for such a decision. Yet if the 1598-99 Razmnama was produced in the imperial atelier and we continue to believe that the emperor was at least the nominal patron of all the studio's products, can we ever be secure in using the standard of artistic quality to iden- tify a work's patron? One attempt to salvage the approach that relegates the lesser accom- plishments of Mughal painting to subimperial patrons posits extraordinary circumstances for the illustration of the 1598-99 Razmnama within the impe- rial atelier. It proposes that a high-placed official was given temporary access to the imperial workshop, a favor considered to be within reason because of the artists' untested ability; Akbar is thereby absolved of personal responsibility for the illustrations' uninspired quality. The relaxation of the usual standards of painting is thus attributed not to novice painters, but to a novicepatron, who by both inclination and experience failed to exercise the presumed discrimi- nating motivation of the emperor. A variant of this line of thought hazards a guess at the identity of this pu- tative subimperial stand-in. Because the names of three artists - Mohana, Ba- navari, and Kamal - appear in both the 1598-99 Razmndma and several manu- scripts firmly associated with 'Abd al-Rahim, the Khankhanan - the only subimperial patron for whom there is substantial evidence of an independent atelier - has been proposed as the patron of the Razmndma.5 This suggestion has the virtue of restoring artists to their rightful prominence in the assess- ment of a Mughal manuscript, but suffers from three major flaws. First, by ig- noring the large number of Razmnama artists who remained in the imperial atelier, it gives undue weight to three of the fifty-three artists involved in the manuscript in the determination of the Razmnama's probable patron. More- over, it does not demonstrate a connection between the paintings ascribed to these three artists in the Razmndma and those in the confirmed 'Abd al-Rahim manuscripts, thus leaving open the possibility of the coincidence of these com- mon Indian names.26 Second, it offers no explanation of the circumstances under which 'Abd al-Rahim would avail himself of the imperial workshop when he had an active atelier of his own. Third, and perhaps most important for our understanding of Mughal patronage, this theory fails to recognize the provocative implications of the same artists working on exactly contemporary 26</page><page sequence="25">.... ; &gt;2 _Se 1&gt; S j }} Jl?&amp; wMit .. :. + .i _ 2 / -^ H v,.fY 8 @ *. ? . ; ;fil3 ^:'&gt; Z/^^^^$] 6. Mercury in Virgo. Attributed to Bhagavana. I583 Kitdb-i Sa'at, f. 29a. Private collection. 5.8 x II.8 cm. projects for two different patrons. Such a situation would necessitate a shift in the employment of Mughal artists from long-term retainer basis to a short- term contractual arrangement, a condition common in pre-Mughal painting but completely at odds with the long periods of service documented for dozens of Mughal artists. Other Patrons in the Imperial Family A document central to the issue of the semi-permanent attachment of an artist to a particular patron is the Kitdb-i Sdadt, an astrological manuscript whose colophon indicates that it was written in Bihar in 1583 for Akbar's foster brother, Mirza 'Aziz K6ka, who was governor of the province at the time.27 De- spite the fact that the manuscript was written far to the east of the capital, it is almost certain that the twelve illustrations representing the signs of the zodiac were painted by two artists of the imperial atelier. The figure types, rock for- mations, light coloring, and thinly painted surfaces of a representative work (fig. 6) bear a much stronger resemblance to those found in several paintings in the circa I58o British Library Ddrdbnama, a manuscript of unimpeachable imperial origin, than they do to any of the several groups of subimperial paint- ing that appeared before 600oo, including one associated with 'Aziz Koka him- self.28 Hence, it appears that 'Aziz Koka did not maintain his own atelier for such a project, but was able to make use of the services of some members of the imperial painting studio. If we accept the premise that the imperial atelier did provide illustrations to a manuscript written for 'Aziz Koka, what should we then conclude about the opportunity for use of the imperial atelier by patrons other than the em- peror? The intimate relationship between 'Aziz Koka and the imperial family seems to make this situation unique, and certainly does not imply that even se- lected nobles had temporary access to the imperial atelier. 'Aziz K6ka might conceivably be cast in the role of an occasional patron, one who could exert his personal taste on a group of artists just as surely as Akbar himself is presumed to have done. But this explanation, with its emphasis on the notion of a patron projecting a consistent personal taste, is too narrow to account for the range of subject matter, style, and physical quality in manuscripts illustrated by the imperial atelier. Taken to its logical conclusion, one would be obliged to pro- pose a new patron or a new mood for Akbar to match every level of quality or "taste" that we discern in imperial painting.29 Rather than adopting this dubious approach, we should finally relin- quish the twin notions that the imperial atelier served at the beck and call of the emperor alone, and that painting was truly a realm of personal expression - on the part of the patron or his artists. The evidence that undergirds these ideas - which are pervasive in studies of Indian painting - is astonishingly meager. The former seems to be extrapolated from Abu al-Fazl's account of painting in the A'in-i Akbarl, which begins as follows: 27</page><page sequence="26">Drawing the likeness of anything is called taswir. Since it is an excellent source, both of study and entertainment, His Majesty, from the time he came to an awareness of things, has taken a deep interest in painting and sought its spread and development. Consequently this magical art has gained in beauty. A very large number of painters has been set to work. Each week the several ddroghas [supervisors] and bitikchBs [clerks] submit before the king the work done by each artist, and His Majesty gives a re- ward and increases the monthly salaries according to the excellence dis- played.. .The Chingiz-nama, the Zafar-ndma, this book, the Razm-ndma, the Rdmdyan, the Nal-Daman, the Kalila wa Dimna, the 'Iyar-i Danish and other books have been illustrated, His Majesty himself having indic- ated the scenes to be painted.30 These frequently cited remarks have led many to expand Akbar's role in the painting process even beyond that claimed for him by Abu al-Fazl, so that the emperor has been attributed with the power and inclination to determine even minor features of style.3' But the imperial atelier was an institution which served the interests of the state, much on the order of the arsenal, the kitchens, and the royal stables. As head of state, the emperor could fully expect his pan- egyrists to give him personal credit for the empire's many glories. Abtu al-Fazl dutifully obliged this expectation in the A'in-i Akbari, lauding the emperor's special attention not only to the work of his painters, but to every department of the vast imperial household, from the fruitery to the care of elephants and oxen. For example, the chronicler asserts that Akbar maintained an equally wide-ranging and deep interest in horses: His Majesty, from the light of his insight and wisdom, makes himself ac- quainted with the minutest details, and with the classification of every kind of article; he looks to the requirements of the times and designs proper regulations. Hence he also pays much attention to everything that is connected with this animal, which is of so great an importance for the government and an almost supernatural means for the attainment of per- sonal greatness.32 Similarly, he extols Akbar's unsurpassed skill in music: His Majesty has such a knowledge of the science of music as trained mu- sicians do not possess; and he is likewise an excellent hand in performing, especially on the naqara.33 Once we understand Abu al-Fazl's testimony to imperial intervention in the daily affairs of the atelier as a eulogistic conceit, we soon realize that there is little concrete evidence to connect the emperor personally to the vast majority of paintings produced in the imperial atelier. Conversely, various seals and in- 28</page><page sequence="27">scriptions attest that other members of the imperial family were involved pe- riodically in the collection and commissioning of illustrated books. Akbar's mother, Hamida Bantu Begam (also known as Maryam-Makan1) owned a num- ber of books, including a copy of the Gulistdn of Sa'di written and illustrated in 1486, well before her lifetime.34 An inspection note on a recently unveiled Ramayana manuscript dated May 1594 and illustrated with fifty-five paintings indicates that the book was owned by her until her death in August I604.35 The colophon of an illustrated manuscript of Yzsuf wa Zulaykha of the 155os bears the name of Mirza Kamran, Akbar's brother.36 This broader level of imperial patronage continued in subsequent generations. The seal of Nar Jahan, Jahangir's queen and a powerful force in imperial politics, appears on a Diwan of Hafiz illustrated in the early years ofJahangir's reign.37 Khurram (the future ShahJahan, reigned I628-57) emerges as another princely patron; an album as- sembled circa I6I0-15 includes examples of his own calligraphy as well as paintings by artists from the imperial atelier.38 Likewise, his eldest son, Dara Shikfih (I615-59), had an album of paintings and calligraphic specimens pre- pared as a gift for his wife.39 Dara also received at least one illustrated manu- script from his father,40 as did his sister, Jahan Ara.41 Thus it appears that various members of the imperial family could be granted nominal possession of prized books for a time, almost certainly with the understanding that the objects would be returned to the emperor or the imperial library upon request. More important, the existence of multiple copies of various texts such as the Khamsa of Nizami and the Baburndma sug- gests that they could initiate the commission of a manuscript as well. This did not mean, however, that the painters modified the style of the work according to the wishes of the particular member of the imperial family who instigated the work order or received the painting initially. Rather, in my estimation, Mughal painters remained practically oblivious to such considerations, and changed their artistic habits only gradually in response to the encouragement of certain kinds of projects by Akbar and his successors and to the level of fund- ing that determined their numbers, pace of work, and rewards. Manuscripts Illustratedfor Identifiable Subimperial Patrons Valuable manuscripts were presented occasionally to the highest echelon of the Mughal court, as was the case with the lavishly decorated Gulistan that made its way into Jahan Ara's possession almost seventy years after Akbar had given it to Mun'im Khan, who held the rank of Khankhanan at the time. But the paucity of illustrated manuscripts connected to specific subimperial pa- trons other than 'Abd al-Rahim suggests that only a very restricted group had the means or the interest to commission illustrated or illuminated manu- scripts. One manuscript with indisputable inscriptional evidence is a Khamsa (Quintet) of Nizami written for Nawab Bahadur Khan; the colophons of the five poems of the text collectively inform us that the manuscript was written 29</page><page sequence="28">by three different scribes at Akbarabad (Agra) during the years I6I3-I4.42 There is nothing exceptional about the patron or the decoration of the manu- script. Abui al-Nabi, a noble of Central Asian descent, had been granted the title of Bahadur Khan, a relatively high salary, and the governorship of Qan- dahar shortly before this Khamsa was written and illustrated.43 Aside from his later control of a small area near Agra, nothing in the brief historical references to Bahadur Khan Uzbeg would suggest that special personal or political con- ditions lay behind Bahadur Khan's commission of this book at this time or place. The Khamsa contains illuminations in the customary positions in the manuscript, but unexpectedly has a single painting as its frontispiece (fig. 7). The unknown artist was forced to contend with the presence of the central golden medallion, a form often found on the initial folio of a manuscript. The result is a much simplified presentation scene, a subject which follows the Per- sian tradition of pictorial frontispieces. The six large figures form two discrete groups: an elderly man, perhaps to be identified loosely with Bahadur Khan himself, receiving an open book, and three attendants tending to a horse. The figures are related to one another only by their physical juxtaposition; their bodies stop short of any overlap, and their vacant expressions impede any po- tential engagement. This isolated existence is reinforced by a gold background crowded with ornamental flowers. The compositional additiveness, rudimen- tary modeling, and formulaic faces of the painting are far removed from con- temporary imperial painting; rather, they recall the level of technical skill of second-rate paintings produced by the imperial workshop a generation before. The record of multiple scribes, the generic imagery and hackneyed style of the manuscript's oddly positioned image, and the provenance of Agra all raise the distinct possibility that the manuscript was produced commercially at the capital by freelance artists who once had had some direct experience with the imperial style. These conditions suggest that Bahadur Khan's commission of the manuscript was a rare, if not unique occurrence for him, thus exemplify- ing exactly the kind of sporadic patronage that had characterized Indian paint- ing before Akbar's accession, and that had reappeared on a more limited basis in the waning days of his reign. A second subimperial patron is named in the colophon of a copy of the DFwdn of Hasan Dihlawi written by the famous calligrapher Muhammad Husayn Kashmir! and illuminated with decorative headings and miniature birds. The manuscript bears a note which indicates that the book was intended for the library of Shaykh Farid Murtaza Khan Bukhari, a powerful courtier during the reigns of Akbar and Jahangir.44 The abraded colophon of a copy of Jami's Silsilat al-Zahab (Chain of Gold) written in I022/I613 contains a simi- lar name, Nawab Murtaza Quli Bukhari, who is probably synonymous with the figure discussed above.45 Although the two illustrations to this poetical text are contemporary with those of Bahadur Khan's Khamsa and are linked to a patron only slightly higher in status, they are much different in style.

The figures assume tighter and more individu- alized facial features, and wear clothing tempered by subtle effects of model- ing, patterns, and palette. The painting could easily be mistaken for a con- temporary work of the imperial atelier during the reign of Jahangir. Indeed, the recent attribution of this scene to Salim Quli, an artist who worked for Jahangir first at his Allahabad studio and then briefly in the imperial atelier it- self, identifies an individual with the training to produce exactly this kind of work.46 These two subimperial paintings point up the fact that similar subjects and social conditions did not necessarily result in paintings which are visually alike. The two scenes share not so much a distinct set of formal characteristics as a common process of derivation. Both are unalloyed imitations of the impe- rial Mughal idiom in subject and style, showing no trace of the indigenous In- dian styles that assert themselves in the other major variety of Popular Mughal painting. At the same time, however, they demonstrate that the two artists had as their basis of reference two quite different periods in imperial painting. The first painting is clearly the work of an artist who left the imperial atelier in the I58os, and aspired ever after to achieve the formal qualities of painting of that period. The second represents the style of an artist who departed imper- ial employ at a much later date, and thus could still easily approximate the im- perial style of I613. Another specific subimperial patron has been proposed for an illustrated copy of the Anwar-i Suhayli (Lights of Canopus) dated IOO9/I600-OI.47 Al- though there is no formal indication of the patron, the colophon does mention that the manuscript was written at Ahmadabad in Gujarat. This provenance has prompted speculation that the manuscript was prepared for Mirza 'Aziz Koka, then governor of that wealthy province. The forty-three illustrations are relatively close to some of the more cur- sory expressions of the imperial style, notably the works of several lesser- known artists active in the I598-99 Razmndma. Most compositions are quite simple, with a single figure or cluster of figures positioned near the center. The artist draws upon the standard motifs of Mughal landscapes: a foreground pool or stream, a series of ridges or outcrops, a distant cityscape, and tiny trees ren- dered in light blue as a sign of atmospheric perspective. Nonetheless, even in one of the more complicated scenes, he forgoes any attempt to capture the complicated spatial recession of most imperial paintings, substituting instead a flat ground streaked with thin washes of yellow and green and overlaid with an unusually decorative arrangement of flowers and intertwined branches (fig. 9). He allows the brightly colored ridges to lose any semblance of integration with this landscape, a feature made clear by the incongruous juxtaposition of the sky of the main section of the painting with the ground of the vertical ex- tension along the text column. 31</page><page sequence="30">Similar stylistic abbreviations occur in courtyard scenes, albeit less in the architecture itself than in the courtiers' facial types, which are reduced to one plump-cheeked visage for figures in three-quarter view and another bland, tight-lipped countenance for those in profile. Together with similarities in the bright palette and exuberant decorative sensibility, the relentless repetition of these two types in two contemporary manuscripts, a Zafarndma manuscript dated to the same year,48 and a Razmndma dated I605, suggests that a pair of artists with limited experience in the imperial atelier attached themselves to Mirza 'Aziz Koka or another Mughal noble in Gujarat for a period of several years.49 Other Popular Mughal Works in the Islamic Tradition The handful of manuscripts linked to specific subimperial patrons allows us to assign to this same class of patron the more numerous examples of illustrated manuscripts that lack documentation of their provenance or patron. This first major type of Popular Mughal painting consists primarily of illustrated man- uscripts of the classics of Persian literature. This is hardly surprising, for de- spite Akbar's active recruitment of prominent Hindus for the imperial forces, the imperial court was dominated by nobles of Persian, Turkish, and Central Asian origin, for whom ownership of copies of such texts would have been a traditional sign of culture. By far the most popular text illustrated in this idiom was the Shdhndma (Book of Kings). The finest example of these Shdhndma copies is undated, but the sumptuousness of its illuminations and the style of its nine original paint- ings are evidence that the artists who embellished it had left the imperial ate- lier only recently.50 A particularly striking illustration depicts Alexander pre- siding over the construction of an iron wall to restrain the barbarian hordes of Gog and Magog (fig. io). The artist manipulates the composition to leave no doubt that the situation is perilous indeed: fanged creatures threaten to breach the massive ramparts that confine them to a narrow space in the foreground. He colors the landscape with an evanescent blend of violet and green, and em- ploys a distinctive manner of shadows outside the contours of virtually every major form. These two features, which are slight exaggerations of conventions of the imperial style, appear consistently in the manuscript. The figures are also more complicated in pose and modeling than their counterparts in many other subimperial works. Their unindividualized and somewhat complacent expressions fall short of most contemporary imperial paintings, but are at least the equal of the illustrations in the I598-99 Razmndma (fig. 4). If that manu- script seems to have served as a training ground for many artists who were soon to leave the imperial atelier, this Shdhndma represents the kind of work that artists with several years of experience in the imperial workshop produced I0.

Instead, the relative sophistication of the latest of these manuscripts suggests that the paintings' fidelity to the imper- ial idiom was determined more by the artists' depth of experience with the !

Popular Mughal Works in the Indigenous Indian Tradition A second major group of paintings in Popular Mughal art is comprised exclu- sively of works of Hindu literature which are written in Sanskrit or its deriva- tions instead of Persian, the language of the Mughal court. In style, these il- lustrations resemble subimperial Mughal painting at the outset but quickly begin to gravitate towards an indigenous Indian aesthetic. The most impres- sive example of this group is a dispersed series of damaged paintings of the Rdmdyana (figs. I2-I3).53 The paintings of this Rdmdyana series are oriented vertically, as they are in Islamic manuscripts, but otherwise assume a format found in traditional Indian books. The paintings occupy the entire area of one side of the folios, which were kept loose-leaf rather than bound as they would have been in Islamic culture. On the reverse is a description of the subject in several lines of Sanskrit text written in Devanagari script, which is used for several north Indian languages, and a caption of a single line of Braj Bhasha, a medieval vernacular language. As Chandra notes, the presence of Sanskrit verses, a classical Indian language understood only by highly educated Hin- 33</page><page sequence="32">dus, strongly points to a Hindu patron, perhaps a high-ranking official at the court.54 To judge from the strong affinity of the paintings with imperial work of the time, the patron's religion had no effect on his desire to make use of former members of the imperial atelier. We can discern the hands of several artists, all of whom seem to have had considerable familiarity with the imperial style. The fine draftsmanship typical of Mughal painting is most apparent in the figures, who are habitually endowed with small heads and delicate features and are arranged in groups with a complexity rivalling that of imperial painting. Rama is depicted unfailingly with deep blue skin, perhaps as a gesture towards the patron's awareness of standard Hindu iconography. The paintings temper other elements of the imperial style with hints of features drawn from indige- nous Indian traditions. Architectural settings alternate between those made voluminous by the diagonal extension of the golden walls and towers of Lafka, and others flattened completely by a surfeit of rich geometric patterns, as in Figure I2. Similarly, in scenes such as the illustration of Sumantra escorting the repudiated Sita into exile, the artist uses the Mughal device of interlock- ing ridges to construct pictorial space, but renders many of the trees with the luxuriant but mannered foliage of indigenous painting (fig. I3). Despite these modest departures from the imperial style, the overall fidelity of this Ramdyana series to the Mughal style of about I59o dates it to circa I595-1600, or contemporary with much of the Freer manuscript, which it often surpasses in quality. The Rdmdyana is but one of the many texts of classical and medieval In- dian literature illustrated in the Popular Mughal style. Other illustrated man- uscripts include two copies of the Nala Damayanti romance, an independent account of two lovers who appear in a minor book of the Mahdbhdrata,55 the DevT Mdhdtmya, a devotional text dedicated to the goddess Devi,56 and the Rasikapriyd, a treatise on love poetry first illustrated circa I6I0-I5 - only twenty years after its composition by the renowned Kesavadasa.57 Still more common are illustrated rdgamald series (literally, Garland of Musical Modes), which develop visual equivalents to various modes of Indian music. Like the three aforementioned texts, no version of the ragamald exists in the imperial style, a fact which underscores the expansion of subject matter illustrated in the Popular Mughal style. The most important of the rdgamdald series illustrated at the end of the sixteenth century and the beginning of the seventeenth century is known as the Chunar Rdgamdld. An inscription on the reverse of Kedird Rdginz, the last of the thirty-six paintings, gives a date equivalent to 25 February 159I, the place of execution as Chunar, which Beach has identified as a site near Varanasi, and the names of three brothers - Shaykh Husayn, Shaykh 'Ali, and Shaykh Hatim - who allegedly were pupils of Mir Sayyid 'All and 'Abd al-Samad (fig. I4).58 The inscription was disputed for a time, but its careful translation, ex- plication, and reproduction have silenced skeptics. The Chunar Rdgamdld is 12.

Thus far we have been unable to connect these three artists to ascribed paintings produced in the imperial atelier in the i56os and I570os, when by Skelton's reckoning they would have been in their twenties, but as he has observed, the Chunar Rdgamdald paintings generally share many features with the Cleveland Tu.ti- ndma and Rampur Talisman and Zodiac, including the brushy treatment of trees and foliage, the predilection for streaky skies, the oblique position of ar- chitectural structures, the softly modeled clothing, and the rounded profiles of most figures.59 That the provincial district of Chunar was among the earliest destina- tions for artists with firsthand experience in the Mughal style underscores the unpredictable path of the diffusion of Mughal artistic practices. Rather than taking up employment with a noble at Agra or one of the major cities of the empire, it seems that the three artists decided to ply their craft at Chunar be- cause it was a place of importance to their own family. Their patron must have been Rao Bhoj Singh, a Rajput warrior whose father, Surjan Singh, had been granted Chunar as a fief in I576 for his submission to and subsequent service in the imperial armies. The encounter between the three Mughal-trained artists and Bhoj Singh, the nominal ruler of the state of Bundi, was a momentous one in the history of Indian painting. Iconographic studies have shown that artists at Bundi retained the unique imagery of the Chunar Rdgamdld illustrations for generations. Moreover, the initial blend of Mughal and indigenous elements fashioned in the Chunar Rdgamdld is clearly the basis of the distinctive style that emerged in that school of Rajasthani painting by the mid seventeenth century. A dispersed ragamadld series dated I605 demonstrates the next step in the rapid vitiation of the Mughal aesthetic in this strain of Popular Mughal paint- ing.60 The paintings continue the vertical format of the Chunar Rdgamdld and acquire short Sanskrit captions in the upper border. The figures retain the basic facial features and costumes of Mughal painting, but lose the painterly appli- cation of pigment and the modeling of the earlier series. The settings become shallower, being framed by cursorily rendered elements and articulated with large abstract expanses of a bright red or matte pastel colors. The thirty-four miniatures of the series known as the Manley Rdgamdld of circa I6Io represent a further shift in the balance of components of Mughal and indigenous Indian elements.6' In some paintings, such as Asdvari Rdgin, the artist constructs a landscape dominated by a schematic version of the ubiq- uitous brightly colored outcrops of the Mughal style; in many others, he re- sorts to a characteristically Indian vertical stacking of planes of color, which are differentiated occasionally by a tree or simple ridge. Likewise, the artist in- I5. Bhairava Rdga. Manley Rdgamald. ca. I6io. British Mu- seum 1973 9-I7 57. 20.6 x I4.7 cm. vokes many Mughal motifs in the architectural settings of illustrations such as Bhairava Rdga, including the hexagonal dais, the half-open door behind the man having his arm rubbed, the battlements and kiosks on the pavilion roof, 35</page><page sequence="34">and the awkwardly angled gateway at the left (fig. I5). Nonetheless, a compar- ison of similar settings in two Mughal courtyard scenes (figs. 4-5) makes it clear he does not even attempt to recreate the interior space of those composi- tions. Instead, he marshals the more flatly conceived forms into a kind of two- dimensional grid, a pictorial structure common in pre-Mughal Indian paint- ing (see fig. i). The squat proportions and squarish-headed profiles of the figures of the Manley Rdgamdal and the rich primary colors of their clothing establish the se- ries as an intermediary between the painting styles represented by two major documents of early seventeenth-century Rajasthani art: a ragamala series painted by Nasir al-Din at Chawand in Mewar in I6O5,62 and another executed by the artist Sahibdin in Mewar in I628.63 Remarking upon this relationship, Topsfield has offered the plausible suggestion that Sahibdin had secondary training in the Popular Mughal style, which he applied as he reshaped the course of painting at Mewar through I650.64 Thus the Mughal style continued to reverberate through Rajasthan as former imperial artists passed the Popu- lar Mughal style on to a new generation of local painters. Taking their cue from such vestiges of the Mughal visual legacy, some scholars have proposed various cities as centers of Popular Mughal painting. One uses the mention ofJaisalmer, a city at the western edge of Rajasthan, in the colophon of a series of the romance of Mddhavdnala Kdmakandald dated I603 as evidence of a Rajasthani origin for this and other Popular Mughal sets.65 Another cites the range of the two Hindi dialects used in the i605 Ragamala in Berlin and the Manley Rdgamala to support a proposal of Uttar Pradesh, including Agra, as their provenance.66 The only secure provenance for this variety of Popular Mughal painting, however, is Agra, whose name is supplied in a long scroll illustrated by Ustad Salivahana in i6io on behalf of the Jaina community of that city (figs. I6-I7).67 The community must have felt that its own prestige and the persuasiveness of its invitation to Vijayasena Suri, a renowned Jaina monk, to take up residence with them during the rainy season would be enhanced by the scroll's illustra- tion, which represents two scenes: Jahangir's proclamation prohibiting the slaughter of animals during the twelve days of aJaina sacred feast, and the joy- ous reaction of the Jaina community. The artist uses his boast of membership in the imperial atelier to testify to his skill, and bolsters his claim to have been an eyewitness to the proclamation with numerous labels in Devanagari iden- tifying the emperor and his entourage. The lively, albeit flatly rendered courtiers, musicians, and gate-keepers are all stock characters of Mughal paint- ing, but their even positioning across the broad zones of the green and dull pink ground exemplifies the uncomplicated figural groupings characteristic of Popular Mughal painting. Below this scene, Salivahana depicts an imaginary one of the monk being presented with the imperial decree. The subsequent cel- ebrations among the Jaina nuns and laity appear at the bottom of the scroll. i6. The Jaina community celebrates the proclamation of Emperor Jahingir. By Ustid Salivahana.

Photograph after Doshi, Masterpieces of Jain Painting (Bombay: Marg Publications, I985), p. 76. The artist Salivahana stands out even more clearly from the general anonymity of Popular Mughal art with the appearance of a second work, an il- lustrated manuscript of the Sdlibhadra Caritra, a Jaina text written in Ra- jasthani Hindi.68 The manuscript's colophon provides exceptionally complete documentation of the circumstances of its production, including the names of the author and scribe, the date of transcription (I62I), and the date upon which the thirty-nine illustrations by Salivahana were completed (1624). Two mer- chant brothers, Bharamalla and Rajapala, and their families are named as the patrons, with Bharamalla being lauded as both a devout member of the Jaina community and a prominent figure at the Mughal court. Salivahana's illustrations in the I624 Salibhadra Caritra - the latest dated example of Popular Mughal painting - show little change from his work in the earlier picture scroll (fig. I8). The artist continues to divide the painting field into distinct bands of flat color. Occasionally Salivahana tempers the abstract quality of this feature by adding details such as the serried rock edge to sug- gest different parts of a landscape, but the bland join between the flat screen of rocks behind the women and the awkwardly upturned rock above betray his basic unfamiliarity with the construction of Mughal pictorial space. Con- versely, the animated poses of the figures and birds and the wide assortment of facial types attest that the artist did not suffer any decline in his ability to ren- der individual forms with considerable naturalism. The persistence of these features bolsters the view that the artist's claim to have been a royal painter was more than mere pretension, though as Chandra has observed, he may have served under Akbar rather than Jahangir.69 Conclusion Thus we have seen that the Mughal style radiated outward from the imperial court through two means. The most important was the dispersal of artists who had had practical training in the imperial atelier. Beginning in the I58os and continuing intermittently into the second decade of the seventeenth century, these artists moved within Agra and beyond to find employment with new pa- trons. Whether these patrons were individual nobles or an entire Jaina com- munity, they sought to bask in the reflected prestige of the Mughal court by emulating the subject matter and style of its painting. Their success in doing so clearly depended upon the depth of experience that their newly recruited artists had had in the imperial workshop. In most cases, we can assess this ex- perience only by visual analysis, for upon leaving the well-documented and highly organized imperial atelier for ephemeral employment in less structured environments, most of these artists disappeared from the annals of history. Nonetheless, working from the outlines of the second careers of a few named Mughal artists, we can plot the gradual relinquishment of the most subtle as- pects of the Mughal style and its eventual hybridization with regional styles. We may conjecture that images themselves constituted a second means of disseminating the Mughal style. Important Rajput nobles had the oppor- 37 ?? ?? ?? i I??r--*????-? .CI??' r*?r*,r nu .I ?.... ??. ?rr. .r?*rr 1.J: r??? ??r ?? I'lfr"- "'"^ "' ' '"??'r??? .il -- -? ?' "' """-'</page><page sequence="36">tunity to acquire some examples of Mughal-style paintings at court, and prob- ably turned them over to local artists as models to imitate. This second-hand process almost certainly accounts for the many examples of Popular Mughal painting that exhibit only the most superficial acquaintance with Mughal fea- tures, such as Figure 15. If paintings developed through such indirect means represent the last in a series of ripples of the imperial Mughal style on contemporary Indian paint- ing, then the works produced for 'Abd al-Rahim exhibit every sign of being the initial stage in this process of cultural diffusion. In the next chapter, we will examine the reasons that 'Abd al-Rahim occupied such a pre-eminent po- sition among the Mughal nobility. 38</page><page sequence="37">Notes I The Agada Mahavaidyaka as cited in N.S.

Bayram Khan's prestigious position was complemented by the unofficial but no less important duty of serving as Akbar's regent. The com- mander-in-chiefs once intimate relationship with the adolescent emperor had already begun to show signs of strain when Bayram Khan was murdered at Patan in Gujarat in January I56I while on the pilg,image to Mecca. Akbar re- paid his minister's years of loyalty by assuming charge of his young son, an episode which is depicted in two copies of the Akbarndma (fig. 5).l This meet- ing marked the beginning of an association between the two men which was to last nearly fifty years. The legacy of 'Abd al-Rahim's father and his own closeness to the emperor undoubtedly aided the rapid advancement of'Abd al- Rahim's career, which is reviewed here with two questions in mind.2 First, to what extent did 'Abd al-Rahim's interest in literature and art go beyond that displayed by other high officials of the Mughal court? Second, does the geo- graphy of 'Abd al-Rahim's career shed light on either the provenance of the manuscripts associated with him or his involvement with the atelier? In 1575, the young 'Abd al-Rahim was named viceroy of Gujarat, one of the richest provinces of the empire.3 Having carried out his duties with dis- tinction, he received a series of appointments in Rajasthan, where he began to demonstrate his talents as a military commander. His outstanding perfor- mance in this capacity resulted in further promotions, first to the position of Mir 'Arzi (Lord of Petitions) in I58o,4 and then to that of tutor (at.dliq) to Prince Salim in I582.5 Akbar's confidence in the ability of his protege was well- founded. In 1583, 'Abd al-Rahim scored a tremendous victory over Sult.an Muzaffar near Ahmadabad in Gujarat in I583; on 23 February I584, 'Abd al- Rahim was rewarded with the ultimate honor: the title of Khinkhanan, the position once held by his father.6 Thereafter, 'Abd al-Rahim was recalled periodically to the capital and re- assigned to various provinces, yet returned time and again to Gujarat. He served as governor of the province from 1575 to I578 and again from I584 to 1589, both periods being well before the mid I590os, when the earliest paintings associated with him are dated.7 In 1589-90, he was named to the enormously prestigious post of Wakil al-Saltanat (Vice-Regent of the Empire), a largely honorary position; at the same time, he received Jaunpur as ajagir (fief), yield- 45</page><page sequence="44">ing the viceroyalty of Gujarat to the emperor's foster brother, Khan-i A'zam Mirza 'Aziz K6ka, who has already been discussed in Chapter I.8 Subsequent campaigns, however, soon took 'Abd al-Rahim to the western reaches of the empire, where he first received as fiefs and then completed the conquest of the regions of Bhakkar, Multan, and Thatta. The remainder of 'Abd al-Rah.im's life was spent on a series of military campaigns in the Deccan, a remote and wealthy land whose wily rulers staved off conquest by the superior Mughal forces for several decades by means of strategems and bribery.9 The Mughal campaigns in the Deccan were plagued by the ineffective leadership of Prince Murad, who feuded constantly with the older and more experienced Khankhanan. Akbar tried to salvage the situation by recalling Murad to the capital, but the prince hung on to his position for a while until he finally succumbed to the ravages of alcoholism in I599. After a brief stay at court, 'Abd al-Rahim returned to the Deccan with Prince Daniyal, to whom he had given his daughter in marriage. The military situation bright- ened temporarily with the fall of Ahmadnagar fort in August I6oo, but Daniyal soon met his brother's fate. With the demise of the emperor's two younger sons, and the death of Akbar himself in October I605, the way to the throne was open once more to Prince Salim, Akbar's rebellious firstborn. 'Abd al-Rahim developed a somewhat checkered relationship with his onetime charge, who assumed the name Jahangir upon his accession in I605. Little more than a year later, the new emperor summoned 'Abd al-Rahim from Burhanpur. 'Abd al-Rahim demonstrated his complete devotion to Jahangir by throwing himself wildly at his feet, and by presenting elephants and valu- able jewels; in return, he was honored with a jewelled sword and reappoint- ment as Vizier al-Mulk (Minister of the Realm).0? 'Abd al-Rahim was permit- ted to return once more to Burhanpur, the capital of the province of Khandesh in the northern Deccan. There he was joined by Prince Parwez, the new com- mander of imperial forces in the region. Parwez proceeded to make a series of ill-considered military decisions which ended in an inconclusive treaty with Malik 'Ambar, the powerful prime minister of Ahmadnagar. With this igno- minious conclusion to the seemingly interminable campaign to subjugate the Deccan, the long-brewing disappointment and suspicion at the far-off court finally came to a head. Khan Jahan Lodi persuaded the emperor that the true cause of failure was 'Abd al-Rahim's treacherous alliances with the rulers of the Deccan, and orchestrated his removal from the position of Khankhanan. 'Abd al-Rahim was ordered to present himself at court in I6Io, where he was re- ceived coldly by Jahangir.II The Khankhanan's political disgrace, to which he himself refers in the flyleaf note on one manuscript, did not last long. His rehabilitation began in I6II, when he received the districts (sarkars) of Qanauj and Kalpi in the Agra area as a base from which he was to subdue rebels in that region.I2 Upon learn- ing that the new commanders had incurred even greater difficulties in the Dec- can, Jahangir soon realized that the charges against 'Abd al-Rahim had been 46</page><page sequence="45">trumped up. In I613, he raised 'Abd al-Rahim's rank once more and permitted him to return to Burhanpur, where he joined his son, Iraj Mirza, whom the em- peror had honored recently with the title Shahnawaz Khan and a high rank. It was at Burhanpur, too, in I614 that 'Abd al-Rahim first received 'Abd al-Baqi Nihawandi, a Persian poet whose work so pleased the Khankhanan that he commissioned him to write a comprehensive celebration of his life and ac- complishments, which was completed in I616 and entitled Ma'dsir-i Rahim.I3 This long biography records that many other literary figures in search of pa- tronage flocked to Burhanpur during these years. Among them was the poet Mawlana Qadiri, who joined the Khankhanan's service in I615 upon leaving the employ of Mirza 'Aziz Koka, 'Abd al-Rahim's brother-in-law.I4 In March-April I616, a year to which two manuscripts illustrated for 'Abd al- Rahim are dated, another Persian poet, 'Abd al-Baqi Tabini, found favor with the Khankhanan at Burhanpur after being rebuffed at the court ofJahangir.15 The praise lavished on 'Abd al-Rahim by his large and illustrious liter- ary entourage could do nothing to insulate him from the invidious intrigue of the court. In I616, 'Abd al-Rahim's political fortunes dipped again as the lead- ership of the Deccani campaign passed from Parwez to his more adroit brother, Prince Khurram. Unlike Parwez, a weak character content to direct matters in name only, Khurram assumed real control of the army, and quickly arranged a favorable treaty. 'Abd al-Rahim endured this new challenge to his authority in the region with grace, and forged an alliance with Khurram by offering him his granddaughter in marriage. A year later, with his position as heir firmly se- cured by his military success, Khurram repaid 'Abd al-Rahim by arranging for him to be placed in charge of familiar political terrain: the province (syzba) of Birar, Khandesh, and Ahmadnagar in the northern Deccan. 'Abd al-Rahim continued to accumulate honors. In I618, he visited the emperor at Ranthambor in Rajasthan, and was awarded the unprecedented mansab of 7,000 men, an honorary command whose salary originally reflected the number of soldiers and horses one was expected to muster in times of war. Despite such gestures of respect, the relationship between 'Abd al-Rahim and Jahangir deteriorated to the point that Sir Thomas Roe, a British emissary to India, wrote that 'Abd al-Rahim feared to go to court lest he be poisoned at Jahangir's order.'6 Against this background of distrust, it was perhaps in- evitable that 'Abd al-Rahim would seem to side with Prince Khurram in his rebellion against the increasingly dissolute emperor in I622. The rebellion fal- tered, much as Jahangir's own had twenty years earlier, and 'Abd al-Rahim fell into disgrace once more. A bitter Jahangir wrote: When nobles like the Khan-khanan, who had been distinguished with the rank ofAtalik [guardian] and arrived at the age of seventy years, made their faces black with rebellion and ingratitude, how could one complain about others? It may be said that his very nature was seditious and un- 47</page><page sequence="46">grateful. His father (Bairam Khan) at the end of his life behaved in the same unbecoming way towards my reverend father.17 Within a year, however, 'Abd al-Rahim rebounded once again. Summoned to Lahore by the ailing emperor, he was pronounced innocent of all charges and was reinstated as Khankhanan on 2I October I625.18 Less than a year later, he fell ill while making his way from Lahore to his jagir at Qanauj, and died in Delhi on 22 September I626, at the age of seventy-two.I9 Personal Qualities Behind this illustrious public career was a man of truly remarkable personal qualities. A series of portraits of 'Abd al-Rahim produced by imperial artists during Jahangir's reign give us some idea of the Khankhanan's physical ap- pearance. In a famous scene representing the weighing of Prince Khurram against gold and other valuables, 'Abd al-Rahim, who stands immediately be- hind the sixteen-year-old prince, is depicted as short in stature and rather dark in complexion (fig. 19).20 Individual portraits of 'Abd al-Rahim from the last decade of his life, such as the sensitive portrait by Hashim, minimize the for- mer trait and show no indication of the latter (fig. 20). Common to all these portraits, however, is 'Abd al-Rahim's slightly aquiline nose, a wispy white beard, and somewhat frail body.21 In many respects, 'Abd al-Rahim was an ideal patron, being blessed with intelligence, wealth, and generosity to a degree rarely found in a single indi- vidual. His religious background and mystical inclination were well-suited to the spirit of religious speculation and tolerance promoted by Akbar and Jahangir. Born to a father who adhered to Shia Islam, 'Abd al-Rahim seems to have followed the Sunni doctrine, and apparently stopped short of formally be- coming a disciple of Akbar's new syncretic religion.22 His rearing in the bosom of the imperial family and his passion for reading, which he indulged even dur- ing his bath, led him to develop impressive intellectual abilities.23 He was proficient in Persian, Arabic, Turki, and Hindi, and acquired knowledge of Sanskrit and even some Portuguese, which he used in negotiations with Euro- pean merchants.24 'Abd al-Rahim regularly earned the approbation of the court for his skill in composition and translation from various languages, but his most notable achievement in this vein was the translation of the memoirs of Babur, Akbar's grandfather, from Turki into Persian, which he presented to Akbar on 24 November I589.25 Writing under the pen-name Rahim (the Com- passionate), he became renowned as a poet in both Persian and Hindi, and was attended by a number of famous poets such as Zuhuri, 'Urfi Shirazi, and Mulla Shakibi Isfahani.26 If 'Abd al-Rahim's erudition and literary prowess exerted a strong pull i9.

For example, Fayzi, a court poet, library superintendent, and the elder brother of the court chronicler Abf al-Fazl, possessed a collection of 4,600 volumes, which entered the imperial library upon his death in I595.27 He was able to amass a library of this size despite a very modest income of 400 mansab. By contrast, 'Abd al-Rahim held a mansab of at least 5,000 through- out most of his career, the highest of any noble of the day. In short, he had more than sufficient means to assemble a coterie of gifted authors and artists and to acquire books on all kinds of topics. 'Abd al-Rahim's generosity was nothing short of legendary. He funded the travel expenses of pilgrims to Mecca, lifted up many a supplicant from in- digence, and offered princely rewards to poets before they even uttered a 49</page><page sequence="48">word.28 Inspired by this unusual bounty, grateful poets found it easy to sing the praises of man whose generosity was so limitless that it was regularly likened to an ocean. Just how far the Khinkhanin's fame had spread by I6oo is made clear by the lament of a neglected poet in Persia, who wrote: In Iran nobody appeared to buy the merchandise of "meaning." In this Iran the palate of my soul has become bitter - Now I have to go toward Hindustan. Like the drop sent toward the vast ocean I send my merchandise toward Hindustan, For among those who know words in this age there is No one to buy words save the Khan-i Khanan.29 The Library Personnel Literary sources and inscribed manuscripts provide more information about the library and atelier of 'Abd al-Rahim than about those of any other patron out- side the imperial family. The most important literary source is the Ma'asir-i Rahimt, which gives biographical sketches for many of the ninety-five person- ages employed at one time or another in the library. The kinds of accomplish- ments recorded in these biographies and the level of detail in which they are de- scribed provide an invaluable context for the inscriptions on individual manuscripts and miniatures. The growth of 'Abd al-Rahim's library establishment, which was said to have welcomed approximately a hundred visitors daily, paralleled 'Abd al- Rahim's own rise to prominence. Writing in I615, 'Abd al-Baqi Nihawandi, the author of the Ma'dsir-i Rahimi, mentions that Muhammad Husayn of Herat had been employed as a bookbinder in 'Abd al-Rahim's atelier for thirty-five years, thus implying that the library existed at least as early as I580, or before 'Abd al-Rahim had attained the rank of Khankhanan.3? The longevity of 'Abd al-Rahim's library establishment and the size of its staff al- lowed for considerable diversification of the activities of its employees, much along the lines of the imperial library and workshop. Foremost among the li- brary's staff was the supervisor (nz.im), said to have had direct responsibility for the supervision of the finances of the library as well as personnel matters.31 This position was filled for a time by Mawlana Ibrahim Naqqash (Ibrahim the painter), who is described as being proficient in painting, calligraphy, gilding, bookbinding, stone engraving, and even poetry.32 The Ma'adsr-i RahTmi states that Ibrahim entered the service of the Khankhanan in Ahmadnagar, a fact which establishes that Ibrahim did so after 1004/1595-96, when 'Abd al- Rahim was first posted to the Deccan.33 The timing of lbrahim's arrival and his appellation as naqqdsh suggest that Ibrahim had done a stint as a painter in the 50</page><page sequence="49">imperial atelier, and that together with his other skills, a facility in painting was considered appropriate training for the position of overall supervisor of the library.34 The most notable of the panegyrists mentioned in the Ma'dsir-i Rahimi is the poet Mulla Shakibi Imami, who is named in the flyleaf note of the Rdmdyana as the supervisor of the manuscript. Born in Persia in 964/I556-67, Mulla Shakibi came to India in I590, and immediately sought out 'Abd al- Rahim, who was at Agra at the time.35 He accompanied 'Abd al-Rahim in his travels until I597-98, when, according to several contemporary accounts, he parted with his patron. He apparently resumed his service with the Khan- khanan, however, for in I603-04 he asked for 'Abd al-Rahim's permission and financial support to undertake the pilgrimage to Mecca to fulfill a vow made during an illness a few years earlier.36 Upon his return to India in I606-07, Mulla Shakibi once again took up employment with 'Abd al-Rahim until his retirement in I609-IO.37 Curiously, the dates of Mulla Shakibi's attendance of 'Abd al-Rahim match neither the original chronology advanced in the flyleaf note of the Rdmayana nor the revised chronology presented in Chapter 3. This suggests that the supervision implicit in the Rdmdyana's flyleaf note may have had only a titular connotation, or that the information furnished in that note should be regarded with some reservation. Below the rank of supervisor were a deputy librarian (darogha) and a staff of bookbinders, calligraphers, and painters, many of whom were versed in more than one art. The Ma'dsir-i Rahimi gives the names of several men who held the position of deputy librarian, including Aqa Muhammad Shirazi, Shaykh Brahmi, Shaykh 'Abd al-Salam, Shuja'a Shirazi, and Mir Baqi Mawara'unnahri, the last of whom was instrumental in collecting the stray fo- lios of 'Abd al-Rahim's copy of the Khamsa of Amir Khusraw DihlawL.38 Fol- lowing the librarians named in the Ma'dasr-i Rahimi are the calligraphers, some of whom, such as Shuja'a, served as deputy librarian for a time. Shuja'a, who joined 'Abd al-Rahim's service in Thatta in Sind in 1590-91 and was highly regarded for his ability in naskh and thuluth scripts, also became a per- sonal confidant of 'Abd al-Rahim, a development which became the cause of some envy among his associates.39 Mulla Muhammad Mu'min, whom the au- thor describes as a specialist in nasta'liq script, is cited in 'Abd al-Rahim's in- scription on the Berlin Khamsa as the artist responsible for writing out the text on the replacement folios.40 'Abd al-Rahim's court loomed as a haven for poets and others driven out into the world by hardship and neglect. Among the many skilled Persian artists uprooted by the turmoil in Khurasan about I590 was Mirza 'Abd al- Malik, a calligrapher noted for his skill in shikasta script; he found work at the imperial court for a time, but then attached himself to the Khankhanan until his death in Burhanpur in I609.4I Another itinerant Persian calligrapher, Muhammad Baqir Kashani, reached the refuge of'Abd al-Rahim's patronage not by the well-beaten path from the Mughal court, but by way of the court of 51</page><page sequence="50">one of the Mughals' staunchest Deccani adversaries: Ibrahim 'Adil Shah II of Bijapur.42 The favor of'Abd al-Rahim also served as springboard for entry into im- perial service. The poet Naziri, among the first Persians to seek his fortune with 'Abd al-Rahim, was unsuccessful in his first attempt to parlay his con- nection with the Khankhanan into employment at Akbar's court; later, how- ever, he enjoyed a more positive reception at the courts of Prince Murad and Jahangir.43 The best-known example of an artist who moved from the Khankhanan's atelier to the imperial workshop is a calligrapher coincidentally named 'Abd al-Rahim, one of the most esteemed calligraphers of the age.44 In I590, the Khankhanan presented this artist to Akbar, who in I604 bestowed upon the calligrapher the honorary name of 'Ambarin Qalam (Ambergris Pen). The earliest work by this calligrapher dates to I59I; a series of manuscripts written by him from the mid I590s on underscores his continuous employment in the imperial atelier through the reign ofJahangir.45 Other members of'Abd al-Rahim's library who were recognized for their talent in poetry and calligra- phy followed a similarly deferential course to imperial employ, being com- mended to court to serve as royal tutors, as 'Abd al-Rahim himself had done for Prince Salim, or in other capacities.46 The short biographies of five painters and two illuminators near the end of the Ma'dsTr-i RahFmF offer unusual insight into how a Mughal painter and his work were assessed by his contemporaries. 'Abd al-Baqi relates that Miyan Nadim and his brother Fahim were the sons of Barbunaji, the raja of Sirohi (a state in Rajasthan).47 After their father was slain in battle with the Khankhanan, they came into 'Abd al-Rahim's custody, and he raised them both like his own sons. The author describes Nadim's ability in drawing and painting as so accomplished that it was unsurpassed since the days of Mani and Bihzad, two legendary masters of Persian painting. He continues with a po- tentially more revealing statement, asserting that the Khankhanan himself trained Nadim and brought him to this exalted level. Finally, he remarks that the artist passed away in 'Abd al-Rahim's service, thus placing Nadim's death before I616, the date the Ma'csTr-i RahZim was completed. Bihbud, the second painter listed, is also named as a special attendant of the Khankhanan.48 As usual, 'Abd al-Baqi begins with the circumstances of the figure's involvement with 'Abd al-Rahim, indicating that Bihbud was once the servant of the calligrapher Mirza Baqir, and accompanied him into the Khankhanan's service. Bihbud became renowned for his skill in painting and nasta'liq, which again is touted as unequalled. The writer concludes by testifying that he personally has seen examples of Bihbud's art, and declares him to be truly a "wonder of the age." The status of a personal attendant is also conferred upon the third painter, Mawlana Mushfiq, who spent nearly his entire life in the library establish- ment.49 This artist, too, is said to have attained a level of ability without equal, again as a result of the attention and instruction of the Khankhanan. For the 52</page><page sequence="51">next painter, Madhava (Madhu), 'Abd al-Baqi abbreviates the customary dis- cussion of the individual's origin and initial encounter with 'Abd al-Rahim, and simply describes him as a Hindu.50 The author invokes the metaphor of the pinnacle of artistic accomplishment once more, and lauds the painter as the Man! and Bihzad of the age in portraiture, drawing, painting, and design. He states that Madhava has illustrated most of the manuscripts of the court, and informs us that the artist holds a jagir as well as the usual stipends. 'Abd al- Baqi vouches for the artist's excellence, noting that he has seen his work in the presence of the Khankhanan. After digressing briefly to describe the calligra- pher Mawlana Darwish Turbati, and the musketmaker Muhammad Salih Beg, 'Abd al-Baqi turns to the fifth painter, Ibrahim Naqqash, whose life was sum- marized earlier. Again the author is content to commend Ibrahim's general ex- cellence as a poet, calligrapher, and administrator, and offers no particular comment on his painterly activity. More specific remarks are directed to two artists who specialized in the binding and illumination of manuscripts in the library. 'Abd al-Baqi recounts that Mulla Muhammad Amin and his sons fled the devastation in Khurasan for the safety of 'Abd al-Rahim's library.5' Among the many rewards that Muhammad Amin earned for his prolific and incomparable work in the deco- rative ruling, gilding, and tracing ('aks) of paper was a monthly salary of 4,000 rupees - apparently such a magnificent sum that the author felt compelled to record it. 'Abd al-Baqi credits him with the use of up to seven colors in deco- rative tracing - a technique which can actually be seen in the borders of sev- eral manuscripts from 'Abd al-Rahim's library.52 Muhammad Amin is also praised for the invention of abri paper. Muhammad Husayn of Herat, who was the brother of the calligrapher Muhammad Mu'min mentioned above, practiced the art of bookbinding and illumination.53 'Abd al-Baqi makes a rare distinction in ability here, as he claims that Muhammad Husayn surpassed even Muhammad Amin in the lat- ter, including decorative tracing. He indicates the artist had labored for thirty- five years in the library, and had received a jagir in addition to a regular stipend. Several themes recur throughout the artist biographies compiled by 'Abd al-Baqi as part of his long encomium to 'Abd al-Rahim. One is the individ- ual's personal closeness to the Khankhanan, who almost inevitably is given credit for the realization of superior artistic ability. Superlatives are disbursed freely, so that nearly every artist surpasses every other; only once does the au- thor make a slight gesture toward the kind of visual discrimination that has become familiar in the West in modern times. 'Abd al-Baqi often indicates an area of expertise within a particular field - especially in calligraphy - but never cites distinctive qualities of the individual's work, let alone specific examples. Indeed, the second-hand nature of most of his information is highlighted by his eagerness to corroborate his statements with his own personal testimony whenever possible. Finally, 'Abd al-Baqi rarely fails to mention the artist's 53</page><page sequence="52">ample remuneration, thereby paying tribute to the legend of generosity that he was meant to enshrine. The Library Holdings As with all great Mughal libraries, the fruits of the talented authors, calligra- phers, and artists gathered together by 'Abd al-Rahim were scattered before any sort of inventory was ever made. We can only guess at the library's size and composition, but inscriptions on a few surviving books provide some indica- tion of the various means by which this great bibliophile assembled his col- lection, which was heralded as one of the wonders of the age. The most direct method of obtaining books, but one undocumented to date in actual manu- scripts, was 'Abd al-Rahim's lavish patronage of contemporary authors, a prac- tice which made his library famous for its many autograph copies.54 An unil- lustrated Persian commentary on Arabic verses in praise of the Prophet Muhammad testifies to 'Abd al-Rahhim's piety and the breadth of his literary interests, but offers only a seal dated 991/I583 and inscribed with 'Abd al- Rahim's name and patrimony as evidence of his onetime ownership.55 A copy of a second religious text, Al-Kashshdf 'an .Haqa'iq al-Tanzil, bears a pious note which documents its entry into 'Abd al-Rahim's library in Muharram 992/January-February 1584 in Ahmadabad.56 A third religious manuscript makes explicit the circumstances under which it entered the library. A manu- script of the Bahr-i Mawwaj, another fifteenth-century commentary on the Koran, is marked with a seal and a note which states that the manuscript came into 'Abd al-Rahim's possession in 992/1584 in Ahmadabad after his victory over Sult.an Muzaffar; an adjacent inscription records that after a few months the work was presented to Amir Nu'man, a Sufi shaykh.57 Another book ac- quired as booty is a medicinal work, a commentary on the Kulliyydt (Collected Works) of al-Qinfin.58 Written again in his typically uneven scrawl, 'Abd al- Rahlim's inscription on the flyleaf of the book cites the year 993/I585 and the af- termath of his conquest of Gujarat, a date complemented by a slightly later seal of 998/I589-90.59 Another manuscript which entered 'Abd al-Rahim's li- brary about this time was the Maktgbat-i SadT, a compilation of the mystical letters of Sharaf al-Din, a fourteenth-century saint.6? Other manuscripts made their way into 'Abd al-Rahim's holdings as gifts, of which the most prestigious must have been books presented by the emperor himself. Some examples of this type of circulation of rare books be- tween the emperor and the nobility date to the early years of Akbar's reign. Mun'im Khan, 'Abd al-Rahim's predecessor as Khankhanan, received an ex- quisite copy of Sa'di's Gulistdn (Rose Garden) from Akbar in 1567-68; a dozen years later, he dutifully reciprocated with the gift of a copy of the Haft Paykar (Seven Portraits) of Nizami partially written by the renowned calligrapher Sult.an 'Ali and illustrated with paintings ascribed to Bihzad.6' During the reigns of Jahangir and Shah Jahan, such trade in manuscripts became an ever more common occurrence. Jahangir's memoirs of the eighth year of his reign 54</page><page sequence="53">(I613) record Muzaffar Khan's gift of twelve gold coins (muhrs) and a copy of the Koran with a jewelled cover,62 while those of the fourteenth year (I619) mention the presentation by 'Abd al-Sattar of a miscellany written by Humayiun.63 In addition to gifts of land and robes of honor, Jahangir himself gave the shaykhs of Gujarat books from his special library, inscribing on the books the date of his arrival in Gujarat and the presentation of the books.64 Only two manuscripts are known to have passed from the collection of the imperial library to 'Abd al-Rahim's library establishment. A copy of Abiu Rayhan Andalusi's Ta'bTr Riyad, a text on the interpretation of dreams, is in- scribed with a note by 'Abd al-Rahim dated to Akbar's twenty-fourth regnal year (1589) indicating that the manuscript had been given by Akbar to Bayram Khan, 'Abd al-Rahim's father.65 Another manuscript presumably inherited by 'Abd al-Rahim from his father's library is the Qaldm-i Turki, a slim book of po- etry written by the emperor Babur during his illness in I528.66 The book is in- scribed by both Bayram Khan and Shah Jahan, with the latter verifying that the verses were in his ancestor's own handwriting. Many more manuscripts seem to have passed in the opposite direction. An annotated copy of the Koran bears traces of its passage from the possession of 'Abd al-Rahim to the imperial library, containing numerous divination notes by 'Abd al-Rahim and Muhammad Salih, a calligrapher who worked for Shah Jahan.67 The numerous inspection notes on a copy of the Shash Ris/ila of Sa'di record a particularly tortuous path to and from 'Abd al-Rahim's library.68 Apparently in imperial possession at Udaipur in 1578, the manuscript bears a seal inscribed "Muhammad Rahim, son of Muhammad Bayram 996/1587-88" and a brief note written by 'Abd al-Rahim in I6IO; these are followed by a holo- graph by Shah Jahan, a series of dated inspection notes by imperial librarians, and the seal of Shah Jahan's son and successor, Awrangzeb. Other books were enhanced by 'Abd al-Rahim's atelier before they were presented to the emperor. A manuscript of the Sad Pand-i Luqmdn, a short re- ligious text by Khwaja 'Abdullah al-Ansari, contains a note by Jahangir recording his library's acquisition of the book, which he declares was written by the renowned calligrapher Mir 'Ali.9 The style of the manuscript's new col- ored borders, which are decorated with golden floral designs and applied tri- angular medallions, resembles several works refurbished in 'Abd al-Rahim's atelier, and suggests that the manuscript once belonged to the Khankhanan. Another manuscript prized for its calligrapher, a copy of the Yuisuf wa Zulay- khd of Jami written by Sultan 'All in Herat in I492-93, was presented to Jahangir by Muhammad Ma'stum on behalf of'Abd al-Rahim at Agra in March i6io.70 In his estimate of the value of the manuscript at 1,000ooo gold muhrs, Jahangir specifies the manuscript's calligrapher, and mentions only in passing the existence of illustrations in the manuscript and the luxurious gilt bind- ing.7' Documented in a contemporary literary account as well as in the manu- script itself, the gift of this slender volume exemplifies both the circulation of 55</page><page sequence="54">manuscripts as precious objects and the primacy of calligraphy in establishing the value of a book. A more comprehensive collection of the seven poems of Jami's fifteenth- century literary classic is found in a manuscript described as the Panj Ganj (Five Treasures) of Jami.72 A flyleaf note by Jahangir attests that the manu- script belonged to 'Abd al-Rahim before it entered the imperial collection in 1034/1624-25, and asserts correctly that it was copied by the famous calligra- pher Sultan 'Ali Mashhadi (fig. 2I).73 The manuscript's abundant pictorial il- lumination makes it unique among the books exchanged between the two li- braries during the lifetime of'Abd al-Rahim; two large paintings by Mushfiq appear in the middle and end of the manuscript, and every folio in the manu- script is embellished with tiny triangular paintings embedded in the outer text column as well as with large colorful designs in the borders. Yet this rich illumination, now considered to be the most prominent feature of the Panj Ganj manuscript, is completely overlooked in Jahangir's lengthy note. Man- uscripts of this period were always valued more for their calligraphy than for their paintings or illuminations. This hierarchy of the arts, which is implicit in the order, length, and detail of the biographies in the Ma'adsr-i Rahim!, is manifest injahangir's remarks on the flyleaf of the Panj Ganj. A more concrete measure of the book's value is provided by two contemporary valuations of 1,000ooo ashrafis. This amount, equal to approximately 10,000ooo rupees, made the Panj Ganj one of the most valuable manuscripts in the entire Mughal library. 21. Flyleaf note by Jahangir. Dated I624-25. Panj Ganj. Chester Beatty Library Ms. 20, f. Ia. 32.2 x 20.1 cm. The Library's Location The constant reassignment to various parts of the empire that the Khankhanan experienced was a fact of life for nearly all high-placed Mughal nobles, for it purposely inhibited the development of an independent political base. Never- theless, 'Abd al-Rahim passed repeatedly through three cities - Ahmadabad, Agra, and Burhanpur. These cities benefitted materially from his presence, as he generously supplied funds for the construction of buildings, water systems, and gardens. In 1584, he built at Sarkhej, just outside the city of Ahmadabad, the renowned garden and pleasure house of Fath Bagh (Victory Garden), which later so enchanted Jahangir that he visited the gardens twice in 1619.74 In I614, 'Abd al-Rahim constructed in Burhanpur a garden by the name of Lal Bagh (Red Garden) and a lavish residential building whose walls and ceilings were decorated with paintings.75 Under his auspices a similar building was begun on the banks of the Yamuna River at Agra, but was never completed.76 'Abd al-Rahim also built a mausoleum in Delhi for his wife, Mah Banu, who died in Ioo6/I597-98.77 The amount of time that 'Abd al-Rahim spent in Gujarat has encouraged speculation that his library was located there,78 but the only location specified in the Ma'asir-i Rahimlis the city of Sironj in Malwa.79 This was probably only a temporary location, for it was the custom of the Mughal emperors to take their books and artists along with them on their campaigns and travels, and it 56</page><page sequence="55">22. Amir Hamza slays a dragon. By Nadir al-Zamdn (Bih- bud). ca. I615. Bodleian Library, Ms. Douce or. a. i, f. 26b. I2 x 17.5 cm. is quite likely that 'Abd al-Rahim followed this practice as well.8? The huge size of the imperial library, which at the time of Akbar's death in I605 was es- timated at more than 24,000 volumes, made the constant transportation of the entire library all but impossible. Nonetheless, several references in Mughal histories indicate that emperors also maintained select personal libraries, whose smaller size would have made them more conducive to travel. These pri- vate collections may have been intended for constant perusal, but another function must have been the ready supply of gifts for ceremonial occasions, as we have seen above. No location is indicated by the style of any of 'Abd al-Rahim's illumi- nated manuscripts. Certainly there is no evidence anywhere of the strong dec- orative quality that pervades the only subimperial manuscript known to have been produced in Gujarat: the Anwar-i Suhayli dated i6oo-oi (fig. 9). The Agra region - another center of Popular Mughal painting - has been proposed as a possible provenance for the 1616-17 Razmnama on the basis of 'Abd al- Rahim's fief in the area and the "fervid Rajasthani flavor" of the paintings.8' Yet 'Abd al-Rahim spent little more than a year in this Agra fief during this period, being sent there in i6ii and then returning to the Deccan in 1612-I3; indeed, all evidence suggests that 'Abd al-Rahim passed the years around the production of the Razmnama in Burhanpur.82 In fact, of all the paintings made for 'Abd al-Rahim, only one bears any indication of its provenance. A work in the Bodleian Library depicting Amir Hamza slaying a dragon is ascribed: "the work of the destitute Wonder of the Age in the city of Burhanpur" (fig. 22). The sobriquet "Wonder of the Age" 57</page><page sequence="56">(Nddir al-Zamdn) is a common one in Islamic culture, but the presence of the Khankhanan in Burhanpur from at least i612 to I617 and the style of the paint- ing identify the artist as Bihbud, a calligrapher and painter mentioned by 'Abd al-Baqi, but whose work is otherwise unknown.83 For all its movement, then, 'Abd al-Rahim's library establishment re- mained quite insulated from regional influences, largely for reasons of its size and ability to attract prestigious individuals. Many poets and calligraphers - though not painters - came from Persia itself, and aside from Nadim, who was still a child when his Rajput father was killed, none of their Indian-born coun- terparts is named in a way which indicates their place of origin.84 Because the library establishment approached the cosmopolitanism and institutional con- stancy of the imperial workshops, ultimately the provenance of a particular manuscript tells us as little about 'Abd al-Rahim's atelier as it does in imper- ial painting itself. There was some turnover of personnel in 'Abd al-Rahim's library entourage, but it was occasioned more by the pilgrimages, retirement, and demise of its members than by the peregrinations of the Khankhanan him- self or the bulk of his library. A more important feature of the library was its habitual replenishment by a steady trickle of talent from Persia and its peri- odic relinquishment of especially accomplished figures to the auspices of the Khankhanan's imperial masters. Indeed, the biographies in the Ma'dsir-i Rah4mT collectively describe a situation in which an elite group of Mughal pa- trons - including the imperial family - shuttled poets and calligraphers back and forth among themselves almost as routinely as the valuables and precious manuscripts they regularly exchanged. For some reason, however, painters were exempted from the two-way traffic between the emperor and his com- mander-in-chief, and migrated exclusively away from the imperial workshop. In the following chapters we will see what implications this had for the com- position of 'Abd al-Rahim's atelier and the level of involvement his artists had with their patron. 58</page><page sequence="57">Notes I See John Guy and Deborah Swallow, eds., Arts of India 15o0-1900 (London: Victoria and Albert Museum, I990), no. 44; and Geeti Sen, Paintings from the Akbar Nama (Varanasi: Lustre Press, I984), pl. 15, for reproductions of the two illustrations of this episode in the ca. 1586-87 Akbarndma in the Victoria and Albert Museum (I.S. 2-1896 6/117 and 7/117). 2 For a complete review of 'Abd al-Rah. im's career, see Abu al-Fazl, A'tn-i Akbari I: 354-60, and Chhotubhai Ranchhodji Naik, 'Abdu'r-Rahim Khan-i-Khanan and His Lit- erary Circle (Ahmadabad: Gujarat University, I966), pp. 44-197. 3 Naik, p. 53. 4 Naik, p. 56. 5 Naik, p. 57. 6 Naik, p. 85. 7 The earliest dated painting by an artist associated with 'Abd al-Rahim is in the British Museum (I947-Io-II-02).

At the core of all these versions is Rama, a valorous prince who lived in the city of Ayodhya in north- ern India and later became revered as a god. Most scholars have fixed the date of the poem's composition between the eighth and sixth centuries B.C., and at- tribute a certain measure of historicity to both the author Valmiki and the events that he recounts.' Although these matters would be considered by many believers to be distractions from the essential religious truths of the Rdmayana, they were of real concern to the Mughal chronicler Bada'iuni, who balked at least as much at what he considered the text's grossly exaggerated antiquity as he did at the meaning of its stories. It is unclear which of the various Sanskrit recensions Bada'uni and others used as the basis of their Persian translation, or even whether they worked from a written text at all.2 Whatever its source, Bada'fini's translation, whose com- pletion in November 1588 makes it the first known Persian translation of this Sanskrit epic, did not acquire absolute textual authority.3 The text of the sec- ond illustrated manuscript of the Rdmaya.na manuscript, which was com- pleted in May 1594, appears to depart occasionally from the Jaipur text.4 Sim- ilarly, the text of the Freer manuscript follows Bada'unm's translation of the Rdmdyana for the most part, but differs significantly in some episodes, partic- ularly in the Uttara Kanda. Still other Persian adaptations of the Ramayana ap- peared less than a generation later, but these versions are clearly distanced from the text of the Freer manuscript by their versification, abridgement, and adap- tation of Tulasidasa's Hindi Rdmdyana.5 The Persian text of the Freer Rdmaiyana is written in a clear, but undis- tinguished nasta'llq script in a single column of twenty-one lines. The written surface measures I9.i X 9.2 cm., and the paper folios now average 27.3 x I5.5 cm., having been trimmed slightly, probably when the manuscript was re- paired and rebound in Delhi in i886.6 As a result of this rebinding, many of the notes in the lower margin have been cut and quite a few of the paintings that extend to the outer edge of the folio have suffered considerable abrasion. The sarlawh (headpiece) at the top of folio ib is the only illumination added to the manuscript's 346 folios. The words within the central cartouche have been deciphered as "In the Name of Sri Ganesa;"7 this invocation of the name of the elephant-headed Hindu god of prosperity is common in many Hindu manuscripts, but is very rare in Mughal translations of Hindu texts.8 65</page><page sequence="63">The seven major divisions of the text are entirely unadorned, and can be dis- cerned visually only by the presence of short spaces where the words of the title should have been supplied.9 The genius of the sage Valmiki in creating the Ramdayana is the subject of both the preamble of the text and the first painting (f. 6b [fig. 26]), which shows the poet taking the cry of a fallen bird as the meter of the epic. A syn- opsis of the contents of each of the seven chapters (kdndas) is provided in the second part of the introductory section (ff. 8a-I3b), which also lists both the number of stories (sargas or abaqat) and verses (slokas) in each chapter, proba- bly to demonstrate the comprehensiveness and accuracy of the text. Each of the chapters is mentioned in the Persian transliteration of its Sanskrit name. Hence, the first book, traditionally known as the Bala Kanda, is called the Adi Kanda (First Book) in this manuscript.I? In this book, the gods give divine nec- tar to King Dasaratha and his three wives; the four sons begotten as a result use their divine powers to subdue the demon Ravana. The Ayodhya Kanda (Book of Ayodhya) relates the intrigue of the jealous Kaikeyi, who blocks the in- vestiture of Dasaratha's son by another queen by using a boon she had received from him many years earlier." She demands that Rama be banished to the for- est for fourteen years and orders the installation of her own son as king. The lengthy Aranya Kanda (Forest Book) recounts the adventures of Rama's exile, which culminate in Ravana's kidnapping of Rama's wife Sita.'2 The fourth book, the Kiskindha Kanda (Book of Kiskindha, the monkey citadel), tells of the meeting of the great monkey Hanuman with Rama, the death of Vali at the hand of Rama, and the worldwide search for the abducted Sita.I3 The fifth book, the unillustrated Sundara Kanda (Beautiful Book), in- cludes the episodes of Hanuman's traverse of the sea to the island of Lafka, his discovery of the imprisoned Sita there, and his bestowal of Rama's ring to her as a sign.14 Hanuman's message to Sita, the episode related in the last line of the chapter's summary on folio 9b, is represented in the large painting on folio Ioa. The short but profusely illustrated Yuddha Kanda (Book of War) de- scribes the attack of Rama and his allies on Ravana's fortress of Lafika.5 The se- quence of events in Rama's life comes to an end in the Uttara Kand. a (Final Book). Sita's virtue is thought to be suspect as a result of her long captivity, and she is put to the fire test. Valmiki uses the device of Agastya's stories of by- gone days to tell the tales of Ravana and the gods. This book is listed as hav- ing 90 stories with 3,960 verses (f. iib:7), thus bringing the total number of textual units in the Ra-mdyana to 620 stories and 24,560 verses (f. iib:8). This prodigious and exact number accords well with the 25,000 verses that Bada'uini attributes to the Sanskrit Ramayana and attests to the completeness and fidelity of this Persian version.'6 Notations in the Manuscript The remainder of the Freer manuscript's introductory section, which ends on folio I4a with a standard invocation of God's just knowledge, extols the mer- 66</page><page sequence="64">its of the recitation of the Rdmayana, the subject of the last three paintings in the prefatory section of the text and manuscript. Adjacent to the diagonal pas- sages at the bottom of folio I3b is the marginal notation:/'Conclusion of the index of this book [and] the beginning of the story of this book." Who made this notation and the others like it? And what do these annotations tell us about the use of the manuscript? Above each of the chapters in the index is a horizontal mark with a short hook at its right end. The use of such reader's marks opposite many of the notes on the following folios makes it clear that these dashes are meant to enumer- ate members of a long series or to faciliate reference to distinct and important stories.17 Similar marks appear at the beginning of several of the initial stories which are unaccompanied by marginal notations, but these marks are soon used almost exclusively to signal the presence of marginal titles for stories, most of which are illustrated.'8 For example, the painting on folio z6a (fig. 35), which shows a huge celestial messenger rising from Dasaratha's sacrificial fire, is entitled by a marginal note beside line 20 of folio 25b: "The emergence of a person from the fire of divine nectar (homa)." Although these titular notes ap- pear regularly throughout the heavily illustrated first quarter of the manu- script, their location at the beginning of the text of the illustrated stories rather than above or below the paintings themselves indicates that they are informal headings for the text rather than captions for the paintings. Once again, these marks serve as a reminder that the readers of the Rdamyana manuscript did not focus exclusively or even primarily on the illustrations. An intriguing aspect of these notes arises in the note along the inner mar- gin on the painting on folio 57b, which depicts Visvamitra and his disciples beholding king Trisanfku suspended upside down in the sky after Indra had prevented the outcaste (canddla) king from ascending to heaven in physical form (fig. 53). The adjacent inscription reads: "There is (bdyad) the picture of the sky and Raja Trisanku in the sky... "Although it is tempting to take the presence of the word bayad, which is an auxiliary verb denoting obligation, to imply that the note is a supervisor's prescription of the requisite subject or composition for the artist, the rare initial position and isolated appearance of the word belie such a prescriptive function.'9 These titular inscriptions in the margin unequivocably postdate the il- lustrations, for they are written over the edge of the paintings on folios 53b, 56a, and 6za. Paleographic analysis of the inscriptions themselves also sup- ports this conclusion. Words omitted or written inaccurately in the text are written in the margin in a thin and relatively clear hand which recalls that of the body of the text; this implies that they were written at the same time by the very same scribe. In any case, these corrective notes clearly precede the ex- ecution of the paintings, for the artists have painted around them on several occasions.20 By contrast, most of the titular annotations in the margins are thickly and loosely written. They are almost certainly not by 'Abd al-Rahim, whose uneven, scrawly handwriting is easily recognizable from his inscription 67</page><page sequence="65">on the flyleaf of the Ramayana and many other manuscripts. Instead, the notes show strong similarities in the restrained use of unusual ligatures and the forms of specific letters to the brief note on an end paper at the beginning of the manuscript and the longest of the inspection notes on folio 346b (fig. 23).21 The inscription written along the bottom of the folio may be translated as fol- lows: Ramayana in nasta'liq script on Persian paper. The sarlawh and rulings are gold. [There are] some spotted folios, with one hundred and thir[ty?] painted pages. The outside of the binding is brown leather. The text is embellished with gold, the borders with red and silver, and the rulings with gold. The inside of the binding is medium red. The margins and rulings are gold. Transferred to (cut) from Khwaja 'Ambar on the date of the I5th of the month of Muharram year 24 of the reign of his Majesty Sulayman Makani [Shah Jahan]. [Certified by] the least of the servants, Muhammad Sailih the inspector. This descriptive inventory of the book, a regular feature of the routine inspec- tions carried out in the imperial library, provides the only record of the origi- nal binding of the book, which was quite plain by contemporary standards. Three other inspection notes supply merely a date or name, all apparently in the reign of Shah Jahan (I628-57), a period when record-keeping in the Mughal library was at its most systematic.22 Further evidence that the Ra- mayana was part of the imperial library are the impressions of eight dated seals of high-ranking nobles who served as library officials in some nominal capac- ity.23 The latest of these is dated 1069 (I658-59), a date which extends the manuscript's circulation in the imperial library to the first year of the reign of Awrangzeb; thereafter, the book disappears from the annals of the Mughal li- brary, probably because of its Hindu subject had fallen into complete disfavor at the court. The paleographic similarity of these dated inscriptions to the titular in- scriptions found throughout the body of the manuscript is evidence that the latter are not contemporary with the Ramayana's writing and illustration at the end of the sixteenth century. Unfortunately, then, the gloss tells us noth- ing of the manner in which the manuscript was used by its original owner, 'Abd al-Rahim. Instead, we must be content to understand these marginal headings as informal notations made on behalf of a later unidentified reader, almost certainly in the mid-seventeenth century. The purpose of these titular annotations was to facilitate reference to the Ramayana, whose Persian text made the Hindu epic accessible to most of the Mughal nobility for the first time. The didactic quality of this particular manuscript continues in its paint- ings, many of which bear tiny labels identifying the major protagonists and antagonists - a feature not found in the two imperial copies of the Ramayana 23. Ramayana, Freer Gallery of Art 07.271, f. 346b. 68</page><page sequence="66">or any other Mughal translation of a Hindu text.24 It seems very likely that these labels were also a later addition to the manuscript. If these inscriptions and labels provide some idea of one way in which this manuscript was used after the death of'Abd al-Rahim, a short and hitherto un- deciphered inscription on the top of folio Ia elucidates another aspect of the manuscript. Written in a large hand well apart from other inscriptions is the word chahadrum, the Persian word for fourth. In this case, the word denotes the quality of the manuscript as it was assessed by Mughal librarians, who placed virtually all books in the library into one of five qualitative classes. This low ranking of the Ramayana comes as a surprise to most modern viewers, who are inclined to be dazzled by the number and vigor of the paintings. These ele- ments, however, held considerably less importance for Mughal patrons and li- brarians, who displayed a consistent preference for finely written books, Per- sian literary content, and exquisite paper and illumination. Because it possessed none of these graces, the Rdmayana was relegated to the fourth class. It nonetheless garnered a valuation of I5o rupees because of its plentiful paint- ings.25 The material dimension of illuminated manuscripts is also implicit in Muhammad Salih's inspection note. Although the note records the number of paintings, it does not comment upon the writing or the painting; it does, how- ever, mention repeatedly the gold used in the illuminations, margins, and binding, thereby expressing the same interest in the book's preciousness that Colonel Hanna was to echo, in a naYvely misguided calculation, some three centuries later. The presence of many different scribal hands has ramifications in the many ascriptions on, below, and adjacent to the paintings. These ascriptions have generally been accepted here as authentic, for their validity in all but a very few cases is firmly supported by internal stylistic evidence. The visual cor- roboration of the majority of ascriptions to artists and a discussion of the prob- lematic ones appear in Chapter 4 in the entries for individual illustrations. One cannot state definitively that ascriptions written in a particular hand are more likely to be valid than those in another, but those written in a thin, small hand seem especially reliable. The position of the inscriptions is more telling. It seems clear that greater credence should be given to inscriptions embedded within a painting or placed in the lower margin of the folio than to those written on the protective cover sheets inserted next to many of the illustrated folios. We do not know when these thin sheets of brown, laid paper without any watermark were added to the manuscript, but they certainly preceded the rebinding in Delhi. The water stains along the upper and lower edges of the protective sheets usually - but not always - match those of the folios themselves. Moreover, in one instance (f. 87), the title inscription on the cover sheet indicates the subject of the il- lustration on folio 53b, thereby providing firm evidence for the relocation of some of these sheets. The name of the artist Ghulam 'Ali appears on the same side of the sheet, a fact which points to Ghulam 'Ali as the artist of the paint- 69</page><page sequence="67">ing on folio 53b. At the same time, the name of Syama Sundara appears in a thicker, darker ascription on the reverse of this same cover sheet. In this case, stylistic evidence makes it possible that this second ascription properly refers to the painting on folio 87a, which may have lost its original ascription to the binder's knife. Folio and Painting Numbers In addition to the modern numbers pencilled in on the upper left corner of the folios, four sets of numerals mark the manuscript. The first set of Persian numerals on the verso side of the folios indicates the folio number. Two more distinct sets of Persian numbers are given to the illustrations. The sequence below the paintings, the usual place for painting numbers in Mughal manu- scripts, is now fragmentary because the lower margin of the folios has been trimmed. Another set of painting numbers appears either in the inner or outer margin of the paintings. This set not only diverges from the one below, but also uses different forms for the numbers 2, 4, and 5. A fourth sequence consists of Nagari numerals written either above the paintings or in one of the text panels. A close examination of these four sets of numbers reveals the loss of sev- eral paintings from the manuscript. The Persian numerals on the verso of the folios correspond to the present numbering through folio 6I. Folios 62 and 63 lack these numerals, and a dis- crepancy of one folio begins with folio 64, which is numbered 65. Although mistakes in numbering do occur in manuscripts of this period, and even else- where in this manuscript, this is not the case here. The deleted catchword of folio 6ib does not obscure the obvious break in the story of the gods urging Brahma to reward Visvamitra for his austerities. The text on lines 20-2I of folio 6ib ends: "You must go before him and give him whatever he wants." (Shastri I:129:34). The last three words are written in the center of line 2I, whose lower ruling is drawn where the last line of the 21-line column would normally appear. Such variations in the layout of the writing often signal an il- lustration on the following folio, and have been noted in the painting entries when they occur. But here the text itself provides irrefutable evidence that a folio is missing. Another episode, Janaka's speech to Visvamitra, is related in the first line of folio 62a, which begins, "He said, 'Tell me what service I can do for you."' (Shastri I:131:I9). A Persian inscription on the cover sheet confirms that this lacuna arose early in the manuscript's history. A second discrepancy in the numbering of the folios occurs between fo- lios 86 and 87. Again the numerical irregularity and an ill-matched catchword suggest a missing folio. Folio 86b ends with Sita beseeching Rama for permis- sion to accompany him, but folio 87a commences with a dialogue between Rama and his brother Laksmana. The disappearance of an illustrated folio here may have coincided with the erroneous placement of the cover sheet of folio 53b at this juncture, at which a second irregularity occurs. The protective sheet between folios 85 and 86, the former with a painting ascribed to Syama Sun- 70</page><page sequence="68">dara in the lower margin, the latter being unillustrated, bears a partially legi- ble ascription which can best be read as G6vardhana, whose work is very dif- ferent than that of Syama. The modern numeration of the manuscript remains two less than the original Persian folio numbers through folio I94b, but folio I95b is numbered I98. The catchword of folio I94b is badly rubbed, but the shapes of its letters do not correspond even roughly to those of the initial words of folio 195 (shamali raft). A precise reading of the effaced catchwords as az anjd ("from there") is possible when one supplies the words of the'catchword of the corre- sponding miniature in theJaipur Rdmdyana, a manuscript whose close relation to the Freer manuscript is discussed throughout Chapter 4. The words of the three lines of text on the Jaipur miniature coincide exactly with those of the five evenly spaced lines on folio I94a of the Freer manuscript. The story, too, bears out this supposition. With much of the description of the marvels of Lafika omitted (Shastri 3:92-93), the story recommences with a description of Rama's vantage point on Mt. Suvela and proceeds to recount the battle of Sug- riva and Afngada with the giant Kumbhakarna (Shastri 3:94:2).26 Given the discontinuities in the numbering of the folios, the catchword of 194b with the initial words of folio I95a, and the narrative of the text, we may posit with con- siderable certainty the existence of a folio bearing the left half of a double-page composition. This lost painting would both repeat the format of the illustra- tion of the same subject in theJaipur manuscript (nos. IOO-01) and account for the present-day incongruity of the presentation of Rama's war council on Mt. Suvela (f. 194b) without the object of its surveillance.27 The modern numbering of the folios is consistently three less than that indicated by the original Persian numbers until the difference between the two systems is reduced inexplicably to two between folio 237 and 239; a simple mis- take is plausible here, for folio 238b is altogether unnumbered. This numeri- cal discrepancy between the modern and original numbering of the manu- script's folios reverts back to three at folio 26I and continues to the end of the manuscript. The writing and illustration of the Ramayana take a peculiar turn on folio 24oa, whose text column has an internal ruling after only two and a half lines of text. The text tells of Kumbhakarna's defeat of Mainda, in whose rescue Angada launches a new attack upon the giant. This episode is a logical subject for illustration, as are other individual combats between the monkeys and the demons in this section.28 But the painting field on this side of the folio and the entire verso of the folio remain empty, the latter displaying only the number 242 and lacking both ruling and catchword. Careful scrutiny of the text indicates that there is a break at this point. The last line on folio 24oa reads "Afgada was the son of Vali, whose limbs" (Shastri 3:226:33); the first line on folio 24Ia begins in the middle of Afigada's address to Kumbhakarna, "and today there will be a battle between you and me like the one between Indra and Sambara, and all creatures..." (Shastri 71</page><page sequence="69">3:228:23). None of several possible explanations one might offer for this puz- zling situation is entirely satisfactory. The continuous sequence of folio num- bers precludes the possibility of a folio missing here. The text on folio 240a has not been recopied because the hand in which its last three lines are written is clearly the same as the rest of the manuscript. Nor is it likely in light of the meticulous textual corrections made thoughout the manuscript that the in- tervening text passages, which were intended to be written on folio 240, were simply overlooked. Thus the most plausible hypothesis is that an artist failed to execute at least one illustration, though even this scenario does not account for the missing passages. In the case of unillustrated pages, folio numbers are usually written above the text column; for illustrated pages, they appear in the narrow upper mar- gin. In several instances they extend slightly into the area of the ruling of the painting.29 The gap around the number in the upper segment of the outer gold ruling of folio I4ob points to these numbers preceding the paintings, which were clearly executed after the text was written and before the outer gold rul- ing was drawn.30 With folio 22ob, these numbers shift downward, closer to the top of the original text column; in this painting and in all but one of the sub- sequent paintings numbered on the verso side of the folio, the Persian numeral is safeguarded by the artist, who has left a small unpainted patch around it, thereby allowing it to intrude into the composition.3I The presence of diago- nal passages in the text preceding many of these paintings leaves little doubt that the scribe intended these folios to be illustrated. The shape of the paint- ing field does not change significantly in the last third of the manuscript, as al- most all the paintings extend well beyond the height and breadth of the text column. No demonstrable reason can be offered for this minor change in the artists' approach to the folio numbers in the compositional field, but the change occurs in a section in which there is evidence of a three-year hiatus in the illustration of the manuscript. Indeed, the lack of ruling around both the lines of text written obliquely and many of the paintings themselves might be taken as a sign that the manuscript was finished in some haste. The presence of three sets of painting numbers demonstrates that the completeness of the manuscript was a constant concern for its various readers. The discrepancies among these numbering systems are quite subtle, but serve to corroborate some of the conclusions drawn from the previous analysis of the folio numbers and textual lacunae. The Nagari numbers can be readily dis- missed as a later addition to the manuscript. These numbers are accurate only until folio 59a, which passes unnumbered; thereafter the sequence simply runs one less than the actual count. The two sets of Persian numbers must be considered together. The folio missing between folios 6I and 62 apparently bore a single painting. While the lower set of numbers is very fragmentary in this section of the manuscript, the inner set matches the present count of paintings through folio 6oa (#27). The painting number on folio 6ia has lost its second digit, but the number 30 ap- 72</page><page sequence="70">9x/ul ej 0 Or'LO."t'}? WA: %7QJ. yJd 24. Rdmdyana, Freer Gallery of Art, f. Ia. pears on folio 62a, clearly indicating a loss of one painting. Wherever the lower number has been preserved, the two sets of numbers match one another in this increase of one through folio 85b.32 Yet at folio 87a, where I have posited a miss- ing folio, the inner sequence continues uninterrupted. The number in the lower margin of this painting has been lost, but that of the next painting (f. 88a) reads 48, or two more than the present count and one more than that of the inner margin. The discordance between the two sets of painting numbers inexplicably increases to two between folios 88a and 92a, a section in which there are no ap- parent textual or codicological irregularities, thus undermining somewhat the authority of the lower painting number sequence. The discrepancy of two paintings continues through folio IIsa, the last folio before I94b to be num- bered in the lower margin. Folio i94b is numbered 77 in the inner margin, but the following painting on folio I97b is numbered 78, thereby contradicting ev- idence for a painting missing at this point. No number has been preserved in the lower margin of folio 197b, but the painting on folio i99b displays the number 82, four more than the actual count and three more than the 79 in the inner margin. Hence, the painting numbers in the lower margin reflect the third lacuna indicated above. By contrast, the writing of the painting numbers in the inner margin seems to have postdated the removal of folios after 86b and I94b, but preceded the loss of the folio after 6ib. Neither painting number sequence is disrupted at folios zo8a or 226a, be- fore which appear irregularities in the catchword. A final disruption in the lower sequence of painting numbers occurs between folio 259a, which is num- bered io6, and folio 29ob, numbered ii6. As there is no apparent reason for this increase to five over the actual number of paintings, one might be inclined to dismiss the evidence of these painting numbers in favor of that of the con- vincing combination of folio numbers, catchwords, and textual gaps discussed above. But another bit of information in the manuscript tallies too well with this total of 135 paintings for one to dismiss the possibility altogether. 'Abd al-Rahim's Inscription Scattered throughout the manuscript are several notes attesting that there are 130 paintings in the manuscript.33 The inspection note on folio 346b normally would have clarified this situation, but unfortunately does not because it is ef- faced precisely where the number of paintings is recorded. Thus, the total of I35 paintings indicated by the painting numbers is affirmed in only one place in the manuscript - 'Abd al-Rahim's note on folio ia (fig. 24). Because the in- formation contained in this flyleaf note is critical to many aspects of the manu- script, a new translation of the note is given below: This book, which is known as the Ramayana, is among the esteemed books of India. It is an account of Rimacandra, who was one of the great kings of India. His external and spiritual graces were exemplary, being 73</page><page sequence="71">manifestations of divine attributes. According to Valmiki, who was among the greatest darvishes of India, it is said that he [Ramacandra] is the son of Mahadeva [Siva]. [These] discourses are an account of his grace- ful attributes, pleasing virtues, great victories, and conduct, which show the magnificence of his being. At the order of the officials of His Majesty Akbar, Naqib Khan of Qazwin, who was among the high-ranking lords and became exalted in the companionship and service of the king of kings, was honored and made eminent by the love of the king.34 He trans- lated [this book] into Persian from the Sanskrit language, in which In- dian literature was recorded at the time. There was a brahman by the name of Deva Misra who would interpret the meaning of the verses (slokas) and Naqib Khan would translate [that] into Persian. The desire of the king, that king ofJamshid-like magnificence, on this occasion was that paintings be executed in this book. Upon completion of that [work], this slave reared by the kindnesses of the Emperor, 'Abd al-Rahim, son of Bayram Khan (may he rest in peace), requested that as I had the privilege of seeing this book, I be allowed to have a copy made. By royal favor, per- mission was granted. This work was prepared and illustrated by the scribes and painters of this well-wisher of the king. Thus, it may be viewed by people.35 This work was completed in the year A.H. I007 [A.D. 1598-99]. The beginning of the work and illumination of this work was made in the year 996 Hijra [A.D. 1587-88]. The total number of paintings is i35,36 and the number of leaves is 349 leaves.37 It was completed under the term of the supervision of the loyal and gracious Mulla Shakibi Imami, and reached completion by the mercy of God. This inscription, the most comprehensive note on a manuscript associated with 'Abd al-Rahim, provides an important checklist of the aspects of the manuscript that merited his attention as a patron. First, because the Ramayana was an unfamiliar text, 'Abd al-Rahim begins by describing its subject. His erroneous identification of Rama as the son of Mahadeva, another name for Siva, poses a troubling question. How could someone interested enough in Hindu culture to commission an illustrated copy of this text be unaware of an important belief of Hinduism, that is, that Rama is an incarnation of Visnu? That this point is emphasized repeatedly even in the Persian text of the Freer Rdmdyana raises doubts about how carefully 'Abd al-Ra.him actually read the manuscript or at what level he understood it. Second, 'Abd al-Rahim addresses the circumstances under which the Persian translation of the Rama-yana came into being. He overlooks Bada'uni, who, as we have seen, took credit for his translation of the Ra-ma-yana even as he feared divine reprisal for his part in spreading blasphemy; instead, the Khankhanan cites Naqib Khan, who played an important role in the transla- tion of the Mahdbhdrata. Should we conclude from this discrepancy that there 74</page><page sequence="72">25. Hanuman defeats the rdksasa guards. Designed by Miskina, painted by Kesava Kh-urd. Dated iooo/ I59I-92. Rdmayana, I588-92. Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II Museum, Jaipur, A.G. no. I94I. were, in fact, two different translations or should we dismiss it as a factual error? The third point raised by the Khankhanan is the impetus for his com- mission of this particular text. He states that he requested permission to have his own illustrated copy of the Rdmayana made after he had seen Akbar's illustrated manuscript of the same text. 'Abd al-Rahim does not specify which of the two imperial Rdmdyana manuscripts he saw, but it is probably safe to as- sume that it was the earlier and more profusely illustrated manuscript, which is now in Jaipur.38 'Abd al-Rahim then locates the production of the manuscript in time. His mention of both inception and completion dates is quite unusual in this kind of note. He continues with a brief physical description of the manuscript itself, specifying only the number of folios and paintings. This kind of inven- tory often appears in inspection notes written by library officials, but is rarely found in notes by the patron. Finally, 'Abd al-Rahim informs us that the manuscript was completed under the term of the supervision of Mulla Shakibi. Once again, this type of information is virtually unprecedented in contempo- rary Mughal manuscripts. Indeed, one wonders what moved 'Abd al-Rahim to include it in his remarks. Our natural inclination to believe such a presumably authoritative source as the patron himself and to rejoice at the windfall of detailed information written directly on the manuscript is soon tempered, however, by some nag- ging problems with the substance of these remarks. We will concentrate on the last three points, which are somewhat more verifiable than the others. 'Abd al-Rahim's total of 349 folios in the manuscript is supported by the evidence presented earlier for the loss of three illustrated folios from the Freer Rdmayana, but his contention that there are 135 paintings is less conclusively demonstrable. The two sections (ff. 88-92; 259-90) in which discrepancies arise between the number of paintings indicated by the painting numbers in the lower margin and the 133 paintings as reconstructed here show no sign of the loss of illustrated folios. To judge the number of paintings, then, one must ultimately assess the reliability of the remainder of 'Abd al-Rahim's state- ment. The Date of the Manuscript The accuracy of this element of 'Abd al-Ra.him's inscription is undermined by evidence which overturns the chronology he sets forth for the illustration of the Rdmayana. If, as 'Abd al-Rahim asserts, he ordered his copy of the Ramayazna begun in 996/December I587-November I588, he would have had to have done so even before the writing of the imperial manuscript was completed, and well before the illustrations were finished in circa I592 (fig. 25).39 Although this sit- uation is unlikely in its own right, it is made all the more implausible by the appearance of the date Ioo6/I597-98 below the painting on folio 92a (fig. 79). It is very difficult to imagine a ten-year period between the beginning of the 75</page><page sequence="73">project and the execution of an illustration little more than one-third of the way into the painting cycle, particularly when one considers the many artists involved and the mediocre quality of many of the paintings. Moreover, the date of the manuscript's completion as stated by 'Abd al-Ra.him is wholly be- lied by the presence of the date of the first of Sha'ban I009/5 February I60o in the lower margin of the painting on folios I22b (fig. 98) and 2 Ramazan I009/6 March I60o below the painting on I97b (fig. io8). These dates coincide with a surprising change in the density of the man- uscript's painting cycle. After an allocation of one illustration for approxi- mately every two folios up to folio 140, a lengthy section of text comprising the Kiskindha Kanda, the Sundara Kanda, and a few folios of the Yuddha Kanda (ff. I41-93) passes entirely unillustrated. There is nothing peculiar about the subjects of these books to explain this absence of illustrations; the correspond- ing books in the Jaipur Rdmdyana, whose painting cycle is slightly more extensive, receive as many as sixteen images. Nor is this aberration in the painting cycle of the Freer Radmdyana the result of a temporal hiatus, for the unillustrated section is, in fact, bracketed by paintings dated only a month apart in Ioo9/I6oi.40 Paradoxically, the eighteen stylistically consistent paintings between folios I97b and 244a span another three-year period. The artist's name (Qasim) and the date IOI2/I603-04 are written clearly on the painting field of folio 244a, thus providing conclusive evidence for a revised chronology of the Rdmayana's illustration (fig. I27). Finally, the appearance of the date IOI3/1604-05 below a painting near the end of the manuscript (f. 333b) sug- gests that the illustration of the Rdmdyana was actually completed in that year, some six years after the date given by 'Abd al-Rahim (fig. I58). These factual errors in 'Abd al-Rahim's own statement about the manu- script make it clear that all information - no matter how contemporary or es- timable the source - should be regarded critically and be corroborated with all manner of physical evidence in the manuscript. Errors in the fine points of foliation and even chronology might tarnish 'Abd al-Rahim's absolute au- thority on the specific details of a manuscript, but they should hardly detract from his well-earned reputation as an ardent and informed bibliophile. Instead we might ponder whether the level of accuracy that we now strive for in such codicological and chronological matters was a real concern to Mughal patrons and librarians. Indeed, in the following chapter, we will see that this kind of approximation also characterizes the ascriptions identifying the artists repon- sible for individual paintings in the Freer Rdmdyana. 76</page><page sequence="74">Notes I For a summary of the scholarly debate of these issues, see the introduction by Robert Goldman to The Ramayana of Vdlmiki: An Epic of Ancient India. Volume I: Bdlakdnda (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1984), pp. 3-29. 2 In her notes for the internal catalogue of the Freer Gallery, Grace Dunham Guest sug- gested that the Freer text was closest to the Bengal recension used by Manmatha Nath Dutt in his translation of the Ramdyana (Calcutta: H.C. Dass, I891-94). 3 Bada'uni, Muntakhabu't-TawdrTkh 2: 346-347, gives 992/1584 as the year in which he began the translation of the Rdamyana. In the same text, 2: 378, he mentions Jumada I 997/March-April 1589 as the date of the translation's completion. Asok Das, "An intro- ductory note on the Emperor Akbar's Ramayana and its miniatures," in Facets of Indian Art (London: Victoria and Albert Museum, I986), p. 96, has published the date of the colophon of the Ramayana in the Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II Museum, Jaipur, as 28 Zi'l-Hijja 997/November I588. As I have pointed out elsewhere, A.H. 997 is not the equivalent of A.D. I588. On the assumption that the year 997 was correct, I have previ- ously published the date of the completion of the writing of the Jaipur manuscript as November I589. During a later examination of a photograph of the colophon, however, I found the date clearly to be 996, which would restore the date to 6 November I588. 4 Based on the limited portion of the manuscript available for study to date, the text of the I594 manuscript appears to be identical to that of the Freer Ramayana. 5 Giridharadisa composed the Ramnama, a 5,900-verse adaptation of Tulasidasa's Hindi Ramayana in 1033/1623-24 and dedicated it to Jahangir; copies of this text are preserved in the British Library (Or. I25I), the India Office Library (nos. I965-66), and the Biblio- theque Nationale (no. 22I). This version is discussed by R. Sharma, "A Little Known Per- sian Version of the Ramayan," Islamic Culture 7 (I933): 673-78. A second poetical trans- lation of the Vulgate, entitled Ram wa Sita, was composed in the same period by Masih Panipati; examples of this text are in the India Office Library (nos. I967-69) and the Bodleian Library (no. 2350). Another translation was rendered by Sandarman in 1097/i685-86, while yet another poetical version in the India Office Library was written by an anonymous author. The Bodleian Library preserves a copy of the Rama Avatdr-i Valmiki, an undated abridged masnawl version of the Ramayana different than the ver- sions listed above (Ms. Ind. Inst. Pers. ioo). Three eighteenth-century copies of what is thought to be Bada'uni's translation of the Valmiki Ramayana are in the British Library (Or. I248, Or. 5087) and the India Office Library (no. I963). The best account of the Per- sian versions of the Ramayana may be found in C. Hermann Ethe, Catalogue of Persian Manuscripts in the Library of the India Office (Oxford: H. Hart, I903), pp. 1095-99. The versions are placed within the context of Persian translations of Sanskrit literature in Gorekar, "Sanskrit Lore in Persian," pp. 33-38. 6 The modern binding was removed from the manuscript in I98I in order to preserve the paintings and to facilitate their study and exhibition. A systematic analysis of the man- 77</page><page sequence="75">uscript's gatherings has been precluded by this conservation measure as well as by the crude repairs along the crease of the brittle folios. 7 This translation of the hitherto undeciphered inscription was provided by Woodman Taylor of the University of Chicago in a lecture presented at the I991 symposium of the American Committee for the Study of South Asian Art. 8 Rizvi, Religious and Intellectual History, p. 2I2, notes that Abu al-Fazl's preface to the Razmnama begins with the phrase "gri Ganefaya namah." 9 The Adi Kanda begins on f. I3b, the Ayodhya Kanda on f. 69a, the Aranya Kanda on f. I5b, the Kiskindha Kanda on f. I4oa, the Sundara Kanda on f. I62a, the Yuddha Kanda on f. I87a, and the Uttara Kanda on f. 286a. Titles are not supplied for the last four books. Io The Adi Kanda is listed as comprising 64 stories and 2,8I5 verses (f. 8a:2). 11 This book is said to contain 80 stories consisting of 4,180 verses (f. 8b:2). 12 The number of verses in this chapter is given as 104,150 (f. 9a:Io). 13 This chapter numbers 64 stories and 2,925 verses (f. 9b:4). 14 This chapter comprises I43 stories with 2,045 verses (f. IOa:3). I5 These dramatic events unfold in only I05 verses (f. iia:8). i6 Bada'uni, Muntakhabu't-Tawarikh 2: 346-47 gives the number of verses. The word couplet is used misleadingly as a substitute for the Sanskrit word sloka, which is translit- erated repeatedly into Persian in this text. 17 For example, the six fruits of the churning of the ocean are enumerated on ff. 47b:I6, 48a:8, 48a:9 (two items), 48a:Io, and 48a:II. I8 These marks are found on ff. I5a:Io, i6a:i, and i6b:II. 19 A similar note over the lower right corner of the painting on folio 56a (fig. 52) reads: "There must be the sacrifice of Raja Trisafiku" (Jog bayad Trisanku raja ast). Notes actu- ally prescribing the subject to be illustrated are found in several Mughal manuscripts, including the British Library Baburnama and the Chester Beatty Library Akbarnama; two examples in the former use the phrase "ought to be drawn" (bayad kashid). For a dis- cussion of these and other notes, see Seyller, "Scribal Notes on Mughal Manuscript Il- lustrations," pp. 247-77. 20 See ff. 98b, 247a, and 336a. 21 The narrow letter nun is especially similar to those on the end paper at the front of the manuscript and on folio 346b. 22 The following inspection notes appear at the beginning and end of the manuscript. End- paper at the beginning of the manuscript: On the first of Jumada II year 7 entrusted to the servant of the court, Muhammad Muzaffar. Folio Ia: On Jumada I year 7. Year 1069 (I658-59). God is almighty. Inspected on the date of 26 Isfandar year 9 (I7 March i636). Folio 346b: Inspected on 28 Jumada I year 28 (i6 March I655). On the first of Jumada II year 7 entrusted to Muhammad Muzaffar. For the context of these and other kinds of library notations, see Seyller, "The Inspection and Valuation of Manuscripts in the Im- perial Mughal Library." 23 Folio Ia bears the seals of Muhammad 'Arif, disciple of Shah Jahan Padshah 1045 (1635-36); and 'Abd al-Rashid Daylami, servant of Shah Jahan, 1048 (I638-39). Folio 78</page><page sequence="76">346b is impressed with the seals of Muhammad Husayn, servant of Shah Jahan; Muhammad 'Ali Shah Jahani; I'timad Khan, servant of Shah Jahan 1063 (I652-53); 'In- ayat Khan Shah Jahani year 3I, io68 (I657-58); and Sayyid 'Ali al-Husayni, disciple of 'Alamgir Padshah 1069 (i658-59). 24 Labels are extremely rare in Mughal painting. To my knowledge, only a few paintings in the Hamzanama (Museum fur Angewandte Kunst, Vienna, nos. 8770/6,29,41,42, and 54) bear contemporary labels on the figures themselves. The labels on each painting are indicated in the entries in Chapter 4. 25 This amount is written directly below the word chaharum in a scribal shorthand known as raqam. For a detailed discussion of the qualitative categories and values of manu- scripts, see Seyller, "The Inspection and Valuation of Manuscripts in the Imperial Mughal Library." 26 The pages in the translation by Shastri are given for the convenience of the reader. None of the English translations of the Sanskrit Rdmdyana corresponds exactly to the Persian text. Pages of description are omitted regularly or condensed in the Persian version, but the narrative development is rarely affected. 27 See the entry for f. I94b in Chapter 4 for a further discussion of the painting. 28 Illustrations for such combats occur on ff. 24Ia, 242a, and 244a. 29 See ff. iib, iz8b, I4ob, i94b. 30 The rulings pass slightly over many of the manuscript's paintings; the clearest example of this is f. 35b (fig. 40). 31 It is possible that the folio numbers on previous verso paintings were rewritten after the paintings were executed. The artists have painted right up to the edge of the folio num- bers on folios 197b and 200ob. After this, only f. 228b is numbered above the painting. The small area in which the folio number and occasionally the Nagari painting number are written appears on ff. 237b, 303b, 3iib, 3i2b, 3I7b, 324b, 333b, and 34Ib. 32 See ff. 68b, 79b, 8ia, 85b. 33 These loosely written notes appear on two end papers at the beginning of the manuscript; on ff. ib, i28b, and 245b; and on the cover sheets of ff. IO, 265, and 285. 34 Akbar is called here by his posthumous name, 'Arsh Ashyani, literally "Nestling at the foot of the divine throne." The use of this name is unequivocable evidence that the in- scription was written after Akbar's death in October I6o5. 35 The Persian phrase, "dar nazar-i ydrdn .h.zir ast," (literally, "may appear in the sight of friends") does not have a populist connotation. It is reasonable to surmise that the manu- script was viewed by 'Abd al-Rahim and his associates. 36 The word majalis normally construes assemblies or conversations, but is used here to in- dicate paintings or events; the word appears in a similar usage in the biography of the painter Madhava in the Ma'dsir-i Rah1mi. 37 The number of paintings and folios is erroneously given as I25 and 649 in Beach, The Im- perial Image, p. I35, where this inscription is mistakenly published as a colophon on f. 364r. 38 The colophon of the second Radmayana indicates that it was written at Akbar's request and provides the date of 27 Aban the Ilahi month, or 25 Sha'ban 1002/I6 May 1594. Its 79</page><page sequence="77">imperial standing is further corroborated by numerous contemporary inscriptions, in- cluding one written by Jahingir upon his accession. 39 Normally one would expect that the illustrations of a manuscript of this size would be completed no more than two years after the text was copied, but the number ooo1000, which I take to be a date of A.H. IOOO/A.D. October I59I-October I592 written from right to left, appears beneath the preliminary ascription to Kesava Khurd on the ninety-first painting in the manuscript. There is no other explanation for this peculiar number. The three dots are aligned horizontally, and therefore cannot be part of the ascription to Kesava; moreover, the vertical element to their right would still beg an explanation. Mughal scribes often left such graffiti in the margins of manuscript illustrations or even on the paintings themselves, and dates are occasionally written backwards in the Islamic tradition. One contemporary example is a painting of Neptune by Abu al-Hasan in the Goenka collection; the date is clearly written as IIno, or the reverse of the intended date of IOII/I602-03. Thus the illustration of the original copy of the Ramayana was proba- bly completed approximately four years after the text was first translated and written out. 40 See ff. I22b and I97b (figs. 98, Io8). Beach, The Imperial Image, p. I35, argues that the dom- inance of Syima Sundara and the existence of this long unillustrated section underscore problems in the production of the manuscript. 80</page><page sequence="78">IV The Illustrations of the Freer Ramayana Introduction As the earliest and most profusely illustrated manuscript prepared for 'Abd al- Rahim, the Freer Ramayana provides the initial key to the visual interests and habits of the artists employed by the Khankhanan. To arrive at a better un- derstanding of the distinctive workings of 'Abd al-Rahim's atelier, we can begin by answering for the Freer Ramayana some of the most fundamental questions presented by illuminated manuscripts: Who chose the scenes to be illustrated? What determined their imagery and compositions? And to what extent were the illustrations shaped by a unifying aesthetic? Before the Rdamadyana was translated from Sanskrit into Persian in the late i58os, its stories were probably only vaguely familiar to Muslim artists in India. Although the tales themselves must have been known by most Hindu artists, the Ramayana does not seem to have possessed a strong visual tradition, that is, a standard set of images associated with it. The Ramayana had been il- lustrated, of course, before the late sixteenth century in both sculpture and in- digenous Indian painting, but these representations are less plentiful and com- prehensive than one might expect, and were probably unknown to the artists working for 'Abd al-Rahim.' In the case of the Freer Radmayana, the customary search for visual sources is simplified, with only two probable models: theJaipur Ramayana, whose text was completed in November 1588 and whose illustration in the imperial Mughal atelier followed soon thereafter, and the 1594 Ramadyana. Although the text of the latter seems to have been repeated exactly in the Freer Ramayana, the subjects of its fifty-five paintings do not appear to correspond very closely to those of the Khankhanan's manuscript. Moreover, it is very unlikely that 'Abd al-Rahim would presume to commission a manuscript with more illus- trations than the second imperial copy. This leaves the Jaipur manuscript of the Rimayana as the most logical source of inspiration. With such a presti- gious model easily available to 'Abd al-Rahim, who claims to have inspected the imperial manuscript personally, whoever chose the program of illustration for the Freer Ramayana could copy wholesale the choices made for either im- perial manuscript. This is largely the situation with the Freer Ramayana, whose 130 extant illustrations are remarkably congruent in subject to the I76 paintings in the Jaipur manuscript, as can be seen in the individual entries that follow.2 One way in which the Freer Rdmayana painting cycle maintains its congruence with that of the the Jaipur manuscript in spite of its shortfall of forty-six illustrations is by normally alloting only one painting for each 81</page><page sequence="79">episode illustrated, including those which receive a double-page illustration in theJaipur manuscript. Yet it is the points at which the painting cycle of the Freer copy deviates completely from that of the Jaipur manuscript that bring out the most revealing aspects of the working procedures of 'Abd al-Rahim's atelier. Although the patron is often posited as the central figure in the creative process, there is no evidence to suggest that 'Abd al-Rahim personally directed his librarians and artists to follow the painting cycle of the Jaipur Rdmdyana. Neither 'Abd al-Rahim nor his biographer claims such a determinative role in the arts; instead, the Khankhanan writes on the flyleaf of the Radmdyana that the manuscript was produced under the supervision of Mulla Shakibi Imami, a functionary in the library workshop. What was the nature of this supervision? My studies of a wide range of imperial Mughal manuscripts of the sixteenth century have led me to conclude that the task of choosing the number and position of illustrations in a manu- script normally fell to those directly involved in its production. In Chapter 2, we were introduced to several men who held the position of supervisor or deputy librarian in 'Abd al-Rahim's atelier. Following the directions of one of these men, quite probably Mulla Shakibi, the scribe broke off the writing of the text at designated points in the narrative to leave space for the illustrations. This basic decision was then further refined by the individual artist, who chose which aspect of the given episode to depict. It appears that artists rarely used direct knowledge of the text to make such a decision independently; rather, they seem to have been given instructions by a person in a position of higher authority. Sometimes the artist received a synopsis of the episode as a whole, presumably in oral form. In certain instances - though not in the Freer manuscript - these summaries are preserved as scribal notes written at the bot- tom of the painting field or around the margins of the folio; these notes, which are written in Persian in a difficult cursive script, were probably intended to be consulted later by someone acting in a supervisory role, or possibly even by the artist himself. Other times the artist seems to have responded to informa- tion related explicitly in the passages immediately before or above the paint- ing field. Here, too, it is likely that someone conveyed the substance of these passages to the artist, although it is remotely possible that the artist himself read short selections of the text. Whatever the means of transmission, these supervisory instructions address only the subject of the illustration; in no case do they comment on how the artist should render the scene. Most illustrations in the Freer manuscript fall at virtually the same point in the text as the corresponding painting in the Jaipur Radmdayana. When the placement of an illustration in the text differs significantly in the two manu- scripts, or in the rare cases when the Freer R,amayana illustrates a subject not shown in the Jaipur manuscript, 'Abd al-Rahim's artists generally adhere to the textual description much more literally, as if they are unsure of what kind of scene is required. This suggests that 'Abd al-Rahim's workshop drew from 82</page><page sequence="80">the imperial Ramaiyana not only the initial design of the painting cycle of the Freer manuscript, but also the basic conceptual framework of individual illus- trations. In other words, 'Abd al-Rahim's artists occasionally used the exam- ples of the Jaipur paintings to simplify their own narrative choices. The relationship between the Freer and Jaipur manuscripts can be qualified further by a comparison of their treatment of the detailed iconogra- phy of the Hindu tradition. Generally speaking, the standard features of Hindu deities are presented accurately more often in the illustrations of the Jaipur manuscript than in those of the Freer Rdmdyana. Several errors in the Freer manuscript suggest that this is less a matter of outright ignorance than of carelessness. Nearly every artist, for example, strays from the mandatory representation of Rama's dark complexion in at least one of his illustrations. Nor should we tie iconographic accuracy to the religion of the artist, for as many lapses appear in the paintings of Mohana, presumably a Hindu artist, as in those of Yfisuf 'Ali, whose name unquestionably indicates that he was a Muslim. Another dimension of the Mughal treatment of Hindu iconography is better explained as a deliberate simplification rather than as a misunderstand- ing or oversight. It is relatively easy for artists to endow the major Hindu figures with their necessary attributes when they present them in isolation, as when they seat the gods in a celestial gallery, but the Ramayana story often calls for these figures to assume altered appearances. Hence, the artist is pre- sented with a dilemma: whether to maintain a fixed iconography and disregard the specific circumstances in which a particular deity or protagonist appears or to comply with the varying textual descriptions and risk the possibility of misidentification. In both the Jaipur and Freer manuscripts, the artists consis- tently choose the former option and employ a kind of consolidated iconogra- phy by which a given figure can be recognized most readily. Accordingly, they depict Indra as a deity no matter what his guise, and almost always show Rama as a warrior wearing a crown topped with flowers - a standard attribute of Hindu kings in Mughal painting. In the Freer manuscript, the tendency to dwell on the essential rather than the literal is extended from the realm of iconography to that of the narra- tive itself. The artists ignore minor temporal distinctions within the story, and regularly minimize physical changes which occur during the course of a par- ticular episode (such as wounds or disfigurements) in order to cast the major figures in their most characteristic form. These narrative contractions are far more prominent in the Freer Rdmayana than in the Jaipur manuscript, whose elaborate illustrations often approximate the narrative wealth of the text. Although the two Rdmayana manuscripts are extremely similar in terms of what they represent, they are much less consistent in how they depict the various scenes. Mughal artists adopt a longstanding Indian tradition of pre- senting the particular in terms of the general; in manuscript illustration this practice takes the form of reducing specific, textually described events to types 83</page><page sequence="81">of scenes with which artists are most familiar - audiences, battles, conversa- tions, and the like - and then merely sprinkling them with a few distinguish- ing details. This typological approach to narrative illustration is common to the imperial workshop and the Khankhanan's atelier, but it is more obvious in the latter because of the narrower range of types and diminished variety within each type. Beyond a general similarity in compositional types, there is no evidence of a direct quotation of specific visual features from the Jaipur manuscript in the paintings of the Freer Rdmdyana. Rather, the Freer illustrations appear al- most as abridged versions of the Jaipur paintings and imperial painting in general. The throngs of figures frequently seen in the Jaipur manuscript dissi- pate in the Freer Rdmayana, leaving the painting field to be occupied only by the major characters of the narrative. The remaining figures lose much of the variety of pose and facial expression seen in the imperial version, and are gen- erally arrayed in such a way that they overlap as little as possible. Although this pictorial simplification was surely intended to minimize the technical de- mands placed on 'Abd al-Rahim's artists, a more interesting by-product is a static quality which pervades the Rdmdyana's illustrations, and by extension colors our understanding of its narrative. Rather than becoming caught up in the visual pyrotechnics of the image or the physical and emotional activity de- picted therein, as one is inclined to do with many imperial illustrations, one tends to respond to the simpler structure and calmer rhythms of the Freer illustrations by focusing on the more enduring dimensions of the subject. Rama's actions no longer seem motivated by ordinary sentiments or logic, but become effortless, inevitable, even divinely ordained. In their consistent nar- rative and visual simplication 'Abd al-Rahim's artists - unwittingly perhaps - come closer to the devotional spirit of the Rdmayana. The Freer illustrations diverge frequently enough in iconography and composition from those of the Jaipur manuscript to preclude a copy based on careful observation of individual Jaipur paintings. This leads me to conclude that the painters of the Freer Ra-madyana did not use the illustrations of the Jaipur Rdmayana as direct visual models, but worked instead from something like a checklist of subjects, such as the one presented here as Appendix A. The striking consistency in text points, that is, the precise point where the text is interrupted for the illustration, suggests that this basic indication of the sub- ject may have been accompanied by some verbal indication of the specific text passage to which the illustration should be keyed. Fourteen of the twenty-one painters known to have worked for 'Abd al- Rahim were involved in the illustration of the Freer Rdmayana. Because their numbers were smaller than those of the imperial workshop, the artists in 'Abd al-Rahim's atelier seem to have arrived at a different working procedure. Al- though it was usual practice in the imperial workshop for two or three artists to collaborate in the design and execution of a manuscript illustration, in 'Abd al-Rahim's atelier it was the general rule for an illustration to be assigned to a 84</page><page sequence="82">single artist. This is supported by the relatively plentiful ascriptions, a term used to denote the proposed authorship of a painting when the artist's name is written by someone other than the artist himself. On the basis of these ascrip- tions and the few actual signatures in the Freer Ramayana, we can attribute, or credit to a particular artist, the remainder of the illustrations in the manu- script. All attributions included in Table i and presented in the entries for individual illustrations are my own.

Nonetheless, there are a number of idiosyncratic features by which the personal styles of in- dividual artists can be identified. Foremost among these is the range of figure and facial types. Particular rock and tree forms are also significant elements in this scheme, as is the general palette of the illustration. Although several artists avail themselves of similar treatments of certain of these formal features, they habitually use them in unique combinations. Careful scrutiny of minute details and general compositional patterns allows one to attribute most paint- ings with considerable confidence. Surprisingly misleading, however, is a criterion frequently used in the attribution of Indian paintings, that is, the varying degrees of technical proficiency. Several artists, notably Nadim and gyama Sundara, display an un- expected ability to produce disturbingly cursory efforts as well as meticulously detailed paintings. Elsewhere I have offered a temporal (and by extension, monetary) explanation for the occurrence of different levels of quality in im- perial manuscript illustration, which is summarized in Chapter I.3 This expla- nation does not seem to apply to the Freer Rdmdyana, however, because its fluc- tuations occur within a single manuscript, where formal expectations or instructions usually did not change very much. Instead I believe that the unevenness of painting in the Rdmdyana is re- lated to the weakness of the institutional controls of 'Abd al-Rahim's atelier, which probably reached its ultimate size and configuration shortly after the production of the Rdmdyana began. Several trends in the manuscript support this conclusion. First, it is clear from Table i that different artists dominated various sections of the Freer Rdmayana. While it was relatively common in the imperial atelier for a given artist to be assigned a role in several consecutive illustrations, that tendency is exaggerated here. An artist such as Govardhana, for example, executes nine of the first nineteen illustrations in the manuscript and then vanishes from sight. Syama Sundara and Y-usuf'AlI also have densely concentrated sequences of paintings. This unusual distribution of paintings suggests that individual artists were given unusually free reign as to which illustrations they completed. Furthermore, the stylistic variations within many of these sequences cannot be explained as changes which occurred over time, for they do not conform to the chronological hiatuses in the production of the manuscript outlined in Chapter 3. Hence, an individual artist's inspira- tion or perfunctoriness does seem to have played an uncommonly decisive role in the qualitative fluctuations in the Rdmdyana's illustrations. I would con- clude from this that the supervisors of 'Abd al-Ra.him's workshop did not manage to impose a cohesive taste or technical standard upon the atelier's members from the outset of the Ramdyana project. This is not to say that the artists operated entirely independently of one another. On the contrary, during the course of the Rdmayana's illustration, several of the artists in 'Abd al-Rahlm's employ who had demonstrated some 86</page><page sequence="84">ability to work in the technically demanding imperial Mughal idiom ceased to contribute to the manuscript or drifted away from that style. The relin- quishment of imperial norms is paralleled by the gradual blurring of distinc- tions between artists' personal styles. Taking Syima as an example once again, we see this prolific artist slowly abandon his thinly painted, detailed style for one more attuned to the broader, more dramatic compositions favored by Fazl, Qasim, and Kamal, quite probably in direct response to their work. That this style is shared by most illustrations in the last third or so of the manuscript (which are dated to circa I604-05) suggests that the atelier developed some sort of organizational mechanism to ensure greater uniformity among the illustra- tions of a particular manuscript. Two final observations support the emergence of a stronger central authority in 'Abd al-Rahim's atelier. First, the internal variations present in the Rdmdyana paintings disappear in the later projects, which are remarkably homogeneous in style from beginning to end. Second, the consensual style of the Ramdyana's conclusion not only continues as the pervasive style in a few of these later projects, it also coincides with the appearance of completely differ- ent styles in 'Abd al-Rahim's atelier. That these different styles are employed concurrently by the same group of artists demonstrates the existence of a heightened, perhaps even self-conscious awareness of style, as well as an insti- tutional authority developed enough to have deliberate artistic choices imple- mented in a cohesive fashion. 87</page><page sequence="85">Critical Description of the Illustrations 88</page><page sequence="86">6b A fowler kills a bird and the cry of its mate gives Valmiki the I meter in which he composes the Ramayana .?

Shastri I: 27 Text: Diagonal passages on the preceding folio; 4 11. below Published: Beach, The Imperial Image, isb (fig. 29) This outstanding painting illustrates a colorful encapsulated story recounted to King Dasaratha as a means of enlisting the aid of the sage Rsyasrnfiga in performing a sacrifice for a son. To alleviate the drought afflicting the people of Afiga, King Lomapada sends a group of beautiful women to lure the un- witting Rsyasrnga, who has never seen women before, from his father's hermitage. Plying Rsyasrnfiga with sweetmeats and songs, the women succeed in enticing the smitten sage to their city, which is showered with rain upon Rsyasrnfiga's arrival. In gratitude, Lomapada offers Rsyasrnga his daugh- ter Santa in marriage. Two women begin the verbal seduction of the one- horned youth, while four others peek out coyly from behind trees. With the exception of two maidens whose faces have been clumsily repainted, all the women are far more elegant in countenance and dress than the figure of Sita on folio ioa. The central woman shows a gently curved profile, smaller facial features, a delicate beaded odhani, and a swaying, nar- row-waisted body. Her charms are not lost on the refined young sage, whose own wispy locks, lightly modeled neck, and flaring orange dhoti show no sign of being coarsened by a lifetime of hermitic existence. The corresponding illustrations in the two imperial manuscripts offer a particularly instructive comparison of the three manuscripts. The Jaipur miniature (no. 2) depicts Rsyasrnfga kneeling before a hut fronted by a raised forecourt of pounded earth and positioned obliquely in the composi- tion (fig. 30). The maidens' serenade and flirtations have already begun to take their toll, as the wide-eyed sage reaches tentatively to caress the breast of one of his unexpected visi- the Freer scene, in which a number of animals amble peace- fully in the hermitage's grassy forecourt. The imagery of the I594 Rdmdyazna version also differs from that of the Freer scene (fig. 31). The former illustration falls approximately one full text-page earlier in the narrative, and thus represents the women straggling into the shady hermitage, the golden spires of their drought-stricken city still visible in the distance. They have yet to commence their seduction, though the v.nad carried by one maiden leaves no doubt about their intentions. The object of their attention is shown seated, tonsured, and without his distinguishing horn. His hut is constructed of more permanent material than the bundled reeds and leaves of the dwellings of his counterparts. These differences in the narrative moment and iconographic detail are typical of the relationship among the three illustrated versions of the Rdmayana, and preclude a simple replication of imagery from one manuscript to an- other. The badly damaged ascription in the lower left corner of the margin has been deciphered as G6vardhana.5 Such a reading inevitably raises the alluring possibility that this painting and others attributed to G6vardhana in the Freer Rdmdyana are early efforts by the artist of the same name who went on to become one of the leading Mughal painters under Jahangir and Shah Jahan. Although exceptional calligra- phers and poets from 'Abd al-Rahim's entourage were occa- sionally taken into imperial service, this is not the case with Govardhana. His work in the Freer Rdmayana surpasses that of his colleagues, but does not begin to approach the level of accomplishment or distinctive style of his namesake's illus- trations in the 1596-97 Beatty Akbarnadma, with which they are exactly contemporary. tors.

Shastri I: 29 Text: Diagonal passages on the reverse of the folio; 211. below Title inscription on the reverse of the folio Published: Beach, The Imperial Image, I5c; Bhaktipada, p. 5 (fig. 32) Despite his exemplary behavior and judicious rule, the vir- tuous King Dasaratha is not blessed with a male heir. Upon hearing the ancient prophesy that a particular sacrifice officiated by Rsyasrnfiga will ensure the birth of four sons and thus remedy this condition, he sets out to ask permission of Lomapada to invite the sage to Ayodhya. Lomapada acqui- esces to this request, and gives the sage leave to accompany Dasaratha back to Ayodhya. The crowned Dasaratha enters from the left in an elab- orate chariot; Lomapada halts directly opposite his lord, and demonstrates his subservience by his more modest dress and gesture of supplication. This orientation is the reverse of the Jaipur version (no. 3), which makes no hierarchical distinc- tion between the two kings. G6vardhana accentuates the en- counter between the sovereigns by isolating their mounts against an open area framed below by a crowd of retainers, and by locating their respective entourages within the arch- ing forms of the pastel hillocks behind them. The violet walls and ochre battlements of the crowded city of Afga enclose a variety of buildings as well as a colorful tent and canopy. The shrines and blue-green trees dotting the distant hills are identical to those of folio 22a. Govardhana's distinctive style extends to many of the figures, who share a liveliness uncommon in the manuscript. This feature is particularly apparent in the animated poses and detail of the genre figures in the foreground. The stocky, bearded man by the portal and the youth to the left of the city's tower recall types commonly represented in miniatures of many contemporary imperial productions. This points up the minimal differences in style and quality between some of the earliest paintings produced for 'Abd al-Rahim and those of less ambitious manuscripts of the imperial workshop of the I590s. 94</page><page sequence="92">32.

Shastri I: 29 Text: Diagonal passages on the preceding folio; 2 11. below Published: Beach, The Imperial Image, I5d (fig. 33) This illustration departs from the Jaipur cycle to accord with the two lines of text below the painting, which suggest the subject of Santa in a travelling litter accompanying her hus- band Rsyasrnfiga to the city of Ayodhya. Three figures follow the one-horned sage, who rides a heavily garlanded white horse across a field divided into a pale green zone above a much darker one. A delicate, multicolored outcrop outlined in black dominates the upper register of the painting. Ayo- dhya lies to the left, nestled between bright green hills and below a sky whose gold and blue bands are separated by a wash of white clouds. The richness of the clouds and the sub- tlety of the trees make them indistinguishable from the land- scapes of contemporary paintings of the imperial atelier. The considerable shading around the profile of each of the six major figures, which recalls that around Rama on folio I4a, is the most distinctive feature of this work. The model- ing of the clothing is quite systematic and pronounced, par- ticularly in the unusual two bands running along the hem of the attendants' dhotis. The two figures fetching water and carrying wood in the foreground bespeak Govardhana's in- terest in genre scenes, as do the nearby pair of jackals in the lower left and the more prominent animal emerging from behind the ridge in the upper center. 33.

Although these prepara- tions include a flurry of almsgiving, sumptuous feasts, and scrupulously monitored preliminary sacrifices and rites - all visually interesting subjects - both theJaipur and Freer man- uscripts choose to illustrate the elaborately decorated pavil- ion that overlooks the sacrificial pit. The text passage above the image specifically mentions eight columns (rather than the eighteen of the Sanskrit version), which uncharacteristi- cally interrupt the figure of Dasaratha and obstruct the view of one of his counsellors. Ceremonial garlands hang between the columns, which are shown adorned with tiny paintings of figures, animals, and foliage as prescribed by the text. Curiously absent from this festive scene of sacrifice is the white horse itself. Rsyasriga and Santa are isolated to the right of the sacrificial fire, while the brahmans crowd in along the left. Like the figures in folio 2ob (fig. 32), most of the turbaned retainers are depicted conversing in pairs. The faces of both Dasaratha and Rsyasrnfiga are emphasized by slight contour shading. The costumes are generally less de- tailed than those of the earlier works by G6vardhana, perhaps as a result of the smaller scale of the more numerous figures, though their modeling is quite consistent with the former. Govardhana has incorporated the upper text panel into the front facade of the rectangular roof, but abandons this ac- commodation of the text column in the shorter podium below. The ribbed pattern of the red roof and of the two con- ical tents in the background repeat the form of the tent in folio 20ob. This detail is quite common in imperial painting of this time, but is rare in works further removed from the Mughal mainstream. 98</page><page sequence="96">I lA 34.

Shastri I: 4I Text: 3 11. above, 411. below Title inscription on f. 25b Published: Beach, The Imperial Image, I5f; Beach, The Adventures of Rama, p. I8; Bhaktipada, p. Io; Seyller, "A Sub-imperial Mughal Manuscript," fig. 4 (fig. 35) Dasaratha's sacrifice reaches the gods, who decide to use the occasion of the king's rightful reward of sons to quash the most serious threat to the order of the universe: the evil Ravana, lord of the demonic rdksasas, who was invulnerable to every class of being but mortals. At Brahma's request, Visnu agrees to become incarnated in the lowly form of a human being to fulfill this mission, and selects Dasaratha as his earthly sire. Hence, even before their conception, Dasaratha's four sons are dedicated to the subjugation of Ravana and the restoration of righteousness to the world. The imminent birth of Dasaratha's offspring is announced by a divine messenger rising from the sacrificial fire. Nadim's painting draws its imagery from the text and the two Jaipur illustrations. The upper panel of the Freer page describes the divine creature as a colossus with long hair and a beard, a fiery complexion, and a thunderous voice. Dressed in an animal skin secured by a blue girdle with gold ornaments, the huge orange figure spans the height of the page and extends an open golden bowl filled with celestial food in the direction of the horned Rsyasrniga, who gestures back toward the crowned Dasaratha. The queens, erro- neously numbering four rather than three, stand in awe as they wait to partake of the celestial food that will impregnate them. Kausalya, the mother of Rama, receives half the spe- cial rice, while Sumitra and Kaikeyi are allotted smaller por- tions respectively. Basavana's double-page composition in the Jaipur manuscript (nos. 6-7) formulates much of this core imagery, but includes several details which demonstrate both a greater fidelity to the textual narrative and a richer visual de- sign.6 The golden vessel offered by a gigantic messenger is covered, as the text specifies. Dasaratha and Rsyasrnga be- hold the wondrous spectacle from beneath the ornate canopy preserved from the earlier scene of sacrifice (no. 5); just out- side the canopied space stand Dasaratha's three wives as well as a host of brahmans and court retainers. In contrast to Nadim's innocuous solution of filling the sky with the spreading branches of a single tree, Basavana conjures up a pantheon of five gods to inhabit the sky, thereby reinforcing the notion of the divine sponsorship of Dasaratha's offspring. This second painting by Nadim interrupts the series of paintings associated with G6vardhana. Nadim uses some of the devices that make the former's work so successful, such as the contour shading and delicate modeling of the faces and the subtle progression of colors in the landscape. His later paintings in the manuscript suffer by comparison to this ini- tial work, thus paralleling the manuscript's general decline in quality. 35.

I2 (fig. 36) Brahmans, attendants, and women look on as Rsyasrnga and Santa bid farewell to their respective hosts. Rsyasrnga main- tains the horn, loose hair, and saffron-colored clothing of his earlier representations while Dasaratha shrinks in size and darkens in complexion. The prominence of the sage and king is emphasized both by their isolated, central position on the pale blue field and by the now-familiar contour shading of their faces. Other figures are relegated to more restricted compositional groupings. The four women watching Santa embrace another woman define the limits of an area marked by two bending trees and an ochre ground; the charioteer and groom to their left are ensconced within a tufted purple patch. Similarly, the dark green field unites the foreground scene of a woman addressing three palanquin bearers. Unlike miniatures later in the manuscript, the coloris- tic fragmentation of this composition does not detract from the landscape, whose complexity and forms resemble those of folio 2ob (fig. 32). Two mountain goats clamber among the multicolored lobes of the central outcrop. The artist articu- lates a similar rock formation in the lower right with a genre scene of two jackals, and adds interest to the tall, knotty tree in the upper right with a scene of nesting birds. Ayodhya, whose courtyard provides the setting of a dissimilar painting in the Jaipur manuscript (no. 8) illustrating a slightly earlier moment of this episode, is seen in the distance among blue- green trees and beneath a streaky blue sky. The many points of comparison to the paintings on fo- lios I9a, 2ob, and 22a suggest an attribution to G6vardhana, whose work dominates the beginning of the painting cycle of the Freer manuscript. 36.

This awkwardness is no less ap- parent in architectural ensemble. A deep blue hexagonal dais supports a pavilion topped by a curious purple kiosk. Two boxy buildings crowd in behind the compound's walls, which meet at disconcerting angles, an impression enhanced by irregular brickwork. The illustration is a faint echo of a similar scene by Ke- sava in the Jaipur manuscript (no. io), which, in addition to the action mentioned above, depicts almsgiving to crowds outside the walls of the court. 37.

Then one day the sage Visvamitra arrives at court to ask Dasaratha's permission to take Rama and Laksmana into the forest to de- stroy two rdksasas who are disrupting his sacrifices. At first the distraught Dasaratha pleads that his sons are too young and inexperienced to prevail against such fierce creatures, but he later acquiesces when Visvamitra firmly reminds him of his vow of service to him and of Rama's mission to defeat Ravana and his minions. Mohana's illustration follows the text passage above the painting by depicting Indra, Visnu, Brahma, and giva - all with iconographically correct attributes - strewing flowers from puspakas or floral thrones floating in a streaky blue sky. As Dasaratha puts his finger to his mouth in wonder at the celestial acclaim, Rama and Laksmana, bow and quiver slung over their shoulders, prepare to accompany their preceptor into the forest. The artist shows the limited extent of his familiarity with the subject by representing Rama without his canoni- cal dark complexion and Visvamitra as a beardless man wear- ing the unlikely combination of a turban and a dhoti; these iconographic mistakes do not appear in the corresponding Jaipur illustration (no. ii), which shows the trio striding across a field amid the din of trumpets and well-wishers. This miniature by M6hana lacks the careful draftsman- ship and subtle coloring of the works associated with Go- vardhana and the bold design of many subsequent paintings. The four main figures, who are named in accompanying la- bels, are as miniaturized as the eleven tiny onlookers in the tiled forecourt. Almost without exception, these impassive figures are marked by heavy brows and small, protruding noses. The courtyard is far more controlled in composition 1 . . . - -- -. .; . - . ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. t " I . i' , and detail than that of the previous illustration (f. 29a). M6- hana deftly incorporates the lower text panel into the fore- ground wall and shapes the angles of two diagonal walls to focus attention upon Dasaratha and his sons. The back wall recedes unobtrusively into the distance, as do the light city- scape and blue-green trees beyond. The appearance of a second cover sheet at this point in the manuscript suggests occasional changes in the position of the protective sheets. 38.

After a short journey, Rama, Laksmana, and Visvamitra stop to rest at a hermitage at the sacred confluence of the Sarayf and Ganges Rivers. There Visvamitra tells them the story of Kama, who was made bodiless after he angered Siva. Devo- tees of Siva occupying the hermitage pay homage to Visvamitra and his charges. The episode illustrated in this tranquil scene of discourse precedes that of the correspond- ing Jaipur illustration (no. I2), which depicts Visvamitra ex- plaining the roaring sound produced by the confluence of the rivers as the trio traverse the surging rivers in a crowded boat. Ghulam 'All encloses his nocturnal scene of the two youths conversing with Visvamitra and three holy men in a large green area bounded by a schematic representation of the confluence of the rivers. Two guards and shrines punctu- ate the mauve middleground, which culminates in a shrilly striped central outcrop. This interest in color patterns con- tinues in the large areas of pastel yellow and green to the left and right, as well as in the flat blue sky, whose stars are pre- scribed by the text. The overshadowing of the figures by the brilliance of the landscape is redressed to a certain extent by the unencumbered views of the principal characters and the slight contour shading around their faces. 39.

Shastri I: 60 Text: z I/2 11. above; 211. below Title inscription on f. 34b Sri Ramacand, Taraka raksasa labelled Published: Beach, The Imperial Image, I5h; Aditi, p. I84; Bhaktipada, pp. 24, 284 (details) (fig. 40) Visvamitra guides Rama toward the countryside terrorized by the evil Taraka and her rdksasa son Marica and directs him to slay the two demons, who have been defiling sacrifices and disrupting the social order. Because this is the first time that Rama will cause blood to be shed, Visvamitra instructs the prince that his duty to protect his people supersedes the in- junctions against such unseemly behavior. Mushfiq combines the subtlety of the forms and tones of the Rsyasriga illustrations (ff. I9a-27b) with a new bold- ness of scale and color in his first ascribed contribution to the manuscript. As is the case with the celestial messenger of folio 26a and later the demons of folio 38b, the pictorial bold- ness here owes much to both the monster's imposing size and its traditional orange coloring. Nevertheless, Mushfiq accen- tuates these elements by allowing the demoness to fill the area between the two text panels and by using heavily mod- eled blue and purple lower garments to provide the strongest color contrast. Rama takes aim at the hideous Taraka, whose name is written beside her pendulous breast, while Laksmana follows in his customary supporting role. The attack does not accord with the abbreviated last line of the upper panel, which re- counts Rama's speech to his brother, but is drawn instead from the Jaipur model (no. I3). The brothers display distinct facial types. Rama has a light brown complexion, no mus- tache, and a strong profile; Laksmana, presented in three- quarter view, is distinguished by a long, pointed nose and a weak chin. The landscape regains a measure of complexity, articu- lating successive zones of dark green, pastel green, and burnt sienna with light vegetation, colored ridges, and scattered rocks edged with leaves on one side. A multicolored Per- sianate mountain serves as a backdrop for Taraka, with one unit beneath the text panel flaring dramatically to the right. Deep wedges are cut into the bank of the brown hill across a river, and billowing clouds scud across the sky. Once again, a genre aside occupies the foreground, as a pair of roundish jackals watch aquatic fowl. 40.

Shastri I: 65 Text: Diagonal passages on the preceding folio; 3 11. below Title inscription on f. 36a Published: Beach, The Imperial Image, 15i; Bussagli, Indian Miniatures, fig. 46; Bhaktipada, pp. I6, 240 (de- tails); Seyller, "A Sub-imperial Mughal Manuscript," fig. 6 (fig. 41). Exultant at Taraka's death, the gods ask Visvamitra to grant Rama knowledge of the use of an assortment of divine weapons. The sage concurs and presents the special mantra- controlled weapons, which assume corporeal form and wor- ship Rama. Both the textual and visual accounts in the Freer ver- sion of this episode depart sufficiently from those of the Jaipur manuscript to controvert the notion of direct copying of either the text or the illustration even when the subjects coincide exactly. The text on folio 36b reduces the number of full lines of text from the usual twenty-one to fifteen, which are separated in turn by two bands of short, paired lines of text written at complementary diagonals. The substance of the carefully manipulated final line is essentially the same as that of the line of text immediately above the Jaipur illustra- tion (no. 14), with both relating the vow of the beings who preside over the weapons to be at Rama's service whenever he calls, but is expressed in remarkably different phrases. Similarly, the two illustrations share the same basic content and structure, but differ in the iconography of Visvamitra and the weapons. In the Freer painting, a tur- baned Visvamitra looks over the assortment of swords, dag- gers, and armor presented by Rama's bear and monkey allies, who have not yet been introduced in the story. The divine in- volvement in this investiture is conveyed by the four major deities (Visnu, Siva, Brahma, and Indra) watching from ahigh. In the Jaipur painting, the bare-headed sage stands between the two brothers and carries his customary water pot, while the magical weapons are properly personified as an array of crowned celestial beings. The dark green middleground focuses attention upon the figures, whose faces and drapery are unusually well drawn. Above the two broad zones of color is a landscape which recedes to a distance rarely encountered in the Freer manuscript. A low green hill with tall, even folds along the river gives rise to two white shrines and washy trees in alter- nating light and dark tones. This same technique of painting is repeated in the sky. 4I.

(irregular) Shastri I: 65-66 Text: 5 11. above; 211. below Visvamitra labelled Published: Bhaktipada, p. 28 (detail) (fig. 42) The designer of this manuscript forgoes the story of Visnu's incarnation as the dwarf Vamana, which appears in the Jaipur cycle (no. I5), and chooses to illustrate instead Rama's perplexed approach to the woods known as siddha asrama, an account related in the last line of text on the other side of the folio and the first two on this page. Rama, Visvamitra, and Laksmana proceed in single file across a grassy area which lies before a somber forest. Endowed with his usual dark com- plexion and crown, Rama looks up and back, and raises his hand to question Visvamitra. The turbaned sage, who is virtually identical in countenance and costume to the figure behind Rsyasrnfiga on folio 22a (fig. 33), gestures in reply. Contour shading again sets off his thick-set profile and jaw from the pale blue ridge behind. Both Visvamitra and Laksmana also show the same distinctive modeling of drap- ery and bands along the bottom of their dhotis seen in folio 22a. The similarities in the landscape of this and the previ- ous painting offer firm evidence for an attribution of both works to G6vardhana. The washed blue sky above the dark and varied trees recalls the atmospheric effects of folios i9a and 37a. So too does the deep purple area below the shrine re- peat the folds of the river bank of folio 37b. Moreover, the strong contour outlines of the central ridge and ochre mound in the distance resemble those of folios 27b and 37a. 42.

Shastri I: 68 Text: i line above Marica div, siydh (black) div labelled Published: Jain-Neubauer, fig. 5I; Beach, The Imperial Image, 15j; Bhaktipada, p. I75; Seyller, "A Sub-imperial Mughal Manuscript," fig. 7 (fig. 43). Rama's apprehension at the siddha asrama is well justified, for in this region lurk two loathsome demons who delight in desecrating the rites of brahmans. When the two finally appear, Rama selects the Manava weapon from his newly acquired arsenal and strikes down Marica, who is knocked senseless into the sea a hundred leagues away. Thereupon Rama advances to shoot a deadly magical arrow at the mon- strous Subahu. The action of Laksmana watching Rama at- tack a foe is quite mundane in itself and nearly mirrors that of folio 35b. The figures, too, are unremarkable: a dark- skinned Rama dressed in a fluttering dupatta and widespread yellow dhoti is accompanied by his slighter, pale sibling. Even the rotund Subahu, Rama's immediate adversary, be- longs to a familiar Persian strain of divs, spotted orange crea- tures with horns, fangs, and fan-shaped ears. But it is the figure of the fallen Marica, with his long green limbs stretch- ing across a sea of bright red blood, that makes this painting the best demonstration of the artistic possibilities of the subimperial combination of glorious color and careful drafts- manship. This striking color accent is juxtaposed with a dark green middleground of equal size. The landscape takes an unexpected turn when the artist introduces a subtle blue rise with regular, cloudlike mounds below a series of delicately shaded trees. The disparity between the flat zones of color and the atmospheric vista of orthodox Mughal painting seems quite related to Mushfiq's work on folio 35b (fig. 40), and is difficult to reconcile with the two other works as- cribed, albeit less securely, to M6hana, whose name appears clearly here in the lower margin. As most ascriptions in the lower margins of the manuscript are supported on stylistic grounds, the most probable explanation for this unexpected masterpiece is that the brilliance of the design of this paint- ing obscures the range in quality that occurs in every artist's work in the manuscript. The existence of similar qualitative discrepancies in works ascribed and attributed to Nadim and Syama Sundara suggests that this natural variation in qual- ity is also apparent here. 43.

Shastri I: 72 Text: i line above; 3 11. below Title inscription in the inner margin (fig. 44) Visvamitra continues the education of Rama and Laksmana with stories which are both instructive and entertaining. By way of tracing his own lineage, he relates the tale of the il- lustrious King Kusanabha, who has a hundred beautiful daughters. One day the wind god, Vayu, catches sight of the maidens, and beseeches them to surrender themselves to him. When the virgins spurn his amorous entreaties, Vayu wreaks revenge by making their limbs deformed and their minds addled. Rarely do the Freer illustrations surpass their Jaipur counterparts in imagination, but this is surely the case here. Whereas the Jaipur scene (no. I7) depicts the daughters ex- plaining to Kusanabha the result of their righteous conduct, this miniature conveys a sense of the invisible scourge by rep- resenting fourteen women twisting in consternation (fig. 45). The daughters show no trace of physical deformity, but two maidens lie senseless beneath the lower text panel. The im- ages fall at approximately the same point in the narrative, though once again the Persian text for this episode is significantly different in the two manuscripts. Four trees rise from the long, hooked lobes of the cen- tral hill to break up the rich blue sky. A dark green zone with rough yellow sheaves comprises the foreground. The pale green mound immediately behind the round-headed women emphasizes the large scale of the figures. At this distance, the costume details of tassels, round gold earrings, and heavily linearpa.takd folds are quite prominent. 45. The hundred daughters of Kusanabha tell their father of Vayu's torment.

Shastri I: 85-86 Text: Diagonal passages on the preceding folio; i line above Published: Bussagli, Indian Miniatures, fig. 49 (fig. 46) Visvamitra now turns to Rama's own ancestry, and tells him the story of a distant relative, King Sagara. After the white horse that has been readied for Sagara's sacrifice is stolen, Sagara orders his sons, who number 8,ooo in the Persian text, to retrieve it. The youths search the four quarters of the earth and dig to its very foundations. There at last the youths find the horse grazing near Vasudeva (Visnu), who has assumed the guise of the ascetic Kapila. When they accuse him of theft and threaten him, the deity utters a single sound and re- duces the brash youths to dust. Like the color-charged landscapes of folios 34a and 38b, this illustration enlists unusual forms and colors to drama- tize the action. Seated before a cave faced with luminous blue-purple rocks, Kapila, shown with the beard, matted hair, and orange loincloth of an ascetic, points down and in- tones the destruction of the enraged men. A bizarre rock cluster with intersecting oval units edged in purple directs further attention to the sage. Similarly animated outcrops and trees ring the arched grey field on which the white horse is isolated. In the foreground, these dynamic forms are com- bined with a stump whose spreading roots curl around deco- ratively. Among the twelve sons depicted in this illustration, the two in the center are distinctive for their pronounced brows and pointed eyes. The appearance of similar figures and natural forms in paintings ascribed to Fazl, notably folios 94b, 223a, and 25Ia, points unmistakably to Fazl's hand. Perhaps the most prolific artist and certainly the most remarkable in the atelier of'Abd al-Rahim, Faizl dominates a later section of the painting cycle of this manuscript. 46.

Shastri I: I02 Text: I I/411. above; 3 11. below Title inscription on f. 49a and on the cover sheet (fig. 47) Visvamitra, Rama, and Laksmana come upon a beautiful but curiously uninhabited hermitage, whose predicament Rama is fated to redress. Visvamitra explains that Indra, a deity in- clined to bawdy behavior, once tried to seduce Ahalya by assuming the appearance of her husband, the sage Gautama. Ahalya recognizes the deception, but submits to the god nonetheless. When Gautama discovers the infidelity, he curses both Indra and Ahalya, depriving the former of his virility and condemning the latter to remain immobile and invisible to all beings until Rama arrives to liberate her. This scene of Ahalya's release from her accursed exis- tence marks the beginning of a series of illustrations which diverges from the Jaipur cycle. As is usually the case when there is no pictorial model, the painting follows exactly the content of the abbreviated lines of the upper text panel, which describe Ahalya falling at the feet of Rama, who raises up the unfortunate woman from her position of supplication. All the figures are rendered in a diminutive scale, and are dwarfed by the large domed building of the hermitage be- hind them. The composition displays the familiar progression of a dark green foreground to a larger and paler middleground. The plainness of both zones is relieved by the presence of a number of animals, including a rabbit and a superb nilgae, as well as by a variety of trees. While normal work practices point to paintings on both sides of a folio being allocated to a single artist, the subtle modeling of both the figures and animals seems well beyond the ability and inclination of Syama Sundara, whose name is supplied for the painting on the reverse. Rather, it displays a strong affinity with G6- vardhana's illustration on folio iga (fig. 29), and appears to be that master's final painting in the manuscript. 47.

Shastri I: I03 Text: 5 11. above; i line below Title inscription on f. 49a and on the cover sheet Published: Bhaktipada, p. 3I (fig. 48) Having arranged the reconciliation of Ahalya and Gautama, Rama and his companions set out toward the city of Mithila, the domain of King Janaka. There they catch sight of a great sacrifice in progress, and retire to a discreet vantage point to behold the spectacle. The artist offers a literal illustration of the lines imme- diately above and below the image, in which Rama remarks upon the multitude of brahmans from many different lands assembled with their carts. With the omission of the three travellers, however, pride of place is given to the crowned figure of Janaka, who sits to the left of the sacrificial pit be- fore which food, vessels, and books are arrayed. gyama's first ascribed painting in the manuscript au- gurs ill for the central section of the painting cycle, which he clearly dominates. Two schematic purple and blue ridges in the foreground form the first of three distinct registers. Lit- tle visual interest is added by either the plain courtyard, the throne perched precariously on the blue-carpeted dais, or the pale green area overlaid with repetitive sheaves of grass. The ungainliness of the small men is matched only by the rudi- mentary modeling of their brahmanical robes. The overall decline in quality is made all the more obvious by compari- son to G6vardhana's composition on folio 24a. The strong similarity of the colors, architecture, and modeling in this work to those of folio 29a (fig. 37) supports the attribution of the earlier painting to Syama Sundara. As was the case with G6vardhana, the coincidence of the name of an imperial artist with that of another who con- tributed many paintings to the Freer Ramayana makes it tempting to cast Syama Sundara (?yama the beautiful) as one of several artists who moved from imperial atelier to 'Abd al- Rahim's workshop.7 Moreover, the approximately ten-year difference between the respective periods of activity would easily allow for the degradation that we see in the two bodies of work. Although it is difficult to imagine that different cir- cumstances of patronage could occasion such a precipitous decline in an artist's ability to generate even simple formula- tions of architecture and landscape elements, it appears that Syama responded to his change of fortune in exactly this manner. 48.

Shastri I: 107-08 Text: Diagonal passages on the preceding folio; 3 11. below Title inscription in the inner margin and on f. 5ib Vasistha-ji, Visvamitra, cow of wealth labelled Published: Bhaktipada, p. 33 (fig. 49) Rama learns of an ill-considered course of action which brought ruin upon Visvamitra, who was a once powerful king, and led him to perform a series of austerities which eventually made him a most exalted sage. Upon receiving Visvamitra at his hermitage, Vasistha graciously offers to en- tertain the king and all his troops. Vasistha's generosity is not beyond his means, for he owns a cow by the name of Sabala which can produce anything one desires. The prospect of possessing a source of such limitless bounty arouses Visvamitra's greed, and he seeks to seize control of the mirac- ulous cow first by argument and finally by force. The subtlety of this narrative structure is lost on the artist, who conflates the episodes and shows Visvamitra as a sage in the company of Rama and Laksmana. Uncertain about the status of the two princes, Fazl effaced their golden crowns and replaced them with turbans. All three travellers converse with Vasistha, who sits awkwardly on the threshold of a hermitage with a topheavy and off-center superstructure. A cowherd stares vacantly from his position between his master and his spotted bovine charge. Fazl renders most forms as two-dimensional shapes filled in with unmodulated color. This tendency is especially apparent in the cowherd's flat purple cloak, to which the artist adds a completely linear system of folds to provide a modicum of volume. His figures, too, show the same mini- mal attention to modeling, both in their simple profile or naive full-face view and in their stiff clothing. The landscape is comprised of three distinct zones, beginning in the fore- ground with a horizontal band of green punctuated by a team of horses and a pink ridge. An ochre area capped by a very schematic ridge extends most of the height of the composi- tion, and is linked to the blue-grey sky by a tree marked by the same planar quality as the figures. 122</page><page sequence="120">Ramayana, Freer Gallery of Art, f. 52a.. - - - -.; * 123</page><page sequence="121">53b The forces of Visvamitra and those raised by Vasistha's voli- tion battle for possession of the cow Sabala Artist: Ghulam 'Ali (ascribed on the cover sheet of f. 87a) 24 x 15 cm. Shastri I: iii Text: Diagonal passages on the reverse of the folio; I I/3 11. above; 211. below Title inscription on f. 52b and on the original cover sheet (now between ff. 86-87) (fig. 50) The battle over the magical cow is joined, and wave upon wave of supernatural warriors produced by Sabala crashes down upon the mighty Visvamitra and his troops. Finally, Vasistha brings to bear all the power accumulated from years of austerities and utters a sound which annihilates all but Visvamitra, who retires in disgrace. This struggle of spiritual titans is presented as an ordi- nary scene of battle; no special weapons are depicted nor are the two protagonists identified. The two mounted kings join a vertical row of horsemen on the left and bystanders peeking over the horizon to watch the battle transpire between two foot-soldiers and as many pairs of horsemen. To this type of composition, which is derived from a long-standing tradi- tion of such scenes in Persian painting, the artist adds slen- der, almost attenuated figures of mid-sixteenth-century ori- gin. The landscape reduction is also consistent with the subimperial style, being reduced to three simple bands of green, beige, and pale blue. Hence, nothing in the composi- tion or rendering even remotely suggests that the artist once worked in the imperial atelier. Yet 'Abd al-Rahim's painter had precisely this profes- sional background, as a comparison of the figures in a paint- ing ascribed to this artist, Ghulam 'All, in the Jaipur Rdmayana itself makes clear (fig. 5i). The combination of taut features, a short mustache, and heavily outlined eyes of most of the witnesses to Rama's dramatic archery demonstration in the Jaipur manuscript reappears throughout the Freer scene, most notably in the mounted king to the left and the print of the hand of Kesava, the artist who certainly supplied these two figures in addition to designing the composition. The attribution of the Freer painting to Ghulam 'All is reinforced by fragments of an ascription in the lower margin, and the appearance of the artist's name on the misplaced cover sheet of folio 87a along with the title inscription of this battle scene.8 Thus Ghulam 'All, who was a member of the imperial workshop as early as the period of the production of the Cleveland ..Tti-nadma and who continued in this capacity throughout the IS80s, emerges as the seniormost imperial painter to join the Khankhinan's employ.9 Other aspects of the painting reveal the vagaries of the manuscript's finishing details. The arm of the lowermost horseman extends outside the original gold ruling of the text column and is subsequently left unpainted. The truncated figures in the upper and outer areas indicate that the paint- ing has been trimmed, but it is clear that no ruling was ever applied below. fighting figure immediately before him.

Shastri i: II8 Text: Diagonal passages on the preceding folio; 1/2 line above; 211. below Title inscription in the lower right corner of the paint- ing (fig. 52) Visvamitra retreats to the forest to practice asceticism, whose merit earns him knowledge of an even more potent array of celestial weapons. Emboldened by the newly acquired weapons, Visvamitra assails Vasistha once again, only to be thwarted by Vasistha's superior spiritual power. Visvamitra yields again, and returns to his austerities for a thousand years, but eventually succumbs to yet another opportunity to act on his antipathy toward Vasistha. This is the desire of King Trisafiku to enter heaven in bodily form, an audacious ambition rejected first by Vasistha and then by his 100 sons. Indeed, so enraged are the latter that they transform Trisanfiku into an outcaste canddla. In this accursed state, Trisafiku begs for help from Visvamitra, who agrees to pre- side over the sacrifice that will grant the disgraced king his wish. This painting illustrates Visvamitra's disciples return- ing to inform the sage of the refusal of only Mahodaya and Vasistha's sons to participate in the sacrifice for Trisanku. Following both the Jaipur miniature (no. 27) and the text, the artist shows two brahmans in a hexagonal pavilion con- versing with the white-haired Visvamitra, who holds a scroll covered with pseudo-writing. To their right is Trisafiku, identified by his crown and black complexion and accentu- ated by his heavily modeled dark blue clothes. Twelve rsis or sages gather near the sacrificial fire with vessels, food, and books. They exhibit a range of facial types unrivalled by most paintings earlier in the manuscript. Common to all the figures is a distinctive rendering of the finely textured hair, which forms a bun in the back and defines the ear. The tight facial features and long eyes create a directed expression. Together with a deep blue sky and a curious predilec- tion for dark complexions, only some of which are called for by the text, these elements may be associated with Nadim, an artist whose work first appears on folio 26a. This painting belongs to a group of four of his works extending through folio 6oa. A title inscription written over the lower right cor- ner of the painting reads: "There must be (bdyad) the sacrifice of Raja Trisafiku." 52.

Finally, the king comes upon a poor brahman, and insists ... ll. that he accept the prize in exchange for one of his sons. i Sunahsepha, the second of three sons, volunteers to die so i " that his parents might be spared the grief of losing their el- dest or youngest child. The youth's courage soon fails him, however, and he beseeches Visvamitra to save his life. . ^^ The Jaipur version (no. 29) of this episode shows the youth taking refuge in Visvamitra even as the king's en- i ... ' tourage traverses a landscape on the return to Ayodhyi for the sacrifice. Although the Freer painting falls at approxi- mately the same point in the text, which differs significantly r _.&lt; ;, 7 ; in the two manuscripts, it depicts Ambarisa before the en- / ,,. ^ throned Indra, whose body bears its usual markings of a . thousand eyes. Five rsis in the surrounding courtyard raise their hands in wonder as Visvamitra approaches the pyre to i_i bind gunah. sepha with a sacred cord. The youth awaits at the sacrificial post, having learned two prayers from Visvamitra which will win him the favor of the gods and freedom. De- spite the unmistakable identity of the protagonists, all four principal characters are labelled in the painting. Nadim demonstrates his interest in complexions by de- picting a black-skinned gunahsiepha, a complexion which belies the youth's brahmanical parentage. Two of the brah- mans watching the spectacle also appear dust-colored. The rendering of the facial features and hair follows the artist's earlier work, but the drapery, modeled with both strong lines and subtle, varied tones, asserts new prominence here. 54.

The varied landscape and convincing figural interaction of the painting remain close to the imperial Mughal idiom. The yellowish patches lend pal- pable texture to the dark green foreground, and the treat- ment of the violet rocky ground behind the cand.las shows real understanding of the original Persian conventions.

Shastri I: I24-26 Text: ii lines above Visvamitra, Brahma-ji, Visnu-ji, Mahesa-ji, Indra-ji labelled Title inscription in the upper margin Published: Bhaktipada, p. 40 (fig. 56) Visvamitra continues to practice the most severe austerities so that he might move ever higher in the spiritual hierarchy of rsis. Occasionally he falters and squanders the benefits of his austerities in a fit of anger or lust. The Jaipur manuscript devotes an illustration (no. 3I) to the brief tale of one of these lapses, when Visvamitra yields to the charms of the nymph Menaka. The Freer manuscript omits the description and hence the illustration of this indiscretion in favor of a second and more direct challenge to the sage's ascetic power. The gods hope to provoke Visvamitra into a debilitating out- burst by addressing him as rajarsis (literally, king of the sages), the lowest level of spiritual achievement a sage might reach, and a status considerably below that which Visvami- tra desires. Though the Freer text mentions Brahma alone, Nadim depicts all four major gods addressing Visvamitra. He clearly draws the idea of a group scene from the Jaipur illustration (no. 33), in which twelve iconographically indistinguishable gods join Brahma on earth in finally granting the sage the much more exalted title of brahmdrsis. By contrast, Nadim's gods are identified both by inscription and by such attributes as Siva's crescent moon and serpent and Indra's thousand eyes. Despite this iconographic precision, the painting falls considerably short of Nadim's earlier efforts. Nadim's interest in hair and modeling is no longer ap- parent in these figures. Visvamitra, for example, maintains his white hair, but shows no hint of emotion at the gods' cal- culated slight. Similarly, thin gold lines are used to model the brown dhotis and dupattas. The flat green ground merely accentuates the geometric boundaries of the foreground tank; the tall shrine culminates in a superstructure which is more peculiar than interesting. Indeed, the only truly attrac- . ! t\ *v w / ^' * t;.' J e - ,' '., '~,~',. ,,~J~v~~ ~~; ;~,&gt;~ tive feature of the painting is the combination of the tree and outcrop in the upper right with the rich blue sky. 56.

Shastri I: I27-28 Text: 8 I/411. above Visvamitra, Rambha apsaras labelled Title inscription in the upper margin Published: Ettinghausen, Paintings of the Sultans and Emperors of India, pl. 3; Beach, The Imperial Image i5k; Bhaktipada, p. 38 (fig. 57) After the gods test Visvamitra's temper with their demean- ing form of address, they return to proven means to make the sage dissipate the merits of his austerities. Indra, who as- sumes the form of a songbird, coerces Rambha, the most beautiful of the celestial maidens (apsarasas), into approach- ing Visvamitra with the hope of distracting him once more. Mindful of his earlier seduction by Menaki, Visvamitra ve- hemently condemns the unfortunate Rambha to become a pillar of stone. Too late Visvamitra realizes that his assidu- ously cultivated self-control is shattered as easily by a bout of anger as by one of lust, and is forced to begin yet another round of austerities in his Sisyphean quest for ultimate spir- itual power. The bearded Visvamitra prays in the middle of a ring of fire, his bent legs bound by a cord used in ascetic practices. A golden vessel and a scroll with unintelligible Devanagari characters and numbers lie before him on a circular patch of purple ground, whose distinction in color from the sur- rounding verdant landscape surely implies the sage's aura. Rambha initiates contact with the sage by her glance and gesture. This scenario differs considerably from that of the Jaipur miniature (no. 32), in which Visvamitra is drawn by the music of the cuckoo and the vi.d-playing Rambha.I? As in the Jaipur scene, the disguised Indra perches on a nearby flowering tree, but here he is joined by six brightly colored birds. A row of pastel rocks passes between the narrow stream in the foreground and a very naturalistic plantain tree. The deep green area above Visvamitra's head stops short of the text panel, which does not contain the final phrase of Rambha adorning herself. The text itself deviates significantly from the Jaipur version, and the image appears in the narrative before the actual temptation is related in the text. The faces of the two figures are highly accomplished in both modeling and texture. The detail and variety of the plants lend a sensual mood to the strongly colored landscape. The fortuitous combination of atmosphere and color seen in this painting, one of two works in the manuscript ascribed to Mushfiq, marks a high point in the subimperial style. A short inscription written over the rocks in the lower right corner of the painting reads: be amr do szirat, literally, "At the order: two paintings." I have construed a nearly iden- tical phrase on another Mughal manuscript as a prescriptive scribal order for a double-page composition." There is a loss of an illustrated folio at this point in the manuscript, as was noted in Chapter 3, but the gap occurs between folios 6I and 62. Since the missing image would follow this one on folio 6ia by at least a page of text, this painting of Rambha ap- proaching Visvamitra would not normally be counted as part of any pair of images unless the author was referring strictly to the story itself. Thus the easily overlooked inscription re- mains somewhat enigmatic in meaning, but it seems to be part of an ongoing assessment of the physical integrity of the manuscript. 57.

Rama easily lifts the bow and plucks its bowstring. Then, with Visvamitra's permission, he takes hold of the bow a second time, grasping it with such force that it breaks in two. A cataclysmic sound issues and knocks the crowd of observers senseless. When Janaka and his sub- jects recover, they look upon the handsome youth with new reverence, and begin to-make preparations for his marriage to Sita. Squeezed between the two large panels of text, a dust- colored Rama stands over the chest in which the treasured bow was stored. He draws back the string of the great bow, an action which coincides exactly with the narrative devel- opment of the abbreviated last line of the upper text panel. Janaka raises his hand in astonishment at the ease with which Rama passed the test for his daughter's hand. A handful of onlookers, who include a monkey king and an elderly figure identifiable as Visvamitra, are silhouetted against the dark green courtyard. The large areas of flat color in the courtyard and dado, the pale complexions of the figures, and the curious, fussy treatment of their drapery relate this work to the addorsed painting, though obviously neither painting compares well with Nadim's best work. One response to this stylistic in- consistency is to doubt the cover sheet ascription, whose ad- ditive nature automatically makes it suspect. However, the validity of almost all these ascriptions is affirmed either by stylistic evidence or by duplicate ascriptions on the paintings or in their margins. Another explanation for the low achieve- ment of these last three paintings by Nadim may lie in the disrupted production of the manuscript, a development sug- gested by the manuscript's extended time of production and its marked shifts in style. 59- Ramaya.na, Freer Gallery of Art, f. 62b. 135</page><page sequence="133">? ~ ' ',' "~~-_ P .&lt; t ....

Relating again to an abbreviated text entirely different i from that of the Jaipur manuscript, this painting, the eighth ... ' ,'i/ in five folios, continues the heavy rate of illustration in this _ H/. E section of the Freer Rdmdyana. Whereas the Jaipur scene (no. _ , 37) represents Janaka and Dasaratha embracing without ref- erence to Mithila, this work illustrates a less intimate greet- " ~ ' : ing outside the capital of Videha. Neither inscription nor at- * ' tribute identifies the two elderly kings, who approach on \: - horseback and chariot. Only the location of Mithila in the upper left suggests that Janaka is the mounted figure on the left. A number of stocky retainers with swarthy complexions mill about the expansive landscape. Like the bearded kings, . the two figures immediately below the upper text panel are endowed with the contour shading so prominent early in the ,,,~U^..,, painting cycle. The landscape itself is reminiscent of Nadim's work on folio 59b. The dark green foreground, once again animated by genre activity in the ubiquitous stream, gives rise to over- lapping layers of pale green, yellow, violet, and pink. These areas show the same light touches of vegetal and rocky tex- ture as well as the fine contour lines. Three large trees fill most of the dark blue sky, which extends to the very edge of the folio. 6i.

' Shastri I: I44-45 ; Text: 911. above ' ' j.'IB : ., Title inscription in the upper margin Published: Bhaktipada, p. 50 (fig. 63) The wedding ceremony proper begins at last. One by one, . :t- , g, J ; each of Dasaratha's sons takes the hand of his betrothed and ' begins to circumambulate the sacrificial fire in accordance 4 with Hindu custom, as the Persian text of the Freer manu- !_ script carefully explains. The gods rain flowers down upon '. the newlyweds and the sound of drums fills the air. [ The marriage rites are witnessed by eight brahmans arrayed in a semi-circle and four women seated in the bal- ' . :,. conies above. Conspicuously absent are the two kings and ' 'tT;\' . Vasistha, who presides over the ceremony. The large text |^ ''_ panel and sheer number of figures in the composition neces- ? . . sitate some reduction in the scale of the figures, but the tini- ness of the four new couples must also be an indication of their youth. The artist Kala Pahara deviates from established ! .. custom in the manuscript by garbing Rama and his brothers in the four-pointed Mughal jma. He also uses gold to high- light the folds of dark clothing. The faces of most of the figures are badly abraded. The focus of the activity is the very modestly sized sacrificial fire burning beneath a rectangular trellis festooned _ with garlands. Jars and gold vessels are scattered in the fore- ground of the grassy courtyard. Two painted elephants adorn the spandrel of the doorway to the left of the central wall. The composition of the painting departs dramatically from the corresponding scene in the Jaipur Rdmdyana (no. 39). Tulasi Kalan forgoes the representation of the rite of cir- cumambulation, but omits no detail of the textual descrip- tion of the wedding's conclusion: the couples are shown em- bedded in the crowd of brahmans, women, and musicians beneath and around a large canopy, Dasaratha is accorded a prominent position, and the gods are invited to pay homage from above. 63.

Shastri I: I46-47 Text: 8 I/2 11. above Title inscription in the upper margin Published: Bhaktipada, p. 54 (fig. 64) Upon the conclusion of the marriage rites, Visvamitra retires to the Himalayas to resume his austerities, and Vasistha accompanies Dasaratha and his sons back to Ayodhya. Along the road, Dasaratha notes with alarm the darkening sky, the screeching of birds, and the flight of animals. He turns in his chariot to ask the sage the reason for the inauspicious turmoil. Kala Pahara does not distinguish the two crowned figures by attribute, but by analogy to the corresponding Jaipur miniature (no. 40), we may surmise that Vasistha oc- cupies the second chariot. The paintings in the two manu- scripts follow somewhat different textual accounts of the ill omens, but their compositions are similar even to the point of the inclusion of a horseman passing between ridges in the foreground. Despite the miniaturized scale of the Freer figures, which also occurs in the addorsed painting, the num- bers of the king's entourage are reduced from the Jaipur crowds to only three figures here. Along with the curious absence of birds, which appear in virtually every other land- scape in the manuscript, is a golden sun in a sky whose bril- liance dispels any sense of danger. Only the foxes scampering among the jagged units of the purple ridges in the fore- ground provide a sign of the anxiety of the natural world. 64. Ra-mayana, Freer Gallery of Art, f. 66b. 140 .*.

An enraged Rama seizes the bow and immediately draws it. He spares Parasurama's life because he is related to Visvamitra, but compels the insolent sage to return to the mountain retreat where he will cause no further disturbance. i As Rama releases the arrow the world returns to normal and the gods acclaim the young hero once more. 1 In the twoJaipur illustrations of this event (nos. 42-43), whose text is again clearly different from that of the Freer 1 version, a radiant Parasurama appears like lightning before the travelers, and then a host of gods and men behold Rama loosing a fiery arrow from Parasurama's bow (fig. 5i). If Ghulam 'Ali brought any memory of this composition with him to 'Abd al-Rahim's project, he certainly did not convey it to Fazl, who was assigned this scene in the Freer manu- . script.

Reduction of . -. -.^ a scene of confrontation to a diagrammatic pair of figures characterizes many of Fazl's illustrations that occur later in the Freer manuscript.

Because this scene has no counterpart in the Jaipur B ;' cycle, its imagery is determined directly by the text in the . . upper panel, which specifies Bharata's dramatic gesture of filial duty, the women's floral adornment, and the musical acclaim. The artist chooses a standard courtyard composition in which these three actions are easily accommodated as dis- crete scenes. He fleshes out this simple structure with unam- ' bitious, even blatant details which indicate his remoteness from the imperial Mughal style. The tasseled women have p'',,i,,:r.;,, -,v,., ungainly facial types and crudely blackened hair. Equally pe- -_O_;^, . : . culiar are the gold highlights on Kaikeyi's skirt and the strong colors of the purple and burnt-sienna walls.

Although the figures dwarf those of folio 32b (fig. 38), they clearly issue from the same hand, and support the validity of the ascription on the cover sheet.

Shastri I: I66 Text: 411. below Title inscription on f. 7ib Raja Dasaratha, Sri Rama-ji labelled Published: Bhaktipada, p. 58 (fig. 68) Dasaratha decides that the time has come to yield the throne to Rama, a decision met with universal approval. The king orders the palace readied for the coronation ceremonies, and summons Rama to inform him of his imminent investiture. As Rama approaches the throne, Dasaratha is overcome with delight at the very sight of his illustrious son, like one who is pleased by his own reflection in a mirror. He offers some final advice to the prince, requests that he undertake an evening of fast, and proclaims that Rama will be installed as king the next day. While M6hana's effort may have slackened under the general decline of the central portion of the manuscript, the tentativeness of this first work by Qasim is probably born of simple inexperience. A youthful Dasaratha endowed with a broad face and wispy beard averts his gaze from his obedient, fair-skinned son perched on the side of a throneless pavilion. Rama and three attendants in the dull green courtyard dis- play crudely painted hair and mustaches as well as decidedly drowsy expressions. Nothing could be further from the poignancy and pageantry of theJaipur painting (no. 44) than this dry and formulaic illustration.12 Qasim's colors are harsh, his transitions abrupt. For ex- ample, the end of the king's blue dupatta changes to gold when it passes behind one of the columns. The same blue then marks the pavilion's platform and base, contrasting sharply with the orange-red dado and the pink column bases and pavilion steps. Though the background wall and build- ings are unexceptional, the gateway pillars and cusped niches in the foreground give some indication of the artist's poten- tial. Qasim celebrates his accomplishment by signing his 68.

Shastri I: I86-87 Text: 8 11. above Title inscription on f. 75b and on the cover sheet Published: Beach, The Adventures of Rama, p. 3I; Bhak- tipada, p. 72 (fig. 69) The announcement of Rama's investiture stirs deep springs of maliciousness in Manthara, Kaikeyi's hunchback maid, whose physical deformity is seen to match her perverse char- acter. Manthara spreads poisonous thoughts to her mistress, whispering conspiratorially that her son Bharata will be eter- nally eclipsed by Rama, and that he will ultimately be forced into exile or be murdered. Kaikeyi's pure mind is fouled by these machinations, and she succumbs to the hunchback's recommendation of a spiteful course of action. This is to in- voke the privilege of two boons which Dasaratha granted to her long ago when she saved his life. With these, she is to de- mand that Bharata be installed as ruler instead of Rama, and that Rama be sent into exile for fourteen years. Kaikeyl seizes upon this insidious design and begins to wail in distress. Alarmed at the sight of his queen's disconsolate condition, Dasaratha promises to right whatever afflicts her. Her snare now drawn tight, Kaikeyi reminds the king of his former oath and then utters the wishes that the king is duty-bound to abide. After a moment, Dasaratha realizes the calamity be- falling him and swoons in despair. This concentrated action lends itself well to the incli- nation of 'Abd al-Rahim's painters to limit the number of figures and details of setting to a minimum. A single female attendant lifting a cloth to her face represents the dismay of the smattering of court women and the crowd of men in the' Jaipur version of Dasaratha's swoon (no. 46). The grief of Kaikeyl and Dasaratha is similarly understated: the queen's hair shows no sign of dishevelment, and the crown of the stunned Dasaratha remains securely in place. Kala Pahara's arrangement and detailing of the ubiqui- tous pavilion are quite fresh. The thin pink column and tiled roof of the pavilion are cleverly contiguous with the edges of the text panel. The two duck-headed vessels in the niche be- 14 j 1#.// '1kJ1 h I hind Kaikeyi echo the decorative interest seen in the ele- phant spandrels of folio 66a (fig. 63). The artist repeats the linear treatment of the veins of the plantain leaves of the same folio and articulates the light green ground with long, feath- ery tufts used again in folio Io0a. The rich blue of the sky and brown of the platform also reappear in the latter painting. 69. Ramayana, Freer Gallery of Art, f. 76a. 145</page><page sequence="143">X..-.. --- .. ' ..... . ..........'

A 1 stricken Dasaratha sits hunched over beside his treacherous queen in a porch whose two grey openings accentuate the figures. While Rama raises his hands in veneration, Laksmana lifts but a finger in surprise. - The somewhat more careful rendering of the figures may be a simple matter of emphasis; the brothers approxi- mate the figures of Rama and Laksmana on folio 85b, a paint- ing ascribed to gyama, but the numerous retainers in the lat- ter painting are considerably rougher in execution. More coherent than the architecture of the previous painting, the setting here consists of a violet columned porch, a screened building set obliquely to the left, and a dark brown wall in the foreground. The first and last of these structures incor- porate the text panel into their design.

The queen shudders at the thought of cruel separation from her child and at the hard- ships that Raima will endure. She tries to dissuade Rama from heeding Da'saratha's order, claiming that he is equally bound to revere her wishes. By contrast, Laksmania grows belliger- ent and directs his wrath at Kaikeyi, whom he holds person- ally responsible for the great injustice. Raima does his best to console both, gently reminding his broken-hearted mother that obedience to a father's command is the highest virtue, and instructing his brother that this exile is his own karma or fate, which no one is able to escape. This small illustration of Laksmania protesting Rama's acquiescence to exile falls at another interstice in the Jaipur cycle, which in a total of six paintings illustrates Raima's leave-taking of Kausalyai (nos. 05) Sitai and Laksmana pleading to accompany Rama (nos.- 52, 54), and then distrib- uting their possessions in preparation for departure (nos. 53, 55) Although the line of text above this image describes Laksmana beating his head against the ground and chafing his hands, Syama depicts an unvexed, almost debonair Laksmania conversing amiably with his full-faced and slightly darker brother. The brothers wear dark-ribbed drap- ery and fringed dupattas. The landscape shows little detail. The plain ochre back- ground with long, narrow tufts yields abruptly to a pink band culminating in a few trees and oddly striped rocks amid a heavily stippled area. 72.

The women's cries rend the heart of the aged king, and he swoons once more. Moved by this spectacle, Rama and Laksmana join their father in the realm of unconsciousness. When all three recover, Rama asks formal permission to leave. Dasaratha tries to procrastinate }; and moderate the conditions of his exile, but Rama accepts ^ them blissfully., : .r The designer of this manuscript has determined the subject of this miniature by breaking the single line of text above the painting field after only three words: "[Dasaratha] 'jjl fell to the ground" (bar zamtn aftdd). Hence, the narrative '-1,*' ' moment of Syama's illustration of Dasaratha swooning be- fore Rama and Laksmana is almost inevitable, for it coincides - v : with both the text and the scene of the Jaipur model (no. 56). The painting itself, however, is entirely Syama's cre- ation. Seven large women with rounded profiles, white com- ? . ,f. . plexions, and brightly colored skirts gesture in dismay at the sight of the grief-stricken Dasaratha sprawled before his sons. The crude red contour shadows around the heads and arms of two men in the foreground are now distant echoes of the highlighting device used so effectively by G6vardhana early in the manuscript. The setting is comprised of three strict registers. The dull green tiled courtyard matches the violet wall in size and plainness, but the arcaded porch adds a measure of complex- ity to the uppermost register. A large floral pattern enlivens the band of blue carpet, and faint traces of objects adorn the white wall above the dado. - I 75.

A barefoot Dasaratha ' ' "" and Kausalya try in vain to keep pace with the chariot, but l I! Rama urges Sumantra to drive faster to hasten the moment " I of separation. As the chariot disappears over the horizon like _ 1 the setting sun, Ayodhyi is plunged into despair. The text , above the illustration describes a world grown dark and con-V fused, with moonlight warm and sunlight cold, and men and women estranged from one another. Sumantra acknowledges this cosmic lament by looking F up apprehensively at the heavens, which show no perceptible sign of turmoil. Rima, who has regained his regal crown and _ patterned dupatta, is, of course, untroubled by these cata- k . clysmic happenings, but turns to allay Siti's fears.

The artist reduces the grieving populace related in the text and represented in . .- the corresponding Jaipur painting (no. 57) to a mere three onlookers before the white walls of Ayodhyi, which the text names as Amarivati (Indra's celestial city as well as a famous Buddhist center in southern India). The mottled green landscape is articulated by crimson and green hillocks dotted with light rocks as well as by crim- son outcrops in the left background and foreground. To- gether with the short, hewn lobes of the latter, the palette and modeling of the figures relate this miniature by Nadim to his paintings on folios 26a and 59b. 77.

Shastri I: 269, 275 Text: I3 I/2 11. above Title inscription in the upper margin Published: Bhaktipada, p. 109 (fig. 78) Rama and his companions cannot elude the scores of inhabi- tants of Ayodhya who continue to beg him to return. Elderly brahmans struggle against the infirmities of age to keep up with the chariot, but their attachment to Rama does not fal- ter even for a moment. They ask him only to have mercy on those creatures, such as trees bound to the earth, which can- not abide their desire to follow him. Rama slows in compas- sion, and halts for the evening on the bank of the seemingly impassable Tamasa River. Like the Jaipur scene of Laksmana washing Rama's feet (no. 58), this illustration depicts Rama's companions in an at- tendant role. A turbaned Sumantra and a bareheaded Laks- mana converse with Rama, who props his head up with his right arm as he lies beside Sita on the bank on the Tamasa River. This subject anticipates the narrative development of the text, which begins with Dasaratha and Kausalya dis- cussing Rama's future hardships and ends with Rama's party resting beside the river, and does not mention Sumantra, Laksmana, or Sita. That the contents of the title inscription in the upper margin are identical to those of the text on this page rather than descriptive of the illustration indicates that the titles are primarily captions for the text. The artist evokes the riverside setting with a thin stream of water falling from a tall pink outcrop to flow along the left and bottom edges of the composition. Many of the stones strewn along the river bank are marked by a peculiar criss- cross pattern. Two mountain goats peer out from among the rocks, and the ever-present orange bird swoops across the sky. The miniature poses a thorny problem of attribution, for the names of three different artists - Syama Sundara, Sadi, and Nadim - can be read respectively in the remnant of an inscription below the painting and in the clearer but more remote ascriptions on either side of the cover sheet. Al- though the validity of the placement of the cover sheet as- criptions has been questioned, the credibility of all but a few is borne out by careful scrutiny of the stylistic evidence. The attribution to Nadim is the easiest to dismiss; despite the strong resemblance of Sumantra to the figure of Visvamitra on folio 6oa, the dark, congested landscape here has little in common with the lighter, more expansive landscapes by Nadim on folios 26a and 59b. Moreover, the cover sheet sep- arates paintings on folios 9ob and 9gb, so that the ascription to Nadim probably governs only the former. Syama Sundara, whose name can tentatively be read in the ascription below, is another possibility. ~yama depicts both the loosened hair and blanket again in folio 99b, and figures quite like the large-headed Sita in folios IIIb and IIsa. Likewise, the outcrop and crisscross articulation of the rocks approximate forms which Syima employs throughout his work, such as the illustration on folio 93b. Yet many of his landscapes show harsher colors and more mannered divi- sions. This leaves the third artist, Sadi, who is otherwise un- known. This uniqueness is puzzling, for the painting con- forms quite closely to the predominant style of many of the manuscript's illustrations. Nevertheless, analogous situa- tions do occur: the name Zayn al-'Abidin appears just twice in this manuscript, and 'Abdullah, Madhava, and Bfila are known from single paintings in either the I616-I7 Razm- nama or the I616 Shahncma. The presence of this clear ascrip- tion on the cover sheet cannot be dismissed altogether, and raises the strong possibility that this painting is the sole doc- umented example of Sadi's work. 78.

Shastri I: 283-284 Text: 611. above; 411. below Title inscription on f. 9ib Published: Bhaktipada, p. z12; Seyller, "A Sub-imper- ial Mughal Manuscript," fig. 2 (fig. 79) Not wishing to prolong his subjects' ordeal in the forest, Rama orders Sumantra to depart surreptitiously and to lay deceptive tracks which will discourage them from following any further. The ploy is successful, and the disconsolate peo- ple return to a joyless Ayodhya. Meanwhile, Rama pushes on until he reaches the sacred Ganges, whose banks are graced with hermitages. Rama orders Sumantra to make camp be- neath a large shady tree. Guha, whom the text describes as king of the Bhils, a tribal people, approaches and offers his service and gifts to Rama. Syama follows the textual description of this encounter to show Guha presenting gifts to Rama, who is seated be- neath a bright, heavily modeled fig tree with small fruit and hanging roots. The spotted makara (a crocodilian creature) and other creatures frolicking in the river are inspired by the account in the first two lines of text above the painting ex- tolling the purity and fecundity of the Ganges. The Freer il- lustration deviates from the Jaipur version of the scene (no. 59) in the omission of Sita and the river, as well as in the ad- dition of regal attire to Rama, Laksmana, and their visitor.13 The illustration is among gyama's most assured efforts in the manuscript. Every figure is endowed with a dignified demeanor and notably crisp contours. gyama allows the two large text panels to suggest a logical structure to the compo- sition. The shape of the painting's central section emphasizes the meeting between Rama and Guha, but the abrupt dark- ening of the tufted ground between the two groups intro- duces a measure of separation. The narrower areas along the painting's perimeter are neatly filled with the ancillary ele- ments of the Ganges River, the shady tree, and the golden buildings of Guha's city of rfigavera, nestled behind a rounded crimson ridge. The ascription and inspection note in the lower margin provide the first date in the manuscript, I006/I597-98. The position of this first dated folio little more than a third of the way into the painting cycle establishes a chronology differ- ent from the commonly cited one of 996-Io07/1587-88 to 1598-99 recorded by 'Abd al-Rahim himself in the flyleaf note. 79.

Shastri I: 293 Text: Diagonal passages on the preceding folio; 3 11. below Published: Bhaktipada, frontispiece (fig. 80) Rama sends Sumantra back to Ayodhya, asking him to in- form Dasaratha of their well-being and to advise him to in- stall Bharata as king as soon as possible. The trio then cross the Ganges and enter the forest. Rama cautions Laksmana that they no longer have their loyal charioteer to stand guard over Sita, and that now her protection is their responsibility alone. The brothers hunt deer and gather wild fruit, and pre- pare to pass their first night alone in the wilderness. The scene conveys the minimal comforts of their new life by showing Laksmana giving a few lotus flowers to Rama and Sita. A more hospitable world is depicted in the correspond- ing Jaipur miniature (no. 60), which represents the peaceful creatures of the jungle surrounding a tank before the three figures. Here, however, Rama, Laksmana, and Sita are juxta- posed with the trussed bodies of four deer, which are men- tioned in the first line of text in the panel below the painting. Both the figures and the landscape show Syama's return to his highly idiosyncratic style. Laksmana is endowed with very narrow-set eyes and pointed nose, Sita with a blocky, re- ceding brow and hair which rests flat atop her shoulders. The stability of Rama's seated pose is disrupted by an oddly up- turned leg. The handling of the landscape reveals gyama at his most extreme. The dark triangular wedge along the river sharply separates the lotus-filled water from the heavy horizontal ridges of the area behind the figures; similar ridges appear in several of gyama's paintings, notably folios 85b and Io5a (figs. 73, 91). The roots of the yellow tree to the right form a limp weblike pattern which recalls those of folios 87a and iiib more than it does Fazl's bold, expansive systems. gyama's hand is also apparent in the tall, curved lobes of the garishly 80.

Shastri I: 294-96 Text: 9 11. above; i line below Title inscription in the upper margin Published: Bhaktipada, p. IIS (fig. 8I) Rama fears for his mother's welfare, and begs Laksmana to re- turn to Ayodhya to protect her. Laksmana assuages his brother's doubts with the simple assertion that both he and Sita could never live apart from Rama. Upon resuming their journey, they hear the familiar roar of the confluence of the Ganges and Yamuna Rivers and soon reach the hermitage of Bharadvaja. This illustration shares only a rough notion of the ar- rival of Rama's party at Bharadvaja's hermitage with its counterpart in the Jaipur Ramayana (no. 6I). Whereas the latter conjures up a large city at the confluence of the mighty rivers, the boat in which Rama arrives, and a small army of rsis, the Freer scene summons the more limited vision of Rama, Laksmana, and Sita coming upon a single hermit seated on a tigerskin before his asrama or hermitage. Al- though the textual accounts in the two manuscripts differ somewhat in detail and vocabulary, the images fall at ap- proximately the same point in the narrative, that is, Rama greeting the sage. The figures here are like many of Fazl's characters. The round-faced, wide-eyed Rama is virtually identical to the same figure on the reverse of the folio. Bharadvaja, Laks- mana, and Sita all have angular brows and tight mouths, a fa- cial type to which Fazl is strongly predisposed. Sita's white o.dhani shifts abruptly from translucent to opaque, and the dupattas of both Rama and Laksmana show Fazl's favored crosshatching. The setting is rather subdued for Fazl, save for the pro- nounced treatment of the rock contours in contrasting col- ors, a feature seen in folios 45a and I4ob. A foreground pond set before the narrow hermitage symbolizes the confluence, and a bright green-leaved tree quivers against the intense blue sky. 8i.

Shastri I: 300-05 Text: ii lines above Title inscription in the upper margin Rama's repose, Citrakfita Mountain labelled Published: Bhaktipada, p. II7 (fig. 83) Sita delights in every new flower and tree that they pass on the way to Citrakuta Mountain. Finally the trio reach the base of the mountain itself, and marveling at its sweet splen- dor, exclaim that it must surpass even paradise. The painting departs from a literal interpretation of the text, for the last two lines on this side of the folio recount Dasaratha's shock at Sumantra's news of Rama's hardships, the subject of the Jaipur illustration (no. 64). The lavishly described bounty of Citrakiuta Mountain finds unexceptional representation in a landscape whose low hill, rock-lined stream, and two flowering trees are all generic features of landscapes in this manuscript. Sita kneels before Rama and raises a finger in wonderment; Laksmana again is relegated to the side. The artist is content to take the marginal correction between lines 6-7 as the upper limit of the painting field. Kamal shows something of Fazl's bold sense of design in his landscapes, but remains wedded to the principle of structural clarity in his outcrops and registers where Fazl might be inclined to dally with flourishes of shape and color. Kamal's figures depart more radically from Fazl's lead, being genteel rather than savage; here, for example, they begin to display the explicit detail of Syama's most careful works.

Kau- salya's stinging words prompt Dasaratha to recall an inci- C dent which had sown the seeds of this bitter fate. As a youth, ? !.Da aratha was hunting near the Sarayu River, and acciden- ::. t i tally killed a young ascetic who was fetching water for his blind parents. The brahman couple greatly lamented the loss of their innocent son, and despite Dasaratha's profound re- ,-" _ ' \ ~ ,,,4~ ~morse, cursed the king to suffer the same fate one day. The illustration depicts Dasaratha raising his hands in F obeisance to the mourning hermits, who bend over their fallen son.

Foremost among these is Dasaratha's face, whose pointed shape and directed gaze fall outside Fazl's figure types. The elongated, pinched shape of the king's fore- arms and the articulation of his ankle with a pronounced U- shaped form are distinctive features of many of Kala Pahara's works, especially folios Io2a and Io2b (figs. 87-88). Unchar- acteristic of Fazl's oeuvre, too, are the black outline and inter- nal detailing of the massive brown tree rising up from the lower corner to support a white carrying-pole. Kala Pahara is content with a simple curved horizon, but softens the stark field of green with a smattering of rough vegetation. 84.

The loud !i wailing of the harem alerts Kausalya and Sumitra to the king's demise, and they join the court women in the tradi- r :*!

Taken together, however, they become a '': : ",'" ;" series of arrested actions along a formulaic continuum of 4 mourning, an impression generated by both the exceedingly ' I , i I regular spacing between the figures and the obvious, static organization of the composition.

Thus when messengers arrive from Ayodhya, Bharata is already quite ap- prehensive; they reassure him, but urge him to come quickly i with his brother. At Ayodhya, Bharata's worst suspicions are .i ^ callously confirmed by Kaikeyl, whom he vehemently de- nounces for her role in this tragedy. Bharata and Satrughna hasten to console Kausalya.

I40 (fig. 92) The size of Bharata's retinue initially raises some suspicion of his motives, but Guha soon realizes Bharata's complete de- votion to Rama. He tells him of Rama's visit and shows him the very spot where Rama had slept. When morning comes, Guha gathers for Bharata's transport 500 boats, each with a different standard. Syama maintains the small figure scale of folios Io03b and IO5a for this scene of Bharata and his army crossing the Ganges. The idea of an embarkation scene is almost certainly inspired by the Jaipur painting (no. 70), but the action of the illustration adheres to the narrative development of the text in the upper panel. Hence, the Jaipur scene shows Guha's 500 boats being loaded; with another line of the absolutely identical text inserted above the illustration, the Freer paint- ing depicts the boats in midstream, adding the detail of their unique standards, rendered here as four refreshingly inven- tive animal-headed prows. Yet this literal illustration of the text does not extend beyond the basic narrative to include such details as Satrughna and the queens, who are repre- sented in the Jaipur page. 92.

I49 (fig. 96) Celestial beings, who know that Rama must remain in exile in order to vanquish Ravana, help Rama persuade Bharata to leave the forest and take his place as king. As Bharata's en- tourage prepares to depart, Rama returns a pair of sandals to his brother, who promises to revere them like Rama himself. Rama also orders Bharata to accord Kaikeyi - despite her loathsome action - the same honor that he grants Kausalya. A round of tearful leave-taking culminates in Rama falling at the feet of each of the three forlorn queens. The long panel of text ends with an account of this dra- matic gesture, and thus determines the subject of the illus- tration, which represents a slightly later development in the story than does its crowded counterpart in the Jaipur manu- script (no. 74). Laksmana and Sita gesticulate towards Rama to focus attention on the prostrate, dark-skinned figure; off to the side, Vasistha and the crowned Bharata express their dismay. The tufted bands of ochre and green, schematic lobes of the foreground rocks, and detailed figures are virtually identical to those of Syama's paintings on folios 93b and IIIb, thereby confirming the imperfectly legible ascription in the lower margin. 96.

Shastri 2: 6-8 Text: 9 11. above Viradha div labelled Published: Bhaktipada, p. I52 (detail) (fig. 97) Forging their way deeper into the Dandaka forest, Rama and Laksmana come upon a monstrous creature who menacingly demands to know their names. Impatient for an answer from the unknown ascetics, the demon Viradha snatches Sita. A ferocious battle ensues, with Rama displaying his prowess with arms by intercepting the demon's deadly trident with a well-aimed arrow. Viradha boasts that he cannot be killed by any weapon, so Rama and Laksmana bludgeon the beast into submission and prepare to bury him alive. With this, Viradha realizes the identity of his adversaries and suddenly reveals himself to be a celestial being named Tumburfi, lib- erated from the hideous form cursed upon him because of his lust for the siren Rambha (see fig. 57). This simple scene of combat, the first painting in the Aranya Kanda or Forest Book, illustrates the action of the last line of the text panel and the two words just outside the ruled area by depicting Rama shattering Viradha's golden trident. Laksmana looks up as his wheat-colored brother fits a second arrow to the bow in order to down the spotted Per- sianate demon himself. A more comprehensive scene is pre- sented in the Jaipur illustration (no. 75), which incorporates both the rescued Sita and the emancipation of Tumburu from the hulking form of Viradha. By contrast, the I594 manuscript represents the initial verbal encounter of the trio and the enormous demon, whose trident is flamboyantly laden with the skins of eight lions. This painting is another of ~yama's strongest efforts. He bestows Rama with a dignified profile and an intense ex- pression, and outfits him in strongly modeled dhoti and fringed dupatta. Sharply tilted outcrops ring the pronounced yellow and green registers of the landscape. The airborne Viradha shares the flat blue sky with two large colored birds and several strings of schematic black ones - both ubiquitous features in this manuscript. 97.

Shastri 2:58-59 Text: 10 11. above Trisiras labelled Published: Bhaktipada, p. I65 (fig. 98) Surpanakha, the sister of the evil Ravana, becomes enamored of the handsome Rama at first sight. Rama mockingly steers the revolting creature toward his unmarried brother, but the raksasi grows enraged and threatens Sita. Laksmana heeds Rama's injunction against slaying women and is content to punish the demoness by cutting off her nose and ears. The disfigured gurpanakha asks her brother Khara to avenge this insult; he complies by ordering an assault of I4,000 demons. When Rama single-handedly annihilates these legions, Tri- siras, the champion of the demon army, hurls himself upon him, and the two exchange volleys of arrows. Trisiras man- ages to strike Rama's brow three times, but Rama proceeds to destroy the demon's chariot and sever his three heads. Lacking any sort of prototype in the Jaipur manuscript, this painting follows the usual pattern of the Freer illustra- tions by eliminating the demon's chariot and other details of battle until only a dark-skinned Rama and his brother are left beside an arrow-riddled Trisiras. The bloodied three- headed rdksasa sprawls head over heels, the conventional pose of defeat. His animal-headed mace lies useless on the dark green ground, which is overlaid with a regular pattern of yellow and green sheaves. A tall outcrop aligned banally with the bottom of the text panel supports two trees which bend to fill the sky. Along with the name of Syama Sundara, the fragment- ary inscription in the lower margin supplies the date of the first of Sha'ban I009, a Hijra date which corresponds to 5 Feb- ruary 60oi. This second date in the manuscript establishes a hiatus in this section of the painting cycle or at least a signi- ficant slowing of the rate of illustration. 98.

I78 (fig. ioo) News of Rama's exploits and Sita's beauty reaches Ravana, the supreme demon king. The demon Marica (cf. folio 38b) temporarily convinces Ravana that his scheme to steal Sita from Rama is sheer folly, but gurpanakha goads Ravana into action by impugning his valor and extolling Sita's loveliness. Ravana decides to act. He asks Marica, who is skilled in magic, to assume the guise of a golden deer so wondrous that Sita will beg Rama to capture it. While Rama is lured from Sita's guard, Ravana will carry off Sita, and Rama will die of sorrow. Marica vigorously objects. He recalls his own hum- bling experience with Rama, proclaims Rama's righteous- ness and might, and forecasts certain destruction for all who oppose him. Nonetheless, he yields to his master's wishes. Everything proceeds according to plan. Marica thor- oughly beguiles Sita with his magnificent skin, and entices Rama away from the hermitage with fleeting appearances. As Rama fatally wounds the illusory deer, Marica completes the deception by crying out for Laksmana and Sita in Rama's voice. Sita insists that Laksmana go to Rama's assistance; against his better judgment, Laksmana does so, leaving Sita to become Ravana's prey. The narrative and formal directness of Fazl's illustration of this pivotal episode of the Ramayana mounts a rare chal- lenge to the visual impact of the corresponding Jaipur scene (fig. ioi). The Jaipur painting is an especially critical one be- cause it is the only one ascribed explicitly to Banavari Khfird, who, as we will see, later left the imperial atelier to join 'Abd al-Rahi. m's workshop.'6 Both works show Rama pursuing Marica, but the Jaipur painting defeats the very purpose of Ravana's ploy by allowing the entire scene to transpire within view of Laksmana and Sita. In contrast, the sparseness of the Freer composition emphasizes Rama's isolation as he aims a crescent-headed arrow at his fleeing prey, whose golden body is adorned with decorative medallions and silver flecks.

Fazl consistently uses strong tonal contrasts to intensify his shapes and colors. The light, barren ground sets off the flat- tened form of the angular brown tree, which overlies the un- compromisingly rectangular band of sky. Yellow-green leaves glow against a core of black in the flamelike trees in the foreground, and colored veins course through the rocks along the riverbank. The result is a series of discrete forms, their raw, abstract shapes undiminished by superfluous details. IOO. Ramayana, Freer Gallery of Art, f.

Iv Ravana remain thoroughly upright; indeed, the victim's re- "a b.ut onl in folo 3a w-- -' i' sistance is conveyed only by her pulled hair and the arc of her odhani. The drama of the abduction is further diffused by the bright yellow background and colorful birds streaking across the sky. Ravana is shown several times in the manuscript dressed in the same heavily modeled, knee-length orange jama, but only in folio I32a, which is ascribed to ~yama, does this dress appear again in conjunction with the distinctive mustachioed facial type, two ears in the center of the ten- headed visage, and the fleur-de-lis pattern in the crown. The restraint seen in the landscape is remarkable for an artist so inclined to impose rough patterns on fields of color; together with the painting's admirable clarity of design and con- trolled draftsmanship, it demonstrates gyama's capability at moments of real inspiration. 102.

Episode not related in Shastri Text: I2 11. above Indra, Sita-ji labelled Published: Bhaktipada, p. I90 (fig. 104) With Sita in tow, Ravana quickly flies to his kingdom in dis- tant Lanka. There he begins his campaign to break down Sita's resistance to his seductions, alternately tantalizing her with limitless riches and frightening her with dire prospects of captivity and death. Ravana orders her confined to the asoka grove under the guard of rdksasis (demonesses). The gods realize Sita's need for physical and emotional suste- nance, and ask Indra to bring her food to slake hunger and thirst for I0,000 years and encourage her with news of her imminent rescue by Rama. Sita modestly draws her o.dhanT across her face as she accepts Indra's celestial fare and listens to his news. The lotus cushion of the crowned visitor indicates his divine status, but in the absence of his distinctive eye-markings, a label is nec- essary to identify him as Indra. Unlike the setting of a single asoka tree in an open landscape, the corresponding Jaipur miniature (no. 8i) properly sets the scene within a walled compound and identifies Indra by attribute. Five slumber- ing rdksasis suffer the effects of the spell by which Indra en- tered the grove; all sport unusual hair, which twists at the roots and rises in multicolored wavy spikes. The delicate colors and draftsmanship resemble those of folios 34a and 53b (figs. 39, 50). The peculiar wrinkled smiles of Indra and Sita also relate to the facial expressions of figures in the earlier paintings ascribed to Ghulam 'Ali. I04. Ramaya.na, Freer Gallery of Art, f.

Io5) Rama and Laksmana return to find their worst forebodings confirmed by their empty hut. Following signs of Ravana's struggle with Jatayus, they finally come upon the vulture, who tells them with his dying breath that Sita has been ab- ducted by Ravana. The brothers now begin their long quest to recover her. Their travels soon bring them peril in the form of Ka- bandha, who, having had his head and thighs smashed into his body by Indra, has his mouth in his stomach and has grown long tentacular arms to gather food to quell his insa- tiable appetite. Challenged by this terrible demon, Rama and Laksmana cut off its arms. Kabandha rejoices when he learns their identity, for the gods have promised that he will be freed from his monstrous existence when Rama arrives. Rama and Laksmana converse congenially with Ka- bandha, whose grotesque physiognomy the artist has ren- dered by embedding the demon's head at the level of his shoulders, a solution also reached by the painters of the Jaipur illustration (no. 82). The Freer artist allows Kabandha to retain his arms, which are severed at this point in the story, and endows him with the usual demonic clawed feet, curling horns, fangs, and spots; he completes Kabandha's odd ap- pearance with a large pair of wings, a feature with no paral- lel in the text and only a minor basis in the iconography of Persian supernatural beings. The landscape consists of a plain pink ground culminating in an outcrop bent sharply over an area with regular vertical striations. This rock for- mation and the low hill in the distance seem to be crude imitations of forms in folio 35b. The foreground riverbank displays a similar formula, with squat rock lobes separating the water from a band of dark vegetation. The name Nadim appears on the cover sheet of the painting, but a note also written on the cover sheet states that ' "7 ''' / ' .^ A' ' ;1" A.A .t /. ... ~;.!, . .

The assessment by the anony- mous commentator seems correct. The dark complexion of Rama and the finely textured hair of both bareheaded heroes can be related to other works by Nadim, but this landscape is considerably more schematic than those of folios 26a, 59b, and 9ob. Nor can one arrive at this artist's name from the remnants of the ascription below the painting itself. The an- gled horizontal strokes after 'amal (work of) more easily yield the two initial letters of gyama Sundara, with whose style this painting better accords. In particular, the broad lobes of the foreground and middleground rocks, the conventional series of trees on the loaflike hill, and the abbreviated cityscape appear in several paintings ascribed to this artist, notably folios 83a, 92a, and iH5a. The two figures are also en- tirely compatible with an attribution to gyama. I05.

After Rama and Laksmana comply with his wishes, the newly prescient Kabandha tells Rama to seek out Sugriva, a monkey king banished by his evil brother Vali. As Rama and Laksmana pass near Kiskindha, the capital of Sug- riva's territory, Sugriva suspects Vali's hand again, and asks the great monkey Hanuman, who could change form at will, to ascertain their intentions. The scene of the two brothers' response to Hanuman's gesture of veneration, the only illustration of the Kiskindha Kanda (Book of Kiskindha), coincides exactly with the nar- rative development in the final and abbreviated line of text above the painting. It does not attempt to suggest the guid- ing force behind the encounter, as the Jaipur illustration (no. 83) does by juxtaposing Hanuman's greeting with a scene of Sugriva and his entourage. Despite the explicit textual re- quirement of mendicant's clothing for this mission, Hanuman is shown in both manuscripts as a crowned mon- key. This use of representative rather than variable iconogra- phy prescribed by the text is common in both the Freer and Jaipur manuscripts. Fazl occasionally indulges an unusual palette, most ap- parent here in the combination of Rama's salmon-colored dhoti and turquoise dupatta. His imposition of a severe recti- linear base on the pink ridge initiates a jarring collision with the avocado green ground. Fazl tempers his treatment of the large tree, minimizing his structural contortions in favor of large black clusters of foliage tessellated with bright leaves. Segments of the gold ruling around the original text area are revealed by the flaking on Laksmana's arm and on the feet of the three future allies. This establishes that the manuscript was written and ruled before the paintings were executed, a procedure often found in contemporary Mughal manu- scripts. io6. Ramayana, Freer Gallery of Art, f.

Shastri 3: 9I Text: Reduced text on the reverse of the folio Published: Jain-Neubauer, fig. 52; Beach, The Adven- tures of Rama, p. 39; Bhaktipada, p. 216 (detail) (fig. 107) This full-page illustration of Rama's war council appears after fifty-three unillustrated folios, an unparalleled lull in the pace of the manuscript's illustration. In this surprising distribution of images, only one illustration is allocated to the central narrative of the Kiskindha Kanda and the Sun- dara Kanda, which recount Rama's aid to Sugriva in his struggle against Vali, the participation of Sugriva's monkey hordes in the search for Sita, the eventual discovery of Sita on the island of Lafika, Hanuman's consolation of the forlorn Sita, and his brave exploits in Lafika. By contrast, these two books and the first section of the Yuddha Kanda receive six- teen illustrations in the Jaipur manuscript, thus marking the most prolonged divergence of the painting cycles of the two manuscripts. This radical change in the density of the rate of illustration in the Freer Rdmdyana occurred as the text was being written; there are no blank painting fields to this point in the manuscript, and the even writing of the text is dis- rupted only on the reverse of this folio, on which five lines are spread over an unruled page. As war looms ever closer, Vibhisana advises his elder brother Ravana to end the folly of abduction. Ravana vehe- mently rejects this prudent counsel, and Vibhisana goes over to Rama's side to offer his services. The last obstacle to the as- sault on Lafka, the vast ocean separating the island from the mainland, is overcome when Rama compels Sagara, Lord of the Ocean, into submission and Hanuman leads the monkeys in building a gigantic causeway across the waters. At last Rama and his army take up positions within sight of the im- posing fortress of Lafka, and begin to devise a plan of attack. This first illustration of the Yuddha Kanda shows Rama and Laksmana conferring with the vdnara chieftains on the lofty vantage point of Mt. Suvela. This scene of obser- vation and discourse is now stripped of its objective by the loss of the left half of the double-page composition, which certainly must have shown Lafka. This conclusion is sup- ported by both the appearance of the fortress in the double- page Jaipur composition (nos. IOO-OI) and the discrepancies in the narrative, text, and foliation described in Chapter 3. A wall of rocks spans the middle of the composition, thereby separating the council from the martial activities of the bears and monkeys in the foreground. Syama renders the rest of the landscape, the three figures, and the monkeys with unusually flat areas of color. The facial features and hair of the three human figures show the faintness characteristic of un- derdrawing and must be considered unfinished. 107. Rdmdyana, Freer Gallery of Art, f.

The time for planning passes, and the siege that will end Ravana's challenge to the rule of righteousness is now , : ;. J. launched in earnest. As the vdnaras swarm over the ramparts of Lanka, a host of demons makes a sortie, and the two armies e e engage in fierce battle. Among the heroes who emerge to give face to the anonymity of mass warfare is Hanuman. Despite a . very brief description of his battle with Jambumali, Hanu- man's illustrious reputation makes him the logical choice to represent a long series of individual contests between mon- . ..: . . keys and demons. .^ A , Hanuman leaps astride the yoke ofJambumali's chariot and topples the demon from the vehicle with a single crush- . ing blow of his hand. Though the small tree in Hanuman's left hand is not used in this particular encounter, the artist provides the crowned, round-faced monkey with this primi- -_ _ __ tive weapon as an attribute of his natural habitat and brute force. Fazl's setting for this individual conquest is a greatly simplified landscape. A mauve ridge extends across most of the painting at the level of the end of an unobliterated seg- . ment of the gold ruling of the original text column. A sche- matic cityscape and a bright yellow-leaved tree occupy the upper left and right corners respectively. Beneath the central expanse of the lightly tufted ground is a small stream with fish and waterfowl. io8.

Shastri 3: IIO Text: 5 11. above (fig. 109) The battle rages into the night. Indrajita, the son of Ravana, withdraws from his disastrous engagement with Afgada, a monkey hero, and invokes the boon of invisibility granted to him by Brahma. Hidden by this cloak of invisibility, more effective than the darkest night, he riddles Rama and Laksmana with arrows, and taunts them as blood flows like rivers from their wounds. Seeing Rama fall before this on- slaught of magic arrows, Laksmana succumbs to grief and pain and ceases to struggle, an act which disheartens their monkey allies in turn. Fazl's uninspired miniature is no match for Basavana's illustration of Indrajita's subjugation of Rama and Laksmana, one of the finest paintings in the Jaipur manu- script (no. 104) (fig. IIo). The Jaipur painting depicts the brothers and their allies rendered helpless by arrows un- leashed by Indrajita, whose magic Basavana conveys by ren- dering them as a swarm of serpents, a metaphor used occa- sionally in the text. From this dynamic scene, Fazl retains only the position of the demonic Indrajita among the swirling clouds in the upper right. A bareheaded Laksmana, whose loosened turban has been painted out, limply rests his head and arm on his knee, and Sugriva and Jambavan stand by with their arms folded lightly. Rama has been exempted from the paralyzing effects of the magic arrows, which lie passively before him. Thus the illustration presents no visi- ble cause for the stricken condition of Laksmana and his com- panions. Fazl adds but a few rocks and a meandering flowering tree to the formulaic combination of a flat green ground with hillocks laced with light pink and green veins. I09.

The Persian text exuberantly likens the expansive Kumbhakarna to Mt.

The comic assortment of demons, the fine draftsman- ship, and the particularly delicate gradations of the multi- colored ridges distinguish this painting from the surround- ing illustrations by Nadir. These features also appear in several works ascribed or attributed to Nadim, notably folios 63b and 9ob (figs. 6i, 77). II2.

As Kumbhakarna's massive head tumbles to the earth and ? ? crushes whole sections of the city, the elated allies raise a shout at the tremendous victory. Fazl disregards many of the details of Kumbhakarna's 5' demise. The mutilated face so prominent in the Jaipur illus- tration of this incident (no.

In- stead, with no sign of the fatal, luminous arrow, Fazl's illus- tration carries the conviction of inevitability as a triumphant 'iE Rama stands over the inverted body of his diminished and . headless foe. Kumbhakarna's grimacing head bounces into the foreground, its orange eyes, fangs, and elephantine ears j - -- quite unlike other artists' representations of the legendary demon. Fazl provides Rama with his customary dusty com- '" plexion and crown, but also endows the young hero with sur- ,i!Hi prisingly large, thick-set features which make him a stranger : to the artist's familiar range of figures. The landscape is unremarkable. The two branches of a short, winding bush spill into the upper text panel and fill in an otherwise plain section of the yellow field.

Shastri 3: 2I6 Text: 611. above Published: Beach, The Imperial Image, I5n; Beach, The Adventures of Rama, p. 49 (detail); Bhaktipada, p. 333 (fig. 12I) As night falls, a disconsolate Ravana takes stock of the series of champions laid low by Rama and his forces. Indrajita, in- visible and seemingly invincible, sallies forth to annihilate Rama and the monkey army once more. Rama persuades Laksmana to yield to Indrajita's darts so that he will claim victory and retire from the field. Laksmana agrees, and both fall seriously wounded. Jambavan, the leader of the bears, asks Hanuman to hasten to the Himalayas to retrieve four specific plants which will restore the brothers and their allies to health. Hanuman swells to enormous proportions, caus- ing the earth to sink beneath his weight, trees to topple and burst into fire, and snakes to appear from every crevice. Then, with all Lafika in turmoil, he traverses the ocean in one great leap and lands on Mt. Kailasa, the abode of gods and ascetics, to seek out the healing plants. This illustration by Ytusuf 'Ali appears at the same point in the text as the Jaipur illustration (no. 121), but pro- duces significantly different imagery. Instead of the figure of Hanuman towering over Rama and Laksmana, a throng of bears and monkeys, and a hillside teeming with snakes, Yusuf 'Ali's painting presents an average-sized Hanuman surveying a landscape with four blazing plants, a snake coiled around each one. Although these two elements are de- scribed in the text immediately above the painting field, their presentation here - together with Hanuman's gesture of wonderment and the absence of the send-off party - can easily lead one to misidentify the scene as Hanuman's search for the four healing plants. It is quite possible that the artist conflated the successive events of Hanuman's spectacular de- parture and his arrival in the Himalayas. Yusuf 'Ali's first painting in the manuscript immedi- ately suggests an affinity with Fazl's style. The strongest con- nection lies in the splayed lobes of the golden outcrops in the foreground, though their color lends them somewhat more elegance than we are accustomed to expect from Fazl. Other outcrops contain units which veer sharply to the side or trees which cling precipitously to the rock. 121.

I22) Incensed at the impudence of the mountain and plants that momentarily become invisible to foil his efforts to help Rama, Hanuman rips off the entire summit of the mountain, and hurtling through the air, brings the mountain top to Lafika to the noisy acclaim of the waiting monkeys. The won- drous plants immediately restore Rama and Laksmana to consciousness and revive the legions of slain monkeys. Then hoisting the peak aloft once more, Hanuman soars through the sky to return the mountainous cache to its place in the Himalayas. As happens so often in the Jaipur Ramayana, the imper- ial artists are given the luxury of a double-page composition (nos. 122-23) for an episode which receives much less space in the Freer manuscript. Every aspect of this story is elaborated, with the right half of the composition filled with small-scale images of Hanuman standing before a complex mountain, Rama and Laksmana extending their greetings, and a few monkeys awakening from the dead. The artists merely multi- ply this last element in the left half, but the overall effect is one of widespread excitement at the miraculous healing. By contrast, Zayn al-'Abidin focuses on just one of these ele- ments, emphasizing Hanuman's solitary mission - not, as we might expect, during the climactic delivery of the healing plants, but rather on his return of the mountain to the Hi- malayas. Unlike his Jaipur counterpart, Zayn al-'Abidin's Hanuman clearly bounds across the world, though the size of his rocky cargo hardly exceeds the boulders that the monkeys regularly fling about in battle. The four healing plants are not distinguished in any way; indeed, one suspects that the forms of vegetation radiating from the mountain are determined solely by a desire to fill as much of the flat blue sky as possible. 202</page><page sequence="200">I22.

Rama and Laksmana join in the attack. Drawing his great bow like Mahadeva (giva), Rama smashes one of Lafka's gates with an arrow. The monkeys surge forward to take advantage of this opening, but they are met by a torrent of demons pouring out of the citadel. In this right half of a double-page composition, Qasim clearly positions Rama to take the lead in the attack upon Lanka. The blue-grey hero is closest to the enemy ranks, pressing his taut bow against the very edge of the painting field. He is further emphasized by the contrast of his bright yellow dhoti against the violet zone behind him, and the lux- uriously patterned gold ends of his green dupatta. Laksmana and Sugriva are eased into their usual supporting roles by their smaller scale and lower placement in the composition. Still other monkeys and bears advance with sticks and stones. The rocks along the ridge of the central register and sweeping up to an outcrop in the right corner are filled with fussy lobes. This same combination of flat areas and schematic shapes and detailing appears in the upper ridges of the uppermost zone, which is topped by a white cityscape and serial trees. These features are often found in gyama's work, but Qasim is content to leave most sections of the ground plain. He also displays a unique figure style, seen most clearly here in Rama's complexion, almond-shaped eye, and fine draftsmanship. The artist has maintained a small unpainted patch around the folio number 240 written in Arabic numerals just below the gold sky. A cropped inscription in the lower mar- 123.

Shastri 3: 230-31 Text: 411. above; 211. below Hanuman; Nikumbha, son of Ravana labelled (fig. I26) Seeking to avenge the death of his brother Kumbha, Nikumbha charges Hanuman and begins to grapple with him. Nikumbha catches hold of Hanuman and lifts him high in the air, but Hanuman breaks free and knocks the rdksasa to the ground by leaping on his chest. Then the great mon- key wrenches off his opponent's head and sends him to perdi- tion. The artist presents a straightforward wrestling match with no suggestion of Hanuman's deadly moves. Hence, his painting follows the action described in the beginning of the first line of text. This is a rare departure from the usual pat- tern of illustrating the action recounted immediately before the break in the text, which in this case is the resumption of the battle between Dasaratha's sons and Indrajita. With characteristic expansiveness, the corresponding Jaipur miniature (no. I28), which falls at exactly the same point in the text, depicts Hanuman throttling Nikumbha as well as Rama and Laksmana drawing a bead on Indrajita in his aer- ial chariot. The two figures occupy the center of an ordinary land- scape. The prominent and regular yellow sheaves on the dull green field immediately bring Syama Sundara to mind. Al- though the strongly outlined pink and blue rock mounds are given somewhat less internal articulation than Syama is nor- mally inclined to do, the similarity of the foreground out- crop and the washy treatment of the rocks below the tree to Syama's works on folios I22b and 228b supports an attribu- tion to this artist. ?', . , .. } j ' }e -~ .r,,n,,s..,,- L 'L.J ? .b. . . =MW~~~~"' rl_ ?5( I26.

Shastri 3: 234 Text: 611. above Sri Ramacandra; Maharaksa, son of Khara labelled Published: Seyller, "Model and Copy," fig. 30; Seyller, "A Sub-imperial Mughal Manuscript," fig. 3 (fig. 127) Seeing one champion after another meet his end, Ravana now sends out an eager Maharaksa to confront Rama. Maharaksa reminds Rama of his slaying of his father Khara in the Dan- daka forest, and launches a mighty spear given to him by Siva. To the acclaim of a gallery of celestial beings, Rama shatters the weapon with well-aimed arrows, and then looses a fiery arrow at Maharaksa. The flaming bolt pierces the rdksasa's heart and instantly deprives him of life. A grey-skinned Rama continues to take aim at Maharaksa, who lies on the ground, chest already bloodied by an arrow. Qasim has endowed the demon with conven- tional attributes, though garbing him in a longer tunic, but he has also borrowed the golden streamers of Maharaksa's forearms from Fazl's painting on folio 24Ia. Laksmana, who is not mentioned in this episode, watches from the edge of a dark green field. Even with his inclusion, the Freer scene is far more reduced in detail than its descriptive counterpart in the Jaipur Rdmayana (no. 129), which includes a destroyed chariot, celestial onlookers, and an explicitly luminous arrow. The painting is clearly signed by Qasim and dated IOI2/I603-04 in a lobed cartouche in the water in the lower right corner, providing conclusive evidence for the later dat- ing of the manuscript. 127.

Shastri 3: 239 Text: ii lines above; diagonal marginal insertion Indrajita, Hanuman-ji labelled Published: Bhaktipada, p. 339 (fig. I29) Now Indrajita resorts to a new stratagem to weaken the re- solve of Rama and his allies. Using his powers of sorcery, he fabricates an illusory image of Sita, which he places in his chariot and parades before Hanuman and his companions. Indrajita proceeds to slay the sobbing apparition and then taunts the great monkey for the futility of his efforts to res- cue Rama's beloved. The ruse achieves its desired effect, as first Hanuman and then the two brothers are plunged into despair. Laksmana is so dismayed by this cruel injustice that he even questions the existence of dharma, the rule of right- eousness in the world. The series of taunts and threats recounted in the eleven lines of text above the painting culminates in a description of Indrajita striking down the illusory Sita with his sword; the following bit of text, whose inclusion immediately above the painting field was considered important enough that the scribe appended it to the text column, somewhat redun- dantly describes Sita falling to the ground. The artist duti- fully heeds this strong suggestion and shows the body of the beheaded apparition between Hanuman and the one-horned Indrajita. This reduction to a single champion and antago- nist again contrasts with the fullness of the Jaipur image (no. 132), which is more faithful to the text in showing the execu- tion of a chariot-borne Sita before the entire monkey army. Together with the muted idiosyncracies of the render- ing of most monkeys and demons, the grimacing face of Sita yields almost no clue as to the identity of the artist responsi- ble for this image. Nonetheless, we can recognize Qasim's work from his handling of the relatively minimal back- ground. The paucity of the brushy markings on the dull green field, the broad, rectangular lobes of the strongly colored ar- chitectonic outcrops, and the stark silhouettes of the trees perched incongruously along the top of the text panel recall Qasim's paintings on folios I23b and 244a (figs. 99, I27).

I30) Vibhisana convinces Rama that since Ravana had refused all entreaties in the past to give up Sita, the woman whose exe- cution the monkeys just witnessed must have been an ap- parition conjured up by Indrajita. He urges Rama to send Laksmana, Hanuman, and Jambavan to attack Indrajita so that he may not complete the sacrifice that will make him in- vincible. So furious is their assault that Indrajita is ulti- mately forced to take the field. Fazl presents three separate scenes in this illustration. Above the text panel, Laksmana and Jambavan, the bear king, plan the attack against Indrajita's forces. In the central section, whose pale green ground ends very abruptly to the left of the text panel, Hanuman wields a large tree against his foes. Isolated from the commotion above by a rocky purple screen, Indrajita himself rides a chariot into battle from the lower left. Fazl repeats from earlier paintings the eruptive form of the upper outcrop, the strongly colored rocky pal- isade in the foreground, the ornamental branches and roots of Hanuman's weapon, and the tree bent precariously side- ways to fill the blue-grey sky. The violent juxtapositions of color and the large number of figures make for a liveliness which rivals that of its Jaipur counterpart (no. 133). I30.

The sheer number of figures occasions a figure scale smaller than that found throughout most of the Freer Rdmd- yanza, a characteristic of Yuisuf 'All's work. This fussiness also extends to the landscape, which is laid out in gently overlap- ping fan-shaped areas studded with leaf-edged rocks. An- other peculiarity of this landscape is the arbitrary emphasis of a few squarish lobes within each outcrop by means of dark grassy contours. 13I.

The potent weapon flies straight to its mark and decapitates Indrajita, whose bloody head falls to the ground. Fazl seems to place great stock in the arrow's absolute accuracy, for he positions Laksmana far from his target and forces him to shoot at an angle which would defy the course r of a normal trajectory. Nonetheless, Laksmana manages to , ' ; sever Indrajita's head, which bounds into the foreground, : '- " , ~'" i taking along a monkey who maintains a tight hold on one of _ H ' its horns. Indrajita's headless body is represented upright, a position rare among the vanquished in the Freer manuscript. TheJaipur illustration (no.

A circular golden breastplate appears prominently on Indrajita's brightly colored tunic, and golden leg-guards .... adorn the demon's bulbous legs. Laksmana's body and cloth- ing are decidedly angular. Sharply delineated lobes and ridges mark shrill-colored zones, which are more obviously arbitrary in shape than those of other artists contributing to the manuscript. The steel-grey sky and the ornamental pat- tern of the leafy stump behind a rock in the lower left are fa- miliar elements of Fazl's work. 132.

Shastri 3: 289 Text: 1/4 line above; 411. below Published: Bhaktipada, p. 346 (detail) (fig. I36) After Mahodara and Mahaparsva fall before the monkey champions Sugriva and Afgada, Ravana resolves to cut down the stalwart Rama, the source of all his troubles. He and Rama exchange volleys of ordinary arrows, which, no matter how well-aimed they are, prove ineffective against the other. Then Ravana begins to employ a series of magical weapons, turning first to the awesome Asura weapon, which produces arrows tipped with the heads of ferocious creatures such as crocodiles, boars, and snakes. Rama counters by discharging the fiery Agneya weapon, which transforms his own arrows into flaming missiles. These streak through the air like comets and other celestial bodies and consume Ravana's pack of predatory shafts. Though vividly described in the Persian text, Ravana's animal-headed arrows enjoy neither the prominence nor the potency they are accorded in theJaipur version (nos. 143-44), in which whole beasts surge forward from a fiery bank. In- stead, the creatures are reduced to tiny motifs on the arrows, whose golden tips plunge harmlessly into the plain green field before Rama. Dismayed at the futility of his effort, the raksasa king strikes a gesture of consternation and no longer bothers to wield actively any of his impressive assortment of weapons. Rama, of course, shows no such hesitation, and takes aim at the looming figure. Laksmana serves as Rama's second, separated from the duelists by a ridge and a spread- ing tree. A rdksasa with an animal-headed mace is similarly sequestered in the lower left. This painting by Syama demonstrates the extent to which this artist has embraced the group style fashioned largely by other artists, particularly Fazl and Qasim. gyama's figures have become much less idiosyncratic, with his Rama nearly indistinguishable from the dusky figure in Qasim's painting on folio 237b (fig. I23). Some iconographic change occurs as well, as Syama allows Ravana to shed the mustache that he sported in folios I3ia and I32a. Above all, gyama achieves a better balance between color and drawing. The colors are generally richer, unmuddied now by superfluous internal details, and the contours benefit from much more as- sured draftsmanship. Nevertheless, some preferences remain constant, as the brilliant mauve ridge and thinly painted mottled blue strongly recall his work on folio i22b (fig. 98). I36.

Shastri 3: 291-92 Text: 9 11. above Published: Beach, The Adventures of Rama, p. 55 (detail); Bhaktipada, p. 352 (fig. I37) Laksmana provokes Ravana's anger when he disrupts the rdksasa's attack on his younger brother Vibhisana with a great spear. Ravana alters his target and hurls the deadly shaft at Laksmana. As the spear speeds toward Laksmana, Rama invokes his spiritual power and mitigates the divine boon that makes the weapon inevitably lethal. Nonetheless, the spear strikes Laksmana with such force that it passes through his chest and pins him to the ground. The monkeys try in vain to pull it out, but only Rama has the strength to perform the task. As he does, Ravana riddles Rama's body with arrows, so that his body looks like a mountain covered with writhing snakes. Yusuf'Ali is faithful to the action described in the text. As in the Jaipur illustration (no. I45), Rama disregards the arrows protruding from his own body as he takes hold of the long lance that has impaled his brother. A single monkey trying to raise Laksmana's foot represents the futile efforts of the brothers' allies. A narrow stream flowing diagonally across the dark green field hooks around the two brothers to insulate them from the slender Ravana, who is positioned at a safe distance. Several features establish this painting as the work of Yuisuf 'Ali. The most obvious is the roundish face of Rama, whose nose springs directly from his brow as it does in folios 277a and 283a. The rectangular lobes seen in folio 253b are softened in the pink ridge bifurcating the composition. The schematic cityscape and precipitous outcrop are consistent with Yfisuf'Ali's other paintings, as is the mottled blue sky. 137.

Seeing his master exhausted, Ravana's driver starts to withdraw from the field, but a de- termined Ravana orders him to rush directly at Rama once more. As Ravana's impending doom is signaled by ever more ominous portents, the world trembles during the titanic seven-day struggle. Rama severs one head after another from Ravana's battery of ten heads, but each grows back immedi- ately. Finally, at the urging of his driver Matali, Rama selects the Brahma weapon, an arrow as fearsome as death itself. The divinely charged arrow strikes Ravana in the breast and kills him. The Persian text above the painting concludes with a description of how the arrow passes through Ravana's body, buries itself in the ground, continues on to the sea, where it is washed clean, and finally returns to Rama's quiver. This culminating victory is illustrated in the Jaipur manuscript with characteristic literalness and comprehen- siveness. Anchored by the two rivals in their charging chari- ots, the double-page composition (nos. I46-47) is filled with legions of demons and monkeys and a gallery of celestial onlookers. Bleeding from his fatal chest wound, Ravana, conqueror of the three worlds, plummets to the ground. Only in the imaginative detail of Ravana's ten severed and scattered heads does the artist depart from the textual ac- count. By contrast, Fazl's much less grand rendition of Ravana's death is indistinguishable from the long series of vanquished demons. Rama releases the fatal arrow, which, as is the case in folio 255a (fig. I32), seems to owe its accuracy more to its divine powers than to Rama's actual aim. Fazl fails to include any sign of the chariots or the weapon that smites Ravana in the chest. Instead, he uses the layout of the text to reinforce Ravana's demise, the lower text panel sepa- rating Ravana's lifeless body from his ten heads and pairs of arms. Four monkeys add to the ignominy of defeat by gnaw- ing at the prostrate giant while three rdksasas scurry for cover behind a bright blue ridge. The sharp division of the flat green field from the lower edge of the blue ridge to the left is typical of Fazl's personal style. So too are the tall lobes of the ridge, Rama's boyish face, and the steel-grey sky. I38. Ramayana, Freer Gallery of Art, f. 27oa. 221</page><page sequence="219">.

Shastri 3: 337-38 Text: ii lines above Published: Bhaktipada, p. 356 (fig. 140) Informed of Rama's victory and adorned with splendid rai- ment, Sita is brought before Rama. Their joyous reunion is marred, however, by Rama's decision to test Sita's devotion and virtue. He proclaims that he has avenged the insult of his wife's abduction, but also adds that he is unable to take Sita back because some may think that her honor was sullied dur- ing her long captivity. An astonished Sita protests this base- less charge, and then vows to undergo the fire ordeal as proof of her virtue. Clasping her hands together and circumambu- lating first the fire and then Rama, Sita calls out for the gods to watch over her and the fire to bear witness to her purity. As she fearlessly steps into the pyre, everyone's eyes fill with tears. She emerges unscathed, and Rama confides to Agni, the god of fire, that he personally never doubted Sita's purity, but arranged for this display to lay to rest any suspicions among the public. Rama, Laksmana, Vibhisana, and the monkeys and bears seem absorbed in conversation even as Sita sits on a small platform in the midst of a golden fire. The text, which ends three-quarters of the way across the panel and perhaps a line before it might have, concludes not with Sita's vindica- tion, as does the Jaipur version (no. 149), but with the reac- tion of the dismayed beholders to Sita's entry into the pyre. The flower-bedecked dark green field ends suddenly at the level of the bottom of the text panel. Rama's rounded profile, Laksmana's weasel-like face, and the washy mixture of blue and gold in the sky are very similar to those features in the following painting, and thus support an attribution to Yusuf'Ali. ~~~~~ Ls~~~~~~~~L ~~~~;~Iv 140.

Shastri 3: 363 Text: 4 I/411. above Published: Bhaktipada, p. 364 (fig. I4I) The gods grant Rama an audience in heaven with Dasaratha, whose grief at Rama's banishment is finally assuaged as he re- alizes that Rama's exile and his very incarnation as a man are part of a divine plan to destroy Ravana and restore order to the world. At Dasaratha's request, Rama prepares to make the long journey back to Ayodhya, a trip greatly facilitated by Vibhisana's offer of the use of the aerial chariot Puspaka. As the chariot soars through the air, Rama points out to Sita the sites of their many adventures. On the final night of his fourteen-year exile, Rama stops at the hermitage of Bharad- vaja, who provides another capsule summary of Rama's ex- ploits and causes all the trees along the road to blossom and bear fruit. Hanuman is sent to Ayodhya to inform Bharata of Rama's imminent arrival. He finds the reluctant king on the outskirts of the city, enduring the deprivations of an ascetic life in imitation of his beloved brother. When Bharata hears Hanuman's glad tidings, he orders the exultant population to adorn the city in preparation for Rama's reception. At last the Puspaka chariot appears in the sky, and Rama, radiant like the moon, receives the homage of Bharata. After the celestial chariot touches down, Bharata raises his hands in obeisance once more, and embraces Rama, Laksmana, Sita, and the monkey allies. Yusuf 'All's illustration of the brothers' reunion coin- cides exactly with the narrative development in the text on the page. Hair loose and hands clasped together in a gesture of reverence, Bharata approaches the litter in which Rama and Sita are seated opposite Laksmana, Jambavan, Vib- hisana, Sugriva, and three retainers. In contrast to the Jaipur illustration (no. iSo), which renders the Puspaka chariot as individual floral thrones hovering in the sky, Yusuf 'All lends the celebrated vehicle a sturdy architectural quality by surmounting it with a massive canopy and allowing it to span the width of the painting. His facial types are increas- ingly distinctive, from the long-nosed, wedge-shaped head of Laksmana, to the unusually high position of the eye on the head seen in Rama, the figure behind the bearded Vibhisana, and the attendant in the lower right.

With the eminent Sugriva, Vibhisana, and the dark- skinned Satrughna as his flywhisk and parasol bearers, Rama sits alone on the throne and wears the pearl necklace pre- i . sented to him by Indra. The crowd of small figures around _: the perimeter of the courtyard are unusually varied in com- plexion, though not in expression. Fazl indulges in a favorite .. : ^- device by depicting the onlooker at the bottom center directly from the back, a particularly difficult view to render. ';i The stepped array of Siva, Brahma, Visnu, and Indra in the thinly painted sky repeats the angle of the canopy extending i from the left of the open porch. Although this painting is relatively densely populated _ for the Freer manuscript, its visual texture pales before that LA of the corresponding scene in theJaipur manuscript (no. 153), which also places Sita at Rama's side on the throne. Fazl's penchant for flatly painted surfaces, most evident in the grey carpet and underside of the canopy and the ochre courtyard, contributes to the sense of simplification. 142.

Shastri 3: 394 Text: 61/211. above Sri Bhagavana (Visnu) labelled (fig. I43) The Yuddha Kanda draws to a close by extolling Rama's blissful rule and the merits of reciting the Ramaya.na. In the Uttara Kanda (Final Book), the Ramdyana starts off in a new direction, as sages led by Agastya answer a question from Rama with a long account of the origin of Ravana and the rdksasas. Rdksasas, who were granted the right to occupy the golden fortress of Lafka, are emboldened by a boon of invin- cibility granted by Brahma and begin to oppress both brah- mans and gods. Visnu agrees to rid the world of this scourge. Taking Garuda, the king of the birds, as his mount, he flies toward Mali and Sumali, foremost among the rdksasas. Mali lands a tremendous mace blow on Garuda, who veers away in pain. At the sight of this apparent victory the other rdksasas raise a great cry, but Visnu hurls his discus, which, as the Per- sian text relates, blazes like the fire of the apocalypse, and severs the head of the impudent rdksasa. Yuisuf'Ali follows exactly both the text and the double- page Jaipur composition (nos. I54-55) to depict Mali beheaded by Visnu, who is seated placidly astride Garuda. Visnu's fiery weapon is typically shown twice: once on the god's finger to identify its source, and again below Mali's head to indicate it as the agent of death. The artist pays less attention to fundamental Hindu iconography here than he does in his illustration of Siva on folio 259a (fig. I34), care- lessly endowing Visnu with a fair complexion instead of his canonical blue color. He is content to render Garuda as a standard Persian simurgh, the familiar ornithoid head and body and three long streamers quite unlike the more massive anthropomorphic body of the imperial illustration. Once again, Yusuf'Ali scatters his forms evenly around the painting. He also repeats from his work on folio 259a the splayed form of the small cluster of rocks, the pattern of faint, I43.

Shastri 3: 4o10 Text: Unruled diagonal passages on the preceding folio; 2 1/4 11. above; 3 11. below Published: Bhaktipada, p. 314 (detail) (fig. i44) The rdksasas abandon Laika upon their defeat by Visnu, who, the sages knowingly assert, is one and the same as Rama. Sumali urges his daughter to offer herself to the pow- erful Visravas, but she transgresses by approaching him dur- ing his devotions and is cursed to have all but the last of her offspring be of evil nature. She gives birth to Ravana, Kum- bhakarna, kirpanakha, and Vibhisana. After performing great austerities, each of the three sons receives a boon; Ravana is given the ability to change his form at will and im- mortality before any being above the class of mortal men, whom he considered too insignificant to fear, and Vibhisana is granted eternal virtue and knowledge of the Brahma weapon. When it comes to Kumbhakarna's turn, however, the gods conspire to prevent this mighty and voracious crea- ture from accruing still more power, and ask the goddess Saraswati to enter his mouth and speak for him. This she does, blurting out a request for the boon of interminable sleep. A perplexed but already sleepy Kumbhakarna asks Ravana to build him a place where he can rest in peace. Ravana orders a mansion so enormous that it resembles a cave in Mt. Meru, and so lavishly adorned that its columns are made of gold and crystal, its gates fashioned from elephant tusks, and its ceilings and floors covered with jewels. Qasim incorporates little of this rich textual descrip- tion into the painting; indeed, only the animal-headed capi- tal and base of the column distinguish the dwelling from others in the painting cycle. The plain wall and floor are reg- ular features of architectural representations in the manu- script, as are the tiled courtyard and outer wall. The neglect of textual specifications also occurs in the Jaipur scene (no. I56), though the interior of the earlier painting is consider- ably more sumptuous. ? 2 : '.-... . .

I7; Bhaktipada, p. 246 (detail) (fig. I45) Ravana's evil nature manifests itself in a series of wicked ac- tions, which come to the attention of his brother Kuvera, the god of wealth and the leader of the yaksas, a class of super- natural beings. Kuvera sends a messenger to Ravana to warn him to cease this outrageous behavior. An irate Ravana kills the messenger, vows to conquer the three worlds, and launches an attack on the yaksas. He employs his ability to change form to defeat Kuvera, whose senseless body is car- ried from the battlefield. The triumphant Ravana seizes as a trophy Kuvera's aerial chariot Puspaka. The text immedi- ately below the painting relates how Puspaka suddenly halts on a mountain top and cannot be moved. Ravana impatiently tries to shake the mountain loose, but Siva, the lord of Mt. Kailasa, easily suppresses the trifling challenge with the mere touch of his toe. The designer of the manuscript has manipulated the writing of the text so that the artist misses the opportunity to illustrate Ravana shaking Mt. Kailasa, a scene often repre- sented in Indian sculpture. Instead, both the text and the Jaipur example (no. 157) strongly suggest that Qasim depict the magnificent Puspaka. Described on the reverse of the folio as a traveling litter adorned with gold, emeralds, and pearls, the chariot is represented as a wheeled vehicle topped with a heart-shaped finial and festooned with yaktails. The tilted and earth-bound Puspaka is flanked by an orange raiksasa and a tall tree on a small-lobed outcrop. The flat blue sky blends into the irregular, washy divisions of the green field so that the horizon is surprisingly ill-defined. Save for I45.

Shastri: 3: 484-85 Text: ii lines above (fig. 146) Many of the following encounters belong to two apocryphal series in the Rdmdyana which elaborate Ravana's prowess, describe the various boons and curses laid upon him, and constantly foretell his defeat by Rama, a human incarnation of Visnu to be born to Dasaratha. The bellicose Ravana roams the universe, eager to demonstrate his mastery over the three worlds. He arrives at the Narmada River, and takes delight in bathing in its pure waters. Ever eager for a fight, however, he creates such turmoil that the Haiyaya king Arjuna, who is also enjoying the water with his consorts, is compelled to hasten into combat. The two adversaries assail each other with incessant mace blows. Finally Arjuna smashes Ravana's chest with his mace. Ravana's boon spares his life and causes the mace to break into two, but he is still knocked back a bow's length and falls senseless. Arjuna rushes in to snatch up Ravana in his thousand arms. At Ravana's capture the heavens resound with shouts of approbation. Fazl plants Arjuna's mace directly on Ravana's chest, and suggests the impact of its blow by pushing Ravana into the very corner of composition, even forcing some of his heads slightly beyond the edge of the painting. For once Ravana's opponent obviously has the upper hand, as the tow- ering Arjuna extends his myriad arms in a flurry of left jabs which any boxer would envy. The painting's remarkable economy and dynamic figural arrangement make this one of Fazl's finest illustra- tions in the manuscript. Constrained by the large text panel, the landscape is less spectacular than we have come to expect from this artist, though the sharp junction of the flat green ground and the contorted outcrop in the upper left are very typical of his work. Fazl's draftsmanship has become quite accomplished here, and his treatment of Arjuna's handlebar mustache and narrow eye shows close connections to his figures in the 1616-I7 Razmndma.

Kamal isolates the pitiful Ravana in a rela- tively subdued landscape of broad ridges and sparse vegeta- tion. The river in the foreground evokes the southern sea near Vali's domain. I47.

Their seven-day battle reaches a climax when Mrtyu, ; w Death itself, asks Yama permission to cast her bright glance -- on Ravana, an action which will result in certain death for the raksasa. Then Yama, eyes red with rage, advances to smite "" Ravana with his flaming rod of death. Brahma entreats Yama ' ... not to use the weapon, which will nullify his boon of invul- nerability to Ravana and thus make him untruthful. The de- struction of the entire universe is averted as Yama acquiesces to this request and withdraws from the field, leaving Ravana the apparent victor. Syama Sundara's scene of individual combat is far less informative and tumultuous than the Jaipur version (no. I60), which explicitly represents Brahma's intercession on Ravana's behalf amid the furor of battle. Yama is depicted as a demon endowed with huge fan-shaped ears flaring out over his wings and dressed in leg-guards, a tunic, and short .- ' trousers modeled in the European manner. He casts a pierc- ing sidelong glance in our direction as he advances toward Ravana, one hand holding the saw-toothed rod of death bent menacingly forward, and the other clutching a bundle of cloth, perhaps an awkwardly rendered noose of death. Ravana wields an array of more standard weapons in his six- teen hands. Both figures spill over the painting's gold ruling. A modest landscape fills the rest of the composition. Two outcrops bracket the pair of demons watching the en- gagement, and a series of three arching hills forms the high horizon. gyama cautiously leaves an unpainted patch around the folio and painting numbers above the text panel. 148.

By according Ravana the central position and more specific and numerous attributes, Syama makes Ravana the more prominent figure - a misdi- rected reversal of the roles the figures enjoy in both the text and the Jaipur illustration (no. i6i). Similarly, he forgoes the splendor of Vali's palace in theJaipur miniature and presents an impoverished setting, whose plain walls and ground are relieved only by a rickety golden kiosk. 149.

Shastri 3: 474 Text: Unruled diagonal passages on the reverse of the folio; 3/4 line above; 411. below Indra labelled (fig. I50) Ravana now tries to assert his mastery over the celestial abode. The battle between legions of gods and rdksasas cul- minates, as these struggles always do, in the personal duel of their leaders, Indra and Ravana. Knowing that Ravana can- not be killed, Indra aims to capture his opponent. Rivana unwittingly helps this plan as he drives alone through the celestial ranks, sowing death from one end to the other. Indra cuts Rivana off from his troops and quickly takes him pris- oner. Then Ravana's son Indrajita, employing sorcery to make himself invisible, assails the weary Indra, and binds him in turn. Indrajita releases his father and persuades him that they have humbled their opponents and can now with- draw. Although the scribe abbreviated the text in the upper panel and wrote much of the text on the reverse of the folio in space-consuming oblique lines so that the painting would fall immediately after Indrajita's vow to overcome Indra, the artist has decided to illustrate an earlier moment in the story: the rdksasas' retreat at the sight of the bound Ravana. Fazl includes Indra advancing on the white elephant Airivata, a detail recounted in the lower text panel, which normally does not affect the subject of the illustration. This kind of narrative illustration, which might be called essential rather than literal, typically introduces the major figures in their most characteristic actions and guises even if they appear at slightly different points in the story. By omitting Indrajita, who rescues Ravana and dominates one half of the double- page Jaipur composition (nos. I62-63), the artist maintains the emphasis placed on Ravana's humiliation throughout this series of paintings and reinforces the idea of his in- evitable defeat by Rama. Faizl's hand is particularly evident in the flat grey sky and the sharp division between the pink rocks and dark green ground. He retains the small figure scale seen on folio 285a (fig. I42). 150.

Shastri 3: 455-56 Text: ii lines above Kapila Bhagavata (Visnu) written on the cover sheet (fig. I52) Ravana gets up and follows Mahajambunada, who has disap- peared into the depths of the earth. There Ravana is aston- ished to see 300,000 dancing creatures exactly like Maha- jambunada. He retreats from the cave, but now finds Mahajambunada outside seated on a high bedstead covered with white cloth and surrounded by a ring of fire. Attending this radiant figure is a beautiful woman dressed in fine cloth- ing and garlanded with flowers. Ravana's covetous feelings for this woman, who is none other than the goddess Laksmi, amuse Mahajambunada, whose mere laugh flattens Ravana once more. Ravana asks Mahijambunada, "Who are you, that you seem like the fire at the end of time?" Mahajam- bunada answers, "What will you gain by questioning me? Your end is near!" Suddenly the whole universe appears within Mahajambunada's body, with the gods, celestial be- ings, and planets all encompassed within his limbs. The illustration of Ravana's encounter with Mahajam- bunada continues with Kamal's painting of Mahajambunada conversing amiably with Ravana, a scene which is formally unrelated to the work on the opposite page. Kamal does not realize the visionary quality conveyed in the textual passages immediately above the painting field. Rather than conjuring up the three worlds revealed within the deity's body, as Basa- vana does in his literal and ambitious scene in the Jaipur manuscript (no. i65), Kamal portrays a golden-skinned as- cetic, and selects from the very specific textual description of the god only the details of the white dais ringed by fire, the flowers about the figure's head, and the presence of Laksmi.20 Mahajambunada's identity as Kapila, an incarnation of Visnu, was understood with far more certainty by the anno- tator of the manuscript, whose label to this effect is copied on the cover sheet. The light palette of the sky and landscape is similar to that of the previous painting, but the composition is far more rigidly divided. The yellow area behind Ravana's head di- rectly abuts a heavily modeled, cavernous mountain, from which springs a rounded hill with even notches and repeti- tive trees. Kamal's inclination to outline some forms is par- ticularly apparent in Ravana's legs, which are curiously set off from his clothing and boots. 152.

Shastri 3: 493 Text: Unruled diagonal passages on the preceding folio; I/4 line above; 5 11. below Published: Bhaktipada, p. 228 (detail) (fig. 153) Rama now asks the sage Agastya to compare the prowess of Vali and Ravana to that of Hanuman, foremost of the mon- keys and the son of Vayu, god of the wind. One day, while his mother is gone to fetch some food, the hungry infant Hanuman sees the rising sun, and perceiving it to be a morsel of food, rises rapidly in the air to snatch it. He crosses paths with Rahu, the demon of the eclipse, to whom the sun right- fully belongs periodically. Rahu protests to Indra, who mounts his elephant Airavata and accompanies the demon to the vicinity of the sun. The precocious Hanuman compounds his mistake by taking Rahu and Airavata to be still other pieces of fruit. Indra answers their pleas for help by hurling a thunderbolt at the young monkey, which causes Hanuman to fall and break his jaw. Brahma restores the precocious Hanuman to health, and the other gods grant him great pow- ers as boons. So reduced in detail is this illustration by Yusuf 'All that neither the cause nor the agent of Hanuman's precipi- tous fall is indicated; in fact, the composition makes Hanu- man's plunge seem related more to the nearby demon than to Indra, who traverses the upper reaches of the landscape on his white elephant mount. As in most representations of this god in the manuscript, Indra is depicted without his mark- ings of a thousand eyes, an attribute included in the Jaipur illustration (no. I66), which also adds the sun and clouds to signal the celestial arena of combat. Yuisuf 'Ali allows the beast-headed Rahu to be strangely disjointed by the lower text panel. The forms of the landscape are entirely in keeping with Yusuf 'All's earlier work in the manuscript, particularly his painting on folio 253b (fig. I3I). The plain field is divided 153.

Shastri 3: 502 Text: 5 11. above; 2 11. below Published: Bhaktipada, p. 204 (detail); Seyller, "A Sub- imperial Mughal Manuscript," fig. 9 (fig. I54) Having learned about Hanuman's youth, Rama now asks about the curious parentage of Vali and Sugriva. Agastya re- lates that the monkey Rksaraja, who himself was born from a few of Brahma's tears, chances upon a magical lake near Mt. Meru. Suspecting that an evil creature dwells in its waters, Rksaraja dives into the lake. He finds nothing and quickly reemerges, but is shocked to find himself transformed into a comely woman. No sooner has Rksaraja assumed this ap- pearance than two gods, Indra and Siurya, pass overhead. Indra and Surya are so bewitched by the beauty of the sur- prised woman that they cannot contain their lust, and their semen falls upon Rksaraja's hair and neck, begetting two sons, named Vali and Sugriva respectively. The next morn- ing Rksaraja returns to male form, and begins to raise those two illustrious monkeys to whom he is both father and mother. The transformed Rksaraja, who wears a transparent odhaniwith tassels, looks up with some bewilderment at the pair who have impregnated her in this unorthodox fashion: Indra, shown here as a crowned and eye-spotted deity seated on a floral throne, and the sun god Sturya, depicted as a human-faced solar sphere. The woman's rounded forehead and pupil set at the top of her almond-shaped eye are charac- teristic of many of Qasim's figures. Qasim continues his propensity to sign many of his works, this time on the rock to the right of the waterfall. Qasim's personal style is readily discerned in the handling of the braided rocks along the horizon, the bright yellow growth around each of the lobes of the tree to Rksaraja's left, and the presence of aquatic fowl in the rippled water in the foreground. These elements are constant features of the artist's work in the I6I6-17 Razmndma. ? !!~i!~i~!117!5... ...... . ..'" r-? " '''. * {:'** r"r l:Lt ........ ...

The two women depicted in three-quarter view are so graceful in both face and body that they could easily stand in for their counterparts in the Jaipur illustration or other con- temporary imperial paintings. Once again Yusuf 'All em- ploys a small figure scale, allowing the five figures to occupy relatively little of the painting field, which does not extend above the text panel.

Shastri 3: 535 Text: 7 11. above; i line below Dasaratha labelled (fig. I56) After a long digression on the early exploits of many an ally and foe, the Rdmayana resumes the tale of Rama after his great victory. Sita now carries Rama's child in her womb, and all who live under Rama's rule enjoy similar bliss and pros- perity. Nonetheless, Rama is eager to redress whatever wrongs may exist in the kingdom, and he asks a group of sages to tell him everything - good and bad - which his sub- jects say about him. The sages reluctantly inform him that some people still harbor doubts about Sita's chastity during her captivity. Devastated by this rumor, which Sita's fire or- deal should have laid to rest, Rama decides to renounce Sita. With the pretext of abiding Sita's desire to visit some as- cetics, he asks Laksmana to escort Sita to a hermitage on the banks of the Ganges, but to abandon her there forever. Al- though Laksmana is sworn to secrecy, he cannot hide his ag- itation. Sita becomes disconsolate when she learns of Rama's decision, but selflessly professes her complete devotion to her husband, and places herself under the protection of the sage Valmiki. During his return journey, Laksmana asks the chario- teer Sumantra how Rama could possibly repudiate one so blameless. Sumantra replies that Dasaratha once confided to him that this bitter fate was foretold to him by the ascetic Durvasas upon a visit to Vasistha's hermitage. Durvasas said the wife of the sage Bhrgu once gave shelter to a group of demons; Visnu himself erupted in anger at this action, and slew her immediately with his discus. Bhrgu hastily cursed Visnu for his action, and vowed that a similar separation from his spouse would befall him in his incarnation as man, that is, as Rama. Sumantra concludes with the happier prophecy of Rama's long reign and the successful perpetua- tion of his lineage. The Jaipur manuscript determines Dasaratha's audi- ence with Durvasas as the most appropriate subject of this encapsulated story, probably because it is easily adapted to a favorite type of scene in Mughal painting: a king seeking the I56. Ramdyana, Freer Gallery of Art, f. 324b. 239</page><page sequence="237">advice of sages. Its illustration (no. I69) displays that manu- script's penchant for pictorial elaboration in its representa- tion of the vessels of food and water described in the text, the king's large retinue, a perspectival view of the dais, and an elaborate natural setting. The Freer manuscript follows the Jaipur choice of sub- ject, and also shows Dasaratha lifting his hands in supplica- tion to ask Durvasas about the fate of his lineage. One leg crossed awkwardly over the other, the emaciated Durvasas raises his right hand in a gesture of exposition. The patterned ochre mat that links Dasaratha, Durvasas, and Vasistha forms the first of three distinct registers in the composition. The brick wall and gate in the foreground constitute another register and provide a solid base to this tightly structured composition, but seem incongruous in the hermitage's rural setting, which is indicated by the tall banyan tree and the bright green hills. In addition to general similarities in composition and figure style, specific features such as the patterns of the side of the purple dais and the detailing of the ridges recall Qasim's paintings on folios 237b and 295a and thus suggest an attribution of this painting to this artist. Moreover, faint fragments of three letters of Qasim's name can be seen in the lower margin. 332a Satrughna slays Lavana Artist: Attributed to Qasim 25.9 X I3.7 cm. Shastri 3: 572-74 Text: 9 11. above (fig. 157) A group of brahmans beseech Rama to deliver them from the scourge of Lavana, a rdksasa who had inherited from his fa- ther Madhu an irresistible trident granted by Siva. Rama's brother Satrughna volunteers to slay this evil creature as a test of his courage. Rama outfits him with an equally potent arrow, nothing less than a form of Visnu himself, and advises him that he must catch Lavana without his weapon. Know- ing that Lavana leaves his supernatural weapon at home while he gathers food, Satrughna waits until Lavana has de- parted for the day, bars the gate to the city, and then goads Lavana into battle by loudly proclaiming his imminent death. Deprived of his weapon, Lavana hurls one tree after another at his foe, but Satrughna consumes each one with a fiery arrow. Lavana finally knocks Satrughna senseless with a blow to the head, but foolishly does not use the opportunity to retrieve his trident. Satrughna soon recovers, and while the gods quake in fear, fits his celestial arrow to the bow, and looses that blazing weapon at the raksasa's breast. Qasim diminishes Satrughna's spectacular conquest of Lavana with a formulaic scene of combat, in which yet an- other hero sends a raksasa groveling in the throes of death. The fiery effect of the weapon, which is represented bril- liantly in the Jaipur painting (no. 170), is entirely ignored here. Qasim establishes Satrughna's family resemblance to Rama in the upturned mustache and long sideburn, which he repeated from his figure of Rama on folio 237b (fig. 123). The landscape is divided harshly into a tufted green zone below and a braided yellow hill above. The pink outcrop in the upper left is identical to one on folio 237b. The rocks along the riverbank recall those of Qasim's painting on folio 317b in their blocky, layered facets and radiating leaves. 157.

Shastri 3: 583-84 Text 4 3/4 11. above; 3 11. below (fig. I58) An old brahman who grieves the loss of his fourteen-year-old son sits outside Rama's palace and loudly accuses the king of committing some injustice, reasoning that only under an un- righteous ruler do people die prematurely. Rama's ministers agree with the basic premise of this complaint, and urge him to locate the source of the unrighteous behavior. They sug- gest an answer with a review of the practice of asceticism dur- ing each of the four yugas or epochs. During the Krta Yuga, when all was good, the right to undertake austerities was re- served for brahmans alone; in subsequent yugas, the right was gradually extended to the other castes, with the result that the balance between good and evil tipped ever more toward the latter. gzidras, members of the lowest of the four major castes, are allowed to do this kind of empowering penance only in the Kali Yuga, when the reign of evil is total. At all other times, including the present, the Dvarapa Yuga, it is a great sin for szidras to practice asceticism. Having searched the four quarters of the world, Rama arrives at a great lake in the southern quarter, and there dis- covers an ascetic undergoing the formidable austerity of hanging upside down for long periods of time. He asks him, "Which of the four castes are you - brahman, or ksatriya, or vaisya, or sudra - that you are worshipping so?" The ascetic answers, "My name is Sambuka and I was born of the sidra caste. By this sacrifice I will become a god." Rama immedi- ately draws his sword and cuts off the sfidra's head. Relieved that this unworthy one will not forcibly gain admittance to heaven and thus disrupt the natural order, the gods strew flowers on Rama's head and restore the old brahman's son to life. Syama Sundara's illustration has disengaged Rama from the dynamic execution in the Jaipur scene (no. 171), and has relegated him instead to the role of one who merely wit- nesses (albeit with sword in hand) the beheaded sfidra dan- gling from a crossbar attached to the upper text panel. The work also exemplifies the consistent formal simplification of the Freer paintings. The rigidly bent arms and legs of the suspended sidra contrast with the fleshiness and weight of his counterpart in the Jaipur painting. Similarly, the rich and varied landscape of the Jaipur illustration is reduced to a flat green field, which is separated from the lake in the fore- ground by an extremely schematic bank. The number IOI3 appears in the lower margin to the right of a faint ascription to Syima. Given the sequence of dates on folios 92a, I22b, I97b, 237b, and 244a, this number may be taken as a date corresponding to A.D. I604-05. The position of this date near the end of the painting cycle is strong evidence that the manuscript was completed in that year. 158.

If my words are true, may the earth open up so that I may enter it." At this, the earth cracks open and a throne borne on the heads of snakes issues forth. The beautiful woman seated thereon takes Sita to her side and descends into the earth. The gods scatter flowers and shout their approval. Fazl shows Sita welcomed by the small figure of the goddess Madhavi, who emerges from the ground on a throne. Sita raises her hands together in adoration, while the on- lookers express their amazement at the divine reception. The illustration is fundamentally similar in composition to the Jaipur scene (no. I74), but in presenting the moment before Sita takes her place on Madhavi's throne and descends into the earth, it follows the narrative development of neither the earlier pictorial version nor the text above, which concludes with the joint disappearance of Madhavi and Sita.2I Con- comitant with this static formulation of the narrative is a general impoverishment of visual detail. The goddess's throne is not borne by a swarm of rearing snakes, as in the Jaipur painting, but shows only two tiny serpents attached to its sides. Similarly, the narrow gold sky leaves no room for gods to scatter flowers, and the consternation of the earthly witnesses is greatly diminished. This painting closely resembles the audience scene by Fazl on folio 285a (fig. I42) in composition, throne type, and palette. The clearest examples of the last of these are the flat grey and dark blue bands of the dais. The attribution to Fazl i6i. Rdmayana, Freer Gallery of Art, f. 34ib. is supported by the back view of the small figure in the lower- most cluster of figures.

Unlike the more populous and expansive double-page illustration of this episode in the Jaipur manuscript (nos. I75-76), Qasim's scene does not set i i Rama apart from his brothers and subjects, who do not suf- fer the grief that afflicts many of their Jaipur counterparts. The artist's visual inexplicitness continues with the absence of the waters of the Sarayu River and the clouds above; in- deed, we can identify this scene as Rama's ascension only by referring to the written narrative or by assuming this subject from the position of the painting at the very end of the manu- script. Several details suggest an attribution of this final paint- ing to Qasim. Rama's face and dress are exceedingly close to Qasim's figure of Rama on folio 244a (fig. 127). The stepped narrow lobes of the prominent pink outcrop behind Rama are also reminiscent of similar forms on folios 22ob and 237b. I62.

Their subjects demonstrate that 'Abd al- Rahim continued his exceptional cultivation of Indian literature even as he pursued a more traditional interest in Persian classics. Some manuscripts are easily recognized as products of the workshop by their roster of artists and con- tinuity of style; others bear inscriptions in the Khankhanan's own hand or as- criptions to many of his artists, but depart quite substantively in appearance from the Ramdyana. Together these ascribed and dated manuscripts help us to understand how 'Abd al-Rahim's atelier varied its work from project to pro- ject. This variety appears to be linked both to the type of text to be illustrated and to the peculiar circumstances under which some of the manuscripts were produced. For two manuscripts whose subjects are rooted in indigenous In- dian culture, 'Abd al-Rahim's workshop maintained the painting style used in most Ramaya.na illustrations. For their illustrations of works of Persian history and poetry, however, these same artists gravitated toward a much more Per- sianate mode. As we will see, this choice of style was quite deliberate, and be- came increasingly pronounced over time. Unlike the Freer Rdmayana, four of the five manuscripts discussed below were not originally prepared for 'Abd al-Rahim. Instead, his atelier acquired incomplete or damaged illustrated manuscripts of the fifteenth and early-six- teenth centuries and extensively refurbished them with paintings and illumi- nations. In one case, the Khankhanan's workshop restored a fragmentary man- uscript by having a scribe write out the missing sections of the text, which were then duly provided with new illustrations. The members of the workshop did not stop there, however, but went on to add an entirely new layer of paint- ings over the existing illustrations. In another manuscript, they again fur- nished replacement folios where the manuscript was deficient, supplied an appropriate number of illustrations, and added brilliant decorative designs to the manuscript's borders. Both examples demonstrate the patron's willingness to collect and re- store imperfect manuscripts. In light of the abundant sums of money 'Abd al- Rahim lavished on books and those who earned his favor, this approach to books hardly seems to have been driven by a sense of frugality. Nor, given the radical alterations he ordered made to these books, does it appear to be an ex- pression of antiquarian interest in the relics of the past. Instead, 'Abd al- Rahim's actions bespeak a kind of reverence for books as living repositories of 251</page><page sequence="248">knowledge and beauty, as thoughts and objects to be renewed again and again by those attuned to their virtues. The i6i6-i7 Razmnama The legacy of the Freer Ramaiyana is seen most clearly in the paintings of a dis- persed Razmnama manuscript produced for 'Abd al-Rahim. Like the Rdmayana, the I616-17 Razmnama (Book of Wars) is inspired by the imperial manuscript of a Persian translation of another great Hindu epic, the Maha- bharata. The Persian texts of the imperial Razmnama manuscript and 'Abd al- Rahim's copy are more similar than those of the contemporary copies of the Ramayana, but their painting cycles diverge less frequently.' The I616-I7 Razmnama also contains a large number of illustrations, whose dispersal at auc- tion to museums and collectors since the late 195os has given them a renown second only to the Freer manuscript itself.2 My earlier reconstruction of the manuscript lists sixty-eight paintings, some of which are fragmentary.3 Most of the extant illustrations belong to the Asvamedhika Parva, a chapter which describes the events leading up to the sacrifice of the white horse. If the illus- tration of the other seventeenparvas (chapters) of the Razmnaima proves in time to match the rate of the Asvamedhika Parva, the total number of illustrations in the Razmnama may increase substantially, perhaps to nearly as many as the I69 illustrations of the original imperial manuscript. The paintings of the dispersed I616-I7 Razmnama have the largest dimensions of any manuscript produced in 'Abd al-Rahim's atelier. Many il- lustrations are wrapped around sizable panels of text on the folio, a layout found in some paintings in the Freer Ramayana and most imperial Mughal manuscripts of the i58os. Unaware of the value of the text in this format, a few unscrupulous dealers mutilated some illustrated folios by cutting away their text panels and replacing them with painting fragments from other illustra- tions. Such modern artistic cannibalism has precluded the identification of several Razmnama pages and has produced a few disjointed composite images. Although the bulk of the manuscript has been lost, the manuscript is se- curely dated by two paintings which bear dates on their painting fields. The first painting, dated I025/1616, is by 'Abdullah, an artist whose work in 'Abd al-Rahim's workshop is otherwise undocumented.4 'Abdullah typically applies paint in such a way that his forms, and particularly his faces, are noticeably murky. His rocks are no less idiosyncratic, with small and heavily articulated striations creating the effect of lithic honeycombs. These distinc- tive features allow us to identify 'Abdullah with an artist by the same name active in the imperial workshop from about I585 to I590, thus adding him to the growing ranks of imperial painters who found a new patron in the Khankhanan.5 A second Razmnama painting, ascribed to Mushfiq, is dated I026/I617 (fig. I63). A comparison of Mushfiq's only ascribed work in the Razmnama to his two illustrations in the Ramayana (figs. 40, 57) begins to demonstrate the ways in which 'Abd al-Rahim's artists modified their work in 252</page><page sequence="249">4~~~~~~~??l.

' x 20.9 cm. the ten years that separated the two projects, which are similar in subject and scope. Mushfiq exploits the expansiveness of a painting field uninterrupted by text by reducing the large figure scale of his earlier efforts. This smaller figure scale is well suited to the subject of this particular painting, legions of soldiers on the march, but it also represents a general movement away from the Rdmdyana's predilection for a few visually aggrandized heroes. No one figure dominates the illustration; even the horseman in the center, whose position and relative isolation accord him a natural prominence, does not rise above his companions in size or detail. Moreover, like many other artists in the work- shop, Mushfiq displays a willingness to present elaborate clusters of overlap- ping forms, such as the two vertical series of elephants on the right or the rank of horsemen lining the left edge of the composition, avoiding even a hint of repetitiveness by spurring the mahouts and others into more animated ges- tures and expressions. As with some examples in the Rdmdyazna, the price of this greater number of figures is the loss of some precision in the draftsman- ship. The landscape suffers no such decline. Here, for example, the stepped pink ridge descending across the center of the composition propels the troops forward; the rippled ridges and soaring outcrops in the upper section strike a complicated balance in both shape and color. Other artists follow the example of Mushfiq. Indeed, we will find that together with the widespread reduction in figure scale, the multiplication of landscape elements and their greater in- teraction with the figures are two of the most pronounced developments in the Razmndma. Yusuf 'All, a major contributor to the last third of the Rdmayana project, is also known by a single ascribed work in the Razmndma, though at least one other painting can now be attributed to him.6 His illustration of Draupadi and her attendants (fig. I64) retains the gridlike organization of his courtyard scenes in the Rdmdyana (ff. 245b, 283a, and 339b) and demonstrates again his habit of scattering figures evenly across the composition. Yusuf 'All alters his own depiction of women in two ways. He substitutes a strict profile view for the three-quarter view favored in his Rdimdyana paintings (ff. 277a, 283a, and 319a) for all but one attendant. Concomitant with this is a subtle change in the women's coiffure, which now sports a noticeably higher hairline. Though these changes are relatively minor within Yusuf 'All's oeuvre, they exemplify the increasingly widespread adoption of the profile view in many different strains of Popular Mughal painting. Yusuf 'All's work continues to display a strong resemblance to some aspects of Fazl's work. The two women to the left, for example, exhibit the squarish brow and jutting jaw seen in many of Fazl's figures, but their angular physiognomy is slightly softened and the eyes are more finely drawn. Yusuf 'All's interest in spatial variety is strained here as the attendant carrying wine flasks twists his head about in owlish fashion.7 253</page><page sequence="250">?ir;t ;jC Als^^^4i#L..$ , . ..: ..':,c.~.~, . # '.'T ". k;32Set:t5#.:"i.~"', '.,- A,&lt; i65.

Although the imprint of Fazl's work is most pronounced in the paintings of Yusuf 'All and Kala Pahara in the Ramayana, it is found throughout the entire Razmndma. Fazl's twenty ascribed and attributed paintings not only constitute the lion's share of the manuscript's illustrations, they also seem to represent the core of the stylistic mode employed by the atelier for this project. Indeed, the Razmndma illustrations are so homogeneous in style that although one can distinguish Fazl's work from that of any other artist without much trouble, it is surprisingly difficult to attribute the remainder of the paintings to any artist in particular. Such attributions rest heavily on subtle facial de- tails, a few minor landscape elements, and cues from fragmentary ascriptions. Before taking up the questions of why this mode was selected and how the ate- lier coalesced around it, let us look at a few of Fazl's paintings. Fazl's illustrations in the Razmnama display the same increase in overall complexity that marks the works of all artists who contributed to both the Ramayana and the Razmndma. In his illustration of the Pandavas submitting to a fiery weapon loosed by Asvatthama, Fazl abandons the abrupt, bipartite division of the landscape common in the Ramayana for a busy patchwork of violet and purple zones (fig. I65). He imposes a dynamic rhythm on these areas by alternating both their color and direction. The three rock screens beside the text panel, for example, tilt in opposite directions. Fazl often used such land- scape divisions to accentuate his figural groups. Here, he isolates the five be- leaguered brothers within one color patch, sequesters the chariot and fore- ground figures within another, and frames the two most prominent horsemen on the right with a third. Apart from Fazl's irrepressible boldness in the use of color and certain landscape forms, the integration of figure and landscape that we see in this work is quite reminiscent of G6vardhana's painting on folio 27b in the Ramayana. Thus Fazl and the majority of artists in 'Abd al-Rahim's ate- lier began to approach the average composition of the imperial style of the early i58os almost twenty years after G6vardhana had first approximated it in the Ramayana. The difference in the time lag underscores the likelihood of Govardhana's training in the imperial atelier and the ever-widening gap be- tween contemporary imperial painting and its subimperial counterpart. Fazl's figure style changed less dramatically over time. An illustration such as Bhima defeating Duryodhana demonstrates something of his range of characters (fig. i66). The two antagonists are typical of his large, burly figures, who are usually shown with remarkably thickset thighs. As is often his habit, Fazl juxtaposes these impressive physical specimens against figures of much smaller scale and more ordinary proportions, even to the degree of the minus- cule mahout and groom in the lower left. Like YTisuf'Ali, Fazl preferred to set his figures in profile, a view which he flipped back and forth to add variety to his figures. The intensely narrowed eyes, strong noses, flaring mustaches, and grimacing mouths of his men contrast markedly with the more relaxed, rounded features of the figures of Qasim and Kamal. 255</page><page sequence="252">These two paintings, which are certainly among Fazl's finest efforts in the manuscript, testify to a great improvement in his draftsmanship, a develop- ment which he shares with most of his colleagues. Fazl eliminated from most of his later works much of the awkwardness of draftsmanship that appears in paintings such as folio I2za of the Raimayaona. Nonetheless, more than any other artist in the workshop, Fazl continued to produce paintings of jarring rudi- mentariness. This seems to occur when he opted for a severe reduction in the figure scale, as he did in his illustration of the discovery of the white horse stuck in the Vindhya mountains (fig. I67).8 With the painting field limited to two narrow strips around the perimeter of the folio, Fazl dashes off a row of figures whose tiny bodies are overwhelmed by their darkly rendered beards and hair. He uses an equally abrupt manner for the three-tiered landscape, piling up in one precipitous stack a schematic rock pedestal, a dark brown square be- hind the white horse, and an outcrop with jumbled lobes. So much less ac- complished is this painting than the two earlier examples (figs. I65-66) that were it not for the ascription, we might readily doubt that they were produced by the same artist for the same manuscript. That this unevenness in quality appears within Fazl's work in the Razmnama should caution us against hold- ing other artists in the Rdmayana to too stringent a standard of uniformity in style.9 The great fluctuations of quality in Fazl's work are not found in the paint- ings of Qasim and Kamal, two more artists who participated in the illustra- tion of both the Rdmayana and Razmnama manuscripts. The apparent qualita- tive consistency of their illustrations may be due in part to their more limited body of work, but it may also owe something to the original assignment of illustrations in the project. Fazl's predicament in the Razmnama might well have been the same as Syama's in the Rdmdyana, that is, the number of works assigned to him became too burdensome for him to produce an inspired or even careful painting at every turn. Such was not the case with either Qasim or Kamal, both of whom quickly shed any trace of the youthful tentativeness evident early in the Ramdyana (ff. 72a and 95a respectively); thereafter, they maintained in their relatively modest numbers of works in the Rdmdyana and Razmndma a common style which they seem to have developed and shared by I603-04, the date written on Qasim's painting on folio 244a of the Ramayana (fig. I127). Many features of this style appear in Qasim's Razmnama illustration of the meeting between the brahman Uttafka and Indra, who has assumed the guise of an outcaste (fig. I68). Qasim allows the figures to fill most of the space between the text panels, a choice in keeping with his preference for a relatively large figure scale. The figures themselves show little change from their coun- I67. (opposite, top) The Pandavas discover the white horse. By Fizl. I6I6-I7 Razmnama.

Although the individual components remain the same, the use of more subtle transitions between discrete zones of color lends Qasim's landscape a new coherence, an effect seen earlier in the works of Mushfiq and Fazl. The stylistic homogeneity of these examples suggests that while all of 'Abd al-Rahim's artists retained some of their individual idiosyncrasies in figure type and landscape motifs, they also began to coalesce around a common style which several of them shared by the end of the Rdmayana project. By the time of the Razmndma, this group style was no longer a mere aggregate of sep- arate personal styles, which were conditioned in part by an individual artist's degree of familiarity with the imperial Mughal style. Rather, it represented one major expression of a consensus forged in the painting workshop over years of working together. Like any group style, this particular mode was flexible enough to accommodate minor personal idiosyncracies as well as some natural variations in quality as artists were affected by constraints of time or space im- posed on individual illustrations. At the same time, it clearly did not exhaust the imagination or ability of the same group of artists, who also produced works illustrated in a much different, but no less homogeneous style. The Laud Rdgamdld The slender album known as the Laud Rdgamdld is among the most famous documents of Indian painting.'? The album, which includes eighteen Ragamald paintings as well as a dozen other miniatures and a hundred speci- mens of calligraphy, was presented by Archbishop Laud of Canterbury to the Bodleian Library in I640. It is a curious accident of history that the earliest known Indian manuscript to enter a European collection was neither an ex- ample of painting from the imperial court, which a number of Europeans had visited as ambassadors or missionaries, nor an illustration of one of India's many important religious, historical, or literary texts. Paintings of the Ragamdld (literally, garland of rdgas, or musical modes) are not illustrations in the usual sense of the word, but belong to an ancient Indian tradition in both music and poetry of creating personifications of the six basic melodies or modes of Indian music. Each of these major "male" rdgas is further divided into five minor expressions, deemed its "wives" or rdgimns. These six "families" are usually depicted in a series of thirty-six paintings, which are often accompa- nied by a brief identifying caption or verse. The origin of the iconography of these visual interpretations of musical modes is obscure. From the late-sixteenth century on, rdgas and rdginTs began to be represented by images of worship, seasonal activities, or emotional situ- ations which seemed to correspond in mood. By the mid-seventeenth century, the iconography of Rdgamdld paintings had become relatively fixed, so that very coherent visual traditions were established over large geographical re- gions." Although Akbar had ragas sung at the Mughal court, the Laud Ragamald paintings have no known precedent in imperial Mughal painting. 257 r1 14) &amp; 1 Ob, A-5 _w U,svv ;,'.UlrU.l topj 03 =- wfS?1 i' *E;~~~~~~~~ - TJ'/ft 1 aw---o !. .

Nonetheless, 'Abd al-Rahim was not alone in his cultivation of Rdgamdald painting, for several of the earliest Rdgamald series are also painted in the Popular Mughal style.'2 Unlike the Rdmdyana and the Razmndma, whose association with 'Abd al-Rahim has long been beyond question, the paintings of the Laud Rdgamald album are only now coming to be recognized as a product of the Khankhanan's atelier. The date and provenance of the Laud Rdgamald paintings have been contested since 192I, when two pioneers of the study of Indian painting first E excluded them from the Mughal school, the branch of Indian painting best known in Europe at the time.13 The paintings were once placed as early as I575, i' but now it is generally agreed that they date from the early-seventeenth cen- tury.14 Arguments have been advanced for both a Rajasthani and Deccani | provenance, the latter most fully in the publication of the Rdgamdld series I proper.I5 Since I960, when Popular Mughal art was first defined as a category of Indian painting, the series has generally been recognized as a work attrib- uted to a subimperial patron,I6 with two authors even noting its connection I with works by Fazl.17 Although this controversy may finally have run its course, the various proposals within it point up both the old-fashioned nature of Popular Mughal painting in general and the position of the Laud Rdgamald series at the crossroads of styles in northern India at the beginning of seven- teenth century. The Laud Rdgamald miniatures compare so closely in figure type and set- ting to many of the paintings in the Freer Rdmdyana and the 1616-I7 Razm- ndma that all the paintings of the Rdgamald series proper may be attributed to 'Abd al-Rahim's painting workshop. Fazl clearly assumes a dominant role in the project, whose paintings are extremely consistent in style. In the Hindola (Swing) Rdga, the artist dispenses with the Hindu costume and military apparel used throughout the Razmndma and adopts a Mughal turban and four- pointed jdma for the man perched playfully on the swing (fig. I69). The dark- skinned male has the strong brow and nose, dark hair and sideburns, and flaring mustache characteristic of Fazl's figures. The two females who hasten to his side to flirt with him are less severe in countenance, but share a distinc- tive squarish head shape with a high forehead and slight depression on the crown. The appearance of women with nearly identical features in a Razmnama painting ascribed to Fazl supports an attribution to this artist (fig. I70). This attribution to Fazl is reinforced by still other elements in the Hin- dola Rdga. The conceptual simplicity, flat coloring, and squared-off posts of the neatly outlined swing repeat Fazl's treatment of many a tree.

I7I). The scene of two stiff warriors locked in combat is set against the flat yellow zone that recurs throughout the Ragamdald series. Above this simple area are two angled out- crops, whose lobes Fazl renders in his distinctive manner as concentric rings of wash and line.I9 The unusual spade-shaped top and striped trunk of the palm tree in the upper right also recall Fazl's depictions of such trees in the Razm- nama. 20 A rdgamdld painting which is probably by one of Fazl's fellow painters is the Bhairava Rdga, dedicated to the worship of Siva in the guise of an ascetic (fig. I72). Like most architectural scenes in the Laud Rdgamdld, this composi- tion places the two figures before a white pavilion aligned with the edge of the painting and pressed close to the foreground. The bare-chested ascetic is dis- tinguished from the other male figures in the series and Fazl's figure of Krsna in Figure I70 by the more fully modeled facial features, half-smile, and forward 259 = ;^,^-?

I73).21 That the boxy superstructure and door of the chamber are entirely consistent with Fazl's work in the series underscores the overwhelmingly homogeneity of the Laud Rdgamdld illustrations. Interspersed among the eighteen r,agamald paintings in the sixty-seven folios of the album are twelve paintings of varying size. Their subjects range from isolated figures of women seated on cushions, presenting gifts, or danc- ing, to an imaginative scene of a man borne in a palanquin composed of women.22 All the paintings are executed in the subimperial Mughal style, with many well within the purview of 'Abd al-Rah.im's artists. A painting of a woman holding a vini (fig. 174), for example, is practically an excerpt from Qasim's illustration on folio 346a of the Radmyana (fig. 162), as seen in the strong similarities in body shape, coiffure, and heavily outlined eye. Two im- ages of women with massive shoulders and much more refined features almost certainly issue from the hand of Yusuf'Ali.23 The Laud Rdgamdld Album includes a small portrait of a courtier, who is identified here as Zayn Khan K6ka (fig. I75).24 The profile view, modest degree of individualization, and unarticulated green ground exemplify the conven- tions of portraits produced by the imperial painting workshop in the I58os. As 17I.

Nadim, for example, contributes several illustra- tions to the Berlin Khamsa of Amir Khusraw which contain figures with equally taut facial features and slightly exaggerated rounded contours.25 If this attribution is correct, this painting, which was probably made about the time of the subject's death in I6oo, would be the only known portrait by 'Abd al- Rahim's artists. The association of the Laud Rdgamald Album with the Khankhanan's atelier is further corroborated by the inclusion of two paintings by an artist known only by his work in the Freer Ramayana. Over the lower edge of a scene of entertainment, in which some men juggle balls and rings while others coax a goat to stand atop a pole, is an ascription which reads 'amal-i Kala Pahara (fig. I76). The schematic arched tufts on the dark green ground, the gold modeling lines of the turbans and drapery, and vacuous grins on the crudely drawn faces of this painting compare so closely with a Rdmdyana painting ascribed to Kala Pahara (fig. 88) that there can be no doubt that the two paintings are the work of the same artist.26 Another painting in the album may also be attributed to Kala Pahara (fig. 177). Although the work is far more carefully drawn than the previous example, both figures indulge the artist's proclivity for faces with the unique combination of a heavy jaw, sloping nose, and eye with a large centered pupil.

The ragamald paintings proper dis- play a greater stylistic consistency than is found in the later paintings of the Freer Ramayana; at the same time, they do not equal the Razmndma in either draftsmanship or compositional complexity. These two observations suggest a date of circa i6Io, a date already widely accepted in the scholarly world. This date is strengthened further by one more bit of evidence in the album: a spec- imen of calligraphy written by one Mahmud, and dated IOi/I602-03.27 It is curious that of all the named calligraphers whose work is featured in the album, none is cited in the Ma'dstr-i Rahim as being a former or current mem- ber of 'Abd al-Rahim's entourage.28 Hence, it seems that the Laud Rdgamadld Album was a loosely organized collection of contemporary and slightly older calligraphic examples supplemented with an assortment of the workshop's own paintings. The British Library Shdhndma The British Library Shdhnama (Book of Kings) represents a dramatic alterna- tive to the Ramayana and Razmndma, as 'Abd al-Rahim's atelier responded to a classical Persian historical text with a unique working method and a style un- predicted by the manuscripts discussed thus far.29 The clear and incontestable ascriptions on all but three of the ninety miniatures of the British Library Shahndma complement those of the Freer Ramayana in providing an account of the identity and stylistic range of the painters working for 'Abd al-Rahim.3? Like the Ramayana, the Shdhndma opens with a flyleaf note whose con- tents are qualified, if not altogether belied, by evidence within the manuscript. The longest of the three inscriptions on folio 2a relates that the late emperor Jahangir ordered the manuscript presented to Ilahwardi Cela on the first of the month of Azar of the eighth year of his reign, a date which corresponds to No- vember 23, 1613; the inscription also indicates that the latter gave the book in turn to his brother Khwaja Muhammad Rashid (fig. I78).3I Once again, the chronology advanced in the flyleaf note does not match a date found in the manuscript, for a minuscule inscription on the painting on folio 274a gives the name of the artist Shamal and the date 1025/1616 (fig. I79). The flyleaf inscription clouds the patronage of the manuscript. Jeremiah Losty, who has presented the only coherent discussion of the manuscript since the discovery of the date of i6i6, acknowledges that the paintings in the Shdh- ndma ascribed to artists such as Qasim, Kamal, and Madhava - all of whom are known to have worked for 'Abd al-Rahim - establish an irrefutable connection to 'Abd al-Rahim.32 At the same time, however, he retains confidence in Ilah- wardi Cela's onetime ownership. After raising and apparently dismissing the possibility that Ilahwardi Cela might have had access to 'Abd al-Rahim's painting studio, Losty reconciles the discrepancy between the two dates and the implications they hold for the manuscript's patronage by challenging the 263 ' ' . -t . ., ' : "Iq -! ...F&gt;i| d- ig J1 K I i II .1 .i</page><page sequence="260">accuracy of the date of 1613 on the flyleaf note. This suggestion is entirely plau- sible, given the fact that the flyleaf inscription refers tojahangir (died 1627) as deceased, thus indicating that the note postdates by at least eleven years the only certain date in the manuscript. There is a much simpler resolution to the problem posed by Ilahwardi Cela's ownership of the Shdhndma about 1613 and its illustration by 'Abd al- Rahim's artists in i6i6. The various notes and seals certify that the manu- script's history did not end with Jahangir's presentation of the manuscript to Ilahwardi Cela; in fact, one note explicitly mentions Muhammad Rashid as the manuscript's next recipient.33 It would seem that the manuscript continued to be passed around by the Mughal nobility, with Muhammad Rashid or even another owner presenting it to 'Abd al-Rahim, who had it refurbished in 16i6. This leaves two important aspects of the Shahndma to be considered. The first is the presence of an earlier series of illustrations in the manuscript over which the present Mughal works were executed. The second is the Persianate style of the Shdhndma illustrations, which Losty proposes is the result of a Per- sian origin of at least some of the 'Abd al-Rahim's artists.34 The overpainting of this Shdhndma manuscript is one of the most fasci- nating cases of the renovation of damaged or incomplete manuscripts in Mughal painting studios. As in many Mughal manuscripts, the reworking is revealed only upon repeated and meticulous examination. There is no colo- phon to indicate that the manuscript was written and illustrated long before the subimperial Mughal paintings were added, nor are there obvious stylistic discrepancies among the paintings to suggest that illustrations were added at two different times. Nevertheless, there are subtle signs of the existence of another layer of illustrations. In some instances, the outlines of the original Persian compositions, which are clearly different than those of the present miniatures, are visible from the reverse of the folios where certain pigments have been applied thickly or have had corrosive effects on the paper.35 In oth- ers, the overpainting is readily visible to the naked eye, generally when significant flaking has occurred or when faint fragments of the original paint- ings project into the margins or text area, as is the case, for example, with the extra rock-wielding hand floating above the defenders of a citadel (fig. i80).36 Losty posits the survival of the main features of the earlier Persian paint- ings, specifically mentioning the vegetation, but presumably including the disposition of the figures as well. He implies that the cramped nature of many of the overpainted subimperial miniatures is the result of 'Abd al-Rahim's artists trying to maintain the major formal features of the earlier Persian paint- ings below. There are indeed awkward passages in many of the illustrations, but these occur primarily in the treatment of the drapery and facial expressions - the very features that are cited as being repainted.

British Library, Add. 5600, f. 257a. II x 10.7 cm. The overpainting in the Shahndma cannot be held responsible for the sometimes curious proportions and expressions of the figures, for the present illustrations were not, in fact, painted directly over the earlier images. Instead, 264</page><page sequence="261">in most cases they were executed after a separate piece of paper had been affixed to the folio, covering the entire surface of the Persian painting.37 Careful ex- amination of the manuscript reveals the edges of this second, distinct layer of paper along the border of the text column on many paintings. Sometimes the presence of this new layer of paper is exposed by minute creases or bent back corners of the paper, but more often the patch of paper has been aligned so pre- cisely with the border of the written surface that its addition can be verified only by touch.38 This unusual technique of repainting is virtually unique in the history of Indian painting. Five of the first six illustrations are clearly applied to a patch of paper cut and matched to the painting field in the manner described above. But the seventh illustration in the manuscript (f. 42b) shows no sign of either direct overpainting or the addition of a new patch of paper. Rather, it is one of thirty-five illustrations interspersed throughout the Shahnama which 'Abd al- Rahim's artists executed directly on a blank painting field,39 a technique confirmed by the general freshness of the thinly painted surface as well as by inspection of the painting field from the reverse.40 This suggests that the ear- lier series of illustrations was incomplete when the manuscript was procured by 'Abd al-Rahim. Presumably the Khankhanan asked his workshop to com- plete the illustration of the manuscript, and allowed them to update the fifty- five fifteenth-century Persian illustrations with a new superimposed series of illustrations. This conclusion is supported by several subtle physical details. First, in at least four instances toward the end of the manuscript, the spaces reserved for illustration have been left empty, so that 'Abd al-Rahim's artists inexplicably appear to have failed to finish the task at hand.4I Second, on every folio which has an illustration where none existed before, the rectangular panels that nor- mally contain rubrics (or section headings) are empty.42 The omission of these rubrics, one of the many finishing details in the production of a manuscript, occurs quite commonly in incomplete manuscripts, but its occurrence in the Shahnama is limited to the aforementioned folios.43 This is the first clue that these newly painted folios were replacements for folios missing when the manuscript was acquired. One might expect that folios added a century after the manuscript was first produced would exhibit clear differences in either script or paper, but the work of 'Abd al-Ra.him's atelier so carefully matches the writing and paper of the original folios that it was only upon repeated ex- amination of this specific detail that a physical difference was discerned.44 Thus, we can now be certain that the incomplete state of the Shahnama moved 'Abd al-Rahim to order the workshop to undertake a massive renovation of the manuscript. The manuscript was then turned over to 'Abd al-Rahim's painters, whom we can identify individually from an exceptionally complete set of ascriptions written conspicuously on the miniatures themselves, often within small lobed circles.45 These ascriptions are absolutely reliable, being consistent with other 265</page><page sequence="262">paintings ascribed to these artists in the Shdhndma and other manuscripts.46 Like the Razmndma, the Shdhndma is dominated by handful of artists, with three - Shamal, Qasim, and Banavari - contributing nineteen, twenty-two, and twenty-seven illustrations respectively, or more than two-thirds of the ninety paintings in the manuscript. This concentrated distribution of assign- ments follows the examples of the Laud Rdgamdld and the Razmndma, both of which are dominated by Fazl. The different set of artists active in the Shdhndma suggests a connection between the artists chosen for the project and the par- ticular style selected for the manuscript's illustrations. Although the Shdhndma illustrations are related by a number of minor details to other manuscripts produced by 'Abd al-Rahim's atelier, they display a strikingly different sense of design than the paintings of the Freer Rdmdyana and the I616-I7 Razmndma. Most noticeably, they forgo the bands of strong color that characterize the other works of 'Abd al-Rahim's atelier. The bright, turbulent landscapes and contorted trees seen throughout the Rdmdyana yield to a paler, more subdued terrain bounded by conventional Persian ridges. The skies, almost uniformly a rich blue area splashed with white clouds, are unin- terrupted by the trees, architecture, and trails of swooping birds that appear in many Razmnama paintings. Such widespread differences in style are not the result of overpainting, the origins of the artists involved, or changes in the styles of individual artists over time, but are the manifestation of a conscious selection of a Persianate mode of painting for the Shdhndma. This choice can be demonstrated by a com- parison of paintings by the same artist, Shamal, in the Razmndma and the Shdh- ndma, which were both illustrated for 'Abd al-Rahim in I616. Thus we have an unequivocal test case: same artist, same patron, same year. In his Razmndma illustration of Arjuna's struggle against Susarma, Shamal divides the landscape into discrete registers of pale green, yellow, and violet (fig. i8i). Vertical outcrops spring up in the lower left, along the top of one text panel, and against the light blue sky, which is capped in turn by an even band of dark blue. Dark trees sprout from many of these forms and serve as roosts for an assortment of birds. Set at opposite ends of the three-tiered composition are the two tiny antagonists, who, together with their respective coteries, demonstrate a modest variety of facial types in both profile and three- quarter view. A representative example of Shamal's work in the Shdhndma shows a dif- ferent sensibility (fig. I82). The artist organizes the composition around the two clusters of figures, which occupy all but a narrow band of space across the center of the painting. The minimal setting is completely unobtrusive, as the scene of Piran meeting the Khaqan (ruler) of China overshadows the streaky green ground culminating in an uneven row of knotty rocks. Like the large warriors below, the mounted figures behind Piran and the crowned Khaqan are massed in such a way that they press against the edges of the painting and the very irregular configuration of text panels. They present a remarkably uni- 266</page><page sequence="263">.{ " : .JFF Wlos W. Solaio.J av (s l ili5(&gt;*i (&gt;.^^ *jc.| i8i.

Shamal's composition for the interior scene of the enthroned Kai Khus- raw meeting Rustam and Zal also features figures jostling for space (fig. 179). In this scene and in many others, the figures' heads are disproportionately large. A profound difference from the Razmndma occurs in the range of facial types, with Shamal and every other artist in the Shdhndma fashioning three- quarter views of figures with either long, full-bearded faces or rounded visages, heavy eyelids, and close-cropped facial hair; a second major type is a profile view of a heavy-chinned youth with or without a dark, pointed mustache. Shamal in particular creates figures whose facial expressions often seem quite detached from whatever activity may be transpiring in the scene. Dark pupils within the large, almond-shaped eyes give direction to the glances of the figures, but rarely are these focused within the scene. More peculiar still is a device which Shamal seems to invent to show astonishment or other intense emotions, but which is taken up by other artists working in the Shdhndma: eyes set vertically on the face, as in the kneeling figure in the lower right. Shamal 267 sAMJ.^uv fitjb1^3^--l-.i'W+JaL t^ i&gt;|jL-tJ.^J^^U^^ t .^^ i dL?_ +.9 'i ' '?5u^ -- &lt; T)} Ss s . &gt;ZA.-JUTV- .</page><page sequence="264">also makes frequent use of the device of figures looking out at the viewer, though this curious effect may be an inadvertent result of an awkward han- dling of the eyes. The tigerskin-clad hero Rustam is the beneficiary of this same outward gaze in Qasim's illustration of Kai Ka'us setting Kai Khusraw beside him on the throne, a painting which typifies the many court scenes in the Shdhndma (fig. I83). Here, as elsewhere, Qasim does not venture beyond the stock poses and gestures of Mughal painting, which seem blunt and inarticulate by com- parison with the very subtly rendered faces of his figures. These faces - espe- cially those in profile view - are unquestionably the most up-to-date feature of his paintings. Indeed, there is very little difference between a figure such as the kneeling courtier in the lower right of this painting and many ancillary figures in works produced by imperial artists at this time. This comparison is true, however, only for a few figure types, for Qasim and his fellow painters ply a much narrower range of figure types and generally forgo the practice of indi- vidualizing them with details drawn from actual observation. By contrast, Qasim elaborates the standard interior setting with a richly patterned carpet KAo', 183. (above, left) Kai Ka'us sets the young Kai Khusraw beside him on the throne.

And as in many of the paintings in the Shdhnama, he freely employs areas of stamped gold to render the throne and armor, a feature much less prominent in the Radmyana. Banavari, the most prolific artist in the Shdhndma, held practically exclu- sive rights in the manuscript to the genre of battle scenes. His scene of the bat- tle of the Turanians and Iranians transpires before a typically thinly painted landscape, which is reduced to the nearly ubiquitous form of an arched hori- zon outlined with a wavering black line (fig. I84). The rudimentary landscape notwithstanding, Banavarl's compositions remain closer to the imperial Mughal idiom than do those of any other artist working in the manuscript. By reducing the figure scale, Banavari increases the vigor of battle, so that the war- riors are thoroughly engaged by action and glance, and even the musicians beyond the ridge contribute to the din of battle in a manner highly reminis- cent of Mughal painting of two decades earlier. Banavari's familiarity with painting conventions current under Akbar is also manifested in his use of a number of old-fashioned devices. For example, in one exterior scene (f. 325b), he positions two oversized onlookers just over the horizon, thereby recalling a favorite convention from the earliest known Mughal manuscript, the Hamzandma. In another Shahndma illustration, he gives the central figure in three-quarter view the features of a long-faced, bearded man, one of his favorite figure types. In this case, the figure is shown clearly with a further eye extending slightly beyond the contour of the face, a feature which also harks back to Mughal painting of the I57os and early i58os (fig. I85). These details show no trace of the misunderstanding or impoverishment of the imperial Mughal style so common in subimperial painting. Rather, their informed but outmoded quality points to Banavari's previous training in the imperial atelier. It has been suggested that two of 'Abd al-Rahim's painters, Banavari and Kamal, were among the artists who worked on the Razmndma dated I007/I598-99.47 As noted in Chapter i, I reject the conclusion that 'Abd al-Rahim was the patron of the I598-99 Razmndma, but I agree with the suggestion that the Banavari Khurd (the younger) who contributed five paintings to that manuscript is the same artist who worked on the Shdhndma manuscript.48 A number of formal features confirm this hypothesis. One of Banavari Khurd's two exterior scenes in the 1598-99 Razmndma, for example, shows three pastel, tall-lobed ridges with thin, nervous outlines below a sky of swirling, washed clouds (fig. i86). These same elements, which are markedly different from Qasim's knotty, darkly outlined rocks, recur in a number of Banavari's Shdhndma paintings, such as Figure i85. Likewise, the general range of facial types and tight facial features of Banavari's figures in the I598-99 Razmndma persist two decades later in the Shdhnama; only in their in- creased scale have the figures changed in any significant way. More striking still is the unmistakable repetition of a distinctive facial type known from Ba- 269</page><page sequence="266">navarl Khuird's sole illustration in the I597-99 Bdburndma (fig. I87). Charac- terized by its plump shape, broad nose, and neatly trimmed beard, which frames the ear in a particularly prominent manner, this facial type is employed at least six times among the onlookers of the wrestling match, and on count- less occasions in the Shdhndma, notably on the crowned figure in Figure i85. In the artist Banavari, then, we find a demonstrable personal connection be- tween the imperial atelier and 'Abd al-Rahim's workshop, the strongest link in the chain of the diffusion of the imperial Mughal style throughout north- ern India. Kamal seems to have enjoyed a similar experience in the imperial atelier. Two ascribed paintings by Kamal in the 1598-99 Razmndma indicate that the artist is the son of Khema, who is probably the accomplished imperial painter Khema Karana.49 These paintings do not show an obvious stylistic similarity to works by Kamal in the Rdmdyana, the I616-17 Razmnama, or the Shdhndma, but after careful consideration one begins to recognize sufficient continuity in certain facial types and landscape elements to argue that all the paintings ascribed to Kamal are the work of the same artist.50 In short, the stylistic and inscriptional evidence is strong enough to make it plausible that Kamal too joined the Khankhanan's workshop after a brief period in the imperial atelier about I598. This conclusion, however, has one particularly interesting implication. Banavari is first documented as being associated with 'Abd al-Rahim in the two manuscripts of i6i6, thereby allowing ample time to elapse after 1598-99 for him to move from one atelier to other. Kamal, on the other hand, con- tributed several paintings to the Ramayana, including one (f. 95a) almost immediately after an illustration dated 1597-98. His other four paintings fall toward the end of the Rdmdyana, which is dated to I604-05 on the same basis. From this one might conclude that Kamal began his career with 'Abd al- Rahim, gained admittance to the imperial atelier just long enough to produce a few illustrations in the 1598-99 Razmndma, rejoined his former patron to work on the Rdmdyana by I604, and continued in his employ through at least I616. Alternatively, one could grant Kamal practically simultaneous mem- bership in two different ateliers.5I Yet both of these scenarios are extremely improbable. How then should we account for this apparently paradoxical chronology? One might, of course, doubt the attribution of these paintings to the same artist, but to do so would be to allow uncertain historical considerations to override an objective assessment of visual evidence. A more satisfactory answer lies in challenging the assumption of a date of 1597-98 for Kamal's first Rdmdyana painting, which, though it follows a painting of that date, also pre- cedes by only a few more folios an illustration dated I60o (f. I22b). Once we 187. Babur watches a wrestling match and an animal com- bat. By Banavari Khurd. I597-99 Baburnama. National Museum, New Delhi 50.336, f. 350a. 22.9 x 13.6 cm. I88.

In addition to featuring two painters with the most explicit connections to the imperial atelier, the i6i6 Shdhndma names three new artists - Madhava, Bula, and Bhagavati - whose work is not represented elsewhere in the oeuvre of 'Abd al-Rahim's atelier. Madhava, mentioned in the Ma'adsr-i Rahimi as a Hindu painter who illustrated most of the manuscripts produced by the ate- lier, supplied the first painting in the manuscript (fig. i88).52 Like Banavari, Madhava employs a simplified landscape as the arena of battle, which is more active than most pictorial encounters in the manuscript. Madhava's facial types and small figure scale establish that he, too, is quite close to the imper- ial idiom. The complete congruence of Madhava's work with some imperial painting of the i58os and 159os encourages speculation that this artist may be synonymous with one Madhava (or Madha) Gujarati known from the I598-99 Razmndma.53 But with the visual evidence limited to a single painting in the Shdhndma and only three in the 1598-99 Razmndma, and Madhava a particu- larly common name, it is prudent to consider this example as only additional circumstantial evidence for a minor migration of artists with training in the imperial workshop to 'Abd al-Rahim's atelier. If the name of Bula, the second of this trio of new artists, is an abbrevi- ated form of Bulaqi, then it is plausible that he, too, passed into the Khan- khanan's painting studio after a brief apprenticeship in the imperial work- shop, for two artists named Bulaqi contributed five paintings to the I598-99 Razmndma, which functioned as a kind of proving ground for potential impe- rial artists. One of the artists is named as the son of Ghulam 'All, who left Akbar's workshop to work on the Freer Rdmdyana. Such a familial connection would provide an obvious incentive for Bulaqi to join 'Abd al-Rahim's service. The limited formal evidence does little to support this scenario, however: in- deed, Bula's sole work in the Shahndma bears only a superficial resemblance to the I598-99 Razmndma paintings (fig. I89). Apart from the marked increase in figure scale, which appears throughout the Shahndma, many of Bala's figures have large, round heads with heavy-lidded eyes - a set of facial features quite unlike the more severe ones of Builaqi's work, in which almost all figures appear in profile. However distinctive the former facial type may seem, it is not unique to Bula; indeed, it is akin to those which appear commonly in early sev- enteenth-century painting in Persia itself. Mughal painters seem to have em- ployed it to denote a Persian identity, much as they made crowns topped with flowers, an attribute of important Hindu figures in the Radmyana and Razmndma. Thus, a purely iconographic element may be obscuring a subtle stylistic connection. Bhagavati's connection to the imperial workshop is far more certain. His three paintings in the Shdhndma display a consistent range of figure types; the most distinctive of these has an elongated and somewhat flattened face, as seen in the mounted figure of Zavarah witnessing Rustam's final revenge (fig. 271</page><page sequence="268">I90). This same facial type appears several times in two slightly colored paint- ings ascribed to Bhagavati, which also include a simplified cluster of build- ings nestled among schematically rounded hills.54 That these features appear on paintings inserted into an album filled with specimens of calligraphy and painting by well-known artists active during Akbar's reign suggests that Bhagavati benefitted from a brief stint in the royal atelier before entering 'Abd al-Rahim's employ. This discussion of the painters represented in the Shdhndma underscores the overall stylistic homogeneity of the manuscript's ninety illustrations. In certain respects, however, the manuscript stands apart from other manuscripts illustrated for 'Abd al-Rahim, most strikingly so from an exactly contempo- rary work, the 1616-I7 Razmndma. Foremost among the formal differences are the radical simplification and dessication of the Shdhndma landscapes. The twisted, brightly colored mountains and outcrops that enhance the action of the Rdmdyana and Razmndma scenes are lacking in the Shdhndma illustrations. Second, the figures, who are disproportionately larger in the composition, also assume less varied poses, a difference made prominent in the many court scenes in the Shdhnama. Finally, a profound change occurs in the range of facial types in the two manuscripts. The consistency of facial types in the Shdhndma, which would make the attribution of paintings quite difficult were it not for the ascriptions on nearly all the illustrations, is achieved in the absence of Fazl, the most dis- tinctive artist in the atelier. As I have noted, Banavari, the leading artist of the Shdhnama, remained close to the imperial Mughal style in all his works. Qasim exhibited a more obvious development over time, beginning with his tenta- tive work on folio 72a of the Rdmdyana (fig. 68) and culminating in his highly accomplished paintings in the Shdhndma (fig. I83) and the Berlin Khamsa (fig. 201). By contrast, Fazl maintained throughout his oeuvre a penchant for sharply featured men as well as for strong colors and designs. Indeed, it is with Fazl alone that the resemblance of an artist's paintings from one manuscript to an- other truly goes beyond similarities in minor idiosyncratic expressions, such as the repetition of a distinctive bearded face in nearly every work by Banavari (see figs. I84-85). Above this level, however, it is increasingly clear that all the painters involved in the Shdhndma project tried to adopt a much more homo- geneous Persianate mode. Fazl's inability or unwillingness to accommodate this stylistic orientation almost certainly accounts for his absence from the project. Hence, I believe that the pervasive differences between the paintings of the British Library Shdhndma and those of the dispersed Razmndma are neither a function of constraints imposed by overpainting nor one of a chronological development of style, but the result of a Persianate mode prescribed by the ate- I I90.

Ia. success, but by i6i6, they had full mastery of the formal conventions that it comprised. The Berlin Khamsa of Amir Khusraw Another genre of classical Persian literature in 'Abd al-Rahim's library is re- presented by an illustrated manuscript of the Khamsa of Amir Khusraw Dih- lawi now in Berlin.55 Amir Khusraw (I253-I325) was a highly esteemed Indian poet who worked for a series of rulers during the Delhi Sultanate. His Khamsa (Quintet), a collection of five epic romances written between I298-99 and I302, is the most famous of the many imitations of the great Khamsa of the Per- sian poet Nizami (1141-1209). It is hardly surprising that 'Abd al-Rahim wished to own a copy of one of the best-known poetical texts in the Persian world. Nonetheless, the means by which the Khankhanan came to possess this particular manuscript are quite unusual, and shed still more light on the na- ture of his interest in books. Once again, an inscription by 'Abd al-Rahim himself provides the clear- est evidence of his level of awareness of the workings of his library establish- ment. In the upper left of the pink flyleaf on folio Ia, which is embellished with large golden vegetation and birds like those elsewhere in the manuscript, are marks of onetime imperial ownership: a note by Shah Jahan and the seal of Awrangzeb (fig. 191). Immediately below these is a long note written earlier by 'Abd al-Rahim, who describes in considerable detail the history of the manu- script.56 The Khankhanan states that, beginning in 1012/I603-04, the manu- script was purchased piecemeal in Gujarat by Mir Baqi, an employee of the library. Repeated inquiries by Mir Baqi in Gujarat, a gift of several leaves from 'Abd al-Malik, and visits to Agra by those who wished to sell stray leaves re- sulted in the acquisition of all but a few of the leaves of the Khamsa, which was assembled and restored in 'Abd al-Rahim's library by Mfi'min and others. After a relatively lengthy description of the process of accumulating dispersed folios of the manuscript and his own deliverance from his political enemies, the Khankhanan offers but a passing reference to the manuscript's calligrapher, al- legedly Sultan 'Ali, and its painter, who is touted as Bihzad. He concludes his remarks by indicating that the paintings that had fallen out were restored or replaced, presumably by the atelier's painters, and that decorative borders were added. 'Abd al-Rahim specifies that Mu'min headed the team of calli- graphers, but does not single out any of his own painters by name. In the cen- ter of the circular medallion is a second inscription, apparently written by a librarian, which records the accession of the book in 'Abd al-Rahim's kitabkhdna in 1026/I617, thus marking the end of a refurbishment of more than ten years. 'Abd al-Rahim's account of the refurbishment of the Berlin Khamsa is supported by a number of features of the manuscript. The first book, Matla' al-Anwdr (Rising of the Luminaries) (ff. I-43), survived wholly intact. The ex- quisite double-page sarlawh on folios ib and 2a gives some indication of the 273</page><page sequence="270">?19 * iW&gt;iA;'' 1.

I92). The two columns of text, whose lines are set off by gold areas adorned with flowers, are flanked by rec- tangular panels, which in turn are incorporated into a black border overlaid with a thin running vine. Large horizontal panels, each with two lobed squares interlocked with a golden rectangle, complete the framed rectangular field of the sarlawh. All these elements create a strongly architectonic effect, a quality which distinguishes this sarlawh from all but one of the other illuminations in the manuscript. The only contribution made by 'Abd al-Rahim's atelier to this particular book of the Khamsa is a painting of a dedicatory scene at the end of the section (f. 43a), which is then followed by two pages filled with free ren- derings of bird and flower motifs (fig. I93). The first folio of the second book, Khusraw wa Shirin (ff. 44-95), is writ- ten on paper resembling that used throughout the preceding book; although the original 'unwdn or illumination survived along with the rest of the folio, 'Abd al-Rahim's artists redid the 'unwdn (fig. I94). Despite traces of blue paint on folio 45a immediately opposite the 'unwdn - signs of onetime deterioration due to dampness - the present 'unwdn appears in pristine condition. Still more obvious signs of renovation follow. The highly burnished sur- face of the biscuit-colored paper of folios 46-51 is noticeably different from the I92. (above, left) Sarlawh.

In these replacement folios, the earlier practice of using of gold, red, and blue ink in al- ternate lines for the rubrics yields to an exclusive use of gold, and the decora- tive cloudlike forms echoing these titles are abandoned. The calligraphy of the rewritten folios is so fine that it is not readily distinguished from that of the original folios. Nevertheless, the difficulty the atelier experienced in match- ing the restored section of text to the original manuscript is apparent in an- other feature of the writing. In poetical manuscripts such as the Khamsa, the text area is almost always divided into four columns to accommodate the distichs or couplets in which the poem is composed. This highly compart- mentalized format normally made it easy for a calligrapher to write out the missing verses in the same amount of space as in the original. Yet as 'Abd al- Rahim's calligrapher approached the end of the final folio in the replaced sec- tion, he realized that the amount of text remaining was insufficient to fill the area allotted for the standard twenty-one lines of text, perhaps as a result of an abbreviated or omitted rubric. Hence, he decided to write two couplets obliquely in the middle of folio 5ib to hide the shortfall of one line, a device often used before illustrations, but rarely in other circumstances.57 Once again, the workshop elected to add a painting at the very end of the section (fig. I95). 275</page><page sequence="272">The third book of the Khamsa, the romance of Majnuin wa Layla (ff. 96-127), was nearly complete when the manuscript was acquired by 'Abd al-Rahim. The atelier had to supply replacements for only the first three folios, including the 'unwdn on folio 96b. One artist embellished the meager amount of space left below the conclusion of the poem on folio I27a with a narrow painting of a jackal hunting rabbits (fig. I96); another member of the work- shop covered the blank central panel on folio I27b with a few stock motifs of birds and flowers. 'Abd al-Rahim's employees were successful in locating all but one folio of the final two books of the Khamsa, the Hasht Bihisht (Eight Paradises) (ff. I28-70), and the A'inah-i Sikandari (Mirror of Alexander) (ff. I7I-225).58 Unlike the other 'unwans in the manuscript, which the Khankhanan's artists either affixed to the original paper or created on an entirely new sheet of paper, the 'unwdn on folio I7Ib survived in its original condition, and thus provides an idea of the original provenance and date of the manuscript. The Timurid origin of this illumination is revealed in the white strapwork enclosing the overlapping lobes of the illumination and in the braided Kufic script of the pious invocation (basmala) written in in the central cartouche.59 Therefore, it would seem that 'Abd al-Rahim directed his library establishment to re- assemble and refurbish a Persian manuscript originally produced about I500. It is worth noting, however, that he attributed the rarity of the manuscript not to its age, but to its unsubstantiated association with two nearly legendary Persian artists: the calligrapher Sultan 'All al-Mashhadi (1442-I519) and the painter Bihzad (active I485-1536/37). It is easy enough to understand the purpose of the restored text pages or illuminations, which were necessary to complete the text or replace damaged elements. One might assume, therefore, that the paintings added by 'Abd al- Rahim's atelier also replaced lost illustrations. But several physical features of the paintings make this a much more perplexing proposition than one might expect. Most of the paintings added by 'Abd al-Rahim's artists appear on folios which retain small panels of text. Careful examination of these text panels in- dicate that they are written on the same whitish paper as that of the original manuscript. In other words, the new paintings are not part of the entirely new folios supplied by the atelier, as in the Shahnama, and thus cannot be replace- ments for illustrations lost when the manuscript was broken up in the six- teenth century. This leaves us to ponder an unexpected question: How did paintings by 'Abd al-Rahim's artists come to appear on the original folios of the Khamsa? On the one hand, it is possible that the illustration of the Khamsa was never fully realized. Thus, as part of their refurbishment of the Khamsa, 'Abd al-Rahim's artists would have merely availed themselves of the spaces origi- nally reserved for illustrations but left blank when the manuscript was pro- 276</page><page sequence="273">i96.

The absence of folios with the obvious double thickness of many of the Shdhndma illustrations argues for such a process. On the other hand, some very subtle details on a few paintings suggest a second practice which may complement the first. One painting shows unmis- takable signs of a second layer of paper superimposed on the original folio. In folio i66b, the seam of paper of this second layer of paper is quite visible just below the upper edge of the painting despite the artist's attempt to obscure it with a band of dark blue paint (fig. 197).60 This suggests that 'Abd al-Rahim's artists employed for at least some paintings in the Khamsa the technique of overpainting that they later used in the Shdhnama, that is, covering over a dam- aged scene with a new sheet of paper and then completing a fresh painting in an updated style.6' This process of obliteration and renewal becomes all the more intriguing when we realize that 'Abd al-Rahim believed that the paintings in the manu- script were by Bihzad. What happened to these paintings? Again we must consider several possibilities: i. The Khankhanan's attribution of the original Persian illustrations to Bihzad was accurate, but all these paintings have since disappeared;62 2. 'Abd al-Rahim was mistaken in crediting the paintings to Bihzad; or 3. The earlier paintings were by Bihzad or his followers, but they 277 ~~~~~~~~~~~~Z</page><page sequence="274">were so damaged that 'Abd al-Rahim allowed his workshop to replace them in the manuscript, preferring paintings in perfect condition by his own artists to damaged ones by an acknowledged Persian master.63 To my mind, this last sce- nario is the most likely of the three. It is consistent not only with the pattern of overpainting seen in the Shdhndma, but also with the replacement of defec- tive 'unwdns and the strengthening of rubrics, presumably also written by Sultan 'All, in the Berlin Khamsa itself. Indeed, the value that we now place on objects for purely antiquarian reasons seems rather anachronistic in the me- dieval Islamic world, which apparently revered manuscripts and similar objects primarily for their subject matter, monetary value, or ancestral con- nections. It is ironic that the Berlin Khamsa has returned to a state whose incom- pleteness echoes the fragmentary condition in which 'Abd al-Rahim's agents found it nearly four hundred years ago. Only seven of the twenty-one paint- ings once in the manuscript remain in place. The first illustration in the manuscript appears at the conclusion of the Matla' al-Anwdr, and shows the poet Amir Khusraw presenting a manuscript copy of the Khamsa to his patron, 'Ala al-Din Muhammad Shah Khalji (fig. I93). Such presentation scenes are not uncommon in manuscripts of the Khamsa, a text with a long tradition of illustration, but the position of this one at the end of the poem is very un- usual.64 Indeed, the odd position of this and the following painting (fig. 195) makes it likely that they occupied spaces left blank in the original manuscript. This first scene in the manuscript also introduces us to the painting style selected by 'Abd al-Rahim's artists for this project. Together with the bal- anced composition and graceful figures, the precise draftsmanship and high finish of the painting point up the heavily Persianate nature of this style. A number of paintings are ascribed to Nadim, Qasim, and Mushfiq, all of whom are known from the Freer Ramayana, but the illustrations are so consistent in style that we can attribute unascribed works only with considerable difficulty. Although the figures resemble many characters in Nadim's other paintings in the manuscript, they do so as much on the level of the physiognomies favored for various social stations - a bony brow for the musician and attendant and a long, bearded face for the author/sage - as on that of a consistent distinctive personal rendering of those types. It is only the presence of rough minor dec- orative motifs, such as the rounded hook pattern of the lip of the stone plat- form or the braided gold immediately above it, that leads us to connect this work specifically with Nadim, who employs these peculiar motifs again in his illustration on folio 95b (fig. I95). This attribution is also supported by the delicate arrangement of faint plants against the dark background in both paintings as well as similarities in the modeling and palette of the figures' gar- ments.

Khamsa.65 The first of these illustrates the seventeenth discourse of the Matla' al-Anwdr (fig. I98). An old Sufi happens upon a handsome young man in a gar- den and begins to venture amorous advances. Once rebuffed, the old man waxes philosophical and urges his counterpart to realize the fleeting quality of youth; the youth, for his part, chides the stooped old man to learn to act his age. To illustrate the popular anecdote, Nadim summoned two stock figures of Persian painting, contrasting the slender youth, posed gracefully beside a flowering sapling, with the bulkier Sufi planted firmly beneath a massive chenar tree. Together with the cypress, another mainstay of Persian vegeta- tion, these same trees impart a Persianate flavor to the landscape, whose pastel coloration, delicate screen of hills, and general airiness also draw upon well- established conventions of Persian painting. A full-page illustration ascribed to Nadim on a rock in the lower right shows Khusraw in disguise trying to dishearten the sculptor Farhad with false news of the death of his beloved Shirin (fig. I99). Farhad, whose love for Shirin is tested by her demand that he perform the Herculean task of cutting a chan- nel through Mt. Bisitun so that the court might enjoy the milk of his flocks, is identified not by his customary attribute of excavator's tools, but by two large pools at either end of the milk-channel and by two sculptures cut into the face of the mountain. Once again Nadim opened up the center of the compo- sition to isolate the two figures, one of whom is virtually identical to the youth- ful king on folio 43a (fig. I93). The artist also repeated the fuzzy texture of Farhad's cloak and the natural poses of the dappled goats and sheep in the background in the small painting on folio i66b (fig. I97). The subtle patch- work of the mountain's colored lobes is eloquent testimony to Nadim's refined landscapes, a feature also seen in Nadim's illustration in the Ramayana (fig. 55). A third scene ascribed to Nadim is more vigorous in both composition and color (fig. 200). Bahram Gur, the protagonist of the Hasht Bihisht, displays his hunting prowess before Dilaram. The arrows he unleashes emasculate a male gazelle and pierce the head of a female gazelle in such a way that she appears to be a horned male. Although the situation is inherently more dy- namic than the previous examples, Nadim infused the composition with a newfound sense of energy. Bahram Gur has already transformed one of his prey and draws his bow to cut down the other. The three animals press against the edge of the composition, which bulges outward under the impact of their fren- zied flight, thereby seeming to offer some hope of escape.66 That Nadim ex- tended the painting field into the outer margin - a feature common in six- teenth-century Persian manuscripts - is one example of the many Persian artistic conventions that were invoked by 'Abd al-Rahim's artists in their paintings in this manuscript. Perhaps the most spectacular painting in the Khamsa is Qasim's illustra- tion of the story told to Bahram Gur by the princess of the Yellow Pavilion (fig. 20I). A goldsmith is convicted of embezzlement on evidence provided inad- vertently by his slow-witted wife, and is imprisoned in a tall tower. He per- 279</page><page sequence="276">201.

When she does, the goldsmith lowers himself from the tower and pulls the hapless woman into his place, where she endures the ridicule of the townspeople while he goes free. The strength of this work lies in its juxtaposition of the intense purple of the tower against both the brilliant clothing of the goldsmith and his wife and the four discrete bands of strong color in the landscape. Qasim used similarly distinct zones of color in many a Ramayana illustration, such as his painting on folio 332a (fig. 157), but here he subtly joined together the light green and yel- low areas by introducing slight irregularities along the otherwise straight line dividing the two zones.

The delicately featured woman is clearly derived from different artistic stock than that of her counterpart in Qasim's illustration on folio 317b of the Rdmdyana (fig. 154), whose rounded forehead and almond-shaped eye are in- debted to the indigenous Indian models. Like Nadim before him, Qasim maintained this Persianate aesthetic in the landscape as well, substituting a chenar tree and a pair of cypresses for the banyan trees that often appear in his works in the Ramayana. So close are the Persianate expressions of these two artists that were it not for the tiny ascription to Qasim in the lower right, only the broad steplike arrangement of the rocks in the upper section of the paint- ing would hint at Qasim's involvement. Known for both the earliest (fig. 21o) and latest dated paintings (fig. 163) associated with 'Abd al-Rahim, as well as from two paintings in the Ramayana, Mushfiq contributed three works to the Berlin Khamsa.67 One work illustrates an uneventful episode from the story told to Bahram Gur by the princess of the Blue Pavilion (fig. 202). After making his way to a land of legendary exotic- ness, a youth from Rtum enters an enchanted garden, and there encounters a host of beautiful maidens. He soon falls in love with their queen, but one morning awakens from a stupor to find himself alone in a desert. He chances upon a recluse, who explains to the perplexed youth that he has been the dupe of fairies. The recluse invites the youth to share his way of life, but before the youth can begin this new life, he becomes embroiled once more in a series of bewildering adventures. Content to depict the scene of discourse called for by the manuscript's original designer, who chose where to interrupt the text for an illustration, Mushfiq showed the confused youth seeking solace from the hermit. The con- versation takes place not in the barren wilderness, but before a small, domed pavilion set within a walled compound. Together with the iconography of the recluse's clothing, these architectural forms lend a Muslim identity to the scene. This is made clear by comparison to both Mushfiq's illustration of the temptation of the half-naked Visvamitra (fig. 57) and Qasim's scene of Dasaratha's visit to Durvasas's hermitage (fig. 156). Mushfiq's paintings in the Khamsa are not far removed in style from his efforts in the Rdmdyana, which are among the finest in that manuscript, but they are still closer in landscape elements, coloring, and compositional details to other Khamsa paintings by Nadim and Qasim. That three artists could produce works so similar in style implies a desire and ability on the part of the atelier's supervisors to ensure that all the artists involved in a given project adopt a relatively homogeneous style.68 Another painting from the heavily illustrated Hasht Bihisht book of the Khamsa falls near the end of the story told by the princess of the Rose-colored Pavilion (fig. 203). A prince is smitten by a portrait of a king's mistress, and enlists the aid of four friends to help him meet her. The two become lovers and plot her escape. The prince and his companions invite the king to dine with 281</page><page sequence="278">them on seven successive nights, and have him served by a beautiful cup- bearer, who is none other than his mistress in seven different disguises. Excited by the prospect of having this bevy of maidens join his mistress in the harem, the king allows the prince and his companions to set sail, unaware that they are spiriting away his mistress, whom they have hidden in the ship. Mushfiq took his cue from the three lines of text above, and depicted the king at water's edge, watching the ship carry off his jealously guarded mis- tress. Although the very refined and somewhat miniaturized figures are well within the ability of any of the three artists discussed thus far, certain figures are identical to those found in the two Khamsa illustrations ascribed to Mushfiq. The youth in black near the ship's stern, for example, compares closely to the dismayed youth of Figure 202; likewise, the face of the king (di- rectly beneath the parasol) bears an uncanny resemblance to those of the two laborers just right of center in the following illustration (fig. 204). The strongly hewn shoreline and variety of intense colors within the landscape also support an attribution to Mushfiq. The final painting in the manuscript depicts Alexander's construction of an iron wall against the barbarians of Gog and Magog, an episode from the fifth book of the Khamsa (fig. 204).69 In addition to the ascription to the artist Mushfiq on the painting field, a feature found on most of the illustrations in the manuscript, this painting bears the date 1019/1610-Ii. This date accords with the chronology advanced by 'Abd al-Rahim in his note on the Khamsa's flyleaf and places the manuscript's production between the conclusion of the illustration of the Rdmdyana in i605 and the flurry of painting activity on the Razmndma and the Shdhndma in i6i6. If our tentative dating of the Laud Ragamdld is correct, then two very dissimilar types of paintings were produced simultaneously by the atelier both in i6io and in i6i6. The profound differ- ence in subject and style between the Rdgamald series and the Khamsa of Amir Khusraw Dihlawi was repeated six years later in the illustrations of the Razm- nama and Shahndma manuscripts. Developments analogous to this paradoxi- cal coincidence also occur in imperial Mughal painting, but there the contra- dictory strands of painting are often obscured by the greater numbers of works and the possibility of different patrons within the royal family. Perhaps pre- cisely because the paintings produced for 'Abd al-Rahim are unusually well- documented, they defy the formulation of any simple chronological pattern to this individual's patronage of illuminated manuscripts either for their literacy or stylistic content. It seems far more likely that 'Abd al-Rahim accepted or encouraged the production of manuscripts with some variation in style and de- gree of luxury. A supervisor placed in charge of the illumination of the Khamsa manuscript effected the high refinement of its illustrations, whose style may have been deemed suitable to Amir Khusraw's text, much as Fazl's simpler V7 "is ?

Though the dominance of one artist's style in a manuscript was un- 't doubtedly facilitated by the proportion of his works in the painting cycle, the stylistic homogeneity of the paintings in the Berlin Khamsa and the Laud Ragamala suggests that there existed in the production of illuminated manu- scripts in the atelier of 'Abd al-Rahim a level of centralization which extended beyond the sway of an individual artist. The chief agent of this organization was probably a supervisor appointed specifically for a given project; the nam- ing of Mulla Shakibi as the supervisor of the Ramayana and 'Abd al-Baqi's mention of the men who held the post of n.zim or ddrogha in 'Abd al-Rahim's atelier make such a position quite plausible. In any case, the contemporaneity of these later manuscripts produced for 'Abd al-Rahim exposes the inadequa- cies of the model of a direct and pervasive connection between the components of a body of painting and a given patron in medieval India. The Timurndma .. The least known manuscript illustrated by 'Abd al-Rahim's atelier is a copy of il the Timurndma of Hatifi (died I520-2I), who was the nephew of the famous Persian poet Jami.70 Hatifi's poetical text follows the model of the Sikandar- nama (History of Alexander) of Nizami, but celebrates instead the exploits of TimUr (I336-I405), the Mongol ruler who conquered a vast area extending from Turkey to China. The slender manuscript allegedly bears a date of 927/I52I, which is nearly contemporary with the composition of the text, but this date is rubbed and was possibly altered. The Timurndma now contains ten illustrations. Unlike the other manu- scripts illustrated by 'Abd al-Rahim's atelier, all the paintings lack ascrip- tions, but their general style leaves no doubt that they were produced by the 93. Khankhanan's artists. The first five paintings spill over the gold ruling that ion joins the two text panels, and occupy practically the entire folio. In several instances, the paint is applied so thinly that segments of this ruling are still visible, a feature also present in the Rdmayana. By contrast, the latter five illustrations remain within the original limits of the painting field. The result is a much smaller image, which shares the folio's surface with the atelier's mar- ginal designs of vegetation and fowl. It is probably no more than a coincidence that the difference in the for- mat of these two series of paintings also corresponds to a stylistic one. The first series begins with a scene of Timur hunting near Shiraz in I387, but continues with four successive illustrations of battles, the predominant subject of the text. All five paintings are rendered in a style much like that of the I616-17 Razmndma. In each scene, the generic action transpires within a landscape di- vided into bands of solid color. In the illustration of Timur's defeat of Sultan Ahmad at Baghdad, for example, the broad mauve section in the center of the composition culminates in two imposing ridges, one supporting a large tree which reaches to the very edge of the painting, and the other, a deep purple mass, setting off the green hills in the distance (fig. 205). The artist built upon 283</page><page sequence="280">the spatial disruption caused by the lower text panel to create a modest fore- ground, which is anchored by another rock cluster and enlivened by a figure refreshing himself by a stream. Although this tripartite composition was standard fare for most artists in the Razmndma, a few features point specifically to the hand of Qisim. The splayed arrangement of the long, angular, split-topped lobes of the outcrops recalls that found in Qasim's work in the Razmndma (fig. I68) and the Rdmdyana (fig. I35). The rigid yellow trunk and strongly shaped foliage of the large tree also belong to the artist's distinctive repertoire of forms, as does the small waterfall pouring from the side of an outcrop. The figures, however, are too small in scale and too standard in facial type to further corroborate the at- tribution. The artists of the second five Timurndma illustrations set off in an entirely unexpected direction. Rather than continuing to employ the mode identified here with the Razmndma, they moved towards the more Persianate mode seen in the i616 Shahndma. The artist of the two battle scenes in this section relin- quished the layered spatial recession and opaque colors of the other examples of this genre in the TTmurndma (fig. 206). Instead, he constructed a simpler pic- torial space within a single zone, using slight gradations in the thinly painted ground to effect a modicum of distance in the landscape. Likewise, he eschewed the energetic outcrops that punctuate the landscapes of the Razm- nama and Rdmdyana in favor of the uninterrupted arched horizon of the Shdh- ndma. Curiously, however, the swing of the pendulum towards this alternate mode does not include the combatants, who differ from their counterparts in the first half of the manuscript only in their reluctance to wear turbans. The Persianate cast becomes more pronounced in the three remaining paintings, which illustrate Timur's victorious arrival before a besieged city and two occasions of celebration. In one of the latter, the artist illustrated the acquiescence of the Egyptian ruler to Timur's demands with a standard Mughal scene of gift-giving, complete with reigning monarch, bulbous tent, canopy, and fountain (fig. 207). Timtr's turban, and the dress and facial types of the four female entertainers all serve as deliberate markers of Persian culture. Once again it is clear that this orientation transcended the individual style of a given artist. In this case the artist can be identified as Shamal, whose stylis- tic flexibility has already been demonstrated.71 The similarity of the Timurndma illustrations to those of both the Razm- nama and Shdhndma, as well as their relatively greater distance from the Rdmdyana paintings suggests a date of circa i6i0-I5. Such a date would accommodate the state of the Persianate faces in the Timurndma, which are noticeably more rudimentary than those of the Shdhndma. The presence of two different stylistic modes within the Timurndma zo6. Timfir conquers the kingdoms in Hindustan. ca. i6iO-I5. Timzurndma, f. 86a.

On the other, it might be something more significant, perhaps reflecting a time before the two modes had hardened into well-defined categories. In either case, it should caution us from overstating the factors involved in the selection and use of a particular mode of painting. There is no doubt that 'Abd al-Rahim's workshop made a conscious effort to match certain types of texts to the mode of painting associated with that cul- ture. Yet it appears that these two modes were never construed as discrete and mutually exclusive entities, but rather as sets of features which could be drawn upon either selectively or indiscriminately. For most artists, these modes went beyond the incorporation of a few identifying iconographic features such as costume. They habitually included conventions of composition, palette, and technical finish, but involved figure types only rarely, primarily in the case of female figures. The commonality of figure types employed by various artists contribut- ing to the Tfimzrndma and the total lack of ascriptions in the manuscript make the attribution of paintings especially difficult. At first, one might consider this situation to be a nettlesome, if ultimately surmountable problem of con- noisseurship. In fact, by compelling us to pull back from an approach which dwells on differences between individual artists, and thus exaggerates their importance, it underscores a much more important point: the remarkable styl- istic homogeneity within this part of the Timzurnama, and throughout the ate- lier during much of its existence. This, in turn, reminds us that the notion of style in Indian painting is most useful when applied to collective rather than individual activity. As we will see, this realization holds many implications for how artists and their works were viewed by 'Abd al-Rahhim and his contempo- raries at the beginning of the seventeenth century. 285</page><page sequence="282">Notes I For the relationship of the Mughal copies of the Razmndma, see Seyller, "Model and Copy." 2 A major sale of I5 paintings in the collection of R.B. Beckett occurred at Sotheby's on I9 May 1958, but the largest concentration of Razmnama paintings was formed three years earlier at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York by purchase from Hagop Kevorkian. A few paintings entered public collections such as the Lewis Collection of the Free Library of Philadelphia as early as the 1920s, but most Razmndma paintings passed through the hands of the art dealer Hagop Kevorkian in the 1950s. 3 See Seyller, "Model and Copy," Appendix B. 4 Another Razmndma painting in the Metropolitan Museum of Art (55.121.30) may be at- tributed to him. The two paintings are reproduced in Seyller, "Model and Copy," figs. i, 25. 5 'Abdullah is known from a joint illustration in the ca. I585-90 Khamsa of Nizami in the Keir collection (f. I77b), and an illustration in the ca. I59o British Library Bdburndma (f. 284a). An ascribed painting of a horse and groom in the Musee Guimet (3169, L, b), published in Okada, Miniatures de l'Inde imperiale, no. 38, is clearly related to all these works, and may date to ca. I595. 6 Seyller, "Model and Copy," Appendix B, no. 7. Collection of Catherine and Ralph Benkaim. 7 The painting fragment on which he and the other male attendants appear was reposi- tioned higher when the text panel was excised from the illustration. 8 Two works of similar quality are preserved in the British Museum (I98I 7-3 oi) and the Fondation Custodia (197i-T.3o) (published by Gahlin, The Courts of India, no. 27). 9 Although I have argued for some latitude of quality and style in an artist's work within a given manuscript, I must disagree with the connection proposed by Toby Falk in Paint- ings of Mughal India, p. 39, between the Fazl whose name appears on several stray pages, including one from a slightly repainted page of a dispersed, early I7th-century 'Iydr-i Danish and the Fazl who worked for 'Abd al-Rahim. It is impossible to reconcile the chronology suggested by Falk's proposed date of ca. I6oo with Fazl's cruder, less mature work in the Rdmdyana. Though the painting displays familiar elements such as a braided root system and waterfowl in a rock-lined stream, the forms and colors are far more sub- tle than those seen in any other painting ascribed to Fazl. The extensive and subtle mod- eling of the tree trunk, boar, and rocks is similarly unparalleled in other ascribed works. There remains, of course, the possibility that these paintings postdate those of the Razm- ndma, but such a radical shift in style is very unlikely in light of the consistency of Fazl's work in twenty years of painting. The 'Iyar-i Danish paintings are reproduced in Gahlin, The Courts of India, no. 26; Falk, Paintings of Mughal India, p. 38; the Pan-Asian collec- tion; and Sotheby's sale of 9 July I974, lot 109. 286</page><page sequence="283">10 Bodleian Library MS.

This ascription suggests that the painting is by Kamil rather than by Qasim, as I had proposed earlier. 22 The scene of the composite palanquin appears on f. I3b.

A list of subjects and ascriptions appears in Norah Titley, Miniatures from Persian Manu- scripts (London: British Library Board, 1977), pp. 41-42. Several ascriptions have been misread and should stand as follows: 12b (Madhava), 54a (Kamal), I39b (Shamal), I56b (Kamal), 338b (Bhagavati), 36Ib (Shamal), 387b (att. Shamal), and 402b (att. Banavari). 30 The illustrations are numbered consecutively from i to 91 throughout the manuscript, with a hitherto unnoticed gap appearing between painting nos. 36 and 38 (ff. 2oob and znb). Examination of the text reveals the modern loss of the one illustrated folio between ff. 202 and 203. Folio 202b ends with the passage on vol. 5, p. 2I, verse 228 of the critical edition of the Shahndma by Bertels, and f. 203a begins with 25:284. The 56 missing cou- plets would have filled slightly more than one full page of text, which normally contains 25 lines written in four columns. 31 See Appendix B for a translation of the notes. The Ma'asir al-Umard i: 668-69, recounts that Ilahwardi Khan, who presumably is the same as Ilahwardi Cela (Chela), was previ- ously known by the title Mu'taqid Khan, receiving the title of Ilahwardi Khan only after the death ofJahangir in I627. His brother's name is listed as Mukhlis Khan. Hence, the word "brother" in Ilahwardi Cela's inscription may be a mere term of affection for some- one outside his immediate family. 32 Losty, The Art of the Book in India, pp. I22-23. Beach, The Imperial Image, pp. I52, 154; and Asok Das, Mughal Painting during Jahangir's Time (Calcutta: Asiatic Society, 1978), p. 255, cite this manuscript as belonging to a group firmly associated with 'Abd al- Rahim. Both had dated the manuscript to ca. i600. 33 Losty, The Art of the Book in India, p. 123. 34 This inscription does not match 'Abd al-Rahim's handwriting, which is known from the flyleaf note of the Rdmdyana as well as from many of the inscriptions discussed in Chap- ter 2. Moreover, 'Abd al-Rahim's death in i626 precludes a reference to Jahangir (died i627) as deceased. Four seals on folio ib indicate that the manuscript passed through the hands of 'Arif Din ibn Muhammad Sa'id, 'Adil ibn Hast (?), and Sayyid Khan 1101/1689-90. 35 Original compositions are visible from reverse on ff. i56b, 2znb, and 338b. 36 Folios ii6b, i83b, i89a, 2znb, and 314b. 37 Losty, The Art of the Book in India, p. 123, claims that several verses of the text are painted over on f. 372a. This assertion is controverted by a comparison of the text in the manu- script with the critical edition of the Shahnama. The last verse on f. 37Ib (vol. 7, p. 87, 288</page><page sequence="285">verse I472) is followed properly by the first verse on f. 372b (87:I473), although the catch- word is curiously out of sequence (88:I503). A segment of the horizontal text ruling is vis- ible in the upper left corner of the painting, and one of several diagonal rulings is seen above the bricklayer's head. The scribe left these lines blank, and absorbed the verses intended for them on the reverse of the folio. There are also some signs of change in the painting, specifically in the shape of the forge and the position of the figure wielding a mallet. 38 For example, ff. I28a, I34a, 234b, and 236b. 39 These are ff. I2b, 42b, 65b, 75b, 78b, 84b, Io7b, I39b, I47b, 154b, I97b, 2oob, 269b, 277b, 304b, 3Iob, 343b, 344b, 372a, 385b, 387b, 404b, 4o8b, 4iib, 477b, 483b, 488b, 538b, 548a, 55ib, 555b, 562b, 573b, 578b. Many of these illustrations appear toward the end of the manuscript, including the last seven paintings. 40 When these folios are held up against the light and inspected from the reverse, there is an unequivocal correspondence between areas of varying opacity and certain shapes and colors in the composition. Conversely, when the folios that have had an additional layer of paper attached to the painting field are inspected in this same manner, the entire rec- tangular of the painting field is completely impervious to light. 41 Folios 446b, 517b, 522b, and 542b. 42 Only twenty-three of these folios should have had rubrics. These are if. 42a, 78a, I07a, I39a, I97a, 269a, 277a, 304a, 343a, 344b, 364a, 385a, 387a, 404b, 4o8a, 4iia, 477a, 483a-b, 488b, 548b, 555a, 562a, and 578b. In some cases, the rubric panel appears on the opposite side of the folio. 43 Three exceptions to the otherwise absolute coincidence are ff. i88b, 396a, and 4o0ia. 44 By contrast, the difference in script and paper is readily apparent in the replacement folios of the Berlin Khamsa of Amir Khusraw, which is discussed below. The telltale fea- ture of the BL Shahnama is the length of the text area; this averages I6.5 centimeters in the original folios, and I7.2 centimeters in the replacement folios. Once this feature was established, one could detect subtle differences in the paper, but not in the writing. 45 Two paintings by Qasim in the Ramayana (if. 22ob, 244a) are ascribed in this manner. The ascription off. 288b of the Shahnama appears between the text columns on the lower left, probably because the ascription would be lost against the black carpet and throne base. 46 The date and signature on f. 274a are hidden, thereby confirming the larger ascription written below in the usual manner. 47 Losty, The Art of the Book in India, p.

As I have argued in Chapter i, this is made extremely unlikely by the large num- bers of imperial artists whose names appear in the manuscript. 52 See the Ma'asir-Rahm? 3: I682; and Haq, "The Khan Khanan and His Painters," pp. 626-27. 53 For these paintings, see Seyller, "Model and Copy," Appendix A, nos. 59, 70, and 71. 54 Royal Library, Windsor RCIN 1005039 (formerly B.20), ff. 7a, iib. 55 Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin -Preussischer Kulturbesitz, Orientabteilung Or. fol.

See, for example, ff. 65b and 73b. There are some exceptions to this general rule, such as ff. 7Ia-b in which oblique passages occur for no apparent reason. 58 The only new folio in these sections is f. I95, which also resorts to diagonal passages for the reasons discussed above. The written surface of the replacement folios is slightly larger than that of the original manuscript, i.e., I7 x ii.6 cm. as compared to I6.2 x io.8 cm. 59 See Thomas Lentz and Glenn Lowry, Timur and the Princely Vision (Los Angeles: Los Angeles County Museum of Art, I989), p. 237 for a comparable illumination from a Bustan of Sa'di in Cairo dated I488. At least four paintings in the manuscript are reliably ascribed to Bihzad. 60 A similar rectangular band appears immediately below the text panel in the illustration on folio I47b (fig. 201). 6i When examined under high magnification, several suspicious areas in three detached Khamsa illustrations in the British Museum turned out to be no more than later re- touching. Most notably, the original layer of paper in Figure I98 is visible in the paint- ing's corners, each of which once contained two verses of text. The discrepancies in color between these four patches and the adjacent areas suggests that the text panels were painted over by someone other than Nadim. This practice would have been practically unthinkable in 'Abd al-Rahim's time, but was common in Europe in the early twenti- eth century. 62 They would also have to match exactly the eight remaining lacunae in the text of the manuscript. A complete reconstruction of the manuscript is provided in Appendix D. 63 The damage caused by dampness is evident in smudged text passages or traces of paint on a number of folios which once appeared immediately opposite illustrations, notably ff. 7ia, 73b (fig. 220), i67a, and I83a. The present paintings do not show any sign of de- terioration. 64 My survey of approximately 40 illustrated manuscripts of the Khamsa produced only two such presentation scenes in the Matla' al-Anwdr, neither of which appears at this point 290</page><page sequence="287">in the text. A very similar scene from a dispersed Khamsa written in Balkh (Iran) in I503-04 falls in the prefatory section of the poem before the first of the 20 didactic dis- courses. The painting is reproduced in Glenn Lowry and Susan Nemazee, A Jeweler's Eye: Islamic Arts of the Book from the Vever Collection (Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Insti- tution, I988), no. 36. 65 The paintings are now in the British Museum and are listed in Titley, Miniatures from Persian Manuscripts, nos. 307, 330, and 325. They were formerly thought to belong to a Khamsa of Nizami, but are easily connected to the four large-format paintings still in the Berlin Khamsa by size, writing, and painting style. See Appendix D for a reconstruction of their exact position in the Berlin Khamsa. 66 It is certain that the illustration fell on side B of the folio because the three couplets in the upper right (Hasht Bihisht 57:5-7) precede immediately those at the top off. I35a. The gold ornamentation of the text on f. I35a is also in keeping with this position, for it ap- pears primarily directly opposite illustrated or illuminated pages. Finally, the foliation of the individual books of the Khamsa consistently appears on the recto side. The num- ber 8 between the two columns of text on the page accords exactly with the sequence of folios within the Hasht Bihisht, which begins on folio i28b. 67 A painting of a prince smoking ahuqqa, signed 'amal-i Mushfiq and dated 1016/I607-08, was sold at Sotheby's (London) on I9 October 1994, lot I51. 68 This idea was first proposed by Beach, The Imperial Image, p. I43. 69 The painting, which is now in a private collection in Italy, was first published in Terence McInerney, Indian Painting I525-I825 (London: David Carritt Ltd., I982), pp. 32-33, where it was erroneously considered to be a part of an imperial Shdhndma manuscript. Another subimperial illustration of this same subject is discussed in Chapter I (fig. IO). 70 The manuscript, also known as the Zafarndma (Book of Victories) was sold at Sotheby's on i December I969, lot I96. 152 ff., 26 x I5.7 cm., text area I7.5 x 7.5 cm. The nasta'liq text was written in double columns of I5 lines by Mahmud ibn Ishaq Siyawushani. Be- cause the manuscript's present whereabouts are unknown, I have been able to study the manuscript only from slides, which were kindly provided by Catherine Benkaim and Milo Beach. 71 The long-faced figure opposite TimQr is particularly close to one figure in Shamal's work on f. 5o6a of the Shahndma. The sovereign and garden in that same painting are also re- lated to their counterparts in the Timurndma illustration. 291</page><page sequence="288">VI Border Decorations and Bindings The embellishment of a Mughal manuscript did not end with the addition of illustrations. At this stage in production the workshop usually supplied ab- stract illuminations at prescribed points in the manuscript, such as at the very beginning of the Freer Rdmdyana, above each of the five books of the Berlin Khamsa, or even between the columns of text on folios immediately preceding illustrations. As a comparison of two Berlin Khamsa illuminations executed more than a century apart demonstrates, these illuminations were a very con- servative art form: the geometric medallions within the panels varied only slightly in shape, and the limited range of colors remained extraordinarily con- stant (figs. I92, I94). Somewhat less standard was the decoration of the borders of the folios of a manuscript. In many manuscripts, each folio consists of at least two separate sheets of paper: one, usually white and somewhat translucent, for the text proper, and another, often layered and almost always thicker and coarser, for the borders. Often the borders of only a few folios were singled out for special treatment. The border paper was dyed another color, usually a rich shade of blue or green. The text sheet was then set securely between the two sheets of border paper. Finally, the laminated border was ornamented with floral motifs rendered in gold. The TTmgrndma illustrated for 'Abd al-Rahim exemplifies this combina- tion of unobtrusive decorative features, which was quite common in Islamic manuscripts of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Only the borders around the ten illustrations are decorated. The three folios reproduced here (figs. 205-07) are adorned with representative ornamentation, which normally consists of sparse vegetal sprays, large blossoms and petals, or a dense pattern of sinuous branches and leaves. A few ducks and insects occasionally creep into this decorative scheme. All forms were first sketched freehand, then outlined in gold, and finally modeled lightly with thin washes of gold. The uniform tonality and relatively small scale of these elements have the effect of reducing the assertiveness of any given motif in the overall pattern. The Chester Beatty Library Panj Ganj of Jadm An entirely new aesthetic in border decoration appears in two manuscripts in the library of 'Abd al-Rahim: the Chester Beatty Library Panj Ganj (Five Trea- sures) of Jami, and the Berlin Khamsa of Amir Khusraw.1 The first of these is a well-known Persian poetical text containing five of seven poems written by Jami (I414-92) in homage to the Khamsa of Nizami.2 The layout of the text, 293</page><page sequence="289">which was penned by the renowned Sult.an 'All in 1520, contributes to the sumptuousness of the manuscript. Two of the five books were written in the inner two columns, and the remaining three books were written obliquely in a narrow band wrapped around this. The original illuminators filled the nar- row spaces between these columns of text with delicate floral scrolls, but passed over the triangular wedges created by the angle of the text in the outer band. 'Abd al-Rahim did not inscribe the manuscript personally, but he must have been extremely pleased to acquire this valuable and apparently complete book, which he later presented to Jahangir.3 It is noteworthy, however, that the Khankhanan showed his high regard for the book not by preserving it in its original state, but by ordering his workshop to alter the manuscript's ap- pearance quite profoundly. His artists began by filling in the three spaces left empty on each folio with paintings less than three centimeters in size. The great majority of images depict single flowers, birds, or animals against a sim- ple gold or green background; others reduce the miniature scale still further and set the creatures within rudimentary landscapes. The paintings' purely ornamental nature emulates the decoration of a select group of contemporary imperial manuscripts.4 The initial choice of the subjects of these tiny paintings was an arbitrary affair, usually being completely unrelated to the text, but their subsequent use shows considerable calculation.5 While no image is re- peated exactly, the illuminations are often paired so that an animal such as a jackal or monkey, or a specific type of bird is represented once on each of the two pages of an opening.6 This conception of an opening in the manuscript as a single, coherent visual unit is developed further in the decoration of the bor- ders. The imagery of the Panj Ganj illuminations is more varied than any other manuscript decorated in this manner. Most remarkable of all is the appearance of minuscule figures on a number of folios. These figures include not only the courtiers and hunters who frequent the borders of contemporary imperial manuscripts, but also types encountered only rarely elsewhere, such as blue- skinned ascetics and noblewomen. The figures are always presented in isola- tion, although in at least one case there is a suggestion of interaction between two figures on opposite pages.7 Another painting in the Panj Ganj, a woman derived from an image of the Madonna seated in a European-style chair (fig. 209), recalls the style and inspiration of the earliest known work from the Khankhanan's atelier (fig. 210). Below the ten lines of pseudo-writing on the book held by the muse are Mushfiq's signature and the date I004/1595-96, or two years before the earliest dated Ramayana illustration. The heavy modeling of the muse's blue cloak and its peculiar extension above her shoulder reveal the source of this figure to be a European angel, making these two paintings 208.

This general attribution is confirmed by a marginal painting in the Panj Ganj bear- ing the date of 101O2/1603-04 and an ascription to Mushfiq, whose work appears in the Ramadyana, Khamsa, and Razmndma (fig. 208).8 With its strong contours and attentive glance, Mushfiq's lively goat could easily blend into this scene of a herd serenaded by a shepherd in the Berlin Khamsa (fig. I97). Two recently discovered paintings from the Panj Ganj manuscript also name Mushfiq as the artist, and supply the date of 1015/1606-07. These as- cribed and dated paintings allow us to infer that Mushfiq was responsible for all the paintings in the manuscript, which had begun by I603-04 and was probably completed by I607. The large number of paintings and the four-year span of this assignment may explain Mushfiq's absence from the last section of the Rdmdyana. This additive nature of the two large-format paintings in the Panj Ganj is indicated by their position in the manuscript. The first painting fills the space occupied normally by the central text panel, but which in this case was left blank when the text of the first poem, Subhat al-Abrar, concluded on the previous folio (f. iozb), and that of the fourth poem, Khiradndma-yi Iskandart, commenced on the verso side of the following folio. 'Abd al-Rahim's work- shop seized upon this area as an opportunity to decorate the manuscript still further. Rather than electing to depict a subject entirely unrelated to the text, as 'Abd al-Rahim's artists did at similar points in the Berlin Khamsa, Mushfiq took the unusual step of illustrating an episode recounted in the outer text col- umn, that is, Yusuf greeting a haggard and aged Zulaykhi in a room decorated with wall paintings showing the pair together in happier times (fig. 2II). Be- tween the mural panels, cheetahs pursue and devour deer in a style and scale reminiscent of those of the marginal animals. The artist maintains his predilection for documenting his work by embedding his name and the date in a minor architectural element in the upper left. The second painting, which surrounds the manuscript's colophon and adjoins two tiny panels of a shepherd tending his flock, portrays the venerable poet Jami standing beside a fountain while a gardener works nearby (fig. 212). On the terrace and in the niches be- hind are writing instruments and numerous books inscribed with minute labels: these are the author's assorted works, including the Panj Ganj itself, placed cleverly immediately above the poet's head. Again Mushfiq signs and dates his work, this time on the rightmost dado panel. Given Mushfiq's habit of including discreet references to himself, the bearded poet may well be a sur- reptitious self-portrait. Flanking the opening sarlawh of the Panj Ganj is a tiny painting of a figure kneeling before a book and a penbox (fig. 2I3). If the conventions of bor- der illuminations of imperial manuscripts are any model, it is quite probable that this image at the very beginning of the book is a sly self-portrait of 295</page><page sequence="291">212.

Its style suggests that it too was part of the atelier's embellishment of the manuscript. The illumi- nator made a virtue of the constrictions of the narrow area occupied by the central text. Bringing together the two blue bands that spring from the lower corners of the sarlawh, he fashioned a beribboned fleur-de-lis, whose upward thrust is reiterated by the thin cusped line above it. The organic quality of the forms of this sarlawh and the patches of bright red-orange within it are very reminiscent of the illuminations added to the Berlin Khamsa and the British Library Shahndma by 'Abd al-Rahim's artists (fig. 194).Io Once the triangular paintings and illuminations were completed, the atelier turned its attention to the manuscript's borders, which were probably plain originally. The members of the workshop began by excising the catch- words, which ensure the correct order of the folios when the manuscript is assembled; these small bits of paper would have been put aside until the new borders were finished, when they could be reattached.'" Then 'Abd al-Rahim's artists set about designing and implementing a wholly new decorative scheme for the borders of the Panj Ganj. They aban- doned the static medallions and tendrils found in the Yusuf wa Zulaykhd manuscript for imagery which was aggrandized and invigorated to an un- precedented degree. In one rare example, huge carp swarm about the deep blue borders (fig. 208); in a more common design, a flock of equally imposing cranes vie for insects and space (fig. 213). Although these creatures' bodies are detailed with a light reddish color and a pattern of golden scales or feathers, the com- bination of their large scale and the virtually unarticulated blue background accentuates their contours above all else. The result is a high-key ornamental pattern which overpowers the delicate text and paintings that it encircles. The utter originality of these designs is made clear by comparison with the border decorations of the finest contemporary imperial manuscripts. The first folio of the I595 Bahdristdn of Jami bears an unusually fine sarlawh signed by Mansur and richly decorated borders attributed to Madhava (fig. 2I4).12 Madhava created a pictorial effect in the border, which features time-honored imagery of real and fantastic animals preying upon one another. He did this by establishing spatially credible settings for individual animal encounters and by minimizing unconnected vegetal decoration. Most important of all, he used modulations in the tone and direction of the gold detailing to draw at- tention to form rather than shape. In the sole case in which some of this same combative imagery appears in the Panj Ganj, all similarity between the two borders ends with the motif of a leopard pouncing upon a stag (fig. 2Is). The large scale of the forms is the most obvious difference. A thicket of oversized vegetation engulfs the two beasts in the lower left, and an immense leaf threatens to swallow up a lynx in the upper right. A series of gargantuan lotus blossoms support and shelter the numerous birds in the design. Without outcrops or ridges to mitigate the spatial com- 298</page><page sequence="294">214.

The resulting visual density of this and other examples of border decora- tion in the Panj Ganj is more characteristic of textile patterns than of tradi- tional manuscript borders. Color plays an important role in the design of the Panj Ganj borders. In many folios, 'Abd al-Rahim's artists adopted a simple two-color scheme to heighten the contrast between the motifs and the background. In others, how- ever, they achieved a more complicated visual rhythm through the use of three or more colors. One particularly striking border demonstrates the effectiveness with which an artist could wield color to demolish the solidity of individual forms, thereby alleviating the density of the overall pattern (fig. 216). A few narrow blades of grass, which spread across much of the border, receive the strongest color accent - a dark blue. Yet with this same color the artist picked out details of other elements, such as the tailfeathers of the birds in the upper left, or the series of pinwheel blossoms in the lower right. This choice is quite non-naturalistic: large leaves are arbitrarily divided in half, and flowers are pierced by a solitary dark petal. Conversely, the artist applied a deep red to two 299</page><page sequence="295">lotus blossoms to distinguish the flowers' central hollow from the blue sections that frame it, and used pinks and ochres to differentiate the rest of the design from the moss-green background. The inventiveness of this use of color is highlighted by the completely different treatment of an identical border design elsewhere in the Panj Ganj (fig. 217). Once again, the long blades of grass and a few pinwheel blossoms are rendered in dark blue. But other patches of blue are redistributed freely across the design. The color now alights, for example, on the bodies of two screech- ing birds in the upper border rather than on their tailfeathers. It completely bypasses the third bird in this group, whose upright form counterbalanced the plunging body of his adjacent companion in Figure 216; without this color accent, the creature practically disappears from the design. Similarly, the real- location of color restructures many blossoms, so that a formerly solid lozenge- shaped element becomes a delicate diaphanous one. Changes in the gold de- 216.

The most obvious ex- ample occurs on the blue cup-shaped leaf in the upper corner, where the deli- cate veins of the first border are replaced by a separate floral pattern. The remarkably varied effect produced by this manipulation of color and detail should not obscure the fact that the overall design is absolutely identi- cal in each case. This recurrence is hardly exceptional; in fact, the same design appears no fewer than nineteen times in the Panj Ganj. Such a repetition points inevitably to the use of stencils in these border decorations. This is not alto- gether surprising, for the history of Islamic manuscript illumination offers many examples of stencilled borders. Nonetheless, the borders of 'Abd al- Rahim's manuscripts stand out both for their unusual number of different de- signs, and for what they reveal about the atelier's working methods. The Panj Ganj contains twenty-one different border designs, which are very consistent in imagery and composition. All but three include some sort of combination of foliage and birds, which are featured to the virtual exclusion of any other kind of creature, including human beings. Although the existence of stencils allowed 'Abd al-Ra.him's artists to repeat any border at will, they clearly preferred some designs to others. Two designs, for example, appear only four times in the manuscript, while another occurs as many as forty-six times. The various designs are scattered throughout the manuscript without a dis- cernible relationship either to each other or to the gatherings of folios. Almost without exception, however, they are paired so that a single design and color scheme are maintained on both sides of any given opening. This insistence on the visual coherence of an opening departs from the practice of the imperial workshop, which, as often as not, paired borders bearing geometric medallions with those having animate designs. The Berlin Khamsa of AmZr Khusraw The Berlin Khamsa, which now has about fifty more folios than the Panj Ganj, displays an even more impressive set of borders. The Khamsa displays thirty- one different designs with the same kinds of imagery, density, and color vari- ations as those in the Panj Ganj. This consistency is more than coincidental; indeed, eight of the Khamsa borders are actually identical to those found in the Panj Ganj. That 'Abd al-Rahhim's workshop employed the same stencils in two manuscripts separated by more than a decade confirms our expectations that purely decorative elements would change less rapidly than artists' individual painting styles. The forty-four different borders employed by 'Abd al-Rahim's atelier in the two manuscripts reveal a design process which was unlike that of the im- perial illuminators. To judge from the border illuminations of three of the highest quality imperial manuscripts of the I59os, imperial artists limited their use of stencils to geometric medallions, and rendered the more plentiful and complicated outcrops, animals, and figures without resorting to this de- vice.I3 While artists of the imperial workshop pressed stencils into service to 301</page><page sequence="297">218. Border decoration with birds and flowers. Khamsa of Amir Khusraw. ca. i6io-iI. Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin, Or. fol. I278, f. 23a. 3I.6 x 2I cm. determine the structure and size of an individual medallion, they did not use them to fix the position of these motifs either in relation to each other or within the overall design of the border. In short, they built up the border decorations of contemporary imperial manuscripts from a series of discrete motifs pro- duced from small stencils. 'Abd al-Rahim's artists approached the design of these border patterns in a far more comprehensive fashion. All the elements of a given border were ap- parently cut into a single sheet of paper, which was applied to the whole sur- face of the border. Such a sheet stencil would have compelled the atelier to make the new borders of the Panj Ganj and Khamsa the same size, which might 302 It it</page><page sequence="298">account for the nearly identical dimensions of the two manuscripts.14 Because a full-scale sheet stencil was designed to fill the borders of a regular text folio, any significant expansion of the area normally occupied by the text disrupted some elements in the design. This is evident in two examples from the Berlin Khamsa with illuminations or illustrations which extend into the usual border area. In Figure 194, the upper band of the 'unwdan caused both ducks in the upper margin to be truncated; likewise, the prison tower that soars beyond the confines of the area reserved for the text or a standard illustration afflicted one of the pair of birds in a similar manner (fig. 201). The elongated sarlawh of the Panj Ganj provoked a more radical adapta- tion of an established design (fig. 213). The stencil that provided the basis for this border design is known from thirty-seven other examples in the Panj Ganj and thirteen folios in the Khamsa (fig. 218). These borders are absolutely con- sistent in composition, regardless of whether the stencil was applied to the recto (side A) or verso (side B) of a folio. The stencil was simply reversed so that the broad vertical part of the stencil always fell on the outer margin of the folio. Naturally, all the motifs would also be reversed, and thus would face the op- posite direction. The borders of the Panj Ganj sarlawh deviate from this logical use of a sheet stencil, which ensured the visual symmetry of an opening. The lower border maintains the motifs of the Khamsa border: a swooping bird confronted by a menacing leaf, two long symmetrical fronds rising from a cluster of stems and flowers, and a large crane beating its wings. Yet unlike all the other ex- amples of this design, this first folio of the Panj Ganj kept these motifs ori- ented in the same direction as they were when the stencil was applied to the recto of a folio, when they would normally be the mirror reverse of Figure 218. The process grows still more curious as we follow the design up the outer bor- der. There, we find a flowering plant with three large leaves seen in profile, a bird turned back upon itself, facing right, and a second floral ensemble. This same sequence of motifs appears in the outer border of the Khamsa folio. Yet once again the two sequences are similarly oriented despite their presence on opposite sides of their respective openings. The match between the two bor- ders collapses in the upper corner, not coincidentally about where the diago- nal band of text on the Panj Ganj ends. Finally, although it is obvious that the narrow upper and inner borders of the Panj Ganj bear no resemblance whatso- ever to the corresponding areas of the Khamsa border, we realize only slowly that the left half of the Panj Ganj folio's upper border repeats a plant motif from its lower border. The perplexing discontinuities of this example suggest that the artist broke down the integrity of the stencil in this instance to accommodate the re- duced size of the upper border. Most probably he did this by repositioning the stencil three times so that the design of its lower and outer borders could be transferred separately. Yet this example also opens the possibility that the 303</page><page sequence="299">basic unit of the stencil was not a single full-scale sheet, but four physically separate bands whose designs interlocked easily around the normal text area. Differences in the detailing of these two examples shed some light on how these stencils were actually used. The sheet or strip format of the stencils ensured a uniform configuration of motifs. Using brush and ink, 'Abd al- Rahim's artists quickly traced the cutout shapes of the stencil. But the multi- ple versions that these shapes assume on various folios indicate that the artists were content to coax from the stencils only general forms, which they later nurtured into distinctive species of leaves, insects, and birds. In the lower bor- der of these same two folios, for example, the fronds are alternately thin or thick, and the bird in the lower right has an elongated or stumpy tail. Whereas the lower of the two flowering plants in the outer border of the Khamsa features a thin twisted form and a bird perched on a triangular leaf, the same plant in the Panj Ganj produces a downturned bird grasping a stem, and a leaf with an extra petal where the first bird once stood. Ultimately, then, it was the care and inventiveness that artists brought to the final stage of the process that provided a measure of creativity to even the most tightly prescribed aspect of manu- script illumination. The borders of the Panj Ganj and the Khamsa differ in two interesting technical aspects. The first is that the background color of the Khamsa folios was often applied in a much streakier manner, with long wiping marks still visible. Paradoxically, this is especially true when the background color was light, and would not have required much pigment to produce an opaque field. This kind of technical irregularity continued occasionally in the first layer of color applied to the motifs proper. The dark blue favored in most designs was quite susceptible to bleeding, which can be seen, for example, in the foliage of Figures I97 and 202. The random position of these flawed passages points not so much to later water damage as to careless handling of secondary stencils while the paint was still wet. Second, for most of the Khamsa borders, 'Abd al-Rahim's artists returned to a traditional technique of adding bits of colored paper to supply certain de- tails of the design. The difference between this applique technique and the application of colors by stencil or by hand in the Panj Ganj is a subtle one. The latter approach must have encouraged the use of various colors within the over- all design as well as gradations within individual forms such as a bird's body or wings. By contrast, the more time-consuming technique of the Khamsa probably occasioned a reduction in the number of internal details rendered by patches of colored paper. The patches themselves are stronger and more uni- form in color; indeed, borders with details in two colors, such as Figures I97 and 201oi, are quite exceptional in the Khamsa. The abrupt edges of the patches, which are detectable both physically and visually, further accentuate the pro- nounced shapes and contours of various motifs, such as segments of wings or flowers.15 304</page><page sequence="300">The structure of the Khamsa manuscript provided 'Abd al-Rahim's artists with good reason to abandon stencils altogether in the decoration of cer- tain pages. Without exception, the freehand designs appear on transitional pages or folios between the end of one of the Khamsa's poems and the begin- ning of another. Lacking a text panel at their core, these six folios would have been ill-served by standard border designs, which were organized around the rectangular area customarily reserved for the text. The workshop's response to this challenge demonstrates how little their decorative instincts were constrained by the formalism of stencilled border de- signs. 'Abd al-Rahim's artists treated the panel usually occupied by the text and the borders proper as one continuous field, even when the two areas were distinguished physically by paper and color. The workshop generally did not take advantage of the expanded field to increase the scale of the birds and plants; indeed, the sole exception to this conservative approach is folio 44a of the Khamsa, which features a flying crane whose body and wingspan grow well beyond those of a nearly identical creature found in one border design in the Panj Ganj. The atelier's decorative repertoire changed only slightly in these open-field designs. On one folio (f. I7Ia), a tiny two-story building - a motif known from the Rdmaiyana and the Khamsa - is installed behind a ridge in the upper corner, a position which invokes the notion of a horizon and thus betrays a pictorial origin. But for the most part, these designs are entirely familiar, as ducks and other fowl flit among the usual assortment of plants. Some motifs stray carelessly across the nominal boundary separating the border from the central panel, declaring in both position and pose their physical independence from the stencils that shaped their counterparts in ordinary Khamsa borders. Perhaps because their imagery is so similar, the freehand designs draw at- tention to some fundamental, but easily overlooked features of the stencilled borders. A pair of overlapping cranes in one design points up the total absence of overlapping creatures in the stencilled borders, a feature which underscores the latter's relentless visual clarity (fig. 195). Likewise, the meticulous detail- ing in gold of all forms in the freehand designs contrasts markedly with the simpler detailing, stronger contours, and bright colors of the borders - all of which impart an overwhelmingly decorative quality to the borders. Finally, the sudden appearance of an unusually muted border treatment of an illus- trated folio at this point in the Khamsa comes almost as a relief from the rau- cous assertiveness of the stencilled borders, whose visual dominance over the illustrations is truly a radical innovation within the Islamic tradition. The Berlin Khamsa follows the model of the Panj Ganj in two other areas of illumination. On four folios, 'Abd al-Rahim's artists filled the empty trian- gular spaces created by the obliquely written lines of text with abstract illu- minations.'6 The selection of these particular folios for embellishment with minute colorful patterns was hardly an arbitrary matter. In each case, the illu- minated page immediately precedes an illustration, appearing once on the reverse of an illustrated folio, but more commonly directly opposite the illus- 305</page><page sequence="301">219.

Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin, Or. fol. 1278, f. 73b. 31.6 x 2I cm. tration.17 Hence, aside from the 'unwins, whose position is restricted to the be- ginning of major text sections, the illuminations in the Khamsa functioned exclusively as a rich visual prelude to the paintings. Another decorative interest seen in the Panj Ganj resurfaces twice in the Khamsa (fig. 2I9). Once again, the irregular configuration of text on a page pro- vides the opportunity for one of 'Abd al-Rahim's artists to indulge his predilection for decorative flourishes, this time in animated form. Tiny birds peck and prowl among the triangular crevices in the text area, while aquatic fowl splash about in the two diamond-shaped ponds formed cleverly in the center of the page. Together with the addition of gold around every line of text, these birds assume the same role as the illuminations above, that is, they build up to the decorative climax of an illustration."8 The inherently subordinate re- 306</page><page sequence="302">lationship of two different types of illuminations to illustrations confirms our expectations of the primacy of the latter in the hierarchy of decoration. The Laud Rdgamald A new set of decorative border patterns appears in the Laud Ragamald Album. Surrounding a painting ascribed to Kala Pahara, an artist known from his work in the Rdmdyana, is a border which evokes the composition and style of the bor- ders of the Panj Ganj and Berlin Khamsa (fig. 176). In the lower border, two ducks float by plants with stringy stems and large blossoms; in the upper bor- der, two compact birds are mounted on long graceful stems. Contrary to our expectations, however, this border does not match any of the borders of the Panj Ganj or Khamsa. Nor is its striking color combination, a dull purple over a pale ochre field, found in any other border. This kind of minor innovation within a well-defined decorative aesthetic continues in four other folios in the Laud Rdgamald Album. Two folios (ff. 4ob-4Ia) maintain identical borders across an opening, thereby following the practice seen in the Panj Ganj and Khamsa, but again supplement the known decorative repertoire with the depiction of a simurgh in the upper outer corner, and a fantastic creature below. Another folio (f. 38a) assembles the stock mo- tifs of two running deer and large flying birds into yet another new configura- tion, and renders them in the novel combination of green on red. An unre- markable assortment of birds, flowers, and rocks in the borders of folio z6b constitutes the final addition to the corpus of border patterns in the atelier's holdings, bringing it to a total of forty-eight separate stencils.i9 Bookbindings No book was complete without a binding. Most Islamic manuscripts were bound between two boards covered in thick leather, and had the exposed edge of the book opposite the spine protected by an additional triangular flap at- tached to the back cover. The leather covers were usually decorated with stamped designs of medallions and other patterns drawn from carpets, often in the arrangement of a central lozenge surrounded by smaller corner pieces. Other manuscripts had pasteboard covers adorned with colored ornamental designs or pictorial scenes, presumably designed and executed by painters and then preserved under layers of lacquer. Since the binding was the part of the manuscript most susceptible to damage, it was often replaced when the book was rebound. Unfortunately, the Freer Rdmdyana, the Timzirndma, and the Beatty Panj Ganj are not among the few Islamic manuscripts to have retained their origi- nal bindings. The first two have been rebound in nondescript modern leather bindings, but the Panj Ganj is now adorned with splendid lacquer panels, al- beit ones graced by the typically saccharine birds and flowers of nineteenth- century Persia. The binding of the Berlin Khamsa is a more modest affair. Two nearly full-size lacquer panels with identical floral designs are set into the 307</page><page sequence="303">modern blue leather binding as doublures (the inside face of a book cover). These doublures feature dense arabesques issuing from a central flower. The all-over design and minute detailing of the foliage are very unlike the borders of the Khamsa manuscript, and appear to be eighteenth-century work.20 The British Library Shahndma provides a glimpse of the technical skill and creative ability of'Abd al-Rahim's workshop in bookbinding. Set into an eighteenth-century tooled leather frame, the slightly damaged original covers are decorated in a technique which is relatively unusual for pictorial bindings (figs. 220-21). Its finely detailed images are rendered not in paint, as are the outer faces of the finest contemporary imperial manuscripts, but in gold alone.2' This technique was seen earlier in the freehand designs on the folios be- tween the poems of the Berlin Khamsa, and around the one illustration (fig. 195). Whereas the golden forms on those folios are barely legible against the pinkish paper, here they stand out vividly against the black background of the outer covers and the deep red of the inner covers. The result is a particularly luxurious combination of the developed pictorial settings that we have seen in the illustrations of several of 'Abd al-Rahim's manuscripts and the decorative motifs common in the illuminated borders of the Panj Ganj and Berlin Khamsa. The front cover of the manuscript is filled with a series of vignettes (fig. 220). The foreground is dominated by a scene of a snarling lion poised to attack a water buffalo. The arc of the two large creatures is echoed by an un- dulating riverbank which delimits this first zone of the composition. Beyond the river and its ubiquitous waterfowl, the landscape breaks down into ever smaller visual units. The S-shaped central section includes a cluster of rocks framing a lion in an impossibly twisted pose, a damaged area supporting a pair of gazelles, and a tall, boulder-capped outcrop serving as a pedestal for an ibex. Above this is a trio of swooping birds surrounded by trees and a miniature cityscape. These elements, which connote distance by sky and scale, normally occupy the uppermost stretches of a composition. But here the artist seems to have underestimated the amount of space at his disposal, and brought the com- position to a premature end with the miniature cityscape. Thus he was com- pelled to begin another compositional sequence, which is organized by two in- tersecting ridges spanning the compositional field. The open spaces below are filled with pairs of running deer and oversized rabbits, and three more clusters of buildings and trees are wedged into the narrow strip above. The artist employs much the same imagery on the rear cover (fig. 221). A lion and an Indian bull, now considerably smaller in size, are actively engaged in combat, as if to realize the classic confrontation of beasts commenced on the front cover. Meanwhile, the ibex resumes his perch, a pair of mountain goats pose front to back, and two deer bound away in the upper right. The compo- sition follows a development similar to that of the main part of the front cover, with a towering outcrop spouting a waterfall and a rock-lined river meander- 308</page><page sequence="304">220.

But the artist demonstrates a painter's eye as he tailors the composition to the rear cover by positioning the massive outcrop along the left edge, that is, closest to the spine, and the airier parts toward the open edge of the book. And even as he avoids the pitfall of the front cover by maintaining a relatively constant scale across the composition, he takes pains to fill potential voids with an assortment of trees and fronds. Although the Ma'dsir-i Rahimi singles out Muhammad Husayn and Muhammad Amin for their mastery in bookbinding, these gold-painted scenes were surely created by one of'Abd al-Rahim's painters. In the absence of figures, the rocks and ridges on both covers and the flap are the most dis- tinctive elements. The combination of broad, heavily outlined arcs of the ridges with a series of leaf-ringed rocks is a favorite device of Kamal, who con- tributed many illustrations to the Shdhndma. Yet the closest comparison to these covers is not a painting in the Shdhndma manuscript itself, but a work ascribed to Kamal in the Razmndma, its contemporary counterpart.22 This un- expected correspondence suggests that the Persianate mode used by all of'Abd 309</page><page sequence="305">al-Rahim's artists in the illustrations of the Shdhndma text was not carried through to the decoration of the covers of the manuscript. Painting alone was apparently deemed to possess the general connotative capacity that I have de- scribed; conversely, borders and bindings, whose relationship to the text is in- herently more physical than interpretative, were probably considered pure decoration, and thus incapable of enhancing anything but the material pres- ence of the book. Accordingly, their imagery was more catholic in scope, in- cluding both Persian stmurghs and Indian water buffalo, as well as swarms of birds, and their style was less susceptible to the pressures of self-conscious cul- tural poles. The doublures of the Shahndma present no such conceptual difficulties, for they clearly enlist a series of discrete motifs drawn exclusively from the repertoire of motifs employed in border decoration (fig. 222). The most obvi- ous of these is a large crane with outstretched wings bending to stab at the wa- ters that it patrols. This very same motif appears in one of the most commonly used borders in the Panj Ganj and Berlin Khamsa, albeit in a more central position in the field and without a developed pond as a setting (fig. 202). The tall standing crane opposite and the two birds clinging to large blossoms above are excerpts of still other border patterns in these manuscripts. The isolation of individual motifs here parallels their use in the decoration of the folios at the end of each poem of the Khamsa. Once again, the use of a stencil is a possibil- ity, though the selection of individual motifs from the well-established deco- rative sequences of separate sheet patterns would be yet a third manner in which these known stencils were adapted. It seems more likely, however, that in both these cases and in the amalgam of equally familiar images above, the motifs are really freehand versions of a stock repertoire of birds and plants created by members of 'Abd al-Rahim's atelier. Indeed, the appearance of a slightly modified pair of cranes, rendered in a greatly reduced scale in the lower right of the rear cover of the manuscript, suggests that painters and illumina- tors not only shared shared a common vocabulary of motifs, but also set about using it in similar ways. Artists such as Kamil and Muhammad Amin, who was probably reponsible for the borders of the Panj Ganj and the Khamsa, both adapted a growing set of forms and motifs developed by the atelier in their work, arranging in endlessly varied combinations visual units as large as river- ine settings or as small as a single crane. In the end it was the formal conven- tions of their ultimate destination - whether painting, border, or cover - that probably dictated such practical matters as the addition of figures and the use of stencils, and determined more generally the degree of complexity and co- herence that the artist was expected to achieve. 222.

Suhbat al-Abrdr begins in the inner section off. ib; Tuhfat al-Ahrdr commences on the outer band of the same folio. Yusuf wa Zulaykhd starts in the outer band of text on f. 46b and ends on f. i45b, where it yields to Saldmdn wa Absal. The illuminated head- ing of the poem of Khiradndma-yi IskandarZ, which was the folio missing between ff. I02 and 103 in the manucript, was sold at Christie's (London) on i8 October I994, lot 9, and is now in the Benkaim collection. 3 See Appendix E for a translation ofJahangir's note acknowledging receipt of the manu- script in I624-25. 4 Useful comparisons may be drawn to the Royal Asiatic Society Gulistdn of Sa'di (Ms. Pers. 5) dated I582-83, the Chester Beatty Library Diwin of Hafiz (P. I50) of ca. I6oo, and the "Bute" Diwdn of Hafiz dated I604-05 (BL Or. 14139). 5 One exception to this general rule is the figure of Yusuf, identified by his courtly dress and flaming halo, on f. 5oa, whose outer band of text contains Jami's poem of Yusuf wa Zulaykha. 6 An opening is a term used to indicate two pages of opposing folios, e.g., 36b-37a. 7 A courtier on f. 36b receives the gesture of obeisance of a supplicant on f. 37a. 8 I am grateful to Catherine Benkaim and Linda Leach for bringing this date to my atten- tion. 9 See Losty, "The 'Bute Hafiz' and the development of border decoration in the manuscript studio of the Mughals," Burlington Magazine 127, no. 993 (December I985): 855-71. 10 See especially ff. 2b and 3a of the BL Shahndma. These forms may be contrasted with the much more structured ones of the original illumination of the Berlin Khamsa (fig. 192). Additional illuminations appear in the outer band of text on ff. Ia, 46b, and I45b of the Panj Ganj. II Catchwords, which are the first word or two of the text on the following page, are always written in the lower margin of side B of a given folio. A desire to preserve even snippets of Mir 'Ali's writing probably motivated the atelier to remove the catchwords in this de- liberate manner. Yet the confusion that inevitably occurred when the catchwords were physically removed from the folios must have undermined their original function. In- deed, some were lost and were rewritten directly on the new borders. 12 Bodleian Library, Ms. Elliott 254. See Losty, The Art of the Book in India, no. 64, and idem, "The 'Bute Hafiz."' The signature of Mansur, a painter who became prominent under Jahangir, appears at the bottom center of the sarlawh proper. The 27 ascriptions in the 311</page><page sequence="307">borders of the Baharistdn make it possible to attribute most border designs in this man- uscript and its immediate contemporaries. There is no reason to believe that this Mad- hava is the same artist whose work appears in the I616 Shdhndma. 13 The 1595 Bodleian Bahdristan of Jami, the 1595 BL Khamsa of Nizami, and the 1597-98 Walters Art Gallery Khamsa of Amir Khusraw. 14 Khamsa folios measure 31.6 X 2I cm., with a text area of 16.2 x io.8 cm. These dimensions compare closely to those of the Panj Ganj, with measurements of 32.2 x 20.1 cm. and I7.4 x 9 cm. respectively. There is no discernible difference in the completeness of the bor- der designs. 15 This same applique technique appears unexpectedly in the wings of the birds in Fazl's illustrations of the Hindola Rdga (fig. I69). i6 Folios I46b, I47a, and I52a-b. 17 The illumination on f. I47a is linked to the illustration on the folio's reverse (fig. 201). i8 The orange stains on the upper, inner, and lower sections of the text indicate the onetime presence of an illustration immediately opposite. This deficiency is corroborated by a gap in the text, which describes the arrival of an old woman before Shirin as she and Khus- raw lie unconscious. 19 A drawing in the Indian Museum, Calcutta (RS 553) may be another stencilled product of 'Abd al-Rahim's atelier. It measures 40 x 25.5 cm., making it slightly larger than those used in the Panj Ganj and Khamsa manuscripts. 20 See David James, Qur'ans and Bindings from the Chester Beatty Library (London: World of Islam Festival Trust, I980), no. 100, for a comparable binding. 2I For example, the I595 British Library Khamsa of Nizami and the 1597-98 Walters Art Gallery Khamsa of Amir Khusraw.

The ridge of Figure I73 also bears a strong resemblance to those of the covers. 312</page><page sequence="308">VII 'Abd al-Rahim as a Patron The elaborate paintings, illuminations, and borders of the seven manuscripts discussed in this study make it clear that the acquisition, restoration, and pro- duction of fine copies of various texts by 'Abd al-Rahim's library establish- ment were means for the Khankhanan to indulge his exceptionally keen in- terest in poetry and literature. But does this adequately summarize the nature of'Abd al-Rahim's patronage of art? Is there reason to believe that he ever con- sidered paintings to be something more than the mere material embellish- ment of the written word - the true realm of human intellectual and creative energies? By way of addressing this fundamental issue, let us review the context in which images appeared, the selection of texts to be illustrated, and the rela- tionship of 'Abd al-Rahim with his team of painters. First, although most of the images we have examined fall within the purview of manuscript illustra- tions, the presence of twelve independent paintings in the Laud Ragamdld Album and the existence of two others by the Khankhanan's artists leave lit- tle doubt that 'Abd al-Rahim valued paintings in their own right. But for what kinds of qualities? These images, which are greatly outnumbered by cal- ligraphic specimens in the Laud Rdgamald Album, include such prosaic scenes as a hawk attacking a duck, a nude woman, and a woman with a musical in- strument (fig. I74). These works offer no obvious intellectual meaning in themselves and, aside from the scene of Hamza slaying a dragon (fig. 22), lack any reference to literature, which customarily provides a crucial layer of mean- ing. In this context, paintings were probably viewed primarily as marvels of craftsmanship. As objects of aesthetic contemplation, then, paintings of such obviously banal subjects would resemble the isolated aphoristic phrases that generally form the substance of calligraphy: frequently trite in themselves, they were elevated to the level of art primarily by their sheer technical virtu- osity. The independent images in the Laud Rdgamdald Album rarely rise above traditional subject matter, with only a scene of an anthropomorphic swing representing a uniquely Indian theme. We see only the barest trace of the new genres pioneered in the imperial atelier at the end of the sixteenth century, such as portraits or natural history paintings, and nothing of the court's sophisticated adaptation of European symbolism of the second decade of the seventeenth century. The very traditionalism of these stray subjects is testi- mony that 'Abd al-Rahim's workshop lagged behind its imperial counterpart in visual imagination as well as in technical skill. 313</page><page sequence="309">What does 'Abd al-Rahim's choice of texts to receive illustrations tell us about the direction and depth of his interest in the visual arts? 'Abd al-Rahim's range of interests in visual matters appears to have been much more limited than his literary taste. His avid sponsorship of contemporary poets notwith- standing, no contemporary text was adorned with paintings. Likewise, for all the poets who composed qasidas in 'Abd al-Rahim's honor, no supplicant painter was ever moved to fashion a visual tribute to his prospective benefac- tor. And despite the examples of the illustrated versions of the Akbarndma and Jahaingirndma, 'Abd al-Rahim refrained from commissioning paintings to ac- company the description of his own life and triumphs in the Ma'dsir-i Rahimi.' Courtly protocol cannot have been more than a very minor factor in 'Abd al- Rahim's reticence to use pictorial means to celebrate himself, for it did not curb the conspicuous egotism of the unprecedented full-length biography that he alone among the nobility presumed to commission. Nor did it restrain an- other important Mughal noble, Zafar Khan, from using images for this self- promoting purpose about twenty years later, when he ordered a dozen illus- trations added to a volume of verses which he composed to record his life.2 In short, although 'Abd al-Rahim maintained a large group of painters within his library establishment, he was generally content to experience paintings through the mediation of literature, and displayed a relative indifference to the power of images in their own right. Most of 'Abd al-Rahim's illuminated manuscripts were copies of texts often illustrated in the Islamic world. Two of the best-known texts in his li- brary, the Shdhnama and the Khamsa of Amir Khusraw, already contained paintings at the time they were obtained by 'Abd al-Rahim, and so do not manifest a conscious decision on his part to add images. In both cases, 'Abd al- Rahim's true exercise of patronage was his tacit approval of his workshop's re- furbishment of these defective two manuscripts in a careful but ambitious manner, even to the point of covering over the older illustrations or adding dedicatory or decorative paintings where no images had been. The former course of action in particular reflects 'Abd al-Rahim's high estimation of the skill of his own artists, as well as some disregard for the merit of paintings from an earlier time. The Khankhanan was not unique among Mughal patrons in this respect, for even undamaged manuscripts were frequently retouched by Mughal painters, especially during Jahangir's reign.3 'Abd al-Rahim's workshop also supplied illustrations to the Timgrnama, a somewhat less common historical text. Once again, his artists filled in spaces originally reserved for paintings and left vacant when the manuscript was written some ninety years earlier by Mahmud ibn Ishaq Siyawushani, a notable calligrapher whose writing is among the examples collected in the Laud Ragamala Album. With the number and subjects of the illustrations prede- termined, the atelier had little choice as to the type of scenes they produced, but somewhat more latitude in the style they selected. The Panj Ganj pre- sented a different situation. As was the case with the Yisuf wa Zulaykhd man- 314</page><page sequence="310">uscript given to Jahangir, the remarkable renown of the calligrapher Sultan 'All probably played a major role in the initial decision to summon artists to embellish the Panj Ganj manuscript. The blank triangular spaces along its outer text column were too small to accommodate any sort of narrative illus- tration, but they did arouse the decorative instincts of the atelier, which pro- duced innocuous paintings of individual birds and animals alongside the more ornamental designs of the borders. The one truly innovative aspect of 'Abd al-Ralhim's patronage of the vi- sual arts was his sympathetic response to Akbar's directive to have copies made of important Hindu texts in order to promote religious and social goodwill. The Khankhanan was not the sole member of the nobility to own such mater- ial, but he was in a unique position to implement this policy actively. Unlike the Islamic texts discussed above, these illustrated copies of the Persian Rdmdyana and the Mahdbhdrata were new commissions, which meant that 'Abd al-Rahim or a member of his library staff was free to choose which episodes would receive the emphasis of illustrations. In this respect, however, the Khankhanan's workshop proved to be quite unoriginal, adhering closely to the cycle of images of the presentation copies of the two texts, which are now inJaipur. This general imitation of specific im- perial models may have been perceived as a form of flattery, but it was almost certainly instigated as a practical means of expediting the design phase of'Abd al-Rahim's two Hindu projects. Curiously, the imperial artists who illustrated the I594 Rimdyana and the I598-99 Razmndma did not avail themselves of this contrivance, though they must have had easier access to the presentation copies. Yet 'Abd al-Rahim's artists did not extend this derivative relationship to the two Jaipur manuscripts beyond the subjects of the illustrations. This sug- gests that a member of the library took note of the episodes that had been il- lustrated in the Jaipur manuscript, and conveyed this information to the scribe, who systematically interrupted his writing of the text at the prescribed points in the narrative. Apart from Ghulam 'All, who had been involved on a limited basis in the illustration of the imperial Raimdayana, 'Abd al-Rahim's artists probably had little or no opportunity to refer to the imperial illustra- tions themselves. Their own visual formulations of the various episodes are generally simple but fresh, and show no formal debt to the paintings of the Jaipur Ramdyana and Razmndma. That 'Abd al-Rahim twice sponsored a man- uscript with a series of illustrations parallel to that of Akbar's own copy demonstrates that the cycle of images in a given Mughal manuscript is an un- reliable indicator of a patron's aesthetic interests. 'Abd al-Rahim's one foray into Indian subject matter without an imper- ial visual precedent as a model was his partial set of Rdgamald paintings. These allusive paintings, which represent a highly codified Indian system of emo- tional states, are consonant with the Khankhanin's own poetical interest in Hindi. 315</page><page sequence="311">More revealing than the mere selection of Indian subjects is the visual in- terpretation given to them by 'Abd al-Rahim's painters, who certainly em- phasized the entertaining narrative aspect of the stories of the Ramaya.na and Razmndma, just as their imperial counterparts had done before them. Like artists everywhere, they preferred to adapt a stock compositional type to the episode at hand, grafting only as many details on to the main structure of the painting as was necessary. For the Rdmdyana and Razmndma, they enlisted minor iconographic features - costumes, architecture, and the occasional iden- tifying attribute of a divinity - as cues to the Indian setting of the action. This approach had been employed effectively by imperial artists, who imparted a flavor of geographical and temporal remoteness to similar scenes in the Jaipur Rdmdyana and the dispersedJami al-Tawdrikh merely by supplying the pro- tagonists with the floral crowns of Hindu kings in one case and the feathered headdresses of Mongol chieftains in the other. Yet 'Abd al-Rahim's artists used more subtle means as well to distin- guish their illustrations of Indian subjects from those dedicated to Persian themes. As I have demonstrated, they almost always selected a simplified com- position, a strong palette, and a coarse painting technique for indigenous In- dian subjects, and reserved their most ambitious compositional and coloristic arrangements for Persian literary texts. These sets of features constitute noth- ing less than two distinct modes of painting. Their consistent and simultane- ous use by virtually the entire workshop is the strongest indication yet that in 'Abd al-Rahim's circle, painting style was considered a meaningful element, that it was understood to have the capacity to lend a resonance of intellectual association to the raw imagery of illustration. How did these two modes of painting come to be associated with Indian and Persian cultures in 'Abd al-Rahim's library? There is only a semblance of this association in imperial painting. It can be discerned in the fact that the most luxurious imperial Mughal manuscripts of the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries are invariably Persian poetical texts. Even so, more rou- tinely ornamented copies of this literary genre were produced as well. Instead, it seems that the imperial atelier varied its work from manuscript to manu- script largely by the selection of talent assigned to the project and the amount of time artists were directed to invest in their paintings, rather than by any pre- scribed correspondence of mode to subject. The Jaipur Ram,ayana and Razm- nama manuscripts, for example, cannot be distinguished stylistically from most illustrated copies of Mughal historical texts of the I58os and 159os, and stand out primarily by virtue of their unusual imagery. The association of certain modes of painting with subjects defined pri- marily in geo-cultural terms becomes more pronounced in the more limited number of manuscripts produced for 'Abd al-Rahim. Although the inclusion of Hindu literature among the texts to be acquired and illustrated by his li- brary should be seen as part of a general trend in Popular Mughal painting, 'Abd al-Rahim's personal interest in Indian culture surely fostered the accep- 316</page><page sequence="312">tance of an Indian visual aesthetic as well. This phenomenon was also the re- sult of broader historical developments. As new patrons exhausted the supply of former imperial artists, they recruited Indian artists whose only training was in indigenous Indian styles. The Cleveland .Tgtndma is testimony that these two kinds of artists had coexisted briefly in the imperial atelier, but by the time 'Abd al-Rahim's workshop was formed a generation later, the tremendous im- balance between the two groups had moderated considerably, and the assimi- lation of the latter was no longer automatic. Exposure to this great but alien tradition, as it was represented by artists like Fazl, seems to have brought about a new appreciation of the Indian style as an aesthetic alternative, much as ethnic and naYve art have been embraced enthusiastically by the West in the late twentieth century as complements to mainstream artistic traditions. Most of 'Abd al-Rahim's artists were fully capable of working in both manners, though some were clearly more accom- plished in one or the other. Yet since in Islamic culture a painter's fame most often rested on his ability to produce exquisite work on a scale minute beyond belief, it is reasonable to conclude that the notion of two modes was bound up with a confident sense of cultural superiority, with the refined Persian aesthetic traditions of the majority of the Mughal ruling class overshadowing the rougher, more vigorous ones of their Indian subjects. Finally, we must admit that only the unusually detailed documentation on 'Abd al-Rahim's manu- scripts allows us to recognize the deliberate use of two distinct modes of paint- ing for what it is; lacking this, we may well have continued to overlook the coexistence of manuscripts illustrated in these two manners, and propose dif- ferences in chronology, artists, and patron to account for their disparity. Did 'Abd al-Rahim himself share this understanding of style? Our ear- lier discussion of the staff and holdings of 'Abd al-Rahim's library has made it clear that 'Abd al-Rahim rarely even noted the presence of paintings, let alone commented upon them directly. Thus we are forced to approach this issue somewhat more broadly by examining the nature of'Abd al-Rahim's interac- tion with his artists. For this, we must rely on his hagiographer, and return once more to the biographical sketches of five painters in the Ma'dsir-i Rahim. Having studied all seven of'Abd al-Rahim's illustrated manuscripts, we come to the realization that 'Abd al-Baqi's selection of artists as being worthy of discussion probably would not correspond to our own, which normally would be determined by the artists' prolificness or proficiency. To judge from extant visual evidence, these five artists - Nadim, Bihbud, Mushfiq, Madhava, and Ibrahim - played relatively minor roles in the actual execution of paint- ings for 'Abd al-Rahim. The chronicler does not seem especially concerned with a description of the current state of affairs in the library, for he focuses his attention on Nadim and Ibrahim, both of whom he describes as deceased, rather than on the more familiar figures of Fazl, Qasim, and Banavari - all of whom were active at the time when the Ma'adsr-i RahJmi was written. More- over, he defies our expectations that prior experience in the imperial atelier 317</page><page sequence="313">would accord an artist greater prestige within 'Abd al-Rahim's atelier, and that this would be reflected in his remarks about that institution. Of the seven former imperial artists, 'Abd al-Baqi mentions only Ibrahim, and then pri- marily because of his administrative position.4 Thus, his abbreviated list of painters seems completely arbitrary, and in the end tells us little about 'Abd al-Rahim's own view of his artists. This situation should caution us about the validity of reading a similar list of artists in the A'in-i Akbari as a hierarchical ranking of talent in the imperial atelier. How involved was 'Abd al-Rahim with his artists? One quality which 'Abd al-Baqi extols repeatedly in the Ma'asir-i Rahimi is the transforming effect that 'Abd al-Rahim had on all who came into contact with him. He often invokes the metaphor of alchemy to explain how the "copper of the talent" of a certain poet or artist became gold under the nurturing eye of the Khankhanan.5 Both Nadim and Mushfiq, for example, are said to have been trained personally by 'Abd al-Rahim, and were raised up to their level of mas- tery by his attention. Such a fruitful and harmonious relationship between artist and patron would probably be the ideal of every patron, not only because it would be likely to produce works suitable to his own purposes, but also because it would in- evitably and properly direct glory to himself. The attractiveness of this conceit certainly did not escape the notice of Islamic court eulogists, who were always quick to blur the distinction between political aspiration and fact. Thus it is no accident that this kind of tutelary relationship between patron and artist becomes a virtual leitmotif in the brief contemporary accounts of Mughal pa- tronage. Abu al-Fazl, for example, claims that Akbar had a similar effect on his artists: Among the forerunners on this high road of knowledge is Mir Sayyid 'All of Tabriz. He had learnt a little from his father. When he obtained the honour to serve His Majesty and thus gained in knowledge, he became renowned in his profession and bountiful in good fortune. Next there is Khwaja 'Abd al-Samad, the shirfn qalam (lit., sweet pen/brush) of Shiraz. Though he knew this art before he joined the royal service, the trans- muting glance of the king has raised him to a more sublime level and his images have gained a depth of spirit.6 Jahangir, too, offers the hackneyed comparison of his artist Abu al-Hasan to the legendary Bihzad, and assumes direct responsibility for the increase in his artistic skill: At present he has no rival or equal. If at this day the masters 'Abd-u-l- IHayy and Bihzad were alive, they would have done him justice...My connection was based on my having reared him. From his earliest days up 318</page><page sequence="314">to the present time I have always looked after him, till his art has arrived at this.7 As the strong similarities in language used to describe the relationship be- tween three different patrons and their artists make clear, these contemporary remarks are little more than formulaic expressions of patronage, and should not be taken literally. One would be misguided to construe them as evidence that 'Abd al-Rahim - or any other Mughal patron - was directly and person- ally involved with his artists. Is there any evidence that 'Abd al-Rahim was truly attentive to the craft of painting? A charming anecdote in a late seventeenth-century compendium of poets, the Kalimdt al-Shu'arad, has been cited to demonstrate the Khan- khanan's appreciation for the subtleties of painting: They say that a painter showed a painting of a woman bathing and a ser- vant rubbing the sole of her foot with a pumice-stone. Having drawn up the lead horseman, he (the Khan Khanan) took one glance at the paint- ing, which he put on the palanquin, and went to the private chamber of the king. Upon returning, he summoned the painter and ordered that five hundred rupees be given to him. The painter said, "My picture is not worth five rupees, but I have employed one artistic device in it. If the nawab displays an understanding (wdqif) of my work, I will accept." [The Khan Khanan] said, "The artistic device is that there is a pleasant sensa- tion on the foot when it is rubbed with a pumice-stone, and you have shown a trace of that in the face in this painting." The painter went around the palanquin of that connoisseur (daqiqa-ydb).8 Taken at face value, this story seems to offer convincing proof that 'Abd al- Rahim was fully aware of the painter's subtle evocation of innocent sensory pleasure, and suggests that he was acutely sensitive to other kinds of painting as well. Yet this anecdote is a much-travelled one. Brijinder Nath Goswamy relates that a similar expression of aesthetic appreciation enjoyed widespread popularity in the Punjab Hills, where a painter's slight at a wealthy raja's per- functory response to his work is later assuaged by the properly cultivated re- sponse of an anonymous goldsmith.9 Rather than describing a specific action of a historical figure, then, this anecdote of connoisseurship should be regarded as yet another imaginative, ahistorical tribute to 'Abd al- Rahim's exemplary qualities, which were already the stuff of legend. From the vantage point of our own culture, which is so utterly deluged with visual information, it may be difficult to imagine a time when the visual arts held a much less conspicuous position in society, and did not routinely provoke a discriminating response from even the most cultivated patron. Yet once we set aside our own modern preconceptions about art, we can admit that this may indeed have been the situation at the Mughal court at the beginning 319</page><page sequence="315">of the seventeenth century. Contemporary Persian and Mughal historical ac- counts yield few statements about painting, and together these offer an aston- ishingly impoverished critical vocabulary. Almost without exception, these observations address an artist's sheer technical skill, which most often is mea- sured by his ability to render many forms in a small space, such as on a metaphorical grain of rice.'0 The rare remarks that go beyond this level are gen- erally those of other calligraphers or painters. This suggests that in the Mughal world, paintings were held up to more complex aesthetic judgment only by those who were intimately familiar with the actual technique of painting, that is, painters and their supervisors. Patrons and other viewers revelled in the ma- terial splendor of art, and were content to laud the incomparably talented artists at their disposal, or to note occasionally the subjects depicted. But with- out a developed language to assess art and to describe the changes they might wish to see, they could exert influence over the creative process only by very indirect means. They might reward an individual artist with special remuner- ation, for example, but such a gesture would still leave it to the painter to de- cide which qualities had elicited the patron's appreciation. Thus, painters would inevitably look to one another for ideas which they could use to improve their work still further, and thereby continue to benefit from their patron's favor. 'Abd al-Rahim was not alone in the relative detachment that he dis- played toward the atelier. His support of as many as twenty-one painters over a period of some thirty years leaves no doubt that painting was an integral part of his cultural interests. He probably applauded the finest work his workshop could produce on manuscripts which he held most dear by reason of their sub- ject and calligraphers, and may well have been led to appreciate the fact that a suitable painting style had been employed. But it is almost certain that he had nothing to do with the conception of these two modes in painting. This dis- tinction surely originated in the workshop itself, where artists were constantly involved with the formal elements of painting, and collectively honed their use. 320</page><page sequence="316">Notes I TheJahangirndma is discussed in Beach, "Jahangir'sJahdngir-Nama," pp. 224-34; and idem, The Imperial Image, pp. I72-73. 2 See Losty, The Art of the Book in India, no. 83. 3 See Seyller,"Recycled Images: Overpainting in Early Mughal Art," in Sheila Canby, ed., Humayun's Garden Party.

God is almighty. (medallion) It was completed by the kitabkhdna of Nawab Khankhanan 'Abd al-Ra.him ibn Khankhanan Muhammad Bayram Khin in the year 1026 [I617]. In the year I012 [I603-04], Mir Baqi of Samarqand brought from Gujarat several folios of this rare Khamsa, whereupon they were obtained. I asked him about the rest of the book. After much inquiry about the remainder of the book, it was ascertained that a book with several other fo- lios was in the possession of Mirza 'Abd al-Malik, who generously presented it to me. We took it and the remainder of the book from him. After asking many questions, we heard from every- one that everyone in Gujarat had some folios. Mir Baqi was sent again with two or three thou- sand rupees so that he could buy whatever he wanted from whomever had [some folios], and thus he put his hands on several folios. In that way it happened by divine grace that all these five books were acquired save for several pages which had been lost. Among these [people], one person had fourteen or fifteen folios, thinking that if he brought them himself with a few other books ... set out from Agra. Those were the days when this humble servant, who together with Mahabat Khan was accused through the artifices of slanderers, had gone to court and thence to petition the king. Because my intentions were just and I went in truth and in a solicitous man- ner, I appeared in the court of His Majesty Sulayman Makani (Akbar) and was delivered from those afflictions. If the sword of the world should move from its place, it would not cut even a vein unless God so willed it. I have seen the meaning of this. In brief, the man who had brought the folios kept bringing others ... He brought those ten or twelve folios. Anyhow, this book ... whose writing is by Mawlana Sultan 'Ali and whose paintings are by Bihzad, was complete ... The paintings that had fallen out were [ordered to be] restored, and those other folios ... too which had fallen out, Muhammad Mfu'min was ordered to rewrite. The binding was tooled in gold and the borders were embellished. The work was done in ten or eleven years so that it reached completion on the date I026 [I617]. Written by 'Abd al-Rahim son of Muhammad Bayram, may the two of them be forgiven. Value I,200 [rupees].

I278 Each book of the Khamsa was originally foliated separately in the narrow space between the cen- tral columns of text. At the time they refurbished the manuscript, 'Abd al-Rahim's librarians added a new set of folio numbers to the upper left corner of the recto side of each folio, num- bering all five poems of the manuscript consecutively. Information from these two sequences indicates that the refurbished Khamsa manuscript had 245 folios, or twenty more than the pre- sent manuscript. From the number of verses missing at each lacuna, we are able to determine how much of each of these folios was occupied by text. This, in turn, allows us to establish that fourteen of the folios were illustrated, for what had been a total of twenty-one paintings in the manuscript. In many cases, minute fragments of paint on the facing page even indicate which side of the folio was illustrated. One peculiarity in the manuscript is especially noteworthy. A gap of forty lines of text and two titles between ff. II9 and 120 coincides with a disruption in the internal numbering sequence of the poem. Together these features become irrefutable evidence that a folio is missing at this point in the manuscript. Yet the overall foliation added in 'Abd al-Rahim's library is uninter- rupted, and the borders on both sides of the opening match as usual. This strongly suggests that the atelier overlooked this loss when they restored the manuscript. Other disturbances in the manuscript are certainly modern. Lacunae in the atelier's foliation indicate that decorated folios without text were excised from the manuscript at the end of sev- eral poems, i.e., at ff. 95/96 (original folio no. 105), ff. 127/I28, (original folio nos. 138-139), and after f. i66a, which is out of place and should follow f. I70 (original folio no. I88). Folio 224a (original folio no. 243) is also out of order, and belongs after modern folio 222.
