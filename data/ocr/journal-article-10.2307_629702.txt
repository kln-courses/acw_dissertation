[Diss.] Ioannina: University. 1979. Pp. xxxvi+ 219, 39 plates, [i] map, [i] plan. Price not stated. This dissertation is a very valuable compilation of data on the worship of female deities in ancient Epirus. It is an extremely useful volume, which provides a good basis for further study of the badly neglected subject of Epirote religion-itself a part of the also somewhat neglected study of local Greek cults outside the main centres. However, it must be said, the discussion of this material should be read with considerable caution. To begin with the more sophisticated methodologi- cal errors before considering the cruder and more obvious ones. The book's structure is symptomatic of, and reflects, the author's somewhat faulty understand- ing of the ways in which religious systems work. It is organized into sections each of which deals with one goddess, and each section is further divided into subsections each of which deals with the worship of that goddess in an individual Epirote city. But even in these subsections the cult of each goddess in each city is treated in complete isolation, not in connection with the other deities of the city's pantheon; T.-S. only mentions other cults when it is necessary for her argument to refute a particular point (as, for example, her mention of the cult of Zeus Soter at Kassope). This organization takes no account of the fact that the divine personality of each deity is shaped and defined also by his or her relationships to the other deities of the local pantheon to which he or she belongs. Thus, it would have been more profitable to organize the material and discussion by cities, and consider each of the goddesses of each city within the framework of the city's whole pantheon- especially in connection with the other goddesses; and to consign the comparative treatment of the different Epirote cities' cults of a given goddess to the final stage of the investigation. At a much cruder level, the whole discussion is informed by a somewhat naive and simplistic percep- tion of Greek religion, in which the quest for 'chthonic deities' seems to be a major aim. (It is symptomatic of this approach-or rather lack of one--that the book does not contain a single reference to the works of Burkert, Vidal-Naquet, Vernant or Detienne, which have transformed the study of Greek religion.) The author operates with an implicit-and obviously falla- cious, as well as outdated-developmental model of religion, in which the 'chthonic' religious dimension- which in any case she overstresses-is assumed to belong to an early stage of religious development (see e.g. p. 41 on the cult of Artemis in Ambrakia). However, even within her own terms of reference, the author's notions of what constitutes evidence leave much to be desired. For example, in what way can a bronze mirror (of possibly Corinthian manufacture) with an anthropomorphic handle, which may perhaps represent Aphrodite, be considered evidence for an archaic/classical cult of Aphrodite in Apollonia (63)? There almost certainly was such a cult, but the mirror, whether or not it represents Aphrodite, is not evidence for it. More generally, T.-S. sometimes seems to fail to distinguish artistic influence from cultic influence. Her notions of what constitutes a valid argument are also questionable, and the discussion is shot through with unwarranted assumptions and unsupported speculation. However, we should be grateful to T.-S. for bringing together, and drawing our attention to, this interesting material-even though in a few cases one would have wished for a somewhat more up-to-date awareness of the state of the subject (see for example her remarks (91- 2) on the Mycenaean ti-mi-to, and compare M. G&amp;rard- Rousseau, Les mentions religieuses dans les tablettes myc6- niennes (1968); and on the Knossos ti-mi-to (KN Am 821) see Minos 9 1[968] 184-6; J. L. Melena, in A. Heubeck and G. Neumann eds., Res Mycenaeae [1983] 259). The book's faults must not be allowed to obscure its usefulness and value as a basis for further research in this area.
