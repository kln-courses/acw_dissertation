<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Greek Statuette in Egyptian Dress CAROL BENSON An unusual bronze statuette in the Walters collection stands in an Egyptian pose and has Egyptian features in its dress, but is East Greek in its style. The unprovenanced works tantalizing hints of stylistic cross-influences between Egypt and the northern cities of East Greece prompts a review of relevant art historical and archaeological evidence on this topic. While not conclusive, detailed stylistic analysis supports the authenticity and importance of the work, which has its closest parallels in early fifth century B.C., small-scale works from the Troad. One of the toughest challenges facing curators today is the critical re-examination of the works in their col lections that, due to the market and collecting practices of an earlier era, unfortunately lack the invaluable information that accompanies a secure and accurate provenance. To perform this task with the remarkable antiquities collection amassed by Henry Walters is as great an education for the eye as for the intellect.1 One bronze statuette of a woman (ace. no. 54.970) provides an especially intriguing example of the excitement and frustration that accompany this challenge. The lack of reliable information about the origins of this work is particularly regrettable as the statuette is such a rare composite of different characteristics that its very authenticity must be investigated and tested; yet its significance, if it could be demonstrated to be an original of the early fifth century B.C., would be enormous. Its primary stylistic characteristics are Greek, and, as a Greek bronze figure in Egyptianizing pose and dress, it is almost without parallel. Any real understanding of the circumstances surrounding the creation and of the remarkable details of the work requires a thorough and careful analysis. THE HISTORY OF THE STATUETTE Henry Walters acquired the statuette, as well as many other works of art, from Dikram Kelekian, a prominent and active dealer who advised Walters extensively on his purchases of antiquities.2 Reasonably reliable evidence, in the form of a series of annotated photograph albums put together by Kelekian for Walters, suggests that the work was offered for sale in 1909. These five albums contain photographs of objects primarily from the ancient world?Greek, Roman, Egyptian, and Islamic? and were sent to Walters when he was considering purchases. The first is dated 1909; the rest are dated 1911, 1912, 1914, and one larger album inexplicably contains items offered in both 1913 and 1917. Kelekian apparently acquired the items in these albums "on spec" from a wide variety of sources and had them photographed to be offered for sale. The photographer is not identified. The photograph of the bronze statuette is labeled sim ply "found in Greece." Of course, the use of this type of phrase by a dealer of Kelekian's character and reputation is not a reliable indicator of the piece's true origin; it could easily be a fabrication if Kelekian did not know the source (especially if he acquired it from another dealer) or if he did not choose to let his source be known. AN EXAMINATION OF THE WORK The statuette (figs. 1-4) was published by Dorothy Kent Hill in 1949,3 but has since received scant attention. It is solid-cast and stands 13.6 cm. tall. The head of the figure is thoroughly Greek in style, with distinctively "Ionian," or East Greek, features typical of the late sixth to early fifth centuries B.C. The stance, however, is an Egyptian one: it has the stiffly frontal pose characteristic of Egyptian figures, the legs and feet entirely straight and tighdy drawn together. The right arm of the figure is also stiffly vertical and held straight by her side. Her hand is clenched in an Egyptian manner. Her left arm is broken away above the elbow and appears to have been drawn slightly forward and away from the body. The existence of corrosion along the break indicates that the damage occurred in antiquity. The Journal of the Walters Art Museum 59 (2001) 7</page><page sequence="2">SJ^i?gi-: Figs. 1-3. Bronze statuette of a maiden, 500-480 B.C. Baltimore: Walters Art Museum, ace. no. 54.970. Below the knees of the figure, an irregular line marks a discontinuity in the bronze. The lower part of the garment and the legs and feet are smooth, with no decorative details added. On the figures proper right side, just above the garments hem, is an irregular cavity partially filled with lead. The bottoms of the feet have been filed smooth in modern times, making it impossible to determine whether metal tangs originally extended below them. This lower section has been identified by Walters' conservators as a clumsily achieved, cast-on repair, the date of which cannot be determined.4 The metal of the statuette has numerous shrinkage cracks and extensive pitting, leading to the supposition that the craftsman responsible was technically inexpert in the casting of bronze. One explanation for the repair might therefore be that the statuette was incompletely cast originally, with the casting ending below the knees, and a repair that was less detailed than the main body of the figure was cast onto the partial Statuette in antiquity, in order to complete it.5 Or it is possible that a casting flaw led to a break in this area at a later date, and that the lower part of the figure was cast onto the statuette to make a damaged statuette more "whole" and thus more saleable. Pending scientific testing of the content of the metal alloys of the upper and lower castings may give us additional information about whether the two sections of the statuette could have originated in the same workshop. The figure also combines details of Greek and Egyptian dress, as if a Greek artist wished to emulate an Egyptian "look" but was confused about the correct arrangement of Egyptian garments. What appears to be a thin, short-sleeved undergarment is visible over the breasts, embellished with closely set vertical striations. This is covered by a thin mantle tightly draped and fastened in a horizontal cinch just below the breasts. Running down the sides of the sleeves are the button-fastenings characteristic of an Ionic 8</page><page sequence="3">Fig. 4. Bronze statuette of a maiden (top of head). garment called a chiton. Three decorative bands at the neckline echo a typical Egyptian-style banded collar or necklace. The back surface of the piece is not as well pre served as the front; it is basically smooth, although we can still see the lines that continue the bands around the neck, as well as incisions near the shoulders that resemble the "suspender" effect of the simple linen garment worn by Egyptian women. The figures hair is combed tightly around the head; it is gathered up from the nape and bound in a wide band of fabric. At the front, locks of hair are formed into the distinctive flattened, semicircular curls worn over the temples, known as "side-curls," that are characteristic of works in the Ionian style of the late sixth and early fifth century B.C. A detail of the top of the piece (fig. 4) shows that these curls are pulled over the band at the front. The cranial and facial characteristics of the Walters' figure are also typical of the "Ionian" style. The head is shaped like an egg, with its axis running from the chin to the back of the crown. The eyes are almond-shaped and adapted to the curved surface of the head, giving them a somewhat slanted appearance from the front. The face is oval, with a sweet and demure expression, marked by high cheekbones and a small mouth that curves into a slight smile as the chin projects forward. PLACING THE STATUETTE IN CONTEXT As one of the few small-scale figurai works to combine Greek and Egyptian stylistic characteristics, the Walters' statuette finds its closest parallels in a small group of works discussed by Klaus Parlasca in his study of Archaic Greek statuettes from Egypt.6 Parlasca looked at works in the Greek style that were found in Egypt, and that were believed to have been manufactured there as well. These include small-scale statuettes of nude kouroi, including a fine example in Cairo carved in "alabaster," now recognized as gypsum, with many parallels from Naukratis.7 A remarkable faience shawabti figure of the late sixth century B.C. with a distinctly Greek bearded head, from Saqqara, now in the Cairo Museum, is an even more intriguing example of the mixture of Greek and Egyptian characteristics.8 Parlasca also included in his discussion a small bronze statuette of a Greek youth wearing the Egyptian kilt that was found in Vonitsa in Akarnania in Greece and is now in Dresden (figs. 5-7).9 This is the only Greek bronze stat uette of a man to wear Egyptian dress, although a handful of Cypriot bronze figures also wear the Egyptian kilt.10 These have recently been analyzed by Glenn Markoe as reflecting a special case of Phoenician transmission of Egyptian motifs to Cypriot patrons and artisans.11 The Dresden statuette, which cannot be dated more precisely than the second half of the sixth century B.C., is actually part of an implement, perhaps a mirror support, as the flattened details of the back, with a hole for a rivet attachment at the neck, indicate. The relatively unrefined male figure stands in the pose of a kouros, with his left leg advanced before his right. Parlasca suggested that the works he discussed were the products of a Greek workshop located in Naukratis that was under heavy East Greek influence.12 While this hypothesis may be correct, it is difficult to substantiate, especially for the works found outside of Naukratis. We have no information on how the Dresden bronze came to be made and how it came to Vonitsa, and its somewhat coarse features offer few leads. By contrast, the Walters' statuette clearly contains detailed and specific stylistic characteristics that indicate its possible origins in the northern region of East Greece. The hairstyle and head-covering worn by the Walters' statuette are unusual, but they have parallels in works from northern Ionia and Thessaly. A head from Atrax in Thessaly, while exhibiting the somewhat later facial characteristics of the second quarter of the fifth century, is a close parallel, with both the wide headband and the flat curls at the temples.13 The famous relief from Pharsalos in Thessaly now in the Louvre, crafted slightly later (mid-fifth century 9</page><page sequence="4">Figs. 5-7. Bronze statuette of a male wearing Egyptian kilt, second half of the 6th century B.C. Dresden: Skulpturensammlung, Staatliche Kunstsammlungen, ace. no. Z.V. 2626. B.C.), has a similar but more elaborate head-covering that catches up the hair in the back.14 Thessaly was strongly influenced by Ionian styles in this period, as is clear even from these examples. Two more examples from the northern Ionian sphere include the Kore from the Akropolis that is believed to be Chian in style if not in origin (Akropolis 675), has a similar facial structure, and is dated to 520-510 B.C.15 and a coin from Lampsakos, on the northwest coast of the Troad, a city with close ties to Miletos and Phokaia, dated to 500-490 B.C. The coins obverse depicts a janiform head of a woman with very similar facial features; her hair is bound by a thin band and has flat curls at the temples.16 The stylistic features of the Walters' statuette indicate an origin among the artistic centers of East Greece (the region of Greek settlement along the west coast of modern day Turkey.) We unfortunately still know little about the majority of these centers, due to historical circumstances (see below) and the limited extent to which the sites have been excavated. A terracotta banqueter from the Troad (the region near Troy in the northwestern region of modern-day Turkey), now in The British Museum (fig. 8),17 has a strikingly similar facial structure and smile to the Walters' piece. An Archaic terracotta protome of a woman from Sardis in The Metropolitan Museum of Art (fig. 9), comes from a tomb of the Lydian period called the "Stele Tomb," after the Greek marble stelae that flanked the entrance.18 Its facial features have many similarities with the Walters' bronze. Dating to the early fifth century B.C., it has been thought to indicate contacts between Lydia and the East Greek city of Rhodes, an important Greek trading center on the southern coast. GREEK-EGYPTIAN CONTACTS IN THE SIXTH AND FIFTH CENTURIES B.C. Parlascas article reflects the fact that the traditional focal point for scholars interested in Egypt's relations with Greece in the Archaic period has been the important site of Naukratis on the Canopic branch of the Nile. This was the Greek trading settlement that handled the major com mercial transactions between the Egyptians and Greeks.19 10</page><page sequence="5">:-#1 5*?&gt; **&lt; ;Vs% ? **?^ v Fig. 8.

This material was originally published by J. D. S. Pendlebury in 1930, and has been updated twice in more recent times, by Richard Brown in 1975, and again, in an exhaustive treatment by Nancy Skon-Jedele in 1994, which catalogued more than 5,000 objects.21 The number of true Egyptian artifacts that reached Greek lands is substantial, but the objects are primarily small items?faience Fig. 9. Terracotta female protome from Sardis, ca. 500-480 B.C. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, ace. no. 26.164.8. 11</page><page sequence="6">figurines, small vessels, scarabs, and beads?that circulated through trade. We now know that both Naukratis and Rhodes had factories that produced small faience articles in the Egyptian manner to satisfy a demand for these artifacts among Greek curiosity-seekers. Scarce but slowly mounting evidence from the major East Greek sanctuaries, from scattered Greek sites, and from Lydian contexts just east of Greek territories is also beginning to indicate that Egyptian influences were strongly felt in Archaic Greek centers other than Naukratis. All of the bronze artifacts discussed among the "Aigyptiaka" are purely Egyptian in style. When Pendlebury first published the material, the known bronzes were limited to a statuette of a Seated Horus from Athens and a small Apis bull found on Samos.22 Subsequent excavations revealed only a few additional examples?a similar Horus statuette from Argos and a mirror from Perachora23?until the spectacular finds from the Sanctuary of Hera at Samos changed the picture entirely.24 With one excavation, the number of Egyptian bronzes from Greek sites had jumped from a handful to more than 140, encouraging scholars to hope for similar riches from future excavations at East Greek sites. In recent years, the list has been expanded by a bronze Isis and a falcon-headed implement from the excavations at Miletos and a bronze situla from Samos.25 The Egyptian bronze statuettes excavated in the Samian Sanctuary of Hera (Heraion) have been identified by Ulf Jantzen as belonging to the Kushite period of the twenty-fifth dynasty, that is, ca. 719-656 B.C.26 A notable number of these statuettes are of women, including a very fine standing figure of the goddess Neith (figs. 10-12), another of the goddess Mut, and several naked female figures wearing a polos headdress and with separately formed and attached arms.27 They are thought to have been imported into Samos shortly after their manufacture in Egypt. Thus our picture of the Heraion on Samos in the Archaic period must now include numerous very fine Egyptian works dedicated in the sanctuary, as well as works of Near Eastern origin, also published by Jantzen,28 a situation unparalleled at any other Greek site. The Egyptian goddess Neith was a deity of war and hunting, especially revered in Lower Egypt, her principal cult center being located at Sais, home of the kings of the twenty sixth dynasty, the period between 664-525 B.C. The statuette of the goddess excavated at Samos (figs. 10?12) wears the red crown of Lower Egypt and an incised broad collar necklace inlaid with copper, as well as a thin net-like garment covered by her falcon-wings, also indicated by incision. Her stance is frontal, with her left foot only slightly advanced before her right. Her right hand hangs straight by her side, while her left arm is bent at the elbow with her hand lifted forward. Both hands are pierced to hold attributes. A comparison between this statuette and the Walters' maiden is revealing for the works' stylistic differences. While the Egyptian Neith exhibits the frontal stance and stiff leg position typical of many statuettes of the goddess, closely imitated in the Walters' piece, the heads of the figures are each fully representative of the very different cultures that produced them. The expressive, large-featured Egyptian face of Neith, with the strongly outlined eyes and protruding ears, contrasts with the distinctly Ionian Greek shape of the head of the Walters' statuette. Moreover, the oval face, the shape of the eye, the light-hearted expression with high cheekbones, small mouth, and projecting chin, as well as the treatment of the hair and head-covering, are all characteristics that belong to East Greece and related northern Greek settlements. The Walters' statuette can be dated between 500 and 480 B.C., a period of turmoil and upheaval in the region, as the advancing Persian empire now extended to the edge of the Aegean. Under Persian rule, Ionia fell within the satrapy, or region, administered from Sardis. Because of the upheaval and the fact that the Ionian people were subjugated to the Persians, we know few details of Ionian life in this period, and have no comparable bronze statuettes to compare to the Walters' work. But the movement to revolt against Persian domination, which was to have dire consequences for the region, had begun. The Walters' bronze points toward a greater communi cation and cross-influence between Egypt and the northern region of East Greece than excavated evidence currently supports. That a similar exchange took place on Rhodes and on Samos, the formidable trading powers to the south, has long been recognized. The stimulus of trade was the driving force behind this cultural interaction, and Naukratis was not the only site where this was taking place; an important trade route between Egypt and Greece followed the coastlines of Palestine, Phoenicia, and Asia Minor. The Egyptian dedications at major East Greek sanctu aries may also have had a greater cultural impact than has previously been recognized, but there is only one extant Egyptian stone sculpture dating from the twenty-fifth or twenty-sixth dynasties (between 750 and 525 B.C.) excavated from an Aegean context; it is a battered fragment of an Egyptian stone head, less than half life-size, found near the temple of Athena Polias at ICamiros on Rhodes.29 It is hoped that continuing excavations throughout the region will yield further valuable evidence. The writings of the early Greek historian Herodotos also lend support. Herodotos tells us that the Egyptian king Amasis dedicated two wooden images of himself to Hera in Samos, during the time of the Samian tyrant Polykrates, ca. 540 B.C. (Hdt. 2.182). He also mentions dedications by Amasis at a Greek sanctuary at Lindos on Rhodes, and another at Cyrene on the north coast of Africa.30 12</page><page sequence="7">\ Figs. 10-12.

This odd and intriguing work, both literally and figuratively a pastiche of different elements and styles, potentially represents a rare material example of cultural dialogue. The works of art from the region and period with which it is associated are few and little-known, largely due to the toll of military campaigns waged for dominance over this fertile and strate gically located region. If its origins could be definitively ascertained, the importance of the piece would be staggering. Has the statuette been too compromised by its obvious modifications to be considered authentic? It would take more information than we now have to damn it as a false creation. Most of the comparanda for the piece were not known, many not yet even excavated, by 1909, the date the piece was apparently offered for sale to Henry Walters. The excavations that yielded the Egyptian bronzes in the Sanctuary of Hera at Samos did not begin until 1910; most of the bronzes were not found before the 1920s and not publicly announced until the 1950s. The Dresden bronze was not published until 1921; Parlasca's article appeared in 1975. Our general knowledge of East Greek styles was still in its infancy in the late 1920s, when Ernst Langlotz published his Fr?hgriechische Bildhauerschulen (Early Greek Sculptural Schools) in N?rnberg in 1927. Thus it is conceivable but very unlikely that a false creation combining these details could have been made by 1909. The corrosion patterns of the metal, including the break surface of the proper left arm, while it cannot confirm the dating, are consistent with manufacture in antiquity. The relatively smooth back of the piece is also inconclusive. Terry Drayman-Weisser, Head of Conservation at the Walters, suggests that it could have been smoothed over in modern times, which means we cannot determine whether the lack of incised detail is original or is due to greater weathering and corrosion of this side. As already noted, the cast-on repair, if that is what it is, of the lower part is remarkably crude in comparison to the rest of the work and may be the result of later modification. Such questions about possible alterations need not cloud the assessment of the piece, however, since we already know that it passed through a dealers hands ca. 1909. The lively grace and remarkable delicacy of the piece are the best argument for its authenticity, as are its distinctive East Greek stylistic elements. Knowledge of an early twentieth century workshop producing forgeries of this kind, or scientific testing that proved there is a modern component to the alloy of the upper part of the work, would settle the matter. At present, we must deeply lament the circumstances that have led to the loss of the work's original provenance. At the same time, however, we can carefully note its oddities while celebrating its unique qualities and the suggestion of stylistic interrelationships that the piece represents.
