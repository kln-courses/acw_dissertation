Enhancements to the occupant restraint system include the implementation and advancement of head and neck restraints (HNR), minimum performance requirements for belts and seats and the introduction of energy absorbing foam are a few highlights, among others. This paper summarizes three non-injury case studies of actual on-track incidents, including the acceleration pulses, principal direction of force, restraint systems used and driver anthropometry information. Also discussed are the NASCAR personal safety equipment requirements as well as frontal, oblique and side sled testing data of similar input acceleration magnitudes for the Hybrid III (H-III) fiftieth percentile male anthropomorphic test device (ATD).

J. Trans. Safety / Volume 1, Issue 2(August 2013) each vehicle. The survey is recorded directly into a database via a touchscreen tablet and is related to vehicle number, driver name, incident data recorder serial number, vehicle chassis identification number and other parameters. When an incident occurs on the race track a separate software package is used to create an incident report. The restraint survey data is automatically paired with the incident report, effectively linking restraint, driver, vehicle, acceleration data, photos, video and other information into one incident file. The following bullet points shows the restraint survey information which is gathered for every vehicle at every NASCAR National Series event. • Vehicle # • Head Net(s) Used • Seat Brand • Rib/Chest Support(s) Used • Belt Brand • Belt Style • Belt Adjuster Style Figure 2.  • Belt Adjuster Location • Belt Adjuster Type • Belt Shoulder Mount Type • Leg Divider Used • HNR Brand • HNR Tether Type • Helmet Removal Device Used • Helmet Brand • Composite Seat S/N • Incident Data Recorder S/N Figure 3.  DISCUSSION Personal Safety Equipment Section 20-17, Personal Safety Equipment, of the NASCAR rulebook identifies the required safety equipment competitors must use during NASCAR sanctioned competition. Table one shows the required personal safety equipment for driver's, the associated performance specifications for each and a corresponding notation for Diagram one. Figure 1.  </page> <page sequence="3"> Patalak et al / SAE Int. J. Trans. Safety / Volume 1, Issue 2(August 2013) 263 Table 1.  Helmets As Table one shows, helmets meeting several different performance specifications are acceptable for use in NASCAR competition. For the impact portion of the Snell standard SA2010 specification, a fire resistant full face helmet with face shield is used with a 10.3 lb (4.7 kg) head form inside the helmet. The average size helmeted head form drops at a velocity of 17.3 mph (7.75 m/s) onto a flat, hemispherical, roll bar, and edge surface anvil. The head form measured acceleration must not exceed 275 G's. SA2010 has different requirements for larger and smaller head sizes. The FIA 8860-2010 standard requires a 11.0 lb (5.0 kg) head form, 24.6 mph (9.5 m/s) drop speed with a 300 G maximum acceleration. FIA 8860-2010 also requires a 33% increase in helmet shell penetration resistance. The Snell Diagram 1. SAH2010 certification carries the same helmet performance requirements as Snell SA2010, but also includes evaluation The SFI Foundation (SFI) specifications are industry of the helmet hardware for the attachment of HNR tethers.

It requires twofrontal and one 30° right frontal sled test for each submitted HNR device using a H-III fiftieth percentile male ATD. For each test the maximum upper neck tension may not exceed 2,500 N from zero through eighty milliseconds and may not exceed 3,200 N from eighty to one hundred and twenty </page> <page sequence="4"> 264 Patalak et al / SAE Int. J. Trans. Safety / Volume 1, Issue 2(August 2013) milliseconds. This performance criterion with respect to time is done to account for ATD response artifacts during the rebound phase of the event. A flame resistance test is also applied to the tether and device surface. For a HNR device to be accepted for use in NASCAR, the device must be in compliance with SFI 38.1 and must also be reviewed and recommended for acceptance by the NASCAR Head and Neck Study Group. The two HNR devices currently acceptable for use in NASCAR are shown in Diagram three. Figure 4.  Belt Restraint Systems Diagram 2.  Diagram 4.  Diagram 3.

The restraint system must withstand the load with no failures of any component or separation of any webbing in the assembly. Both two inch </page> <page sequence="5"> Patalak et al / SAE Int. J. Trans. Safety / Volume 1, Issue 2(August 2013) 265 and three inch wide webbing is permissible. A 6-point restraint system became mandatory in 2007 and a 7-point system is now recommended for use in NASCAR. The 6- point restraint has two anti-submarine, or crotch straps, while the 7-point system has the same two anti-submarine belts, plus a 3rd negative-G strap. Diagrams four and five show examples of these restraints. Note the three inch wide lap belts in Diagram four and the two inch wide lap belts in Diagram five. Diagram 6.  Diagram 5.  Positioning of the crotch belts is critical for optimum performance and must be compatible with the seat and/or chassis. The SFI Seatbelt Installation Guide For Upright Seating recommends a −10° to −20° (rearward) angle on the crotch straps, depending on the seat design [10]. When using a 7-point system, the 7th point is recommended to follow the chest line of the driver and provides additional vertical occupant restraint and lap belt stability and also allows anchoring the crotch belts at the lap belt anchors as shown in Diagram seven. Diagrams six and seven show the six and seven point systems, respectively. Diagram 7.  </page> <page sequence="6"> 266 Patalak et al / SAE Int. J. Trans. Safety / Volume 1, Issue 2(August 2013) Additional shoulder belts are also commonly used in NASCAR racing. These additional belts are commonly referred to as “double shoulder belts” or “over/under shoulder belts”. They consist of a three inch wide belt which rests on the body. A second upper two inch wide belt rests on top of the HNR device. Each belt has its own adjuster and seat or chassis mounting location. The upper and lower belts merge into a single belt before connecting to the cam-lock or latch link. The body belt mounting may be positioned to achieve a downward belt angle between −10° to −30° [10]. This downward component of the body belt provides additional vertical restraint. The upper belt is mounted at 0° to −10° downward [10]. In a frontal impact, due to its orientation, the upper belt carry's the majority of the load, preventing vertical occupant overloading by the downward angled body belt. However, during vertical acceleration (roll-over) events the downward angled body belt works more efficiently as it has a larger vertical component. When used with a 6-point restraint system, the over/under shoulder belts system is referred to as an 8-point restraint. A 9-point system includes the third crotch strap added to the over/under shoulder belt system. Examples of the eight and nine point restraint systems are shown in Diagrams eight and nine. Diagram ten shows the 9- point restraint geometry. Diagram 9.  Diagram 10.  Diagram 8.      </page> <page sequence="7"> Patalak et al / SAE Int. J. Trans. Safety / Volume 1, Issue 2(August 2013) 267 Seats Table 2.  All seats used in NASCAR must meet the SFI 39.1 Stock Car Type Racing Seats specification. The NASCAR rulebook also states that a minimum of four inches of SFI 45.2 impact padding be used on the right side of the seat head support and a minimum of 2.5 inches on the left. The development of the SFI 39.1 specification was a joint effort by the SFI Foundation, NASCAR, seat manufacturers and biomechanical experts and is detailed in SAE technical publication 2008-01-2974 [11]. In side and rearward impacts the seat serves as the driver's primary restraint system. Prior research has shown the importance of adequately supporting the head, shoulder and pelvis of the occupant during side impacts [12]. SFI 39.1 uses a quasi-static push test to evaluate the lateral stiffness of the head, shoulder and pelvic supports of a seat. The head support must be able to withstand a minimum of 2,000 pounds. The shoulder support and pelvic support must withstand a minimum of 3,000 and 4,000 pounds respectively. These minimum loads must be held for ten seconds without the lateral deflection of the seat exceeding 0.5 inches. After the load is removed, the seat must also return to within 0.25 inches of where it began. The loads are applied individually through specific load shapes for the head, shoulder and pelvis. Case Study #1 - Right Frontal Impact Case Study one is a single vehicle incident. The case study vehicle begins a counter-clockwise rotation while on- track, resulting in a trajectory toward the inside wall. The vehicle makes contact with the inside SAFER barrier wall with the front and right front of the vehicle. The vehicle rotates counter-clockwise as it leaves the wall, coming to rest down track. Table two summarizes the driver, restraint and acceleration pulse information for Case Study #1. The acceleration pulse and PDOF for Case Study #1 are shown in Figures four and five. Figure 4. Figure 5.  </page> <page sequence="8"> 268 Patalak et al / SAE Int. J. Trans. Safety / Volume 1, Issue 2(August 2013) In a right frontal impact, such as Case Study #1, the primary means of occupant restraint is shared between the seat belt restraint system, HNR and the seat. Frontal 30° oblique sled testing is often conducted as part of HNR, seat or belt development and evaluation. Appendix A contains ATD response data from a right frontal 30° oblique sled test using a 50th percentile male H-III ATD positioned in a composite seat with 6-point restraint and HANS device. The sled test acceleration pulse used was the SFI 38.1 standard pulse shown in Figure four. Case Study #2 - Left Side Impact Case Study two is a multiple vehicle incident. The case study vehicle begins a counter-clockwise rotation while on- track resulting in a passenger side leading slide on the racing surface. The front of a secondary vehicle makes contact with the driver's side of the case study vehicle. Both vehicles come Figure 6.  to rest down track. Table three summarizes the driver, restraint and acceleration pulse information for Case Study #3. Table 3.  Figure 7.  In a left side impact, such as Case Study #2, the primary means of occupant restraint is the seat. Left and right side impact sled testing is often conducted as part of seat and belt systems development and evaluation.

Safety / Volume 1, Issue 2(August 2013) 269 Case Study #3 - Frontal Impact Case Study three is a single vehicle incident. The case study vehicle develops a tangential trajectory to the racing surface. The front of the vehicle makes contact with a reinforced tire wall and comes to rest. Table four summarizes the driver, restraint and acceleration pulse information for Case Study #3. Table 4.  Figure 9.  In a frontal impact, such as Case Study #3, the primary means of occupant restraint is the seat belt restraint system and the HNR device. Frontal sled testing is often conducted as part of HNR, seat and belt systems development and evaluation. Response data from a frontal sled test using a H- III 50th percentile male ATD fitted in a composite seat, HANS device and 6-point restraint is shown in Appendix C. The sled test acceleration pulse was the standard SFI 38.1 pulse, shown previously in Figure four. The acceleration pulse and PDOF for Case Study #3 are shown in Figures eight and nine. SUMMARY It is important to note that the sled test data presented in this papers appendix is shown only as an example of ATD response data from a similar PDOF input. Before drawing any strict conclusions, consideration must also be given to the variances between case studies and sled testing. Specifically, acceleration magnitude, change in velocity and kinetic energy system inputs must all be accounted for when comparing ATD and human responses. Hundreds of individual motorsport sled and crash tests have been conducted by different interested parties to develop, refine, test and validate these pieces of safety equipment, all of which focus on key aspects of the equipment performance and ATD responses. The purpose of presenting these cases studies and sled test data is to serve as a macro view of the responses of a properly restrained ATD at these acceleration levels in comparison to the outcomes of humans using similar restraint systems.

Safety / Volume 1, Issue 2(August 2013) and Space Administration (NASA) memorandum titled, Table 5.  “Human Tolerance to Rapidly Applied Accelerations: A Summary of the Literature”. This memorandum reviewed the literature to determine human tolerance to rapidly applied acceleration, including the research of Lieutenant Colonel John Paul Stapp [13]. More than a half century later NASA has continued research on human tolerances to rapidly applied accelerations by looking at NASCAR crash data, the results of which was recently published at the 2011 Stapp Car Crash Conference. Specifically, the NASA analysis of NASCAR impacts was performed to develop improved injury assessment reference values (IARV) that may be more relevant to NASA's context of vehicle landing operations [5]. The NASCAR incident data set is a valuable occupant safety research tool, both for racing safety, and for future road vehicle safety. Statistically relevant numbers of well- documented cases of live human subjects exposed to rapid accelerations on these order of magnitudes are quite rare. The IARV values listed in the Appendices for the various test conditions demonstrate the value of the incident data in evaluating the efficacy of the IARVs for general safety development use. The chest deflection values for the frontal crash tests indicate a low risk of chest injury as was seen in the actual crashes. In contrast, the chest accelerations measured in those tests cast doubt on the use of a 60G limit as an IARV, as this value is routinely exceeded in motorsports sled tests and, as the examples in this paper indicate, real racing crashes of properly restrained and supported drivers do not produce chest injuries. It is less clear in the case of head accelerations, where the Head Injury Criterion (HIC) values are all close to the accepted limit of 1000 in the tests, but no head injuries were noted in the case Future expansion of data gathering capabilities may studies. include acquiring seat belt load data from all nine belt anchor While focusing only on these three case study incidents locations and onboard high-speed video of the driver. may not be statistically reliable for detailed conclusions, the Additional acceleration and angular rate data channels may NASCAR incident database contains approximately 6,000 also be added to the chassis, driver's seat and driver. individual incident files.
