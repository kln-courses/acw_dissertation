<plain_text><page sequence="1">AINSLEE T. EMBREE Nehru's Understanding of the Social Function of Religion In the very moving document referred to as his "will and testament" Nehru gave instructions that his body was to be cremated and a handful of the ashes thrown into the Ganga. He was aware, however, how this simple act might be inter preted as an act of Hindu religious devotion, so he immedi ately denied that his intention had any religious significance. He wanted no religious ceremonies performed at his death, for he insisted that he did not believe in them, and so to permit them would be hypocrisy. And then he added a striking phrase: perfor mance of such ceremonies would be "an attempt to delude oursel ves and others". I have chosen this passage as an introduction to what must of necessity be a tentative exploration of Nehru's understanding of the social function of religion because it seems to me to symbolise some of the great issues that dominated his political career, and, by extension, since the two were so closely intertwined, the life of modern India. Ralph Waldo Emerson, the nineteenth century American writer, has a remarkable essay entitled "Representative Men", by which he means not "typical", but people who are great because they are participants at the deepest level in the lives of their people. No one would say, I suppose, that Nehru was a "typical Indian", but in Emerson's understanding he was a "representative" one. "Like can only be known by like," Emerson said. "The reason why he knows about them is that he is one of them... We never come at the true and best benefit of any genius, so long as we believe him to be an original force." When we look at Nehru's views on religion, they may seem very unrepresentative of what is or Revised version of lecture delivered at an international seminar to celebrate the hundredth anniversary of Nehru's birth.

The overriding issue that I see related to Nehru's concern expressed in that quotation from his last will and testament is the relation between religion and nationalism. Here surely is one of the great themes of twentieth century history. The same problem can be put in different terms regarding the relationship between religion and culture, and this is a question that arises very frequent ly in Nehru's work. It is also at the heart of one of the most intractable issues in the political history of India in the twentieth century namely, how are the claims of groups which identify themselves in religious terms to be reconciled with representative democratic institutions. These are the generalities behind many of the specific issues of Nehru's career, including the constitutional reforms of 1920, his allegiance to Gandhi, communal violence, Partition, and the definition of nationhood after 1947. Nehru's understanding of the function of religion was shaped by these events, but his intellectual commitments were also factors in shap ing the events. There can be much debate, of course, about causal effects in all these matters, but what I have chosen to emphasise is, first of all, Nehru's own articulation of the function of religion in society, and then in an even more cursory fashion, to look at few of the great moments in the history of modern India where ideas and events coalesce. It is there one sees Nehru as a representative man, and, in Emerson's sense, we can perceive the true and best benefit of his genius. There is a seeming anomaly in Nehru's life-long rejection of religion as a defining characteristic of nationalism, because in the popular imagination, with the exception of Israel, there is perhaps no nation or civilisation that is so closely associated with a par ticular religion as is India. For the ancient Greeks and Romans for the people of the Middle East, and for Europeans since the first great voyages of trade and discovery, India has been identified as the land of the Hindus, a people made distinctive by their religion. For foreigners, Indian and Hindu were interchangeable terms. This was the point James Mill was making in 1804 when he declared in his famous history of India, "So much of the entire business of life among the Hindus consists in religious services, that the delinea</page><page sequence="3">AINSLEE T. EMBREE / 167 tion of their religion is a delineation of the principal branch of their manners." But western observers were not alone in asserting that religion was integral to India. For Mahatma Gandhi, religion was inex tricably woven into the fabric of Indian life. Those who thought that religion had nothing to do with Indian politics, he once said, understood neither religion nor politics. Although eighty per cent of its people are Hindus, I cannot find that Nehru ever referred to India as a Hindu nation; although Jinnah, his. great opponent, used to refer to the Indian National Congress, the party that struggled so long and so successfully for India's freedom and with which Nehru was so closely identified, as a Hindu organisation. Its membership and leadership were, it is true, largely Hindu, but this characterisation was always strenuously rejected by Nehru and the other leaders. India, they insisted, would be a secular state, that is, in the Indian usage of this term: a nation where all religions could be freely practised, but none would be favoured over another by the state. It is customary to regard this commitment to religious neutrality as a product of sensible pragmatism that recognised the inevitability of India's religious pluralism, specifically, its immense Muslim minority. This is, of course, a correct reading of recent political history, but there is, one suspects, another dimension to the commitment that is rooted both in India's historical experience and, somewhat paradoxically, in the nature of Hinduism itself. So to return to that passage from the last will and testament with which I began, and Nehru's fear that his request to have a portion of his ashes thrown into the Ganga at Allahabad might be seen as a religious ceremony, which would, he declared, be "hypocrisy and an attempt to delude others". The phrase is resonant of an attitude that is found in much of Nehru's writings. The scattering of his ashes in the Ganga was, he insisted, merely an expression of his love for the great river which he had watched throughout his life in all its changing moods. He had often thought of the history and myth and tradition associated with the great river, and it had become for him "a symbol of India's age-long culture and civilisation". The Ganga was "the river of India, beloved of her people, round which are intertwined her racial</page><page sequence="4">168 / The Social Function of Religion memories, her hopes and fears, her songs of triumph, her victories and her defeats." Personifying the Ganga, Nehru speaks of her smiling and dancing, but also dark and gloomy: "a symbol and a memory of the past of India, running into the present and flowing on to the great ocean of the future." Then, almost as if he remembers that the river flowing into the ocean is one of the dominant metaphors of the Hindu religious tradition, Nehru quickly disowns, although somewhat obliquely, any transcendental reference in his metaphor. He does this by saying that he has discarded much of past tradition and custom, and surely here he had in mind the religious practices and beliefs specifically associated with the Ganga. It was indeed about this time that hundreds of pilgrims attending the great Kumbha festival at Allahabad had been killed, when panic broke out in the vast crowd as a result of the violent behaviour of a group of militant sadhus. When someone in Parliament spoke disparag ingly of the event, decrying it as the product of superstition, some members demanded an apology on the ground that the speaker had insulted religion. Nehru made a sharp rejoinder to the effect that he hoped that as long as he was Prime Minister, members of the House would have freedom to denounce ignorance and super stition, even though they might be cloaked in religious garb. This was the Nehru speaking for whom many of us then, as now, had great admiration: Nehru the rationalist, the free-thinker, the skeptic, with a mind unburdened by religious commitment. And yet having said that, one is aware, as Nehru's writings make clear that he was aware, that the problem of the relation of religion and culture is an issue of extraordinary complexity. Nehru could say that he had discarded the religious practices and beliefs associated with the Ganga, and that he longed to see others give them up too. He spoke of his anxiety to see India rid herself, as he put it, "of all the shackles that bind and constrain and divide her people, and suppress vast numbers of them and prevent the free development of the body and the spirit." But those very practices and beliefs which he would like to have seen ascribed to the scrap heap, were intimately linked with the great inheritance of Indian civilisation. What he called "the unbroken chain which goes back to the dawn of history in the immemorial past of India" was precisely what he valued and which he wanted to see preserved, and yet many of the components, were, to use his own metaphor, the shackles of religion.</page><page sequence="5">AINSLEE T. EMBREE / 169 The same dilemma of separating religious practices and cus toms from civilisation had presented itself to Nehru in a rather curious fashion in 1940 when his friend, the historian, E.P. Thompson, was thinking about making a film about India. Since then there have been hundreds of films made about India, but I suppose that in 1940 this was a relatively new idea, and Nehru's fertile imagination played with the idea. The film could be centred on the Ganga, for as he pointed out, this could be used to bring in history, culture, art, mythology. But this catalogue of possibilities set off, as it were, a warning signal in Nehru's mind; mythology meant bringing in religion, for obviously one could not talk about Indian art without bringing in the mythological origins of the Ganga. So the myths of religion had to be shown in some fashion in a film about Indian culture, but, Nehru wrote to Thompson in a hopeful aside, "the superstitious side need not be stressed." Among the things that should be stressed, he noted, was the coming of the Aryans; he mentions their joy at seeing the great river, but not, as perhaps most Indian intellectuals of his time would have, the splendour of their religious thought. He says the defeat of Alexander the Great should be mentioned, though he makes a curious error by placing it as having taken place on the Ganga, near Allahabad. There should also be reference to the stories of the Mahabharata and the Ramayana and of the "sweet songs" in Braj Bhasha from Vrindavan; but it is clear that he is thinking of them as legends and poetry. One can suppose that Nehru would have had some misgivings about the presentation of these same stories in religiously didactic forms by the state television system. There is one peculiar omission from Nehru's list of events in the Indian historical experience, namely, any reference to the com ing of Islam through the Turkic peoples from Central Asia and the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate and the Mughal empire. Per haps this is reading too much into a casual letter, but perhaps unconsciously Nehru was taking the occasion in a pleasant, rather dreaming letter, to forget the realities of the 1930s and 1940s when, much against his own preference, religious differences were being thrust into prominence in Indian political discourse. Behind Nehru's comments, in these and similar passages, are evident all the contradictions and ambiguities that confront the writer who tries to evaluate the relationship of religion to society...</page><page sequence="6">170 / The Social Function of Religion The problem is neither new nor confined to either east or west. Perhaps the most famous example is Augustine's titanic attempt, on the one hand, of defending Christians from the charge that it was their impiety towards the old gods that had led to the bar barian invasion, and, on the other, that the events were an expres sion of Divine Will. Al-Biruni, with less overt theological commitment, struggled to explicate the meaning of the clash of religions and cultures that was taking place at the end of the tenth century in northern India. But if the general problem of under standing the social function of religion has been part of intellectual history, this particular form (in which it presented itself to Nehru) manifests itself in the European Enlightenment of the eighteenth century. Reading his great book, Glimpses of World History, it is hard to avoid seeing empathy and identification when in his telling of the history of the west he reaches the famous figures of the French Enlightenment. Voltaire was imprisoned, he told his daughter, because he fought against injustice and bigotry, criticised Chris tianity and, therefore, was fiercely hated by the orthodox. He quotes with evident approval Voltaire's saying that "a man who accepts his religion without examining it is like an ox which allows itself to be harnessed." This is a judgement that appears many times, in one form or another, in Nehru's writings and speeches. It is worth noting that it is really not true that the orthodox thinkers in Europe whom Voltaire was criticising, or the ones that Nehru would frequently criticise, accepted religious positions without examining them. Aquinas and Shankaracharya can surely not be accused of lacking in rationality or failing to examine belief proposition, even though some of their less intellectual followers may. Their nationalism was based on very different presupposi tions from that of Nehru, and Nehru had, in fact, moved beyond the somewhat timid skepticism of Voltaire to a fairly radical posi tion that he identified as materialism. What I take to be an expres sion of his own beliefs on the subject comes, in a somewhat roundabout fashion, when in the Discovery of India, he is discussing the ancient skeptics and materialists, dating from the time of the Buddha, known as Charvakas or Lokayatas. Their writings are almost wholly lost, and their ideas are known only from their enemies, but Nehru was convinced, probably correctly that they had wide influence since their opponents took so much trouble to denounce them. Nehru's summary of their teaching is an attempt</page><page sequence="7">AINSLEE T. EMBREE / 171 to assert, I believe, that there was a powerful intellectual tradition in India that ran counter to the mysticism that he believed charac terised Indian religion. Mysticism irritated him, he said; it appears to be "vague and soft and flabby, not a rigorous discipline of the mind but a surrender of mental faculties and a living in a sea of emotional experience." In contrast to the vagueness and other-worldliness of mys ticism was what seemed to him the robust commonsense of the ancient Indian materialists. This passage from Discovery of India is worth quoting at length, for it touches upon many aspects of his understanding of religion: The materialists attached authority and all vested interests in thought, religion and theology. They denounced the Vedas and priestcraft and traditional beliefs, and proclaimed that belief must be free and must not depend on pre-suppositions or merely on the authority of the past. They inveighed against all forms of magic and superstition. Their general spirit was comparable in many ways to the modern materialistic approach; it wanted to rid itself of the chains and burden of the past, of speculation about matters which could not be perceived, of worship of imaginary gods. Only that could be presumed to exist which could be directly perceived, every other inference or presumption was equally likely to be true or false. Hence matter in its various forms and this world could only be considered as really existing. There was no other world, no heaven or hell, no soul separate from the body. Mind and intelligence and everything else have developed from the basic elements. Natural phenomena did not concern themselves with human values and were indifferent to what we consider good or bad. Moral rules were mere conventions made by men. It is with some hesitation I say that this is a more radical criticism than that made by Voltaire or Rousseau, and while Nehru put it in the minds of thinkers of the fourth and fifth centuries BC he also seems to be speaking for himself. I spoke just now of the new critique of religion that is associated with the Enlightenment in both its English and French forms, and of which in very important ways Nehru was the intellectual heir. He surely would have accepted Kant's famous definition of Enlightenment as the end of one's nonage, of release from the</page><page sequence="8">172 / The Social Function of Religion tutelage of religious and other authorities. The concomitant of accepting an authority—of scripture, priesthood, or custom—is to desire to impose the authority one has accepted on others. The belief that there is a truth that can be and should be known to all people is, as Nehru never ceased to emphasise, the root of in tolerance. Toleration, not only of conflicting religious opinions but, for our time, the much more difficult acceptance of conflicting political opinions, was for Nehru, as for the great figures of the Enlightenment, the demand to use one's own intellect to decide what to believe. His harshest criticisms of religion sprang, then, from his conviction that religious beliefs and practices, through their manipulation by vested interests of the possessors of political and economic power, were, as he put it, "inevitably a reactionary force opposing change and progress." He was interested essential ly, he insisted, "in this world, in this life, not in some other world or future life." He wanted to change the world, not to accept it as it was, or escape from it. Religion was, he said, "an asocial quest for God or the absolute, and the religious man is more concerned with his own salvation than with the good of society." Given this fairly consistent reading of religion as a reactionary force, inimical to social development, Nehru was forced to inquire how much such a pervasive force had come into existence and why it endured in all societies. These were questions that obviously seemed of importance to him, and he returned to them often in one form or another. The very ubiquity of religions showed, he said, that they supplied some deeply felt inner need of human nature and that the vast majority of people could not do without some form of religious belief. He does not, I think, get much closer to a generalised definition of religion than this suggestion that it arose in response to the human need to adjust to what has been called the three brute facts of life: "Contingency, powerlessness and scar city". Contingency refers to the uncertainties of life over which we have no control, powerlessness to our inability to control the forces of nature, and scarcity to the lack of resources to fulfill human needs and desires. Religion with its belief systems, its rituals, its explanatory myths, welds people into groups and helps them face the brute facts of life. Religion, then, as a sociologist put it, "acts to reinforce the unity and stability of society, by supporting social control, enhancing established values and goals and providing the means for overcoming guilt and alienation."</page><page sequence="9">AiNSLEET. EMBREE / 173 This summary of the function of religion would be quite acceptable to a wide spectrum of people. Many religious people, or at least people who support religious institutions, would see it as a validation of their claims for the beneficial effects of religion on society. At the opposite end of the spectrum would be those who read the statement as a cogent evaluation of the way religion has been used as an instrument of social oppression. The argument that religion promotes "the unity and stability of society" while "enforc ing social control" seems not just wholly admirable but also provides many people the proof of the divine origin of the religious system. For Nehru, this statement of the social function of religion would also be a valid analysis; but instead of justifying the exist ence of the religious institutions, it indicates why they must be opposed. There is a passage in The Discovery of India that appears to be an explicit rejection of the functional defense of religion. "Religion," he wrote, "though it has undoubtedly brought comfort to in numerable human beings and stabilised society by its values, has checked the tendency to change and progress inherent in human society." This belief in human progress being inherent in human society is one of those instances that link Nehru with an important strain in eighteenth and nineteenth century European thought. So, he could write in another place, religion has often made beasts of people, for "instead of bringing enlightenment to them, it has often tried to keep them in the dark; instead of broadening their minds, it has frequently made them narrow-minded and intolerant of others." As one reads such passages, one is compelled to ask two questions, to neither of which Nehru's writings permit an un equivocal answer. The first is: Was Nehru, despite his denuncia tions of religious practices, religious institutions/and religious professionals, a religious person? Part of the answer must be, that dislike of what may be called the infrastructure of religion may be the surest indication of religious feelings. To validate this, one need only recall the passionate denunciations by religious dissenters of the religious establishment in all the great religions. One can say that Nehru's distaste of what he, like many others, refers to as organised religion, is almost a guarantee that he valued those ultimate concerns of human beings which we subsume under the rubric of religion. There is, in fact, considerable evidence in his</page><page sequence="10">174 / The Social Function of Religion writings of such concerns, and one of his definitions of religion points toward them. Religion, he says, deals with the uncharted regions of human experience. He is unwilling to say that science will not be able to chart all these regions, but stressed that life does not consist only of what we see and feel and hear; "it is continually touching an invisible world of other, and possibly more stable or equally changeable elements, and no thinking person can ignore this invisible world." It was for this reason that he found the Vedanta philosophy interesting, with discussions of things beyond mind and matter. The sense of the need to understand and go beyond sense data led him, always, to speak of the founders of the great religions as among the noblest men that the world has ever produced, but whose teachings were perverted by their followers to serve their own ends. The other question that arises from Nehru's criticism of religion bears directly on his understanding of the social function of religion: Did he see religion only as a barrier and hindrance to social progress and human development; or did he see it becoming a positive force for human betterment? What I have in mind is that in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, many religious groups did ally themselves with what may be thought of as schemes for human improvement. One thinks of the Christian groups in England and America who opposed the slave trade and gave numerous leadership in other movements that were also move ments for religious reform. Nehru speaks warmly of them, but mainly because of their attacks on old religious customs. Thus, he quotes with evident approval Vivekananda's advice to young people that it would be better to be "rank atheists rather than superstitious fools, for the atheist is alive... Mystery-mongering and superstition are always signs of weakness. He devotes more space to Vivekananda than to any of the other nineteenth century reformers; but he emphasises the criticisms he made of the existing religious order—not his own religious ideas. Nehru does not ap pear to have made any appeals to religious groups to give their support for schemes for social betterment; all he seems to ask of them is that they not hinder progress by their obscurantism and bigotry. In his more pessimistic moments, when he heard of communal riots between Hindus and Muslims, he longed for the demise of religion. "How long that will take I cannot say," he wrote, 'but religion in India will kill the country and its peoples if it is not subdued."</page><page sequence="11">AINSLEE T. EMBREE / 175 It would not be too far from the mark, to conclude that Nehru saw the social role of religion in almost wholly negative terms. But here one must ask what about his acceptance of Gandhi's leadership, for whom religious commitment was at the heart of social betterment? A wholly satisfying explanation would demand lengthy analysis, but one can sketch a reasonable framework for an answer. First of all, as I have tried to suggest, Nehru's under standing of the ultimate human concerns, while they may have been expressed in a vocabulary derived from the west, were in keeping with Indian metaphysics. Neither he nor Gandhi were very deeply versed in Indian theology or philosophy, but their statements of ultimate belief fitted in, as Nehru recognised, with Vedanta. "I myself am incapable of thinking of a deity or of any unknown supreme power in anthropomorphic terms... Any idea of a personal God seems very odd to me." Gandhi might have phrased his credo slightly differently, but I think the meaning would not have been much the same. Secondly, they shared a common attitude towards religious conflict and its agents. And, in the third place, both were disdainful of much of the infrastructure of religion—its practices, its institutions, its specialists. Gandhi was no more acceptable to the orthodox than was Nehru. "Gandhi was essentially a man of religion," Nehru wrote, "a Hindu to the innermost depths of his being, and yet his concep tion of religion had nothing to do with dogma or custom or ritual." It is not too far-fetched to see this as a description of Nehru himself. Religion, then, contrary to outward appearances, did not really separate the two. Gandhi, it is fair to say, gave concrete expression to the vagueness of Nehru's own beliefs. But where Gandhi and Nehru came closest together was in their understanding of the social function of religion in regard to the national destiny of India. What I have, in mind is the opposition of Nehru and Gandhi, along with almost all leaders of the Indian National Congress, to the demands principally from Muslim spokesmen, but also from smaller religious groups, for special representation in the legisla tures as communities. Nehru's objections to communal awards were expressed in the language of secular politics. He gave an admirable summary of these arguments in 1944: "Separate elec torates weakened the groups that were already weak or backward; they encouraged separatist tendencies and prevented the growth of national unity, they were the negation of democracy, they created</page><page sequence="12">176 / The Social Function of Religion new vested interests of the most reactionary kind, they lowered standards, and they diverted attention from the economic problems of the country which were common to all." As with so much else, Jawaharlal Nehru gave elegant expres sion to enlightened nationalist sentiment when he told the Punjab Provincial Congress in 1928 that since Hindu-Muslim antagonism was rooted in the economic exploitation fostered by imperialism, it would disappear with the coming of political independence and the creation of a just economic order: It is an outcome largely of anger and passion, and when we regain our tempers it will fade into nothingness. It is a myth with no connection with reality, and it cannot endure. It is really the creation of our educated classes in search of office and employment... What does it matter to the Muslim peasant whether a Hindu or Muslim is a judge in Lahore? Economic issues run along different lines. There is a great deal in common between the Muslim and Sikh and Hindu (landlords): and a great deal in common between the Muslim and Sikh and Hindu peasantry, but very little in common between a Muslim peasant and a Muslim (landlord). We must, therefore, begin to think of... economic issues. If we do so, the myth of communalism will automatically disappear. I have no doubt that Nehru at this juncture genuinely believed that imperial exploitation and manipulation were the causes of the antagonisms and communal violence that were threatening to rend the social fabric of India. What was to be the basis of the national unity that would make it possible to build a democratic, repre sentative government that could address itself to the social and economic problems of which he was so painfully aware? Was it possible in the context of the 1930s and 1940s to have found some ideology that might have fulfilled Nehru's vision of a united India? There were a number of possibilities, even if they were not prob abilities. One model that had considerable appeal for him was that of the Soviet Union, which he felt "had advanced human society by a great lead and ... had laid the foundations for that new civilisation toward which the world would advance. It was not, however, a model that seemed available for India. Quite a different possibility was urged with great vigour by powerful voices for the creation of Indian unity based upon a frank acknowledgement that India was a Hindu country. Nehru rejected this vision, not only</page><page sequence="13">AINSLEE T. EMBREE / 177 because he saw even a discussion of it producing violence, but also because it stood for everything he found repellent in religion. A third possibility, and much more a probability than the other two, was a state based not on individual representation but on religious communities. This, too, he rejected because of his understanding of the function of religion in society. The model that he saw as making possible a united India was that of secularism. r ■ lhe conflict situations in which the Muslim minorities were involved were inextricably linked with a commitment of JL Indian nationalist leaders, particularly Nehru, to secularism, a term that underwent a considerable transformation as it passed from its nineteenth century British origins to become a major component of Indian political discourse. The word is familiar enough in western usage, with an emphasis on life lived without religious faith. This use carries with it a fairly explicit denial of a role for religion in shaping cultural values and led to an attack on the concept by religious leaders in the west. Illustrations of an instinctive dislike of secularism vary from the Kulturkampf of Bismarck's Germany, when, in the eyes of the authorities of the Roman Catholic Church it was equated with liberalism, to the attack on "secular humanism" by modern American fundamen talists who see it (no doubt correctly) as a covert undermining of the Christian American way of life. In India, on the other hand, the word seems to have had no such pejorative connotation, and one finds few comparable rejections of the term by religious spokes men. One reason for this is the organisational structure of the dominant Indian religious traditions, with neither Hinduism nor Islam having institutions that are fundamental to their belief sys tems as the church is to Christianity in all its sectarian variations. The more immediate reason for the acceptance of secularism as an expression of a basic commitment of Indian nationalism, however, is that it was given a definition that was quite different from the western usage. As is so often the case with the vocabulary of Indian politics, it was infused with meanings that were resonant of India's own cultural and historical experience. Secularism did not imply any disparagement of religion or rejection of the impor tance of its values for society; but only that no religion would be given a special recognition by the state and that all religions would</page><page sequence="14">178 / The Social Function of Religion have equal status and equal honour. Secularism, in this reading, meant that the numerical majority, the Hindus, would not use their power to give Hinduism a favoured place over other religions. The adoption of secularism as a fundamental aspect of nationalist politics was intended to answer those who feared—or hoped—that the state would favour Hindus who were the overwhelming majority of the population and whose religion was identified with the dominant cultural patterns. While the word "secularism" was not used by the early nationalist leaders in the late nineteenth century, when they in sisted that the Indian National Congress spoke for Indians as Indians and not as Hindus even though the majority of them were of that religion, they were asserting religious neutrality, not hos tility or indifference. This version of secularism was suited to the temperament of articulate Hindu intellectuals with their insistence that all religions were true and that the varieties of religious experience were pathways to the same truth. That this truth as defined by Ram Mohan Roy and Swami Vivekananda excluded truth as understood by Muslims, as well as by minor groups such as the Christians and, possibly, the Sikhs, seems not to have been understood by those who espoused it. Advocates of secularism in India always insisted, therefore, that far from being hostile to religion they valued it, whatever its particular expression, for the contribution it could make to the well-being of society. They did not recognise any threats to social harmony in a polity that insisted that all religions, by their very nature, were beneficial. This is true, judging by his public state ments, even of Jawaharlal Nehru who professed to have been influenced by Marx's analysis of society. Nehru excoriated religious groups when they supported communalism, as he saw this as a major factor in producing violence in India, but, at least publicly, he did not draw the logical conclusion that religion in whatever sectarian mode it expressed itself, was a threat to the just social order he envisioned. Instead of attacking religion as a social ly debilitating false ideology that required eradication, Nehru, like most Indian liberals and social democrats, argued for a "true" interpretation of religion, against one that led to violence and dissension. The role of the modern nation-state has also added to the complexity involved in the concept of secularism in India. The</page><page sequence="15">AINSLEE T. EMBREE / 179 Indian nationalist leaders, at least by the 1920s, assumed that the state would be the dominant factor in all public concerns. This reflected the idea of the state that had become common in the twentieth century, but the function of the Indian National Congress in the life of the nation added another dimension to this, because before independence the Congress had become identified with the nation in opposition to the British Government. The consequences of this after 1947, when the Congress became the Government, has often been noted by political commentators, for it became difficult to differentiate between the party, the government, and the state. For the policy of secularism, this meant that the personal religious preferences of party leaders and politicians were confused with the national culture, or, to use a related concept, this meant that Hin duism had become equated with the civic religion. rTphe Indian version of secularism is based, not upon a rejection of transcendental values, but upon almost a polar opposite JL view: the assumption that all religions, in some fashion, are true, and therefore no rational person will take offense at another's ritual. Secularism was regarded, probably correctly, as a charac teristically Indian solution, based on Indian metaphysics. Paradoxically, it is in the working out of what is one of the most admirable features of India—the process of political democracy— that religion and politics form their explosive mixture. Perhaps the most important element of religious politics in India has to do with the nature of India's political representation. Some of the decisions that led to India's present political structure, while ensuring democracy, also made inevitable the conflicts that followed from the intertwining of religion and politics. At the beginning of the century, before a measure of representative government was instituted in India in 1909 (through the Indian Councils Act, usually known as the Morley-Minto reforms), the great issue had been what form such representation should take. The leaders of the dominant nationalist group, the Indian National Congress, were insistent that representation, however the franchise might be defined, should not recognise any difference between Indians on the basis of religion. What they wanted, they insisted, was the establishment in India of responsible, representative government on the pattern of Great Britain and Canada, with the</page><page sequence="16">180 / The Social Function of Religion will of the numerical majority being the will of the people. The British answer was that western political institutions had grown up in a particular society and could not be transferred to another one so different in its composition as India, which was not a nation but a subcontinent composed of many nations. For the vocal Mus lim leadership, representative government on the western model, as demanded by the Congress, meant the permanent subjection of the Muslim minority to the Hindu majority. They demanded separate electorates so as to ensure the Muslims a share of power in the new framework of government. The 1909 Act was a curious compromise in that it conceded separate electorates to the Mus lims, to the intense anger of the Congress leadership, but at the same time it established the principle of majority rule. The question was insistently asked: how are the rights of minorities to be safeguarded? This is a point that had received little consideration in the nineteenth-century British liberal political thought which the Indians had drawn from. Liberal political thinkers had been concerned with the rights of minority opinions, but the issue in India was very different: not the right of dissenting opinion and individual freedom, but the enforcement by govern ment of the customs and social practices of religious communities. This included all the vast corpus of law dealing with inheritance, marriage and family relationships. Could the majority legislate for minority groups in these matters, or were the internal laws of religious groups parallel to those of the state and enforceable by it? The question of the applicability of the nation's laws to all its citizens, in regard to such matters as marriage, divorce and in heritance, irrespective of membership in religious groups, has been challenged most notably by Muslim leaders, although some Chris tian groups were also involved. There appeared to be some con fusion in India, as in other liberal democracies, between the concept of religious freedom, one of the most cherished rights that has emerged in the long struggle of the individual against the state, and group rights. Religious freedom, in the language of the Indian constitution, means the right to practice and propagate one's faith, without hindrance from the state, but increasingly this has been interpreted to mean that the government should, in effect, support through law the customs that a community claims are basic to its internal life.</page><page sequence="17">AINSLEE T. EMBREE / 181 Nehru's vision of a secular society has come under frequent attack in recent years as communal and ethnic violence has ravaged the country. It is argued that Nehru's secularism has increased communal tension by encouraging religious groups to push ex travagant claims. But it is hard to imagine that any other model would have done as well. It was based, as Nehru insisted, not on foreign ideas, but came from the very nature of Indian society. In a world torn by religious strife, where the voices of religious fanaticism grow louder, Nehru's voice speaks for reason and har mony.</page><page sequence="18">Perhaps there was too much of religion in one sense; the word is English, smacks too much of things external such as creeds, rites, an external piety; there is no one Indian equivalent. But if we give rather to religion the sense of the following of the spiritual impulse in its fullness and define spirituality as the attempt to know and live in the highest self, the divine, the all-embracing unity and to raise life in all its parts to the divinest possible values, then it is evident that there was not too much of religion, but rather too little of it—and in what there was,a too one-sided and therefore insuffi ciently ample tendency The right remedy is not to belittle still farther the age-long ideal of India, but to return to its old amplitude and give it a still wider scope, to make in very truth all the life of the nation a religion in this high spiritual sense. —Sri Aurobindo (1872-1950), The Foundations of Indian Culture, Vol. 14</page></plain_text>
