<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE TARGUMS AND THE NEW TESTAMENT ALLEN WIKGREN* IT IS over twenty years since Rendel Harris, in an article in the Expositor, concluded that "the time is ripe for a renewed critical study of the Targums, both from the point of view of textual criticism and from the standpoint of higher criticism, and in particular fur- ther investigation is required into the re- action of the Targums on the New Testa- ment."' For reasons which will be indi- cated below, it should be of some interest to students of the New Testament to note the bases for this judgment, to ob- serve what has or has not been done in this area in the past quarter of a century or so, and to make some acquaintance with the materials available at the pres- ent time for such a study. Professor Harris rightly assumed that, as he put it in his article, "the Christian church must have passed through a state of Targumism, if it emerges from the Synagogue in which Targumism pre- vails."2 This is a point which deserves wider critical consideration than it has received. After Hebrew had become un- intelligible to the common people, the custom arose of translating the text of the Scriptures read in the religious serv- ice into the current Aramaic speech. Whether or not this custom should in origin be ascribed, as it traditionally is, * Dr. Wikgren took his doctorate in the Uni- versity of Chicago in 1932. He has taught in the Divinity School of the Universitysince 194I. His pre- vious writing has been mostly in the area of textual criticism of the New Testament, but he has also re- cently concerned himself with the Semitic back- ground of the early Christian documents. "Traces of Targumism in the New Testament," Expositor, XXXII (I920-21), 376. 2Ibid. to the times of Ezra,3 it was doubtless in vogue in the New Testament period. Most of the earliest "Christians," there- fore, as well as their Jewish compatriots, were dependent upon the Aramaic transla- tion or paraphrase of the Hebrew Old Tes- tament text for their understanding of the Scripture lesson of Synagogue worship. It would be of more than passing interest to know, then, what this Targum was like, particularly since available evidence indicates that it often, and especially in this earlier period, partook of the nature of a free, interpretative rendition of the Hebrew, together with midrashic addi- tion and comment, and would naturally represent a current Jewish exegesis of Scripture that must have influenced the religious thinking of these first Chris- tians. As is well known, reflections of this in- fluence are to be seen in the phraseology and thought of New Testament writers,4 in their knowledge of Jewish customs and traditions, and in the proof-text method of using Scripture. Dr. Frants Buhl considered it not impossible that certain Old Testament quotations in the New Testament might have been taken from a Targum such as the one on Job 3 An ascription based primarily on Neh. 8:8 (see Nedarim 37b). 4 R. Harris gives examples in the article referred to above, noting, e.g., certain anti-anthropomorphic circumlocutions common in the Targums for the divine name, such as "the right hand of majesty" (Heb. 3:I) and "the right hand of power" (Heb. 8: ). Cf. Mark I4:6I f. Midrashic material in the Gospels and haggada in Paul naturally come to mind.

H. Toy's proposal that quotations which de- part from both the Hebrew and the Sep- tuagint texts may be explained as de- pendent upon an Aramaic Targum, most probably oral7-a viewpoint more re- cently set forth in a paper before the Manchester University Egyptian and Oriental Society and briefly summarized in the Journal of the Society.8 Related to these is also the suggestion of Rendel Harris that the divergences originated in the use of a book of "Testimonies" compiled from the Old Testament for use in the refutation of the Jews.9 s Tosephta Sabbath XIII, 2 f., ed.

Cf. A. Lukyn Williams, Adversus Judaeos (Cam- bridge, I935), and B. W. Bacon, Studies in Matthew (New York, 1930), appended Notes II, V, VI, and VII. Bacon says here (p. 475), regarding the Mat- thean quotations showing familiarity with the Hebrew text (about io per cent): "We have as- cribed these to N, meaning thereby an Aramaic targum of MK to which the Scripture fulfillments had been attached. Others ascribe them to an early (Aramaic?) collection of testimonia." These various suggestions about the Matthean quotations may, in my opinion, be favorably com- pared with the conjectures recently adumbrated by Professor Torrey in Documents of the Primitive Church (New York and London, 1941) relative to certain of them which he would explain as mis- translations of the Hebrew text. A targumic source or influence would as readily, though less ingenious- ly, account for the data-if it needs accounting for in this way-as well as square with the fact of the It may be of interest to note, in pass- ing, that one of the purposes of the Tar- gums in their departure from the He- brew text, the removal of unworthy con- ceptions of God and the patriarchs,'? is paralleled in the Gospels in alterations made by the authors of Matthew and Luke in the text of Mark. Expressions of affection, anger, amazement, and annoy- ance which would detract from the ideal stature of Jesus are eliminated or modi- fied." Certain derogatory statements about the disciples are treated in the same fashion.12 Students of the Synoptic Gospels are well aware of how the writers have revised their source material be- cause of stylistic, doctrinal, ecclesiastical, missionary, and personal interests. Re- cent research in the identification and history of forms of gospel tradition has also given us an insight into this process and its motivations in preliterary stages. Although no necessary connection is here claimed with Targums per se, yet their study reveals a situation in which such activity would be natural and in which sources were dealt with rather freely. This would be especially true, then, of tradition still in an oral state and not in- vested with the sanctions of sacred litera- ture.

The question now naturally arises, however, regarding the value of the Tar- gums in their present available form as a source for knowledge of Jewish exegetical thought, particularly in the first century A.D. What may be gained, for example, by their use, as over against the use of the rabbinic literature as a whole, if, as is generally alleged, the ideas presented by both are much the same? In reply to these inquiries, we may observe some ad- vantages which appear to exist in an ap- proach through at least certain targum- ic texts. In the first place, although there is certainly much more material per linear foot in the Talmud, the inherent associa- tion of the Targums with the biblical text has furnished a control which obvi- ates much of the rambling and often dis- connected presentation of the talmudic writings. Again, although we may miss that ascription of sayings to individual rabbinic teachers which gives a conven- ient method of dating material in the Talmud, the midrashim which occur in the Targum were naturally such as had found general acceptance at the time and place of promulgation in this manner.'3 Certainly, by association with the Scrip- tures in the Synogague service they could hardly fail to obtain a special sanction and influence. That such influence even reached out and affected the text of the Septuagint was long ago postulated by an excellent pioneer worker in this area, "3 Dr. A. Berliner in the valuable introductory material contained in his edition of the text of Onkelos (Targum Onkelos [Berlin, I884]) gives his confirmation to the opinion that, where differing viewpoints were involved, the Targumist gives the generally current reading wherever possible. Zacharias Frankel,I4 and restated most recently in a linguistic study by Pinkhos Churgin.'s Moreover, we possess material among the Targums which has apparent- ly not been subjected to as thorough a revisionary process as have most of the talmudic writings. Such data are found particularly in the Pentateuchal Pales- tinian Targums variously known as Pseudo-Jonathan or Jerushalmi I, and Jerushalmi II or The Fragment. These, when compared with such an "official" version as Onkelos, or, more accurately, Babli, or the Babylonian Targum, ap- pear to reflect more primitive ideas be- cause of the larger element of early mid- rash permitted to remain in them, since they did not enjoy that official status which would have made it advisable in a later period to conform them more closely to the Hebrew text and to the then prevalent rabbinic exegesis. Read- ings, therefore, later castigated by the rabbis as objectionable, may still be found here. Nor do they reflect as much of the reaction to the Christian move- ment which resulted in the removal or modification of messianic and other allu- sions and interpretations originally pres- ent in the generally accepted transla- tions.'6 Hence, we are much more likely I4 See especially Vorstudien zur Septuaginta (Leipzig, I84I), pp. I85-9I. I5 "The Targum and the Septuagint," American Journalof SemiticLanguagesand Literatures,L (i933), 4I-65. Churgin believes that he has demonstrated this influence to be "an irrefutable certainty" and that it explains the different strata in the Septu- agint as due in part to a progressive but not uni- formly effected revision of the text under the in- fluence of the Palestinian exegesis. 16 E.g., comparing the Babylonian and Palestin- ian Targums in Gen. I:I, 2, 26; 5:24. Herbert Loewe refers to this as evidence for an early dating cf the Targums thus: "The Targum was a popular translation of the Bible; its care to turn any phrase used Christologically by Jewish-Christians shows that it must have been current-not necessarily in its present form-before the split between Judaism 9I</page><page sequence="4">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION to find data here which originated in the first century, or, indeed, in the period of the first formulation of the Targums. In thus summarily constructing a pic- ture of the relationships between the Targums and certain influences bearing upon their literary history, I have chosen to adopt the opinions of only some of the scholars who have labored in this area.I7 Since differing views exist regarding the dates of these documents'8 and since the particular viewpoint adopted is of rather crucial significance for the thesis of our study, our reconstruction ought here to be given some extensive docu- mentation. We must, however, content ourselves with referring to the technical treatments of the scholars mentioned and of giving a brief statement of the trend of thought on the subject. The generally prevalent opinion of the nineteenth century made the midrashic Targums later than the comparatively literal versions attributed to Onkelos and Jonathan and often dated them as late as the seventh to ninth centuries A.D. by virtue of their midrashic charac- ter, historical allusions,19 and use of many Greek and foreign words and names.20 Much modern critical opinion, and Christianity" (Judaism and Christianity, ed. H. Loewe [London and New York, I937], I, I42, n.2). 17 E.g., Frankel, Geiger, Bacher, Berliner. 8 E.g., Pinkhos Churgin, in his dissertation, Targum Jonathan to the Prophets (New Haven, I927), emphatically states that the midrashic Targums are at least as late as or later than those of Onkelos and Jonathan. Zunz (Die gottesdienstlichen Vortrdge der Juden [Berlin, I832]), although recognizing some very ancient elements in the Palestinian Targum, dated it, in its present form, in the middle of the seventh century. 19 E.g., to Constantinople, the Lombards, mem- bers of Mohammed's family, etc. 20 See Samuel Krauss, Griechische und lateinische Lehnworter im Talmud, Midrasch und Targum (2 vols.; Berlin, I898-99). however, inclines to the view that the midrashic nature reflects an earlier, rather than a later, stage in the transmis- sion of the Targums; that the language,21 as well as the thought, is in a more un- revised condition; that very ancient, as well as late, historical allusions occur in them and should be given due considera- tion;22 and that the presence of Greek words indicates composition in a period when Greek was commonly used and understood. In short, the Palestinian Targums may be considered to be curious compounds or mosaics of things new and old. On this point there appears to be quite general agreement, the differences in dating being due, in the main, to the relative weight accorded the earlier and later elements, respectively, in attempts to fix a time for the literary composition 21 See M. Neumark, Lexikalische Untersuchungen zur Sprache der jerusalemischen Pentateuch-Targume (Berlin, I905). Cf. G. Dalman, Grammatik des judisch-paldstinischen Aramaisch nach den Idiomen des paldstinischen Talmud, des Onkelostargum und Prophetentargum und der jerusalemischen Targume (2d ed.; Leipzig, 1905). It is the opinion of several scholars (e.g., Paul Kahle) that the Palestinian Targums give us the best available picture of the popular spoken Aramaic of Palestine, the Babylonian being in their present form a "Kunstsprache." In this connection we may note, then, that any early material contained in them should be of considerable value in studies of the Ara- maic background of the Gospels, a subject which has received much attention again of late and to which we have already briefly alluded. See above, n. 9, and the contrary viewpoints exhibited in such re- cent articles as E. J. Goodspeed, "The Possible Aramaic Gospel," Journal of Near Eastern Studies, I (I942), 315-40, and S. Feigin, "The Original Language of the Gospels," Journal of Near Eastern Studies, II (I943), 187-97, and excellently sum- marized and criticized by C. C. McCown in "Ara- maic and Greek Gospels," Anglican Theological Review, XXV (I943), 281-94. Cf. also F. C.

Geiger, op. cit., observed that, although additions and correc- tions reaching down into the eighth century may be identified, "anderseits erhielten sich, gerade wie in den palistinischen Midraschim und der jerusalem- ische Gemara, auch in jerusalemischen Thargum viele alte Elemente, und dieses bietet, in noch gr6s- serem Masse als die Werke der palastinischen Halachah, die merkwtirdigste Zusammenstellung von Altem und Neuem" (p. I65). In the same volume, in an excursus on the Jerusalem Targum, he in- dicates that the Aramaic versions, which were first not literary translations but interpretations and ex- pansions of the biblical text representing the view- point of the older halacha and haggada, were later conformed to the text under the influence of the scribes of Palestine, so that a translation guild (the Methargemin, Thurgemanim, Methurgemanim) be- came responsible for them (p. 452). Geiger also gives arguments for early date from linguistic data and historical allusion. He believes that Jerushalmi II contains earlier elements than Jerushalmi I. Weber, in System der altsynagogalen paldstinischen Theologie aus Targum, Midrasch und Talmud (Leipzig, i880), presents arguments also for an early dating of materials in the Palestinian Targums and declares them a valuable source, critically used, for knowledge of the Jewish religion of ancient Palestine. However, he dates the documents in their present form in the seventh century. Berliner, on the other hand, favors a date in the second half of the second century (op. cit., pp. 102 ff.). He points out, among other things, that the systematic effort to remove anthropomor- phisms and other objectionable expressions does not belong to the later talmudic age and that the halachic and haggadic elements in these Targums point to a period before and contemporary with R. Akiba and his disciples. A. T. Olmstead, op. cit., pp. 62 f., asserts that "the large amount of midrashic material still preserved in Pseudo-Jonathan is for the most part pre-Christian..... " Pertinent evidence disclosed in connection with other studies could also be cited. E.g., Harris and Mingana, in The Odes and Psalms of Solomon (Manchester, London, and New York, I920), use the Targums as the "decisive factor" in the solution of the problem of the original language of the odes and observe with respect to discoverable influence of the targum in the odes that "it is of value with regard to the Targum itself, whose antiquity and written transmission is established more clearly than ever" and that "the odes in so far as they reflect The exploitation of such targumic sources as may appear to be of superior value for our purposes will, however, be no easy undertaking. While much valu- able work has been done by scholars like Montefiore, Billerbeck, Klausner, Her- ford, Strack, G. Friedliinder, Ginsburger, and others to make the data available, many differences of opinion exist re- garding origin, date, and applicability of the materials. An indiscriminate, un- critical, and eclectic citation of evidence, apart from considerations of context and time of composition, will not suffice, whether made from the original texts or from secondary compilations. In fact, such procedure in the past has been largely responsible for both the misuse and the disuse of the Targums as sources of information for the early Christian peri- od. Reliable results will depend upon a meticulous application of textual, source, literary, sociohistorical, and every other pertinent criticism to the Aramaic texts by scholars thoroughly conversant with both the language and the thought of the documents. the Targum, acquire additional worth and value, and constitute a precious link between the Judaism of Palestine in the first century of our era and the Christianity of the same period" (p. 172). Moses Gaster, in The Asatir (London, 1927), sets forth the interesting view that this Samaritan document is an early (250-200 B.C.) collection of Aramaic para- phrases and legends representing the initial stage in Targum formation, of which the Palestinian Targums represent the secondary phase of development, and that Josephus' Antiquities is but an enlarged Tar- gum in Greek. As a result of his comparison of the Asatir with Josephus, the Palestinian Targums, Mandean literature, the Sibylline Oracles, and other pseudepigraphic literature,he incidentally con- cludes that the Palestinian Targum in its legal inter- pretations "represents very old traditions," that it is the "oldest of its kind," and that it is to be placed as "contemporary with Josephus or even of a some- what earlier date" (pp. 80-84). For other evidence of early literary activity of targumic character one may compare the Book of Jubilees, generally dated I35-105 B.c. 93</page><page sequence="6">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION But, even before studies of this kind can be attempted, work of a more basic nature is required to provide tools for the task. For, strange to relate, there is no complete, uniform, available critical edi- tion of the text of the Targums! The older editions, besides being based on in- adequate evidence, have become as scarce as the manuscripts; or, in the great polyglot Bibles, are difficult to use and not generally available. The text given in rabbinical Bibles is not suffi- ciently accurate. A number of editions and textual studies of individual books exist, but several of these are antiquated, and some are hidden away in inaccessi- ble periodical literature. The situation is complicated somewhat also by the fact that manuscripts upon which some of the older editions were based have since disappeared.24 Although the German Oriental Society, meeting in Breslau in I857, decided to undertake the publica- tion of critical texts, nothing was defi- nitely accomplished. Some major contributions toward that end, however, have been made. Lagarde, in 1872, published a careful copy of the consonantal text of the famous Reuchlin Codex of the Prophets, dated A.D. I I05 ;25 and in I873 he produced an edition of the hagiographa from the Bomberg rabbinic Bible of I5I8, upon which several subse- quent texts had been based.26 Cornill, in I886-87, published a collation of the Bomberg-Buxtorf, Antwerp Polyglot, and Reuchlin codex texts in the Proph- ets.27 In 1884 Berliner issued an edition 24 E.g., the Venice (I59I) and Sabionetta (I557) editions. 2s Prophetae Chaldaice (Leipzig). 26 Hagiographa Chaldaice (Leipzig). 27 Ezekiel in Das Buch des Propheten Ezechiel (Leipzig, I886); the other Prophets in Zcitschrift fur die alttestamentliche Wissenschaft, VII (I887), I77- 202. of Onkelos from the excellent but scarce Sabionetta text of 1557, the manuscript of which, as wehave noted, has disappeared.28 In 1899 Moses Ginsburgerpublished a text of the Fragmentary Targum edited from the extant manuscripts,29 and in I930 Paul Kahle in the series of studies of pre- massoretic Hebrew grammar produced a study and edition of the Cairo Geniza and other fragments of the Palestinian Pentateuchal Targums.30 Other new manuscripts have been discovered and studied.31 These developments and ef- forts have helped to make available a fairly good consonantal text of the Tar- gums to the Pentateuch and Prophets. Where vocalization has been attempted, however, great diversity unfortunately still exists in both manuscripts and edi- tions.32 The chaotic and unsatisfactory condi- tions which also existed fifty or sixty years ago in the area of lexicography and grammar of Aramaic have been con- siderably changed by important, basic research in these disciplines; and a num- ber of excellent, indispensable publica- tions of the results are now available.33 28 Op. cit.

Moreover, although the pentateuchal Targums exist in English as rendered by J. W. Etheridge,36 this edition appeared some eighty years ago and the volumes are not commonly to be found. Only a very few individual books have otherwise been published in translation.37 For the by Samuel Krauss, Vienna, 1937), and Krupnik, Baruch, and Bilberman (London, I927); the con- cordances to Onkelos of Brederek (Giessen, 1906) and Kassovsky (Jerusalem, I940); the grammars of Dalman (2d ed.; Leipzig, I905), dealing specifically with the Targums, of Marti (3d ed.; Berlin, I925), Strack (6th. ed.; Munich, 1921), and Bauer and Leander (Halle, I927), dealing with biblical Aramaic, of W.

One may, however, gain an acquaintance with the haggadic elements in the Tar- gums through the use of Louis Ginz- berg's The Legends of the Jews, which is now completely accessible in English.38 It is clear from this brief sketch that, notwithstanding great progress, much work remains to be done in the area un- der consideration and that interesting problems await the investigator.39 In particular, it seems to be no rash assump- tion to suppose that, when the data of the Targums are made available to us through competent, critical interpreta- tion, we may find them a valuable source for the understanding of religious thought and biblical exegesis in Palestine in the very years of the genesis of the Christian movement and the production of the literature of the New Testament. his commentary (Berlin, I878), Ecclesiastes by Ginsburg in his commentary (London, I86I), Song of Solomon by Gollancz (London, I908), Isaiah by Pauli (London, 1871); and in German, Joshua (Berlin, I899) and Judges (Berlin, 1900) by Pra- torius. 38 Translated from the German by Henrietta Szold (6th ed., 6 vols.

The bibliographical references are also, of course, very incomplete. Especially, many im- portant Jewish scholars-e.g., the pioneer, S. D. Luzatto-are not even mentioned. I am greatly indebted to my colleague, Professor Samuel I. Feigin, of the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago, for stimulation of interest in this area both through courses in the Targums and through extracurricular contacts, as well as for criticism of the present article. 95</page></plain_text>
