<plain_text><page sequence="1">The High Green Hill. Gerald Vann, O.P. London: Collins. 172 Pp. 7/6 net. Some of the climbing up Father Vann's hill is by unnecessary by paths, but it is worth while to gain the summit. This is another collection of spiritual talks, in which there is much psychology and innumerable arresting applica tions of spiritual principles, but with very little interrelation or unity of effect. There is somewhat of a spate of them at present, and one is alternately delighted by then1 fresh, readable treatment and irritated by the fragmentary im pression left at the end of it all. These talks are given in such disparate contexts as the religious profession of a nun and the B.B.C. Third Programme. Hence their very brilliancy in their own setting results in unevenness and sudden changes of tone when put together. Yet it must be admitted (with the dust-cover) that there is a unity of atmosphere, the atmos phere of a personality, Fr. Vann's. His highly personal approach to the spiritual life is that of the mystics, a living approach. "It is not enough to learn about God, we have to learn God, to experience God." But Fr. Vann has also experienced man?in life, and very obviously in books. He has his finger on the modern man's idea of life. He wishes to cure that "sense of sin without God"; but neither will he be satisfied with "a sense of God without a sense of sin." Charity, love of God, is not just almsgiving, " it is a radical change in one's being." Fr. Vann sees our personal struggles in the light of the world struggle of good and evil. In his universal, ail-embracing view of this life and the next, he, like Fr. Zeller, is something of a monkish Whitman. His great love of life has, too, something of idiosyncrasy, like Whitman's. His pet comparison with the spiritual life is the intuition and creation of art; and "the mystery and wonder that lie at the heart of all created things." Perhaps his tone is some what anthropomorphic, but he begins from the man's side, from the sinner's side, because, for him, as for P?guy, the sinner who has discovered hell in his sin may be more alive to God than the un awakened Christian. Alive, awake ?those are his key ideas. He would lead us on from there, with Dostoievsky's words?"The roots of our thoughts and feelings are not here but in other worlds." The spiritual life is not a system imposed from without?it should be a personal, spontaneous adop tion of God's interests from within. "The Apostolate of Satan" is one of the better talks, where Fr. Vann brings us face to face with</page><page sequence="2">New Books 727 the Darkness for a change, and tries to disentangle the doctrine from its popular symbols of horns and tails. But the central and longest piece?''Man's Response to the Trinity"?is also the summit of The High Green Hill. Any priest who has faced the problem of a non-philosophical sermon on the Trinity will appreciate the success of this talk. Metaphysics right down to everyday spiritual life,? with faith in God's fatherhood or providence, hope in the friendship of the Son, and love in the in dwelling Spirit. From this deep source flows the stream of all the virtues?patience, joy, peace? down to the "Be kind, be kind, and you will be saints" of Ruys broeck. This book should be bought for this talk. Perhaps Fr. Vann's spirituality presupposes a certain level of thought and cultivation, but we must be grateful to a man who assumes and proves that the spiritual life is for the whole man, and not for a classified, sub divided, and systematized robot.
