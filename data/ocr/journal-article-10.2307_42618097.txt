Stebbins, Jr. Chester Dale Fellow ig6y-ig68 National Gallery of Art The Notch of the White Mountains ( Crawford Notch ), painted by Thomas Cole in 1839, is the first work by this American master to enter the collection of the National Gallery of Art (Fig. i).1 Its acquisition is timely and appropriate, for Cole is generally considered the leading mem- ber of the "Hudson River School" - the nine- teenth-century American landscapists whose work has recently begun to receive close atten- tion from scholars and from the public. The Notch is an important addition to the fine small group of American landscapes at the National Gallery, and it compliments as well the rich holdings of Cole elsewhere in Washington. Thomas Cole (1801-1848) has been called "the founder of native American landscape painting" and this is not entirely inaccurate, though he was born in England and did not come to America until 18 18. He was the first American painter of the wilderness and quickly became the leader of the American landscape school. It is a well known story that in 1825 three of the most celebrated artists of the time - Trum- bull; William Dunlap, the biographer; and Asher B. Durand, the engraver and portraitist - saw in a shop three small landscapes by the young Cole, who had just arrived in New York. *© The Trustees of the National Gallery of Art, 1969. Each of the three was stunned by Cole's ability, and each bought one of the paintings for him- self. Dunlap reports Trumbull saying, "this youth has done what I have all my life attempted in vain." 2 It is hard to see at first why Trumbull would have been so impressed. His own work had far more polish. But what he and others must have sensed was that the young, untrained, English- born artist brought to the canvas a new concep- tion of landscape - a unique emotional and artis- tic commitment to the American wilderness. William Cullen Bryant reported, "From that time he had a fixed reputation . . . ," and he de- scribed the unique quality which Cole's work conveyed to the viewer, . . the delight which was expressed at the opportunity of contemplat- ing pictures which carried the eye over scenes of wild grandeur peculiar to our country, over our aerial mountaintops with their mighty growth of forest never touched by the axe, along the banks of streams never deformed by culture. . . 3 Thomas Cole is one of the most complex fig- ures in the history of American art. He was the epitome of the American Romantic: poet, traveler, architect, essayist, and not least, painter. As early as 1834, William Dunlap spoke of "Mr. XNGA 2328. Canvas, 40 x 61 14 in.

During his lifetime and ever since, Cole has been considered the founder of the Hudson River School, that is, of the realistic landscape style in this country. Yet Cole was unique in his time; he was deeply religious, a pessimistic, moralizing artist who was at once drawn to and repelled by the wilderness to which he led the American artist. He was an idealist in an age that de- manded realism, and his great popular and criti- cal success may be more a tribute to the sheer power of his imagination and painterly tech- nique than to his loyalty to the popular aesthetic. Cole is a transitional figure between the imag- inary, the idealized, and the tender-hearted landscapes which preceded him and the more realistic ones which followed. From the begin- ning, there were two sides to Cole's style, realis- tic and imaginary. Thus, in Landscape with Tree TrunĶs, 1827, at Providence, one sees Cole react- ing in a personal way to the magnificence of the Catskills; he loves the wilderness but is aghast at its awfulness. In a specifically religious painting of the same year, John the Baptist in the Wilder- ness (The Wads worth Atheneum, Hartford; Fig. 2) Cole added a group of figures to a land- scape based on his Catskill studies, but his ap- proach is not far from that in Landscape with Tree TrunĶs. Both paintings illustrate his deep feelings about nature and the prophetic vision, as proclaimed in his Lecture on American Scenery : "It was on Mt. Horeb that Elijah witnessed the mighty wind, the earthquake, the fire, and heard the still small voice, and that voice is yet heard among the mountains! St. John preached in the desert; the wilderness is yet a fitting place in which to speak of God." 6 However, in the following year, the Expulsion from the Garden of Eden (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston) showed that his "ideal" or reli- gious paintings were departing more and more from reality, as color, foliage, and topography become more affected and less believable. The artist's first European trip (1829-32) certainly played a role in this process. His travels, par- ticularly his experience in Italy, enlarged his artistic ambitions and skills. His contempt for mere "views" increased; his own productions tended to divide more clearly into the ideal works he loved and the scenes he did on demand. Barbara Novak O'Doherty has described this de- velopment, noting Cole's increasing religiousness on one hand and growing American taste for precisely realistic scenes on the other.7 Mrs. O'Doherty documents the artist's struggles to find patrons for his moralizing, allegorical "series paintings," such as The Course of Empire (1836) or The Voyage of Life (1840), and the efforts of such collectors as Robert Gilmore to turn him back to realism. In 1830, Asher B. Durand reproduced a series of six engravings of famous American sights such as the Delaware Water Gap and Fort Putnam at West Point. In his introduction, Durand pledged that the scenery's "characteristic features will, in all cases, be truly and correctly copied." 8 This creed became the aesthetic of the next generation of landscapists, who followed Durand's advice while respecting Cole as a great talent of the past. Cole never gave in to this engraver's point of view. In 1838 he wrote Durand asking: "Have you not found - I have - that I never succeed in painting scenes, however beau- tiful, immediately on returning from them. I must wait for time to draw a veil over the 4Dunlap, op. cit. in note 2 above, p. 351. RH. T. Tuckerman, Boo' of the Artists, New York, 1867, p. 225. 8T.

While he was in Italy he corresponded about commissions with a number of patrons in the United States and was in touch as well with wealthy Americans who were traveling in Europe. One of these was Rufus Lord (1782-1869), who as a young man had to come to New York to go into the dry goods business. He founded his own firm and was to retire in 1830 with one of the largest fortunes in America. Having dissolved his firm, Lord built himself a large house on St. John's Park in New York and then went on a Grand Tour of Europe.10 Figure 4. Thomas Cole, sketch for An Italian Composi- tion with a Tower Bridge, The Detroit Institute of Arts. When Rufus Lord traveled to Florence in 1831, he met Thomas Cole and asked the artist to paint a picture for him. Cole must have replied in the affirmative, for in the only surviving letter between them Lord wrote to Cole on June 25, 1831: ÖL. L. Noble, The Life and Works of Thomas Cole, edited by E. S. Veseli, Cambridge (Mass.), 1964, p. xix. 10 K.

"I have not made choice of a scene for the picture, but must leave it to your better choice. "The picture as I informed you is intended for one of my parlour mande pieces - which is I think 5% to 6 feet, you are aquained [sic] with the proportions best suited to that situa- tion. Enclosed you have authority to draw on Mr. Wiggin London for forty Pounds sterling should you find it necessary to do so." 11 In a list of paintings executed in Europe, Cole notes "an Italian Composition of Tower Bridge - R. L. Lord, New York." 12 This is the painting, recently rediscovered by Professor Howard S. Merritt, that is illustrated in Figure 3. The com- position was the subject of a small drawing by Cole (Fig. 4); this is presumably a "record draw- ing" done after the painting rather than a pre- paratory sketch for it. Cole's painting was done in a considerable hurry, as he was trying to finish several commis- sions in Florence before continuing his travels. He wrote Dunlap about the summer of 1832: "Returned to Florence, I painted more pictures in three months than I have ever done in twice the time before or since .... In that three months I painted the Aqueduct picture, the view of Cascatelles of Tivoli, Mr. Lord's pic- ture of Italian Scenery, four small pictures for Mr. Tappan, a small view near Tivoli, and several others." 13 11 From a photostat at the New York Historical Society of the Cole papers, New York State Library, Albany, New York. 12 This is in the Cole Papers at Albany.

(Frick Art Reference Library photograph) The "Italian Scenery" is dark and cluttered; its quality is inferior to much of Cole's work, even of this rushed period. In The Vesper Hymn : An Italian Twilight (Toledo Museum of Art), Cole uses many of the same devices but with far greater success. Here, a tower, shrine, and figures are subordinated to a landscape with foliage, a distant vista, and unifying light. A similar tower, placed high in the composition, is used most suc- cessfully in Cole's pair of masterpieces of 1838, Past and Present, at Amherst College. Rufus Lord gave Cole a second commission, which Cole recorded as follows: "For R. L. Lord N. York a picture as companion to the one he now possesses - size 5 ft. by 3 ft., 4 in. subject American scenery." 14 The result was The View of the Notch of the White Mountains in the National Gallery (Fig. 1). This was the title that the artist gave Lord when he billed him for the picture in the amount of $500 in March 1840.15 An immediate success, it was exhibited at the National Academy of Design in 1840 (no. 49) and was highly praised. The reviewer for The KnicĶerbocĶer said: "This is truly an American picture. The boldness of the scenery itself, the autumnal tints which are spread over the forest, and the wild appearance of the heavens, gives it a character and stamp that we never see in foreign schools; and we pronounce the artist a master, without rival among his own countrymen." 16 Cole had visited the White Mountains in New Hampshire in the fall of 1828 in the company of his friend Henry Cheever Pratt (1803-1880), a minor landscape painter from Boston. On Octo- ber 6 they walked through Crawford Notch. Cole records their journey: 14 Cole Papers, New York State Library, Albany, as quoted to me by Howard S.

"The morning opened in a threatening man- ner, but we left Crawford's prepared for the worst. We had before us that wild mountain- pass called the Notch. . . . The distance is twelve miles, and not a house . . . but with our luggage strapped on our backs we set for- ward and footed it through. The wind blew violently down the pass as we approached, and the gray, heavy clouds were rushing round the overhanging crags, as if contending which should sit upon the mountain throne. . . . "We now entered the Notch, and felt awe- struck as we passed between the bare and rifted mountains. . . . The sight of the Willey House, with its litde patch of green in the gloomy desolation, very naturally recalled to mind the horrors of the night when the whole family perished beneath an avalanche of rocks and earth." 17 Cole had already painted a view of the White Mountains in 1827 (The Wadsworth Atheneum, Hartford; Fig. 5). This was commissioned by Daniel Wadsworth, of Hartford, later founder of the Wadsworth Atheneum. It is a view of Mt. Washington from the north, from a spot a few miles above where the road turns down into the Notch. The composition is unusual for Cole, especially at this early date. The panoramic view of a mountain peak offers few of the sublime and picturesque contrasts through which Cole liked to express himself. Such a subject - in which everything is subordinate to a great natural won- der - was painted best by Bierstadt and Church of the next generation. This view was probably demanded by his patron, Wadsworth, who wrote him asking for specific information, "Is the scene of the Mountain from near Crawfords house? - or where - &amp; how far west of the Notch? - as I shall wish when asked to say distinctly." 18 17 Noble, op. cit. in note 9 above, p. 66. 18 E.

Cole returned to the White Mountains in the early summer of 1839.19 He does not record his emotions on seeing Crawford Notch again, but he must have fondly recalled his earlier reaction to this scene. This time he made a careful draw- ing (Fig. 6), depicting the topography, foliage, and buildings as he saw them, and adding color notes. It seems likely that he was already plan- ning the National Gallery painting, having re- ceived the commission from Rufus Lord. The sketch is an objective recording of the Notch as approached from the north, with Mt. Webster looming over the scene, the shoulders of Mt. Jackson to the left (including the "Elephant's Head"), and Mt. Willard to the right. One sees the "Notch House" of Ethan Crawford, a barn to the left of the Notch, and a large cleared field in the foreground. The scene does not look much different now, with the exception of today's ubiquitous highway and telephone lines (Fig. 7). The National Gallery painting of the Notch makes it clear that Cole was the same man - the pessimist, the moralizer - whether he was paint- ing an "ideal" or a "real" landscape. Cole was never satisfied to paint topography; he demanded a subject. In his Lecture on American Scenery in 1841 he eloquently defended American scenery against the charge that it was defective for "want of associations such as arise amid the scenes of the old world." He maintained that American scenes can have historical and legendary associa- tions: "The great struggle for freedom has sancti- 19 Noble, op. cit. in note 9 above, p. 204. 141</page><page sequence="11">fied many a spot, and many a mountain stream and rock has its legend . . . He adds trium- phantly that American associations are not so much of the past as of the present and future: "Where the wolf roams, the plough shall glisten; on the gray crag shall rise temple and tower; mighty deeds shall be done in the yet pathless wilderness; and poets yet unborn shall sanctify the soil." 20 Crawford Notch was ideally suited to Cole's art, and it is only surprising that he did not paint it sooner. It was a famous American sight, dis- cussed by N. P. Willis in American Scenery glorified by tragic legend, suggestive of the great and the mysterious. Cole found it at once "deso- late and savage, . . . grand and picturesque." He thought this an area that "the elements . . . seem to have chosen . . . for a battleground," one where "the hoar mountains . . . appear wrinkled by recent convulsions." It was "impres- sive and sublime," yet "there was an awfulness in the deep solitude, pent up within the great precipices, that was painful."22 All this is in perfect accord with Cole's view of nature as an anthropomorphic battleground of elements, as a place where the hand of God is often felt. Better than any American of his time, Cole expressed in painting the "romantic agony" of Wordsworth. As a religious man he felt the good- ness of nature; at the same time, he feared its wildness and irrationality. In the Notch, as in his allegorical pictures such as Past and Present, or Voyage of Life, Cole's theme is the romantic one: the power of nature and the insignificance of man; the eternity of nature and the frail tenure of man. In the Notch, the players are natural forms; the trees and mountains, the sunshine and the storm suffer or exult in human ways. Thus, in the painting (Fig. i), the artist has carefully adjusted the scene to suit his purpose. Mt. Web- ster has gained in volume and character, its peak arching through the edge of a thunderstorm. The two cliffs that form the notch have been height- ened, the valley between them made narrow and precipitous. Out of the chasm comes rising steam, a portent warning the traveler. One hillside is dark with shadow, the other bathed in sunlight. The buildings have been separated, their size diminished. A rider is added to give scale and imminence to the natural drama. The bare trees on the right (Fig. 8) are stricken and seem to cry out in a human way. The heroic stump to the left (Fig. 9) is painted richly and feverishly with many colors, as Cole, the puritan, the antisensualist, revels in the luxuriant viscosity of his medium. It recalls Wil- liam Gilpin, who wrote, "these splendid rem- nants of decaying grandeur speak to the imagina- tion in a style of eloquence which the stripling cannot reach; they record the history of some storm, some blast of lightning, or other great event, which transfers its grand ideas to the land- scape and in the representation of elevated sub- jects, assists the sublime." 23 Thomas Cole has been confused with the heroic, optimistic generation of Bingham and Church, with transcendentalism and the Thoreau who said that "To him who contemplates a trait of natural beauty no harm nor disappointment can come." 24 But Thoreau dared to go out to Waiden Pond only in 1845, the year that Cole took on the young Frederic Church as a pupil, only three years before his death. Cole's own at- titudes are best reflected in the literature of a generation before. William Cullen Bryant wrote the first great American poem, Thanatopsis, in 181 1, and it is to this, with its combination of faith and pessimism, its abiding uncertainty, that one should look for literary parallels to Cole's work. Perry Miller wrote that "In his mingling of anxieties and exultations, James Fenimore Cooper is indeed the central interpreter of his period; even while glorifying the forest-born virtue of America, he had also portrayed the brutal Skin- ners in The Spy and the settlers in The Pioneers 20 Cole, op. cit. in note 6 above. 21 N.

When Cole was painting, most of the American wilderness was wild and un- settled, yet with his friends Bryant and Cooper he was highly conscious of the ephemeral quality of the wilderness itself. He recognized the enemy: man and society. With poignant accuracy he warned of the coming tragedy in his poem, The Lament of the Forest: "And thus came rushing on This human hurricane, boundless as swift. Our sanctuary, this secluded spot, Which the stern rocks have guarded until now, Our enemy has marked." 26 The Notch of the White Mountains illustrates another side to Thomas Cole's genius, for he sketched on the original stretcher a preliminary design in chalk for the statehouse at Columbus, Ohio (Fig. 10). In January 1838, a board of com- missioners appointed by the General Assembly of Ohio "advertised for plans" for a new capito!, "offering premiums." 27 They received between fifty and sixty sets of plans. In October 1838, they met again, and awarded three premiums. The winners were Martin E. Thompson of the firm of Town, Thompson, and Davis of New York; Henry Walter of Cincinnati; and Thomas Cole of Catskill. The first two were prominent architects. The commissioners decided to com- bine "The best ideas of the three prize designs in a modified plan which . . . was adopted." 25 P. Miller, Nature's Nation, Cambridge (Mass.), 1967, p. 205. 28 Miller, ibid., p. 204. 27 T. E. O'Donnell, "The Greek Revival Capitol at Columbus, Ohio," The Architectural Forum, vol. xlii, January 1925, pp. 5-8. 144</page><page sequence="14">The building was not completed for twenty-two years, owing to problems of construction, labor, and economics. In the interim, a number of other architects were called in to give advice or super- vision, and the dome originally planned was lost in the process. Still, something of the massing suggested in Cole's drawing survives in the build- ing as it was finally executed (Fig. n). Cole's interest in architecture was also apparent in sev- eral paintings of this period, particularly in the massive architectural fantasies he created in the last three paintings of The Course of Empire , 1836; in the domed palace in the sky of The Voyage of Life , Youth , 1840; and in the com- pilation of architectural styles in The Architect's Dream , 1840. Cole's Notch of the White Mountains is a rare work of the artist's last decade where he has combined his realistic and his idealizing styles; the result is a highly successful picture of Ameri- can scenery and American thought. Before the end of his life, Cole made several paintings that lead directly to American luminism, the painting of light and water that reached its peak in the 1860's; 28 perhaps the best example is his Ameri- can La'e Scene of 1844 (Fig. 12). Cole was admired in his own day chiefly for "the authenticity'' of his realistic landscapes. The only critic who recognized Cole for what he was, a painter of the ideal who was an end as well as a beginning, was James Jackson Jar ves who cor- rectly noted, "Cole has left no followers to carry forward the beautiful significance and lofty sug- gestions with which he aimed to endow landscape art . . . ." 29 Associate Curator , Garvan and Related Collections of American Art Yale University 28 See J.
