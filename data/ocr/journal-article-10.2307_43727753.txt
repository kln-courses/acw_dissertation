<plain_text><page sequence="1">JOHN day (ed.), Prophecy and Prophets in Ancient Israel: Proceedings of the Oxford Old Testament Seminar (Library of Hebrew Bible/Old Testament Studies 531; London/New York: Clark, 2010). Pp. xviii + 462. $180. This collection consists of twenty-three previously unpublished essays that were deliv- ered to the Oxford Old Testament Seminar between January 2006 and October 2008 and were subsequently revised and expanded. All the essays represent serious, careful studies that repay close reading. The volume as a whole marks a real contribution to the study of prophecy and the prophets in ancient Israel, and Day is to be commended and thanked. The collection joins other successful published proceedings of the Oxford seminar that he has also edited, including King and Messiah in Israel and the Ancient Near East (JSOTSup 270; Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, 1998); In Search ofPre-exilic Israel (JSOTSup 406; London/New York: Clark, 2004); and Temple and Worship in Biblical Israel (Library of Hebrew Bible/Old Testament Studies 422; London/New York: Clark, 2005). The essays are grouped logically under four headings. Part 1 , "The Ancient Near East- ern Context of Prophecy," contains three essays: Martti Nissinen, "Comparing Prophetic Sources: Principles and a Test Case"; Stuart Weeks, "Predictive and Prophetic Literature: Can Neferti Help Us Read the Bible?"; and Jonathan Stökl, "Female Prophets in the Ancient Near East." Part 2, "Specific Themes," offers two essays: H. G. M. Williamson, "Prophet- esses in the Hebrew Bible"; and David J. Reimer, "Interpersonal Forgiveness and the Hebrew Prophets." Part 3, "Sociological, Anthropological, and Psychological Perspectives," features three essays: Walter J. Houston, "Exit the Oppressed Peasant? Rethinking the Back- ground of Social Criticism in the Prophets"; Lester L. Grabbe, "Shaman, Preacher, or Spirit Medium? The Israelite Prophet in the Light of Anthropological Models"; and Paul M. Joyce, "The Prophets and Psychological Interpretation." Part 4, "Prophecy and the Prophets in Specific Biblical Books," is the largest section of the collection, with fifteen essays: Ernest Nicholson, "Deuteronomy 18.9-22, the Prophets and Scripture"; David T. Lamb, "'A Prophet instead of You' (1 Kings 19.16): Elijah, Elisha and Prophetic Succession"; John Barton, "The Theology of Amos"; John Day, "Hosea and the Baal Cult"; John J. Collins, "The Sign of Immanuel"; Reinhard G. Kratz, "Rewriting Isaiah: The Case of Isaiah 28- 31"; Hywel Clifford, "Deutero-Isaiah and Monotheism"; Philip S. Johnston, "'Now You See Me, Now You Don't! ' Jeremiah and God"; Jill Middlemas, "Exclusively Yahweh: Ani- conism and Anthropomorphism in Ezekiel"; Tchavdar S. Hadjiev, "Zephaniah and the 'Book of the Twelve' Hypothesis"; Kevin J. Cathcart, "'Law Is Paralysed' (Habakkuk 1.4): Habakkuk's Dialogue with God and the Language of Legal Disputation"; Elie Assis, "Struc- ture and Meaning in the Book of Malachi"; Susan Gillingham, "New Wine and Old Wine- skins: Three Approaches to Prophecy and Psalmody"; Gary N. Knoppers, "Democratizing Revelation? Prophets, Seers and Visionaries in Chronicles"; and Christopher Rowland,</page><page sequence="2">644 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY | 73,2011 "Prophecy and the New Testament." The volume concludes with an index of textual refer- ences and an index of authors. The volume is certainly impressive in its multipronged coverage of Israelite prophecy. Initial essays bring the reader up to speed on how study of the prophets' Near Eastern counterparts is expanding our understandings and revealing ways in which biblical prophecy took a course of its own. Grabbe's anthropological models, drawing on comparative material such as Hopi prophecy, illuminate some key dimensions of Israelite prophecy that are sparsely attested in the Old Babylonian and Neo- Assyrian corpora. The biblical prophetic tradition is not alone in its developed concern with ethics/morality or in its having undergone extensive literary development. The volume has no specific section on prophecy and theology, but theological rumi- nations are far from absent. Theological reflection is apparent in Reimer 's conclusion that "with the prophets . . . there is no avoiding God" (p. 94); in Barton's willingness to treat Amos's "canonical" witness to "the paradoxical character of God's ways of acting" (p. 199); in Johnston's observations on Jeremiah's "potent and troubling portrayal of God" (p. 307); and in Gillingham's careful tracing of the development of the Psalter's prophetic dimension, a progression that eventuated in God becoming "an immanent presence through the psalms" (p. 387). The contribution in the volume with perhaps the greatest potential for impacting the field is Houston's essay, "Exit the Oppressed Peasant?" Based on the important archaeo- logical findings of Avraham Faust ( Israelite Society in the Period of the Monarchy : An Archaeological Examination [in Hebrew; Jerusalem: Yad Izhak Ben-Zvi, 2005]), Houston lays out a serious challenge to current paradigms, especially the emphasis on the prophets as champions of Israel's rural peasantry. He argues that social stratification and economic injustices were urban phenomena in ninth- and eighth-century Israel and Judah, not attested in the rural sphere. Israelite prophets encountered the oppression of the poor in the cities, not in the villages. Houston is certainly to be applauded for his humble willingness to alter his earlier published conclusions. He and Faust are doubtless right that injustices never collapsed the traditional life of the countryside. Yet I believe that Houston goes too far with his arguments. At the start he presses too hard the evidence of Deut 15:7, which locates the poor "in one of your gates" (p. 102). Deuteronomy uses the term "gate" not to signal a fortified urban context, as Houston insists, but as a rubric for the local sphere, a sphere differentiated from that of the projected central sanctuary (see, e.g., Deut 5:14; 24:14). The lexeme "gate" in this book is sometimes also a rubric for the kin group (e.g., Deut 23:16; cf. Ruth 3:11 and the sense of the Akkadian term bãbtu[m]) or for the entire quarters for public functions near a settlement's entrance (e.g., Deut 17:8). Bethlehem famously had a "gate" during the village era (Ruth 4: 1, 10; 2 Sam 23: 15), well before its fortification by the state (cf. 2 Chr 1 1 :6). By the same token, there is no archaeological warrant forjudging Micah to be fabri- cating complaints against oppressions in the Shephelah (see Mie 2:9; 3:3). Against Houston, Micah did not have to travel to Jerusalem to encounter exploitation. Socio-economic strat- ification is firmly attested in the Shephelah, seen in all the excavated Iron Age II sites of that region. We should probably assume that Micah 's home settlement, Moresheth Gath, was an urbanized site, since so far archaeologists have found no villages and farmsteads in the Shephelah. I am sure that Faust's forthcoming book, The Archaeology of Israelite Society</page><page sequence="3">COLLECTED ESSAYS 645 in the Iron Age II, to be published by Eisenbrauns, will shed much new light on these and related questions.
