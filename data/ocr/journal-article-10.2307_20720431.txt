<plain_text><page sequence="1">David Cregan Coming Out: McGuinness's Dramaturgy and Queer Resistance The most consistent trope in Frank McGuinness's playwriting is the placement of a gay or lesbian character in the central role as the dramatic protagonist. Whether reliving the events of World War One in Observe the Sons of Ulster Marching Towards the Somme or imaginatively envisioning William Shakespeare escaping to the shores of Ireland after a poor performance in Mutabilitie, McGuinness, more often than not, tells his story through the experience and vision of life as a homosexual. What makes this reliable placement of the queer character at the centre of a piece of theatre even more interesting is the fact that McGuinness also consistently relies on the events of the past to create his very contemporary plays. In so doing, McGuinness not only situates homosexuality within seemingly incongruous historical circumstances, he reconfigures or, as I will argue throughout this essay, queers cultural assumptions of the past which continue to shape present realities. McGuinness's plays represent a unique discursive practice within the literary dramatic tradition of modern Ireland: a practice which reconfigures the historical memory central to the formation of post Renaissance identity, while simultaneously giving voice to the otherwise silent or silenced queer voices of Irish identity. McGuinness queers the past in order to create a space in contemporary Ireland to allow for alternative versions of Irish citizenship to emerge. Through the conventions of stage and dramatic fiction, McGuinness acts as historian or archaeologist, illuminating a marginalized yet ever-present reality of Irish identity. His plays not only articulate the experience of gay and lesbian subjectivities over a vast expanse of time and space through narrative, they also confront the preferred naturalism of the Irish dramatic tradition through a dramaturgy which prefers fragmentation over continuity. McGuinness could hardly be classified as a 'gay playwright', as the genre has come to be determined and developed. His plays are not confrontational protests about gay rights, or even theatrical glimpses of the homosexual world of either underground experience or erotic fetish. Instead his work is contextualized within the larger experience of human identity and has an overall tone of reconciliation rather than conflict. McGuinness makes inclusivity the necessary component of 46</page><page sequence="2">COMING OUT: McGUINNESS'S DRAMATURGY AND QUEER RESISTANCE drama throughout his plays as he theatrically rethinks history in order to animate that which has been ignored or excluded. Because of this unique approach to dramaturgy, I would suggest that McGuinness's body of dramatic work functions as an innovative artistic epistemology, one that strives to dislodge entrenched ideologies of the past which support a variety of social, cultural and historical prejudices. This epistemology is most certainly queer, as it broadens the scope of diversity through a dramatic reinterpretation of historical perspective as articulated by the gay subject. How then might it be asserted that McGuinness's work does not fall within the parameters of the objectives of gay drama, while simultaneously claiming his work as a queer epistemology? While he shares the common goal of articulating the experience of the homosexual subject, his work is more complex in that he does not situate that subject outside of heteronormative experience or history, but rather as intricate to a full understanding of the way in which human experience and knowledge have developed. More often than not, the conflict of the homosexual character is internal rather than simply external, disrupting a victim-like mentality that can oftentimes be representative of the narrative of marginalized identity. In this sense, McGuinness 'naturalizes' gay identity, often telling his story from the perspective of the protagonist, but never sympathizing in any overtly political way with a particular perspective, and thus repeatedly disrupting the common binaries which keep people and ideas apart. His is a queer theatrical epistemology in that it offers a dramatic vision that questions all reductive notions of identity, gay or straight. It is essential then to clarify the meaning of the term queer in order to suggest it as a paradigmatic methodology by which McGuinness disrupts both opinion and fact. In 'Queer Theory: Lesbian and Gay Sexualities', Teresa de Lauretis first outlined how queer theory suggests 'a double emphasis - on the conceptual and speculative work involved in discourse production, and on the necessary critical work of deconstructing our own [gay and lesbian] discourses and their constructed silences'.1 This emphasis on the ways in which language has created and regulated all identity would, in itself, be an interesting approach to shaping dramatic fictionalizations of the past, but queer theory's commitment to deconstructing homosexual as well as heterosexual constructions of identity makes it an ideal methodology for illuminating McGuinness's dramatic and cultural career. De Lauretis maintains that like gay and lesbian theories, queer theories are 'forms of resistance to cultural homogenization, counteracting dominant discourses with other constructions of the subject in culture'.2 Yet, in order to maintain a queer methodology, homosexual identities as determined by cultural norms must themselves be questioned, and 47</page><page sequence="3">IRISH UNIVERSITY REVIEW even undermined, in order to fulfill the mandate of queer theory to destabilize all normative homogenous discursive structures. In other words, all certainty is abandoned and no sides are taken as absolute in identity politics in order to make reductive assumptions transparent. McGuinness destabilizes the conviction that our world is entirely knowable by refusing prescription in character building, and denying the historical certainty of collective memory, by creating queer protagonists and unstable versions of the past. Because much of his narrative content and subject deals with Ireland, his drama is a uniquely queer Irish epistemology. In the following pages I will demonstrate how McGuinness queers the collective historical memory of Ireland through character, setting, and narrative. Additionally I will assert that in so doing he offers a contemporary alternative to the entrenched ideologies of the past that have dominated and policed all identities. Consequently, McGuinness inverts conventional conflicts through dramatic action and narrative content in order to suggest a Utopian paradigm for the future. These grandiose notions of the power of his theatre are substantiated in the reality that McGuinness has been able to cross cultural boundaries through his representations in order to make disparate constituents feel equally represented. Observe the Sons of Ulster Marching Towards the Somme is arguably McGuinness's queerest play. It reconfigures history, knowledge, experience, sexuality, and national identity in radical ways. Within the Irish theatrical tradition this play represents the first time in which a story is told entirely from the position of the queer subject. In Tart One: Remembrance', the audience is introduced to the character Elder Pyper as he wakes. He begins the play in isolation: Pyper Again. As always, again. Why does this persist? What more have we to tell each other? I remember nothing today. Absolutely nothing.3 Throughout Part One Pyper complains, ranting that the memories of the past are a burden which have locked him into a lifetime of circular questions, rather than answers. He continues: ... There is nothing to tell you. Those willing to talk to you of that day, to remember for your sake, to forgive you, they invent as freely as they wish. I am not one of them. I will not talk, I will not listen to you. Invention gives that slaughter shape.... (p.97) The title of the play refers to an historical event that has shaped the consciousness of Northern Irish identity for almost one hundred years; 48</page><page sequence="4">COMING OUT: McGUINNESS'S DRAMATURGY AND QUEER RESISTANCE an event of national pride which elicits in the Protestant population a commitment to the British Crown at a time when Republicans were fighting for Irish independence. However, the influence of this well chronicled battle continues to support the ideology in the North which promotes and encourages disunity, as it serves as a repository for cultural difference and Unionist political ideology. McGuinness's version of this event, which is both historical reality and cultural mythology, is transparently sceptical and emotionally hostile. Elder Pyper is plagued with discontent over a moment that others have taken great pride in. He accuses those who tell this story of inventing in order to please the listener. McGuinness uses the Battle of the Somme and its residual influence to push back against the entrenchment of sectarian division by pointing out the inherent instability of memory. He queers the solidity of both memory and history from the beginning of this play by putting pressure on the discursive practices which have justified sectarian division through the creation of a mythology which uses the past to defend the present. Throughout Part One Pyper vehemently rages against the violence of war. Gradually the rest of the characters within this play begin to take form, appearing behind him, walking from the past into the present. As though dreaming backwards, history materializes in the men whose story gets told as the play unravels. The stage directions read: Silence. As the light increases, Pyper sees the ghosts appear, Craig, Roulston, and Crawford (p.99). McGuinness creates a dramatic world in which memory draws the past into the future. This convention also makes it transparently clear that this memory is coming through Pyper, not only making it subjective, but further queering the piece. For as the play unfolds we discover that Pyper is in fact gay, and thus the entire standpoint of the play is articulated through the perspective of the queer character. McGuinness ignores the traditional discursive practices which codify and classify what it means to be a homosexual in contemporary times. Pyper is brave, and dangerous, antagonistic and powerful amongst his peers. He is the aggressor, and certainly does not suffer from a persecution complex. In Tart Two: Initiation', Pyper meets the fellow soldier who is to become his lover: Pyper Like a piece of apple? Craig I've work to do. Pyper I can't tempt you? Craig Get on with your business and stop this foolishness, (p.104) McGuinness plays with the seminal sexual-temptation imagery of Adam and Eve as Pyper sets out to seduce Craig. Pyper is 'coming out' to 49</page><page sequence="5">IRISH UNIVERSITY REVIEW Craig through metaphor and allusion, making it possible for Craig himself to acknowledge his own sexual desire. What is interesting about the relationship between Craig and Pyper is not that they are gay, but that in comparison to the other characters they represent freedom and liberation. Wfhile the others are bound by the obligations of traditional identities determined by their place in conservative sectarian Northern Ireland, the gay characters find freedom and redemption. They are, in fact, the only characters not tortured by their obligation to State or Faith. Pyper's queer language with Craig is initially coded, but gives way to a more articulate statement of desire. Pyper continues: Pyper Have you ever looked at an apple? Craig Yes. Pyper What did you see? Craig An apple. Pyper I don't. I see through it. Craig The skin, you mean? Pyper The flesh, the flesh, the flesh. Craig What about it? Pyper Beautiful. Hard. White, (p.105) The representation of homosexual desire in Observe the Sons may be read on the surface level as McGuinness's attempt to retrieve the possibility of a gay identity in the context of World War One, but queer theory presses for an analysis of discourse that goes beyond what is simply said towards what that discourse is actually doing. In his book, The Arena of Masculinity, Brian Pronger suggests an interpretation of homosexuality that moves beyond the description of gay as a sexual position and towards the notion of queer as a political position. He claims: Homosexuality undermines, in a positive way, the most important myth of our culture ... Homosexuality is a violation of masculinity, a denigration of the mythic power of men, an ironic subversion that significant numbers of men pursue with great enthusiasm. Because it gnaws at masculinity, it weakens the gender order. But because masculinity is the heart of homoerotic desire, homosexuality is a paradox in the myth of gender.4 If homosexuality is interpreted as undermining the mythology of masculinity, it can be asserted that to undermine masculinity is to undermine the metanarrative that supports all forms of cultured identity. If this is true then an analysis of McGuinness's drama would suggest 50</page><page sequence="6">COMING OUT: McGUINNESS'S DRAMATURGY AND QUEER RESISTANCE that the representation of homosexuality is a dramaturgical device which seeks to disrupt the concept of reality as constructed by Western patriarchal authority. By rejecting reductive stereotyping of the signified queer, by refusing to represent Pyper as weak or as a 'sissy', McGuinness fashions a theatrical identity which is subversive and antagonistic towards the other 'normal' characters in the play, representations of the more recognizable Northern Irish identity politics. The queer methodology of approaching discourse from the perspective of what it does rather than what it says illuminates the value of a theoretical analysis of text, as opposed to the more frequent and easily accessible practices of close reading. This analytical standpoint does not however neutralize the political impact of the representation of gay bodies on stage. By centralizing the gay character, McGuinness contributes to the overall queer project of coming out. But what, in fact, is coming out? In his book, Saint=Foucault, David Halperin describes busting out of the proverbial closet thus: If to come out is to release oneself from a state of unfreedom, that is not because coming out constitutes an escape from the reach of power to a place outside of power: rather, coming out puts into play a different set of power relations and alters the dynamics of personal and political struggle. Coming out is an act of freedom, then, not in the sense of liberation but in the sense of resistance.5 The theoretical philosophies of queer theory make a perfect tool for dramatic and performance analysis in that they are both ideas and practices. The queer ideas of freedom from, and resistance to, the constructs of power regimes are clearly discernible in Observe the Sons as McGuinness artistically interrupts the certainty of historical memory, which continually inhibits growth and reconciliation in contemporary Irish politics. What is perhaps most interesting about McGuinness's drama is that it goes beyond the complexity of dramaturgical theory into the realm of practice, for theatre is never complete as text. As a result of the conflation of practices which entail theatre - design, acting, aesthetic concept, etc. - theatre can also, by its very nature, be analyzed not simply by what it says, but by what it does. The combination of theory and practice is essential for the proper application of queer theory if 'resistance' is to move from ideology into practical politics. Pyper's articulation of a queer subjectivity is not simply a form of liberation, as the audience's encounter with his actual queer presence on stage, through the actor, moves the play into the territory of resistance. But what is McGuinness interested in resisting in his work? 51</page><page sequence="7">IRISH UNIVERSITY REVIEW In both Observe the Sons and Dolly West's Kitchen McGuinness uses the context of military life and war to explore the way in which the past influences the future. While Observe the Sons explores the cultural mythology that surrounds the 36th Division of the British Army which participated in the Battle of the Somme in France during World War One, Dolly West's Kitchen critiques the political policy of neutrality in the Republic of Ireland during the Second World War. In both of these plays men wearing military costumes go beyond the innuendo of homosexuality and actually kiss on stage. In 'Part Three: Pairing' of Observe the Sons McGuinness divides all of the characters into pairs as the men take a final leave before heading to the continent and into the fateful Battle of the Somme. While all the men are at home in Ulster, Craig and Pyper are found on Boa Island in the middle of Lough Erne in County Fermanagh. In this place of isolation McGuinness makes his boldest attempt to transcend the identity politics which haunt this play and Northern Irish culture. Boa Island is home to two early Christian stone statues in anthropomorphic form. Craig asks Pyper what these ancient forms mean: Craig They don't look like men or women. Pyper Depends on the man or woman. Craig They could be either. Pyper They could be both, (p.149) The dialogue is referring to gender identity, and yet within the greater political context of the play this would appear to be McGuinness's attempt to transcend the limitations of restrictive identity politics. The uncertainty of what the statues are is a metaphor for the ambiguity in the relationship between Pyper and Craig. Eventually the metaphors give way to an intense moment of passion where the two men kiss. The kiss signifies a major shift in the way the dialogue is written in Part Three. While each of the Pairings had remained as self-contained exchanges of dialogue between the two individual men represented at any given time, scenically partitioned within separate pools of light in which the conversations unfold, the form of the writing shifts to a more symphonic blending of the four separate groups. The dialogue dissolves difference as the men collectively enter the definitive moment in which all of their lives, with the exception of Pyper, are given for Crown and for Country. The kiss gives way to a world in which the audience listens to all the voices of Northern Ireland blending to create one voice. The kiss in Dolly West's Kitchen also utilizes the military costume. By having the homosexual men in both plays appear in uniform there is a visual semiotic at play which connects the character with the idea of 52</page><page sequence="8">COMING OUT: McGUINNESS'S DRAMATURGY AND QUEER RESISTANCE nation. Dolly West's Kitchen is a portrait of the impact of World War Two on the lives of the West family of Donegal. Justin is the only boy of the family and is an officer in the Irish Army. He is also a closeted gay man. During the Second World War there were U.S. military bases located in Northern Ireland, since the United States was a primary ally of the British in the war on the continent. McGuinness uses this historical reality to introduce the character of Marco Delavicario. Marco is an Italian-American soldier who has joined the army with his cousin Jamie, and the play finds them passing through Ireland on their way to fight in the war. Marco introduces himself to the West family: Marco I am Marco Delavicario. This is my Irish-American cousin, Jamie O'Brien. We signed up together. Jamie brought the clothes he was standing in and a change of underwear. I brought one taffeta dress and a change of high heels. Who knows what might happen in the heat of battle?6 Marco is as flamboyant as Justin is repressed. McGuinness employs the foreign character of Marco to help bring the Irish character out of the closet, as well as to situate gay identity within an historical time period in Ireland which was notoriously conservative. Justin enters and meets Marco for the first time: Justin You've crossed the border. Marco Hasn't everyone? Justin I beg your pardon. Marco Just being chatty. Justin I never am. Marco You can use your tongue for other matters. Justin Than what? Marco Chatting. Justin Yankee wit. Marco Yankee wisdom. From this exchange to the end of the scene, Justin does not take his eyes off Marco, (p.206) Justin is left speechless by Marco's campy openness, but he is also initially repelled by his overt sexuality. Justin is angry and, as it becomes clear later in the play, his anger is based on the repression of his homosexual desire. Before discussing the kiss in Dolly West's Kitchen it is interesting to examine the way in which McGuinness's queer dramaturgy shapes the politics of the play. Once again, it is useful to return to the notion that coming out of the closet is an act of resistance rather than liberation. 53</page><page sequence="9">IRISH UNIVERSITY REVIEW While liberation would entail the important aspect of the dramatic representation of gay and lesbian lives at a historical time period when their voices would be silent and their presence invisible, resistance makes these representations relevant in contemporary times. Justin's process of coming out could thus be interpreted as a protest against restrictive ideas of national identity in contemporary Ireland. His fear of Marco is his anxiety of being drawn out of the closet, and yet, it is the closet that is smothering him and making his life miserable. Marco's presence evokes fear of change in Justin. Fear of being accused of being homosexual is a general social anxiety as well as a restrictive masculine cultural phenomenon. In her book, Epistemology of the Closet, Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick describes this anxiety as 'homosexual panic'.7 A description of Sedgwick's theory of homosexual panic must be preceded by her concept of 'homosocial desire'.8 'Homosocial' is a word occasionally used in history and the social sciences, where it describes social bonds between persons of the same sex; it is a neologism, obviously formed by an analogy with 'homosexual', and just as obviously meant to be distinguished from 'homosexual'. In fact it applies to such activities as 'male bonding', which may, as in our society, be characterized by intense homophobia, fear and hatred of homosexuality.9 Sedgwick creates an ideological and practical link between the longing for male bonding and male sexual desire. This linkage pinpoints a pressure point within the ideas of what it means to be a man and illuminates an anxiety below the iconic masculine practices that shape men's bodies and regulate men's subjectivity. In Sedgwick's work, anxiety, or fear of homosocial desire, is identified as a root cause of alienation and separation in the parameters of the masculinity that men map out for themselves. This leads to a strict policing in what Sedgwick describes in the project of shaping acceptable gender identity as homosexual panic: If such compulsory male relationships as male friendship, mentorship, admiring identification, bureaucratic subordination, and heterosexual rivalry all involve forms of investment that force men into the arbitrarily mapped, self contradictory, and anathema riddled quicksands of the middle distance of male homosocial desire, then it appears that men enter into adult masculine entitlement only through acceding to the permanent threat that the small space they have cleared for themselves on this terrain may always, just as arbitrarily and with just as much justification, be foreclosed.10 54</page><page sequence="10">COMING OUT: McGUINNESS'S DRAMATURGY AND QUEER RESISTANCE In fictionalizing military life, McGuinness locates his male characters in the institutional environment of the military, pointing towards the great cultural apparatuses that construct and regulate identity. Thus, Justin's move out of the closet can be interpreted as a resistance to those forces which compelled him into a personal misery; a desolation based on false ideas of what he is supposed to be, as mandated by social constructionism, in opposition to who he really is. How then is the 'epistemology of the closet' applicable to the notion of undermining the idea of neutrality in the Republic of Ireland? Just as Justin's sexual identity is repressed and moderated by ideas of what it means to be Irish, so is the perpetually problematic relationship of Ireland to England. What this play suggests is that Irish neutrality is a facade by which anti-British sentiment has been concealed by a type of false altruism. As Justin wears the uniform of the military, he hides below his social role his real truth for fear that it will be exposed. In Dolly West's Kitchen, McGuinness resists the false altruism of patriotism to expose the reality that Irish neutrality is based on a deep opposition to allying itself with British politics in any way. In Dolly West's Kitchen McGuinness puts pressure on an Irish historical political reality. During the Second World War, Ireland chose not to support her traditional allies, and remained neutral throughout the war. In Ireland and the Second World War, Geoffrey Roberts describes the latent agenda of Irish neutrality: The Irish Free State's declaration of neutrality in 1939 was undoubtedly the wisest and safest course of action. It protected the Irish people from the perils of war, asserted the country's sovereignty and independence from Britain, and, crucially, maintained the unity of the state at a time of great national danger.11 The phrase 'unity of state' could be interpreted historically as a code for uniformity in the name of patriotism. Such uniformity supports conformity and, ultimately, undermines diversity as a political opinion. Justin's internal suppression, paired with his fierce loyalty to the Republic of Ireland as a military officer, is the suppression of individuality for the greater good of society. It takes a foreigner to shift this false sense of identity. Eventually Marco frees Justin and they begin to fall in love. Once again, McGuinness represents two men wearing military uniforms kissing on stage. This is, in itself, one of the most important moments in identity politics in the Irish theatre. In his book, Still Acting Gay, John Clum illuminates how the gay kiss functions on stage: 55</page><page sequence="11">IRISH UNIVERSITY REVIEW The sight of two men kissing each other on the lips can evoke enormous fear and hostility in some audience members ... Everyone knows that sex between men happens, but the sight of two men kissing is often a transgression of the gender order, taken by many to be 'natural'. A kiss is a sign of affection, of love, not merely of lust. A kiss, to paraphrase the old song, isn't just a kiss. Hence its theatrical power.12 The Irish theatre has often been the site of innovative forms of representation and a place where political connections are woven into drama and performance. In this sense, McGuinness is firmly rooted within the tradition, even dealing with traditional issues of national identity. What makes his dramaturgy unique is the fact that he uses gender and sexuality as a critique of the way in which contemporary identity in Ireland has become stagnant. How can the performance of gender on stage function to effect resistance to cultural normativity? In her book Re-Dressing the Canon, Alisa Solomon describes the fundamental connection between theatre and the project of gender deconstruction. She claims that theatre ... makes visible what culture has made invisible - the accomplishment of gender ... On stage there is a radical synergy between theatre that displays its performance conventions, and the real-life, theatre-like conventions of gender roles. In such works theatre and gender take shape as critical images of one another, as mimetic - though not identical - twins.13 If McGuinness were to simply create queer characters within the context of his writing, it might be argued that he is advocating diversity. Because he so often does so within the context of well-documented historical events and circumstances, he uses the performativity of the theatre to undermine the notion that history is true, or even real. Whether he is using a drag queen to heal the wounds of Bloody Sunday in Carthaginians, or imagining the dark sexuality of the painter Caravaggio in Innocence, McGuinness uses homosexuality to destabilize the otherwise assumed certainty of the past. The gay character is not an authorial indulgence or an autocratic way in which the playwright artificially forces the queer subject upon the past, but is instead a dramaturgical strategy to create space, to free the past from the limitations of history, and to open up that which has become closed due to narrow perspectives and hegemonic histories. Much of queer theory finds its philosophical and activist roots in the philosophy of the French scholar Michel Foucault. In his book The Order of Things he writes: 56</page><page sequence="12">COMING OUT: McGUINNESS'S DRAMATURGY AND QUEER RESISTANCE Obviously, History in this sense is not to be understood as the compilation of factual successions or sequences as they may have occurred; it is the fundamental mode of being of empiricities, upon the basis of which they are affirmed, posited, arranged and distributed in the space of knowledge for the use of such disciplines or sciences as may arise.14 Foucault does not point to history here but to the bias of the historian, implicating the 'agenda' of historians in organizing events to support mainstream cultural ideology. The truth of history is questioned, an interrogation that creates space for a playwright such as McGuinness to be classified as a theatrical historian. In Dolly West's Kitchen Marco asserts that Justin's identity as a gay man may, in fact, be a reason why he should reject Irish neutrality and join the allies in the war on the continent. Justin's mother Rima playfully accuses Marco of wearing lipstick: Marco Madam, I am an American soldier. I am most emphatically not wearing lipstick. A little rouge, yes. No Nazi's going to bitch about my bone structure. Justin Do you know what the Nazis do to men like you? Marco Why the fuck do you think I'm fighting them? Silence (p.212) This is a remarkably powerful moment in this play. Wfliile McGuinness uses the voice of Marco in fun and campy comedy, drawing all of the characters out in their own ways, he exposes the anxiety below homosexual panic in the active resistance of Marco to institutionalized homophobia. He dramatically fictionalizes history by making the fierce and powerful voice of the 'out' character the one with courage, conviction and bravery. This is the moment of transition from liberation to resistance in this play, and it is the genius of McGuinness's queer dramaturgy which packs the greatest punch against restrictive identities. Foucault asserts, 'It seems to me the possibility exists for fiction to function in truth, for a fictional discourse to induce effects of truth, and for bringing it about that a true discourse engenders or "manufactures" something that does not as yet exist, that is "fictions" it'.15 Foucault's idea of fiction and truth gives remarkable insight to the way that theatre functions within cultural discourse. Theatre foregrounds fiction in its performance practices from writing to acting, from stage design to blocking. And yet, theatre is also truth in that it is a lived experience that is actual and not virtual. The audience receives the truth of the moment in a way which is, if only within the confines of performance, free to reconfigure the 'real' world to its own liking. What makes this 57</page><page sequence="13">IRISH UNIVERSITY REVIEW most exciting in its ability to illuminate the queer dramaturgy in McGuinness's work, is that his play can create a world that 'does not yet exist' by opening up the past, evoking a truth which is less rigid than the discourses which bind the very real conflict that exists in Ireland about difference. McGuinness's drama is not queer because the creation of the gay character is unique to his dramatic fiction. It is queer because homosexuality is a strategy by which he seeks to dislodge the cultural discourse that displaces difference in favour of cultural continuity. It makes no apologies for the queer, nor is the queer a victim. He or she is central, vital, energized and often visionary. His drama may at times reference the ravages of homophobia and the institutions which have scourged it, but ultimately it creates an unapologetic affirmation of the liberatory qualities of queer perspectives.
