Introduction From time immemorial, advancement in transportation mobility has been associated with civilization and progress. The historical and geographical patterns of world civilization and development show that both development and civilization have advanced most in areas with fewer problems of linkage and accessibility. Thus, the high level of development in most of Western Europe, North America and parts of Asia compared to the relatively less developed parts of T ropical Africa, South America and the Asian highlands can be explained with reference to their respective levels of connectivity (FARRis and HARDING, 1976). Connectivity enables travel, which in turn helps to overcome the spatial separation of resources which people require to satisfy their various desi res, wants and needs. Thus, in a situation where resources are not equally distributed over a certain area, they must necessarily be moved to the areas of need at the time they are needed, to satisfy what economists would call "place and time utility." Mobility also enhances the spread of ideas, customs and cultures for mutual understanding, tolerance and peace. It also plays a very vita' role in the development and spread of the modern city and urban development in general. World experience has shown that the largest settlements are major transportation centers, and transformation of rural areas to urban centers often begins with transportation development (TAAFFE, MORRILL and GOULD, 1963). Despite its many desirable aspects, however, the development of transportation, like other technological innovations, is associated with a number of undesirable social costs which economists often refer to as the "spill- over effects" of development and which are at times simply dismissed as inconsequential. Among the more unwanted side effects of transportation development are air, water and noise pollution; traffic congestion, delays and fatigue; accidents and wanton destruction and damage to physical structures as well as to human health; and successful crimes such as robbery, burglary, embezzlement and shoplifting, which in recent times have "come to depend on the fast get away car" (MISHAN, 1977). The present study examines the sociological consequences of road traffic accidents, one important aspect of the externality effects of transportation development, in Nigeria through the examination of development trends in road transportation, highway traffic accidents and their major causes. The final section gives policy recommendations concerning this tragic situation in Nigeria. Development trends in road transportation Like most countries, Nigeria has always regarded transportation development as a critical factor in its advance in civilization and progress. Whether in the period before political independence or later, the share of transportation has never been less than one-fifth of the country's overall development allocation. For example, 242 Ekistics 306, May/June 1984</page><page sequence="2">31 .9 percent of the national expenditure in the period 1955 to 1 961 went to transport alone, while in the 1 962-1 968 plan period it was 21.3 percent. This share became 23.66 percent in the 1970-1974 period and 22.3 percent in 1975- 1980. It is significant that because of its greater importance for national development, road transport has usually consumed by far the greatest share of transport development expenditure. Of the total allocation to the transport sector in the 1 955- 1961 period, about 29.1 percent went into road construction. But by the 1962-1968 period this had risen to 52.3 percent, to increase to 68.59 percent in the 1970*1974 period, and reach as high as 72.84 percent in 1975-1988 (table 1 ). In fact, of all states of the Federation, only Lagos and Rivers states spent less than 98 percent of the total transport allocation on roads alone in the 1975-1980 plan ^eriod (table 2). As a consequence of the above, more and more roads have been constructed in Nigeria. Although only about 44,000 kilometers of roads were known to have existed by 1951, the figure had increased to more than 99,000 kilometers by 1972. However, only about 20 percent of the roads were bituminous surfaced, the remaining 80 percent being essentially earth surfaced (table 3). As the number of roads grew in Nigeria, so did the number of the^ users, particularly automobiles. Whereas only about 2,461 vehicles were registered in Nigeria in 1937, the figure rose to about 24,000 by 1964 and reached nearly 147,000 by 1978 (table 4). By and large, the great majority of these vehicles were private cars, including taxis, an indication of many socioeconomic factors, but also of the improved level of "affluence" among the general populace. Traffic accidents: The tragedy of road transport development in Nigeria Like other technological innovations, road transport development, though desirable, has its adverse conse- quences. One of the most crucial of these is road accidents. A recent study (OLUDURO, 1977) indicates that between 1970 and 1975, over 25,000 persons died on Nigeria's highways, while more than 100,000 people sustained injuries from traffic accidents. In 1975 alone, about 463 persons were killed on the highways per month while nearly 1,700 others were injured. The general frend observed by Oluduro is confirmed in table 5. According to the Nigeria Police Force records, fatal road accidents rose fro i abóut 2,000 in 1 970 to more than 7,000 in 1978, and deat* from road crashes also increase rom nearly 3,000 in VO to more than 9,000 in 1978. Similarly, the number of persons injured in road accidents increased from about 13,000 in 1970 to more than 32,000 by 1976 and reached approximately 310,000 in 1978. Altogether, about 50,000 persons were killed in road traffic accidents between 1970 and 1978 while more than 193,000 persons sustained injuries over the same period (FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA, 1979). At the regional scale, the picture has been essentially the Sc »ie; for example casualties from fatal traffic crashes in Kwara Stato increased virtually every year between 1970 and 1978. Whereas there were only 60 reported cases of fatal accidents in 1970, the figure rose to about 229 in 1977. Also, the death toll rose from 87 in 1970 to 348 in 1977 Altogether, 1,773 persons, 1,504 males and 269 female«, lost their lives in fatal traffic crashes in Kwara State between 1970 and 1978 (table 6). On Lagos roads, some 7,804 persons died in road accidents between January and November, 1980 (Nigeria Herald, Jan 1, 1982). Similarly, in Bauchi State, 1 ,107 fatal accidents were recorded between January and September 1980 alone, and although the number of casualties was not given, it was reported that during the same period, about 883 motorists were prosecuted with a total of N 50,545 (ca$US 93,002) paid in fines (Nigerian Tribune, Oct. 28, 1980). At the interstate dimension (tables 7 and 8), Lagos, Bendel, Kaduna, Oyo and Ogun states record the highest number of total accidents. These states, along with Kano, also have the highest recorded number of total accidents and of people killed between 1976 and 1978. Within these same three years, 13,399 accidents were recorded in Lagos, 10,072 in Bendel, 9,466 in Kaduna, 8,831 in Oyo and 7,123 in Ogun. For comparative purposes, the smallest number reported was 3,834 cases.

Lagos also recorded the highest number of fatal accidents, that is, accidents in which at least one person was known to have died. Within three years, 1976-1978, Lagos recorded some 1,613 fatal accidents in which 1,802 people are known to have been killed. During the same period, 5,725 persons are known to have been injured in road accidents in Lagos. At the other end of the scale is Cross River with 448, the lowest number of recorded fatal accidents where 528 persons were killed, and the lowest number of injured persons, 2,880. The socioeconomic costs of road accidents are immense from the national development point of view. Apart from the unmeasurable familial and social costs, traffic crashes retard Nigeria's socioeconomic aspirations and development in the premature loss of qualified and potential contributing professionals and able-bodied men and women in the labor force. The situation is even more tragic, given the large proportion of men in traffic death statistics and given the fact that in Nigeria men are still the major breadwinners of their families. The magnitude of male deaths over females in fatal traffic crashes is exemplified by Kwara State, where as many as 84.6 percent of accident deaths were males (table 6). The direct cost of traffic casualities to Nigeria can best be understood or appreciated in terms of the labor lost to the nation's economy. It has been estimated that about 8,000 out of the 20,132 persons injured in accidents on Nigeria's highways and streets in 1975 no longer participated in the economic mainstream and that "this amounted to a loss of about two million man-years to the nation" (OLUDURO, 1977). Material losses are also sustained through damages to the agent and the various goods carried at the time of accident. For example, in Kwara State about 1,138 motor vehicles and 192 motorcycles were reportedly involved in fatal traffic crashes on Kwara State roads between 1970 and 1978 (table 9). Directly or indirectly, damages done to vehicles and goods involved in road accidents are a substantial loss to the nation's economy. Major causes of road traffic accidents Although numerous, varied and highly interrelated, the causes of road traffic accidents may be divided into four broad categories of factors: • Economic factors such as the wealth and improved standard of living which result in an increase in numbers of vehicles and travellers on the highways and streets; • Human factors relating to the psychological and behavioral aspect of the driver on such issues as drunkenness, drug abuse, drowsiness, fatigue.

The economic boom brought about in recent years by the petroleum industry, and the relative improvement in the average Nigerian standard of living, together with the various financial awards to civil servants and subsequently the upward review of salaries and wages throughout the country have all meant a sudden increase in vehicle ownership and registration (table 4). In Kwara State for example, new vehicle registration grew from 6,066 in 1974 to 10,799 in 1976, morethan 78 percent in two years (KWARA STATE, 1976 and 1978). Of course, as elsewhere in Nigeria, this enormous and sudden increase has not been accompanied by a substantial increase in length of tarred roads or better education for either the man behind the steering wheel or the traffic control officers on the roads. The human factors in fatal highway accidents in Nigeria include careless drivers who are often drunk, reckless and ignorant of traffic regulations. To this may be added the careless attitude of the law enforcement agents - the Road Safety Corps created in the various states- who often leave offending drivers unprosecuted in return for a monetary bribe, thus causing an increase in the volume of fatal traffic accidents on the roads. Only recently, high ranking officials of the Lagos State Road Safety Corps appeared before the Lagos State House of Assembly for interrogation on what was described as the fast deteriorating performance of the corps (Nigerian Herald, November 11, 1980). The general laxity with which law enforcement agents clear up the debris of previous accidents and broken down vehicles also leaves much to be desired. These hazards are left in the middle of the roads until one or more vehicles hit them, killing more innocent people. Similar degrees of laxity have been demonstrated regarding the need to improve notoriously dangerous sections of the roads. The lukewarm attitude of the government towards improving road conditions has been brought to light by the emotionally charged editorial comments of the Nigerian Herald, Wednesday, October 8, 1980: Of recent, the llorin-Jebba stretch of the Lagos-K Jho road has deteriorated to such a level that something very urgent needs to be done. It is on record that the situation of the road has been that bad for some years now. It was this that prompted General Obasanjo to visit part of it including the bridges which have constituted themselves into death traps for the north bound passengers over the past few years. When General Obasanjo saw that ugly sight, he was so moved that he made a promise that, in few days, something reasonable would be done about the bridge. That was over two years now and precisely in February 1978.... As things were to have it, General Obasanjo left office in October last year and up to that time the promise never became a reality.... People are now constipated with the indifferent attitude of the Federal Government to the state of the road and its narrow bridges and have thus resigned themselves to fate hoping that sooner or later providence would intervene and something concrete will be done.... It is our belief that we have had enough of killing and maiming of innocent citizens and of destruction of goods on that road. We shall, therefore, not relent our efforts on the crusade to making those responsible to be able to awake to what we are convinced are their duties. 246 Ekistics 306, May/ June 1984</page><page sequence="6">Table 8 Regional variations in road accident casualties in Nigeria, 1976-1978 Number of persons killed Number of persons Injured State 1876 1977 1978 1976-78 1976 1977 1978 1976-78 1.

Lastly, the Federal Government has failed to insist on design standards like the seát belt, collapsing steering column or super-heavy bumpeis on all vehicles brought into Nigeria. These life-saving devices are already standard requirements for all motor vehicles in the United States, and studies are under way at various academic institutions, including the niversity Qf California at Los Angeles, Michigan and Wayne State Universities, using anthropomorphic dummies (MOLLERING, 1974; SELZER et al, 1967). Being essentially a consumer country, Nigeria has had to accept any vehicle sent to her by the automobile-producing countries of the world. And even though Nigeria herself now assembles various types of cars, safety criteria are ignored.

Onakomaiya (1981), p. 454. human, technical and geographic - referred to earlier in th is study. The most significant without doubt is the human factor. In a recent study on the Western State of Nigeria, now comprising Oyo, Ogun and Ondo states, Onakomaiya (1981) concluded that human factors accounted for 73 percent of accidents and 74 percent of people killed in that state between 1970 and 1975 (tables 10 and 11). The study also shows that the most dangerous aspects of the human element are recklessness, speeding, improper overtaking, etc, which accounted, in the five-year period, for about 45 percent of all road accidents and more than 56 percent of total deaths from road accidents. The study further showed that mechanical factors caused only 5.12 percent of total road accidents and 6.33 percent of total road accident fatalities. Geographic factors or road conditions accounted for only 3.81 percent of all road accidents and 3*49 percent of all accident deaths. Of the remaining 17.62 percent due to miscellaneous and unknown causes, and of the 16.48 percent due to similar causes of road accident deaths, Onakomaiya argues that a thorough investigation of these would also be found related to the human factor (ONAKOMAIYA, 1981). Indeed, Onakomaiya's regional findings have general implications for Nigeria as a whole. There is nothing to prove that the human, geographic and technical causes of road accidents in the former Western State are significantly different from those of any other state. Under this situation, road accidents remain the greatest threat to the successful movement and transport of human and material resources from one place to the other in an attempt to build up a strong and self-reliant country, with a great and dynamic economy. Conclusions and recommendations The causes and subsequent socioeconomic impact of fatal traffic crashes on highways have far-reaching consequences for Nigeria, her policy makers and the general public.

Onakomaiya (1981), p. 455. effort to avoid wastage of about 8,000 lives and injury of another 30,000 persons yearly, Nigeria should of course try to improve many of her roads. But the fact that the majority of the accidents occur on the best roads should once again emphasize that at the root of traffic accidents is the lack of roadway education, whatever that means: frequent warning to drivers on the dangers involved in recklessness, drunkenness, speeding, overtaking on blind corners, overloading their vehicles and not servicing them regularly. While it is imperative to educate the drivers on the importance of obeying road signs and traffic signals, it is also paramount that these signs and signals be placed at appropriate locations. The practice of letting off violators either through the acceptance of undue favors should be discouraged among traffic officials, the road safety corps and the patrol policemen. Finally, it is important that damaged vehicles and all traces of previous accidents be quickly removed from the roads before they cause other accidents and further deaths and injuries, and that the roads and bridges be widened, smoothened and straightened, especially in places where fatal accidents have consistently occurred. Indeed, if we cannot save human beings, goods and services from wanton destruction in road traffic accidents, one would be tempted, and perhaps justifiably so, to passionately conclude, as Mishan does, that the "automobile is, surely, one of the greatest, if not the greatest disaster that ever befell the human race" (1977).
