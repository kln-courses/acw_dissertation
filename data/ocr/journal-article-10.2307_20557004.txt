<plain_text><page sequence="1">Andrew Smith The Pagan Neoplatonists, Response to Christianity In the third century A.D. Christianity was establishing itself more securely both in numbers and in its intellectual foundation as Christian writers began to absorb and exploit Greek philosophical ideas. How did pagan philosophers, and in particular those in the Platonic tradition, react to this new phenomenon? We may, I think, detect a twofold response. Firstly and primarily, a negative reaction which expressed itself in intellectual attacks on Christianity and, secondly, a positive response, the attempt to foster a pagan religious revival based on the latest developments in Platonic philosophy, Neoplatonism. However, the intellectual tenets of pagan Neoplatonism remained, as far as I can see, totally untouched and uninfluenced by Christianity. Plotinus (A.D. 205-269/270), the effective founder of Neoplatonism, does not mention the Christians specifically, though it is possible that there were Christians or Christian Gnostics in his school. Against these Gnostics he wrote a scathing attack in which he takes them to task for their irrationality and their total disparagement of the physical world.1 Although both of these charges could have been levelled at some of the more popular manifestations of Christianity, they were no longer strictly true of the more recent expressions of Christianity which had accom modated Greek philosophical thought. In a sense Plotinus still reflects that lack of concern with Christianity that had been widespread in the first and second centuries when Christianity was scarcely distinguished from Judaism either by officialdom or by the public at large and when its role was considered to be relatively unimportant. But by the end of the third century its presence could hardly be ignored. Plotinus' pupil Porphyry proved to be a watershed. His book Against the Christians was to be the most important and hard-hitting intellectual attack that the Christians ever had to face. But Porphyry was also responsible for laying the groundwork for a more positive pagan response. It is on him that I shall largely concentrate. I shall begin with his criticism of Christianity. The work known as 1. Enneads II.9.</page><page sequence="2">26 THE MAYNOOTH REVIEW Against the Christians consisted of fifteen books which, perhaps, amounted to some seven hundred pages. Its very success ensured its failure to survive; for it was banned in numerous imperial edicts.2 Yet what we know of its contents derives, ironically, from Porphyry's opponents who often quoted his words and ideas before attacking them.3 Porphyry was not only a philosopher, but also a serious scholar. He had first studied under the scholarly Longinus in Athens before coming to Plotinus in Rome in A.D. 263. He would then have been thirty years old. It is not surprising that, in his attack on Christianity, he turned his considerable acumen and knowledge of literary and historical method to a close scrutiny of the Bible of which he shows a very close and detailed knowledge. There is no reason to suppose that this familiarity with the Scriptures lends support to the story that Porphyry had once been a Christian himself. This is probably a Christian invention intended to dis credit him.4 Such knowledge could be expected in a man who after all came from Tyre, an area of very mixed religious beliefs and experiences and who had an immense and insatiable reading knowledge. Moreover the old Testament writings had long attracted the attention of Greek philosophers.5 Before I give some examples of the way in which he approached the Scriptures, it is necessary to grasp the general importance of attacking Christianity at this point. Porphyry saw quite clearly that Christianity was revelation-based in a way in which paganism was not, despite what I shall say later about the important role of oracles, and despite the reverence accorded to philosophical tradition and, in particular, to the text of Plato's works. Christianity begins with revelation and with the 2. Edict of Constantine connected with the Council of Nicaea, A.D. 324 (Socr. hist. eccl. I 9 PG67, 88B7 - Cll); A.D. 435 (Acta Conciliorum Oecumenicorum I. 1.3, p. 68, 8-17); 17th Feb. 448 of Theodosius and Valentinus (ACO I. 1.4, p. 66, 3ff.); 18th April 448 (ACO I. 1.4, p. 67, 2f.); A.D. 451 (ACO II. 3.2, p. 89, 14-16); A.D. 536 Synod of Constantinople (ACO III, p. 121, 22-26). 3.

Very few of the fragments, however, can with complete certainty be assigned to Porphyry. In particular, those drawn from Makarios, an early fifth century Bishop of Magnesia, present special problems. The most we can say of them is that they represent a tradition which may go back to Porphyry. I have indicated the source of each fragment in the footnotes. On the whole question of attribtion cf.

To undermine the trustworthiness of the Scriptures was, therefore, a serious blow to Chris tianity and it is, perhaps, significant that the Christian counter-attacks on Porphyry concentrate their fire in this area rather than in matters of dogma.6 This question of the priority of reason is, I think, the central intellectual motivating factor to all neoplatonic opposition to Chris tianity, and the more keenly felt, perhaps, just because of the religious tendency in Neoplatonism itself. The second, more emotive, reason for opposition was undoubtedly the feeling of outrage at the Christians' alleged opposition to the traditions of Greek culture. These points will become clearer as we proceed. From the first arise naturally what will be of more interest to us - a number of philosophical objections or areas of metaphysical incompatibility. But before coming to these, let us look at his attack on Scripture. He singled out the Book of Daniel for particular attention. This book of the Bible had become increasingly important to Christians in the second and third centuries. They accepted that it had been composed in the sixth cen tury B.C., in which case it prophesied various historical events in the Hellenistic period and down to the time of Christ. Its importance to the Christians lay in its confirming through divine prophecy that Christianity was the successor of Judaism. Porphyry, however, showed that it had been written not in the sixth century but in the second century B.C. In other words, its author was not prophesying events but in fact describing from first hand experience historical events of his own time, for example in the reign of Antiochus IV (175-164).7 When we come to the New Testament, it is striking that Porphyry aims his chief criticisms not at the figure of Christ himself but at the Apostles and their representation and interpretation of Christ. Christ could be integrated relatively easily into the neoplatonic world view when regarded as a wise man with a message and mission, even one supported by mircles. After all, the life of Apollonius of Tyana, who had lived in the first century A.D. and died during the reign of Nerva, could be held up to pagans as a model.8 Often enough the argument was used that, as far as miracles were concerned, Christ was no better than Apollonius or 6. We know that the following wrote specific counter-attacks which survive in meagre fragments: Methodius, Bishop of Olympos (died A.D. 311?); Eusebius, Bishop of Caesarea (260/65-339/40), whose counter-attack is known to us only from citations in Jerome; and Apollinarius of Laodicaea (310-390). 7.

For example the argument of Peter and Paul over circumcision (Gal 2.11) was picked out.11 Peter was also criticized for his lack of forgiveness in cutting off the ear of the ser vant of the high priest when he had been expressly taught forgiveness by Christ (Matth. 18.22).12 His role in the death of Ananias and Sapphira (Acts 5.1-10) was also cited to belittle his stature as a leader.13 The unreliability of the Gospels as accurate documents was exploited at length. The implausibility of the genealogy in Matthew was pointed out,14 as were the inconsistencies in the passion narratives, particularly with regard to the last words of Christ.15 Porphyry attempted to show the ignorance of the Old Testament displayed by the Gospel-writers, as for example in Matth. 13.35, where Isaiah is misquoted.16 Let us turn now to the more philosophical objections. I shall deal with the following: criticism of the exegetical method of Christian writers; that Christian belief is blind and uncritical; that the doctrine of the logos is untenable; the eternity of the universe; the resurrection of the body; and that the soul is not created at birth. The allegorical exegesis of Scripture already had its roots in the Jewish tradition. Philo (30 B.C. - A.D. 45), an Alexandrian Jew, had already used this method to overcome some of the difficulties that a philosophically trained mind might encounter in Scripture; for example, the notion of God's hand or other embarrassing incidents in Scripture. Educated Christian writers, like Origen, also had recourse to this method to harmonize Scripture with Greek philosophical concepts or to link the Old and New Testaments. We might at first be surprised that Porphyry chooses to attack the allegorical method since pagan writers had them selves made use of it, in interpreting myths for example.17 The Neoplatonists were masters of this approach and there survives from Porphyry's hand a short essay in this style, On the Cave of the Nymphs, 9.

We can detect three criticisms: 1. It does not fit the words. 2. There is a lack of clarity. 3. The literal meaning is impossible or repugnant. In the first criticism Porphyry openly adverts to the pagan use of allegory and actually accuses Origen of applying Greek methods. But he implies that it is rather misapplied because it often does not fit the words. For example, a perfectly straightforwad incident from the life of Moses can have all sorts of mysterious and higher meanings read into it.19 The second charge, that of lack of clarity, is directed especially against the parables which are seen as confusing, rather than as helping to clarify, the teaching of Christ. They are also seen as being too mundane to express lofty notions.20 Although pagan allegory sometimes defends the obscurity of the literal text, it is significant that for the pagan the obscurity is overcome by the use of reason. In fact myth is used to sharpen the reason.21 Origen, however, stresses that in the end we need to be specially helped by God to see some hidden meanings (e.g. c. Cels. IV. 50 where, commenting on Ps. 128.18 "Open thou mine eyes that I may understand thy wonders out of thy Law", he says "Here he knew that there is a veil of ignorance lying upon the heart of those who read and do not understand the allegorical meaning. This veil is taken away by God's gift, when he perceives a man who has done everything in his own power, and by use has exercised his senses to distinguish good and evil, and has unceasingly said in his prayers 'Open thou mine eyes, etc.9 "). Porphyry evidently attacked this notion, as we can learn from a passage of the Christian writer Didymus the blind (fourth cent. A.D.). For in reference to the common saying of Christ He that has ears let him hear, Didymus reaffirms against Porphyry that the simple faithful can understand obscure texts by means of a special, supernatural ear.22 18.

How could a man spend three days in a whale and come out with his clothing intact?23 An example of where the literal meaning is repugnant is taken from the Book of Hosea (1.2) where God orders the prophet to marry a whore.24 A more general criticism which embraces several of the points already raised is the charge of doing violence to the literal text. Didymus took the bull by the horns and defended Origen on precisely this point by claiming that this was a legitimate method.25 In this context he cites Por phyry's criticism. Porphyry had apparently illustrated this type of illegitimate allegorisation with a reductio ad absurdum in the form of an obviously inappropriate and violent interpretation of the Iliad in which he compares Hector with the devil and Achilles with Christ. Such an interpretation, presumably, is to be seen as obviously forced and false since it has nothing whatsoever to do with the original. Indeed Homer is the example, par excellence of pagan literature. Any correspondences that can be drawn are entirely gratuitous and display no necessary con nection. A traditional criticism of the Christians had been that of their blind belief. The Christians did not use demonstrative argument (apodeixis) but belief alone (pistis rnone) or irrational belief (alogos pistis). This charge had already appeared in Celsus - "they do not want to give or receive a reason for what they believe".26 It is interesting to note here the refinement in the notion of belief (pistis), which in Plato comes very low indeed in the epistemological scale. The Neoplatonists, here partly following a developing tradition, distinguished the kind of belief which is a form of conviction consequent on demonstrative argument, an idea of Aristotelian origin, from mere belief, that is without logos or reason.27 Another expression used for this irrational belief is "unexamined belief", which recalls the Platonic-Socratic maxim in the Apology that "the unexamined life" or "life without examination" is not worth liv ing.28 Unfortunately not a great deal survives of Porphyry's more 23.

But enough pointers exist to suggest that he would have accepted and probably articulated arguments which are known to us only from later sources.29 The incarnation posed a basic problem for a Neoplatonist. How can the transcendent god be immanent? However, one could point to numerous factors in Greek thought which could suggest an accommoda tion with the view of an incarnate deity. After all, the Greek gods were largely conceived as anthropomorphic. This appearance of deities in human form is a common enough religious experience of pagan anti quity. Within Platonism itself we might point to the embodiment of soul, and to the soul of the universe, which ensures that the world is a god. However, what is at issue here is not the presence of the divine, or some thing divine, in the physical world, but the presence of god in the sense of the supreme god. The creator or craftsman, the demiurgos of Plato, was in no sense immanent in his creation - in fact he was distanced from it somewhat even in the creative stage, for the task of "creating" human souls was delegated to subordinate and lesser divinities. The middle Platonists were keenly aware of the need to maintain the transcendence of the supreme god by cushioning him from his effects. And so they were drawn into positing a number of intermediaries. In fact even pagan religion had presented Porphyry with a similar problem. Certain religious rituals seemed to suggest that the transcen dent gods could be "brought down" to us. Porphyry's respondent in this pagan religious debate, the Neoplatonist Iamblichus, strongly rejects any notion that god can descend to the lower levels of reality. It is rather we, he argues, who are drawn up to god's level.30 Both Porphyry and Iamblichus strenuously resisted any ideas that the highest and transcen dent gods could "descend" to lower levels. Where they differed was that Porphyry thought that the consequences of upholding the divine transcendence raised difficult questions about the nature of divine causality in ritual, whereas Iamblichus thought he could explain away these difficulties. It is in the context of this problem of transcendence that Porphyry attacked the Christian logos doctrine, or at least a version of it. The argument as it survives is based on the originally Stoic notion that logos or expression occurs in two forms, the unexpressed or internal logos (endiathetos) or the expressed logos (prophorikos).31 This Stoic idea had 29.

PG123, 1141).</page><page sequence="8">32 THE MAYNOOTH REVIEW been transmuted by Plotinus (or even earlier) into a metaphysical prin ciple which he employed to express the relationship of subordination between levels of reality in the neoplatonic system - i.e. the One, Intellect and Soul.32 Now this grouping of three realities or hypostases was suffi ciently similar to the Christian Trinity to be exploited by Christian theologians. But it differed, of course, fundamentally in that the neoplatonic hypostases were subordinate to each other and not coor dinate as orthodox Trinitarian doctrine eventually demanded. In his criticism of the notion of logos in John's Gospel Porphyry seems to be arguing that the doctrine has no meaning since the logos of John falls into neither category of logos, i.e. unexpressed or expressed; in other words the logos or son is neither the original nor the derived logos. Por phyry rightly sees that orthodox Christianity did not teach a subordinate son. One of the chief complaints of all anti-Christian polemic is the iden tification of Christ as God. An interesting reflection of the influence of the neoplatonic triad is to be found in Arianism, the heresy of the Christian Arius who taught that Christ is subordinate to the Father. In the imperial condemnations of the works of Porphyry his name is constantly linked to that of Arius and in the edict of A.D. 324 the followers of Arius are referred to as "Por phyrians". What possibly lies behind this is their perceived use of neoplatonic ideas, particularly subordinationism (as mediated through the works of Porphyry) and, more precisely perhaps, the views of Por phyry in which the divinity of Christ is rejected but he is equated with a hero (which in pagan terms means a divinised mortal). I turn now to the last three problems, the eternity of the world, the resurrection, and the creation of soul at birth. These three problems are brought up by Synesius of Cyrene (A.D. 370-413) as stumbling blocks to a full acceptance of Christianity. Synesius had been asked by Theophilus, the metropolitan of Alexandria, to accept the bishopric of Cyrene and the Pentapolis. He was not yet even a baptized Christian. In his reply to Theophilus he explains on what conditions he would accept the post. Above all he wishes to remain close to his first love, neoplatonic philosophizing. He is willing to accept certain Christian dogmas as "mythical" truth presented to the faithful in general, so long as he may continue to hold his own, true view in private. Here are Synesius' own words in a letter (105) to his brother:33 "There is one point, however, which is not new to Theophilus, but of which I must remind him. I must 32. E.g.

Hercher, Epistolographi Graeci (Paris, 1873), pp. 703-706.</page><page sequence="9">THE PAGAN NEO-PLATONISTS' RESPONSE TO CHRISTIANITY 33 press my point here a little more, for beside this difficulty all the others are as nothing. It is difficult, if not impossible, for doctrines to be shaken which have entered the soul through knowledge and proof. You know that philosophy in many ways opposes these doctrines that are on everyone's lips. To be sure, I will never think it right to consider the soul to be generated after the body. I will not say that the cosmos and its parts will perish. The resurrection that everyone speaks about I consider to be something sacred and inexpressible and I am far from agreeing with the ideas held by the masses. The philosopher's mind which has a vision of the truth can agree to a necessary lie". Although these are, strictly speak ing, the private problems of a neoplatonist who wished to embrace Chris tianity, each of them has a long public history. The eternity of the universe was a traditional tenet of Platonism and seemed to follow naturally from the notion of a perfect creator-god whose external act is a necessary corollary of his essential, internal activity. As long as this continues, so does the former. And since the first principle is ever active in a timeless way, the universe has neither begin ning nor end, but always is. In this sense "creation" is timeless and involves not a beginning of any kind but a state of dependence. There are two, related, aspects to the eternity question: the rejection of a tem poral beginning to the universe and the rejection of its ultimate destruc tion. The Christian teaching which went counter to both of these had profound implications for the nature of God or the first principle. Chris tian theologians, taking their cue from Genesis, even read a beginning, in time into the Timaeus of Plato. The destruction of the world was also scripturally based, and reflected to some extent the world-rejecting attitude of the early Christians and particularly of the ascetic/monastic movements. These points were almost certainly raised by Porphyry,34 and were touched on by Celsus who declares that "the world is uncreated and indestructible".35 The sort of arguments put forward may be seen in the little compendium of Sallustius, one of the Emperor Julian's advisers. This small catechism of paganism was published in the second half of the fourth century and contains the following brief r?sum? of the pagan position: "The universe itself must be imperishable and uncreated, imperishable because if it perishes God must necessarily make either a better or a worse or the same or disorder (if he made a worse, then he is bad in that he makes what is worse from what is better; if he made a 34. F34, F89 (Makarios). 35. Origen c. Cels. IV.79.</page><page sequence="10">34 THE MAYNOOTH REVIEW better, he must have been deficient in power not to have made the better thing in the first place; if the same, that will be a purposeless creation; if disorder, why, that will not bear hearing). That it is uncreated even what I have said suffices to show, because if it does not perish, neither did it come into being, since whatever comes into being perishes, coupled with the fact that, since the universe exists because of God's goodness, it follows that God is ever good and the universe ever exists, as light accompanies the existence of sun and fire, and shadow that of body".36 The arguments that lie behind this summary are well rehearsed and have a long tradition. For example, the argument that "whatever comes into being perishes" derives from Plato's Phaedrus 245c-246a2 and was well known (as we learn from Plutarch proc. an. 1016A "Now almost everyone has at the top of his tongue the discourse in the Phaedrus con firming the soul's indestructibility by the fact that it is not subject to generation").37 This particular criticism of Christianity is the only one which we know for certain to have been singled out for detailed and individual attention. In the fifth century, in Athens, the pagan neoplatonic professor Proclus (A.D. 411-485) wrote a specific attack against the Christians on this point. His work On the Eternity of the World against the Christians con tained eighteen arguments for the pagan position.38 Ammonius, a pupil of Proclus (435/45-517/26), returned from Athens to his native Alexan dria to continue the debate - hence the work of his Christian pupil Zacharias, Ammonius or On the Creation of the World (which still sur vives).39 Proclus himself was more directly answered by the Christian Aristotelian Johannes Philoponus in A.D. 529.40 It is not easy to say why Proclus launched such an attack. From the end of the fourth century on, the pagan neoplatonists had kept a rather low public profile, though Athens had remained a centre of paganism and its neoplatonic philosophers were more hostile to Christianity than in Alexandria, where Christian and pagan philosophers rubbed shoulders with each other. I make just two suggestions. Firstly, these very questions had often arisen within the Platonic tradi tion of Timaeus interpretation. Although Platonists all took the same line in general, there were minor differences and the text of Plato did 36. Sallustius Concerning the Gods and the Universe. VII. 1-2 (trans. A. D. Nock). 37. Cf. also Albinus XXV.4.1; Hermias in Phaedr. 115.1-3; Macrobius somn. II.xiii.12. 38. Now lost, but mostly recoverable from the reply of Philoponus, for which see n. 40 below. 39.

Reichardt, Leipzig, 1897.</page><page sequence="11">THE PAGAN NEO-PLATONISTS' RESPONSE TO CHRISTIANITY 35 need explaining. It remained a locus classicus for exegesis. Secondly, the question of the origin of the universe and its eternity raised important issues about many of the most fundamental metaphysical doctrines of Neoplatonism. Since it was, then, already a key area for Neoplatonists and one around which they frequently exercised their own thoughts about important metaphysical issues, it is not surprising that Proclus should find himself in open conflict with Christianity on this ground - especially since the differing attitudes to the world of Christians and Neoplatonists receive their clearest metaphysical exposition in the con text of the problem of eternity. I am thinking here primarily of the Chris tian interventionalist God as opposed to the pagan concept of the world as the natural result of God's essence. From these differing views may flow quite different assessments of the relative worth of the physical world. For the pagan, the world has, in itself, a natural value as an expression of God's activity; for the Christian the world is primarily created for man. The doctrine that the individual soul was created at birth is obviously incompatible with the Platonic doctrine of reminiscence, which requires the pre-existence of the soul. More particularly, it would deny the neoplatonic version of this, according to which we have come from the transcendent intelligible world, where we have our natural home to which we must return. A second consideration here is that the procession of the soul from the higher principles is timeless and not unlimited. That it is timeless would rule out the creation of a soul at a particular point of time. That the supply of souls is limited requires the doctrine of rein carnation in order to people the universe. The notion of limit here derives ultimately from the Greek abhorrence of the unlimited or formless and their corresponding tendency to regard the imposition of limit or form as a perfecting process. The principle of a limited number of souls is neatly summarised by Sallustius:41 "Indeed, if souls do not return into bodies, they must either be unlimited in number or God must continually be making others. But there is nothing unlimited in the universe, since in what is ordered by limit there cannot be anything unlimited. Nor is it possible that other souls should come into being, for everything in which something new is produced must be imperfect, and the universe, as pro ceeding from what is perfect, should be perfect". Synesius' last problem was with the resurrection. The ultimate reunion of body and soul goes against the whole Platonic tradition of striving to separate the two so that the soul can be freed from the distractions of the body to live in its own element. 41. Concerning the Gods and the Universe XX (trans. Nock).</page><page sequence="12">36 THE MAYNOOTH REVIEW Let us return to Porphyry and ask the purpose of his attack on Chris tianity. Unfortunately this is not easy to answer. We are not even sure when his treatise against the Christians was composed. It has been sug gested that it may have been connected with the great persecution of Diocletian in A.D. 303 and a renewed aggression towards Christians.42 In a letter to his wife Marcella, written during a period of forced absence, Porphyry speaks of "the need of the Hellenes". This might suggest that Porphyry was engaged on official business. The letter may be dated to the period 300-303. And it is hard to find a context other than a religious one for the phrase "the need of the Hellenes".43 The term "Hellenes" comes certainly by the time of Julian some sixty years later to imply Greek pagan culture as opposed to Christianity. Are we to sup pose at this time a gathering of the intellectual forces of the pagan world to combat the rising tide of Christianity? The persecution of Diocletian, initiated by an imperial edict on 23rd February 303, was a well-considered move. Diocletian sat in council throughout the winter of 302-303 considering his options. The deeper reasons for the persecution are not easy to determine, but may lie in the general tendency towards uniformity and order in every aspect of imperial administration under the patronage of the traditional gods. Pressure too may have come from the more religiously orthodox and committed, particularly in the Antioch area, culminating in a visit of Galerius and Diocletian to the oracle of Apollo at Didyma.44 Was there an ideological element involved in the decision? The Christian writer Lactantius, who was in the administrative centre of Nicomedia at the same time, provides as close a witness as we are likely to find. He refers to the long-drawn-out conference and to two writers of anti-Christian polemic who seem to have been involved in this conference.45 The first of these, who apparently referred to himself as the high priest of philosophy, and who wrote a three-volume book against the Christians, has sometimes been identified as Porphyry. The second is a certain Hierocles Sossianus. There are good reasons for rejecting the'identifica tion with Porphyry,46 but no reason to suppose that Porphyry might not have been present at some stage as a respected adviser in such matters, one well qualified in view of his published work against the Christians and his other works on pagan religion. This does not directly answer our 42. Cf. H. Chadwick The Sentences of Sextus, Texts and Studies V (1955), pp. 142f.; W. P?tscher Porphyrios Ilpo?

Some of the ideas contained in the publications of Hierocles and his colleague reflect Porphyry's own attitudes. For exam ple, the high priest of philosophy advocates recalling the Christians to the true way - ad veram viam - and of rescuing the simple-minded from the clutches of deceivers. Hierocles attacked Peter and Paul and the other disciples as disseminators of falsehood and showed, according to Lactantius, an intimate knowledge of the Scriptures. It appears that Diocletian initially opposed the persecution but was gradually won round by his more vehemently pagan colleague Galerius. As the persecution was implemented, it became progressively more strict. The relative mildness of its opening may be the result of the more positive outlook of Hierocles and the high priest, the latter hoping to bring Christians back to the true way and Hierocles, according to Lac tantius, writing "not against the Christians, but to them in order to appear conciliatory". It is possible, then, that there may have existed behind the persecution an attempted pagan intellectual revival, but, of course, nothing as explicit as the Emperor Julian's programme of A.D. 361. Did Porphyry have a positive outlook or even plan for pagan religion? There can be no doubt that many of the neoplatonists after Porphyry had a very positive attitude towards pagan cult as a religious experience. With Plotinus and Porphyry, however, the matter is more complex. Plotinus did not disbelieve in pagan religious cult but paid it little heed. An anecdote about Amelius tells us a good deal about Plotinus' views. When his pupil Amelius invited him to do the rounds of the temples, Plotinus politely declined and pointed out that the gods should come to him, not he to the gods.47 Porphyry's attitude is at once more disputed and more complex. He had an intense interest in traditional ritual and belief. He was also,- like Plotinus, convinced that the philosophical way was a sure way to union with the highest principle, the One, and to per sonal salvation. But, unlike Plotinus, he was concerned to find what he called "a universal way of salvation!', i.e. a way to God which would be accessible to all men, whether intellectuals or not.48 The very concern to find such a way, whether he succeeded or not, is of the highest importance, for it led Prophyry to explore the relationship of philosophy and traditional religion. If he finds the rapprochement difficult and is sometimes critical of pagan religious practice, this is to be taken more 47. Cf. Porphyry Life of Plotinus 10.33-36. 48. Cf. esp. Aug. civ. dei X.32.</page><page sequence="14">38 THE MAYNOOTH REVIEW as an on-going dialogue with himself than as a deliberate undermining of paganism. And so, in a letter to an Egyptian priest, he lists a great number of criticisms of paganism, criticisms which Iamblichus answered in that most important of religious documents, On the Mysteries.49 In another work of Porphyry a more careful balance may be seen. In this work, entitled Philosophy from Oracles, Porphyry was attempting to further the link between philosophy and pagan religious practice, and it forms perhaps part of his search for a "universal way of salvation". It is important to realise that many of the major oracular shrines of the ancient world were highly active in the second and third centuries A.D. They were consulted not merely on matters of material interest, but on personal matters of faith, cult practice and theology. They provided, in fact, an important religious experience. One of the more interesting sets of oracles recorded by Porphyry deals with the status of Christ and the God of the Hebrews. Clearly the pagan world in general readily accepted the God of the Hebrews, but could not accept the divinity of Christ. The Father God of the Hebrews could be accommodated in his transcendence to the Platonic first principle. Por phyry could also accept that the supreme, transcendent God could be given different names in different traditions. He was also, like Celsus, impressed by the antiquity and tradition of Judaism. Christ was dif ferent. He was time-bound and restricted to a particular place by his incarnation. But, as already noted, it was the Christians and not Christ whom Porphyry chose as the target of his attack. The pagan world was in general less certain about Christ, an uncertainty which shows in Philosophy from Oracles. The praise of the Jews as upholders of a long tradition of worshipping the one transcendent God is found in a number of citations of this book by Augustine in his City of God (XIX.23). It is found firstly in the con text of an oracle of Apollo which criticizes Christians as guilty of delu sion and which refers to Christ as a mortuus deus rightly condemned by the Jews to a hideous death: "the following reply, in verse, was given by Apollo to one who asked what god he should propitiate in order to recall his wife from Christianity". Then follow these words, purporting to be the utterance of Apollo: "You might perhaps find it easier to write on water in printed characters, or fly like a bird through the air spreading light wings to the breeze, then recall to the senses an impious, polluted wife. Let her go as she pleases, persisting in her vain delusions, singing 49. The fragments of Porphyry's Letter to Anebo have been assembled by A.R. Sodano (Littera ad Anebo, Napoli, 1958) mostly from the de mysteriis of Iamblichus and the praeparatio evang?lica of Eusebius.</page><page sequence="15">THE PAGAN NEO-PLATONISTS' RESPONSE TO CHRISTIANITY 39 in lamentation for a god who died in delusions, who was condemned by right-thinking judges, and killed in hideous fashion by the worst of deaths, a death bound with iron" (trans. Knowles). Another oracle of Apollo recorded by Porphyry seems to be an answer to a Jewish questioner and praises the Hebrew god. "Which is better, word (that is, reason) or law?" Apollo, says Porphyry, "replied in these verses". Porphyry goes on to quote the verse, from which I select the following as sufficient: "[they show reverence] to God, the begetter and the king before all things, at whom heaven trembles and earth and sea and the hidden depths of the underworld and the very divinities shudder in dread; their law is the Father whom the holy Hebrews greatly honour" (trans. Knowles). In an oracle of Hecate, however, Porphyry goes much further. This is preserved by Augustine in The City of God (and by Eusebius):50 "What I am going to say may certainly appear startling to some. I mean the fact that the gods have pronounced Christ to have been extremely devout, and have said that he has become immortal, and that they men tion him in terms of commendation; whereas the Christians, by their account, are polluted and contaminated and entangled in error; and there are many other such slanders they issue against them" (trans. Knowles). Porphyry warns the reader that the contents of the oracle are unusual, that Christ is declared a most pious man who has become immortal. The questioner had asked whether Christ was God, and was given the answer that he was not God but a man outstanding in piety whose soul had been immortalised; but that the Christians make the mistake of worshipping him as a god, and that Christ is responsible in some way for leading them in error, although he was a good man and is in heaven. At the culmination of these oracular references, as recorded by Augustine, Porphyry mentions an oracle of Apollo which declared Christ to have been one of the wise men of the Hebrews who advocated the worship of the Father alone. What status did Christ have in Porphyry's eyes? It has recently been argued that a major theme of the third volume of Philosophy from Oracles was an attempt to "steal" Christ as it were for the pagans and dissociate him from the Christians who betrayed his teaching, and to set up a rival religious system to that of Christianity.51 But this goes too far. 50. dem. evang.

And from these there is no compelling evidence that Christ was a major topic in the third volume. The passages on Christ would naturally have attracted the atten tion of Christian writers who, by giving them so much prominence, prob ably distort the tenor of the whole book. Nevertheless, Porphyry is aware that he is stressing an unusual line. And we know that Hierocles, for example, was not so favourable to Christ, but criticized him as a magi cian and charlatan, comparing him unfavourably with the pagan hero Apollonius of Tyana. The question of Christ's divinity was of course shortly to become a burning issue amongst Christians themselves. The neoplatonic accep tance of a divine/holy man as opposed to a god-man and the metaphysical concept behind it must surely have influenced the great Arian debate with which Porphyry's name was (as we have noted) officially connected. Porphyry had attempted to find a slot for pagan religion and cult within the neoplatonic world picture. He failed, however, to create an acceptable harmony of philosophy and religion; and instead of providing a universal way of salvation he advocated a tiered approach. The divine operates at different levels and each level has its appropriate form of worship. "Since the first god is incorporeal, immoveable, and indivisible ... he is in need of nothing external to himself".52 To the God "who is above all things, we neither sacrifice nor dedicate anything sen sible . . ., and so neither vocal language nor internal speech is suitable to the highest God . . . but we should venerate him in pure silence and with pure conceptions about him".53 To the intelligible gods "hymns recited orally are also to be offered".54 To those lower still may be made sacrifices of inanimate things, whilst the daemons like the smell of roast meat.55 A similar spiritualised form of religion is to be found in Philosophy from Oracles.56 Iamblichus on the other hand grants a loftier position to religious ritual, which can at times even raise us to God himself. This is the line followed by the Emperor Julian. Julian's adviser Sallustius advises that "prayers divorced from sacrifices are only words, prayers with sacrifices are animated words", thus reinforcing the importance of ritual.57 52.

Perhaps neither Porphyry nor Iamblichus, in their philosophy of religion, was responding primarily to a Christian challenge; the case was otherwise with Julian. He attacked the Christians in a polemic which he entitled Against the Galilaeans - the very title expressing the disgust of the pagans with the exclusiveness and narrowness of the Christians. He responded to Christian almsgiving and brotherly love with a plea to his priests to exercise philanthropy.58 He banned Christian teachers from lecturing on the Classics, the normal medium of education; the Chris tians were to return to their primitive scriptures and leave the sophisticated pagan culture to those to whom it really belonged. It is idle to speculate whether these measures would have had any lasting impact had the emperor not met an untimely death on an Eastern campaign. Meanwhile the professional pagan philosophers carried on their teaching and research, and discreetly practised their pagan rites, little interested in the changing world around them. Theirs had always been a narrow circle in any case, and one that in general preferred to maintain an almost aristocratic aloofness from the turmoil of the outer world, whether pagan or Christian.
