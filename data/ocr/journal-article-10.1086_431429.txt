<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> INTERPRETATIO ROMANA clifford ando A mong scholars of classical religion, the terms interpretatioGraeca and interpretatio Romana commonly refer to the “broadidentification among Greeks and Romans of  a foreign godhead with a member of  their own pantheons.” These identifications are generally stud- ied at the level of  naming—not least because most easily collected evidence for them is linguistic, namely, the epigraphically attested use of  “theonyms as appellatives.” What is more, many argue that the central interest of  inter- pretationes lies more or less exclusively in the act of  naming, and not in the act of  identification, and that interpretatio itself  is “therefore a phenomenon in the linguistic-conceptual realm.”1 This seems to me shortsighted. It is my object in this article to suggest that an inquiry into interpretatio Romana might well reveal as much about Roman gods as it does about Roman language. Indeed, the currency of  these terms in religious historiography today is all the more striking for their rarity in ancient usage, in which they functioned largely within discourses on linguistic and cultural translation. It is, in fact, precisely and paradoxically the import of  interpretatio in problems of  lan- guage that, I wish to suggest, reveals most clearly what interpretatio does not reveal in problems of  theology. We might start with interpretatio Romana itself. The phrase occurs in extant Latin literature only once, in a famous passage of  Tacitus’ Germania (43.4): apud Naharvalos antiquae religionis lucus ostenditur. praesidet sacerdos muliebri ornatu, sed deos interpretatione Romana Castorem Pollucemque memorant. ea vis numini, nomen Alcis. nulla simulacra, nullum peregrinae superstitionis vestigium; ut fratres tamen, ut iuvenes venerantur. Among the Naharvali is shown a grove, the seat of  a prehistoric ritual. A priest presides in female dress, but the gods commemorated there are, according to interpretatio Ro- mana, Castor and Pollux. That, at least, is the power manifested by the godhead, whose name is Alci. There are no images, no trace of  any foreign superstition, but nevertheless, they worship these gods as brothers and young men. (trans. after Hutton/Warmington) What did Tacitus mean by interpretatio Romana? Did he, for example, assume that the gods in question were both ontologically prior to human lan- guage and everywhere the same, and that their names in different languages arose arbitrarily? In which case, does he intend no more by interpretatio 1. Graf  1998, 1042–43. Classical Philology 100 (2005): 41–51 [ç 2005 by The University of  Chicago.

Or did he assume that names arise organically, in which case Castor and Pollux were in some as-yet-to-be-determined sense different at Rome and among the Naharvali, and yet still the same? In which case, does interpretatio Romana refer not simply to the translation of  natural signs, but to the intellection necessary to recognize the identity of  their referents? This development of  Tacitus’ diction takes us in a rather different direc- tion from traditional scholarship on the passage and its context. Interpre- tatio Romana has generally been studied not for what it reveals about a specifically Roman form of  polytheism, or in particular about its epistemic and linguistic premises, but rather as a phenomenon of  religion in the prov- inces of  the Empire. To such scholars, Tacitus has provided a name for—and is often taken by them to have intended no more by that name than—a sim- plistic form of  translation, kindred to contact syncretism, by which Romans and Germans, in this case, recognized some identity between the vires of  the numina of  gods whom they knew by different names.2 (I note in passing my own astonishment that this mode of  understanding the divine has not pro- voked more reflection than it has; it seems to me an extraordinarily perilous way of  being in the world.3) And scholars subscribing to such a reading of Tacitus have compiled vast catalogues of  correspondences between Roman and provincial gods, drawing on both epigraphic and literary evidence.4 My concern with this body of  scholarship lies not with its aims or achieve- ments, but with the unreflective way in which Tacitus is made to serve them. For what few scholars other than Georg Wissowa have respected are the very different origins whence ancient evidence for the theory and practice of  interpretatio Romana derives. It is hardly a distortion to say that extant theoretical reflections on interpretatio are universally Roman, while the vast majority of  evidence for its practice is provincial.5 And while it might there- fore be salutary to suggest that a certain caution is in order before aligning Roman theory with provincial practice, it is surely time that we placed Tacitus’ 2. This is the usage foregrounded by Graf  1998. 3. Perilous, that is, because the processes of  recognizing a god on the basis of  some exercise of  its power and then naming it properly were so fraught with difficulty and simultaneously so essential. For an inter- pretation of  Roman cult along these lines see Ando 2003b, 1–15 and 141–46. 4. For two recent studies of  interpretatio Romana along these lines, see Webster 1995 and Spickermann 2001, each of  whom uses the term more or less with the meanings it has acquired in twentieth-century usage. The principal development of  recent years in scholarship of  this kind has been an effort to situate transla- tion and naming in postconquest societies and so redescribe them as forms of  power relations. Derks 1991 is an exemplary study in this vein, harmonizing with efforts then commencing to view Romanization as a form of  competitive performance among local elites. But translation is more than that: “In this chapter and the next I want to say: (1) that translation is an art of  recognition and response, both to another person and to another language; (2) that it carries the translator to a point between languages, between people (and be- tween peoples), where the differences between them can be more fully seen and more nearly comprehended— differences that enable us to see in a new way what each one is, or, perhaps more properly, differences in which the meaning and identity of  each resides; (3) that it involves an assertion of  the self, and of  one’s language too, that is simultaneously a limiting of  both; and (4) that in all these respects it is a model of  law and justice, for these two are at their heart also ways of  establishing right relations, both between one per- son and another and between a mind and the languages it confronts” (White 1990, 230). 5. Indeed, Wissowa 1916–19 is practically alone in recognizing in any systematic way how far modern inquiry into provincial forms of  interpretatio has developed, indeed, has distanced itself  from its theorizing at Rome. </page> <page sequence="3"> Interpretatio Romana 43 remark in its Roman context and situated Roman theories of  interpretatio alongside other Roman writings on religion, language, and knowledge. To start with, Tacitus’ interpretatio Romana is perhaps most easily aligned with a glib but long-lived ancient tradition of  remarking upon the names of gods (Cic. Nat. D. 1.83–84): age et his vocabulis esse deos facimus quibus a nobis nominantur? at primum, quot hominum linguae, tot nomina deorum; non enim ut tu, Velleius, quocumque veneris, sic idem in Italia Volcanus, idem in Africa, idem in Hispania. Come now: do we really think that the gods are everywhere called by the same names by which they are addressed by us? But the gods have as many names as there are languages among humans. For it is not with the gods as with you: you are Velleius wherever you go, but Vulcan is not Vulcan in Italy and in Africa and in Spain. Thus situated, Tacitus finds his place alongside Greeks from Herodotus to Ammianus and Romans from Caesar to, well, Ammianus, in rendering bar- barian religions intelligible to the educated elite of  the Mediterranean basin by, in effect, eliding problems of  cultural and theological difference alto- gether.6 (I say this despite some misgiving that Greeks and Romans based their practices of  identifying and naming gods on very different grounds and gave them expression in very different arenas.) This reading of  Tacitus finds support in other uses of  interpretatio, both within and without ethnographic literature. Pliny, for example, explained that the Druids held nothing more sacred than mistletoe and the tree on which it grows—provided that tree is an oak. Indeed, he says, the Druids perform no rite without the foliage of  those trees, so that it might seem that the Druids might well have, or might seem to have, gotten even their name interpre- tatione Graeca.7 Presumably what Pliny meant is that the Druids got their name from the Greek word for oak. More specific to religion and akin to its usage in Tacitus is the use of  interpretatio by Varro, who denominates interpretationes physicae or physiologicae the allegorical identification of gods with natural forces that constitute one important doctrine of  so-called natural theology.8 But there is a further problem. It is not simply that words rarely map precisely the semantic fields of  other words, even in the same language. The Romans knew that and remarked frequently upon it: the emperor Tiberius urged senators to speak only Latin in the curia, and himself  apologized for using “monopoly”; on another occasion, he requested that the word eßmblhma be replaced in a senatus consultum either with a Latin equivalent, regardless whether that took one word or several, or with a periphrasis—I mean, cir- cumlocution (which Suetonius calls an ambitus verborum). 9 Quintilian 6.

Polybius’ narrative of  the negotiations between the Aetolians and Manius Acilius Glabrio exemplifies the pitfalls that confronted Greeks in their early encounters with Roman magistrates, in which cultural differences were problematically masked by the apparent ease with which each side supposedly translated what the other was saying.11 In 191 b.c.e. the Aetolians decided to ask the consul Glabrio for his pardon and resolved to commit themselves “to the faith of  the Roman people” (e√Í th;n ÔRwmaÇwn pÇstin), not knowing, as Polybius writes, the import (duvnamiÍ) of  the phrase. In fact, a Roman understood surrender in fidem as unconditional; the Aeto- lians, Polybius explains, were deceived by the word “faith” into believing that their action would obtain a more complete pardon (wJ Í a ̇n dia; touÅto teleiotevrou sfÇsin ejlevouÍ uJpavrxontoÍ). After granting the Aetolians an audience, Glabrio began to dictate the terms under which they could act in the future. The Aetolians cried out in surprise: “What you demand is not Greek [ÔEllhnikovn].” Glabrio responded coldly: “Are you still going to run around acting Greek [eßti ga;r uJme∂Í eJllhnokope∂te], even after you have given yourselves e√Í th;n pÇstin? I will throw you all in chains if  I want to.”12 The jurist Gaius reflected rather more self-consciously on this issue when treating verbal obligations, which are created by formulae of  question and response. The particular verborum obligatio “dari spondes? spondeo” (“Do you promise conveyance? I promise”), he writes, was peculiar to Roman citi- zens. Other obligations, he allows, are part of  the ius gentium, and so are valid among all people, citizens and aliens alike. Did he mean that the one formula could only be employed by Roman citizens, and only in Latin, while all others were available to both citizens and aliens? And could those for- mulae be uttered in any language? And if  Gaius indeed draws that distinc- tion, on what basis did he do so? Gaius goes on to list Greek formulae valid between Roman citizens—provided they understand Greek; and he concedes that Latin formulae are valid between aliens, provided they understand Latin (3.92–93): “But the verbal obligation dari spondes? spondeo is so peculiar to Roman citizens that it cannot even be rendered in Greek in an accurate interpretation [ut ne quidem in Graecum sermonem per interpretationem proprie transferri possit], even though the word spondeo is said to derive from a Greek word.” The specific connection here established between language and politi- cal identity merits further study; it is in many ways peculiar, and peculiarly 10.

For what Quintilian, Polybius, and Gaius draw our attention to is the con- tingent particularity and cultural specificity of  concepts and the terms used to represent them. In other words, they draw our attention to translation as a historical problem, one we should seek to locate not simply in place and time, but from place to place, and time to time. Within the sphere of  religion, constructing an identity between gods through naming will have elided differences in iconography and theology that must have been negotiated at levels other than the language of  prayer, for ex- ample. This much is already visible at moments when an interpretatio was contested. So, for example, Tacitus concludes an extended meditation on the origin of  Serapis by allowing that (Hist. 4.84.5) Many identify the god himself  with Aesculapius, because he heals the sick; some with Osiris, a very ancient divinity of  those peoples; many again identify him with Jupiter, for his power over all things; but most identify him with Dispater, from the emblems that are manifest in him, or through arcane reasoning.14 We can perhaps trace something of  the intellectual energy involved in these processes of  identification in Pliny’s remarks on the god who permits the harvesting of  cinnamon: for it can only be culled non nisi permiserit deus, “if  the god allows it.” “Some understand [intellegunt] this god to be Jupiter; the Ethiopians call him Assabinus.”15 The identification evidently required more than merely instantaneous recognition. The slippery nature of  such identifications was never more evident than when those identifications were based on iconography, for the ancient world had itself  already developed a sophisticated critical tradition on action and representation in the practice of  cult.16 This emerges with particular clarity— or particular complexity—in Lucian’s remarkable ethnographic travelogue regarding the temple of  Atargatis at Hieropolis. Of  its inner chamber Lucian writes (Syr. D. 31–32): ejn de; tåÅde eaatai ta; e§dea, h§ te £Hrh kaμ to;n aujtoμ DÇa ejovnta eJtevrå oujnovmati klhÇzou- sin. . . .

In it are two images, one Hera, the other Zeus, whom they call by another name. . . . Certainly the image of  Zeus resembles Zeus in all respects—his head and cloak and throne—so that you would not willingly liken him to anyone else. But Hera will reveal to you as you look at her a form of  diverse appearances. Taken all together, to be sure, she is Hera, but she also has something of  Athena and Aphrodite and Selene and Rhea and Artemis and Nemesis and the Parcae. 13. For the present see Adams 2003 and Ando 2004. 14. deum ipsum multi Aesculapium, quod medeatur aegris corporibus, quidam Osirin, antiquissimum illis gentibus numen, plerique Iovem ut rerum omnium potentem, plurimi Ditem patrem insignibus, quae in ipso manifesta, aut per ambages coniectant. 15. Plin. HN 12.89. 16. For references and bibliography see Ando 2005. </page> <page sequence="6"> 46 Clifford Ando Lucian’s text is rife with such play on the identity of  gods and statues. Here it is perhaps sufficient to note the irony that Hadad can be confidently iden- tified as Zeus on the basis of  iconography, despite the fact that the god was there addressed by another name, while the identity and name of  Atargatis, or Hera, are not explicitly problematized, despite the enormous caveats Lu- cian must then issue about the form she assumes in the temple.17 It is, how- ever, precisely to the question of  form or appearance that Gaius Aurelius Cotta addresses himself  in his dismissal of  Epicurean anthropomorphism at the end of  De natura deorum 1: What are you thinking? That Apis, that bull sacred to the Egyptians, does not seem to the Egyptians to be a god? He is as much a god to them, I’ll wager, as that Sospita of yours is to you. Nor do you ever see her, even in your dreams, but that she is dressed in a goat skin with a spear, small shield, and little shoes turned up at the toe. But such is not Argive or Roman Juno. Therefore Juno has one form among the Argives, another among the Lanuvians. Indeed, the form of  Jupiter is that of  Capitolinus among us, but that of Ammon among the Africans. . . .18 The difficulties raised by Cotta, of  sheer iconographic heterogeneity, on the one hand, and of  the appearance of  Roman gods in foreign lands on the other, were often discussed, and Cicero’s comments deserve placement in that long tradition.19 What demands our attention here is not, once again, the fact of  any given correspondence. Rather, Cicero through Cotta drama- tizes the dynamics of  naming and interpretation in two ways.20 First, as part of  an overall assault on anthropomorphism, he draws attention to the para- doxical power and contingency of  representations. Velleius always sees Juno as Juno Sospita, and yet others see Juno in radically different forms, and will, presumably, always see her in those forms. And yet, Cotta asks, must we believe that Jupiter himself  always has a beard, or that Apollo is in fact beardless?21 The second problem to which Cicero draws our attention is that such identifications, once made, must be made to work in and over time. Having identified Ammon with Jupiter through interpretatio Romana, short of  re- pudiating the identification, one would have the ongoing challenge of  rec- ognizing in Ammon with his horns the essence? the person? of  Jupiter brandishing his thunderbolt.22 Hence what might have appeared a simple 17.

One Line Long </page> <page sequence="7"> Interpretatio Romana 47 problem of  translation stands revealed as but one moment in a complex nebula of  personal accommodation and cross-cultural dialogue whose impli- cations reach far beyond the merely lexical. Or perhaps I should say, trans- lation is here so revealed. The most attentive ancient reader of  Cicero and Varro did not fail to per- ceive the logical instability of  this system, even at the level of  cult within a single state. Writing about Jupiter, Augustine complained (De civ. D. 7.11): dixerunt eum Victorem, Invictum, Opitulum, Inpulsorem, Statorem, Centumpedam, Su- pinalem, Tigillu, Almum, Ruminum et alia quae persequi longum est. haec autem cog- nomina inposuerunt uni deo propter causas potestatesque diversas, non tamen propter tot res etiam tot deos eum esse coegerunt. They called him Victor, Invictus, Opitulus, Inpulsor, Stator, Centumpeda, Supinalis, Tigillus, Almus, Ruminus, and other names that it would take long to enumerate. They have assigned these cognomina to one god for different reasons, on account of  different powers; nevertheless, they did not compel him to be as many gods as they had justifica- tions for names. We should be careful to observe first what Augustine for once does not seize upon, and that is the classical Roman tendency to atomize godheads and in- dividuate divine powers and personalities at the level of  cult.23 Indeed, the power of  his critique here partially rests upon his magnanimous concession that gods normally have single powers and are known by virtue of  them: in other words, that one can identify a god by the vis of  its numen, to adopt the terminology of  Tacitus.24 The object of  Augustine’s scrutiny here is thus not Varro’s Divine Antiq- uities, but his De lingua Latina, a fact made clear by attention to the niceties of  Augustine’s diction.25 In reading that work, we are, alas, constrained by the loss of  its first four books, and especially of  the second, third, and fourth, in which Varro discussed the science of  etymology in general, as well as arguments for and against it (Ling. 5.1). But beyond whatever he will have said there about etymology—he will, for example, have had to consider whether names are natural or arbitrary—he turns in his fifth book to case studies and there admits a further object of  study, namely, semantics. As he there asserts (5.2), “every word has two innate features: from what thing and in what thing it is assigned as a name” (cum unius cuiusque verbi naturae sint duae, a qua re et in qua re vocabulum sit impositum [trans. after Kent]). Varro’s first case study is the body of  terms used to describe places and the things that are connected to them (5.10); his second subject is immortal 23. Scheid 1999; Ando 2003b, 141–46. 24. Cf.

Concerning them [the Gauls] have practically the same opinion as other races do: Apollo wards off  disease, Minerva teaches the principles of  works and crafts, Jupiter holds the rulership of  the heavens, and Mars reigns in warfare”)—a list of  potestates if  ever there was one. 25.

At an etymological level, some gods’ names are clearly arbitrary, as others are natural: otherwise, they could not derive from their powers, as Saturn is from satus, “sowing” (5.64); nor could their names or the names of  their powers be specific to Latin.26 It might then seem quite natural for Varro to supply foreign names for gods. But that task—which is not, I should acknowledge, a dominant feature of  his project—involves more complicated problems of  theology and language than it might seem to at first glance. Take, for example, the gods to whom he devotes the most space, Caelum and Terra, Heaven and Earth. These, it turns out, are also Serapis and Isis of Egypt, and Saturnus and Ops in Latium. Varro uses many different phrases to establish or describe these identities; indeed, he himself  allows that he can call Heaven and Earth multis nominibus, by many names (5.58).27 We may or may not, as ancient readers might or might not, find the arbitrary nature of  gods’ names troubling. But there is still a further difficulty, and that is one of  semantics. It is not simply that as Varro allows Latin names to point to gods who are known by other names in other cultures, so he must also allow that gods’ names are subject to the processes of  coinage and borrowing and the vagaries of  usage that he so meticulously documents re- garding everyday words.28 Among many examples, he cites the currency of Pollux, which not only derives from Greek, but is itself  a departure from old Latin Polluces (5.73–74). Rather, the semantic problem rests with the naming of  gods in the first place, and with the epistemic foundation upon which practices of  naming must rely. For even as Varro refuses to qualify his equation of  Caelum with Serapis with Saturn with Jupiter, he nevertheless debates the appropriateness of  any given name. Ennius calls Jupiter pater, “Father,” writes Varro, be- cause Jupiter patefacit, “makes evident” the seed: “for then it is evident that conception has taken place, when that which is born comes out. . . . This same thing is shown more clearly by Jupiter’s ancient name: for he once was called Diovis and Diespiter, which is to say, ‘Father Day’ ” (5.65–66). (I note in passing that Tac. Hist. 3.84.5, cited above on p. 45, seems to reject precisely the identification of  Jupiter and Dispater that Varro here assumes.) If  some names are more appropriate than others, and if  naming normally proceeds from the perception of  an exercise of  power on the god’s part, then both naming and identification must remain subject to the uncertainties in- herent in any religious system that relies upon an empiricist epistemology.29 26. I take the emphatic focus on vocabulorum impositio in lingua Latina at the start of  Book 5 to be de- cisive in this regard (Ling. 5.1). 27. See also Ling. 5.57: principes dei Caelum et Terra. hi dei idem qui Aegypti Serapis et Isis. . . . idem principes in Latio Saturnus et Ops; 5.64: quare quod caelum principium ab satu est dictus Saturnus, et quod ignis, Saturnalibus cerei superioribus mittuntur.

But why do those who do not call Luna Diana act as they do? Whom do they call Diana? What if  the moon is not Diana? And what if  she is?30 In light of  these concerns, we should return to Varro’s assertion of  a simple identity between Terra and Isis and Ops and Juno, and Caelum and Serapis and Saturn and Jupiter, for what Varro asserts about them is precisely what Cicero could not allow regarding Vulcan (Nat. D. 1.84, p. 43 above). It is, of  course, possible, even likely, that Cicero meant no more than that Vul- can was not called Vulcan in Africa or Spain; likewise, it is possible that Ci- cero meant no more than that Jupiter is not always represented as bearded, any more than Apollo is always depicted as beardless. But how would we know? We run afoul here of  that tendency in ancient literature to refer to cult statues as though they were the gods whom they seem to represent.31 I say “seem to represent” both because ancient theorists often deplored the repre- sentational capacity of  plastic images and their power “over the affections of the miserable,” and because what is at stake in Cicero’s diction might not be representation at all.32 There remains in any event the problem that the identity of  the gods turns out to be distressingly and disconcertingly labile. It is not simply their names and forms, but the gods themselves who are polueidhvÍ and multiplex. On this point, cult practice diverges strongly from philosophical theology, for it was Plato who set the terms for virtually all traditions of  Hellenistic theology, and they believed in gods whose identities were fixed and unchanging. The ontological presuppositions of  cult were quite different. How should one then name a god? And how did one recognize another’s god as identical to one’s own, not least in light of  their radical difference? Gods were not alone in defying the reductive taxonomies of  the semantic urge. Of  the oak Pliny the Elder wrote (HN 16.17): “It is not possible to dis- tinguish the types of  oak by their names, which are different in different 30. Cf. Ling. 5.69: quae ideo quoque videtur ab Latinis Iuno Lucina dicta, vel quod et Terra, ut physici dicunt, et lucet; vel quod ab luce eius qua quis conceptus est usque ad eam, qua partus quis in lucem, luna iuvat (“She appears therefore to be called Juno Lucina by the Latins, either because she is also Earth, as natural scientists maintain, and ‘shines’ [lucet]; or because from that light of  hers in which someone is con- ceived, until that light in which someone is born into the light, the moon [luna] helps”). See also 5.71: To be sure, gods are named a fontibus et fluminibus et ceteris aquis. But how do the waters get their names, and what is the nature of  the connection between god and river? 31. Gordon 1979; cf. Ando 2001a and 2003a. For a valuable survey on the representation of  gods in cult, see Funke 1981. 32. See August. Enarratio in Psalmos 113.2.6: “But, it will be said, we have many instruments and vases made of  materials of  this kind or from metal, for use in celebrating the sacraments, which, being conse- crated by this function, are called holy, in honor of  him who is worshipped for our salvation. And what are these instruments or vases, except the works of  human hands? But do they have mouths, and not speak? Do they have eyes, and not see? Do we pray to them, because through them we pray to God? This is the chief cause of  that impious insanity: the form resembling a living creature has such power over the affections of the miserable that it arouses prayers to itself, even though it is clear that it is not alive, so that it ought to be despised by the living. The images have more power to distract an unhappy soul because they have mouths, eyes, ears, noses, hands, and feet, than they have power for correcting such a soul because they do not speak or see or hear or smell or argue or walk,” quoted and discussed in Ando 2001b. On the classical critique of idolatry see Ando 2005; cf. Cic. Nat. D. 1.84, on the sheer multiplicity of  gods. </page> <page sequence="10"> 50 Clifford Ando places, for while we see the robur and quercus growing all over, we do not see the aesculus everywhere, while a fourth member of  the oak family, which is called the cerrus, is unknown even to a large part of  Italy. We will there- fore distinguish them by their characteristic properties and natures and, when compelled, by their Greek names.” What then of  the Druids, whose name, you may recall, Pliny not only proposed to derive from druÅÍ, Greek for oak; he seems to have suspected that it might actually have come from Greek? But a druid was not an oak, nor, it seems, did Pliny necessarily believe that Gallic oaks were, in fact, druveÍ, to the extent that he associated that word with a specific kind of  oak. In other words, if  Druid did in fact derive from druÅÍ by interpretatio Graeca, it did so despite being, in Varro’s terms, ety- mologically and semantically untrue. In other words, if  it is true, it is false. Which returns us, at long last, to Tacitus. If  the Alci were Castor and Pol- lux by interpretatio Romana, I do not know how to construe that identity. I suppose, in the words of  William Jefferson Clinton, “it depends on what the meaning of  ‘is’ is.” This much at least is clear. In its enigmatic status, interpretatio Romana resembles many of  the other mechanisms with which Romans and their sub- jects negotiated cultural difference, translation among them; it is likewise emblematic of  the myriad problems besetting the study of  cross-cultural con- tact in the ancient world. I will close by asking one more question that I cannot answer. I turn once again to Tacitus Germania 43.4: “There are no images, no trace of  any for- eign superstition, but nevertheless, they worship these gods as brothers and young men.” Foreign to whom?33 University of Southern California 33.
