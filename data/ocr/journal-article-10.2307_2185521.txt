<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Philosophical Review, Vol. C, No. 1 (January 1991) IRRATIONALITY: AN ESSAY ON AKRASIA, SELF-DECEPTION, AND SELF-CONTROL. By ALFRED R. MELE. New York, N.Y., Oxford Uni- versity Press, 1987. Pp. x, 183. In this clearly presented and readable book, Alfred Mele wants to show, against the majority of writers on irrationality, both that incontinent action and self-deception are possible and how they are to be explained. About incontinent action, his claim is that traditional belief-desire models of ex- planation are not sufficient to account for this phenomenon, but when they are supplemented with other explanatory elements, most notably an account of self-control, incontinent action can be understood without re- quiring an anthropomorphic partitioning of the person and without abandoning a causal theory of action. About self-deception, his view is that most cases of it are unintentional and nonparadoxical. Mele also has some secondary aims: to understand self-control and its role in intentional ac- tion, and to resolve some puzzles about self-controlled action. Along the way, Mele offers useful criticisms of contemporary philosophical and psy- chological writings on these topics. One of Mele's main concerns is to defend and explain the occurrence of "strict incontinent action," that is, action performed intentionally and freely and about which, at the time it is performed, the "agent consciously holds a judgment to the effect that there is good and sufficient reason for his not performing" the action at that time (p. 7). Why does an agent freely and intentionally pursue a course of action he judges worse? Mele's general answer falls along traditional lines: the akratic agent's rankings of the objects of his wants are out of line with the force of his wants. He is more strongly motivated to pursue the worse action and acts accordingly. 122</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS To the claim that the akratic agent is compelled to act against his better judgment by irresistible desires (and hence that his action is unfree and not really akratic), Mele replies that we must ask whether the agent could have employed modes of resistance or self-control available to him at the time and which, had he employed them, would have led to continent ac- tion. If he could have done so, then the desire he acted from, though not resisted, was resistible (p. 24). The problem with the akratic agent, ac- cording to Mele, is that he lacks self-control. Hence if we are to under- stand akrasia, we must understand the contrary notion of self-control (enkrateia). Indeed, Mele writes, "the former [akrasia] is properly defined in terms of the latter [self-control]" (p. 50). What, then, is self-control? Self-control is "the ability to master motiva- tion contrary to one's better judgment" (p. 54), where this ability is mea- sured by the collection of resistance techniques at one's disposal as well as by one's ability to determine when self-control is called for and how to invoke it (p. 55). Such techniques include altering one's environment to make acting on the akratic desire less likely, concentrating one's attention on unattractive features of the akratic action, forming a further intention to perform the self-controlled action, and so on. Mele also mentions, but does not discuss, a "broader" notion of self-control which concerns the source of our better judgments. Do these come from us, or from others who control us? If the former, we are self-controlled in Mele's broader sense. I wonder whether Mele's attempt to explain the occurrence of akratic action by reference to a failure of self-control ultimately fares any better than the traditional belief-desire model he finds inadequate. Explanations in terms of reasons for acting are inadequate, Mele claims, because we want to know, in the case of akrasia, why the agent acted on the akratic reason rather than on his better judgment. Yet we can ask a similar ques- tion of Mele's account of akrasia: why did the agent fail to employ a strategy of self-control? If the answer is that he is more strongly motivated to act otherwise, then we need some account of motivational strength that does not reduce "stronger desires" to those on which the agent acts. Mele makes use of recent psychological experiments (pp. 88-93) to argue that desire strength depends on various cognitive factors. But these experi- ments seem to be based on what subjects do. Hence it is hard to see how they support a view of desire strength that is independent of the agent's actions. Although Mele's model of explanation contains more elements than the traditional one, it does not seem to succeed any better in helping us see why one agent acts continently and employs strategies of self- control and another does not. We have a fuller description of akrasia without a full explanation of it and without a convincing defense of its possibility. 123</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS One might think that one could find a deeper, more systematic account of the nature and possibility of incontinent action through an investigation of incontinence as a character trait. But Mele is reluctant to adopt this strategy for two reasons: first, he feels that incontinent actions can be per- formed by persons who do not have the trait of incontinence; and, second, he believes that character traits explain actions only via their influence on other psychological items, for example, on the degree to which we find particular features of action attractive, engrossing, salient, and so on. Character traits are, at best, promissory notes that must be spelled out in terms of these other psychological items (pp. 107-108). We could agree with both of Mele's reservations without abandoning the attempt to find a more systematic and informative account of incon- tinent action in terms of character traits. It is quite possible (indeed, it seems to be suggested by much of the literature on eating disorders and obesity) that some failures to exercise self-control are connected with deeply rooted character traits, with feelings of insecurity and self-doubt. On the other hand, some failures at self-control may be relatively isolated and unconnected to other character traits of the person. These latter might be more susceptible to improvement through instruction in and exposure to self-control strategies. But the more interesting cases of akrasia, those that give rise to the inclination to treat them as unfree or unintentional, may be harder to uproot, because uprooting them may re- quire changing one's views about who one is and what one can do. Mele's account of self-deception is parallel, in important respects, to his account of incontinent action. When a person acts incontinently, she acts against her better judgment because of a contrary desire. Similarly, when a person is self-deceived, she believes against her "better evidence" be- cause of a contrary desire (or she believes against better evidence she could have acquired, were it not for the contrary desire) (p. 136). More- over, Mele claims, the self-deceived person does not become self-deceived by intending to deceive herself. Self-deception is not, therefore, a case of lying to oneself, and one need not attribute contradictory beliefs to the self-deceived person. Mele describes various ways in which a person's desiring that p may contribute to his self-deceptively believing that p. Someone's desiring that p may lead him to misinterpret data as not counting against p; to overlook evidence counting against p; to interpret as supporting p data that count against p, and so on (pp. 125-126). Although Mele is surely correct to recognize that our desires can affect our beliefs in these ways, his ex- amples of belief manipulation do not seem incompatible with viewing self- deception as intentional. And, as with incontinence, I yearn for a more systematic description of cases of self-deception. Why is it that some people are less susceptible to self-deception than others? Are some cases 124</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS of self-deception more crucially linked to prevailing views about our abili- ties and inadequacies than others? These questions about incontinence and self-deception seem particu- larly relevant, given Mele's stated attraction to Aristotle's writings on akrasia and enkrateia and his description of his views on intentional action as at least quasi-Aristotelian (p. viii). Yet for Aristotle, both akrasia and enkrateia are understood as departures from a virtuous condition, which is itself characterized by a deeply seated attitude toward the self and others. Aristotle's virtuous person is a true lover of self (EN 1 169a 1I- 12), who enjoys most the unimpeded expression of the characteristic human powers (EN 1 153al4-15 and 1 176a26-29). Aristotle suggests that all the various nonvirtuous states can be understood in terms of an absence of self-love (EN 1166b2-29) and hence that they are importantly connected to our perceptions of our own abilities and inadequacies. Although Mele argues convincingly against recent views on the nature of incontinence and self-deception and thereby contributes helpfully to a contemporary discussion that is admittedly concerned primarily with the possibility of irrationality, he might have been able to provide a more interesting tax- onomy of irrationality had he enlarged the scope of his work to pursue these lines of thought from Aristotle's writings.
