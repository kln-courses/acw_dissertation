Sullivan Vehicle Research and Test Center East Liberty, OH Jeffrey H. Marcus and Richard M. Morgan National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Washington, DC ABSTRACT Frontal sled tests of the Part 572, APR, and Hybrid III dummies were conducted in a three-point restraint system at 50 km/hr velocity change. The tests were conducted to evaluate the dummy responses in a tightly controlled systems environment, and to compare the dummy responses to previously established cadaver responses from the same environment. The Hybrid III dummy measurement repeatability was found to be better than either the Part 572 or APR dummies, although the thoracic acceleration responses from all three are shown to be quite similar to cadavers. Correlation of the dummy measurements are made to a limited amount of both the cadaver data and accident data from the National Crash Severity Study. SINCE STANDARDIZATION OF THE Part 572 dummy as an automotive test device in the early 1970's, the GM Hybrid III (1)* and the APR *8 1 (2) (Association of Peugeot-Renault) anthropomorphic test devices (ATD's) have been developed. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has conducted a series of component and system level tests to evaluate the relative merits of these three dummies. The component test results (3) demonstrated that the Hybrid III dummy had the best fidelity to cadaver based data, but sensitivity of both the Hybrid III and APR dummy thoraxes to temperature variations suggest that they may be unsuitable as practical automotive test devices unless the temperature is tightly maintained. System level tests were conducted in three-point belt restraint, distributed loading, and unrestrained environments maintained at 72° + 2°F (22 + 1°C) to quantify response differences of the three dummies in a vehicle simulated environment. This paper presents the results of the three-point belt restraint testing. Differences between dummy, human cadaver, and live human responses in three-point belt restraint systems have been widely reported (4-13). Consequently, the establishment of whole-dummy * Numbers in parenthesis represent references at the end of this paper. biomechanical response criteria is very difficult and has not been accomplished. The primary problem cited by the literature is that more severe injuries are noted for the cadaver than is observed in the field accident data. A number of possible causes have been given for this tendency including: a greater fragility of the cadaver than the live human, injury documentation differences between accident victims and cadaver subjects, differences between the simulated and real world environments, possible age distribution differences between cadaver subjects and accident victims, and a tendency for cadavers to submarine more easily. A number of studies have been conducted to further understand the discrepancy. For example, Levine et al. (14) simulated the quadriceps muscle function loss in cadavers with knee braces and found that the frequency of submarining could be reduced. They also found that the injury level and number of fractured ribs were reduced. Patrick and Levine (7) reported that cadavers in their study sustained the same type of injuries as found in the accident data, but at a lower delta-V. From their work, Cheng, Mital, et al. (15,16) concluded that the tendency of the cadaver to sustain injuries at a lower delta-V than living humans could be used to screen potentially injurious conditions before conducting human volunteer tests at low level accelerations. The human volunteer, naturally, cannot be subjected to the acceleration levels necessary to establish whole- dummy response criteria. The human cadaver, which can provide information necessary to establish such criteria, can be subjected to these acceleration levels. The difficulties in linking the human cadaver and living volunteer studies to the accident data caused Nyquist et al. (17) to develop a "calibration" of the Hybrid III dummy by correlation of field accident injuries to dummy responses for three-point belt restraint systems. Nyquist et al. sub-divided a subset of the Patrick et al. (18) field accident data into injuries for the head, neck, thorax, and lower torso body regions. Sled tests were then conducted with the Hybrid III dummy simulating the accident partitions, and the resulting measurements on the Hybrid III were correlated to the various body region injuries observed in the accident cases. Alem et al. (6) conducted a series of comparative tests with cadavers, the Hybrid 4.606 0096-736X/84/9204-0606$02.50 Copyright 1984 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">III and the Part 572 dummies which indicated some similarities between the two dummies. Direct comparisons to the accident data are not possible from those tests, however. A sled test series with cadavers and Part 572 dummies conducted by Kallieris et al. (12) does provide a direct comparison to the accident data. The tests were conducted using a pulse similar to the Volvo P 140 to allow comparison to the work of Patrick et al. (18), and confirmed many of the human cadaver, dummy, and accident data differences discussed above. Due to the ability of the Kallieris study to be linked to both the cadaver and accident data, it was duplicated in the present study for the purposes of aiding the dummy evaluation process. The specific purposes of this study were to: i) obtain response comparisons of the Part 572, Hybrid III, and APR dummies in a realistic three-point belt restraint system, and ii) compare the dummy measurements with cadaver and accident data. DUMMY EXPERIMENTAL TESTS TEST DESCRIPTION - The tests were conducted on a 24 inch (61 cm) HYGE sled simulating the Volvo Pi 40 fixed barrier 30 mph (50 km/hr) crash pulse (12) with a half-sine pulse as shown in Figure 1. Volvo 244 front seat and three-point belt retractor systems were mounted on the sled buck duplicating the Kallieris anchorage configuration. The seat cushion frames were reinforced to eliminate deformation of the seat frame allowing three tests to be conducted per seat. A new seat was used for each dummy, and new belts and retractor systems were used for each test. Belt uniformity was ensured by obtaining webbing material manufactured from a single run. The overall sled configuration is shown in Figure 2. The dummy instrumentation for the test series included eighteen Endevco 2264-2000 miniature accelerometers (head C.G. triaxial cluster, thorax twelve accelerometer array, and pelvic triaxial cluster), chest deflection, and femur loads. Additionally, the Hybrid III dummy was instrumented with its standard neck transducer, and the lower leg instrumentation described by Nyquist et al. (19). Shoulder belt load, inboard and outboard lap belt loads, and sled acceleration pulse were also recorded.

The data were then digitally processed through a Butterworth lowpass phaseless filter algorithm to the appropriate SAE channel class. The dummies were clothed with knee length cotton stretch pants. Surgical tape was applied diagonally across the dummy thorax (Figure 2) to aid in the application of photographic targets while maintaining a realistic frictional interface with the shoulder belt. Photographic targets were applied to the dummy head, shoulder tops, shoulder pivot, H-point, and knee pivot. The dummies were positioned on the seat following the TP-208-05 Laboratory Procedure. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS - The sled simulation test conditions are summarized in Table 1, and show that the sled peak acceleration levels and delta-Vfs were tightly controlled. Coefficient of variations (C.V.) for these parameters were less than one-half percent. The sled acceleration onset rates were calculated based upon the acceleration peak values and are also shown in Table 1. The restraint system measurements are summarized in Table 2. The belt loadings demonstrated good repeatability as evidenced by the low coefficients of variation. Several observations relative to the restraint system measurements can be noted and are corroborated by statistical analysis: The mean values of peak belt load for the Part 572 and APR dummies cannot be considered different. The mean value of the peak belt load for the Hybrid III dummy is higher than either the Part 572 or APR dummy values. 4.607</page><page sequence="3">Ą gog R« A.

The similarity between the Part 572 and APR belt loads combined with the higher Hybrid III loads tends to indicate that the amount of belt spoolout did not have a significant effect on dummy response. This was also verified through examination of the dummy initial acceleration onsets. The dummy measurements are summarized in Table 3. A number of interesting observations (which are supported by statistical analysis) are made from the dummy measurements: Both the Part 572 and the APR dummies produced peak head resultant acceleration means which could not be considered different (52-57 g's). The Hybrid III peak head resultant acceleration mean was approximately 20 g's higher than the Part 572 and APR responses. Despite the wide difference in peak head acceleration responses, all three dummies yielded similar HIC calculation results. The peak resultant chest accelerations for all three dummies fell within a 6g spread, however, the mean values were found to be statistically different from each other. Despite the similarity among the dummy peak chest acceleration responses, the peak thorax deflections for the three dummies were radically different. The peak resultant pelvic acceleration response means for all three dummies were comparable. The average Hybrid III neck transducer measurements for shear force, axial force, and occipital condyle moment were 408 lbs., 570 lbs., and 129 ft-lb. (1815 N, 2535 N, and 175 N-m), respectively. The repeatability of the Hybrid III dummy measurements was better than either the Part 572 or APR dummies.

Figures 3 and 4 show the Part 572 and APR resultant head acceleration responses, respectively, and illustrate that the response variability is not limited to the peak response. By contrast, the Hybrid III resultant head acceleration (Figure 5) shows very good repeatability throughout the response. Comparison of the individual head responses as well as the mean responses of Figure 6 shows that considerable differences in the head accelerations occurred although the HIC's are Fig. 6 - Resultant head accel. response means Fig. 7 - Thoracic accel. response means Fig. 8 - Thoracic deflection response means comparable. The mean head acceleration responses in Figure 6 produced HIC's of 583, 674 and 677 for the Part 572, APR and Hybrid III dummies, respectively. The dummy thoracic responses are also quite interesting. The excellent repeatability of the peak thoracic accelerations was reflected in the acceleration-time histories. Comparison of the mean acceleration-time thoracic responses in Figure 7 shows that all three dummies had very similar overall waveforms as well as peak responses.

Both integration of the thoracic acceleration and photographic analysis indicate that the thoracic spines underwent approximately a 20 inch (51 cm) displacement due to the combined effect of thorax displacement and belt stretch. The dummy thoracic compliances have, therefore, only a small effect (less than 10%) on the dummy performance, with the restraint system being the primary factor controlling the dummy response. COMPARISON TO PREVIOUS WORK - Kallieris et al. (12) conducted five tests with the Part 572 dummy for direct comparison to cadaver tests with the Volvo 3-point restraint system. In that study, it was concluded that the Part 572 dummy: i) had chest acceleration similar to the cadaver, ii) had different kinematics than the cadaver, and iii) submarined less frequently than cadavers. Available data from the Kallieris study are shown with data from the present study in Table 4. The Part 572 dummy data from the present study are in good agreement with the Kallieris dummy data in terms of lap belt loads and thoracic acceleration. In the present study, greater displacement of the Part 572 head and thorax is observed, although it is in good agreement with the Kallieris cadaver data. Kallieris noted that possible causes of the discrepancy could include differences in the dummy seated height and thoracic stiffness. He also noted that pelvic displacement was greater for the cadavers.

Since the Kallieris dummies apparently did not have pants, but both the dummies from the present study and the Kallieris cadavers did; it seems possible that the seat friction may also be a factor in the Kallieris Part 572 displacement discrepancy with the cadaver results. COMPARISON TO CADAVER DATA A more detailed comparison of the dummy response data was made with Heidelberg cadaver data (from the same test series described by Kallieris et al.) utilizing the technique described by Morgan et al. (20). A total of fifteen cadaver tests were available for the analysis. Two were eliminated due to rotation out of the shoulder belt. From the thirteen* remaining tests, the available data from the twelve accelerometer thoracic array, pelvic accelerations, and belt loads were analyzed. As indicated in Table 5, not all data channels from all tests were available for the analysis. To ensure compatibility of the dummy and cadaver digital data, both were processed through a 300 Hz low pass, two pole Butterworth filter, subsampled to 1600 Hz, and again filtered through a low pass Finite Impulse Response routine having a passband frequency of 1 00 Hz, 1 89 Hz stopband * The cadaver tests used in the analysis were numbers H79007, H79008, H79009, H79011, H79015, H79016, H79017, H79018, H79019, H80001, H80002, H80006, and H80008.

This was not the case, however, for the cadaver tests. The cadaver data were aligned by arbitrarily selecting one of the tests and then minimizing the cumulative variance** between its data channels and the corresponding channels from the other tests. The Mean Cadaver Response (MCR) for each of the available signals was computed as well as the one standard deviation corridor. Comparison of the dummy upper and lower sternum, upper and lower spine, and pelvic accelerations; and shoulder and lap belt loads with the cadaver corridors are shown in Figures 9-15, and indicate that the dummy data are in generally good agreement with each other and with the cadaver responses. The degree of agreement is quantified in Table 5 in which the cumulative variances between the cadaver and dummy mean responses are compared for all three dummies. The dummy cumulative variance values are significant only in a relative sense, and no direct interpretation should be associated with the absolute numbers. A lower value of the cumulative variance indicates better agreement between the dummy and cadaver mean responses than does a higher value. Although there are significant percentage differences in the cumulative variance for a given signal between the dummies, there is no consistency which might indicate that one of the dummies is in closer agreement to the cadaver data than the others. In fact, a summation of the five dummy data channel cumulative variances indicates less than 4% overall variation among the three dummies. In terms of shoulder and lap belt loads, however, the Part 572 and APR dummies are in closer agreement to the cadaver data. The Cadaver Cumulative Variance (CCV) is also shown in Table 5. The CCV is computed by calculating the cumulative variance between each cadaver test and the MCR for a given signal, and then averaging by the number of tests to obtain the CCV (or an average cadaver cumulative variance from the MCR). Comparison of the CCV with the cumulative variance between the dummy and cadaver response means confirms the general observation from Figures 9-15 that the dummies are in fairly close agreement to the cadaver data. The dummy sternal responses match the MCR as closely as the average cadaver tested, whereas the spinal, pelvic, and belt responses show that the dummies have more deviation from the MCR than the average cadaver. Part of these differences could be related to the phase relationship of the responses. The phase relationship between the cadaver signals is not maintained when the cadaver data are aligned through the minimized variance methodology. An analysis of the dummy and cadaver phase relationships was conducted, however, by integrating the acceleration signals and determining the point in time at which 10% of the test delta-V was reached. The results of the **The cumulative variance (defined in Reference 20) is the summation over time of the variance at each discrete point of the data channel. When only two channels are being compared, this reduces to the square of the differences summed over time. analysis evinced that the dummy spinal accelerations underwent the delta-V sooner than the pelvic signals, whereas the opposite occurred for the cadaver. This difference in cadaver versus dummy response may be caused by differences in the thoracic compliance, the spinal stiffness, or both. ACCIDENT DATA ANALYSIS In his study, Kallieris found that the cadavers sustained more severe injuries than the Patrick et.al. accident data base. In order to obtain an additional correlation between the dummy measurements and accident data, analysis of the more recent National Crash Severity Study (NCSS) accident data base was conducted in this study for comparison with the Volvo three-point restraint HYGE sled tests. The following criteria were used in the selection process: Frontal force impact with force direction of 11, 1 2 or 1 o'clock. Delta-V based upon vehicle damage from 25 mph to 35 mph (40 to 56 km/hr), inclusive. Case vehicle weight from 2000 to 4000 lbs (8907 to 1814 kg), inclusive. Three-point belt system must have been worn by occupant. Occupant must have been either the driver or the right front passenger. The partitioning of the data set resulted in a subset consisting of 1 3 occupant cases (8 from 25 to 29 mph, and 5 between 30 and 35 mph). Since eligibility into the NCSS accident data file was based upon a stratified selection scheme, each case had a weighting factor based on the highest injury level sustained by an occupant in the case vehicle. This weighting factor provides a better representation of the NCSS data to the total accident population. Therefore, the 1 3 qualified unweighted cases were weighted by their respective weighting factors, yielding a total of 31 occupants. The 31 occupants had the following characteristics: 1 4 occupants with no injury. 1 7 occupants with AIS injury levels of at least one. 28 males and 3 females. 27 occupants were drivers and 4 occupants were right front passengers. Occupant ages range from 18 to 60 years (with mean age of 28). Two occupants were fatalities (both occupants of the same vehicle with Delta-V = 26 mph, a 55 year old male driver and a 60 year old female passenger). The occupant body regions of major interest for comparison to the dummy data were the head, neck, thorax and lower torso. Facial injuries were included with the head; shoulder and back injuries were included in the thorax; and the lower torso body region injuries were comprised of abdominal and pelvic injuries. Injuries to the extremities were not included. The accident data injury level distribution is summarized by body region in Table 6. The OAIS distribution for both the weighted and actual cases are also shown in Table 6. Since the weighted cases provide a better representation of total accident population, they are used in the subsequent discussion.

Of the AIS greater than 1 injuries, 91% of the injuries were caused by vehicle interior contact (i.e., 9% were caused by non-contact or restraint system contact). All head injuries were due to contact. Only 6% of the occupants sustained neck injury with the highest being AIS 2. Of the thoracic injuries, 10% were AIS greater than 1. Of the lower torso injuries, five (at AIS = 1 level) were due to the restraint system; all others were due to vehicle interior contact. Based upon the results of the accident analysis, it appears that the sled test condition (with no potential for vehicle interior contact) represents an environment in which there should be a small probability (3%) that injury levels of AIS greater xhan 1 would occur. However, although vehicle interior contacts are noted, it is not possible to conclude that the contact actually caused the injury. Since some of the injuries noted as being due to contact could actually be due to the restraint system, all injuries were included for comparison of the dummy and accident data in the following section. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS Injuries which were recorded for the twelve cadavers (age range from 18 to 31 years; mean age of 31) in the Heidelberg cadaver test series reported by Kallieris are summarized in Table 7. The non-minor injuries sustained by the cadavers were primarily thoracic and vertebral column.

NA - Not Applicable NR - None Reported dummies in a three point belt restraint system, an in-depth case review of the accident data was not conducted. The prupose of the accident data analysis was to determine if the injury differences between the cadaver and accident based data reported by Kallieris were also observed when the NCSS accident data were reviewed. The dummy measurements, NCSS accident data, and Kallieris cadaver data are all combined for comparison in Table 8. Comparison between the cadaver and accident data of Table 8 indicate the following conclusions: A tendency for the cadaver based injury information to show higher injury levels than NCSS accident based data is observed from the very limited number of samples. While only 19% of the accident population occupants sustained injuries above AIS=1, 100% of the cadaver subjects sustained such injuries. As discussed in the introduction, many possible explanations for this discrepancy have been reported. Both the NCSS accident data and cadaver data bases are very limited while there does not appear to be sufficient data at this time which could be used to explain the above discrepancy, a need definitely is indicated to conduct a concerted study aimed at understanding the cause of the discrepancy. Although it is recognized that the data are limited, the data of Table 8 indicate that: When head impact does not occur, peak resultant head accelerations of 57, 58, and 75 g's for the Part 572, APR, and Hybrid III dummies, respectively, appear to represent non-injurious exposure levels based upon the accident data. Accident data used in this study indicate that an environment which causes Hybrid III neck shear forces (A-P), axial tensile loads, and flexion bending moments of 408 lb., 570 lb., and 129 in-lb. (1815 N, 2335 N, and 175 N-m), respectively, appear to have a 94% probability of being non-injurious. Peak resultant dummy chest accelerations of 38-42 g's for all three dummies appear to represent a 10% probability of injury greater than AIS = 1 based upon the accident data. Cadaver data indicate a 100% probability of injury greater than AIS 1, and an 83% probability of AIS = 3 for these chest acceleration levels. Peak resultant</page><page sequence="17">4* 622 R» A» SAUL, ET AL» dummy pelvic accelerations of approximately 55 gfs appear to represent a 17% probability of AB = 1 and greater level injury based upon the cadaver data. The accident data appear to indicate 23% probability of AB = 1 and greater level injury for those pelvic acceleration levels. The pelvic data appear to indicate agreement between the accident and cadaver data; however, all but one of the accident injuries were reported to be due to contact with the vehicle interior whereas the cadaver injuries were belt induced. Both the pelvic and thoracic disparities between accident and cadaver data could have several causes as discussed previously. If vehicle interior contact injuries had been excluded, the accident injury should have been decreased, thereby increasing the differences. It should be noted, however, that neither the cadaver nor the dummy tests had an instrument panel on the sled buck. Although the NCSS and Patrick accident data sources show very few non-minor injuries to the knees and femurs, it is possible that they could have contacted the instrument panel and reduced the loading through the belt system to the thorax and pelvis. Conclusions relative to the dummy response comparison, which was the primary emphasis of this study, are that: The Part 572, APR, and Hybrid III dummy HIC and thoracic acceleration responses in the three-point belt restraint system were similar, but the Hybrid III peak resultant head acceleration was approximately 20 gfs higher. The Hybrid III dummy measurement repeatability in the three-point restraint system was better than either the Part 572 or APR dummies. Responses of the cadaver thoracic twelve accelerometer array are very similar to the dummy responses in the three-point belt system. The belt restraint system was an order of magnitude more compliant than the dummy thoraxes, providing little basis for dummy performance evaluation other than repeatability. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The discussion and conclusions in the paper represent the opinions of the authors and not necessarily those of the NHT5A. The cooperation of Dimitrios Kallieris, University of Heidelberg, in providing the Heidelberg cadaver data; and Nils B ohlin, Volvo, for ensuring the seat cushion and restraint system uniformity was greatly appreciated. The authors would also like to acknowledge Ed McGhee, Gerda England, Diane Carroll, and Susan Weiser for their efforts in the project and manuscript preparation. REFERENCES 1. Foster, J.
