<plain_text><page sequence="1">Letlers ANIMAL RIGHTS November's BioScience is a delight! The issue-related material made my usual casual flipping impossible. The animal rights articles were particularly provocative. As a botanist who tries to think and behave with moral care, I have been puzzled by animal rights arguments precisely because they are taxon oriented (contrary to the words of many who espouse them): Is "kingdomism" (Animalia) morally better than "speciesism"? Why should we maintain mor- al respect for only some organisms, based upon the arbitrary, anthropomorphic, and poorly understood criterion of "sentience"? Extending "animal rights" to all organisms ("love plants, don't eat them!") makes it clear that the "morality" of the animal rights movement is philosophically inconsistent. To me the moral stance is that of respect and compassion for all life forms that shuns all wantonness and ill use. Eating a cow is intrin- sically no better or worse than eating wheat. My own goal is to recognize what is involved (organismically, socially, energetically, eco- logically) in getting food to my plate. I try to be both thoughtful about and thankful for having it available, regardless of the taxon of its source. Further, I wish to eat in such a way as to minimize negative impacts on other organisms. The issue cannot be as simple as whether or not to eat meat: Do lettuce- or grape-eating vegetarians understand their complicity in the suffering of United Farm- worker families? Similar arguments pertain for use of orga- nisms in research: Of paramount importance is the clarity of the researcher about compas- sion and respect for research organisms, their populations (whether captive or wild), and habitats. Again, no wanton use is moral. Perhaps the current strength of the animal rights movement derives from evidence that in the competitive scurry to produce ego- boosting results, some researchers have lost sight of thoughtfulness, compassion, and respect. JAMES C. HICKMAN Jepson Herbarium Department of Botany University of California Berkeley, CA 94720 One problem in the debate over laboratory animals and animal rights that was not ad- dressed by any of the articles in the Novem- ber issue is the definition of animal. We biologists realize that everything from spong- es to vertebrates are animals, i.e., in the animal kingdom. Most of the animal rights people, however, are concerned primarily about mammals, and maybe occasionally birds. Although some groups in England are becoming concerned about fish, the humane groups here are not very interested. Never- theless, to do research on fish, I must get the university veterinarian to "sign off' that I am treating them properly. Each time he does so, he says that he really knows nothing about fish-which is to be expected. It would be nice if we could at last agree on what we are talking about in this animal rights debate.

I refer to the belief of 19th century authorities that "... the violent scientific prying into God's creation" should be prevented as sinful (November 1984 BioScience 34: 630). Omit the "violent," and I have encountered this attitude in the second quarter of the 20th century, which was a time of ridiculous reli- gious exercise-even as today. In my junior year, I was competing for a seat in the varsity crew, when an elderly philosopher approached and asked, "You won't take that test the Englishman is giving some of the boys will you?" Taken by surprise, I could only inquire who was the Englishman, what was the test, and why was it philosophically objectionable? The university had hired Nobel laureate A. V. Hill as a distinguished visiting professor, and he was interested in determining the ability of oarsmen to absorb oxygen under muscular stress. Possibly driving a rowing machine at top speed qualifies as "violent." 138 The philosophical "violence" had a more religious cast, however. "If God had intended you to know how much oxygen you need, He would have told you!" the guardian of my "sins" declared. Naturally I volunteered to be one of Profes- sor Hill's guinea pigs and had the good for- tune to break his oxygen absorption records. He paid me considerable mind as a result, and I came to value the contact with the Nobel laureate as one of my most valuable educa- tional experiences. I thank BioScience for reminding me that it is immoral, immodest, and sinful to some fundamentalist philosophers when one pries into God's creative secrets! PAUL D.
