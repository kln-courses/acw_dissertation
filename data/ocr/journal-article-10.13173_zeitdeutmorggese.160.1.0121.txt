<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Taoist Thunder Magic (五雷法),  Illustrated with the Example of the Divine  Protector Chao Kung-ming 趙公明 By Florian C. Reiter, Berlin Summary: Since the 12th century the term Thunder Magic [rituals] has been a label for a  great number of exorcist rituals that are constitutive parts of religious Taoism (T’ien-shih  tao 天師道 /Cheng-i tao 正一道). The article first considers the emergence of Thunder  Magic in Taoist history and then focuses on the martial Thunder divinity Chao Kung- ming in order to illustrate the intent, the ways and means of Thunder rituals. There is a  wide range for the application of Thunder Magic, for example the expulsion of epidemics.  A presentation of crucial aspects of the spiritual standing of the priest leads to a discus- sion of the writing of Thunder amulets, which are the practical and visible highlights of  Thunder rituals. A discussion of the world of Thunder divinities displays basic religious  tenets that also pertain to all the preceding themes. The article presents a close description  of the genuine connection of Thunder Magic with Heavenly Masters Taoism. The Emergence of Thunder Magic in Taoist History The Heavenly Master patriarch Chang Yü-ch’u 張宇初 (1361–1410) presents  in his collection Hsien-ch’üan chi 峴泉集 detailed descriptions of the ori- gin and mutual relationship of historic Taoist groups or branches with their  supposed divine patrons. They all are identified with the transmission of  sacred texts through most exalted divinities. In this context we find am- ple explanations about the Pure Tenuity branch of Taoism (ch’ing-wei 清微)  that was formulated in the 14th century. 1 Ch’ing-wei Taoism was claimed  to be the origin of Taoism and finally the reuniting force, merging the  branches Ling-pao 靈寶, Tao-te 道德, and Cheng-i 正一 that had developed  in the course of history. Their later reunion was again labelled Ch’ing-wei  1 TT 1311: 7.12 sq., especially pp. 13 a–14. F. C. Reiter 1988, pp. 42–52. J. M. Boltz  1987, pp. 38–41 (“Ch’ing-wei, Clarified Tenuity”). See Liu Chih-wan 1994. Liu Chih- wan, p. 67 lists various designations for Thunder Magic that also point to the historic  background and constituent elements, for example the term Wu-lei t’ien-hsin cheng-fa  五雷天心正法, referring to the Heart of Heaven (ursa major) as the central position of  Thunder deities. </page> <page sequence="2"> 122 Florian C. Reiter  Taoism. 2 Ch’ing-wei Taoism with its exorcist concerns continued the older  traditions of Shen-hsiao 神霄 Taoism that was connected with the life of  the court Taoist Wang Wen-ch’ing (1093–1153) 王文卿. 3 Shen-hsiao Taoism  and Ch’ing-wei Taoism represent large facets of individual and small scale  rituals of exorcism. Such rituals serve the daily needs of people who suffer  from epidemics, droughts, inundations and other molestations that seem to  reveal the clandestine presence of baleful demonic forces. Shen-hsiao and  Ch’ing-wei are two names of heavenly spheres where the divine patrons of  the rituals in consideration reside and send down their subordinate Thunder  generals with their spirit troops to execute in the world the ritual requests  and orders that Taoist priests (tao-shih/fa-shih 道士/法師) 4 had issued. The  titles of the respective rituals and the relevant canonical texts often show  Shen-hsiao or Ch’ing-wei as initial specification. 5 Canonical texts with the designation Shen-hsiao present, for example,  numerous amulets that could be used “to break up the hells of earth” ( p’o ti- yü fu 破地嶽符). Such amulets were allegedly revealed from the Court of the  Yellow Register (huang-lu yüan 黃籙院) that is based in the heaven of Jade  Purity 玉清. Chang Yü-ch’u explicitly acknowledges that the Ch’ing-wei  branch of Taoism continues the older Shen-hsiao traditions and informs us 6 that the True King of Jade Purity and Great God-emperor of Long Life in the  most exalted Shen-hsiao Heaven 高上神霄玉清真王長生大帝 is the chief orga- niser of the thirty six heavens in the nine empyreans (chiu-hsiao 九霄) where  thirty six Heavenly Worthies reside. 7 However, only the Great God-emperor  of Long Life comprehensively leads on &lt;the signs of origin&gt; ( yüan-hsiang  元象). The deity dominates and has a firm grip of Yin and Yang. It is for this  2 TT 171 Ch’ing-wei hsien-p’u 11 b–15 b (hui-tao 會道), TT 1220 Tao-fa hui-yüan  2.9 b–10 a.

Formerly, the deity Highest Lord of Origin (Wu-shang yüan-chün 無上 元君) attained to the Tao of Nine-and-Five. The scriptures say that the one  [deity] that attains to the Tao of Nine-and-Five becomes the God-emperor for  Thunders and thunderclaps. 8  The Lords of the Five Thunders (Wu-lei chün 五雷君) received the Tao of  the Thunders and thunderclaps of Three-and-One (San-i lei-t’ing chih tao  三一雷霆之道). The number three is the ancestral number of the East, and  [number] one is the number of life in the North. The immortal masters say  that the Great One, Lord of Origin (T’ai-i yüan-chün 太一元君) leaked this  [information] which is the most perfect truth, and in this way he proclaimed  [the Tao of] Three-and-Five in order to save the common folks.” 9 It is easy to get bewildered by the array of emblematic numbers, suggestive  correspondences and cryptic statements about Yin and Yang and their bear- ing on human self-cultivation and salvation, which culminates in the return  to the Great Ultimate (kuei t’ai-chi 歸太極) and to the True Origin (chen- yüan 真元). It is said for this reason that coagulating the own, individual  divine force (shen 神) results in magic capacities (ling 靈), and assembling or  refining the vital energies (ch’i 氣) results [in attaining] the treasure ( pao 寶). 10  The subsequent equation still surpasses the two statements, saying that the  divine force is being itself (hsing 性), and the vital energy is the very exist- ence (ming 命). 11 We understand that Chang Yü-ch’u displays basic tenets of Heavenly Mas- ters Taoism and its ritual speciality that is called Thunder Magic (五雷法).  The patriarch postulated in his tract Comprehensive Discussions of the Trans- mission of Rituals (Shou-fa p’u-shuo 授法普說) that in the  kalpa Lung-han  (龍漢劫) Lord Tao received from the [Heavenly Worthy of] Prime Origin (元 始[天尊]) the Tao of the subtle mysteries of Pure Tenuity (Ch’ing-wei miao-  8 No. five stands for the centre. Thunder and thunderclaps (lei-t’ing 雷霆) hold the  central energies of heaven and earth. Their appropriate name is: Five Thunders (wu-lei  五雷). As the circuit of the East reaches from jen-tzu 壬子 to keng-shen 庚申 it covers nine  steps or stations which explains the number nine. The related theories are delicate and cul- minate in the insight that Three-and-One mean the same as Nine-and-Five, each express- ing the essential Tao of Thunder and thunderclaps (lei-t’ing chih yao-tao 雷霆之要道),  see Chang Shan-yüan 張善渊, General Discussion of All Methods (Wan-fa t’ung-lun  萬法通論), in TT 1220: 67.3 a–4 a.

Reiter hsüan chih tao 清微妙玄之道), which was passed on to Lord Lao whereupon  an internal heavenly transmission evolved, reaching the deities Ling-pao  t’ien-tsun 靈寶天尊 and Miao-hua t’ien-ti 妙化天帝. It occurred thereafter  that T’ai-shang [Lao-chün] 太上[老君] entrusted “my ancestor, the Heavenly  Master of the Han” (吾祖漢天師) with the Tao of the subtle mysteries of Pure  Tenuity. These subtle mysteries were orally transmitted (k’ou-k’ou hsiang- ch’uan 口口相傳) and finally came to establish the Orthodox Line of Ch’ing- wei [Taoism] (清微正宗). 12 The female deity with the grand religious title, Pa- triarchal Ruler of Origin in Complete Radiance, Superior Assistant of Prime  Origin (Yüan-shang shih-ch’en i-hui tsu yüan-chün 元上侍宸一輝祖元君)  allegedly lived in the world during the T’ang period with the personal proper  name Tsu Shu 祖舒. She is said to have brought together the various branches  of Taoism (hui-tao 會道) and rearranged its unity. 13 A short and anonymous tract of Ch’ing-wei provenance entitled Discus- sions of the Mysteries of the Thunders (Lei-ao pi-lun 雷奧祕論) and most likely  predating the Hsien-ch’üan chi of Chang Yü-ch’u, made similar statements  about the origin of Taoism. 14 Again, the Discussions of the Mysteries use the  name Ch’ing-wei in order to identify the Shen-hsiao ritual tradition. The text  Discussions of the Mysteries also tell us that Ch’ing-wei is not just one method  amongst many other methods. We learn that Tao is the ancestor of all rituals  but Ch’ing-wei, and by implication Shen-hsiao are the most subtle rituals that  Tao had ever set forth. Accordingly, the Thunder deities are the honourable  ones in the spheres of the Thunders. We are also told that the complete vital  forces and energies of the Heavenly Worthy of Prime Origin would be present  in Thunder rituals, which certainly wants to explain the omnipotence of such  rituals that allegedly control any other spiritual or divine forces. 15 Following these canonical sources we may be tempted to think that Thun- der Magic or Thunder rituals constitute the very kernel of religious Taoism.  We know that this is not the case. The extant scholarly studies of the Shang- ch’ing 上清 and Ling-pao 靈寶 scriptures show a quite different picture of  12 TT 1311: 7.13 a; Ch’ing-wei represented at the time of Chang Yü-ch’u the exorcist  rituals ( fa 法) in Cheng-i Taoism. 13 Compare TT 171 Ch’ing-wei hsien-p’u 11 b (hui-tao 會道) which lists an even more  extended title for Tsu Shu that contains all the elements that Chang Yü-ch’u presented.  See TT 1220: 2.7 b–8 a, with a variant title. 14 TT 222 Ch’ing-wei shen-lieh pi-fa dates from the 14th ct., TT 1311 Hsien-ch’üan  chi is dated 1407. F. C. Reiter in: K. Schipper/F.

We do not have any historic information about Tsu Shu. 15 TT 222: 1.1 a–2 b (Lei-ao pi-lun). See the story of Wang Shan 王善 and Sa Shou-chien  薩守堅 (fl. 12th century).

On the other hand, we notice that Taoist hagiographic col- lections reveal a dense presence of exorcist rituals that work perfectly for the  well-being of Taoists and common folks alike. 16 Eventually, even imperial  courts resorted to the help of Taoists who performed rituals to weed out  demonic plagues, to take care of weather conditions and cause some other  miracles. Such rituals came to be labelled Thunder Magic by the 12th century  when Taoist specialists like Wang Wen-ch’ing served at the court of emperor  Sung Hui-tsung 宋徽宗 (r. 1100–1126). The performances of Thunder Magic  rituals at that time appear to have been independent of large scale ritual of- ferings (chiao 醮) that involve lots of people. Our sources for the study of  Thunder Magic in literary collections of the 14th–15th centuries, especially in  Tao-fa hui-yüan 道法會元 (A Corpus of Taoist Rituals), often demand that  the respective rituals are performed in seclusion, and the ritual specialist  would be all alone on his own heeding absolute secrecy. 17 Chang Yü-ch’u claims that Ch’ing-wei or Shen-hsiao rituals are part of  the ritual tradition that his ancestor patriarch Chang Tao-ling 張道陵 had  started in the Han-dynasty, following his divine instalment as Heavenly  Master. It is important to keep in mind the statement of Chang Yü-ch’u that  “these subtle mysteries were orally transmitted”, which reminds us of the  fact that Thunder rituals are not connected with a corpus of scriptures that  could compare in any way with the already mentioned Shang-ch’ing and  Ling-pao traditions. 18 Chang Yü-ch’u clearly points out the great impor- tance of oral instructions (k’ou-chüeh 口訣) and secret traditions, which is  a familiar feature in ritual texts and in instructions for practices of internal  alchemy (nei-tan 內丹). Now, what approach is suitable to describe the prac- tical workings of historic Thunder Magic or Thunder rituals? Which clues  do we find to understand the ritual speciality of Thunder Magic? Thunder Magic: Illustrated with the Divine Protector  Chao Kung-ming Attending rituals of the type “prayers for peace and honours for the con- stellations” (ch’i-an li-tou 祈安禮斗) in present day Taiwan, just to give an  example, we realize that major deities of the temporary ritual stage (tao- ch’ang 道場) are astral divinities that also have rank and function in various  16 TT 296 Li-shih chen-hsien t’i-tao t’ung-chien and the subsequent titles. 17 F.

Reiter Thunder rituals, which the canonical sources document. 19 However, rituals  of the type “prayers for peace and honours for the constellations” have a  specific ritual set up and are definitely not understood to be Thunder ritu- als. 20 And yet, one of the deities that usually have a shrine at the ritual stage  is the renowned Thunder deity Chao Kung-ming 趙公明. The scrolls that  are used at the rituals show him as a bearded warrior and protective deity  who stands guard at the outer fringe of the ritual stage. 21 We can better ap- preciate the arrangement if we consider the veneration of Chao Kung-ming  in historic Thunder Magic which A Corpus of Taoist Rituals documents. He  is presented in the canonical texts as Generalissimo Chao yüan-shuai 趙元帥  with the religious title Cheng-i hsüan-t’an 正一玄壇. 22 The rather telling  name happens to introduce fine instructions concerning Chao Kung-ming  in Secret Rituals of Cheng-i hsüan-t’an, the Generalissimo Chao yüan-shuai  正一玄壇趙元帥祕法. The Secret Rituals contain the following entry 23: (p. 1 a) Report on the Generalissimo Chao [Kung-ming] The Generalissimo has the surname Chao and the personal name Lang 朗  (“bright”), another name being Ch’ang 昶. His style was Kung-ming, and  he hailed from Mount Chung-nan shan 終南山. In the time of the Ch’in 秦  he kept away from his contemporaries and [hiding] in the mountains he em- barked on a subtle self-cultivation to reach Tao. When his merits and suc- cess were complete, the Jade Emperor issued a decree to install him as Vice  Commander of Shen-hsiao [Heaven] 神霄副帥. Examining the Generalissimo,  [we find that] he is the incarnation (hua-sheng 化生) of Brahma breaths that  traverse the heavens, quickly enlighten Chaos and belong to the Empyrean  with the Bright Halls (hao-t’ing hsiao tu-t’ien hui-chüeh hun-fan ch’i 皓庭霄 度天慧覺昏梵氣). His position is in ch’ien 乾, which is the emblem for the vital  energies of the combination of metal and water. The colours of his clothes, the  19 Concerning the ritual li-tou, see, for example, TT 606 Nan-yüeh tsung-sheng chi 7 a,  speaking about Liu Yüan-ching 劉元靖 who practices a ritual li-tou pu-kang 禮斗步罡 to  expel wild beasts (“tigers“, et al.).

Chao Kung-ming was  also venerated as divine protector against pestilence, see below and note 128. 22 This may mean: Black Altar of Orthodoxy and Unity. See TT 1220: 36.4 b, where the  title hsüan-t’an refers to Magic Agent Ma (Cheng-i ling-kuan Ma yüan-shuai 正一靈官馬 元帥). The title came to refer to the altars of the deified Heavenly Master of the Han. 23 TT 1220: 232.1 a–2 b.

His face is black. His moustache and  beard are the breaths of the North. He rides a tiger which is the symbol of  metal. Therefore, this [description] compares well with the phrase &lt;metal is  the centre of water&gt;. His bodily essence (t’i 體) has Tao 道, and its application  ( yung 用) (p. 1 b) materializes in the rituals ( fa 法). As to rituals, if they are not  [operating] the Thunders and thunderclaps (lei-t’ing 雷霆) they do not have  any means to make their might manifest. The department [of Thunders and  thunderclaps] is at the Western Platform T’ai-hua 太華西臺, 24 and the Gener- alissimo is in charge of it. He [also] uses the appellation Golden Wheel (Chin- lun 金輪), which again is a symbol of the West and metal. 25 The Generalissimo [Chao Kung-ming] respectfully received the order from  the Gate of Heaven to keep in order  26 and put to service the three realms, to  patrol and inspect the five directions, and to supervise the nine provinces [of  China] being the Great General for Palace Maintenance and Attending Censor  of the Utmost North (Chih-tien ta chiang-chün pei-chi shih yü-shih 直殿大將 軍北極侍御史). When the Han ancestral Heavenly Master [Chang Tao-ling] elaborated the  great elixir (ta-tan 大丹), he had a divinity soar up [to heaven] with a petition  for the God-emperors, asking them for a mighty and fierce divine emissary  who would give him protection all around. Thereupon the Generalissimo re- spectfully received the decree from the Jade [Emperor] to fulfil the function  of Generalissimo at the Heavenly Altars of Orthodoxy and Unity 正一玄壇元 帥. “Orthodoxy” (cheng 正) means that any wicked elements (wan-hsieh 萬邪) 27  do not interfere. “One” (i 一) means unity, one entity (t’ung-i 統一), and there  are not two of them. Therefore, the duty and the job of [Chao] Hsüan-t’an are  exceedingly important. Since the Heavenly Master ascended to heaven [Chao Kung-ming, Hsüan- t’an,] is eternally guarding the Mountain Lung-hu shan 龍虎山. 28 Today, at  rituals of salvation under the patronage of the Three Primordial Ones (san- yüan k’ai-t’an ch’uan-tu 三元開壇傳度) (p. 2 a) the Generalissimo controls all  those who strive to do well, establish merits and repent mistakes, and [also]  those who are stupid, sinister and do not improve their ways. Therefore, there  is the one office at Mount Lung-hu shan, where [Chao] Hsüan-t’an ensures  that the [appropriate] rewards and punishments are realized.  His staff comprises the fierce generals of the eight kings 八王猛將 who cor- respond with the eight trigrams ( pa-kua 八卦). There are six poisonous great  24 For a similar concept see TT 99 Chiu-t’ien ying-yüan lei-shen p’u-hua t’ien-tsun  yü-shu pao-ching chi-chu 1.12 b. 25 “Metal“ is one of the five elements (wu-hsing 五行). 26 Compare TT 1476: 4.10 b. 27 This could also refer to unorthodox teachings or masters that are called hsieh-men  邪門. 28 Mount Lung-hu in Kiangsi province was home for the patriarchal Chang family.

Reiter divinities, who correspond with the killing breaths (sha 煞) of heaven, of earth,  of the year, the months, the days, and the seasons. The Thunder divinites (lei- shen 雷神) of the five directions and the fierce troops of the five directions are  present, corresponding with the five elements (wu-hsing 五行). The twenty  eight generals correspond with the twenty eight stellar divisions (erh-shih-pa  hsiu 二十八宿). The two Generals [named] Harmony of Heaven and Union  of Earth (t’ien-ho ti-ho erh-chiang 天和地合二将) represent the opening and  closing of the Gate of Heaven and the Window of Earth. The two Fortifying  Generals of Water and Fire (shui-huo ying erh-chiang 水火营二將) represent  the cyclic recurrence of birth in spring and killing in autumn. 29 Discharging  Thunders and employing lightning, causing rain to come and calling in the  wind, expelling epidemics and cutting down wicked spirits, containing ill- nesses and praying when catastrophes occur, all the merits of Generalissimo  [Chao Kung-ming] just cannot be bigger than that. His merits extend to the  case that someone faces a lawsuit and is unfairly oppressed, and the divinity  can cause the case to be resolved. Just commercial endeavours and any other  striving for property and profit (p. 2 b) must be harmonious and based on con- sent. Only absolutely just and correct activities can be explained vis-à-vis the  divinity and the respective prayers will be fulfilled as wished. If one prays for  matters that are useless and not correct, the divinity will certainly hand down  punishment. Do venerate the divinity without remiss! We note that Chao Kung-ming is said to have been a divine entity, incorpo- rating and embodying Brahma breaths. He lived on earth, evaded the Ch’in  (秦) administration and accomplished Taoist self-cultivation. Chao Kung- ming showed virtues and abilities which later gave him access to a career in  the divine, transcendent establishment. It is easy to find similar careers that  combine worldly and divine forms of existence. There is, for example, the  career of the Thunder divinity with the proper name Teng Po-wen 鄧伯溫  who helped Huang-ti 皇帝 to defeat Ch’ih Yu 蚩尤. Teng Po-wen eventually  ascended to heaven and became the martial Great Divinity of Blazing Fire  (Yen-huo ta-shen 焱火大神). Blazing Fire was the major divinity that Wang  Wen-ch’ing presented in his expositions concerning Thunder Magic. 30 Generally speaking, the canonical sources for Thunder rituals define the  abstract divine force throughout the world and cosmos in terms of Thun- der divinities (lei-shen 雷神). The respective rituals fulfil a wide range of  exorcist tasks. The cure of illness, the protection against injustice at court  or catastrophes in nature, notably epidemics and droughts, are typical tasks  for Thunder rituals. The various Thunder rituals address and dispatch such  Thunder divinities to execute specific orders. The divinities have martial  ranks and appearances, being generals, emissaries or troops.

The same,  of course, can be said about the Great Divinity of Blazing Fire that reput- edly meets a comparable range of duty but represents a different string of  Thunder Magic traditions. A Corpus of Taoist Rituals contains a large number of different traditions  and practices of Thunder rituals. Each of these traditions claims to represent  the totality of ritual efficacy and spiritual legitimacy. It does not come as a  surprise that there are different ritual traditions which have Chao Kung- ming as divine patron. The differences may have resulted from divergent  regional origins and transmissions which the Preface to the Great Rituals of  Cheng-i lung-hu hsüan-t’an (正一龍虎玄壇大法序) seems to show 31: (p. 1 a) Formerly, the Heavenly Master of the Han concocted the great elixir at  Mount P’o-yang shan 鄱陽山. 32 When he had completed the elixir but did not  yet consume it, he sealed and enclosed the elixir in the furnace. Suddenly one  day there was a Mountain-deity (shan-shen 山神) who stole and consumed the  elixir, and made it known what he had got. The Heavenly Master became very  angry and performed a ritual to employ and summon heavenly divinities to  behead the Mountain-deity. However, the head [of the Mountain-deity] grew  anew, and so the Heavenly master addressed him saying: &lt;This is not due to  your strength but it is the merit of my divine elixir&gt;. He then obliged by oath  the Mountain-deity to live as an inferior demon for eternity. Today a blood  eating type [of demon] has the special designation Great King Whose Head  Sprang Up [Again] (Yung-t’ou ta-wang 湧頭大王), which means exactly this  deity. When the Heavenly Master passed again Kuei-hsi 貴溪 33 in Hsin-chou  信州 34 he saw rock walls and cliffs that were precious and absolutely marvel- lous. He therefore said to his disciple, the perfected Wang [Chen] 王 [真] 35:  31 TT 1220: 236.1 a–2 a. The text on Chao Kung-ming in TT 1220: 232.1 a–2 b did not  give any geographic indications concerning his worldly life. 32 Since the T’ang period mountain P’o-yang shan is the name of an island in lake P’o- yang (Kiangsi). Earlier names for the mountain are Mount Stalwart (Li-shih shan 力士山)  which in terms of feng-shui (風水) could indicate an auxiliary function of the island vis- à-vis Mount Lu, the dominant Mountain in the area. Another name is Mount Rock Seal  (Shih-yin shan 石印山), which again is suggestive, see Chung-kuo ku-chin ti-ming ta tz’u- tien. Taipei 1972, p. 1203c.

Examining carefully the fraud which he  had suffered earlier, 36 the Heavenly Master had a divinity soar up [to heaven]  to explain the situation vis-à-vis the Perfected King of Shen-hsiao [Heaven]  神霄真王. [The Perfected King] then sent the Assistant Escort Guard and  Great Divinity (I-wei ta-shen 翊衛大神) Chao Kung-ming to lead on all the  twenty eight generals, the fierce emissaries of the eight kings, the troops of  the Divinities of the Five Thunders (Wu-lei shen 五雷神) and others in order  to keep guard at and protect the area of the altar [of the Heavenly Master].  Consequently, [the Heavenly Master] was successful [in elaborating the elixir  a second time]. The Heavenly Master said to his disciple: &lt;When I consume  my elixir, I can conveniently ascend [to heaven] but I do not have [achieved]  any merits for the people. Some other day when I would again serve the Three  Pure Ones would I not be ashamed of myself?&gt; Thereupon he took his disciple  along the way to enter the region of Shu 蜀 where he received orders from the  supreme God-emperors to battle the demons at Mount Ch’ing-ch’eng shan  青城山. He established the Halls of Blessings ( fu-t’ing 福庭) and the twenty  four administrative centres (chih 治). 37 Later, [the Heavenly Master] received  the order from the God-emperors to ascend [to heaven] in bright day light.  After this event, the title of honour [of Chao Kung-ming] was Lung-hu hsüan- t’an 龍虎玄壇. 38 For all ages he supports and assists ritual performances 39 and  attacks and kills the wicked goblins ( yao-mo 妖魔) in the world. This really  began since his time at Mount Lung-hu shan. The Heavenly Master, however, had taken a stone box that he sealed and hid  (p. 2 a) in the Cave Meditating-Perfection (Ssu-chen tung 思真洞) at Mount  Kuei-ku shan 鬼谷山. Later, a Taoist initiate ( feng-fa chih shih 奉法之士) hap- pened to encounter the Heavenly Master who in a dream entrusted to that  Taoist initiate [the stone box], and consequently this transmission is current  in the world. 40 36 We add: “at the hands of the mountain-deity“. 37 The religious institutions chih (治) are connected with temples. F. C. Reiter 1990,  pp. 107–117 (referring to TT 1139 San-tung chu-nang 7.1 a–15 a). The standard source is:  TT 599 Tung-t’ien fu-ti yüeh-tu ming-shan chi, dat. 901. See: F. C. Reiter in: K.  Schipper/  F. Verellen 2004, p. 423. 38 The Chinese diction is ambiguous. The title could refer to the Heavenly Master  which, however, does not make sense in the light of the following statements. See TT 1220:  236.2 b for the religious title of the Leading Marshal (chu-shuai 主帥) Chao Kung-ming. 39 Hsing-ch’ih 行持 is an opaque term that can also point to internal self-cultivation  which precedes any further ritual activities in terms of Thunder Magic, see TT 1220:  69.11 a–14 a (Wang Shih-ch’en ch’i-tao pa-tuan chin 王侍宸祈禱八段錦). See F. C. Reiter  2007 a, pp. 24, 27, 114, and note 125. 40 We may suppose that the box contained the elixir that the Heavenly Master had not  yet eaten while remaining in the world. The story makes better sense if the box contained  the instructions for the current Thunder rituals. </page> <page sequence="11">  Taoist Thunder Magic (五雷法) 131 The [spirit] generals and emissaries [who are at the command] of General- issimo [Chao Kung-ming] are mighty, heroic and absolutely fierce. They let  clouds appear and rain fall. They revive what had been torched and dried out.  Secondly, they crusade against temples ( fa-miao 伐廟), put wicked elements to  death, and sweep off cruel and monstrous beings. 41 Their other [activities like]  the petitions for the administration to dissolve lawsuits [at court], the arrest  of thieves and the pursuit of hun-souls (魂) have splendid results that &lt;turn  heaven and cover earth&gt;. They have the power to dam the seas and shift moun- tains. Their divine merits spread out in a gigantic way, which any written and  oral reports can hardly cover. Whoever gets [a hold of these methods] must keep them completely secret.  I have diligently told the whole story and reported it at the very beginning of  the compilation [of the Great Rituals] in order to inform the coming genera- tions. The Preface was respectfully written by Chan-jan tzu, 42 the Heir of the  Ritual Tradition of The Origin of Immortals 仙源嗣法湛然子. An Example of the Application of Thunder Magic The Report and the Preface focus very much on the activities of the Heavenly  Master Chang Tao-ling and in this context connect Chao Kung-ming with  Cheng-i Taoism which is a most important matter. The initial lines of the  Preface introduce Chao Kung-ming as a divine and martial authority. We  learn that he commands omnipotent spirit forces. The Report and Preface  actually introduce different registers of Thunder divinities in chapters 232  and 236 of A Corpus of Taoist Rituals, but they all put Chao Kung-ming in a  prominent position. In each case, a divine patron (chu-fa 主法) holds the very  first rank and presides over the rituals. 43 Chao Kung-ming always holds the  next position of Leading General (chu-chiang 主將) or Leading Marshal (chu- shuai 主帥). He has extended titles of honour that indicate his vast range of  competence. 44 The following lists of divine forces reflect the structure of his  spirit troops which comprise the fierce generals of the eight kings 八王猛將  and, to give one more example, the Twenty Eight Generals 二十八將. 45 41 These are basic occupations for Thunder specialists. See: F. C. Reiter 2007 a,  pp. 54 sq., 109 sq. 42 Unfortunately we could not identify the name of honour. 43 This is the deified Heavenly Master of the Han, Chang Tao-ling 張道陵, see below  “The World of Thunder Divinities”. 44 We note that his divine title in 正一龍虎玄壇大法序 (TT 1220: 236.2 b) is more elabo- rate than in 正一玄壇趙元帥祕法 (TT 1220: 232.2 b–3 a) and very likely postdates chap- ter 232. Ch. 232 indicates the birthday of the divinity: 15th day of the 3rd month which  TT 1476 Sou-shen chi 4.10 a–11 b repeats as already stated. 45 TT 1220: 232.2 a, corresponding with the eight trigrams and twenty eight stellar  divisions. </page> <page sequence="12"> 132 Florian C. Reiter The Preface finally notes the competence of the spirit troops of Chao  Kung-ming and states at which occasion the Thunder deities may be sum- moned to help. We certainly would like to see how this could be realised.  Illnesses and epidemics are the most common molestation in human life,  and therefore we present as a fine example the Method to Control Epidemics  (Chih wen-i fa 治瘟疫法) 46: (p. 19 b) In all cases when an epidemic has to be brought under control, and  you enter the house of an ill person you first use the &lt;method of conceal- ing [yourself]&gt; (chao-fa 罩法). 47 When you [prepare to] enter the door of the  house, you first order the [spirit-] generals to enter the door. You turn your  left hand towards your body, drawing back the thumb and the four fingers  pointing upwards. The right hand opens and has the five fingers absolutely  relaxed. You have the doors and windows closed and obstructed. The poem  Deputing the Generals to Clutch and Arrest (Wei chiang ch’in-chuo shih 委將 擒捉诗) says: (p. 20 a) &lt;Let the fire penetrate, and all the heavens will shine red.  Generalissimo and your divine forces be omnipresent. Black clouds and black  mist cut off the trails of demons and divinities&gt;. In this method you behold  your own body as a tree that had dried out for one thousand years, or as wood  that had dried out for ten thousand years. You put forth the mûdras Five-Fires  (Wu-huo chüeh 五火訣), [meaning the] Heavenly Fire which begins at yin 寅,  since fire is born at yin. The Earthly fire, [is born at] mao 卯. The Fire of the  Thunderclaps, [is born at] ch’en 辰. The Fire of the Sun, [is born at] ssu 巳. The  Perfected-Fire-of-Samâdhi in-the-Cave halts at wu 午, which says that fire  flourishes at wu. Obviously, the five types of cosmic fires extinguish any epidemics when the  five positions or patterns are consecutively pointed out and impressed on  the palm. The cosmic fires are procured by the five mûdras representing the  five earthly branches (ti-chih 地支) that were just indicated. And yet, there is  still another step that can be made in order to avert the recurrence of the re- spective epidemic, and this is the Method of Controlling Epidemics and Cut- ting off Later [Recurrences] (Chih-wen tuan-hou chih fa 治瘟斷後之法) 48: (p. 20 a) You visualize that the five fires burn your body to ashes. You raise  the wind of [the direction] sun 巽 and blow it over the ashes just to see two  [black] dots within the ashes. The two dots combine to become the infant that  gradually grows up to become adult and to be exactly the Perfected One of  the Own Life (Pen-ming chen-jen 本命真人). Your both hands start forming  the White Crane mûdra (Pai-hao chüeh 白鶴訣), (p. 20 b) and you hide them  in your sleeves. You squat down on the earth with the two hands relaxed and  46 TT 1220: 232.19 b–20 a. 47 See below, TT 1220: 232.21 a (Chao-fa 罩法). This refers to the protective veil of heav- enly light that enshrouds the Taoist healer, see below. Also compare TT 1220: 198.13 b. 48 TT 1220: 232.20 a–21 a. </page> <page sequence="13">  Taoist Thunder Magic (五雷法) 133 open. Visualize that your body rides a white crane that flies away through  the clouds. You put forth the Five-Times-Black mûdra. The five fingers are  tightly clutched together and you must not relax them. 49 If your attitude is in  a way remiss, you do not cut off the trails [of the demons]. Take the breaths of  the black killer (hei-sha chih ch’i 黑殺之氣) and let them move upwards from  the two passes of your spine [to reach] your brains. Afterwards you visual- ize that the black breaths move to obstruct, and starting from the fringe of  the hair drizzling mist and blurring darkness are all around. Your right hand  forms the Sword mûdra (chien-chüeh 劍訣) that you point towards your body.  Thereafter you make one horizontal movement [with the hand] demarking an  interruption that transforms into the Ch’ang-chiang 長江 with a length of ten  thousand miles. Demons, divinities, men and creatures cannot cross it at all. 50  Your body bends the two knees as to ride on a white crane that soars up into  empty space and disappears. On your way back you see from afar the site of  the altar in the house [of the ill person]. You display the Golden Bridge mûdra  (chin-ch’iao chüeh 金橋訣) that all the way points towards (p. 21 a) the site of  the altar in that house. You visualize yourself riding the white crane that fol- lows the Golden Bridge [mûdra] and so you return to the site of the altar. You  thank your teacher masters and quit. The Method of Concealing [Oneself] (Chao-fa 罩法) is subsequently ap- pended: (p. 21 a) Heavenly web conceal. Earthly web conceal. Urgently conceal, speed- ily conceal, rumbling thunders and lightning do conceal! You visualize that  your whole person (ch’üan-shen 全身) faces the Gate of Heaven that lets golden  radiance come down to conceal your body, and then you recite the three sen- tences just stated. 51 We did not translate, for the sake of brevity, the abundant instructions  for the mûdras in the three texts Method to Control Epidemics, Method of  Controlling Epidemics and Cutting off Later [Recurrences], and Method of  Concealing [Oneself]. Meditative visions, recitations and mûdras combine  to constitute the ritual effort. The Taoist produces the cosmic fires on his  palm to dispatch them and cut off the tracks that wicked spirits may follow  to cause epidemics. 52 49 The commentary speaks about the gestures of the left hand only. 50 This movement ensures the banishment of demons and bars the recurrence of the  respective illness. 51 TT 1220: 232.21 a. Compare note 47. 52 The transformation into a divinity is implied as in all rituals, see the instructions in  TT 1220: 232.5 b–6 a. </page> <page sequence="14"> 134 Florian C. Reiter The Spiritual Standing of the Priest The spiritual standing of the performing priest is the crucial aspect to qual- ify Thunder Magic as proper part of the Taoist profession. How do the ca- nonical sources understand and describe the actual status of the perform- ing priest? Studying numerous paragraphs with the titles Summoning and  Uniting (chao-ho 召合), Transformation into a Divinity ( pien-shen 變神) or  Assembling the Divine Force (Lien-shen 鍊神) 53 we understand the religious  meaning of the divine potential that human life is endowed with. The Taoist  realizes and sets to use his divine potential in Thunder rituals, which the  following statements document 54: (p. 5 b) The Practical Application of Summoning and Uniting First you recite the Spell Triple Purity (San-ching chou 三淨咒), then recite the  Spell Purifying Heaven and Earth (Ching t’ien-ti chou 淨天地咒). Your left hand  forms the mûdra Seal of the Dipper (tou-yin 斗印). Your right hand forms the  mûdra Sword (chien-chüeh 劍訣), and so you recite [the following magic spell]:   ... 55 The one breath is [now] complete all around in [your] three [spheres]. 56 You  wait until the water of the flowery pool fills up your mouth. You swallow the  water and recite (p. 6 a) the names of the seven p’o-souls (魄): &lt;... 57, quickly make  my physical body (wu hsing 吾形) invisible&gt;, and then you do the ritual [steps]  Soaring to tzu and wu ( fei tzu-wu tou 飛子午斗). You recite the Dipper Spell  (Tou-chou 斗咒) as to hide your body: &lt;I diligently implore you, divine agents  flying in the dipper, divine agents flying in the dipper – the Great Dipper may  conceal my body. All the evil forces must not discover my appearance. Speedily,  speedily do act as decreed&gt; ... do assist me turning divine to be the Perfected  One, the Patriarchal Heavenly Master (Tsu t’ien-shih chen-jen 祖天師真人). 58  You recite the Spell of the Palace Attendants (Kung-ts’ao chou 功曹咒): &lt;Heaven  is pure, Earth is at peace. Heaven and Earth do connect and unite. Palace At- tendants, let speedily appear your true apparitions. Speedily come forward to  the front side of the altar. There is a task that I depute you to care of.&gt; (p. 6 b)  Now, you think of the palace attendants as they arrive from the Northwest. 59 53 The word lien 鍊 means: to refine or sublimate. The process of refinement results in  assembling energetic potentials and forms the apparition of the divine alter-ego, and so  we translate “assemble”. Compare: H. A. Giles 1972, nr. 7152. 54 TT 1220: 232.5 b–6 b. F. C. Reiter 2007 a, pp. 19–32. 55 The magic spell is a line of eight unintelligible magic Chinese characters or pseudo- Sanskrit. 56 The three spheres of the body most likely are situated around the three cinnabar-fields. 57 We omit seven binominal names. 58 Compare TT 1220: 234.6 a (... ts’un-shen chu meng-wei chiang-fu cheng-i kuan ju  tsu t’ien-shih chuang 存身著盟威絳服正一冠如祖天師狀) which represents the deified  Chang Tao-ling. 59 Another spell follows that welcomes and organizes the arriving forces, led on by  Generalissimo Chao. </page> <page sequence="15">  Taoist Thunder Magic (五雷法) 135 The message is clear enough. The acting priest adopts the spiritual iden- tity with the Heavenly Master of the Han, having ritually hidden his pro- fane body with the connected body souls. The Taoist communicates with  the Thunder divinities on the basis of his transformed identity. 60 The con- nection with the Generalissimo Chao Kung-ming (religious title: Lei-t’ing  chu-shuai cheng-i lung-hu chin-lun ju-i chih-fa Chao yüan-shuai 雷霆主帥 正一龍虎金輪如意執法趙元帥) is well established in two other spells. Chao  Kung-ming leads on a large pantheon of Great Thunder Divinities, Thunder  generals and subordinate forces that arrive at the site of the ritual. 61 The spiritual identity of the priest and Thunder specialist varies in ac- cordance with the Thunder-register that he holds. The Sung-Taoist Wang  Wen-ch’ing, for example, promoted the adoption of the identity with the  Great Divinity of Blazing Fire 62: Assembling the Divine Force 63: (p. 2 a) Let the divine forces congeal and sit quietly in meditation. Concentrate  on the one most shining point in the Kidney Palace. Within a short moment fire  arises, gradually engulfing the own body all around. Blow out one mouthful of  breath, and the ashes are altogether blown away. Concentrate on the breaths in  the five colours of the five directions which mix and combine to shape one united  aura of radiant shining in purple and golden colours, and this transforms itself  into an infant that gradually grows big. [The apparition] shows the beak of a  phoenix, silver teeth, red hair and a body like a quail. Both eyes let fiery shining  penetrate [a distance] of ten thousand chang 丈. Both wings also have [the shin- ing of] fire. A head with eyes emerges on both forelegs, and they also emit fiery  shining. The belt has the colour of gold. The left hand clutches a fire auger, and  the right hand clutches a mallet with eight angles. There is a fiery dragon around  the body. Thereupon, concentrate your vision on this Divine General of the Five  Thunders. His head touches the heaven, and [he himself] is standing on the earth.  Fiery clouds close around him and wrap up his divine and fierce might of blazing  fire. This is Blazing Fire, the Heavenly Lord Teng (Teng t’ien-chün 鄧天君) who  is the ruling and commanding divinity in the system of fire chariots. 64 60 TT 1220: 232.6 a. 61 TT 1220: 232.6 b–7 b. 62 F.

Reiter The five colours and the five directions all refer to the internal bodily spheres  and the viscera. The transformation into the divinity Blazing Fire is realized  through a specialized and practical application of internal alchemy. We com- plement the picture and present the following statements of the tract Subtle  Application (miao-yung 妙用) in the collection Cheng-i lung-hu hsüan-t’an  chin-lun chih-fa ju-i pi-fa 正一龍虎玄壇金輪執法如意祕法. The title shows  a variant name of honour of Generalissimo Chao Kung-ming 65: (p. 12 a) ... you must first purify your heart and fix all your considerations, and  being perfectly motionless you become one body with Great Void. In a little  while some sentiment is present that you direct towards the Southeast (hsün  巽). You let flare up nine times the radiance of your eyes [towards that direc- tion]. In your thoughts the wind, the clouds, thunders, rain and lightning start  at once and equally manifesting themselves. The Wind Elder ( feng-po 風伯), the  Rain Master ( yü-shih 雨師), the Thunder Lord (lei-kung 雷公), the Mother of  Lightning (tien-mu 電母), and the God of the Clouds ( yün-shen 雲神), they all  enter my heart, my liver, my spleen, my lungs and kidneys. I let the fire of my  heart (hsin-huo 心火) descend and unite with the water of the kidneys. These  five divinities transform then to become five times Hsüan-t’an (玄壇). 66 Concen- trate your meditation on the Southeast and the Jade Department of Shen-hsiao  Heaven (shen-hsiao yü-fu 神霄玉府) where the Generalissimo [resides]. The  colours of his garments become clearly discernible. A black tiger crouches in  front of him. A second time you cause the breaths of your kidney palace to rise  (p. 12 b) and unite with the fire of the heart. They form one part of purple and  black clouds that depart from you through your left eye and rush straightaway  towards the East. You see face to face the Generalissimo who shows an imposing  rage. Heaven is blurred and earth is black [all around]. The Generalissimo rides  the killing breaths (sha-ch’i 煞氣) to descend and enter the centre of your heart.  The six divinities 67 mix and unite as to become one divinity who resides in the  central palace (chung-kung 中宮) [of your body]. The kidney palace houses  the black tiger that mounts the water of the kidneys to ascend. The Generalis- simo just rides that tiger. The ritual master ( fa-shih 法師) uses one thrust [of his  hands forming] the killing-mûdra (sha-chüeh 煞訣) to order [the Generalissimo]  to come forth and be present at the front side of the altar [where he awaits his]  deployment as needed in the course [of the ritual]. It is your task that you are  utmost sincere, and so the response [of the ritual] will be extraordinary. 65 Compare above. See TT 1220: 234.12 a–12 b. 66 Hsüan-t’an indicates five simultaneous bodily apparitions of Chao Hsüan-t’an  (Kung-ming) that unite with the sixth apparition of the cosmic Generalissimo Chao  Kung-ming. Compare TT 1220: 232.8 a, which shows the same indication referring to  an internal reality and vision. Compare the spell Hsüan-t’an shih-chou (玄壇誓咒) in  TT 1220: 232.11 b–12 a. 67 See above. These are the five Generalissimos that are already within the body, plus  the cosmic Generalissimo who just descended. This clearly shows the possible multiplicity  of divine entities and the ritual union of the external and internal identity of the divinity. </page> <page sequence="17">  Taoist Thunder Magic (五雷法) 137 The osmosis of man and the divine as represented by a specific deity is the  condition for any further ritual procedures. Another set of ritual instruc- tions that focus on Generalissimo Chao Kung-ming provide the following  information 68: (p. 7 b) You concentrate your meditation on the sound of Thunders that arises  terrifying at the Window of Earth. Concentrate in meditation on the General- issimo [Chao Kung-ming] who from the Gate of Heaven descends and stands  on the Window of Earth. In the following procedure you swallow down the  fire of the heart and let it unite and wed with the water of the kidneys in the  Central Palace. Concentrate your meditation on the ancestral breaths (tsu-ch’i  祖氣) that rise upwards following the spine, up to the Mud Pill Palace (Ni-wan  kung 泥丸宮) where they visit the God-emperor of Shen-hsiao Heaven (Shen- hsiao ti-chün 神霄帝君). 69 You expel then these breaths that resemble a pearl  of fire that is really big and appears to have the shape of a wheel of fire. You  apply the Sword mûdra (chien-chüeh 劍訣) to cut open [the pearl of fire], and  you see a blaze of fire peeling off which unites the Generalissimo who is stand- ing on the Window of Earth with (p. 8 a) your own, personal Generalissimo  (tzu-chi yüan-shuai 自己元帥) as to become one entity. 70 You visualize that the  Generalissimo carries above his head a golden script with eight characters ... 71  The [eight] characters come forth separately and clearly, to be visible above  the incense altar. You can copy down the eight characters and use them as an  amulet. One half of [the amulet] is burnt in the incense burner. You apply the  other half of the amulet on yourself (tzu-fu 自服). 72 There are many texts that seem to be less demanding. They feature the spir- itual self-identification with the Heavenly Master of the Han, Chang Tao- ling, as to enable the priest to act ritually with the identity of the Heavenly  Master. The following text documents in this sense the intimate link be- tween Thunder rituals and Heavenly Masters Taoism 73: (p. 6 a) You visualize that your own body shows a likeness with the patriar- chal Heavenly Master ( ju tsu t’ien-shih chuang 如祖天師狀), [wearing] the red  garment of the Covenant and the cap of Orthodoxy and Unity (cheng-i kuan  68 TT 1220: 234.7 b–8 a (Cheng-i lung-hu hsüan-t’an chin-lun chih-fa ju-i pi-fa 正一龍 虎玄壇金輪執法如意祕法). The translation begins right after the spell in pseudo-Sanskrit. 69 Here, the divine empyrean is the Ni-wan Palace. 70 This means the union of the cosmic Generalissimo with the internal, bodily Gen- eralissimo. 71 We omit the pseudo-Sanskrit. 72 Tzu-fu 自服 may mean that one part of the amulet is consumed by burning it and  swallowing the ashes in amulet-water. However, any other practical application also  seems to be  feasible. 73 TT 1220: 234.6 a–6 b. </page> <page sequence="18"> 138 Florian C. Reiter 正一冠). The two perfected ones, Wang [Chen] 王[真] and Chao [Sheng] 趙[昇] 74  are on your side, serving and protecting you. You inhale one draw of Brahma  breaths of Shen-hsiao Heaven (shen-hsiao fan-ch’i 神霄梵氣) and let it return  to your heart where the breaths mix and unite. Exhale them, and they appear as  clouds and vapours that conceal your body. Visualize how they oscillate either  as light clouds tinged in red colours or as heavy fog. Visualize the four divine  creatures (ssu-ling 四靈) that keep guard all around you. Your two hands start  showing the two mûdras Yin-Dipper and Yang-Dipper ( yin-yang tou 陰陽斗)  as to conceal your body. Your left hand shows then the mûdra Jade-pattern  ( yü-wen 玉文), and the right hand the Sword-mûdra (chien-chüeh 劍訣). In- ternally reciting you speak the summons: &lt;I respectfully receive the decree and order from the Perfected King [in  Shen-hsiao Heaven] ([Shen-hsiao] chen-wang [神霄]真王) 75 and the true amu- lets of the Jade emperor ( yü-ti chen-fu 玉帝真符) and pass on the message  to the patron Hsüan-t’an (Hsüan–t’an chu 玄壇主). 76 I carry on my left belt  the huo-luo [-amulets] (豁落) 77 and on the right side the Shen-hsiao statutes  (Shen-hsiao yü-chang 神霄羽章). In the morning I recite the scriptures of  the most exalted immortals (t’ai-shang hsien-ching 太上仙經), and at night  I recite the precious writings that penetrate the mysteries (t’ung-hsüan pao- ch’ien 通玄寶芨).

This preparation precedes any Thunder rituals. The  Taoist attains the capacity to work out the desired results like the imprison- ment or annihilation of wicked demons, the expulsion of drought demons  and, eventually, the destruction of shrines where baleful spirits lodge, just to  name a few of them. 79 Whatever ritual services the faithful clients may have  demanded, the Thunder amulets were the decisive and final means to deploy  divine Thunder might and achieve the desired results. The Writing of Thunder Amulets as Culmination  of Thunder Rituals The practical tools of Thunder rituals vary greatly, but they most certainly  comprise mûdras, ritual steps, spells and amulets, the latter being the mate- rial and spiritual pledge of might of the Thunder specialist. Magic characters  may be visualized and copied down on paper or other materials, for example,  on iron plates to be used as amulets. We learnt that the turn of the brush can  count as a summons, while writing out an amulet. We concentrate our study  on amulets that have the form of graphic designs but keep in mind that magic  characters may be written with the sword on the ground, with the tongue on  the palate and even with the hand or the head being moved like an imaginary  writing brush, which results in invisible amulets. Following the documenta- tion in A Corpus of Taoist Rituals we can say that all the registers of Thun- der divinities, all the instructions and prayers finally culminate in detailed  descriptions of amulets, which describes the material evidence of Thunder  rituals. The amulets are presented in their dissolved form (san-hsing 散形) in  order to help the practitioner to memorize all the significant details and their  meaning. The combined form (chü-hsing 聚形) of the amulet finally shows  what the respective amulet should look like. 80 The emblematic nature of Chinese characters is omnipresent in reli- gious Taoism. 81 We are not surprised to find that A Corpus of Taoist Ritu- als presents the surname of Generalissimo Chao Kung-ming as a Thunder  amulet. The performing priest combines each stroke of the character chao 趙 with visions, with invocations and prayers. We read the religious identifica- tion of the graphic components of the character 趙 in their proper sequence,  doing justice to the dissolved form of the character or amulet. Our text gives  79 Compare the spell quoted above, TT 1220: 234.6b. 80 Concerning the drafting of amulets, see F. C. Reiter 2007b, pp. 190–198. 81 L.

Reiter key words only but hardly phrases any complete sentences. The title of the  paragraph reads: The Practical Application of the Character Chao (Chao tzu  tso-yung 趙字作用). Each single slash in the following translation demarks  the space where the unknown author puts in the individual, single strokes  of the character 趙 82: (p. 13 b) / True void – subtle and mysterious 微妙真空/ Lord Chao of Shen- hsiao Heaven 神霄趙公/ Discharge the Thunders, speedily like lightning  驅雷掣電/ Make fire go and wind blow 走火行風/ Fierce generals of the eight  kings 八王猛將 83/ Unlimited and divine omnipresence 無量神通/ Divine  troops, completely unite 神兵一合/ Fill all around the empty space 遍滿虛空/  Which divinities do not serve? 何神不伏 84/ Which demons dare to oppose?  何鬼敢衝/ Divine tiger, bite them [dead] at once 神虎一噉/ All demons have  their tracks extinguished 萬鬼滅蹤/ Orthodoxy and unity issue decrees and  summons 正一敕召/ Speedily descend into the central palace 速降中宮/ Kung- ming 公明 – I respectfully implore Chao Kung-ming to let descend his true  magic being, like fire that speedily. Urgently, urgently, this is like an order by  the venerable patriarch and Heavenly Master 謹請趙公明火速降真靈急急如老 祖天師律令. If we heed the proper sequence of the individual strokes of the character  chao 趙 85 and learn by heart the interspersed statements about their inner  meaning, we would write the surname Chao and at the same time address  the deity Chao Kung-ming. We would command him to descend with all  his divine might. We especially note that the divine rank of the acting priest  is called &lt;venerable patriarch and Heavenly Master&gt;. Having read the short  text The Practical Application of the Character Chao we understand that the  amulet &lt;character Chao 趙&gt; has a demon quelling capacity. The majority of  amulets are much more complicated. A magnificent example is the Personal  Amulet of Generalissimo Chao (Chao shuai pen-shen fu 趙帥本身符) that  shows the apparition of a fierce demon wielding an iron whip as his weapon.  There are legions of similar anthropomorphic Thunder amulets, and the  Personal Amulet of Generalissimo Chao is a representative example.

The drawing of the amulet shows the indication of a head and a  body with the big character ch’ih 敕 (decree) in its centre. The  amulet is to be drawn on the belly. Its graphic presentation may  be enriched with four characters that are written on the amulet,  and another two ritual characters are added above the head of  the Generalissimo Chao Kung-ming. We learn that the amulet is  used to heal illness, expel wicked influences, avert calamities,  dismiss law suits and bring about harmony. Again, we learn to  appreciate the fantastic usefulness of an amulet. Amulets cer- tainly crystallize all the divine might and spiritual engagement  of the performing priest. We know that in more recent times the superb and compli- TT 1220:  cated anthropomorphic amulets showing soaring and fierce dei- 233.11 a ties that often resemble bird-men were printed from wood blocks  on demand. The priest would seal and so consecrate them with divine might.  It is very well possible that this also applies to Sung times. In any case, there  was a meaning to all the constituent components of such amulets as de- scribed above. 95 The various chapters in A Corpus of Taoist Rituals concerning Chao  Kung-ming are individual traditions that share a common platform which is  the intent of Thunder rituals and their common spirit patron, Chao Kung- ming with his entourage of Thunder forces. The various lists of Thunder  divinities constitute the registers that a practitioner receives, together with  instructions for rituals and the writing of amulets. We have already observed  and emphasize again that each tradition and each set of Thunder rituals is  complete in itself and, of course, omnipotent which attests the independence  95 Compare Wang Ch’iu-kuei 2007, vol. 10, p. 746 a, concerning the amulet of mar- shal Chu (Chu yüan-shuai 朱元帥) in Lü-shan p’ai (閭山派) exorcism (Ch’ing-dynasty,  Fukien). </page> <page sequence="24"> 144 Florian C. Reiter and value of the individual transmission. We think that this says a lot about  the particularity and individuality of the profession of the Taoist priest. The presentation of the dissolved form of the Personal Amulet of the  Generalissimo mentioned three divine names beside Chao Kung-ming. 96  The Heavenly Lords Teng [Po-wen] 鄧伯溫, Hsin [Han-ch’en] 辛漢臣 and  Chang [Yüan-po] 張元伯 are ritual and meditative objects in many texts that  we associate with the activities of Wang Wen-ch’ing and his later followers.  In other words, these names are trade marks for those traditions of Thunder  Magic that we trace back to Wang Wen-ch’ing. 97 This leads us to consider  some aspects of the world of Thunder divinities. The World of Thunder Divinities Chao Kung-ming allegedly lived at the time of the Ch’in-dynasty (秦). This  means that he was a person of this world who proved to be outstanding  and finally deserved a divine career as protector of Cheng-i Taoism. There  are legions of comparable proper personal names on Thunder registers that  also indicate the respective divine ranks or positions. At first sight all these  names represent the category of Posterior Heaven (hou-t’ien 後天). Reading  the report on Generalissimo Chao in Secret Rituals of Cheng-i hsüan-t’an,  the Generalissimo Chao yüan-shuai 正一玄壇趙元帥祕法 we learnt that  Chao Kung-ming was the incarnation of heavenly breaths. This statement  claims a primordial divine nature for Chao Kung-ming and the superior  spiritual quality which the category Anterior Heaven (hsien-t’ien 先天) im- plies. 98 Anterior Heaven stands for abstract and unsurpassable almighty di- vine entities. The canonical texts show Chao Kung-ming to have a share in  both, in the quality of Anterior Heaven and Posterior Heaven. 99 However, the origin and genesis of other Thunder divinities may be dif- ferent. There was the assumption that transcendent energetic potentials can  adopt rank and function as divinities with proper names and honours, and all  of this may happen without the prelude of a life as heroic human being. Such  a divine entity seems to be exclusively endowed with the qualities of Anterior  Heaven. The Great Rituals of Heavenly Ting of Metal and Fire in Shen-hsiao  Heaven (Shen-hsiao chin-huo t’ien-ting ta-fa 神霄金火天丁大法) present a  splendid example. It is rewarding to read the Preface of the Great Rituals 100:  96 TT 1220: 233.10 b.  97 F. C.

The mystery of the protector immortals  lies in the Western Tower (hsi-t’ai 西臺). 101 The mystery of the Western Tower  lies in its bells of fire (huo-ling 火鈴), and the mystery of the bells of fire lies  in Heavenly Ting (t’ien-ting 天丁). 102 It is said that the Palace of the Bells of  Fire (huo-ling kung 火鈴宮) is located below the sun (t’ai-yang 太陽). Its Hall  of Streaming Fire (liu-huo chih t’ing 流火之庭), the Hostel of Cinnabar Yang  (tan-yang chih kuan 丹陽之館) and the Sphere of Radiant Red Light (ch’ih- ming chih ching 赤明之境) are the offices where the Perfected King of Jade  Purity and Great God-emperor of Shen-hsiao Heaven (Yü-ch’ing chen-wang  shen-hsiao ta-ti 玉清真王神霄大帝) directs cultivation. In the left yard there  are the divinities that adopt form and shape by combining the Brahma breaths  that carry the highest load of Yang [energies] among the nine Brahma breaths of  Shen-hsiao Heaven. It is generally said that persons take [the names of] fiefdoms  as their surnames. Divinities take [the names of heavenly] palaces and constel- lations (kung-hsiu 宮宿) as their surnames. Heavenly Ting is the breath of the  six stars of the stellar division Chang-hsiu 張宿 which transmuted to become a  jade divinity with the name Heavenly Ting of Metal and Fire (金火天丁). The  constellation Chang actually stands for the moon and the deer. 103 The moon is  the absolutely finest breath of Great Yin (t’ai-yin ching-hua chih ch’i 太陰精華 之氣). The divinity Heavenly Ting received (p. 1 b) the pure breath of Great Yin  to assemble and take on form and shape. It is for this reason that the divinity  has an appearance that is firm, stern and beautiful. The divinity has blue-green  hair and green eyebrows and is clad in red garments. The feet wear red-yang  shoes, and the hands hold an imperial clock (ti-chung 帝鐘) that greatly emits  blazing fire. There are four acolytes [around him] who are the Keepers of the  Fire Bells of Cinnabar Yang (t’ung tan-yang huo-ling t’ung-tzu 統丹陽火鈴童 子). Each of them carries a fire bell, [and they have the following names]: 1) Jade  lad with the fire bell of golden radiance (Chin-kuang huo-ling yü-t’ung 金光 火鈴玉童); 2) Jade lad with the fire bell of jade radiance (Yü-kuang huo-ling  yü-t’ung 玉光火鈴玉童); 3) Jade lad with the fire bell of auspicious radiance  (Jui-kuang huo-ling yü-t’ung 瑞光火鈴玉童); and 4) Jade lad with the fire bell  of brilliant radiance (Huan-kuang huo-ling yü-t’ung 煥光火鈴玉童). 104 There  are female soldiers who number eight hundred and ten thousands.

Reiter orders from and serve Shen-hsiao Heaven, discharging Thunders, deploying  lightning and patrolling the great void (t’ai-k’ung 太空). The [divinity] Heavenly Ting has the taboo name Loyalty (chung 忠). It  takes the nine strokes of the character [忠] to symbolize the nine empyreans  (chiu-hsiao 九霄) [of Shen-hsiao Heaven]. The scriptures say &lt;the five breaths  are the breaths of the central correctness of Shen-hsiao Heaven. The centre  is correctness. When the correct breaths completely unite with my heart, it  happens then that [the divinity] Heavenly Ting unites with me (wo 我). Yang  shines brilliantly, and the moon is bright. Therefore, [another] name [for the  divinity] is Luminous Response (chao-ying 昭應). 105 Now, loyalty means cor- rectness. Correctness means sincerity (ch’eng 誠). Sincerity means reliability  (xin 信), and for this reason the [appropriate] name [for the divinity] is: Gen- eral on whom Heaven Relies (T’ien-hsin chiang-chün 天信將軍). (p. 2 a) The  Jade Code (Yü-lü 玉律) says that the rituals of Shen-hsiao Heaven (shen-hsiao  fa 神霄法) know five categories [of partaking divine forces]: 1) the heavenly  immortal (t’ien-hsien 天仙); 2) the divine immortal (shen-hsien 神仙); 3) the  perfected immortal (chen-hsien 真仙); 4) the soaring immortal ( fei-hsien 飛仙),  and 5) the protector immortal ( pao-hsien 保仙). [The Jade Code] furthermore  says [concerning] the magic force of Shen-hsiao Heaven that the protector im- mortal owns [the magic force] in perfection. The perfection of the protector  immortal lies in the utmost divine [nature] of his fire bells. The divinity of the  fire bells is Heavenly Ting of Metal and Fire (金火天丁). Now we know that  Heavenly Ting of Metal and Fire is the one [divinity] that unites comprehen- sively the ten thousand rituals and lets them all return to complete unity. As  to the body (shen 身) [of Heavenly Ting], it exerts a unified heart in order to  respond to the ten thousand rituals, and thereby [Heavenly Ting] transmutes  his one body to be ten thousand divinities (wan-shen 萬神). 106 The affiliated masters in past generations honoured the rituals of Heavenly  Ting of Metal and Fire. There are one amulet and one seal which hold the es- sential Tao. The divinity [Heavenly Ting of Metal and Fire] can be used to  cultivate the [own] person and to refine the hun-souls (hun 魂). This divinity  can be made to be close [to one]. It can be deployed to investigate spirits (k’an- ching 勘精) and lock them up in jars. The divinity can be employed to protect  life and cut down monsters, to expel epidemics and bring about rainfall. The  divinity can [also] be implored with prayers to clear the skies. 107 The divinity  can be employed to cut off fountains and water veins, to destroy temples and  shrines ( p’o miao-t’ing 破廟庭). The mirror of the divinity has the mysterious  105 TT 1220: 198.3 a has the name as a part of the title of the leading general (... chin-huo  t’ien-ting huo-ling miao-shuai chao-ying chen-chün 金火天丁火鈴妙帥昭應真君). The  description of the apparition of the divinity contains most of the indications that the Pref- ace presented. We learn that the divinity rides fire-luan birds (火鸞), fire phoenixes (火鳳),  and fire dragons (火龍) or soars through empty space. 106 He transmutes his body (hua-shen 化身) to be omnipresent at all rituals. 107 The biography of Wang Wen-ch’ing reports such a ritual at the court of Sung Hui- tsung, see: F.

(p. 2 b) The precious seal ( pao-yin 寶印)  [of the divinity] can [help to] traverse form and ascend soaring [to heaven].  [The precious seal can] protect an embryo and safeguard a pregnancy ( pao-t’ai  an-yün 保胎安孕) and can resolve [problems with] parturition. First you protect one person, and then you bring peace to residential quar- ters. Thereafter you take control of demons and deities, and you expel wicked  and monstrous elements. Never produce such influences when you have not yet  refined your heart (lien-hsin 鍊心). The persons who receive this ritual method  must urgently and properly take it as their sole speciality (chuan-i 專一). They  must not show it to the wrong people but treasure it and keep it secret. The Preface is attributed to a person named Ch’en Tao-i 陳道一, who is hon- oured with a gorgeous temple name that qualifies him as ritual master of the  Shang-ch’ing and Ta-tung canonical traditions and as a high ranking spirit  administrator of Shen-hsiao [Heaven] (Shang-ch’ing ta-tung fa-shih shen- hsiao shang-hsiang pao-chen chi-wu ch’iung-yao chin-ch’üeh chen-jen 上清 大洞法師神霄上相保真濟物瓊瑤金闕真人). 108 Concerning the divinity Heavenly Ting we also find a Personal Jade  Amulet (T’ien-ting pen-shen fu 天丁本身符) that very much resembles the  personal amulet of Chao Kung-ming. 109 We note that A Corpus of Taoist  Rituals also reveals striking similarities between the Thunder registers and  exorcist instructions for which the two divinities Chao Kung-ming and  Heavenly Ting are responsible. These similarities conceal the very different  genesis of the two divinities. The surname Chao 趙 derives from a worldly  fiefdom 110 whereas Heavenly Ting has the surname Chang 張. Chang is said  to be one of the twenty eight stellar divisions which implies the divine po- tential of Anterior Heaven. 111 Taoist priests always handle exorcism which the range of their reli- gious duties unmistakeably indicates. Priests who are equipped with spirit   registers of Generalissimo Chao or the divinity Heavenly Ting share a com- mon problem which is the competition with exorcists who are not Cheng-i  priests and are called unorthodox masters (hsieh-shih 邪師). How to deal  with persons who appear to influence badly the spheres of Cheng-i Taoism  and the orthodox forces that Thunder divinities represent? 108 As to Ch’en Tao-i, see TT 1220: 198.26 b (Chin-huo t’ien-ting ta-fa hou-hsü 金火天丁 大法後序) which describes the line of transmission, starting with the legendary Fire Master  Pi Ch’i-tao 祕其道 and Lin Shih-ch’en 林侍宸 (Lin Ling-su 林靈素) who is the predecessor  of Wang Wen-ch’ing as court Taoist in the Northern Sung period. Ch’en Tao-i received the  teachings from Chang Ju-hui 張如晦, see TT 296: 53.13 a–13 b (Biography of Lin Ling-su). 109 TT 1220: 198.4 a–4 b, and compare TT 1220: 236.11 a–12 a (Chao Kung-ming). 110 Or say “country“, compare L.

Reiter It is hardly surprising to find an Amulet to Control Unorthodox Masters  (chih hsieh-shih fu 治邪師符) who may operate in areas of a circumference of  “up to ten thousand miles”. We learn that Generalissimo Chao Kung-ming  together with other spirit potentates can “knock down the hun-souls of un- orthodox masters” (Yüan-shuai tao hsieh-shih hun 元帥倒邪師魂). 112 What  in fact could a priest do when he encounters an unorthodox master? It is  worthwhile studying the following text: Chapter, A Ritual Master encounters a Wicked Sorcerer on the Road (Fa-shih  lu yü hsieh-wu p’in 法師路遇邪巫品) in Shen-hsiao chin-ting ta-fa (神霄金丁 大法) 113: (p. 12b) When a ritual officer ( fa-kuan 法官) moves around in daily life as to  administer his duty, he must first dispatch his [spirit] generals. His hands form  [the mûdra] Thunder Office (lei-chü 雷局) which he uses to start massaging  his waist. The ritual officer visualizes mentally his kidneys where two tracks  of black breaths rush towards his heart. They leave [his body] through the  tip of his tongue and change to become a stream of fire and Heavenly Ting is  [engulfed] within that stream of fire. Heavenly Ting rides a red dragon with  nine heads that spit fire straight ahead to reach the evil specialist. Then, one  stream of yellow breaths emerges from the centre of the spleen and transforms  into a golden bridge. Heavenly Ting of Metal and Fire (金火天丁) leads on his  troops that surround [and protect] me. 114 After that, [the ritual officer] beholds  meditating the rumbling thunders of the Thunder Lord (lei-kung 雷公) that  charge straight ahead as to reach directly the evil specialist and appear to get  into him. Then, the two hands [of the ritual officer] revolve [the mûdra] Thun- der Office to throw it at the evil specialist. (p. 13 a) The ritual officer proceeds  to do the steps Hidden-Dipper ( yin-tou 陰斗), and his hands move pointing  out [on the palm the patterns] tzu 子 and wu 午. The Dipper becomes manifest  and enters his mind. Heavenly Ting spreads out a veil as to arrest the sorcerer  (wu-jen 巫人) who was encountered on the road. [The ritual officier] uses then  the centre of his left hand to rub three times the centre of his forehead, moving  the hand smoothly around in a circle and speaking the following spell: &lt; Jade  decree: Golden Radiance and Brightness of Yang, do assist!&gt; [The ritual] officer recites the spell in his heart and must not produce any  sounds. He reflects on the centre of his forehead as a mirror of fire (huo-ching 火 鏡). His left and right eyes dart off two tracks of golden radiance that penetrate  and shine out the three heavens and straightaway shoot at the sorcerer. If [the  ritual officer] cannot behold in meditation this transformation, then he thinks [in- stead] that his left and right eyes shoot off two tracks of golden radiance that rush  straight ahead against the sorcerer. The ritual officer uses his left nostril to inhale  112 TT 1220: 232.18 a–18 b. 113 TT 1220: 198.12 b–13 a.

Fire bells glaringly shine out the heart and the liver of the sorcerer. If  this works, the hun-souls of the wizard ( yao-jen 妖人) will perish. This method must not be exhibited. If [a ritual master] wishes to destroy [a  sorcerer] he has to dispatch petitions to the superior God-emperors and then  he proceeds to get [the sorcerer] under control. A Taoist must not use any rituals to harm other persons, which obviously  was a necessary instruction and important information. The elimination of  wizards or sorcerers is a case in point. The consent of the highest divine  authorities has to be attained before such a destructive action can be staged.  Anyway, the divinity Heavenly Ting that we have seen as the decisive force  against a sorcerer or wizard and Chao Kung-ming have in common the sta- tus of martial divinities and elevated spirit administrators. The ritual instructions present Chao Kung-ming as a general (chu-chiang  主將) with many subordinate charges. The first relevant collection in A Corpus  of Taoist Rituals, chapter no. 232 (p. 2 b), subordinates him to a patron deity  (chu-fa 主法) with the religious title “patriarchal master, elevated and bright  God-emperor in the unlimited universe” (Tsu-shih liu-he wu-ch’iung kao- ming ta-ti 祖師六合無窮高明大帝) which is the divine rank of the Heavenly  Master Chang Tao-ling. 116 The following chapter no. 233 opens with the Spell  to Summon the Emissary of the Amulet (Chao fu-shih chou 召符使咒) and is  subordinated to the preceding chapter with its divine patrons and pantheon. Thunder rituals and traditions differ in their purposes and means, but they  still may have the same patron deities whose religious titles eventually can  differ. 117 As to Chao Kung-ming, A Corpus of Taoist Rituals contains vari- ant traditions with the same leading spirit patron whose religious titles differ.  The title Tsu-shih liu-ho wu-ch’iung kao-ming ta-ti 祖師六合無窮高明大帝 of  chapter no. 232 is basic. An extended form of this title is Cheng-i lao-tsu t’ien- shih liu-ho wu-ch’iung kao-ming ta-ti 正一老祖天師六合無窮高明大帝 in  chapter no. 236 (p. 2 a). Comparing chapter no. 234 (p. 1 a) with chapter no. 235  115 A commentary in small print explains that the dragon has only one horn. 116 TT 1463 Han t’ien-shih shih-chia 2.5 a–5 b; in ad 156, Mount Ch’ü-t’ing shan 渠亭山,  T’ai-shang Lao-chün reportedly granted the Heavenly Master the religious title that TT  1463 gives in abridged form. 117 There are numerous patron deities in Thunder Magic rituals. Chao Kung-ming is  the object of the present study. Just to give one more example, the female deity Heav- enly Mother Marici shows a distinct Buddhist flair. In fact, Marici 摩利支 is the name  of a Buddhist heaven, see: Ting Fu-pao 1974, p. 2564 a. TT 1220: 83.1 a sq. (Hsien-t’ien  lei-ching yin-shu 先天雷晶隐書) present the Heavenly Mother Marici (abr.: tou-mu tzu- kuang t’ien-hou Mo-li-chih 斗母紫光天后摩利支) and the Great God-emperor of Long  Life (Ch’ang-sheng ta-ti 長生大帝) as patron deities (chu-fa 主法) for the subsequent ritu- als. See: F. C. Reiter 2009, pp. 33, 34. </page> <page sequence="30"> 150 Florian C. Reiter (p. 1 a) we find that the latter chapter starts right away with the general class  (chiang-pan 將班) and lists the style Tzu-ch’ang 子常 for the Great Generalis- simo Chao Kung-ming. There is no indication of the Heavenly Master or of  any other patron deity, which subordinates chapter no. 235 to the preceding  chapter no. 234. Chapter no. 234 lists the patron deity with the rather different  title Tsu-shih san-t’ien ta fa-shih cheng-i ching-ying  hsien-yu chen-chün 祖師 三天大法師正一靜應顯佑真君 still pointing to the Heavenly Master. All these titles ascertain that Thunder rituals belong to Heavenly Mas- ters Taoism. They also document the unity of the traditions pertaining to  Chao Kung-ming. Chang Tao-ling is the divine patron for all these chapters  in A Corpus of Taoist Rituals, being the deified Heavenly Master and first  patriarch of Cheng-i Taoism. The differing religious titles of the Heavenly  Master suggest a different time of compilation for the respective chapters  and possibly different regional origins. Unfortunately, we have no further  clues to prove such assumptions. There are extended or abridged religious titles for the same divine bearer  who heads different traditions. We notice that in this sense the deified Heav- enly Master Chang Tao-ling is a current name. The key elements in his ti- tles are the following words: Heavenly Master and Venerable Patriarch of  Orthodoxy and Unity (cheng-i lao-tsu t’ien-shih 正一老祖天師). We find  them, for example, in the title Ancestral Patriarch, Master of the Teachings  of the Three Heavens, Venerable Patriarch of Orthodoxy and Unity, Heav- enly Master and Perfected Lord (Tsu-shih san-t’ien chiao-chu cheng-i lao- tsu t’ien-shih chen-chün 祖師三天教主正一老祖天師真君). This again is the  deified Heavenly Master Chang Tao-ling who appears as patron deity in the  collection Great Rituals of Generalissimo Ma, the Magic Agent of Ortho- doxy and Unity (Cheng-i ling-kuan Ma yüan-shuai ta-fa 正一靈官馬元帥 大法), albeit in the subsection Great Rituals of Ma Hsüan-t’an with Magi- cally Fast Orders (Shen-chieh ch’ih Ma Hsüan-t’an ta-fa 神捷敕馬玄壇大法)  where he holds the leading position of the Patriarchal Line. 118 The divinity Heavenly Ting was an important example in this study to  provide comparisons. The divinity stands for the stellar division Chang- 118 TT 1220: 36.4b (tsung-p’ai 宗派) where Chao Kung-ming ranks on a subordinate  position as superior general in the marshal class (shuai-pan 帥班), partly having variant  titles of honour, in comparison with TT 1220: 232–236. Also see TT 1220: 36.6 b, 7 a, 14 b.  The patron deities in the Great Rituals of Generalissimo Ma, the Magic Agent of Ortho- doxy and Unity are Wei Hua-ts’un 魏華存 and Hsü Sun 許遜, each with grand religious  titles, see TT 1220: 36.1 a. As to Generalissimo Ma also see TT 1220:230.1 a–11 a (Shang- ch’ing Ma Ch’en Chu san ling-kuan pi-fa 上清馬陳朱三靈官祕法). A Heavenly Master of  the Sung-period, Chang Chi-hsien 張繼先 (1092–1126), also appears as divine patron in  Thunder rituals, see TT 1220: 258.1 a–14 b (Tung-p’ing Chang yuan-shuai chuan-ssu k’ao- chao fa 東平張元帥專司考召法).

The arrangement does not change throughout the ample documenta- tion of the fairly abstract cult. We cannot explain the reason but note that the  tradition did not start out with an idealized human hero, which would have  introduced the dimension of Posterior Heaven. 119 The documentation of Generalissimo Chao Kung-ming and the divinity  Heavenly Ting show that the divine patrons in Thunder Magic may have  very different origins and identities. 120 They tend to unite the qualities and  categories of Anterior Heaven and Posterior Heaven. In any case, all these  divinities become temporarily an internal reality or alter ego for the Taoist  who holds the respective Thunder register. 121 Concluding Remarks Thunder Magic emerged in the Sung-period when Wang Wen-ch’ing, Pai  Yü-ch’an 白玉蟾 and other specialists elaborated, rationalised and codi- fied Thunder rituals. The patriarch Chang Yü-ch’u explained that Thunder  Magic was an integral part of Cheng-i Taoism when in the 15th century the  Canon was re-edited. 122 Exorcist practices predating the Sung-period and  theories of internal alchemy were united in the so-called Thunder Magic rit- uals (Wu-lei fa 五雷法). Similar ritual ways and means were present in early  Taoist history, albeit without the designation Thunder Magic. 123 The Hagi- ographies of Taoists who Throughout History Embodied Tao 124 abound with  reports about successful exorcist rituals, sweeping away drought demons,  praying for clear skies or expelling illness, epidemics, rain and inundations. Any study of Thunder divinities shows how well they fit in with the tra- ditions of Cheng-i Taoism. 125 Chao Kung-ming was said to embody heav- enly breaths that were given a proper, worldly name and so he finally came  119 TT 1220: 198.2 b–3 a, and the following chapters up to no. 205. 120 There are deities whose origin most certainly is Buddhist, like the female deity  Marici, see above: F.

Reiter, note 117. 121 TT 1220: 224.3 a, Entering the altar stage and transforming into a divinity ( Ju-t’an  pien-shen 入壇變神), the priest explicitly states in his spell that he holds the orthodox  registers (cheng-lu 正籙). 122 TT 1232 Tao-men shih-kuei.

Reiter to serve as divine protector for the Heavenly Master (Cheng-i hsüan-t’an  yüan-shuai 正一玄壇元帥). Chao Kung-ming was also said to have been a  good man who evaded the Ch’in-dynasty and perfected his Taoist erudi- tion. He was elevated to a divine rank as Thunder divinity. The case of Chao  Kung-ming proves that the well established categories of Anterior Heaven  and Posterior Heaven can be united in one divine entity. Specialists of Thunder rituals had a command of a wide range of exorcist  skills. The healing of diseases may have had a priority in terms of statistics. 126  However, many situations in daily life demanded relief. For example, there  is a report on the case of human sacrifice that was usually made to please a  river deity. The deity had to be eliminated, and Thunder forces were shown  to have the necessary might to destroy the cult. 127 The identities, apparitions  and operations of Thunder divinities reflect a welter of religious imagination  and concepts that reveal particular features of religious Taoism. The many  instructions about the Transformation into a Divinity document the desired  osmosis between divine entities and the Thunder specialist which character- izes Thunder rituals. The spiritual interaction is a most demanding task for  the priest. We keep in mind that the professed interaction with the divinities  is not a theatrical show that a priest puts on to impress or please onlookers  but a hidden inner action that must be based on a clear vision of the deities. 128 The writing of Thunder amulets is the practical and visible method of  Thunder Magic. The amulets of Chao Kung-ming have similar titles and ap- plications as the amulets of other Thunder deities which the amulets of the  divinity Heavenly Ting showed. The amulets of Chao Kung-ming are linked  to his name and ritual function, the amulet of the character Chao being a  conclusive example. Thunder amulets are either anthropomorphic drawings  representing fierce, martial figures with fire wheels and other weaponry, or  they are unintelligible compounds of seal characters. The writing of Thun- der amulets is a ritual in its own right with prayers, spells, ritual steps and  mûdras. The application of the amulets completes the respective Thunder  ritual. All of this describes the set up of exorcist rituals that since long have  been basic elements of religious Taoism. 126 Concerning Chao Kung-ming in this context, see J. Doré, S. J., trl. by D. J.
