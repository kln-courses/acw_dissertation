<plain_text><page sequence="1">254 • Book Review Review of The Blackwell Guide to Theology and Popular Culture BY KELTON COBB Maiden, MA: Blackwell Publishing, 2005. 354 pp. $24.95. In many ways Kelton Cobb's book is a meditation on how Augustine's famous phrase—we will be restless until we rest in God—still applies in our culture to day. Cobb's book deserves to be read because theology needs to address the is sues that Cobb raises. The work is a careful and welcome justification for the continuance of theology and cultural models that have recently come under at tack by postliberal critics. Cobb sees his own work as an appropriation of tools that Paul Tillich introduced to twentieth-century theology. He is mostly suc cessful in this venture, but the book will leave many of its readers, for differ ent reasons, wanting more. Cobb's book has two parts: The first 130 pages introduce cultural and the ological studies and suggest how the two disciplines can overlap; the second 170 pages analyze various cultural artifacts (songs, movies, novels, postcards, advertisements) organized around systematic theological themes (images of God, human nature, sin, salvation, and life everlasting). Cobb immediately ar gues that theology has its own contribution to make in cultural studies, specif ically pop culture studies. He wants theologians to understand why so many people today are finding solace and meaning in popular culture rather than in organized religions. He does not want an elitism in theological circles to be aloof to the daily concerns of ordinary people. Our generation presents the new challenge that popular culture's myths and symbols have eclipsed biblical and historical ones. Radical technological changes in the media have fueled such social change. Cobb effectively describes how some of these changes have oc curred. It is a complicated story, involving, among other things, the influence of Disney films and amusement parks, the capitalist advertisement industry, the presentation of political policies on television, Wal-Mart business practices, and the advent of the Internet. The media has grown beyond any overarching con trol and it has a distinct interest in shaping information according to rules of the capitalist market. In this context, "popular culture is the amalgamation of these delivering media and the delivered cultural symbols" (41). Cobb offers an overview of the contribution of the Frankfurt School to cul tural studies, illuminating their Marxist-influenced elitism that only viewed pop ular culture as a tool of the upper class to divert the lower classes from their ex</page><page sequence="2">Brett Chandler Patterson • 255 ploitation. Cobb believes that their concept of bricolage does reveal how most people pilot themselves through the flood of images that dominate Western cul ture, images that sometimes seem more "real" than the natural world around us. Linking Tillich's "theology of culture" with the Frankfurt School, Cobb brings a number of Tillich's concepts to bear on this discussion, including the concepts of "ultimate concern," "holiness," "ecstatic revelation," "myth," and "symbol." He argues that we must analyze culture to penetrate it and reveal the deeper meaning lying behind it. If we learn to read a culture's style, we will find more honest depictions of what we believe about ourselves and our religious concern. Most often these voices will be divine warnings of our own fallenness. Cobb is not always successful in connecting his theoretical chapters with his studies of various cultural art forms, but his discussion is always challenging. Cobb does not offer a justification for the works that he has chosen for study either. One assumes that this is his attempt at the bricolage that supposedly characterizes our "postmodern" existence. Can we make general statements about our culture from the sources that Cobb has chosen? With the expanse that is included under "popular culture," could we not marshal some other sources that might contradict some of the observations that Cobb makes? He does organize this section provocatively according to the major themes of sys tematic or dogmatic theology. Here he claims that we have moved from a "courageous agnosticism" in the mid-twentieth century to a melancholic re gret in the perceived absence of God. He believes that the popular voice calls for a recovery of the sacred. To justify this claim, he moves from Zorba the Greek in 1946 to irreverent anthropomorphic descriptions of God in works by Franco Ferrucci, Chuck Palahniuk, Kevin Smith, James Morrow, and Laurence Cosse in the 1990s. He sees modern authors renovating mythic traditions, acknowl edging that the wealth of these traditions has not been thoroughly exhausted. The writers grasp for reasons (from pieces of stories they were never told by their agnostic/atheist forebears) why we should be moral. Cobb believes our culture views human beings as pleasure-seeking bricoleurs who long for some thing beyond the simulations alone. Our society has its own stories of "what went wrong." We turn to popular culture to entice ourselves into believing that we can overcome the obstacles to our happiness and enjoy more fulfilling lives. Popular culture often explores what comes after death but calls us back to set ting our priorities in this world. Cobb cautiously agrees with Nick Hornby that because popular culture has become a lingua franca, to cut oneself off of it en tirely is in new ways what it once was to be illiterate. Cobb has sought to pro vide a method for locating religious impulses beneath the cover of popular cul ture. Often impulses prove idolatrous, but other times they reflect a stirring of the divine or an attempt to resuscitate values (from Christianity) that have be come dormant in our Western culture. Cobb's book will not solve the twentieth-century debate between Barth and Tillich regarding whether theology should engage only scriptural and ecclesial</page><page sequence="3">256 • Book Review sources. The dialectic Cobb describes plays out today between postliberal the ology, on one hand, and the field of "theology and culture," on the other. Yet both groups need each other. Revelation should ground Christian culture, but Christians should also show the world how to filter through cultural forms to illuminate destructive and creative forces in our world. Because Cobb's study lacks an attempt to relate dogmatic theology to the culture he analyzes, his book certainly cannot stand alone. Nonetheless, we can recognize what it can con tribute to theological reflection about our world today. Brett Chandler Patterson Anderson University</page></plain_text>
