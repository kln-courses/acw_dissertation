<plain_text><page sequence="1">WHITMAN'S INDEBTEDNESS TO THE SCIENTIFIC THOUGHT OF HIS DAY By Mrs. Alice Lovelace Cooke 1. Whitman's Knowledge of Science The movement of Whitman's day that was of widest interest and most revolutionary in its effect on life and thought was the advance of science. Whitman was outside the intellectual circles for which the subtleties and nuances of scientific theory were daily food, and to which names like Kant, Lyell, Goethe, Huxley, the Herschels, and Darwin were as familiar as the names of the Presidents. But tele scopes, microscopes, spectroscopes, and the like tended to democratize knowledge and to reveal the secrets of the universe to any man with seeing eyes and a receptive mind. The rise of industrialism, moreover, led to experimental chemistry, and the discovery of precious metals in large quantities and the revelation of the practical value of coal opened the way to geological surveys and discoveries. Popu lar books and popular lectures in science became the order of the day. The journals and newspapers devoted many columns to science under such captions as "Notes on the Progress of Science" or "Outlines of Popular Science." High schools and colleges began to introduce into their curricula courses in the natural sciences, and in the late forties the Lawrence Scientific School was established, to be followed a little later by the Smithsonian Institute in Washington. Both national and state governments, particularly that of New York, made appropriations for geological surveys and for the establishment of observatories and museums. Whitman was among those who had seeing eyes and a receptive mind, and he was a staunch believer in science. He was genuinely interested in most of the common branches of natural science, and he accepted, with perhaps a few reservations, a scientific explanation of the universe. His knowledge came in all probability from general reading and popular lectures, or, as Binns suggests, "through the</page><page sequence="2">90 Studies in English popular channels of periodical literature, and through con versation with thoughtful men."1 Whitman was, in fact, throughout his life an ardent, if unsystematic reader, and he undoubtedly made use of the public libraries accessible to him.2 He preserved in scrapbooks and among his papers a total of 554 clippings, a few of them from books but most of them from magazines and newspapers.3 Over seventy of these are concerned with scientific subjects; some are reports of lectures on science, and others tell about scientists or their activities. The scope of Whitman's scientific interest may be inferred from such titles as these: "The Donati Comet," "The Progress of Science," "Testimony of the Rocks," "Origin of Coal," "Physiology of the Earth," "Am. Ass. for the Advancement of Science," "Alexander Von Humboldt," "Phrenology," "Botany," "Physical Geog raphy," "Is the Sun Inhabited?"4 Whitman's interest in science is also in evidence in his editorial work, in his notes, and in his letters. As an editor he reviewed a number of books of scientific import, among them Chambers's Miscellany of Useful and Entertaining Knowledge; Fowler's Physiology, Animal and Mental and his Memory and Intellectual Improvement; Morse's School Geography and Atlas; Olmsted's Letters on Astronomy; Spurzheim's Phrenology; and Wellman's Illustrated Bot any* He mentions in his notes Le Brun's Illustrations of Comparative Anatomy* He also evinces some knowledge of the history of science, making note, for instance, of a iBinns, H. B., A Life of Walt Whitman, London, 1905, pp. 62 ff. 2Even as a boy in the office of the Long Island Democrat, Whitman had access to a circulating library of four hundred volumes.

We have, however, no record of an acquaintance with any man particularly interested in science during his formative period. Among his intimate friends acquired in his Washington days was John Bur roughs, but Whitman had already given evidence of his scientific interests before he met Burroughs. Indeed, it was probably because he could make poetry of "the demonstrable fact"10 that he attracted Burroughs. The great naturalist speaks of the poet's "thorough assimilation of the modern sciences"11 and asserts that Leaves of Grass was "the first serious and large attempt at an expression in poetry of a knowledge of the earth as one of the orbs, and of man as a microcosm of the whole."12 Another scientist who was Whitman's friend was Daniel G. Brinton, the well-known archaeologist; but this friendship, too, developed after Leaves of Grass had already given evidence of the poet's enthusiasm for science.13 Whitman also counted among his later intimate friends Robert G. Ingersoll, whose challeng ing mind14 incited him to articulate and define some of his own religious ideas affected by science;15 and likewise ilbid., p. 105. mid., p. 209. ^Whitman's Works, VIII, p. 220. 10Burroughs, John, Indoor Studies, New York, 1889, p. 52. 11 Burroughs, John, Birds and Poets with Other Papers, Boston, "1877, p. 215. *mid., p. 216. 13TraubeI, Horace, Walt Whitman in Camden, New York, 1908, III, p. 261. 14Whitman spoke (ibid., I, p. 262) of Ingersoll and Huxley as the "master-pilgrims" of the age.

Youmans, founder of the Popular Science Monthly.1* An extravagant admirer of Whitman among men of scientific accomplishments in the field of psychology was Dr. Richard Maurice Bucke. Instead, however, of claiming any credit for having im parted to Whitman anything of scientific knowledge, Bucke found the poet's knowledge so inexplicable that he ac counted for it by a sudden mystic revelation which he called a "cosmic consciousness."17 Whitman did not meet Tyndall, Huxley, or Spencer on their visits to America.18 The only English scientist, in fact, who, he said, took a "shine" to him was W. K. Clifford, the mathematician.19 In his essay on "Cosmic Emotion," published in The Nineteenth Century in 1877, Clifford paid tribute to Whitman as a poet who sang with rhapsody of the relation between the microcosm and macrocosm?between man and the inconceivable spatial universe which surrounds him.20 Burroughs is the authority for the statement that "Professor Clifford" found Whitman "more thoroughly in harmony with the spirit and letter of advance scientism than any other living poet."21 But however limited or extensive Whitman's actual acquaintance with scientists was, that he in the last analysis owed much to them may be inferred from his remark: "I stand in awe before the men of science: they hold the key to the situation: they are the true discoverers . . . with their abandon, honesty."22 Whatever the source of Whitman's knowledge, his own interest as well as the popular interest in science is reflected in various ways in his writings. Apparently from the very 16Traubel, I, p. 101. i7Traubel, H. L., Bucke, R. M., and Harned, T. B., In Re Walt Whit man, Philadelphia, 1893, pp. 229 ff., 249 ff. i8Traubel, II, p. 553.

In the "Preface" of the 1855 edition he discussed at length the importance of science to the poet. "Exact science [he wrote] and its practical movements are no checks on the greatest poet but always his encouragement and support. . . . The atomist chemist geologist phrenologist spiritualist mathe matician historian and lexicographer are not poets, but they are the lawgivers of poets and this construction underlies the structure of every perfect poem. ... In the beauty of poems are the tuft and final applause of science."23 2. Whitman's Use of Contemporary Revelations in Astronomy Whitman's century, with the great improvements made in the telescope, with the perfection of the spectroscope, and the development of photography, witnessed many significant discoveries in astronomy. In an editorial dated March 20, 1847, Whitman tells of the establishment of an observatory in Cincinnati. He expresses in this connection an admira tion for John Quincy Adams, who consented, in spite of his age, "to lay the cornerstone" of this observatory, because of an unwillingness "to lose an opportunity of advancing the cause of science;" he recounts also the untiring efforts of "Professor 0. M. Mitchell" to bring about the establishment of the observatory; and he ends his article by a declara tion that "this institution is a striking illustration of the power of the human mind when vigorously directed to one object."24 Whitman's reference to Professor Mitchell may mean more than a reporter's passing remark; for Professor Mitchell was the author of several books on astronomy, and he delivered a series of six lectures on the subject at the Broadway Tabernacle in December, 1847. These lectures were later printed in book form by the New York Tribune, ^Leaves of Grass, Inclusive Edition, edited by Holloway, Emory, New York, 1927, p. 497. Much of this material Whitman later incorporated into his "Song of the Answerer." 24Rodgers, Cleveland, and Black, John, The Gathering of the Forces, New York, 1920, II, p. 148.</page><page sequence="6">94 Studies in English with the prefatory remark that "the greatest inquiry for the Tribune . . . containing these lectures has induced the publishers to issue them in the present collected form that they may at all times be accessible to the reading com munity."25 At another time Whitman reviewed Professor Denison Olmsted's Letters on Astronomy.2* It was, perhaps, the young editor's didacticism as much as his scientific curiosity which caused him to respond to this work; for, according to Olmsted, the purpose of his Letters on Astronomy was "to connect with the leading truths of science such historical incidents and moral reflections, as may at once interest the understanding and amend the heart."27 These early contacts with astronomy are to be connected with evidences of a thoughtful and intelligent interest in astronomy in Whitman's later life. In his notes of 1877 and 1878 are two comments taken from his reading of current scientific discussion upon Mars, in other notes numerous observations upon the locations of various heavenly bodies ?single stars and constellations being carefully differen tiated?and in still others information about astronomical matters, as, for example, the shape of the Dipper fifty thousand years ago or the moving and whirling of "the misty nebulae."28 In another note is a reference to one of his ferry companions, "the astronomer M. Whitehall (who posts me up about the stars by a living lesson then and there, answering every question)."29 In Specimen Days he con fesses that he may have made some "technical errors" in the "minutiae" of his "garrulous" notes on astronomy; but he gives evidence, in drawing upon the science for a figure of speech, of having pondered over the laws of astronomy until he had assimilated their larger import: 2SMitchell, O.

Mlbid., V, p. 225.</page><page sequence="7">Whitman's Debt to Contemporary Science 95 "As in astronomical laws, the very power that would seem most deadly and destructive turns out to be latently conservative of longest, vastest future births and lives."30 In his poetry Whitman reflects both the popular interest in astronomy and his own meditation over the universe as revealed through that science. In the little poem "Germs" (1860), for example, he emphasizes the astronomical law of the unity in nature: "The stars themselves, some shaped, others unshaped, Wonders as of those countries, the soil, trees, cities, inhabi tants, whatever they may be, Splendid suns, the moons and rings, the countless combina tions and effects, Such-like, and as good as such-like, visible here or anywhere, stand provided for in a handful of space . . . That containing the start of each and all, the virtue, the germs of all."31 He expresses also again and again the idea of unlimited time and space and of orderliness in the universe. Two passages will serve for illustration: "The bright suns I see and the dark suns I cannot see are in their place."32 "And I say to any man or woman, Let your soul stand cool and composed before a million universes."33 More than once the poet brings out the principle of an unlimited but well-ordered universe by a simple statement that the Earth is an "orb of many orbs."34 In "A Song of the Rolling Earth" he elaborates the idea by referring to the Earth as the beautiful sister, dancing among intermin able sisters, among younger and older sisters.35 Sometimes his wonder leads him to develop the same scientific idea through a number of stanzas, as in "Song of Myself" (1855) : 30/6iU, V, pp. 41, 208. 31Leaves of Grass, p. 230. zzlbid., p. 38.

See ever so far, there is limitless space outside of that, Count ever so much, there is limitless time around that."36 The nebular hypothesis, furthermore, which had come to be popularly accepted in Whitman's time, is interwoven with the thought of several poems in Leaves of Grass.37 In "Eidolons" the poet writes: "All space, all time, The stars, the terrible perturbations of the suns, Swelling, collapsing, ending, serving their longer shorter use."38 In "A Thought of Columbus" the nebular hypothesis sup plies the symbol for tracing the growth of the discoverer's thought from a mere impulse to a well-defined ideal, the opening lines running: "The mystery of mysteries, the crude and hurried ceaseless flame, spontaneous, bearing on itself, The bubble and the huge, round, concrete orb! A breath of Deity, as thence the bulging universe unfolding! The many issuing cycles from their precedent minute! The eras of the soul incepting in an hour, Haply the widest, farthest evolutions of the world and man."39 ^Leaves of Grass, pp. 69 if.; see also pp. 124, 153, 221, 315, 411, 425. 37See in this connection In Re Walt Whitman, p. 250. ^Leaves of Grass, p. 6. Ibid., p. 463.</page><page sequence="9">Whitman's Debt to Contemporary Science 97 Various other astronomical topics are referred to in other poems. The centripetal and centrifugal forces, upon which the stability of the solar system depends, are specifically mentioned in "A Song of the Rolling Earth" by a reference to the various bodies in the solar system as "the centripetal and centrifugal sisters," while in "You Tides with Ceaseless Swell" the importance of tides as one of the interrelated forces is brought out by linking them with the "unseen forces centripetal and centrifugal."40 In "After an Inter val" the poet deals with the conjunction of Saturn and Mars which took place on November 22, 1875. In "On the Beach at Night" Whitman refers to another current topic in astronomy in the lines, "Amid a transparent clear belt of ether yet left in the east, Ascends large and calm the lord-star Jupiter."41 His use of the word "ether" in the first of these lines recalls one of the scientific problems much discussed until the middle of the nineteenth century, when "the case for ether was considered to be fully established."42 In the "Year of Meteors (1859-1860)" the poet speaks of "Year of comets and meteors transient and strange,"43 referring evidently to Donati's celebrated comet, which attracted much atten tion between June and October, 1854,44 or to "a brilliant ^Leaves of Grass, pp. 188, 425. ^Ibid., p. 220. 42WilIiams, H.

Whitman's day witnessed many spectacular comets. Halley's comet returned in 1835; very bright comets appeared in 1843, with showers of meteors in the thirties and the fifties. Among Whitman's memoranda (Leaves of Grass, p. 634) is a note linking the spectacular shower of meteors in 1833 with "the wondrous and dazzling" shower of meteors in the year 1858 of "These States between midnight and morning." If he were referring in the poem to the comet and meteors of 1858, the slight inaccuracy in date at the beginning of the poem may be accounted for by his being more concerned with the figurative than with the literal meaning.</page><page sequence="10">98 Studies in English fireball" which passed over New York in I860.45 In "A Song of the Rolling Earth" Whitman devotes several stanzas to the two motions of the earth.46 In "Eidolons" he mentions the instruments of the astronomer, the telescope and the spectroscope,47 and he refers to the astronomical instru ments and to the astronomer's methods in "When I Heard the Learn'd Astronomer."48 The spectroscope was perfected in 1858, and with it by 1860 the chemical composition of celestial bodies was rapidly resolved into terrestrial terms. As a result the far-reaching principle of the unity of substance in the universe became established.49 Current astronomical topics are likewise drawn upon by the poet for lines which suggest at first glance an acquaint ance with some mere handbook of useful information rather than the assimilating of the larger principles of astronomy as set forth in a technical treatise. The following line will illustrate: "What are the messages by you from distant stars to us? what Sirius'? what Capella's?"50 But the reference to Sirius and Capella goes back to con temporary topics. General interest was aroused in these two stars in Whitman's time because of continuous efforts to obtain the spectra of the two stars, the one red, the other green.51 Sirius, moreover, had long been a crux to astron omers because of its "suspected non-conformity in the proper motion,"52 while the popular imagination was stim ulated by the claim that Sirius was a sun at least four times larger than our sun.53 In 1840 a prediction had been made 45Steele, J.

Another passage bringing out Whitman's often repeated theme that our globe moves in an orderly manner among other globes involves apparently references to two astronomical revela tions of the day,?namely, the discovery of Neptune by Leverrier in 1846 and the discovery in 1850 of the inner ring of Saturn. Both of these developments seem to be referred to in the following passage from "Song of Myself": "Speeding through space, speeding through heaven and the stars, Speeding amid the seven satellites and the broad ring, and the diameter of eighty thousand miles, Speeding with tail'd meteors, throwing fire-balls like the rest."5* The phrase "seven satellites," represented as accompanying the earth in its journey through space, seems to involve a reference to the discovery of Neptune, the eighth planet, a happening which the newspapers had been full of. National pride had been stirred by the part American scientists, par ticularly Benjamin Peirce of Harvard, had taken in the discovery.56 The phrase "broad ring and diameter eighty thousand miles" in the same passage, if I am not mistaken, involves a reference to the discovery of the inner ring of Saturn. The rings of Saturn had long served to make Saturn an interesting and mysterious planet. The popular lecturer, 54Clerke, p. 50. In his notes Whitman remarks on "the dazzling splendor" of Sirius and refers to it as "the sun of night."

Mitchell, to whom I have already referred,57 is quoted as saying*, "Saturn's rings were left unfinished to show us how the world was made."58 So, too, Professor Peirce had departed from current opinion and aroused lively discussion by proving the untenableness of the theory that the ring was solid. To-day the diameter of Saturn is estimated to be 75,000 miles, but one of the popular books of 1854 gives it as "79,600 miles or nearly a thousand times larger than the earth."59 Whitman makes it exactly a thousand times larger. In the lines from "A Song of Occupations," "Have you reckon'd that the landscape took substance and form that it might be painted in a picture . . . Or the stars to be put in constellations and named fancy names?7'60 Whitman is probably hitting at some of the popular books of the day which gave as full accounts of the mythology back of the names of the stars as of the scientific facts which underlay the mystery of creation. In "When I Heard the Learn'd Astronomer" he tells of his attending some lecture on astronomy and of his listening in the lecture room to the astronomer's discussion of proofs, diagrams, and charts until he became unaccountably tired and sick, and wandered off by himself "In the mystical moist night-air, and from time to time, Look'd up in perfect silence at the stars."61 3. Whitman's Use of Contemporary Revelations in Geology Whitman reflects at numerous points in his writings, and particularly in his poems, an interest in the revelations of his century in the field of Geology. By reason of the appear ance in England of a book by Sir Thomas Lyell entitled 57See above, p. 93. ssSteele, p. 283.

Lyell visited America in 1841, lecturing in various cities and traveling over the country in order to study geology, with the result, according to the Dial of July, 1842, that "wherever one went he saw a copy of Lyell's Geology on the table."63 Later Lyell wrote two volumes devoted to his travels in North America, as well as a technical treatise on the geology of this continent. Geological surveys and reports were common topics in the forties. As early as 1840, the Governor of New York in his annual message spoke of the geological surveys made in that state, and expressed the hope that through them the foundation for popular instruction in science might be laid.64 General interest was further stimulated by the un earthing in New York of one of the largest and most com pletely preserved skeletons of a mastodon then known.65 Whitman no doubt responded eagerly to these popular demonstrations and enthusiasms. In the newspaper and magazine clippings preserved among his effects are four described by Bucke as follows: "Newspaper piece, 'Geo logical Lecture/ " ;66 "Newspaper review of Miller's Testi mony of the Rocks, 10th Oct., '57" ;67 "Newspaper piece, 'Dr. Boynton's Sixth Lecture on Geology' " ;68 and "Maga zine article, 'Lyell's Geological Tour/ Sept., '45."69 In addi tion to a general interest, Whitman also acquainted him self, it appears, through his reading or through popular lectures with some of the fundamental laws of geology. A basic idea in his writing is the theory held by contemporary ?2Boas, R. P., and Hahn, B. M., Social Backgrounds of English Literature, Boston, 1923, pp. 228 ff. ?*The Dial, III, p. 51 (July, 1842). ^The New Yorker, VIII, No. 17 (January 11, 1840). ^Williams, III, pp. 112 ff. ^Whitman's Works, X, p. 68. e?Ibid., p. 69. &lt;*Ibid., p. 93. wibid., p. 94.</page><page sequence="14">102 Studies in English geologists that the world has undergone and is still under going a gradual change. His interest in geology as poetic material is indicated by the following outline preserved among his notes: "The Land.?physical facts of the land, as first its nebulous be ginnings, then its geology, all through to the present, then its present beauty, reality, diversity as the home of man."70 In another note he gives jottings for a poem developing geological theories and suggests at the same time their interpretation: "Materialism?(put this section forward . . . ) that this earth is under a constant process of amelioration?as it has always been? that it, in some manner not perhaps demonstrable in astronomy expands outward and outward in a larger and larger orbit . . . that the processes of refinement and perfection of the earth are in steps, the least part of which involves trillions of years. . . . "71 This passage indicates through the use of the word "amelioration" for gradual change an unreadiness to accept the scientific theory of gradual change except as a beneficent change. In "A Song of the Rolling Earth," however, in which the material outlined in his notes is turned into poetry, a more scientific interpretation of gradual change is evident. Here he writes: "Amelioration is one of the earth's words, The earth neither lags nor hastens, It has all attributes, growths, effects, latent in itself from the jump, It is not half beautiful only, defects and excrescences show just as much as perfections show."72 The theory of gradual change as an explanation of crea tion recurs many times in other poems. He says specifically of the earth in "Thou Mother with Thy Equal Brood": ^Whitman's Works, IX, p. 47. Ibid., p. 150. 72Leaves of Grass, p. 187.</page><page sequence="15">Whitman's Debt to Contemporary Science 103 "Thou globe of globes! thou wonder nebulous! By many a throe of heat and cold convuls'd, (by these thyself solidifying,)."73 In "O Star of France" he writes: "... the Earth itself, Product of deathly fire and turbulent chaos, Forth from its spasms of fury and its poisons, Issuing at last in perfect power and beauty . . . "74 A passage in "Eidolons" echoes the geological account of creation, but pictures the earth in a later stage of develop ment : "Strata of mountains, soils, rocks, giant trees, Far-born, far-dying, living long . . ,"75 In "Who Learns My Lesson Complete?" Whitman rejects apparently the account of creation as set forth in Genesis and favors the view of creation held by the geologists of his time. Here he says of the earth: "I do not think it was made in six days, nor in ten thousand years, nor ten billions of years, Nor plann'd and built one thing after another as an archi tect plans and builds a house."76 The principle of gradual change is, of course, the basis of the doctrine of evolution. Hence geology and evolution are inseparable. Since the theory of evolution, however, puts the emphasis upon the origin and development of life itself, Whitman gave much thought to it, and he accepted it with a few reservations as the explanation of the mystery of creation. The theory was rendered plausible, if not entirely convincing, by Darwin in 1859 in his Origin of Species; but many of the leading thinkers of the world had been pondering over the same idea for some time before Darwin published his great work,?among them Goethe, Erasmus Darwin, Lamarck, Cuvier, and Herbert Spencer.

Ibid., p. 330.</page><page sequence="16">104 Studies in English Even as early as 1836 Emerson delivered in America a lecture on evolution.77 Robert Chambers in 1844 gave anonymously in Vestiges of the Natural History of Crea tion a vapory explanation of the theory and an unequivocal avowal of its tenability. His book ran through several editions78 and was quoted in America as late as 1856 in at least one of the popular journals of the day.79 Whitman may be said to have adopted the theory of evolution in effect before the first publication of Leaves of Grass in 1855.80 He does not refer specifically to the earlier philosophical or scientific exponents of the theory, but nothing illustrates better his close following of scientific developments than the fact that his avowal of a belief in evolution antedated Darwin's book. In his old age he said, "I have felt from the first that my own work must assume the essential truths of evolution, or something like them."81 Even more conclusive on this point are sundry passages in his poetry in which he avows his faith in evolution. In several passages of "Song of Myself," for example, the poet traces his own origin back to the First Nothing, identi fying himself thereby with all creation, not by the old philosophical doctrine of identity, but by the scientific doctrine of the unity of nature. He writes: "I find I incorporate gneiss, coal, long-threaded moss, fruits, grains, esculent roots, And am stucco'd with quadrupeds and birds all over, And have distanced what is behind me for good reasons, But call anything back again when I desire it."82 "Before I was born out of my mother generations guided me, My embryo has never been torpid, nothing could overlay it. 77Clark, H.

Other passages emphasize the principle of the unity of matter through differentiation of design that comes with the process of evolution, as in the famous lines from "To Be At All": "To be at all?what is better than that? I think if there were nothing more developed, the clam in its callous shell in the sand were august enough. I am not in any callous shell; I am cased with supple conductors, all over, They take every object by the hand, and lead it within me; They are thousands, each one with his entry to himself . . . I think I could lift the girder of the house away if it lay between me and whatever I wanted."85 Whitman brings the theory of evolution into Leaves of Grass in yet other ways. He speaks of evolution as furnish ing a possible analogy to his own methods of composition or to the tenuousness and flexibility of his philosophical ideas, declaring: ^Leaves of Grass, p. 69. ^Ibid., p. 50. *Hbid., p. 462.</page><page sequence="18">106 Studies in English "Let others finish specimens, I never finish specimens, I start them by exhaustless laws as Nature does, fresh and modern continually."86 He uses the theory of evolution again to arouse reverence for the body, as in "I Sing the Body Electric" in his declara tion to the bidders at an auction of a negro that whatever they bid, they can not bid high enough for his body, in asmuch as "For it the globe lay preparing quintillions of years without one animal or plant, For it the revolving cycles truly and steadily roll'd."87 Other poems show how his faith in evolution strengthened his faith in the future life. For instance, in his "Song of Prudence" he writes: "Did you guess anything lived only its moment? The world does not so exist, no parts palpable or impalpable so exist, No consummation exists without being from some long previous consummation, and that from some other, Without the farthest conceivable one coming a bit nearer the beginning than any."88 In "Going Somewhere" he confesses that all the knowledge that astronomy, geology, evolution, and metaphysics give of the final destination is that we are steadily speeding forward, bettering the world, the race, and the soul.89 The importance of evolution in Whitman's thought is further evidenced by statements that appear in his prose. In an essay included in Specimen Days he remarked that some claimed origin from God himself, others from a monkey or a baboon, but that there would arise a third theory, the true one; that the world could only be "bettered and broadened by Darwinism," for through Darwin the old theories became "grand, modest, truly scientific" even 8GLeaves of Grass, p. 201. Mlbid., p. 84. *mid., p. 315. *mid., p. 433.</page><page sequence="19">Whitman's Debt to Contemporary Science 107 though the problems of origin remained "not a whit nearer solution."90 Debates and arguments as methods of arriving at the truth of the theory he discounted.91 In another passage in Specimen Days, he asserted that in "due time the evolution theory" would "have to abate its vehemence," and "take its place as a segment of the circle," as "one of many theories"; that the final work was left not alone to the debater or scientist, but also to the poet and priest.92 In the last years of his life, when he was told that "Huxley did not hold evolution as a dogma, but as a working hypothe sis," he declared that "such a confession" was "the most glorious and satisfying statement of the nineteenth cen tury."93 4. Whitman's Use of Other Sciences Astronomy and geology with their unlimited ramifica tions were undoubtedly the two sciences that had most to offer Whitman; but he drew here and there also upon the revelations being made in other sciences, as well as upon the pseudo-sciences of phrenology and physiognomy.94 From industrial chemistry, for instance, he borrowed for his poetry such phrases as "artificial fertilizers," "electro plating," "Food and its preservation, Chemistry applied to it,"95 and from more technical chemistry such principles as the indestructibility of matter, in "This Compost," or the chemical changes involved in the formation of rain, in "The Voices of the Rain." The general interest in botany he reflects in such titles as "Leaves of Grass" and "Calamus," in the hundreds of names of the different flora of the United voWhitman's Works, V, pp. 278 ff. 91 Whitman read with interest, however, Ingersoll's debates against W. E. Gladstone, Frederic C. Coudert, and Stewart Woodford.

Bits of his writing, apparently of an early date, give evidence of his practical use of these sciences as laying down principles of conduct or of analysis of character.100 In an early review of Leaves of Grass, written, as it was later revealed, by Whitman himself, he draws upon phre nology for a critical analysis of his book and himself.101 Echoes of the contemporary interest in phrenology are caught also at various points in Leaves of Grass. In his "Preface" to the 1855 edition he names the phrenologist as the law-giver of poets and applies phrenology to his analysis of the ideal poet.102 Under a note on suggestive words and phrases he tells of having consulted a phrenological list,103 and he incorporates in various poems, as if they were ordinary terms, sundry words from phrenology, such 96Leaves of Grass, pp. 457, 46.

As "the chanter of personality" he turned to phrenology for an analysis of himself as the American type as well as for an analysis of the race.104 Certain groups of poems, as "The Children of Adam" and "Calamus," cer tain single poems, and various lines and phrases are expressions, moreover, of the poet's desire to stress certain faculties. In spite of the fact that Whitman gave to his literary executors his phrenological chart and that he con tinued to refer (often jocularly) to phrenology to the end of his life, in his later years he came to attach less im portance to it. This waning interest is reflected in his poems by his substitution of the word "brain" for the word "phrenology" ;105 or by the supplanting of some phren ological term by some other phrase, as the change in title of "Walt Whitman's Caution" in 1860 to "To the States" in 1867, or by the elimination of many of the earlier references to phrenology.106 Clearly the poet's interest in phrenology affords another illustration of his determination to adopt a scientific rather than a theological or philosophical point of view. As a bard of personality he was seeking a scien tific explanation for the complexities, diversities, and per versities resulting from that inexplicable union of body and soul known as human nature, and he thought he had found it in phrenology.107 ^Leaves of Grass, pp. 8, 30, 43, 157, 290, 617. i?5Ibid., pp. 1, 434. ioQIbid., pp. 661, 665. io7j owe it to Mr. Edward Hungerford to say that in an article which he entitles "Walt Whitman and his Chart of Bumps," published in American Literature, II, pp. 350 ff. (January, 1931), he has dis cussed at some length the subject of Whitman and his use of phrenology; but in fairness to myself I must state that my own discussion was written before his article appeared. Undoubtedly Whitman makes more use of phrenology than any other American poet, but Mr. Hungerford would give to phrenology a more important place in Whitman's background than the evidence seems to me to warrant.</page><page sequence="22">110 Studies in English Closely related to Whitman's obsession with phrenology is his interest in physiognomy, a collateral branch of phre nology. His use of the word "physiognomy" is ordinarily in a broad and general sense, but at least in "Faces" he makes some use of the technicalities of physiognomy, classifying faces minutely, and making use, as did the physiognomist, of comparative anatomy. It was but a step from phrenology and physiognomy to physiology. In fact, in the discoveries of the day, the three were closely linked, phrenology and physiology being especially closely related through the study of the brain and the faculty of alimentiveness.108 Whitman looked to the popular study of physiology to bring about a more whole some attitude towards the body.109 The naive pedantry of the age, however, that made popular an encyclopedic knowl edge of the details and facts of all sciences led him to sing of the most prosaic gleanings from physiology.110 We should not conclude that Whitman tabulated and pigeon-holed his scientific information under the various branches of science and pseudo-science. In common with the abler laymen of his age he had a natural curiosity about each, and he had surely caught the contemporary desire to master the larger principles and some of the details of each. But he was interested chiefly in science as a broad and general subject, and he grasped in the manner of a true scientist the basic oneness of science. Among his memo randa is the note: "Now are given to science many names?geology, botany, astronomy, physiology, etc. But the real science is omn[isc]ient, is nothing less than all sciences comprehending all the known names and many un known."111 He recognized, too, that the study of science meant a con stant change and revision in many theories. Hence he charged himself: 108Spurzheim, J. G., Phrenology, Boston, 1834, II, pp. 36, 54 ff. 109Traubel II, pp. 101, 168; Leaves of Grass, p. 85. 110Leaves of Grass, pp. 25, 45, 100, 411, 434. ^Whitman's Works, II, pp. 96 ff.</page><page sequence="23">Whitman's Debt to Contemporary Science 111 "Remember in scientific and similar allusions that the theories in Geology, History, Language, etc., are continually changing. Be careful to put in only what may be appropriate centuries hence."112 He approved, moreover, of the method insisted upon by the modern scientist in studying the known and the un known, seeing in the concrete object used by the scientist more convincing proof than the metaphysical abstractions of a previous age. We find in Leaves of Grass such declara tions as these: "Logic and sermons never convince, The damp of the night drives deeper into my soul."113 "A morning-glory at my window satisfies me* more than the metaphysics of books."11* "I will take an egg out of the robin's nest in the orchard, I will take a branch of gooseberries from the old bush in the garden and go and preach to the world; You shall see how I stump clergymen, and confound them, You shall see me showing a scarlet tomato, and a white pebble from the beach."115 5. Whitman's Conception of the Conflict Between Science and Religion Through science Whitman hoped to regenerate poetry. "Science, the final critic of all," had "the casting vote for poetry," he held.116 He was, however, the poet rather than the scientist. As a poet he never ended, as does the scientist, with the concrete fact, but he attempted to reach beyond it. He sang, "Hurrah for positive science! long live exact demonstration!"117 But he added, in speaking of the scientists, "Gentlemen, to you the first honors always! Your facts are useful, and yet they are not my dwelling."118 us/did., p. 3. llsLeaves of Grass, p. 49. mibid., p. 45.

Only, (for me, at any rate, in my prose and poetry), joyfully accepting modern science, and loyally following it without the slightest hesitation, there remains ever recognized still a higher flight, a higher fact, the eternal soul of man . . . which it is to be the greatest office of scientism, in my opinion, and of future poetry also to free from fables, crudities, and superstitions."120 But whatever the limitations of science, Whitman has left no doubt of his conviction that modern science rather than theology offers the key to the knowable universe. A comment in Specimen Days on the conflict between the two makes clear his position: "Note, today, an instructive, curious spectacle, and conflict. . . . Science testing absolutely all thoughts, all words, has already burst well upon the world?a sun . . . most illuminating . . . surely never again to set. But against it, deeply intrenched, holding possession, yet remains . . . the fossil theology of the mythical-materialistic, super stitious, untaught and credulous, folk-loving ages of humanity."121 It is clear, then, that in the conflict of the age between science and orthodox religion, Whitman thought of religion always in connection with science. The importance of science in the poet's thinking is, in fact, nowhere more evident than in the formation of his main religious tenets. He believed, first of all, unreservedly in a Divine Force; but he did not always call this Divine Force God, nor did he turn to the Bible for proof of the existence of God. Because of the doubts cast by science as to the existence of the "?Traubel, n&gt; P- 423; II, p. 424. ^Whitman's Works, V, pp. 200 ff. "i/6?Z., V, p. 123.</page><page sequence="25">Whitman's Debt to Contemporary Science 113 Deity, he reiterated his faith in the "Something behind all life," "even the triumphs of science," "which rounded out and completed it."122 But as regards his conception of the nature of God, one has to rely largely on inference. In the midst of the controversy of the day as to God, he declared: "Ah more than any priest 0 soul we too believe in God, But with the mystery of God we dare not dally."123 To the puzzling question as to the nature of God, he would answer, "And I say to mankind, Be not curious about God, For I who am curious about each am not curious about God."124 His "Chanting the Square Deific" is the only one of his poems in which he expounds directly the nature of God. Here the Deity is symbolized by a square, the four sides of which represent love, evil, natural law, and immortality. The teachings of science do not explain the poem as a whole, but they come nearer to an explanation than do the teach ings of orthodox religion. Love is symbolized by Christ, but Whitman did not look upon Christ as more divine than other men. He painted "no head without its nimbus of gold color'd light."125 Evil is symbolized by Satan, but evil is the law of nature?"no law stronger."126 He describes the side of the square representing inexorable natural law thus: "Unpersuadable, relentless, executing righteous judgments, As the Earth, the Father, the brown old Kronos, with laws. . . . "127 The deific square is completed by Santa Spirita, Whitman's word for the general soul present in all life, evidences of which he had found in science, particularly in his conception ^Whitman's Works, VII, p. 40. 123Leaves of Grass, p. 349. 124J6td!., p. 73. ^Ibid., pp. 198, 324. 12GIbid., p. 165. 127Ibid., p. 370. Under the phrase "laws invisible" the poet makes in another poem one of his most elaborate apostrophes to God; see p. 453.</page><page sequence="26">114 Studies in English of the theory of evolution and in chemistry. He saw through science, Nature as continuing, as being endless, a conviction expressed most clearly in "Eidolons" in the passage: "Ever the dim beginning, Ever the growth, the rounding of the circle, Ever the summit and merge at last, (to surely start again.)128 But even in "Chanting the Square Deific" Whitman de clared he was unwilling to fix with mathematical precision his ideas as to "the four sides . . . sustaining the Uni verse."129 Evidently, however, he did not believe in an anthropomorphic conception of God. In one of his last utterances he explained directly what he meant in his writ ings by the term "Almighty": "I use it [he wrote] of an impersonal deity, not of a being who sits on high issuing orders 'Do this or that.' But I accept it and use it in the only way that I think is consistent with great modern thought, as the grandest justification of humanity."130 His attitude towards the conflict of the day between science and religion is strongly reminiscent of his age, but is, at the same time, individual. His failure to state his philosophy with mathematical precision was deliberate; he charged his followers to found no school out of him.131 Like the scientist, he was seeking truth rather than to establish a creed or a formula, and he bent all his efforts towards making religion a living matter. As the "spinal cord" of his proposed lecture on Religion is this note: "State the object to be to release the investigation and treatment of Religion from all tyranny of authority and throw it open to the investigation of great minds, as something which is not settled but has to be taken now de novo, and carried on."132 ^Leaves of Grass, p. 4.

He re called in this connection in "An Old Man's Thought of School" the question asked about the church by George Fox: (" ... Is it this pile of brick and mortar, these dead floors, windows, rails, you call the Church? Why this is not the Church at all?the Church is living, ever living souls.)"133 But Whitman spoke as a poet, not as a lecturer or scientist. He warred neither on religion nor on science. The conflict of the two in his age with the role the poet plays in this con flict he made the subject of a little poem of six lines, "When the Full Grown Poet Came." Here he tells how Nature (Science) and the Soul (Religion) took the poet by the hand as their own, and he ends with the thought: "Then the full-grown poet stood between the two, and took each by the hand; And to-day and ever so stands, as blender, uniter, tightly holding hands, Which he will never release until he reconciles the two, And wholly and joyously blends them."134 Out of the conflict of the age, it was the poet's mission to steer clear of the bewilderment, confusion, doubts, and perplexities generated by science, and to insist on making religion a living matter. To accomplish his mission he allied himself with science, finding "the calming thought of all" "That coursing on, whate'er men's speculations, Amid the changing schools, theologies, philosophies, Amid the bawling presentations new and old, The round earth's silent vital laws, facts, modes continue."135 ^Leaves of Grass, pp. 333 ff. *Ibid.f p. 452. 5Ibid., p. 435.</page></plain_text>
