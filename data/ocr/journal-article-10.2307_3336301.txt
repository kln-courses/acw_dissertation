<plain_text><page sequence="1">reference given is to a letter of March 31st, 1981, but no addressee is indicated. It is in fact an inaccurate quotation from an opinion given by William Fagg to a London dealer about a head which was formerly in the Pitt Rivers collection-but the head in the sale was a different one, of poorer quality. Yet the Sotheby catalogue gave its provenance as "The Pitt Rivers Museum, Farnham." The compiler of the catalogue claims in a letter to me of July 4th, 1985, that he was given the wrong information. Even so, one expects a reputable auction house like Sotheby's to check the provenance and history of a piece of such pretended importance. I understand that a correction was displayed at the view be- fore the sale, but in a very inconspicuous posi- tion. The piece fetched an all-time record. One cannot help wondering whether it would have done so if it had been correctly catalogued. Caveat emptor. Frank Willett Hunterian Museum, Glasgow BELLIGERENT WOMEN? In this day and age does one really have to explain why it is offensive to be hit with John Povey's reference to "the hysterical ar- rival... in Nairobi of 16,000 mostly bellige- rent women who reduced that city to sham- bles" (First Word, February 1986)? Too bad he was bumped from his hotel room, but it seems remarkably insensitive to be so wrapped up in the big business of African art (to which he devotes his entire column) that he can dismiss the rather more urgent concerns of women from all over the world, including Africa. Eugenia W. Herbert Mount Holyoke College ART OF NORTHEASTERN ZAIRE The American Museum of Natural History is planning a traveling exhibition, to open in 1989, on the arts of the peoples of northeast- ern Zaire. While we will be focusing on the Mangbetu and Azande, we are also interested in objects from the surrounding peoples, in- cluding the Medje, Bangba (Matshaga), Man- gbele, Abarambo, Mamvu, Mayogo, Budu, and Mbuti. The American Museum of Natural History has a very large collection from this area, dat- ing mostly from 1905 to 1915. The exhibition will draw heavily on the Lang-Chapin collec- tion of 1915, which resulted from the mu- seum's Congo Expedition (1909-1915). We are interested in supplementing this material with objects from other collections. Parti- cular areas of concern are anthropomorphic and zoomorphic art, the arts of kingship, and early photographs that document material culture. However, we would like to learn of any pieces from this region, whether in these categories or not. We hope to compile a cur- rent directory of objects that will be of use to researchers. Please send information, and record photographs if possible, to me at the Depart- ment of Anthropology, American Museum of Natural History, New York, NY 10024. Enid Schildkrout books Continued from page 24 when analyzing dress, and the essay closes with a brief discussion of written and visual "information sources," their perspectives and biases, mentioning the structuralist grids applied to the topic by Roland Barthes in Sys- teme de la mode (1967). Overall, the essay is a helpful and well-considered, if under- standably by no means exhaustive, introduc- tion to the complex, fascinating, rich subject at hand. I quibble somewhat with the inclusive or at least the nondifferentiated treatment of mas- querade costuming within dress, not be- cause it is not dress but because the mas- querade provides a major conceptual division between dress that reveals, enhances, and projects an individual's persona and dress that conceals and alters a wearer's identity. This distinction is admittedly blurred in some en- sembles (e.g., a Yoruba oba wearing a beaded veil), but it is no less critical to our under- standing of African values in dress systems. The second essay, by Thieme, is entitled "Resource Materials for the Study of African Dress." It is a selective survey of general ref- erences, government publications, bibliog- raphies, theses, periodicals, HRAF (Human Relations Area Files), films, and museum col- lections. Major examples are given within each of these categories, and most standard sources are cited. It closes with a "User's Guide" to this volume. A potential problem in using any bibliogra- phy, of course, is the assumption that its sub- jects are treated fully. The compilers realize this isn't the case here, but a user might, and one could therefore develop a false sense of security. One easy way to clarify what is and what is not included is to list all periodicals indexed. Sophisticated users will then know where else to look. And in the survey of bibliog- raphies, some of those for modern Ghana are cited, but several others are not, and the coverage of other area or country bibliog- raphies is neither wholly systematic nor com- plete. Most users are unaware of absent cita- tions. One enormous category of omissions, however, is apparent and I believe regretta- ble: sources in languages other than English. Since a bibliography is designed as a research tool, it is difficult to understand why the com- pilers limited their book in this manner, ren- dering it quite inadequate for about half the nations of the continent-Mali, Ivory Coast, Gabon, and Zaire, to mention the most ob- vious, for which most literature is written in French. European scholars not infrequently remark on the linguistic insularity and the consequent limitations of American research. "English-only" bibliographies on important global subjects like dress only perpetuate their justifiable criticism and our untenable provinciality. So, while this bibliography can indeed be useful, its compilers might well want to consider a "volume III" that picks up the thousands of important references on dress in French, German, Portuguese and other languages. Herbert M. Cole University of California, Santa Barbara AFRICAN AESTHETICS The Carlo Monzino Collection Susan Mullin Vogel The Center for African Art, New York, 1986. xvii + 228 pp., 140 blw &amp; 148 color photos, map, bibli- ography, index. $39 paper. African Aesthetics catalogues the collection of Carlo Monzino, whose commitment to the arts began at the early age of 21. In his intro- duction we read of his first acquisitions, in- cluding works by Jackson Pollock and Francis Bacon as well as sculptures from Pre- Columbian, Oceanic, and ancient Mediterra- nean cultures. All these beautiful things, he observed, complemented each other, and there was no need to separate them by area. In other words, each object held its own against fine works of art from other traditions. Monzino lived through the exciting years of collecting African art in the 1950s and 1960s. He looks back on it as an adventure, recalling meeting the widow of the great artist and col- lector Jacob Epstein or spending time with Charles Ratton in search of African pieces. His love for the art and the process of acquiring it comes through in the lively and informal, yet moving, introduction, written in Italian. (I thank Laura Lewis Meyer, Research Assistant to the Director of the Saint Louis Art Mu- seum, for her translation.) In presentation African Aesthetics recalls monumental publications of the 1950s such as African Sculpture by Elisofon and Fagg (1958), to which it is identical in size (11" by 13") and format. As in the earlier publication, the arts are presented by culture from West to East Af- rica, beginning with Dogon art. And again, the photographs, in this case by Mario Car- rieri, are a wonderful strength. The straightforward treatment, without the dra- matic use of light, allows us to study the beauty of the works. Background colors high- light patination and details, which are as- tonishingly clear. Overall the photographic resolution is unchallenged. The layout reads easily, with photos conveniently arranged. Many of the works published in the 1958 book reappear here, including the great Dogon hermaphrodite sculpture (Vogel's no. 6, Fagg's no. 14) and several Fang pieces that belonged to Epstein. Additionally a number of works, for instance the Nomoli figure (no. 23) and the Senufo rhythm pounder (no. 18), are remarkably similar to Fagg's selections (nos. 72-73, 96). It is interesting to compare the two books' presentation of the Fang sculp- ture known as the "Black Venus," formerly in the Epstein collection. Both offer four full- length illustrations of the piece. However, whereas in the older publication all four photographs appear on facing pages, in the current work there are different-scaled photos on four successive pages so that one cannot as easily compare the various views of the sculpture. Further, the cropping of some of the plates is annoying. On the whole, how- ever, African Aesthetics presents a visual feast. As with the introductory essay in the 1958 book, this one, by Vogel, establishes an aesthetic theory that may be applied to the fine selections that follow in the catalogue sec- 78</page></plain_text>
