<plain_text><page sequence="1">EAST BALTIC AMBER IN THE FOURTH AND THIRD MILLENNIA B.C. Marija Gimbutas, University of California, Los Angeles This article will discuss Baltic amber during the peak period of its processing by the Narva culture and the startling growth of the amber trade from about 3500 to 2500 B.C. It will also touch on the problem of the dis- appearance of that manufacturing and trade after the infiltration of the Indo-European people (the Globular Amphora-Corded Pottery culture) into the east Baltic area and central Russia, c. 2500-2000 B.C. Thousands of amber beads, pendants, anthropomorphic, ornithomorphic, and zoomorphic sculptures, as well as countless unfinished pieces and waste bits were discovered in recently excavated habitation sites of the Narva culture throughout Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and northwestern Russia. From the sites in eastern Latvia, around Lake Lubānas alone, 19,193 pieces of amber were counted,1 even though the Lubānas Lake is more than 350 km in a straight line from the main source of amber along the Lithuanian artd Latvian sea coast. Similar quantities of artifacts were found in the sites near the Baltic coast. Before the systematic excavations of peat bog sites near the Baltic Sea, such as Sventoji (Lithuania), Sãrnate (Latvia), and Abora, Nainiekste, Piestiņa and other sites around Lake Lubānas, amber artifacts were mostly from mixed collections and of unknown cultural contexts. The Discovery and Largest Deposits The list published in 1882 of 434 amber artifacts, consisting of beads, pendants, and anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figurines from Juodkranté in Kuršiiļ Nerija (Courish Spit), west Lithuania, by Klebs, aroused con- siderable international interest in amber.2 That collection and a collection of 153 ornaments from Palanga (western Lithuania) acquired by Count Tyszkiewicz and donated to the museum of Kretinga (western Lithuania) served for more than half a century as the main source of information on JBS, VoL XVI, No, 3 (Fall 1985) 231</page><page sequence="2">232 Journal of Baltie Studies the prehistoric amber of the east Baltic area. Neither collection was a closed find and both included objects from two very different cultures: the Narva and Corded Pottery. The Juodkranté collection had been unearthed by an excavator at depths of 6-1 1 m and consisted of artifacts which apparently had been washed out from several habitation sites by a stream which had previously brought them together. The circumstances surrounding the discovery of the Palanga treasure are not known. Since then, the 1966-1976 excavations of Narva and Corded Pottery sites at Sventoji (15 km north of Palanga, about 1 km from the Baltic Sea) yielding many thousands of amber waste bits, finished beads, pendants, rings, medallions, and figurines,3 have equaled in importance the finds from the Sārnate peat bog site in western Latvia- excavated in 1949-1 959-- where 378 amber ornaments were found.4 Finally, fifteen sites discovered in the plain of Lake Lubānas have further demonstrated the intensity of amber produc- tion in this region:6 several sites near Lake Lubānas yielded incredible amounts of amber.6 Current excavations around Lake Kretuonas, in eastern Lithuania, have also begun to provide comparable information. In- vestigation of sites far from the Baltic coast has shown that amber processing was not restricted to that specific zone, but that it was an occupation common to the settled Narva fishermen living in a radius of 300-400 km from the source area (Fig. 1). The Chronology The indigenous East Baltic culture is known to have continued from the Mesolithic or "Kunda" stage, related to the Magiemose culture of north- western Europe, into the Neolithic or "Narva" stage, a Pottery Neolithic culture of settled fishermen. Occasional amber artifacts are known from the Mesolithic era, but amber workshops and the mass production of arti- facts date from the final phase of the Narva culture- contemporaneous with the Volosovo culture in central Russia and the Globular Amphora culture in east central Europe. Finally, it was superseded by the Corded Pottery people, the succesors to the Globular Amphora people. The graphed series of radiocarbon dates from the Narva, Comb-marked Pottery, and Cord Pottery sites show that around 2500 B.C., or somewhat later, the cultural situation changed drastically: the Narva people, who had coexisted alongside the Comb-marked Pottery and Corded Pottery people for some time, disappeared completely at the end of the third millennium B.C., apparently having been gradually assimilated by the Corded Pottery people; gone also were the Combed-marked Pottery people who had prob- ably met the same fate or retreated to the north (see Table). Amber Artifacts of the Narva Type The amber products produced both within and outside the limits of the distribution of the Narva culture are remarkably uniform. Cylindrical and button-shaped beads and schematically rendered anthropomorphic pendants are particularly characteristic. The Narva repertory also included owl- masked anthropomorphic effigies, figurines of water birds, snakes, bears,</page><page sequence="3">East Baltic Amber 233 elk, and hedgehogs.

Narva tradition. perforation are most numerous, and their distribution reached far beyond the borders of the Narva culture. The cylindrical beads had a diameter no greater than 1 cm, but varied in length from 1 to 4 cm (Fig. 2). Many partially completed and broken specimens were unearthed in Sventoji, Sārnate, and other sites. These unfinished or fragmented items provide insight into the method of their production: first, pieces of the desired shape were neatly polished on both ends and then the diverging perforations were drilled; only after the perforations were successfully bored was the surface of the bead polished. A different order of procedure was followed in the pro- duction of button-shaped beads which are variously round, oval, rectangular, or quadrangular (Fig. 3); a rare, elaborate form is boat-shaped. The under- side of the head is flat or convex, while the upper surface is convex or conical (Fig. 4). The semi-complete pieces show that chosen pieces of amber were first shaped and then polished, the upper surface more carefully than the base whose edge was occasionally notched. The perforations were bored after the polishing, unfortunately often resulting in many broken beads (Fig. 3, 14). That V-perforated objects were beads rather than buttons is shown by strands found in graves: for instance, the string of round and quadrangular beads in a burial at Abora I, Lubānas lowland.7 Annular and globular beads also occur, but not en masse like the two principal types.</page><page sequence="6">236 Journal of Baltic Studies Fig. 3 Button-shaped Beads with V-perforation IS, 11, 13, 14, Sàrnate, western Latvia, Narva culture; 9, 10&gt; Abora I, Lubāna plain; 12, Šventoji II, western Lithuania. 9, 10, 12 ; Narva tradition, Corded Pottery period.</page><page sequence="7">East Baltic Amber 237 Fig. 4 Necklace of Various Size Button-shaped Beads Abora I, Lubānas plain, Latvia.</page><page sequence="8">238 Journal of Baltie Studies (b) Anthropomorphic figurines The most clearly defined anthropomorphic figurines come from Juodkranté, from the Klebs collection. Three unbroken figures and one head (a fragment?) are characterized by owlish facial features (Fig. 5): that is, the flat face with its triangular contours, best seen on the largest specimen, shows that the effigies were portrayed as masked (i.e., the human face was covered by the mask of an owl), much like many western and southeast European representations of the owl-masked goddess. The body is very schematically rendered, with legs and arms only suggested. The perfora- tions under the arms of the larger specimens and at the base of a smaller one indicate that the effigies may have been originally attached to something else. Fig. 5 Anthropomorphic Amber Figurines with a Mask of an Owl (Representing an Old European Owl Goddess of Death and Regeneration?) Juodkranté, Kuràiy Nerija (Courish spit), western Lithuania. Narva culture. Most probable date: late fourth millennium B.C. The nose/beak configuration connecting the arched eyebrows of the amber figurines is identical to that of wooden idols discovered at Šventoji and Sārnate (Fig. 6). Most probably, both groups represent the same divine image, in my opinion, that of the Owl Goddess of Old Europe: the Bird Goddess in her aspect of Death and Regeneration, well-known from the megalithic tombs of France and Spain. The image of this goddess also occurs on urns found in east central Europe (Baden culture) and in the northern Aegean (Poliochni) and Troy, dating from approximately 3000 B.C. An isolated figurine from what was formerly East Prussia (probably the Königsberg region, present-day Kaliningrad) has an enormous pubic triangle covering the entire front torso. The head is schematic, with eyes and nose</page><page sequence="9">East Baltic Amber 239 indicated by perforations (Fig. 7). This configuration may also represent the Regeneration divinity: in southeastern Europe and the Aegean area, such schematic nude females with an exaggerated vulva- dating from the fifth to the third millennia B.C.- are a stereotype linked to the idea of regeneration, which I have termed the "stiff" or "chrysalid" type.8 Although other figurines approximating human shape are either too schematized or too crude to yield to classification, the oblong trapezoidal or oval pendants with one or two perforations through the top were obviously geometric forms reduced from anthropomorphic shapes.

Kaliningrad (Königsberg) region, Samland Peninsula. Isolated find, probably Narva culture, fourth millennium B.C. (e) Trapezoidal and oval pendants Pieces of amber with accidental resemblances to human shape seem to have been deliberately chosen for the production of trapezoidal and oval pendants (Figs. 8 and 9). Many trapezoidal pendants have a concave base that vaguely indicates the legs (Fig. 9, 6-9). Occasionally, rows of pits or dots around the edges decorate the pendant, and double rows of dots divide it horizontally into three sections as if to mark the separation of head, torso, and legs (Fig. 9, 12-15). On one specimen from Kuräiq Nerija, the arms are indicated by dotted lines (Fig. 8, 1). Some of the oval pendants have a protrusion on top, apparently representing the head. (d) Water bird figurines Figurines of aquatic birds, some clearly ducks or geese, have been discovered in a number of Narva sites (Sārnate, Iča, Nainiekste, Zvidzienas- krogs). The illustrated bird pendants from Latvia (Fig. 10, 1-3 ) resemble the small effigy from B0lling Su, Denmark, with its long neck, marked beak and goose-like body (Fig. 11). The most naturalistically portrayed ducks and geese, known from Sámate, Šventoji and other sites, are of wood, the head and neck forming the handles of a ladle, with the body of the bird constituting the bowl. The bird figurines of amber conform to those carved of bone or antler, over thirty of which are known from Latvia. The con- siderable number of aquatic bird representations and the carving of such birds in amber speaks of their importance in myth and cult. Duck, geese, and other water fowl were apparently regarded as incarnations of the Bird Goddess, as they were in southeastern and central Europe. The role of these birds as the personification of Fate (Laima) is well-recorded in Lithuanian and Latvian folklore.</page><page sequence="11">East Baltic Amber 241 Fig. 8 Possibly Anthropomorphic Figurine with Arms Indicated by Dots (1) and Oval Pendants ¿ 3) 1, Kuràiy Nerij a, western Lithuania; 2 ; 3 , Svento] i I, western Lithuania and Dzedziekste, Lubānas plain, eastern Latvia.

At Abora I, two specimens appeared in a child's burial, one of them a double snake (Fig. 12, 2). The placement of snakes in burials indicates their importance in beliefs of regeneration- beliefs still held today in the sub-culture of the Baltic area. (f) Zoomorphic figurines The miniature head of an elk from Sámate- its muzzle, nostrils, lower lip, ears, and neck quite naturalistically portrayed- is of unusual craftsman- ship (Fig. 10, 4), equalling in quality the execution of the elk head on an antler staff from Šventoji10 and that in stone from Huittis, Finland.11 A less fully articulated head with a perforation in the neck, probably also of an elk, is known from the Juodkranté collection.

All the known carved elk heads from the Narva culture as well as from the Volosovo culture of central Russia are without antlers (that is, portraying female elk). The symbolic significance of the female animal to the culture is indicated by these portrayals, as is the case with the Karanovo clay sculptures of obviously pregnant does from the sixth and fifth millennia B.C.12</page><page sequence="13">East Baltic Amber 243 Fig. 10 Water-birds {1-3), Elk Doe (4), Bear (5), Hedgehog?

Narva tradition but contemporary with Corded Pottery culture. Bear sculptures in northern Europe are of as early a period as the Magiemose culture in Denmark (cf. the amber bear from Resen, marked with symbolic signs).13 The amber bear from Gdansk, a beautiful piece of plastic art,14 is an isolated find that most likely belongs to the Narva tradition. Another amber bear comes from Tamula, Estonia,15 and a frag- ment of a bear quite similar to the Gdansk bear was found in Sãrnate (Fig. 10, 5). The masterful sculptures of bears and the symbolic markings on them suggest that this animal played no less a role in myth and ritual than the she-elk. The sculptures in amber of a horse, from Dobiegniewo (formerly Woldenburg), and of a boar, from Slupsk (formerly Stolp) in Pomerania, are of unknown origins. However, they seem to belong to either the indigenous Baltic tradition or to the Globular Amphora culture which supplanted it.16 One small animal figurine with a short, triangular head and a rounded body, from Šventoji, may represent a hedgehog (Fig. 10, 6). A number of other zoomorphic figurines are too schematic to be identified. A survey of the repertory of amber artifacts produced by the indigenous inhabitants of the east Baltic region shows that most of what was carved in amber, except the beads, had a symbolic or ritual purpose. Clearly of religious significance are the images of the Owl-faced Goddess, the sacred ducks and geese, the she-elk, bear, snakes, «md the hedgehog. Even the schematized anthropomorphic pendants may have served as amulets. The symbolism of the Narva culture as reflected in amber artifacts and carvings of wood,</page><page sequence="15">East Baltic Amber 245 bone, antler, and stone parallels that of the rest of Europe, particularly western Europe, in the corresponding period; it also is clearly Old European and has no connection with Indo-European ideology. Since the mesolithic (Kunda) and neolithic (Narva) cultures of the east Baltic were genetic descendants of the Final Magdalenian culture of western Europe, as were the closely related mesolithic and neolithic cultures of northwestern Europe, such similarities are not surprising. The Distribution and Trade of Narva Amber The Narva-type amber artifacts, mostly trapezoidal pendants and the V-perforated, button-shaped, and cylindrical beads, spread for thousands of kilometers in all directions. They are found in Finland and Karelia, even on the coast of the White Sea in the north, in the graves and habitation sites of the Volosovo culture in the upper Volga basin to the east, and in the graves of the Globular Amphora culture of central Poland to the south (Fig. 1). The trade routes can be traced by the large number of sites yielding Narva amber in these distant regions and in the areas between northern and central Russia and the Baltic Sea. It is logical to assume that most of the amber export originated in the area of intensive manufacture, that is, Lithuania and Latvia. The almost identical types of amber artifacts in all these areas bear out this assumption. One of the amber trade routes went north to Finland along the Baltic Sea. This route is obvious from the map of the distribution of sites con- taining amber, where the densest distribution is found in western Lithuania and Latvia near the coast. From the coastal zone amber spread eastwards via the large rivers and their tributaries and from there through the glacial lakes surrounding Lithuania and Latvia to the east. The Daugava River (Russ. Zapadnaia Dvina) must have served as the main artery of trans- mission to the upper Volga basin where Narva-type amber finds occur in sites of Volosovo culture: Ilovets, district of Kalinin, and Sakhtysh VIII, district of Ivanov. Another route, bifurcating from the Daugava, led to northwestern Russia and Karelia. The location in this region of 35 sites containing amber suggests that much of the traffic followed the Lovať and Kunia rivers, Lake liman, as well as the Volkhov, Msta, Mologa, and Sheksna rivers as far as the White Sea.17 Some of the northern sites yielded amazing quantities of finished products. A collection of 267 pieces consisting of trapezoidal and oval pendants, and cylindrical and button- shaped beads came to light as early as 1903 at Konchanskoe on the River Msta, district of Novgorod.18 The Konchanskoe cemetery, re-excavated by Zimina in 1974, produced several thousand amber artifacts.19 This and other cemeteries with amber finds in the area belong to the Volosovo culture. Another large collection has been gathered from Kargulino on the River Sheksna, east of Lake Onega.20 Trapezoidal pendants, including specimens decorated with a double line of dots, as well as cylindrical and ring-shaped beads, were found in Globular Amphora sites (3400-2900 B.C.) in northern and central Poland (Fig. 13).</page><page sequence="16">246 Journal of Baltie Studies Fig. 13 Trapezoid Pendants; Cylindrical, Button-shaped, and Axe-shaped Beads; and Ring-shaped Medallions of Amber Found in Globular Amphora Culture Graves I-li, Šwierczynek, distr. of Radziejów; 12, 13 ; Skoczka, distr. of Szubin; 15-22, Brzežno, distr. of Chojnice {all in Poland). V-perf orated, round, and square button-shaped beads were found in large quantities in the Zfota cemetery in southern Poland at a site belonging to the Ziota variant of the late Globular Amphora culture (Fig. 14). Amber artifacts similar to those from Globular Amphora sites were found in such western Lithuanian sites as Juodkranté, Patanga, and Sventoji, indicating a direct route to the Kuršiy Nerij a between Poland and the Baltic sea via the lower Vistula and the seaboard. The Transformation of Symbolism of Amber Artifacts by the Globular Amphora-Corded Pottery People The ideological change reflected in some of the shapes and in the decora- tion of amber artifacts resulted from the growing interest in amber taken by the Globular Amphora people of the Vistula basin. At first, the Globular Amphora people collected and cherished imported Narva products- cylindrical, round, and square button-shaped beads with V-perforation and trapeze-shaped pendants- but soon the appearance of medallions and ring or disc pendants marked the beginning of a changed symbolism (Fig. 15). Disc-shaped medallions, frequently decorated with dots around the edges or crossed rows of dots in the center, are found in important male graves of the Globular Amphora stone cists. This decoration, an example of solar</page><page sequence="17">East Baltic Amber 247 Fig. 14 Square and Round, Button-shaped Amber Beads with V-perf oration Grave in Zfota cemetery, southern Poland. Transition from Globular Amphora to Corded Pottery, c. 3000-2800 B.C. symbolism, was consistently repeated on amber discs and even on button- shaped beads, as well as on round plaques of bone or antler. In the south- eastern Baltic, cross-marked amber discs and round, convex beads are known from the Juodkrantè collection, from Šventoji II, and other sites of the Baltic Haff culture which succeeded the Narva culture (Figs. 16, 17). An exceptional disc from the grave of a rich, Globular-Amphora male in Volynia, engraved with a solar emblem on one side, a schematic human figure with upraised arms and an animal (probably a horse) on the other, incorporates the characteristic Indo-European sun and horse symbolism</page><page sequence="18">248 Journal of Baltic Studies (Fig. 18). Amber rings and discs with a solar design have never been found in any of the Narva sites preceding the infiltration of the Globular Amphora- Corded Pottery pastoralists into the east Baltic area. They are also absent from the contemporary Volosovo culture which predates the Faťianovo (Corded Pottery) settlement in central Russia.

The Globular Amphora culture, on the other hand» was typically Indo- European in social structure and ideology. The people were semi-nomadic pastoralists, patrilinear, and warlike. Their principal gods were male, mounted warriors; their chief divinity was the God of the Shining Sky, a personification of the light of the sky and the sun, well-known from comparative Indo-European mythology and linguistics. The earliest archae- ological monuments in Europe bearing symbolism of this divinity are the stelae in the Alpine region, c. 3000 B.C., engraved with concentric circles (representing the head of a god), double spirals, semi-circular breast-plates of parallel lines, and daggers, halberds, stags, and horses.21 The Indo- European sky god is documented by the earliest historic records and</page><page sequence="19">East Baltic Amber 249 Fig. 16 Amber Buttons Decorated with Solar Motif (Cross and Concentric Circle) 1, Šventoji II; 2, 3, Juodkranté, western Lithuania.

Moreover, he is linguistically preserved in various Indo-European languages: Baltic (from earlier *Deivasy *dei'ios)' German *Tiwas (also from *dei%os)' the Indie Mitra; the Roman Dius Fidius, Janus, and Mars; and the Celtic Lug (called "Sun Faced"), which represents such various aspects of the divinity as the "shining" image of incandescent sky that was in- separable from the sun, vegetation, and the four seasons of the year. The pastoralists' fascination with sunlight prompted the symbolic significance attributed to amber- thus an amber disc became symbolic of the sun. Amber is "shining as the sun," we hear from Homer; "amber was elektron, " the energy of the sun, we learn from the Greeks; and amber has the healing properties of the sun, which is still believed by Lithuanians and Latvians. In prehistory an amber disc was undoubtedly regarded as imbued with the divine power of the God of the Shining Sky and was considered a special ornament appropriate to a king, chief, hero, or warrior. The Globular Amphora people moved north and northeast, assimilating the indigenous population with each advance. They occupied successively Pomerania, the lower Vistula basin, and the territory of present-day north- eastern Poland as far as the Masurian lakes in the east. During the final phase of the culture (coeval with the Zibta phase in southern Poland), they probably reached the Samland Peninsula and the Courish Spit. Having ar- rived at the source of amber, they could themselves collect the raw amber or obtain it, both unfinished and carved, from the experienced amber manufacturers of the indigenous population under their control. By approximately 2500 B.C., the process of assimilation- the Indo- Europeanization of the Narva population- was more or less complete in the amber-producing area. A new culture, the so-called "Baltic Haff" (Ger. Haffküstenkultur ) emerged, a hybrid of the Narva and late Globular Amphora-early Corded Pottery cultures. Much from the Narva culture was retained in the economy (the predominance of fishing), in the architecture (building of above-ground houses), and, of course, in the manufacture of amber. Fishing villages around the lakes continued to produce considerable numbers of amber artifacts, some in the Narva tradition (cylindrical beads, button-shaped beads, trapezoidal pendants), some in the new Indo-European tradition (rings, medallions, ring-shaped pendants on long stems). A number of the Baltic Haff sites are situated in the same locales as those of the Narva culture, suggesting the continuity of the indigenous population converted to a new ideology. Ornithomorphic, zoomorphic, and anthropomorphic figurines and trapezoidal pendants markedly diminished in number, and some of these forms completely disappeared. Snakes and occasionally birds and bears continued to be produced in Latvia and Estonia where the Narva substratum preserved its identity longer than in northern Poland and western Lithuania. The traditional amber products were gradually replaced by discs, large or small rings, and rings on stems (Fig. 19). Axe-shaped (in imitation of battle-axes with a drooping blade) and tooth-shaped beads appeared (Fig. 20); these were novel forms, absent from the Narva context and serving as amulets or prestige objects. Incisor teeth of wolves, dogs</page><page sequence="22">252 Journal of Baltic Studies or boars- typical finds in Corded Pottery and Jamna graves- were probably assumed to possess the magical power of those animals, which were sacred to the God of the Shining Sky. Not surprisingly, the teeth of these sacred animals were reproduced in precious amber. Discs, rings, annular and tooth-shaped beads, as well as button-shaped and cylindrical beads spread in the second half of the third millennium B.C. to the areas where the Corded Pottery people settled, that is, the upper Volga basin (the spread of the Fat'ianovo culture), the upper Dnieper basin (the Dnieper variant of the Corded Pottery culture), and the Pripet and upper Dniester basins (the Volynian variant of the Corded Pottery culture)- Fig. 1. Amber discs and stemmed rings were found exclusively in wealthy, probably royal male graves. An example of the abundance in which such items were found is the Moshka grave under a round barrow ( kurgan ), located near Khodosovichi, upper Dnieper. In addition to an amber ring pendant on a stem, the grave contained double-spiral copper pendants placed in a birch bark box, a bronze shaft-hole axe and, among other finds, a bronze spearhead, heart-shaped flint arrowheads, and a beaker.22 The ring pendant has close parallels in the east Baltic area, and the royal Moshka tomb is considered coeval with the Abora I site- where such stemmed amber rings were found- dated by radiocarbon dating to 2620-2165 B.C. (cf. Table, Nos. 32-34). Fig. 19 Amber Rings and Pendants 1, 2, 4-7, Abora I; 3, Eiņi.

Ring pendants and V-perforated, button-shaped beads were obtained through trade by the Bell Beaker people, cultural cousins of the Corded Pottery people. Carried by this mobile group, amber diffused over western, central, and southern Europe.23 The button-shaped beads with a V-shaped perforation, some decorated with a solar emblem, were especially cherished. In the areas distant from sources of amber, such beads were commonly made of antler, bone, jet, and other materials. After the Bell Beaker period (c. 2600-2200 B.C. in corrected radiocarbon chronology) the production of</page><page sequence="24">254 Journal of Baltic Studies button-shaped beads tapered off. Thus, a long-lasting tradition inherited from the Narva culture came to an end, and amber manufacture in the east Baltic countries declined. During the Bronze and the Early Iron Age, raw amber was transported to central and southern Europe as during Imperial Roman times. The Unetician and Mycenaean graves are sometimes known to contain an incredible number of amber beads, whereas the contemporary sites along the amber coasts have yielded only a very modest number of beads and no evidence of intensive local amber manufacture. Conclusions Intensive amber manufacture in the east Baltic area was an occupation of the settled fishermen of the Nav ra culture in the period 3500-2500 B.C. The processing of amber is in evidence not only along the amber-producing southeastern Baltic coastline but also in the territories 300 to 400 km from the Baltic sea. Finished amber products of the Narva type- trapezoidal pendants, cylindrical and button-shaped beads with a V-perforation- diffused through the exchange of goods to the White Sea in the north, central Russia in the east, and southern Poland in the south. The trade routes went north along the Baltic Sea coast to Finland and via a net of rivers and lakes to the east and south. In addition to ornaments, amber artifacts of the Narva type consisted of a series of effigies representing mythical characters: the owl-masked deity, duck, geese, elk, bear, and hedgehog- characters which conform to the mythical imagery of western Europe and to that of Old Europe in general; a gallery, in my opinion, entirely pre-Indo-European. A change in the type and symbolism of the amber artifacts followed the gradual infiltrations by the first Indo-Europeans (the Globular Amphora pastoralists) and their successors (the Corded Pottery people), and their gradual assimilation of the indigenous population. The repertory of amber products changed: medallions and large rings, tooth- and battle-axe-shaped beads appeared; genuine, Narva-type artifacts diminished and slowly dis- appeared. Thus, the great Narva tradition of manufacture and exchange came to an end.
