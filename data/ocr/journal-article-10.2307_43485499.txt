Frontal, with enlarged breasts, pubic region, and thighs, and with small, inarticulate head and arms, she has been understood as a fundamental sign of an archaic belief system centered around concerns with clan origins, fertility, death, and renewal.1 Beginning several decades ago and accelerating in recent years, there has emerged a virtual industry in the study of the Paleolithic woman's descendants.2 For the most part, these studies have drawn on traditions supported by written texts from the ancient Near East and Egypt, from the European pre-Christian world, and from India. By contrast, the artistic traditions of Siberia and northern Central Asia,3 unsupported by contempo- raneously recorded texts, present a blank wall for one who would try to understand the evolution of the female image through the Neolithic period, the Bronze Age, and into the early Iron Age. It is true, of course, that little relevant material in three-dimensional sculptural form survives from those per- iods and that vast region.4 Our primary representational sculptural traditions from the two thousand years of the late pre-Bronze, Bronze, and early Iron Ages are petroglyphs; that is, images carved on stone. Rendered on thousands of surfaces comprising hundreds of thousands of representations, these images would appear to offer an extraordinary archive for one who would trace the transformation of the Siberian image of the woman since the Paleolithic period. But where one would expect a wealth of material one finds only silence: to judge from the many studies of Siberian and northern Central Asian petroglyphs, the image of the woman essentially disappeared after the Paleolithic period, her place taken by hunters and warriors, by herdsmen, and by horned or masked images so often referred to as 'shamans/ Lonely exceptions are the occa- sional representations of women said to be in the act of child- birth ('birthing women') or women as part of what is euphe- mistically referred to as an 'erotic pair.' Perhaps relevant imagery has simply disappeared, the inadvertant victim of time and the seasons. But there also remains the possibility that the images of women have been considered too lacking in interest to be recorded by resear- chers working in the field. The clumsy frontal figures, many with legs drawn up as if in childbirth, others characterized by a graceless and static frontality, may have simply been set aside in the process of copying thousands of images in various states of disintegration.5 Their ungainly forms appear to resist the attribution of artistic value and to thwart a rigorous dating by style. In the following pages, I will use petroglyphic imagery from the Altay Mountains of Central Asia6 to argue that the image of several significant and probably related female types emerged well before the period referred to as Bronze Age: that is, ear- lier than representations of social organization and pastora- lism. These types continued into a much later date, across the second and well into the first millennia b.c.e. Their character and quality indicate the persistence of a significant female ele- ment within the native belief systems of cultures spanning approximately 2000-3000 years. On the basis, also, of mate- rials gathered in recent field seasons and hitherto unpublish- ed,7 I will propose that the female image was actually far more significant a part of Bronze and early Iron Age art than published studies to date would lead us to believe. It is possible to propose that 'she' was associated with ideas and signs of regeneration, such as birds, feathers, and birth; and with wild deer and cattle and with the success of the hunt. I will argue that these female figures may be dated provisionally by a consideration of the images which surround or overlay them; they, in turn, radically amplify our understanding of contem- porary cultural impulses. I will also propose that the relative paucity of female imagery in existing documentation may have less to say about actuality and more about perception: it may indicate a lack of attention by those who have undertaken the study of Central Asian and South Siberian petroglyphs and a lack of interest in what frequently appears to be primitive rather than heroic, a static sign rather than a vital figure. The petroglyphic site of Kalbak Tash I is relatively small but it includes some of the oldest and most interesting carved images to be found in the Altay Republic.8 Among these the most striking are representations of large, frontal women.9 Arts Asiatiques, tome 52-1997 37</page><page sequence="2">Fig. 1. Images of 'bird-women,' and maral Horizontal surface, section II, Kalbak Tash I. (From Kubarev and Jacobson, 1996: fig. 196). Fig. 1. Images de femmes-oiseaux' et maral. Surface horizontale, section II, Kalbak-Tash I. (D'après Kubarev et Jacobson, 1996: fig. 196). Despite variations in details, these images are consistently characterized in the same fashion: each is carved frontally, with large body, a clearly demarcated pubic area, a small tri- angulated head, and arms and hands raised as if in invocation (fig. 1). Almost all the images have a skirt-like treatment of their lower bodies where one would anticipate seeing legs. This area is usually vertically striped, in effect recalling the spread tail feathers of a large raptor.10 On many of the images, feather-like elements extend from the sides of their bodies, reaffirming their possible bird associations. Monumental in appearance and often impressive in size, the images are peck- ed out in deep, large grooves; the size of the pecked marks and the considerably worn aspect of the images suggest consider- able age. These several aspects together with the peculiar combination of large body, small head, and pronounced pubic area confirm the archaic character of these women: their asso- ciation with a pre-Bronze Age cultural level. Their bird-like characteristics and their arms and hands raised on either side of their heads suggest their reference to a non-human realm. The frontal 'bird-women' of Kalbak-Tash have few clear analogies within the hitherto recorded petroglyphs of Central Asia and South Siberia.11 The only published parallels come from the Chuluut River (Chuluutyn-gol) complex in north-cen- tral Mongolia.12 These images vary somewhat from the Kal- bak-Tash females: their bodies above the tail-like 'skirt' are either tapered downward or reduced to one or a few lines13; there is no indication of the pubic region; and although the 'skirt' is striped, as if feathered, there is no feathering on the body. On the other hand, the small triangular heads, the raised arms and hands, and the determined frontality of the images indicate a probable identity of reference with the Kalbak-Tash female images. In the course of our field work on the complex Tsagaan Salaa and Baga Oigor (hereafter: TS/BO), in Mongolia's north- west Bayan Ölgiy aimag, we have documented at least two other images which may well be analogous to the Kalbak-Tash bird-women.14 One of these images, at BO II, is rendered in a worn and shallow-pecked silhouette (fig. 10). She is frontal and large in body, as if wearing a full dress; her arms are raised on either side of her small head. This figure lacks the particular treatment of the pubic region and the avian characteristics of the Kalbak-Tash images; but the muted character of her car- ving and her unusual form are suggestive of a reference that Fig. 2.

A second image has now been recorded at BO III, at the base of a vertical rocky face, itself blackened and shiny in appearance. Worn and ob- scure to the point of near invisibility, the image reveals itself to close inspection as a frontal female figure, 12 cm. in height, with small head, a kind of high collar around her long neck, long arms raised to either side of her head, and a squared lower body or dress. Although she appears to be the oldest image on that section of the rock face, above her may be found two archaic images of maralukha; moreover, this section of BO III appears to include some of the most ancient of all images in the TS/BO complex.17 By placement and technique, the Kalbak-Tash images may be associated with a number of carved elements which clarify probable chronological layers and cultural relationships. Beside or facing several of the female images are profile, anthropomorphic figures.18 With bent legs and, in some cases ithyphallic characteristics, these forms clearly refer to males; their position on either side of the women and their raised arms suggest an attitude of invocation or of reverential saluta- tion.19 A similar type of ithyphallic male occurs, also, beside the Chuluutyn-gol figures, although there the males are rendered in a style more compatible with the female figures they attend.20 Other peculiar elements are associated with the Kalbak-Tash bird- women by location and carving technique, as well as by their similarly worn quality. These include a curious grate-like object, often rendered with feather-like appendages, and a frontal figure with large feathered wings (figs. 4, 5). 21 The confident carving of the grate-like elements and their association by carving and juxtaposition with the bird-women images make it all the more puzzling that we have not, as yet, any analogous objects from other Central Asian or South Siberian petroglyphs. The winged figures, on the other hand, do have analogies on the slabs recovered from the late aeneolithic or early Bronze Age burials at Karakol, in the Altay Republic.22 No analogous images from Chuluutyn-gol have been published.23 Placement, carving techniques, and a similarly worn aspect indicate that the bird- women, the profile 'men,' the 'flying grates,' and the winged figures at Kalbak-Tash all belong to the same cultural and chronological horizon. Absent from those image groups are elements often understood to be indicative of the full Bronze Age: patently human figures, carts, scenes of nomadizing and hunting. In other words, the archaic images are not included in any scenes that reflect a human social context. Moreover, by their execution and loca- Arts Asiatiques, tome 52-1997 39</page><page sequence="4">Fig. 4.

These figures are most often characterized by a mushroom-shaped hat; they frequently carry a bow or a spear and wear a distinctive bulbous 'fanny pack,' or waist pack. They are almost always represented in a profile or three-quar- ter view; the scenes in which they predominantly appear include ceremonial activities, the moving of households with pack animals; or they appear in scenes which suggest social activities and social well-being (fig. 6). 24 These figures never appear in scenes associated with horse or camel-riding. They are represented-and frequently-in scenes of hunts after ani- mals (moose, bear, boar) which have long-since disappeared from the regions in question. Moreover, within the composi- tions in which they appear, wild and domesticated animals are unaffected by the particular stylization associated with the Arzhan, Tagar, or Pazyryk traditions of the first millennium B.c.E.25 We may argue that these 'mushroom-hatted' figures reflect a culture previous to that of the Early Nomads but no earlier than the emergence of wheeled vehicles and pastora- lism.26 It follows, therefore, that the bird-women of Kalbak- Tash are yet earlier, belonging to a cultural horizon not later than the early second millennium b.c.e. There are, however, several image types with which the bird-women are associated. By far the most frequent is that of 'maral'. or 'maralukha.'27 Represented as frequently by the female as by the male, these large animals are invariably ren- dered with a powerful, even monumental realism. Typically they are shown in a two legged profile, usually (but not always) facing to the right, with large body, head raised or slightly lowered. In many cases, it is clear that a large maral has been carved over an earlier female image (e.g., fig. 5). 28 In other cases, it is virtually impossible to determine which was carved first, woman or maral,29 and in several cases, the female figure appears to have been carved over an earlier maral image.30 However, maral are not the only wild animals asso- ciated with the archaic women. In several panels character- ized by a complex overcarving, maral and frontal women are associated with aurochs (i.e. wild cattle, bos primigenius ) and wild caprids (e.g., figs. 3, 7). 31 These instances suggest that the aurochs could occur with the female image, albeit less fre- quently than with the maral. In all cases, however, the animals are similarly represented: in profile, with a monumental real- ism, and without any indication of psychological interaction. They adhere to the hieratic formality exemplified by the women; but where the latter are strange, disturbing, even ungainly, the animals are endowed with a monumental, even magnificent, realism. To date, no recorded Central Asian complexes have offered certain analogies to either this combination of elements (women, maral, aurochs) or to a comparably tangled over- laying of archaic images. One exception may be found at Chu- luutyn-gol, where there is some indication of the interconnec- tion of women, maral, and aurochs images.32 Within at least two of the Kalbak-Tash panels dominated by frontal females and their associated images are examples of another archaic female type: the birthing woman. In one com- position (fig. 2), the fully pecked-out image of such a figure Fig. 6. Large fragmented panel with complex social scene. Vertical, east-facing surface, section VIII, Kalbak-Tash I. (From Kubarev and Jacobson, 1996: fig . 449.) Fig. 6. Grand panneau brisé avec scènes complexes. Surface verticale, tournée vers l'est, section VIII, Kalbak-Tash I. (D'après Kubarev et Jacobson, 1996: fig. 449.) appears to the left of a partially lost bird-woman. With hands and arms raised, small head, and spread legs, her character as a birthing woman is indicated by the emerging infant and by her pendulous breasts splayed out on either side of her body. In another tangled composition (fig. 3) appears a similar figure, but this one has a horizontally striped body and her breasts are hung lower from the sides of her chest.33 Neither figure overlaps or is overlapped by any other image; it is their size and pecked execution, their placement in relationship to the archaic women and maral, and their frontal, hieratic aspect which allow us to propose that these birthing women Arts Asiatiques, tome 52-1997 41</page><page sequence="6">Fig. 7.

Surface verticale, tournée vers le sud, section IV, Kalbak-Tash I. (D'après Kubarev et Jacobson, 1996: fig. 296.) may belong to the same cultural layer as the frontal women, or to a layer not much later in date. However, if fertility is indicat- ed in the frontal women by the indication of their pubic areas, it is more explicitly indicated by the sign of the birthing woman; and this distinction in conception suggests distinctions in ultimate reference. That is, the frontal 'bird-women' may point to the female source of life or clan originator. The birth- ing women seem to point to the act of birth-giving, perhaps with its attendent fearful associations with death. Fig. 8.

(D'après Kubarev et Jacobson, 1996: fig. 220.) The significance of the birthing woman image is complicat- ed by carvings found on a broken slab at Kalbak-Tash, one lying in the immediate vacinity of the main panels of archaic maral and frontal women (fig. 8). 34 This slab is dominated by several large maral and/or maralukha, all but one facing to the right and only one clearly antlered. Two of the animals on the lowest carved layer have outlined bodies and pecked-out necks and heads; two other maral exist only in the form of fragmen- tary outlines.35 In their static but realistic monumentality, these cervids belong to the same cultural layer as represented by the maral more closely associated with the frontal women and with the birthing women.36 However, on the left side of the panel are two birthing women, one behind two of the maral and another over two fragmentary maral. In contrast to those discussed above, these birthing women are small in stature, with radically bent or bowed legs. Their heads take the form of large, unclear shapes; projections off the sides of their bodies might be read as breasts or as arms. These female figures pre- sent us with an enigma. If they were carved at the same time as the maral, then they indicate a transition away from the most archaic levels at Kalbak-Tash. Whether they are simulta- neous with the maral or later, one is forced to ask why they 42 Arts Asiatiques, tome 52-1997</page><page sequence="7">should have been so deliberately juxtaposed with the archaic animals and whether that juxtaposition is unique. The women and maral on the broken slab (fig. 8) are not the end of birthing figures at Kalbak-Tash. This figure type reappears on a large, impressive vertical panel (fig. 6) on the east face of the complex, just below the large figures of ritually dancing (?) men and rows of deer.37 This panel is dominated by the images of laden bovines, two with angled horns and one with antlered horns. Around these images are several others: goats, dogs, and several smaller animals with bovine tails and deer antlers,38 figures in three-quarter pose with mushroom- shaped headdresses, staffs, and 'tail' or fanny pack. Beside one of these standing figures is a small horseless cart represented by its two wheels and its central shaft and axle. The laden bulls or yaks, the strangely syncretic nature of their horns, and the mushroom-shaped character of the men assert a date considerably later than the frontal women and archaic maral and aurochs. The lack of any horsemen, the relative lack of interest in horses in general, and the straightforward style in which the images are carved argue for a date previous to the end of the Bronze Age; that is, in the middle to late second mil- lennium B.C.E. From the nose of the largest bovine (fig. 6)-distinguished by its blocky size and body decorated with circular ele- ments-extends a rope held at its other end by a birthing woman. Legs spread, the emerging infant clearly visible, her arms extended to her sides, she wears a mushroom-shaped headdress that identifies her as contemporaneous with the other, male, figures in the panel. While there are several other frontal figures in the large panel, all holding or touching a tethered bovine, it is not certain that they are females, much less birthing women. Moreover, the significance of the birthing woman here is uncertain. Because the whole panel seems to refer to a social world characterized by herding and the moving of households in search of new pasture, the image of the birthing woman might be simply a statement of social fact and of well-being associated with a peaceful social existence. However, the syncretic aspect of the horned/antlered animals may indicate that the scene as a whole refers to something other than everyday life. Under that circumstance, the birthing woman may also signify a desired status (i.e., birth and social well-being), a mythic narrative, or even the complex mythic paradox associated with birth: that is, life and death. Although birthing women are not lacking in other Central Asian petroglyphs, there has been relatively little attention given to this visual image. Some of the imagery published from East Kazakhstan may refer to birthing women; but without reference to the larger context of imagery, the exact nature of these figures is incertain.39 An interesting composition from Mugur-Sargol, Tuva, may include three birthing women hold- ing tethered bovines and one woman (not necessarily birthing) holding a caprid.40 From the petroglyphs of Mt. Tebsh in Khovd somon, Mongolia, Okladnikov has published three images of birthing women, although not identified as such.41 The most interesting of these compositions includes a female deer, a partial male deer, an unidentified long-tailed animal, and some fragmentary elements; in the upper section of the composition, an archer aims right, perhaps at the stag, while to his right appears a woman in the posture of giving birth. The treatment of the woman's head suggests either long tresses or a modification of the mushroom-shaped headdress; the treatment of the female deer (maralukha?) suggests rela- tionships with the stylized treatment of the deer known from the Mongolian deer stones. In other words, this composition associates wild animals, a hunter, and a woman in the posture of giving birth. We will return to this curious combination. Kalbak-Tash imagery and scattered images at other major Altay sites might lead one to the tentative conclusion that the representation of the anthropomorphic female essentially disappeared by the end of the second millennium b.c.e. Recently recorded rock carvings from the complex of Tsagaan Salaa Baga/Oigor (TS/BO), and other sites in Bayan Ölgiy aimag, Mongolia,42 allow us to qualify that conclusion deci- sively. In the southeast corner of Tsagaan Salaa II are concen- trated an extraordinary group of archaic images, including some of the oldest in the TS/BO site: massive aurochs, moose and primitive horses, as well as large wild sheep. Aside from two strange anthropomorphic figures of a pronouncedly archaic appearance (see, e.g., fig. 9), 43 there are almost no human figures.44 The most striking exceptions are offered by a group of birthing women on a crumbling, south-facing surface (fig. 11). At least five figures, several horned, all stand fron- Fig. 9. Surface with aurochs, maralukha, and horned anthropomorphic figure. South-facing surface, Tsagaan Salaa II.

On the right side of the surface is a larger figure, with a much fuller body; from the lower part of her body emerges an inverted figure. The location of this surface amid the archaic represen- tations of animals and strange anthorpomorphic forms (fig. 9) and its very poor state of preservation tentatively support the argument that it, also, should be dated to a pre-Bronze Age period.45 In fact, birthing women occur frequently throughout the thousands of images now recorded at TS/BO. Most of these female images are located on east or south-facing surfaces; in at least two areas, such images are repeated often enough that one begins to wonder about the ancient ritual function of those sites.46 Many of these images are too schematic and too ancient in appearance (e.g., fig. 12) to allow any attempt at dating except by subjective reference to apparent wear on the surface of rock and pecked areas or by relationship to sur- rounding images.47 Some of these representations merit parti- cular comment here. In a basin in the southwest section of TS IV may be found a significant concentration of images. Among the oldest are certainly those on a low-lying boulder covered with a shiny brown varnish. Surrounded by large, static images of maral, caprids, bovines (?) and bear (?) is the large image of a frontal woman (figs. 13, 14). She has an exaggerat- ed head, as if wearing a turban-like headdress; her arms are held out to her sides and up and between her splayed legs appears the shape of an emerging infant. In many respects she recalls the appearance of the birthing women from the broken panel with maral, from Kalbak-Tash (fig. 8); but she is larger, more clearly articulated and surrounded by a greater variety 44 Arts Asiatiques, tome 52-1997</page><page sequence="9">Fig. 12.

Like the women from Kalbak-Tash and like the birthing women from TS II, this one is a static, hieratic symbol contrasting with the impressive realism of the animals around her. The whole composition and the uniform carving technique confirm that most of the images on this rock were done at the same time48; but the great difference in conception between the frontal woman and the profile animals suggests that the birthing woman cannot be understood in terms of aesthetically considered style. The smooth, shallowly pecked silhouettes and the realistic aspect of these static animals argue for an early Bronze Age date, as does the absence of any recogni- zable references to a social context or to the narrative ele- ments of represented myth. At BO I we have documented another stone with a some- what similar scene. Here, however, the low boulder is much smaller and the carvings are cruder (fig. 15). The face of the stone is dominated by five profile animals, four of which are recognizably cattle. Three of these animals are led by tethers held by frontal figures. By the head of a fourth animal appears another frontal figure. At least two of these anthropomorphic figures may be identified as birthing women. Despite the cru- der carving and fractured carved surface, this scene may be said to parallel the more beautifully carved scene from Kal- bak-Tash where a birthing woman holds a tethered large bovine in the center (fig. 6).49 The absence from this composi- tion of mushroom-hatted figures or horse-back riders and the generally crude nature of the carving preclude an obvious date for this composition. However, the row of goats running along a rippled ground line on the left edge of the panel may be com- pared with a number of similar scenes from this site, from Kal- bak-Tash, and elsewhere, where related elements indicate a full Bronze Age date.50 Two other panels from the complex TS/BO may be brought forward to complicate the case of the 'birthing woman.' The first is from BO II, where an impressive aurochs moves to the right toward three frontal birthing women (here not reproduc- ed). One is struck not simply by the contrast between the sche- matic women and the powerfully rendered bull: the animal itself attracts attention by virtue of its prominent sex and what appears to be a spear lodged in its back. The bull, an implied hunt, the birthing woman: do these three constitute, in some way, a significant triad? These elements appear again, in a large east-facing panel at BO III, one badly damaged by the wear of time (fig. 16; see detail, color plate p. 81).51 Cracks obscure the impressive images across its face and sections of the surface varnish have simply sloughed away. It is still pos- sible to identify the large cattle and maral moving quietly to the right; some of the cattle are rendered with spotted bodies reminiscent of the impressive aurochs from the BO II scene mentioned above. A large maral is attacked by dogs or wolves, while below it may be seen a full-bodied bull carrying a load and followed by a human figure. The animals all approach two large female images. The lower one is frontal and thick, see- mingly related in appearance to the 'woman of the collar' and to the frontal female image at BO II (fig. 10); the carving of her lower body disappears in the broken surface of the stone. Above her is a second figure, her upper body frontal and her lower body turned slightly to the side. Naked, full-bodied, she is a regular Venus-type and placed to the right of the approaching cattle and maral as if she were the object of their Arts Asiatiques, tome 52-1997 45</page><page sequence="10">Fig. 13.

The combination of these apparently archaic female images with archaic animals would seem at first to indicate a date no later than the early Bronze Age; but the images of the speared bull (BO II), the maral attacked by pre- dators, and of a laden bull and man tug that date later, well into a Bronze Age context. Perhaps related to this panel is a smaller group from BO I (fig. 17). Here appear three vertically stacked images: above, a horse with curved neck, facing right; below, a somewhat crude goat, facing left; and in the center, a large figure standing at a slight three-quarter position, the graceful bend of her legs recalling that of the 'Venus' figure discussed above (fig. 16). She raises her left arm and touches a leg of the horse. Her head is small in relationship to her full body. Although she wears a large 'tail' or 'fanny pack* usually associated with male images, this figure has the body and particularly the thighs of a woman.52 At the next site to the east, BO III-alr e ady identified as the location of several compositions related to this discussion-is a fine panel sloping to the east and including a group of animals around three tiny figures (figs. 18, 19). The animals immediately around the center of the surface are done in the kind of blunt realism that appears to have been charac- teristic of the middle Bronze Age.

The treatment of the woman's head suggests a headdress of mush- room-shape; if that is the case, we could state definitively that this particular group of images brings the theme of the bir- thing woman and animals well down into the Bronze Age. One major panel from BO II allows us to argue decisively that the motif of the birthing woman and her association with wild animals continued down to the very brink of the age of the Early Nomads: that is, to the late Bronze or early Iron Age. This panel (figs. 20, 21) appears on the south face of a large boulder, itself located at the back of the grassy terrace at the east end of BO II. The terrace offers a semi-protected area, backed by the rise of the mountain behind, bordered on the west and east by stony ridges, and opening to the rich, well- watered valley of the Baga Oigor River. By the sheer number of carvings around the terrace, their quality and age, and by reference to the several ritual mounds found on and before the terrace, one is justified in surmising that this may have been a site of concentrated ritual activity over many generations, even millennia. The stone in question faces directly to the snow-crested ridge in the south. On the upper, north, and east faces of the stone, the images are generally simple; groups of several simple figures of different sizes suggest families. The representation of a dwelling, viewed as if from above, in the upper northeast section of the stone reaffirms that social refer- ence. Among the poorly preserved images on the east side (not visible here) may be found a small goat rendered in the Pazy- ryk style, and an archer taking aim toward a tangled group of wild animals including an elegant, stylized deer. Most signifi- 52 Arts Asiatiques, tome 52-1997</page><page sequence="17">cant, however, are the images on the main, south face of the stone. Dominating this panel are six large and several smaller images of stylized, elegant maral, four antlered and at least one deliberately female in rendition. With attenuated, beak- like heads, elongated bodies and peaked shoulders, the images establish an essential affinity with the stylized deer or maral associated with Mongolian and Transbaikal deer stones and generally dated to the late Bronze-early Iron Age (c. 1000 B.c.E.).53 On the other hand, the realistic treatment of their muscled hindquarters and the handling of their antlers in more realistic fashion than the exaggerated wave-like forms on the Mongolian deer stones argue that these animals repre- sent transitional formulations between the particular styliza- tion of the deer stone type and the more realistic images of the Pazyryk period.54 In itself, this parallel placement of stylized maral is of considerable interest; but that interest is heighten- ed by the birthing female figures beside a number of the ani- mals. At least two of the women reach and touch the maral or maralukha beside them, indicating their essential intercon- nection and reminding the viewer of the manner in which the large woman from BO I (fig. 17) touched the horse above her. Frontal and artistically undistinguished by comparison to the maral, they were certainly executed at the same time and in deliberate association. Together with at least one other panel from BO III55 and a composition with stylized deer and sche- matic birthing women from TS I (fig. 22), the 'birthing rock' eloquently supports the hypothesis I have presented else- where56: that in ancient northern Central Asia, the maral, like the bull, functioned at least in part as the sign of a female force of life and therefore of death, of social well-being and of natu- ral fertility. It may also have revealed clan origins. Two other aspects of this extraordinary 'birthing stone* must be noted. The first is that the whole face of this rock has been randomly stippled with a pecking instrument. That this pecking took place in antiquity is indicated by the discoloration of the marks in the surface. What that pecking meant, howev- er, remains enigmatic. Secondly, scattered among the images on the right side of the main face may be seen a number of small archer-hunters. The presence of these little hunters-at least two of whom carry long recurved bows-recall the pre- sence of the speared bull before three birthing women, not thirty meters from the 'birthing stone.' The appearance of hunters beside wild animals and women, rendered so vividly on the 'birthing stone' of BO II, Fig. 23. Composition with large and smaller deer, dogs, caprids; small hunters Fig. 23.

One of the finest examples of this motif has been recorded at a site along the Tsagaan Gol, not far from and related in period to the complex of TS/BO.57 The center of the panel is dominated by a large maral, facing left, with extended antlers of many tines, a pronounced hump at his shoulders, and the clear indication of his sex (fig. 23). Below and above are smaller deer. About the scene are archers who perfectly exemplify the Bronze Age 'social man/ with mushroom-shaped hats, 'tails,' and bows and arrows with which they take aim at the various animals. Several dogs attack the maral, particularly the large one in the center; and wild goats are scattered about, as if to fill space. Most interest- ing, however, is the female form on the left side of the panel and in front of the largest cervid. With small head and large, cloaked body, she is significantly larger than are any of the archers; her size-matched only by the central maral- and her quiet stance imply that she has an unusual role within the scene. Indeed, her presence suggests that the interpretation of this scene goes beyond the representation of a hunt to that of a specific, perhaps mythic hunt, or to the representation of a hunt attended by a protective deity.58 The realistic treatment of the various animals and the clear and vital handling of the small figures with mushroom-shaped headdresses associate this fine panel with many others from sites in Central Asia and with a date in the full Bronze Age.59 The same kinds of human figures and a similar realism in the treatment of animals associates an outstanding group of Fig. 24.

In the case of the Baga Oigor compositions, we have to do with an unsurpassed master of the rock-carved image and with a considerable variety of compositions. Several of these may be related to the theme of the woman in Bronze Age art; these are close in loca- tion and indicate an identical hand.60 One of these composi- tions, carved on a low and relatively horizontal surface, shows a large number of wild horned animals of the aurochs type (fig. 24). Taking aim at one of the largest of the bulls is an archer. Though he lacks the distinctive mushroom-shaped hat, his carefully bent legs, his well-aimed and large bow, and the tail-like appendage at his back associate him with the archers of the Tsagaan Gol panel and with like figures in immediately adjoining scenes. Just behind him but facing frontally is an obscure female image, distinguished by her long dress and her tresses hanging to either side of her head. Her presence here, at a hunt after the large aurochs, would seem to be other than a reflection of reality; rather, she appears to raise reality-or at least a part of the real world-into the realm of myth or belief. Once one begins to attend to the numbers of compositions including women in some unusual or significant role, it becomes apparent that the female is a figure type which has been strangely passed-over. An exemplary case is offered by a long panel in the Tsagaan Gol complex. The composition is spread across a badly damaged south-facing horizontal sur- face. On the left side of the panel may be identified a number of humans with animals or shooting at goats and deer. At least one of the figures has a mushroom-shaped headdress and 'tail.' In the panel's center section are four compelling figures, three standing at three-quarters view and one frontal (fig. 25). All four have 'tails' or 'fanny-packs,' all hold vertically raised spears or halberds from the shafts of which hang ribbon-like elements. Most curious is the fact that before the men lies the larger figure of a birthing woman; her position, her size, and the tiny figure which lies between her legs and to the right, would suggest a composition intended to tell a tale, within which a female figure plays a significant role. Here the 'primitive' bir- thing woman motif appears to cross over into a narrative context; the male figure types and a large ritual bull on the right end of the panel (not visible here) indicate a Bronze Age date. The narrative implications of the Tsagaan Gol panel, 'birth- ing woman and halberd bearers,' is echoed in a significant number of narrative compositions we have found in the Tsa- gaan Salaa/Baga Oigor complex, as well. To discuss these often complex compositions in this context would take us far afield: Arts Asiatiques, tome 52-1997 55</page><page sequence="20">their narrative interest and the quality of the carving of many of these large panels (some including over 100 images) requires a separate publication.61 Many of these compositions are located in areas which appear to have been the sites of intense ritual activity over centuries. They typically include ritual mounds, and an abundance of densely carved surfaces; the sites themselves seem to have been consecrated at least partially because of their lines of sight out to significant moun- tains, ridges, rivers, and valleys. One may tentatively conclude from these panels, as well as from the large 'birthing stone' panel at BO II, that the images of women were not relegated only to primitive signs of birthing figures; rather their early significations were followed by more complex meanings, and by a possibly central place in mythic narrative, down through the Bronze Age and probably well into the early Iron Age. The problem of assigning exact dates to all the panels di- scussed above is an aspect of the challenge posed by petro- glyphs as material indicators of culture. Analyses of organic materials from rock surfaces or from pecked grooves do not as yet offer certain chronological indications, although there are promising possibilities for very old images using both radio- carbon dating and micro-stratigraphic analyses of rock var- nish layers.62 The wearing of rock surfaces, particularly sur- face abrasion caused by wind-driven matter, may eventually afford greater certainty for the hypothesis of relative dating, but at the moment there is seldom any way of correlating the period of such eolian effects with the carvings on stone sur- faces. Occasional rock fractures which cross over and disrupt images suggest, also, considerable age. But no matter how ancient the appearance of such rock surfaces, we have no way to ascertain anything but relative chronology. The result is a persistently 'unscientific' determination of the dating of petro- glyphs; this situation is certainly one of the reasons why too many scholars have too long ignored this extraodinary source of information regarding ancient cultures. Into this scientific vacuum may legitimately be inserted the art historian's understanding of style and subject as both cul- tural expression and as chronological indicators, as well as the archaeologist's ability to correlate images with scientifically retrieved object types. With a calibration of style and motifs in mind, it is possible to argue that the compositions referred to here as the 'woman of the hunt' (fig. 23) and the 'birthing woman and halberd bearers' (fig. 25) from Tsagaan Gol; the aurochs hunt from BO III (fig. 24) and a group of narrative compositions including women ('three graces') from BO I and II63 all belong to a single cultural horizon within the Bronze Age. The similarity of elements and their combinations relate these compositions back to those at Kalbak-Tash, in which birthing women were represented side-by-side with bulls and archers (fig. 6). The suggestion of a narrative context, the absence of any reference to horse-back riding, the appearance of carts or of elements related to carts, and the distinctive mushroom-hatted, 'tailed' figures establish the chronological and cultural interconnection of these many scenes and their date before the Iron Age. The tendency toward a forthright realism-that is, an eschewing of radical stylization-also excludes, here, a date within the early Iron Age. The composi- tions discussed earlier-the archaic birthing figures from TS II (fig. 11), the large 'turbaneď birthing figure from TS IV (figs. 13, 14), the birthing women with speared bull, from BO II, and the lovely 'Venus' and animals from BO III (fig. 16)-all must belong to a period preceding that dominated by mushroom-hatted figures; they may reflect, however, the transition into that period most vividly characterized by scenes of social activity. The earlier figures, like the isolated frontal female from BO II (fig. 10) and the 'woman of the collar' from BO III, point back to an archaic level perhaps earlier than the broken panel with maral and birthing women from Kalbak- Tash (fig. 8), and identical with that of the 'bird- women' from Kalbak-Tash and Chuluutyn-gol. Whatever their date, the Kal- bak-Tash and Chuluutyn-gol frontal female images emerge as the most strikingly archaic of all we have discussed. The frequent appearance at Tsagaan Salaa/Baga Oigor of barely visible 'birthing' or 'heraldic' women,64 their bodies muted by the passage of time and blurring of lichen growth (e.g., fig. 12), affirms the centrality of that image in the most archaic levels of petroglyphs at the Mongolian site. The spear- ed aurochs and birthing women from BO II, the 'birthing stone' of BO II, and the related panel from TS I, complicate the dis- cussion, suggesting that the 'birthing woman' in association with a wild animal may have continued to be a significant motif down to the very dawn of the Iron Age. The strength of those representations and the size and location of the 'birthing stone' suggest that the interconnection between wild animals and women as signs of fertility, and possibly, clan origins, per- sisted well into the first millennium b.c.e. before seemingly disappearing entirely. But therein lies the enigma: why should she have disappeared so quickly from the surviving imagery of the early Iron Age? Does the absence of her image really indi- cate that she disappeared from the belief systems of the Early Nomads? Reason would argue that such a sudden loss was not possible and that there must be other explanations for her absence. Perhaps, as I have argued elsewhere, 'she' simply became subsumed in the image of the male animal itself,65 her image but not her potency overlain by male characteristics, emerging only later in the peculiarly feminized aspects of the shaman or in the persistent Turkic tradition of the goddess Umai. But these cultural twists and turns take us too far afield. For the moment one must conclude that the numerous images and compositions including women at such significant sites as Kalbak-Tash, Tsagaan Salaa/Baga Oigor, and Tsagaan Gol, urge a reexamination of the imagery at other recorded sites, and a reexamination which respects the integrity of whole compositions. This means that examination and documenta- tion must record similarities and differences of technical com- pletion, the potential simultaneity of stylistic differences, and the probability that any one composition may reveal layers of perception and expression. 56 Arts Asiatiques, tome 52-1997</page><page sequence="21">Notes 1 The literature on this material is vast and often impressive. For significant sources of material and bibliography, see inter alia, Gimbutas, 1989; Abramova, 1966 and 1995; Stolyar, 1985. 2 Erich Neumann's The Great Mother (1955) remains a major resource for the comparative study of the iconography of the female. Stephen Benko's The Virgin Goddess (1993) offers a rich bibliography on pre-Christian and Christian tradi- tions relating to the female figure in religious belief. See also, Gimbutas, 1989. 3 Practically speaking, and in the context of this dis- cussion, South Siberia and northern Central Asia denote a broad region of steppe, mountain-steppe, and taiga, including Kazakhstan and bordering countries or autonomous regions to the southeast and east; the region now known as the Altay Republic (formerly Gorno-Altaisk Autonomous Region); Mongolia; Tuva; and the Minusinsk Basin through to Transbaikal, in the east. 4 See materials reviewed in Rybakov, 1987. 5 While this last perspective may sound a bit extreme, it does need to be seriously considered. A part of the problem lies in the traditional manner in which rock-carved imagery has been recorded in Central Asia and South Siberia. By this system, the images recorded by rubbing or tracing are taken out of their context; there is no way of verifying, through the publication of that material, what elements, if any, have simply been omitted. The problem of an omission ultimately rooted in cultural interests is well illustrated in Okladnikov, 1980. In the images and image groups reproduced there, it is possible to identify at least three ins- tances of birthing women. PL 51 is particularly interesting because it represents the birth occurr- ing in a dwelling-like enclosure; pl. 69/#5 shows two birthing women in the context of a herd of goats, a horse, and another figure or bird; pl. 109 is of special interest and will be discussed later in this paper. However, even though Okladnikov includes several pages of image types-e.g., anthropomorphic figures or the more specific archers, warriors, horsemen, and so forth-there is no identification of the class of 'women' or of 'birthing figures.' In the text identifications of these scenes, the figures in pls. 51 and 69 are not identified as women while that in pl. 109 is simply identified as a "seated anthropomorphic (female) figure" (ibid., p. 50). 6 The regional designations 'Central Asia' and 'South Siberia' reflect both geophysical complexes and cultural impulses out of present-day Kazakh- stan and the Siberian taiga zone. It will eventually be evident, I am convinced, that these two cultural sources met and merged in the region of present- day northwest Mongolia. 7 These materials come from the Tsagaan Salaa and Baga Oigor rivers, and from the upper Tsagaan Gol. See below, note 14. 8 Formerly the Gorno-Altay Autonomous Region. Kalbak-Tash is located 18 km. up the Chuya River from the small town of Inya, on the right bank of the river. See Kubarev and Jacobson, 1996. 9 These images are found predominantly on the upper face of the lower section of the Kalbak-Tash ridge and on the south and southeast faces over the Chuya Highway; see Sections II- VI in Kubarev and Jacobson, 1996. 10 Compare the tail feathering of, e.g., eagles, hawks, kites. 11 This situation may, of course, only reflect the incomplete state of our knowledge of petroglyphic sites. 12 Novgorodova, 1989: figures on pp. 92, 97. 13 According to Novgorodova's drawings, several of the images have an internal striation of the body, suggestive of backbone and ribs; see ibid., p. 92. 14 This complex is located in the valleys of the Baga Oigor and its tributary, the Tsagaan Salaa. The joint Mongolian-American-Russian project (herein: Joint MAR Altay Project) to document this and other sites in Bayan Ölgiy is overseen by the author; by D. Tseveendorj, Director of Archaeo- logy, Institute of History, Mongolian Academy of Sciences; and by V. D. Kubarev, Senior Researcher, Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography, Novosi- birsk, Russian Academy of Sciences. Our full publication of the Tsagaan Salaa/Baga Oigor site is in preparation. 15 Another variation on the female image at Kalbak- Tash takes the form of a large frontal image with crossed lines in the place of a head. This figure type appears at Kalbak-Tash with other variations on the female image (Kubarev and Jacobson, 1996: # 123, 189, 363). A similar image, but more enigmatic in character, has been found on a fine large panel at TS IV where it is located between two magnificent, archaic maral. 16 Because of the inconsistencies, even within the English language, in naming large cervids and because the use of the only accurate terminology (scientific) is awkward, I will here adopt an admit- tedly simplified fashion of referring to a variety of cervids: the term 'deer' will refer to cervids smaller in size than the Cervus elaphus sibiricus, but without attempting to determine the exact species. 'Maral' and 'maralukha' will refer to the male and female, respectively, of the species designated in English as 'elk' (Cervus elaphus sibiricus, related to what is also called wapiti, cerf, maral, etc.). The North American term, 'moose,' will be used to desi- gnate Alces alces (élan, los') Regarding the signifi- cance of the proximity of frontal female images and maral or maralukha, see, passim, Jacobson, 1993. 17 This judgment is based on a number of factors: image type, type of carving, and repatination - itself indicative of a very early execution. In the immediate vicinity of the 'collared woman' are at least two images which may, in fact, refer to mas- todons; others, including aurochs and caprids, are entirely repatinated with a lustrous black varnish. 18 Kubarev and Jacobson, 1996: e.g., figs. 166, 306, 339. 19 Note, for example, the small figure to the right of a large broken female image in fig. 2 of this paper; and another to the right of woman, in the lower center, in fig. 3. 20 Novogorodova, 1989: images on pp. 92, 96. 21 Kubarev and Jacobson, 1996: e.g., figs. 195, 225, 296, 306. 22 Kubarev, 1988: figs. 33, 59, 60. 23 Several images of somewhat similar character have been identified in the TS/BO complex. These figures are frontal, usually horned, and their out- lined bodies describe an anthropomorphic figure represented as if wearing a large cape. The images hitherto recorded are not found in rela- tionship to any female figures; but in one case, an extremely worn image occurs in the context of animal images dating to an archaic period; ano- ther image is found together with a magnificent auroch and a maralukha, again indicating a pre- Bronze Age date (fig. 9). These enigmatic figures will be considered in future publications. 24 These mushroom-hatted figures appear so fre- quently and in such a broad range of activities and styles that one must conclude that their represen- tation spans a considerable period of time, from the mid-Bronze Age (i.e., mid-second millennium B.c.E.) down to the dawn of the early Iron Age (i.e., early first millennium b.c.e.). These images and their context require a much more careful study than has hitherto been the case. We believe that the great quantity of fine representations involv- ing these figures, documented at TS/BO, will offer a significant opportunity to clarify their cultural and chronological relationships. For preliminary discussions, see inter alia, Kubarev, 1987, Jacob- son, 1993: 121-140. 25 For a concise discussion of these styles, see Sher, 1994: v-xxi. 26 For an interpretation of these images and the nature of the scenes in which they appear which differs significantly from that taken here, see Kubarev, 1987; and see the complicating argu- ments recalled by Samashev (1993: 70-71) in his discussion of "tailed people in mushroom-shaped head-dresses." 27 See above, note 16. 28 E.g., Kubarev and Jacobson, 1996: figs. 41, 141, 150, 195, 196, 297. 29 Ibid., fig. 289. 30 Ibid., fig. 322. 31 On the left side of the panel in fig. 7 (ibid., fig. 296), two fragmentary females overlay the archaic pro- file of a maral but "in turn are overlaid by an aurochs; on the right side of the same panel, a simi- lar layering is even more tangled. Even more com- plex is the layering of women, large maral, caprids, and other images in fig. 3 (ibid., fig. 344), but there the monumental figures of maral clearly overlay the tangled images of frontal women. 32 See Novogorodova, 1989: 89-98. The lack of clearly documented reproductions here and the generalized nature of the text makes it difficult to draw certain conclusions regarding Chuluutyn-gol analogies to the Kalbak-Tash material. 33 Kubarev and Jacobson, 1996: fig. 344. These are not the only representations of birthing women at Kalbak-Tash, but they are the only ones clearly related to the most archaic level of the petroglyphs, represented by the frontal women with bird-like elements, maral, and aurochs. Several other images are enigmatic. In panel #340, a frontal figure superimposed on a rectangular section of vertical stripes might be 'read' as either a frontal ithyphallic male or as a birthing female. Two analo- gous images, in #195 and 323, lack any indications of sexual identity. On the other hand, taking into account all the anthropomorphic images from Kal- bak-Tash, one might easily argue that males are always represented in a profile or three-quarters view, while women are represented frontally. In defining certain figures as birthing women I am aware that some scholars might object that these images are as indicative of ithyphallic males as of birthing females. In my opinion, the distinction between the two is usually clear, involving not sim- ply the outline of the figure but-more signifi- cantly-the figure's posture with arms raised and legs spread. For a discussion in which classification appears to ignore the distinction between birthing females and ithyphallic males, see Officer, 1991. 34 Kubarev and Jacobson, 1996: fig. 220. The origi- nal location of this slab on the rocky outcropping is not certain. During the last few years, the disso- lution of its surface is sadly evident, and has been documented. 35 The horse at the bottom of the panel is probably later, as may be the silhouetted cervid at the very top. 36 Ibid., figs. 41, 225, 296, 334, 338. 37 Kubarev and Jacobson, 1996: fig. 452. 38 Regarding the identity and significance of these syncretic animals, see Jacobson, 1993. 1 am grate- ful to Henri-Paul Francfort for the opportunity to read a forthcoming manuscript devoted to the topic of the syncretic animal in Central Asian petroglyphs. 39 See, e.g., Samashev, 1993: figs. 83-85. 40 Devlet, 1980: pl. 37. In truth, the published draw- ings do not allow a clear distinction between a 'birthing woman' and an ithyphallic man. 41 Okladnikov, 1980: pls. 51, 69, 109; and see above, note 5. 42 See note 14, above. 43 These two images are among a group of approxi- mately 8-10 similarly strange anthropomorphs found at TS/BS. Their powerful if enigmatic appearance raise many questions regarding cul- tural association and meaning. Arts Asiatiques, tome 52-1997 57</page><page sequence="22">44 The primary exceptions include an archaic walk- ing figure (male?), an archaic and barely visible birthing woman surrounded by wild animals, and the women discussed above. 45 Our inability either to name that pre-Bronze Age period or to ascertain the dates of the Bronze Age in this region is directly related to the almost com- plete absence of scientifically excavated material from this part of Bayan Ölgiy aimag. 46 Numbers of these birthing women occur on the east-facing surfaces of stones in the easternmost section of TS IV; and with greater variety in their representation, in the vicinity of the eastern ter- race of BO II and the western section of BO III. 47 Among these images are a considerable number which appear closer in treatment to what has been referred to by Douglas Fraser as the 'heral- dic female,' but without associated figures on either side. Fraser uses this term to refer to "an image of a displayed female figure that is symme- trically flanked by two other beings. By 'displayed' is meant a figure that holds its knees apart, expos- ing the genital area" (Fraser, 1966: 36). 48 An exception to this rule may be found in the image of an extremely obscure birthing woman on a lower corner of the boulder (not reproduced here). 49 A parallel may also be seen in the composition from Stone 198, Mugur-Sargol (Devlet, 1980: pl. 37). 50 See, e.g., Kubarev and Jacobson, 1996: fig. 452, where deer are lined up along a 'path.' The appearance of a ground line in rock carving is of unusual interest and deserves a detailed study. 51 This surface is in close proximity to the 'woman of the collar,' discussed above, and to the other archaic images at BO III. 52 There is nothing to indicate that this is a birthing scene, but the figure does touch the horse in a manner reminiscent of the association between birthing women and animals in other panels. 53 Regarding that image type, see, inter alia, the first significant study of Mongolian deer stones, that of Okladnikov (1954); Volkov's more extended dis- cussion (1981); and, in English, Jacobson, 1993: Chapter Six. 54 Note that TS/BO is rich in deer imagery, offering an unusual opportunity to detail the emergence of the so-called 'Pazyryk' and 'Scythian' deer types out of formulations of the earlier Bronze Age. This discussion is the subject of a forthcoming study by the principle investigators of the Joint Altay Pro- ject. 55 This is a surface covered with superb images of wolves attacking deer of the 'Mongolian deer stone' type. On the south and east edges of this scene may be seen two birthing women (not reproduced here). 56 Jacobson, 1993. 57 This is a site on the upper Tsagaan Gol and its tri- butaries; a publication of these materials is in pre- paration by the members of Joint Altay Project. See above, note 14. 58 Refer to Abramova, 1995: pp. 83-84, and her dis- cussion of what she calls, in Paleolithic art, the image of the 'woman-mother' and her relation- ship to the magic of the hunt. 59 The apparent relationship of a woman to a hunt recalls the scene from Mt. Tepsh, referred to above, but there the woman was in a birthing position (Okladnikov, 1980: pl. 109). 60 Unpublished materials from the Joint MAR Altay Project from BO III. Close by the composition in question are two others which may be related to the theme of the 'woman of the hunt.' 61 For example, at BO I and II we have recorded two large compositions which seem to have a similar narrative reference; both include three large female figures, standing gracefully together like 'three graces.' Several major panels at BO III are astounding not only for the extraordinary quality of their carving, but also for the curious narrative content they reflect and for the apparently major role played by female figures in these narrative compositions. Publication of this material is in preparation. 62 Radiocarbon dating of organic materials within the pecked grooves of a rock-carved image would require that that material had been 'encased' by a new layer of varnish; but, according to one of the pioneers in this area of research, Professor Ron Dorn of the University of Arizona, varnish layers grow very slowly in arid climates, requiring seve- ral thousand years to develop. See, e.g., Liu and Dorn, 1996. For an excellent discussion of the limitations of scientific methodologies for dating, see Schaafsma, 1985. 63 See above, note 61. 64 See note 47. The application of the term 'heraldic' to these simple female images may not apply here because there are no attendant figures; on the other hand, the apparent universality of the 'heraldic woman' motif in ancient and tribal socie- ties suggests that the figures I have referred to as 'birthing women' might ultimately prove to be not birthing so much as exposing what was unders- tood as the physical path of life and death.

Dans les traditions artistiques de la Sibérie du Sud et du nord de l'Asie Centrale, d'importantes images de figures féminines ne disparurent pas au paléolithique. Au contraire, on peut remonter jusqu'à l'Age de Bronze, et même à la période des premiers nomades (premier millénaire avant Jésus Christ), et trouver des images de femmes qui semblent avoir une signifi- cation 'plus qu'humaine'. En utilisant des pétroglyphes de Kal- bak-Tash dans la République Altay et de deux des principaux sites de l' Altay en Mongolie, rauteiu* démontre l'apparition constante de trois formes primaires d'imagerie de la femme: la femme avec des caractéristiques d'oiseau ('femme-oiseau'), la 'femme génitrice', et une autre image que l'on pourrait appe- ler 'la femme des animaux'. D'apparition fréquente et, à l'oc- casion, impressionnantes par leur présentation et leur taille, ces images reprennent une association archaïque, mais persis- tante, de la figure de la femme au bétail et au daim ; elles nous forcent à nous demander pourquoi de telles images ont jus- qu'ici reçu si peu d'attention dans le recensement et les études des pétroglyphes eurasiens. Abstract The 'bird- woman', the 'birthing woman,' and the 'woman of the animals': a consideration of the female image in petroglyphs of ancient Central Asia Within the artistic traditions of South Siberia and northern Central Asia, significant representations of female figures did not disappear with the Paleolithic period. Rather, images of females who appear to have a 'more-than-human' significa- tion can be traced down through the Bronze Age and perhaps even into the period of the Early Nomads (first millennium B.C.E.). Using petroglyphs from Kalbak-Tash in the Altay Repu- blic and from two major new sites in the Mongolian Altay, the author demonstrates the continued appearance of three pri- mary forms of female imagery: that of a woman with bird cha- racteristics ('bird- woman'), that of the 'birthing woman,' and another which might be called a 'woman of the animals.' Fre- quent in appearance and occasionally impressive in presenta- tion and size, these images reaffirm an archaic but persistent association of the female figure with cattle and with deer; they force one to ask why such images have hitherto received so little attention in the recording and study of Eurasian petro- glyphs. rjt&amp;j , rsö$j(7)£j 7 &amp; ft, $ IC*?, r ÍÁÍJ ft* 7K94 ÄinB© *7 * • * v i/ O. yď 'J 0ZËÛ# 2 üifroéü® teÄo'OT, ÍCÍÈ#© 3 LT, ) , r&amp;m iti , £ b id Ç&gt;tl6 b 9 O jt - föicmnz c iciiłoilo eft £&gt;©«(*, fc©^ ¿ - i**** Lfc*&gt;©¿ O*.
