Peter Anthony Bloom Smith College Disease and Civilization: The Cholera in Paris, 1832. By Franqois Dela- porte. Translated by Arthur Goldhammer (Cambridge, MIT Press, I986) 250 pp. $22.50 Cholera was the shock disease par excellence of the nineteenth century. It was as devastating psychologically as the Black Death and as poten- tially threatening to the stability of society. Coming out of the "barbaric" East and of mystifying etiology, it inexorably advanced westward. De- spite the hasty efforts of governments to establish partial cordons sani- taires, impose embargoes on goods and travelers, and introduce hygienic measures on an unprecedented scale, the disease ravaged Europe. In the first major visitation of 1832, 6,000 Londoners and I8,000 Parisians died of cholera; equally frightening was the high percentage of fatalities among those contracting the disease (in Britain between 40 and 60 percent) and the speed with which it struck (victims could be dead within a few hours of the first apparent symptoms). Delaporte, who was directed to this subject by Michel Foucault, is aware that cholera "cannot be studied solely as a medical question. For is it not self-evident that questions of sociology, mentalities, and ideol- ogy must also be taken into account? . . . Deadly disease evokes wide- spread fears, shaped in part by popular beliefs" (5). His determination to integrate medical and social history gives the book much of its vigor, but it also leads to some incoherence. It is most lively and provocative when it ranges broadly over intellectual and social themes, but it is ultimately most convincing and scholarly when it focuses narrowly on the medical theories of cholera. Delaporte's integrative approach promises, as is perhaps inevitable given its breadth, rather more than it delivers. Take, for example, his important and perceptive comment: "The cholera disaster pointed up the urgent need for what was called 'political medicine.' Political med- icine was part economics and part biology. It was related to economics because hygienists envisioned the population as wealth or 'human cap- ital.' And it was related to biology because they also looked at society as a collective organism" (82). But neither category is explored inten- sively, and here as elsewhere the interdisciplinary approach is apparent more in the methodological framework and terminology than in sus- tained argument. One of Delaporte's central themes, that the cholera epidemic se- verely exacerbated class divisions, is, however, splendidly developed and documented. The governing classes, for the most part, imagined</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS | 131 frightening parallels between the Asiatic hordes and the poor, with their "barbarous habits" and "moral weakness," and viewed the poor as a challenge to Western civilization. By contrast, the poor believed that the epidemic was an attempt by the government "to resolve the issue of unemployment by poisoning the unemployed. Medical personnel were simply viewed as the agents of the enemy" (8). Thus fear of the disease itself (Choleraphobia) was accompanied by other fears: fear of "mass poisonings . . . by government agents" and even fear of"a program of extermination concocted by the authorities" (48). Delaporte's examina- tion of folk-lore, fantasy, and class antagonisms as roots of these fears is superb. Given the importance of this theme, it is strange that Delaporte does not mention Morris' Cholera 1832: The Social Response to an Epi- demic, which uses the epidemic to test "the symbiotic tension of class relationships" in England and so parallels Delaporte's work. Whereas Morris concludes that the "lack of major panic and disorganisation in the face of cholera was another indication of the basic stability of British society," Delaporte stresses the divisive and tense nature of French so- ciety and discovers deep class hatreds and fears in almost every aspect of the attitudes toward, and treatment of, cholera.1 "It is banal," he writes, "to say that men attempted to cope with death by taking steps to prevent it. Rather than repeat such a banality, what we must do is to show how, in 1832, one class sought to control another, which it saw as powerless but potentially dangerous" (8). The tone of the book can best be conveyed by its concluding sentence: "The epidemic of 1832 surely marks a historical watershed: the moment when the need to import into the exploited class a health apparatus forged by and for the bourgeoisie became evident-an appa- ratus, moreover, that remained the instrument of the bourgeoisie's he- gemony" (199-200). Delaporte acknowledges the commitment of health authorities, but his treatment of their administrative and medical re- sponses to the challenge of cholera is weakened by his polemical stress on class exploitation and control, terms which he never fully explains. If the social and political themes in Disease and Civilization call for more sustained analysis, the medical and epidemiological themes are models of balanced argument. Delaporte contends that the differences of opinion between infectionists and contagionists were not as sharp as has been traditionally held, and he is particularly enlightening on the reasons why rural doctors, most experienced in dealing with microcon- tagion, favored the contagionist approach whereas urban doctors, faced with macrocontagion, embraced the infectionist. His grasp of the various theories (including the volcanic theory of disease) is impressive, and he clearly shows the strength and vitality of experimental and physiological medicine in France.

HARRIGAN Disease and Civilization amply demonstrates how vital it is to relate the history of medicine not only to political and socioeconomic factors but also to anthropological and intellectual questions. Those readers interested in the history of medical thought and the way popular beliefs influence medical and political opinion will find much to fascinate them. But urban historians concerned with institutional responses to epidemic disease and those interested primarily in the evolution and permeation of class attitudes might wish for a more fully documented and cautiously reasoned work. Anthony S. Wohl Vassar College The Superstitious Mind: French Peasants and the Supernatural in the Nine- teenth Century. By Judith Devlin (New Haven, Yale University Press, 1987) 316 pp. $30.00 The Superstitious Mind discusses popular beliefs in rural ninteenth-century France. Religion, witchcraft, demonology, prophecy, magic, and med- icine are the major themes, but werewolves, elves, and ghosts make cameo appearances. The book would make a fine reference point for any course in the history of popular culture or popular beliefs. Devlin draws abundantly from historical records and interprets them in the light of anthropology and psychology. She points out, for example, that both medical practices and certain religious rites are anal- ogous to modern psychological patterns of healing and treatment of hysteria. The book is stronger in its invocation of psychology than in its recourse to anthropology. It offers two major contributions and suffers one unfortunate weak- ness. It confirms prior scholarship in many areas. Popular religion was more anthropomorphic and utilitarian than spiritual. Healing was a mixture of religious and quasi-scientific practices. Ignorance and fear of nature led to a bestiary of threatening animals that existed only in the popular mind. Visions of elves and fairies were representations of con- flict, either internal or between human beings and nature. Devlin adds little to our knowledge of these topics, but demonstrates that traditional mindsets remained in rural France a century ago. The sense of continuity of belief is the second and more important contribution of this study. The author effectively uses documentation from the sixteenth through the nineteenth centuries to demonstrate the persistence of a variety of values and assumptions in rural France. She argues convincingly that the cosmology of the rural French changed little during those centuries. However much the Enlightenment, the Revolution, and gradual industrialization transformed some areas, su- perstition (I prefer traditional attitudes) continued. She argues, and I agree, that mass pilgrimages to Lourdes and less famous centers during</page></plain_text>
