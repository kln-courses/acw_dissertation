Dalton. The Animal-Headed Figure on the Franks Casket. By 0. MI. nQ Dalton, M.A., F.S.A. UU The perplexing subject upon the bone panel at Florence, which originally formed the right end of the Franks Casket in the British Muiseum, still remains a miatter for controversy.' Perhaps the most generally accepted interpretation is that adopted by Wadstein, who connects it with the Sigurd (Siegfried) Saga. On the right Brynhild urges Gunnar and Hagen to the murder of the hero; in the middle is the tumulus, with Siegfried's body visible within, and the ftaithful horse, Grane, mourning above it; on the left Grane, now wvith a human body, sits upon the tumuluis with the murderer, Hagen, standing before him. It is with the interpretationi of this left-hand portiorn of the panel that the present note is coi)cerned. The version which has just been quoted does not explain the episode very satisfactorily. Dr. Imelnannt has, therefore, asked with some reasonl why Grane should be repeated at all, and, if repeated, why he should be anthropomorphic in one place and purely animal in another ? There are difficulties in the way of his own interpretation, in which he develops a suggestioni made by Holthausen ; but it raises points of anthropological interest, and may, therefore, be fitly presented to readers of MAN. Dr. Imelmann thinks it possible that the figure with the horse's (or ass's) head and human body nay represent a metamorphosis. The chief objection to this lies in the fact that the group on the left must then be regarded as detached from the episodes occupying the rest of the panel as at present interpreted. Representations of men with aniimals' heads are comparatively frequent in early art. They may be roughly divided into four classes. Firstlv, there are animal-headed deities, such as the Anubis or Seth of Egypt; secondly, there are the wearers of masks ; thirdly. the figures illustrating ancient travellers' tales ; lastly, there are bewitched persons. It is with the last of these classes that we are here principally occupied. The superstition that the personality of a man may pass inlto an animal form is of immense antiquity, and examples of its occurrence might be quoted from all parts of the world. We have here only to consider the prevalence of the belief as it may have affected the maker of the Franks Casket. In the earlier centuries of the Christian era witches were as real to popular belief as at any other period before or after, and their power of changinig either themselves or others intp beasts and birds was a favourite subject in popular literature and drama. The powers attributed to Circe passed to the Moeris of the Eclogues and were transmitted to the Pamphile of the Golden Ass. The results obtained by all these witches were the same, but their methods varied; instead of the insidious draught or the poisonous herb they often used a magical ointment, the effects of wlhich could only be cancelled by eating some particular kind of leaf or flower. In the romance of Apuleius the transformed Lucius only regains his human shape by snatching, a meal of roses. The northerD Sagas had also their were-wolf warriors, similar to the man-lions, lhuman leopards, and ape-men of primitive fancy. There is, therefore, no reason why a metamorphosis should not be represented in the Northumbrian art of the eighth century, and it may be noted that the creature upon the casket appears to be eating, at the same time holding a branch in one haiid. It may, however, seem strange that the figure should be partly man and partly beast, instead of being wholly animal. This partial transformation may have been deliberately chosen as a really more effective * This panel, which bad been separated from the rest and purchased by M. Carrand, passed with his collection into the Bargello (Reale iMluseo Nazionale) at Florence, wherc it now is. t Zeugnisse zu?r altenglisehen Odoaker-Dichtqung, 1907.

But it may possibly have been suggested by familiar types of animal-headed men belonging to the other classes mentioned above. The upper figure orn the plate, from an eleventh century Anglo-Saxon manuscript in the British Museum,* represents a creation of the fantastic anthropology handed dowu through Pliny and }Elian to the earlier middle ages. It is described as a cynocephalus with a dog's head, horse's mane, and boar's tusks, a hot-blooded monster breathing fire and flame. The idea of such a type may well have unconsciously influenced the artist when he came to draw a man who had been bewitched. There is another source from which a similar suggestion may have been derived, and that is of the Mime of the Ass. The Golden Ass of Apuleius was doubtless based upon this mime, which was one of the most popular of those performed in the market places of the Roman Empire both in the East and in the West. In the performance, the impersonator of the ass-man went upon two legs and wore only a mask in the form of a donkey's head; he is so seen upon a fragment of red ware found in Italy and dating from the first century A.D. There seems reason to believe, as Dr. Hermann Reich has shown,t that degenerate forms of this mime persisted through the Middle Ages ; and that " the man with the ass's head " may have been seen in the fairs of European cities down to the sixteenth century. Shakespeare himself, who had probably read the Golden Ass, may have seen or heard of the popular figure, and Nick Bottom, the weaver, is thus brought into conlnection with the Lucius of Apuleius. In theory the ass-man of the minme was no doubt supposed to have assumed the whole physical nlature of a donkey, but we learn from the pottery fragment that for representative purposes the long-eared head was considered a sufficient mark of identity. It appears, therefore, that there is more than one way in which a monstrous figure, partly human and partly animal, may have come to do duty for the complete donkey; and the theory that the episode upon the Franks Casket may have something to do with a metamorphosis is not altogether improbable. But it is always open to the slupporters of the older theory to suggest that the artist gave a man's body to the horse Grane simply to emphasise the human sympathy which the noble animal displayed after his master's death. This small problem is perhaps not unworthy of the attention of anthro- pologists, who are confronted with somewhat similar difficulties in the domains of primitive and barbaric art. 0. M.
