<plain_text><page sequence="1">Mickey Meets Mondrian: Cartoons Enter the Museum of Modern Art by Bill Mikulak The Museum of Modern Art's activities on behalf of animated films carefully bal- anced an elitist disdain for mass culture against Iris Barry's belief that popular en- tertainment should be preserved and disseminated as art. In the third issue of its Bulletin (November 1933) the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) presented Iris Barry's brief "Film Comments" column, in which she de- voted three out of four paragraphs to the "cinematic gem," Walt Disney's Three Little Pigs, whose "wealth of invention" made a much greater impression on her than did the Mae West feature I'm No Angel.1 Thus began this New York museum's official attention to animation. I would like to focus on the formative years of this attention, including the founding in 1935 of the Film Library (now the Depart- ment of Film and Video) and continuing through the mid-1940s. What is interesting about the Museum of Modern Art's early activities on be- half of animation is how they illuminate larger questions about cultural value. Ani- mation encompasses a wide range of techniques and production modes, yet it was, and still is, primarily thought of as children's popular entertainment. In contrast, the Museum of Modern Art is known for exhibiting challenging avant-garde art. When the museum started screening cartoons, what did it say about their worth compared to the other art it exhibited? To answer this, I wish to place MoMA in the context of the contradictory roles art museums play. On the one hand, museums preserve precious objects; on the other, they educate the public. The former role sets the standards by which objects are judged fit to enter the collection and cultivates specialized tastes and scholar- ship to recognize those standards. The latter role requires that the objects serve a pedagogic function, that they be useful for communication to a wide range of people. If the objects do not clearly communicate some meaning, then the museum's own discourse can provide a framework for comprehending them. The museum can combine its two roles when it teaches the public what constitutes artistic legiti- macy. The prestige embodied in its standing collection and preceding exhibits im- bues each new exhibit with a certain degree of importance. More often, the roles conflict, and this discord is exacerbated by American art museums' organizational structure. When museums balance private control and public responsibilities, the priorities of wealthy sponsors often clash with those of Bill Mikulak received his doctorate from the Annenberg School for Communication, Uni- versity of Pennsylvania. ? 1997 by the University of Texas Press, P0O.

When the Museum of Modern Art first included the marginalized art form of ani- mation in its film collection, whose interests was it serving, and what risks were en- tailed? Was this a clear case of public education defeating exclusivity, or was it part of a more complex process of negotiation? I argue the latter. This article asserts that the Museum of Modem Art could anticipate few bene- fits from branching out into film, much less animation. When its Film Library was founded, MoMA was a six-year-old upstart organization beside venerable giants like the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In the midst of the Depression its resources were already spread thin, and it was still establishing its authority regarding mod- ern painting, sculpture, and architecture. Why tackle film in addition to everything else? Film was a chemically volatile, mass-produced medium; collecting and circu- lating it often entailed a complex web of legal restrictions. Most of the trustees saw no point in collecting an art form that offered no investment potential in the way the museum's paintings and sculptures did.2 Then whose interest was served by instituting a Film Library? While trustee John Hay Whitney was an investor in Hollywood, he was not the prime mover be- hind such a department. That role belonged to the museum's founding director, Alfred H. Barr, Jr." By hiring Iris Barry to be MoMA's first film curator, Barr put in place an individual whose enthusiasm and strategic prowess rivaled his own. In ad- dition, their omnivorous appetites for cataloging and categorizing artistic influ- ences provided a global framework that linked artistic innovators to predecessors. Their all-encompassing approaches laid the groundwork for the museum's eclectic exhibition and acquisition policy. Barry's approach benefited animation in several ways. She developed an art historical narrative of animation as a distinctive branch of film that encompassed traditions of many nations. Within those traditions, she recognized pioneers such as Emile Cohl and masters such as Walt Disney. While acknowledging animation's special address to children, she and her successors never categorized it as exclu- sively a children's medium, as so many others have. On the contrary, the museum's programs have placed animation in the company of a wide range of films. The museum's supple approach to animation is evidenced by its willingness to recon- textualize films into different groupings as new circumstances suggest different perspectives. Because the film medium did not operate within traditional fine art markets, much of the museum's praise had little of the direct financial bearing on commer- cial film producers that it had on painters and sculptors. Some, such as Walt Disney, benefited indirectly. Late in the 1930s Disney found a way to convert aesthetic ap- preciation into fine art marketability through sales of production art from his films. Experimental filmmakers also benefited from the museum's imprimatur, which could aid the pursuit of funding and teaching positions. Film scholarship is likewise indebted to the museum's pioneering efforts to preserve not only films but also a range of printed material surrounding their pro- duction and evaluation. The museum's circulation of film programs also offered a Cinema Journal 36, No. 3, Spring 1997 57</page><page sequence="3">nucleus around which many schools were able to base film courses. To the extent that artistic reputations in film are influenced by academic efforts at canon forma- tion, the museum's contributions cannot be overstated. To understand the basis for the Film Library's pioneering activities on behalf of animation, I turn first to Alfred Barr's influential approach to art and museum curatorship. Alfred Barr's Crusade for Modernism. For decades the Museum of Modern Art was publicly associated with the taste and erudition of Alfred Barr. The mu- seum's wealthy founders were interested primarily in modern artists working in traditional media such as painting, sculpture, prints, and drawings. However, Barr envisioned a museum that was devoted not merely to these media but to innova- tions that appeared in all visual arts. As Russell Lynes put it, "Anything to which man applied his eyes and which might be given the dignity of an artist's or an arti- san's or a designer's concern was, in Barr's concept, a proper study and province of the Museum."'4 While the trustees' tastes for avant-garde painting and sculptural styles varied, they recognized these as fine art formats they could collect. Convincing them that industrial design, architecture, photography, and film were suitable recipients of their patronage was a much more daunting task. These applied arts had utilitarian and commercial aspects that clashed with the ascendant Romantic view that great art eschewed practical concerns in favor of direct expression of genius. Each of these industrial arts also presented problems in locating the original "authentic" artistic production amongst equivalent mechanically produced objects and in assigning authorship when those objects involved collaboration among many specialized workers. While museums had long collected antiquities that shared difficulties in attributing origins, their age and rarity contributed artifactual value that contemporary industrial products lacked. Of course, the Museum of Modern Art was not the first art museum to attend to industrial arts. The Museum of Art and Industry in Vienna, the Museum of Ap- plied Art in Berlin, and the Victoria and Albert Museum in South Kensington were all founded in the latter half of the nineteenth century. They emphasized the prac- ticality of what they displayed as exemplary specimens for craftsmen and designers to study, thus expanding European art museums beyond the role of elite treasure houses to embrace the working classes' modern industrialized culture.5 Developments such as these provided the backdrop for Marxist aesthetician Walter Benjamin to predict that mechanical reproduction would make art univer- sally accessible. He hoped this would break the religious and capitalist fetishization of singular, authentic works of art. He claimed that cultural tradition imbued such works with an aura of mystery, based first on divine power, then on creative genius. Only properly vested authorities could interpret the works to the public, while con- noisseurs could express their appreciation through purchase of originals. Instead of the "cult value" of these artworks, Benjamin promoted the "exhibition value" of ubiquitous copies, available for all to critique and enjoy.6 While the Museum of Modern Art's trustees had obvious investments in pre- 58 Cinema Journal 36, No. 3, Spring 1997</page><page sequence="4">serving the cult value of the art within the museum, Barr's position was more equivocal. His authority as an art historical expert could be maintained through the accentuation of art's cult value over its exhibition value, but his mission as public educator might be served better by the reverse. Barr accentuated that which most suited each audience he addressed. Trustees could be placated by a stress on cult value within each industrially based department. Architects' models and blue- prints, industrial design prototypes, and photographic proofs were among the items that could be collected and attributed to individuals. Production and adver- tising materials from films also provided artifacts of the artistic process. Animation offered particularly suitable prefilmic constituents in the form of drawings and paintings. Thus, Barr and his curators could isolate individuals within the mass pro- duction process, uniqueness within ubiquity, authenticity amidst copies to satisfy concerned trustees. However, the emphasis on cult value did not prevail universally within the museum. As Christopher Phillips demonstrates, MoMA's trustees caused the Pho- tography Department to depart from this strategy when it failed to either draw the public to exhibits or generate a significant art market for photography. In 1947 the trustees replaced photography curator Beaumont Newhall with Edward Steichen, who reoriented the Photography Department's exhibitions toward large-scale photo- journalistic essays. Eventually, the Photography Department returned to cultivat- ing the aura of specific photographic prints as collectible artworks.7 In addition, Barr was the inheritor of a tradition in the United States that reversed Europe's increased attention to utilitarian art. Whereas early American museums were founded on egalitarian goals of useful pedagogy, specialized art museums, such as Boston's Museum of Fine Arts, began to favor aesthetic appre- ciation over technical instruction. This coincided with their increased means to collect original artworks to replace the plaster casts and reproductions that once filled their halls.' Thus, Barr's contextualization of applied arts was very different from that of the German and British museums mentioned above. He placed selected examples of these arts into the same theoretical framework he used for fine art. To bridge the gap between industrial manufacture and hand-crafted art he delineated the influ- ences that flowed between them. For example, a major exhibition Barr organized was Cubism and Abstract Art (1936), in which he linked examples of photography, furniture, typography, posters, theater, film, painting, and sculpture into a geneal- ogy of artistic movements.9 In this way, he illuminated aesthetic crosscurrents that might otherwise have gone unnoticed. As Alice Goldfarb Marquis argues, this exhibit and another titled Fantastic Art, Dada and Surrealism (1936) "proposed a way of looking at a work of art that minimized its purely aesthetic, sensual qualities and instead emphasized its place in the development of a particular artist's oeuvre and in the history of art. Ulti- mately, this approach would squeeze most aesthetic criteria out of the appreciation of modern art and leave only one standard by which contemporary art could be judged. For better or worse, that standard would be novelty. "1 Cinema Journal 36, No. 3, Spring 1997 59</page><page sequence="5">Barr's catalogs concisely described the innovative techniques artists used to break previous conventions. Those conventions had developed over centuries to achieve the illusion that three-dimensional reality had been captured on two- dimensional canvases. From techniques to convey perspective to the range of color available through oil paints, each served the purpose of verisimilitude in depicting everything from biblical scenes to secular portraits. Artistic skill could be judged against reality; thematic importance and beauty were widely acknowledged crite- ria as well. According to Larry Gross, for art to communicate meaning or predictably evoke emotions, the artist must employ symbolic codes that the audience shares to a significant extent.11 The above conventions provided such symbolic codes, but Barr's chosen artists often rejected them. Instead, Barr's elucidations created a communicative framework within which to comprehend the defiantly uncommu- nicative works that modern artists were producing. Barr's idiosyncratic tastes led him to seek novelty wherever it might appear, even "in works by children, lunatics, and savages."12 Museum trustees and art critics alike were outraged by some of Barr's selections. Indeed, when originality displaces art's other aspects, there are serious conse- quences. Gross asserts, the "pattern of constant innovation in the arts undermines their ability to embody the common experiences and meanings of the society, to serve the central communicative functions of socialization and integration-roles now assigned to the domain of the popular arts and the mass media."13 Thus, Barr's longterm interest in mass media alongside traditional art media kept the museum in the midst of the most socially meaningful currents of artistic endeavor. In addi- tion, Barr was not averse to using the mass media to promote the museum. He hired public relations pioneer Edward L. Bernays for consultation on a member- ship drive and kept a full-time publicity person on staff. 14 The museum trustees eventually assented to establish departments devoted to the mass media of film and photography along with those for architecture and industrial design. Trustee acceptance of photography's communicative role was demonstrated amply in their appointment of Edward Steichen as photography di- rector. They would find that Iris Barry blended Barr's interest in aesthetic lineages with Steichen's interest in social meaning. Founding the Film Library. Barr included a film library in the Museum of Modern Art's 1929 prospectus, but he did not gain full trustee support or funding until 1935. In the meantime, he groomed the museum librarian, Iris Barry, for the post of curator of films, drawing on her background as film critic for London's Daily Mail and as cofounder of the London Film Society in 1925, one of the first groups to view film as a serious art form. In addition to contributing her "Film Comments" to the museum's Bulletin, Barry put together two series of film screenings, one for the newly founded New York Film Society and one that took place at the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hart- ford, Connecticut, over the 1934-35 winter. Among the Atheneum programs was 60 Cinema Journal 36, No. 3, Spring 1997</page><page sequence="6">one titled Experimental, Abstract, Amateur Films and the Animated Cartoon, which presented Viking Eggeling's Symphonie diagonale (1924), M. Webber and J. S. Watson's Fall of the House of Usher (1928), Paul Strand and Charles Sheeler's Manhatta (1921), Castleton Knight's Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C Sharp Minor (1927), Ivor Montague's Blue Bottles (1928), and Walt Disney's King Neptune (1932).15 The museum's committee on motion pictures surveyed college presidents and museum directors and found that many of them were interested in renting film programs from the museum.16 Abby Rockefeller agreed to fund a film department, though she expressed reluctance to include "films that might be objectionable on what she called 'Freudian grounds.' "17 The Film Library was officially incorporated in May 1935 with a $100,000 grant from the Rockefeller Foundation and $60,000 in private subscriptions, most of which trustee John Hay Whitney contributed. Whitney was an investor in Tech- nicolor and Selznick International, and his Hollywood connections were vital for the Film Library's early acquisitions. Iris Barry was named curator and her hus- band, John E. Abbott, director.18 As stated in the museum's Bulletin, the Film Li- brary's purpose was to trace, catalog, assemble, exhibit and circulate to museums and colleges single films or programs of films in exactly the same manner in which the museum traces, catalogs, exhibits and circulates paintings, sculpture, architectural photographs and models or reproductions of works of art, so that the film may be studied as any other one of the arts is studied and enjoyed.19 This statement makes clear that the Film Library was meant to promulgate the museum's specific interpretation of how films qualify as art. Films would circulate in structured programs far beyond the walls of the museum, complete with pro- gram notes discussing the importance of each grouping. The first private press screening was held in June 1935 to preview the work of the Film Library. On the program were three films: the Edison Company's Irwin- Rice Kiss (1896), Edwin S. Porter's Great Train Robbery (1903), and Joie de Vivre (1934) by Anthony Gross and Hector Hoppin. Joie de Vivre20 featured two stylized young women and a young man chasing them on a bicycle through a kaleidoscopic landscape. This screening illustrated the breadth of the Film Library's interest by showing pieces of history alongside a recent animated film with obvious artistic as- pirations. Many newspapers ran the museum's press release, which stressed Gross and Hoppin's independence from Hollywood traditions in their two-year struggle to produce 34,000 drawings and celluloid paintings to make their film. The press release not only provided subsidized information but also subsidized aesthetic evaluation of the film when it proclaimed: "Joie de Vivre is a distinctly new and original step in that branch of the motion picture devoted to the animated cartoon, and as such it has its place in the Museum of Modern Art Film Library.""21 Some writers went beyond the press release script to offer responses ranging from approval to outright mockery. William Troy of The Nation praised the Film Library's endeavor, predicting that future Ph.D.'s will be grateful and that "the Cinema Journal 36, No. 3, Spring 1997 61</page><page sequence="7">existence of such an institution will have the immediate effect of increasing the prestige of the films in those quarters which still consider a serious interest in them a sign either of affectation or of intellectual decay."22 On the other hand, a piece in the Boston Post joked, "Now that Joie de Vivre picture was some action and sex ap- peal picture and no foolin'."23 Building the Collection. Once the Film Library was officially founded, its staff had to build the collection. Alfred Barr regularly visited New York and European galleries and artists' studios looking for potential museum acquisitions; Iris Barry turned first to Hollywood and then to Europe's film producers. While artistic repu- tation and subsequent sales can increase when a museum collects and exhibits a fine artist's work, no comparable relationship existed between the museum and filmmakers. Film producers and distributors operated under economies that did not necessarily value the museum's sacralization and collection of their products. Iris Barry and John E. Abbott found this out on their initial trip to Hollywood in the summer of 1935, armed with letters of introduction from John Hay Whitney. Whitney arranged for Mary Pickford to host a dinner and screening at Pickfair, where Barry and Abbott could request donations from prominent producers, di- rectors, and actors in order to preserve an art form threatened with extinction through neglect.24 The program featured a sampling of American film history from early "primitives" to excerpts from Charlie Chaplin's Gold Rush (1925) and Lewis Milestone's All Quiet on the Western Front (1930), ending with the Walt Disney short Pluto's Judgment Day (1935)."25 Disney was among the invited guests, and Iris Barry later reflected that this dinner was his personal introduction to many others in the film industry.26 The dinner marked the beginning of Disney's relationship with the Museum of Modern Art that saw Disney donate films and production art- work as well as become a museum trustee in 1944. However, this gathering initially generated more publicity than film dona- tions. Hollywood's reluctance to donate stemmed from the reproducibility of film, which made each print that escaped the control of its distributor a possible target of piracy or unlicensed exhibition. The fear of lost profits even prompted the in- dustry practice of destroying most prints after a picture's initial run.27 The museum aroused considerable suspicion in asking for prints, as evidenced by the title of a news item in the Showman's Trade Review: "More Trouble for Theatre Men Seen in 'Film Library' Set-Up."28 Iris Barry later recalled the irony of her sojourn to the West Coast because "the way into open water lay not through Hollywood but through New York, where real control of the industry resided in the hands of the big corporations, the lawyers, the banks."29 Once Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's corporate lawyer in New York, Robert Rubin, drew up a restrictive contract classifying the film prints as per- manent loans accompanied by limited exhibition rights, other companies accepted the terms and contributed the requested films.30 The museum does own many prints outright. But only a subset of the museum's film collection on permanent loan is available for circulation to nonprofit and educational institutions, because 62 Cinema Journal 36, No. 3, Spring 1997</page><page sequence="8">additional rights must be negotiated. Most films within the standing collection can only be shown on the museum's premises, and only preservation and reference copies may be made.31 Meanwhile, owners of the films in the collection may circu- late them outside the museum and may even withdraw them from the museum. These stipulations did not impede the Film Library's emphasis on the exhibi- tion value of its collection. Preservation was important (and eventually costly), but exhibition and circulation of the films were paramount. As a museum Bulletin ar- ticle on Film Library's founding noted, "a film two years old is a film which will not be seen again, and the situation is comparable to that which would be created in the world of literature if exclusively new books published within the past twelve months alone were available."32 The emphasis on circulating the films far and wide served not only to financially support the Film Library, but to increase accessibil- ity of the films, so people could respond directly to them rather than rely exclu- sively on textual descriptions. In going beyond the fine art market to collect film, not only was the museum denied its usual sources of artworks but it also lost a network of appraisers, judges, and critics, whose evaluative activity joined art sales prices as a means to measure the impact of the museum's exhibits and acquisitions.33 In their place, the museum had to gauge its influence from a much broader spectrum of responses: attendance at its screenings, news coverage and reviews, subsequent foundings of other archives and film societies, and general academic attention given to film. Nor were the Film Library staff members idly curious about such matters. Regular reports in the Museum of Modern Art Film Library Bulletin listed the increasing number of institutions that rented film programs from the museum.34 The museum also paid a news clipping service to collect all mentions of its name, and those that men- tioned the Film Library were compiled into twenty-two scrapbooks now held in the Film Study Center. Film Selection Criteria. Precisely because no art market circulated films, the museum loomed large as a bellwether in the aesthetic consecration of film. By naming certain films as art, the museum in essence created new art from nonart. Its approbation transformed business products into artworks whose true value the museum took pains to differentiate from box office receipts. The museum issued the following statement of intent to clarify what would guide its choices: "[The Film Library] will show commercial films of quality, amateur and 'avant-garde' films, and films of the past thirty years which are worth reviving because of their artistic quality or because of their importance in the development of the art. Gradu- ally it is hoped to accumulate a collection of films of historic and artistic value."35 In this statement the museum opened a back door for films whose acquisition might not be justifiable on aesthetic merits alone: their historic value. Films were artifactual evidence of times past that would otherwise be lost. The chemical in- stability of film, its rapid technological advances, and seismic shifts in fashion com- bined to prematurely age the medium during its infancy. The transition to sound production turned silent films into quaint relies of a bygone era. Indeed, Iris Barry Cinema Journal 36, No. 3, Spring 1997 63</page><page sequence="9">claimed the advent of talkies lent urgency to the idea of founding the Film Library in order to recapture the lost experience of the silent film accompanied by live musicians.36 The Film Library's concern for historical as well as artistic value aided its jus- tification for collecting Hollywood films in addition to foreign and experimental films that were more self-consciously artistic statements. Yet through methods similar to Barr's, the Film Library sought to link artistic crosscurrents between Hollywood and Europe.37 Thus, American film was integral to MoMA's art histori- cal narrative of film, not merely appended to it, in contrast to Alfred Barr's Eu- ropocentric view of painting and sculpture during the 1930s. To preempt complaints about Hollywood's output lacking an artistic pedigree, the Film Library sought those experts whose authority in matters of art criticism was more established than either Iris Barry's or the museum's. Barry called a lec- ture given at the museum by noted art historian Erwin Panofsky "a great feather in the Film Library's cap" for displaying his learned interest in Buster Keaton as well as medieval painting. Barry confessed, "Up till then I suspect that many aesthetes may have cast a dubious eye at my choice of films for the collection and might in- deed have preferred one confined more closely to purely experimental and 'art' films."38 Indeed, only a few critics of the period castigated Barry for being too exclu- sive in her tastes, even if later writers shuddered at the opportunities the museum missed to preserve history on film. One rare contemporary critic was Herb Sterne, who dubbed her in 1945 "the Attila of Films" for her dismissal of a silent cliffhanger serial, The Exploits of Elaine, as too "dull" to circulate.39 Much more re- cently, archivist Anthony Slide bemoaned Barry's initial rejection of a minor D. W Griffith film, A Romance of Happy Valley (1919), which was eagerly reversed when the museum was able to obtain a print decades later.40 Andrew Sarris, on the other hand, argued that the Film Library's selectivity made a virtue of ongoing funding limitations due in part to Hollywood's unwillingness to contribute financially to film preservation.41 Encompassing all of film within an art historical narrative was an enormous undertaking that benefited from the example set by Barr's genealogy of art move- ments. The Film Library's first two circulating film series traced the development of American film, including some early foreign film influences. These series in- cluded animation as part of that development. Disney's Steamboat Willie (1928) was offered on the same program with an excerpt of Alan Crosland's Jazz Singer (1927), a Movietone newsreel, and Lewis Milestone's All Quiet on the Western Front (1930) to illustrate the early talkies. The alternate program for projectors without sound placed Disney's Plane Crazy (1928) alongside von Sternberg's Last Command (1928) to depict the end of the silent era. Thus, Mickey Mouse was ac- corded a privileged position at the juncture of film's momentous transition to sound. In the second series, both Winsor McCay's Gertie the Dinosaur (1914) and Disney's Skeleton Dance (1929) were featured on a program devoted to comedies. 64 Cinema Journal 36, No. 3, Spring 1997</page><page sequence="10">They shared the bill with George M6libs's Hydrothdrapiefantastique [The Doctor's Secret] (1910), Mack Sennett's His Bitter Pill (1916), and Robert Benchley in The Sex Life of the Polyp (1928). The feature-length film on the program was a choice between one of two Harold Lloyd films: The Freshman (1925) or Safety Last (1923). Thus, the Film Library saw McCay and Disney not merely as animation producers but contributors to the American comedy genre.42 Creating an Art History of Animation. However, this did not prevent the Film Library from recontextualizing these films within a circulating program en- tirely devoted to animation. The fifty-minute-long program "A Short History of Animation" was initially made available in 1938,43 and a variant of it is still offered for rental in the museum's circulating film and video catalog.44 Because it offers a representation of animation that was widely circulated, I will discuss it in depth. Iris Barry's program notes placed the films in a historical narrative more narrowly focused than the above-mentioned series. She accorded animation status as its own branch of film with its own technological and aesthetic innovations. Barry's notes cited two early sources of animation scholarship, E. G. Lutz's Animated Cartoons and Earl Theisen's "History of the Animated Cartoon,"45 from which some of its narrative is drawn. Thus, interested students of animation could seek more in-depth information. The following summarizes the landmarks chron- icled in the program notes, letting stand some errors in production dates and attri- butions of primacy.46 Barry chronicled a progression of historical landmarks: the "Wheel of Life" optical toy and Emile Reynaud's The tre Optique were precursors to filmed car- toons; these were followed by the first cartoons-on-film, Humorous Phases of Funny Faces (1906) by J. Stuart Blackton and Fantasmagorie and Drame chez les Fantoches [A Love Affair in Toyland] (1907-8) by Emile Cohl. Other milestones she discussed were the first continuous series of animated cartoons, John R. Bray's Colonel Heeza Liar series in 1913; the first feature-length cartoon, The Sinking of the Lusitania by Winsor McCay; and the first anthropomorphic animal cartoon se- ries, Amadee Van Bueren's Aesop's Fables, beginning in 1917. I also wish to retain some inaccurate production dates for films included in the program itself.47 The program led off with Skladanowsky's magic lantern slides, filmed to show primitive animation (ca. 1879), followed by Cohl's Drame chez les Fantoches (1907-8), McCay's Gertie the Dinosaur (1909), a Mutt and Jeff film, The Big Swim (1927), and a Felix the Cat, Felix Gets the Can (1924). The last four of the nine shorts presented were Disney films: Newman's Laugh-O-Grams (1920), Steamboat Willie (1928), Flowers and Trees (1932), and Les Trois Petits Cochons (French-language version of The Three Little Pigs) (1933). An alternative program for 16 mm rather than 35 mm projectors replaced the last two films with Lotte Reiniger's Carmen (1933) and Disney's Mad Dog (1932), and these substitutions remain on the currently offered "Animation Program." As Barr traced a succession of innovations in artistic conventions, Barry's pro- gram notes included both technological and narrative milestones. She accorded Cinema Journal 36, No. 3, Spring 1997 65</page><page sequence="11">Steamboat Willie status as the first sound cartoon, claiming, "from the moment Disney added sound to his drawings, the whole medium gained new scope and vitality." Similarly, she credited Flowers and Trees as the first color sound cartoon. In fact, every film Disney donated at Iris Barry's request was a first of some kind: Disney's first animated film (Newman's Laugh-O-Grams), the first Mickey Mouse (Plane Crazy [1928]), the first Silly Symphony (Skeleton Dance [1929]), and the first Technicolor Mickey (The Band Concert [1935]). These represent not only ad- vances in technology but the Disney studio's aesthetic exploitation of new possibil- ities that the technology made available. Nor did Barry ignore extrafilmic influences. She noted that both comic strip characters (e.g., Mutt and Jeff) and artists (e.g., Blackton, Cohl, Bray, Earl Hurd, Raoul BarrY, and Bill Nolan) crossed over from newspapers. Rather than merely listing a series of firsts, she also discussed those who helped refine cartoons: Max Fleischer's Out of the Inkwell series combined live-action backgrounds with the cartoon character Koko; Pat Sullivan and Otto Messmer's Felix the Cat series helped establish the "anthropomorphic and folkloristic elements predominant today." In addition, Barry mentioned animators such as Earl Hurd, Bill Nolan, and Otto Messmer working under the studio heads, who usually got all the credit. Thus, packed into one and a half brief pages is a narrative neither parochially American nor snobbishly Europocentric. Iris Barry treated cartoons seriously as an art form, interpreting the development of animal protagonists as a notable innova- tion in narrative strategy, not a juvenilization of the medium. Rather than a scat- tered compendium of favorites, the program offers a historical progression of increasing complexity and assurance of technique. Recent historians have revised some of the above films' production dates and invalidated claims for their historical primacy, but this brief set of notes should not be held to current historiographic standards. It should be noted, however, that McCay's Sinking of the Lusitania was shorter than feature length, and his Gertie the Dinosaur premiered in 1914, not 1909.48 Additionally, sound cartoons by the Fleischers preceded those by Disney.49 Also, with other formats of color available prior to 1932, Flowers and Trees is better described as the first three-strip Techni- color sound cartoon.50 Are there other ways to look at animation history? Certainly. Differences in how animation production is organized might be included; animation's circulation within a variety of economic and political systems could also add complexity to a narrative of artistic progress.5' Even Alfred Barr's Cubism and Abstract Art catalog came under fire at the time of its publication when Meyer Schapiro accused Barr of isolating artworks from the historical, social, and economic positions of the artists who created them.52 However, it is the museum's prerogative to recontextu- alize what it examines into an aesthetic framework. As Christopher Phillips notes about the museum's photography department, "a crucial feature of MoMA's criti- cal apparatus [is] the projection of the critical concerns of one's own day onto a wide range of photographs of the past that were not originally intended as art."""53 If Barry had to wait until filmmakers acknowledged that what they produced was art 66 Cinema Journal 36, No. 3, Spring 1997</page><page sequence="12">before she could consider their work, the Film Library might never have come into being. The circulating film programs were repeatedly shown within the museum once its new building opened in 1939 (as well as in the Museum of Natural His- tory's auditorium before that). For several years, the program A Brief History of Animation was offered as a special children's program. Two others grouped with it were a Georges M6lies retrospective and Three French Film Pioneers, which fea- tured animator Emile Cohl along with trick film creators Ferdinand Zecca and Jean Durand. The museum's announcement, quoted in several newspapers, in- sisted that the programs "represent the taste of children themselves rather than, as in the case of most 'specially arranged' juvenile programs, the tastes or principles of adults.""54 In this way, the museum pressed the films into service for young audi- ences without necessarily ghettoizing them as merely children's films. The museum also presented animation in other ways. In the summer of 1939, guest curator Joseph Losey organized a twenty-two-film retrospective of animation that mixed examples of many techniques: cel, pin screen, stop-motion puppets, silhouette, and painting-on-film. Abstraction coexisted with narrative, drama with humor. Hans Richter, Len Lye, Alexandre AlexeYeff, and Wladyslaw Starewicz were among those international experimenters who shared the screen with Walt Disney, Walter Lantz, and Winsor McCay.55 The retrospective sup- ported Iris Barry's art historical narrative by dividing the branch of film devoted to animation into separate national traditions: French, American, English, Ger- man, and Russian. Meanwhile, experimental animation was included in a special program, Ab- stract Films, offered at the museum in April 1940. Animation was not the defining aspect of these films but one of many techniques the filmmakers used. Overlap- ping with Losey's animation program were Hans Richter's Rhythmus 21 (1921) and Len Lye's Colour Box (1935). In addition, all films on the program but Marcel Duchamp's Anemic Cinema (1926) included at least some animation. Len Lye's Swinging the Lambeth Walk (1939), B. G. D. Salt's X + X = A Syn Nt (1937), and Parabola (1937) and Escape (1939) by Mary Ellen Bute and Ted Nemeth were all animated films. Also, both Fernand L6ger's Ballet micanique (1924) and Man Ray's Emak-Bakia (1927) contained some animation. One tongue-in-cheek review commented on the films, "none of their producers seem to appreciate their fitness for comic uses,"56 which may refer to the generic role that dominated animation in contrast to the incomprehensibility of these works. Other contexts in which the museum presented animation through the mid- 1940s included the contribution of cartoons to wartime training films (e.g., several Pvt. Snafu cartoons in Army-Navy Screen Magazines) and propaganda films (e.g., Disney's Chicken Little [1943], Len Lye's Musical Poster No. 1 [1940]), educa- tional films (e.g., The Pacific Problem [1934] by de Hubsch), dance in film (e.g., Disney's Skeleton Dance [1929]), and musical composition for film (e.g., Tex Avery's Screwball Squirrel [1944]). This variety indicates how the war years gave the Museum of Modern Art an opportunity to help recast animation into a Cinema Journal 36, No. 3, Spring 1997 67</page><page sequence="13">medium of adult pedagogy and persuasion, serious pursuits for something stereo- typed as children's entertainment. Displaying Animation Production Art. All these uses for animation did not detract from the museum's consideration of it as an art form. One other aspect of animation deserves mention: it provided the museum with unique, handcrafted objects to display. The Film Library's construction of an art historical lineage for animation was aided by its production artwork in traditional fine arts media such as drawing and painting. These materials resembled what circulated in the art world and could be assimilated into that world. As part of its April 1940 Abstract Films screenings, the museum collected and exhibited items of artwork from abstract ani- mated films of Douglass Crockwell, Howard Lester, Horace Pierce, and Mary Ellen Bute.57 On several occasions, art of the Disney Studio received similar treatment. In fact, Disney's initial donation to the Museum of Modern Art in 1935 provided at Iris Barry's request "material selected to show step-by-step the various processes in the production of Mickey Mouse and Silly Symphony cartoons." These included not only sketches, drawings, paintings, and cels but scenario suggestions and expo- sure sheets.5s They were prepared for exhibition in 1938.59 Again in 1942, the museum exhibited Disney production art, this time in con- junction with the studio's release of the feature film Bambi. The museum thus helped convert by-products of the animation process into artworks deserving dis- play and attention in their own right. Critic Emily Genauer objected to this con- version, claiming the Bambi exhibit "has no more significance as art than would an exhibition which showed you how canvas is woven, pigments are ground and camels hunted for the hair which makes an artist's brush."60 However, museums have long displayed preliminary sketches for paintings and murals. The Museum of Modern Art followed such other cultural institutions as the Philadelphia Art Alliance, the Leicester Galleries of London, and the New York Public Library in redefining commercial by-products as fine art through the exhi- bition of Disney production art.61 Disney had already attempted to market original cels in department stores, but these exhibits might have suggested that the art was better suited for galleries.62 Conclusion. When the Museum of Modem Art Film Library sought to include commercial Hollywood films in its collection, it encountered an elitist disdain for mass-produced popular culture on the one hand and an incredulous group of busi- ness owners on the other. Had the museum restricted its interest to independently produced experimental and avant-garde films, it might have had a much easier time. Independent filmmakers recognize the museum's role in presenting their work to a select appreciative audience and donate films more readily than do entertainment companies, whose films represent corporate assets. However, Iris Barry and her col- leagues held the conviction that popular entertainment was to be preserved and cherished as art, despite the difficulties involved in acquiring and archiving it. The 68 Cinema Journal 36, No. 3, Spring 1997</page><page sequence="14">demands of this project taxed the museum's resources, requiring the Film Library staff to acquiesce to restrictive rights of usage to satisfy Hollywood donors. Simultaneously, the museum had to placate conservative trustees and elite art world members whose skepticism of movies was best countered by placing film into familiar art historical contexts. Iris Barry's curatorial strategy was similar to Alfred Barr's in that it accentuated artistic innovations and influences across the entire global field of film production. This had the effect of making the Museum of Modern Art much more inclusive of art spanning the popular versus elite cul- ture hierarchy. The museum's early inclusion of animation was aided by such items as the drawings and paintings required for its production, which could be hung on the walls much as other art in the museum was displayed. Yet the circulation and screening of films took precedence over the cult value of such items. That empha- sis continues today in the museum's Department of Film and Video. Notes 1.

At times, Alfred Barr felt the need to justify his selections to the trustees in terms of monetary investments. When requesting a raise in salary, he claimed that "the pur- chases and exchanges which were made on my recommendation have increased in value more rapidly than those made by any other American museum during the same period" (quoted in Marquis, Alfred H. Barr, Jr, 213). 34. The Museum of Modern Art Film Library Bulletin 1938-39 stated its circulating film programs during the previous season went to 175 institutions; the Bulletin 1940 cited circulation to 280 institutions; the Bulletin 1941 cited 345 institutions; and the catalog 16 and 35mm Circulating Film Programs, 1944-45 cited 801 institutions.

Corrections to the program notes are as follows. See Donald Crafton, Before Mickey: The Animated Film, 1898-1928 (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1982; Chicago: Uni- versity of Chicago Press, 1993) for a discussion of the complexities involved in identify- ing the first animated film. He pointed to evidence that James Stuart Blackton and Albert E. Smith may have discovered the technique of stop-motion animation as early as 1898 (20-21). He also indicated that Cohl produced both Fantasmagorie (62) and Un drame chez lesfantoches (85) in 1908. Crafton cited the release date of March 16, 1913, for Cohl's animated series The Newlyweds (81), which predated the June 12, 1913, release date of J. R. Bray's first film, The Artist's Dream (143), as well as the Jan- uary 14, 1914, release date of his first Colonel Heeza Liar, Colonel Heeza Liar's African Hunt (148). Crafton's Emile Cohl, Caricature, and Film (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1990) treats Cohl in much greater depth. Bendazzi, Cartoons, 49-52, discussed the Argentine animator Quirino Cristiani, who produced the seventy- minute-long El Ap6stol [The Apostle], first screened on November 9, 1917. This pre- ceded the July 20, 1918, release date for The Sinking of the Lusitania given by John Canemaker in Winsor McCay: His Life and Art (New York: Abbeville Press, 1987), 154. Indeed, Canemaker quotes McCay's claim that the film required 25,000 pictures to create, which, at one picture per frame and sixteen frames per second, would be twenty-six minutes long or the length of a two-reeler. Crafton also mentioned in Before Mickey several instances of animal protagonists appearing in series prior to Van Bueren's Aesop's Fables (287-89). 47. Corrected production dates for films on the program are as follows. Canemaker, Winsor McCay, 143, gave the vaudeville premiere of Gertie the Dinosaur as February 1914. Rus- sell Merritt and J. B. Kaufman, Walt in Wonderland: The Silent Films of Walt Disney, rev. ed. (Pordenone, Italy: Le Giomate del Cinema Muto, 1993), 38, offered the release date of March 20, 1921, for the Newman's Laugh-O-Grams sample reel. In The Encyclope- dia of Animated Cartoons (New York: Facts on File, 1991), 37, Jeff Lenberg gave the re- lease date for The Big Swim as October 1, 1926. 48. See notes 44 and 45 regarding corrections to the McCay claims. 49. Mark Langer's "Disney-Fleischer Dilemma: Product Differentiation and Technological Innovation," Screen 33 (winter 1992) indicated that the Fleischers produced an ani- mated sound "Song Car-Tunes" series from 1924 to 1926 (353). 50. In Enchanted Drawings: The History of Animation (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1989), 89, Charles Solomon discussed Walter Lantz's two-and-a-half-minute animated pro- logue of the Universal feature King of Jazz (1930) as the first color sound cartoon. It used Technicolor's two-strip process. 51. For an example of valuable historiographic revisionism, see Langer, "The Disney- Fleischer Dilemma," which critiques approaches to Disney that depict him as a "great man" rather than as head of an expanding and complex entertainment organization in competition with rivals such as the Fleischer Studio. 52.
