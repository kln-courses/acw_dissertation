Murphy Department of Zoology, Washington State University, Pullman, Washington 99164-4220 Synopsis. An animal's nutritional status depends on (1) nutrient accessibility, (2) nutrient demand, and (3) physiological, metabolic, morphological, and behavioral compensations that avert or minimize discrepancies, if any, between the first two. The main thesis of this essay is that the diversity and potency of such compensatory mechanisms have often been underrated, and hence the frequency and intensity of nutritional stress in free-living animals have often been exaggerated. This theme is explored in conjunction with an inven- tory of the modes of compensation for actual or potential dietary deficiencies. Introduction The subtitle of this essay, "fact or fic- tion," might just as well have been "fact and fiction." It is known from sound evi? dence that endotherms sometimes die or fail to reproduce because of starvation or hypothermia. That is a fact. There is an ample literature of such accounts, most of it anecdotal and some of it dramatic (e.g., Gessaman and Worthen, 1982). The sum- mary of a typical publication might be: "I toured the woods after a bad snowstorm and found many dead birds and some deer that seemed very weak." Most reports are more thorough than this rhetorical exam? ple, but all fall into one category: positive evidence of episodic death or debilitation, sometimes as a result of malnutrition. The countering evidence, since it is negative, is rarely published. One can easily imagine the reaction ofa journal editor to a manu? script whose summary might be: "I toured the woods after a bad snowstorm and did not find any dead birds or scrawny deer." It is, of course, the positive evidence that lingers in mind and comes to dominate our impressions. The negative evidence is neglected. As a result, we feel that some questionable perspectives and a few out- right mistakes (the "fiction" of our subti? tle) have persisted in nutritional ecology for an uncommonly long period of time, and should be subjected to a bit of skep- 1 From the Symposium on Animal Energetics: Amphibians, Reptiles, and Birds presented at the Annual Meeting of the American Society of Zoologists, 27- 30 December 1983, at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. ticism. In particular, we are skeptical about two attitudes. First, in spite of recent advances in nutri- tional ecology, the viewpoint seems to remain widespread in certain circles that the attainment of adequate nutrition by endotherms in nature is a relentless chal- lenge. For instance, this viewpoint surfaces as an assumption in recent theories of com? petition, optimal foraging, and space or resource defense, and is also often invoked to explain periodic shifts in body mass or composition of animals. The prevalence of such a viewpoint is an enigma if we stop to consider how little we know ofthe nutrient requirements of free-living endotherms. It seems to us that it is unjustified to assume, and even more so to conclude, that there is "not enough" when "enough" has not been defined. The second commonplace attitude (a corollary of the first) that warrants skep- ticism is that the annual cycle of endo? therms necessarily includes periods of nu- tritional stress. Because processes such as molt, reproduction, or winter thermoreg- ulation each involve a "price" that is pre- sumably added to the maintenance requirement, these periods of the annual cycle have often been singled out as nutri- tional bottlenecks (times when malnutri- tion is most likely to take its toll). This line of reasoning is qualitatively sound as far as it goes, but is ultimately ambiguous. An increased nutrient requirement is a burden to an animal only if the animal is already exploiting its environment fully to support maintenance functions alone. Otherwise, 955</page><page sequence="2">956 T- R- King and M. E. Murphy there is some buffer in nutrient supply to support production and other demands above the maintenance level. Further? more, the extent of this buffer depends not only on the difference between an animal's maintenance requirement and nutrient supply, but also on the animals's metabolic and behavioral plasticity. In actuality, the viewpoint that nutri? tional poverty is imminent in the lives of endotherms springs more from deductive reasoning than from empirical facts. It seems to us that, in most cases, there are but two incontrovertible facts about the connection between animal welfare, ani? mal numbers, and nutrient supply. First, animal numbers do not increase indefi- nitely. Something counteracts the inherent growth of populations. Second, animals sometimes die of starvation or fail to repro- duce because they are malnourished. From these two facts it follows only that food sup? ply is a plausible limiting factor (and prob? ably the ultimate limiting factor) in the absence of other constraints. It seems, however, that the maxim that food supply is the ultimate regulator of animal num? bers in the theoretical sense has been trans- lated into the non sequitur that food supply must also be the prepotent proximate reg? ulator. Put another way, this reasoning implies that because animal populations are regulated somehow, there must be a lot of malnourished animals. The prevalence of such deductions has biased our viewpoints for a long time, and alternative viewpoints from multiple sources have only recently begun to surface. In the examples that fol- low we attempt to illustrate that the ani? mals themselves are telling us that they are not the victims of chronic or recurrent nutritional poverty. Elements of Adjustment to Variable Nutrient Availability Unlike their domesticated counterparts, free-living animals typically confront a dynamic profile of nutrient accessibility in terms of both quality and quantity. Although, in the minds of many, this fact may immediately conjure up visions of per- iodic malnutrition, at least two distinct advantages are associated with such vari? ability. First, variability of food types pro? vides options for selective feeding and dietary complementation that enable an animal to "formulate" nutritionally ade- quate whole diets from a variety of indi- vidually subadequate food types (Thomp- son, 1982, p. 18). Secondly, the dynamic profile of nutrient accessibility through time may include periods of surfeit nutri- tion when an animal can accumulate nutrient reserves. These reserves can later be mobilized either to complement or to substitute for dietary input when food is short (see beyond). In the first case, an ani- mal's vital functions are supported and protected by exogenous/exogenous nutrient complementation, while the sec? ond case involves exogenous/endogenous complementation. The continuous exog- enous supply of all essential nutrients to an animal is the most obvious case of adequate nutrition, and may in fact describe the rule in nature. It is less obvious that transient reliance on stored nutrients or recruitment of alternative compensatory mechanisms when exogenous nutrients are scarce can likewise result in adequate nutrition. In evaluating the nutritional status of free-living endotherms we have chosen to concentrate on examples in which animals use compensatory mechanisms to adjust to variable nutrient accessibility. It is these episodes that are most likely to be misdi- agnosed as malnutrition or nutritional stress. Compensatory mechanisms Nutritional limitations may result from a direct scarcity of food in terms of either quantity or quality, or from an indirect scarcity. Indirect scarcity results from the resolution of competing demands (e.g., defense against predators, courtship, incu? bation, sheltering against bad weather) that subtract from the time available for for- aging. Furthermore, scarcity may be either episodic and unpredictable or regularly recurring, as on a seasonal basis. The potential interactions of these sources of variability in nutrient supply provide a rich matrix for the diversification of compen? satory mechanisms that buffer animals</page><page sequence="3">Nutritional Ecology of Endotherms 957 against either direct or indirect privation. The efficacy of such compensations in fore- stalling nutritional stress until conditions improve defines an animal's zone of tol- erance. In general, compensatory mecha? nisms include (1) building and drawing on nutrient reserves, (2) reducing or reallo- cating nutrient expenditures, and (3) com? binations of the two. Nutrient reserves Surplus nutrients may be accumulated either as food (exogenous reserves) or its metabolites (endogenous reserves). The storage of surplus food in caches is perhaps the exception rather than the rule among endotherms, but is nevertheless wide- spread among both mammals (Hamilton, 1939) and birds (Calder and King, 1974). Both carnivores and herbivores cache food, but the habit is understandably more com? mon among the latter. Food hoarding is most highly developed in small-bodied non- hibernating or non-migratory herbivores (e.g., beavers and smaller) and in many cases is crucial to overwinter survival. For instance, Haftorn (1956) estimated that as much as 60% of the midwinter food supply of Great Tits in Sweden is obtained from hoards accumulated during the autumn. On a briefer time-scale, food may be retained or stored in the anterior parts of the digestive tract as a reserve to aid over- night survival. This form of external stor? age is rare, but is an indispensable element of the energy budget of several species of boreal birds that possess capacious crops or esophageal diverticula that they pack with food before retiring at dusk to their nighttime refuges (Calder and King, 1974). Endogenous reserves may function to buffer the results of a general food short- age, as in fasting, or shortages of specific nutrients. The annual cycle of the Emperor Penguin provides an extreme example of reliance on endogenous reserves. These birds feed only sporadically, and subsist during long periods of fasting (1-4 months) on reserves accumulated during their for? aging cycles. Egg-laying, incubation, and molt are all accompanied by absolute fast? ing during which endogenous reserves sup? ply the full complement of energy and spe- cific nutrients needed for self-maintenance and production. The characteristics of long-term fasting by penguins do not differ in any conspicuous way from those of the domestic goose (Le Maho, 1983), and are probably an extreme exaggeration of ubiq- uitous metabolic capacities. Several species of geese that nest in the Arctic rely on endogenous reserves while fasting during egg-laying and incubation (Ryder, 1970; Ankney and Maclnnes, 1978; Raveling, 1979), and illustrate this point. Lactating Gray Seals (Davies, 1949) and rutting Red Deer (Mitchell et al, 1976) and Elephant Seals (Bartholomew, 1952) also depend on a tolerance of fasting to enable them to carry out these reproductive activities. We suggest that "fasting" be purged of anthropocentric connotations and viewed in an ecological context as not necessarily a nutritional stress, but in many cases as a tactic for averting stress in the face of com? peting demands for time or other resources. The foregoing examples concerned gen- eralized food shortage and the resultant release from reserves of a profile of nutrients that efficiently fulfills metabolic requirements. Stores or reserves of specific compounds are also evident in certain cases, and can be drawn upon to counteract spe? cific dietary deficiencies. There are exam? ples from all of the major classes of nutrients. The role of lipid storage in over- night energy homeostasis and as a buffer against energy shortages during migration or winter, for instance, is too well known to merit discussion here (for review, see Pond [1981], and several papers in the symposium convened by Derickson [1976]). Whether amino acids are stored as peptides or proteins solely in anticipation of future need is not clear. The annual cycles of pro? tein mass that have been detected in var? ious species (e.g., Ankney and Maclnnes, 1978; Raveling, 1979; Kendall etal, 1973) may, in fact, be the result of selection for maximum protein reserves in times of potential need, akin to the better-known cycles of fat storage. However, the ebb and flow of protein mass is also related to use/ disuse and attendant hypertrophy/atro- phy, and so it is difficult to distinguish prox? imate and ultimate causes. Regardless of</page><page sequence="4">958 J. R. King and M. E. Murphy the impetus for protein accretion, it is well documented that amino acids can be with- drawn from muscle protein (Fisher, 1967; Swick and Benevenga, 1977) or from pep? tides such as glutathione (Tateishi et al, 1977) or carnosine (Baker, 1977) for use elsewhere in the body. Relatively little is known about specific storage of vitamins and minerals, but it is nevertheless clear that the body contains reserves of many such nutrients. Fat-solu- ble vitamins accumulate in adipocytes and are liberated during lipolysis. At least cer? tain water-soluble vitamins accumulate in hepatocytes, and presumably can be with- drawn when need exceeds dietary income (Kodicek, 1954). Among the minerals, bone as a reserve of calcium is the most thor? oughly studied example; but whether bone can function also as a selective reserve of other minerals is still controversial (Mur- ray and Messer, 1981; Tao et al, 1983). Various chelates of minerals, such as zinc- metallothionein complexes (Whanger et al, 1981), potentially also function as stores or reserves of certain minerals. Our ignorance of the nutritional pro- grams and capacities of free-living animals in all but a handful of cases has obliged us to rely thus far on studies of domestic ani? mals when trying to understand the sig? nificance of nutrient reserves in natural settings. We are fearful that this may leave us with a myopic view of the role of nutrient reserves in wild animals. In the first place, practical nutritionists have no commercial reason to search for nutrient reserves, and so may have overlooked them. In the sec? ond place, nutritionists typically study domestic animals, in which selection for nutrient reserves has been relaxed if not absent for untold generations. Nutritional economies For convenience, we have summarized the mechanisms by which animals mini- mize nutrient expenditures in the cate- gories of adult self-maintenance and production, respectively, with the under? standing that these categories often over- lap and interact. Economies in self-main? tenance involve hypothermia, adaptive reduction of body mass, and various kinds of behavioral adjustments. Regulated reductions of body tempera? ture may be mild, as in day-to-day torpor in birds and mammals, or may be pro? found, as in mammalian hibernation or aestivation. Although adaptive hypother- mia has usually been regarded as mainly an energy-sparing mechanism, it also slows the depletion of any kind of nutrient reserve. Seasonal hibernation is dependent on an endogenous rhythm in at least some species of mammals, and thus reflects the evolution of a regulatory system that antic- ipates the recurrence of intolerable sea? sons. Daily torpor, in contrast, is most com? monly linked to immediate shortages of food (Calder and King, 1974; Hudson, 1978). Energy economies can be impres- sive, for instance amounting to an average reduction of 88% relative to the euthermic metabolic rate in Richardson's Ground Squirrel during hibernation (Wang, 1978). Substantial metabolic economy results also from shallower nighttime (or daytime) tor? por (e.g., Tucker, 1965; Chaplin, 1974). Even small tropical birds, apparently in response to sporadic food shortages, accrue noteworthy savings (58%) by hypothermia through a 12-hr night (Bartholomew et al, 1983). Reductions of body mass by wild animals have typically been interpreted as a loss of "condition" in response to environmental stress. Recently, however, several investi- gators have delineated cases in which loss of body mass is voluntary, beneficial, and perhaps an expression of adaptive anorexia (Mrosovsky and Sherry, 1980). We have already mentioned the astonishing perfor- mance of Emperor Penguins, which make themselves independent of a remote food supply by long-term fasting. Other animals undergo periodic mass losses even when food is freely available?for instance, over- wintering deer (Wood et al, 1962; Silver etal, 1969)orducks(Reinecke^a/., 1982), incubating birds (Sherry et al, 1980), birds feeding nestlings (Freed, 1981), and birds initiating the annual molt (Chilgren, 1977; Murphy and King, 1984). In the cases just cited, it is clear that mass loss is an innately programmed process that will occur even</page><page sequence="5">Nutritional Ecology of Endotherms 959 in captives with easy access to food. The evolutionary impetus for adaptive anorex- ias and attendant loss of body mass no doubt has differed among species and phases of the annual cycle. Freed (1981) suggested that mass loss reduces wing-loading and the costs of flying (by an estimated 23%) in small birds that are foraging to feed nest? lings. Sherry et al (1980) thought that it allows better nest attentiveness during incubation. Loss of body mass in wintering deer and ducks is thought to reduce energy demands both in transporting the body and in maintaining it. Pre-molt body-mass loss in birds may be an adjustment that reduces wing-loading and the hazard of damage to regenerating remiges. Behavioral adjustments to nutritional challenge are probably far more common and important than we currently perceive, and occur as genotypic adaptations of life style as well as phenotypic adjustments to day-by-day exigencies. As shown by the sample of activity budgets assembled by Herbers (1981), many species of birds and mammals spend the large majority of their daily activity periods "resting," and a much smaller proportion in foraging. Ettinger and King (1980) also highlighted this phe- nomenon, and proposed that the ostensibly idle time in the daily routine served as a buffer against unpredictable episodes of energy shortage, or other stresses that affect nutrient budgets indirectly. Herbers called this inactivity "laziness," and Ettin? ger and King called it "loafing." Both terms are anthropomorphic and should be replaced by a neutral descriptor. "Idle? ness" might suffice until a better term sur- faces. The origin and meaning of idleness in activity budgets merits much more debate than we can afford in this essay. The simplest of the alternative hypotheses (and hence the one favored by the rule of par- simony) is that endotherms can afford idle? ness because they are not usually con- fronted by food shortage, or that idleness reflects satiety. Proximate adjustments of the activity budgets and other kinds of facultative behavioral compensations are also known. Two examples will have to suffice. Many species of birds sharply curtail locomotor activity during the annual molt (see King [1980] for review). Although this "conser? vation of movement" undoubtedly results in a reduction of energy expenditure in this category of the budget, it is not at all clear whether the impetus for the reduc? tion is to compensate for the energy costs of molt (as is commonly assumed), or to minimize damage to regenerating feath- ers, or simply a reflection of impaired abil? ity to fly. Many kinds of voluntary behaviors are known that alleviate heat or cold stress (Cabanac, 1979). Perhaps one ofthe most spectacular examples of this is the hud? dling of Emperor Penguins during their periods of fasting during the antarctic win? ter. Le Maho et al. (1976) estimated that these birds would not be able to balance their heat budget unless they huddled together. Finally, nutrient economies accrue from improvements in the efficiency with which nutrients are utilized. Improved efficiency can result from decreased excretion or oxi- dation of a substrate, or from enhanced digestion, transport, or assimilation. The ability of rabbits and macropods to subsist in sodium-poor montane regions of Aus- tralia depends on the capacity of these ani? mals to minimize sodium excretion in the urine, feces, and saliva, and to exploit a specific sodium appetite (Blair-West et al, 1968). Winter-dormant black bears, by means of shifts of protein kinetics that favor the re-utilization of amino acids, maintain a stable lean body mass in spite of a 15- 25% decrease of total body mass during the winter (Lundberg et al, 1976). Shifts of gut morphology and presumably the efficiency of digestion and absorption are often correlated with shifts of food types or with stages of the annual cycle (Sibly, 1981). Finally, it is often argued that the heat increments of feeding and of loco? motion can substitute for thermostatic heat production in the cold, but the subject is controversial (Paladino and King, 1984). In sum, there are many options for the frugal use of nutrients. Some of them offer only small advantages, but it is through the summation of small advantages that selec? tion leads to successful organisms.</page><page sequence="6">960 J. R. King and M. E. Murphy Productive processes By "production" we mean recrudes- cence of reproductive organs, formation of gametes, pregnancy, lactation and the analogous esophageal secretions of birds, postnatal growth, and the replacement of the integument during molt. The forma? tion of storage products, such as fat, and special phases of external work, as in migration, are also productive processes in the formal sense, but have relatively non- specific nutrient demands (i.e., any energy- yielding substrate). Because the costs of production are added to the costs of self-maintenance, periods of production are commonly regarded as "bottlenecks" in the annual cycle. We think that this viewpoint exag- gerates the average case, even though it may be true in the extreme. We have already reviewed many of the adjustments that an animal can deploy in coping with the added costs of production (e.g., partial or complete reliance on reserves, various economies in maintenance costs), and so we concentrate attention here on the ways in which production itself can be adjusted to conform with limitations of nutrient supply. A general point is germane, how? ever, before we begin this inventory. An increase of food requirements, as may occur during production, is typically viewed as an ecological burden, but nevertheless entrains compensating advantages. The increased food intake associated with increased energy demands automatically results in an increased supply of all nutrients (Thompson and Boag, 1976; Murphy and King, 1984). This means that the specific nutrient requirements of either mainte? nance or production can be satisfied with foods of lower quality when energy flow through the organism is high. In the case of production alone, it is the ratio of the increments of energy and specific nutrients that will determine the variety or quality of foods that will sustain production. The ways in which animals can avert or reduce the strains of production include seasonal programs that minimize the over- lap of nutritionally demanding events or permit storage in one season in prepara- tion for a later event, compensating reduc? tions in the units of production (eggs, fetuses) or in the rate of production (molt, lactation, growth), or in extremis the sus- pension or deletion of production. The idea that selection has programmed the annual cycle of animals so as to avert or minimize the overlap of nutritionally expensive events has been repeated so often as to seem a truism. Such non-overlap does indeed minimize per diem nutrient demands, but this interpretation has then been transmuted rather often into the viewpoint that each event is itself stressful or imminently so. We hesitate to invoke nutritional selection pressures as the only, or even most important, factors that have guided the evolution of annual cycle pat? terns in endotherms. There are alternative hypotheses that are no more speculative than the nutrient-limitation hypothesis. It is equally likely, for instance, that molt is relegated to a phase of the annual cycle in which flying time can be minimized so as to reduce damage to soft, regenerating feathers. In short, we think that the typical annual cycle, with its segregation of events, is the result of selection for a life-history program that averts or at least minimizes the various strains of competing processes. Whether any given phase of the annual cycle is itself potentially stressful in nutri? tional terms is a separate question that in most cases still needs an empirical answer. Some ofthe options for nutritional com- promises when production and self-main- tenance compete for limited substrates have already been described in relation to adjustment of patterns of self-mainte- nance. Additional options involve adjust- ments of production itself. Some of these are unit reductions, as in clutch size (e.g., Bengston, 1971; Jones and Ward, 1976; Ankney and Maclnnes, 1978), or number of concepta (Cheatum, 1947; Bodenhei- mer, 1949; Huey, 1956; Viljoen, 1981; Thomas, 1982). Others involve the slow- ing of processes that are not susceptible to unit reductions, such as growth (Ricklefs, 1983), molt (French etal, 1956; Ling, 1970; Kendeigh [in Tollefson, 1982]; M. E. Mur-</page><page sequence="7">Nutritional Ecology of Endotherms 961 phy, unpublished data), lactation (Rook and Witter, 1968; Widdowson and Cowen, 1972), and gestation (Racey, 1981). Deletion or cessation of production is the ultimate response to food shortage when an animal's compensatory options have been used up. It appears that the endocrine system of endotherms has been pro- grammed to suspend reproductive pro? cesses before affecting production for self- maintenance, as would be advantageous for iteroparous animals. Mulinos and Pom- rantz (1940) described the prompt endo? crine responses leading to reproductive failure in malnourished animals as "pseu- dohypophysectomy." We suppose that this mechanism improves adult survival and the opportunity for future reproduction. Production for self-maintenance appears to be much more resistant to malnutrition than does reproduction. It is well known that somatic growth slows but nevertheless continues in malnourished subadults. Less is known about the responses of molt to malnutrition. Mammals may delay and pro- long the molt and produce rough coats (Ling, 1970) when on restricted diets, but evidently continue to molt. Molt in House Sparrows fed a diet containing 9% protein was described as "normal," but was pro- longed and of lesser intensity in other House Sparrows fed diets containing 3% protein, and "intermediate" when the diet contained 5% protein. There were no con- sistent differences of body mass or energy metabolism among the groups (Kendeigh [in Tollefson, 1982]). Exploratory experi- ments (unpublished) in our laboratory have shown that severe food restriction (75 and 50% of ad libitum intake) or nutrient defi- ciencies (a valine-free diet) reduce body mass to near-lethal levels and proportion- ately reduce the rate of feather growth in White-crowned Sparrows, but do not stop feather growth completely. The ultimate significance of nutritional compromises in self-maintenance and pro? duction resides in the ways in which these adjustments are translated into inclusive fitness. This is an intricate topic in the realm of evolutionary ecology that is beyond the scope of this essay. Nevertheless, we hope that we have succeeded, in this necessarily brief account, in casting some perspectives and unearthing some evidence that will help biologists to view old subjects in new ways. It seems obvious now that an animaFs nutritional status can be properly evalu- ated only in the context of its own life- history pattern, with attention paid not only to nutritional requirements and accessibil? ity, but also to the repertoire of adjust- ments available to the animal to avert or minimize discrepancies between the two. It is this integrated viewpoint that is the essence of nutritional ecology. Appendix There are three terms used in the fore- going essay that we find troublesome because they have been used by various authors in diverse ways, and often without being defined at all. We believe that it is important to state the definitions that we implied in our essay, but our intramural referees objected that a glossary inter- rupted the flow of logic when included in the text. Hence, we relegated it to this Appendix. Nutritional stress Discordant usages of the word "stress" (Franz, 1981) have rendered this descrip- tor nearly meaningless in the sense that the prospects for a standard definition seem forlorn. Nevertheless, it also seems unlikely that the term will be abandoned, and so we must attempt to cope with it. For use in nutritional ecology, we borrow, with certain modifications (italicized), Ankney's definition (1979): ". . . a situation in which [an animal's] nutrient demands exceed its nutrient ingestion, resulting in net catab- olism in body tissues to the extent that one or more vital physiological functions are impaired." Any depletion of reserves short of this result does not reflect "stress" in our lex- icon, but merely the functioning of an ani? mal within its limits of tolerance. Nutrient stores Storage means the accumulation in the body, in anticipation of a future need, of any nutrient for which there is no imme-</page><page sequence="8">962 J. R. King and M. E. Murphy diate metabolic demand (Pond, 1981). Gly- cogen storage and triglyceride storage are the most obvious examples, and the accu- mulation of calcium in the medullary bone of female birds shortly before egg-laying is another clear-cut case (Simkiss, 1975). Nutrient reserves Reserves are compounds that are stored in the aforementioned sense plus any other tissue components that can be drawn upon to forestall stress, but are not otherwise demonstrably accumulated for the purpose of buffering potentially stressful condi? tions. Examples include bone calcium that is resorbed in the event of calcium priva- tion (Simkiss, 1975), and muscle protein that serves as a supply of amino acids for both energy and synthesis of proteins needed elsewhere. The distinction between "stores" and "reserves" may seem trivial in analyzing proximate metabolic adjust? ments, but is nevertheless crucial in under? standing the ultimate origin of these adjustments. Storage is the result of geno- typic adaptation, but other categories of reserves result from phenotypic plasticity.
