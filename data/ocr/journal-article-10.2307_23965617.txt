<plain_text><page sequence="1">The The Faces of the Chariot. Early Jewish Responses to Ezekiel's Vision.Vision. By David J. Halperin. Pp. xxi + 610. (Texte und Studien zum Antiken Judentum, 16.) Tubingen: Mohr, 1988. DM 178. This is a major study of the origins of the Jewish mystical traditions associated with the merkabah (Ezekiel's vision of the enthroned deity) and has significant implications regarding the relationship between the 'merkabah-mystical' hekhalot literature, rabbinic tradition, and Apocalyptic. The classical rabbinic sources convey a mixture of enthusiasm and terror concerning the merka bah,bah, and Halperin sets out to explain this mixed but always extreme reaction. Chapter 1 summarizes the arguments advanced in his earlier book, The Merkabah in Rabbinic Literature (New Haven, 1980), which call into question Scholem's hypothesis that Apocalyptic and hekhalot literature were historically linked by a tradition of ecstatic, visionary mysticism practised by the tan na'im.na'im. Halperin's theory is that the tanna'im sought to restrict public exegesis of the merkabah-\'\s\on because of concern about extravagant expositions by synagogue preachers and their effect on the popular imagination: the fictional image of ma'aseh merkabah as an esoteric tradition was produced by combining the tannaitic restrictions with a genre of 'wonder stories' generated by the movement against which they were directed. In my doctoral dissertation (Cambridge, 1988) I have questioned many of Halper in's findings and defended a modified version of Scholem's theory: I suggest that an esoteric, visionary-mystical tradition was inher ited from apocalyptic circles by some tanna'im but opposed by others. If accepted, my arguments undermine the historical recon struction on which much of The Faces of the Chariot is based. None the less, Halperin's thematic analysis of the traditions has</page><page sequence="2">586 REVIEWS considerable value, and by drawing together a wealth of source material he has performed a major service. Chapters 2 and 3 deal with the pre-rabbinic sources: Masoretic Text, LXX, the 'Angelic Liturgy' from Qumran and the Apocalypses. The visions de scribed by the apocalyptic authors are regarded as mainly literary 'fantasies', not as products of genuine 'hallucinatory' experience, but in either case (it is argued) they represent the author's deliberate or unconscious exegesis of scriptural material. In chap ter 4, Halperin introduces us to 'the synagogue tradition' which he believes to have created many of the merkabah midrashim. By now a number of themes have been identified and two opposing tendencies noted. On the one hand, the merkabah-vision is juxta posed to the Sinai-story at Shabu'ot, God's self-revelation comple menting that of the Law. This is associated with a 'hymnic tradition' of exegesis, already found in Apocalyptic and at Qum ran, which describes Ezekiel's hayyot as bearing the divine throne upon their backs whilst offering a perpetual song of praise to God, and which links the prayers of the earthly community to the celestial liturgy. On the other hand, a sinister, bestial, and destructive aspect of the hayyot has surfaced occasionally in pre rabbinic and rabbinic sources, especially in connection with the ox's face and calves' feet of Ezek. 1. A similarly sinister atmos phere attaches to the celestial sea in Apocalyptic. This 'shadow side' of the merkabah tradition occupies the next three chapters. It is persuasively argued that the midrashic tradition that the Golden Calf was magically animated by associa tion with the merkabah-ox, found in late sources, was in the early period suppressed because it implied that the source of evil was so close to God as to be almost a part of His nature. However, Halperin's identification of the illusory waters mentioned in the hekhalothekhalot literature and at BT Hag. 14b as the primordial chaos waters, in which the throne of the Devil is reflected, results from a tortuous and at times extremely tenuous chain of associations, linking apocalyptic imagery with the Red Sea theophany tradition and other material culled from a variety of (mainly medieval) midrashic, gnostic, and Muslim sources, which makes heavy demands on the credulity of the reader. It is convincingly demon strated that veneration of the rainbow as a visible manifestation of the Divine Glory (after Ezek. 1: 28), a practice associated with the third-century 'amora' Joshua b. Levi but condemned as idolatrous by other Palestinian rabbis, has connections with the hekhalot literature, but Halperin's theory that this originated in the Sinai merkabah merkabah juxtaposition of the synagogues is a consequence of his historical reconstruction, which I believe to be mistaken.</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 587 Chapter 8 is a reconstruction of the 'Shabu'ot cycle' of sermons which Halperin believes to have generated the stories of Moses' heavenly ascent, vision of God and victory over the angels. These, he suggests, were the basis of the hekhalot traditions, with their extravagant anthropomorphic imagery and elaborate angelology. The S'mai-merkabah traditions are strongly associated with Joshua b. Levi and striking correspondences with the Jewish sources exist in the writings of Joshua's neighbour and contemporary, Origen. These considerations lead to the conclusion that third-century Caesarea was a major centre of development of these traditions. That something like the exegetical complex reconstructed by Halperin must have been current in the synagogues of Caesarea is established beyond doubt but again the historical interpretation is less convincing. Repeated reference is made to 'the preachers' who were supposedly responsible for generating these traditions, but we are never told who they were. On the one hand, they stand in opposition to 'the rabbis' who (Halperin believes) tried to curb their activities whilst on the other, they are associated with rabbinic figures such as Joshua b. Levi. Close links are implied between 'the preachers' and the authors of the Targums, despite the opposite, anti-anthropomorphic tendency of the latter. Hal perin later suggests that this 'represents the tradition's attempt to police its own impulses' but it seems most unlikely that the Targumists and the people who developed the traditions that they opposed can have been the same. Moreover, if the anti-anthropo morphism of the Targums was, as seems likely, a defence against the proliferation of such traditions, the prior existence of the latter is implied. The evidence of Apocalyptic suggests that heavenly ascent traditions were developed in contexts other than Sinai and associated with heroes other than Moses. Links with the Temple cult are much more evident in the early sources, as they are in the hekhalot hekhalot literature. It therefore seems more reasonable to suppose that a pre-existent tradition was, despite the opposition of some rabbis, incorporated into the 'Shabu'ot cycle' and adapted for that purpose. In his final chapter, Halperin turns to the hekhalot literature itself and argues, contra Scholem, that their primary concern was not the practice of heavenly ascents but mastery of Τorah-study by magical means, namely adjuration of the angelic sar-torah. The observation (first made by Professor Peter Schafer), that descrip tions of ascents make up a smaller proportion of the literature that Scholem's theory, unmodified, would lead us to suspect, is cer tainly correct, as is the argument that the sar-torah material is an integral part of the tradition. However, Halperin's necessary</page><page sequence="4">588 REVIEWS attempt to redress the balance seems overweighted in the opposite direction. The hekhalot authors were, clearly, concerned with the acquisition of heavenly knowledge which included the 'secrets of Torah' and a revealed, magical method of mastering them. Equally important, however, are detailed knowledge of the heav enly realms, their inhabitants, the celestial liturgy, and eschatolo gical revelation. Such knowledge can be obtained by either a magically induced ascent or the adjuration of a heavenly being to descend. Apart from the emphasis on magic, this is basically similar to Apocalyptic. Moreover, Halperin ignores the atoning and mediatorial role of the visionary as priest in the heavenly temple and teacher of the people, which seems equally important in both Apocalyptic and hekhalot literature. On the basis of his analysis, Halperin concludes that 'certain people, nurtured on the stories of how Moses climbed to heaven and seized the Torah from the angels, used these images to express and to satisfy their own yearning to have Torah made accessible to them' and developed magical practices to achieve this end. Thus the hekhalot literature embodies the 'megalomaniac fantasies' of an oppressed under-class. Whether or not such 'fantasies' were powerful enough to generate 'hallucinations' is interesting but not crucially important: in either case, the material is produced by the authors' subconscious minds. What interests Halperin is their motivation. Two explanations, one psychological and one socio-historical, are offered. Application of Freudian theory to the themes of ascension, conflict, bodily transformation and gigantism in the hekhalot hekhalot literature leads to the conclusion that this material is rooted in the 'endlessly repeated' generational conflict between fathers and sons: the hero who triumphs over the heavenly powers embodies the writers' pre-adolescent fantasies. Halperin has here begun to explore a direction which is certainly interesting and may well prove fruitful for our understanding of this and similar types of literature, but the material seems to require a less simplistic interpretation. It is necessary, for example, to account for the fact that the hostile powers that are defeated (the angels) come between the hero and his father-figure (God) who is described as loving and benevolent and as longing for 'His sons' to overcome the gulf that separates them from Him. Halperin's socio-historical explanation is the weakest element in his thesis. Focusing again on the theme of conflict with the angels, he suggests that the hekhalot authors were people who were denied access by their rabbinic oppressors (represented by the angels) to the tradition of Torah-scholarship and the social status that it</page><page sequence="5">REVIEWS 589 conferred, and who therefore tried to gain possession of this restricted knowledge by recourse to magic. All this leads to the bold conclusion that the hekhalot literature was written by the ' am-ha' aretz,' am-ha' aretz, about whom we know little except that they were despised by the rabbis for their lack of learning and refinement and that they seem to have returned this hatred. This theory seems utterly implausible. Whoever they may have been, the hekhalot authors identified themselves unreservedly with the community, values and traditions of rabbinism, and themselves use 'am ha'aretzha'aretz as a derogatory term. Halperin suggests that the 'am ha'aretzha'aretz subscribed to the rabbinic value-system because they knew no other and resented their exclusion from it, but this is pure conjecture. The evidence, such as it is, suggests that they were despised by the rabbis for their disregard of the purity halakhot and lack of interest in religious matters. The hekhalot authors' allegiance to and detailed knowledge of the halakhah has been conclusively demonstrated by Lieberman (Appendix 2 of Gruen wald's Apocalyptic and Merkabah Mysticism, Leiden, 1980) and the suggestion that they were uneducated members of the congre gations to whom 'the preachers' addressed their sermons is entirely without foundation. Following more than 400 pages of detailed analysis of rabbinic traditions by which, according to Halperin, the hekhalot authors were inspired and on which they drew, the suggestion that they were people who had no access to those traditions is, to say the least, surprising. This is a difficult book to evaluate in a short review. It is certainly original. The reader is led along lengthy, often convo luted chains of literary associations, some much more convincing than others. The methodological approach combines—and shifts with bewildering speed between—close textual and literary analy sis, socio-historical reconstruction and psychoanalytical interpre tation. There is a tendency to ambush the unsuspecting reader with startling ideas. None the less, the breadth and depth of Halperin's scholarship is impressive and future research will be unable to ignore this magnum opus. Its greatest strength lies in the thematic analysis of the merkabah midrashim and related material, which is always interesting and in places extremely insightful. Its greatest weaknesses are the questionable historical structure that is imposed on this valuable material and its wildly improbable conclusion. C. R. A. Morray-Jones C. R. A.
