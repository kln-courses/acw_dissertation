Stein An ad appeared in The Wall Street Jour- nal with an idea that can strengthen the family, and with adaptations, the class- room. Tonight at the dinner table, read something out loud to your family. Tomorrow night, let another member read something. A news story. A Bible verse. A Robert Frost poem. A cereal box panel. History. Humor. Anything. Each night a different family member can read a selection. Imagine the wide range of subjects your family will read in 365 days. What a stimulating way to have your children develop good reading habits. We have 23 million illiterate adults in America. We wouldn't have one, if each of them had been served reading as part of their nightly diet. It's non-fattening, but enriching. And it doesn't cost a dime. Perhaps some of the books reviewed below can serve as part of that diet. A plus (+) marks the better-written stories, while a minus (-) precedes the inferior product. Happy summer and happy reading! +Baby Owl by Yasuko Funazaki, ill. by Shuji Tateishi. Methuen, 1980. 32 pp. $7.95. Awake while everyone else in the forest is asleep, Baby Owl almost gives up on finding someone to play with. An alliterative white-printed text giving no Language Arts, Volume 58, Number 5, May 1981 591</page><page sequence="2">hint of its translated origin speaks as softly and subtly as beautifully shaded black/white doublespreads. A delicate night-time book for the youngest, with gleaming words and pictures. The Climb by Carol Carrick, ill. by Donald Carrick. Clarion Books I Houghton Mifflin, 1980. 32 pp. Rein- forced binding, $8.95. Brendan is scared when he and his older cousin begin to climb the moun- tain, but on the way down it's Nora who becomes frightened. Writing and realistic illustrations reflect different kinds of fear. While the story stands on its own in depicting tensions, setting, theme, and characterization through credible dialogue, gold-and-rose pic- tures dramatize a personal and seasonal time. Conversations carry the action. A story to involve the primary grades. The Day Jimmy's Boa Ate the Wash by Trinka Hakes Noble, ill. by Steven Kel- logg. Dial, 1980 . 32 pp. $7.95. Green endpages and Kellogg' s zany full-colored drawings match Noble's bucolic romp of รก class outing to a farm. Even before the title page, the artist hints at what is to come in a cumulative droll story. A laconic style of narration, done entirely in dialogue between a child and the mother to whom she is re- porting, contrasts wildly with the action-packed artwork. The pigs stand out, as they have all year. Eat and Be Eaten by lela Mari. Barron's, 1980. 28 pp. $5.95. Printed in Italy, this wordless picture book, whose theme is the title, features glossy animals spreading over the pages ready to devour others. It is a circular tale, with a hunter playing his part in 592 Language Arts the round-robin drama. Poster art is on shiny white pages, with some of the fanged beasts perhaps too threatening to the too-young onlooker. Liang and the Magic Paintbrush by Demi. Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1980. 32 pp. Reinforced binding, $9.95. We've seen others who have brought to life whatever is pictured through the use of a magic crayon, chalk, or, in this case, a brush. Here, Liang and brush outwit a greedy emperor who covets the implement. The narrative includes little dialogue, little background, and little characterization, much in the way of folktales. Beautifully detailed water- colors, flanked on both sides by a few lines of text, provide the aura of long- ago China in the style of ancient scrolls. + Mice Twice by Joseph Low. A Mar- garet K. McElderry Book. Atheneum, 1980. 32 pp. Reinforced binding, $9.95. A round of uneasy hospitality results when Mouse arrives at Cat's house for dinner in a tale of one-upmanship that could be sub-titled, "May I Bring a Friend?" The cumulative tale of low com- edy receives emphasis from line-on- wash graphics with guests becoming bigger and more ferocious. A very funny fable with more than one theme. Dead-pan elegance in narration and dialogue. Professor Noah's Spaceship by Brian Wildsmith. Oxford, 1980. 32 pp. $9.95. To escape earth's pollution, Professor Noah guides his animals into the future, with unexpected results. The theme seems to be sacrificed for a gimmicky ending. A commonplace story is not en- hanced by the cluttered art - iridescent animals and geometric forms and lines for a fishlike space structure.</page><page sequence="3">Sybil and the Blue Rabbit by Jane Johnson. A Benn Book. Doubleday, 1980. 32 pp. Reinforced binding, $8.95. Home from school one day, Sybil and her toys go on a whirlwind tour of the city, guided by her jaunty blue rab- bit. A nostalgic look at the past offers soft, lavishly colored, precisely drawn interiors and exteriors. A text accom- panies realistic segments, while the imaginative cavorting with toys remains wordless. White-framed ovals, squares, circles, and doublespread illustrations move rhythmically. The Useless Donkeys by Lydia Pender, ill. by Judith Cowell. Warne, 1980. 42 pp. $9.95. A flood and the family baby help the Quigley children convince their parents to keep their troublesome donkeys. Evocative names punctuate spontaneous writing of a realistic short tale set in contemporary New South Wales. The art achieves the effect of collage, as human figures thrust themselves upright against the hills, mountains, and rivers. Note the changes in the old-fashioned photos which open and close the story. Beige, blues, and greens predominate in domestic scenes and in the rain- spattered countryside. Realism For the middle grades The Empty Window by Eve Bunting, ill. by Judy Clifford. Warne, 1980 . 46 pp. Reinforced binding, $7.95. With his younger brother's help, seventh-grader C. G. captures a wild parrot for a dying friend. Although nar- rated by C. G., the terse present-tense adventure places the reader in the shoes of young Sweeney, who shares in the confrontation with death. As in her other stories, Bunting uses birds effec- tively for metaphors. Photographic black/white paintings reflect the imagery and feelings of the tale, best visualized in the geometric empty window. Galloping Gertrude: By Motorcar in 1908 by John L. Loeper. Atheneum, 1980. 66 pp. $6.95. Fashioned in the manner of Loeper's stories on candy stores, colonial schools, and other topics, this book casts the ex- perience of driving near the turn of the century in a fictional mode. Grand- mother, grandfather, and two grand- children encounter almost every possi- ble mishap as they make a thirty-mile car trip. Explosive Grandfather Hill is exactly right for the undertaking. Bits of information extend the family outing. Details and descriptions set time and place, embellished with old prints and advertisements. Older readers can have a similar vicarious thrill with Betty Baker's The Great Desert Race. Ida Early Comes Over the Mountain by Robert Burch. Viking, 1980. 145 pp. $8.95. Burch returns to his familiar milieu of rural Georgia during the depression, as spirited Ida Early arrives to keep house for the four motherless Suttons. She's the object by which the young- sters learn about shame, love, individu- ality, and independence. The author has the dialect down pat, and a lively collec- tion of characters to keep you turning the pages. The trouble is that Ida Early's eccentricities verge on caricature and prevent empathy. +Tough Tiffany by Belinda Hurmence. Doubleday, 1980. 167 pp. $7.95. Book reMarks: A Personal View of Current Juvenile Literature 593</page><page sequence="4">Growing up in a small North Carolina city, eleven-year-old Tiffany, youngest in a poor family, finds herself through helping others. The story tem- pers heartaches with resilience and humor. Reminiscences reveal the hearts and minds of people who live and have lived in a Southern town. A joyful first novel about overcoming individual fears. Recommended unreservedly. What Difference Does It Make, Danny by Helen Young, ill. by Quentin Blake. Deutsch, 1980. 96 pp. $7.95. The only time Danny's epilepsy makes any difference to the normal nine-year-old is when an insensitive teacher keeps him from swimming. The boy's reaction comprises the plot, one subordinate to the message of treating epileptic children rationally. British speech won't interfere with comprehen- sion. Blake's line drawings catch the humor and gravity of the situations. For older readers Beyond Silence by Eleanor Cameron. Dutton, 1980. 208 pp. $9.95. Fifteen-year-old Andrew accom- panies his father to the family castle in Scotland, where the teenager encounters his forebears as future and past meet in the present. Cameron's writing recreates misty Scottish landscapes, but her characters never seem fully realized, limited perhaps by the first-person nar- ration. Andy's hypnagogic experiences seem tenuously connected to his psychological problems following his brother's death. Shifting time bound- aries have been handled better in other novels. A mystical experience framed within the borders of reality. I was only partially moved. 594 Language Arts -I- Break in the Sun by Bernard Ashley, ill. by Charles Keeping. Phillips, 1980. 185 pp. $8.95. Bed-wetter Patsy Bligh runs away to join a touring summer theater group. Her friend and step-father emerge for us and for each other through absorbing internal speech and exchanges of confi- dence, as they trail the desperate girl. Ashley prepares us for the climax in a rain-drenched amusement park, where wishful thinking bumps up against real- ity. Shifting scenes and viewpoints mesh well and heighten the suspense. A top-notch story by a writer with a deft pen and sensitive ear. +The Power of Light: Eight Stories for Hanukkah by Isaac Bashevis Singer, ill. by Irene Lieblich. Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, 1980. 87 pp. $10.95. In each story - one for each night of the holiday - the prize-winning author portrays a world in which love triumphs and faith prevails. He imbues his realis- tic tales with a kind of fantasy in which he believes, whether they are set in the Warsaw Ghetto, in Brooklyn, or in Sing- er's own Polish childhood home. His power is such that he carries the reader along, however far removed from the European orphanage or study house we may be. Full-color pictures have a Chagall-like quality, with blue provid- ing the hope and comfort with which the book is infused. Every bit as pas- sionate and well written as Singer's adult novels. +John Brown: A Cry for Freedom by Lorenz Graham. Crowell, 1980. 180 pp. $9.95. A compelling biography takes John Brown from a religious childhood through marriage and parenthood to</page><page sequence="5">Kansas, where the controversial abolitionist is set on the road that ends at Harpers Ferry. Graham allows Brown's actions and words to speak for themselves. A plethora of evidence suc- ceeds in dispelling the myth of madman and fanatic as popularly pictured. Brown's prophecy regarding slavery - "'The end of that is not yet'" - pertains as much to our time as it did to his. The book sheds light on problems which whites and blacks face more than a cen- tury after Brown's execution. Contem- porary photos and drawings lend drama to a life that reads like fiction. The Journey of the Shadow Bairns by Margaret J. Anderson. Knopf, 1980. 177 pp. $7.95. Death of her parents forces a young Scottish girl to attempt relocation in Canada with her four-year-old brother. The bleakness of Glasgow and the Canadian plains parallel Elspeth's life, as she and Robbie hide from the adults who threaten to separate them. A sen- timental ending and a contrived plot weaken the fast-paced story of a turn- of-the-century migration to the shores of our northern neighbor. Fantasy For the middle grades Crazy in Love by Richard Kennedy, ill. by Marcia Sewall. A Unicorn Book, Dut- ton, 1980. 58 pp. Reinforced binding, $7.95. Only recently married, a young man and woman each begin to fear, with fairly good cause, that the other is crazy. The theme, that wishing and loving cause heightened perceptions, underlies a plot of enchantments, instilling ordi- nary people with magic. Charcoal and chalk drawings extend the reality of a folkish tale with O. Henry overtones. The Double Disappearance of Walter Fozbek by Steve Senn. Hastings, 1980. 120 pp. $8.95. Walter wakes one summer morning and discovers he has somehow been catapulted into a world exactly parallel to his own in every detail, except that the inhabitants are dinosaurs. The "double" refers to Walter's saurian twin duplicating his feat, but into the ordi- nary world. Despite the appearance of an animate black hole and a computer, and contrary to the jacket's blurb, the story is pure fantasy of the "what if ..." variety, with none of the true at- tributes of science fiction. The dinosaurs are anthropomorphic, no more bestial than Donald Duck. What the British would call a fast "read." Fables by Arnold Lobel. Harper &amp; Row, 1980. 42 pp. $8.95. Apparently I am a minority of one in that I was so disappointed in this highly touted volume. The twenty fables about an array of animal characters are more short stories than succinct observations on human foibles. The italicized morals seem less pointed lessons than fortune cookie comments or daily astrological forecasts. There was little originality or amusement. Frankly, I'll stick with Toad and Frog. Appropriate for older readers, this appeals to the younger ones be- cause of size and format - a one-page tale facing a full-sized colored picture. The Tale of the Shining Princess, adapted by Sally Fisher from a transla- tion by Donald Keene. The Metropolitan Museum of Art and A Studio Book. Vik- ing, 1980. 72 pp. $10.95. Book reMarks: A Personal View of Current Juvenile Literature 595</page><page sequence="6">The ancient story of the beautiful daughter of a poor bamboo cutter and his wife who turns out to be a moon princess is a familiar one in Japan. The heart of the nine chapters deals with the girl's attempts to dissuade her ardent suitors, one of whom is the Emperor himself. Elegantly narrated, the account contains familiar motifs and literary de- vices to enchant the reader. The adapta- tion jarred in one instance, with the ex- pression "snuck away." The book is to be looked at, as well as read, with its gorgeous illustrations reproduced from a late eighteenth-century edition, re- splendent with gold and silver and beautifully arrayed figures. Notes add interest and increase understanding, but are not necessary to the tale's pleasure. For the upper grades +The Half-a-Moon Inn by Paul Fleis- chman, ill. by Kathy Jacobi. Harper &amp; Row, 1980. 88 pp. $7.95. Seeking shelter in an inn, a mute boy is held captive by his proprietress, a wicked thief who probes the dreams of her drugged guests. Original imagery enriches a taut tale of enchantment, packed with crackling dialogue, well de- fined incidents, and sharply etched characters. A lack of suspense and a touch of coincidence do not lessen the feeling of satisfaction. Note the plug for literacy couched in the story. Half-A- Moon Inn joins the Gingerbread House and the Fearsome Inn as welcome stopovers for literary wayfarers. Java Jack by Luqman Keele and Daniel Pinkwater. Crowell, 1980. 152 pp. $7.95. In search of his missing parents in the Indonesian Islands, Jack travels to real and imaginary places in adventures which propel him into the roles of pilot, 596 Language Arts rock singer, pirate, and sultan's son. Not accidentally this thirty-chapter ex- travaganza resembles a swashbuckling movie of the thirties, with its lost trea- sure, mistaken identities, earthquakes, and volcanoes. The speech patterns of unidimensional characters and the in- credible plot are all part of one big put- on. Curiosity as to what could possibly follow each breathless bit of action will keep you turning the pages. I bought the whole package. Will others? The Shadow Guests by Joan Aiken. De- lacorte, 1980. 150 pp. $7.95. Unsettled by the death of his brother and mother in Australia, Cosmo Curtoys is unprepared for the supernatural furor unleashed by his arrival at a cousin's home in England. Aroused by a curse, these shadows are neither the hidden humans of Anderson's Shadow Bairns nor founded on the psychological needs of Cameron's ghosts. A glaring weakness is the lack of synthesis between Cosmo's school life and his lonely weekends at the ancient British mill house. Aiken shines at character portrayal. The ghosts, how- ever, never live up to their advance bill- ing, and Cosmo never acts as menaced as he claims to be. Unicorns in the Rain by Barbara Cohen. An Argo Book. Atheneum, 1980. 164 pp. $8.95. Feeling unwanted during a rainy holiday season, Nikki accepts an invita- tion from a stranger on a train and finds herself with a fanatic family about to board an ark. It's Noah all over again, but set in the demoralized times of the not-too-distant future. Narrated by the heroine, the novel seems a hopeless comment on the quality of our existence and our power to change it, with the</page><page sequence="7">Tough Tiffany - photo courtesy of Doubleday John Brown: A Cry for Freedom - photo courtesy of Crowell The Double Disappearance of Walter Fozbek- photo courtesy of Hastings The Half-A-Moon Inn - photo courtesy of Harper and Row unicorns as symbols of the general state of affairs and Nikki's dilemma and lack of belief. A Walk in Wolf Wood: A Tale of Fan- tasy and Magic by Mary Stewart, ill. by Emanuel Schongut. Morrow, 1980. 160 pp. $8.95. When a weeping man in a strange cos- tume passes their picnic spot in the Black Forest and disappears into the nearby woods, a brother and sister follow him and find themselves involved in the res- cue of a bewitched werewolf in the four- teenth century. Needless and uncharac- teristic asides and explanations weaken a well constructed tale of violence, sorcery, and treachery in which a modern Hansel and Gretei play their parts. Comparisons of Two Folktales The Bremen-Town Musicians, retold and ill. by Ilse Plume. Doubleday, 1980. 32 pp. $8.95. The Bremen Town Musicians, by the Brothers Grimm, trans, by Elizabeth Shub, ill. by Janina Domanska. Greenwillow, 1980 . 32 pp. $7.95. Choose from a translation that retains the stylistic elements of a German folktale as rendered by an expert and a retelling now cast in a more contempor- ary literary format. While the latter con- Book reMarks: A Personal View of Current Juvenile Literature 597</page><page sequence="8">eludes with . . and no doubt they are still there today, making wonderful music under the stars/' the first reads, ". . . And this tale's still warm from the telling, for I've just heard it." That indi- cates the literary differences. Green- willow's version uses larger size print. Both have a page of text opposite a full-page colored illustration. Touches of yellow brighten Plume's realistic prints. A frame unifies the text and the raucous illustrations of Domanska's more ex- pressionistic paintings. I'd opt for Shub and Domanska's rendition of the ani- mals' night adventures. -East of the Sun and West of the Moon by Mercer Mayer, Four Winds, 1980. 37 pp. Reinforced binding, $10.95. East of the Sun and West of the Moon, retold by Kathleen and Michael Hague, ill. by Michael Hague. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1980. 33 pp. Reinforced binding, $9.95. There are nine illustrations in the Hagues' book and eighteen pages of pic- tures in Mayer's. Even though there is more description in the Hagues' retell- ing, at least it is still based on the classic Scandinavian fairy tale. Mayer's should have had a different title, as he grafts the story of the Frog Prince onto the other tale, adding a needless cumber- some moral. Mayer's rich watercolors carry the mystery and the feel of the north lands, lacking in Hague's version. Are you buying the story or the art work? Too bad we can't have both in the same volume, but if it is East of the Sun and West of the Moon that you want, polar bear and all, you'll select the Hagues' work over Mayer's. Children's Literature Association Awards Lynn Rosenthal of Mercy College, New York, was named the recipient of the Chil- dren's Literature Association's annual award for the year's most distinguished arti- cle of literary criticism in children's literature. Professor Rosenthal's article, "The Development of Consciousness in Lucy Boston's The Children of Green Knowe," ap- peared in Children's Literature, Volume 8. Runner-up awards were given to Madelon S. Gohlke of the University of Minnesota, whose article "Re-reading The Secret Garden" was published in College English (April 1980) and to Jane Murray Walker of the University of Delaware. Her article, "Rites of Passage Today: The Cultural Significance of The Wizard of Ear - thsea," appeared in Mosaic . A special honorable mention was awarded Francelia Butler of the University of Connecticut, whose article "Children's Literature: The Bad Seed" was published in The Virginia Quarterly Review (Summer 1980). The winner of the award, presented annually by the Children's Literature As- sociation, an international organization of professors, teachers, librarians, pub- lishers, and authors, receives a commemorative certificate and $100.00.
