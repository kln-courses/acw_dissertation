<plain_text><page sequence="1">METAPHILOSOPHY Vol. 3, No. 2, April 1972 SYSTEMS PHILOSOPHY: A SYMPOSIUM THE CASE FOR SYSTEMS PHILOSOPHY Ervin Laszlo In this paper I shall argue for a new kind of philosophy—or, more exactly, a new form of a perennial kind of philosophy— which I call systems philosophy. I shall proceed by voicing some dissatisfactions with the currently dominating analytic trends in Western philosophy ("Complaints") and then go on to offer some constructive suggestions as to the nature and principles of systems philosophy ("Suggestions"). I shall end by some reflections on the tasks of philosophy in general, and the con ditions under which they can be pursued ("Conclusions"). I. Complaints, or the Need for Systems Philosophy {a) The intrinsic poverty of uninformed analysis Much of the malaise on the contemporary scene comes from the rift between the sciences and the humanities. Whatever the many factors may be which enter into the determination of this rift, the majority of English and American contemporary philosophers contribute to it, even if only inadvertently. They examine the perennial questions of philosophy as though no empirical sciences existed—or at least as if their inquiry were prior to the theories of such sciences. Questions concerning knowledge, freedom, mind, obligation, value, etc., are pursued by these philosophers on the assumption that whatever evidence is available to a consistent and critical thinker in his daily life, is sufficient to decide the issues, or at least to discuss them cogently. There is an almost exclusive reliance on information any observant man can possess and on the language in which this information is stated. Both of these (i.e., common-sense knowledge and ordinary language) have come to be rejected in the sciences as insuf ficient, and reliance on them as obsolete. Common-sense know ledge, however critically examined and logically expounded, is regarded as but the layer of prejudice which, Einstein said, impedes scientific progress. And ordinary language is found entirely inadequate to symbolize the meaning of the concepts which constitute the scientific knowledge of our time. Thus it comes about that scientists view philosophers with incompre hension mixed with awe and resulting in bewilderment; philo 123</page><page sequence="2">124 ERVIN LASZLO sophers appear to be doing, much of the time, what scientists have rejected as naive and transcended, yet philosophers are the inheritors of the awesome wisdom of the ages and stand, presumably, on the shoulders of their gigantic predecessors. Philosophers in turn tend to consider scientific theories as based on assumptions which must first be examined, or to dismiss them as grasping but a limited sphere of reality, and giving partial or inadequate answers to the questions to which they alone seem to have access. (Unfortunately, the access to these undoubtedly essential questions turns out to be via a logical scrutiny of everyday information and language.) As a result, contact between scientists and philosophers tends to be brief and mutually irritating. I confess that I do not see a scintilla of evidence in anything produced by philosophers' analyzing common-sense knowledge and ordinary language which would justify their efforts to come up with theories that could be read as serious recommendations to believe what the objects of knowledge, the nature of mind, beauty, religious significance, or moral values, may be. To try to piece together a concept of the world, of man and of mind, and of the adventures of mindful man in the world, on the basis of information obtained by observing what oneself and others are doing, is like trying to reconstruct the principles of automotive engineering from the observation of what one does when he drives a car. Such an attempt is foredoomed to failure, especially when we consider that an automobile is simplicity itself compared to the workings of nature, the human body, and the mind. The contribution of philosophical analysis—whether lingu istic, conceptual or phenomenological—to our knowledge of the nature of man and the world becomes real only when it is placed within the context of our scientific (i.e. imaginatively postulated and rigorously tested) knowledge of natural events. Ignoring such knowledge, linguistic and conceptual analysis becomes the analysis of insignificant concepts and propositions, and phenomenology the solipsistic burrowing in "wordly" and "nonwordly" phenomena and intentional-constitutive processes.1 Within the context of a general knowledge of the fundamental principles of our sciences of man and nature, however, rigorous piecemeal analyses have as their valid and valuable task to lay bare the fine structure of cognitive and behavioral processes, and thereby to fill in the present scientific framework. iSee the present writer's Beyond Scepticism and Realism: A Constructive Explora tion of Husserlian and Whiteheadian Methods of Inquiry. The Hague, 1966.</page><page sequence="3">THE CASE FOR SYSTEMS PHILOSOPHY 125 (b) Extrinsic grounds for informed synthesis Whether philosophers like it or not, and whether or not they choose to ignore it, philosophy is part and parcel of the culture of an age and as such has responsibilities and tasks which transcend its specialty boundaries. It behooves a philosopher to take into account, and respond to, demands made on his field by investigators in other fields, in view of the state of knowledge and state of practical affairs at a given time. Hence I wish to consider extrinsic grounds for informed synthesis, in addition to the negative intrinsic grounds constituted by the poverty of uninformed analysis. And here a note of even more urgency should be sounded. Analysis in philosophy corresponds to ultra-specialization in other fields of knowledge. But whereas ultra-specialization in science can at least claim indisputable advances in our piece meal understanding of certain delimited processes, adding to the sum total of contemporary empirical information, there are no indisputable advances in an ultra-specialized philosophical inquiry. Yet by behaving as though this were the case, many philosophers disdain general theory to an extent equal to the most limited kind of scientific specialist. By that token, they refuse responsibility for conceptual integration—which how ever has always been a key function of philosophy, and con tinues to be demanded of philosophers today. Scientists are beginning to realize the limitations, and even the dangers, inherent in specialization. Empirical phenomena do not come in conveniently parcelled out patches, suitable for cultivation by friendly neighborhood gardeners, each cultivating his own bit of terrain. The empirical world discloses itself more like an intricate system of coordinated events, in which the knowledge of one event presupposes familiarity with the rest. Even if this presupposition diminishes in importance beyond certain limits as far as the acquisition of knowledge is con cerned, it remains important in regard to the utilization of knowledge. Purposive intervention in one field has definite, and often unforeseen, results in another, as our ecology-conscious culture is beginning to realize. Nature does not come in isolated patches. Man himself is part of the system of nature, and unless informed "generalists" make it their business to develop systematic theories of the patterns of interconnection, our short-range projects and limited control-abilities may lead us to our own destruction. As Wiener has warned us when he compared contemporary technology to the magic of the mon</page><page sequence="4">126 ERVIN LASZLO key's paw, which fulfills all desires but brings misery to its owner who does not know what to wish for, we may appease an immediate want or need by asking things of our world which it can fulfill now; but we may, in the long run, frustrate other needs and upset the very conditions of our existence. We may be on the brink of "outprogramming" ourselves. And to whom should we appeal for relief of our predicament? Scientists, con scious that philosophers as a whole ignore the entire problem, or at best analyze its conceptual and linguistic presuppositions, are beginning to accept responsibility for finding solutions. But are these not problems which call for humanists and informed "lovers of wisdom" to consider? The great thinkers of the history of philosophy, from Socrates to Whitehead, would not have hesitated to answer yes. Synthesis in the fields of knowledge has yet another crucial task to fulfill. It has to help us to overcome what has been described as the "existential vacuum".2 An increasing number of people are forced into psychiatric care due to a failure to find meaning in life. They complain of an inner emptiness, a sense of total and ultimate meaninglessness. People are not guided by their instincts, as animals, and cannot find satisfaction in carrying out genetically programmed patterns of behavior. In earlier epochs they were guided by synthetic modes of thought which rested in part on faith and imagination; but the great myths of former ages and the religions of our immediate heritage have lost their cogency to millions. According to the "ideologues", they are capable of being replaced by action oriented ideologies, such as Nazism and Communism, which present a total world-view with explicit directives for action. But Nazism was a perversion on the level of social morality and had to be suppressed, and Communism loses much of its power to give meaning to existence when the permanent revolution asked for by its leaders has subsided. Thus the "existential vacuum" envelopes all but the actively rebelling and militant nations of the world: the Maoists do not complain of a sense of emptiness, nor do the Israelis, who likewise must fight and have a thoroughly understood reason to live. But the so-called "advanced" societies of the world, those namely where the struggle for existence and for social reform has yielded to tech nologically effected relatively stable well-being, fail to offer their members meaningful reasons for their existence. As a 2Viktor E. Frankl, 'Reductionism and Nihilism', Beyond Reductionism; New Perspectives in the Life Sciences, Arthur Koestler and J. R. Smythies, eds., London and New York, 1969.</page><page sequence="5">THE CASE FOR SYSTEMS PHILOSOPHY 127 result strains and stresses are produced which manifest them selves in such phenomena as violence, anarchism, political witch-hunts—directed against mostly imaginary scapegoats ("capitalists" or "communists" or merely "administrators")— and generate intense interest in traditional religion (typically in communist countries) and in Oriental religions and mysticism (in the West). One American observer recently spoke of a "spiritual explosion" and a "search for the transcendental answers to fundamental questions of human life" and held that these have now intensified beyond measure. "Bookstores are crammed with Eastern sacred texts, studies of astrology, re incarnation, states of consciousness, and the like. Students across the country are demanding courses in Buddhism, Hindu ism, and mysticism. . . . Psychiatrists, psychologists, and clergy men of all faiths are joining the younger generation in this pursuit. . . ."3 The demand for "seeing things whole" and seeing the world as an interconnected, interdependent field or continuum, is in itself a healthy reaction to the loss of meaning entailed by overcompartmentalized research and piecemeal analysis, bring ing in particularized "facts" but failing in relevance to anything of human concern. In the 19th century, the existential vacuum was provoked by the then fashionable attitude of nihilism. Today, a Frankl points out, nihilism is out of fashion, but it reappears under the guise of reductionism: the typical mark of specialization. "... I would say that reductionism today is a mask for nihilism. Contemporary nihilism no longer brandishes the word nothingness; today nihilism is camouflaged as nothing but-ness.'H Frankl is mainly concerned with the reduction of human phenomena to unconscious drives and aggressions and these in turn to physiological mechanisms. Yet reductionism is the more widespread phenomenon of tracing observed or inferred processes to their smallest parts and explaining them by the interaction of these. Such practice, while contributing much noteworthy detailed knowledge of isolated events, leaves out of consideration larger interconnections which may be decisive for the understanding of the phenomena. It brings about specialization with all its attendant features: special languages, methods, constructs, foci of attention, and so on. In short, reductionism generates a multiplicity of limited-range paradigms, each of which applies to a small domain of highly 3Jacob Needleman, The New Religions, New York, 1970. iFrankl, op. cit., p. 398.</page><page sequence="6">128 ERVIN LASZLO specific events but says nothing about the rest. (And if the specialist does use his particular paradigm to explain events outside its scope, he becomes a "terrible generalisateur", which, replacing the legendary "terrible simplificateur" is the mark of the generalizing specialist.5) In consequence the accumulation of highly specific bits of knowledge fails to give meaning to wider chunks of experience and does nothing to fill the present existential vacuum. Specialized science is simply irrelevant to the question of meaning in life. But the latter cannot be dis missed with a wave of the hand, as specialists tend to do; there are good indications that there is such a thing as a "will to meaning" in man as one of his most basic motivational forces, and that some 20 per cent of contemporary neuroses are due to its frustration. I conclude that there is a need today for bringing fresh and reliable empirical information into philosophy; for overcoming the patchwork approach in the use of knowledge as a means of safeguarding ourselves against disaster due to ignorance of systemic interconnections in nature; and for gaining insight into the basic patterns of existence in this world as a means of providing meaning for the brute fact of being here. All this requires the resuscitation of a mode of rational and systematic thinking which has fallen into disrepute through overinsistence on detailed investigation and specialization. Without disparaging the contribution to dependable science of carefully delimited specialized inquiry, let it be said, with Maslow, that of the two modes of thinking, the "atomistic" and the "holistic", it is the holistic which is the sign of the healthy, self-actualizing person. Insistence on the atomistic mode in itself is a form of mild psychoneurosis.6 Among contemporary scientists and philosophers it is often a defense reaction—it is the most justifiable way of waving away questions for which their theories provide no answers. But there must be informed minds among us who have taken upon themselves the no doubt thankless job of attempting to see through the web of unclearly related special theories, producing a fusion where today we only have confusion. II. Suggestions: Outline of the Systems Philosophy Paradigm (a) The concept of systems philosophy I have complained enough to raise, at the least, some doubt sibid., p. 397. ^Abraham H. Maslow, Motivation and Personality, Preface to the 1970 edition.</page><page sequence="7">THE CASE FOR SYSTEMS PHILOSOPHY 129 as to the adequacy and sufficiency of analysis as the dominant mode of philosophizing in this day and age. Let me turn, then, to the constructive side and offer some suggestions concerning what philosophy could be like, if philosophers so willed it. In the past, conceptual integration usually proceeded by draw ing on personal insight and inspiration. Great metaphysical schemes explored all kinds of possible worlds, but offered no assurance of being applicable to the one actually confronting us. Today, however, perhaps for the first time in the history of thought, there are some general points of reference emerging within the empirical sciences which constitute relatively reliable anchor points for the construction of general theories. I am referring to the so-called systems sciences and concepts. These emerge as the basis for a potentially universal metalanguage of empirical theory; key systems concepts reveal their applicability in areas as diverse as nuclear physics and international rela tions. Science, on the whole, has given up modes of thought in terms of things and substances; it now concentrates on sets of relationships which endure in space and time. These structured sets of events are explicitly conceptualized as systems, and con temporary sciences offer descriptions of their various states and functions. There are systems of physics, of chemistry, of biology, ecology and sociology; systems which can be compared independently of their origin, substance, or nature of their parts (subsystems). This constitutes general system theory, as pro posed by von Bertalanffy.7 It can constitute, I suggest, a general systems philosophy, when used by philosophers to solve philo sophical problems. These latter include problems of reality, of knowledge, of value, of dignity, freedom, consciousness, and many others, all of which exceed the scope of the systems sciences.8 Systems concepts may be taken as the general metalanguage of integrative philosophical discourse. Miller emphasized that general systems terms make it easier to recognize similarities between phenomena at different levels of organization and of different types. The specialist languages, on the other hand, "mask important intertype and interlevel generalities and make general theory as difficult as it is to think about snow in a language that has no word for it".9 ?See Ludwig von Bertalanffy, General System Theory, New York: George Braziller, 1968. 8See Ervin Laszlo, Introduction to Systems Philosophy, with Foreword by Ludwig von Bertalanffy, New York: Gordon and Breach, 1971. 9James G. Miller: "Living Systems; Basic Concepts", General Systems Theory and Psychiatry, ed. Gray and Rizzo, Boston, 1968.</page><page sequence="8">130 ERVIN LASZLO The philosophy capable of integrating the basic patterns of contemporary forms of knowledge evolved in slow progression from the philosophy of real universals of Plato and the cate goreal scheme of Aristotle, through scholastic metaphysics in the Middle Ages, to the modern process-philosophies of Berg son, Lloyd Morgan, Samuel Alexander and Whitehead. Systems philosophy is the indicated contemporary form of this type of philosophy. It differs from its predecessors in taking as its basic entity the system—a dynamic, structured set of events in space and time. It is this concept which makes a systems philosophy more fruitful today than any other general scheme of thought. To think in terms of new entities is now being recognized as contributing at least as much to scientific progress as finding new formulas for calculating and predicting events. As one biologist and system theorist, Ralph Gerard, puts it, "Entitation is more important than quantitation". Synthetic philosophy likewise depends on the entitation-capacity of its investigators. Whitehead's concept of "organism" now reappears in the guise of systems, and finds ready-made exemplifications in the work of almost all contemporary empirical sciences. To use it as the cornerstone of contemporary synthetic philosophy is to use the obviously best suited conceptual tool—the entity of greatest range of invariance and widest range of empirical application. (b) Some formulations of basic principles in systems philosophy (i) Systems and ordinary experience Concept such as system, steady-state, invariance, self-organiza tion, feedback (etc.) are newcomers on the theoretical scene. Theory advances from the experientially concrete to the increas ingly abstract, and systems concepts belong among the most abstract theoretical constructs so far evolved. They are not derived from an analysis of the "givens" of experience, but are the fruits of the same kind of imaginative theoretical postula tion as that which gave us the concept of protons, four-dimen sional continua and genetic coding, among many others. Human sense organs and forms of thought evolved for a rigorously functional purpose: to enable man to survive by conveying signals from the relevant segments of his environ ment, and endowing these signals with operationally significant meaning. Consequently human experience, as conveyed by the senses and coded in practical language and commonsensical modes of thought, is by no means a reliable instrument of</page><page sequence="9">THE CASE FOR SYSTEMS PHILOSOPHY 131 objective empirical knowledge. In fact, biological and cultural factors combine to form a kind of existential "bubble" for each person, which permits him to get along remarkably well, but can be misleading when used as a guide to objective knowledge. The "bubble" includes concepts of things and of relationships, generally restricting concreteness and reality to the former. By limiting the class of things to entities of the human, as well as of the subhuman level, it enables the human being to effec tively manipulate them. "Living things" and "inanimate things" can become objects to be used for human purposes. Above the level of the individual human being, the (social and ecological) phenomena appear to common-sense as relationships constituted by concrete individual persons. Thus multi-organic phenomena, such as groups, organizations, societies, multinational federa tions, as well as the ecological structures into which they are tied through their economy, appear as so many constituted relationships, without reality of their own. Hence such relation ships are likewise available for manipulation for human ends. (Although some social structures are often referred to as "group persons"—e.g. teams, corporations, governments, etc.—this is a matter of linguistic expediency in the common-sense optic. Common-sense refuses to attribute reality to such structures in the same concrete sense in which it takes individual human beings to be real.) In general, the existential bubble of common-sense dis tinguishes things and relationships in proportion to their close ness to the individual human being. Things immediately below his level are clearly distinguished (these are of the order of magnitude which come into the directly perceivable range), and also relationships which involve individuals stand out in sharp focus. Reality appears to fade in the direction of the smaller entities, with cells, molecules, atoms and subatomic particles bordering on the fictional. The apprehension of more encompassing social structures likewise fades, as relationships beyond the direct participation of the individual take on a purely theoretical character. (There is, however, a remarkable extension of the common-sense world-view in both directions, due in part to the impact of natural science, and in part to the increased level of communication and interaction in our shrink ing "global village".) The great divide, or "common-sense Rubicon", between concrete "things" and constituted "relationships" remains, how ever, the person. From the level of persons down "things" are</page><page sequence="10">132 ERVIN LASZLO manipulated; and from here on up, "relationships" are ordered. Hence the commonsense existential bubble of the human being is highly efficient; it permits control-behavior to extend in both directions from him. But that this bubble is also true, in the sense of representing an objective mapping of the environing world, must be questioned. Regretfully, functional efficacy and objective truth-value are often confused. Merely because something is a functional coding of an objective state, does not mean that it is also an exact reproduction of that state. A series of programs, operated by feeding in punched tapes, can control the manufacture of complex products, such as automobiles, but this is not equiva lent to having a true representation of the finished vehicle in the programs. In the program, certain sets of relationships are functionally matched, and these represent true mappings, but examining the codes or programs is to examine something very different from the product the manufacture of which it controls. There is no "little car" inside the production-line control system at the plant. But it is precisely such an image that we expect of human beings, when they claim to know their environing world. And it is precisely a series of images of things, and of relationships constituted by things, that the existential world picture comprises. But these images are more like functional codes for producing efficient responses than objectively true mappings of existent entities. When they are taken for the latter, the bubble is expanded into an anthropomorphic and necessarily subjective world-picture. The options for achieving empirical knowledge are clear-cut. One either chooses to argue out of one's functional but sub jective bubble and take the functional code for an objective image; or he can attempt to bypass such subjectivities and search for non-anthropomorphic conceptual categories. The former alternative represents the empirical approach of most philosophers who take human experience as the touchstone of their knowledge of the world. Whether they argue on the basis of sense-data, language, or aesthetic and perhaps religious intuition, they explicate intrinsically subjective structures into seemingly objective world conceptions. But the latter alterna tive is embraced by the contemporary sciences when they con centrate not on experienced things and their relationships, but on structures and functions—in one word, on organization. By taking the way certain events are structured, in space and in time, as the criterion of its reality ("concreteness"), the anthro</page><page sequence="11">THE CASE FOR SYSTEMS PHILOSOPHY 133 pomorphic profile of the commonsensical bubble is exploded. Man is removed from the topmost position he occupies in the behaviorally efficient bubble-model of the world: "persons" no longer define the common-sense Rubicon. Man becomes but a system embedded in the systematic interconnectedness of terrestrial nature. There is no longer a categorical gap between "things" (including "animate things") below the level of persons, and of constituted "relationships" above. There are systems, subsystems and suprasystems, and which is which depends on the level of the conceptual analysis. By achieving alternate foci of investigation, man can be considered now a suprasystem (e.g. of his organs, tissues and cells), now a subsystem (of his group, society, and nation). Likewise any given system can achieve these alternate classifications, by relating it to its parts, or to superordinate wholes. (ii) Systems in natural hierarchies Natural systems10 appear to evolve on two different planes and by means of two different types of processes. On one level we find the entities of astronomy: galaxy clusters, galaxies, star clusters, stars, planets and their subsidiary bodies. On another level there are the entities of physics, chemistry, biology, ecology, sociology and even international relations: atoms, molecules, molecular compounds, crystals, cells, multicellular organisms, and communities of organisms. Cosmology has juris diction over the former; almost all of the remaining natural and social sciences investigate the latter. Little is explicitly known of the laws of the vertical build-up of level-structures in either area, other than that gravitational forces play the principal role in the astronomical sector of evolution, and electrical and subsidiary forces are instrumental in evolution on the micro physical-to-organic level, with cognitive factors playing a role thereafter, when symbolized communications supervene over energetic interactions. Now, cosmology is in a truly rudimen tary state at this time, with scientists such as Harrison admit ting that, although it is "the science of the universe as an organized whole . ..", "nobody in their right mind for a moment dreams that we are anywhere near achieving even an elementary notion of the universe as an organized whole".11 Cosmology, he lOThe term 'natural system' is used here to denote concrete systems which arise in nature, independently of human agency in the form of conscious, purposive plan ning and execution. It is contrasted with 'artificial system'—a term denoting likewise concrete systems, which, however, are the result of conscious planning and execution. HE. R. Harrison, 'The Mystery of Structure in the Universe', in Hierarchical Structures, L. L. Whyte, Wilson and Wilson, eds. New York: Elsevier, 1969.</page><page sequence="12">134 ERVIN LASZLO points out, has not yet succeeded in explaining in general terms why the universe is fragmented into planets, stars and galaxies— it is known neither how galaxies evolved nor what initial conditions determined their present properties and structural differences.12 This situation contrasts with that which prevails in the microphysics-to-sociology spectrum of the build-up of level-structures. Here, the problem is to find a general postulate which could coordinate the enormous storehouses of relevant data, rather than to uncover the basic data themselves. The contrast between the rudimentary state of scientific cosmology and of a scientific account of micro-evolution is comprehen sible—cosmology must be based on a reconstruction of past events on the basis of their redistribution in present processes, whereas all (or almost all) phases of micro-evolution are still available to investigation in one form or another. But this difficulty in cosmology precludes the treatment of astronomic developmental processes in systems philosophy; this discipline cannot undertake to advance scientific laws and theories, only to map those already available into general meta-models. And the existing theories and laws of cosmology are too uncertain as yet, to allow the construction of systems philosophical general models carrying any degree of empirical meaning and accuracy. Hence systems philosophy as here conceived is limited to the phenomena of organized complexity which is initiated with the formation of atoms, and which, at least on earth, progresses thereafter in hierarchical fashion, through molecular, cellular, organic and multiorganic (sociological and ecological) forms. For the sake of simplicity and clarity I shall refer to the terrestrial atoms-to-ecologies hierarchy as the microhierarchy, and call the astronomical structurations in the cosmos the macrohierarchy. Thus systems philosophy can be said to con cern itself with the microhierarchy, and consider the macro hierarchy primarily as the cosmic background and generative matrix of its terrestrial form. The restriction of systems philo sophy's scope is thus dictated by pragmatic considerations concerning the availability of adequate scientific information, and is reinforced by the fact that the terrestrial microhierarchy is, after all, that segment of nature which constitutes our world, as well as ourselves as its integral components. (Figure 1) (iii) Characteristics of the terrestrial microhierarchy The hierarchy concept in regard to terrestrial nature is I21bid.</page><page sequence="13">THE CASE FOR SYSTEMS PHILOSOPHY 135 becoming widely accepted and discussed today. Several impor tant classifications emerged in recent years, attempting to identify the principal levels of the hierarchy with empirically known entities. Although tentative and provisional, these are important endeavors to bring order into our comprehension of our segment of nature. I shall cite two studies in this regard as particularly significant. Miller gives the following scheme: Metagalaxy (•astronomical universe) Galaxy aggregations Galaxies Stellar clusters Stars, planets -H5(--h6) -H6 -H7 -H0 0"H Atoms of the Electrons, photons, radiation quanta Fundamental energy condensations (quarks 7) Spoce -time manifold Fig. i "Atoms are composed of particles; molecules, of atoms, crystals and organelles, of molecules. . . . Cells are composed of atoms, molecules and multimolecular organelles; organs are composed of cells aggregated into tissues; organisms, of organs; groups (e.g., herds, flocks, families, teams, tribes), of organisms; organ izations, of groups (and sometimes single individual organisms); societies, of organizations, groups and individuals; and supra national systems, of societies and organizations."13 The other scheme I shall refer to is offered by Mario Bunge and consists of alternate categories of classification of hierarchical levels, as follows: l3Miller, op. cit. c</page><page sequence="14">136 ERVIN LASZLO Elementary particles—atomic nuclei—atoms—molecules— bodies Physical systems—chemical systems—organisms—ecosystems Physical processes—chemical processes—biological processes —psychical processes—social processes (=human histories) Material production—social life—intellectual culture Physics—chemistry—biology—psychology—sociology— historyu Bunge's categories are convenient tools to define those indicated for systems philosophy. First, we make a distinction between reality in toto (=the world), and that portion or aspect of reality which tends toward hierarchical order and pronounced structuration. In the latter, two types of hierarchi cal structures can be distinguished: the macrohierarchy encom passing astronomical units from the space-time field to the astronomical universe as a whole, and the microhierarchy (or microhierarchies) including organizations from particles to the global social and ecological system. Second, the microhierarchy is defined neither by the sub stance nor by the identity of its component systems, but by their organization. Of Bunge's categories, the second in the order listed applies to its terrestrial variant: physical systems— chemical systems—organisms—ecosystems. The other cate gories either focus on the individual substance or characteristics of the unit systems, or on the fields investigating them (with the exception of the third listing, which focusses on processes rather than on systems—a conceptualization which runs the risk of losing sight of uniformities disclosed by high-level invariances). Third, in the microhierarchy all systems are adaptive ordered wholes, partially surrounded by other such systems in their environment. Consequently such systems tend to form higher level suprasystems as a function of their mutual adaptations. For example, when in a solution atoms mutually "adapt" through the sharing of their outer electrons, they form mol ecular or crystalline suprasystems. These systems, when mutu ally adapted within a common environment, form still higher level suprasystems, such as cells. Cells mutually adapted form the multicellular organism and organisms mutually adapted form ecologies and societies. The key property is adaptive self UMario Bunge, "The Metaphysics, Epistemology and Methodology of Levels", Hierarchical Structures, op. cit.</page><page sequence="15">THE CASE FOR SYSTEMS PHILOSOPHY 137 maintenance of heterogeneous parts in interdependent, coacting relationships. Fourth, if a physical ground is sought for the existence of such systems, it must be sought, I submit, in the nature of space-time as a multi-dimensional field generating sets of con straints which produce non-probabilistic distributions of energy (mass) packets. Gravity, electromagnetism, and perhaps as yet undetected force-fields are required to produce sets of events with internal, non-equilibrium constraints, expressed already in the structure of hydrogen nuclei. Given such "partially ordered chaos", continued process will be in the direction of higher levels of order and complexity. Inputs ("disturbances") in these embryonic systems will lead to the differentiation of some dynamic properties, the merging of others, and the selective evolution of dynamic systems more fitted to their environment. Thus primitive nuclei acquire a complement of filled shells in suitable environments, and these manifest irreducible proper ties (chemical valence) which under suitable conditions, lead to the formation of multi-atomic associations (molecules). These in turn can evolve through continued environmental stimulation toward crystalline forms on the one hand, and polymeric associations on the other. The enduring systems evolve under constant environmental pressure and selective adaptation toward still more differentiated and integrated forms, adding weaker interactions to stronger ones, and building up the Chinese-box hierarchy of natural organizations. Thus at a certain point life appears, and later multi-organic structures in the form of eco systems and societies. The process is determined as to overall level of organization, but not as to local form or rate of progress. Its key charac teristics are the overall increase in level of organization, entail ing functional efficiency and the diversification of properties on the one hand, and inherent instability of a decreasing number of modules on the other. Thus stability is proportional to primi tiveness in level of organization, whereas functional efficiency, exhibited through an increasing variety of self-stabilizatory func tions and manifest properties, is proportional to complexity of organizational level. For example, heavier atoms are less stable than light ones but are more fit to their particular (usually stellar) environment; complex organisms, such as mammals, are more vulnerable than protozoa but are able to cope with changes in an environment which could be lethal to the latter; and social systems of the modern technocratic-bureaucratic variety are</page><page sequence="16">138 ERVIN LASZLO considerably less stable than primitive tribal societies but they, too, are more efficient in coping with pernicious influences in their particular environment. (Figure 2) Great functional efficiency goes hand in hand with the diver sification of phenomenal properties, and with the variety of specific organizational forms capable of performing the requisite functions. There are but 82 stable forms of atoms but some one million species of plants and animals. However, the quantitative abundance of atoms is considerably greater than the abundance Socio-and Ecosystems Global system Overall thrust of evolution Organisms Cells, proto organisms hf3 Crystals, colloids Molecules -h'5 -- Atoms of the alements (on earth) Range of self-stabilizatory functions of modules Overall structural stability of molecules Fig. 2 of living organisms. Hence there is a pronounced tendency toward individuation, as greater variety is introduced into populations of smaller size. Ultimately a single, highly diversi fied and qualitatively rich organization—the global socio ecosystem—supervenes over a somewhat less diversified but more populous class of social systems, topping the organization structure in the terrestrial microhierarchy. (Figure 3) An unknown number of microhierarchies may be super imposed on the levels of the cosmic macrohierarchy in suitable planetary surfaces, affording a possibly immensely rich array of forms of dynamic self-maintaining and self-evolving systems, driving toward increasing individuation and functional auto nomy, and paying for it in inherent structural instability. This giant process of organization could have started with no more than a partial ordering of randomness in some cosmic regions, as local complexities arose due to the combined action of known, and perhaps as yet unknown, forces, establishing non</page><page sequence="17">THE CASE FOR SYSTEMS PHILOSOPHY 139 random relations between packets of energies in structurally bound forms. Thereafter the action of physical constants on these primitive systems could branch into the complex panorama before us and in us.

III. Conclusions I have now offered some grounds for complaints concerning the present state of analysis-dominated philosophy, and adduced some evidence as to the wide vistas which may open to philo sophical consideration by using a general theory of systems as an integrative metalanguage. I do not wish to create the impression, however, that I advocate doing away with philosophical analysis. Quite the contrary: I believe that the analysis of meanings and of the structure of experience remains an important task of philo sophy. But if such analysis is to overcome the subjectivities intrinsic to experience itself, it must be undertaken within the context of an understanding of the human situation itself. And the human situation cannot be properly understood unless the</page><page sequence="18">140 ERVIN LASZLO genetic and historical nature of man, and his manifold ties to his environment are understood. Such understanding presup poses a knowledge of that slice of nature which I call the terrestrial microhierarchy. a complex dynamic level-structure within which system coacts with system and is embedded, as a Janus-faced holon, in an ascending sequence of increasingly individuated systems. Whitehead is vindicated: there are no facts floating around in nonentity. Each fact requires the under standing of the systematic universe which serves as its reference. The present study sought to demonstrate that an understand ing of the general characteristics of the dynamic sets of events which constitute us and our world can be achieved in reference to simple universal postulates, exemplified throughout the range of terrestrial organizations—and possibly beyond. Nature, Whitehead said, may not come as clean as we can think it. But, we should add, we can only understand any of it if we can think nature itself cleanly. The human mind grasps repeat ing patterns against vaguer backgrounds of order wherever it turns and whatever its training. It is an instrument of finite knowledge, and the primary patterns upon which it focusses must be adequate. This is the key characteristic of paradigms. They must be interpretable for the full range of experience, for they can give consistent meaning to the "buzzing confusion" which surrounds us throughout our conscious existence. The most consistent as well as most general paradigm avail able today to the inquiring, ordering mind is the systems paradigm. Explicated as a general theory of systems and applied to the analysis of human experience and its problems, it con stitutes a systems philosophy. This, then, is the conceptual framework within which classical philosophical analyses of experience, knowledge, art, religion, valuation, freedom, moral ity, dignity, and many other facets of philosophical interest, can take place. For within such a framework the anthropomorphic bias of commonsense experience is neutralized by reference to the systems philosophical paradigm, which takes man as one module embedded in an encompassing hierarchy of likewise concrete and actual physical, biological and social systems. (Figure 4) If systems philosophy is to become a working paradigm of contemporary thought, it must be pursued by a growing number of informed and perceptive investigators. Systems philosophy does not invalidate any scientific or philosophical question by branding it meaningless; it seeks to solve, not dissolve, prob</page><page sequence="19">THE CASE FOR SYSTEMS PHILOSOPHY 141 lems. There is ample opportunity within its conceptual frame work for collaborative work by scientists and philosophers of the most diverse interests. By sharing a common general framework, theories advanced by investigators of diverse interests become mutually relevant and beneficial.

For not any one formulation of a systems philosophy, but its general methodological and conceptual presuppositions, are its decisive constants. Specifications of the paradigm, and of any of its applications, can come and go; they can benefit from the interplay of many minds, with mutually relevant informa tion. But the systems philosophical framework can remain: it can be held that (i) the understanding of the human being and the world around him is possible in reference to a hierarchy of dynamic systems, defined in terms of their organizational invarances of state and function, and that (ii) the concept of such a systems hierarchy is the necessary framework of reference of all more detailed empirical analyses.</page></plain_text>
