<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Bruce clarke Gaming the Trace Systems Theory for Comparative Literature     Situated in the external zone of the Milky Way, the Sun takes about two  hundred million years to make a complete revolution of the Galaxy. Right, that’s how long it takes, not a day less,—Qfwfq said,—  once, as I went past, I drew a sign at a point in space, just so I could   find it again two hundred million years later, when we went by the next   time around. . . . I conceived the idea of making a sign, that’s true enough,   or rather, I conceived the idea of considering a sign a something that   I felt like making, so when, at that point in space and not in another,   I made something, meaning to make a sign, it turned out   that I really had made a sign, after all. Italo Calvino The recePTioN of The Trace Let’s imagine a beginning similar to the one Calvino’s Qfwfq tells, but more down  to Earth. We will begin not with a sign, exactly, but with the trace that precedes the  sign. Our origin myth has two versions. In the first myth, a long time ago, chipped  flint in hominid hand, some being confronts a roughly uniform piece of solid  matter, say, an outcropping of granite, and, for whatever reason, scratches a mark  into the stone. In the second myth, equally long if not longer ago, a meteor falls  to Earth sending up a splash of pulverized rock, one shard of which hits the same  granite outcropping and leaves an identical if unintentional scratch. For our pur- poses, the two versions tell the same story: traces arise whether they are intended  or not. However it came to be, this trace or mark subsists as a difference etched into  its stony medium. It endures for a while, for a thousand or ten million years. Insofar  as it endures, it memorializes its making. Persisting as a difference figured onto a  ground previously undifferentiated, at least with regard to the presence of marks,  the trace marks its own origin. In the first instance, for its observer, the trace refers  to itself.1 The trace refers to its own coming to be as a trace. But what next? What does it mean for a trace to endure, to cross over distances  and durations intervening between its coming to be in one place and moment and  186 </page> <page sequence="2"> its itinerary of future destinations? With regard to the temporality of the trace: as  long as the trace persists, it never ceases referring to itself. But too, the trace also  marks in an indeterminate manner the datum that time passes and has passed from  the moment of its taking place to all the later moments of its being observed, re-  marked, received by an observer capable of discerning it as a mark, as a sign of the  event that produced it. Qfwfq’s account could be taken to indicate that a sign comes  to be not when its trace is made, but when it is read as a sign. There will be an  interval, however infinitesimal or lengthy, between the production of a trace and its  observation as a sign. The time and place to be concerned with intentions is occu- pied by the observer of the trace. Placed now in the time of that observer or reader, the trace presents itself to a  present reception as a sign. Re- marking the trace, that observer can now intend to  understand it, can allow the trace to carry its understanding away, perhaps to re- construct a notion of the mark’s moment of production, or to cross over to what- ever other significances that observer can construct or entertain in regard to it.  Having imported an observer and all of the systemic baggage that phenomenon  brings onto the scene with it, our composite origin scenario is now compounded  of these elements: a prior event that makes a trace; a material or technical object  capable of tracing; a medium to accept and preserve the trace; the trace itself; inter- vening space; intervening time; and a later agent to observe and construe the trace  as a sign. These contingencies and implications of the trace can be gathered up in  the observation that, prior to any intention to code it for communication, the trace  transmits itself. The trace is self- mediating. However, for all that—and this is the crucial link in this argument: the trace does  not receive its own transmission. Or again, the trace is not self- observing. Only its  observer is in a position to process a trace as a sign conveying the implications that  its trace is both self- referential and self- mediating. The simple reason for this is that  observations must be performed by systems capable of marking the salient differ- entiations in a given instance. While the trace is a structure inscribing a difference,  it is not yet an observing or self-o bserving system. I will call this matter the hetero-  reception of the trace. Stepping forward now from these origin myths to our own cultural era, the  larger implication of the hetero-r eception of the trace is that media systems, in  and of themselves in their technological instance, are not self- operating. For all the  automation of which they are capable, in the fully systemic instance, they must be  operated and observed by—and thus, coupled to—other kinds of systems, specifi- cally systems capable of producing cognitions—autopoietic systems. Or again, in  order to have significant effects, traces taken as signs must be embedded in larger  networks that include (not necessarily human but) cognitive systems as well as in- formatic elements.  Gaming the Trace 187 </page> <page sequence="3"> I press this issue of hetero-r eception in order to counter what I perceive as broad  but problematic tendencies throughout our own cultural and theoretical moment,  tendencies to offload the duties or prerogatives of cognitive systems onto infor- matic structures. If structures, however elaborate, such as signs and their transmis- sion technologies, cannot self- receive at the level of meaning, then this tendency  to grant agency and intention directly to them, rather than to the larger networks  within which they may be coupled to cognitive systemic agencies, must be con- sidered not as a literal description but as an allegory of desire or a displacement  of responsibility. Let us bring this home, first of all, to narrative theory in its lit- erary and cinematic instances. The material mediums transmitting narrative texts  convey semiotic elements bound into significant structures. Typically replete with  signs observable as cogitating narrators and characters, narrative texts in particular  come forward as full-b lown self- referential apparatuses for the offloading of cog- nition and meaning-m aking onto the media carrying the text. At times we hear a  claim like “this text understands itself to be such and such” offered as if this were  not theoretical rhetoric but an ontological statement. Similarly, despite their purported non- fictionality, some theories of informa- tion and media—and here I think especially of the work of Friedrich Kittler—  indulge poetic and narrative figurations that transfer cognitive burdens to medi- atic infrastructures. It is supposed that information is or can be meaningful in its  sheer transmission and storage, and can have intentions of its own in the absence  of any cognitive construction of its meaningfulness. It is not so; meanings result  instead from coupled networks of informatic and cognitive processes. A systems-  theoretical critique of or autopoietic supplement to information and media theo- ries can provide a more precise description of the different systems actually in play  when meanings are made. And from that more rigorous and nuanced analysis, one  can proceed to parse the interrelations of media environments and observing sys- tems in more effective ways. SemiolePSiS In any semiotic instance there is an ecology of systems to consider. Cognition col- laborates with mediation to produce the psychic and social events about which we  think and communicate. So, coming back to the trace, and granting the necessary  supplement of an operating observer: as we were saying, in addition to its self-  reference, and in addition to whatever may come to be construed as the semantic  reference that transforms it into a sign, a trace or mark is also a cue for the intu- ition of an interval, a duration, and hence a passage, in time if not also in space.  When the trace is also receivable as an image—an iconic sign—it is already, even  in its stasis, so to speak, a moving image. In its endurance any trace is already the  188 The comParaTiST 37 : 2013 </page> <page sequence="4"> sign of a passage—certainly from one time to another, potentially from one place  to another, and depending on its observer, from one meaning to another. In this  sense, writing and telecommunication—as media for the transmission of signals  that carry signs—are epiphenomena, further unfoldings, of the originary élan of  the trace. From another important and well-d iscussed angle, this eventfulness is the dif- férance of the trace, its differential structure of multiple deferrals. But I want to  emphasize the cognitive kinetics of the situation. Semiolepsis picks up this sense  by suggesting, not the seizure precisely, but by means of the bad pun, the leap of  the trace. Or, more precisely, the leap that we observers endow upon the trace by  seizing it, yielding the creative reversal that it has seized us. It may be that we are all  constitutionally semioleptic, sufferers of semiolepsy, in thrall to signs. Nevertheless,  and despite that, just as they play us, we also play signs, as I am doing now. We can  game the trace, give signs a spin to see what they can do. There may be no choice  but to submit to semiolepsy, but we can still have a go at semiolepsis. Here is my literary notion: a motivation for displacement is spring- loaded— not into the trace per se—but into the bundle of trace and observer marked by the  reception of the trace. After all, for it to jump at and seize us, we must first seize  the trace by jumping to it. Between us, human readers, and signs, compounded of  traces, is a circuit that is constitutionally jumpy—jumpy in space, jumpy in time,  jumpy in sense. Put another way, the advent of signs is always already eventful.  With their mere presentation coupled to their mere observation, a cluster of dif- ferences has already occurred, and a story is already ready to continue. My larger  thesis is that, in this sense of semiolepsis, any narrative passage is already a virtual  allegory of the eventfulness of the sign. Add to that the way that the mode of alle- gory goes beyond the mere semiotic instance to mark a figural semiolepsis, a leap  from one level of signification to another. In the Western tradition, as Michel Serres  reminds us, this is the mode of Hermes, the psychopomp, messenger of the gods,  guide of souls, the maker of passages from one to another realm of being (Serres  3–5). Narrative is an allegory of the eventfulness of the observation of the trace. Take for  instance a particular and perennial form of narrative event, one that is also typically  an allegorical event, and one that plays for all it’s worth on this spring-l oadedness  of the sign. This form of narrative fabula literalizes the élan of the sign to induce  the depiction of the grandest leap of all—the leap to top all others: the leap of the  soul from one body to another. Its classical Western denomination is metempsy- chosis. I invoke this archaic or hermetic topos to suggest that this mytheme is itself  an allegory of the remarking of the trace, of being carried away by the observation  of the trace, the mark, or the sign. The mythos of metempsychosis surely goes all  the way back to the scratching of flints on stones. But let us pick up the story with   Gaming the Trace 189 </page> <page sequence="5"> the account of reincarnations Pythagoras relates in his speech at the end of Ovid’s  Metamorphoses: . . . Our souls survive this death; as they depart Their local habitations in the flesh, They enter new- found bodies that preserve them. . . . All things change, yet never die, Or here or there, the spirit takes its way, To different kinds of being as it chooses, From beast to man, from man to beast; however. Or near or far or strange, it travels on. (Ovid 418–19) In its attribution to Pythagoras, Ovid’s discourse is a sublime pastiche in the ser- vice of his epic comedy of transformations, as he works over a prior millennium  of story cycles. Notable nonetheless is the endemic dualism of the Western sensi- bility, the dichotomy of mortal body and immortal soul, which separation maps so  readily onto the dichotomy of material signifier and conceptual signified. It does  this so effectively that Ferdinand de Saussure has to issue an edict against so con- struing the composite entity of the linguistic sign: This unified duality [of signifier and signified] has often been compared with  that of the human being, comprising body and soul. But the parallel is unsatis- factory. A better one would be with chemical compounds, such as water. Water  is a combination of hydrogen and oxygen: but taken separately neither element  has any of the properties of water. (Saussure 102) Two millennia later than Ovid, roughly contemporary with Saussure, James  Joyce, another exiled purveyor of narrative transmigrations, performs a semio- lepsis upon the signifier metempsychosis itself, refracting that ponderous sign  through Leopold Bloom’s interior monologue and recollection of Molly Bloom’s lit- eral concretization of its syllables: “Mr Bloom moved forward raising his troubled  eyes. . . . Parallax. I never exactly understood. There’s a priest. Could ask him. Par  it’s Greek: parallel, parallax. Met him pikehoses she called it till I told her about the  transmigration. O rocks!” (154). Joyce’s retelling of the Odyssey produces a monu- mental transfusion of the fabula of Homer’s epic—that is, not of its narrative sig- nifier but of its narrative signified, its “soul”—into a complex tale of linguistic and  cultural developments. At the same time, it retains the semioleptic feature of alle- gorical construction that I mentioned a while back. The world of the Homeric epic  is housed in a cosmos, a spatial framework of divine, mundane, and subterranean  levels of being, levels mediated or leapt across by Zeus’s emissary, Hermes, or by the  divine Athena in her metamorphic disguises, as well as, of course, by the vision of  190 The comParaTiST 37 : 2013 </page> <page sequence="6"> the bard transmitting the tale. This leaping among the narrative’s diegetic levels re- turns in Joyce’s novel both in its very temporal parallax between the Homeric time  of its legendary subtext and the world of Dublin on June 16, 1906, and in its narra- tor’s strenuous shifting between external and internal points of observation. For one more example of narrativized semiolepsis, you may recall how Carl  Sagan’s novel Contact purveys a contemporary secular mythology by staging a  galactic intelligence, its receipt of echoes from the television broadcast of Hitler’s  opening the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, its retransmission of that broad- cast back to Earthlings with an embedded message, its reception on Earth, and its  decoding into schematics for the construction of a technological system of some  unknown sort. The very name of this fabulation posits Roman Jakobson’s phatic  function, the material basis or physical connection without which communication  as such cannot function. In the movie version, the vehicle at the center of this alien  technology supports a single passenger, the SETI scientist Ellie Arroway, played  by Jodie Foster. The purpose of the vehicle seems to be the transportation and/or  the transmission of its occupant across the galaxy to a place of cosmic epiphany.  But for my reading here the crux of this cinematic telling is the drastically ex- tended, viscerally exhausting leap across space itself, as Ellie commits her leap of  faith in extraterrestrial intelligence.2 Down the cosmic wormholes to and beyond  the system of Vega she goes—or does she? One way or another, the depicted event  of her galactic transit draws on the fabled exhilaration of Einstein riding on his  thought- experimental light beam. Ellie is our science- fictional Hermes, a cosmic  mediator transmitted beyond the speed of light, across a fold in space itself to a  moment of sublime reception. As a form of narrative event, and at the base of all such semantic transmigra- tions of literary and narrative signs, metempsychosis always was and remains an  allegory not so much of the soul but of its machinery, the technics of the trace. If  you want to see a picture of the soul, observe a scratch on a rock. The élan with  which we receive traces as signs is the Ursprung of stories that pivot on these radical  passages, displacements in space, or in time, or in embodiment. Such displaced ma- terialities may also occur with shifts in the literal medium of the narrative text—for  instance, the leaping back and forth from verbal to visual signifiers—or with meta- morphic shifts in the diegetic body depicted by the signifiers of that text. Breaking  this back down to the primal trace: any one mark, when received as a cue for cog- nitive operations, has multiple implications already built into it. Bound up in any  mark is a potential dynamism, a contingent or non-r andom concatenation of sig- nifying events, that is always already underway to narrative formation. This élan or  eventfulness of the trace offers an approach to the connections between signs and  their media, a way to further unfold the motivations for displacement, or transport,   Gaming the Trace 191 </page> <page sequence="7"> or transmigration built into the power of narrative as a form taken by material me- diums, and as a semiotic medium in its own right, within which psychic and social  systems construct a significant number of their specific productions. SySTemS Theory For all that, if our concerns are for comparative literature, or for narrative theory,  or for matters of discursive communication in general, do we really need systems  theory? And if so, why do we need in particular the second-o rder systems theory  that unfolds from the concept of autopoiesis in Niklas Luhmann’s constructions  of its psychical and social extensions?3 Well, for one, this neocybernetic discourse  provides a theory of cognition that can gather grammatology, structural linguistics,  and narratology together and supplement them all with a strong account of how  observing systems operate upon semiotic structures. For another, without systems  theory’s rigorous account of cognitive operations, our literary and cultural theo- ries tend to slip back toward an earlier cybernetics, revert to forms of mere in- formatics that break down proper operational boundaries between narrative and  media technologies on the one hand and psychic and social systems on the other. In  that case, we tend to float off into fantasies either of hermetic control or of incon- tinent flow, rather than holding fast to good neocybernetic differentiations, opera- tional boundaries, and their ineluctable contingencies. The scheme of systems differentiations I present here is developed directly  from Luhmann’s social systems theory but makes explicit some matters that Luh- mann leaves unstated or undeveloped. It is based on his definitive appropriation  for a general systems theory of the concept of autopoiesis put forward by Chilean  biologists Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela.4 In their original instance,  the concept of autopoiesis provides only an external distinction, setting off auto- poietic systems as living or biotic systems—those studied by biology—from non- autopoietic systems as nonliving or abiotic systems—for instance, those studied by  physics or computer science. As a result, the further development of their approach  subsumes psychic and social operations under a generalized notion of living sys- tems. In contrast, Luhmann’s theory extends autopoiesis beyond the biological in- stance. This produces a second distinction, one internal to an enlarged concept of  autopoiesis, which I have termed that between the biotic autopoiesis of living sys- tems and the metabiotic autopoiesis of minds and societies. In this description, autopoiesis is a constitutive process describing the basal  self- referential operation of living, psychic, and social systems, each of which  must operate in the first instance to bind and maintain the system of its own self-  production. While the dynamics of biotic systems work upon material atoms and  molecules, the dynamics of metabiotic systems construct virtual forms and pro- 192 The comParaTiST 37 : 2013 </page> <page sequence="8"> fiGure 1. Systems Differentiations cess their distinctions. Luhmann brings psychic and social systems under a gen- eral description of autopoiesis, without collapsing them into living dynamics, by  redefining the elements of their production as different kinds of meaning- events.  Meaning becomes the medium in which elements of consciousness and communi- cation may interpenetrate while maintaining operational distinction into separate  systems. As a result, in this description, psychic and social events also do not col- lapse into each other, but retain an operational level of contingent autonomy. Metabiotic systems are operationally distinct from living systems. But neverthe- less, they emerge from, and only from, and exist only in relation to, biotic systems.  In Luhmann’s theory, human psychic and social systems “interpenetrate,” that is,  while they are operationally distinct, their relative autonomy is co-e volutionary,  co- emergent. Either presents the immediate and indispensable environment of the  other. In other words, the extent of their autonomy is strictly internal and opera- tional. Externally, their existence is absolutely contingent upon environments that  contain other kinds of systems. Moreover, in humans, both psychic and social sys- tems participate in the shared medium of meaning introduced by linguistic func- tions. In Luhmann’s text the phrase meaning systems names both psychic and social  systems at once. Let us magnify the content of this second distinction. What Maturana and Varela,  carrying forward a mechanistic semantics, term the dynamics of an autopoietic  system, Luhmann generalizes as its operations. It is the recursive self- operationality  of such self- referential ensembles that is proper to autopoietic systems. In each in- stance—with either the membrane-b oundedness of biotic autopoietic systems or  the form-d istinctness of metabiotic autopoietic systems—operational closure is a  fundamental contingency. Such internal autonomy is necessary for the continua-  Gaming the Trace 193 </page> <page sequence="9"> tion of autopoietic operations and thus for the self- maintenance of life, mind, or  communication, as the case may be. It is also the formal precondition for an auto- poietic system’s capacity not just to register but to cognize its environment. Let us now bring in the matters of technology in general and media in par- ticular and theorize the interrelation of autopoietic and technological systems. We  note that machines are not autopoietic—they perform neither biotic nor meta- biotic autopoietic operations. Simply by keeping this distinction available to a  world still besotted with cyborgian mergers, the concept of autopoiesis justifies  its theoretical existence and longevity. Machines are maintained from without and  may be operated elsewhere. In other words, they are operationally open, whereas  only operationally closed but environmentally open—that is, autopoietic—systems  are capable of cognizing themselves and constructing a cognition of their environ- ments. Nonetheless, it is the case that technical objects emerge only out of environ- ments compounded with the metabiotic autopoietic systems of (not necessarily  human) minds and societies. Here another distinction emerges—this one internal  to the concept of the nonautopoietic system—between abiotic and metabiotic vari- eties. Abiotic nonautopoietic systems may take straightforward natural forms such  as stars and their planets, rivers or thunderstorms. But machines—nonautopoietic  technological systems—are as emergently metabiotic as psyches and societies, and  therefore are a species of meaning systems in their own right. That is, technics is  constitutionally paradoxical: it partakes of autopoiesis while not itself producing it.  Technological systems constitute a metabiotic yet nonautopoietic emergence struc- turally coupled to the interpenetration of psyches and societies. These three kinds  of system—psychic, technical, and social—albeit with radically different modes of  operation, occupy the plane of metabiotic artifacts. The paradox here, to state it once again, is that machines are at once nonauto- poietic and metabiotic. They participate with autopoiesis, while not precisely pos- sessing it. Being so intimate with psychic and social systems, it is as if technical  systems feign the status of autopoietic systems. The quest for the self-p roducing  automaton is ongoing. Some would like nothing better than to perfect the cyber- netic machine—one that lives, thinks, and communicates. For so they have always  already seemed to us. We experience them, or at least, we fantasize them and we fic- tionalize them as such, as it were, semioleptically—as living or thinking or feeling  or communicating, as replicants ready at any moment to come to life, to exercise  agency, to ache inside, to seek companions. We are so intimate with our machines,  it would seem, because in some sense they are not ours, they seem to possess a  phantom autonomy. 194 The comParaTiST 37 : 2013 </page> <page sequence="10"> avatar aND iTS SySTemS For instance, consider the avatar in James Cameron’s latest global blockbuster,  Avatar. The avatars in Avatar are also cognitive systems interacting with and within  a living and social world. The movie Avatar lifts the informatic interactivity of a  virtual- reality or cyberspace scenario and couples it to a realm of autopoietic cog- nition. This cinematic fiction imagines the anthropomorphic fulfillment of a bio- cybernetic system by submitting a media technology to a condition of humanoid  embodiment. The avatars in Avatar equivocate between the informatic and the  cognitive—between technological transmissions and autopoietic productions. This  overdetermined media technology works insofar as it corresponds to its audience’s  desire for such a hybrid or cyborg fusion to exist. The proxy and sign of such a  desire is deposited in a magic little word: when the system works, there is a link.  Jake Sully’s first time linking up with his avatar is figured as a telematic leap. And quite helpfully for entertaining twists and turns of the story, the link be- tween driver and avatar is inherently precarious. It comes with contingencies of  attachment: while the avatar is active its driver must be alert but immobilized; in  order for the driver to take care of his or her own bodily needs their avatar must  sleep. While linked, the driver is literally helpless, sharing their avatar’s prenatal  status as a kind of fetus umbilically connected to a technological womb and vul- nerable to a forced abortion. These contingencies lead to any number of adven- turous scheduling issues, vigorously exploited by the plot. But more important than  these manufactured complications are the formal implications of the avatar regime.  Both as an observing system in its own right and as an element of the tale under  the viewer’s observation, this hybridic biocybernetic apparatus generates signifi- cant existential contradictions. Just as technics is constitutionally paradoxical, the  cultural unconscious of this technological fabulation is meaningfully paradoxical. At closer range, and as first focalized by the human characters, an unlinked  avatar is an inert but living husk—a body awaiting animation. Bioengineered on  Earth and grown in vitro en route, they appear as unborn adult fetuses floating  in their amniotic vats. Dialogue informs us of their hybrid genome, mixed from  human and Na’vi DNA, allowing the neural connections needed to hardwire the  cross-o ver from a human mind to a Na’vi body. Fresh avatar bodies are decanted  fully ready to be operated, and as Jake Sully reports early on to his video log, he is  there “to drive these remotely-c ontrolled bodies,” once his mind is linked to his  avatar’s sensory and motor systems. In other words, an avatar is both the object of  real- time remote control through its driver’s teleaction—essentially and by design,  a drone—and also the living effector by which its telepresent operator can interact  with or manipulate other objects or persons at the avatar’s location. An individual  avatar, then, is just one node of a complex and regimented system, one compo-  Gaming the Trace 195 </page> <page sequence="11"> nent of a biotechnological consortium and technosocial network reaching back to  a genetic- engineering infrastructure on planet Earth. Moreover, in a way that the filmic discourse never spells out, the avatar system  must also be assumed to incorporate a transceiving apparatus, an interactive tele- communications link. By some means of mutual neural- psychic signaling, infor- mation about the perceptions and actions of a linked and functioning avatar is  transmitted back to and received by the driver as he or she lies physically immo- bilized in a closed berth at a link station and phenomenologically immersed in  that prosthetic body. The intentions and decisions of the remote driver must also  be instantaneously transmitted to and received, reconstructed, and enacted by the  avatar. On the side of the human driver’s instrumentation there may be some ex- terior transceiver attached to the link station, but on the side of the avatar there  must be a transceiving device of some sort embedded within or genetically engi- neered into its body. The cinematic discourse is content to have this material tele- communicational matter covered over as cybernetic telepathy. Avatar fills these logistical and existential gaps in the workings of the avatar  system with other signs elsewhere in the story. For instance, many Pandoran life  forms have an organ not possessed by terrestrial animals. On the first evening of  Jake’s avatar’s existence as a link-d riven human- Na’vi hybrid, it notices how its  braided Na’vi ponytail ends in a cluster of waving filaments. Head scientist Grace  Augustine driving her avatar remarks dismissively, “Don’t play with that, you’ll go  blind.” The masturbation joke strikes home: the function of this organ is neural  intercourse. And as we learn, the ease of its operation stands counter to the compli- cated technological logistics needed to link a human mind to its living avatar body.  This Pandoran organ suggests that a relatively immediate organic coupling of one  sensorium to another is as easy as twisting two wires together. In the Na’vi language, the function of this organ is tsaheylu—a making of “the  bond,” direct neural contact between two beings, and also between the Na’vi al- together and Eywa, defined in the online Na’vi- English dictionary as world spirit,  Gaia(“Gaia”). As the story progresses, through acts of tsaheylu Jake’s avatar will  bond with and ride upon a series of animals, will hear the Tree of Voices, and finally,  connect with the Tree of Souls, the main line to Eywa. The Pandoran bond, then, is  a naturalized displacement of and organic supplement to the biotechnological link  between a human driver and its avatar. Tsaheylu—the bond—may be understood  as a displacement and renaturalization, an organic interiorization of the exterior  connectivity of the teleactive link. Autopoietic bodily organs are not just coupled  to but take the place of computerized telecommunicational prostheses. Playing out  its imaginary cross of the informatic and the cognitive, the technological and auto- poietic, Avatar will fuse these two together by telling a tale of posthuman metamor- phosis, a story of metempsychosis by embodied mediation. 196 The comParaTiST 37 : 2013 </page> <page sequence="12"> We come once more to metempsychosis, narrative signs of the leap of the soul  from one body to another. The avatar system is designed to produce temporary  technological metempsychoses, telecommunicational leaps, by beaming the minds  of the drivers into the bodies of their vehicles for discrete periods of time. With  his avatar body already prepared by hybridization with his identical twin brother’s  genome, Jake Sully’s incorporeal being undergoes metempsychotic interludes with  his avatar, and ultimately, a permanent metempsychosis through a final transmis- sion into his avatar. Befitting the informatic structure of these species-s pecific  phatic or connective operations—the link and the bond—the narrative discourse  provides both with distinct signs. The cinematic sign of the link is a pulsing energy  vortex suggesting the mind or spirit’s speed-o f- light leap across space to make con- tact between its sender and receiver. We have seen this visual signature before: Jodie  Foster’s character rode one across the galaxy in Contact. In Avatar, it marks Jake’s  phatic links, and also, tellingly, the moment when the soul of the mortally wounded  Grace Augustine makes tsaheylu with Eywa, but does not as hoped return to life in  the body of her avatar. Otherwise, when established between Pandoran vertebrates, the cinematic sign  of the bond is an opening or dilating eye. In the film’s informatic semiotics, the link  is presented as a transmission, the bond as a reception. Short of death, they both  convey the establishing of a two- way circuit, but the link is focalized from the posi- tion of the sender, the bond by another’s observation of the receiver. The failure  of Grace’s soul to pass through the “eye of Eywa” back into a mortal body is at the  same time its successful transmission to Eywa. The scientist’s dying words would  affirm the suggested metaphysics: “I’m with her, Jake. She’s real.” Her ascension to  the world spirit is figured by a tubular conduit into a burst of white light. In con- trast, in the movie’s final scene, when the mind of Jake Sully succeeds in passing  through the eye of Eywa permanently into his avatar body, the reception of his  living metempsychosis is figured as Eywa’s accomplishment and marked instanta- neously by the sign of the bond: we watch his Na’vi eyes open wide. The informatic  link in now bonded bodily to biotic and metabiotic cognitions. To conclude, then, as we increasingly come to understand through the work  of André Leroi- Gourhan, Gilbert Simondon, Michel Serres, Bernard Stiegler, and  many others, technics co- emerges along with the processes of hominization and is  coeval with the human mind and human society.5 Nevertheless, no matter how sys- temic or self- regulating, technical objects such as narrative signs and their media,  while they are elements cognitively processed by autopoietic systems, are not cog- nitive in their own right. Unlike the operations of consciousness and communica- tion, they do not produce themselves, and they do not make their own meaning.  Rather, on the plane of metabiotic systems, their particular function is to convey  traces fit for meaning, to transmit signs to be rendered meaningful. Their produc-  Gaming the Trace 197 </page> <page sequence="13"> tion is mediation. Like the trace prior to the sign, they spur the making of meaning,  and once made, they make it leap over distances and ages. Relative to the auto- poietic realm, then, technics makes externalized receptacles for the mentation,  communication, and memorialization of psychic and social systems. Technical ob- jects and technological systems are precisely avatars called forth by the continuous  metabiotic autopoietic need to structurally couple together ever- renewed, ever self-  reproduced minds and conversations. u Texas Tech University NoTeS I want to thank Allen Miller and the SCLA for the opportunity to present this material as  the keynote address to the 2012 meeting in Las Vegas, Nevada. It was drafted in 2010–11  at the International Research Institute for Cultural Technologies and Media Philosophy  (IKKM) at the Bauhaus- University Weimar, Germany. It will appear in different form and  wider context in Mysteries of Cognition: Systems, Media, Narrative, forthcoming from the  University of Minnesota Press.  1 This ontological, hence atemporal, aspect of the form of the trace has been well stated:  “A mark or sign intended as an indicator is self- referential. The self is the whole space  including the mark and the observer. But the mark points, in the first place, to its own  location, and in this process becomes a locus of reference. The mark refers to itself. The  whole refers to itself through the mark” (Kauffman 53). However, I have constructed my  origin scenarios to be indifferent to the matter of intention and to suggest that, for its  observer, the trace will be construed as self- referential whether it is intended as an indi- cator or not.  2 That cosmic ride can be viewed here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8axMaBL4uo.  3 See Niklas Luhmann, Social Systems.
