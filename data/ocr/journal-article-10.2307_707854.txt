<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW 217 ISIS AND SARAPIS LADISLAV VIDMAN: Isis und Sarapis bei den Griechen und R6mern. (Religions- geschichtliche Versuche und Vorarbeiten, xxix.) Pp. vi+189. Berlin: de Gruyter, I970o. Cloth, DM. 52. IN spite of self-imposed limitations Vidman's Sylloge inscriptionum religionis Isiacae et Sarapiacae (Berlin, 1969) is a useful compilation, and here he has attempted an interpretation of the cult which is largely based on the in- scriptions, although the literary and archaeological evidence is also taken into account. The limitations referred to apply to this work too, at least in some ways. For instance, the author will have nothing to do with theophoric names (pp. Io f.), taking the view that their religious significance atrophies after the first or second generations of their bearers, and that, further, it is not always easy to know to which generation a name belongs. Vidman refers to Sterling Dow's discussion in Harv. Theol. Rev. xxx (I937), 183 ff., especially pp. 216-24, as one which exhibits suitable scepticism on the matter. Dow is not really so sceptical. He makes the point that 'the name of any given person necessarily reflects his parents' interests, not his own'; he also shows that in Athens in the second century B.C. the tradition of re-using the name of a boy's father or grandfather was breaking down, and that other factors were gaining ground, including cult preference. He concludes, too, that 'many instances of a given theophoric name in one limited period strongly suggest that the cult of the deity in question was then popular'. Dow finds that the total of about 350 theophoric names for Isis in Athens is 'impressive'. Vidman properly refers to Tod's study in B.S.A. xxiii (1918-19), 67-97, especially pp. 86-9, though he clearly rejects its viewpoint on 'personal names as indicative of the spread of the Egyptian cults'. Admittedly the cases adduced by Tod are mostly Mace- donian instances where the names occur in inscriptions expressly concerned with the cults, so that the names per se do not provide the evidence. In the case of Sarapis P. M. Fraser in his 'Two Studies on the Cult of Sarapis in the Hellenistic World' (Opusc. Athen. iii. [1960], 1-54) has thoroughly investigated the relevant theophoric names both within and outside Egypt, after positing that such names 'provide one of the most valuable means of determining the popularity of this or that god in antiquity'. For the names outside Egypt (which alone concern Vidman's book) he concludes (pp. 48 f.) that those deriving from Sarapis 'achieved no popularity until Imperial times, when the appeal of the god was greatly increased by the adoption of monotheistic attributes'. In reaching this conclusion Fraser uses all necessary caution. I would demur only to his statement (p. 14) that 'Greeks had in general no objection to the use of Egyptian theophoric names'. There is one category they eschewed: the gods intimately connected with death-Osiris and Anubis. The Egyptians themselves had at first avoided using Osiris thus; cf. my Origins of Osiris, 103. Similarly the Greeks, who kept off Pluto, would not use Anubis; see Dow, op. cit. 223. It is true that Sarapis is associated with Pluto in Plutarch, De Is. et Os. 27, where Archemachus the Euboean and Heracleides of Pontus are cited. Probably the equation was not stamped on the popular mind. Still, the main evidence lies elsewhere, and Vidman treats it soberly and prudently. His first chapter is entitled 'Isis, Osiris und Sarapis', and it may be suggested that the second name should have appeared in the title of the book, 4598.2 Q</page><page sequence="2">218 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW since Osiris gained some importance, as Vidman shows, in the Roman era in the West. In fact he underestimates this importance because he barely looks beyond the inscriptions. He duly notes that Plutarch's title involves Isis and Osiris, and not Sarapis. Plutarch, it is true, is often recording earlier phases. This is not true of Apuleius, who bears clear witness to the living cults in the middle of the second century; to him the culmination of the initiations of Lucius takes place in Rome in the name of Osiris as the highest god; and he scarcely mentions Sarapis. Again, there is archaeological evidence for the importance of Osiris: see the figures of Osiris Hydreios shown in reliefs from the Iseum in the Campus Martius in Bosticci, Mus. Capitolini: i monumenti egizi ed egittizzanti (Rome, 1952), pls. 6 and 8; and the statuettes of the god from Roman Hungary in Wessetsky, Die dgyptischen Kulte zur Rimerzeit in Ungarn (Leiden, 1961), pls. 4, 13, 21, and further similar finds published by him in more recent studies. Eve and John R. Harris, The Oriental Cults in Roman Britain (Leiden, 1965), 89, record a head of Osiris Hydreios from Kent and mention other possible figures. A bronze figure of Osiris from Baden-Baden, of first- century origin, is reproduced by Grimm, Die Zeugnisse dgyptischer Religion und Kunstelemente im rimischen Deutschland (Leiden, 1969), pl. 4, I, and he appends a useful list of other possible occurrences on pp. 163 f.; cf. too Leclant, Orien- talia, xxxviii (1969), 296 and 301. At the same time Vidman (p. 14) is able to correct Nilsson on the interpretation of Taposeirias, showing that it is an Isiac epithet. He accepts an allusion to Osiris in an inscription from Didyma of the year 288/7 B.c. which involves the dedication of a cup to Osiris by Seleucus I and his son Antiochus in the temple of Apollo. This is the earliest reference to Osiris in a Greek inscription outside Egypt, and Nilsson had expressed some doubt about it. Mr. Francis Piejko, of the University of North Carolina, tells me that he intends to propose a new reading of the divine name. The evolution of these cults in the Graeco-Roman world involved continuity and change, and the trend of recent research is to emphasize the continuity. Vidman (p. 8) seems rather too blithely to consign the Egyptian origins to Egyptologists, with the result that some misleading assessments are made. He tells us (p. 173) that the interpretatio Romana had a greater fondness for the 'monstrous' Osiris; yet on p. 12 he rightly stresses that this god is consistently anthropomorphic (at least the exceptions are few). He uncritically accepts Vandebeek's view that the representation of Isis in Hellenistic art is entirely Greek. Whereas the stylistic treatment is of course Greek, most details of the iconography are Egyptian: Schdifer showed long ago that the distinctive Isiac dress is derived from an Egyptian prototype, and Vidman himself recognizes that the crown with sun-disc and horns goes back to Hathor. The uraeus, situla, and sistrum are also Egyptian; but the ears of corn are probably bor- rowed from Demeter, and there are doubtless other un-Egyptian elements in special forms such as Isis Tyche or Panthea. Isis Pelagia, on the other hand, seems now to have Egyptian antecedents, and Vidman (p. 86) is to some extent aware of this. Castiglione's recent study ('Isis Pharia', Bull. du Mus. Hongrois des Beaux-arts, xxxiv-xxxv (1970), 37-55) has substantiated the connection. There are instructive chapters on the priests and their congregations. Here the Egyptian and Graeco-Roman elements are carefully sifted, and it is shown that the early concept of a permanent priesthood often gave way to that of an annual priesthood on the Greek pattern, although the Egyptian idea was more</page><page sequence="3">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW 219 prevalent in the West. Vidman (p. 51) appears to interpret the expressions sacerdos maximus, summus sacerdos, and primarius sacerdos, used by Apuleius, as referring to different priests of the first rank. Apuleius also uses the term sacerdos praecipuus (ch. 22), and there can be little doubt that they are all variations of the same title, especially as three of the forms are applied to the high priest who deals personally with Lucius and must therefore designate the same per- son. A term applied three times by Apuleius to Isiac devotees is sacrati (ch. 24, bis; ch. 27), and his phrase turbae sacrorum (ch. 23) was accordingly emended by Brantz to t. sacratorum. Vidman (p. 89) wishes to retain sacrorum, comparing it with the genitive found in several Isiac inscriptions and interpreting this, apparently, as a masculine form. It is surely neuter in the inscriptions, as in the Mithraic phrase pater sacrorum. In his cautious assessment of the spread of the cults Vidman is unwisely hypercritical of the archaeological evidence; he knows the work of Leclant and Wessetzky, but scarcely takes real account of it. He is loth to date the first 'Mysteries' of the Egyptian gods earlier than the first century A.D., but his scepticism is ill advised. In this connection he cities Bergman, Ich bin Isis, 230 ff. Yet he practically ignores the data there stressed. The enduring merit of this book lies in its detailed study of the personnel of the cults. University College, Swansea J.
