JACKSON for the validity of feature or fictional films as a source-a final answer I would hope to those who insist that "Hollywood" movies don't fall in the historian's rightful purview. Marc Ferro, a French scholar, offers a sample of film study via his close examination of the 1934 Soviet epic Chapayev. Shot by shot, Ferro dissects his subject and weaves together the film content with the realities of Soviet politics during the Stalin period; the result is a historian's analysis of an important film and an excellent example of the possibilities of understanding the past inherent in film. Unfortunately, Ferro's article is also a good example of the Gallic predilection for elaborate systemiza- tion, made more difficult by what appears to be a ponderous translation. Rolf Schuursma, from Holland, writes with notable wisdom about the historian as filmmaker, a theme that is continued by the British historian John Grenville. Both Schuursma and Grenville have undertaken the pro- duction of films based on archival material, Schuursma in his Arnhem and Grenville as a founder of the British Inter-University History Film Con- sortium, and both speak from arduous experience of the obstacles as well as the rewards for the historian as producer. Arthur Marwick of the Open University and Bryan Haworth of the Padgate College of Educa- tion both approach the historian as teacher, exploring the manifold uses of film as a classroom aide and instructional device. Marwick, as usual, takes vigorous positions but his opinions are worthy of respect, for his work at the Open University, where televised film is the core of the cur- riculum, makes him one of the most film-wise historians in the world. A special note of gratitude is due to Nicholas Pronay of the Univer- sity of Leeds, who has written a stylish and insightful essay about British newsreels from their origin in the Igoos to their demise in the last decade. Pronay's handling of the newsreel record as a tool to probe British public opinion in the inter-war years and his ability to link changing interna- tional relations to the complex newsreel business should stand as a model for other historians. He notes, for example, that most of the newsreels seen by the British public during the I930s were made and distributed by American-dominated companies and reflected an American attitude to- ward world affairs. Smith's book is sui generis, and until it has been fol- lowed by others, rates the highest possible marks for both scholarship and initiative. The bibliography is the best I know of on the subject of film and the historian. Martin A. Jackson SUNY Maritime College Death in America. Edited by David E. Stannard (Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania Press, I975) 158 pp. $Io.oo Man has always been ambivalent about death. He is infinitely expert in killing, and ranks his military heroes among his greatest men; yet the</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS | 715 concept of immortality permeates his religions, and his burial sites are omnipresent evidence of either his belief in, or his fear of, the spirit who might live beyond the grave. Death has ever been a major theme of poets and playwrights; historians traditionally deal in war, pestilence, and as- sassination. But it is only recently that death itself has become a popular subject for academic research. The exaggerated denial of death charac- teristic of the twentieth century, especially in America, where mausoleums have piped-in music and machines in hospitals keep alive the technically dead, has stimulated many new studies. Notable among them areJessica Mitford's ironic The American Way of Death (New York, I963) and the late Ernest Becker's brilliant volumes, The Denial of Death (New York, 1973) and Escape from Evil (New York, 1976), which illumi- nate the triangular relationship of man's affection for killing, his terror of death, and his quest for perpetual life. To this growing literature, which is beginning to constitute a scien- tific bibliography on death, we have Stannard's Death in America, a col- lection of essays by several authors. It attempts to provide an historical background for the "contemporary cultural suppression of death" and the American obsession with the present (xi). The authors are concerned not so much with the gross commercial exploitation of death, but rather with the psychic penalties accompanying the virtual disappearance of mourning. As Phillippe Aries points out in his essay, "The Reversal of Death," people increasingly die, heavily sedated, in hospitals. They die in virtual secrecy, many of them denied the ultimate truth freely granted to the dying in earlier societies. Our deathbed scenes contrast strikingly with those of other centuries, especially the twelfth and thirteenth in Europe, where the afflicted was told he was about to die, where it was generally believed that spirits from heaven and hell were fighting over the departing soul, and where every resource of the family and commu- nity and church was summoned to participate in the process. Today the care of the dead body, formerly a ritual embraced by family and friends, is taken over by the funeral home, "somewhat like a hotel specializing in dead guests," Aries writes, and the dead are transformed by the mortician into the "almost living" (155). Children are likely to be insu- lated even from the deaths of parents and learn about death only from the make-believe of television violence. Stannard, in his own essay, "Death and the Puritan Child," de- scribes how the eighteenth-century child in America was warned very early that his chances of survival to adulthood were small and that his chances of damnation after death were large. Since fear of death for the very young of any period normally means fear of separation from par- ents, the threats of an eternity in hell served only to intensify intolerably the normal childhood anxiety. Cotton Mather, who believed of children that "they no sooner lisp than they ly," offered no relief. Nor did the Roman Catholic priests, with their softer traditions and the consoling rituals of confession and extreme unction.</page><page sequence="3">716 I FAWN M. BRODIE Stanley French examines the evolution of American cemetery ar- chitecture and planning, from the abandonment of the severe grave- stones decorated only by skulls, surrounding the village church, to the development of the specialized cemetery. His account of the fabulous Mt. Auburn, in Massachusetts, forerunner of California's much satirized Forest Lawn, is written without malice. The development of the park- like rural cemetery did serve, French believes, to lessen the terror of death. Other essays describe the development of consolatory death litera- ture. Lewis O. Saum, in "Death in Pre-Civil War America," notes that, despite attempts to elevate the American deathbed scene into a "holy dy- ing," a pervasive sense of caution and reality persisted. Most Americans thought of death as a release from pain and toil rather than as a certain journey into a well-blueprinted heaven. Ann Douglas describes the con- fusion in ideas of heaven among American millenarians, some of whom believed in the imminent coming of Christ, while others were uncertain whether His coming would precede or follow the legendary thousand years of peace. Most of them settled for a concept of a purified America, locus both of the millennium and the heavenly afterlife, with the Last Judgment notably forgotten. Of special merit in this excellent collection is Mary Ann Meyers' "Gates Ajar," which describes the ultimate in American fantasy heavens-the tri-layered celestial, terrestial, and telestial kingdom of the Mormons. Mormon resurrection is literal: "Bone will come to its bone and flesh and sinew will cover the skeleton" (II6). Man in death con- tinues on in "eternal progression," eventually becoming godlike, with dominion over a planet somewhere in the universe. Life among the Mormon god-citizens will be anthropomorphic, with continued sex and procreation. Death is simply "a kindly porter" who sets "the gates ajar." Elaborate displays of mourning are therefore considered inappropriate, and the Mormon denial of death is virtually total. Meyers does not de- scribe the Mormon temple rituals, where members assist the dead by performing proxy baptisms, marriages, and other "sealings," thus open- ing the gates for non-Mormons to enter the highest celestial kingdom. Joseph Smith's concept that the living can bring anyone who has died, including royalty, into the Mormon heaven, is the most audacious of all American contributions to the denial of death. Patricia Fernandez Kelly's "Death in Mexican Folk Culture" serves as a kind of counterpoint to the Mormon theme. Here is no cosmic fan- tasy but an earthbound response to death-a fascinating fusion of three cultures. We see the gentle Mayan concept of death and the terrible Aztec rituals of human sacrifice metamorphosed into the Spanish-Christian traditions imposed by European conquerors. The result is an essentially Christian amalgam, but one where the idea of the resurrection has virtually disappeared and where death remains the ultimate protagonist in countless folkloric festivities. The Aztecs built stone structures to ex- hibit the skulls of the sacrificed and taught that these dead had turned into</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS | 717 gods. The Mexicans today on All Souls' Day purchase exquisitely varied sculptures of skulls made in sugar. They are given as gifts and are meant to be eaten. There is no hiding of death. Every child sees death pro- cessions and the miniature skeletons made of cardboard, straw, and wood as well as sugar. Theirs is a kind of joyous and sometimes macabre con- frontation of death-a mocking of its terrible finality. One misses in this volume a look at how Americans treat their heroic dead. We have no Westminster Abbey, and only two presidents are buried at Arlington Cemetery. But Mt. Vernon, Monticello, Springfield, and Hyde Park are true American shrines. And the lines of people passing by the eternal flame at the grave of John F. Kennedy are as reverent pilgrims. Fawn M. Brodie University of California, Los Angeles The Evolution of a Tidewater Settlement System: All Hallow's Parish, Mary- land, 1650-1783. By Carville Earle (Chicago, The Department of Geog- raphy, The University of Chicago, 1975) 239 pp. $6.0o Travelers to the colonial Chesapeake were often dismayed by what they saw: a single-crop economy, planters living on isolated farms, virtually non-existent towns, and a ravaged countryside. Many historians follow- ing the lead of these observers have concluded that the settlement of the Chesapeake was haphazard. Earle takes exception to this traditional view. With a geographer's insight he chose to reexamine the issue in All Hallow's Parish, a small area of western shore Maryland. He persua- sively demonstrates that All Hallow's had a settlement system which op- erated successfully throughout the colonial period. A settlement system for Earle is an outgrowth of a larger social and economic context which in turn forces change upon the system. Thus he begins by identifying the two main contextual forces operating in All Hallow's. The first was the tobacco economy. By carefully constructing a farm price series, Earle traces not only the erratic long-run trend of the economy but also, more importantly, uncovers its cyclical nature. In his judgment the rhythm of boom-bust was the main economic factor with which the settlement system had to contend. Population growth was the second major shaping force. Although forced to rely primarily on esti- mates, Earle asserts that, because white and black immigration slackened after I7IO and because natural increase was tempered by white out- migration, All Hallow's grew slowly. Despite the methodological dif- ficulties which weaken his precise findings, his main point seems certain: at all times during the colonial period the man-land ratio remained favor- able in All Hallow's.</page></plain_text>
