<plain_text><page sequence="1">Man's Measure: A Study of the Greek Image of Man from Homer to Sopho- cles. By Laszlo Vers√©nyi. Albany: State University of New York Press, 1974. Pp. xiii plus 274. $10.00. Supported by deep and broad clas- sical scholarship, this work is far more than a meticulous "study of the Greek image of man from Homer to Sopho- cles." It contains many valuable in- sights into literary criticism and the form and structure of a variety of clas- sics, philosophical and psychological interpretations, and abundant com- ments on the drama in its several forms. It is comprehensive in its sweep of a great corpus of dramatic productions, but it does not include any references to the influence of the cult of Isis, to the mystery cults, or to anthropology and sociology, although there are impor- tant correlations with such books as R. E. Witt's Isis in the Graeco-Roman World and John Ferguson's The Reli- gions of the Roman Empire (see The Classical Outlook XLIX, Dec. 1971, p. 45, and March 1972, p. 81). Over the years the image of man was developed out of basic concepts by great writers who dealt with ecstatic and emotional elements as well as those which pondered the nature of man and the world. Anthropomorphic elements were many at first, and the gods di- rected the destinies of man. In the liter- ature of those early days humanistic elements increased and man saw him- self more and more responsible for his own destiny. A philosophy of death and a concept of justice were worked out as man had to deal with the myriad trage- dies and sufferings of life. Time and death came to be seen in different ways as man moved from mythos to logos. In the time of Solon emphasis to a great degree shifted to socio-economic and political concerns; thinkers began to consider the role man plays in creat- ing and sustaining a social order. With Dionysus man entered a time of uncon- trolled emotional expression: the en- theoi were those "full of God." The Greek theater, too, developed out of the early cults, and tragedy emerged from the dithyramb. Man must be both mask and divine. Many of the concepts developed by the early Greek dramatists show strong affinities with Biblical principles and ideas. Throughout, their plays deal with crucial ideas about man's nature, his relation to the gods, and the prob- lems and conflicts that are rooted in the ideas of justice, honor, and the like. No short review can possibly do jus- tice to the many solid and relevant prin- ciples and relationships unfolded in this book. They richly embellish and improve man's image and that of the world as he sees it. - Richard K. Morton Jacksonville, Fla.</page></plain_text>
