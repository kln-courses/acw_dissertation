<plain_text><page sequence="1">26 Information wanted The two photographs seen here show the stucco rendition of the torso of a young Maya male wearing an elabórate headdress and earrings. What is preserved of the body indicates a simply-clad individual. The eyes are incised with fine lines which contrast with the rest of the face, which is only slightly modelled. In its présent form the sculpture is some 70 cm high and worked in stucco around a nucleus of the same material. This anthropomorphic sculpture was confiscated around 1987 by West German customs agents at the Lörrach border crossing from Switzerland. Confiscated together with it was a brightly-painted mural that had been sawn into two squares, each measuring some 2.5 m by 2.5 m. While the mural can easily be identified as a crude fake that mixes traits and mo tifs from Cacaxtla and Bonampak, the stucco sculpture might well be an original, despite some unusual features. Both pièces are in provisional storage at the Museum für Völker kunde in Berlin. Readers with information or ideas concer ning the age, provenance and destination of either piece are asked to contact: Dr. Dieter Eisleb, Museum für Völkerkun de, Arnimallee 23, D-1000 Berlin 33, W. Germany. **% v^°</page></plain_text>
