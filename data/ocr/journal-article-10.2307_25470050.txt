<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Jewish Quarterly Review, Vol. 95, No. 2 (Spring 2005) 207-227 Roman Contexts in Jewish Texts: On Diatagma and Prostagma in Rabbinic Literature AMRAM TROPPER The thousands of Greek and Latin loanwords in rabbinic literature1 are of obvious interest to linguists, philologists, and lexicographers, for whom the meaning and etymology of words are primary concerns. Invest igating the nature and history of languages, these scholars seek to trace the process through which a Greek or Latin term was assimilated into a Hebrew or Aramaic-speaking setting. Historians and other readers of rabbinic texts, however, should also be interested in loanwords because their relevance may often extend far beyond questions of etymology and semantic range. A loanword may have been employed in a text not merely for its meaning but for a specific image or association which it brought to mind. By means of a loanword from Greek or Latin, the author of a rabbinic text may have alluded to a specific setting or institution well known to his audience but unfamiliar to the modern reader. As a result, the historian today may hope to enhance our understanding of many rab binic texts that use loanwords by interpreting these texts in the light of their loanwords' original contexts. In this essay, I discuss rabbinic texts that employ a loanword modeled either on the term ol?CTay^ia {diatagma) or JtQ?axayjia {prostagma). De pending on the Graeco-Roman literary context, diatagma is translated as ordinance or edict,2 and prostagma as ordinance, edict, precept, or com mandment.3 Though scholars have investigated the precise differences 1.

My goal here is to interpret the rabbinic use of these two loanwords in light of the nature of Roman edicts and their historical context within the Graeco-Roman world of antiquity. As one surveys the many rabbinic texts that employ the terms diatagma and prostagma,6 one immediately notices that the terms appear almost ex clusively in non-halakhic literary settings. Barring the single case dis cussed toward the end of this essay in which diatagma appears in a legal context, neither term is ever found in any halakhic discussion. It seems, therefore, that the terms were of no importance within halakhic dis course and indeed the terms never appear in the Mishnah, the Tosefta, or the Babylonian Talmud.7 In addition, since neither term appears 4.

Though Sperber never claims that his dictionary records an exhaustive list of citations for each and every word, I am unaware of any mention of diatagma or prostagma outside of the sources included in his entries. 7. This observation is in line with R. Katzoff's general observation that the vast majority of Greek and Latin legal terms in rabbinic literature "appear only in aggadic contexts, in parables and metaphors drawn from gentile life" (Katzoff, "Sperber's Dictionary of Greek and Latin Legal Terms in Rabbinic Litera ture?A Review Essay," JSJ 20 [1989]: 202). On the basis of this observation, Katzoff concluded that the rabbis display "a considerable familiarity with foreign</page><page sequence="3">ROMAN CONTEXTS IN JEWISH TEXTS -TROPPER 209 even in the aggadic portions of the Babylonian Talmud, it seems likely that these terms from Roman law were not particularly familiar or use ful to the rabbis of Sassanian Persia who lived outside the Roman Empire. Before discussing the role of diatagma and prostagma in rabbinic litera ture, a short overview of some fundamental features of the Roman edict is warranted. Broadly speaking, two groups of Roman officials could issue edicts, high magistrates and emperors. In Republican times, magis trates such as praetors, aediles, and provincial governors were empow ered to issue edicts of two kinds, edicto repentina and edicta perpetua.8 Edicto repentina were "ephemeral communications which applied only to the oc casion which had given rise to them."9 They "were proclamations in times of tumults, notices of games, public funerals, holidays, intercessions of the gods, levies of troops or ships, summary orders for the banishment of individuals or classes"10 and the like. In contrast, the edictum perpetuum, which was issued at the start of a magistrate's term of office and was only valid during the course of his term, recorded the legal procedures the magistrate intended to follow in his judicial activity." Over time, edicta perpetua underwent a process of standardization, and Hadrian commis sioned Salvius Julianus to give the praetor's edictum perpetuum its defini tive and final form. Like high magistrates, the emperor also issued edicts though never the edictum perpetuum.12 Rather, the imperial edict, like the decree and the letter, was a form of the constitute princip'is by which the emperor commu nicated his will to the people.13 Imperial edicts could give instructions law but very little acceptance of it" (ibid., 203).

Diatagma and prostagma in rabbinic texts seem to denote specific commands or prohibitions rather than the procedural and jurisdictional regulations of the edictum perpetuum. Although rabbinic texts do not always attribute edicts to specific officials, the edict is generally portrayed as issuing from an individual of great political authority. In cases where edicts are linked to a specific ruler, one finds that edicts are attributed to Darius and Ahasuerus, who functioned as the Persian equivalents to Roman emperors,19 to Joseph, who served as the Egyptian vizier,20 and to Joshua.21 Moreover, rabbinic texts attribute edicts to the 14.

The midrash relates that prior to taking possession of the land of Israel, Joshua sent three prostagmata to the inhabitants of the land offering them three choices. "He who wants to evacuate</page><page sequence="5">ROMAN CONTEXTS IN JEWISH TEXTS-TROPPER 211 generic king (or emperor) of king parables22 and to God, the king of kings.23 Thus the imperial edict as well as the edicts of important officials such as governors and prefects apparently helped create the wide seman tic and cultural setting for the words diatagma and prostagma, and in this manner influenced the meaning and use of these two loanwords in rab binic literature. In order to underscore the possible role of diatagma as an imperial edict, let us consider the following midrash. He who fatally strikes a man shall be put to death (Ex 21.12). Who (or what) caused him death? That he did not look in the Torah in which it should evacuate, and [he who wants] to make peace should make peace, and [he who wants] to wage war should do so." The midrash then reports that in response to Joshua's ultimatum, the Girgashi evacuated the land, the Givonim made peace, and thirty-one kings waged war and lost. The book of Joshua does not mention that Joshua sent any messages to the inhabitants of the Land of Canaan and it therefore seems likely that the biblical demand (recorded in Dt 20.10-12) to offer terms of peace prior to battle inspired this midrash. In addition, the use of the term prostagma may have evoked the Gentile context in order to translate a bibli cal idea into contemporary political language. In both the ancient Greek and Roman worlds, ambassadors were sent prior to any military engagement in order to state the just cause of the war, call the enemy to make amends, and, in the last resort, to declare war (Y. Garlan, War in the Ancient World: A Social HLitory, trans. J. Lloyd [London, 1975], 47-50). For the Greeks, "it was obligatory to send heralds to 'announce the war' " (Garlan, War in the Ancient World, 48) and Roman international law taught that "no war is just, unless it is entered upon after an official demand of satisfaction has been submitted and a formal declaration made" (Cicero, De Officiu 1.11.36, trans. W. Miller [London/Cambridge, 1947]. See also A. Watson, International Law in Archaic Rome [Baltimore and London, 1993], 20? 30). See also Josephus Antiquities 4.296; Philo De Specialibus Legibus 4.41.221, De Virtutibus 22.109 (see L. H.

Schechter [London, 1887], 23-24); ExR 30.5 {Exodus Rabbah in Midrash Rabbah [Vilna, 1887], 105), 30.16 (p. 108). Scholars have suggested that the king in rabbinic parables may refer to the emperor, a governor or various other impor tant Roman officials; see D. Stern, Parables in Midra&lt;ib: Narrative and Exege+iis in Rabbinic Literature (Cambridge, Mass., 1991), 19?21, and the references in nn. 30-33; I.

A mashal to a man who struck the icons of a king, and went up to the place of judgement. The king said, "did you not read in my diatagma that anyone24 who touches my icons is lost" (i.e., deserving of death) ? Why did you not have mercy on yourself? Thus if a man kills a person from Israel it is as if he removed icons of the king and he is judged and has no life (i.e. is punished with death) [for man was cre ated in the image of the angels of service].25 In the mashal (or parable) within this midrash, the king issues a diatagma which states that anyone who touches his "icons," i.e., the physical repre sentations of his image, is punishable by death. The king in the mashal must be the emperor because an edict of this sort could only come from the divine and supreme ruler of the Roman Empire (whose image was displayed throughout the empire).26 Thus this rabbinic parable clearly identifies the term diatagma as an imperial edict. Moreover, this mashal illustrates how a loanword may be introduced into a rabbinic text while entwined within a matrix of associations from its original context. The emperor of our mashal expects the defendant to have read his edict because edicts were posted in cities throughout the empire,27 and when the edict is broken, the defendant is tried in a typical Roman court-setting as he stands before a ?f]fta.28 24. Katzoff has noticed that the edicts composed by governors in Egypt "are addressed to the populace at large, and abound in general terms of reference such as 'let all', 'whoever', and 'no one'" (Katzoff, "Prefectural Edicts and Letters," 209). 25. ExR 30.16 (p. 108). The final phrase in this midrash is apparently a gloss appended by an individual who was afraid that the midrash might lead one to the anthropomorphic conclusion that God's physical form is reflected in the human form. 26. In political terms, the act of destroying the image of the emperor was considered rebellious (see Josephus Jewish War 2.194) and would have been classed as treason in certain periods. See O. F. Robinson, The Criminal Law of Ancient Rome (Baltimore, Md., 1995), 77-78. 27. The verb edicere in Latin means "to make known by public pronounce ment" (Berger, Encyclopedic Dictionary, 447) and the publication of edicts is dis cussed below in more detail. See also Katzoff, "Prefectural Edicts and Letters," 211. More generally, ignorance of the law was culpable in both civil and criminal Roman law. See Robinson, The Criminal Law of Ancient Rome, 16; J. A. Crook, Law and Life of Rome (London and Southampton, 1967; reprint, 1970), 81. 28. See S. Lieberman, "Roman Legal Institutions in Early Rabbinics and in the Acta Marryrum," Texts and Studies (New York, 1974), 69-71, Sperber, A Dictionary, 70?72. In addition, the punishment for transgression is typically in cluded within the edict (Katzoff, "Sources," 820).</page><page sequence="7">ROMAN CONTEXTS IN JEWISH TEXTS-TROPPER 213 Another feature of our midrash, which also reverberates in other rab binic texts, is the notion that Gods commandments are akin to imperial edicts. As the midrash progresses from mashal to nimshal (i.e., the para ble's interpretation), the emperor correlates to God and the diatagma cor relates to the Torah s prohibition of murder. Thus our midrash portrays God as the ultimate emperor and the mitzvot (i.e., the divine command ments) as his edicts. I turn now to examine some of the rabbinic texts that employ diatagma or prostagma in the hopes of demonstrating how the Roman setting can enhance our appreciation of these texts. PUBLICATION From the Tent of Meeting. R. Eleazar said, "Even though the Torah was given as a hedge to Israel from Sinai, they were not punished over it (for infringing its commands) until it was taught (or repeated) to them in the Tent of Meeting. A mashal to a diatagma that is written and sealed and enters a city, the inhabitants of the city are not punished over it until it is promulgated to them in a public place in the city. Thus even though the Torah was given to Israel from Sinai they were not punished over it until it was taught (or repeated) to them in the Tent of Meeting." As it is written: Till I brought him to my mother s house, To the chamber of her who conceived me (Song 3.4). To my mothers house, this is Sinai. To the chamber of her who conceived me, this is the Tent of Meeting, for from there Israel was commanded in instruction.29 In this midrash, R. Eleazar interprets the final words of the opening pas sage of Leviticus, "The Lord called to Moses and spoke to him from the Tent of Meeting, saying." R. Eleazar suggests that even though the Torah was already delivered to the Israelites on Mount Sinai (as narrated in Exodus), the Torah s laws were considered merely preventive measures following this initial reception. The Torah only became a binding legal code, R. Eleazar claims, after it was taught to the Israelites for a second time, in the Tent of Meeting.30 R. Eleazar then discusses the publication of the diatagma in a mashal ostensibly in order to illustrate the sensibility of his claim. Thus the parable explains that even though a written and 29. LevR 1.10 (pp. 24-25). See also SongR 2.4 (Song of Songs Rabbah in Mid rub Rabbah [Vilna, 1878], 28). 30. On the dislocation of laws from Sinai as portrayed in the Mekilta, see N. B. Dohrmann, "The Boundaries of the Law and the Problem of Jurisdication in an Early Palestinian Midrash," Rabbinic Law in its Roman and Near Eastern Con text, ed. C. Hezser (T?bingen, 2003), 83-103.</page><page sequence="8">214 JQR 95.2 (2005) sealed diatagma had "entered" a city, it did not become a binding edict, for which an infringement of its contents was punishable, until it was promulgated in a public place. In a similar manner, R. Eleazar concludes that the Torah was not binding until it too was promulgated in a public place, i.e., in the Tent of Meeting. R. Eleazar's words are then followed by an editorial addition (indicated by a switch in language to an Aramaic linking-phrase, "as it is written," [TfDf Kin Kin]), which is discussed below. The description of the diatagma in R. Eleazar's parable is true to life and reflects the actual nature of the diatagma. On a relatively trivial level, the midrash records that the diatagma was "written and sealed," and in deed Pliny the Elder records that imperial edicts were sealed with the emperor's own signet ring.31 Far more important, however, is S. Lieber man's observation that the description of the diatagma s promulgation re flects the actual practice in the Roman world in which a person was not held liable for transgressing an edict until it was published in a public place in his city.32 Since R. Eleazar essentially equates the procedure through which the Torah and imperial edicts were rendered binding, the rationale for the public promulgation of the edict presumably also serves as R. Eleazar s rationale for the publication of the Torah in the Tent of Meeting. As Greek and Latin sources attest, a central rationale underlying the public promulgation of the edict was to ensure that the edict should be known, and, as a result, people were not held accountable for transgressing an edict until the edict was easily accessible.53 Thus R. Eleazar apparently 31. See Pliny the Elder Natural History 37.4.10; Millar, The Emperor, 254. 32. See Lieberman, "Roman Legal Institutions," 62?66; idem, Hellenism in Jewish Palestine (New York, 1962), 200?2. In Hellenism in Jewish Palestine, Lieber man also discusses rabbinic sources that claim that "the gentiles were not punish able for the transgression of the Torah until it was inscribed on the stones by Joshua" (p. 201). On the nature of the promulgation of the edict, see F. F. von Schwind, Zur Frage der Publikation im r?mischen Recht mit Ausblicken in das altgrie chische undptolem?ische Rechtsgebiet (Munich, 1940), 90-92, 157-60. 33. See Josephus Antiquities 19.291; Schwind, Zur Frage, 90?92. C. William son has argued that the publication of Roman legal documents on bronze tablets was not simply a practical method of informing people of the law (and at times the tablets were even placed in locations from which they were virtually unreada ble) but rather a symbolic means of demonstrating imperial rule and the majesty of Roman law. C. Williamson, "Monuments of Bronze: Roman Legal Documents on Bronze Tablets," Classical Antujuity 6.1 (1987): 160-83. Though paper docu ments are far less impressive, perhaps their publication was also supposed to symbolize the majesty of imperial Rome.</page><page sequence="9">ROMAN CONTEXTS IN JEWISH TEXTS -TROPPER 215 believes that the Israelites were not responsible for observing the Torah until the Torah was officially published in the Tent of Meeting. This inter pretation of R. Eleazar's position is reinforced by the editorial comment appended to his words, which claims that while Mount Sinai is "my moth er's house" (perhaps referring to the birth and childhood of the nation),34 the Tent of Meeting is "the chamber of her who conceived me (TlTin)," that is, the place from where Israel was commanded in "instruction (nXTin). "35 An interesting feature of this appended midrash is that it appears else where in rabbinic literature36 but assumes a new meaning in our context. The notion that the Israelites were only punishable after the Torah was repeated in the Tent of Meeting is not the self-evident interpretation of the attached sentence. The added prooftext along with its midrashic inter pretation simply claim that the Jews were commanded in instruction from the Tent of Meeting. Divorced from any particular context, this sentence could mean that the law was taught or interpreted in the Tent of Meeting, or alternatively that the obligation for the Israelites to teach Torah law was originally formulated in the Tent of Meeing. However, it does not necessarily suggest that the Israelites were not obliged to ob 34. See SongR 8.2 (p. 77); PRK 1.2 (p. 3); 1.3 (p. 7). Isaac Gottlieb has pointed out to me that the first puka in PRK equates the Tent of Meeting with structures in the Song of Songs and offers a constant contrast to Sinai. In addi tion, the words "my mother," C^X) and "my nation" ("Oli?) are apparently em ployed in a wordplay that refers to Mount Sinai, the place where the nation was born. 35. Although the link between the Tent of Meeing and the teaching of the law is already made in Lev 1.1?2, perhaps the following passages from later on in Lev (10.8?11) strengthened the connection. [8] And the Lord spoke to Aaron, saying: [9] Drink no wine or other intoxi cant, you or your sons, when you enter the Tent of Meeting, that you may not die. This is a law for all time throughout the ages, [10] for you must distinguish between the sacred and the profane, and between the unclean and the clean, [11] and you must teach (mirf?*)) the Israelites all the laws which the Lord has imparted to them through Moses. If one links the commands in verses 10 and 11 to the contents of verse 9, then the teaching, nmn^, commanded in verse 11, is supposed to take place within the Tent of Meeting. In addition, perhaps the location of the Sanh?drin in the Temple precincts also reinforced the connection between the Tent of Meeting and teaching. 36. See MRS 15.2 {Mechilta de Rasbbi, ed. J. N.

Rather, this meaning becomes fixed to the appended sentence only once the sentence is juxtaposed to R. Eleazar's analysis. Since the appended sentence no longer maintains its original meaning within the context of our midrash, one may wonder what prompted the editor to attach this sentence to R. Eleazar's exposition. I would like to suggest that the editor's insertion was designed to rein force R. Eleazar's statement by embedding it within the rabbinic tradi tion. Troubled apparently by the repetition of laws in Leviticus that, according to rabbinic thinking, were already delivered on Mount Sinai, R. Eleazar employs the publication of the diatagma as a metaphor in order to explain the need for this repetition. R. Eleazar, however, offers no biblical or rabbinic precedent for his idea and the only source for his distinction between the giving and the promulgation of the law is the Roman edict. In other words, what R. Eleazar presents as comparative law is in fact the projection of a Roman practice onto the ancient Jewish setting. Perhaps in reaction to the foreign origin of R. Eleazar's metaphor, the editor of Leviticus Rabbah added a prooftext with a short midrashic interpretation precisely in order to demonstrate that R. Eleazar's distinc tion is also well rooted in Jewish sources. The appended midrash pur ports to derive R. Eleazar's idea from a biblical passage and thereby implies that R. Eleazar himself merely illuminated biblical history by means of a comparison to Roman law. In addition, by juxtaposing the appended midrash to R. Eleazar's words, the editor imbued the appended midrash with new meaning and thereby transformed the Roman distinc tion between issuing and promulgation into a Jewish concept. Thus, in this text, diatagma introduces into the biblical setting a Roman legal prac tice that is then fully assimilated into the Jewish context by means of an appended midrash. THE SHEMA* AS AN EDICT As noted above, the promulgation of an edict in a city's public space was legally significant because it transformed the edict into a binding law. From a social perspective, this promulgation bore important ramifications for the inhabitants of a city since an edict could potentially introduce radical new realities into their lives. As a result, the formal act of display ing and reading out a new edict was apparently an important event in the life of a city and, as Lieberman has demonstrated, events of this type are reflected in both rabbinic and Christian texts.37 At times, the initial dis 37. See Lieberman, "Roman Legal Institutions," 62?66.</page><page sequence="11">ROMAN CONTEXTS IN JEWISH TEXTS - TROPPER 217 play and concurrent reading of the edict was attended with awe, fear, trembling, and sweat38 while at other times, angry inhabitants might rip up and burn an edict when it arrived in their city.39 In any event, the posting and reading of an edict was a prominent and well-attended event in the life of a city under Rome. In light of the nature of the promulgation of the edict and the public response to the edict, let us consider two midrashim. The first of these midrashim appears in Sifre Deuteronomy 33 (p. 59) and interprets Dt 6.6. With which I charge you this day. Let them not be in your eyes as an old diatagma which no one respects, but as a new diatagma which everyone runs to read. 38. See John Chrysostom, Horn. Min Gen.; SifreDt 33 (p. 59); PRK 12.5 (pp. 206-7); PRK 9.5 (p. 155); LevR 27.6 (p. 637); Tanh Emor 10 (p. 38). Not only were edicts greeted with fear but at times people complained about the daily promulgations of the edict. Thus one reads in PR 33 (Pesikta Rabbati, ed. M. Friedmann [Vienna, 1880], 151) a complaint about the daily promulgation of an edict just as one encounters a similar complaint in Tertullian (Apolog?ticas 4.7). Edicts, however, were not promulgated daily and these texts are probably exag gerating for rhetorical purposes. In addition, since the issuing of an imperial edict was a relatively rare occurrence, the edict's promulgation would probably have been an unusual and major event. On these issues see Millar, The Emperor, 253. 39. See Lactantius, De mortubus persecutorum 13; GenR41 (42).3 (pp. 402-3). Ripping up an edict was a punishable offense under Roman law. See Digest 1.2, and for a similar notion in Greek law, see R. Meiggs and D. Lewis, A Selection of Greek Historical Inscript'um+i to the end of the Fifth Century B.C. (Oxford, 1969), 31 33. For parallels in monumental inscriptions of the ancient Near East, see W. W. Hallo, ed., The Context of Scripture (Leiden, 2000), 2:148. In light of the punish ment for destroying an edict, consider TanhB Ekev 11 (p. 105): That you smashed (Dt 10.2) . . . Why did he (Moses) smash them (the tablets)? Because the letters flew off from them and therefore he smashed them. This may be likened to a mashal of a mail-carrier who was traveling with decrees (jrQO?Tayia: Sperber, A Dictionary, p. 156) in his hand to bring into the city, and he crossed through a river and the documents fell into the water and the letters were erased. What did that mail-carrier do? He ripped them up as it is written: ?saw how you had sinned against the Lord your God (Dt 9.16). What did he (Moses) see? He saw the letters that flew off and he too smashed them (the tablets) as it is written: that you smashed. This midrash explicates that just as a courier would not dare to rip up an edict unless the edict was already ruined, so too Moses would not have dared break the tablets unless they too had already been ruined. In this manner, the midrash apparently absolves Moses of any wrongdoing when he broke the two tablets.</page><page sequence="12">218 JQR 95.2 (2005) This midrash focuses on the word DTTI, "this day," and apparently inter prets it to mean each and every day.40 Through a mashal, the midrash teaches that one should regard the Torah that God taught the Israelites on Mount Sinai as if it were brand new and taught just today. The mashal employed in the midrash distinguishes between an old edict and a new edict and the midrash clearly states that the old edict, in contrast to the new edict, is no longer respected. The reason for this disrespect, however, is presupposed rather than explained, and I would like to suggest some possible scenarios in which an old edict would no longer command high regard among imperial subjects. Perhaps the old edict, though still techni cally valid, is not respected since it was designed for a set of circum stances that no longer endures, or since contemporary leaders, who do not care for the edict's dictates, choose not to enforce it.41 Or perhaps the edict is no longer considered a shock to people's lives because the dictates of the edict became a legal and cultural norm long ago.42 If the latter of these scenarios is the correct one, then it would appear that the message implied by the mashal fits the rabbinic mind very well. According to this rationale, the midrash relates to the concern that Jews will simply treat Torah law as a traditional way of life, and in their non chalance they will lack the excitement and heedfulness that surround new commands such as new edicts. Therefore, the midrash suggests that the Torah should be likened to a new edict that everyone rushes to read, rather than to an old edict that long ago became second nature to the inhabitants of the empire. The passage interpreted in this midrash not only appears in the instruc tion God commanded Moses on Mount Sinai (as described in Deuteron omy) but it is also the third verse in the Shenui . Thus the interpretation that compares "these instructions with which I charge you this day" to the edict may also be linking the Shenui to the Roman edict. The possibil ity that this midrash links the Shemac to the edict gains further credence in light of the following midrash, which explicitly compares the Shemac to the Roman edict. 40. This idea is developed further in some very similar texts. See PRK 12 Bahodesh ha-sheluhi E&gt; (pp. 206-7), 12.12 (p. 213), 12.21 (p. 219); bBer 63b. 4L Cf. H. Bietenhard, Sifre Deuteronomium (Bern, 1984), 88, n. 3. He notes that edicts are forgotten over time "wenn sie nicht immer wieder bekannt gem acht und eingesch?rft werden." 42. Another possibility is that an old edict's author died and his death de prived the edict of its binding nature. This midrash, however, offers no hint for this particular interpretation though there is a reference to this phenomenon in the Babylonian Talmud (see R. Katzoff, "Roman Edicts and Ta^anit 29A," Classi cal Philology %% [1993]: 141-44).</page><page sequence="13">ROMAN CONTEXTS IN JEWISH TEXTS -TROPPER 219 R. Isaac said, "(A mashal) to a king who sent his prostagma45 to a city. What did the inhabitants of the city do? They stood on their feet and uncovered their heads and read it in awe and in fear, in trembling and in sweat.44 Thus said the Holy One blessed is He to Israel, this recita tion of Shenui is my prostagma. I did not burden you and I did not say to you that you should read it standing on your feet or uncovering your heads, rather: when you lie down and when you get up (Dt 6.7). 45 On a fundamental level, the connection between the Shenui and the edict is sensible since the Shemac and the edict performed similar func tions in their respective worlds. While the edict was the quintessential command of the emperor (who was also considered a god),46 the Shenui was considered the quintessential demand of God, the highest king.47 However, I would like to suggest that there exists an additional dimen sion to this comparative relationship, which strengthens the bond be tween the Shenui and the edict. This additional dimension involves a comparison between the final words of the first paragraph of the Shenui and the nature of the publication of the Roman edict. Hear, O Israel! The Lord is our God, the Lord alone. You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might. Take to heart these instructions with which I charge you this day. Impress them upon your children. Recite them when you stay at home and when you are away, when you lie down and when you get up. Bind them as a sign on your hand and let them serve as a symbol on your forehead; inscribe them on the doorposts (mezuzot) of your house and on your gates.48 43. MS Paris 149 reads xascm. 44. The phrase "in awe and in fear, in trembling and in sweat" is often used in rabbinic literature to describe the state of the Israelites as they received the Torah at Mount Sinai (see, for example, bBer 22a; ARN I 1 [p. 1]; ARN I 6 [pp. 27-28]). The use of this phrase in the current context suggests that the reception of the edict is being compared to the reception of the Torah on Mount Sinai and implies (through the transitive principle) that the the articulation of Shema" is also akin to the experience at Sinai (see also Tanh Lekh Lekha 1 (p. 18)). 45. LevR 27.6 (p. 637). 46. The term prostagma is sometimes employed with the meaning "divine pre cept." See Lampe, A Patr?tie Greek Lexicon, 1182. 47. For the rabbis, the Shemac functioned as a declaration of allegiance and subservience. Its first paragraph involved "accepting the yoke of the kingship of Heaven" while its second paragraph involved "accepting the yoke of the com mandments" (mBer 2.2). 48. Dt 6.4-9.</page><page sequence="14">220 JQR 95.2 (2005) The final passage of this paragraph states that the words of God should be posted on the doorposts of Israelite homes and on the gates of the city, i.e., the central public areas of biblical times. Similar types of inscriptions are known from the ancient Near Eastern setting, and the biblical text apparently sought to use a familiar inscription practice in order to ensure that people were constantly aware of God's commandments.49 For the rabbis, I suggest, this final passage also struck a familiar chord; they were well acquainted with the contemporary Roman practice of posting edicts and they accordingly interpreted the posting described in the Shema" in line with the posting of the edict. The obvious similarities between the publication of the edict and the publication of the Shema" (described in Dt 6.9), established the grounds for a comparison. This comparison could be used to highlight a similarity between the Shenui and the edict as in the midrash from the Sifre, or, alternatively, the comparison could be used to underscore a difference as in the midrash from Leviticus Rabbah. In addition, perhaps the rabbis even imagined that their mezuzot50 (which contained the Shemac) were akin to Roman edicts even though the con tents of the mezuzot were not easily readable. Like the prominent posting of a Roman edict, the mezuzah may have served as a symbolic means of demonstrating divine rule and the majesty of God's law.51 THE CONTENTS OF EDICTS IN RABBINIC LITERATURE The contents of the edicts mentioned in rabbinic literature vary widely and some are highly imaginative. For example, Joseph issues rather un usual edicts in order to catch his brothers as they enter the land of Egypt,52 and God issues an edict to Noah to abstain from sexual relations for twelve months.53 However, other edicts are reminiscent of the types of commands that might have actually been issued in the Roman world. The edict discussed above, which prohibited touching the image of the emperor, is not unlike Gaius's prostagama that called for the introduction 49. See J. H. Tigay, The JPS Torah Commentary: Deuteronomy (Philadelphia and Jerusalem, 1996), 79, 443-44 50. The mitzvah to post mezuzot on doorposts was derived from Dt 6.4?9 (cited above). 51. See n. 33 above. 52. See TanhB Afi-keb 17 (p. 202); Yelamednu Mi-ketz in Arueh, 3:37a-b. 53. See TanhB Noah, 17 (p. 42) according to MS Vatican 34; Sperber, A Dic tionary, 158. In a number of rabbinic texts that employ one of our two loanwords, the contents of the edict are not even mentioned. In these cases, the rabbis appar ently hoped to illustrate some aspect of rabbinic thinking by means of a character istic trait of the edict that was independent of any particular content. (See SifreDt 33 [p. 59]; PRK 12:5 [pp. 206-7]; LevR 1.10 [pp. 24-25]; ExR 30.5 [p. 105].)</page><page sequence="15">ROMAN CONTEXTS IN JEWISH TEXTS-TROPPER 221 of his icons into Jerusalem.54 In addition, the following two texts include elements that seem to reflect actual features of the edict. 1 : All nations compassed me about; but in the name of the Lord will I destroy them (Ps 118.10). Gog and Magog will come three times against Israel and ascend three times against Jerusalem, even as Sennacherib as cended three times against the Land of Israel, and as Nebuchadnezzar ascended three times against Jerusalem. Or the first time the Psalmist says, All nations compassed me about . . . Of the second time the Psalmist says: they compassed me about yea, they compassed me about (Ps 118.11) . . . Of the third time, the Psalmist says, they compassed me about like bees (Ps 118.12)?that is, Gog and Magog will publish edicts55 and issue proclamations,56 as is said: Proclaim ye this among the nations, prepare war (Joel 4.9, and so on to the end of the chapter), but they will be crushed to dust. Hence the Psalmist says a third time, In the name of the Lord57 I will destroy them (Ps 118.12).58 2: Ben Azzai says, "Come and see the humility of the Holy One Blessed be He. A king of flesh and blood sends prostagmata into a city which say, "so and so comes," "so and so the E710LQXO?," "so and so the Y\y?\l(jjV;" after he mentions his name, he mentions his praise. Whereas God first mentions his [own] praise and afterwards mentions his name: "In the beginning, created God." Is anyone more humble than this?"59 In the first text, the purpose of the edict is to raise troops and, as men tioned above, the edict was one of the legal mechanisms through which troops could be levied. Moreover, the rabbis were probably familiar with 54. See Josephus Jewish War 2.184?87. 55. Although the text reads rTPQ3 2T"I, it should be emended to read nvoSCDH (Sperber, A Dictionary, 80). 56. Aruch reads m^Tf X^IH1?, "to recruit troops," rather than mtTD ?TUl?f?, "to issue proclamations," but this reading is probably a learned emendation (Sperber, A Dictionary, 80-81). 57. Perhaps the phrase "in the name of the Lord" refers to the superscription in God's diatagma, which he will issue in response to the edicts of Gog and Magog. 58. MidPs 118.12 (Midraih Psalimi, ed. S. Buber [reprint, New York, 1947], 484?85). Translation according to W. G. Braude, The Midrash on Psalms (New Haven, Conn., 1959), 2:239-40. Sperber explains that "the exegesis is based on a play on D""n"D "like bees," vocalised ki-devorim, as though it were ki-devarim, like words, statements, commands" (A Dictionary, 80). 59. Tanh/fr Tusa 15 (p. 121).</page><page sequence="16">222 JQR 95.2 (2005) such edicts because from the time of Tiberius the provinces had become the chief source of recruits to the Roman army.60 In the second text, God's humility is emphasized via a comparison of the opening passage of Genesis to the standard way in which one cited an officials name and title. In contrast to the practice of Gentile kings who state an official's name before his illustrious title in their prostagmata, God first states his own praise and only then does he mention his name.61 Interestingly, papyri evidence of edicts issued by Egyptian prefects indi cates that the name-title order was the standard edictal formula from the second through the fourth centuries C.E.,62 and it therefore appears that the author of this midrash was familiar with the standard formula of the period. In short, though the rabbis felt free to imaginatively project their own ideas into the edict, at times the contents of the edicts in rabbinic literature reflect the actual state of affairs in Roman edicts. THE DIATAGMA IN AN HALAKHIC SETTING In only one instance does the term diatagma appear in an halakhic context and it is by no means immediately clear what legal institution is denoted by this term. The term appears in the seventh chapter of tractate Shevuot in the Jerusalem Talmud (38a) in a pericope relating to the following line in mShev 7.9: "And she who collects (her ketubah) not in the presence of her husband, may not collect without an oath." The discussion, which relates to this line, opens with the question: "And may one collect (a debt) from a man when not in his presence?" In other words, the Talmud questions how the Mishnah allows a woman to collect her ketubah from her husband when he is absent even though the general rule in loans is 60. See L. Keppie, The Making of the Roman Army: From Republic to Empire (New York 1984), 180-81; P. A. Brunt, "Conscription and Volunteering in the Roman Army," SCI 1 (1974): 93-94, 100-2, 113-14. 61. In contrast to the interpretation offered above, S. Berman translates as follows: "When a mortal king issues a proclamation in his dominion announcing that so-and-so is to be magistrate, another a prefect, and still another a general, he mentions his own name first and then his selections" (Midrash tanhuma yelammedenu [Hoboken, N. J., 1996], 593). According to Berman, the king first mentions his own name and then records the name of the official he is appointing, but I do not see how this interpretation of the mashal can have any bearing on the nimshal in which God's praise precedes God's own name. In addition, I am not convinced that the mashal necessarily describes the announcement of an offi cial appointment. 62. For example, an edict from 287 CE. opens as follows: MaQXO? M?tTlO? cPoi3(()O? 8Jia?&gt;X?? AiyuJlTOU X?yei (P.Oxy VI 888) See Katzoff's review of the relevant papyri in "Sources," 820.</page><page sequence="17">ROMAN CONTEXTS IN JEWISH TEXTS -TROPPER 223 that the debtor must be present when his debt is repaid. A short paren thetical debate ensues in which the Talmud attempts to imagine a situa tion in which the debtor could be benefited by having his debt repaid even in his absence. Then the Talmud returns to the issue of how a loan may be collected in the absence of the debtor by presenting the following discussion on the matter. Liksa said before Rabbi Mana: "We do much better than you. We send diatagmata ("pnftr?D?CT); if he [the debtor] comes ?good, and if he does not come, we confiscate his belongings." He (Rabbi Mana) said to him: "We also do so. We announce [for] thirty days. If he comes?good, and if not?we confiscate his belong ings." He (Liksa) said to him, "Suppose that he is in a distant corner?" He said to him, "We send three letters; the first within thirty days, and the second within thirty days and the third within thirty days. If he comes ?good, and if not, we confiscate his belongings." Rabbenu Hananel suggests that Liksa, i.e., Alex, was a Babylonian amora63 and R. Moses ben Simeon Margoliot even identifies this Alex with the R. Alex mentioned in the yKetubbot 29c.64 According to their interpretation, Alex came to R. Mana and told him that the custom in Babylonia of sending diatagmata to absent debtors is superior to the Pales tinian practice, because the diatagmata solve the problem created by the missing debtor. If the debtor appears in court because of the diatagmata then all is well because the court can then address him directly. Yet even if the debtor should not appear, Alex argues that the problem is solved because the diatagmata enable the court to confiscate the debtor's belong ings even in his absence. R. Mana responded that the Palestinian practice to make an announcement serves as a comparable measure. If the debtor appears in the Palestinian court within thirty days of this announcement he is judged, and if he fails to appear his property is confiscated. Alex then asked how R. Manas Palestinian practice resolves the case when the debtor is in a distant locale. R. Mana responded that three letters are sent, each giving a thirty-day grace period, so that by the end of approximately ninety days the debtor will have been granted sufficient time to appear in court. Without any excuses for his absence, the debtor's 63. See bKet 88a, Tosa fot lemma ve-Raba. 64. See yKet ad loe, Pene Moshe, lemma Liksa. The reference appears in the Jerusalem Talmud, not in the Babylonian Talmud as cited in Pene Moshe.</page><page sequence="18">224 JQR 95.2 (2005) properties may once again be confiscated should he fail to appear for his trial in court. The following problems, however, indicate that the interpretation of the pericope just presented is flawed. First of all, Alex is not the name of any known Babylonian amora,65 and as a Greek name it is more likely that the name belongs to an individual who lived within the Graeco Roman rather than the Persian environment. Second, the word diatagma does not appear in any other halakhic text and therefore it seems likely that this term was not a technical halakhic term. The term never appears within any context in the Babylonian Talmud and, moreover, when the Babylonian Talmud actually discusses the legal summons, it refers to a different procedure.66 Therefore, it seems surprising that a Babylonian amora would cite a Roman legal term that has no particular halakhic significance and does not reflect actual Babylonian practice. Third, if dia tagma is not being used here in a technical sense but is simply a synonym for a "letter,'' then R. Mana should have also employed the term diatagma, yet he does not. Instead, the pericope is strikingly consistent, and while Alex refers to diatagmata, R. Mana refers to announcements and letters. Thus it appears that diatagma is indeed being employed here in a technical legal sense, though not in a technical halakhic sense. And finally, accord ing to the interpretation that Alex is a Babylonian amora, the give and take of the pericope is faulty because the reader does not understand why Alex's hypothetical situation, in which the debtor is in a distant locale, does not pose any difficulties for his own Babylonian practice. Alex raises this hypothetical situation as a problem for R. Mana, and the assumption of the pericope is that this situation is easily accommodated within Alex's own legal framework. It therefore appears that diatagma is a technical term of some kind and both Alex and R. Mana recognized that diatagmata somehow resolve the problem of the distant debtor. In contrast to Rabbenu Hananel and R. Moses Margoliot, I would like to follow the lead of the R. David ben Naphtali Hirsch Fraenkel, who suggests that Alex is the name of a Gentile.67 If Alex were a Gentile then the pericope would not be attributing a Greek name to a Babylonian amora nor a Greek legal term to the Babylonian setting. Moreover, even though diatagma is not a technical halakhic term, the term may now be 65. In contrast to the understanding of R. Moses ben Simeon Margolit, I be lieve that the context in which R. Alex is mentioned in tractate Ketubbot most probably indicates that he was a Palestinian amora. 66. SeebBK112b-113a. 67. See yKet 9.8, Korban ha-cEdah lemma Aleksa.</page><page sequence="19">ROMAN CONTEXTS IN JEWISH TEXTS-TROPPER 225 understood as a technical legal term from the Roman world. Thus the only remaining step is to figure out what type ol diatagma is denoted in this pericope. In light of the role of diatagmata in this pericope, it is clear that the type of edict under discussion does not belong to any of the categories of edicts mentioned above. Instead, it appears that the diatagma here, which enables the court to confiscate the debtor's belongings, is a particular type of edictal summons known as the edict urn peremptorium.68 In early Roman law, the only way to summon a defendant to court was by means of a private summons.69 Eventually the Romans began to invest the private summons with official authority, and the different forms of an official summons (denuntiatio, lit te risf and edicto) were collectively known as evo catio.70 The edictum peremptorium was a written notice that was set up in public and served as the most official type of evocatui. In contrast to denun tiatio and litterui, it was apparently designed for situations in which the defendant could not be located.71 According to Ulpian, the edictum peremp torium was issued whenever the magistrate felt it appropriate though it seems that this particular summons was often issued only after three prior edictal summons had already failed. 2 Then, in the event that the defen dant failed to appear in court even after the edictum peremptorium (i.e., the final edictal summons), the court held contumacious proceedings and heard the case without the defendant. In theory the judge remained ob jective, but one may imagine that the defendant's absence must have weakened his chances of winning the suit.73 In light of the nature of the edictum peremptorium, the give and take of our pericope attains new clarity. When Alex addresses R. Mana and states that "our" method for dealing with a missing debtor is far superior to "your" practice, his method is the Roman method.74 Thus his diatag 68.

In theory, one could argue that Alex was not a gentile but simply a Jew with a common Gentile name. Indeed, as Roman citizens after the eonstitutio An toniniana of 212 CE., many Palestinian Jews may have chosen to bring their legal disputes before Roman courts of law (as Babatha already did in the second cen tury) and might therefore have been quite familiar with the Roman legal sum mons (see Johnston, Roman Law, 9?11). However, the stated contrast between</page><page sequence="20">226 JQR 95.2 (2005) mata are the series of edictal summons that culminate in the edictum per emptorium and his presentation of the two possible outcomes of this legal procedure is accurate. In the event that the defendant appears in court in the wake of the edictum peremptorium, his case is tried according to stan dard procedure and all is regular. Moreover, in the event that he fails to appear in court, the case is tried even in his absence, and since he will probably lose under such circumstances, it is most likely that his belong ings will then be confiscated. Rabbi Mana replies to Alex that halakhic recourse is to make a public announcement, and this reply prompts Alex to raise the hypothetical case in which the defendant is in a distant locale beyond the reach of the announcement. Alex's hypothetical case creates no problems for Roman law because the entire system of edictal summons was designed to deal specifically with this type of situation. The edictum peremptorium was an official public proclamation and therefore as far as Roman law was concerned, this edict served the defendant, wherever he might be, with the notice that his trial would take place on a certain date (with or without him). Rabbi Manas announcement, however, is not similarly empowered and therefore it only provides a solution on a local level. As a result, he has to describe the three-letter procedure in order to explain to Alex that Jewish law had also devised a means for dealing with the difficult situation of the missing debtor. In short, this pericope cannot be properly understood without some knowledge of the Roman legal setting and it even appears that the pericope has recorded a discussion between a Palestinian amora and a Gentile with knowledge of Roman law.75 Interestingly, our pericope also appears in tractate Ketubbot of the Je rusalem Talmud, but in that context the word jTlOr?D?CI (diatagmata) is replaced with the Hebrew term "plOTO ]*H, ("completed judgements").76 During the transmission of the Ketubbot version of our pericope, the "our" practice and "your" practice suggests that Alex and R. Mana belonged to separate and distinct communities and it seems unlikely that these terms would have been used to reflect the contrast between a rabbinic Jew and a non-rabbinic Jew. In addition, I wonder if Palestinian Jews would have identified so fully with the Roman legal system so as to call it their own. 75. It is possible that Alex was a jurist of Roman law but that is not necessarily the case since many citizens would have known the fundamentals and procedures of Roman law, See Crook, Law and Life of Rome, 7-\3, 33-35. For a recent over view of the comparative study of rabbinic and Roman law, see C. Hezser, "Intro duction," Rabbinic Law in its Roman and Near Eastern Context, ed. C. Hezser (T?bingen, 2003), 1-15. 76. See yKet 9.10, 33b. Sperber suggests that the double plural of diatagma, }TD3CDVf, was transformed into JHOS'ID yi {A Dictionary, 80).</page><page sequence="21">ROMAN CONTEXTS IN JEWISH TEXTS-TROPPER 227 Greek loanword was apparently not understood and therefore a Hebrew replacement, which looks similar to the Greek and was thought to fit the context, was introduced.77 However, according to this revised version of the pericope, there is simply no reason why the hypothetical case of the distant debtor poses a problem only for R. Mana and not for Alex. Thus the shift from "pnorCuiC"! to ]'Hft31Q "pi (and the consequent damage inflicted upon our pericope) demonstrates how in translating a loanword to an other language, a text may lose its coherence. CONCLUSION Except for the final example, the texts discussed above belong to the world of the aggadah. The last text is of an halakhic nature and it opens a window onto a cross-cultural dialogue in which a rabbi and a Gentile compared methods for summoning a defendant in rabbinic and Roman law. The aggadic texts neither presuppose nor refer to an intellectual interchange of this sort, but they nonetheless reveal a close familiarity with the contents, the publication, the reception, and the general percep tion of the Roman edict. Moreover, the terms diatagma and prostagma serve an important literary function in these texts because they open cre ative avenues for midrashic interpretation by accessing associations linked to these terms. The rabbis introduced the Roman edict into mid rash as a metaphor, and in this manner they transformed antiquities and rabbinic ideals into living realities by making them part of the legal-politi cal life of the times. 77. For R. Moses Margoliot, who was unaware that the diatagmata of our pericope refers to the edictum peremptorium, the two versions of the pericope are identical in meaning and the function of the "completed judgements" of Ketubbot is no different from that of the diatagmata in Shevuot (see Pene Moshe ad loe, lemma Anan be-Babel).</page></plain_text>
