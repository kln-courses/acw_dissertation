Among them are P. D. Hanson (1975), C. Stuhlmueller (1988), A. Laato (1992), and S. S. Tuell (2003). In this article we will examine some of the main arguments. It is our conclusion, based on a careful examination of the arguments, that only a few are valid. Yet we can show that both Haggai and Ezekiel share some prominent com ponents of their world views. Both seem to belong to a millennial movement (based on a anthropological definition); both based their concepts upon theocentricity, and both deal seri ously with the question of God's status. Their solutions are however quite different, due to their own experience and the difference in political and social situations. Keywords Ezekiel, Haggai, millennialism, theocentricity, God's status Modern biblical scholarship locates the biblical corpus between two poles? continuity vs. innovation. On the one hand, scholars seek the sources on which a particular biblical composition is based; on the other hand, they look for what is new in one work vis-?-vis earlier texts.1 In many cases the result is a sort of resonant harmony, the conclusion being that although the work in question was influenced by earlier writings, that influence generated new ideas and interpretations. Often, though, there is a disagreement about the validity of the case for influence or the case for innovation. TTie question of the relationship between Haggai and Zechariah (1-8) on the one hand, and Ezekiel, on the other, is an example of this: Is there any influence here? Is there innovation here? 1} The method that focuses on "innovation" vs. "routine" goes by the name of "Tradition His tory" or Traditionsgeschichtliche Studien. ?

Kasher I Vetus Testamentum 59 (2009) 556-582 557 The present article examines the arguments advanced in modern biblical scholarship about the affinities between Haggai and Ezekiel. Before examin ing the various arguments, it is appropriate to notice that recent scholars tend to yoke Haggai together with Zechariah 1-8, taking these ten chapters as a single composition or at least as the product of a single editor.2 As a corollary, the two prophets are treated as sharing a common worldview. A classic exam ple of this can be found in Eissfeldt's attribution to Haggai of certain ethical views that are in fact to be found only in Zechariah: The content of their prophecy reveals Zechariah and his contemporary Haggai as true successors of Ezekiel, who was active seventy years before them. Like him they [sic!] hold strongly to the demands of the older prophets for humility before God and strictly ethical behaviour, and begin the task, for which Ezekiel had sketched the outline, of building the new Temple and creating a new people.3 Similarly, Tollington considers Haggai to have been influenced by Ezekiel's vision of the temple: In reality it may have more to do with the linking together of Haggai and Zech ariah as a result of their common purpose in respect of the rebuilding of the temple and a belief that this implied that they were among the exiles in Babylon who were influenced by the temple theology of the Ezekiel tradition.4 Generalizations like this fail to do justice to Haggai and blur the ways in which he is unique and differs from his contemporary Zechariah. Not every one lumps these two prophets together, however, and some totally reject that approach.5 I myself hold to the view that the two prophets differ on certain key issues; consequently it is appropriate to study the relationship between the books of Haggai and Ezekiel without reference to Zechariah. 2) Cf.

Kasher/Vetus Testamentum 59 (2009) 556-582 A study of the links between Haggai and Ezekiel and their books raises serious questions of methodology, research assumptions, and biblical exegesis. First of all, we must ask whether the book of Haggai is later than the book of Ezekiel, a question that requires a diachronic decision about how much of the material in Ezekiel antedates Haggai s period. Even if we accept the view of Gese6 and Zimmerli,7 according to which the book of Ezekiel is composed of original units ascribed to a prophet who lived in the Diaspora, expanded later by his disciples and others, there remains extensive material in the book that can be attributed to a prophet who was active among the exiles in Baby lon between 593 and 571 BCE. Another problem is that there are no quotations from the book of Ezekiel in the book of Haggai; neither are there any references or allusions. Nor does a lexical study of Haggai reveal any significant debt to Ezekiel.8 Because the brevity of the book of Haggai9 does not offer a broad enough canvas for detecting linguistic and stylistic parallels, scholars have proposed various ways for studying the relations between Haggai and Ezekiel. Some look for ideological, thematic, and social links, while other look for formal ties. I. The Arguments for Links between Haggai and Ezekiel The arguments for links between Haggai to Ezekiel can be divided into two categories: those that find ideological affinities, based on conceptual agree ment and common major themes, and those that find a formal link, based on manner more than on content. 1. Ideological Affinities One of the best known theses linking Haggai and Ezekiel is Hanson's, pre sented at length in his Dawn of Apocalyptic. In that book, based on prevail ing sociological theories, Hanson sketches a profile of Judahite society in the sixth and fifth centuries BCE, according to which both Ezekiel and Haggai 6) H.

Kasher I Vetus Testamentum 59 (2009) 556-582 559 were affiliated with the circle that supported the ruling social elite, namely, the priests of the house of Zadok. This group, which Hanson calls the "Hierocratic party", emerged from the Zadokites who controlled the Temple in Jerusalem before the destruction, led the exile community in Babylonia after that, and began to devise a plan for reconstruction when the exiles returned to Eretz Israel. The core of this plan was the restoration of the key pre-exilic institutions, namely, the Temple, the ritual, and the exclusive status of the Zadokite priests. Ezekiel, himself a priest, (though probably not a Zadokite), as well as a prophet, turned the Zadokite dream into a detailed program, presented in chapters 40-48 of his book.11 If Hanson views Ezekiel as the spiritual father and patron of the Zadokites,12 he considers Haggai (and Zechariah) to be a vigorous champion of this reconstruction plan, among its strongest supporters and implementers.13 Hanson's case for a com mon social and ideological background is based on a number of points of tangency between Ezekiel and Haggai: (1) the reconstruction of the Temple; (2) the restoration of the high priesthood, in the person of Joshua, and of the monarchy, in the person of Zerubbabel (Ezek. 34:23-24; 37:24-25; Hag. 1:1; 2:20-23); (3) the motif of the fertility of the soil (Ezek. 34:26-29; 40:1-12; Hag. 2:18-19); and (4) the full correspondence between the plans for the Temple presented in the book of Ezekiel and the Temple as it existed in the time of Zerubbabel.14 As for the Temple there is no doubt that the call to rebuild the Temple constitutes the major axis of Haggai s prophetic career (Hag. l:3ff.; 2: Iff.). On the surface this supports the argument that Haggai s goal was realization of Ezekiel's plan. We should note that Ezekiel never refers to the Temple as constructed by human beings,15 and it is quite unlikely that he thought it would be.16 Such a reading of Ezekiel leads to the conclusion that in fact n) Ibid., pp. 225-226; see also pp. 228-240. 12) Ibid., p. 233. 13) Ibid., pp. 174-176. 14) Ibid., pp. 247-248.

Kasher/Vetus Testamentum 59 (2009) 556-582 Haggai parts company with Ezekiel's vision precisely when he calls on the people to build the Temple themselves. As for Haggai's support for the high priest Joshua: if, as we assume, Eze kiel's reconstruction program eschews a high priesthood,17 then Haggai can not be described as following his lead in every respect. On the other hand, note that in the book of Haggai Joshua's status as high priest is far from clear. The references to him (1:1,12,14; 2:2) are in the editorial framework, and one may question whether they are a faithful reflection of Haggai's own views. Even if they are, it may be merely de facto recognition of his primacy, rather than de jure. On the other hand, Haggai's support for Zerubbabel (who, according to 1 Chron. 3:17-19, was a descendant of King Jehoiachin of Judah) is unmistakable and fully compatible with Ezekiel's program for reconstruction and his prophecies of redemption, which see the "prince" (frTUtt) as the exclusive leader (chapters 40-48). In the redemption prophecies (Ezek. 34:23-24; 37:24) this leader is said to be a scion of the house of David. What is more, both Ezekiel and Haggai see him as the "servant of the Lord" (Ezekiel, loc. cit.; Hag. 2:23). Hanson identifies another link between Haggai and Ezekiel?the fruitful ness of the land. Ezekiel prophesies about this (Ezek. 34:26-29), while Haggai associates the blessing of the land with the building of the Temple (Hag. 1:9-11; 2:6-9,18-19), echoing Ezek. 47:12.18 But this link between the two prophets is spurious. In chapter 34 Ezekiel does not tie the fertility of the land to the Temple, which is not even mentioned. Nor does he ever con dition the fruitfulness of the country on the behavior of the people in general or on the building of the Temple in particular. The mutual independence of the two is compatible with his overall notion of Israel's restoration in its land: this restoration is unconditional because its goal is to restore the reputation of the Lord, after it was profaned in the eyes of the nations (Ezek. 36:l6ff.). One of the goals of making the desert bloom is to enhance His status in Israel (Ezek. 34:30); hence it is unconditional. Ezekiel and Haggai seem to employ different motifs for the relationship between the Temple and the land. In chapter 34 Ezekiel sees the fruitfulness of the country as a sign of God's power (Ezek. 34:27,30);19 in chapter 47, the blossoming of the desolate 17) See R.

See M. Weinfeld, "Mesopotamian Apocalyptic Prophecies", Shna ton 3 (1978-1979), pp. 263-276 [Heb.].</page><page sequence="6">R. Kasher I Vetus Testamentum 59 (2009) 556-582 561 southeastern district is linked to ideas that associate the Temple with the Gar den of Eden.20 On the other hand, Haggai reflects the notion that laying the foundations of the Temple will bring plenty and fertility in and of itself.21 What is more, the promise of plenty to those who help lay the foundations of the Temple reflects a common biblical notion that human actions can influ ence nature, albeit indirectly.22 In light of this, Haggai's view that the eco nomic crisis will end only when the Temple is built is almost certainly incompatible with the core of Ezekiel's ideas. Hanson buttresses his argument with an article by Jeremias,23 who identi fies Ezekiel's Temple with Zerubbabel's. This conclusion is based on Josephus, who in his Contra Apionem (?198) quotes Hecataeus of Abdera (late fourth and early third centuries BCE). Even if we accept that Hecataeus' account refers to the Temple erected in the time of Zerubbabel, a meticulous exami nation of Ezekiel's blueprint uncovers significant discrepancies. For example, according to Josephus the inner courtyard measures 150 by 50 meters. According to Ezek. 40:47, however, it has an area of 100 square cubits, or approximately 50 by 50 meters. Josephus writes that this courtyard had two gates; but in Ezekiel's plan the inner court (as well as the outer court) has three gates (Ezek. 40:28-37). What is more, the dimensions of the altar are diff?rent: 20 square cubits by 10 cubits high, according to Hecataeus of Abdera; 20 (or perhaps only 18) square cubits by 11 cubits, according to Ezekiel (43T3-27).24 As can be seen, a close reading of the points common to Ezekiel and Haggai, according to Hanson, actually discloses the weakness of his case, even if we were to accept his sociological25 and historical26 postulates.

Later we shall suggest another pos sibility, which does propose links between Ezekiel and apocalypticism. Carroll Stuhlmueller, in his commentary on Haggai and Zechariah, fol lows Hansons path and associates Haggai and Ezekiel with the same theolog ical currents.27 Antti Laato, too, follows suit, adding a number of points to his predecessors' arguments.28 Both Stuhlmueller and Laato build on diverse categories of evidence?thematic, stylistic, and editorial?and fail to distin guish among them. Laato offers eight points of connection between the two prophets, as follows: 1. The method of dating prophecies. In both Ezekiel and Haggai prophe cies are dated by year, month, and day with reference to some key event: for Ezekiel, the exile of Jehoiachin; for Haggai, the reign of Dar ius I (Hag. 1:1; 2:1,10,20). 2. The positive attitude maintained towards those deported into exiles: Ezek. 11:14-17; 33:29; Hag. 1:12-13). 3. The motif of the "stirring up the spirit"(n/?z?): Ezek. 37:1-10; Hag. 1:14. 4. Rules of cultic cleanlines play an importatnt role in the proclamation: Ezek. 22:26; Hag. 2:10-14. 5. The motif that the "glory of YHWH" will fill the new Temple (Ezek. 43:1-5; Hag. 1:8), and that a marvelous future will be estab lished among the people through the reconstruction of the Temple (Ezekiel 40-48; Hag. 2:6-9). In addition, the promise of YHWH s pres ence in the midst of the restored community (Hag. 2:4) is reminiscent not only of priestly motif of God tabernacling among his people but also of Ezek. 37:27; 48:35. 6. The rebuilding of the Temple is a precondition for agricultural bless ings: Ezek. 34:25ff.; 37:15-28; Hag. 2:19. 7. The positive picture of Jekoniah's family corresponds well with the Ezekiel tradition: Ezek. 17:22-24; Hag. 2:23?in contrast to Jeremiah's disapproval: Jer. 22:24. 27) C.

The close ties between the Davidic dynasty and the Temple: the messi anic character of Ezekiel 1-39, and especially 37:27; the pro- nasi layer of chapters 40-48, with its similarity to Hag. 2:6ff and 2:2 Iff. At first glance, this is a formidable list of similarities between Haggai and Ezekiel. A closer look, though, casts serious doubt on whether Haggai is actu ally following in Ezekiel's footsteps in many of these points. Note, to begin with, that the first and third points refer to the editorial and frame stratum of Haggai, which Stuhlmueller,29 to whom Laato refers, accepts as a distinct stage in the composition of the book. This stratum may well reflect the theological outlook and historiosophy of the editor(s), which need not be the same as that of the prophet Haggai himself.30 In addition, a closer look at these points reveals significant differences between Ezekiel and Haggai. With regard to the dating of prophecies, in Ezekiel the reference is to the exile of king Jehoiachin of Judah (Ezek. 1:2 and 40:1) rather than to the regnal years of Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon (or the double system of dat ing found in several passages in Jeremiah [25:1; 32:1; see also 52:29-30]). By contrast, in Haggai the dates refer to the reign of a foreign king, namely, Darius I of Persia (1:1; 2:10); this system has no parallel elsewhere in the pro phetic corpus (besides Zech. 1-8). Let's examine, e.g. the motif of the "stirring up the spirit" (ruah), if any link between Ezekiel and Haggai is exceedingly tenuous. In Ezek. 37:1-10 the spirit is summoned to revive the dead (w. 5, 6, 9, 10). The Lord breathes His spirit into the dry bones as part of the process of resurrection, after which the prophet himself calls down the breath into them (w. 9-10). According to v. 14, which refers the parable of the dry bones to the exiles?"I will put My breath [or spirit, wind] into you and you shall live again"?the ruah in ques tion is the life-breath or the divine-breath, giving life to all creatures.31 On the other hand, the narrator or editor's comment in Haggai 1:14?"Then the Lord stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel... and the spirit of the high priest Joshua... and the spirit of all the rest of the people"?has nothing to do with a miraculous resurrection of the dead, but rather the commonplace of 29) Stuhlmueller, Rebuilding with Hope, pp. 14-15. 30) Many scholars have commented on possible discrepancies between Haggai s own remarks and the "editorial framework", especially Ackroyd and Mason. See P. R. Ackroyd, "Studies in the Book of Haggai", 2 (1951), pp. 163-176; 3 (1952), pp. 1-13; R. A. Mason, "The Pur pose of the 'Editorial Framework' of the Book of Haggai", VT27 (1977), pp. 413-421. 31) On "spirit/wind" in Ezekiel, see J. Robson, Word and Spirit in Ezekiel (New York?London, 2006); on spirit/wind in chapter 37, see ibid., pp. 224-241.</page><page sequence="9">564 R. Kasher I Vetus Testamentum 59 (2009) 556-582 stimulating living persons to do something. In Ezekiel the mah is equated with the spirit of the Lord; for Haggai, it is the spirit of human beings. For Ezekiel, mah means the vital force within human beings; for Haggai, it refers to human will, talent, and practical ability. The fact that the two prophets used the same word (especially such a multivocal word like mah) certainly does not indicate that they assigned it the same meaning. From issues that have to do with editing we move on to those that relate to the prophecies themselves. Take the second point, the favorable attitude towards the returnees: The assertion that Ezekiel 11 evinces a positive attitude toward the exile-returnees is simply wrong. First of all, Ezekiel's prophecies that predate the destruction of the Temple (chapters 1-24) are ambivalent about the inhabitants of Jerusalem. On the one hand he sees them as the "remnant of Israel" (Ezek. 9:8 and 11:13); on the other hand, he fiercely cas tigates the exiles for their inappropriate behavior.32 Even his prophecies of restoration see the returnees as a group that must radically alter its conduct.33 Furthermore, the assertion that Ezekiel 11:14-21 displays a sympathetic atti tude towards the exiles is mistaken. In fact, the passage is a reaction to the attempt by those remaining in Eretz Israel to deprive the exiles of their prop erty rights, based on the theological argument that the exiles have abandoned the Lord. As others have shown, though, this is more a prediction of the calamity that will befall those remaining in Judah (whether after the exile of Jehoiachin or after the destruction) than a discourse of comfort and redemp tion addressed to the exiles.34 The exiles who will return to their land are not viewed in a particularly favorable light, given that the prophet views the radi cal change in their character and behavior as a result, not of their own initia tive, but of divine intervention: "I will give them one heart and put a new spirit in them; I will remove the heart of stone from their bodies and give them a heart of flesh, that they may follow My laws and faithfully observe My rules" (w. 19-20a).35 With regard to Haggai, modern scholars debate whom he has in mind when he speaks of the "remnant of the people" (1:12,14):36 only those who 32) E.g., Ezek. 2-3; 14:6; 20:30ff.; 33:30-33. 33) E.g., Ezek. 36:25. 34) Cf.

Rom-Shiloni, "Ezekiel as the Voice of the Exiles and Constructor of Exilic Ideology", HUCA 76 (2005), pp. 1-45. 36) Note that this expression is found only in the narrative/editorial framework, and not in the prophecies themselves.</page><page sequence="10">R Kasher/Vetus Testamentum 59 (2009) 556-582 565 have returned from Babylon, or the entire population?both former exiles and those who never left the land.37 A review of Laato's other points of alleged similarity finds discrepancies, sometimes quite significant, between Haggai and Ezekiel. Let us consider them now one by one. Another problematic sample: the laws of ritual purity (point 4): Modern scholars disagree fiercely about the meaning of Haggai 2:10-14. Some read these verses as the prophets demand that the people purify themselves in order to pave the way for the presence of God; others see them as expressing Haggai's opposition to allowing those who remained in the land (the Samari tans?) to take part in the construction of the Temple, because they are con sidered to be impure.38 I tend to the second view; namely, that Haggai is asking the priests about the extent to which impurity and holiness can be transferred from one person to another. The prophets conclusion from the priests' answers is that holiness is not "infectious", but impurity is; conse quently those who are building the Temple must keep their distance from the Samaritans, who carry the "plague" of impurity. This interpretation of the passage in Haggai is compatible with a basic principle adhered to by Ezekiel, who would keep the aliens (the netinim?) away from the sacred precinct, because their presence profanes the holiness of the Temple (Ezek. 44:6-9). The idea that foreigners should be kept away from the Temple also underlies Haggai's reproof. But a closer look at the laws of holiness themselves uncovers an essential difference between Ezekiel and Haggai. According to Ezekiel, holiness can be passed to human beings through contact with priestly vestments (Ezek. 44:19) or with guilt and sin offerings (46:20). Haggai, who adapts the priests' ruling to his needs, seems to take issue with Ezekiel about sancta contamintion, which, he holds, applies only to food and not to human beings.39 Thus Eze kiel and Haggai reflect different priestly traditions of something holy to ren der something else holy via indirect touch. Laato's fifth point links the description of the "glory of the Lord" return ing to its place in the Temple (Ezek. 43:1-9) with Haggai 1:8: "Go up to the hills and get timber, and rebuild the House; then I will look on it with favor 37) For elucidation of this point, see at length Kessler, The Book ofHaggai, pp. 141-142. 38) For the range of opinion, see ibid., pp. 210-217. 39) This difference between Ezekiel and Haggai was noted at length by Milgrom: J. Milgrom, Leviticus 1-16 (AB; New York, 1991), pp. 443-456; see also L.-S. Tiemeyer, "The Question of Indirect Touch: Lam 4,14; Ezek 44,19 and Hag 2,12-13", Biblica 87 (2006), pp. 64-74.</page><page sequence="11">566 R. Kasher/Vetus Testamentum 59 (2009) 556-582 wkbdh [ketib: vJkbd\?said the Lord". Laato assumes that the verb wkbdh refers to a divine epiphany : "I will appear in My glory". Following this line, Risa Levitt Kohn and Rivka Moore translate/interpret the end of the verse in Haggai as "I might appear in glory", and conclude that "the prophets Haggai and Zechariah seem to mirror the view of their predecessor Ezekiel by reiter ating that God will return and inhabit a rebuilt temple".40 But a glance at dictionaries, translations, and modern commentaries reveals other possible understandings of the verb, both here and in other verses. For example, according to BDB, s.v. kbd41 in the nifal the root has the senses "1. be made heavy; be honoured; 2. get oneself glory (or honour)". It assigns the second sense to Exod. 14:4,17,18; Lev. 10:3; Isa. 26:15; Ezek. 28:22; 39:13; and?our verse?Haggai 1:8. On the other hand, according to HALOT, s.v. kbd nifal41 the meaning in all of these verses is "to appear in one's glory", with a note of the possible alternative meaning "to get honor". In TDOT, s.v. kbd40 the verses from Exodus, Leviticus, and Ezekiel (but not Haggai) are understood as follows: "Semantically, the passage in which the nifal conjugation appears with Yahweh as subject have a special position. Yah weh shows his 'weightiness' by demonstrating his power (to affect the course of history). The emphasis is on what Yahweh does to make himself known".44 It is no easy matter to decide among the different interpretations, with their different theological implications.

Even if we do not accept the proposed emendation, the other occurrences of 3 ('glory') in Haggai certainly reinforce the case that 1:8, too, does not refer to the "glory of the Lord", but rather to the glory and splendor and majesty of the Temple: "Who is there left among you who saw this House in its former splendor?" (2:3); "The glory of this latter House shall be greater than that of the former one" (2:9). Finally, according to 2:7-8, the Temple will be filled with glory in the sense of wealth or splendor?the treasures of the nations: "And the pre cious things of all the nations shall come [here], and I will fill this House with glory. Silver is Mine and gold is Mine?says the Lord of Hosts".46 We may conclude that Ezekiel's concept of the glory of the Lord is almost certainly not to be found in Haggai.47 As a matter of method, then, one can not take Ezekiel's theological notion of the Temple as the abode of God and automatically attribute it to Haggai.48 It is certainly possible that Haggai, too, viewed the Temple in this way, but there is no corroboration in the text. The only function specifically assigned to the Temple in the book of Haggai is that of "treasure house".49 45) . . Kaddari, Dictionary of Biblical Hebrew, (Ramat Gan, 2006), p. 486 [Heb.]. 46) This point is emphasized by D. J. A. Clines, "Haggai's Temple, Constructed, Deconstructed and Reconstructed", in: T. C. Eskenazi and K. H. Richards (eds.), Second Temple Studies: 2. Temple and Community in the Persian Period (JSOTSS 175; Sheffield, 1994), pp. 70-76. The version that is probably closest to the plain meaning of the text is that of the Good News Trans lation: "and the Temple will be filled with wealth". For this sense, cf. "the riches of nations shall flow to you... and I will add glory to My glorious House" (Isa. 60:5-7); and especially "the glory of Lebanon shall come to you, the cypress, the plane, and the pine, to beautify the place of my sanctuary; and I will make the place of my feet glorious" (Isa. 60:13 [RSV]). 47) Cf. . Talshir, The Book of Haggai (The World of the Hebrew Bible; Tel Aviv, 1999), p. 153 [Heb.]: "There is no way to know whether Haggai meant that the glory of the Lord was about to return to His abode; he seems to employ terms taken from this context, but is very cautious not to say anything explicit_On the overt level Haggai says only that when the Temple is built the Lord will have the honor that is due Him". 48) In contrast to Anderson, who maintains that Ezekiel and Haggai share an essential notion, because both of them speak of kavod and employ the verb rsh (Ezek. 40:27; Hag. 1:8); see Anderson, Sacrifice and Offerings in Ancient Israel, p. 99. In Haggai 1:8, however, rsh does not refer to sacrifices or to human beings but to the Temple itself ("I will look on it with favor"), a notion whose only parallel seems to be David's relationship with the Temple (1 Chron. 29:3). 49) On this aspect of the Temple and on other economic aspects associated with the Temple in ancient Israel, see at length .

Kasher /Vetus Testamentum 59 (2009) 556-582 Laato's sixth point assumes a link, in both Ezekiel and Haggai, between construction of the Temple and economic security. This assertion is true for Haggai?but not for Ezek. The vision of peace and prosperity in Ezek. 34:25ff. does not mention the Temple. As for Ezek. 37:15-28, its vision of political unity refers to God s sanctuary, but not to economic prosperity. Ezekiel and Haggai do seem to share a positive attitude toward the descen dants of Jehoiachin (Laato's seventh point). The texts from the Second Temple period report that Zerubbabel was Jehoiachin's grandson but do not agree as to the identity of his father?Shealtiel, Jehoiachin's oldest son (Ezra 3:2,8; Neh. 12:1; Hag. 1:1 et passim) or Pedaiah, his third son (1 Chron. 3:19). Haggai's concluding prophecy (2:20-23), which promises dominion to Zerubbabel,50 certainly reflects a favorable attitude towards Jehoiachin's grandson. It is possible that Haggai's support for Jehoiachin's descendants is influenced by Ezekiel's partiality towards them. From the alle gory of the two vultures (or eagles) and the vine (Ezekiel 17) we may con clude that the prophet envisioned the restoration of the monarchy through Jehoiachin, the captive in Babylon. The vehicle?"The great eagle... came to the Lebanon range and seized the top of the cedar" (v. 3)?is deciphered as referring to Jehoiachin's exile by Nebuchadnezzar II: "The king of Babylon came to Jerusalem, and carried away its king and its officers and brought them back with him to Babylon" (v. 12). The prophecy concludes with an expectation of the renewal of the monarchy: "Then I in turn will take and set [in the ground a slip] from the lofty top of the cedar; I will pluck a tender twig from the tip of its crown, and... I will plant it in Israel's lofty highlands (w. 22-23). In addition, the fact that the date of reference employed in Eze kiel is the exile of Jehoiachin (1:1-2; 40:1) may reflect that king's status for Ezekiel and/or the editor. If we add to this Ezekiel's strong disapproval of Zedekiah in particular (e.g., 12:1-14; 17:19-21; 19; 21:30) and of all those who remained in Jerusalem after the exile of Jehoiachin in general, and his preference, in the final analysis, for the exiles (e.g., 11:14-21; 33:23-29), it is clear that Ezekiel prefers Jehoiachin to Zedekiah and sees the former's descen dants as the legitimate heirs of the Davidic line. temples in Israel and the Ancient East, see K. van der Toorn, Family Religion in Babylonia, Syria and Israel (Studies in the History and Culture of the Ancient Near East 7; Leiden, 1996), p. 34, nn. 167-171. 50) For our purposes it makes no difference whether this is an actual promise of a crown. For the various opinions about the promise and an evaluation thereof, see at length W. H. Rose, Zemah and Zerubbabel: Messianic Expectations in the Early Postexilic Period (JSOTSS 304; Shef field, 2000), pp. 208-243.</page><page sequence="14">R. Kasher/Vetus Testamentum 59 (2009) 556-582 569 Laatos eighth and last point associates sovereignty and the Temple. This association clearly exists for Haggai and is expressed in various ways. One of them, noted by Laato, is the parallel between Haggai s prophecy Finally, Haggai urges Zerubbabel, the high priest, and the community at large to begin the (re) building of the Temple, which relates its splendor to cosmic changes?"I will shake the heavens and the earth, the sea and the dry land; I will shake all the nations" (2:6-7)?and his concluding prophecy, with its intimation that Zerubbabel will be king (v. 21-23), which also invokes cos mic changes in the very same terms: "I am going to shake the heavens and the earth. And I will overturn the thrones of kingdoms and destroy the might of the kingdoms of the nations" (w. 21-22). In addition, the last two proph ecies in the book?the former referring to the laying of the Temple founda tions (2:10-19), the latter promising dominion to Zerubbabel (w. 20-23)? were delivered by Haggai on the very same day. Finally, Haggai urges Zerubbabel, the high priest, and the community at large to begin the recon struction of the Temple (1:1-2; 2: Iff.), and they respond favorably (l:12ff.). Haggai s address to Zerubbabel links the scion of the house of David with the building of the Temple. But if the assertion that Haggai links Temple and monarchy is quite plausible, it is hard to find a similar association in Eze kiel. It is true that in the prophecy of restoration (Ezek. 37:15-28) the two elements?king/shepherd/prince from the house of David (w. 22, 24-25) and the Temple (w. 27-28)?are found together, and that there are detailed references to both the Temple and the prince in chapters 40-48.51 Ezekiel's future state has a monarchical regime, with the Temple at its center (48:1-29). The key question, however, is what bond the prophet imagines between the prince and the Temple. Here the picture seems to be fairly clear: Ezekiel would like to curtail the dependence between the two that existed in the First Temple period.52 That former situation, which is described in Ezek. 43:7-8, can be summed up as excessive physical proximity between the royal house and the Temple, defiling the sanctuary: It said to me: mortal, this is the place of My throne and the place for the soles of My feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the people Israel forever. The House of Israel and their kings must not again defile My holy name by their 51) In these chapters, nasi denotes a monarch with limited powers (whence the standard English translation "prince"). 52) See R.

When they placed their threshold next to My threshold and their doorposts next to My doorposts with only a wall between Me and them, they would defile My holy name by the abominations that they committed". (Ezek. 43:7-8) Now the Lord has resolved to remedy this situation: "Therefore, let them put their apostasy and the corpses of their kings far from Me, and I will dwell among them forever" (Ezek. 43:9). In the map of the new tribal allotments (chapters 45 and 48) the Temple is separate from the city, isolated from it by the L?vites precinct, which is 10,000 cubits (approximately five kilometers) wide.53 In addition, Ezekiel limits the prince's active participation in the rit ual (46:2), leaving him exclusively the role of a go-between who brings the people's offerings to the Temple (45:16-17). And unlike the situation that applied with the First Temple (which was also standard practice in the ancient East), the prophet neither instructs the prince to build the Temple nor ascribes its construction to him.54 Finally, whereas Ezekiel brings in the Tem ple at the end of the process of redemption (37:27-28, chapters 40-48 at the end of the book, following the chapters of restoration, 34-37), for Haggai the order is just the opposite: the construction of the Temple is the beginning of the redemption; only after it has been rebuilt will the Davidic kingdom be restored. This notion, unique to Haggai, which has been highlighted by Sarah Japhet and others,55 certainly reflects quite a different idea than can be found in the book of Ezekiel. In light of all this, it is extremely difficult to see Ezekiel's program as including a strong link between prince and Temple. On this point, Ezekiel and Haggai seem to be on quite different wavelengths. To sum up our discussion so far: Of the 13 ostensible links between Hag gai and Ezekiel, only few are truly plausible: both look favorably at exile returnees; both champion the line of Jehoiachin; and their books employ similar systems of dating. On every other point there are significant ideologi cal and theological discrepancies between the two prophets. 53) See R. Kasher, Ezekiel.

Formal Links In a recent article on the links between Haggai and Zechariah on the one hand and Ezekiel on the other,56 Steven Tuell considers four points: the cen trality of Temple and cult; the dating formulas; vision reports; and the use of the first person. Tuell's point of departure, a commonplace of modern biblical scholarship, is that Haggai and Zechariah were edited by the same person;57 hence he cites indifferently phenomena found in either book. Only his first two points are relevant to the question of links between Haggai and Ezekiel: the Temple and its ritual and dating formulas. From a methodologi cal perspective Tuell rightly distinguishes editorial issues from the content of the prophecy. With regard to dating formulas, he reaches the interesting con clusion that the formulas in Ezekiel differ from those in Haggai and Zecha riah. Ezekiel provides the dates himself; those in Haggai and Zechariah are to be attributed to the editor. They serve a more important function in the lat ter books, serving to divide Haggai-Zechariah into seven sections that reflect a sort of reversal of the distortion caused by the exile, which will be wiped out when the Temple is rebuilt.58 This distinction in the import of the dates in Ezekiel as against Haggai-Zechariah strikes me as somewhat artificial. It is quite plausible that the chronological references play the same function in both: forging a close link between the prophecy or vision and historical cir cumstances, based on an awareness of the historical context of the word of the Lord. Tuell also compares the status of the Temple and ritual in Ezekiel in the one hand with that in Haggai and Zechariah on the other. For our purpose we must note that he does not necessarily see Ezekiel as the source of Haggai's ideas, since ideas about the Temple are to be found not only in Eze kiel and not only in the biblical text.59 Tuell also remarks on differences in 56) S. S. Tuell, "Haggai-Zechariah: Prophecy after the Manner of Ezekiel", in: P. L. Redditi and A. Achart (eds.), Thematic Threads in the Book of the Twelve (BZAW 325; Berlin?New York, 2003), pp. 273-291. It is astonishing that of all the scholars who have addressed relationship between Haggai-Zechariah and Ezekiel, Tuell mentions only Hanson, while ignoring Laato and others. Even though Tuell refers to Peterson's commentary on Zechariah, he seems to have over looked the article in which he denies that there is any link between Zechariah and Ezekiel (which Laato, in turn, attacked). See D. L. Petersen, "Zechariah's Visions: A Theological Per spective", VT34 (1984), pp. 195-206. 57) Tuell, "Haggai-Zechariah", p. 274 n. 6. Nevertheless, Tuell does acknowledge that there are differences of content between the two prophets. On kavod, see p. 280. 58) Ibid., p. 282. 59) Ibid., p. 279.</page><page sequence="17">572 R.

Finally, Tuell observes that there is no high priest in Ezekiel 40-48.60 In light of this, one can certainly accept his conclusion: "In short, while tem ple, cult, and priesthood are shared interests of Ezekiel and Haggai-Zecha riah, the concrete expression of these ideas in Haggai-Zechariah does not derive from Ezekiel".61 3. The Absence of Certain Topics or Motifs in One Book or the Other As we saw above, in our discussion of the different senses of glory in Ezekiel and Haggai, the theological concept "glory of the Lord" is not to be found in the book of Haggai. Is this the only topic or motif found in Ezekiel but miss ing from Haggai, or vice versa? Clearly any study of the links between different works must address not only shared topics and motifs, but also the omission of key ideas in one of them. Tuell, in fact, notes two such topics: the fact that Haggai (and Zecha riah) do not refer to the statutes of Ezekiel 40-48 or the blueprint of the Temple in Ezekiel 40-42; and the absence of the expression "the Lord of Hosts" in Ezekiel, as opposed to its frequency in Haggai and Zechariah.62 Of course Haggai s failure to refer to Ezekiel's architectural plan and laws may not mean anything, since the crux of his message was to persuade the community and its leaders to start work on the Temple.63 Still, were the claim that he is the mouthpiece for Ezekiel's program true, we would expect to find some references to that plan. In their absence, we have grounds for asserting Haggai s independence of the book of Ezekiel. This independence stands out all the more in light of the fact that the phrase "the Lord of Hosts" does not appear in Ezekiel. This collocation has been studied frequently and in depth.64 A common scholarly conclusion is that it is associated with the "Zion tradi tion". Even though various traces of this tradition can be found in the book 60) Ibid., p. 280. 61) Ibid. 62&gt; Ibid. 63) In the present article we shall not delve into the relationship between Haggai and Ezra with regard to when construction of the Temple began. 64) See, e.g., T.

Several explanations have been offered for this. Baumg?rtel associates the phrase with the Holy Ark; with its disappearance, at end of the First Temple period, the phrase, too, fell out of use.66 Mettinger would explain its absence by the link in the Zion tradition between the phrase and the divine promise to protect Jerusalem?a promise that is negated by the main thread of Ezekiel's prophe cies even before the destruction of the Temple.67 Renz suggests that Ezekiel does not employ the phrase because it reflects the Lord's bond with Jerusa lem, and such a focus on the city might divert attention from the prophet's theocentric orientation.68 There is clearly something to be said for all these explanations. The fact that there is no Ark (not to mention other key cui tic objects) in Ezekiel's Temple does indicate that God has been detached from the Ark. Ezekiel's conspicuous theocentricity69 is an obstacle to his employing the epithet "Lord of Hosts"; instead, he frequently uses "the Lord God" {adonai YHWH), which emphasizes the dominion of God rather than his connection to a particular place.70 Ezekiel's failure to mention Jerusalem in the restoration chapters (33-39) and reconstruction program (chapters 40-48) is no accident; the odds are that Jerusalem does not figure in his plan at all. There are solid grounds for the notion that the city about which he prophesies (45:6; 48:15,30-35) is not Jerusalem, and that his Temple is not that on Zion, but located somewhere else (Shechem?).71 If the frequent use of the epithet "the Lord of Hosts" by the Second Temple prophets (Haggai, 14 times; Zechariah, 53 times; Malachi, 24 times) is inspired by their idea of 65) On the main elements of the Zion tradition, and especially its traces in the book of Ezekiel, see T.

Kasher / V?tus Testamentum 59 (2009) 556-582 the renewal of the Lord's connection with Jerusalem and its Temple,72 it is very difficult to see Haggai as a member of Ezekiel's circle. In addition to the two points mentioned by Tuell, there are several other topics mentioned by only one of the two prophets. We shall consider only two of them here. Haggai, in two of his prophecies, links the splendor of the Temple and peace in the land (2:6-9), as well as renewal of Davidic kingship (2:20-23), with a dramatic restructuring of the world (to be examined below). It is plau sible that this notion is linked in some way to the unrest and rebellions that beset the Persian Empire in the early years of Darius I.73 It cannot be ruled out that Haggai anticipated the fall of the empire and may even have called for a revolt aimed at reestablishing an independent kingdom of Judah.74 There do not seem to be any traces of such a political program in Ezekiel. The res toration chapters in that book do not link the re-establishment of Israel in its own land to international political changes, which cannot be found in chap ters 34-37. In contrast to Haggai's hints of revolution, Ezekiel does not seem to have prophesied the fall of Babylon or associated it with the restoration of Israel. Julie Galambush has recently proposed that the prophecy about Gog from the land of Magog (Ezekiel 38-39) refers to Nebuchadnezzar II and is to be read as a description of the situation before the prophecies of restora tion.75 Even if we accept the identification of Gog with Nebuchadnezzar II, as Julie Galambush has recently proposed, the placement of the Gog pericope after the chapters of redemption?in MT?indicates that it should be viewed as an account of events in the Land of Israel after the exiles' return there; this is how we should interpret Ezek. 38:8,11-12, which describe the returnees' life of peace and security.76 In other words, we are dealing with two very dif ferent political conceptions: Ezekiel envisions the restoration of Israel in its 72) See Zobel, s.v. sb'wt, p. 231. For another reason, see further below. 73) Determining Haggai's precise dates in terms of the regnal years of Darius I is quite a sepa rate issue. 74) For arguments in favor of this idea and its weaknesses, see at length Bedford, Temple Restora tion, pp. 230-237. 75) See J.

Kasher/Vetus Testamentum 59 (2009) 556-582 575 land, independent of any particular historical circumstances, because Israel's return to its land is an urgent need (Ezek. 36:6ff), whereas Haggai links the restoration of the people in its land to contemporary political events. Finally, note that the two prophets have different conceptions of govern ment. Given the absence of a high priest in Ezekiel, and the fact that the Zadokite priests wield only judicial, but not administrative and civil (as opposed to ritual) authority,77 Ezekiel's head of state may well be the nasi, who is a scion of the house of David (Ezek. 34:23-24; 37:24-25).78 On the other hand, the frame-editorial stratum of Haggai clearly refers to a diarchy, with authority divided between a civil leader (Zerubbabel) and a religious leader (the high priest Joshua).79'80 This form of government, unique to Hag gai and Zechariah,81 cannot be found in Ezekiel and is unlikely to have deep roots in the literature of the First Temple and exilic periods.82 II. Summary and Conclusions: Ezekiel and Haggai Share a Worldview but Disagree about its Realization Our consideration of the link between Haggai and Ezekiel has drawn on two different methods: a detailed examination of a series of topics discussed by both prophets; and scrutiny of important topics mentioned by only one of them. Our conclusion is that that the differences between the two are so sig nificant that we might well say they have quite different outlooks. Despite these differences, it nevertheless seems that the relationship between Haggai and Ezekiel can be perceived broadly as affiliation with a particular worldview and a common approach to a key theological problem. That it, they seem to share the conception of the world known as millennialism and to deal with the problem of the status of God in Israel (and the nations?). 77) See Ezek. 44:24. 78) On the status and (limited) authority of the nasi, see at length Kasher, "The Status and Function of the Ruler". For a different view, namely, that the nasi in Ezekiel is overshadowed by the priestly theocracy, see J. Becker, Messianic Expectation in the Old Testament (trans. D. E. Green; Philadelphia, 1980), pp. 50, 62-63. 79) On the problematic nature of the term "high priest" and the precise ritual status of the holder of that title, see Tollington, Tradition and Innovation, pp. 126-131. 80) See ibid., p. 180. 81) See ibid., p.

Kasher /Vetus Testamentum 59 (2009) 556-582 1. Millennialism as a Worldview Pace Hanson, who maintains that Ezekiel and Haggai belonged to the hiero cratic or theocratic stream and that the restoration program of Ezekiel 40-48 is intended to reconstitute the major institutions of Israel as they existed before the destruction of the Temple, we tend to the view that Ezekiel and Haggai in fact belonged to the millennial party.' Due to the fact that the terms like 'Apocalypticism' or Apocalyptic' have so different definitions,83 based upon various methods (literary, sociological, and conceptual), it is preferable to use an alternative term, clear and explicit, like 'Millennialism' / 'Millenarianism'. This term, based upon socio-anthro pological method, was defined by the sociologist Yonina Talmon as a term characterized movements which "expect imminent, total, ultimate, this worldly, collective salvation".84 The possibility of a connection between the book of Ezekiel and millennialism has been raised recently by Cook, who saw in the Gog pericope (Ezek. 38-39) an apocalyptic or proto-apocalyptic composition.85 I tend to the view that many passages in Ezekiel display a millennial bent.86 Ezekiel's prophecies of redemption (chapters 34-37) reflect imminence and radicalism. In the prophecy of the return from exile (Ezek. 36:16-38) the imminence derives from the fact that the exiles' return to the land is a pressing need, because their residence outside the land is a profanation of the divine name (w. 20-23); its radical nature is manifested in the fundamental change in the behavior of the people, with its denial of free will (w. 25-27; see also Ezek. 11:19-20). The language employed?"And I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit into you...; and I will put My spirit into you (w. 26-27)?has overtones of a new creation. The radicalism is also prominent in chapters 40-48, which present the dimensions of the Temple and its location in relation to the city, the laws governing conduct in the sacred precinct, the functions of the l?vites and priests, the allocation of the land to the tribes, and the functions of the prince. All of the topics that 83) On the state of current research and the problems in defining this phenomenon, see F. J.

Diverse groups and spaces are contrasted: Priests and L?vites, Israelites and foreigners, the sacred and the profane, the impure and the holy. One pole never trespasses on the domain of the other. What is more, chapters 40-48 are a sort of vision that passes before the prophet's mind's eye (Ezek. 40:1-2) and thus reflects, as Collins put it, a tran scendental reality.89 Nor are the secondary features noted by Cook peculiar to the Gog peri cope. For example, fatalism is at the very center of Ezekiel's historiosophy. In chapter 20 the prophet states that the decree of exile was issued while Israel was still wandering in the wilderness and that, to implement it, Israel was given bad laws so that Israel could be punished for violating them (w. 20-26). The prophecies of destruction (chapters 4-24) are for the most part anchored in a fatalism that holds that the decree of destruction cannot be revoked; accordingly the prophet hardly calls on the people to amend their ways (Ezek. 14:6; 18:30-31) and makes few attempts to avert the evil decree (Ezek. 9:8 and 11:13). Recently, Peter Bedford has asserted that Haggai (and Zechariah) are "mil lenarism [sic!] prophets".90 There is, in fact, no difficulty in locating various expressions of millennialism in the book of Haggai.91 First of all, his prophe cies aim at immediate fulfillment and do not address the far future.92 He 87) On the elements of the reform in Ezekiel 40-48, see, for example, R. Albertz, A History of Israelite Religion in the Old Testament Period (trans. J. Bowden; Louisville, 1994), Vol. 2, pp. 427-436. In my opinion, the reformist elements noted by Albertz are valid, although I can not accept his claim that chapters 40-48 reflect a composition that evolved during the first gen eration or two after Ezekiel himself. For the concept of restoration in these chapters and in the redemption chapters of the book of Ezekiel, see R. Kasher, Ezekiel, vol. 1, pp. 125-132. 88) Note that "dualism" has various and sundry meanings in the literature; but this is not the place to go into them. 89) See J. J.

Note that Bedford also sees Ezekiel 40-48 and Deu tero-Isaiah as millen?rist prophets, because they speak of changes in the destiny of Israel. See ibid., p. 264 n. 170. 91} Unlike Bedford, who associates some of these phrases with the ideology of Zion and the kingdom of the Lord. See ibid., pp. 237ff. 92) On this point, see, e.g., S. J.

Kasher/Vetus Testamentum 59 (2009) 556-582 states that 24 Kislev, the day on which the foundations of the Temple were laid (even before construction is complete!) marks the start of a new eco nomic era (2:18-19); very soon the Temple will be filled with the treasures of the nations and the splendor of the new Temple will exceed that of the first: "In just a little while longer... I will fill this House with glory.... The glory of this latter House shall be greater than that of the former one" (Hag. 2:6 9).93 The reconstruction of the Temple will be accompanied by shocks to the universe and to humankind: "I will shake the heavens and the earth, the sea and the dry land; I will shake all the nations" (w. 6-7). Similarly, the dra matic change in the status of Zerubbabel, who will be raised from a governor to a king, will also be accompanied by cosmic and geopolitical tremors: "Speak to Zerubbabel the governor of Judah: I am going to shake the heavens and the earth. And I will overturn the thrones of kingdoms and destroy the might of the kingdoms of the nations. I will overturn chariots and their drivers. Horses and their riders shall fall, each by the sword of his fellow" (w. 21-22).94 Furthermore, all of these shocks and tremors are the result of direct intervention by the Lord; and, according to v. 22, the result of this intervention incorporates elements of the day of the Lord: "each by the sword of his fellow".95 Another dramatic change: "in this place I will grant prosper ity" (=shalom) (2:9).96 2. The Theological Problem of the Status of God Both Ezekiel and Haggai deal with the sharp theological problem raised by the undermining of God's status in Israel. From the book of Ezekiel one can learn that the people s protracted exile threatens the prestige of the God of Israel, not only among the nations (e.g., Ezek. 36:20) but also among Israel. Those who remain behind in Judah after the exile of Jehoiachin assume that the Lord went into exile with the deportees and is no longer watching over events in Judah and Jerusalem (8:12 and 9:9); the exiles in Babylon are ready to abandon their God and worship foreign deities (20:32). Hence it is not astonishing the Ezekiel, more than any other prophet, repeatedly employs the 2:15, 18_The immediate future of Yahweh's effectual action... is forecast in 2:6-7 and 2:19b". See also ibid. p. 215-216, with regard to the prophecy about Zerubbabel, Hag. 2:20-23. 93) For the meaning of this term, see Kessler, The Book of Haggai, pp. 173-175. 94) Collins ("Introduction", pp. 77-78) believes that here Zerubbabel is viewed as ruler of the whole world. 95) Cf. Ezek. 38:21. 96) Cf. Ezek. 34:25 and 37:36.</page><page sequence="24">R. Kasher I Vetus Testamentum 59 (2009) 556-582 579 formula "that they may know that I am the Lord",97 by way of teaching that all His actions in the past, present, and immediate future reflect His might, despite the exile and destruction of the Temple. What is more, to demon strate that His power does not depend on the land and the Temple, God appears in His glory in Babylon, too, and speaks repeatedly to his messenger Ezekiel (1:3-2:16; 3:22-27; 8:l-3ff.; 11:25). The book of Haggai, too, attempts to cope with the problem of the status of God. Both the prophecies and the narrative-editorial framework attest to active divine intervention in various domains: it is God who has caused the severe economic hardship (1:11 and 2:17); it is God who stirred the people and its leaders to rebuild the Temple (1:14). Haggai's pledge in the name of God, "I am with you" (1:13 and 2:4), evidently addresses the people's skepti cism about God's presence and potency. Haggai views God as intervening on both the cosmic and the historical planes (2:6-7 and 21-23), thereby chal lenging the uncontested might of the Persian Empire and its deity. It is not impossible, then, that the demonstrative use of the term "the Lord of Hosts" is also associated with a tendency to magnify the power of the God of Israel. This epithet, whatever its precise meaning, certainly points to Lord's power and might.98 The many royal inscriptions and objets d'art produced for Persian kings, and especially Darius I, which preserve ancient Mesopotamian traditions,99 provide us with an insight into that monarch's royal and religious ideology. For example, the Behistun inscription refers 63 times to the chief deity of the Persian pantheon, Ahura-Mazda,100 as having supported Darius, brought him to the throne, and helped him overcome his enemies at home and abroad. In other inscriptions Darius refers to Ahura-Mazda as the creator of heaven, 97) On the implications of this formula in the Bible in general and in the book of Ezekiel in particular, see W. Zimmerli, "Knowledge of God according to the Book of Ezekiel", in: W. Zimmerli, I Am Yahweh (trans. D. W. Stott; ed. and introduction W. Brueggemann; Atlanta, 1982), pp. 29-98, 143-154; Joyce, Divine Initiative and Human Response. 98) On this aspect of the epithet, see at length S. Paas, Creation and Judgment.

Kasher/Vetus Testamentum 59 (2009) 556-582 earth, and human beings.101 Here we would like to advance the thesis that the book of Haggai is an (implicit) polemic against the implications of these inscriptions. Consider the following contrasts. Saith Darius the King: Ahura-Mazda, when he saw this earth in commotion, therefore bestowed it upon me, made me king_By the favor of Ahura-Mazda I put it down in its place. (DNa [=Naqs-i-Rustam A], lines 30-47)102 Whereas Haggai proclaims: For thus said the Lord of Hosts: In just a little while longer I will shake the heav ens and the earth, the sea and the dry land; I will shake all the nations_And in this place I will grant peace/prosperity (shalom)?declares the Lord of Hosts. (Hag. 2:6-9) I am going to shake the heavens and the earth. And I will overturn the thrones of kingdoms and destroy the might of the kingdoms of the nations. I will over turn chariots and their drivers. Horses and their riders shall fall, each by the sword of his fellow. On that day?declares the Lord of Hosts?I will take you, O My servant Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel?declares the Lord?and make you as a signet; for I have chosen you?declares the Lord of Hosts. (2:21-23) Another example: Saith Darius the King: Much which was ill-done, that I made good. Provinces were in commotion; one man was smiting the other. The following I brought about by the favor of Ahura-Mazda, that one does not smite the other at all, each one is in his place. (DSe [=Darius, Susa E])103 Which Haggai counters as follows: And I will overturn the thrones of kingdoms and destroy the might of the king doms of the nations_Horses and their riders shall fall, each by the sword of his fellow. (Hag. 2:22) Finally, in another inscription, Darius sees himself as chosen by Ahura-Mazda to reign over the entire earth: 101) E.g., Naqs-i-Rustam A, lines 1-8. See R. G. Kent (ed.), Old Persian: Grammen Texts, Lexi con (New Haven, 19532), pp. 137-138. 102) After Kent, Old Persian, p. 138. 103) After Kent, Old Persian, p. 142.</page><page sequence="26">R. Kasher / Vetus Testamentum 59 (2009) 556-582 581 Unto Ahura-Mazda thus was the desire: he chose me as (his) man in all the earth; he made me king in all the earth. (DSf [= Darius, Susa F])104 But Haggai proclaims the impending appointment of Zerubbabel as ruler of the whole world (?): I am going to shake the heavens and the earth. And I will overturn the thrones of kingdoms and destroy the might of the kingdoms of the nations_On that day... I will take you, O My servant Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel... and make you as a signet; for I have chosen you. (Hag. 2:21-23) These parallels may shed some new light on Haggai's worldview in its histori cal context. Clearly one can interpret various passages from Haggai in associ ation with some biblical tradition or other. But precisely the fact that here we are speaking about several passages, and not just one, strongly suggests that the echoes are not haphazard, but deliberate. Where Darius presents himself as the earthly representative of Ahura-Mazda, acting in his name and bring ing peace and tranquility to his kingdom, Haggai declares that the God of Israel is about to effect a major upheaval and appoint Zerubbabel as ruler; only after that "I will grant peace/prosperity". It is hard not to avoid seeing Haggai as challenging the subjects of the Persian Empire: the acts of the God of Israel will cancel out those performed by Darius in the name of Ahura Mazda. To this we may add two other points. First, as mentioned above, the God of Israel will restore His status in Israel when work begins on building the Temple: "I will be glorified" (1:8). Second, both Ezekiel and Haggai proclaim that God is to be found precisely among those who are skeptical about His presence and power. With regard to the exiles in Babylonia who would return to their homeland: Say then: Thus said the Lord God: I have indeed removed them far among the nations and have scattered them among the countries, and I have become to them a diminished S2svc?ty(miqdash meat) in the countries whither they have gone. (Ezek. 11:16)105 104) After Kent, Old Persian, p. 144. 105) On the implications of this verse, see at length M. Ben-Yashar, "The Merkava (Divine Chariot) and Mikdash Meat (Minor Sanctuary)".</page><page sequence="27">582 R Kasher/Vetus Testamentum 59 (2009) 556-582 And, with regard to those who have actually returned: "I am with you" (Hag. 1:13; 2:4). In light of all the above, we may argue that the prophets Ezekiel and Hag gai share a world view that foresees an immediate and radical deliverance; in addition, both of them deal with the theological problem of the status of the God of Israel. But each would realize this view in a different way. Ezekiel, who was active in the last years of the kingdom of Judah and the beginning of the exile, saw the very fact of exile as derogating from the honor and pres tige of the God of Israel. Consequently he considered redemption to be urgent need that must take place at once. Haggai, active during the return to Zion, sought to realize his millenarism in a different way. The construction of the Temple and enthronement of Zerubbabel, the descendant of the royal line of David, express an imminent eschatology that is to be realized here and now. Ezekiel, who witnessed the destruction and was disappointed that the people did not amend their ways, was moved to draw a detailed picture of the near future, including mechanisms to prevent another collapse and the profanation of the Lord s name. Haggai, living at the beginning of the resto ration, wanted to realize it speedily: hence he urged the people to fulfill their duty and build the Temple, while exploiting the unrest in the Persian empire and expecting its impending collapse, which would of course lead to the res toration of the monarchy in Judah. Ezekiel, despairing of individuals, makes the imminent restoration depend on God alone; Haggai, by contrast, includes the people in the process of redemption.106 Ezekiels ideology is radically theocentric; human beings are passive in the process of redemption and res toration. Haggai's theocentricity is more flexible and leaves room for human effort. Accordingly he makes demands on his hearers, hoping to spur them to take steps that will put an end the economic crisis besetting them. As such, he makes human beings responsible for resolving the crisis: laying the foun dation of the Temple is the start of the redemption. Here, then, we have an example of changes that can emerge in a single ideological movement, a diversity derived from the different personal back grounds of Ezekiel and Haggai and from the different political, economic, and social circumstances in which they lived. 106) Uffenheimer accurately described Haggai and Zechariah (chapters 1-8) as expressing "eschatological activism" or "historical activism", in the wake of Deutero-Isaiah. See B. Uffen heimer, "From the Prophetic Eschatology to Apocalypse", in: Z. Baras (ed.), Messianism and Eschatology (Jerusalem, 1983), pp. 65-66, 71 [Heb.].</page></plain_text>
