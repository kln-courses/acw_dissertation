<plain_text><page sequence="1">43 THE QUEEN UNDER ATTACK ? A REJOINDER By dominique collon The object once known as the Burney Relief, and now renamed The Queen of the Night (hereinafter referred to as the Queen) is a mould-made plaque of straw-tempered clay (Fig. 1). Integral with the rectangular background (49.5 x 37 cm) is a nude figure who wears the horned headdress of a Mesopotamian goddess, has lowered wings, dewclaws and bird's talons, holds the divine rod-and ring symbol in each hand, stands on the backs of two addorsed lions, and is flanked by large owls. Traces of black, red and white paint survive. Since it was first published in the Illustrated London News on 13 June 1936, the plaque has been hailed as a masterpiece of ancient Mesopotamian art generally dated to the Old Babylonian period and, more specifically, to the age of Hammurabi (reigned 1792-1750 bc according to the Middle Chronology). After more than seven decades in private ownership, the plaque finally came into the public domain when, in 2003, the British Museum celebrated its 250th anniversary with the acquisition of this iconic work.1 One would expect such a unique piece to have its detractors, and in 1936-7 Dietrich Opitz published an article in which he raised doubts about its authenticity, although Van Buren, in her article appended to his (1936-7), came out in favour of the plaque. Then "a seminal article by Henri Frankfort (1937-9)... caused Opitz (1937-9) to change his mind" (Curtis and Collon 1996: 91-2), and other major scholars have agreed with Frankfort, including Thorkild Jacobsen (1987). In 1970, Pauline Albenda published a short article that focused on two features of the plaque's iconography, namely the "ring and rod" (normally referred to as rod-and-ring) symbols held by the goddess, and the overlapping lions on which she stood. These led her to "conclude that the Burney relief is not genuine". In 2005, she revived the debate in an article in the Journal of the American Oriental Society. I shall consider in turn the various points she raises (giving the relevant page numbers in brackets) and seek to demonstrate why I think her arguments to be flawed and why I am convinced that the Queen of the Night is a genuine work of the age of Hammurabi of Babylon. Albenda's 2005 article was unable to take into account my booklet, The Queen of the Night, published in August 2005, and she was only able to refer to it in an Addendum on p. 190.2 It is unfortunate, however, that she did not know of the article by Curtis and Collon (1996), which would have answered some of her queries. Indeed, she deplores (pp. 173 and 171 respectively) the fact that Plenderleith's 1936 report and the 1975 thermoluminescence analysis have never been published, although in fact Curtis and Collon published them both in 1996.3 Throughout Albenda's article, the reader is left in doubt as to whether Albenda believes the plaque to be ancient or modern, and if ancient, whether she agrees with the "British Museum staff" who "currently ... assigns the date of the clay plaque between 1800 B.C. and 1750 B.C., to 1 The plaque bears the registration number BM ANE 2003-7-18, 1. The internet sites given by Albenda (2005) in footnotes 3 and 23 are now obsolete. She could have referred to less ephemeral publications such as the reports in the British Museum Magazine (Collon 2003 and 2004). 2 In her Addendum (p. 190), Albenda comments briefly on the British Museum booklet (Collon 2005) and shows surprise that the black pigment has now been identified as charcoal and soot rather than as bitumen (as in the 1930s analysis), and that the white pigment had not previously been noted (Collon 2005: 17): the plaque has certainly not been repainted, as Albenda "surmises". It was in 2004, in the context of preparing a digital reconstruction of the plaque's appearance when fully painted (see Collon 2005: 8 Fig. 2; N.B. the colour should be redder), that the traces of pigment were first examined; the analysis was undertaken in 2005 using Raman spec troscopy. The written report on the pigment (submitted on 25 August 2005 and therefore not available to me when the booklet went to press) describes the black pigment as "amorphous carbon, probably lamp black", the red is "red ochre" and the white is "pure clean gypsum". On the wing feathers the white is very faint, but is clearly different from those areas where paint is now missing completely; the white is particularly clear in the lines on the muzzles of the lions, where the sample was taken (see Collon 2005: 32 Fig. 12; the yellow used in the digital reconstruction is based on its presence on a terracotta god from Ur, still visible but impossible to sample ? see Collon 2005: 27 and cf. 12 Fig. 4). 3 Albenda 2005: 173 n. 6 cites a letter from John Curtis to Oscar White Muscarella, written in 1995, in which Curtis quotes Plenderleith's report verbatim. Unfortunately, because she omits the inverted commas around the citation, Plenderleith's report is erroneously attributed to Curtis!

She regrets that the plaque has no provenance, and here I wholeheartedly agree,4 but her statement that "there is the issue of whether one can legitimately date an unexcavated object to a specific time or historical period in antiquity" takes no account of the fact that field archaeologists, historians and art historians are constantly having to reassign excavated objects "to a specific time or historical period in antiquity". The code of Hammurabi (just referred to by Albenda on p. 171 in connection with the Queen plaque) is a case in point. If it had not been inscribed, would its discovery in a twelfth-century bc level at Susa in south western Iran have indicated that it had originally stood in a Babylonian city in the eighteenth century bc? Only stylistic analysis would have shown that this was indeed the case. On p. 173, Albenda comments regarding the hollowed eye sockets on a terracotta: "this feature is unique" but, as she states at the top of the same page, "the clay plaque is a unique work".5 In note 5, Albenda expresses concern that "at some time in more recent years, an examination showed that the head did not originally belong to the body", implying that the piece was a pastiche. She goes on to cite examples of "doubtful" heads that had passed through the hands of the same dealer, Sydney Burney.6 However, the text of the report of the British Museum's Department of Scientific Research of 31 July 2000 (summarised in Collon 2005: 13) describes the technique of manufacture as follows: The breaks in the plaque allow inspection of the interior giving some indication of how it may have been made. There appear to be distinct folds and fissures in the clay, suggesting that it was quite stiff when worked. From the lines of these folds and fissures in the body of the figure and chest, neck and head, it would seem likely that the whole plaque was moulded, clay being pushed into the figure with more clay added from behind to form the supporting slab. Although now broken, the upper torso, at least, seems to have been integral with the detached fragment of the body of the plaque. After moulding, some details appear to have been modelled into the moulded clay features, while others were formed by the addition/modelling of extra pieces of clay, e.g. the ropes in the hands, the tresses of the hair, the eyes of the owls. The front surface was burnished and polished. This must have been done while the clay was leather hard and the chaff filler was still in place as the edges of the impressions left after the chaff had burnt out are quite fresh. The sides of the slab appear to have been trimmed with a knife or similar sharp tool. In a section of the same report, dealing with the present condition of the relief, the main break is described, and the following statement is made: It should be noted that the head is attached to a wedge of clay that is now separate from the other fragments of the plaque, so that strictly speaking there is now no certain link between the figure and the proper top left and top right fragments that were tested by TL in 1975. However the two sides of the break that are visible are in every respect identical and it seems virtually certain that the two sides belong together. (p. 171) were taken from a summary of the 1975 report made in 2000, with the dates reduced to round numbers. In the 1975 report (cited in Curtis and Collon 1996: 90), the dates had been 2010-3730, or 1765-45 bc (as given in Collon 2005: 18). In an e-mail to colleagues in the British Museum on 15 December 2006, alerting them to Albenda's article, Muscarella stated "I don't want someone to tell me about TL: which can be faked, indeed". The implication that a forger active before 1933 (see n. 4) could have anticipated thermoluminescence testing defies belief! 4 Curtis and Collon (1996: 90) and Collon (2005: 7-11) give additional information about the plaque before and after its acquisition by Burney. Indeed Roger Homsey, of the firm Selim Homsey of London, first placed it on deposit in the British Museum on 20 February 1933; it was recorded as being "broken in 3 pieces &amp; a number of frags." It was collected two years later after having been analysed by Plenderleith, and possibly repaired. Only then was it sold to Sydney Burney. 5 Most terracottas are too small to have been inlaid, and none of the large ones known to me has inlaid eyes. However, relatively few stone sculptures have inlaid eyes, for many have lost their inlay; with the terracottas we may be dealing with accidents of discovery and survival. In this context it is perhaps worth mentioning that the size of the Queen plaque (height 49 cm) is by no means unique. Two plaques of the same period, excavated at Ur, measure respectively 73 and 61 cm in height (Woolley and Mallowan 1976, 173 and PI. 81 Nos. 1 and 2). Note also the inlaid eyes of the Jericho skulls and Ain Ghazal plaster figures dating back to the seventh millennium bc (Collon 1995: 42, Ills. 20-1). The Ashur plaque, referred to below, also has inlaid eyes (Reade 2000: 106). 6 One of these "heads" is that of the British Museum's Gudea (BM ANE 122910). Although there is no physical join, "the stone was identified at the British Museum (Natural History) from samples of both head and body: Tt would appear that the samples are of the same material, "namely, somewhat altered quartz dolerite"'". The report adds that the samples are "from the same source material, are virtually identical, and therefore could well have come from the same hewn block of stone" (Reade 2002: 276-84; Reade also discusses the origins of the Gudea statue). The stone had been blackened and polished in the 1930s to conform to the prevailing fashion.</page><page sequence="4">46 DOMINIQUE COLLON This shows that the head was integral with the wedge of clay behind it, and that it is "virtually certain" that the wedge formed part of the original plaque, because "the two sides of the break that are visible are in every respect identical (my italics; see Collon 2005: 10 and 24, Figs. 3 and 10). Thus Albenda's statement that the "examination showed that the head did not originally belong to the body" is not accurate. Nor is her statement (p. 187) that "the figural subject matter was modelled ...on the background" (my italics) ? the two, i.e. "the body of the figure and chest, neck and head" (see above) on the one hand, and the background on the other ? were an integral mass pressed into a mould from the back. On p. 175 Albenda states, "the addition of black paint, now much faded, represents the pubic hair, within which is a tiny vertical indentation. This particular, somewhat naturalistic rendering finds little parallel.. ."7 There is, however, no evidence for black paint; the pubic triangle is merely a slightly darker red, as are the nipples and the navel; however, optimum lighting of the plaque means that on photographs it is often in shadow. The "vertical indentation" is actually a small flake to the left of the point of the pubic triangle, on the line of a major repaired crack across the plaque. Albenda goes on to discuss the composition (p. 175). The "axial symmetry of the plaque may be described as consisting of a five-part emblematic design ... This five-part configuration contrasts with known emblematic designs produced during the second and first millennia B.C., which conform to the three-part symmetry." Albenda provides only one example (pp. 175-6 n. 13) to demonstrate "three-part symmetry": a second-millennium plaque from Ashur depicting a central god flanked by two water deities and two large goats; she explains away the goats that nibble at the god's plants as "ancillary"! Julian Reade (2000) has summarised the evidence for considering that the god is Ashur and that the goats are his attributes, as first demonstrated by Unger as long ago as 1965 and repeated, most recently by Collins (2006: 101-2 n. 30). Far from being "ancillary", therefore, the goats identify the god and are crucial to the scene. Note also that in this uncontested piece the god's eyes are inlaid. The talons of the owls and goddess should, according to Albenda (p. 176), rest "upon the ground line" and "upon the back of an animal", but Albenda gives no examples of how the talons would be shown according to her criteria. She does not take into account the fact that owls have four talons, two at the front and two at the back, one of which is double-jointed and can flip forward, thus enabling owls to perch and handle their prey more easily. The owls are perched on the mountains, and the goddess is perched on the lion(s), with three talons shown in front and the fourth at the back (respectively behind the mountain and the lion), as they would be in nature. The illustrations in Curtis and Collon 1996: 91 Fig. 1 (= Collon 2005: 16 Fig. 6) do actually show feet and talons in profile and demonstrate that human feet are best depicted in profile, whereas talons are shown to greater effect frontally. Albenda also remarks that, "the manner in which the composite female figure and lions are depicted departs from that shown on bas-reliefs with similar subject matter in Mesopotamian art" (my italics), but she gives no examples and repeatedly points out that the plaque is "unique" (e.g. p. 173) and has "no known parallels" (e.g. p. 179). Albenda then reviews previous discussions of the plaque (pp. 176-8)8 and attempts to identify the figure. Since there are "no identifiable representations" of Ereshkigal, Ishtar's sister and Queen of the Underworld ? the identification favoured by the present writer (Collon 2005: 43-5) ? Albenda decides to focus on "Lilith and Ishtar as recorded in the texts and their representations in ancient Near Eastern art ..., in order to conclude whether the British Museum plaque is a forgery or not" (p. 178). She surveys the evidence for Lilith and rejects that identification (pp. 178-9; see Collon 2005: 39-40). She then turns her attention to visual representations of Ishtar (pp. 179-82) and illustrates an interesting plaque in Yale (p. 181 Fig. 3) which must be Old Babylonian (as catalogued by Van Buren 1930: 93 Fig. 130), but which Albenda (p. 180) inex plicably assigns to "the first millennium, probably the late eighth or seventh century B.C."9 7 There are, in fact, numerous parallels for a "vertical indentation", e.g. Barrelet 1968: Nos. 370-4, 428, 434, 461-2, 469 etc., just to mention some clear examples! 8 Although she provides a reference to Opitz's 1937-9 article in n. 15, she fails to mention that in it Opitz declares having changed his mind and been convinced of the plaque's authenticity by Frankfort's arguments. 9 The Yale plaque is typically Old Babylonian. The god dess wears a headdress with four pairs of horns and a disc, that Albenda describes correctly (p. 173) as "an item of</page><page sequence="5">THE QUEEN UNDER ATTACK ? A REJOINDER 47 She concludes with the ambiguous statement, "therefore, the Yale plaque cannot be used stylistic ally to authenticate the British Museum plaque, whether or not one accepts the proposed dates for both plaques ? a separation of about a millennium". This, incidentally, is the first indica tion that Albenda accepts, as regards style, the date proposed by the British Museum. What is probably another aspect of Old Babylonian Ishtar shows her frontally, robed, holding her double lion-headed mace, and standing on two addorsed lions (e.g. Collon 1986: Nos. 358, and 401 where the lions are winged; al-Gailani Werr 1988: Pis. XXV, 7-9 from Sippar and XXXVIII, 3-5 from Larsa). Albenda (p. 182) then turns to the wings on the Queen plaque and states that "they appear slightly above the shoulders unnaturally", whereas on seals wings normally "extend outwards from the back of the goddess" and that "Mesopotamian images of anthropomorphic figures with ... wings invariably show the wings extending from behind the shoulders or torso" (actually, also the waist), but see Albenda's reference to lowered wings on p. 177 n. 22. However (using Barrelet 1952 as her source), she then refers to a goddess on a terracotta from Nippur, described by the excavators as "with wings and bird feet" (McCown and Haines 1967: PI. 134:6 = Curtis and Collon 1996: 91 Fig. la = Collon 2005: 16 Fig. 6a). Albenda describes the wings as "a long pleated cape that reaches to her ankles ... covering her back and slightly raised above the shoulder" (my italics). She also cites and illustrates (p. 183 Fig. 4 = Curtis and Collon 1996: 93, Fig. 2b = Collon 2005: 14 Fig. 6a) "a plaque from Ur" ? actually an unprovenanced mould10 ? disputing the fact, noted by Barrelet, that talons are depicted, and describing them as "overly large toes" with "toenails ... indicated" (no toenails are visible on the mould); the wings become "the upper part of [a] long cape" that "covers the shoulders and upper arms" with "the lower portion of the fabric ... plaited to form a chevron pattern". Albenda concludes, "the nude talon-footed female on the British Museum plaque could be described as reflecting the manner of wearing a short cape designed here as wings". There are, however, many other examples of a nude winged goddess with bird talons, some of which have been illustrated together (Curtis and Collon 1996: 91 Fig. 1 = Collon 2005: 16 Fig. 6).11 In Albenda's view (p. 179), "in Mesopotamian iconography there are no known parallels for the nudef,] winged, talon-footed female represented on the British Museum plaque". She is, therefore determined, against all the evidence, to see capes and toes where others have independ ently and almost invariably12 noted wings and talons, and despite the appearance of figures with divinity that occurs in the visual arts of Mesopotamia, particularly from the Ur III period to the Old Babylonian period". The wedges on her shoulders are characteristic of the hairstyle of Old Babylonian and earlier goddesses and are very like the stylised examples that appear on the Queen plaque. The curved weapon is Ishtar's main weapon, held by her on almost all Old Babylonian cylinder seals (e.g. Collon 1986: 31, 156-8, Nos. 122, 384-91, 393-7, 551); it is still Ishtar's weapon in the first millennium, but has become sickle-shaped (the Khorsabad example of the weapon, mentioned by Albenda, defines the antiquity of the mythical "hero-type figure"). The same Old Babylonian seals show Ishtar with "two quivers on her back which sometimes contain maces rather than arrows, ... held in position by straps which cross over her breast and are attached to her belt, the ends of which are sometimes shown" ? as on the Yale plaque (Collon 1986: 156). The bow is rarely depicted on Old Babylonian glyptic and then is hanging over the shoulder (see Collon 1986: No. 398, hanging over Ishtar's shoulder, one of only two examples to depict a bow in that catalogue of 655 seals); Albenda is right to note the first-millennium examples (although these show pairs of arrows). However, a series of early second millennium rock-cut reliefs on the western flanks of the Zagros show rulers holding bows and often approaching Ishtar; the Shaikhan relief is particularly close, but the arrows are all in the quiver (Postgate and Roaf 1997: 149 Fig. 4, with the other reliefs also discussed and illustrated). However, the most convincing evidence for an Old Babylonian date for the Yale plaque is a plaque excavated in an early second-millennium level at Isin showing a frontal version of Ishtar with her foot on one lion, with quivers, crossed straps, bow (turned the other way) arrow and curved weapon (Spycket 1981: 71, 73, PL 29: IB 1205). 10 First published by Zervos (1935, PL 138), this object is actually a mould for a terracotta plaque, as already noted by Barrelet (1952: 289), one of the few to survive. For photographs of the ancient mould and its modern impres sion see Curtis and Collon 1996: 93 Fig. 2b and Collon 2005: 14 Fig. 5a, where the two were photographed together, showing why the photograph published by Zervos looks like a plaque rather than a mould. It was acquired in 1910 from the dealer J. J. Naaman. The photographer, Coppola, may have scribbled down in his notes "Terre cuite ... Our III", which then, in Zervos's caption, became "Terre cuite, Our, vers 3000 avant notre ere", which, incidentally, is repeated on the facing page in Zervos, in relation to a detail from a large Neo-Assyrian jar excavated by Layard at Nimrud (Green 1985: 75 n. 5 and PL VII). 11 The "later" examples of figures wearing capes and revealing their nudity, cited by Albenda (p. 182 n. 52; Collon 1988 = Collon 1987 in Albenda's bibliography) are Syrian goddesses wearing fringed mantles on Syrian seals of the Old Babylonian period. 12 When Van Buren and Barrelet first began working on the problem, they did entertain the notion that capes might be represented, but further and more complete examples convinced them that wings and talons were being depicted</page><page sequence="6">48 DOMINIQUE COLLON lowered wings on seals, seen as "a criterion of a demon" (p. 177, following Porada 1980: 266). Albenda mentions (p. 182) "the absence of excavated parallels" in order to support her argument that the maker of the Queen plaque had misunderstood the motif and turned the cape into wings.13 She does not explain why goddesses with "capes" should also have "overly large toes". Next, Albenda considers the owls (pp. 184-5). She expresses the view (p. 184) that "one would expect the maker of a major iconographical plaque, who was capable of modelling the nude female figure with a considerable degree of expertise, had a basic understanding of how to represent and depict an owl or bird in general". Is it not just possible that the maker had seen more naked females than owls? The idea of drawing from life is a relatively recent phenomenon, and whereas a Mesopotamian would frequently have glimpsed owls flying in the dark, he (or she) would have been unlikely to have seen them perching and well lit. Albenda takes particular exception to the way the beaks are depicted as "a damaged (accidental?) triangular surface" (p. 184, implying they were damaged intentionally?). Would any of us be able to draw an accurate owl without checking on Google or in one of the many bird books on the market? After all, from her comments it seems Albenda was unaware that owls had four talons. And would not a forger of a major work of art have been equally motivated to get it right, had he (or she) considered it important? The birds are clearly owls. As Van Buren wrote (1939: 87), "the anatomy of these owls may be incorrect, but the artist has known how to render the solemn and inscrutable character of the bird". The animals and birds in many children's books indicate the essentials, and children recognise them (sometimes one wonders how), but accuracy is unimportant. Albenda's examples of "convincingly" depicted birds (p. 185 ? for Ur III read ED III), show them with lion heads, human hands and navels (perhaps indicating that they reproduced as lions rather than laying eggs?); even the wings are wrong: they are attached to the sides of the body, but in nature the feathers would be pendant from the bone of the wing, and would therefore be vertical (like the goddess's on the Queen plaque) and not horizontal, and they would be separate from the bird's body. As Albenda herself points out (p. 185), "in Mesopotamian art it is character istic for the wings of the bird to be attached to the side of the body". Why is she willing to accept (Barrelet 1952: 288). A plaque from Ur (here n. 13f) was published as depicting a cape, but I have found no other example of wings being called capes. 13 Albenda has also dismissed or ignored the following examples, all excavated unless otherwise indicated: a) Babylon: A damaged plaque (Albenda: 181-2 and n. 47). The Reuther 1926 reference should read p. 11 and PI. 6:1). Reuther was possibly the first to describe one of these plaques: he believed the figure to be winged. For a new and clearer photograph of this, and two other plaques with winged figures from Babylon, see Klengel Brandt and Cholidis 2006: Nos. 98-100; on Nos. 98 and 100 the goddess also stands on recumbent, addorsed, overlapping lions with their heads turned frontally. b) Kish: A plaque not mentioned by Albenda. Sketched by Barrelet (1952: 288 Fig. 5, drawn from the photograph in de Genouillac (1925: PI. VTI:7 ? no description). c) Unprovenanced plaque: Albenda: 182 n. 51. The terra cotta from Kish mentioned by Van Buren (1936-7: 354) was cited as a depiction of a lion (not illustrated). Albenda mistook the attribution and mistakenly applied it to Van Buren's Fig. 3, which does not come from Kish, but is unprovenanced. The goddess is perched on addorsed horned quadrupeds, has talons and, instead of dewclaws (Albenda makes no mention of these intriguing features in her articles), the goddess has what may be the vestigial hooves used as scent glands on some horned quadrupeds (Collon 2005: 31-3). Parrot illustrates this plaque together with the Queen of the Night plaque and a decorated vessel (see d below; Parrot 1960: 300 111. 367a-c = Curtis and Collon 1996: 91 Fig. lc-d = Collon 2005: 16, Fig. 6c and d). All three objects are described by Parrot as showing winged figures. d) Larsa vessel: Not mentioned by Albenda; see c above for references. The cylindrical cup is decorated with an incised drawing and four miniature plaques, all depicting a frontal goddess with lowered wings springing from behind her back, and talons turned outwards, a feature that should meet Albenda's criteria for horizontal talons, as expressed on p. 176 ? or are these yet another case of Albenda's "overly large toes" with particularly nasty bunions and corns? e) Nippur: Apart from a plaque already referred to in the text (= Albenda p. 182 n. 50), Albenda does not mention other examples excavated at Nippur (Legrain 1930: No. 228 described as a "winged demon with claws of an eagle"; McCown and Haines 1967: PI. 134:7 and 8, admittedly fragmentary, so no talons or "overly large toes" are visible, but one (No. 8) has a phallus on each side. Wrede (2003: 285 n. 1360) suggests that McCown and Haines 1967: PI. 127:6 might also show the same goddess. f) Ur: A plaque in Baghdad, broken above the knees, not mentioned by Albenda, but described by the excavators as "a cloak that lies on her shoulders and falls on either side" (Woolley and Mallowan 1976: 179 No. 158, PI. 81; actually the wings seem to spring from her back, and note the interesting objects she holds in her raised hands). g) Uruk: Two fragmentary examples were published recently (Wrede 2003:285-6, Nos. 1032-3, with examples from other contexts including some mentioned here). No. 1033 could, according the Wrede, be interpreted as showing part of a bird's foot, but this is not clear. h) Examples of winged figures on seal impressions from Tell Harmal, Tell Leilan and Nuzi, also missed by Albenda, do not have talons and their wings spring from the waist (Curtis and Collon 1996: 91 Fig. le-g = Collon 2005: 16 Fig. 5e-g).</page><page sequence="7">the queen under attack ? a rejoinder 49 "the craftsman's lack of knowledge of the living variety" (p. 184) for other birds, but not for the owls? Why are these Anzu birds more "convincingly" depicted than the owls? And surely the scarcity in the depiction of owls can be attributed to the fact that they were inauspicious birds.14 Albenda (pp. 185-6) concludes with a discussion of the lions15 and describes "the extension of the lion's mane to the underside of a male lion" as "a standard feature", which is scarcely surprising as it occurs in nature on Asiatic lions. These once ranged from Greece to India, but are now extinct except for those in the Gir National Park in Gujarat and their descendants bred in zoos. Harrington records that "the last reliable report of the Persian lion in Iran was near Dezful in 1942", i.e. not far from the Iraqi border (Harrington et al. 1911: 72; Collon 2005: 33-5). Albenda is right to focus on the whorls on the shoulders of the lions (which represent a feature of the fur of Asiatic lions), but she is wrong when she states that the two differ, and she describes both inaccurately. Each consists of a circle edged by radiating lines and with two striated, pendant shapes that resemble Stalin's moustaches; one side of each of these elements is against the light background (that on the left lion is rather worn), but the other side is against the dark paint and is harder to see on photographs. Perhaps the earliest example of this type is on a fragment of a large stone lion (reconstructed length about 47 cm) from Uruk, inscribed with the name of Gudea of Lagash (c. 2100 bc; Boehmer 1987: 126-7 Abb. la-b, with the whorls within a circle and with squarer "moustache"-like elements). Albenda cites this from an article (Beyer et al. 1993), which contains a useful list of examples of shoulder whorls; she notes that these all date to the third millennium, which is scarcely surprising as the article she consulted focused on third-millennium lions from Mari. There are, however, particularly close examples excavated in Old Babylonian levels at Nippur, with similar "Stalin moustaches" to those on the Queen plaque (McCowan and Haines 1967: PI. 142: 8, 10 = Collon 2005: 23 Fig. 9). Albenda's conclusions are negative, not surprisingly in view of the tenor of her discussion, which has focused on all the unusual aspects for which she claims she can find no excavated parallel. As she says: "A serious problem with the British Museum plaque is that early on it was in the possession of an antiquities dealer, i.e. without an archaeological locus". That is indeed regrettable. It is "clear" to her that "the British Museum plaque presents a pastiche of artistic features and motifs observable ... in ancient Near Eastern art objects that were known in the early 1930s". Her last two sentences are: "However extraordinary the so-called 'Queen of the Night' plaque may appear, I continue to be unconvinced of its antiquity. I am even less inclined to believe that it represents a major work of the Old Babylonian period."16 It is unfortunate that Albenda does not follow, as she claims (p. 187), "recognized art-historical methods". She has only looked at "artistic features and motifs observable in excavated and unprovenienced ancient Near Eastern objects that were known in the early 1930s" in order to prove her argument. In the process she has redated the Yale plaque by one millennium (see n. 9 above) and consistently reinterpreted the Mesopotamian motif of the winged goddess with talons, without pausing to consider whether excavators and art historians, since at least 1926, might not conceivably be correct in their interpretation. In order to give a balanced view, Albenda should also have looked at objects excavated and published since the early 1930s, which demonstrate that 14 Van Buren gives two examples of owls (1939: 87 and Fig. 93a-b); one is made of haematite and is un provenanced; the other is made of shell and was excavated at Ur: U.7921 =BM ANE 120655 (1928-10-9, 143). For textual references to owls and related birds, see The Chicago Assyrian Dictionary, s.v. qad? A (p. 51): this is an owl, but there are few reference to it; it is also the verb "to hoot" and a text is cited where owls hoot in an abandoned city. CAD, s.v. essebu, describes the essebu-b\xd as possibly "a nocturnal bird of evil portent related to the owl" (p. 371) and "the bird of evil portent" (p. 370), and cites (a) an omen text: "if an essebu-bird enters somebody's house, misfortune will follow him CT 41 7:35". 15 To her list of third-millennium lions with closed mouths can be added a gold plaque excavated at Tell Brak. The lions are standing and overlap, with their heads frontal. Interestingly, they seem to have talons (Matthews 2003: cover and 203-9). The curved tail of the lion, which Albenda (p. 186 n. 61) compares with depictions of lions carried by heroes on Khorsabad reliefs, is also closely paralleled on a fragment of a stone vessel excavated in an Old Babylonian context at Nippur (Gibson 1975: 45:3a-b); note that this, like the Khorsabad lions, is another "rare exception to the rule showing the closed hind paws of a lion" (p. 186 n. 61). 16 Albenda's last two sentences are strange. If the plaque is indeed a forgery, then it cannot be a major work of art of the Old Babylonian period ? merely a masterpiece of the forger's art. And is she really more convinced of its authenticity than of its being "a major work of the Old Babylonian period"?</page><page sequence="8">50 DOMINIQUE COLLON motifs she considers "unparalleled" and "unique" are now known to have had currency in the ancient Near East. One of the most convincing excavated objects in any study of the plaque has to be, as already noted in 1937-9 by Henri Frankfort, the upper part of an enthroned deity from Ur, now on display in the British Museum alongside the Queen (U.16993 = BM ANE 122934 [1931-10-10,2]; Woolley and Mallowan 1976: 144, 169, 172, 247, PI. 63; Collon 2005: 12, 17-18, Fig. 4). The piece was excavated at Ur by Leonard Woolley during the 1930-1 season in a "Larsa" (=01d Babylonian) level, and was part of the British Museum's share of the discoveries, according to the division of finds then in operation. Both pieces are made of clay to the same high standard, but the god is modelled in the round and the clay is unbaked. The two heads are much the same size and wear the same headdress with four pairs of horns topped by a disc. Both are painted in the same range of colours: red, black and white, but in addition yellow could be identified on the god's headdress and necklace at the time of discovery, and there is still a yellow sheen although there is not enough pigment to sample. Both figures wear a necklace of alternating groups of horizontal and vertical beads, respectively painted yellow and red for the god (the colour does not survive for the Queen). A small fragment of a terracotta plaque of the same date, with a similar necklace design, has been excavated at Isin (Spycket 1981: 71, 74, PI. 29: IB 1237). It is interesting to look at the aspects that had caused Albenda concern when she first studied the plaque (Albenda 1970). One of these was the overlap of the addorsed lions: she found "particularly disturbing" this "overcrowding" that left "the body of one recumbent lion completely hidden behind its companion" (Albenda 1970: 88). However, a recently-excavated gold plaque from Tell Brak has provided an excellent, and chronologically earlier, parallel (see above, n. 15). Her feelings about the owls have not changed. However, she does not refer to the main focus of her 1970 article, namely the fact that the goddess holds not one, but two rod-and-ring symbols. This, of course, can be explained as a response to the strictly symmetrical composition. However, Albenda's main argument was that "the ring and rod emblem is to be associated with important male deities and with the goddess Ishtar, but never with a figure of the type represented on the Burney relief" (Albenda 1970: 92). As noted by Albenda, I believe the Queen of the Night to be Ereshkigal, Queen of the Underworld, hence the black background, the owls, the anaemic lions that are white apart from their manes, and the goddess's pendant wings. As acknowledged by Albenda (2005: 178), "no identifiable representation of her [Ereshkigal] occurs in excavated ancient Near Eastern art". But then, there is no other figure "of the type represented by the Burney relief" (Albenda 1970: 92). In my booklet on The Queen of the Night (Collon 2005: 43-5) I argued (p. 44) that Shamash held the rod-and-ring of justice because he saw everything as he passed through the sky; as goddess of the Underworld, Ereshkigal's was the ultimate justice, and she therefore had a right to two such emblems. I could kick myself for not having consulted the paper by Elisabeth von der Osten Sacken, which was published in 2002, and which I had actually heard her read when I attended the Helsinki Rencontre in July 2001. In the story of Inanna/Ishtar's "Descent to the Underworld" to visit her sister Ereshkigal, Ishtar is divested of all her finery, her jewels and symbols, including her rod-and-ring. So, of course, Ereshkigal ended up with two rod-and-ring symbols! It is such a simple, elegant and convincing solution to the problem!17 Pauline Albenda and I were both students of Edith Porada's, the grande dame of cylinder-seal studies. Porada always maintained that one should spend as much time as possible working with genuine material: a forgery would then become evident. She believed that, with time, a forgery would look worse and worse, whereas a genuine object would grow better and better. I have had the good fortune to work closely with the Queen of the Night plaque since she returned to the British Museum. Over the years she has indeed grown better and better, and more and more interesting. For me, she is a real work of art of the Old Babylonian period. Perhaps if Pauline Albenda had had the same opportunities, she would have come to see the Queen in a different light. 17 Albenda is right that the texts can help us understand the iconography. Unfortunately, text and picture belong to different traditions, and all too often it is impossible to correlate the two (see Black and Green 1992: 15-21).</page><page sequence="9">THE QUEEN UNDER ATTACK ?
