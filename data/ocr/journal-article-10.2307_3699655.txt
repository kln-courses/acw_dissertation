By Roderic Alley. Burlington, VT: Ashgate, 2004. 252 pp., $94.95 (ISBN: 0-7546-0976-6). Internal Conflict and the International Community: Wars without End? by Roderic Alley is a most welcome and timely volume. It is welcome because it addresses the failure of prevailing (and contesting) international relations theories to explain the persist- ence and pervasiveness of domestic wars and the mutually contingent impacts of global forces and local conflicts on each other. The book is timely because the need to explain the expansion of US power and Washington's claimed right to coercively transform regimes to suit its preferences, highlighted by the Iraq invasion, is more urgent now than ever before. And even though the volume does not directly focus on these latter issues, it develops the intellectual preconditions for addressing them as well as a variety of other failings of global governance. Relying on an impressive array of scholarly works and public policy reports, Alley paints a broad conceptual canvass that sweeps across state boundaries and regions, disciplinary demarcations, and competing moral concerns for democracy and human rights. This well-organized and closely reasoned book merits wide circulation and serious engagement. Using case studies as his primary methodological weapons, Alley doggedly details both the shortcoming of contemporary theory and of international efforts to understand or to cope with four significant issues. The first issue is the proliferation of small arms and light weapons. Flows of these weapons incite and deepen internal conflicts and institutionalize them as economic enterprises, serving both local rivals and foreign suppliers. The second issue is the chronic and widespread issue of refugees. Millions are not only the victims of domestic violence, but as the Rwandan and Great Lakes calam- ities reveal, they are often the sources of sustained violence, approaching Hobbes' vision of the state of nature. Alley's third issue focuses on the glaring and gross human rights violations produced by domestic wars. These atrocities are shielded from effective interna- tional initiatives to limit their scope and incidence. Predator states can hide behind the claim of sovereign immunity and exercise their power with impunity against opponents. They also escape criticism for their failure to protect groups threatened by local rivals and, echoing Stephen Krasner's (1999) critique of state authority and power, for their complicity in human rights depredations as a con- sequence of what Alley characterizes as "asymmetric sovereignty." Duly identified, too, are the feckless responses of the big powers, regional security organizations, and the United Nations to arrest wholesale murder and human rights abuses and their pawing and paltry aid to victims in the aftermath of these humanly created disasters. Fourth, and finally, Alley exposes the lame protection that international human- itarian rights law affords victims, even as it protects perpetrators by privileging the claimed right of states to block external intervention aimed at protecting the weak and vulnerable.

It also reveals two of the book's major weaknesses. First, Alley makes a strong argument that his case studies expose the serious de- bilities of contemporary international relations theories to account for the impacts of domestic violence on interstate relations and transnational society. As serious is their inability to account for what the French call those forces profondes that con- tribute, arguably decisively, to the incitement of domestic wars and, in some instances, to their seemingly endless perpetuation. The most significant of these forces, as Alley recounts it, are the failures of global markets and the obdurate refusal of states, notably those states in the advantaged and developed North, to alleviate poverty, ignorance, disease, and destructive civil wars in the South. Whether we understand and explain internal conflicts through realist, economic structural, neoliberal, or pluralist conceptual lenses has profound implications for what policy prescriptions appear appropriate. However, one is reminded of H. L. Mencken's cautionary advice that all complex problems have simple solutions, and all of those solutions are wrong. Illustrative of this point is Alley's delineation of the abortive efforts of prevailing international relations theories and their practitioners to provide reliable images of domestic conflicts, their causal sources, and external effects. However, it is not clear that ad hoc responses to address the gaps in experience and fact that Alley identifies would sufficiently rehabilitate these the- ories in terms of meeting Lakatosian tests of progressive research programs by better capturing the complexities of a global society. In particular, it is not clear that such efforts would be successful if they were attempted by partisans of the par- adigms themselves. This critique leads to the second weakness of Internal Conflict and the International Community and another friendly reproof. Alley clearly tries to save these paradigms on their own terms. But why do so? Surely we should draw on what these par- adigms offer, but the interdependencies catalogued in Alley's volume also allow us to sketch the lineaments of a theory of the global society that has now emerged full blown for the first time in human history. Certainly this condition did not appear overnight, but it is the social construction of erratic, punctuated, trial and error human exchanges evolving over centuries, arguably millennia, as suggested, inter alia, by Jared Diamond (1997, 2005), John and William McNeill (2003), Peter Singer (2002), and Immanuel Kant (1991a, 1991b). These intricate and interlaced webs of global interdependencies-crystallizing on issues of weapons of mass de- struction, terrorism, widespread poverty, environmental degradation, international crime and drug trafficking, wholesale human rights transgressions, and so on-are vastly under-researched and primitively understood. As Alley observes in chal- lenging one prominent theorist, "despite its promising title, Alexander Wendt's (1999) widely noted Social Theory of International Relations offers few tools that help fathom how or why domestic upheavals transform state identities" (p. 190). This neglect is possibly explained by Wendt's belief, likely to raise wry smiles in Brazzaville, Bogota, or Baghdad, that states are settled "actors to which we can legitimately attribute anthropomorphic qualities like desires, beliefs, and inten- tionality" (Wendt 1999:197). Alley has laid down some key markers to guide theorists, practitioners, and members of a global society in what has to be an interdisciplinary and syncretic search for concepts and methods to understand and explain what William McNeill (1992) has aptly termed the "human condition today." Based on Alley's findings and analysis, it would seem to follow that the many and multiplying problems facing humans, however they may be divided against themselves, will demand solutions that are put in place simultaneously and synchronously at local, national, regional, and global levels. Alley is on the right course. Hopefully, his next effort or the works of those he inspires will produce the breakthroughs that this carefully crafted vol- ume anticipates.</page><page sequence="3">300 Flawed Governance of a Global Society References DIAMOND, JARED.
