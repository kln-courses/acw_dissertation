Only thus, he believes, can we move beyond the vari ous failed attempts - by Quine, Davidson, Rorty, and others - to achieve a natu ralised epistemology that casts off the various residual "dogmas" of old-style logical empiricism. In particular, McDowell suggests that we return to Kant's ideas of "spontaneity" and "receptivity" as the two jointly operative powers of mind which enable thought to transcend the otherwise unbridgeable gulf between sensuous intuitions and concepts of understanding. However, this project miscar ries for several reasons. Chief among them is the highly problematical nature of Kant's claims, taken over by McDowell without reference to their later treatment at the hands of subjective and objective idealists. Hence he tends to fall back into different versions of the same mind/world dualism. I then question McDowell's idea that Kant can be "naturalised" by reinterpreting those claims from a more hermeneutic or communitarian standpoint with its sources in Hegel, Wittgenstein, and Gadamer. For the result is to deprive Kant's philosophy of its distinctively critical dimension not only with regard to epistemological issues but also in rela tion to matters of ethical and sociopolitical judgement. Keywords: idealism, Kant, McDowell, philosophy of mind, receptivity, spontane ity. Some Versions of Kant John McDowell's Mind and "World is a curious book in several ways, not least because of its lopsided structure (six chapters plus an "afterword" in four sections running to almost as many pages again) and its disarmingly mixed-mode style of address, which swings from formal exposition to a relaxed, almost chatty tone (McDowell 1994, henceforth referred to by page number only in the text). No doubt this results partly from its origins in a series of lectures - at Oxford in 1991 - and partly from McDowell's decision not to write them up in standard academic form. Hence there is a large amount of near-verbatim repetition, as well as all that ancillary mate rial tacked on at the end rather than worked into the main structure of argu ment. Still, the book is offered as a serious, first-hand piece of philosophical enquiry and not just a survey of current debates with the promise of more substantive work to come. Or rather, that promise seems © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 2000</page><page sequence="2">Mcdowell on kant 383 everywhere implicit, but often subject to a countervailing sense that perhaps this way of handling the issues may be the best available, or the only approach that does not run up against problems which cannot bear too much close scrutiny. It seems to me that these problems go to the heart of McDowell's enter prise and also reveal some symptomatic tensions in his and other recent attempts to reconcile the two traditions in philosophy that supposedly diverged after Kant. On one view - prevalent among a good many (not all) present-day analytic philosophers - this split came about when continental thinkers took a series of false turns which led them into various metaphys ical thickets and speculative dead ends. Of course, the verdict varies from case to case according to the thinker in question and the particular diag nostic standpoint from which the work is viewed. Still there is a broad consensus that things went wrong when the first generation of post-Kant ian idealists (Fichte, Schelling, Hegel) became tied up with a whole set of hopelessly abstract "metaphysical" questions that arose from their misreading of certain passages in Kant or their excessive concern with just those parts of Kant's philosophy that offered least hold for constructive engagement. Thus - again roughly speaking - one can trace two lines of descent: the first leads on from issues broached in the "Transcendental Analytic" of the First Critique to their more precise formulation in recent (post-Fregean) philosophy of language and logic, while the other starts out from some famously obscure passages in the "Transcendental Aesthetic" and thereafter produces deepening confusion with its upshot in Heideg ger's notorious style of obscurantist pseudoprofundity. Or again, there is the view that Kant got it right - set philosophy on the proper track - when he argued in the section "Paralogisms of Pure Reason" (in the "Transcen dental Dialectic") that certain kinds of speculative issues lay beyond reach of adequate (conceptual) understanding and could only create bewilder ment if one sought to comprehend them in any such terms (Kant 1964, 328-68). On the simplest "us and them" version of this story, analytic philoso phers have taken due heed of Kant's various warnings, while continental thinkers have either ignored them or shown a habit of perversely following Kant at just those points where he ignores them himself. Hence - so it is thought - they have a distressing tendency to fall into strictly nonsensical styles of talk about "Absolute Knowledge" (Hegel), the dialectics of nature (Schelling), the world-constituting Ego (Fichte), or authentic Being - as distinct from mere beings - as the source of a primordial truth that comes to light through Heideggerian depth-ontological enquiry into the history of Western metaphysics. Husserl is sometimes granted a limited exemption from the general charge since his work displays certain clear affinities with the kind of logico-linguistic approach that has characterised much Anglo American philosophy in the wake of Frege and Russell (Dummett 1993; F0llesdal 1994; Tito 1990). All the same the suspicion soon grew - as with © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 2000</page><page sequence="3">384 CHRISTOPHER NORRIS Gilbert Ryle's well-known change of mind on this subject - that "tran scendental phenomenology" in the Husserlian mode was really just a form of unregenerate psychologism dressed up in false colours or lacking genuine logical rigour (Frege 1972; Ryle 1971a, 1971b, 1971c). Here again, one source of such errors - so the diagnosis runs - is a typically continental fixation on those obscure passages in Kant's "Transcendental Aesthetic" which concern judgement as a mediating power between concepts and intuitions, a power that is somehow bound up with the exer cise of Imagination, itself an "art buried in the depths of the soul" which nonetheless provides the very condition of possibility for all knowledge and experience (Kant 1964, 65-82). As regards this latter, little can be said except that it involves active spontaneity as a counterpart to the receptivity which enables our uptake of sensory data or phenomenal intuitions. From Fichte to Heidegger, those passages have offered a pretext for interpretations of Kant which, on this view, go wildly astray by devaluing whatever is of genuine (analytically recoverable) worth in his philosophy and by playing up whatever lends itself to treatment in the continental mode. More than that, they have encouraged a reading of Kant which inverts the proper (self-evident) order of priority between logic, episte mology, ethics, and aesthetics. That is to say, these interpreters have typi cally fastened on the various exegetical problems encountered in the "Transcendental Aesthetic" and have then (so to speak) read Kant back wards, starting out with the Critique of Judgement (where the problems are addressed at much greater length, albeit with no commensurate gain in clarity), and then working back through the Critique of Practical Reason to insist that those problems are not so much resolved as posed inescapably for any reading responsive to the deeper implications of Kant's thought. Chief among them are the role of that mysterious "art of judgement" which enables us to bring phenomenal intuitions under adequate concepts, and also - with respect to Kantian ethics - the equally mysterious process by which high-level maxims (deriving from the categorical imperative) are somehow applied to particular cases of context-specific or situated moral judgement. Thus the main result of this back-to-front approach - epito mised in Heidegger's Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics - is to high light passages from the Third Critique (especially those sections concerning the teleological doctrine of nature) which have proved an embarrassment for most analytic commentators, and to view them rather as crucial texts for a depth-hermeneutic reading (Kant 1978; Heidegger 1962; Lyotard 1994; also Norris 1993). Worse still, this approach demotes logic and epistemology to the status of merely second-order or derivative concerns whose preeminence within the Western post-Hellenic philosoph ical tradition has deflected thinking from its authentic concern with ques tions of primordial Being and truth. This may seem a strange manner of introduction to McDowell's Mind and World, a book which contains no mention of Heidegger, though it does © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 2000</page><page sequence="4">Mcdowell on kant 385 have a number of passages on Hegel, some respectful references to Hans Georg Gadamer, and a great deal to say about Kant. However, I hope that the above preamble will appear more relevant as this discussion goes on. What is so remarkable is the way in which McDowell retraces the steps of post-Kantian continental philosophy, and indeed confronts many of the same issues that analytic philosophers have been keen to avoid, while presenting his case in a "back to Kant" guise which makes light of those issues even though they crowd in upon his argument at every stage. I do not wish to stage this reading as some kind of quasi-Freudian psychodrama, a "return of the continental repressed" that would have McDowell talking placidly (as he does) about Quine, Sellars, Davidson, Evans, Peacocke, and other analytic confreres by way of a fragile defence mechanism against all those threatening intrusions from an alien philo sophical quarter. What I want to suggest - less dramatically - is that McDowell cannot accomplish this return to Kant without in the process reopening questions (especially questions from the "Transcendental Aesthetic") that were left unresolved in the First Critique. Moreover, they are posed with particular force since McDowell rests the main weight of his argument on a number of Kantian claims that have proved extremely problematic for his commentators and have lent themselves to readings of precisely the kind which typify that "other" tradition. McDowell clearly wishes his book to be read as having something in common with the project of scaled-down "descriptivist" Kantian metaphysics undertaken by thinkers such as Strawson (Strawson 1959, 1966). That is to say, he will redeem what is useful or what makes good sense from an analytic stand point, and treat the rest (including much of Kant's "transcendental" appa ratus) as playing no essential role in this project and hence as strictly surplus to requirements. However, it is far from clear that McDowell can have what he wants from Kant - an answer to certain pressing dilemmas in current analytic debate - without taking over at least some part of that supposedly detachable machinery, and thereby placing his own project in a somewhat different (more questionable) light. "Two Dogmas" Revisited: Quine, Davidson, Rorty These problems emerge most sharply in connection with a central line of argument in McDowell's book, one that he rehearses many times over with minor variations of emphasis and phrasing. This is the suggestion that Kant points a way beyond the various kinds of scheme/content dualism which have struck most philosophers - at least since Quine's "Two Dogmas of Empiricism" (1961) - as a bad liability, but which persist (so McDowell argues) in a range of less obvious yet equally troublemaking forms. As regards Quine he agrees to a large extent with Donald Davidson: that there is a third, residual "dogma" which features in Quine's essay, namely, his idea that "truth in general depends on both language and extralinguistic © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 2000</page><page sequence="5">386 CHRISTOPHER NORRIS fact" (130-37; also Davidson 1984). For this throws away the whole force of Quine's argument against Dogma One (the Kantian distinction between analytic and synthetic statements, or Humean "truths of reason" and "matters of fact") and Dogma Two (the related logical-empiricist idea that statements can be checked off against the world on a one-to-one corre spondence principle). In short, "Quine's positive picture, his 'empiricism without the dogmas,' retains a counterpart to the duality that figures in spelling out the idea of analyticity, [since] truth - which we must now think of as primarily possessed by a whole world-view - depends partly on 'language' and partly on 'experience' " (131). Such is McDowell's approving rendition of Davidson's well-known critique of Quine in his essay "On the Very Idea of a Conceptual Scheme" (1984). However, Davidson himself falls prey to yet another variant of the same dogma. This results from his drawing a sharp distinction between the realm of causal world-mind transactions, where stimuli are taken to impact directly upon our sensory receptors or nervous system, and the realm of reasons and beliefs, where causal explanations cannot provide any kind of justificatory warrant. What transpires at this level, Davidson argues, is a process of holistic adjustment (very much as Quine describes it) aimed toward optimizing truth content or rational acceptability. But in order for such a process to occur, that is, for those beliefs to be properly arrived at through the exercise of reason, we must take it that causality extends just so far as the bare (uninterpreted) physical stimuli or sensory inputs. For it would otherwise infringe upon the freedom of thought to sift among the evidence, distinguish what is firm from what is revisable in the way of belief, and hence come up with some optimal set of truth-preserving hypotheses. That is to say, if we push any further with the causal account of belief formation, then it will yield a thoroughly determinist theory which removes knowledge altogether from the "space of reasons" or from the realm of justificatory arguments that involve an appeal beyond the (supposed) self-evidence of sensory stimuli (Davidson 1984; also 1980). However, as McDowell rightly says, this "solution" to the problem is far from satisfactory since it fixes an unbridgeable gulf between the raw data of perceptual experience - as they would seem on Davidson's account - and the various rational or sense-making capacities to which those data are somehow (inexplicably) subject. In other words, it reverts to that pre-Kant ian stage in the history of thought when rationalists such as Leibniz and empiricists such as Hume came at the issue from opposite sides and provoked Kant to issue his famous dictum; "Thoughts without content are empty; intuitions without concepts are blind." McDowell cites this passage on several occasions and takes it as indicative of everything that is wrong with philosophy in the line of descent which runs from logical empiricism, via Quine and Davidson, to Rorty's yet more extreme (neopragmatist) version of the argument for disjoining the realm of causal "impacts" from the realm of beliefs and justificatory reasons (Rorty 1991). What they all © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 2000</page><page sequence="6">Mcdowell on kant 387 have in common, as McDowell sees it, is a failure to explain how we could ever make sense of those raw sensory data if indeed they are taken to exist quite apart from the "space" of rational warrant or critical-evaluative thought. Thus Quine puts his case for meaning holism in terms of an advance beyond the old picture (where statements are tested one by one for corre spondence with discrete items of empirical fact) to a theory which treats every such statement as facing the entire "tribunal of experience" along with all the other statements or beliefs which constitute our scientific worldview at any given time (Quine 1961). However, this Kantian "tribunal" metaphor is simply misapplied, McDowell maintains, if it is used in default of any adequate theory with which to explain how particu lar statements can indeed be accountable to experience and also subject to critical assessment in point of rationality and truth: "when Quine speaks of facing the tribunal of experience, that sounds as if it expresses the idea of rational answerability, but the rhetoric is hollow. . . . once we understand experience so that it really can be a tribunal, we commit ourselves to conceiving it in such a way that rational answerability to it can be appor tioned between statements" (160, emphasis in original). For we shall then be able to grasp how certain statements are confirmed or falsified by the evidence precisely insofar as that evidence already belongs to the "space of reasons," rather than somehow standing over against it in a realm of pre given, inert, or sheerly "empirical" data. Take for instance - McDowell's example - the case of "an experience with a content partly capturable by 'Here's a black swan' " (160). Accord ing to Quine, we shall have to assume that any evidential force possessed by that experience must be a matter of its fitting or failing to fit with the entire existing structure of beliefs-held-true at any given time. So there could always, just conceivably, be room for adjustment at some point within the "manmade" fabric of beliefs (perhaps at a point close to the empirical periphery, as by pleading hallucination or perceptual disorder) which allowed us to carry on asserting the universal statement "All swans are white." Thus what looks like a knockdown disconfirmatory "experi ence" should rather be seen as disposing us very strongly to abandon the universal claim, but not as absolutely requiring that we abandon it on pain of manifest irrationality. According to McDowell, on the contrary, "[sjuch an experience poses a rational problem for the statement, or belief, that there are no black swans; there is a germaneness relation between them that is not restricted, as in Quine's picture, to the likelihood that the belief will be abandoned" (160). In short, there is no need to accept Quine's holistic theory of evidence if we reject his concomitant idea of experien tial data as standing outside the "space of reasons," or as somehow exist ing quite apart from the activity of thought whereby those data acquire an intelligible bearing on our judgements of truth and falsehood. Davidson goes a long way toward exposing what is wrong with this © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 2000</page><page sequence="7">388 CHRISTOPHER NORRIS third dogma of empiricism. But in the end his argument collapses back into something very like the same position, namely, the idea that "nothing can count as a reason for holding a belief except another belief," so that causal (physicalist or stimulus-response) accounts of belief formation must be thought of as belonging to a separate realm. Thus for Davidson, famously, "belief is in its nature veridical," since we cannot get outside the space of reasons (what counts for us as veridical belief) in order to test our beliefs for correspondence with a mind-independent reality (see especially David son 1984, 195-97). All that we can do in response to such demands is adopt a different (externalist) perspective and explain how those beliefs were arrived at through a process of unmediated causal interaction with features of the physical environment. But of course, ex hypothesi, this must be taken to exclude any normative appeal to standards of justificatory warrant or valid reasoning on the evidence. From here it is but a short step to Davidson's distinctly Quinean conclusion that the best test for truth as concerns any given item of belief is maximal coherence with the widest range of other beliefs-held-true. For if rational appraisal cannot begin farther back - if it plays no part in the very process of empirical knowledge acquisition - then indeed we are stuck once again with the old (pre-Kant ian) dilemma. That is to say, we have to think of "experience" in terms of an "extraconceptual impact on sensibility," a causal nexus between world and mind which somehow produces our various belief states through a process of passive sensory uptake that is completely disconnected from any kind of rational-evaluative thinking or judgement. From this view it follows - the other side of this bad disjunction - that "rationality" can only be a matter of ensuring that our beliefs hang together so far as possible quite aside from any notional constraints exerted by experience, sensory stimuli, perceptual inputs, and so on. For on Davidson's account there is just no way of bridging this gap between a causal theory that blocks the appeal to normative criteria and a coherence theory that renders our beliefs effectively devoid of epistemic or cognitive warrant. McDowell is well aware of these problems thrown up in the wake of logical empiricism, notwithstanding the various confident claims - by thinkers such as Quine and Davidson - to have left them safely behind. Thus, in Davidson's case, "we should be suspicious of his bland confi dence that empirical content can be intelligibly in our picture even though we carefully stipulate that the world's impacts on our senses have nothing to do with justification" (15). This suspicion is heightened if one then considers how the double-aspect (causal/coherentist) approach is taken up by Rorty - albeit through a questionable reading of Davidson's texts - and used to implement a yet more drastic dichotomy between causal "impacts" and whatever we make of them according to this or that language game, "final vocabulary," interpretive schema, cultural life form, or whatever. Thus for Rorty there is a sense (an uninteresting sense) in which we may say that "[w]hen Galileo saw the moons of Jupiter © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 2000</page><page sequence="8">Mcdowell on kant 389 through his telescope ... its impact on his retina was 'hard,' even though its consequences were, to be sure, different for different communities" (Rorty 1991, 81). Rorty is quite happy to concede this point - to acknowl edge "the pressure of light waves on Galileo's eyeball" - since on his Davidson-derived account the strong descriptivist yields no hostages to the realist by accepting the "hardness" of brute sensory stimuli. Indeed, it is a useful line to adopt when confronted with the usual sort of realist counter argument which appeals to the massive self-evidence of certain facts about our cognitive capacities vis-a-vis the physical world. However, it is a point of no consequence, he thinks, when we get beyond the level of bare sense data or causal "impacts" to the stage where this debate becomes relevant, that is, where those data are subject to various belief-related construals or interpretations. For one can then be as "realist" as one likes about the phys ical stimuli and cognate goings-on at our nerve ends - or even (maybe) in our cerebral cortex - and yet put the case that there exist as many ways of interpreting "the evidence" as there exist multiple divergent views of just what that evidence is evidence for. Thus, concerning the impact on Galileo's eyeball, "[t]he astronomers of Padua took it as merely one more anomaly which had somehow to be worked into a more or less Aristotelian cosmology, while Galileo's admirers took it as shattering the crystalline spheres once and for all" (Rorty 1991, 81). For Rorty, this argument amounts to no more than a straightforward consequence of Davidson's point that reality is always "under a descrip tion" insofar as we can have any knowledge or experience of it (Rorty 1986). Experience must itself be subject to perceptual-cognitive process ing of some sort if it is actually to count as "experience," as distinct from just a bare causal input devoid of any meaningful content or intelligible structure. What Rorty makes of this Davidsonian (though also residually Kantian) line of argument is something that has worried Davidson on and off, though at times he appears ready to accept it with minor qualifications (see, for instance, Davidson 1990a and 1990b; also Norris 1988). To Kant it would have seemed wholly unacceptable since it opens the way to a form of strong-descriptivist or cultural-linguistic-constructivist thinking which goes clean against Kant's insistence that objective knowledge is a world well lost just so long as we possess intersubjective (transcendentally justi fied) norms of valid understanding. For Rorty, this idea of transcendental warrant is one that we can well do without, since it prevents us from seeing that what counts as "valid" in the space of reasons is valid only by the lights of some particular interpretive community with its own knowledge constitutive interests, values, and beliefs. That he pushes this position to the limits (and beyond) of rational intel ligibility is a case that I have argued at length elsewhere (Norris 1997). It should perhaps be seen as something of a virtue in Rorty's writings since it helps to show what is problematic about other, less extreme versions of the doctrine, such as those propounded by Quine and Davidson. Thus © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 2000</page><page sequence="9">390 CHRISTOPHER NORRIS McDowell confesses himself "not in a position to dissent outright from Rorty's reading of Davidson," although he draws a very different (indeed flatly opposite) conclusion as regards the chief lesson that philosophers should learn from this whole recent chapter of debate. On his account, "Davidson's vulnerability to the dualism [i.e., that between causal theories of belief acquisition and holistic/coherence-based theories of rational belief adjustment] is a defect; it is out of line with his better thinking on interpretation, and it ensures failure in the aim of exorcising traditional philosophical anxieties" (153). Rorty, by contrast, "centres his reading of Davidson on the dualism, and he applauds it as what it exactly is not, a way to escape from the obsessions of traditional philosophy" (153-54). For this dualism leaves Davidson's approach stranded in just the kind of anxiety provoking predicament that prompted his criticism of Quine and which Rorty is able to exploit for his own purposes without any such anxiety, but also (it seems) without much sense of the problems that quite justifiably give rise to it. In short, what is needed, according to McDowell, is a new way of conceiving the relationship between receptivity and spontaneity, or between what is in some sense "given" to understanding through the mani fold of sensuous or phenomenal intuitions, and what is contributed to it by our powers of rational or justificatory thought. To put the case in these terms is, of course, a bad mistake from McDow ell's point of view, since they invoke yet another variant of the same old rationalist/empiricist, scheme/content, or active/passive dichotomy. What remains to be seen is whether his proposed Kantian solution is able to deliver the required outcome without reproducing that dichotomy over again, or without repeating certain episodes in Kant's continental reception history - early and late - which McDowell would surely consider too heavy a cost to be borne. I shall therefore now examine his arguments in more detail with a view to establishing just how far the solution can be made to work. Between Kant and Hegel In his reading of the First Critique, McDowell focuses on just those claims that have seemed most crucial to well-disposed commentators and most problematical to others. These latter include not only Anglophone philoso phers of a marked empiricist bent (such as J. L. Mackie [1974] and, ironi cally, Norman Kemp Smith, who produced the standard translation [Kant 1964]), but also thinkers in the continental line - from Fichte to Heidegger - who have proposed various strong-revisionist or heterodox readings of Kant in response to the same interpretative problems. Chief among them is that of explaining how Kant brings off - or why he fails to bring off - his argument for the linkage between sensuous intuitions (or receptive "experience") and the various conceptual forms or modalities which render such experience humanly intelligible. This is also the crux of © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 2000</page><page sequence="10">Mcdowell on kant 391 McDowell's case for looking to Kant in hopes of deliverance from the dilemmas of latter-day empiricism and the failed attempts to resolve them by philosophers like Quine and Davidson. It involves Kant's claim - endorsed by McDowell - that we can make no sense of experience and knowledge except on the assumption that they are bound up together in every exercise or act of rational judgement. McDowell prefers to use the terms receptivity and spontaneity since these pose the issue in a nonstandard (at any rate locally unfamiliar) idiom which makes a point of their Kantian provenance while also, just as point edly, avoiding talk of sense data, stimuli, conceptual schemes, or other such stock items of dualist parlance. "The original Kantian thought," he writes, was that empirical knowledge results from a co-operation between receptivity and spontaneity. (Here "spontaneity" can be simply a label for the involvement of conceptual capacities.) We can dismount from the seesaw if we can achieve a firm grip on this thought: receptivity does not make an even notionally sepa rable contribution to the co-operation. (9) What McDowell means by the "seesaw" is that chronic back-and-forth swing between passive and active, content and scheme, inert sensory "data" and organising concepts, that typified logical empiricism and that persists in the work of those thinkers - Quine and Davidson among them - who have tried and failed to dismount. The only way out of this fix, he thinks, is to break altogether with the dualist paradigm and recognise that experience is always already structured by conceptual form, this form being that which precedes and makes possible every act of judgement. Thus receptivity and spontaneity are aspects of one and the selfsame process through which we gain knowledge of the world. Quine and David son both go wrong through adopting a causal theory of belief acquisition which conceives of bare "sensory inputs" on the one hand and on the other an evaluative "space of reasons" where coherence - rather than epistemic warrant - is the ultimate court of appeal. But this has the unfortunate result of creating such a radical split between "intuitions" and "concepts" that no amount of terminological tinkering can put them back together. Rather, McDowell suggests, "we should understand what Kant calls 'intu ition' - experiential intake - not as a bare getting of an extra-conceptual Given, but as a kind of occurrence or state that already has conceptual content" (9). Once this is understood then the problem disappears, or at any rate it can be seen as merely the product of one particular (philosophically mistaken) way of presenting the issue. Here again it is a matter of follow ing through on Kant's cardinal dictum that "thoughts without content are empty," while "intuitions without concepts are blind." In recent Anglo phone philosophy - as McDowell reads it - this dilemma has most often © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 2000</page><page sequence="11">392 CHRISTOPHER NORRIS worked out as either a coherence-based theory of "rational" justification, in which beliefs float free of any causal or epistemic grounding, or a theory of causally determined belief content, in which reasons and judgements have no role to play. What we need to understand is that each of these tendencies results from a reactive fear that the other will destroy the whole enterprise of epistemology if allowed to run its full course. Thus philoso phers who place the main emphasis on spontaneity - on the mind's contri bution to experience through acts of reflective judgement or rational-evaluative thought - tend to come out very strongly against any notion of causal constraints. Conversely, philosophers of a different (more physicalist or externalist) persuasion very often tend to assume that any qualified version of the causal account which allows for the exercise of judgement at an early stage in this process must thereby cut knowledge adrift from its anchoring to features of a truly objective, mind-independent world. In McDowell's words: It can be difficult to accept that the Myth of the Given is a myth.... It can seem that we are retaining a role for spontaneity but refusing to acknowledge any role for receptivity, and that is intolerable. If our activity in empirical thought and judgement is to be recognizable as bearing on reality at all, there must be external constraint. There must be a role for receptivity as well as spontaneity, for sensibility as well as understanding. Realizing this, we come under pressure to recoil back into appealing to the Given, only to see over again that it cannot help. There is a danger of falling into an interminable oscillation. (8-9) This applies equally to those, like Davidson, who try to keep both perspec tives in play by offering a causal (reductively physicalist) account of the mind-world relation so far as concerns the immediate "data" of sensory perceptual experience, while decreeing that no such constraints apply when it comes to the context of justification, where causal factors are wholly irrelevant since beliefs relate only to other beliefs. What this gives us is truly the worst of both worlds: a basic theory of knowledge acquisi tion devoid of normative criteria, and a normative-justificatory theory devoid of experiential input. We need to get off the seesaw, McDowell thinks, but to do so without tipping it in either direction or merely holding a precarious balance by piling up the weight at each end without any prospect of sustainable equi librium. Indeed, one purpose of his book "is to bring out how difficult it is to see that we can have both desiderata: both rational constraint from the world and spontaneity all the way out" (8 n. 7). McDowell's phrasing here is carefully chosen and shows how far he is willing to go - albeit without acknowledgement - along the route marked out by various post-Kantian continental schools of thought. The phrase "rational constraint from the world" is crucially ambiguous as between (1) the moderate (epistemolog ical-realist) claim that the world exerts constraints upon the process of rational belief formation and (2) the alternative (distinctly Hegelian) idea © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 2000</page><page sequence="12">Mcdowell on kant 393 that in some sense "the real is the rational," that is, that spontaneity indeed goes "all the way out" beyond our perceptual engagement with the world to the world itself as somehow inherently adapted to our powers of ratio nal thought and judgement. Of course, this may seem an absurdly large exegetical weight to place on one, maybe unrepresentative item of local phraseology. However, there are numerous passages elsewhere in McDow ell's book that exhibit the same ambiguity, such as "I am trying to describe a way of maintaining that in experience the world exerts a rational influ ence on our thinking" (34). And again: "[w]e need to conceive this expan sive spontaneity as subject to control from outside our thinking, on pain of representing the operations of spontaneity as a frictionless spinning in a void" (11). But in that case, it might well be asked, how can this "control" be in any way exerted on the mind's "spontaneous" operations unless through some order of pre-given fit - not to say preordained harmony - between rational-evaluative judgements on the one hand and on the other a world which somehow lends itself to just such forms of judgement? For if spontaneity can be thought of as "expansive" to the extent that McDow ell requires, that is, as stretching out from mind to world in a way that over comes all those vexing antinomies, then the world must also be conceived as answering (via the mind's receptivity) to whatever we can know or whatever experiential judgements we can form concerning it. In short, there is as much of Hegel as of Kant in McDowell's continental turn, not least his resolute attack (following Sellars [1956]) on the "Myth of the Given," his insistence on the always already mediated character of percep tual experience, and again - most strikingly - his various suggestions that in some sense "the real is the rational." Though McDowell nowhere (to my knowledge) cites this dictum, it is a claim very much implicit in his "turn" toward Hegel as a means of overcoming the residual antinomies still present in his reading of Kant. Some commentators - Rorty (1998b) among them - have taken McDowell at his word about the centrality of Kantian arguments to his enterprise, and have hence failed to notice that his reading of Kant is decid edly Hegelian in character. This enables Rorty to play him off against a thinker like Robert Brandom, who is far more explicit about his own debt to Hegel and who thus strikes Rorty as moving much further in the right direction - that is, away from the hopeless enterprise of Kantian "meta physics" and toward a sensible pragmatist acceptance that "reality" and "truth" are simply what count as such according to our own interpretative lights (Brandom 1994; Rorty 1998a). Indeed, McDowell pays a handsome tribute to Brandom, acknowledging the latter's "eye-opening seminar" on Hegel, ideas from which "show up explicitly at a couple of places in these lectures," though "[their] effect is pervasive; so much so that one way I would like to conceive this work is as a prolegomenon to a reading of the Phenomenology" (ix). Now I think that Rorty is right - in one sense - to take this acknowledgement at somewhat less than face value and to play up © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 2000</page><page sequence="13">394 CHRISTOPHER NORRIS the Kantian as against the Hegelian aspects of McDowell's argument. For there are, as we have seen, crucial points in that argument (chiefly his refurbishing of the spontaneity/receptivity paradigm) which derive quite explicitly from Kant and would find nothing like the same degree of support from Hegel's historicised recasting of Kantian themes. On the other hand, Rorty is wrong, it seems to me, in his notion that McDowell's project miscarries - or shows itself irrelevant to current needs - by offer ing us a pre-Hegelian Kant and hence just another rerun of problems that have continued to plague philosophy in the recent analytic tradition. McDowell himself appears to be pulled both ways in the above-cited passage of acknowledgement, where his vague talk of "pervasive influ ence" and the idea of his book as a "prolegomenon" to some future read ing of Hegel must be set against the fact of that influence showing through only "at a couple of places." What this indicates, I think, is that McDowell needs Kant - a non-Hegelianised version of Kant - in order for his argu ment to possess any genuine force against those various forms of scheme/content dualism which he finds endemic in present-day thinking. Hegel will not do, at least for this purpose, because Hegel's way of over coming such dualisms (like Rorty's after him) is to treat them as merely contingent on some particular transient phase in the history of thought (Rorty 1982a, 1982b). However, as McDowell remarks about Rorty, "culti vating a non-obsessive tone of voice isn't enough to show that philosoph ical obsessions are out of place" (154). For it is evident from much of what McDowell has to say about these issues concerning mind, world, and the problem of knowledge that he does not believe they can simply be dissolved by any such emollient strategy as Rorty proposes or indeed by any purely therapeutic treatment in the late-Wittgensteinian mode. They are real issues in the sense that they arise with a certain ineluctable force not only for Kant and thinkers in the post-Kantian continental tradition, but also for those - McDowell included - who write from a standpoint deeply informed by analytic interests and priorities, even while seeking some alternative ground from which to address them. The chief problem lies in that link between sensuous intuitions and concepts of understanding which Kant claims to demonstrate on a priori grounds, or by way of a transcendental deduction from the conditions of possibility for experience and knowledge in general. Such arguments have mostly cut little ice with analytic philosophers, at least those on the empiri cist wing who regard them as so much otiose metaphysical machinery. For others, like Strawson, they have appeared capable of a scaled-down, natu ralised, or purely "descriptive" treatment that lops off the various tran scendental excrescences while preserving enough of the basic Kantian structure to make sense of our being in the world as spatially located and temporally existent persons with certain well-defined cognitive capacities. Still, there is a marked tendency among Anglo-American philosophers, especially those influenced by logical empiricism, to take up the argument © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 2000</page><page sequence="14">Mcdowell on kant 395 where Kant left it in the "Transcendental Analytic" of the First Critique, rather than attending closely to those obscure yet suggestive passages in the "Transcendental Aesthetic" which have captured the interest of conti nental thinkers from Fichte to Heidegger. Nor is this preference at all surprising given the problems that typically arise for exegetes of an analytic mind when they attempt to construe Kant's theory of Imagination as the mediating power that somehow (via the schematisms) achieves the seemingly impossible task of reconciling two such disparate realms as those of intuition and concept. If McDowell is an exception to the general rule, then this reflects the very different aim and scope of his project in returning to Kant. As he sees it, "[t]he idea of a faculty of spontaneity is the idea of something that empowers us to take charge of our lives" (43). And again, more specifi cally: Kant points the way to a position in which we can satisfyingly apply that idea to empirical thinking: we can hold that empirical inquiry is a region of our lives in which we exercise a responsible freedom, and not let that thought threaten to dislodge our grip on the requirement that empirical thinking be under constraint from the world itself. (43) In other words, McDowell wants something more from the Kantian notion of spontaneity than a means of bridging that problematic gulf between intuitions and concepts. What he thinks it can provide - again following Kant - is a theory of mind that would reconcile the claims of empiricism and rationalism, experience and judgement, understanding and reason, or even (as the above passage appears to suggest) determinism and free will. For it is precisely McDowell's reiterated point that these claims will seem to be in conflict only if we take the kind of reductionist view that drives a wedge between empirical "data" and the "space of reasons," or which finds no room for the "exercise [of] responsible freedom" with respect to the kinds of empirical enquiry that are "under constraint from the world itself." Then again, it may seem that these conflicts can be resolved only by adopt ing a stipulative double-aspect theory which maintains, like Davidson and Rorty, that causal accounts of belief acquisition and rational accounts of belief adjustment are necessarily "under different descriptions," and hence that such issues simply cannot (or should not) arise. McDowell thinks that Kant offers the best way out of this unfortunate choice between reduction ist dilemmas and evasive pseudosolutions. He does so by conceiving knowledge as a product of the interplay between receptivity and spontane ity, each of which partakes sufficiently of the other to avoid any such ulti mate stalemate. More than that, Kant's theory points us toward a conception of "respon sible" enquiry in two senses of the term: properly responsive to the kinds of empirical constraints exerted by a world that is not of our own concep tual or linguistic making, but responsible also to the exercise of reason as © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 2000</page><page sequence="15">396 CHRISTOPHER NORRIS a faculty free to judge and evaluate the evidence by normative standards that cannot be reduced to bare products of the causal interaction between world and mind. After all, "if those [causal] impingements are conceived as outside the scope of spontaneity, outside the domain of responsible free dom, then the best they can yield is that we cannot be blamed for believ ing whatever they lead us to believe, not that we are justified in believing it" (13). And this applies also in the ethical sphere, where the same sorts of problems typically arise through a failure to see how experience and judge ment - or factual and evaluative modes of enquiry - might exist in a mutu ally responsive rather than a sharply dichotomous relationship. Here again the way forward (as McDowell sees it) is to recognise the extent to which spontaneity both contributes to, and is shaped by, our various receptive capacities. For we shall then be unimpressed by Humean arguments requiring a disjunction between fact and value, or indeed by any Kantian claim that ethical "responsibility" involves the kind of freedom that can be exercised only in the absence of all empirical constraints. Rather, we shall see no obstacle to adopting an outlook of ethical realism according to which there exist certain "rational requirements" that are "there in any case, whether or not we are responsive to them," but that allow us to become more responsive (and responsible) as "our eyes are opened to the very existence of this tract of the space of reasons" (82). Thereafter, McDowell continues, "our appreciation of its detailed layout is indefinitely subject to refinement, in reflective scrutiny of our ethical thinking" (82). Thus there is no sharp divide between epistemology and ethics, any more than between fact and value, receptivity and spontaneity, or between the realm of (so-called) sensory inputs and the space of justificatory reasons. In each case, the thought of that divide comes about through a falsely reductionist picture which finds no room for reflective judgement in the realm of empirical knowledge and no room for empirical constraints upon knowledge in the realm of reflective judgement. Naturalising Kant: Epistemology and Ethics So far I have been summarising McDowell's argument and giving just a few undeveloped hints as to where it might run into problems. What I propose to do now is draw out some of those problems with reference both to Kant (or his own very partial and selective reading of Kant) and also to McDowell's handling of issues that have figured more prominently in recent continental debate. With respect to Kant, the main difficulty is that McDowell takes a broadly naturalistic line, rejecting a large part of Kant's transcendental doctrine while nonetheless making use of that doctrine - or a scaled-down version of it - when required. Thus he writes: "[w]e need to recapture the Aristotelian idea that a normal mature human being is a rational animal, but without losing the Kantian idea that rationality operates freely in its © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 2000</page><page sequence="16">Mcdowell on kant 397 own sphere" (85). For the trouble with Aristotelian ethics is that it goes too far in a naturalist direction, deriving moral virtues from "what comes natu rally" either to human creatures with their various needs, desires, instinc tual capacities, and so on, or to social beings whose "nature" it is to pursue certain aims and interests in keeping with the communal mores of their own time and place. Such thinking finds no room for any genuine (Kant ian) conflict between custom and moral will, and can hence be seen as a placid endorsement of those various repugnant institutional practices, such as slavery and massive sexual inequality, which existed in fourth-century B.C. Athens. Thus, according to McDowell, "Aristotle scarcely even considers that doubts might arise about the specific ethical outlook he takes for granted" (80). However, there is no good reason to suppose that "this shows confidence that he could validate the demands of that ethical outlook by appealing to nature" (80). What accounts for this harsh verdict, McDowell thinks, is that we have inherited a view of "nature" which cuts it off completely from the "space of reasons" (or the realm of evaluative justificatory thought) as a result of developments in modern science and its associated physicalist worldview, which required just such a sharp demar cation. So it is that present-day readers interpret Aristotelian ethics as a kind of "bald naturalism," an "attempt to construct the requirements of ethics out of independent facts about human nature" (79). Only from our own "disenchanted" perspective on nature - one that removes it altogether from the normative sphere - must this strike us as a blatant example of the naturalistic fallacy. Otherwise, we should see that Aristotle's appeal to nature "shows his immunity to our metaphysical anxieties; he is simply not vulnerable to the sort of worries such a conception would address." If it also shows "something less interesting," namely, a certain "tendency to smugness," then that is something "for which we can easily correct" (80-81). The correction is supplied by Kant and consists in taking his point about the capacity of practical reason to stand outside the realm of "merely" natural instinct or communal mores and to apply more-exacting standards of ethical accountability. This is, I think, what McDowell means - in the passage cited above - when he suggests that we combine the Aristotelian idea "that a normal mature human being is a rational animal" with the Kantian idea "that rationality operates freely in its own sphere" (85). However, McDowell cannot accept this improved picture at the cost of embracing Kant's doctrine of freedom as exercised by a purely "supersen sible" faculty of reason, one that somehow exerts its powers altogether outside and beyond the realm of empirical knowledge and experience. To do so would be to fall straight back into the dualist way of thinking espoused by Davidson and Rorty and, moreover, to endorse a version of it that raises the supposed separation of realms into a high point of transcen dental doctrine. Such is the "threat of supernaturalism" that looms "if we interpret the claim that the space of reasons is sui generis as a refusal to © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 2000</page><page sequence="17">398 CHRISTOPHER NORRIS naturalize the requirements of reason" (78). However, it is hard to see how McDowell can represent Kantian thinking as an advance over Aristotle's theory - a "correction" to its somewhat parochial standards of rational and ethical judgement - if the only reading of Kant that exerts any claim on our present-day interest is a naturalised reading which leaves no room for precisely those elements in Kant's epistemology and ethics which set them apart from Aristotle. According to McDowell, this objection presupposes yet another of those false dualisms which result from our having inherited a certain mindset - what he calls "the intelligible grip on our thinking of a modern naturalism" - wherein "nature" is conceived as a realm of implacably determinist causal explanations, and "reason" as a space of autonomous judgement which stands quite apart from such empirical constraints. Indeed, the whole point of McDowell's argument is to make the case for Kant as a philosopher who managed to think his way beyond this unfortunate turn in subsequent (post-Kantian) theories of mind, knowledge, and representation. Still, there is a problem for McDowell - one that he never gets clearly into focus - insofar as Kant's claim to have achieved this result depends very heavily on just those kinds of transcen dental reasoning which McDowell hopes to dispense with in pursuit of a moderately "naturalist" interpretation. That is to say, if there is anything in Kant's theory that offers a solution, then it must be achievable on the scaled-down (detranscendentalised) terms of reference that McDowell proposes by way of an answer to current philosophical problems. However, as I shall now proceed to argue, this solution runs into problems of its own which cannot be resolved on any such naturalistic terms. McDowell thinks that Kant "comes within a whisker" of achieving the wished-for deliverance. He does so by providing an alternative to the chronic oscillation that sets in when philosophy ignores the reciprocal exchange of receptivity and spontaneity within every act of judgement. Indeed, "[i]f it were not for the transcendental framework, we could credit Kant with a clear formulation of that insight" (43). But this insight is obscured, McDowell believes, by Kant's recidivist talk of a "supersensi ble" (or noumenal) reality thought of as existing beyond the realm of phenomenal experience and knowledge. In this perspective, as McDowell describes it, receptivity comes to assume a quite different and altogether more mysterious role, one that involves "a susceptibility to the impact of a supersensible reality, a reality that is supposed to be independent of our conceptual activity in a stronger sense than any that fits the ordinary empir ical world" (41). In that case, of course, it fails to explain how the faculties of experience, knowledge, and judgement could ever be conjoined through the kind of interactive or mutually sustaining relationship that McDowell's argument requires. For receptivity would then have to be construed in experience-transcendent terms, that is to say, as a power of thought whose boundary is defined with reference to a "supersensible" realm - a noume nal reality beyond the furthest reach of human cognitive grasp - and not © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 2000</page><page sequence="18">Mcdowell on kant 399 with reference to the "ordinary world" of empirically attainable knowl edge. In such a frame, McDowell writes, Kant's "liberating thought cannot take proper shape" (42), since the result is to create yet another separation of realms which decrees that understanding can have no access to the conditions of possibility for its own exercise. That separation leads to the Kantian idea of "man" - in Foucault's famous description - as a strange "empirical-transcendental doublet," a bifurcated creature whose attempts at self-knowledge seem always predestined to oscillate between a natu ralised description devoid of normative content (since it is outside the "space of reasons") and a normative theory cut loose from any anchorage in the nature of knowledge and experience (Foucault 1973). The main problem for McDowell is that he cannot entirely jettison this aspect of Kant's thinking if he wants to make good his crucial claim about the joint operation of spontaneity and receptivity in the act of judgement. The following passage brings out the conceptual strain imposed on his argument by this effort to naturalise (or detranscendentalise) Kantian philosophy while retaining what is needed in order to resist the encroach ments of a thoroughly naturalistic worldview that would leave no room for rational-evaluative thought. "Once the supersensible is in the picture," McDowell writes, its radical independence of our thinking tends to present itself as no more than the independence any genuine reality must have. The empirical world's claim to independence comes to seem fraudulent by comparison. We are asked to suppose that the fundamental structure of the empirical world is somehow a product of subjectivity, in interaction with supersensible reality, which, as soon as it is in the picture, strikes us as the seat of true objectivity. But how can the empirical world be genuinely independent of us, if we are partly responsible for its fundamental structure? It does not help to be told that it is only transcen dentally speaking that the fundamental structure of the empirical world is of our making. (42) This strikes me as a good brief statement of the well-known problems with Kant's claim to have somehow reconciled his twin doctrines of "transcen dental idealism" and "empirical realism." That is, it brings out the logical conflict that necessarily arises between them, given his argument that the conditions of possibility for knowledge and experience in general must be thought of as deriving from a realm of "supersensible" reality quite beyond reach of any knowledge we could have concerning those same conditions. McDowell's diagnosis is strongly borne out by the evidence of later attempts to adopt Kant's theory - or some version of it - while maintain ing an avowedly realist approach despite relativist or constructivist appear ances. Thus all we need do, on this account, is acknowledge the basic (Kantian) point that "reality" insofar as we can possibly know it is always relative to some given paradigm, language game, conceptual scheme, onto logical framework, or whatever. Among recent arguments of the kind one © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 2000</page><page sequence="19">400 CHRISTOPHER NORRIS might instance Hilary Putnam's theory of "internal realism," offered very much as a pragmatist update on familiar Kantian themes (Putnam 1987, 1990). For the only alternative, he thinks, is to endorse some form of "metaphysical" realism which would have it that ascriptions of truth or knowledge must involve the appeal to an objective, external, mind-inde pendent reality. Such arguments are held to collapse at the sceptic's light est touch since there seems, after all, a flat contradiction between the idea of reality as mind-independent (or, in the terms of more recent debate, "recognition transcendent") and the claim that we can somehow know this to be the case. (For some highly relevant and perceptive discussion of these issues, see Grayling 1985 and Williams 1996.) Thus realism is a self-refut ing doctrine whose very formulation, the sceptic argues, is enough to make the point beyond reasonable doubt. At any rate this has been a constant refrain among antirealists of various stripes, along with "internal" (quasi-) realists like Putnam and framework relativists such as Quine. Of course, that argument will fail to convince any realist who upholds the priority of ontological over epistemological issues, or who thinks it a perfectly reasonable (indeed rationally inescapable) claim that the world exists and possesses certain features, properties, attributes, causal powers, and so on, quite apart from - and independently of - our current best beliefs concerning it (Alston 1996; Devitt 1986). From this point of view the antirealist is merely trading on a regular confusion between (1) the ontological version of the claim as set forth in the previous sentence and (2) the claim that we can actually know just what it is that renders those beliefs false, partial, or destined for eventual replacement. No doubt this latter version of the argument is self-refuting in just the way that the anti realist thinks. That is, it involves the kind of flagrant performative contra diction involved in saying: "I know or believe X but also know that X is (or may be) false for the following reasons." Moreover, it runs into all the usual (antirealist) objections deployed against theories which seem to entail a knowledge - a specific knowledge - of truths or objective states of affairs which the realist nonetheless holds to transcend our present best beliefs or powers of understanding (Dummett 1978; Luntley 1988; Tennant 1987; Wright 1993). But this is not at all what the realist wants, or at any rate should want, to claim. Rather, he or she is making the case that there are (indeed must be) a great many candidate items - historical facts, scientific laws, the truth (or falsehood) of certain mathematical theorems or logical conjectures - which are "recognition transcendent" in the strictly ontological (nonepistemic) sense. That is to say, their validity is a matter of objective, belief-independent truth and is therefore in no way affected or rendered indeterminate by our happening not to possess the requisite means of proof or verification. To claim this much, the realist will argue, is no more than to endorse a duly modest estimate of our own present state of knowledge and to accept that it must always stand to be corrected by possible future advances and discoveries (Bhaskar 1986; Devitt 1986; © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 2000</page><page sequence="20">Mcdowell on kant 401 Leplin 1984; Popper 1983; Rescher 1987). From the antirealist viewpoint, conversely, this "argument from error" works out as a lesson in the nonavailability of any grounds, reasons, evidential criteria, and so on, that could possibly count against our current beliefs or secure the appeal to a realm of objective, recognition-transcendent truths. For the fact that we are always in the position of relying on just such evidential criteria means that it simply cannot make sense to posit a realm of truth values above and beyond what we currently (truly) believe to be the case. Antirealism of this sort has mostly been derived from a logico-linguis tic thesis having to do with the lack of warranted assertability conditions for statements belonging to the "disputed class," that is, the class for which we possess no decisive means of verification or adequate proof procedure (see especially Dummett 1978). Such statements are nonbivalent (neither true nor false) insofar as we are simply not placed to decide the issue on any evidence currently to hand or - in the case of mathematical or logical theorems - any method of checking them out for every possible conse quence. However, as the realist will quickly respond, this argument itself has the awkward consequence that enquirers - whether mathematicians working on some as-yet-unproven theorem or historians attempting to establish some as-yet-unsubstantiated claim - must be thought of (absurdly) as not knowing what it is they are attempting to prove or what would count as an adequate piece of corroborative evidence. To escape this conundrum one has to suppose, and not merely as a matter of contingent psychological need, that statements of the "disputed class" can (indeed must) have truth conditions that transcend one's presently limited knowl edge or powers of conceptual grasp. In that case realism with respect to objective, belief-independent truth values turns out to be a built-in presup position for every field of enquiry where there exist well-defined criteria of method, evidence, validity, or proof. Of course, my presentation of the issues here has moved rapidly over some difficult and highly contentious philosophical ground. All the same, it may serve to emphasise their provenance in Kant's theory of knowledge and also their bearing on the kinds of difficulties that McDowell gets into by adopting a Kantian epistemological approach. For it is a curious feature of McDowell's book that it lays most stress on just those aspects of Kant's thinking - in particular his dual account of receptivity and spontaneity - which have opened the way (despite and against his avowed purpose) to various forms of framework-internalist, ontological-relativist, or down right antirealist argument. No doubt McDowell is entirely faithful to Kant's intentions when he puts the case that this dualism exists only in appearance, that is, as a result of Kant's having to use two distinct terms in order to describe what goes on in the jointly passive-and-active process of experiential judgement. Indeed, this is why McDowell advises a careful rereading of those passages in the First Critique which point a way beyond the various kinds of residual scheme/content dichotomies that are still © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 2000</page><page sequence="21">402 CHRISTOPHER NORRIS present in Quine, Davidson, and others despite their claims (ironically enough) to have broken altogether with such old-fashioned "Kantian" ways of thought. What is required, quite simply, is a "domestication" or a further Strawsonian scaling down of Kant's transcendental framework so as to bring it more within the compass of a naturalised epistemology which nonetheless takes adequate account of the active role of judgement in knowledge and experience. If this means interpreting Kant somewhat against the grain - rejecting his idea of the "supersensible" and replacing it with ordinary (everyday empirical) knowledge - then, McDowell thinks, it is a small price to pay for so signal an advance. Still, one may doubt whether this advance can be had without either pushing the case so far in a revisionist direction that it has no use for the Kantian support structure, or else retaining so much of that structure that it replicates all the above mentioned problems, among them - notably - the problem of reconciling Kant's "transcendental idealism" with his "empirical realism." In that case McDowell's cornerstone appeal to the jointly operative faculties of recep tivity and spontaneity would seem little more than a roundabout version of the same dualist approach that he finds still present in the work of philoso phers such as Quine and Davidson. The trouble is partly, as I have said, that the passages which Kant devotes to this topic are themselves extremely opaque and tend to put up increasing resistance under the kind of pressure that McDowell brings to bear in his attempt to naturalise Kantian epistemology. As a result, there are various divergent interpretations, some of which - following Heideg ger - treat those passages as texts for commentary in the depth-hermeneu tical mode, while others regard them as exhibiting confusions that vitiate Kant's entire project, and still others - like McDowell - set out to provide justificatory arguments on a selective (rational-reconstructive) basis. But this strategy has some chance of success only if Kant can be shown to have been wrong in at least one crucial respect, namely, his idea that any viable defence of empirical realism needs to invoke transcendental arguments from the conditions of possibility for knowledge and experience, argu ments involving the appeal to a realm of "supersensible" (noumenal) real ity which cannot itself be subject to those same conditions. McDowell is perfectly aware of this problem, but thinks that it poses no ultimate obstacle to his project of reclaiming Kantian metaphysics for the purpose at hand. Thus he says: Kant also has a transcendental story, and in the transcendental perspective there does seem to be an isolable contribution from receptivity. In the transcendental perspective, receptivity figures as a susceptibility to the impact of a supersen sible reality, a reality that is supposed to be independent of our conceptual activity in a stronger sense than any that fits the ordinary empirical world. (41) However, according to McDowell, we can safely ignore this whole "super sensible" dimension of Kantian metaphysics if we just make allowance for © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 2000</page><page sequence="22">Mcdowell on kant 403 the sorts of worries that Kant took over from the previous history of ratio nalist versus empiricist debate. We can then propose a revisionist reading of Kant which avoids that whole pointless controversy, along with various dilemmas confronted by thinkers such as Quine and Davidson. "If we restrict ourselves to the standpoint of experience itself," he writes, what we find in Kant is precisely the picture I have been recommending: a picture in which reality is not located outside a boundary that encloses the conceptual sphere.... The fact that experience involves receptivity ensures the required constraint from outside thinking and judging. But since the deliver ances of receptivity already draw on capacities that belong to spontaneity, we can coherently suppose that the constraint is rational; that is how the picture avoids the pitfall of the Given. (41) There is good Kantian warrant, therefore, for the kind of position that McDowell wishes to adopt just so long as we acknowledge the redundant (non-load-bearing) character of all that talk about "conditions of possibil ity," "supersensible" reality, and so forth. We can then see that Kant was well along the path to a theory that reintegrated mind and world by dispensing with the Myth of the Given - an inertly empiricist conception of knowledge - while avoiding the rationalist error that allowed reason to float free in a realm of empirically unanchored concepts. Alternative Resources What is so odd about McDowell's book is the impression it gives of venturing into regions of thought which Kant opened up (albeit with certain unfortunate distractions en route), but which were then left largely unexplored until now. One gets the same feeling from other recent essays in the analytic/continental crossover mode, such as Dummett's acknowl edgement that Husserl might after all have some useful things to say about philosophy of language and logic, despite the fixed belief among many thinkers in the Anglo-American tradition since Ryle that phenomenology could amount to no more than a species of disguised psychologism (Dummett 1993; Ryle 1971a, 1971b, 1971c). At any rate, there is now a growing sense that this suspicion of "mentalist" talk in whatever guise may well have been pushed too far and resulted in just the kinds of problems that McDowell sets out to address. Among them, notably, is that of providing an intelligible theory of the mind-world relationship which avoids the twin perils - as he sees them - of a blank empiricism totally devoid of rational-evaluative content and a purebred rationalism that takes no account of the empirical constraints upon our exercise of judgement with respect to knowledge and experience. It is here, I would suggest, that Husserlian phenomenology has a strong claim to provide a more adequate approach than anything offered on the terms laid down by analytic philosophy in the Fregean line of descent © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 2000</page><page sequence="23">404 CHRISTOPHER NORRIS (Husserl 1969, 1970, 1973a, 1973b). For that tradition is marked chiefly by its steadfast insistence that "concepts" must be taken to exist in a realm of absolute ideal objectivity quite distinct from the actual thought processes which transpire in the consciousness of individual thinkers, even if these latter are aimed toward just such concepts and cannot be distinguished in point of "intentional" content. Husserl would not have rejected this claim, much concerned as he was - especially when treating of arithmetic, geom etry, and the natural sciences - to distinguish such objective (transcenden tally valid) truths from the ambient "lifeworld" of cultural and socio-historically emergent beliefs. However, he was also convinced that a phenomenological approach could adequately respect this requirement while nonetheless offering a detailed account of the thought processes or modes of jointly intuitive-conceptual "genesis" through which those truths came to light. To adopt such a method, Frege argued, was to fall into mere "psychol ogism" and hence yield up any claim to be concerned with issues of objec tive (mind-independent) logical truth and falsehood, rather than with matters pertaining to the sphere of subjective (non-truth-evaluable) processes, events, or representations (Frege 1972). Worse still, it encour aged a tendency to suppose that the genesis of thoughts - whether in the individual mind or through some long-term historical sequence of devel opments and discoveries - could have a bearing on the strictly objective question of their truth or falsehood. This is the problem that Husserl engages in his essay "The Origin of Geometry" and in other writings which seek to explain how these two approaches might be reconciled (Husserl 1983). That is, Husserl asks how certain kinds of knowledge (mathematics especially) strike us as possessing precisely that character of a priori, absolute, or noncontingent truth while yet having been arrived at by various historically situated thinkers - from the ancient geometers and mathematicians down - who discovered them through a cumulative process of thought marked out by definite stages of advance. Now it may be the case, as Derrida has strongly argued, that this attempt by Husserl to reconcile the claims of "genesis" and "structure" (or history and "absolute ideal objectivity") is fraught with philosophical problems which cannot be resolved by any simple decision to give equal weight to both kinds of interest (Derrida 1973, 1978a, 1978b). Even so, it is an attempt which can and must be made, since otherwise philosophy will have nothing to say concerning the relation between mind, knowledge, and those historical-genetic ("worldly") conditions of emergence whose exclu sion from its purview results in a form of purely abstract apriorism. On the other hand, this is not to say - as Husserl and Derrida both emphasise - that geometrical or arithmetical discoveries can be treated as merely contingent episodes in a particular (culture-specific) history of thought, or as products of those various individual minds (from Euclid to Riemann or Lobachewski) which were just so placed, or psychologically disposed, to © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackweil Publishers Ltd. 2000</page><page sequence="24">Mcdowell on kant 405 enounce them at this or that time. Rather, we must think of them as genuine discoveries - possessing an objective truth value - and as "mind-indepen dent" at least insofar as their truth transcends any such temporal or localised context of occurrence. Nevertheless - and this is Husserl's main point - our grasp of that truth can be achieved only through certain essen tially repeatable processes of thought which enable us to "reactivate" the original discovery, and hence to comprehend the proof procedure or the form of axiomatic-deductive reasoning by which it was first established. Thus there is no built-in or necessary conflict between a Fregean insis tence on the objectivity of "thoughts" - as distinct from mere subjective "ideas" - and a Husserlian approach that also takes account of their gene sis in certain constitutive acts of mind. This approach, so far from under mining their objective status, alone makes it possible to think of them as valid for any intelligence (like that of Husserl's "original geometer") capa ble of grasping their truth, and hence as necessarily holding good across distances of time, place, historical context, and so forth. My general point is that the history of post-Kantian continental thought has a great deal to offer - more than McDowell seems to realise - by way of improvement upon Kant's theory of mind, knowledge, and experience. For one thing, it has gone much further toward explaining how developments in certain fields - for instance, non-Euclidean geometry and post-Newtonian concep tions of space and time - may involve a break with what Kant treated as forms of synthetic a priori knowledge, and hence as immune from any possible revision in the light of conflicting evidence. Indeed, as J. Alberto Coffa has argued, the most striking aspect of these developments - along with others in philosophy of logic and related disciplines - is the extent to which they have reconfigured the "space of reasons" or the boundaries previously thought to exist between apodictically self-evident truths and empirically determined or a posteriori modes of understanding (Coffa 1991). This would seem to pose a sizeable problem for Husserl, commit ted as he is to the objectivity of geometrical and mathematical knowledge, despite its dependence on the power of thought to "reactivate" knowledge through successive acts of conceptual-intuitive grasp. However, his claim is not that these acts must be repeated each time with an identical content, but rather that they form a historical series whose intelligibility derives from the conditions for understanding precisely how such advances come about in geometry, mathematics, or the physical sciences. Elsewhere - in thinkers like Bachelard and Canguilhem - one finds a more detailed historico-philosophical account of the process by which particular sciences undergo an "epistemological break" that marks their transition from an immature phase (characterised by the dependence on image, metaphor, and anthropomorphic habits of mind) to a stage of more adequate theorization or achieved conceptual grasp (Bachelard 1949, 1969, 1984; Canguilhem 1968, 1969, 1988; also Tiles 1984). This is also, very often, a break with certain deep-seated aprioristic assumptions that © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 2000</page><page sequence="25">406 CHRISTOPHER NORRIS constitute an obstacle to progress by curtailing the freedom of scientific thought to explore other possible (counterintuitive) geometries, transfinite number domains, space-time conceptions, and so on. However, as Bachelard also insists, such advances can be understood only on the basis of a constant dialectic or process of mutual interrogative exchange between the various orders of intuitive, conceptual, and rational-construc tive thought. That is to say, he rejects the Cartesian (or indeed Kantian) appeal to a priori grounds of knowledge conceived as holding good for all time or across all possible transformations in the scope of scientific enquiry. Nevertheless, it is the case, according to Bachelard, that scientific progress cannot come about - or possess any kind of rational intelligibil ity - unless we assume that it manifests an exercise of critical-evaluative thought which finds no place in those approaches typically adopted by philosophers of science in the line of descent from logical empiricism. For the result of such thinking is to impose a veto on any attempt to understand how it was - by what process of reflective self-critical advance - that scientific knowledge managed to transcend the various obstacles placed in its path by the adherence to naive, imagistic, or anthropomorphic concep tions. Thus the problem with Kant is not so much that he brings thought processes into the picture (a standard analytic line of argument against Kant and Husserl alike), but rather that he treats them as unchangeably vested in certain a priori capacities of mind immune from revision come what may in the development of logic, mathematics, or the physical sciences. However, it is a fact which seems to have escaped notice among many analytic philosophers that a good deal of later continental thought - not least that of Husserl and Bachelard - has been aimed toward remedy ing just this defect in the Kantian aprioristic approach to epistemological issues. The other objection most frequently voiced is to just the opposite effect: that phenomenology veers too far from the "absolute ideal objectivity" which pertains to all genuine discoveries or truths in the domain of scien tific knowledge. That is, it yields ground to a cultural-relativist outlook through its excessive concern with the ambient "lifeworld" - the context of received, traditional, or everyday commonsense belief - which is taken to constitute the enabling condition (the background "horizon" of intelligi bility) for more specialised endeavours such as mathematics or the physi cal sciences. Of course, there are areas of the human and social sciences where this has been the dominant understanding of Husserl's work and where allowance for such elements of tacit (nonconceptual or prereflec tive) knowledge is assumed to give warrant for a "strong" hermeneutic approach (Bauman 1978; Garfinkel 1967). Moreover, in some of his later writings, Husserl was apt to stress the extent to which developments in modern (post-Galilean) physical science had effectively concealed this lifeworld dependence through their use of ever more powerful techniques for the mathematisation of nature (Husserl 1970). One can therefore see © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 2000</page><page sequence="26">Mcdowell on kant 407 why the belief has taken hold in some quarters that phenomenology is incapable of providing a sufficiently rigorous approach to issues in episte mology and philosophy of science. Nevertheless, as I have said, this aspect of Husserl's project should be viewed in the context of his larger concern with the relationship between structure and genesis or with the claims of transcendental vis-a-vis descriptive or historical-reconstructive modes of enquiry. For there is no suggestion in his work - despite the lessons that are often drawn from it by disciples of a more Heideggerian bent - that epistemology should henceforth give way to the reign of a universal hermeneutics that relativises "truth" to the currency of some given discourse, language game, or cultural life-form. Indeed, this way of think ing is more characteristic of the Wittgensteinian turn which has come to exert such a potent spell over many philosophers in the broadly analytic tradition. And among the chief reasons for that, I would suggest, is the fail ure to resolve those vexing dilemmas that have surfaced so often in the history of thought from Kant to logical empiricism. In short, there is something decidedly odd about McDowell's call for a return to Kant and his focus on just those aspects of Kant's philosophy which appear most vulnerable in light of subsequent developments. Thus it is hard to see what can possibly be gained by an appeal to Kantian recep tivity and spontaneity if these are treated - following McDowell - as facul ties or powers of mind that necessarily stand to each other in a relationship of perfect mutual adjustment. "This image of openness to reality," he writes, is at our disposal because of how we place the reality that makes its impression on a subject in experience. Although reality is independent of our thinking, it is not to be pictured as outside an outer boundary that encloses the conceptual sphere. That things are thus and so is the conceptual content of an experience, but if the subject of the experience is not misled, that very same thing, that things are thus and so, is also a perceptible fact, an aspect of the perceptible world. (26, emphasis in original) Such is at any rate McDowell's proposal for avoiding those various conceptual dichotomies that have left their mark on the thinking of philosophers such as Quine and Davidson. What they have in common, he argues, is a commitment (however covert or qualified) to the empiricist "Myth of the Given," and hence a failure to conceive how experience and judgement work together in producing our knowledge of the world. This is why they always fall back at some point (despite protestations to the contrary) on a version of the scheme/content dualism or the idea of concepts as somehow "applied" to the raw stuff of sensuous intuitions. Still, one may doubt whether Kant offers much help in this respect given the notorious exegetical problems encountered with those passages of the First Critique where his argument has recourse to Imagination - that "art buried in the depths of the soul" - in order to explain how intuitions are © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 2000</page><page sequence="27">408 CHRISTOPHER NORRIS "brought under" concepts. Nor are these problems in any way resolved by Kant's suggestion that the crucial mediating role is played by the various "schematisms" which Imagination supplies for just that purpose, that is, for ensuring that concepts match up with intuitions or that experience is rendered intelligible through the joint operation of spontaneity and recep tivity. For this is, quite literally, a stopgap solution which engenders an infinite regress, since no amount of further filling in with intermediary functions could accomplish the strictly impossible task of reconciling two such disparate realms as those of "intuition" and "concept" as Kant himself defines them. All the same, McDowell's book has the real virtue of raising these issues in a context of debate - that of post-1950 analytic philosophy of mind, logic, and language - where they have all too often been swept aside in the interests of a narrowly conceived disciplinary rigour. One result is the lack of any adequate theory of judgement that could explain how such "absolute ideal objectivity" (in Husserl's resonant phrase) could possibly lie within the compass of philosophical enquiry or of human understand ing generally. McDowell is very much aware of this problem, as attested by numerous passages of Mind and World. However, by taking no account of developments in the later (post-Kantian) continental tradition - apart from those few brief references to Hegel - he has effectively deprived himself of just the resources that might have offered an alternative, more promising way forward.
