<plain_text><page sequence="1">DNCLASSIFIEDS APPLES HENRY BERRY V&gt;!ox's Orange Pippin, of course." "Point!" said Clayton ("Clay") Pennyworth, holding up one finger to the scorekeeper. It would take more than a Cox's Orange Pippin to fool Josh Bradley. Even though it tasted suspici ously like an Orleans Reinette, its nearly perfect blend of acidity and sweetness gave it away. Cox's Orange was not considered the favorite English des sert apple for nothing. Josh took off his blindfold and smiled delight edly. He had made the finals. Along with Samuel Wright he had guessed in succession the Boston Russet, Lord Grosvenor, Michaelmas Red, Lax ton's Reward, Reinette de Canada, D'Arcy Spice, and Merton Charm. The Cornish Gilliflower had stumped him and Josh sat nervously on the sidelines while Samuel Wright bit softly into a Pitmason Pine Apple and let its succulent juice seep into his taste buds. Josh was noticeably relieved when Samuel, the only one giving him serious competition, had guessed "American Mother." It was an understand able miscalculation. The flesh of both apples is crisp and the juice bountiful and sweet. Samuel's mistake left Josh in the lead. "Score?" inquired Josh. Clay went over to the scorekeeper's table for consultation. "Fifteen-fourteen, you're ahead," he yelled back at Josh. Josh took his place along the row of chairs set up for the contestants. Samuel Wright was leaning against the wall, the front feet of his chair off the floor. He had white, bushy sideburns. The hair on the top of his head was thin. He was a large man, not easily identifiable as one versed in the subtleties and refinements of apple-tasting. He looked more like a lumberjack. Josh, on the other hand, was spindly, and played the violin. It was not surprising that he was able to detect the various proportions of bitterness and sweetness of the different, the multitude, of apples. It was not surprising that he was ahead. Samuel pushed himself away from the wall. The chair came down with a thump and shivered be neath his heavy body. He rose wearily, as if annoyed that he would again have to go through the proce dure of sitting down blindfolded and having a bite size piece of apple brought out and set before him, of having to chew it slowly and discern the type of apple it was. A Caville Blanche d'Hiver was brought out. The Blanche d'Hiver is often mentioned as being the most delicious of all apples, better even than Ashmead's Kernel. If Samuel guessed wrongly, at least he would be in for a treat. Blanche d'Hivers were like a rare and prized wine. They did not appear on the fruit counters of grocery stores or on the shelves of small markets on the sides of roads, but had to be imported from France. This particular Blanche d'Hiver had been ordered from Toulouse months earlier and carefully stored at the freezing point until the day of the contest. Then it had been brought out, just a couple of hours before it was scheduled to begin, and left in the air to regain its normal aroma and texture. Samuel tapped in front of him until he discov ered the small plate. Then he lifted the wedge of apple into his mouth. Biting into the apple was the most important part of the procedure. The quality of the flesh was important. It could be a degree of crisp or soft. Always, unless the apple were overripe or had been carelessly left at too high a temperature, it was firm. If Samuel bit down too forcefully, he would slice through the flesh as indiscriminantly as a cleaver, thereby damaging one clue to the type of apple. Also, a delicate pressure allowed the juice to HENRY BERRY writes stories, poems, and essays from Southport, Connecticut. 52 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW/Winter 1979</page><page sequence="2">Unclassifieds ooze out slowly and not become too mixed with saliva. The flavor of the juice was the most impor tant characteristic of the kind of apple. It would be a distinct blend of bitter and sweet. All apples have some tannic acid, but in many?dessert apples mostly?it is almost impossible to detect, out weighed by juice sweet as syrup. Bitterness is prized only in cider apples, and some cooking apples. Otherwise the degree of sweetness determines the apple's value as a handy, desirable, edible fruit. Samuel brought his jaws together as carefully as calipers. With bits of the piece still in his mouth, he blurted out "Caville Blanche d'Hiver" confidently. His French was poor, but there was no mistaking that he was referring to the proper apple. It was Josh's turn. He took the seat vacated by Samuel. For him, a Blenheim was brought out. During the nineteenth century, the Blenheim had been the most prized winter apple. Although it was not the most pleasant tasting, relatively acidic, it afforded the burghers and gentry its luxury throughout the year. As soon as Josh bit into it, his face puckered. He narrowed it down to a Tom Putt, a Gravenstein, or Blenheim. Behind the blindfold, he closed his eyes and let his mind wander, hoping that it would seize upon the correct type. He narrowed it down to either a Tom Putt or Blenheim. It was too acidic for a Gravenstein. Josh was not certain which kind it was, but his chances were fifty-fifty. Luckily he could afford to lose a point and still be in contention against Samuel. "Five seconds," Clay Pennyworth prompted. Josh's mind raced. The first thought?Blenheim. "Blenheim," he said aloud just as time was running out. "Point!" shouted Clay. As early as 1741 apples of New England were being exported to the West Indies, and by 1759 Albemarle Pippins were sent from Virginia to En gland. There are instances where apples have been used as the medium of exchange. In 1649, Governor John Endicott of Plymouth traded William Trask five hundred apple trees of three years' growth for two hundred acres of land. The apple, as certainly as horses and molasses, accompanied early settlers and traders from Europe to the southern hemisphere and was carried from Europe or North America to India, China, and Japan, where orchards were planted when conditions, soil, rainfall, and temper ature were favorable. No one knows precisely how long the apple has been a part of the human diet, but Cato names seven different varieties. This leads to speculation that the apple was introduced to the British Isles by the Romans. Most apples we eat today are domesticated versions of Malus pumila, the wild crab apple. Crab apple trees are still favored for aesthetic reasons. In the springtime cupped pink and white and violet blossoms line their boughs. But the crab apple itself proved too sour and bitter for the palate and today is used only for jellies and preserves. Like the dog, apples were tamed and thus allowed to accompany man through history. ! A Stayman Winesap was next. Samuel guessed it easily. Josh guessed a Nonpareil, but missed a De vonshire Quarrenden. After Samuel guessed a Granges Pearmain, the score was tied, seventeen all. "Time out," called Clay. After two hours of apple-tasting, it was time to give both contestants and spectators a break. "Contest resumes in one hour." This was the signal for the foodstuffs to be brought out. From the kitchen, hefty men carried jugs of cider and applejack and poured them into crystal bowls. Young girls followed bearing trays of | tarts and apple Strudel, mounds of applesauce, and | dozens of apple pies. There was warm freshly baked bread for spicy apple butter and jams and jellies and preserves made especially for the occasion. There were whole apples, plump and red, shades of yellow and green, Grenadiers, Royal Russets, Autumn Pearmains, London Pippins, and Golden Reinettes among them. So as not to befuddle their taste buds, Samuel and Josh didn't eat a thing. They sat talking to friends and relatives, watching everyone feast on the spread of apple products. At the end of the hour, Clay stood in the center of the room and announced the resumption of the contest. The men and girls cleared the tables and folded them up out of the way. Samuel and Josh came forward, indicating that they were ready. Clay sat them down and tied on their blindfolds. "We have one more hour," said Clay, "and then the contest is over. In the event of a tie, you'll share the prize." The prize was a year's supply of apples sent to the home of the winner from all over the world. Each month he would receive one dozen of an exotic and unusual variety, some coming from as far away as Australia and the islands of Japan. Clay waved his hand for the pieces to be brought | out. For the finals, they would each have a bite of | the same kind of apple and have to whisper its name to Clay. The first was a Court Pendu Plat, one of the oldest known kinds. The Court Pendu Plat has been known for over four hundred years. As is the case with most apples, the origin of the name has been lost, but it is still exciting and elegant enough to fire the imagination. "Court Pendu Plat"?it is a richly flavored little dessert apple. One imagines instantly that kings of France must have demanded it as a treat for guests at state banquets. Courtiers must have been sent to the orchards of the south, near Bordeaux and Gre noble, with instructions to bid the farmers deliver their harvests to the palace by oxen and cart. Samuel and Josh each guessed correctly, whis pering softly into Clayton Pennyworth's ear so that the other, sitting but a few yards away, could not | possibly hear. After the Court Pendu Plat, a Rome THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW/Winter 1979 53</page><page sequence="3">Unclassifieds ? ? Beauty was placed in front of the finalists. With little hesitation, they both named it, Clay having to hurry from one to the other as they raised their hands simultaneously. A Bramley's Seedling was next, followed by a King of the Pippins, then a Beauty of Bath, Lord Suffield, Arthur Turner, King's Acre Pippin, St. Edmund's Pippin, and a Lane's Prince Albert. The score stayed tied all the way; neither Josh nor Samuel missed once. Not a May Queen, a Coe's Golden Drop, not a White Transparent, nor a Christmas Pearmain, nor a Rosemary Russet were able to stump them. "This is the last apple," Clay told the contes tants and the crowd. "If you both guess it correctly, the prize will be mailed to each of you for six months." White squares of apple flesh were placed in front of each of them. Josh found his first. He passed it under his nostrils and breathed in its delightful, heady fragrance. His face sparkled. He placed the piece in his mouth, closed his lips, and delicately crushed it. He smirked puckishly. A few seconds later he raised his hand. Clay went over and Josh whispered into his ear. Clay shook his head up and down, affirming that Josh had guessed rightly. Samuel's face was dense with concentration. His brow furrowed and one sensed that, behind the blindfold, his eyes were narrow. His jaw revolved slowly as he let the small chunks of apple tumble over his tongue. f - Clay looked over to the judges' bench, at the timekeeper. The timekeeper held up the fingers of both his hands. "Ten seconds," Clay relayed to Samuel. Samuel's forehead turned glossy and his neck seemed to thicken as he strained to discern the type of apple he was chewing. "Five seconds," said Clay. "Three." "I don't know, I don't know," said Samuel. He removed his blindfold. At the other end of the table, Josh beamed proudly, winningly. A cheer rose from the crowd as Josh got up, went over and shook hands with Samuel, and was led away toward the judges' table by Clay. Samuel sat alone, dejected. The crowd passed by him, gathering around Clay and Josh and the judges. He looked disbelievingly at the sign on the table and the small piece of apple left on the plate in front of him. The apple was a Delicious, one of the most common apples, accounting for nearly twenty percent of the U.S. yearly crop. It was an apple any housewife or schoolboy would have known. He had never expected such a trick. It bordered on deceit. As decorations, apples of all kinds had been hung from the ceiling by ribbons. One, red, round, and full, had worked its way loose and now it dropped. It struck Samuel on the head. Samuel looked at it. It was a Flower of Kent. A Flower of Kent, said to be the type Sir Isaac Newton observed falling. D fORK, 54 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW/Winter 1979</page><page sequence="4">Unclassifieds 1 TINTINNABULATION (THE SOUND OF BELLS) RICHARD ABRONS JLiydia's quirk is that she is very much taken with words?the sound of them, that is, not the meaning. At the dining table, for example, if asked if she wants more potatoes, she is apt to reply "Mesopotamia," rolling the sound off her tongue with delight at having found just the right word noise for that particular question, that particular moment. It is a quirk that, as a child, led her parents to believe that she was quite gifted, as her vocabu lary was (and is) startling; and, if her choice of words was unusual, why, who could know what was sim mering under those touching blond curls? Her teachers, too, taken with a response such as "rutabaga," although the question might have been mathematical, regarded Lydia as a bright, but highly unusual, child. As Lydia was transformed from a golden little girl into a colt legged, cavorting pre-pubescent, the all too often inappropriateness of her speech over came the pride in her vocabulary and knowledge. In fact, there was doubt as to whether she knew what she was saying. Where once a firm "Agamemnon" might be greeted with something akin to awe, now she was questioned. Who was Agamemnon and what was he doing in the middle of a card game with her older brother, Charles? Mostly, Lydia would smile knowingly and not elucidate, so that it was unclear whether her thoughts had wandered to the siege of Troy, or whether she had simply warbled a meaningless chirp. Obviously, this charming defect needed correc tion. Lydia was lectured on the importance?nay, the necessity?of correct communication, the pur pose of language. How did^ feel if she asked to be driven to her friend Margaret's, and her mother replied "travertine." The problem was that Lydia was only partially attuned to the outside world. From the interstices of her inner space, recogniza ble words would emerge like melodies?expressive solely of the natural sounds of her personal terrain. A babbling brook, a caressing breeze, birds on branches, footsteps on the stairs, a jet plane over head. The school psychologist made no dent. He concluded that Lydia was orally fixated due to pre mature weaning, and that she had schizophrenic tendencies, which could prove devestating later on. For the moment, she was happy but queer. Threats had a way of backfiring. She was once sent to her room for a "persnickety" that, after many tears, she demonstrated was appropriately applied to Charles's habit of cutting the crusts off his bread. "/ don't do that," she said, "and I don't like crusts, either." The locus of this story is a small community in western Massachusetts, in the heart of the Berkshires?a town geared to the needs of skiers in the winter and campers and hikers in the summer. The town, in which Lydia's father owns a hardware store, is nondescript. But the surrounding hills, lakes and forests gladden the heart and quicken the spirit. To the burdened visitors from New York and Boston, it is a niche of Eden. To the locals, it is seedy but home, and they are at the same time proud of its appeal to outsiders and resentful of their intrusion?even though that is their livelihood. Abetted by the tolerance and generosity of her teachers, Lydia graduated from high school. Col lege, however, was out of the question. Further more, she had no such inclination, and her father was not that well off. Picture, then, an eighteen year-old girl, slightly tall, slender, with chestnut hair falling below her shoulders. Her eyes are deep brown and wistful. Her delicate nose tilts up, an aristocratic feature belied by her direct and accept ing smile. She clerks in her father's store, an engag ing figure in jeans and blue shirt as she rings up the register and directs customers to nails, screws, light-bulbs and Scott's Turfbuilder. As she makes change, a shopper is surprised to hear her say "cacophony," "anthropomorphic" or "Rum pelstiltskin." If he or she inquires as to what was just said or why, Lydia does not respond. The sound is enough?a diminished seventh chord fading into nothing in the hardware store on Oak Street. The young men of the town are attracted to Lydia. Her eccentricity is known and accepted. She feels warm and tender in their arms; and if, as lips approach lips, she says "Sisyphus," that can be ignored and the contact enjoyed. On the other hand, who might want to marry her? Probably no young man with any sense of direction or purpose. Lydia's parents are worried about this. They scan the visitors to the resort for a potential mate of RICHARD AB RONS is in the midst of writing his first novel.

Lydia's father, however, is not overly defensive. He is a cynic who scorns the verbiage from the Pope, from Washington, even from his neighbors. "The New Deal," "The New Frontier," "The Great Society" are all hogwash. So is "How ya doin' Mac," "You look great," and "Nice day." How much worse could "bougainvillea" be?even if said while feed ing the dog? Where Lydia's mother would settle, therefore, her father would not. She invites for dinner Sidney Fowler, the son of the operator of the cafeteria at Brodie Mountain. Lydia is now almost nineteen. Sidney is twenty-two. He lisps. Perhaps, her mother thinks, the lisp is appropriate reparation. With Sidney, however, no reparation is needed. He talks non-stop. Breathing, it seems, is for him un necessary. Occasionally, Lydia breaks in. "Promul gate," she says. "Cascade." "Mercenary." Sidney rushes past, noticing nothing, hearing nothing, say ing everything. When he leaves, he compliments the dinner, and tells Lydia that he has enjoyed her company tremendously. "I hope to thee you again thoon," he says at the door. "How about tomorrow night? There's a danthe at the lodge." "Fulminate," Lydia says. "Pick you up around theven?" he asks. "That's fine," Lydia's mother says, before Lydia can form a meaningful sound. Afterwards, there is an argument. Lydia's father says that Sidney is a jerk. "He's not a jerk. He just talks a lot," says I Lydia's mother. "Besides, who are we to be fussy?" "We're parents of a lovely daughter, that's who we are," Lydia's dad says. "How could Lydia live | with someone who never listens. He'd drive. ..." "Serendipity," Lydia interrupts. And so it goes with several other handicapped young men. There is Clifford with a dangling right hand; Martin, who stutters; Victor, with a tic in his left eye; and Bennett, gaunt with a bobbing Adam's apple, who winks conspiratorially after almost every remark. All are invited to dinner. All receive the seal of approval (as well as pot roast and potato pancakes) from Lydia's mother. All are scorned by her father. All are of no account to the maiden in question. She?like so many daughters?wishes that her par ents would just relax. I "Leave me alone," she says. "I'll get married when I want and to who I want. And if I don't get married ever, that's all right too." "Not for me it isn't," her mother says. "Don't worry," her father says. "We're not I going to push anybody on you. And your room is I always yours. You're our little girl fore ver and ever." j "Onomatopoeia," Lydia says gratefully. Now you and I don't believe that for every girl there's some one boy somewhere and vice versa. After all, why is it that the mate so often lives next door? And yet. . . . And yet one fine August day, when a sudden thundershower has passed and the air is cool and clear, and the scent of honeysuckle mingles with the smell of barbecued steaks, and the squeals of chil dren provide the evening's music, there is a knock on the door. Lydia opens it to find a young man standing outside. He is of medium height with light brown hair and blue eyes. He appears to be a man who states his case and leaves it at that. "Can I use your phone?" he asks. "I'm sorry to bother you, but my car broke down and I have to call the garage." "Of course," Lydia says. "My name is Lydia." She must have felt the warmth in his eyes or seen the sunlight in his hair, because that isn't like her. "My name is Bruce," he says, and finds himself staring, which is not like him either. "Bruce Bailey." "Euphonious," Lydia says. "A gaggle of geese. Tintinnabulation." Bruce Bailey's face opens up like a Cheshire cat. "Saturnine," he says. "Stiletto." Lydia smiles and then laughs?the childish gurgle of delight and innocence. "Crepuscular," she says. "Epiphany," says Bruce. "Vasco da Gama." "Internecine." Of course, Bruce Bailey stays for dinner. Lydia's parents have never seen her so alive and efferves cent. And Bruce is a charmer. His parents have a summer home on Lake Meridian. He installs sprinkler systems on Long Island, but his heart is in these hills and streams and stands of birches. Every now and then, the conversation is interrupted. "Rosicrucian," says Lydia. "Cardiovascular," Bruce says. "Insouciance." "Sumptuary." Lydia's father smiles at his wife and she smiles back. It is a happy meal. "Smorgasbord," says her father, picking up the tune. "Gramaphone," says her mother. Lydia and Bruce are now married and living in a small house not too far from the other side of Lake Meridian. Bruce works for a local sprinkler com pany. He is good at it?and a good salesman, too. He can show you in a whiffle how many zones you need to cover your lawn, and how your timer works so as to automatically do God's job at your discre tion. Lydia clerks part time for her father. Their home is filled with the murmur of wind through the pines, the drill of the woodpecker, the croak of the bull-frog. Even their arguments?they do have them?are tonal. "Avuncular," says Lydia angrily. "Irascible," Bruce retorts. When Lydia tells her parents that she is going to 56 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW/Winter 1979</page><page sequence="6">Unclassifieds - have a baby, they feel blessed. Charles is living in San Francisco with a divorcee and her two children. Lydia is their pet, their fountain of joy. "I do hope he's normal," Lydia's mother says, reaching for her needlework and her glasses. "Who?" her father asks. "The baby, of course," Lydia's mother says. "Normal? What's normal!" exclaims Lydia's father. "Normal is Johnny Grant killing his old man. Normal is that Hatch kid caught stealing in Nelson's Drug Store. Normal is the Wilsons?separating now and squabbling over their kids. Normal is Frank Marcy coming to the store and acting so high and mighty just because he runs the bank. Normal is your friend Daisy Selfridge getting her kicks by going around suffering in public. Thank the Lord, Lydia is not normal!" "Oh stop it, George," Lydia's mother says. "You know what I mean." "I do. I do indeed," says George. "Perambulator," he says with authority, relish ing the syllables as they roll from his mouth. THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE CENTREX MARK HALLIDAY A he centrex was gone, and nothing would ever be the same. The permanence of this crisis was not immediately recognized. Mattie told Hattie, and she leapt out of her cowboy hat pajamas into more mature clothing. Without break fasting they went out to search. After a fruitless hour, they stopped at a roadside stall where Mattie had two nec tarines. Hattie bought an apple but couldn't eat it: she was too worried. The day was hot and dusty with no blue in the sky?the worst kind of summer day?and the temper ature was expected to rise till well into the afternoon. Oh brother, thought Mattie, turning off the car radio, this is going to be a long one. He wished he had a damp towel. But he wasn't going to be a baby about all this. Hattie caught herself thinking: Why couldn't he keep better track of the damn centrex? But immediately she saw the folly of this attitude. Awareness of the centrex had never been any more Mattie's responsibility than her own, and of course there was no sound reason why it should be; hadn't the feminist movement made that abundantly clear? Minor differences of personal style aside, she and Mattie were equally adults, independent agents, unique individual responsible persons trying their best to cut a path through the thickets of Seventies cul ture; and they had agreed to share the tribulations as well as the exhilarations of this struggle. But neither of them had reckoned on the disappearance of the centrex. Hattie remembered a magazine article which contended that unless certain trends could be reversed, the centrex might disappear as early as 1995. She had shown the article to her old friend from college, Reine Wing. Reine Wing always had a great way of taking things in stride without seeming foolhardy. Reine Wing scanned the article and flipped the magazine dexterously into the trash bag beside the stove. "No sweat," she said gaily. "The guy is one of those doomsday journalists, you find them in all fields, he makes a buck by acting grimmer and graver than anybody else. Pessimism is a job for those guys." "What about those statistics?" Hattie asked, her brow still gathered in alarm. "And the argument?it's eloquent!" "People who don't want to face the present focus hyperbolically on the far future," Reine Wing said. "By 1995 you'll be well into middle age. You'll be all set." And off she went to the Institute where she taught dance. Hattie wondered where Reine Wing was now. They had been out of touch for the last six months. It was such a pain to stay in touch with everybody, much as you might like them. Reine Wing had said something about going to Miami for the summer to live by selling Polaroid snap shots. "They eat 'em up," she said. Hattie wondered if Reine Wing had noticed the ab sence of the centrex. If it was gone here, it must be gone there, mustn't it? This seemed a crazy question and Hat tie supposed Mattie would mock her for asking, but this was no day for cautious vanity, so she asked him. He was not nearly as positive as she expected. "It must be," he said. "I mean, how could it be gone here and still be hanging around in Miami, for Christ's sake? If it was going to hang around anywhere it would probably be Colorado," Mattie hazarded. He liked mountain climbing. He wiped a little nectarine juice from his lips with the back of a tanned hand. He turned the radio on again and tuned in the news. But the announcer seemed to know nothing about the centrex or where it might have headed. On the other hand, everything he reported seemed informed by a deep recognition that the centrex was at least temporarily gone. "He's no fool," Mattie said. "He knows, but he's not allowed to talk about it on the air. Or maybe he's scared of starting a panic." Hattie thought Mattie was indulging his taste for sen sationalism. "What do you mean a panic? We're not run ning amok, are we? You think we're the only people in town who have figured out what's wrong?" "No," he said, grinning, "we're just the only ones intelligent enough to care." They could not keep up their light-hearted banter. The sky stayed gray and the humidity increased along with the temperature. They got stuck in a traffic jam on the way home and lost hours of potential searching time. When they were still two miles from home Hattie saw her MARK HALLIDAY is a graduate student at Brandeis Univer sity. THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW/Winter 1979 57</page><page sequence="7">-??- Unclassifieds sister Hope on a street corner, clutching packages. Hope hopped in for a ride. She was sucking a Kool-Pop. "Blue," said Mattie, "what flavor is blue?" "I don't know," said Hope, "it's weird." "But you like it?" "I don't know," said Hope, nuzzling reflectively. "It's weird." "I think we have something a little more important to talk about today," said Hattie irritably. "Now, Hope, this is something really serious. Are you listening?" Hope was opening one of her packages but she stopped and gave Hattie her undivided attention for a minute. "Hope, we found out this morning?we noticed, I mean we sort of figured out, that something very impor tant is missing." "Missing from your house?" "From all over," said Mattie. He gave a blast on the horn to prompt some progress, or at least change, in the tie-up at the rotary. It was a little car but its horn was masterfully loud, and it joined the democratic cacophony. "What is the centrex, again?" Hope asked. "How did you know I was talking about the centrex?" Hattie demanded. "Cuz you always get serious and heavy like this when you're worried about the centrex." "You're going to feel the same way in a few years, honey," Mattie said. His usual equanimity had taken a pounding today. The seat was soaked with sweat under his thighs. "Okay, could you just give me a definition?" asked Hope. "Come on, Hope," Mattie began, "you know better than?" "Let me handle this, please," Hattie interposed. She summarized for Hope their basic thinking about the na ture of the centrex. "Awright, awright, I get it," said Hope. "It's weird, but I get it." "Why is it weird?" asked the older sister patiently. "It's just very Sixties," said Hope. "Jesus Christ," Mattie sighed. It had been a long day and now evening was upon them. The traffic was flowing almost freely at last, and he drove to the campus where Hope was a freshman. He wished he had kept his temper better because he knew that Hope was actually a very bright kid underneath all the jargon and feigned noncha lance; in fact, it crossed his mind that if Hope really concentrated she might figure out where the centrex would be. But she pretended not to be interested. "Well, good luck finding it," she said cheerfully as she climbed out of the back seat, leaving her Kool-Pop wrap per on the floor of the car. "You could call a counseling service," she suggested now, to show she was not unsym pathetic. "Or, if you want, I could speak to the chaplain here at school?" "That's not a funny idea," Mattie said. "She didn't mean it as a joke," said Hattie. "Listen, Hope, I'll call you later, okay? We're going to need to do a lot of thinking about this . . . and some planning. . . ." Hope drew two record albums from one of her bags to show Hattie. "I got 'Bat Out Of Hell' by Meat Loaf. It's stupid but I get a kick out of it. And 'Bust Your Sweet Face' by Father Passion and the Human Sacrifice. Weird stuff." Hattie felt a headache developing. "Hope you like them," she said wearily. "Not the greatest choices, I realize," Hope said. She laughed. "I got some better records yesterday." Mattie and Hattie drove home and reheated the lasagna. Over it they had a thorough discussion of the whole problem. There were many ramifications and Hat tie made a list. It felt good to have the ramifications isolated from each other on paper. On the other hand, Hattie's headache persisted and the lasagna did nothing for it. Mattie rather bravely suggested that she take some aspirin and go to bed; but she couldn't see leaving him to pace the house alone knowing that the centrex was gone and might (conceivably) never fully return. Hattie brought her box of college texts down from the attic, and they both began to read up on various aspects of the centrex. Every significant passage seemed to open up new areas of relevance, though, and the hours passed swiftly. Mattie kept a wet towel wrapped around his head like a turban as he read. Hattie said he resembled a zealot of a foreign and forgotten faith, and he smiled in an abstracted way?he was speed-reading a book called The American Pageant. It was nearly three o'clock when they staggered into their pajamas. They slept with the bedroom air conditioner on full blast. Before falling asleep Mattie focused fora minute on all the neat little schooners sailing on the arm of his pajama-top, and wished he were aboard. "Batten down the hatches," he murmured to Hattie. But she was already asleep. Next morning right after breakfast Hattie drove to the Walnut Hill Home where her mother resided. Maybe her mother would remember something which would provide the necessary clue about where the centrex might hide out. Maybe it had occasionally sneaked away in her time, too; Hattie seemed to recall some rumors to that effect. Or maybe age somehow gave a person a kind of wisdom about these things; maybe her mother would simply say: "Oh, you silly goose, go look in the chapel!" or "Just come with me over to the library and we'll get this straightened out." But Hattie's mother could not help. She claimed to have noticed that the centrex was missing, in fact she believed it had been mostly gone for "one hell of a lot more than twenty-four hours." But she did not seem especially concerned, and anyway there was no practical means for her to assist in the search since her weak health confined her to Walnut Hill. Her chief concern today was the idiocy of her neighbors on the third floor of the Home. "You can't believe the nonsense they talk all day," the old woman complained. "It's nothing but blather blather blather from morning till night." Hattie promised to bring some fresh fruit on her next visit, and went home to join Mattie in the continuation of the search. It was another scorcher. All around them people seemed to carry on fairly normally, almost as if the centrex were still in its proper place.
