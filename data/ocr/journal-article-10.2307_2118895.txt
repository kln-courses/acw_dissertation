<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Seven Sisters: The Great Oil Companies and the World They Shaped. By Anthony Sampson. New York: Viking Press, 1975. Pp. 334. Anthony Sampson is an economic journalist, who has written the Anatomly of Britain and the Anatomy of Europe. In 1973-1974, he was Washington corTespon- dent for The Observer (London) and became fascinated by the inquiries into multinational corporations conducted by the Church Committee. Out of the rich Church Committee material-along with additional reading and conversations with an impressive group of high level company executives, politicians, diplomats, and university professors-Sampson produced two volumes. The first was the popular The Sovereign State of ITT, a study of an important multinational enterprise. The second, The Seven Sisters, is about the formidable multinational oil companies (Exxon, Mobil, Standard Oil of California, Texaco, Gulf, Shell and British Petroleum) and "the world they shaped." If ever there was an industry with profound interna- tional economic and political consequences, this is it. Sampson's story is a picturesque, human one, of Rockefeller, Deterding, Teagle, Cetty, Mattei, and Yamani. Every student of the international oil industry knows well that oil and politics are intermixed, so the economic historian should not be turned aside by the statement that the book is about the political consequences of oil and not its economic basis. The book reads like a novel. Central to the story is the issue of power, and Sampson believes that before the events of October 1973, the power of the big seven was august and essentially unchallenged. It was reflected in a special mystique represented in company maps of oil producing areas with bolder lines for concessions than for the national boundaries. Texaco (the only company that refused to cooperate with Sampson) is described as having a reputation "for meaness and secrecy," "selfishness and greed," "negativity and lack of foresight." Mobil gets far higher marks. Exxon executives, Sampson believes, are more at home in the oil business than in politics. By contrast, Shell executives are Oxford and Cambridge trained; their preference is to talk about diplomacy rather than profits. Sir Eric Drake, Chairman of BP, "regards the British government with affectionate contempt for their ignorance of oil...." Each company has a personality, a corporate citadel (its headquarters building), and a "style." This reviewer is sympathetic to an approach to economic history that argues that companies in the same industry do not necessarily adopt similar strategies. Sampson</page><page sequence="2">790 Reviews of Books understands this, although sometimes his distinctions are repetitious and border on the ludicrous. Worse still, they often fail to give adequate insights into corporate strategy. His anthropomorphism of corporate activity is so complete that Sampson consistently uses "who" rather than "which" after company as the function word to introduce the next clause. The economic historian will find most of the book fun and will savour the colorful, often impetuous passages. A large portion of the book is devoted to the history of the industry. The reader, however, must be wary; the volume is filled with literally dozens of mostly minor, usually careless, inaccuracies. The subject matter covered is familiar to those knowledgeable in the history of international oil, although occasionally Sampson introduces new material. Particu- larly interesting are insights from his interviews. Sampson adopts a "trust-buster's" view toward the "oil cartel;" agreements are "secret," "mysterious," restraints on trade. Frequently, Sampson fails to reconcile his own perceptions on corporate lack of power ("The black fluid seemed often to be itself the real master spurting up and subsiding from black corners of the world, teasing the west by its combination of indispensability and maddening inaccessibility.") with stereotyped statements on corporation control. Sampson is puzzled at why the U. S. government, which he sees as earlier respon- sive to all the companies' needs, failed to be influenced by them in the critical summer of 1973. His explanations are three: (1) the Israeli lobby was strong; (2) the administration had separated its oil and its Arab-Israeli policies for so long that it proved impossible to link them, and (3) the U.S. oilmen had lost nearly all their credibility. Perhaps a keener historian would have recognized that in effect there had never been a U.S. oil policy but rather a set of pragmatic policies and that, more important, the U. S. government had not always been responsive to corporate de- mands. Again, Sampson implies that the failure of consumer governments to act in the recent crisis left the oil companies with the task of reallocating world oil, as though the whole history of the international oil industry was not one whereby the com- panies constantly allocated and reallocated oil supplies. There is a theme in the book that particularly fascinates the reader. Are we now faced with a new phenomenon: an oligopsony interacting with an oligopoly (the oil companies, newly buyers rather than owners of crude oil, facing the "oil cartel" of national oil producers and sellers of crude oil)? Sampson concludes that the road toward any equitable control system will be long and thorny, but it will begin a new type of global responsibility. His last sentence reads: "Oil, which has been such a combustible element in world conflicts in the past, may yet prove a lubricant for world peace." Little in his text seems to provide the basis for this forecast of such an heroic function for black gold. MIRA WILKINS, Florida International University</page></plain_text>
