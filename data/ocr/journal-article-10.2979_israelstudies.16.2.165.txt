<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Yossi Ben-Artzi1 Review Essay Out of (Academic) Focus: on Ilan Pappe, Out of the Frame: The Struggle  for Academic Freedom in Israel (Pluto Press, London—New York, 2010),  pp. 246 The reader interested in academic freedom in Israel will be  better off looking for sources in the media and in internet forums because  this book does not address the struggle for academic freedom in Israel  despite the promise in its subtitle.2 The book unfolds the tortuous journey of a “narcissus” away from  the dank marshland in which it grew, and its striving to drain the swamp  (a routine Zionist duty, incidentally . . .). It is the story of the private and  academic life of Ilan Pappe3 and his flight from the disillusionment and  injustice of Zionism to the just promised land of the Palestinian nakba  (catastrophe of 1948). An ornate and presumptuous narrative, it tells of  a man who turned his back on his home and his homeland and, with an  excess of explanations, seeks to disguise his exit under high-minded and  ideological pretexts. The book, then, is given over to propaganda and the exposition of  a personal political ideology. It accommodates the struggle for academic  freedom only in as much as it touches on Prof. Pappe’s own struggle with  Israeli academia, as part of it and outside it. It neither examines nor illu- minates the state of academic freedom in Israel in 2010 the year Out of the  Frame was published. Chapter 5, “The Best Runner in the Class,” is a fable made up by Pappe  about the Tantura Affair which occupies some forty percent of the total  book. It is an imaginary tale told by Pappe as a hardly veiled but singularly  misleading account of the Tantura Affair. The actual Tantura was a village  on the shores of the Mediterranean near ancient Dor that was captured by  IDF forces 22–23 May 1948 after a long night’s combat. The Tantura Affair,  165 </page> <page sequence="2"> 166  •  israel studies, volume 16 number 2 which became a cause célèbre and a life-trauma for Pappe, evolved from his  involvement with an MA thesis written by Theodor Katz, a student in the  Department of Middle Eastern Studies at the University of Haifa. Written  under the supervision of Prof. Kais Firro, Katz’s thesis, titled “The Exodus  of the Arabs from the Villages on the Slopes of Southern Carmel in 1948,”  was based primarily on numerous interviews conducted some 50 years after  the events with refugees from the villages Tantura and Umm az-Ziynat. It  is crucial to appreciate that Pappe himself was surreptitiously and deeply  and involved in the writing of this thesis and that the rejection of Katz’s  thesis and unsubstantiated claims was tantamount to a rejection of Pappe’s  own position. Basing himself on hearsay and on village folklore and ignoring demo- graphic and historical evidence to the contrary, Katz claimed that IDF  soldiers of the Alexandroni brigade committed war crimes that caused the  deaths of 200–250 villagers after Tantura was occupied. Katz’s thesis was  judged internally in the department as excellent and given a grade of 97.  After an Israeli journalist published the story of the alleged massacre based  on the thesis which was available in the University library, the veterans of  the Alexandroni Brigade sued Katz for libel. Katz was cross-examined in  court for two days whereupon he signed a statement acknowledging that  no massacre had taken place in Tantura. The University of Haifa suspended  Katz’s degree and established a special committee of experts in Arabic and  History to check his tapes, which he initially refused to expose. The com- mittee found numerous mistakes, inconsistencies in the use of evidence,  fallacies and misleading use of the original tapes by the student. Nevertheless, Katz was invited to revise his thesis. The second version  was sent out to five external examiners, the majority of whom gave it a fail- ing grade due to its low academic standard. The thesis contained flaws in  each aspect of both oral and written history. In 2004 proposals were made to  dig in the parking lot of Dor beach, the alleged mass grave of the ‘victims’,  but such an action never took place. Pappe made Katz and Tantura a central  event in Israel’s historiography and academic freedom scene, and the book  reflects Pappe’s trauma in each of his chapters, including this imaginary one. The Tantura Affair as it is unfolded in Chapter 5 is a fictionalized  account. In it, Pappe details the efforts of a Palestinian Arab researcher and  his Jewish student to persuade the woman Fatima, who, as a child, was the  ‘best runner in the class’ and a survivor of the “massacre” at Tantura in 1948,  to disclose the whereabouts of the mass grave of the supposedly numerous  Arab victims of that event. Pappe represents himself in the forward as the  student, but then casts himself in the chapter as Dr. Musalem Awad, the  </page> <page sequence="3"> Review Essay  •  167 only “Palestinian” professor in Israeli academe who has tenure, and who  therefore does not hesitate to supervise his student “Yaakov.” Those familiar with the real figures of the affair, will recognize imme- diately that Prof. Firro (not Firo as Pappe misspelled his name) is not  an expert in 1948 but in Druze studies and Lebanon’s affairs, and never  attempted to investigate and prove the massacre allegation, as did Pappe.  Moreover, the fictional ‘Yaakov’ and his research—are like a mirror image  of Katz’s methodology and behavior. In the course of his research Yaakov  has uncovered no fewer than five villages on Israel’s Carmel coastal plain  where he maintains, a single army unit had been responsible for a slaughter.  Dr. Awad and his student accompany Fatima to bring her case before the  High Court of Justice, which epitomizes the injustice inherent in the very  existence of the state of the Jews. As a first step the judge orders the digging  up of the parking lot of what is now a leisure beach, asserted to be the grave  of the slaughtered villagers. Dr. Awad, Yaakov, and even Fatima’s son Ali,  see this as a chance finally to “close” the Tantura controversy, and to show  the whole world that a wrong has been done to the student researcher and  to justice alike. However, on the appointed day, when a military squad arrives to carry  out the digging, the village where Fatima lived is surrounded and a curfew  declared. Just as back in the 1950s, Pappe, informs the reader, the noise of  loudspeakers reverberates in her ears and all those years of endless harass- ment by the “evil Shabak [Israel’s General Secret Service] people and the  police” are conjured up again. While “Yaakov”/Katz and Pappe /“Awad”  wait to see the bones lifted out of the grave, Ali realizes that his mother has  been concealing the truth about the location of the grave. Alas, it was not  this parking lot: Pappe/”Awad” is already preparing the reason why bones  apparently will not be found there, contrary to his student’s argument, but  elsewhere. Only Fatima, “the best runner in the class” knows the truth about  where the victims were buried. As a child she managed to see the trucks  onto which the bulldozers loaded the bodies that took them away from  the village, and then dug pits for them on another hill, where they were  tossed and covered up. Not only were pine tree planted then over them,  a well-known accusation for the Zionist method of hiding the sins of the  nakba, but the grove became the memorial site for the Israeli army unit that  captured the village and committed the massacre. Fatima seems to want  to show her son and the diligent student the real place of burial, knowing  that where the army is digging by virtue of the court order nothing will  be found—and the researcher and his instructor and all their witnesses,  </page> <page sequence="4"> 168  •  israel studies, volume 16 number 2 and the entire nakba argument, will emerge as delusional. Against her  son’s imploring, and against Yaakov who tries to stop her because there is a  curfew in the village, she breaks into the run of the “best in the class”—and  is shot, cut down by the gunfire of the soldiers stationed around the village.  The last witness, like her massacred forefathers and fellow villagers, is gone  and she has taken the secret to her own grave. This chapter illustrates Pappe’s academic method throughout this  book; that is, he plants imaginary tales in a book purportedly concerned  with the struggle for academic freedom in Israel. Why does Pappe, take  on the identity of an Arab and assume a new name? Why does he elect to  kill off the sole witness, the only one who knew the location of the hidden  grave of the hundreds of Arabs allegedly slaughtered in Tantura? And why  does he deliberately place the villagers under a curfew seemingly meant to  permit undisturbed excavation of the mass grave? I argue that the fantasy is necessary because Pappe knows that the evi- dence of the massacre is fabricated. He also knows that once he has asserted  the burial place is under the parking lot—as Katz did in his thesis—the  entire house of cards he and his student have built will come tumbling  down if human bones are sought but not found. So in Pappe’s fabled ver- sion, he shifts the burial place—albeit symbolically, and somewhat mali- ciously re-inters the Tantura dead, plants a pine copse over their bodies,  and, to add insult to injury, names the place for the fallen of the army unit  that committed the imaginary atrocity. I have described this chapter in some detail because it reflects the  author’s mindset and demonstrates his take on how history should be  researched, giving free reign to imagination, fantasizing plots, and con- founding past with present, politics with history, ideology with reality,  actuality with illusion. Tantura, in fact, is the defining trauma that shaped  his world from the moment the incident burst onto the public sphere—but  it is only one instance of the grand cause to which he affirms he has resolved  to dedicate his life, specifically: the Palestinian nakba of 1948 which, for  Pappe, is the Original Sin of the State of Israel (21). Chapter 1 elevates the nakba to the level of key element in understand- ing Pappe’s trek to his new world. He recounts its absence from the history  books he studied, relates the disdain shown by the guides on his school trips  in Haifa for the remains of the Arab building in the city and blames the  deliberate destruction of the Arab city on its overbearing Jewish mayor (13). I went to the same school, and all my teachers and guides taught me  that Haifa was a mixed city that set an example of integrated life. They  praised the Arab quarters of the city as the product of fine indigenous  </page> <page sequence="5"> Review Essay  •  169 building, in contrast to the new/Zionist residential blocks, and pointed out  that on 22 April 1948, Mayor Shabtai Levi publicly, and in the presence of  British army officers, exhorted the Arabs of Haifa not to leave. It was not  Levi who destroyed the old city; indeed, he clashed with Ben-Gurion in  order to preserve it. Pappe will not give credence to such a “narrative,” nor to the MA  thesis written under his supervision by his own student Tamir Goren, who  demonstrated all these facts. Pappe is well acquainted with Goren’s sources  and even endorsed them as correct and sound however he does not trouble  to mention them, and of course denies their implications. Since his doctoral studies, the demon of the nakba never left him.  Already when writing his doctoral dissertation, he ascribes to himself the  “elimination” of one of the great and essential Zionist myths, namely the  myth that Britain was the enemy of Zionism and Israel; quite the reverse:  Britain enabled the Zionists to create a state in Palestine, and to operate  “ethnic cleansing” of the local population (17). This phrase did not flow  trippingly from Pappe, while he was engaged in his dissertation back in the  1980s, and he embellished and developed it in the following years so as to  align himself with the “political correctness” of the circles he joined later  on, especially after it was used often in the post-Yugoslavian wars (215–17). From this chapter on, Pappe elaborates a story that merges his aca- demic and personal life history with the annals of the Middle East and  Israel—as if the two parts are mutually influenced and dependent in abso- lute equality. Pappe’s story now becomes “The Story” of general history.  With great pride he describes how his dissertation, combined with the stud- ies of Avi Shlaim and Benny Morris, created the “new history” of the rise  of the State of Israel, in particular, the story of the “crimes” involved—the  conspiracy with the Hashemites, the expulsion, the nakba—and the most  heinous and unforgiveable of sins, the disappearance and concealment of  the nakba. From that time forth, he explains, his career has been devoted  to preserving the memory of those tragic events. Along with this he also  assumes a wholly non-academic task: to expurgate (!) the evil perpetrated. On his return to Israel from his studies in England in 1984, he encoun- tered “denial of the nakba”, another term that was to become an integral  part of the Pappean lexicon. No one had learned, taught, or been at all  aware of the Palestinian tragedy until Pappe’s return to Israel and his teach- ing in the Department of Middle Eastern Studies at the University of Haifa  or until his regular appearances on the subject in the media followed by the  publication of the book based on his PhD dissertation and the outbreak  of the first intifada. </page> <page sequence="6"> 170  •  israel studies, volume 16 number 2 He goes on to describe his many activities in the 1990s for the propa- gation of the nakba and its recognition in public discussion, as if no one  except himself had done anything of the sort before. He does not acknowl- edge any scholars of Palestinian history who did not dedicate themselves  and all their work to the nakba alone: not Yehoshafat Harkabi, who men- tioned the phrase nakba and explained it in about 1964, not Yehoshua Porat,  not writers such as S. Yizhar, who had already written Hirbet Hizaa—a  poignant story of the deportation of an entire Arab village in the war of  1948. Apparently none of these is worthy, in contrast to his own Sisyphean  labor on the Israeli and Palestinian sides of public opinion. At this point of the book Pappe lays an additional foundation stone  in the construction of the image he wishes to pass on to history: that of the  victim and a scholar persecuted for his academic opinions (24). Beginning  with the publication of his dissertation, and along with a series of TV pro- grams and public events in which he articulated his views on the nakba, he  tells us that he had received threats on his life, warnings about his academic  future and the unlikelihood of his being granted tenure. He notes that Prof.  Yoav Gelber a senior historian at the University of Haifa, even labeled one  of Pappe’s “brave” lectures “treason in battle.” Pappe very quickly became  skillful in building his career on the image of the victim who pays a high  price for his academic views—which even in the early years of his academic  life could hardly be separated from public political views. In 1993, Pappe had come to be on intimate terms with the victims of  the nakba, and with all due respect had been invited to Tunis, where Arafat  and the PLO command had sojourned since the first Lebanon war. At that  time he found a partner to his view of the Oslo Accords and what ensued  between the leader of the Palestinians and Israel; this was Edward Said.  He, like Pappe, held that the accords betrayed the true mission of the PLO  as a national movement. The fight was to be directed against abandoning  the Palestinian refugees and losing sight of their plight, that is, against  the absence of a resolute stand on the return of the 1948 refugees to their  homes throughout Israel. In this regard Pappe erects in this context another  cornerstone of his analytical lexicon, the likening of Israel to South Africa  (38). Not only is Israel an Apartheid state in real life, but also in the conduct  of historical research. Just as the archives of the South African Bureau of  State Security (BOSS) were not needed for one to learn about the crimes  against the blacks, so the Palestinians did not need the Israel Defense  Forces’ archive to find out what actually happened on the battlefields in  1948. Certainly, when Pappe resumes his story of Tantura in the appendix,  it becomes clear why he does not require archival or historical sources to  </page> <page sequence="7"> Review Essay  •  171 write history and elaborate a narrative: any testimony from any Palestinian  is accepted at face value—as the whole truth. Pappe devotes Chapter 3 to his secret student, Theodor Katz, pro- genitor of the Tantura Affair. In this chapter he lays the foundation for  the whole issue of Tantura, which became central in his academic life. He  describes the student, how he chose the topic of the research, and his main  findings. Pappe withholds from his readers the fact that in his introduction to  the thesis Katz thanks him as the one who in practice was his informal  advisor and aide in the writing, and thus conceals the truth of his involve- ment in its every stage. He describes the process of exposure of the thesis  to the public, and the uproar that arose when the allegation came to light  that troops of the 33rd battalion of the Alexandroni Brigade had massacred  hundreds of the villagers at Tantura after the night battles fought for its cap- ture. The battalion veterans, who were not au courant with the intricacies of  post-modernism and Pappe’s historiographic outlook, initially demanded  that the University annul the thesis and remove it from the library’s shelves. The hesitancy to establish a committee of inquiry inside the University  caused the veterans’ representatives to file suit against Katz personally. Very  soon gaping contradictions emerged between the oral testimony—which  was in any case of questionable validity as a sole historical source—and  what Katz had written in the thesis itself. For example, when Katz in a  conversation with an interviewee tried to verify if indeed he had seen actual  shooting, and asked, “Did you see it?” the latter replied, “No, I didn’t see it.”  But in the thesis that same witness is cited as one who did witness shoot- ing. This is but one small example of many abuses that amply demonstrate  the researcher’s contradictions, distortions, and flawed methodology. In  another case Katz claimed that he could not produce the evidence because  the tape in the recorder ran out just as the interviewee began to give the  testimony quoted in the thesis. Katz soon broke down, and agreed to sign  a declaration of apology, admitting that he had no evidence that there had  been a massacre at Tantura.4 Neither Pappe, nor the nakba front, were going to let the prey slip from  their grasp. Pappe, who reports he “began three consecutive days and nights  of listening to the 60 hours of tapes” (!) (79), was shocked upon hearing  the accounts of the cold-hearted and cruel slaughter that rolled off the tape  recordings; of the mass burial of about 225 victims; of the treatment of the  women and the refugees; and of the destruction of the village. From that stage in the affair, Katz became a puppet controlled by sub- sequent events and perhaps even by Pappe himself, who took him under  </page> <page sequence="8"> 172  •  israel studies, volume 16 number 2 his wing. It is certainly possible that even earlier Pappe was fully familiar  with the scandalous thesis that Katz submitted. If we take Katz at his word,  Pappe may well have been the clandestine supervisor of the thesis. And it  is at least plausible to imagine that he awaited—perhaps even urged—its  publication to exploit the findings in the historical timeframe in which the  Katz affair took place, this being the high point of the events of the second  intifada. Was this yet another weapon to substantiate the contemporary  claims of the brutality of the IDF and its methods as having been forged  already in 1948? We will never know. By 2001 Katz’s thesis had become a golem5 that turned upon both its  maker and its spiritual guide, also striking at the prestige of the University  and at the personal relations of Pappe with most of its members. Pappe  emerged from the tapes marathon to harshly attack anyone who dared  come out against the thesis and question its research methods. When the  University set up a neutral committee of experts to examine the tapes and  their match with Katz’s text, Pappe viciously attacked its members in a series  of e-mails on the University intranet and elsewhere: “One of them [Prof.  Baram] had already set his position before he read the thesis, and published  his opinion in [the daily] Maariv . . .” When he realized that as usual he  had made a mistake with the dates, Pappe wrote brazenly that he had erred  when he detailed the interview was published in Maariv, 21 January 2001  when it had actually been published in [the local weekly] Yedi’ot Haifa, 9  April. However, he noted, “Prof. Baram has a sister—but I was mistaken  about the color of her hair . . .” and “the other one [the late Prof. Talmon]  propagated in the work the accepted method of the Israeli security services,  where he served and still serves in the reserves . . .” and “another researcher  [Dr. Gereis] is an expert in pre-Islamic poetry but he was brought in because  there had to be an Arab as a fig-leaf” [in the original!].6 In the book (80–82) he does not repeat these crudities, forgets to cite  himself, and notes only the committee members’ specializations. Was such  a weighty committee called to examine the work of an MA student alone,  and one who was not required to have expertise in Arabic? Pappe muses.  Pappe’s reservations notwithstanding, the committee found that Katz had  actually faked evidence, cited himself, and other such methodological fail- ings. Pappe, as is his wont, misleads the readers of the book when he argues  that there were “only” six minor cases of mistaken use of the tapes, since the  committee found, in addition, dozens of falsifications, instances of words  being put into the interviewees’ mouths, and disregard of testimonies that  did not support the thesis, with varying degrees of gravity of lack of aca- demic integrity.7 Pappe scorns this serious 40-page report, which reveals,  </page> <page sequence="9"> Review Essay  •  173 among other things, that Katz made up his story mainly by referring to his  handwritten sheets, not by listening to the 60 hours of tapes that he had  somehow neglected to reference. At the time, as a researcher with expertise in the historical geography  of the region, and not in my capacity of Dean of Humanities, I wrote a  15-page report for the Council of Advanced Studies of the University which  discussed the matter, noting that it was a third-rate thesis academically, and  was distorted through and through to serve the goal predetermined by its  author (or his secret supervisor?).8 Pappe makes no mention of this report,  and is content to allude to other reports written by “friends” of Gelber and  Ben-Artzi. Despite the academic failure and the public offense, the Uni- versity allowed Katz to submit a revised thesis, which he did about a year  later, when he handed in a study more voluminous than its predecessor.  This time, the thesis was sent to five anonymous external referees, and the  weighting of their marks did not even approach the original grade. Katz  received his MA degree on the track not requiring a thesis, because his thesis  was not deemed satisfactory. Throughout this period, Pappe conducted a wide-ranging campaign of  electronic skirmishes with most of the faculty of the University of Haifa.9  In the context of the methodological debate that arose on the subject of oral  history, Pappe developed an additional foundation stone in the Pappean  system—intended to pierce the heart and cause pain to every Jew every- where: “Palestinian testimony on the nakba is equivalent to testimony of sur- vivors of the Holocaust suffered by the Jewish people”. On the face of it this  is legitimate and stands to reason. However, in fact this is an untenable claim,  outrageous to any true student of history and not a political pamphleteer. Testimonies of Holocaust survivors are indeed heard and read as  authentic, but they are wholly different in terms of the quality and weight  of the history written in their light. These are not attestations about an  ongoing conflict, delivered with an eye to their effect on public opinion of  one kind or another, or about a political or economic demand. Their great  import and the horror reflected in them notwithstanding, they were never  taken as the sole source for the historiography of World War II, or even  of the Holocaust itself. At most they affirmed millions of historical docu- ments of diverse origin, which upheld the memories—and vice versa were  affirmed by them. With the propagandist’s masterly sophistry, and in full  awareness of the weak points of the average Israeli’s nervous system, Pappe’s  comparison is calculated to make the blood of every Jew and Israeli, or any  fair-minded person, boil. Accordingly he flaunts it in his struggle for Israeli  recognition of the nakba (74, and throughout). </page> <page sequence="10"> 174  •  israel studies, volume 16 number 2 Nor can Pappe end his therapeutic book without revisiting the great  trauma of Tantura. So, after the epilogue, the reader is met by yet another  account of Tantura, now in the form of an appendix. Wholly unconnected  to the book and its title, Pappe again presents his version of the Tantura  Affair of 1948. For 20 pages he recycles everything he as ever written—in  articles and books, as well as countless interviews. He summarizes for the  reader the episode of the battle, the rumors, the testimony, the executions  (!), the burial, the treatment of women, and so on and so forth. This appen- dix is based entirely on Katz’s thesis and on the interviews he conducted  back in 1997. No new source is cited, even though Pappe claims that he himself  researched the affair. This is not the place to deal yet again with the Tantura  episode, still less with Katz’s wretched thesis and the attention Pappe has  given it since 2001, even in this book which was supposed to deal with a  different topic. The cracks, the contradictions, the absence of proof to sup- port the charge of massacre all deserve a separate article. However, to allow  Pappe to get off scot-free would be a mistake.10 I will refer only to one document, perhaps one of the most important  in the Tantura Affair, which Pappe withholds and which he withheld at the  time of the Katz affair from his readers. In August 1998, about six months  after Katz submitted his original thesis, a book was published in Damas- cus titled Al-Tantura, written by a former inhabitant of the village, Yahya  Mahmud al-Yahya. The author was not an eye-witness to the capture of the  village in 1948, but describes it in detail from testimony he collected from  Tantura refugees in Syria. He notes several unusual actions, but nowhere  mentions the word “massacre”. On the contrary, he describes a “battle” and  terms the fallen “battle casualties.” This book is in the University of Haifa library, accessible to all. In an  appendix to his book Al-Yahya gives a list of 52 casualties of the battle for  Tantura, a list of those wounded in the battle, and a list of ten more people  “among the elderly and the notables” who died after the war of “sadness  and a broken heart” en route from the refugee camp at Tul-Karm to Syria.  Katz in an appendix to his amended thesis lists 101 victims by name, which  he assembled from various sources without noting which name was given  by which source, while elsewhere in the thesis he claims that there were  200–250 victims. A comparison of Katz’s list with that of al-Yahya, who  knew the people personally, shows that Katz included among his dead the  names of people who appear in al-Yahya’s book in the list of wounded and  in the list of those who died after the war. </page> <page sequence="11"> Review Essay  •  175 Al-Tantura was published 50 years after the battle for Tantura, without  dread of the security forces and without fear of the academic authorities  of the University of Haifa. The author learned from the Tantura refugees  in Syria everything there was to know after so many years, but wonder of  wonders—not a single word referring to a massacre at Tantura! Could it be  that there was no such massacre? Did Pappe and Katz actually know 50 years  after the fact something that this Tantura resident did not know? Perhaps  most telling is Pappe’s own silence on this matter. Since the affair first burst  onto the scene in 2001, several people have pointed out this source, and it  has since been published on the internet.11 But Pappe has held this decisive  evidence back from his reader for the ten years in which he has continued  to engage in the subject, fearing his entire house of cards will come crashing  down at the touch of a finger. Such is Pappe’s academic integrity—such is  the quality of his scientific work. Research and science are of use merely as  instruments for a political ideology with a single goal: the destruction of  the state of Israel as a national Jewish entity. In this book on Israeli academic freedom, Pappe unfolds his viewpoint  of his persecution, the discrimination against him, and his exclusion, “I  became a pariah in my own university,” (90). He relates how he preferred  appearing in any forum abroad rather than in Israel to express his [anti- Zionist] opinions, because in Israel there was no chance at that time to  speak out against the Zionist idea and the iniquity of the oppression of the  Palestinians, certainly no opportunity to mention the nakba or defend the  claim that there was a massacre at Tantura. One by one he reviews some  panel or other from which he was disqualified, and in every case he blames  this or that personality in the establishment who hounded him. His percep- tion of his non-inclusion at a conference on the novel by A.B. Yehoshua,  The Liberated Bride, is noteworthy. The novel includes, among others, a  character who is a kind of “new historian”—and Pappe in his overweening  vanity is convinced that it is he who served as the inspiration of the writer,  who had no notion of it (90–91). But in his usual way Pappe does not let his readers understand why  such an attitude to him took shape. The blame is clearly on “the other.” He  denigrates the Department of Land of Israel Studies: In a department in which almost all its teacher are not Arabic speakers the  history of the country is presented by those who got their wages from the  Jewish Agency, and did not produce even a single critical study, as against the  dozens of scripted research studies on the 1948 war . . .12 </page> <page sequence="12"> 176  •  israel studies, volume 16 number 2 Several other faculty members in other departments received similar cal- umnies and imprecations. Matters came to actual threats when he wrote to  academics in the world of Middle East experts, “I call on you to take a stand  on the disgraceful decision by the University of Haifa, 18 November 2001,”  in connection with Katz’s thesis. Later, “Academia in Israel still largely  depends on the opinions of your colleagues and your [professional] societ- ies . . . You are required most decidedly for the completion and advance of  the tenure procedures . . .”13 Under these circumstances, when Pappe hyperbolized the threats  against the professional advancement of colleagues, when he called every one  of his opponents by a different derogatory sobriquet, when he responded  arrogantly and crudely to all. By virtue of my position, and after many  months of restraint, filed a charge according the regulation “Duties of the  Academic Member” of the University, resting on one clause alone—collegi- ality. Even before the presiding judge of the University’s Faculty Disciplin- ary Court decided whether to hear the charge at all, Pappe turned to world  opinion, which inundated the university with identical chain letters and  others, an episode which Pappe presents so proudly in his book (96–108).  What he does not present are the hundreds of protests received by the  university about his appearances worldwide, about his invective hurled at  the place that gave him his livelihood and his vitriolic onslaughts against  faculty members who dared to oppose him, or failed to become involved in  the controversy. Not without reason did he soon feel that he had become  an outcast at his workplace. Pappe, who decided long ago to devote his life to redeeming the nakba  and obliterating the disgrace of its concealment from the Israeli public, was  not one to yield. He carried this struggle from the public arena to his pri- vate home . . . (ch. 7). Feeling utterly isolated in his university home, and  by contrast being warmly received by the “Palestinians,” Pappe decided to  perform a Narodnaya Volya-style act, and go to the ( Jewish) people direct.  He uprooted himself from the city of his birth and moved to the small quiet  town of Kiryat Tivon, 15 kilometers away. He invited his neighbors to a  friendly evening at his home, where he laid out before them his worldview  of the disappearance of the nakba, and asked them thorny questions about  the origin of the land on which they resided and then about other events on  whose myths they had been raised as Israelis. He used documents (135–39)  on the “expulsion” of the Haifa Arabs showing how they had been penned  up in the “ghetto” of Wadi Nisnas, and on the slaughter of the Arabs of  Lydda. </page> <page sequence="13"> Review Essay  •  177 But even this simple analysis in this chapter is a fabrication, and even  when he held an allegedly historical document in his hand he manipulated  it like clay in the hands of the potter. In his account of the evening, Pappe  cites a document of 5 July 1948, according to which all the Arabs remaining  in Haifa were ordered to cram themselves into Wadi Nisnas, “the poorest  quarter in the city.” He then contributes something of his own: 65,000  Arabs of Haifa were expelled! 10,000 had fled earlier, so that only a few  thousand, whose number he does not state, were left in the city. Pappe poorly researched the 1948 events in Haifa14 and his “facts” are  erroneous, his truths only partial. He quotes Nimr al-Khatib’s book on the  naqba concerning Tantura, but conceals from his readers that the same  author blames the Palestinian leadership and militias for the loss of Haifa.15  About 35,000 of Haifa’s Arabs—three times more than Pappe’s figure—left  before the battle for the city began. About 20,000 fled during the two days  of battle in April 1948 and received aid from the British army. Even Walid  al-Khalidi, so lavishly praised by Pappe as the greatest scholar of the nakba,  wrote as early as 1959 about the loss of Haifa not so long after the events  and blames the British, not the Jewish side.16 The census of the residual Arab population in Haifa in May 1948  returned the figure of 3,566 persons, and a special committee, the Minori- ties Committee, was established to extend help to them. The great majority  were Christians, who packed the courtyard of the Carmelite monastery on  Mt. Carmel in severe conditions. Accordingly it was decided to allow them  to live in the former Arab area. Wadi Nisnas was the residential area of the upper-middle class until  1948, not the poorest quarter as Pappe claims. He could have shared all  this information with his Tivon neighbors, who shed a tear on hearing his  tale, but he apparently was ignorant of the facts or preferred, as with the  readers of this book, to disregard the truth and the facts which run counter  to his fictions, and that might complicate his firm and unequivocal view.  Nor does he forgo a comparison of Jews to “Nazis” (140), although he  holds back from saying it himself and ascribes it to one of his listeners.  Pappe’s neighbors, it seems, were ready to listen to him, but the whine of  the missiles and Katyushas that struck not far from Tivon—more precisely  the thousands of missiles that killed and wounded, and destroyed civilian  villages in Israel, soon silenced the sounds of the battle of 1948. For Pappe,  only one stage now remained before he left Israel for good. The last straw, which finally added unbearably to the whole weight of  the nakba down the generations, was the second Lebanon War in summer  </page> <page sequence="14"> 178  •  israel studies, volume 16 number 2 2006 (ch. 8) and the “killing field in Gaza” (ch. 9). Pappe describes how the  IDF embarked on total war against the Lebanese people and the innocent  organization answering to the name of Hizbullah, which only “wanted  back the piece of Southern Lebanon over which Israel still retained control”  (148). For a moment he again misleads his readers: he forgot to remind them  that from May 2000 Israel’s boundary had been the “Blue Line,” namely  the international border fully recognized by the United Nations, so the  Hizbullah did not have a valid territorial claim. Pappe cannot but connect the struggle in the north to Israel’s ambition  to destroy Hizbullah which he sees as part of a consistent ideology since the  nakba in 1948. “It is not new,” he writes of the huge and disproportionate  offensive launched by the IDF in 2006 against a “low intensity action” of  kidnapping soldiers on the frontier: this is precisely what Israel did in 1948.  It is worth quoting verbatim his entire theory of 1948: In 1948, the Palestinians opted for a low intensity conflict when the UN  imposed on them a deal that wrested away half of their homeland and gave it  to a community of newcomers and settlers, most of whom arrived after 1945.  The Zionist leaders launched an ethnic cleansing operation that expelled half  of the land’s native population destroyed half of its villages . . . (149) In Pappe’s eyes the Palestinians wished only to protest against the UN  Partition resolution which would enable them to establish their own state  alongside the Jewish state. It was against this modest, “low intensity” protest  that the “Zionists” reacted with a campaign of systematic and murderous  ethnic cleansing, tearing out and expelling, destroying and eliminating . . .  Later in chapter 8, he perfects the methods of the State of Israel, for now  it no longer conducts only “ethnic cleansing” or wishes to destroy Hizbul- lah. According to him, “In September 2006, Israel commenced a genocidal  policy against Gaza” (153). Genocide! No less than that! And why did Israel  operate in Gaza at all? From summer 2005 not a single Israeli soldier or  settler was to be found in the Gaza Strip. Israel carried out a unilateral dis- engagement that gave rise to some internal Israeli discord, but to the relief  of most Israelis the unfortunate episode of control of Gaza came to an end. Pappe does not trouble to explain this to his readers, but of course  finds a way out from doing so. He notes in one sole sentence that after  the withdrawal of the IDF missiles were fired by separatist groups such  as Hamas or the Jihad. But why should they fire missiles at Israel and the  inhabitants of the Negev precisely after the evacuation of Gaza? What else  is there to demand of Israel in summer 2006 on the Gaza border? He has  </page> <page sequence="15"> Review Essay  •  179 no explanation, nor is there any need for one: it is all part of a general plan,  whose end is “the total de-Arabisation of Palestine” (149). The Epilogue is a heavy and dreary look at Pappe by Pappe himself. If  the reader has expected to get a grasp on the struggle for academic freedom  in Israel, which in 2009–2010 assumed a new and dangerous visage, uncon- nected to Pappe he will not find it even in the Epilogue. He is still preoc- cupied with himself, with his own life course, and with turning himself  from a product of the Israeli education system into a citizen of the world  and seeker of its good. He plots the course of his leaving Israel as the inevi- table end of a purely ideological struggle. It is a twofold struggle: for Israeli  admission of guilt for the nakba and the need to correct the wrong done to  the Palestinians by Zionism by dismantling the Jewish national state and  creating a secular and democratic Palestinian state; and finally, for academic  freedom, embodied in fact in Pappe’s own experience. He closes the circle  begun in his book with a full account of the iniquities of the Zionist act:  from the start of the settlement, which in the 1880’s concealed its aims of  taking control of the land, to Israel’s war crimes in Gaza. And academic freedom in Israel? What of that? My regrets, but for that  the questioner must go elsewhere. Pappe offers not even a morsel of the  great controversy over academic freedom in Israel, on the two planes on  which the struggle is going forward. One is the academic boycott of Israel,  with Pappe among its supporters, perhaps even its instigators, and the other  is the internal struggle of the right wing against lecturers, curricula, and  various universities in Israel. Pappe identifies academic freedom in Israel  with Pappe alone—what he has done, what has been done to him, what  has been denied him. His life is set forth in the book as if it were the history of the struggle  for academic freedom in Israel. Before him no one fought for it, nor has  anyone after him. He refers only by allusion to his part in the imposition  of the academic boycott on Israel by the British lecturers’ organizations.  Because he knows that the wrath of Israeli academics was directed mainly  at him on account of his part in the calls for the boycott beginning in 2004  and more especially in 2005, and thereafter in its various transformations,  he greatly minimizes his own place in the boycott, being content with  its moral justification (192–95). Pappe knows that the academic boycott  is likely to cause incalculable damage to Israeli academe. He finds noth- ing wrong in the fact that the academic boycott is in the first place an act  opposed to the nature and to the very existence of academe, which he sup- posedly rises up to protect in his book. He ignores the fact that he called for  a boycott of the institution that provides a living for himself and his family,  </page> <page sequence="16"> 180  •  israel studies, volume 16 number 2 and that had he done such a thing at any other university in the world—or  at any other workplace—he would have been dismissed there and then. Pappe is able to enumerate the emails he received from supporters  when a complaint was made against him for his collegial behavior, but  he does not refer to the struggle for academic freedom waged by his own  university and others against the boycott, to the thousands of expressions  of support for Israeli academe and condemnation of the boycott as anti- academic to the core. Hundreds of emails and protests of Israelis at home  and abroad, more than expressing amazement at how a person could call  for a boycott against the source of his own livelihood, were dumbfounded  that no one cut him down officially. Pappe enjoyed unbridled academic  freedom, not limited by the institution he called to ban. Still more, although he blackened its name, and besmirched the honor  of his fellows at the institution, the University allowed Pappe freedom of  action even when time after time he violated the regulations. He was even  considered for promotion in rank, another fact he forgets to share. Since  he left Israel, the matter of the boycott has been raised again from different  quarters, and in every case true academics in the world of scholarship have  proved able to ignore it, and to ridicule the boycott and those who call for  increasing its severity. To everyone, except Pappe’s and his friends’ circle of  hatred, it was clear that academe in Israel is the fortress of democracy in  the country, safeguarding its semblance and image as a state and society  possessing liberal, democratic, and universal values—despite the deeds of  governments of Israel and perhaps indeed against them. In 2009–2010 when he was preparing his book, had he shown any  interest, Pappe could have witnessed academics in Israel struggling against  tendencies to curtail academic freedom. The struggle is taking place at  present against politicians, ministers, and right-wing and pseudo-Zionist  organizations that seek to intensify supervision of curricula, course syllabi,  and lecturers singled out by the oppressors of the academy. But what has  any of that to do with him? True, he promises his readers in the book’s  title to deal with this—but instead confines his account to himself and  his own doings. For all that, what does the reader learn from such a book? This book is  interesting in that it seems to embody Pappe’s entire worldview masked in  a would-be academic approach and founded on his entangled inner world.  He wants to explain why he left Israel, and why his place is with those  who do anything and everything they can to put an end to the “Zionist  project.” On its ruins he wants to see a secular democratic Palestinian state  arise, in which he and his friends will live in tranquility. To that end he has  </page> <page sequence="17"> Review Essay  •  181 woven a tale beginning and ending with the Zionist vision that he views as  colonialist and nationalistic. The State of Israel, according to Pappe, was born in dreadful sin, the  sin of the Palestinian nakba, and it has turned into a disfigured state, power- driven and directed by a strong brutal army. Israel intends to rid the country  of all its Arabs, and to complete the “ethnic cleansing,” which it began in  1948 but had planned many years earlier. For this purpose Pappe fabricates a plot that combines general histori- cal processes with the personal process he has undergone, and he blows  the Tantura affair up as an actual historic turning point—personal and  worldwide. The affair ripped the mask off the true face of the state of Israel  from the moment of its creation. The refusal to recognize his student’s  thesis is like the refusal to acknowledge the nakba—the cause to which he  has dedicated his life and for which he has been hounded, isolated, and  betrayed. In his book he reflects the worn-out equipment he has used in  all his publications and arguments in the public debate, intended to ter- minate the existence of the Zionist entity: disregard of facts, unfounded  manipulations of historical material, exploitation of sensitive points by  likening the nakba to the Holocaust to justify the use of oral testimonies  as a historical source, specifically in accounts of the Arab defeat, and abuse  of contemporary expressions such as “ethnic cleansing” and “genocide.” There is one side that sins and is evil, the Israeli, and one side that is  innocent and oppressed, the Palestinian. Pappe will naturally not mention  to his readers that after the 1948 war 156,000 Arab residents remained in  the state of Israel, but that every territory occupied by Arab armies was  totally “cleansed” of Jewish settlements, or every Israeli military unit taken  by the Palestinians in 1948 was wiped out with unspeakable cruelty, and the  corpses of the combatants defiled. Such, for example, were the slaughter  and destruction at Gush Etzion, Kfar Darom and Be’erot Yitzhak, Hartuv,  Mishmar Hayarden, or the convoy of the 35 and the fallen of Nabi Samuel.  Those who perpetrated ethnic cleansing were in fact the Arabs, wherever  they won a victory. But why spoil his theory. This book has gone entirely out of academic focus, and Pappe has lost  not only any semblance of a historian but any measure of self-evaluation  by representing himself as embodying within himself personally all history.  The tactic of claiming victimization combined with personal paranoia color  every chapter of the book. He misses the qualitative contradiction in his theory: if Jewish nation- alism embodies only military force and colonialism, and if in nationalism  generally liberalism, socialism, and humanism cannot exist, how can he  </page> <page sequence="18"> 182  •  israel studies, volume 16 number 2 indeed welcome the possibility of Palestinian nationalism? Nationalism  is nationalism, isn’t it? Not in Pappe’s view. His prayer is that the 200th  anniversary of Herzl’s birth, in 2060, or perhaps the 200th anniversary of  his death later, will be “celebrated in a democratic, secular state of Palestine”  (12). This sentence is the whole book in a nutshell. Notes 1. A disclaimer: I am involved in the book personally and publicly at once,  and the critique before us is not a routine review of a new book but a polemic with  its author. Nor could this be a dry academic scrutiny of the work’s content and  scholarly argument, it being weighed down with political ideologies and the writer’s  sheer narcissism. Therefore the survey too is somewhat personal, and somewhat his- torically objective. I was personally involved in a considerable share of the “Pappe  incidents,” the author’s grievances, and ultimately his departure from the University  of Haifa and my computer is bursting with hundreds of relevant documents. The  fact that he and I have apparently preserved the same materials does enable me to  gauge how he uses them astutely, partially and selectively, to fabricate the story of  his life and his personal ostracism, a narrative which he has camouflaged under the  titillating title “The Struggle for Academic Freedom in Israel.” 2. This has been taking place in the country in recent years, and it engages  many, myself included, who are assailed throughout the present book for harming  that freedom. 3.
