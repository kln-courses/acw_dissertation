<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Face of the Deep JOHN DERRICKSON MCCURDY N my beginning, I enter a world which has already begun. At conception, or at quickening, my soul enters a matrix, and my materiality is nourished in my mother, whose body was born long before my conception. At birth, expelled from the womb, my breathing organism enters an unborn world, or a world begun long ago. My expulsion is a new beginning in a progressive process which repeatedly begins in the newborn. In my beginning, the world is again renewed in a living creature who, cradled in the maternal embrace, cannot per- ceive the approaching end; when the world begins, at last, in me, I am unaware that my birth is an external fact in a deathless world where the newborn must perish. I have not yet confronted the outer world; my painful birth, which I experienced inwardly, I have never perceived from the outside. Born innocent, I perceive the cosmos as a world which began with me. Originally, nature is not a surface which I confront. I do not frontally per- ceive my environment, because, in me, the ancient world begins as a newborn world, my body; the vast exterior surrounds the world which I am, a small cosmos which insulates my soul. I animate my body without confronting my face, without facing my skin as an impersonal surface. My family shields my flesh, lets me perceive the material environment as a domestic exterior which I possess longitudinally, along my limbs, as my bodily prolongation. My desirous grasp draws satisfaction from a sensuous depth which enlarges my globular cosmos. My personal sphere suffuses the surroundings; I am the cosmic center and the things around me are my personal possessions; I inhabit a world without apparent exterior; the depth beyond my center is within my sphere. The alien abyss outside my person is unperceived, or vaguely felt as a dreadful presence hidden beyond the domicile whose furnishings I possess along the radius of my reach, along the radiations of my desire. My body is born, and nourished, as a personal world which begins with me, grows with me, and obscures the boundless world which I am not. Suddenly, or gradually, I lose my innocence; I lose my intimate communion with nature.

Shocked, I recoil; the world withdraws into psychic distance; I frontally perceive, across the gap, an alien exterior. My inward exteriority opens outward; through opened windows, my interiority beams across the gaping space, and strikes, yonder, an exterior not yet internalized, a fathomless chaos of alien externals, a world already structured maybe, but void, because devoid of my personal form. No longer immersed in a familiar habitat, I begin my life again, begin now the life of confrontation, a homeless encounter with the indifferent universe. Newly bereft of blissful ignorance, I discover a world which began long before I was born; I discover my birth as a fact in the world. No longer naive, I perceive now my former innocence. UNINSPIRED CREATIVITY Confronting the deep as a stranger in a strange world, I begin the life of perceptual struggle. Laboriously, I must disengage my private sphere from the world beyond my reach; I must disentangle my personal feelings from the unfeel- ing facts. Beginning the labor of exteriority, I abandon my lost innocence; manfully, I externalize my mind, open my private sphere, exit from my womb, escape from the maternal embrace, flee from my primitivity, my infantile immer- sion in bodily feelings; I dispossess myself of my prepossessions, divest my soul of the clinging dreams; I reject my emotional interiority, the inward world without exterior, and eject my soul into the external world where the newborn body is another exterior in limitless exteriority, an outer depth which seems a personal universe when beclouded by my moods. Mental externalization is a natural impulse, but is nonetheless a laborious achievement, because the nearby exterior is always mine, always an extended corporeity, or a bodily extension which I possess longitudinally, intimately, without confrontation. The organism beneath my skin is always, or normally, an exterior which I animate; my organs pulse with emotion; my sentient corpse interposes a sentimental thickness be- tween my center and the uninhabited exterior, the alien surroundings where my moods lack significance. Perhaps, however, I cannot forget my primitive paradise. I refuse the labor of exteriority; I begin, instead, the task of inwardness. Painfully, I enlarge my subjectivity; expanding outward from my center, I draw the world inside my ego. Mental internalization is a natural impulse, a compulsion, even, for the introvert, but is always a laborious achievement, is inevitably a labor never quite achieved, because the exterior beyond my body is seldom mine, and my own flesh may be- come an alien external when shaken by spasms or benumbed by paralysis. Con- fronting dreadful depth, I begin my personal renewal; I commence a recovery of the innocence which I lost when I perceived that the world did not begin with my beginning. I ignore, I mentally exclude those externals which are not my own. Because I demand intimacy with nature, I recognize only those things which I can appropriate. I disbelieve that I live in an established cosmos, a birthless or anciently born environs; there exists, I insist, only my world, only the nature</page><page sequence="3">THE FACE OF THE DEEP 357 which is intimately mine, the exterior which is my own flesh. I create the world through visionary appropriation of the earth which confronts me; I create my own creation even, making my birth a newborn vision. In my beginning as an artist, when I begin my confrontal life as a perceptual labor of inwardness, the surrounding world becomes raw material for ideal appropriation. My body, seen from the outside, and my bodily environment, seen outside my personal sphere, I now regard as nothing but the things which I recognize. The world is what I see, what I say; I bring the world into existence with my look, my word. Undeniably, I face a surrounding depth; I confront something yonder which is not myself, not mine; but this brute presence is not yet a thing, not a personalized entity; the only things established are my things, the things which I have creatively inaugurated. The unmade, nameless, externals are only materials for my making, givens for my taking. Nature is a primeval wasteland, a chaos unstructured by my personal appropriation, lacking, thus, all recognizable properties. I face, not intelligible solidity, but a surface, shimmering on an abyss of surfaces; I confront a sensational integument whose sensuous depth invites my indiscretion. I embrace the temptress in visionary toils; I am reborn, and enter again a world which is begun with my beginning. Admittedly, my look and word, my touch, create an imaginary world; I create, not the world which created me, but an image of that world. Nonetheless, the phantasy has substance, because rooted in depth; my flimsy artifice gives me entry into yonder reality. Naturally, the manufactured essence has its own reality; the symbol is an artifact, a thing. The artist is a craftsman who produces merchan- dise; his workshop is a physical habitation; his handtooled commodities are physical furnishings, which must be insured against natural peril. Immured in his studio, protecting his material possessions, the artist inhabits a private estate; surrounded with opaque artifacts, the seer is isolated from communal territory; but the artifacts, seen as symbols, are transparent; through his fenestrated walls the artist sees the world, in a creative framework. The world of images is a world of images of the world. Visually appropriated, the outer world becomes simply the yonder depth of my inner world; I hold within my vision the inscape, the intimate interior, of the outer landscape. Seeking a sophisticated innocence, an infantile civility, my estranged spirit moves over the face of the deep, attempting the task of internalization. Creation is inspiration, an inspiritation of the externals; my creativity aetherializes the brute materials as I breathe my spirit into the lifeless exterior. But my inspirita- tion is, so far, uninspired; my spirit, my embodied soul, creates without external guidance, without orientation from outside my subjective redoubt. Because my creative activity does not follow external indicators which point the proper direc- tion, my labor is a volitional exercise, a merely human achievement; I work with dead, nondirectional, matter, and produce an artifact whose liveliness is my own spontaneity, externalized. Unfortunately, my expressive effort may increase my estrangement; I cannot create a living bond with the exterior if my creativity is unbound. If yonder depth suggests directions for human activity, my imperious</page><page sequence="4">358 JOHN DERRICKSON MC CURDY spontaneity will violate nature, will produce a purely imaginary realm which isolates me from the exterior, my visionary appropriation will be inappropriate, an impropriety, a personal seizure which ignores the properties inherent in depth. My uninspired inspiritation can personalize the world, but cannot recreate my innocent habitat, because originally I respired within a world which solicited my gestures; I breathed an emotional atmosphere which arose not merely from my body, but from my surroundings. When I lose my innocence, the emotive aura evaporates, and I gasp for air; my exhalation, without inspiritation, leaves me breathless; uninspired creation exhausts my interior depth; I pant for inspiritation from outside. Unless my personal expression, my inspiritation of the externals, becomes once more a respiration within the world, I must withdraw from the exterior, and confront the deep without creativity. MUNDANE INFLUENCES Facing yonder depth, I project my inner light, which clears a path through the enveloping obscurity. The hither gleam searches for external illumination, seeks a lighted route into the abyss. The subjective searchlight beams willfully; I direct my sight wherever I will; my visual ray traces whatever figurations I wish. Until I espy an outer light, my visionary patterns remain fanciful, a surface tracery which does not carve in depth, does not produce a substantial ideality. My fancies seek solid habitation, seek roots in the mundane opacity which hides beneath the projected decorations. Until the outer light captures my eye, my gaze wanders, entoiled in my own tracery; I retrace my subjective figurations, solidifying my insolidity. The inner light wanders in darkness, in the darkness of my inward illuminations. Shadowed with doubt, dim with despondency, the lost gaze probing from my socket catches sight of the sun; an inhuman fire pierces the gloom. From the eye of heaven flare directional rays which catch my eye as lights and highlights; I see celestial fire reflected in polished stone, sparkling on terrestrial waters. My leaden shutters retract, opening wide a moistened eye; my outlook brightens as my optic burns with delight, reflecting as a highlight the flame which inspires me. The eye which wandered darkly, or gleamed only with inner delerium, wanders still, but explores now a tangled circuitry which invites my travel, provides my vagabondage with external guidance. Ocular gesture becomes procreative, a productive interpenetration of hither depth with material depth yonder. The hidden deep advances from its endless recesses, stands re- vealed in the searching light, which illumines my probing gaze. Material Inspiration My creativity is initially activated by a material spark. Sunlight is an aetherial matter which becomes transparent in vision; the outer light is a sensory medium which orientates my inner directionality along physical pathways. The light illu- mines lines whose tangible tracery enlightens the sight. Material marks, bodily contours, when lighted, become spiritual guides, because the light is already a line, an indicative stylus. Electrified tubes and globes are centers of luminous</page><page sequence="5">THE FACE OF THE DEEP 359 energy, central points which generate streaming radiations. The spread or con- tracted rays are pointing gestures: scattering all around the source, the emitted rays indicate expansively the global scene; shining through an aperture, gathered in a concave reflector, or collected in a lens, the beam contracts, the rays concen- trate their force, the focused light becomes a spotlight which directs my gaze precisely, like a pointing finger, or a sharpened stick. Every light displays a style of emission, and reveals the surroundings with a distinctive gesture. Like a sweep- ing arm with open hand and spreading fingers, the diffusive light guides the gaze around the clearing without arresting my eye at a single point, while the focused beam, like a thrusting forefinger, directs the gaze to a definite spot. The gener- alized light leads the eye in endless vagabondage, while the specifying light, the spotlight, arrests my gaze, brings the roving eye to a standstill, rivets my attention. Spreading or concentrated, emitted rays are luminous lines which establish lines of sight. Displayed in the spotlight, or highlighted within the overall lighting, I descry lines, lighted pathways, scratched or pigmented tracery on the surfaces which stand before me, and on the horizontal surfaces upon which I stand; before my face and under my feet ravel lines which captivate my attention, and draw my gaze across breadth or into depth. Centered in the clearing, I stand on a plane, amidst lighted uprights; all around me, running between the verticals, I see converging lines which point toward the encircling horizon. From distant points around the circumference, tapering pathways expand toward my face, spread beneath my restless feet. The shining horizonal rays, expanding toward me and contracting away, situate my body in the center, but draw me toward the periph- ery. The rotary horizon coils the vertical panorama around my body, gesticulates, with expanding pathways, toward my central standpoint, gestures, with contract- ing paths, toward peripheral points on the outer circle. Though centrally located, I cannot maintain my poised equilibrium, because every lighted locale has a linear style; the horizontal network draws my body toward the periphery in several directions, but not equally, and not in every direction. Always centered, but always decentered and recentering, my rotating body is drawn hither and yon: here my embodied gaze, which runs ahead of my footsteps, is drawn yonder in one way; but there, when the yonder locale becomes my hither position, my gaze will be drawn yonder in another way, along other paths, with a different style, with a linear impulse distinctive of that locale. Every locus has an inscrip- tion which guides me toward other locations. This place, where I now stand and stare, directs my look and footfall toward other places, and not all places with equal force, but some places more forcefully, perhaps some single place with irresistable emphasis. From every inhabited locale spreads a linear network, a directional filigree whose intertwining suggests, mosttimes, a dominant direction, a route which will dominate my desirous advance. Guided by lights and lines, I advance toward the beckoning horizon; I move into the background, creating in my bodily environs an artifact which externalizes the inner light and digests the outer light. Penetrating the lighted surface of</page><page sequence="6">360 JOHN DERRICKSON MC CURDY yonder deep, I discover further surfaces, as the environment is again clarified by the light and the gaze; I assemble these surfaces, these facets of material reality, into an artificial face. My visionary appropriation produces a presentational spread which plumbs the deep; the artwork is not a facade, but a face, a single surface sedimenting the assembled facets as a deep surface which gives me the essence of depth. The artist, in his work, respires his surroundings, breathes the light which inflames his vision; the wanton illuminations give me life in the world, let me prolong my body into a world which is my own, transmuting the alien waste into my intimate dwelling. But this light whose inspirational glory saves me from spiritual death with each dawning is a material influx. The medium which draws forth my life is not alive; the light comes alive when I live in the light. The artist confronts a material depth whose humanized face expresses my own interiority in a physical essence. The lively light, and the inspired artifact, become spiritual only through my idolatry.* Human Inspiration Alone, confronting inhuman depth, and then alone with the light, immersed in matter, I search yonder for another spirit, a mortal creature like myself. This vast materiality, lively but not alive, mechanically animated but spiritually inani- mate, may somewhere exhibit an exotic humanity. Unless I discover a foreign locale already inhabited, I shall feel that my incarnate spirit is incarcerated amidst boundless externality, where the only human visage is my own. My perceptual labor brings into view plentiful faces, but these icons are the expressive outside of my solitary interiority; every face is an aspect of my own multifaceted soul; alone with material inspiration I create my own visage; the personalized externals reflect only my privacy. When I gaze into eyes, the lenses are always mine, windows where my own soul shines forth, as from a silvered glass. Hollow things have interiors, but the inside of a container is a yondersided interiority, an inside which I always perceive outside my personal sphere as an impersonal exterior. When I look inside a box, I see the introverted surfaces as externals which I confront. Physical interiority is externality, a spatial extension which spiritual interiority perceives as inherently uninhabited. The spiritual lightsource is a concentrated point, but my soul normally shines outside the center; *My article, "Internalizing the Outer Light," Journal of the American Academy of Religion 34(4):419-429 (1971), provides a description of material inspiration, not spiritual, and not divine, inspiration, though my account does not exclude these further influences. A more detailed, and more technical, description of luminous directionality may be found in my article "The Sensory Media," Journal of the British Society for Phe- nomenology 3 (2) :165-186 (1972). There I also describe the motile directionality which guides our touch. Light and motion are not only routes which organize perceptual ex- ploration but levels where our active perception dwells. Visionary activity requires an unperceived medium which we temporarily inhabit, until accumulated adventure shifts our dwelling elsewhere. Gradually we move to another level of bodily operation; we move into another sensory environment, an operative invisibility which reorganizes the visible panorama, opening new routes for our travel.</page><page sequence="7">THE FACE OF THE DEEP 361 embodied life is a spiritual inhabitation of outer space. During creative percep- tion, I prolong my expansive soul beyond the bodily sphere; I incorporate alien depth. The sensible things yonder, hollow objects and solid things too, have a material interiority, a dimension of sensuosity. My perceptual thrust penetrates the inscape of things, gives me familiarity with the earth. The sensational facets which flash from the outside of solid things, form the inside and outside of hollow things, become transparent, come inside my visual sphere, assemble in my vision as the hither dimension of material depth. But this interiority which I discover in the sensible thing when I internalize its qualities is again a yonder- sided interiority, an inwardness outside the soul, an inscape which the soul enters from the hither side. The sensuous depth yonder remains potentially external even when internalized, remains material despite the inspiritation. The intimate physical dimension is not the interiority which my solitary gaze now seeks. Sensations flash from yonder depth, from a wall, from a vacant windowglass sealing a deserted room. Scanning the sensational panorama, I suddenly see a facet which indicates human presence. From an eyeglass, or from the white of an eye, my camera receives an impression which sees, and I perceive that I am not alone. I see eyes which are not mine, orbs which scan my own eyes, orbs which draw my body into their orbit, and engulf my soul. The eye is a dioptrical instrument whose exterior exhibits a hither side, an alien interiority, which spies upon my solitude, from outside. I behold before me a tremulous surface tilted toward the light, and see shadowed sockets which encase glistening bulbs. Where else in the cosmos do we witness such subtle inflection of elemental forces? Moisture and fire play across the peeled convexity. Behind a transparent mem- brane I see a central aperture in a colored disk; the iris is a target, the dark hole a bordered bullseye, an elastic window which dilates and shrinks, while the disk darts about between shutters. Nictitating lids phrase the gleam, lashes modulate the highlight, articulating directional indicatives. The eyes, set in a face, set in a bodily framework, display a material depth, a sensuous luminosity; but the outer light, when reflected from ocular flesh, transmits an inner light, toward my observing body; the sunlight becomes a medium, an emissary, which bears the yonder interiority across the intervening void, to my side. I experience now a spiritual inspiration, a personal influence where spirit quickens the material influx. The bodily frame, the facial framework, the enframed eyes, inspire my visionary appropriation, not merely because the sunlight plays seductively across the fleshly surfaces, but because a spirit yonder employs the physical lures as a personal invitation. A soul yonder entices me into a spiritual abyss; the intimate landscape becomes, in the ocular locale, the inscape of spirit. Bewitched by haunted optics, I admit into my private sphere an alien subjectivity; a stranger domesticates my artwork by personally phrasing the decompacted facets which flash from the lenses. Mesmerized, I respire a spiritual aura. The embodied spirit stands before my face, faces my front surface, assumes a stance which activates my erotic craft. The body stands in the outer light, and already the lighting produces a corporeal expression. Already the body has</page><page sequence="8">362 JOHN DERRICKSON MC CURDY expressive properties, a material disposition, and a pose, but the inhabitant spirit employs the light and the lighted properties as personal features which project a personality. Material properties become spiritual snares which seize my eyesight; the posturing spirit uses my captivated organs as his own possessions, utilizes my hypnotized physiognomy as a speculum which prolongs his personality into my sphere. Sleepwalking, I pose the body in the light and arrange the limbs; under my direction, following my directives, the body assumes a stance, an attitude, adopts a gesture. But the yonder soul, through his crystalline windows, sees my fascination, sees his pose reflected in my features, sees projected from my face the inner disposition which motivates my spoken directions. The yonder human is inwardly disposed to be posed, is predisposed to adopt distinctive postures. I perceive yonder a spellbinder who positions his material properties before my face so that my visionary grasp of his body becomes his imaginative possession of my vision. Captivated, I capture, and pose, and possess a person who, fascinated with my captivation, poses himself, and employs my posture, my gestures, my painterly deposits, as personal projections; my visionary appropriation becomes his personal possession, a prolongation of his visionary possession of his own exterior. The outer light is a blind illumination which blindly poses the yonder body, but the inner light yonder is a vision which seeks a favorable lighting, seeks my admiration. The yonder visionary sees that I behold his body, and he seeks to excite my idolatry. Idolatrous Divinity Inspiration aetherializes mortal persons and the inhuman earth; the artwork glorifies the inspirational source, divinizes mundane reality. The world seems simple on a dull day; reflected in a jaundiced eye, the world appears in a single perspective, seems a positive reality whose properties are boringly obvious. Everyday nature is unastonishing, hardly worth noticing except as a device for satisfying physical needs; the conventionalized earth evokes no commentary, or stimulates only a shrug which dismisses the day in a phrase, a monosyllable. Inspiration is a natural miracle which renders the mundane extraordinary, makes the routine event truly remarkable. Viewing the prosaic externals with a dull eye, I am rudely startled: lightning strikes the panorama, and I see an aureola expand around the blasted epicenter. Emanating material and spiritual influences, the electrified object unfolds hidden aspects and populates the burning air with invisible images. The multiple radiations display the focal corporeality in diver- gent lights, in diverse contexts; the neighboring objects are seen in numerous settings, and each stageset broaches a new perspective. The mundane influx spreads a halo around the object, a glowing atmosphere clouded with sensuous intermediaries, translucent layers which exhibit solidity in ghostly glimpses. Only the inflamed eye sees the glory; the swarming films are invisible except to the artist, who makes them public in the artobject. The desirous eye shatters the presentational surface into facets, takes numberless perspectives upon a panorama which, to a profane view, seems immediately evident. Artistic labor</page><page sequence="9">THE FACE OF THE DEEP 363 decompresses brute reality, makes the sensible presentation polyfaceted; each aesthetic glimpse clarifies nature in a new mode. The artwork decompacts yonder positivity in atmospheric slices, and recompresses the significant frag- ments in a manufactured face which eliminates the nonessential views, the perspectives which inscribe the retina but lack productive depth. Each explora- tory glance cuts a separate sliver which invites creative synthesis, a comprehensive grasp which would gather the glimpses in a single vision. The artwork memori- alizes the momentary influx; in the inspissate paint the stupifying firesource is perduringly glorified; the flaring halo bathes my eyes, engulfs my mnemonic gesture; the artwork fossilizes the aura, preserves the emotive atmosphere in a commodity which can ignite the faded mood. My devotional toil glorifies the object whose glory swallowed my body. I produce the artwork while idolizing the mundane objects which interest me; and the finished artifact is an idol which immortalizes the aureola by repeatedly exciting my worship. Aesthetic labor and the crafted image divinize the mundane externals, make the world super- mundane; but mortals and materials possess only idolatrous divinity, unless my idolatry is divinely inspired. DIVINE INFLUENCE Inhaling the mundane influences, my soul scents a divine effluvium. I see, floating on the face of the deep, lights which guide me into material depth, and I see lighted eyes which lead me into spiritual depth, but I now inhale divine light, a personal spirit which transports my soul beyond humanity. Hidden yonder, resides a personality more remote, more powerful, than the human persona, a nearly limitless energy which, even now, lures me beyond my bounds. I vaguely sense that the face of the abyss is the face of god, a foreign visage which assumes human guise in the artwork. Why does this particular landscape, this special climate, seize my spirit? Why does the topography of this body, of this face, arrest my attention? Why does this landscape, and not another, this fleshly configuration, not that other, draw me into depth, become an intimate environment? Secretly, these astonishing places, these intriguing surfaces, are manifestations of a divine face. Divine features are disclosed yonder as the lineaments of the world. Topographical illuminations, facial lightings, are divine moods which move my spirit, render my soul ecstatic. When I experience a theophany, the worldly elements become the breath, the halation, of divinity. The mundane scenery is a mask, a facade, hiding a withdrawn deity who prepares his advent. Aesthetic Theophany If I feel that the face of the deep is the face of deity, I confidently seek the divine glance. Where yonder do I witness a theophany? The sacred light shines sometimes in the outer light, the sunlight, the starshine, the earthbound fires, and shines sometimes in the inner light yonder, in the animated ocular light. When I experience a theophany, the human eye yonder becomes the eye</page><page sequence="10">364 JOHN DERRICKSON MC CURDY of god; the inhuman sun becomes a highlight on the eye of heaven. A gleaming eye, a shining face, becomes my sun; the blue sky becomes an expressive vista; celestial tracks, terrestrial marks, become facial features which transport me into the bosom of deity. Theopathically, I believe that the heavenly and earthly luminaries are living lights which gaze upon my body; I feel that a ruling spirit disposes nature so as to inspire me. The god who lives in the light lives also in the shaded light, and becomes in the shadows manifest as an absent light. The deity, mingling his gaze with mine, inspires, sometimes, a joyful mood, but sometimes inspires a depressive tonality. Theophany displays a sombre god, a frowning, brooding deity, a saturnine spirit, who lurks in copper leaves, in violet clay, in the melancholy haze of late summer sundowns. I encounter this god again another year, in midsummer, changed but still familiar. The noon sun drops opaque shadows under eaves and shrubs, foiling the absent light against baking concrete, burning gravel, against blazing panels of crumpled steel, slabs of enameled iron, heaped in a scrapyard. The luminary which casts these vertical shades, drops the darkness also in eyesockets, under the nose, beneath the nether lip; the light falls obliquely across a straining torso, ripples over ribcage and sinew. From under the brows, from beneath these bushy eaves, emerges a human look which inhabits the lighted landscape and makes the material surroundings a bodily topography. From caves in the skull, from hollows in the body, from grottos in the rusting junkscape, from empty doors in ruinous sheds, from tangled nooks under spreading oaks, flows the dark aureola of my muse. A theophany transfigures the mundane panorama. Sometimes, though rarely, the god fully indwells a person, a thing, a landscape, a peopled countryside, so that, in every light, from every angle, from every standpoint, I experience the inspirational presence. But, soon enough, the god draws back, dwells less fully, and I glimpse aspects which arouse no emotion, or I see negative facets, which destroy my trance. Then the god withdraws entire, leaving me with the fading memory of perfect visions. Dispirited, I contemplate the deep, awaiting a renewed manifestation. Soon, perhaps, I see the god in another locale, located in another body, staged in an unexpected setting; elated, elevated, I enjoy again the full presence. Such complete transfiguration only partially fills my perceptual life, and most frequently the theophany is only partial. Moreover, the rare theophany which completely transports my vision is so preternaturally absorbing because I am, myself, partial; I have a partiality for this particular perspective; my slant, or angle of view, is limited. I do not feel the divine influx everywhere, but here in the immediate landscape, and not here always, but here in this light, and not always in this light, but now from this angle. The god appears in this lighting, in this perspective, from this standpoint, and thus theophany stimulates a contem- plative struggle to get into position, achieve the viewpoint, frame the view, get the right slant, the correct angle, the appropriate perspective. Not everything is interesting, nor every facet of a thing; not every staging, not every pose, can reveal the indwelling god. Because I only partially experience the full presence,</page><page sequence="11">THE FACE OF THE DEEP 365 because I experience the presence only partially at various times and in disparate places, theophany inspires subjective construction. Toilsomely I assemble the illuminated aspects in a unitary artwork which excludes the unenlightening angles. With drawing instrument, I inscribe the scene yonder on the surface before me, under my hand; but I have felt the same emotive pattern on a previous occasion when I depicted a different person ensconced in other scenery; through my repeated appropriations of various persons in varied surroundings, I inscribe a series of surfaces where I see a single personality, a unitary personal style which enduringly commands my devotion. The successive inscriptions appear as unsus- pected facets of a single face; I see in these novel expressions a personal presence, beyond humanity, which shines through the material masks. I am frequently unsure whether my inspiration is human or divine. Was it this person, with this glance, who captured my vision, or was it a superhuman personality who haunts these humans, speaking through mundane gesture, inaudibly teaching me the visionary style which reveals hidden deity? Anthropomorphic Personification When I feel a divine presence in the mundane surroundings, I perceive a personal style in the sensible apparitions; I experience the dancing panorama as an expressive personality; but, originally, I do not personify this superhuman person; I do not imagine behind the scenes an anthropomorphic deity, or a god with animal attributes. The god resides in the scenery, shines through the pan- orama; his personality is sensibly present; the sensible landscape is his living flesh. When a theophany perishes, the god withdraws from the scene, retreats into the faceless depth, but in his disappearance the god loses his face, loses, even, his inner organs if his personal sphere shrinks to a central point. When the sphere expands, and bursts through the surface, into the clear zone, coloring the air, the body of the god is the material depth visible before my face; the visage of the god is the sensible surface before my eyes; and the breath of the god is the aureola which tinges my vision; beyond the clear zone the god has no halo, be- yond the cleared surface the god has no face, has no organism except in the obscure depth yonder. Nonetheless, I can personify the deity; like the pagans and primitives, I can imagine an unseen human or animal which embodies the personal style displayed in the visible environment. The living pattern evident in the stormclouds I may pictorially present as the frowning face of a bearded man, whose drawn brows darken his eyes, just as the lowering thunderheads overcast the sun; his beard blackens his cheek, just as the lightless trees blot the sky. The personal style evident in silken pillows, powdered breasts, plump rosebuds, and pouting lips, I can exhibit as a goddess recumbent in her boudoir. I depict a person whose every aspect excites my venery, a delusory woman who displays the erotic in every perspective. Mundane persons, who exhibit naturally this feminine pat- tern, have other aspects. The divergent perspectives become evident in other circumstances, when I behold in a woman conflictory deities, or see nothing</page><page sequence="12">366 JOHN DERRICKSON MC CURDY divine, merely prosaic facticity. Pillows become soiled, require laundering; roses require weeding; breasts become pendulous and shrunken; lips become chapped, twisted in distaste. Undaunted, my lust pictures a personage who pos- sesses only the erotic aspect, who assumes only the seductive pose, who postures, disposes her flesh, only in verdant gardens, in garlanded bowers. This picture person, this idol assembled from facets, I may see in my sleep, or in daytime de- lusions, and imagine that the goddess lives customarily behind the scenes, animat- ing various humans in varied circumstances. I erect a temple where I house the idol; I project my image beyond the visible world; I convince myself that an ideal seductress lives in arcadian groves, far removed from mortal reach. My archaistic imagination personifies the spirit of venery as the goddess Venus, and I regard the graven image as her representation. Originally, I experience the spirit in the sensible presentations without postu- lating an absent person behind the scenes; the graven image is not originally the representation of a hidden personage, but a material expression, an artifact which captures the personal essence displayed in unconnected locations, an imaginative distillation which lets the scattered divinity dwell more fully amongst us. Be- holding the idol, I see the goddess manifest in every facet; the inspired artwork brings the divinity into focus, and serves as a perceptual guide, letting us discern the goddess more clearly in the populated landscape surrounding the temple. When I initially perceive the goddess, or god, in yonder depth, I sense a per- sonality, an embodied spirit, but I do not yet personify the divinity; I simply enjoy the divine depth; without naming the daemon, I let divinity fructify my expressive activity. Originally, the god is a stranger; a god so exotic, stimulating an astonishment so inarticulate, does not permit personification; a nameless deity seizes my body as his temple, acquires my name as his signature. Monotheistic Polymorphism Contemplating the mundane abyss, the artist experiences a theophany, be- comes a hierophant, and expresses the divine visage in his artwork. Experiencing, during a long duration, alternate disclosure and occultation, enduring the divine absence while anticipating a renewed theophany, the artist perceives a multi- faceted god, who exhibits, through fluctuating apparitions, a fluid personality. Because I experience divinity in shifting guises, I often wonder if I enduringly perceive a single god. In these various manifestations, do I perceive different gods, or do I experience the same god in molting skins? Suppose that, in my expressive work, I am fascinated with a murky light, a smoky black suffused with sepia, becoming luminous, suggesting amber. Suddenly, while my gaze swims in undulating dusk, I am seized by a new impulse; I catch my breath as a fresh illumination catches my eye. I see an alabaster light, not the overhead lightsource casting sooty shadows, but a source shining sideways and beneath, filling the shadows with reflected rays. I bathe now in a pellucid atmosphere where flesh dawns like pearl, where blackish brass glows with polish. Has my promiscuous glance become enamored with a foreign muse? Pursuing the shifting light, I</page><page sequence="13">THE FACE OF THE DEEP 367 wonder if each place, each time, has a divine proprietor, a separate ownership, a distinct theophany. Does each sacred locus have its proper spirit, its own in- spiration, which monopolizes my gaze, exercising my remembered enthusiasms? Does each sacred grove, each holy duration, have a jealous denizen who entices me into forgetfulness of lost horizons? Disconcerted, I wonder if I am seized by several gods, conflictory deities whose disharmony I must reconcile in my art. I doubt, sometimes, my own unity. Why, then, should I believe that the sequential inspirations which guide my work are multiple outbreaks of a single god? Rarely a harmonious personality, I tear my own flesh; my ensouled body attacks its living exterior; one impulse works against another, sapping my vitality in behavioral confusion; my soul is torn by contradictory passions, so that more souls than one seem to inhabit my synergetic body. Internal conflict produces not always an integrated person, but often an emotional desert, a dispirited wreckage, which lets me enjoy the bleak unity of depression. But, nearly al- ways, despite fragmentation, I feel an impulse toward unity. Animating my multiplicities and divisions is a single soul which works toward a unified vision, producing, in the process, a behavioral pattern, an expressive identity; my de- veloping personality exhibits the bodily inhabitation of a single subjectivity. If my expressive impulse is singleminded, if my perceptual labor has the rhythm of a focused impetus, I more easily believe that the yonder deity, also, is unitary. Undeniably, I receive successive inspirations which lead my work in divergent directions, but the separate pathways lead frequently toward a com- mon goal. The ramified routes tear me internally, but my integrative struggle eliminates the irreconcilable deviations. An accidental stroke, an unplanned gesture, suggests a new direction which threatens my programmatic advance, but I strive always toward the more inclusive style, an overall pattern which unites the divergent tendencies. Perhaps, though, I achieve expressive unity without divine assistance; the beckoning deities require my personal synthesis for their reconciliation. Performing my unswerving rituals, I hew a clear path through the sensual thicket; I vaguely sense a chaotic swarm haunting the wilderness; intractable spirits populate the backwoods, waiting to beguile my gaze with their distinctive charms. The unity in my art expresses my human singlemindedness, not a unified inspiration. I experience, I am now convinced, a divine multi- plicity without fundamental unity; or else, I deal with a divinity whose unity is infinitely multiplex. I feel a single spirituality in all the theophanies, but the unity is vacuous, because completely polymorphous. My exploration has moved from polytheism to polymorphism. Probing the deep, I suffocate in maternality; I drown in a sentimental swamp, a sensuous infinity without any form except multiplicity. From this emotive, sensual, plenitude, from this overflowing fountainhead, the finite soul wrests the unified artwork by violence and guile. I take a stand, establish a personal standpoint, and stand against the divine depth, activating an integrative style which draws the inspirational multiplicity inside my tightknit sphere. Despite my personal struggle, I may credibly feel that a single god has guided</page><page sequence="14">368 JOHN DERRICKSON MC CURDY my gaze throughout my lifetime; my struggle has been infused with divine energy. Perhaps I feel that a henotheistic deity saves me from the conflictory spirits who tear me asunder; or possibly I feel, monotheistically, that the dis- harmonious inspirations are changing moods of a single deity who struggles for his personal integrity while I work for mine. The spirit yonder, who guides my gaze, leads me sometimes with one face, sometimes with another, but the chang- ing masks are multiple aspects of a unified presentation which gradually reveals its enduring physiognomy. My spirit and my deity labor jointly at the interface between my body and yonder depth, producing a mutual identity. I adopt a monotheistic polymorphism: in fluid chaos swims a flexible spirit whose guises are infinite and eternally changing, but his flexibility suggests a structure which flexes, a rigidity amidst the fluidity. A single god inspires me, I shall suppose, not merely a god who dominates the competing deities, but a god without rivals; and a single god, I assume, in- spires also the other visionaries; still, aesthetic labor remains polytheistic. I and other men worship single gods, but, surely, not the same god, not a communal god; other artists pursue other interests; their enthusiasms are not mine. Our gods are finite deities, as large, but as limited, as our own lives, as diverse as our separate personalities. We each worship at a secluded altar, and there is no public worship, except the pious tolerance of private fanaticism. Ephemeral, these personal gods are born within our sight, and die when our inspiration is exhausted, die when we die. Perhaps, however, limited gods are engendered within a pervasive divinity; local theophanies are bounded outbreaks of a ubiquitous godhead. Even so, I am uncertain whether the communal divinity is a structured spirit or a vacuous unity without focal pattern. The interpersonal deity, like my intrasubjective god, may, again, be a polymorphous maternality, a formless multiplicity of forms, an animated chaos whose only pattern is multi- plicity, whose only style is the rank proliferation of style. The face of polymorphous divinity is a kaleidoscopic image which discourages my bounded appropriation. The fathomless deep requires that I lose my human limits; swirling depth annihilates personal structure, inspires staggering ecstasies, speechless outcry. Contemplating the divine visage, I exit from my private en- closure; standing in the public arena, the space of intersubjective interface, the human spirit is overloaded with sensory input, overcharged with enthusiasms, overwhelmed by the sensual welter; the facets blur and the face of the deep be- comes a blank. I unify the apparitions in a drunken aesthesis which reaches anaesthesia. Human bounds are broken; I enjoy the bliss of mental emptiness. The sensible surface is a dazzling illusion which can no longer take me astray; I pierce straight through the sensational veil to a featureless void, a face without expression, a sublime erasure. No artwork can express, positively, this annihilat- ing inspiration; I can practice only the artistry of denial, an aesthetics of anaes- thesia; I produce remarks and markings which evoke the void. My mind fluc- tuates between maya and nirvana, between a formless plenitude whose only form is the multiplicity of form and a formless void whose only form is the absence</page><page sequence="15">THE FACE OF THE DEEP 369 of multiplicity; I wearily wobble until, finally, I perceive the void in the pleni- tude. I reduce the inspired babble to a droning monotone, a white noise which gradually becomes inaudible. Amidst the audible, amidst the visible, I live at the degree zero of audibility; at degree zero the visible becomes a zero of visibility. If, however, I can withdraw from the hypnotic whirlpool, if I can draw back from the boundless sublime, toward our limited personal spheres, I do discern, dimly, a divine personality, an intersubjective deity whose inspiration unifies our private interiors. I notice that an inspired soul is not always eccentric; I see common trends, convergent styles, even where the separate artists are not mutually acquainted. Individual styles are, seemingly, idiosyncratic manifesta- tions of a single external spirit. Each historical epoch, each political territory, every culture, has a pervasive spirit, a nearly invisible atmosphere which holds us all entranced, or which animates, at least, those creators who live in their time, those who lead timely lives, expressing the genius of the age. The cultural aura emanates from a theophany in the mundane environs. Individual artists possess a common style fundamentally because they feel in the yonder deep a single deity who lures us forward, along a unitary pathway that interweaves the separate ap- proaches. The common trend within cultural boundaries, across national di- visions, across individual separations, suggests not a totally polymorphous or amorphous deity but a personal god, a spirit with distinctive expression, charac- teristic features, a structured face, a physical framework, a behavioral pattern. Our interpersonal appropriation humanizes the personality of a single god, pub- lically visible in our visionary artifacts which display a unitary pattern. Gazing into the divine visage, each artisan expresses in a manufactured face the perspec- tival essence of deity; confronting the individual artworks, an aesthetic haruspex should descry the quintessential deity. The theologian of culture should be a diviner who poetically perceives in these weltering artworks the living expression of god in our age. GODLESS ENTHUSIASM Bespeaking the gods, evoking aesthetic divinity, my discourse runs its course; my pious words fade in memory; the verbal vibration dies in my skull; I awake, and confront once again the mundane environs, without inspiration. My words amaze me; my profane ear burns with embarrassment. Was my theopathy a mistake, the most pitiful of pathetic fallacies? Were my musings merely a literary amusement? What inspired my phantasy? A god perhaps? An elec- trical disturbance in my cerebellum? A strange dream, but a very human dream. I shall, therefore, indulge my humanity: I shall sometimes believe that a god yonder guides me forward; and, if so inclined, I shall believe that my deity is not a demon who draws me into a hermetic closet, believing instead that my private guide is the personality who directs, also, the perceptual advance of other creators, luring every creative life toward a common paradise at the horizon of horizons.</page><page sequence="16">370 JOHN DERRICKSON MC CURDY Meanwhile, godless, I live in the light, centered in a lighted clearing; and arranged around me, ranging into distance, I see lighted surfaces on material solids; and, among the inanimate externals, I perceive human bodies; and I espy, radiating through windows, a yonder interiority, a spirituality not my own, spy- ing on me. No deity need show me the light, and the lighted eye, and the inner light. If no gods live yonder, or if god has no face, I profanely enjoy the mun- dane influences; the outer light, at least, inspires me; alien humans step into the light and inspire me with their glance. From these mundane externals, these alien materials and exotic spirits, I create my own personage, a figured surface where I see, if not the face of divinity, at least my own face. My expressive idolatry makes the world a sacred spectacle, a display of earthly holiness. Alas, without god, without a god in the flesh, all inspiration may perish; I may face a dead depth, a chaos lacking, even, the mundane glory. I no longer enjoy human inspiration; the glance is dead; the inner light no longer inflames my vision; only the light on the eyeball stirs my curiosity. Finally I no longer enjoy material inspiration; the lighted eye, the luminous solid, is dead; the outer light no longer excites my possessive desire. I confront the deep, unin- spired, lacking even the godless inspiration, possessing only my lonely soul. Without a guiding light, I begin, if I can, the interminate toil of interiority; darkly I move over the face of the deep; gasping in the void, I exhale the artwork, expressing my own depth with the use of dead externals. In the artwork I ex- hibit, if not the face of persons, or the face of things, at least my own face, a face which, inevitably, betrays my benighted condition. Oddly, though, I draw inspiration from this living death, where man lives without light, awaiting his extinction. When the human creator experiences the death of god, experiences the death of spirit, the death, even, of material inspiration, but draws inspiration from this absurd condition, do we, perhaps, worship the god of death? Or, do we enjoy the blackest mood of the living god?</page></plain_text>
