Walnut Creek, CA: Left Coast Press, 2008. $29.95 paper. ISBN 978-1-59874-151-3. Reviewed by James D. Keyser, U.S.D.A. Forest Service, 1815 SW DeWitt, Portland, OR 97239. With Thunder and Herds Larry Loendorf has authored his long-awaited volume on the rock art of the High Plains of southeastern Colorado, and I am pleased to note that it is an exceptionally well written book done in an engagingly personal, folksy style that entertains as well as educates. For 20 years, Loendorf has worked in and around the U.S. Army's Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site, which is centered on the canyon of the Purgatoire River south of Colorado Springs, Colorado. During that time, he has authored numerous monographs and articles concerning the rock art found there and this book is the volume that pulls all of his research together in one place. Consisting of eight chapters that discuss everything from the area's physiography and geology and Loendorfs and others' history of working there, through chronology and how "dirt archaeology" is an integral part of rock art recording, to chapter-long discussions of rock art from various periods, the book is a treasure chest of new discoveries coupled with many that have long been available in previous publications. What is especially gratifying, however, is that Loendorf ties both the old and the new so well together. Likewise, while the main body of the book is essentially chronologically structured, so that the reader moves from the Archaic period to the Historical period as he/ she reads through the book, each chapter has specific discussions of several sites that contain key images on which Loendorf bases his interpretations. Often, this allows the reader to understand how Loendorf has arrived as his conclusions and enables a reader to see the evolution of his thoughts over the two decades of research. The result is an engaging view of how a rock art archaeologist practices his specialty. Loendorf also makes a special point of showing that rock art research cannot be divorced from "dirt archaeology." He notes, "The basic premise under pinning my research and reflected in this book is that rock art sites are first and foremost archaeological sites" [p. 16]. This is a long-standing focus of Larry's research, but the examples that he notes in nearly every chapter serve once again to bring this home to anyone who reads the book. Thus, materials recov ered from subsurface archaeological deposits that are associated with the pictographs and petroglyphs are used to help date sites, to help interpret site functions, and to suggest ethnic affiliations for sites. Probably Book Reviews the most intriguing such finding is the cattail pollen in sediments associated with Gan-like figures at one site that supports both his identification of the figures as Apache motifs and indicates that the site functioned as a vision quest locale [p. 183]. The book is also served very well by Loendorfs folksy style of writing. Any book like this needs to meet demands from widely disparate audiences. First, it must be professionally accurate so that it can be used by other archaeologists, including both rock art specialists and others. It meets this requirement with flying colors. But even more importantly, the book must also appeal to the general reader. This is not as easy as it might seem, especially in an area where there are several sites that have been the subject of fantasy interpretations by those who fancy them selves epigraphers and find the "New World Ogam" writings of ancient, Precolumbian Celtic populations (McGlone, Leonard, and Barker 1994; Barker and Leonard 1999). It is with these fatuous claims (which often capture the interest of the public precisely because they are so fantastic) that the archaeologist must compete to try and educate the public as to the "who, what, why, and when" of rock art. And remember, it is members of the public (rather than a few dozen archaeologists) who visit these sites, write comments to state and federal agencies concerning their protection, and have the capacity to "love them to death," who must be convinced of their value and the need to preserve them. In this sense, Loendorf writes an entertaining book that almost anyone could find interesting, and in a very low-key way he notes that no "fantastic" explanation is required to under stand the images at Crack Cave and other sites that have been erroneously identified as "Ogam" writing by those who would rather make up "explanations" than do the anthropology required to understand much rock art. At the same time, however, Loendorf speaks directly to the people of Colorado and a broader national population when he lauds the local ranchers for preserving sites, and credits members of the Colorado Archaeological Society and archaeolo gists from the U.S. Forest Service and Department of the Army for conducting many of the baseline recording projects in the area. Of course, no book is perfect. There are a few key typographical errors that create limited confusion (such as the dates for the Sopris Phase [pp. 30, 31]) and an occasional grammatical error that should have been caught and corrected in the editing. But none of these detracts greatly from the work as a whole. My only two substantive criticisms are that there are not enough illustrations and some of the descriptions either do not match, or are difficult to compare to, the illustrations that are shown. While a complaint about lack of illustrations may seem strange, given the more than 100 figures in the Journal of Field Archaeology 2010 vol.35 no. 1 125</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews book, in every chapter I found instances where images key to the discussion were not illustrated. Rock art is the most visual of archaeological subjects—after all it is by definition art! Any rock art book should have more rather than fewer illustrations and even half again more images would not have greatly increased the cost of producing this volume. The fact that some descriptions appear not to clearly match the illustrations is more serious. To identify the "central" anthropomorph in the photo graph of the Zookeeper site [pp. 88, 89] I needed to go to the original site monograph to match the description to the photograph. The figure is neither central in the published photograph, nor is it easily distinguished as an anthropomorph. An arrow in dicating this figure on the photograph, or better yet, an inset drawing, would have made it much easier to find and understand. Some interpretation of the tall, vertical element that crosses one arm of the anthro pomorph would have assisted me in separating it from the figure. Likewise, in the description of the animal figure petroglyphs at the boulder sites their tails are described as "straight appendages sticking out horizontally from the back end of their bodies" [p. 54]. However, the only illustration of these [Figure 2.5] shows at least eight animals, all of which hold their tails erect, positioned vertically rather than horizontally. The reader cannot determine if this is merely a typographical error (horizontal rather than vertical), or if there is some greater problem with either the description of the type of figures or a wrong illustration. Nevertheless, these flaws could be rela tively easily fixed if the book is revised for a second edition, and they do not markedly detract from an otherwise fine piece of work. In summary, Loendorf s very well written Thunder and Herds is a welcome addition to the rapidly growing rock art literature of the Great Plains. Anyone with an interest in the rock art, archaeology, Indian cultures, or prehistory of the Plains should have it in their library. References McGlone, Β., T. Barker, and P. Leonard. 1994.
