<plain_text><page sequence="1">A CULTURE OF TREES: THE POLITICS OF PRUNING AND FELLING IN LATE EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY FRANCE Giulia Pacini Ever since ancient times, in pagan cults as in classical mythology, trees have been viewed and represented as symbols of power both human and divine.1 As gigantic elements that link the earth to the sky and the past to the future, they appear to embody ideals of transcendence in ways that few other objects can rival. When they gather in forests-often sacred, sometimes haunted-they are most frequently described in terms full of awe. Across cultural traditions, moreover, trees have been taken as preeminent symbols of a stability that is strengthened, rather than weakened, by its internal processes of growth and renewal. As such, they have been seen as incarnations of the generative force of the cosmos.2 Still, this ubiquity of the tree as a symbol of power does not mean that different cultures have not granted more specific, and therefore occasionally dissimilar, meanings to the forces which they wanted to describe.3 The following pages offer an interest- ing example to this effect, as they argue that in late eighteenth-century France aristocrats and revolutionaries alike adopted the tree as a political symbol: within a span of a few decades, trees were employed both to figure the monarchy and its traditionally aristocratic forms of culture and to represent the vigor and justice that would ensue from revolutionary change. The tree could be viewed as root or as growth, and as such it could be taken to signify both the stability of the ancien r6gime and the hopes of the new republic. For all involved, it was undoubtedly an ideologically useful symbol: as a natural organism, the tree could cast a light of innocence, legitimacy, necessity, and good health on whatever political program it was supposed to represent.

Many histories of the period mention the "wild may- poles" erected in 1790, when rebel inhabitants of Perigord, Quercy, and Angoumois declared the end of seigniorial authority by stealing and then publicly replanting saplings to which, according to common law, they had no right. With this gesture, the rebels refused to respect the economic and political relations that traditionally had regulated the use of local woodlands: speaking through trees, they declared the restoration of men's natural equality. Andre Corvol and Mona Ozouf have similarly written about the symbolic erection of "freedom trees" during revolution- ary festivals, as well as about the initiatives of the abbe Gregoire and FranCois de Neufchateau, who insisted that the physical, economic, social, and moral health of the nation depended on the systematic planting of trees throughout the land.5 The significance of the tree as a political symbol in the prerevolutionary period is instead a less familiar story. In this essay I am going to suggest that, in the 1770s and 1780s, writers and painters close to court saw trees as an aristocratic symbol, which they might usefully deploy when they wanted to address delicate issues such as royal policy or the need for economic or social reform. In particular, Hubert Robert, Peyraud de Beaussol, Jacques Delille, Michel-Paul de Chabanon, and Adelaide de Souza used scenes of felling and pruning to comment upon, or to raise questions about, the solidity of a cultural and political system-the ancien regime-which seemed to be wavering beneath their feet. Although the work of these individuals was probably supported by an understanding of the mythical status of trees, it was also inspired by the monarchy's long-established involvement in the management of national forests, by the construction of the gardens of Versailles under Louis XIV, and the spectacular event of their replanting in 1774-75. One can trace the history of the French state's interest and involvement in arboreal affairs back at least to the Middle Ages, when communal trees were periodically pollarded (that is, trimmed to the trunk) so that farmers and feudal lords could collect their branches for firewood and timber. This process was well regulated according to the social hierarchies of the time: small branches were dis- tributed among local peasant laborers while the proprietor or feudal lord of the land laid claim to the largest (and therefore most valuable) pieces of wood. From the thirteenth century on, royal ordinances repeatedly attempted to monitor the administration of the country's woodlands. This arboreal politics was extended under FranCois I and Henri II, when the monarchy decided to implement the regular planting of trees along the kingdom's major roads.6 This project had a political agenda insofar as these plantings were supposed to affirm the presence of the cen- tral state across the nation. Trees also marked the juridical and economic limits of public and private property; last but not least, this systematic form of planting guaranteed an abundance of timber for the French army's wagons and artillery mounts.7 Throughout the Renaissance and early modern period, trees continued to be planted, grown, and felled according to periodic patterns of renewal. Royal ordinances worked to establish forestal reserves that would produce enough wood for the navy. In addition, in the seventeenth century the state proceeded to set up</page><page sequence="3">PACINI / A Culture of Trees 3 provincial nurseries to experiment with imported plants, grafts, and innovative gardening techniques. In response to a growing preoccupation over the insufficiency of French woods for military and manufacturing purposes (a problem attributed to a great extent to the wasteful habits of the clergy), between 1661 and 1669 Louis XIV's minister, Colbert, intensified these arboreal projects by establishing the untouchable forest properties of the Crown.8 These woods were organized into two legal territories: one for regular harvesting (the so-called taillis compose), the other for the protected growth of more precious standing timber (the grande futaie). Throughout the land, therefore, trees were planted, nurtured, and felled for the good of the country.9 Any form of opposition to, or discussion about, these forest laws tended to bring up a constellation of economic, juridical, political, and administrative issues. For example, the scope and legitimacy of royal authority were contested and renegotiated when peasants rose up to defend their traditional rights to the use of common forests for pasturing animals and collecting wood.10 Similar questions were raised by thousands of legal cases throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries (in the French provinces in particular), as landowners and the clergy resisted Colbert's forest legislation. In the eighteenth century, several factors contributed to moving the tree closer to the center of scholarly and popular attention: concerns over a perceived dearth of woodlands in Europe and in the colonies; the arrival of foreign plants discovered by European explorers overseas; a fashion for gardens and gardening; new landscape styles that featured the color, texture, and shape of individual plants; and, more generally, the development of the empirical sciences. This interest in arboreal matters was equally promoted by an emerging culture of stewardship: in France, as in England, proper territorial governance was recast as a mission that would ensure the nation's economic, military, political, and moral strength.11 Competing claims to polite taste, moral justice, and political authority were staked out in gardens and in the discourse about landscape. Landowners and kings in particular were expected to participate actively in the management of nature. The very legitimacy of the French monarchy could be linked to the strategic exploita- tion, expansion, and general "improvement" of the country's natural resources.12 Because of their greater size, multiple functions, economic worth, and mythical stature, trees, more than any other plant, figured at the center of this territorial politics. Throughout the eighteenth century, the science of forestry maintained its critical importance: trees continued to be used to mark military and civil boundar- ies as well as to provide lumber for building. Exotic plants were cultivated in the name of science, just as they also served to beautify the nation and to represent the monarchy's colonial power. Yet while Colbert's forest laws had simply protected timber as a royal possession, under and after Louis XV the planting and conserva- tion of wood was described as the king's duty to nature: the monarch was viewed as a developer whose "sacred responsibility" was to expand-rather than only to protect or use-the national forests.13 This shift was significant because it revealed an ever-deeper connection between royal functions and arboreal matters: no longer viewed simply in terms of their utility to the state, healthy trees spoke increasingly to the monarchy's legitimacy and moral virtue. Of course, trees were also adopted and planted for philosophical and sen- timental reasons: landscape architects around Paris made a point of planting trees</page><page sequence="4">EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES 41 /1 of Liberty, Fraternity, Melancholy, Friendship, or Love when they designed a new site.14 As Bernardin de Saint-Pierre explained, "Les arbres de la patrie ont encore de plus grands attraits quand ils se lient, comme chez les anciens, avec quelque ide religieuse ou avec le souvenir de quelque grand homme" [the trees of the mother country are even more attractive when they are associated, as in ancient times, with some religious idea or with the memory of a great man.]s As a result of these various forms of investment, in the late eighteenth century trees could be viewed as highly meaningful cultural objects. Given the extent that they were planted for commemorative purposes, or grown and distributed by a national program dedicated to the protection and reinforcement of the monarchy, it is appropriate to speak of a full-fledged early modern culture of trees. Consequently, it should not be too surprising that, when trees appeared in paintings or in verbal forms of art, they functioned as heavily charged ideologi- cal signs. As Henri Lafon has pointed out in his study of the eighteenth-century French novel, garden scenes were often used to polarize a situation and to present the reader with some kind of lesson.16 Jean-Jacques Rousseau's description of the Elysee in Julie (Julie ou La Nouvelle Heloise [1761]) is the prototypical example of such a symbolic garden design. Far from being a neutral backdrop, the Elysee is constructed as a highly significant scene that speaks to Julie's efforts to reestablish her lost virtue. Although it might give the impression of being a virgin landscape, it is carefully defined as the product of human labor. Rousseau could not have better stressed the importance of viewing "natural" spaces and "innocent" objects-in life as in fictional representations-as meaningful cultural scenes, heavily influenced by human desires, systems of belief, and concrete sociopolitical and economic practices. Similarly, the images and texts analyzed in the following pages indicate that arboreal symbols and the garden topos were appreciated for their represen- tational-or, better, their argumentative-potential. In the last two decades of the eighteenth century, artists at or near court adopted trees as loaded symbols to describe their understanding of the workings, organization, and general strength or weakness of the French monarchy. In particular, the plants at Versailles served as metonymical representations of the Grand Siecle of Louis XIV, while severed branches or chopped-up trunks called attention to the kingdom's most vulner- able points. Images of felled or pruned trees were of especial use to authors who wanted to address various questions of reform. In this regard, artists may have been inspired by Cesare Ripa's influential Iconology (Iconologia [1593]), a text well known in France thanks to a number of seventeenth-century French-language translations and the highly successful illustrated Hertel edition of 1758-60. French men and women of letters of this period probably knew that Ripa had adopted a pruned garden as the emblem of political and judicial reform. Ripa's Iconology, in fact, indicated that, just as one must regularly trim the excess growth that saps a tree's vitality, so one needs to eliminate the abuses that otherwise undermine the justice of a state's august laws.17 This comparison between a pruned garden and a reformed government must have seemed especially well drawn-and therefore potentially useful-to anyone aware of the critical roles that trees had played as an economic and juridico-political resource over the course of French history. By depicting scenes of pruning or of a prevented felling, artists could suggestively call for an intervention on, or demand the conservation of, their country's geopolitical and cultural landscape. 4</page><page sequence="5">PACINI / A Culture of Trees 5 Some of most clamorous images from this period are representations of the felling and replanting of Louis XIV's trees at Versailles. This was a memorable event: in 1774-75 the minister of Louis XVI's Building Administration, Charles Claude Flahaut comte Billarderie D'Angiviller, ordered the reforestation of about 233 acres of land, a radical course of action prompted by a number of economic, horticultural, aesthetic, and symbolic reasons, as well as by a general concern with safety in the gardens. The Sun King's trees had been withering away and were dying because, contrary to normal French reforestation practices, they had never been replaced. They were so old that their branches endangered statues and visi- tors to the gardens, especially in the Labyrinth on the south side. Given the culture of stewardship that existed in late eighteenth-century France, this degradation was more than an embarrassment to the Crown: it suggested ever so dangerously that the latter might not be capable of managing the country's natural resources. Moreover, the royal Building Administration was suffering from a serious financial crisis and d'Angiviller realized that he could sell the resulting timber for the sum of about one hundred and fifty million livres.18 With the king's approval, the wood was therefore sold to the navy on November 20, 1774. Having cut down Louis XIV's old trees, the Building Administration had to decide whether to maintain Andre Le Notre's original design, or to replace the latter with something more modern. This was a weighty matter since the reforesta- tion constituted an intervention in a highly significant and ideologically charged geopolitical landscape.19 Any intervention in Louis XIV's gardens was going to be loaded with symbolic meaning, not only because the Sun King had been heavily involved in the landscaping of Versailles, but also because at this very time con- temporary French and British landscape architects were describing the geometric forms of Versailles as the outdated expression of a "feudal" or an absolutist political regime. More or less explicitly, in their essays on modern gardens, Claude-Henri Watelet, Jean-Marie Morel, Horace Walpole, and Rene-Louis Girardin juxtaposed Le N6tre's seemingly archaic and ostentatious structures with the "modern," "hos- pitable," and allegedly more "natural," "free," or "liberal" character of England's landscape and form of government.20 Moreover, the ways in which these gardens were characterized was anything but an esoteric piece of knowledge. During the second half of the eighteenth century, landscape architects, painters, and men and women of letters all engaged this quarrel about the relative faults and merits of these landscape styles.21 The literature of this period abounds with disparaging mentions of tyrannical lords' classical "French" gardens and descriptions of a sensitive individual's more "natural," "English" grounds.22 According to Antoine Nicolas Duchesne, whose treatise, On the formation of gardens (Sur la formation des jardins), was published in 1775, "La formation des jardins est devenue un objet egalement interessant aux artistes et aux litterateurs. II existe entre les partisans des anciens jardins du genre regulier, et ceux des nouveaux jardins du genre libre, un diff6rent, dont se rendent juges tous ceux qui pr6tendent au bon gofit" [The formation of gardens has become an object equally interesting to artists and to people of letters. Between the partisans of the old gardens of the regular kind, and those of the new gardens of the free kind, there is a dispute of which all those who claim to have good taste make themselves judges.]23 The replanting of the Sun King's gardens was therefore an issue fraught with political undertones. From a stylistic</page><page sequence="6">6 EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES 41 / 1 point of view, moreover, a radical change in the Versailles landscape seemed all the more conceivable since the "English" garden was fashionable within Marie Antoinette's intimate circle. In the end, the most influential landscape theorists of this period concluded that a symmetrical form was the most appropriate design for a royal palace. Whether they were wary of criticizing Versailles' traditional aspect or they actually believed in the exceptional character of these gardens, architects such as Morel put aside their personal preferences and insisted on the political function of these royal gar- dens that had been built for a public and particularly ostentatious demonstration of the monarch's power.24 Possibly influenced by this line of reasoning, but also-if not above all-persuaded by more immediate economic calculations, d'Angiviller and the royal Building Administration ultimately opted for a conservative plan: they decided to maintain the geometric style typical of seventeenth-century French aristocratic landscapes. Oak, Canadian poplar, maple, beech, hornbeam, chestnut, and lime saplings were replanted along the lines first occupied by Louis XIV's trees. Design innovations were essentially limited to the introduction of small allees that simplified the transportation of wood across the park.25 For the most part, d'Angiviller adopted a financially convenient solution that happily read as a tribute to Louis XIV's cultural and political legacy. The discussions that surrounded this reforestation project caused a small stir among artists at or near Versailles. In part, this was due to the king's desire to commemorate the event: Louis XVI commissioned Hubert Robert to paint two views of the gardens at the time of the felling of the trees. Countering the monarch's explicit request, however, Robert refused to paint "very precise, but cold" pictures of the site, preferring instead to follow his own imagination.26 Paula Radisich has cogently argued that The Green Carpet at the Time of the Demolition of the Trees, Winter 1774-5 represents an imaginary scene that compresses a number of real prospects in order to organize its crucial elements around a classic symbol of the fluctuation of time: the seesaw (Figure 1). The painting appears to raise questions about the relationship between ancient and modern times and between old and new social forces or political agents: it juxtaposes Louis XIV's trees and Coysevox's cast of an antique statue (on the left) with young children, green vegetation, and Puget's more modern Milo of Crotona (on the right). The positioning of the royal couple and other aristocrats on the side of modernity can be said to represent Robert's hope for the renewal of the monarchy after a period of political and financial crisis. These paintings celebrate the promising reforms expected of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette.27 The king is presented as the new Triptolemus, the financially savvy steward or ruler of a horticultural economy.28 With both these paintings, Robert participated in the campaigns against luxury and sumptuous expenditure of d'Angiviller and his friend, the physiocratic Controller-General of Finance, Anne-Marie Turgot. To this effect, it is interesting to note that in View of the Copse of the Baths of Apollo the trees on the right show an unnaturally regular, cylindrical shape that is highly suggestive of pollard-like pruning (Figure 2).29 This detail was most probably a poetic license because, in reality, exploitative trimming of this sort would have been considered too vulgar or rustic for a king's refined palace. Furthermore, as Yves Luginbiihl has pointed out, in the late eighteenth century pollarding was criticized as an ignorant feudal</page><page sequence="7">PACINI / A Culture of Trees 7 Figure 1.

View of the Copse of the Baths of Apollo thus sets up an eloquent comparison between these different ways of treating trees, ultimately suggesting that-despite their obvious differ- ences-hyperfunctional and strictly decorative forms of planting have much in common. The painting offers an imaginary scene of four men pulling on a rope that is about to down one of Louis XIV's precious trees on the left. This rope cre- ates a line of tension that links these withered plants to the pollard-like conifers on the right. The painting thus indicates not only that the former will fall at the feet of the latter but also that all these trees will end up tumbling under the same ax and in the same direction. With this provocative juxtaposition, which eventually transforms itself into a structural parallel, Robert seems to have suggested that extreme, yet radically different, ways of treating trees-one excessively conservative (embodied in the withered relics), the others too abusive (see the pollards, as well as the ornamental trellises beneath them)-ultimately produced the same result, namely lumber of poor quality. Indeed, the foreground of the painting shows wood that must be chopped up, despite the fact that the royal navy needed (much more valuable) whole trunks for the building of ships. With this forceful comparison, Robert was able to comment upon the wasteful, but luckily outdated, ways in which the French had treated their precious wood. One might argue that these paintings also suggested that, by better managing and developing its economic resources in general, the French state could have curtailed the pain of its current crisis. In any event, both of Robert's paintings expressed the hope that the French monarchy would understand its need to protect, renew, increase, and capitalize on-rather than irrationally use or wastefully enshrine-the country's natural resources. Explicit mentions of the Versailles reforestation project can also be found in the poetry of the early 1780s. Peyraud de Beaussol's The Antoineide, or the Birth of the Dauphin and of Madame (L'Antoneide, ou la naissance du Dauphin et de Madame [1781]), and the abbe Jacques Delille's The Gardens, or the Art of Embellishing Landscapes (Les Jardins, ou l'art d'embellir les paysages [1782]) mobilized similar images of Versailles to describe the weakened state of the French monarchy. The Antoineide compared the suffering of Marie Antoinette, who was being viciously attacked by pamphleteers and then risked dying in childbirth, to the devastated state of Versailles.31 The poem dramatized the combat between life and death that was taking place in "[c]es parcs devastes, oui les arts autrefois/ firent de l'Elysee une image fidele." [In those ruined parks, where the arts once/ Produced a faithful image of the Elysian Fields.]32 To ensure a clear reading of this poem, an authorial footnote specified that the text was written right after the felling of the trees at Versailles. More importantly, Peyraud de Beaussol underlined the steward- ship duties of the monarchy: "Quel [sic] est done ici-bas l'importance des Rois?/ La nature 6plore est partout aux abois." [What is here on earth the importance of kings?/ Everywhere, weeping Nature is in desperate shape.]33 The Antoineide not only offers a classic representation of the birth of the Dauphin as new growth on the Bourbon dynastic tree; it associates this event with France's reborn hope for improved forms of land and forest management.</page><page sequence="9">PACINI / A Culture of Trees 9 Delille's The Gardens presents itself as a treatise on the ideal characteristics of a picturesque garden, but it too engages a number of sociopolitical issues. With this immensely successful poem, Delille celebrated international sociability, mili- tary alliances, and cultural exchanges as he envisioned foreigners happily walking through his imaginary French landscapes full of exotic plants.34 He paid tribute to the French-American military victory at Yorktown and to the ensuing 1778 Treaty of Friendship and Commerce, while also mentioning other items of news such as the birth of the Dauphin and, most notably, the felling of the Sun King's trees. The inclu- sion of the latter in this list of politically significant events is revealing of Delille's perspective on the Versailles replanting project. He clearly envisioned these gardens as the last living witnesses of Louis XIV's military and cultural achievements. The memories once contained in these branches were invaluable public testaments to the glory of the monarch and his reign. They spoke of his military campaigns (led by General Turenne) and bore witness to his cultural politics: O Versailles! 6 regrets! 6 bosquets ravissants, Chef-d'oeuvre d'un grand Roi, de Le Nostre et des ans! La hache est a vos pieds, et votre heure est venue! ... Ils ont d6truit ces bois dont le front glorieux Ombrageait de LOUIS le front victorieux ... Croissez, hatez votre ombre, et repeuplez ces champs, Vous, jeunes arbrisseaux. Et vous, arbres mourants, Consolez-vous; temoins de la faiblesse humaine, Vous avez vu perir et Corneille et Turenne... ! Oh Versailles! Oh regrets! Oh ravishing bosquets, Masterpiece of a great King, of Le Notre, and the years! The ax is at your feet, and your hour is come! ... They have destroyed these woods whose glorious front Gave shade to the victorious brow of LOUIS ... Grow, hasten your shade, and repopulate these fields, You, young saplings. And you, dying trees, Console yourselves; witnesses of human weakness, You have seen die both Corneille and Turenne... !3s The elegiac tone of these verses sensitizes the reader to the fragility of these national memories: The Gardens reads as a note of warning lest the French forget their precious history and unique cultural heritage (exemplified here in the support that Louis XIV gave Le Notre and the playwright Pierre Corneille).36 In similar fashion, this part of the poem underscores the importance of respecting French society's traditionally hierarchical structure. Despite the fact that The Gardens repeatedly celebrates the emergence of egalitarian forms of sociability, and regardless of the poet's stated appreciation of recent developments in aesthetic taste (most notably, here, his contemporaries' preference for clumps over solitary trees), Delille insists that the application of these modern ideals must not override or destroy time-honored arrangements. Undoubtedly, both trees and people would do well to form a happy "people of brothers," but the poem argues that they should nevertheless continue to pay tribute to venerable old oaks and equally majestic kings.37 In these recommendations to the modern gardener, as in its political program, The Gardens describes a process of gradual reform that promises to make room for modern values without overhauling the country's ex-</page><page sequence="10">EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES 41 / 1 isting landscape. Indeed, it is only in this light that one can make sense of Delille's defense of Le Notre's seemingly old-fashioned work at Versailles within a poem that otherwise promotes the characteristics of a picturesque garden (27). Similarly, it is in this light that one can reconcile Delille's celebration of monarchic power with his tributes to a more egalitarian form of brotherly sociability. Even in the absence of an explicit reference to the reforestation of the king's gardens at Versailles, images of pruned and felled trees functioned in symbolic fashion. Newly pruned and re-landscaped gardens were eloquently used as signs of (wanted or unwanted) social, political, and cultural change in late eighteenth-cen- tury poetry and novels. They were also made to comment upon the ideal qualities and temporality of any process of reform. In his Epistle on the Mania of English Gardens (Epitre sur la manie des jardins anglais [1775]), Michel-Paul de Chabanon told the tale of a foolish landowner who impulsively took the ax to his unfashion- ably aligned trees in an attempt to follow new and allegedly "English" gardening trends. This landlord destroyed "De trente ans revolus fruit lent et precieux" [thirty full years of slow and precious growth] and then sent for an architect, expecting that the latter would be pleased to find a perfectly cleared ground.38 The expert, however, was so horrified at what he saw that he refused to start work until the trees had grown back. With this cautionary tale, Chabanon dismissed the "English garden mania" as an ignorant, irrational, and inevitably short-lived trend. More importantly, he used this story to attack the ways in which the "English" garden had become a model for aesthetic judgments in general: France's classical heritage, he claimed, was falling victim to the dictates of this new, imported taste.39 Thus, the poem raises questions about the interplay of tradition and innovation, and its trees clearly symbolize the scientific and artistic heights reached by geniuses such as Le N6tre, Moliere, and Corneille during the reign of Louis XIV.40 As Chabanon alludes to the lost value of the landlord's full-grown trees, he effectively warns the reader that the seventeenth-century canon-the achievements, memories, and lessons of the Grand Siecle-risk being lost as a resource to future generations. Anticipating some of the fears expressed in Delille's poem, the Epistle deploys arboreal images to symbolize the gold standard that defines and guarantees the value of the French national heritage. Moreover, by adopting a quintessential figure of attachment to one's native soil, the poem bespeaks the concern that foreign elements will uproot local or national traditions. Similarly conservative arguments about the importance of respecting (aris- tocratic) French traditions surfaced in Adele de Senange (written in 1788; published in 1794), an epistolary novel by Adelaide de Flahaut de la Billarderie, later known as the baroness de Souza. Within this text, the author not only denounced the bru- tality of a radical reforestation project, but also talked in coded fashion about ideal methods of reform. It seems possible that parts of this story were directly inspired by the felling of the trees at Versailles; Souza was closely related to both Marigny and d'Angiviller, the previous and current ministers of the Crown's Building Ad- ministration.41 She frequently did the honors in Mme. d'Angiviller's receptions at Versailles, and she hosted a lively salon of her own at the Louvre.42 Descriptions of the debates which took place under her aegis demonstrate that Souza was very interested in political affairs: contemporary accounts indicate, for example, that she helped both Charles Talleyrand and Gouverneur Morris draft their projects for 10</page><page sequence="11">PACINI / A Culture of Trees financial and constitutional reform in France and the United States. Her husband's position as the Intendant of the King's Gardens, moreover, increases the chances that she may have been privy to court discussions about the recent re-landscaping of Versailles. Her novel, in any event, speaks of her interest in the matter since a curiously polemical reforestation scene figures at its very center. Adele de Senange is made up of the letters of Lord Sydenham, a young Englishman who falls in love with a sixteen-year-old Frenchwoman. Adele, however, is married, and Sydenham becomes the friend of her seventy-year-old husband, the Marquis de Senange. Many details in the text explicitly set up this story as a retelling of Rousseau's Julie: notably, the establishment of a love tri- angle; M. de Senange's age and Wolmar-like paternal wisdom; an idyllic pastoral setting; and, above all, Adele's desire to design an English-style "natural" garden reminiscent of Julie's Elysee. Yet, in Adele de Senange, people and space are more heavily politicized than they were in Rousseau's novel. When reincarnated as M. de Senange, the Wolmar-like character becomes a relatively conservative French aristocrat. Instead of encouraging his wife's projects, as was the case in Julie, M. de Senange represents a dissonant conservative voice not too pleased with Adele's newfangled, foreign ideas. This tension comes to the surface when the couple de- bates the purposes and methods of the proposed landscape project. Upon his arrival in Paris, in fact, Sydenham had complained that the Marquis de Senange's house was overwhelmed by a hideous garden in the "l'ancien genre frangais dans toute son aridite" [ancient French style in all its aridity]; beneath the sad topiary stood a gilded aviary "du plus mauvais gofit" [of the worst taste possible], in which a flock of birds was miserably trapped. Sydenham preferred his own "parc si sauvage" [ever so wild park] in Wales, where plants and animals could grow and roam in perfect freedom. Having heard about this innovative English garden style, Adele asks her husband to "tout changer" [change everything] as soon as possible. She invites Sydenham to return the very next day, "avec un plan qui pit etre execute tris promptement" [with a plan that could be executed very quickly.]43 Sydenham's following letter describes an important change of mind: just as the young architects agree to remove the horrendous aviary and fell some of the old trees, M. de Senange starts lamenting the imminent destruction of his garden. He complains about their lack of respect for the venerable age and function of his plants: "Ces arbres, mes anciens amis, vous les couperiez! ils me sont necessaires ..." [These trees, my old friends, you would cut them down! I need them ... .]44 As the trees metamorphose into the Marquis' anthropomorphic friends, the garden becomes a sociopolitical system in which specific laws-reified in the form of pruning shears and gilded cages-constrict its inhabitants' movements. In Sydenham's letters, moreover, this landscape architectural project is tinged in opposing national and political colors. M. de Senange's garden and his aviary are not only clearly "French," but they are also the products of a markedly aristocratic culture. Compared to this antiquated and repressive world, Sydenham's "English" garden represents more modern and certainly more liberal policies. Thus, the novel plays into the conventional eighteenth-century opposition between the geometric "French" and the ostensibly natural "English" gardens. Nevertheless, Adele de Senange deconstructs this strict polarity as it sentimentalizes the former, and nuances and debunks Sydenham's idealized picture of the British 11</page><page sequence="12">EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES 41 / 1 landscape. With a rhetoric that resembles that of Chabanon's earlier poem, the novel underscores the violence with which the young architects would have superim- posed an English style onto a French garden. Souza stresses the fact that, although alterations may be desirable, they need not be so drastic, nor be implemented so quickly. Significantly, at the end of the novel, the young architects decide to leave the Parisian garden intact and design their ideal landscape on Senange's country property in Neuilly instead.45 Adele's final stance in this confrontation between the two men and their different cultures is crucial, as she represents an impatient younger generation's choice when presented with two alternatives: one uphold- ing an undesirable and antiquated tradition, the other proposing a preferable, yet nevertheless brutal, reform project. Souza's political views-notably, her interest in the ideal forms of a constitutional monarchy-transpire indirectly in this argument that recognizes the importance of change while rejecting the brutality and irratio- nality of a radical revolution. The final displacement of Adele's modern garden from central Paris to peripheral Neuilly implies that reform projects should respect and align themselves within, rather than completely replace, existing systems. As it is, the Marquis de Senange's age indicates that his class's natural death will occur soon enough. Then will come the time to introduce a more liberal (constitutional?) system, possibly modeled along British lines (within the novel, in fact, Adele will eventually marry Sydenham). Thus, representations of trees in the late eighteenth century were often used for argumentative purposes. In particular, a culture of stewardship shed a moral and political light on scenes of pruning and felling, which therefore read as suggestive calls for intervention in, or conservation of, the French geopolitical and cultural landscape. Above all, the introduction of elements of violence within the traditionally harmonious landscape genre allowed Robert, Peyraud de Beaussol, Delille, Chabanon, and Souza to face and examine, rather than to gloss over and naturalize, their country's various fault lines. These artists refused to reproduce the normal discourse of topographia, which tended to integrate disparate elements in an idealized picture of beauty and controlled order.46 Far from presenting illusorily idyllic scenes of peace and perfect health, their landscapes called attention to the nature of France's troubles. This is not to say that these scenes represented a full- fledged oppositional discourse; rather, they constructed moderate or conservative arguments about the ideal methods and timing of reform. The figure of someone caring for a tree allowed artists to negotiate the tension between their respect for national traditions and a recognized need for strategic change: their works called for some kind of pruning, but not for the uprooting of the monarchy.

One should note that the ideal shape of trees changed in the eighteenth century, when philoso- phers and botanists agreed that pruning or trimming was a "feudal" practice that prevented a plant from growing freely.

The planting of elms in particular may have been linked to a medieval French tradition of met- ing out justice in their shade (feudal lords or magistrates were supposed to be inspired by the divinity in these trees). See Brosse, Les Arbres, 147. Dumas points out that this arboreal politics required the development of roads and canals to transport the wood from one part of the country to another; as a result, it ultimately contributed to reinforcing the centralization of the French monarchy (Traite de l'arbre, 172). 7.

Taylor-Leduc, "Louis XVI's Public Gardens," 67-68. 20. Horace Walpole's essay "On Modern Gardening" (written towards the end of the 1760s, translated into French in 1785) is by far the most forceful. For French echoes of these sentiments, cf. Claude-Henri Watelet, Essai sur les jardins (1774; reprint, Saint-Pierre de Salerne: Gerard Monfort, 2004), 20-23; Jean-Marie Morel, Theorie des jardins (1776; reprint, Geneve: Minkoff, 1973), 1-40; 385-86; Rene-Louis Girardin, De la composition des paysages (1777; reprint, ed. Michel Conan, Paris: Editions du Champ Urbain, 1979), 103-17. 21. As the Parisian elite debated the value of planting, pruning, or pollarding trees, the Mercure de France (a monthly journal "dedicated to the king by a society of people of letters") included regular mentions of recently published works on gardening. See for example the September 1774 edition. 22. The following pages will mention French texts, but this is true of late eighteenth-century English novels as well (see, for example, Ann Radcliffe's The Mysteries of Udolpho). 23.

See for example the poems published in honor of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette in the Mercure de France in the second half of 1774. 29. Although they could be seen as cypresses (traditional symbols of mourning), these trees call to mind traditional French pollards. Indeed, in other paintings by Hubert Robert, naturally grown, tall, thin, leafy trees always show branches of some sort. This is not the case here. The additional presence of trellises and tree-cutting equipment in the painting supports both interpretations, which I believe work well together. 30. Luginbilhl, "The Tree," 86-88. 31.

Souza not only entertained notable political, literary, and scientific figures such as Gouverneur Morris, Talleyrand, Stael, Condorcet, S6gur, Morellet, Delille, Suard, Laborde, and Buffon; she also participated in their political discussions, commenting on her guests' works and criticizing their views.

Compared to aristocratic Paris, in the novel Neuilly represents not only an idyllic country space, but also the realm of free play and radical break with tradition. This matches historical reality, for late eighteenth-century Neuilly was known for its fashionable English-style gardens and an eccentric landscape folly, the Folie Saint Jammes, erected by the Baron Baudard de Vaudesir in 1784. 46.
