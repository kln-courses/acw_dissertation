<plain_text><page sequence="1">International Journal of Politics, Culture, and Society, Vol. 5, No. 1, 1991 Editors' Note The issue of race has both national and international dimensions. In this issue we focus on moral and political dilemmas that affect relations between the races. Michael Banton points to a shift in U.N. rhetoric ac? counting for racial discrimination. He notes that in the 1960's the key con? cept was that of racial discrimination, as a kind of unlawful behavior. Later, there developed a contrary tendency treating racism as a sickness. Yvonne Newsome examines African-American-Jewish relations in the context of Israel's relations with South Africa. In the United States, Afro-Americans carry a heritage of enslavement that burdens them with the sin of sloth. Stanford Lyman argues that this is a feature of an embedded racist ideology that has survived the demise of institutionalized slavery. A critical issue facing American society is how to establish racial equality. Antoine Joseph shows that proposals for affirmative action involve competing claims for economic reward and fairness. The end of the Cold War presages a new ordering of international relations. Paula Fleming delineates the intentions and alternatives available to the protagonists and other interested parties in the recent Gulf war. A Harvard Anthropologist once suggested that the direction of hu? man evolution was "Up from the Ape." Jeffrey Nash and Anne Sutherland analyze an instance of the moral ascent of the gorilla. They argue that the Film, "Gorillas in the Mist" is but an example of a new animal ideology?a moral anthropomorphism redefining animal-human relations in the new middle classes. Our occasional review and assessment of modern sociology continues in this issue. The quarrel over how Max Weber is to be interpreted is joined by Franco Ferrarotti who examines Wilhelm Hennis' proposed resolution of the debate. ? 1991 Human Sciences Press, Inc.</page></plain_text>
