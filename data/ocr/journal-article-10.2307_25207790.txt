The President, on behalf of Prince Roland Bonaparte, presented to the Society a copy of the Prince's " Documens de l'Epoque Mongole." The President called attention to the severe loss the Society had suffered by the death of Dr. Rost, and gave expression in sympathetic words to the high estimation iu which the deceased scholar was held. He concluded by moving the following resolution, which was unanimously adopted: " The Royal Asiatic Society desires to express its very deep sympathy with Mrs. Rost under her recent sudden bereavement by the death of her husband, who as successively Secretary, Honorary Member, and Member of Council, not only rendered most valuable services to the Society, but was personally endeared to all such of its members as had the privilege of his personal acquaintance."</page><page sequence="2">366 NOTES OF THE QUARTER.

[The following is based on the obituary in the Academy of February 15, 1896.] Dr. Rost has not long survived his retirement from the India Office. He died very suddenly on February 7 at Canterbury, whither he had gone on duties connected with St. Augustine's College. He had just completed the seventy-fourth year of his age. Reinhold Rost was born in 1822 at a little manufacturing town in the duchy of Sax-Altenberg, where his father was a Lutheran Minister, holding the office of Archdeacon. After attending the Gymnasium in the capital of his native state, he entered at the neighbouring University of Jena, where he graduated as Ph.D. in 1847. Having already determined to devote himself to Oriental studies, he came at once to England, the great storehouse of Sanskrit MSS. His first post was that of Oriental Lecturer at the Missionary College at Canterbury, with which he remained associated till the last. From 1864 to 1869 he was Secretary to the</page><page sequence="4">368 NOTES OF THE QUARTER. Royal Asiatic Society, and was then appointed Librarian to the India Office in succession to Dr. Fitzedward Hall, who survives him. This is one of the few posts in England that may be regarded as an endowment for Oriental research. The official duties are not heavy, but the collection of MSS. is one of the largest in the world, and their custodian is necessarily brought into contact with students of all countries. In addition he acts as adviser in philological matters to the Secretary of State for India, who still dispenses some of that literary patronage in which the old Company was so profuse. Dr. Rost will long be remembered as Librarian to the India Office. If he left it to others to catalogue and edit the MSS., this was not through incapacity for either task. Though primarily a Sanskritist, he had to consider the claims of Arabic and Persian, of Pali, Burmese, and Sinhalese, of Tibetan and Malay, and of countless ver naculars. Of all these languages we have mentioned, he possessed a competent knowledge; and he had further to give his attention to questions relating to archaeology, ethnology, and Indian history. In brief, Dr. Rost elected to turn himself into an Oriental encyclopaedia, which no one ever consulted in vain. Through his initiative MSS. were lent freely to foreign scholars; and it is hardly too much to say that on the Continent he was regarded as a steward of Oriental knowledge to whom everyone might appeal without hesitating for assistance and advice. This feeling was strongly expressed in a testimonial presented to him in 1892, when it was rumoured that he was to be retired compulsorily from his post. Frenchmen joined with Qermans in testifying to the kindness and impartiality which he had always displayed towards fellow-students. The Government allowed him one year more of office and of work; but he was superannuated (sorely against the grain) in 1893. Dr. Rost wrote little under his own name. His first publication was a short essay (1850) on a Pali law book from Burma law, and he also compiled a Catalogue of the</page><page sequence="5">ABEL HOVELACQUE, OP PARIS. 369 Palm-leaf MSS. in the Imperial Library at St. Petersburg. He was content to be known as the editor of H. II. Wilson's Selected Works, of Brian Hodgson's Collected Papers, and of four volumes of Miscellanies relating to Indo-China. He edited for Messrs. Trubner and Co.'s publishing firm a series of "Simplified Grammars," and for many years contributed literary notes to their trade circular, the " Oriental Record." But his modesty did not deprive him of all public recognition. Edinburgh made him LL.D., and Oxford conferred on him the rarer distinction of Honorary M.A. He was an Honorary or Corresponding Member of the Royal Asiatic Society and of many learned Societies on the Continent and in the East. Prussia, Russia, and Sweden gave him decorations; and our own Government appointed him Compauion of the Indian Empire in 1888. Abel Hovelacque, of Paris. Science and Oriental studies have suffered a great loss by the death of M. Abel Hovelacque, which occurred on Saturday, February 22nd, 1896. Born in Paris, Nov. 14th, 1843, he studied first for the Bar, but, at the same time, he was induced to take interest in linguistics, and attended Prof. II. Chavee's classes, who taught him comparative philology. He particularly devoted himself to Sanskrit and Zend, and published some valuable pamphlets. He was a founder of the Revue de Linguistique (1867), where his first essays appeared, and of which ho became Director in 1869; in 1877 he resigned tho task, having for several years been deeply interested in anthropological researches. In the year 1876 a public school for Anthropology was founded in Paris, with five pro fessors; among them Hovelacque was engaged to teach the science of language, and he fulfilled the task most successfully. In 1891 he was appointed, by his fellow professors, Director of the school, which comprises at present</page><page sequence="6">370 NOTES OF THE QUARTER. no less than ten professors. For ten years his health had suffered, and from 1894 the illness seriously increased and led to the fatal issue, which the best care and attention were unable to prevent. In the meantime he occupied himself with politics, and was elected in 1878 a member of the Paris Municipal Council, of which he was the President in 1886 and 1888; in 1889 he was sent to the Parliament as Deputy of the XIIIe Paris district, but resigned in 1894. His principal works are the following ones:?La thdorie epicienne de lautverschiebung (1869), Racines et iUments simples (1869), Grammaire de la langue zend (1869; 2nd ed. 1878), Instructions pour Vttude e'limentaire de la linguistique indo-europienne (1871), Euphonic sanskrite (1872), La France et les Slaves de Sud (1872), Langues?races?nationalitis (1873 ; 2nd ed. 1875), La linguistique (1876; 2nd ed. 1877; 3rd ed. 1881; 4th ed. 1887: English translation, London, Chatham, 1877), Notre ancitre (1877; 2nd ed. 1878), LfAvesta Zoroastre et le Mazdiisme (1880), Mtudes de linguistique et d%ethnographic (with Prof. J.

Vinson, Pam, March, 1896.</page><page sequence="7">NOTES AND NEWS. 371 IV. Notes and News. Notice to Members.?A series of three maps was issued in 1855 to illustrate a paper, in Vol. XV, o.s., J.R.A.S., by Captain Felix Jones, on "The Topography of Nineveh." These maps were issued apart from the Journal, and were in three large sheets. The Society is desirous of purchasing one or more sets of these maps, and the Secretary would be glad to hear from any member who wishes to dispose of a set. Caste Rules in Mann.?Prof. Hillebrandt, of Breslau, in an interesting paper in vol. xii of the " Germanistische Abhandlungen," has pointed out that many of the supposed caste rules in Manu?under which the unfortunate Qtidra can be mutilated or tortured or killed for offending a Brahmin, and is declared to be incapable of holding property or of learning the Vedas?can be matched by similar rules as to the treatment of slaves in German, Greek, and Roman law. Brahmanism, therefore, in this point, was not the maker of harsh rules, but was only preserving and carrying on social customs which had become historic facts in India, just as they had under similar circumstances elsewhere. The Dharma Sdstras.?In a dissertation presented to the University of Leipzig for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, Mr. G. B. Bcainan takes the second chapter of the Mitnava Dharma Sastra, and dividing the whole into 167 paragraphs, discusses the source of each. He argues that of the whole, 46 were due to Sutras now lost, 16 are pure interpolations, 4 have been derived from the textbooks of the Sankhya, and 99 (or 60 per cent.) are derived from extant Dharma or Grhya Sutras. Taking the passage of Yajiiavalkya dealing with the same matter, and dividing it into 46 passages, he argues that 15 have been drawn certainly, and 5 doubtfully, from non-extant, and 26 (or 53 per cent.) from extant Dharma or Grhya Sutras. In only 4 cases can we be sure that the author has borrowed from Manu. The argument is well and carefully conducted, and it is</page><page sequence="8">372 NOTES OF THB QUARTER. a distinct advantage to have the results stated in this quantitative manner. It touches, it is true, only the passages referred to, but the author thinks these are a fair sample of the whole of Manu and Yiijilavalkya respectively. Baldmua and his Work on Ceylon.?Under this title Mr. Donald W. Ferguson, M.R.A.S., has published (Colombo : Observer Office) a reprint of his very careful and accurate articles on the life of Baldams, and on the bibliography of the early editions of his work, which contained in its slight notice of Tamil grammar the first Tamil printing in Europe. Buddhist Texts.?Dr. K. E. Neumann, of Vienna, is bringing out a complete translation into German of the Dialogues of the Majjhima Nikaya, and the first fasciculus, containing the translation of the first 63 pages of Trenckner's edition for the Pali Text Society, has already appeared (8vo, pp. 96. Fr. Friedrich: Leipzig, 1896). We con gratulate Dr. Neumann on so useful and important an undertaking, and trust it will receive adequate support. It is a bold step to commence such a work before the commentary (an edition of which is in preparation for the Pali Text Society) has been published. In his intro duction, which makes no mention of previous work in the same field, the author makes light of the value of Buddha ghosa's commentary. But the published fasciculus shows how thoroughly Dr. Neumann is at home with the texts of which he proposes to give us a version, and with his training and ability and enlightened sympathy he bids fair to contribute work of the first importance for the elucidation of Buddhism. The Maha-bhdrata.?Professor Ludwig has published as a reprint from the " Sitzungsberichte der koniglichen bohmischen Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften" a paper on the mythical basis of the Maha-bharata (8vo, pp. 26. Rivnac: Prag), in which he maintains the proposition that we have in that poem the working together of two distinct elements?a poem on the struggle between the sun and the</page><page sequence="9">NOTES AND NEWS. 373 darkness of the night, and a kind of bardic poem (a suta) on a possibly actual war; but the former of the two, and not the latter, is the actual basis of the whole. The gods have, in fact, here become men, and we have before us a case of the anthropomorphic treatment of mythical tradition. Oandhdra Sculptures.?Mr. Anderson, at vol. i, p. 221, of his Catalogue of the India Museum, describes one frieze (Q 36) without being able to identify it further than thinking that two of the figures are Buddha and Devadatta. Professor Serge D'Oldenbourg, at p. 274 of "Zapiski" (the Journal of the Oriental Section of the Russian Imperial Archaeological Society), very ingeniously points out that this frieze is an illustration of the episode of Jaya and Vijaya recorded at pp. 366 foil, of the Divyavadana. This is no doubt correct. And it shows the importance, from the point of view of archaeology, of such texts being translated. There are so many in charge of museums in India who are in the first place naturalists, and who therefore do not read, and cannot be expected to read, Sanskrit and Pali, that translations of the texts referring to the objects in their charge is absolutely essential. Buddhist Text Society of India.?The Government of Bengal has made a grant of 2000 rupees to this Society towards the publication of the series of rare Buddhist texts, collected at Government expense during the last fifty years, from Nepal, Tibet, and Burma. Assyrian Text Book.?Eighty-three plates of cuneiform, a title-page, five pages of preface, a list of contents covering three pages, and a cover with two pages of advertisements, is the amount that an outlay of ?1 6s. obtains from the reckless purchaser who buys Prof. Craig's "Assyrian and Babylonian Religious Texts." As far as a comparison of one or two of the pages goes, thoy are very correctly reproduced, but the publishers could easily have given students the benefit of cuneiform type in place of the rather unsatisfactorily printed autographed plates of which</page><page sequence="10">374 NOTES OP THE QUARTER. the work is composed. Though several of the plates have already been published, the texts given by Prof. Craig form a very interesting collection, and students will look forward to the translations and notes, which he promises to give in the second volume. Chronology of Genesis.?Prof. J. Oppert's " Chronologie de la Genese," published in the Revue des Uudes juives (tome xxxi, 1895), shows all the originality and deep learning that characterize this veteran Assyriologist's work. Prof. Oppert points out that the Creation, for which the Bible allows seven days, occupied, according to the Chaldean system, 1,680,000 years. He examines the dates of Genesis and of Berosus, with special reference to the Patriarchs before and after the Flood. The totals of the years they lived may be divided, as he points out, into epochs, which are multiples of the number 23; and other calcula tions reveal the existence of the numbers 70, 90, and 100 as multiplicands. He also points out that the figures in Genesis, to all appearance so dry, nevertheless enable one to guess the existence of myths current in early ages, but lost to us, in all probability, for ever. Pandit I^varacandra Vidydsdgara.?Mr. Sricharan Chakra varti has published at Calcutta a very appreciative little account of the life and work, literary and philanthropic, of this fine representative of the native scholar and patriot. A portrait is given (not a very flattering one), but there is unfortunately no bibliography, and the scholar is rather overlooked, throughout the book, in the philanthropist. Prof. Sayce, Vice-President of the Society, has been re-appointed to the Chair of Assyriology at Oxford for a further term of five years. Dr. Wilhelm Geiger, Professor of Sanskrit and Comparative Philology at the University of Erlangen, Germany, has arrived in Ceylon for the purpose of studying the Sinhalese language, which is his chief object in going out to the island. He is fully equipped with letters of introduction from the Colonial Office in London, and from his Government,</page><page sequence="11">NOTICES OF BOOKS. 375 and trusts that every help will be rendered him by the scholars in Ceylon. He is writing an account of tho Sinhalese language for Dr. Buhler's Encyclopaedia. The Council of the Senate at Cambridge recommend that the Panjab University be adopted as an affiliated institution, subject to the condition that the privileges of affiliation bo extended only to graduates in Arts. We would call the attention of our readers to Messrs. Kegan Paul, Trench, Triibner, and Co.'s Catalogue of Oriental Books for sale, which will be found at the end of this issue of our Journal. V. Notices of Books. A First Catechism of Tamil Grammar. By the Rev. G. U. Pope, D.D., with an English Translation by the Rev. D. S. Herrick. (Oxford: The Clarendon Press, 1895.) Dr. Pope has rendered essential service to Tamil literature. He has written three Grammars for the students of that language, besides editing in it several classical works. After many years of study, he is still profitably occupying himself in perfecting his former works, and in making them more extensively useful; and it is touching to read the following sentence from the prefatory note to this little volume, which shows how his heart still turns with affectionate remembrance to the language and the people among whom he laboured so long: " Fifty-eight years' work at Tamil has made the writer ever more and more sensible of the beauties of the language, and his only wish is that this little book may still help forward the causo of sound education among those whom he loves." This Catechism was written so far back as 1842. It was composed in Tamil, and has been extensively used in schools for Tamil children. It is now accompanied by an English translation by one of Dr. Pope's former pupils at Oxford; and has thus been made available for Europeans studying</page><page sequence="12">376 NOTES OF THE QUARTER. the Tamil language. Dr. Pope also wrote a second Catechism of Tamil Grammar, which he proposes to publish in the same diglot form; and a third or Complete Grammar of the Tamil Language, in which the higher or the classical dialect of that very fertile tongue is included, should there be a demand for it, and should tho issue of the two former be successful enough to give him sufficient encouragement. The translation of this little book into English, thus making it bilingual, will effectually unlock its mysteries for English students. It is partly written in the Tamil method and .partly in the English, and this combination will be good practice for the European, who usually goes to India at a comparatively late period of life, and is made competent by previous training to assimilate both methods. We have glanced through the book, selecting passages here and there, and it seems to us well and adequately translated. It must necessarily be a very great help to one who may honestly desire to become thoroughly acquainted with the language of the people among whom he is to dwell, and over whom he may possibly have to work and rule. One good point about the book is that the student must learn the Tamil character, or he cannot perfect himself in the language. There is very little transliteration into the Roman character; but on that little we cannot help making just a remark or two. We observe that ? is transliterated both in this book and in the First Lessons in Tamil, which was recently published by Dr. Pope at Oxford, by f, whereas in Dr. Pope's books published at Madras s was used. It is a matter of taste, but to us the old love seems the better. Would it not be advisable to omit altogether such awkward forms as the double short accent u and I P As usual, the book is beautifully and accurately printed by the Clarendon Press, and we have scarcely detected a single printer's error. Oriental students in South India are much indebted to Dr. Pope for this handy Introduction to the Tamil language. H. M.</page><page sequence="13">NOTICES OF BOOKS. 377 Mara und Buddha. Von Ernst Windisch. 4to, pp. 348. (Leipzig: Hirzel, 1895.) This monograph, published as Part iv of the Proceedings of the Historical Division of the Royal Society of Science of Saxony, is devoted to a discussion, firstly, of the legend of Mara, as handed down iu the early Buddhist records (pp. 1-220 and 322-327) ; and, secondly, of the early accounts of Gotama's first meeting with King Bimbisara at Rtijagaha (pp. 220-322). Ali the text passages relating to both of these subjects are here collected and contrasted (where possible iu parallel columns), and translated with numerous notes, in which the readings are discussed and a number of difficult or doubtful words are elucidated. The historical relationship to one another of these different texts, and of various paragraphs or even phrases used in them, is carefully discussed; and the question of the origin and gradual evolution of the conception of Mara is elaborately and convincingly worked out. No portion of the vast field of the history of Buddhist ideas has been hitherto treated with anything like the same completeness and thoroughness; and in applying to this particular portion the recognized canons of a strict historical criticism, the more general problem of the right treatment of the Buddhist records as a whole is incidentally dealt with in a similar spirit? a spirit utterly opposed to the absurd and uncritical way of muddling up all the different versions of each episode as if they were of equal value (or rather of equal worthlessness). Naturally, in a monograph dealing with so great a mass of detail there are some points on which scholars may differ from the author. One of these is the reiterated use, when referring to the death of the Buddha, of the phrase 'enter in to Nirvana.' There is no word in the texts corresponding to any one of the four words thus chosen to reproduce the sense of tho Pali word parinibbdyati. The Buddha, like every other A rah at, was supposed to have attained the state of mind called Nirvana during his life, and in his case the precise time of that event was on the day of his Enlightenment j.k.a.s. 1896. 25</page><page sequence="14">378 NOTES OF THE QUARTER. under the Bo Tree. Nibbdna-dhdtuyd (as the author rightly points out on p. 74) is, of course, a locative; but it is a locative, not in the sense of 'entering into' (which would require an accusative), but in the sense of a locative absolute. The meaning of the expression is really placed beyond doubt by such phrases as ' the wise [speaking of the Arahats] go out like this lamp' (Ratana Sutta 14), or 'the dying out of a flame,' used as a metaphor of the death of the Buddha at Mahaparinibbana Sutta, p. 62. The expression ' entering into Nirvana' is only a very old Anglo-Indian blunder, dating from the time when the first writers on Buddhism, saturated with modern Western ideas, took for granted that Nirvana must be some state beyond the grave. But the universal Indian usage of the time, whether in Pali books by Buddhist authors or in Sanskrit books by both Buddhists and Hindus, confines the connotation of the word exclusively to the state of mind of a living Jlvanmukta or Arahat. Another matter of detail, of equal importance, is the use of the phrase 'Northern and Southern' for the Sanskrit and Pali books. When Buddhism first became known in the West, it had been driven out of India, and the Sanskrit Buddhist MSS. came to us from Nepal in the north, while the Pali ones came from Ceylon in the south. It was natural, therefore, then to distinguish them as Northern and Southern, and in that sense the distinction was quite correct. Insensibly, however, the use of the words was supposed to mean much more, namely, that the Sanskrit books were all written in Nepal, and the Pali Pitakas composed in Ceylon. Such an inference is entirely un justified. And no one would object to it more strongly than our author. But it leads to so complete a perversion of the history of Buddhist literature that the only way to avoid endless confusion is to drop the use of these ambiguous words altogether. So far as our present information goes, it is most probable that nearly all the early books?that is, the books, whether Sanskrit or Pali, earlier, or not much later, than the Christian era?were composed in the valley</page><page sequence="15">NOTICES OF BOOKS. 379 of the Ganges. But we do not know the exact place of origin of any one of them. And no one can say for certain that the Divyavadana, for instance, or the Lalita Vtstara, was written in a spot to the north of the place where the Padhiina Sutta, for instance, or the Eatha Vatthu was composed. Why, then, continue the use of a phraseology which ignorant or careless readers may, and probably will, understand in a sense different from that intended P It should be added that the author very seldom does use it, and in the majority of cases has been led, by a sound instinct, to the use of more exact and less ambiguous terms. The question raised in the last paragraph really lies at the root of all critical judgment of Buddhist questions. Even the terms Pali and Sanskrit are objectionable, though in a less degree, and though they do not contain the suggestio falsi lurking in the terras Northern and Southern. There is no such thing as a Pali Buddhism, much less a Sanskrit Buddhism. It is therefore a matter of the first importance that the present author has made the great advance (conspicuous, not only in the terms he usually uses when comparing the books, but also in the whole tone of his monograph) of specifying in each case the book itself by name. This is not only the safest way, it is the only right way. But when it has become universal (as it certainly will some day) it will render necessary the re writing of much that has been written by Sanskritists on Buddhism. What would become of such a statement as this, found in the latest book of the kind ?? " The distinction between Northern and Southern doctrine is indicated by the terms ' Great Vehicle' and ' Little Vehicle' respectively." To point out the blunders, both of fact and of implication, in this striking announcement would become unnecessary if our author's excellent plan were followed of saying rather?" Such and such a doctrine is to be found in 8uch and such a book," and then proceeding to discuss the historical position of the doctrine in question. The crux of Pattakkhandho, p. 119, has already been</page><page sequence="16">380 NOTES OF THE QUARTER. solved at "Vinaya Texts," iii, 13?and compare Milinda 5; Anguttara, iii, 73. 4; Divyavaditna 633. Dlgha Nikaya should be read for Majjhima Nikaya at pp. 33, 39. It is strange that at p. 118 no mention is made of the parallel passage at Majjhima i, 234 (where the right readings are given), and the meaning of kathala 'potsherd' seems clear enough from Culla Vagga, v, 22. 1; Dlgha, 2. 98; Puggala Pafiflatti, 3. 14; Samyutta, iv, 313. Cankamd orohitvd on p. 150 is not merely 'gave up walking,' but 'stepped down from the place [cloister one might call it] where he had been walking up and down meditating.' Such a cankama was a constant appendage to a vihara. So on p. 151, lines 21 and following, the meaning is surely rather that Sail jlva used easily to attain the state called Sanfia-vedayita-norodha, whether he might have gone into a wood, or sat at the foot of a tree, or, etc. On p. 191 (last line), what the hearer gets to know is, inter alia, that there will be no rebirth for him into this world. The words to be supplied in the text at Samyutta, 2. 195, are, of course, the same as in Vinaya, vol. i, p. 14, and often found elsewhere. On page 75 (four lines from the bottom), for Halbgott read Mensch. On pp. 65, 81 the author, on the supposed authority of the Divyavadana, understands Gotamaka Cetiya to mean the Bo Tree. But it is quite clear that this pre-Buddhistio sacred place was close to Vesali?so Jataka, ii, 259?and cannot therefore have been the Bo Tree at Gaya, which was an Assattha, not a Nigrodha tree. The interpretation of dcariyakam at p. 71 is scarcely consistent with Maha Vagga, vi, 37. 1, and the Sonadanda Sutta at Dlgha, 1.119; and on the same page the expression 'wonder-working truth' is, after all, supported by the use of the opposite phrase appdtihiram katham 'ineffectual talk,' of the talk of the Brahmans in the Tevijja Sutta. On p. 80, line 12, the ti on the last line of p. 32 of the text and the bhante on the first line of p. 33 show that in the latter case it is Ananda who is speaking, and not the Buddha; and the logical sequence of the thought was already visible enough in the versiou in "Buddhist Suttas," pp. 54, 55. Why</page><page sequence="17">NOTICES OF BOOKS. 381 should the word Zufall have been chosen at p. 61 to express the similar result of similar causes P The general results of the author's investigation into the history of the Mara legend are as follows :? (1) That tho Buddha had so far overcome both death and transmigration that for him and his disciples death led no longer to a new life and a new death. (2) Buddha himself made use of a poetical expression, drawn from existing beliefs and expressions in the pre Buddhistic Brahmanical literature, in which he apostro phized Mara, the personification of death or evil, as defeated. (3) After his death these expressions were held to be not only poetical but historical. And as they are related to have been used at various times and places during his long career, so the earliest versions of the legend represent the attacks or temptations of the Evil One as having been continuous throughout his life. (4) But gradually the legend gets more and more to regard the victory of the Buddha as won, once for all, under the Bo Tree. And the episode of Mara's daughters is then introduced. (5) Last of all comes the long description of the Buddha's victory then and there over the hosts of Mara's army. (6) Together with this last phase we have the commence ment of the train of ideas by which the Bodhisat is brought ever more and more into prominence. (7) It is in the Sutta Nipata and the Samyutta Nikiiya that we have the oldest form of the legend. The Mahil parinibbtina Sutta account is later, and the account in the Sanskrit books, as a whole, later still. But these last have, in many details, preserved reminiscences of a form of the tradition older even than the oldest of the Pali books, and are invaluable for a right understanding of the whole question. All these conclusions will, we believe, be sooner or later accepted. But it is not so much on that account, or ou account of the large number of philological points eluci dated, as on account of the admirable critical spirit shown</page><page sequence="18">382 NOTES OP THE QUARTER. throughout the work, that we think this monograph will make an epoch in the study of Buddhism, and of the history of Indian thought. It will be a fortunate day when we get any one of the essential doctrines of Buddhism?such, for instance, as Arahatship, or the doctrine of the Sankharas, or the scheme of causation, the Paticca-samuppada?treated in the same masterly way; and we trust the author may be encouraged by the complete success of his present effort to deal here after with the daily increasing material for the treatment of one of these questions. Rh. D. Catalogue of Hebrew Books in the British Museum acquired during the years 1868-1892. by s. van Straalen. 4to, pp. vi+532. (London, 1894.) The Library of the British Museum has increased its treasures continually, since the time of the first Catalogue compiled by the masterly hand of Zedner twenty-five years ago. To Mr. Van Straalen we owe the Catalogue of the new acquisitions, elaborated in great part on the lines laid down by his predecessor. It would be out of place to speak here of the nature and value of the new acquisitions. They do not come up in the remotest way to the extreme value of the earlier collection, which abounds in Unica and Incunables. To acquire scarce books is, however, not a thing that depends upon the Librarian; chance will often throw a book in his path for which he may havo been looking in vain for years. But as far as I have been able to ascertain, the efforts of the new Librarian are directed to obtain all those works which appear in the East, and are often printed in so very limited a number that they seldom reach the European market. In one point this Catalogue is superior to Zedner's, viz. in the addition of the pressmark, by which the student is saved a great deal of trouble and search. An excellent index, comprising both volumes, fills almost one-half of this Catalogue (pp. 311-532). It is a pity</page><page sequence="19">NOTICES OF BOOKS. 333 that the pages of vol. i have not been given in the reference. The work is done conscientiously and carefully, and the Catalogue will prove a boon to students of Hebrew literature in one of the greatest libraries of the world. I cannot let this occasion pass without expressing ray regret that this volume has not been issued by the Trustees in the same size as the previous one of Zedner. The last named is a beautiful handy octavo volume, whilst this new one is a large unwieldy quarto. The price of ?3 3*. is also almost prohibitive, and the type leaves much to be desired. It contrasts very unfavourably with, for instance, the beautiful Catalogue of Greek Papyri, issued also by the Trustees of the British Museum. M. G. Barlaam and Josaphat. English Lives of Buddha. Edited and Indexed by Joseph Jacobs. 8vo, pp. cxxxii + 56. (London: D. Nutt, 1896.) In an attractive, skilful, but sometimes flippant style, Mr. Jacobs has retold the old tale of the wanderings and transformations of the great legend of Renunciation, told of Buddha. He recasts in an easier form the solid work of Prof. Euhn, which I brought under the notice of tho readers of our Journal in 1894 (pp. 402-404). A general introduction, in which, I am sorry to say, I have not found any progress over Kuhn's elaborate and minute study, leads up to the summary of the framework and the short description of the Parables, with full but not complete bibliographical notes. It is surprising that Mr. Jacobs should not have taken any notice in his introduction of Mr. Conybeare's important, discovery of the Armenian version. The antiquity of the Armenian literature gives it, on account of this fact alone, a prominent position in the history of literary tradition; and the dependence of the Georgian and Gruzinian litera ture?the latter also not mentioned by Mr. Jacobs?upon</page><page sequence="20">384 NOTES OF TJEIE QUARTER. the Armenian, points to this version as the connecting link between the lost Pahlavi and those versions which are independent of the Greek. A direct translation from Arabic, as is assumed by Mr. Jacobs, is entirely out of question, and a Syriac intermediary is, to say the least, very doubtful. Mr. Jacobs has also not made use of the in formation contained in Mr. Ward's Catalogue, to which I referred in my last review, and from Slavonic and Rumanian literature many more parallels could have been added, even from my "Literatura populara" and Pypin's old but still valuable "OcerkH." For those who have no access to Kuhn's book, Mr. Jacobs' will prove very useful. M. G. Panca-krama. By L. de la Vall?e Poussin. 8vo, pp. 56. (Engelcke, Ghent.) This little manual of the later Tantric Buddhism is divided into five chapters, four of which are assigned in the colophons to Nagarjuna, and the fifth to Sakyamitra. The present editor is inclined to think that the work, as we now have it, has been recast by Sakyamitra on the basis of an older work of Nagarjuna. The latter's date is uncertain, but feikyamitra was, according to Taranatha, a contemporary of Devapala, son and successor of Gopiila, the founder of the Pala dynasty of Bengal, and would have lived therefore in the ninth century a.d. Both his teacher 6akya-prabhu, and the latter's teacher Punyaklrti, came from "the East" (probably Bengal), and he himself, who also wrote a work entitled the " Kosaliilankara," was born in Kosala. He belonged, therefore, neither to the North nor to the South, but to the famous Middle Country of Buddhism, in which almost all the Buddhist works known to us were composed. The whole of the little work is here edited from a single MS. in the Biblioth&amp;que</page><page sequence="21">NOTICES OF BOOKS. 385 Nationale, and in the roman character; and it is ac companied by the commentary also found in the same manuscript. The edition has all the advantages (and, it may be added, the inevitable shortcomings) incidental to such an edition from a single MS. Short as it is, it throws very valuable and welcome light on the mystic side of later Buddhist speculation, of which the germs, as the author rightly points out, can be clearly traced already in the Pali books. The thanks of students are due to him for taking up this unexplored field in the Buddhist history of Indian thought; and they will look forward to the further labours in the same direction of which he holds out tho promise, and more especially to a detailed comparison of the five stages of this treatise with the ancient five Jhsinas on the one hand, and the Yoga system on the other. Rh. D. Jinalankara BY Buddha-rakkhita. Edition with Intro duction, Notes, and Translation by James Gray. 8vo, pp. 112. (London : Luzac, 1894.) This little Pali poem of 250 stanzas is a very interesting and curious production. The editor accepts, without question, the tradition (for which he gives no authority) that ascribes to the author the astounding date of 426 B.C. But the poem, if such it can be called, is a series of puzzles and tours de force in Pali based on the legend of Buddha, and incorporating all the latest phases of it. It must be later, therefore, than any of the works in which that legend is set forth in gradually growing absurdity. And the only safe course is to argue from the fact that Buddhadatta, the cotemporary of Buddhaghosa, wrote the only existing commentary upon it, that it must be at least as old as the fourth century of our era. Even so it is interesting, as probably the oldest specimen in Pali of this kind of literary bad taste. Its sole importance is the light it can thus shed on the history of Indian literature; for it has</page><page sequence="22">386 NOTES OF THE QUARTER. no beauty of style, nor does it contribute anything to our knowledge of Buddhism. One line reads? Namo tassa yato mahimato yassa tamo na, which is very forced as Pali, but has the supposed excellent advantage of being able to be read either backwards or forwards. So verse 105 (comp. Kiratarjunlya xv, 14) runs? Noniinino nanunani nanenani nananino Nunnanenani nuna na nauanam nananena no, which, as Pali, is abominable, but is a very pretty trick with its n's only and its vowels. With the help of the commentator it is possible to puzzle out some sort of a meaning. Then we have a verse of four lines, each con taining the same letters, but having four quite different meanings; and rhyming verses of many sorts, and allitera tive puzzles of various kinds. It is really very ingenious, and it is good to have a correct edition of it; and the translation loosely reproduces Buddhadatta's solutions of the various puzzles. It is a pity the editor has not compared his author's work with the corresponding efforts in Sanskrit, which are usually placed a century or more later. Rh. D. Thesaurus Syriacus: collegerunt Quatremere, Bernstein, etc., auxit, disposuit, digessit, edidit R. Payne Smith, S.T.P. Fasc. 1-9. (Oxford: Clarendon Press.) It would be impossible to commence a review of this book without an expression of sorrow that the learned author should not have been spared to finish the work of his life. . When the first fasciculus appeared in 1868, it was calculated that the remaining nine would be published in as many years; in the twenty-eight years which have elapsed since then eight parts have appeared, bringing the dictionary down to the nineteenth letter of the Syriac alphabet; the part which is to contain the last three letters</page><page sequence="23">notices of books. 387 is not likely to be finished before the eud of this year, and even then the advice of those German scholars who demand a volume of addenda and corrigenda can scarcely be neglected. There has, therefore, been a mistake of eighteen years in the original calculation; a mistake which probably compares favourably with that committed with regard to another great lexicon also published by the Oxford Press. Of the life of the author this is not the place to speak, though it may be mentioned that at the commencement of middle life he gave up a lucrative headmastership in London in order to pursue his Syriac studies as sub-librarian of the Bodleian, and that we are indebted to him for a Catalogue of the Syriac MSS. in that library, as well as for several editions of Syriac texts. The founding of the Houghton Syriac prize, which has led many young scholars to study the language, was also due to his suggestion. However, the need of a new Syriac dictionary had probably been brought home to him before he returned to Oxford by the study of the Nitrian collection in the British Museum? that famous collection of which the "plums" were picked by Cureton, Lagarde, and Land, but of which there still remains not a little for the student who is anxious to do original work. "It never rains but it pours," and the learned world having been scantily provided with Syriac dictionaries until two years ago, has now quite a number at its disposal; and the late Dean's daughter and collaborates is well forward with another. But when the collection of the Thesaurus commenced, the amount that had been done for Syriac lexicography was by no means considerable. While the native Arabic dictionaries are so scholarly and exhaustive that Golius, Freytag, and we may even add Lane, have had little to do beyond translating and re arranging to make them serve for the use of Europeans, the Syro-Arabic glosses of Bar-Ali and Bar-Bahlul, on which the Syriac lexicographer has to build, are on the level of Hesychius and Suidas. Till very lately copies of</page><page sequence="24">388 NOTES OF THE QUARTER. these glossaries could only be seen at a few public libraries; however, an eminent French Seraitist, M. Duval, has now nearly completed his elaborate edition of Bar-Bahlul, while an American scholar has, at any rate, made great pre parations for editing Bar-Ali, of whose book one-half had previously been lithographed by Dr. Hoffmann, of Kiel. The only dictionary till recently in the hands of Europeans was the reprint made by Michaelis of the Syriac portion of the Heptagiott Lexicon of the Cambridge professor, Edmund Castell, bearing the date 1788, which, as has been well said, by no means came up to what the world might have expected of so eminent a scholar. Between the dates of Castell and Michaelis had come the Bibliotheca Orientalis of Assemani, and the Roman edition of S. Ephraera, placing Syriac scholarship on a very different level from the time when the literature was almost entirely represented by the Peshitta version of the Bible. Several persons before the Dean of Canterbury attempted to improve on Michaelis, but either gave up the idea or were prevented by death from carrying it out. Such among Dr. Payne Smith's own contemporaries were Cowper and Lagarde; earlier in the century the French Orientalist, Quatremere, and Bernstein, whose Glossary to Kirsch's Chrestoraathy still arouses admiration for its consummate scholarship. The materials collected by these two scholars were pro cured by the Clarendon Press for Dr. Payne Smith's Thesaurus; the notes of Quatremere were mainly based on the study of MSS. in the Paris Library, while Bernstein had worked through printed books. To these materials were added the notes collected by a Swedish scholar, Agrell, who had also planned a Syriac lexicon early in the century; and the valuable collections of Field, the editor of the " Hexapla," and of Rodiger, the distinguished colleague of Gesenius, afterwards came to swell the work. Although Dr. Payne Smith modestly placed the names of all these scholars on his title-page, as the collectors of the Thesaurus, claiming for himself only the merit of having increased, arranged, explained, and edited their materials, his own</page><page sequence="25">NOTICES OF BOOKS. 389 contribution of words, phrases, and references, obtained from an exhaustive study of the Syriac MSS. in the Bodleian Library, as well as from perusal of many of those in the British Museum, and by excerpting each new Syriac publication as it came out, must be greater than that of any of his predecessors. Very few of the editors of Syriac texts have done anything to help the lexicographer; Lagarde, who surpassed his contemporaries in the number and importance of the texts he issued, published them quite " naked," as he phrased it, i.e. without note, comment, or index; the collation of these texts with their Greek originals, where preserved, especially in the case of the Geoponica, where the order of the Greek differs entirely from that of the Syriac version, means a very serious task, which those who study these books with the aid of the Thesaurus will acknowledge that the Dean has faithfully performed. Where the texts have been translated and criticized, as is the case with Wright's Apocryphal Acts and Land's Aneedota Syrica, due notice has been taken in the Thesaurus of the opinions of the critics. Although, as appears from his review of Land's Aneedota, the Dean was a confirmed opponent of conjectural emendation, the columns of the Thesaurus abound in judicious emendations of the texts, suggested by a profound acquaintance with Syriac idiom. In the matter of etymology and comparison with the cognate dialects, the Thesaurus is at least as scientific as any other of the great storehouses of the Semitic idioms, and far less fanciful than some of them. The best work in tracing Aramaic words to Aryan sources has been done by Lagarde, whose acquaintance with Zend, Armenian, and modern Persian in all probability far surpassed that possessed by any other Semitic scholar; but his results were not always tenable, and Dr. Payne Smith was doubt less right in rejecting many of them. Tho cognate roots in Hebrew, the Jewish Aramaic, and Arabic were supplied, to some extent, out of the materials of Bernstein; but many of these would suggest themselves to any scholar, and it is likely that there are subtle rules of sound-change</page><page sequence="26">390 NOTES OF THE QUARTER. yet to be discovered which may bring many more affinities to light. The inclusion of the Mandaic, Jerusalem Syriac, and New Syriac dialects is justified by convenience; the lan guage of the Evangeliarium Hierosolomytanura has closer affinities with the Jewish than with the Christian Aramaic, but the "Chaldee" lexica do not recognize it; and the vocabularies of the other two dialects have hitherto been given only in out-of-the-way publications. The use of the Latin language, always hampering to the lexicographer, is to be defended by the interest taken by Roman Catholic scholars in the study of Syriac, and the Dean's example has been followed in Germany and at Beyrut. To estimate the amount that the Thesaurus has done for the furtherance of our knowledge of the language, a student has but to contrast his acquaintance with the words be ginning with the last three letters of the alphabet with what he can learn from the Thesaurus about the others. The extraordinary wealth of vocables and of phrases brought to light lends some sort of colour to the claim of some of the Syrians, ridiculed as an idle boast by Gibbon, that their language was superior to that of the Arabs. Fifty years ago it would have been sufficient to confront a Syriac vocabulary with the Ramus to refute such a pretension. Equally important are the serried ranks of carefully selected and accurately referenced examples, accompanying each word and teaching the history of the language and its local distribution. Only possible in a dictionary on this scale, these collections are the indispensable foundation for the scientific study of a great literary idiom. Perhaps the chronological arrangement in the Thesaurus is sometimes defective, but this the student can easily remedy for himself. It may be hoped that the completion of the work may be carried out with little delay, and with little deviation from the ideas and methods of the late Dean. With these the scholar who has been charged with the task is, through long co-operation, familiar. D. S. Margoliouth.</page><page sequence="27">NOTICES OF BOOKS. 391 Prakrit and Sanskrit Inscriptions op Kattywar, etc. Published by order of H.H. the Maharaja of Bhavnagar. This is a collection of fifty-four inscriptions from Kathiilvad and neighbouring parts of India, with English translations and forty-one plates. It is published by the Bhavnagar Archaeological Department, under the auspices of His Highness the late Maharaja of Bhavnagar, whose liberality deserves, indeed, most cordial acknowledgment.1 Some of these inscriptions are of very great interest, and have played an important part in the history of Indian epigraphy, and more than half of them have been published at least once before. Although the new editors2 must have been well aware of this fact, they, I regret to say, have neglected to take full advantage of it; and the result is that the texts and translations of the more important and difficult inscriptions here offered to the public fall far short of the standard of scholarship that .had already been attained by previous workers in the same field. Of the smaller number of inscriptions which are now published here for the first time, a few bring to light historical details of some value. But as the editors themselves confess that some of this fresh material has been taken from " written copies," not from the originals or impressions, it is indis pensable to have it re-edited critically before it can be utilized with confidence. Of the plates which accompany the texts some are fair, while others cannot for a moment be compared with the previously published plates of the same inscriptions.

To the indefatigable zeal of Dr. Neubauer we owe this second volume of his great publication of mediaeval Jewish chronicles. The historical literature of the Jews is very meagre in independent compositions. Only a few have enjoyed a comparatively wider circulation, whilst many lay unnoticed on the shelves of libraries or of cloisters. The former have also not had the good fortune of a critical edition. As a rule only one MS. was printed, without taking into consideration other MSS. of the same text. Of these three appear in Dr. Neubauer's edition, with variae lectiones and in a carefully prepared text. The first is " The Scroll of Fasting," dating probably in its inception from the era of the Maccabacans, for which Dr. Neubauer has made use of at least eight MSS. (p. 3). The second is "The Order" (i.e. the Chronological Order) of the world, from the printed edition, with which he has collated a MS. representing the so-called Franco-German tradition, and at least eight more fragmentary MSS. (p. 26). For completeness' sake Dr. Neubauer has added the so-called "Minor Order" (p. 68) in three recensions. He does</page><page sequence="35">NOTICES OF BOOKS. 399 not assign great value to this compilation, a view from which I dissent. If anything, we find in this "Minor Order" traces of the old Hellenistic biblical chronology and of the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs, in the dates assigned to the twelve children of Jacob. Thus far we have been dealing with texts which had been printed previously, but not critically. All the rest is quite new, and if Dr. Neubauer would have published only these, his publication would have ranked very highly in the literature of chronicles. The next text is now au Arabic short chronology from the Creation down to 1159, taken from MSS. discovered recently iu Egypt (p. 89). The gem of this collection is undoubtedly the chronicle in doggerel rhymes discovered by Dr. Neubauer in the Cathedral Library of Toledo It deals with the early settlements of Jews in South Ituly, the invasion of the Saracens in 872, the conquest of Egypt, etc. It was composed c. 1055, and throws a vivid light upon a period and circumstances hitherto totally unknown (p. 111). Next follows the diary of the famous David Reubeni, 1522-1525, from the facsimile of the unique MS. which once belonged to the Bodleian, but had disappeared since 1867. D. Reubeni pretended to be the emissary of the King of Ten Tribes, who had come to Europe to seek the assistance of the Pope and the King of Portugal against the Muhammedans. The description of his journey through Habor, Egypt, Palestine, etc., turns out to be accurate. Whatever may have been tho true origin of his pretended mission, there is no doubt in my mind that D. Reubeui was anything but an impostor; and how Dr. Neubauer can say that his Hebrew style is that of a German Jew, is to me in comprehensible. It shows throughout traces of Arabic influence, and one has only to compare non-religious writings of the Jews in Yemen to find absolutely striking parallels to that style, which at the first glance is rather startling (p. 133). Dr. Neubauer has added further eight appendices (p. 224 fF.) from scarce books on chronology and fragmentary MSS.,</page><page sequence="36">400 NOTES OF THE QUARTER. which complete the material thus richly brought together from various quarters. An exhaustive Index of Names, elaborated by Dr. Greenburg (late of the Montefiore College), enhances the value of this excellent publication, which, moreover, is not marred by the omissions in which Dr. Neubauer indulged in the first volume. He has given us this time all the texts in full, leaving the student to pick and choose those portions in which he takes a special interest. One would like to add a humble request to the Clarendon Press to do away with their Hebrew type. It is antiquated, thin?a sore to the eye and a trouble to the reader. M. G. The Religions of India. By Edward Washburn Hopkins, Professor of Sanskrit and Comparative Philology in Bryn Mawr College. (Boston, U.S.A., and London : Ginn and Co., publishers, 1895.) This volume opens a new series of "Handbooks on the History of Religions," under the general direction of Prof. Morris Jastrow, jun., of the University of Pennsylvania. The editor's plan is broad and comprehensive: he will deal himself with Babylonia and Assyria; the ancient Teutons are to have their turn next, at the hands of Prof. Chantepie de la Saussaye ; and Prof. Jackson, of Columbia College, will then describe the religion of Persia. The series is based on large and generous ideas of the value of the study of religious history; and Prof. Hopkins is not hampered in his ethical or philosophical appreciations by any dogmatic restraints or ecclesiastical reserve. Prof. Hopkins warns us at the outset that he does not desire to compete with Earth's well-known book under the same title. His aim and method are rather different. In the great procession of religions which passes across his stage, he proposes to introduce each successive figure, and</page><page sequence="37">NOTICES OF BOOKS. 401 let her speak for herself. So his pages are rich in illus trative quotations, which will undoubtedly be of great service to the general reader; they are often selected with sympathy and insight; and the chapters on the Hinduism of the Epics will open up to many students more at home in the earlier literature, most interesting glimpses into the development of moral and religious ideas. Excellent biblio graphical summaries will also point the way to those who seek further acquaintance with the original sources, and the more technical discussions of modern scholarship. Iu so vast a range, from the era of the Vedic hymns to the preaching of Keshub Chunder Sen, every reader is sure to desire that more stress should have been laid on the particular aspects of the great religious evolution in which he is especially interested. Criticism of Prof. Hopkins will, therefore, mostly take the form of pointing out omissions, trying to rectify wrong proportions, or protesting against false emphasis. The treatment of the Vedic hymns is moderate and cautious in its attitude to different schools of interpreters; but betrays an infirm philosophic basis in the adoption of the Hindu division of the gods into " Upper," " Middle," and " Lower," apparently for no better reason than because it is as good as another, for it can hardly be seriously pleaded that there was a chronological order either of worship or of hymn-production "from above earthwards." The want of definite criteria, whether theoretic or practical, seems most apparent in this section. Moreover, the historical background is never clearly filled in: ali through the book the details that are supplied enter only fitfully, aud in unexpected places; and tho pre sentment is at first too closely confined to the literary monuments, in forgetfulness of the fact that the Brahmanical schools, after all, only represented the views of a select aristocracy. There is only a brief glance at the unrecog nized cults, of the existence of which later literature bears such ample traces; and the numerous signs of the survival of the lower animism pass almost uunotud. In the descrip tion of the Brahmanic worship most students will probably</page><page sequence="38">402 NOTES OF THE QUARTER. feel that the chapter on the same subject in Hardy's volume (in the Munster series) conveys much more information, and in much more systematic fashion. The importance of ritual in modern study should have secured a fuller exposition of the leading ideas and practices. Still stranger, as it seems to us, is the neglect to trace the rise of the doctrine of transmigration, and the law of moral causation summed up in the one word karma. Prof. Hopkins justly repudiates the view (p. 425) that the samsdra was a Buddhist invention ; but his early references to it (pp. 199, 204) strike us as quite inadequate in view of the immense importance of the belief for all subsequent phases of Hindu thought. The transition from the account of ritual and philosophic Brahmanism to Buddhism is effected in a chapter on "Popular Brahmanism," which enables Prof. Hopkins to make interesting use of some of the materials in the Law-books. A great deal more might have been added from the Buddhist texts (to say nothing of the Jataka stories) had Prof. Hopkins been more familiar with them. As it is, the reader does not gather anything like a sufficiently vivid picture of the eager intellectual activity which marked the valley of the Ganges in the days when Jainism and Buddhism arose. Here and there an apt remark, such as that on p. 280, "One cannot read the Upanishad without feeling that he is already facing an intellectual revolt," creates an expectation which the sub sequent narrative fails to satisfy. This is particularly the case with the whole treatment of Buddhism. Like Jainism, this is presented as a great "heresy" (pp. 3, 283) or "schism." This unfortunate limitation grievously contracts our author's view. In his sketch of the personality of Gotama, he is sympathetic enough?" no man had ever lived so godless, yet so godlike " ; but he makes no attempt to analyse the elements of the ideal type of the Buddha, or to explain its enormous influence on the subsequent history of India. The originality of the conception of the Order, and the nature of its early missionary spirit, do not seem to receive sufficient recognition. The ambiguity of the</page><page sequence="39">NOTICES OP BOOKS. 403 following sentence (which is not a favourable specimen of our author's style) betrays, perhaps, the weakness of his grasp of this portion of his subject. After affirming that the monasteries are plainly of secondary growth, he con tinues :? "If one limit their national and political importance to a period one or two hundred years after the Master's time, he will not err in attributing to this cause, as does Barth, the reason for the rapid rise and supremacy of Buddhism over India." The period named by Prof. Hopkins carries the story down to the reign of Acoka, but this is dismissed in a few lines (p. 340), and after two pages more Buddhism expires in the twelfth or thirteenth century a.d. Different opinions will of course be formed as to the religious and philo sophical value of the teachings of the later books of the Great Vehicle. To some minds the theistic evolution represented in the "Lotus," for example, is an extremely interesting instance of the influence of a powerful school of metaphysical speculation on a system of ethical culture which had started by repudiating it. We do not quarrel with Prof. Hopkins for not stopping to expound it. But the influence of Buddhism on art and architecture ought to have received some notice; and the famous edicts of Acoka surely deserved more notice than the hare allusion to the ''credo which is engraved all over India." The arch ecological side of his whole subject, however, is left by our author in obscurity; nor has ho any word of the suggestive pictures which Hiouen Thsang has drawn for us of life in the University of Nalanda, or the great Quin quennial Assembly celebrated by Siladitya at Prayaga. In literature, on the other hand, the recognition of Buddhist traces in the later epic, though cautious, is careful and discriminating (pp. 423-426). There are other large questions touched by Prof. Hopkins in the interesting chapter on India and the West. Through Pythagorean ism, from which all subsequent philosophies borrowed, India, he thinks, helped to form the mind of</page><page sequence="40">404 NOTES OP THE QUARTER. Europe. He is more confident of the indebtedness of both neo-Platonists and Gnostics to Indian thought than we can be. But we must not open up these far-reaching themes. In another edition misprints, such as Brittanica and Mdgadha, should be avoided. Some words?" chrematheism," " esian," " triality," " rubricated," " coralled the kine," " mangonize " ?sound curious to English ears. Prof. Hopkins's book will not supersede that of Barth, but it will be a very useful supplement to it. Catalogue of Persian Manuscripts in the Cambridge University Library. By E. G. Browne, M.A., M.B. To all who are interested in Persian literature the name of the compiler of this Catalogue will be a sufficient guarantee for its accuracy and scholarship. Mr. Browne, in this handy and most clearly printed volume, gives us the fruit of four years' "arduous though intermittent labour." It is a work that should have been carried out long since, for a collection of MSS. without a published catalogue is of little use to any but those living on the spot. In the present case they were well-nigh inaccessible to students living in Cambridge itself, owing to the chaotic way in which all MSS. in Arabic character had been turned into the shelves without regard to language, subject, or even to size. Thus, before the Persian MSS. could be catalogued they had to be sorted out carefully from their Arabic, Turkish, and other companions. The collection comprises some 340 MSS. in all. Among these Mr. Browne has found?one may almost say discovered ?several rare and interesting works. Foremost among these with regard to antiquity comes the Commentary on the Qur'dn described on page 13 et seq. This work, of which no other copy seems to be known, has been subjected to a very careful examination, the results of which have in part already been made known to scholars through this Journal.1 ? J.R.A.S., July 1894, pp. 417-524.</page><page sequence="41">NOTICES OF BOOKS. 405 In the present Catalogue the compiler gives us some further extracts, and reproduces interesting opinions with regard to authorship and date communicated to him by various eminent Orientalists on the Continent, such as Noldeke and De Goeje. This commentary is of the greatest linguistic value, as the various peculiarities of writing, spelling, grammar, and vocabulary furnish us with fresh material for research into Iranian philology. The probable date of this MS. is fully discussed : it cannot, at any rate, be much later than the fifth century of the Ilijra. The whole text, though the actual matter it contains is of little interest, is well worth a careful edition. Of really old texts little bej'ond the invaluable Materia Medica of Abu Mansur Muwaffaq (about a.h. 360) is ac cessible to the student. Our MSS.?and hence our editions ?of the Shahnaraa are all more or less corrupt and much modernized. Next in interest we would place the Jdviddn-i-Kablr, which is described on page 69 et seq, a curious work on Isma'il! doctrines. It possesses a twofold interest: firstly, from an ethical point of view, as representing the tenets of the hitherto little known Ilu ruff sect of the Isma'ills ; and, secondly, from a linguistic standpoint?for a considerable portion of it is written in a dialect which Mr. Browne recognizes to be one of the West Persian dialects (akin to Luri and Kurdish), which M. Huart collectively designates Pehlevi-Musnlman. It is not dated, but appears to be of the fifteenth century. A brief list is appended of some of the dialectical words and forms, together with their Persian equivalents, as given in the interlinear glosses; and in conclusion a few specimen extracts illustrating the dialect. A very full notice is given (p. 122 et seq.) of an interesting collection of ta'zit/as. History and poetry are represented by the usual standard works, already treated of in other catalogues, so that it was only left for Mr. Browne to identify and describe them briefly. The work as a wholo leaves little or nothing to be desired, and can only add yet</page><page sequence="42">406 NOTES OF THE QUARTER. further to Mr. Browne's well-earned reputation for Persian scholarship. A few notes on the Persian Histories of India contained in the collection will be found below. E D. Ross. Notes on some of the Works relating to Indian History contained in Mr. Browne*s " Catalogue of the Persian Manuscripts in the Library op the University of Camhridge." Page 63, line 10.?This Mirzii Muhammad is probably identical with the Mirzii Muhammad, son of Mu'tamad Khan, mentioned on p. 167. He was the author of a most interesting memoir (finished in 1131 n.; there is a good copy in the India Office Library), and of the Tdrlkh-i-Muhammadi, an excellent obituary. His nephew, Muhammad Bakhsh, Ashob, tells us that he had a large library (see preface to the Shahddat-i FarrukJisiyar o j'alus-i-Muhammad Shah). Page 118, line 2 from end.?I would suggest that as the text has ^Jljjl J^:&gt;~1, it would be preferable to read Ahmad Shah Abdall, and not, as Mr. Browne proposes, Ahmad Shah Durrdnl. He was of the Abdall tribe, and the one epithet is as often attached to his name as the other. The omission to mention Gentil as Muhammad Aslam's patron is due, I presume, to the fact that Rieu, 151, has already done so (see also Elliot, Mahomedan Historians, viii, 163). Gentil's pricis of this work is in the Orme Collections, now in the Record Department of the India Office. It is in an unnumbered folio volume of 65 pages, in black binding, inscribed "Pour M. Orme historiographe de la Compagnie des Indes at Londres," and the title is "Pr&amp;ris sur l'Empire Mogol depuis Azam Shah, fils d'Aurangzab, 1707 jusqu'en 1774." It bears the following note, apparently in Robert Orme's hand</page><page sequence="43">NOTICES OF BOOKS. 407 writing: "Received June 21, 1785, at Colney: it was accompanied by a letter from Mons. D'Aragon, Secretary to the French Ambassador, to whom M. Anquetil Duperron had sent it with a letter dated June 4 : I read it June the 22nd." See also Orme's Historical Fragments, 171, note to Note vi, and 237, Note xlix. Muhammad Aslam's work must also have formed the basis for the historical part of Gen til's Me moires sur VIndoustan ou V Empire Mogol (Paris, 1822), published by his son.

The same noble held the same government for a few months in 1712, but not at any earlier period. Thus 1701 a.d. must be due to an error of some sort. Page 168, lines 4 and 5.?This entry of a purchase in 1167 H. of a book that had belonged to Mirza Mu hammad (b. Mu'tamad Khan) is interesting as throwing some light on the date of Mirzii Muhammad's death, which is disputed. His nephew, Muhammad BakJish, Ashob, in the work already referred to, tells us that his uncle's library was dispersed and sold after his death by an unworthy son. Therefore, as this book was sold in .1167 h., it is legitimate to infer that Mirza Muhammad was then dead. See the difficulty as to the continuation of his Tdrikh-i-Muhammadi after 1163 ii. raised by Rieu, Catalogue. Tho last entry in it is of 1208 h. But how could he have been alive then ? For we know from his Tazkirah that he (Mirzii Muhammad) was born at Jalalabad (province of Kabul) in 1098 ii. His nephew mentions him as alive in 1151 ii. at the time of Nadir Shah's invasion, but tho year of his death is nowhere given. We may now assume that he died a little before 1167 ii., and</page><page sequence="44">408 NOTES OF THE QUARTER. that the later entries in the T&amp;rlkh-i-Muhammadi are due to a continuator.

The labours of others in the field are referred to, in some cases at full length, but the " philological commentary " is not so full as it might have been. T. G. P. VI. Additions to the Library.
