<plain_text><page sequence="1">VOLUME XLVI, No. 4 FEBRUARY 17, 1949 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY WHITEHEAD'S DOCTRINE OF CAUSAL EFFICACY IN any analysis of experience a distinction must be made between (i) the accidental manifold of any experience, or the specific sense data, or the "given," or qualia exemplified in that experience, and (ii) the immediate content or nature of the experience consid- ered in abstraction from the specificity of the data.1 The latter is a consideration, relative to experience, of being-qua-being; that is, it is descriptive of those conditions to which any experience must con- form in order to lay any claim at all to be. For example, Hume's principle of sensation is a descriptive generalization purporting to hold over every instance of immediate experience. The principle says that the condition of any immediate experience is that it be an "impression," relegated into some "category," e.g., "sensation," of experience according to its "force and vivacity"; or, as stated by Whitehead, "that immediate experience is analyzable solely in terms of universals," where "universal" means a determinate, self- contained, unique sense quale, capable of recognition if repeated. The former, the accidental manifold of experience, I take it by modern consensus of opinion, is the locus of induction. For the applicability of any inductive hypothesis necessitates that its ob- jects be members of classes, which is impossible apart from some plurality of specific instances as the basis of a class concept, or at least a specific instance to define a unit class. But in (ii) we have abstracted completely from the specificity (and hence plurality) of the data of experience. Thus the formulation of the generalities 1 I say "immediate nature, or content" advisedly. The reference here is not to some a priori mode, or form, of subjective entertainment of the data. The Kantian tradition, which emphasizes the notion that experience involves a subjective construct, is led to its concept of the "a priori modes" of ex- periencing and cognizing in virtue of the fact that it does entertain quite definite assumptions regarding immediacy, what it calls the " matter " of experience, viz., the assumptions that the matter, the " given, " is merely intensive, non-relating, and that it is "given" to a substantial subject. It is evident that any thoroughgoing empiricism must confute this view that immediacy is mnerely inchoate experience; but it will be equally the contention of this paper that both the Humian and Kantian assumptions as to the nature of immediacy are inadequate and for this reason preclude a successful em- piricism. 85</page><page sequence="2">86 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY applicable to immediate experience apart from the specificity of data, or sensibilia, or qualia, falls outside the locus of what modern philosophy is wont to call "induction." Hereafter, when we use the word "immediacy" we shall mean experience without any reference to its specific data. The reason for the inadequacy of induction in dealing with the generalities applicable to immediacy, such as Hume's principle, is that induction depends upon what may be called the "principle of difference," and thus precludes any rationalization of those ele- ments constantly present in experience and so holding over every detail. In other words, the food for induction is limited to the specific sense qualia of experience, and qualia necessitate the agency of memory as the basis of their recognition and subsumption, and recognition necessitates repeatability, and repeatability the factor of difference, viz., that sometimes the quality is present and some- times it is absent in the experiential field, or at least sometimes it is attended to and sometimes it isn 't. The dependence of induction upon the fluctuation and heterogeneity of experience precludes any inductive success in the formulation of the broader generalities which experience qua immediacy exemplifies, that is, conditions under which all the heterogeneity of experience must be given, and of which the qualia of that experience are simply accidents. We can not appeal to any plurality of instances, or specificity of instances, in formulating the broader generalities, for experience per se is the instance. The appeal to plurality can only be the appeal for confirmation from another percipient. But unfortu- nately here the variant abilities of individuals in introspection, discrimination, and imaginative generalization lend no small diffi- culty in the confirmation. For example, there is at present little widespread agreement over the nature of the simple "sense datum," what is variously called "a quale," "the given," "pres- entation," "essence," etc.; but at least it is admitted that it isn't plurality here that counts, neither plurality of specific data, nor plurality of percipients. A proper understanding of the "given" may demand repeated reflections upon experience and comparisons with reports of others, but there is no ratio of probability based upon the number, arrangements, or specificity of these instances of consideration. A flash of insight may accomplish what a thousand instances and a thousand lesser philosophers could never have accomplished. Those generalizations applicable to immediacy we shall call, in contradistinction to the processes of induction, which result in scientific hypotheses or generalizations, "philosophical general- ities." It is evident that philosophical generalizations are not</page><page sequence="3">WHITEHEAD'S DOCTRINE OF CAUSAL EFFICACY 87 tested by some subsequent pragmatic verification or fulfillment of a prediction based upon some specific data in question. That is, only scientific hypotheses based upon certain inductive classifica- tions, observations of sequences among specific data, and postulates to account for deviations, gain validity by a fulfilled prediction consequent upon some planned operation. Ideally, in the verifica- tion of scientific hypotheses all we need are pointers correlated with the specificity of the givenness; if the readings of the pointers be- have as predicted, some further grade of probability is accorded the hypothesis. But the method of philosophical generalization and verification is one of sheer disclosure. Thus the philosophical generalities offer themselves to no possible method of "proof," apart from an appeal to "self-evidence" in their disclosure of the nature of immediacy. For this reason Whitehead has said that "philosophy is either self- evident or it is not philosophy." Self-evidence is a product of theoretical adequacy in handling the data of immediacy. The point is, that in the formulation of these generalities which stand as the necessary conditions of any and all instances of experi- ence, the logic of induction and the mechanical method of "proof," limited to the specific data and their patterns, is simply- inappli- cable. But nonetheless we do make such generalizations; and can not in fact get along without some tentative and hypothetical postu- lates as to the nature of our immediacy, e.g., concerning the "given" or "memory." Also these postulates are no less "empir- ical" than are scientific hypotheses, though there be no mechanical proof test of their validity. The generalization is " shoved-up- against experience, " so to speak, and finds its validity and accept- ance in the sudden revelation, "Yes, of course, this is precisely what I do experience!" Proceeding directly to Hume, the father of modern analyses of immediacy, we find his description alighting upon the clear-cut qualia, the "impressions of sensation, " the determinate colors, shapes, sounds, tactual data, qualitative emotions, visceral qualia, etc., that pattern the specious present. The "self-evidence," or validity, of such a generalization is apparent by virtue of its wide and long acceptance. Let us grant Hume the field-but not all the field. The principle is too elementary to be significant and too pretentious to be taken seriously. (i) It is too elementary in the sense that it is too generic. Hume himself attempted to make his analysis more significant by adding the distinctions of "force and vivacity," and thence classi- fying and distinguishing various species of the immediate qualia: first, impressions of sensation, of unknown origin (in the Soul);</page><page sequence="4">88 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY then, ideas of such impressions, "derived from" the impressions; then, impressions of reflection "derived from" the antecedent ideas; and then, ideas of impressions of reflection. Somewhere in this process there is to be found an impression of repetition of im- pressions. This need not be pursued for our discussion. (ii) It is too pretentious because it purports to be adequate in handling the total of immediate experience. This assumption is absolutely groundless apart from some further assumption that the percipient is a "primary substance" which is an experiencing sub- ject only in virtue of the sense qualia which qualify it. In fact it was this assumption of a "soul" (it makes no difference whether Hume explicitly denied the assumption), or an "ego" (in Des- cartes' words), as a primary substance which "knows" only in virtue of its private perceptions, that made Hume's principle so precise and clear. Now it should not be supposed that the thesis that all of imme- diate experience can adequately be analyzed solely in terms of determinate qualia, necessarily presupposes a plurality of "private minds," or a dualism, or an "ego," or "subject" in distinction to an "object," or an " external world," etc. (though some such no- tion is generally brought in the back door). But once having made the assumption that one and only one generality holds over im- mediacy, viz., the thesis under question, and so concluded that all that rational creatures have to play with is this wealth of qualia, philosophy should withdraw from the field of ontology, and not make pretensions about " mind, " "matter, " " causality, " " external world," "subject," "object," "God," "freedom," etc. The rest of the inquiry must deal solely with the specificity of the data, the accidental manifold of experience, class subsumptions of the qualia, relations, repetitions, patterns, etc. We have now reduced our- selves to the "value of a variable." Actually, of course, even we positivists at this point can not avoid, in order to save some frag- ment of science and logic, introducing into immediacy an "impres- sion of repetition," and hence some disguised form of "memory." But with this flagrant violation of our fundamental assumption, that qualia exhaust immediacy, the "subject," as the basis of this immanence of the past in the present, makes its appearance; for no simple stream of qualia could give rise to an impression of repeti- tion. There must be something, some primary substance, which this stream qualifies; and which, by an equally mysterious "reten- tion" of qualia (though "faint copies"), introduces into imme- diacy the impression, or awareness, of the repetition of qualia. Apart from this, the notion of "memory" is a subterfuge. But what then gives rise to this qualification of the subject by</page><page sequence="5">WHITEHEAD'S DOCTRINE OF CAUSAL EPFICACY 89 the qualia, and why should certain sequential patterns repeat themselves? At this point we happily reclaim the "object" and thus the world by allowing common sense a second conspicuous violation of our fundamental principle, viz., the introduction into immediacy of the element of "perceptual acceptance," animal faith, primitive credulity, etc. Now, the proponents of this element, e.g., Price, Santayana, Lewis, etc., would probably deny that this element has in it any element of givenness, that is, that it is a deliverance of experience, or an element of immediacy. Supposedly, it is simply a subjective reaction to the data, or qualia, of immediacy. But this is a sub- terfuge in words. The precise tool which Price so elegantly used against the causal theory of perception can in turn be used against these proponents of "subjective reaction," including Price's own notion of "percep- tual acceptance." Price's objection against the causal hypothesis to account for our objective reference was, briefly, that it was no hypothesis at all, but simply a conclusion.2 That is, we do refer our datum to an external object, and so conclude that it is caused; but the point for discussion is, Why do we refer our datum? What we want is an hypothesis that, when we confront experience with it, will explain why we make the common-sense reference we do, i.e., that will disclose those "compulsive elements" of immediacy. Whereas the causal theory is simply a conclusion from the obvious fact that we do make the reference. It accepts our common sense; it does not, as it should, account for common sense. Now, the subjective reaction or perceptual acceptance theory is no less a conclusion rather than an explanatory generalization. We do refer our datum, and so conclude that we automatically make a perceptual acceptance; the conclusion that there is "sub- jective reaction," or "animal faith" is undeniable. But why is there perceptual acceptance? Why does this subjective reaction take the form of objective reference, and what element of immedi- acy provokes this reaction? To answer that the qualia provoke it, is no answer at all, but simply an irrational appeal to the mysterious ways of a subject, which in turn we have no basis (on our Humian assumptions) for believing. But even granting the subject, the theory of perceptual acceptance is not a generalization from the data of immediacy, but is rather a conclusion made about the subject from observing its animal habits. It does not explain common sense or its habits by an appeal to the data of experience, that is, of immediacy. 2 H. H. Price, Perception, p. 91.</page><page sequence="6">90 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY If this is as far as empiricism can go, I see no sin in acquiescing in a mystery. Certainly common sense does "perceptually accept" and "subjectively react"; and certainly on the Humian assump- tion that immediate experience is nothing more than qualia, we can have no insight into the nature of the qualified subject. Price's conclusion amounts to saying that, by the very nature of things, there can never be given any reason for why we act as we do. There can never be an hypothesis that will disclose those elements in immediate,experience which cause us to react (or "accept" or "refer") as we do; because there just aren't any such elements. And you don't embarrass the theory by asking what then causes the reaction; it is a secret of the subject which even the subject doesn't know. The conclusion to this discussion is, for those who fancy that the office of philosophy is to resolve mysteries, that there is necessarily a further element in immediacy that accounts for the subjective reaction, and thus the Humian analysis of immediacy is too ab- stract and elementary. The thesis being advanced here is that any philosophical generalization that can account only for the qualita- tive differentiae, or sense qualia, in immediacy, is inadequate as an analysis of immediacy. And to insist that there can be no imme- diate experience other than qualitative differentiae on the basis of some such philosophical system (e.g., a body-mind, or primary sub- stance-object, or subject-external world, system), is to beg the question, and preclude any adequate analysis of experience out of deference to the comforts of a familiar and traditional dogma. Humian scepticism is based upon an insidious dogmatism. Now, it seems possible to say that every particular perceptior by a particular percipient through a particular duration of partic. ular data must display, however complex, a perfectly determinatE qualitative pattern which it is possible to conceive (though it be be- yond the mnemonic and temporal limitations of any individual) as analyzable in terms of determinate qualia. But to say that ex- perience exemplifies the qualia, or that the qualia can be abstracted from the perceptual event, is not the same as saying that the total content of immediacy can be adequately analyzed in terms of those qualia. That is, it is one thing to abstract the determinate qualia from the experiential event, and quite another thing to attempt to construct the experiential event out of simply the determinate qualia. And by "experiential event" we mean simply that which was experienced. It is a complete mistake to ask, How can a con- crete event be built-up out of universals? The only philosophical question is how the universals come to be abstracted from the con- crete event. Equally, the question for any analysis of perception is,</page><page sequence="7">WHITEHEAD'S DOCTRINE OF CAUSAL EPFICACY 91 How, in the experiential event, are there displayed and abstracted determinate qualia and impressions of sensations? And how shall we describe the surd of experience not caught in this net of abstrac- tion? I suspect that it will take a very fancy ontology to answer this inquiry; but that when it is at all adequately formulated, we shall find ourselves also in possession of an answer to the why of perceptual acceptance, or subjective reaction, as well as to the enigmas of memory, causation, anticipation, etc. But this ontology, or philosophical generalization, will be no less "empirical" than Hume's principle and the postulate of a subject as the basis of memory, the "impression of repetition." It will equally be testable by its adequacy in explaining the content of immediacy. We shall expect it to account for the nature and genesis of memory, for sensation, perceptual acceptance, dreams, mnemonic overtones, esthetic feelings, imagination, consciousness, etc. The Humian doctrine and its complementary doctrine of the percipient as a primary substance, have been necessarily reticent concerning such an account. In fact, on Humian assumptions, we must remain in blank ignorance as to the genesis of these elements. To deny the adequacy of the Humian sensationalism is thus to throw a monkey-wrench into the traditional knower-known ma- chinery. The notion of a "mind" entertaining private impressions of sensation is simply a derivative abstraction, and is inadequate as an expression of the concrete experience. Perception can no longer be conceived as an epiphenomenon that somehow mysteri- ously supervenes upon certain physiological excitements. The con- cept of a primary substance as a subject qualified by some sense data, is too abstract to be significant in any adequate analysis of immediacy. The belief that we know precisely what composes our immediate experience is a trick of our philosophical presuppositions that sel- dom make explicit appearance within specific theories. The further belief that we can clarify these notions apart from reference to any philosophical system or to these presuppositions as to the general nature of things, is simply a delusion. I can not even speak about "perception" unless I have some vague notion of a percipient and a perceived. And I can not speak about the nature of that percep- tion without making my "vague notion" more precise. Every question as to the nature of immediacy, unlike the mere inventory and classification of specific data, leads me beyond itself. Contemporary discussions of perception, for the most part, en- tertain a very parsimonious and simple ontology, consisting basi- cally of a subject qualified by its private sense qualia, and of an object with the "power" (in Locke's sense) of, in some unknowable</page><page sequence="8">92 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY fashion, occasioning those qualia. Any researches of science into the nature of the object, or of Nature, are irrelevant to this relation between object and subject, because the subject, or "mind," is made of ethereal stuff. There is no natural or causal relation (spatio-temporal continuity) between mind and matter (and though there may be a one-one correlation of specific physiological. excitements with specific qualia, the how of this correlation is inexplicable). If, however, the determinate qualia, or qualitative aspects of immediacy, be considered as abstractions from the full content of experience, it is apparent that our ontology will have to be more complex. The notion of a mere "subject," and a mere "object," is too abstract. We mean by a "mere subject" something that is actual, or that is an experiencing being, only in virtue of specific complexes of entertained subjective sense data, or qualia, capable of recognition if repeated. But to deny the adequacy of the "mere subject," or "mind," in explaining immediate experience, is to deny the ontological valid- ity of mind-matter philosophy. Such a philosophy, like Newtonian mechanics, will be applicable within limitations, but simply false if it is proposed as a thesis adequate in handling all the details of experience. Here is Whitehead 's ground for a revolt against dualism. It is not a revolt against the subject-object structure of nature, or the mental-physical, but rather against the traditional failure in sufficiently analyzing that structure. In accordance with the conclusions of the special sciences, Whitehead proposes that we consider the phases of human experi- ence as specific natural events. This means that generalities ap- plicable to all natural events, such as lower organic, and even in- organic, events, must also be applicable to human experience; otherwise it means nothing to say that human experience falls within Nature: . . .any doctrine which refuses to place human experience outside nature, must find in descriptions of human experience factors which also enter into descriptions of less specialized natural occurrences. If there be no such factors, then the doctrine of human experience as a fact within nature is mere bluff, founded upon vague phrases whose sole merit is a comforting familiarity. We should either admit dualism, at least as a provisional doctrine, or we should point out the identical elements connecting human experience with physical science.3 This does not mean that psychological phenomena supervene upon, or are occasioned by, certain physiological excitements, or natural events. It is not a behavioristic psychology. It means, 3 Whitehead, Adventures of Ideas, p. 237.</page><page sequence="9">WHITEHEAD'S DOCTRINE OF CAUSAL EFFICACY 93 rather, that the psychological phenomena are equally natural events; otherwise we have neither escaped the mind-body dilemma, nor made human experience a "fact within nature." It means that a full-blooded, natural event becomes, so to speak, self-con- scious. And as far as the immediacy of that experiential event is concerned, the specific qualitative pattern it exemplifies, or, con- versely, the determinate qualia experienced, are subsidiary to the vivid feeling of action, of derivation, of transition and causation present in the concrete experiential event. In consideration solely of the qualia of that experience, a criterion which heretofore has defined subjectivity, and which has thus resulted in the bifurca- tion of nature into "mind" and "matter," we necessarily abstract from the full content of immediacy. To say that such a considera- tion is not an abstraction is baseless; and in the light of the qualia's inadequacy in providing a sufficient basis for the explanation of subjective reaction, memory, etc., there are the best possible grounds for pursuing the hypothesis that it is an abstraction. Those who can not divorce themselves from the substance-quality interpretation of the knower-known relation will, of course, find it impossible to discover anything but determinate qualia in their experience. Apart from a coherent ontology, the awareness of what we have loosely called "the vivid feeling of action, of derivation, of transi- tion and causation," can not be formulated in any very precise terms. But we may use here Whitehead's generic phrase, "causal efficacy," somewhat as we have used the word "qualia" as generic relative to every manner of qualitative differentia. Causal efficacy is fundamental in the sense that it is the organism's awareness of its own derivation, sustenance, and mutual becoming and relation- ship with the other events of its environment-it is the awareness of itself as an efficacious fact within nature-; but the nature of that fact and the qualitative character of the environment are, of course, not disclosed in the mode of causal efficacy. The very fact that there are events and that there is an environment are later questions; they emerge, as every infant must know, in the inter- pretation of experience. But the point is, that this element of causal feeling within immediate experience can not itself be "dis- closed" (or interpreted) apart from some generalization involving the notion of nature and the percipient and his experience as re- stricted natural events within that matrix. The neat simplicity of presupposing only a substantial "mind" (whether it be a stream, or a solipsismal present) is out in any proper analysis of experi- ence. And with this requisite of perceptual analysis we cut the frail roots of Humian scepticism and Berkeleyan idealism. Ex-</page><page sequence="10">94 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY perience is the final court of appeal, and there is more evidence than a scepticism based upon a "qualia-interpretation" will allow. Of course, no one has ever taken a radical scepticism seriously; but a blind deference to the substance-quality dogma has made it im- possible, by an appeal to immediate experience, to explain just why that is so. Let us consider the nature of "causal efficacy" more carefully. At the outset it should be said that, since causal efficacy is not in any fashion a determinate quale, the notions of "repetition," or "recognizability," or "uniqueness," as definitive of a sense quale, are simply inapplicable to it. That is, at no time within my experi- ence can I say, " Oho! here is an instance of causal efficacy," unless, of course, I am speaking of myself as an experiencing being, i.e., of the whole manifold of my consciousness. For my experience is itself an instance of causal efficacy, just as it is an instance of vari- ous congeries of qualia; and in virtue of the fact that all experi- ences are natural events, my experience could not possibly be apart from causal efficacy. Now, of course, I may abstract from the qualia of my experience and so attempt to turn my attention upon the element of causal feeling, and in this sense may be said to "recognize" it, and become aware of its "uniqueness." But here again a distinction must be made between the accidental manifold of experience and immediacy. Now there are certainly "instances" of immediacy. And limit- ing "immediacy" to conscious experience, it is conceivable that I should awaken in the morning and say, "Oho! here is an instance of immediacy!" I may also distinguish various elements in that occasion of consciousness, e.g., impressions of sensations, impres- sions of reflections, impressions of repetition, unity of apperception, memory,-and causal awareness. In fact, the elucidation of the content of immediacy is a primary task of philosophy. Further, it is conceivable (though highly improbable as a fact) that in some future epoch the universe should exhibit another experimental event identical with that which will constitute my own awakening in the morning, an event having the same data, the same subjective enter- tainment of those data, the same mnemonic overtones, the same de- velopment, and the same outcome. There is nothing unthinkable about the repetition of any natural event, though in all its details it be impossible as a matter of fact. In this sense, every experi- ential event is recognizable, unique, and repeatable. But this is quite a different thing from the criterion of a quale. A quale is an "instance" falling within any occasion of experi- ence; its repetition and uniqueness is a property relative to the accidental manifold of experience. The qualia must be repeatable</page><page sequence="11">WHITEHEAD'S DOCTRINE OF CAUSAL EFFICACY 95 within experience; whereas the repetition of causal efficacy is simply an instance of experience. A quale is an instance repeat- able within an instance of immediacy. The repetition of a quale is an instance of a specific experience, e.g., the awareness of a shade of red, or a definite shape, or specific sound. But that specificity is non-essential to the nature of experience qua experience, i.e., of im- mediacy: it may not be. The only thing that can be repeated within experience is some specific quale (or qualia). This is an- other way of saying that the qualia are the locus of induction: they stand as the requisites of a class concept, for the notion of a class is drawn from experience in virtue of the fact that there are qualia repeated within experience. Equally, the qualia are the locus of denotation, and hence of modern so-called " meaning analysis." You just don't denote an unspecified impression of sensation. No more do you denote subjectivity or causal efficacy. But to exclude subjectivity, the "ego," causal efficacy, etc., simply because they can not be found among the objects, the denoted and projected qualia, of experience, is nonsensical. The doctrine of causal efficacy amounts to saying that in every specific instance of experience there is a content which is not ex- hausted by a description of the qualitative differentiae in virtue of which that instance is repeatable. Thus the word "content" is not here limited to the subsumable, or possibly subsumable. And for this reason to ask, What do I experience? and then, having ex- hausted classification and subsumption, to conclude that any notion of causal efficacy is nonsense because it can not be found in this "what," is to beg the question by again confusing the "what" of the accidental manifold of experience with the "what" of imme- diacy. And to limit the content of immediacy to the qualia is to reduce subjectivity to the realm of universality, and hence, as Hume saw so clearly, to preclude any rational epistemology (where rational means an explanation of our scientific beliefs and common- sense habits by an appeal in terms of ouir philosophy to the data of immediacy). The difficulty attaching to any generalization of immediacy is that, contrary to purely logical and classificatory inductive methods (if any such method could be "pure"), we must make some definite ontological commitments. Hume's often praised clarity, simplic- ity, and precision may be credited to the simplicity, clarity, and universal acceptance of the ontology within which he wrote his Treatise. Whitehead's contention is that that ontology has proved itself too simple to be an adequate matrix from which true proposi- tions applicable to every element of our experience can be framed. Certainly no concept of causal efficacy (not to mention memory)</page><page sequence="12">96 THE JOURNAL OP PHILOSOPHY can be justified within that scheme. Thus to deny Humian psy- chology and ontology is to demand the construction of a novel scheme of ideas in terms of which some propositions applicable to our experience may be framed. Such a scheme will be tentative and hypothetical, valid only in so far as it serves to integrate our knowledge and account for the complexities of experience. But the important point is, that there are no a priori grounds forbid- ding such a speculative venture. The wealth of experience and immediacy cries out for proper analysis. Whitehead's thesis that any instance of experience falls within nature, whether it be something willed, felt, thought, or remem- bered, and thus that these subjective phenomena are equally ex- plicable in terms of generic notions applicable to all other natural phenomena, has found little favor in modern eyes. The spatial limitations of this paper, of course, prevent any extensive treat- ment of those generalities which Whitehead proposes as a more adequate schema by which to interpret experience, for such a treat- ment would entail no less than a complete exposition of the Philos- ophy of Organism. However, a quotation from Process and Reality may be given which is pertinent to our discussion, and which will as well suggest one of the philosophical considerations which par- tially directed the formulation of that philosophy: All metaphysical theories which admit a disjunction between the component elements of individual experience on the one hand and on the other hand the component elements of the external world, must inevitably run into difficulties over the truth and falsehood of propositions, and over the grounds for judg- ment. The former difficulty is metaphysical, the latter epistemological.... The consideration of experiential togetherness [between the competent elements of individual experience] raises the final metaphysical question: whether there is any other meaning of "togetherness." The denial of any alternative meaning, that is to say, of any meaning not abstracted from the experiential meaning [my italics] is the doctrine of the philosophy of organism. The contrary doctrine, that there is a "togetherness" not derivative from experiential togetherness, leads to the disjunction of the components of sub- jective experience from the community of the external world. This disjunction creates the insurmountable difficulty for epistemology. For intuitive judgment is concerned with togetherness in experience, and there is no bridge between togetherness in experience, and togetherness of the non-experiential sort [my italies].4 The analogue in traditional philosophy for Whitehead's word "togetherness'" is, quite obviously, "causal connectedness." But what is generally called "causal relation " in modern physical science is what Whitehead here calls a meaning "abstracted from the experiential meaning." Obviously in those "lower" categories of Nature where we are wont to locate the "inorganic," the "ex- 4 Whitehead, Process and Beality, p. 288.</page><page sequence="13">WHITEHEAD 'S DOCTRINE OF CAUSAL EFFICACY 97 periential togetherness" is simply a re-enaction and conformation to the past; and the generalities governing such types of together- ness will take the appearance of inviolable causal laws, and rightly give rise to some notion of "mechanism" and "determinism." In "higher" categories (viz., among the organic) the conformation and re-enaction may not be complete and hence not fully predict- able, and the generalities governing this experiential togetherness will probably take the form of statistical laws. The ideal is to find those generalities which hold over every type of togetherness. The reason for these remarks is to parry those ill-placed crit- icisms that discourage the study of Whitehead by falsely anthropo- morphizing his doctrine of "experiential togetherness." The no- tion that Whitehead has cooked-up a contemporary "animism" is adolescent nonsense. He has rather attempted to account for those natural orders which we call "animate," as well as for those we call "inanimate," by an appeal to more generic principles than either of these. The difficulty besetting any venture in the broader generalities is the choice of terms free from too special connotations and yet sufficiently suggestive. I think it is unfortunate that Whitehead has to use here the phraseology "experiential" together- ness; but I know of no better phrase. The meaning of the word "'experience" seems to have entrenched itself in most philosophers' minds as necessarily connoting some element of consciousness. For example, the wealth of internal activities in our own bodies, of un- conscious reactions, the intricate transmission of blood, nutrition, and the causal and purposive complex interrelations of nerves, glands, and receptors, of which for the most part we are consciously oblivious, except for a vague emotional tone of well- or ill-being, are not often looked upon as instances of experience. Whereas for Whitehead these are all perfectly good examples of relatively com- plex forms of "experiential togetherness." There are good justifi- cations of this latter view, viz., that our own clear-cut conscious experience is very sporadic and vague, fading off into a penumbral background, and yet one lit up occasionally by consciousness, such as in severe sickness or abnormal stimulation; also all the data of physiology and psychology point to the fact that our conscious or "mental" states are dependent upon these subsidiary functionings and integrations of "feelings"- 'feeling processes," that is, of which we are not conscious. Again, practically all the phenomena with which we associate the experience of conscious organic beings, e.g., the reaction to stimuli, willful and purposive efforts, expres- sion, etc., are equally noted in the case of the sleeping and uncon- scious. There seems to be no need to restrict our word "experi- ence " to the area of consciousness.</page><page sequence="14">98 THE JOURNAL OP PHILOSOPHY In the Philosophy of Organism Whitehead employs the word "prehension" as a neutral term to cover what we have been calling "experiential togetherness." By its very affinity to the word "apprehension," "prehension" forbids any necessary implications of consciousness, and is further extended to cover facts of together- ness as remote as an intuitive judgment and the transmission of energy quanta among electrons. The word "togetherness" is a generic term, and becomes scientifically and cosmologically signifi- cant only when we stipulate some specific type of togetherness. There is a togetherness between molecules, or between a plant and the sunlight, or between an organism and its nutrient, or between the percipient and the perceived. The task of philosophy is to formulate those generalities which are exemplified in every case of natural togetherness, whereas the task of science is to trace the patterns-causal patterns-of specific types of togetherness. The point from which the Philosophy of Organism begins is that all types of togetherness may be characterized as types of experiential togetherness. But this doctrine should not further be construed as reading the very highly complex and sophisticated togetherness of human experience, or even lesser animals' experiences, into those lower and relatively vulgar events of plant life and the inorganic. But it does suggest that there will be traces in human experience, in virtue of those more primitive cells and events from which it has originated and which it embodies, of reactions and adaptations to the environment which characterize less specialized events of na- ture.5 Thus it is to be expected that, in the generalization from our own immediate experience, we shall throw some light upon those conditions of less specialized events of nature. Thus the "problem of efficient causation and of knowledge receives a common explanation by reference to the texture" of immediacy. But the point is, that the perceptual event, which is a together- ness of percipient and perceived, is to be conceived as an "experi- ential togetherness." When we speak of a "percipient," it is usually implied that somewhere in this experiential event the to- 5 Thoughtless philosophers have accused Whitehead of anthropomorphism. Anthropomorphism is the reading of the experience of higher organisms, that is, that element of their experience in virtue of which they lay claim to being "higher" organisms, into lower organisms, and not the attempt to disclose the survival of elements of the lower in the higher in virtue of the fact that the latter originated from and embodies the former. The only serious question is, whether, when human experience flowers into eonsciousness and sense dis- crimination and intellection, these more vulgar and primitive types of feelings and reactions can equally suffer analysis-or perhaps can even be elicited into consciousness.</page><page sequence="15">WIITEHEAD'S DOCTRINE OF CAUSAL EFFICACY 99 getherness flowers into consciousness. So far as we know, this special form of togetherness takes place, and then intermittently, only upon very complex chains of reaction and integration within a highly developed, animal body. The even more sophisticated species of experience involving memory, sense data, and perception, is of lesser scope; and cognition, ill-defined as it is, is apparently the gift only of man. But the thesis that the only element of this togetherness which enters into our consciousness is some determi- nate qualitative pattern which supervenes upon the event, and so gives birth to "mind," is absolutely baseless. There is no reason for, and every reason for not, thus bifurcating physiology and psychology. In any mind-body dualism there are necessarily two species of causation, or "togetherness." The first is that which holds be- tween the components of the external world; and the second is that which holds between the external world and the components of the percipient mind. Respecting the former, some credence has been given the view that certain sequential repetitions of sensibilia are its only basis. This view has been necessarily followed by the be- lief that we have absolutely no insight into the nature of causation. Respecting the latter, i.e., the togetherness between the percipient and the perceived, or mind and its object, there have been in the past numerous verbalisms, e.g., interaction, pre-established har- mony, psycho-physical parallelism, etc. In recent times, modest philosophers have proposed more scientific-sounding phrases, such as "a one-one correlation between certain physiological excitements and our psychological phenomena." There has further been an attempt to cover the mystery by saying, for example, that our see- ing of a color is caused by light rays causing certain physiological disturbances on the retina, which are in turn carried along certain dendrites to the optic nerve, and from thence to the brain, etc. In a sense we have just as much insight into this cause as into that holding between components of the external world, e.g., between the physiological components. But notwithstanding the absence of any philosophical justification, there is a widespread opinion that the mode of causality between objects is fundamentally differ- ent from that between an object and subject; that is, that the to- getherness of the parts of the body in a physiological train of events leading up to perception is not the same as the togetherness of the mind and body in that perceptual act. In the former to- getherness there is a type of spatio-temporal continuity between the components, and a dependence of the subsequent for its full nature and existence upon the antecedent. Whereas in the latter togetherness there can be no such continuity, and the physiological</page><page sequence="16">100 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY excitement is nonessential to the nature of the mind: it is simply the occasion for this specific perception. Hume 's observation holds, that the impressions of sensation arise in the soul originally from unknown causes. Now all this mystery and false modesty surrounding causality can be dispersed by the simple acknowledgment that the perceptual act is itself a natural event. The perceptual event may or may not involve consciousness, and that in varying degrees. But the im- portant point is that, with every other type of natural togetherness, or causal connectedness, the perception is a species of experiential togetherness. It agrees with the mind-body dualism doctrine that the togetherness between the components of the external world is different from that between the external world and the percipient, but only specifically different: generically they are both natural events explicable in terms of the generalities governing "nature." Nature thus takes on a peculiar complexity; the togetherness of "mind and body" in perception falls within nature as a species of events, but so will cognition. Actually the notion "mind" is an abstraction based upon the various qualia given rise to in this very special type of event called consciousness. In this sense, as Aristotle recognized, subjectivity runs beyond the mere "intel- lect, " which is only a capacity of the rational species, and, at best, flickers within his waking hours. And this remaining surd of immediacy provides the basis for our appeal to experience to jus- tify our notion of causality, or of memory, or anticipation and pur- pose, or of an environment, and of "substance." The mutual sharing of character of our immediacy with all other events of nature, coupled with the fact that we have at our disposal the accidental manifold of experience, makes it possible, by an intro- spection, analysis, and generalization, of our own experience, to approach a rational interpretation of the complexities of all natural occurrences. The novelty of these Whiteheadian assumptions con- sists, roughly, in construing human experience as a very special species of natural events, and every natural event as a species of experiential events. The traditional mind, matter, and causality become derivative abstractions, applicable within limitations but false if taken as ultimate. HUGH RODNEY KING OXFORD, ENGLAND</page></plain_text>
