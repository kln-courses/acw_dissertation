<plain_text><page sequence="1">OBOTUNDE IJIMERE, THE PHANTOM OF NIGERIAN THEATER Oyekan Owomoyela W9le Soyinka in his recent Myth, Literature and the African World (1976) attempts to divest himself of the reputation that some of his earlier pronounce- ments' have earned him as a denier of the existence of a distinctive Africanity, and to shake off the foreign sympathizers who have unfairly, he claims, exploited those early positions to bolster their racist denial of an "African world." His intention in this book is to demonstrate his belief in the "African world," to show how it is "self-apprehended" by the true African, and to "call attention to it in living works of the imagination, placing them in the context of primal systems of apprehension of the race" (ibid.: xi-xii). The first illustration he uses for this "apprehension of the race" is "The Imprisonment of Obatala," a play by Obotunde Ijimere (1966). This choice is startling and baffling because Obotunde Ijimere is actually Ulli Beier, a German who was actively involved with Nigerian and especially Yoruba culture from 1950 until 1967. First Soyinka's use of the play to illustrate the Yoruba world-view will be summarized. The myth of Obitlai (the creator arch-divinity) is that while he was engaged in the creative task entrusted to him by the Supreme Deity, Ol16dUimare, he became thirsty and drank some palm wine to slake his thirst. Unfortunately the effect of the wine put him to sleep. The Supreme Deity, observing the cessation in the creative process, sent OddiduwA (the ancestor of the Yoruba) to complete the task. Odiiduwai did and, before ObiAtil woke up, he installed himself on the throne as the ruler of the people. Obkt6l did not forgive Od'iduwa for supplanting him. Therefore, both he and his progency engaged Odihduwa and his progeny in a long contest aimed at regaining the ascendency (see Idowu, 1963: 71 ff; Adedeji, 1972). The annual observance of Obitald's festival at Ede includes a mock battle recreating an aspect of Obtill's contest with Odilduwa, and in which the former is captured, incarcerated, and later released after the payment of a ransom (Beier, 1956; Rotimi, 1968). In "The Imprisonment of Obatala," the divinity is represented as having created albinos, dwarfs, and other misfits as a result of his inebriation.2 Much later, de- siring to pay his friend Shango a visit, he consults a diviner and learns that he will undergo some indignities on the journey and must suffer them with stoical patience because they will be the necessary penance for his drunken mistakes. Several indignities duly befall him along the way, the most serious being his arrest by AFRICAN STUDIES REVIEW, no. XXII, no. 1, April 1979 43</page><page sequence="2">44 AFRICAN STUDIES REVIEW Shango's servants who accuse him of attempting to steal Shango's favorite horse. When he is brought to his friend's presence, not even old friendship nor the demands of hospitality deter Shango from throwing him in jail. Because Obitail is the creator "who turns blood into children," however, his incarceration results in the arrest of the creative process. In the meantime, Ogun, the violent divinity "who turns children into blood," plagues the earth with wars until Obattila is released. Soyinka contrasts this play to the Brazilian Zora Zeljan's "The Story of Oxala: The Feast of Bomfin" which deals with the same myth but with some differences in details (?oyinka, 1976: 16 ff). In Zeljan's play the inebriation of Oxala (Obkt1la) is not mentioned. Rather, in his creative task, he fashions a son (Omolu) for his wife (Nana Buruku) and, because the son's destiny is to cure people, makes him ugly and sick so that he will be sympathetic to his charges. When the second time around he gives his wife Exu, a child in whom neither good nor evil predominates, Nana Buruku flees and takes refuge with Xango (SIngo). Oxala's trip, therefore, is for the purpose of retrieving his wife. Along the way, he is mistaken for a horse thief by Xango's servants, and Xango, not realizing who the accused is, send him to jail. Ijimere's play, according to ?oyinka, is profoundly Yoruba because the divinities are shown to have the failings of earthbound mortals, whereas Zeljan's play demon- strates the manner in which Christian syncretism has divested the deities of their anthropomorphic qualities in favor of pristine holiness and infallibility. In Zeljan's play, Oxala's creation of deformities is deliberate, moral, and far-sighted; the injured parties are other divinities; and Xango is ignorant of his prisoner's identity. For these reasons Oxala can suffer his incarceration with righteous equanimity. Ijimere's handling of the theme shows the Yoruba's better insight because, accord- ing to Soyinka, "the penalties which societies exact from their deities for real or symbolic injuries are an index of the extent to which the principles of natural restitution for social disharmony may be said to govern the moral structure of that society [sic] and influence its laws" (ibid.: 14-15) [emphasis is in the original] . Thus, unlike Zeljan, Ijimere shuns all opportunities to rationalize the misbe- havior of his divinities, and the wine-loving Obatala is denied the grace of serenity in jail: "since he is conscious of his own causative infraction, his situation must be one of guilt-laden spiritual dejection" (ibid.: 23). Even the language of Ijimere's play is offered as an example of the author's "self-apprehension" of the Yoruba world. When Shango sees Obitila dragged before him as a horse thief he exclaims: What madness to steal a horse he cannot ride He would have shook him off Even quicker than the frustrated wife Got rid of her limp husband Who lacked the tool To make her bleed and sweat (ibid.: 24-25). Says ,oyinka, "The Yoruba gods in the Brazilian version do not sweat or copulate." Rather, the divinities are enveloped in a "transcendentalist essence, the commence- ment of the attenuation of terrestrialism" (ibid.: 24). Soyinka is not alone in having cited Ijimere as an authentic interpreter of the Yoruba world-view. Joel Adedeji, an historian of Yoruba theatre and the head of the drama department of the University of Ibadan, does so in his article, "The Literature of the Yoruba Opera" (1973). He cites Ijimere's "Eda" ("Everyman" in Ijimere, 1966) saying "there are two versions of the play. The first written by one</page><page sequence="3">OBOTUNDA IJIMERE 45 Obotunde Ijimere (1966). An adaptation of Hugo von Hofmanthal's Everyman, according to Ulli Beier in his introduction to the published text, Ijimere's play has been rethought to fit into the Yoruba concept of man and his destiny. The second version is by Duro Ladipo (1970)" (Adedeji, 1973: 65-66).3 Adrian Roscoe (1972) is another writer who has had something to say about Ijimere. In his discussion of "The Imprisonment of Obatala," Ijimere's handling of the Yoruba world is favorably compared to Duro Ladipo's. According to Roscoe, Ijimere is able "to present a full picture of the Yoruba cosmology; to present a complete picture, where others, Ladipo for example, have provided only glimpses and fragments" (ibid.: 193). Like Soyinka, Roscoe concludes that Ijimere's gods are authentically Yoruba and "more like human beings;... more warmly human" than Ladipo's (ibid.: 192). Finally, he says that in the play, "There is an overall impression of a complete Yoruba reading of the universe . . . an order that can be detected and explained" (ibid.: 199).4 Since his debut on the Nigerian theatrical scene, however, Ijimere has been attended by enough contradictions and inconsistencies to arouse the suspicion of serious scholars about the authenticity of his name and biography. Yoruba scholars especially would immediately recognize the name 6b6tuinde as meaning "monkey has returned" (the other possibility, Ob6tfinde, is so vulgar I doubt even Beier could have intended it), and ijimere as the name for Pataguenon monkeys. With the exception of Edun (Colobus monkey), which the twin-loving Yoruba associate with twins, monkeys in general are regarded with ridicule. Furthermore, the photographed face of the playwright on the back of his first book (1966) could hardly have convinced anyone familiar with Nigerian physiognomies that Obotunde Ijimere was a Yoruba, though obviously a Nigerian. The blurb that accompanied the photograph itself contained biographical curiosities and inconsistencies that should have bemused even those scholars un- familiar with Yoruba naming practices or facial features. Ijimere, it said, was born in 1930 in Qtan Aiyegbaju, a Yoruba town. After leaving secondary school (high school), he joined Duro Ladipg's Yoruba Opera group at nearby Oshogbo as an actor, a career he soon gave up for lack of talent. Then he joined Ulli Beier's extra- mural workshop where Beier persuaded him to write in English rather than in Yoruba. The blurb concluded with the information that Ijimere had written other plays besides the ones in the volume for Theatre Express, a Lagos-based theater group. The biographical information in Beier's introduction largely repeated the facts on the cover except for a significant contradiction. Ijimere, it said, "had been interested in writing for a long time and had tried his hand with English short stories in the extra-mural writer's workshop in Oshogbo. At the time, his tutor's advice to write in his native Yoruba tongue did not seem to click with him. But then the experience of Oba Koso [Ladipg, 1964 and 1968] suggested a new medium to him." He then began to write for Ladipo's company which had per- formed "Eda," one of Ijimere's plays, "with great success, not only in Nigeria but also in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and Belgium." The point to note is that, in the blurb, Beier reportedly persuaded a reluctant Ijimere to write in English rather than in Yoruba, and, because he took Beier's advice, his plays had been performed (in English) by a Lagos based group called Theatre Express. In the Introduction, Beier reportedly persuaded a reluctant Iji- mere to give up his attempts to write in English (presumably because he was in- competent in the language he thought was his only chance of literary or dramatic success) until Ladipg's success with the Yoruba "Oba Koso" convinced him. He</page><page sequence="4">46 AFRICAN STUDIES REVIEW then turned to writing successful Yoruba plays for Ladipo. The plays in the volume, we were told, had been translated and "adapted" into English by Beier. Some other details Beier supplied about Ijimere prove troublesome. He joined Ladipo's group on leaving secondary school and since we know that Ladipo did not form a performing group until 1962, Ijimere would then have been 32 years old, a fantastic age to leave secondary school! Further, if indeed he had just left secon- dary school, what we know of the socio-economic expectations and pretensions of secondary-school graduates in Nigeria in 1962 would make it both unreasonable and unlikely that he should have joined Ladipg's group which was essentially and mainly illiterate. Beier further stated of the sources of the three plays in the volume that the first, "The Imprisonment of Obatala," was likely inspired "by Susanne Wenger's repeated handling of the myth on her batiks and screen prints";5 that the second, "Everyman," (Ijimere's "Eda"), was an adaptation of Hugo von Hofmanthal's "Everyman." "The basic theme has been retained, but the entire play has been rethought [emphasis in original] entirely in Yoruba." The third, "Woyengi," was based on an Ijaw tale told by Gabriel Okara in a recent issue of Black Orpheus, a magazine edited by Ulli Beier. The plays proved very popular in high academic circles and internationally. A first performance of "Obatala," we are told, was being attempted in Berlin by an international student group; "Woyengi" was first performed as a dance drama by students of the University of Ibadan Drama De- partment, while "Eda" had "already been performed by Ladipq with great success not only in Nigeria but also in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Belgium." Obviously, Ijimere's sources were sophisticated and catholic and his plays attracted prestigious national and international performances. Theatre Express, the Lagos group which performed several of his plays, comprised men who had earned fame as members of earlier theater companies like Players of the Dawn and Wole Soyinka's 1960 Masks, and who occupied prestigious positions in the com- munity. Segun Sofqw9tj was the editor of a weekly magazine, Akin Euba was a lecturer in Musicology in the Institute of African Studies at the University of Lagos, and Segun Olusola was the Controller of Programmes for the television arm of the Nigerian Broadcasting Corporation (Theatre Express, n.d.). Finally, it should be mentioned that when, in 1967, Theatre Express gave a performance at the Museum of Antiquities in Lagos to mark the Fourth Common- wealth Conference, they were sponsored by the Federal Society of Arts &amp; Humani- ties and the Unesco National Commission for Nigeria. The three plays performed included "The Suitcase," Ijimere's adaptation (in English) of the play by Sebastian Salazar Bondi, and "Conversation at Night," Beier's translation of Friedrich Durren- matt's play. Moreover, the playbill for the occasion carried an introductory essay on the group, and the essay was signed "Obotunde Ijimere"! When he next appeared in print with "Born With the Fire on his Head" (Beier, 1967), the only new information in his brief biographical note was, "Obotunde Ijimere is the pen-name of the author." Having failed to include that information in the earlier book, Beier here again neglected to make the one really meaningful disclosure about the author in the circumstance-his nationality. He had, however, left enough clues in his wake to lead any alert investigator to the conclusion that Ijimere and Beier were the same person. For example, it was significant that the only source for all information about Ijimere was Ulli Beier. Also significant was the fact that since he supposedly joined Ulli Beier and Duro Ladipo at Oshogbo in the 1960s he had always and exclusively operated in tandem with Ulli Beier. Fur-</page><page sequence="5">OBOTUNDE IJIMERE 47 thermore, it is known that Beier, while the editor of Black Orpheus and the lecturer in charge of the Extra Mural Department of the University of Ibadan, was pro- lifically active in publishing articles on Nigerian cultural phenomena and festivals. These include the already cited "Obatala Festival." Apart from midwifing the birth of Duro Ladipo's career, he also for a long time virtually presided over the nurtur- ing of Nigerian artistic expression in all the notable artists in the country together at Ibadan in 1961. It is fair to say that few people, Nigerian or not, have had the impact and influence on Nigerian creativity that he has. Other clues to Ijimere's identity could be found in the texts attributed to him and those attributed to others but edited by Ulli Beier. As an example, the Mbari publication of Ladipo's Three Yoruba Plays (1964), rather freely adapted into English by Beier, contains this praise to Sing'o by his townspeople: You think the worm is dancing, -but that is merely the way it walks. You think Sango is fighting you, -but that is merely the way he is (ibid.: 13). In Ijimere's "Obatala" the praise is repeated exactly by Oya, Shango's wife: You think the worm is dancing, But that is merely the way it walks. You think Shango is fighting you, But that is merely the way he is (1966: 23-24). The explanation is not that this in an authentic and immutable praise to Sang6 that both playwrights have adopted. Duro Ladipo's original in "Qba K6 So" is: The worm the worm makes the dance a thing of joy (1968: 7).6 In other words, as the worm shows his joy by dancing so the chanters dance be- cause Sing6's presence fills them with joy. Beier, presumably having difficulties in grasping the intention of the line, made up his own verse to incorporate the in- scrutability of the divinity. In light of the foregoing, the conclusion was obvious that the confusion and contradictions in the published accounts of Ijimere's career resulted from Beier's slipshod and ad hoc attempts to create a biography for his cover, a cover that changed according to what Beier was doing at the moment, and one that enabled him to become a Yoruba and create Yoruba works himself rather than by proxy. This conclusion was published in my dissertation (1970) after it had been confirmed in interviews with both Duro Ladipo and Susanne Wenger. Ulli Beier by then had left Nigeria for New Guinea and was not easily available for interviews. Since 1970 there have been other mentions in print of Ijimere's true identity (Jahn et al., 1972; Owomoyela, 1974).7 Literary scholars nevertheless persist in purveying the myth authored by Ulli Beier (see, for example, Herdeck, 1973), and even Yoruba scholars continue to cite him as an exemplary interpreter of innate Africanity. There are obvious important ethical and academic reasons why the facts about Ijimere must be made widely known. One very important reason is because Beier-Ijimere's representation of the Yoruba ethos is too often distorted and slanderous. In one instance, Beier's adaptation of Duro Ladipo's concepts demon- strates a tendency towards the risqu- which is quite absent from Ladipo's work. In Ladipo's original (1968) the praise singer, fwirjfai, says in reference to Sangd, Giant sacrifice, too much for the vulture to carry! The first morsel which goes straight to the bottom [of the stomach] ! The leopard's gaze, which frightens the hunter! (ibid.: 2-3).</page><page sequence="6">48 AFRICAN STUDIES REVIEW In Beier's adaptation it becomes: You are a huge sacrifice, too heavy for the vulture, He staggers under your weight. You are a bigger morsel than any of us can chew! If anyone tries to swallow you - You come out of his anus at once. The leopard is merely taking his rest - Yet the hunter is afraid! (1964: 7) More serious than the interjection of the anus is the mischievous intrusion of sexuality into Gbo'onki~'s incantation in which he argues his case for favor from the witches. In Ladipq's original Gb nkiaa uses the standard Yoruba proverbs: One should never be envious of the blue touraco with its dye, One should never be envious of the ilu'kB bird with its purple, And one should never be envious of the parrot with its red tail feathers (1968: 72-73). In his English adaptation Beier substitutes another set of two Yoruba proverbs that are always used together: Nobody will kill a dog because it barks. Nobody will kill a ram because it butts. He cannot, however, resist a gratuitous addition: Nobody will kill a he-goat because it makes Love to his mother (1964: 22) Duro Ladipo is a most proper and discreet dramatist unlikely to include gratuitous vulgarity and sexuality into his operas which are performed before dignitaries and assorted mixed groups! In "Obatala" by Ijimere we see the sexuality become so obsessive as to make it startling that anyone who pretends a knowledge of Yoruba etiquette and ethos would cite him as a reliable exponent of Yoruba world-view. A few examples of this will suffice. When Obatala expresses his longing to see his friend, Shango, he thinks of the elasped time since they met and says: For the tenth year now, the earth has been pregnant With the sperm of heaven (1966: 4). The diviner who foretells his misfortune refers to Obatala's drunken mistakes as follows: The hunter aimed at the white patch Round the antelope's cunt. But the antelope said: Zeeeeeeduuuu - And the antelope escaped (ibid.: 8) And the praise to Obatala is rendered as: Obatala who turns blood into children, You who makes nose and eyes, You who makes penis and vagina (ibid.: 10) When Obatala is brought as a horse thief to Shango's presence, Shango exclaims: Have you become greedy for cowries and brass Like the he-goat on heat trying to mount his mother? Are you lusting for silver and parrot's feather Like the wild pig whose long rubbery nose Twists and sniffs about the undergrowth Following the slimy cunt of his mate? (ibid.: 22-23)</page><page sequence="7">OBOTUNDE IJIMERE 49 Finally, when Oya pleads with her husband to reconsider his decision to throw Obatala in jail, she tries to remind him of the hospitable feast Obatala gave them when they visited him: The hunter brought the long-horned antelope Its body hanging limp from his shoulder. Its tail had fallen loosely aside Exposing the cold vagina, and its thin legs The calabashes were buzzing with palm wine And the white fermenting foam Slowly crept down their sides Like the male seed, gently backflowing Down a woman's thigh (ibid.: 25-26). Contrary to what the foregoing might suggest, the Yoruba do not regard sex with lewd and vulgar flippancy. In the Yoruba scheme of things the female sexual organ inspires respect and awe because it is the mysterious and sacred means of procreation. Any Yoruba who refers to it in disrespectful, contemptuous terms, as in the foregoing examples, is engaged in damnable sacrilege. Also, the male seed carries the germs of progeny that is so elementally important for the continuity of the race. The idea that palmwine foam wasting down the sides of a calabash would be compared to the male seed wasting down a woman's thighs-and that by a woman!-is a violent rupturing of the tribal soul! Ulli Beier demonstrably hid behind a nom de plume to give vent to his own sexual fixation which so impresses Wole Soyinka that in his enthusiasm he sees it as an evidence of racial "self-apprehension" instead of the reprehensible slander that it is. Ulli Beier as himself or behind his mask is clearly not a reliable exponent of the African world, however much he might have been assimilated into Yoruba life. The point is not that it is impossible for a German to "go native" in Africa. The point, rather, is that in this case the author's real identity differs so much from the mask as to render invalid the cultural uses to which he is being put. In any case, the reading public needs to be alerted to this gargantuan masquerading so that it can better evaluate the works of Obotunde Ijimere. NOTES 1.His off-hand dismissal of the nigritude movement with the tigritude analogy is now almost a cliche. In Una Maclean's "Soyinka's International Drama" (1964) his impatience with those who identify him as an "African dramatist" rather than simply as a dramatist, is reported. In "And After the Narcissist?" (1966) he argues against the preoccupation by the African artist with the cultural self, a preoccupation he sees as narcissism. 2.According to the worshipful praise (oriki) customarily addressed to the divinity the creation of the deformed is a demonstration and an exercise of his unbridled freedom to create as he chooses. This point is made by Idowu (1963) who cites the praise: He who makes eyes, makes nose: It is the 6Oris [divinity] I will serve; He who creates as he chooses: It is the Orisa I will serve; He who sends me here: It is the 0ri'si I will serve (ibid.: 72). The version that the misbegotten result from Obitial's inebriation is less charitable, and parallels the explanation that (5gdn, the fiery, warlike divinity, once in a drunken fit mas- sacred his own people. Such an action might be consistent with (gdn's nature; but Obttill's reputation for responsibility and purity make one suspect that the imputation of drunken- ness to him is no more than an irreverent rationalization of deformities.</page><page sequence="8">50 AFRICAN STUDIES REVIEW 3.Actually, a comparison of Ijimere's "Everyman" with Ladipo's "Eda" (NCR. 5, IAS. 9) shows that "Everyman" is an English adaptation a la Ulli Beier of Duro Ladipo's work. The two are identical in all essential details. 4.It is significant that Roscoe consistently writes Ijimere's first name as Obatunde (instead of Obotunde) a respectable Yoruba name that means "the king has returned." Roscoe or his proofreader probably assumed that Obotunde was a typesetter's mistake. 5.Susanne Wenger came to Nigeria in 1950 as Ulli Beier's wife. An accomplished artist, she was responsible for the development of the famous Oshogbo school of expressionistic art. Her batiks are world famous, much of the themes being taken from Yoruba mythology. She has taken up permanent residence at Oshogbo where she is a priestess of Osun, the river divinity. 6.The original Yoruba in the text is: Kbkbrr, kbkbri fij6 say o! 7.Jahn and Dressler (1971) in their Bibliography had treated Ijimere and Beier as two different people without any indication that there might be more than a professional connection between the two. 8.
