"This book is not meant to be a scientific treatise," writes Bernd Heinrich in the preface of his mesmer- izing volume, One man's owl. The book certainly doesn't read like a scientific treatise, which may be more an indictment of stylistic constraints imposed on the tech- nical literature than on the genre represented by Hein- rich's second foray into "popular" science. This book reads like a thriller, presenting not only an enormous amount of scientific information, but doing so in a manner that captures the personal wonder that lures people into the sciences in the first place. One man's owl is a personal account of the author's 3-year relationship with one of North America's most impressive predators, a Great Horned Owl (Bubo vir- ginianus). The relationship began by accident. One March, shortly after arriving at his field site, Camp Kaflunk, Vermont, Heinrich succumbed to what E. O. Wilson has aptly termed an attack of "biophilia" and rescued a nestling owlet from premature burial in a snowdrift. Fully aware that rescuing the "soggy, sorry- looking bundle of misery" was against State and Fed- eral laws, Heinrich, a consummate student of hyme- nopteran foraging behavior, rationalized that a study of the ontogeny of owl hunting behavior would justify "saving this owlet in the eyes of the law." What follows is a thoughtful, thought-provoking, sometimes comic description of owl development and the ingenious ways by which an incorrigible experi- mentalist investigates that development. Although pre- sented in journal form, the daily accounts are frequent- ly enriched with information gleaned from the primary literature. Sources are faithfully acknowledged and cit- ed in the text, making One man's owl a good basic introduction to the literature on owl behavior and ecol- ogy. Nonetheless, however faithful to his sources, Hein- rich is surely more fun to read than most primary literature. Simply put, this man can write. Take, for example, Heinrich's account of owl bathing behavior: July 3 It is raining. After a long rain Bubo usually sits qui- etly, pulling his wings tightly against his body like an overcoat. But today, despite the rain, he perches out in the open, fluffs out his feathers and opens his wings wide and shakes them while hopping excitedly. He is either doing a fair rendition of a rain dance, or he is taking a shower (p. 73). The author's wit and affection frequently color his accounts of Bubo's development as a predator. They do not, however, infuse the book with naive anthro- pomorphism or maudlin sentimentality. Heinrich is aware that the attribution of human characteristics to animals has often and justly caused "dreadful outrage" in scientific circles, and is perfectly conscious of com- mitting the occasional anthropomorphism in his deal- ings with Bubo. Thus, when he writes that a caged Bubo "is no joy at all ... [but] reminds me of a starving prisoner shackled by the ankles" (p. 34), Heinrich ad- mits that "It is very likely that I am projecting my own feelings" (p. 34). Heinrich does not, however, allow his own feelings to interfere with the accuracy of behavioral description, even when the temptation to do so must have been enormous. For instance, after spending his first winter at a raptor rehabilitation center, Bubo was pronounced "incorrigible," deemed unsuitable for reintroduction to the wild and returned to Heinrich. The animal that was sent back to Heinrich behaved very differently from the animal that Heinrich delivered to the reha- bilitation center. However, the author resisted the temptation to describe Bubo as catatonic or miserable. Instead, he described behavior: [Bubo] perches immobile in the darkest corner, and his huge pale-yellow eyes are always open.... He looks like a beautiful owl, all right-a stuffed owl. He acts lifeless.... His gaze shifts blankly into the distance... (p. 103). Despite the bird's apparent lack of interest in live prey, Heinrich was successful in rekindling its interest in hunting. The way in which he did so, introducing live prey repeatedly into the owl's cage, one mouse here, one there, is typical of the author's ingenious and experimental approach to the study of behavior. The book and the author/animal relationship are full of imaginative experiments. Clearly, Heinrich is the kind of person Vincent Dethier had in mind when he</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 525 wrote in To know afly, that children who pull the wings off flies either "come to a bad end or become scien- tists." Heinrich doesn't pull wings offflies-at least not in this book-but he does pull the wool over Bubo's eyes. For instance, in a series of experiments in which Heinrich explored Bubo's criteria for deciding what made a desirable prey item, the author offered the owl a raw clam: He takes the slimy mollusk reluctantly, then holds it immobile in his bill, as if wondering what to do next. Eventually he swallows it. So far so good. I offer him a second one. This one he refuses. He learns quickly-too quickly to suit me. Maybe I can fool him. [I wrap clams] in cat fur--now that's more like it. More roughage. Bubo gulps several furry clams with gusto. Apparently he is more concerned with texture than with taste (p. 63). Just as the texture of the fur-covered clams attracted Bubo, so too should the texture of this volume attract the attention of all students of ornithology-profes- sional and amateur alike. Nontechnical in the sense that it does not recount a rigorously quantitative in- vestigation of the ontogeny of behavior, it is nonethe- less carefully scientific. The ideas, experiments and questions presented are worth anyone's time. This vol- ume stands as the epitome of what "popular" science should be and should do much to remove such efforts from what Sarah Blaffer Hrdy once sadly referred to as the not very respectable "demi-monde" of popular science writing. There is nothing demi- or semirespect- able about this volume. It is entirely respectable; I liked One man's owl. I liked it a lot. -MARCY F.
