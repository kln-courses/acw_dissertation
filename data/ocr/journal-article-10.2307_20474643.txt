The Horse in the City: Living Machines in the Nineteenth Century. By Clay McShane and Joel A. Tarr. (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2007. Pp. xi, 242. $50.00.) Historically, cities have harbored dense concentrations of animals as well as people. Even today, we urban-dwelling bipeds are out numbered by a menagerie of rats, mice, cats, dogs, squirrels, and pigeons. In the nineteenth century, we shared our urban spaces with larger species, as pigs roamed the streets and cows grazed in vacant lots. Most important of all, as authors Clay McShane and Joel Tarr show in this fascinating study, were the cityscape's equine laborers. Horses not only populated the city but shaped its economy and built environment. Although nineteenth-century industrialization introduced numer ous labor-saving devices, it did not make horses obsolete. Quite the contrary. As McShane and Tarr observe, "Humans could not have built nor lived in the giant, wealth-generating metropoles that emerged in that century without horses. Horses, too, benefited from the new human ecology. Their populations boomed, and the urban</page><page sequence="2">366 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY horse, although probably working harder than his rural counterpart, was undoubtedly better fed, better housed, and protected from cru elty.... Thus, the relationship was symbiotic" (p. i). Though written with a light touch that will engage general readers, the book is based on unusually rich scholarship. McShane and Tarr draw quirky details from veterinary guides, ASPCA files, and trade journals devoted to livery stables and urban transit, as well as the more familiar municipal records and newspaper articles. Underlying the text is the authors' deep knowledge, gained through decades of research and publication, of urban transportation, technological systems, and environmental issues. Trotting briskly through the horse's various roles in urban life be fore trolleys and automobiles claimed the right-of-way, the text un derscores the far-reaching effects of horse-drawn freight delivery and mass transportation. Street railroads pulled by horses not only en couraged the sprawl of residential neighborhoods but also enabled the expansion of commercial leisure by helping working-class people travel to amusement parks and resort destinations. As horse popu lations rose into the tens of thousands in the major cities, stables took up more urban space. Some of these stables, particularly those operated by street-railway companies, were enormous facilities that housed hundreds of horses. Rising horse populations had to be sustained by increased inputs of human capital and labor. The blacksmiths and farriers who treated equine ailments were supplemented by a new, primarily urban-based veterinary profession. The numbers of teamsters, hostlers, and stable keepers more than tripled between 1870 and 1890. A vast national and international trade in horses developed. Out in the hinterland, horses' dietary requirements caused tremen dous changes in agriculture. Hay production soared in the late nine teenth century, largely because of urban demand. By 1909, more than half of New England's farmland was given over to hay cultiva tion, while hay-pressing machinery made it profitable to transport hay far beyond its county of origin. In return, cities exported manure to the countryside. Throughout their monograph, McShane and Tarr emphasize the use of horses as "living machines." This theme, suggested in the course of the press's manuscript review process, might have been better developed if it had guided the research project from its incep tion, for the authors do not fully explore how the idea of the living machine interacted with a persistent anthropomorphism. Of course</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 367 they recognize the tension between these conflicting mentalities, for example, by observing how the ASPCA extended humane sympathy to horses and yet also shot thousands of nags whose profitability had diminished due to age or injury. It would have been interesting to learn more about the thoughts of ASPCA leaders on the conditions justifying euthanasia or about street railway officials' dissonant lan guage on the subject of cruelty. Were Americans growing disinclined to recognize humankind's kinship with horses? The argument that horses were "increasingly viewed ... as property or living machines" (p. 2) might suggest that they were, but human labor was sometimes viewed similarly. Like horses, African American slaves were regarded as both unique in dividuals and interchangeable units of productive power, as Walter Johnson has demonstrated in Soul by Soul: Life Inside the Antebel lum Slave Market (1999). Through interstate trade networks, millions of slaves were bought and sold as commodities with standard grades of quality. (Many practices of the horse trade mirrored those of the slave trade.) Though humans ceased to be property after 1865, their treatment as machines intensified under the regime of "scientifically managed" industrial labor promoted by Frederick Taylor and others. Yet McShane and Tarr merely acknowledge, in a few scattered pages, this mechanistic view of human work. Further analysis of the "living machine" idea might have better illuminated the relationship of humans to animals, but The Horse in the City is nonetheless an outstanding study of a neglected topic. It forces us to rethink the city as, to some extent, a place created by and for a species other than our own.</page></plain_text>
