Life Sci., 28 (2006), 175-190 The Beer/Bethe/Uexkùll Paper (1899) and Misinterpretations Surrounding 'Vitalistic Behaviorism' Florian Mildenberger Institute for the History of Medicine Lessingstrasse 2 80336 Munich, Germany Abstract - In the history of behaviorism the paper of the three physiologists Theodor Beer, Albrecht Bethe and Jakob von Uexkull from 1899 plays an important rôle. Many researchers were influenced by this paper and identified it as fundamental for objective psychological research. But during the period of its adoption (1900-1925) psychologists did not notice that Beer, Bethe and Uexkull had distanced themselves from their own paper, because it had been ignored in physiological and biological discussions. Moreover, one of the three (Beer) had to resign from the scientific community because of private scandai and another one (Uexkiill) changed ail of his views and left the base of objective science for sub jective vitalism. However, this did not change his adoption of behaviorism. Keywords - Vitalism, Behaviorism, Uexkiill, Stazione Zoologica, Darwinism The history of the behavioral sciences is often inseparably tied to the search for predecessors of more contemporary research from a wide array of branches of science. As early as 1967, Ernest Dzendolet identified the Baltic German biologist Jakob von Uexkull (1864-1944), today perceived solely as a protagonist of neo-vitalism, as an early antecedent of behaviorism (Dzendolet 1967). Dzendolet was unable to explain how a biologist, who is best known historically for his anti-mechanistic and anti-Darwinian théo ries, could advance ideas leading to mechanistic psychology, or behavior ism. Modem interpreters of the life and work of Uexkull consider him to be one of the founders of bio-semiotics (Sebeok 2001). His philosophy is interpreted as a last gasp to construct a non-Darwinian biology (Kull 1999). Along with Uexkiill, Dzendolet also mentioned the names of Theodor Beer (1866-1918) and Albrecht Bethe (1872-1954), without explaining the back ground of their rôles in the early history of behaviorism. The complété fail ure of the hypotheses formulated by Beer, Bethe, and Uexkull has gone unnoticed, perhaps because in this case questions would have arisen as to why behaviorists laying the foundations of their own theoretical models adopted the rejected ideas of discredited biologists and physiologists. © 2006 Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn</page><page sequence="2">176 MILDENBERGER FLORIAN Therefore, it is necessary first to analyze how the three protagonists arrivecl at their joint position paper in 1899, then to examine the con tent and significance of the paper in its period and, finally, to examine the reasons for its failure. Thus, the proto-behaviorism notions that Dzendolet emphasized are almost self-explanatory; nevertheless, it seems necessary to follow the course of discussions among the commu nity of behaviorists. Finally, it must also be asked how and why Uexkull and his two allies abandoned the scientific circles they had occupied for many years and what new paths they adopted instead. The actual protagonist of the debate is Jakob von Uexkiill. He not only started researching the reflex theory (Uexkiill 1894a, 1894b) earli er than his two colleagues, but he also trained at least Albrecht Bethe, and probably even Theodor Beer, in the investigation of sea animais at the German Zoological Station in Naples (Bethe 1940, 821). Uexkiill himself had studied zoology at the University of Dorpat and had corne to Naples for the first time in 1891. At this time, he had changed posi tions from a wholehearted proponent of the Darwinian theory to one of being a cautious critic (Uexkiill 1936, 126). In Dorpat, Natural Philosophy was completely dominated by représentatives of the old vitalism (Karl Ernst von Baer, Gustav Teichmûller), while the radical Darwinist Julius von Kennel dominated zoology. Thus, Uexkiill was exposed to a thorough introduction to and discussion of the many debates surrounding biology and philosophy. Lacking a career prospect in science, Uexkiill left his Baltic home land, which was awash with peasants' uprisings, pan-Slavic efforts at Russification, and nationalistic witchhunts. In the next few years, he alternated doing research in Heidelberg with Wilhelm Kiihne (1837 1900) and in Naples. In 1896, after investigations of sea fauna (sea urchins), he ultimately arrived at the opinion that the self-activating nerve responses present in them stood in the way of a purely mechanis tic interprétation of animal behavior (Uexkiill 1896a, 9). For the first tiine, Uexkiill had to concédé that muscle reactions proceeded differ ently, in accordance with the kind of burden they experienced, thus sug gesting there could be independent movement centers within an organ ism (Uexkiill 1896b, 315). This re-orientation must be seen in the con text of the research of Hans Driesch (1867-1941), who studied sea urchins in Naples at the same time as Uexkiill, and who illuminated supra-mechanical processes in cell division, which he used to réfuté the mechanistic theory in favor of a neo-vitalist one. Also in 1896, despite his discoveries, Driesch made another attempt to tie to an overarching mechanistic concept, but was greatly hindered in this quest by mecha nistically oriented Darwinians (Driesch 1896). Uexkiill's companions,</page><page sequence="3">VITALISTIC BEHAVIORISM? 177 Albrecht Bethe and Theodor Beer, too moved on the razor's edge of dis covery and were in constant danger of being excluded from the dis course for vitalist reasons. Bethe was a physiologist and hoped to be able to test his theories on higher animais (Bethe 1898a), while Beer con ducted experiments and worked on the philosophical underpinnings of his research (Beer 1899 1903). Common to ail three was their relative financial independence, although Beer was the wealthiest by far. When he was not doing research in Naples, he supervised the construction of his magnificent 'Villa Karma' in Montreux. At this time, biological research lacked a unified catalogue of terms. Researchers understood very différent things by the terms 'instinct' and 'behavior' (Kôck 1993). Consequently, a unified methodology was need ed, and Uexkiill, Beer, and Bethe were convinced that, because of their many years of experimental experience, they were in a position to work out such a détermination of terms. Bethe, in particular, had personally experienced its necessity when, expanding his studies of sea animais to bees and ants, he encountered résistance from other researchers and, in the course of the discussion with them, found that they could not even agree on the same terminology. So, Bethe rejected every anthropomor phic interprétation of animal behavior and, putting a fine point on it, declared that animais could be interpreted as 'reflex automats'. He soon came into conflict with the 'bee Father' and Jesuit, Erich Wasmann (Wasmann 1898). Wasmann, like the Swiss psychiatrist August Forel and the British zoologist John Lubbock, had for years studied the life of ants and bees (Forel 1907; Lubbock [1881] 1929). Here Wasmann used terminology from human life to explain things in the animal kingdom. For example, the various patterns of behavior exhibited by a colony of ants toward animais outside the colony, he categorized as 'hospitality' and sought the 'animal soûl'. This aroused the objection of Bethe, who was still convinced that animal behavior could be interpreted mecha nistically, as long as one used only objective language. Because he did not just doubt the 'purposefulness' of animal behavior, but even raised it to the principle of observation (Bethe 1898b, 26), his critics immedi ately identified him as a vitalist. For this reason, August Forel and Hugo von Buttel-Reepen cast doubt on the scientific character of Bethe's work, even though Bethe used mechanistic arguments (Buttel-Reepen 1900). When Bethe protested against accusations that he was unscien tific, his antagonists did not respond (Bethe 1902; Wasmann 1902). Instead, they accused him of 'deficient philosophical knowledge' (Wasmann 1900, 350). But there may also have been a misunderstand ing about the use of the term 'purpose', because just at this time the botanist Johannes Reinke published a book in which he suggested pur</page><page sequence="4">178 MILDENBERGER FLORIAN poseful activity to be a part of causal activity, thus integrating vitalistic ideas in a mechanistic construct (Reinke 1899, 69). Reinke contradicted the biological consensus dating from the récep tion of Darwin to the rediscovery of Mendel's laws. Rather than an 'order of nature', the leading researchers assumed an aimless 'natural selection'. Convinced Darwinians/Mechanists could not accept a re interpretation of their own views to allow for a theory of purposeful activity. Bethe and his supporter Uexkull were thus practically pushed into a corner labeled 'hostile to science', from which they could liberate themselves only by instrumentalizing the accusations directed toward them (Helbach 1989, 125). Under massive pressure, Uexkull defended his friend Bethe by disputing the possibility of pure causal thinking in animal psychology (Uexkull 1900, 498), thus attacking Forel. At the same time, he noted his work had not supported the notion of animal soul, hoping 'Wasmann does not hold it against us that we have uncer emoniously thrown out this old trash.' (Uexkull 1900, 502) The dispute made clear to Uexkull and his colleagues of the need to set up their own methodology, one that would have a chance of convincing even their sci entific opponents (Beer, Bethe, Uexkull 1899). In retrospect, Bethe called this a 'three-man-manifesto' that last ingly influenced discussions at the Stazione Zoologica (Bethe 1940, 821). To be able to avoid conclusions from analogy, which frequently do not apply, the authors recommended strictly separating the objec tive stimulation, the physiological process, and possible feelings (Beer, Bethe, Uexkull 1899, 517). Récognition of the 'objective stim ulation' moved into the center of their analysis. To this end, Uexkiill even built his own apparatus, which he presented at the physiologists' conférence in Bern in 1899 (Uexkiill 1899, 292). With his mechanical reconstruction, Uexkiill followed in the footsteps of Hermann von Helmholtz (Chadarevian 1993) and showed himself to be a Cartesian mechanist in the mold of Jacques Loeb (Warden 1933, 55). In accor dance with the principles of the 'three-man manifesto', objective traits (ability to hear, see, etc.) were then to be attributed to the psy chology of individual subjects, rather than the species. In this way, psychology and sensory physiology could be reconnected and, indi rectly, the protagonists of the earlier debates (Ernst Haeckel and Wilhelm Roux) could be overcome and surpassed. To ensure this, ail subjectively-tinted expressions were to be extirpated from the objec tive sphere of stimulation (Beer, Bethe, Uexkiill 1899, 518). The three authors thus recommended introducing a number of new, purely objec tive specialized terms. Reactions that always recurred in the same way were to be called 'reflex', modifiable 'Riickbeugung' was 'Antiklise', and</page><page sequence="5">VITALISTIC BEHAVIORISM? 179 'Ruckbewegung', 'Antikinese' (antikinesis) (Beer, Bethe, Uexkiill 1899, 519). Similarly, the various receptor organs in research subjects were classified in accordance with what they reacted to: light waves, chemical stimulus, warmth, or sound waves (Beer, Bethe, Uexkûll 1899, 521). This nomenclature was promptly printed in Centralblatt fur Physiologie and in Zoologischer Anzeiger (Uexkiill, Beer, Bethe 1899a, 1899b), which expressed the physiologists' interest in bringing their studies together with biology. But résistance rapidly grew in physiology. For example, Willibald Nagel, a private lecturer who taught in Freiburg im Breisgau, argued that the new nomenclature ignored the 'spatial character' of animais (Nagel 1899, 283). Beer, Bethe, and Uexkûll's model avoided anthropo morphic viewpoints like those of Helmholtz, but there were substantial gaps in relation to the spectrum of animal organisms (Nagel 1899, 281). Heinrich E. Ziegler, a zoologist interested in animal-psychology issues, approved especially of those aspects of the Beer/Bethe/Uexkull model that attended to the individual rôle of subjects (Ziegler 1900, 2; Haberlandt 1905, 447). Wasmann, who disagreed with Bethe, rejected his antagonist's explications entirely, saying that they 'overburdened research with petty formalities' and had no practical value (Wasmann 1900, 347). This nomenclature enjoyed a certain popularity in physiology for a few years, but it did not ultimately prevail. Richard Semon accurately described the situation in the German-speaking world when he wrote to Forel in 1909: 'Regarding Uexkûll: ... I think the whole Beer-Bethe Uexkûll humbug is already in the process of sinking into oblivion' (Walser 1968, 400). There were a number of reasons why Uexkûll and his two allies did not prevail. The first and most important was probably Uexkûll's over confidence. Shortly after the nomenclature was published, he went on a research expédition to Africa, instead of promoting himself and his methodology. He journeyed via Port Said to German East Africa, hop ing to confirm his earlier physiological studies with examples of animais in other geographical zones.1 He remained on the coast until the end of January 1900 before going on a safari, and not returning to Heidelberg until October.2 Then he permitted himself a quip to annoy biology's Darwinian faction, which often argued in terms of racial theories: 'The charming, carefree character of the Swaheli and Masai will bring joy to everyone who does not share the prejudice of the uneducated classes 1 Uexkiill to Dohrn, Oct. 18, 1899; Nov. 16,1899.

Back in Heidelberg, Uexkiill not only learned of the death of his men tor Wilhelm Kiihne, but also had to acknowledge Bethe's admission of mistakes in his scientific argumentation. Bethe had to concédé that his mechanistic ideas of the life of bees and ants, which had led to the coin ing of the new nomenclature, did not fit the facts (Forel 1903). This led Bethe fundamentally to doubt the validity of the mechanistic doctrine he himself had propounded, and he then spoke of an 'unknown force' that influenced the bees in their flight (Frisch 1965, 477). Bethe's réfu tation undercut the practical example upon which the Beer/Bethe/Uexkull nomenclature was ideologically based. It would not be until the late 1930s before a zoologist - once again after doing research in Naples - dared to propose a similar objectivistic methodol ogy (Thore 1938). After this preliminary failure, Uexkùll's réputation was on the line at the Stazione Zoologica. Thus, and contrary to earlier hints from Anton Dohrn, he was not appointed the successor of Karl Schônlein (1842 1899), the head of the physiological department, whose suicide created a vacancy. Nevertheless, a not always hostile discussion continued on the 'three-man manifesto'. Ail the participants in the debate agreed with Uexkiill that a unified nomenclature was urgently needed, especially if the controversies in biology, which were additionally fueled by the mechanist/vitalist quarrel, were to be examined in a unified and con trolled manner. But the errors in the data of Bethe's papers and Forel's harsh criticism were hard on Uexkùll's nerves. For at the same time, Uexkùll could watch Driesch independently shed the fetters of the mechanistic approach, becoming the chief proponent of a new vitalism that questioned every purely objectivistic-mechanistic nomenclature (Driesch 1899). Uexkùll thus wrote an essay in the fall of 1902. In it, he finally abandoned the purely mechanistic interprétation (Uexkùll 1902). In contrast to what he had said a few years earlier, he now considered the search for an 'animal soûl' to be possible, on the one hand, and, on the other, he rejected a psychology that wanted to prove 'the loss of spé cifie psychic factors after the destruction of specific régions of the brain' (Uexkùll 1902, 214). With this, he alluded specifically to the reflexolog ical animal experiments at the Stazione Zoologica in which he had taken part for years. Thus, he rejected the mechanistic theory according to which the 'animal soûl' functions solely as an instrument for conveying nerve impulses (Weber 2003, 85). Instead of mechanical theories and pure metaphysical spéculation, Uexkùll underscored that one could</page><page sequence="7">VITALISTIC BEHAVIORISM? 181 grasp only that for which one possessed a correct 'notion'. The relations between an T and objects were purely individual. With this reversion to Kant, Uexkûll turned to purely subjective psychology, even if this was a rather peculiar interprétation of Kant (Uexkûll 1902, 218; Cramer 1987). He also followed a trend introduced by Driesch to instrumental - ize Kant and his philosophy and to interpret them purely vitalistically; in the previous decades the adherents of Helmholtz had interpreted Kant mechanistically (Braeunig 1907, 55; Wahsner 1988, 4). The research trio finally broke up for good in 1903 when Beer, who had meanwhile advanced to become an associate professor at the University of Vienna, was sentenced to prison in a dubious trial for allegedly seducing underage boys. In a letter to Anton Dohrn, an embit tered Beer wrote in April 1904: Perhaps rumors that I was slandered in Vienna as a contrary-sexual and as a ped erast have reached as far as Naples in your unique, marvelous station, for which I now yearn as if for a lost paradise. I do not have to explain at length to you, the much-experienced man of the world and scholar, that believing nothing is the beginning of knowledge: Not a word is true of the accusations spread by a Viennese attorney of low Jewish caste who is intensely hostile to me.3 After Beer's légal appeal failed in court, his pregnant 22-year-old wife committed suicide in March 1906. Subsequently, Beer lost ail his aca démie titles and was no longer part of scientific discussions (Brunner &amp; Sulzenbacher 1998, 53). Uexkûll, Beer, and Bethe could no longer even profit from the disso lution of the coalition directed against them, consisting of Buttel Reepen, Forel, and Wasmann. Forel attacked Wasmann in 1905, reject ing his philosophical statements by branding them as dualistic 'Scholastic Sophism' (Forel 1905 , 522). Then Bethe turned to purely physiological issues and Uexkûll was left alone on 'biological battle field'. But after his devastating defeat, he became convinced that mech anistic teaching was nonsense and began to construct his own vitalistic theory. He consequently assumed the possibility of drawing an analogy from animais to humans, applying the knowledge he had gained from sea urchins to people. For him, the principle of purposefulness, in con trast to Darwin's blind natural processes, stood as paramount. It became clear to him that science seemed to indicate that nature was 'experience ordered by plan' (Uexkûll 1905, V). Uexkûll also hinted at the dangers he saw for research in Germany if experimental biology continued to be 3 Beer to Dohrn, Apr. 10, 1904. ASZN: A.1904.B.</page><page sequence="8">182 MILDENBERGER FLORIAN neglected: 'One need not be a prophet to déclaré that in only a few years biology will be an American science' (Uexkiill 1905, VII). Like Wasmann, he still used anthropomorphic terms, but he made it clear that here he was still trying to find a unique terminology. The elements of animal physique that had inadéquate désignations ('reflex republics') were to be in the center of future observations. In this way, expérimen tal biology could study and interpret the behavior of animais in their 'milieu' (Uexkiill 1905, 125). This reorientation in the theory of science did not proceed without tensions among him and other vitalists who continued to view Uexkiill as a reflexologist; in other words, his transformation to a vitalist lacked credibility. For example, the zoologist Karl Camillo Schneider, who taught in Vienna, still wrote in 1908 about the 'three-man manifesto': 'If we wanted to grant spécial weight to the account of UEXKULL, then they [the experimental animais, F.M.] would have nothing at ail but reflex es.' (Schneider 1909, 70) Occasionally, Uexkiill's investigations of tonus were even used to combat neo-vitalism (Kohnstamm 1907, 318). Uexkiill's companion Otto Cohnheim from the Stazione Zoologica also continued to see his colleague solely as a reflex physiologist (Cohnheim 1911). The physiologist Rudolf Magnus, who joined Uexkiill after 1900, also continued until his death to refer to Uexkiill's reflex-physiological oeuvre (Liljestrand 1929, 651; Magnus 1902; 1914). But abroad in par ticular, Uexkiill's transformation to a vitalist was not noticed at ail. Thus, only now, and without any acknowledgement of the events around the 'three-man manifesto' and the researchers who took part in it, did Uexkùll see his pre-1900 works attain a certain acceptance. They were soon treated as antecedents of the ideas of a behaviorist psychology (Dzendolet 1967, 256). The psychologist Margaret Floy Washburn ini tiated the claim in 1908 and, a few years later, Charles M. Diserens fol lowed (Washburn 1908/1936, 17; Diserens 1925, 126). Additionally, Jacques Loeb, who had moved to the US, saw him as an ally in the mechanistic struggle for existence (Loeb [1912] 1964, 70). To eliminate this suspicion and at the same time to be able to position himself as an interpreter of natural processes equal to Driesch, Uexkùll compiled his experiments with sea animais, tied them to theoretical considérations and, in 1919 formulated out of this the teaching of the 'Environment and Inner Life of Animais' (Uexkùll 1909; Glaser 1910). The term 'envi ronment' replaced the term 'milieu', used until then but then increas ingly ignored because biological research on inheritance had concen trât ed on the effect of genes. At the same time, Uexkùll tried to distance himself from the tumul tuous discussions of the 'scientific nature' of biology. For him, a 'sci</page><page sequence="9">VITALISTIC BEHAVIORISM? 183 entific truth' was merely the 'error of tomorrow'. Instead of allowing himself to be drawn into these disputes, he preferred to search for 'functional units' in the living processes (Uexkiill 1909, 4-8). Reverting to the rediscovery of Mendel's laws, he accentuated the value of the 'protoplasm', which August Weismann had emphasized, and which Uexkiill considered as evidence for the purposefulness of life (Uexkiill 1909, 12). Nature and individual aptitude seemed iden tical, just as in Kant's philosophy (Zanetti 1995, 59). As contemporary allies in the English-speaking world, he explicitly named the American biologist Herbert Spencer Jennings (1868-1947) (Uexkiill 1909, 24), whom Driesch also accepted as the discoverer of an 'ani mal behavior' (Driesch 1925, 281). Jennings, however, considered his work to be purely objective research on the basis of reflex-physiolog ical views that harmonized with the 'three-man manifesto' (Jennings 1906, 234). Jennings even feared that deviating from this line would mean slipping into vitalism (Jennings 1910, 363, 394, 440). Consequently, he rejected any reinterpretation of Uexkull's early studies, and he wrote an essay in which, instead, he tried to adduce Uexkull's work as support for his own mechanistic studies (Jennings 1909). Other English-language researchers probably saw this as con firmation of their own view of Uexkiill as a représentative of mecha nistic ideas. But even in Germany he continued to be seen as such, for example by Hugo v. Buttel-Reepen and Eugen Steinach (Buttel Reepen 1909, 304; Steinach 1901, 27). Neverthless, Uexkiill continued to try to position himself as a vitalist, even as he campaigned for Director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in 1911-12. Despite massive support from Houston Stewart Chamberlain, Uexkiill lost to the Darwinian faction (Field 1981, 328). In order to assure that he would at least have a secure future Uexkull's friend, the chemist Emil Fischer (1852-1919), organized colleagues to write in favor of Uexkiill. One of those who wrote favorably was Jacques Loeb: 'His experiments are reliable, ingenious and valuable. I think Uexkiill would be the right man for a research position.'4 However, Loeb's state ment referred solely to Uexkull's reflex-physiological works. Thomas H. Morgan also expressed himself in favor of Uexkùll, even if he consid ered some of Uexkull's positions extreme. Professor Richard Parker of Harvard University argued similarly.5 The tendency to treat Uexkùll in only this one dimension continued after 1918, even in Germany.

Richard Goldschmidt, who had known Uexkiill since the 1890s and who had meanwhile advanced to be Director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Biology, was asked to write a corresponding évaluation. In it, he recommended sup port for the Hamburg institute on the grounds that Uexkiill was a behaviorist.6 This seems ail the stranger because at this time the neo vitalists were making great efforts to distance themselves from other directions of biological-psychological research. The attempt by Gestalt psychology in particular to appropriate vitalism displeased Driesch, so that in 1927 he outlined a distinction between behaviorism (and Gestalt psychology) and vitalism (Driesch 1927, 8-10). This threatened to pull the rug out from under Uexkull's one-sided reception as a reflex physi ologist, whereby he took a very positive stance toward such a réévalua tion of his oeuvre. This would enable him to shed the mechanistic shad ow of the past for good. At the same time, a reform group within behav iorism strove to reorient their own field. In doing so, this suggested a radical break from earlier figures (Tolman 1922, Watson 1924). These reformers rejected an orientation toward the 'absurd terminology of Beer, Bethe, von Uexkùll, Nuel and that of so-called objective school generally' (Yerkes 1919, 9), and instead allied themselves with those German researchers who were doing natural-scientific psychology by conducting intelligence tests on animais (Yerkes 1979, 89). These included représentatives of Gestalt psychology, who strove as much as the behaviorists for absolute objectivity while remaining close to the reality of individual life (Bozzi 1999, 19). This was the précisé opposite of what Uexkùll wanted to investigate. He concentrated on the study of subjective individual environments. But despite these debates conduct ed by the scientific public, Uexkùll's work continued to remain present in English-language psychology. For example, giants of the field like E.G. Boring, E.R. Hilgard, andJ.C. Flugel showed they were convinced of the correctness of Uexkùll's work before 1900 and of its applicability to (behaviorist) psychology (Boring 1950, 625; Hilgard &amp; Marquis 1940, 6; Flugel &amp; West 1964, 103). His vitalistic work was simply negated. Not until the 1960s was Uexkùll dropped from the relevant discus sions. This did not happen because the behaviorists had noticed the change in his research, but because the investigatory methods had changed. Uexkùll fell victim to a burst of modernization in English-lan 6 Uexkiill to Harnack, 01.12.1926; Letter from Richard B. Goldschmidt. MPG Archives, I/0001A 2783/2.1. Abt.

Of ail times, this happened precisely when in Germany Thure von Uexkull (1908-2004), as the executor of his father's ideas, was constructing an individually tailored psychosomatic medi cine, in which he integrated his father's biological oeuvre, which had been completely neglected by the behaviorists (T. Uexkiill 1963). He thus managed to lastingly influence psychology, which had become dis enchanted with behaviorism. Uexkiill thereby achieved posthumously the influence in the psychological sciences that the behaviorists had once intended for him - but not with the part of his life's work that the behaviorist psychologists had once thought they discovered for them selves.
