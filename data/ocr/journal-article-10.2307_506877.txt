AKKERMANS AND MARC VERHOEVEN Abstract The site of Tell Sabi Abyad in the upper Balikh valley of northern Syria is the focal point of a regionally oriented research project investigating the socioeco- nomic organization of later Neolithic society in the re- gion. Recent excavations at Tell Sabi Abyad have brought to light a well-preserved settlement dating from the late sixth millennium B.C. and heavily affected by a violent fire, the so-called Burnt Village. The village consists of rectangular, multiroomed houses built of pise along very regular lines and surrounded by smaller circular struc- tures. Thousands of finds were recovered in situ from the burned houses, including ceramic and stone vessels, flint and obsidian implements, ground stone tools, human and animal figurines, labrets, axes, and personal ornaments. Most exciting, however, are the hundreds of clay sealings with stamp-seal impressions and the small tokens, which point to a very early but well- developed system of recording and administration. The Burnt Village was part of extensive networks of long- and short-distance exchange, and its inhabitants main- tained relationships with groups of people in distant areas, such as the coastal regions of the Levant, the pied- mont of southeastern Turkey, and the plains of Meso- potamia. External resources were mobilized and ex- ploited in a regular manner and to a considerable extent, i.e., beyond the level of incidental transactions.* INTRODUCTION Since the spring of 1986, four campaigns of ar- chaeological investigation have been undertaken on the site of Tell Sabi Abyad ("Mound of the White Boy"), situated in the upper Balikh valley of north- ern Syria, about 30 km south of the Syro-Turkish border (fig. 1). The site was primarily occupied in the sixth millennium B.C. and is the largest of a cluster of prehistoric mounds (locally known as Khirbet Sabi Abyad) located in a linear pattern at short distances from each other. Today the Balikh River flows about 5 km west of the various mounds but originally the Nahr Turkman, a branch of the Balikh, probably flowed beside the complex. The work at Tell Sabi Abyad is part of a regional research project of survey and excavation that aims to explore the social and economic structure of later Neolithic society in the Balikh basin. The first two seasons of excavation at Sabi Abyad revealed a series of superimposed and generally well-preserved pre- historic settlements composed of multiroomed rect- angular buildings and small circular structures, which could mainly be ascribed to the Early Halaf period, dated around 5100-5000 B.C.' The 1991 and 1992 field seasons have partly modified and ex- panded the earlier results. In addition, they have yielded wholly new and spectacular information on the Neolithic strata of occupation preceding the Halaf deposits at the site. The history of cultural development in this area in the sixth millennium B.C. ranks among the least * We wish to express our gratitude to the Directorate General of Antiquities and Museums of Syria, Damascus, for its continued assistance and encouragement concern- ing the excavations at Tell Sabi Abyad.

Map of the Balikh valley and the location of Tell Sabi Abyad well known in the Near East.2 The collapse of Pre- Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB) society in the early sixth millennium seems to have ushered in an era of mo- mentous change in the Levant and inland Syria. In areas long inhabited, like the fertile banks of the Euphrates and its tributaries, a vast number of Neo- lithic village communities were deserted, perhaps due to an increasing aridity or degradation of the environment;3 the remaining sites can be expected to have faced major socioeconomic changes and al- 2Recently, Stuart Campbell correctly pointed out that prehistoric research in the Near East mainly seems to con- cern the two great "revolutions," i.e., the introduction of agriculture and the emergence of urbanism, with only little attention given to the intervening Late Neolithic. Interest in the Halaf culture has increased in recent decades but active research in the preceding cultures is still of a most intermittent nature. See S. Campbell, Culture, Chronology and Change in the Later Neolithic of North Mesopotamia (Edin- burgh 1992). 3 This phenomenon is generally referred to as the hiatus palestinien; see, e.g., J. Mellaart, The Neolithic of the Near East (London 1975) 67-69; A.M.T. Moore, "The First Farmers in the Levant," in T.C. Young, P. Smith, and P.

Recent archae- ological research in the Balikh valley clearly indi- cates an ongoing trend toward decreased settlement area and density of population in the sixth millen- nium. For example, whereas it is assumed that around 6000 B.C. up to 1,000 individuals inhabited the valley (with a floor of ca. 450 km2) on a permanent basis, some six or seven centuries later the population den- sity in the area appears to have been reduced to a mere 300 or 400 persons.4 Only five settlements seem to have existed in the Balikh region at this time, all with an area of occupation of less than 2 or 3 ha and all located in the northern, rainfed part of the valley. Only two of these sites, however, Sabi Abyad and Mounbatah, provide evidence of durable, long- term occupation, whereas the others were probably all newly founded in the late sixth millennium and should be regarded as offsprings of the ancestral com- munities at Sabi Abyad or Mounbatah.5 Survey evidence from the Balikh area has made it clear that the trend of site desertion and contrac- tion of occupation to a few larger mounds came to a halt at the latest at around 5300/5200 B.C. and was followed by an attempt to recolonize the lands earlier abandoned. Perhaps ecological conditions were im- proving at this time but other, culturally defined determinants must have been at work as well. The recent excavations at Tell Sabi Abyad suggest the de- velopment of an increasingly complex society in the Balikh basin toward the end of the sixth millennium, which successfully coped with local environmental and societal constraints and incorporated external influences to a considerable extent. Local later Neo- lithic society seems to have abandoned more and more its earlier autonomous character6 and instead established wider, interregional modes of commu- nication and exchange networks. Ultimately these developments gave rise to the Halaf, characterized by an astonishing cultural uni- formity over very great distances and often con- sidered to be the first widespread cultural tradition in the Near East.' This diffusion of cultural traits over much of the northern Fertile Crescent is com- monly dated to a time late in the Halaf period8 but recently it has been suggested that the trend toward increasing cultural unity started much earlier, ca. 5200 B.C.9 In this respect, the rather sudden and widespread distribution of Samarra-like ceramics, prior to the appearance of Halaf pottery, is of the utmost importance. At Sabi Abyad the emergence of Halaf was the result of a gradual and continuous local process of cultural change but the occurrence of many painted or painted-and-incised ceramics closely resembling Samarra pottery from north- central Iraq in the so-called transitional levels at the site suggests interaction between the local, late sixth- millennium communities and those found further east.10 It may not be without significance that this apparent adoption of foreign styles and further local elaboration followed a period of instability; affili- ation and conformation to new cultural norms from the east may have provided considerable social or economic benefits." STRATIGRAPHY AND CHRONOLOGY The 1986 and 1988 seasons of excavation at Sabi Abyad revealed a stratigraphic sequence consisting of eight major building phases or levels.12 Virgin soil had not yet been reached, however, and an extension of the sequence further back in time was expected. The most recent campaigns of excavation (1991- 1992) have indeed yielded three more levels (11-9) until virgin soil was finally reached at a depth of 4 m below the level of the surrounding fields in a narrow trench (P15) laid out along the south slope of the mound. Levels 9 and 10 are each represented by the re- mains of a wall and oven as well as by deposits of grayish to orange-brown loam and ashes. Most likely these deposits represent mainly domestic refuse dumped over a considerable period of time. In con- trast, the lowest level (11) consisted of a compact and Revolution in the Light of Ecological and Ethnographic Evidence," Paleorient 14 (1988) 87-93 and the various con- tributions in S.

The Burnt Village, the well-preserved house remains low on the slope of Sabi Abyad (view from the south) rather homogeneous, waterlogged deposit, grayish in color. Within level 11 hardly any clear microstra- tigraphy was recognized, which indicates a rapid rate of deposition, uniform in nature. A hiatus in occu- pation at Sabi Abyad between levels 10 and 11 is not excluded:'1 Not only the stratigraphic evidence but also the considerable differences in pottery assem- blages from both phases point in this direction. In contrast to the level 10 pottery, the ceramics from level 11, characterized by simple hole-mouth vessels and tall, straight-walled pots with loop handles, show close similarities to those from the nearby sites of Tell Assouad and Tell Damishliyya.14 Both sites were deserted around 5800/5700 B.C. as part of the gen- eral abandonment of communities in the Balikh re- gion at this time; most likely a similar date should be attributed to level 11 at Sabi Abyad. If Sabi Abyad indeed has to be added to the list of sites abandoned in the early sixth millennium, it appears that the Balikh valley as a whole must have been virtually devoid of permanent settlement at this time.15 In addition to these stratigraphically oriented in- vestigations in narrow and deep trenches, consider- able attention has been given to the broad-scale ex- posure of the more easily accessible upper levels of occupation. Our main efforts of work during the 1991-1992 seasons concerned the so-called "transi- tional" levels (6-4), which represent an intermediate stage between the lower, pre-Halaf Neolithic (levels 11-7) and the topmost Early Halaf (levels 3-1). Ex- cavation was continued in areas first excavated during previous campaigns but, additionally, new trenches were opened nearby. Part of the transitional levels 4 and 5 had been excavated before but a coherent building plan could not be recognized while level 3 house remains were still standing to a consider- able height.16 Consequently these level 3 structures were removed but, surprisingly, no additional level 4 or 5 features were found below. Instead, a series of well-preserved structures appeared that could be ascribed to a much older phase of occupation (level 6, i.e., the earliest of the transitional levels) and that had been heavily affected by a violent fire: the Burnt Village (fig. 2). Apparently, in order to construct the level 3 buildings, the mound had been partly leveled and earlier strata of occupation largely removed. Considerable in-situ deposits were recovered from the houses of the Burnt Village, including ceramic and stone vessels, ground stone implements, flint and obsidian tools, human and animal figurines of unfired clay, labrets, axes, personal ornaments, tokens, and hundreds of clay sealings with stamp- seal impressions. In chronological terms it is clear that the Burnt Village dates from the later sixth millennium, ca. 5200/5100 B.C. (uncalibrated). At present two radio- carbon dates are available, both taken from build- ing II. One sample (GrN-19367) stems from the vast quantity of burnt cereals found on the floor in room 14 and yielded a date of 7075 ? 25 B.P., and the other (GrN-19368) was taken from charcoal found on the 13 In Akkermans 119 it was suggested that no such break in occupation existed at Sabi Abyad but this now seems questionable. 14 .

These dates seem to be rather late when compared with the series of dates available for the upper levels (4-1) at the site7 but it should be taken into account that they refer to the final destruction of the Burnt Village, not its founding. Nevertheless, it seems that the vari- ous phases of occupation at Sabi Abyad succeeded each other rapidly. ARCHITECTURE The level 6 or Burnt Village remains, partially standing to a height of 1.40 m, have thus far been excavated over an area of about 560 m2 (fig. 3). No doubt, future fieldwork will considerably enlarge the layout of the Burnt Village since its presence in other squares has already been confirmed by the appear- ance of the reddish-brown or orange, ashy layer char- acteristic of the burnt house debris. Apparently the Burnt Village was built in terraces: part of the mound had been dug away along the slope, and the floors and walls of the houses low on the slope were founded about 2 m below those of the buildings somewhat higher on the mound. Conse- quently it appears that the floors of the upper houses must have been more or less at the same level as the roofs of the lower houses; one could easily walk onto these roofs. Actually, we have some evidence that this was indeed the case and that various kinds of activ- ities were carried out on the roofs (see below). To date, the Burnt Village is represented by five rectangular, multiroomed structures (buildings I-V) and four circular ones (the so-called tholoi, buildings 17 Cf. Akkermans and Le Mibre 4, table 1.

In addition, seven ovens were encountered in and between the various house remains (figs. 3-4). The dimensions of the rectangular buildings seem to have varied between more than 50 m2 and 90 m2 but none of the rectangular features has been com- pletely exposed yet. Generally speaking, the houses of the Burnt Village were originally built along very regular lines and closely attached to each other, al- though all kinds of renovations and reconstructions took place in the course of time. Most houses seem to have had more than one floor (each consisting of hard-tamped loam layers ca. 1-3 cm thick), of which only the upper one has been exposed so far. Basically, the oblong structures seem to have been divided in three rows or wings, each of which con- sisted of a series of small rooms. Some of these houses must have had 15 or more rooms, all very small and varying in size between about 3 and 5 m2. The generally 40-cm-wide walls of the level 6 build- ings were simply founded on earth and were all built of pise, laid down in layers of various color and, most likely, various consistency. The order is always the same: a gray, 2- or 3-cm-thick loam band is followed by an orange-brown, ca. 2-4-cm deposit, in its turn covered by a buff layer, about 6-8 cm thick, and so on. Apparently, various sources of clay were in use, which each must have had different qualities. Cer- tainly the alternating banding did not have any "dec- orative" meaning, for the walls seem all to have been covered with mud plaster. The use of pise instead of mudbricks for construction purposes is remark- able since mudbricks have a much longer history of use in the Balikh region.18 Apparently, the renewed cultural development at sites like Sabi Abyad some- where around or shortly after the middle of the sixth millennium involved the introduction of wholly new building techniques. Circulation through the various buildings was of a somewhat peculiar nature. Indeed, access to most rooms seems to have been enhanced by a series of rather narrow doorways but, interestingly enough, circulation was not always continuous. The best evi- dence in this respect comes from the well-preserved building IV. Rooms 9-13 are linked by doorways in a linear pattern; in addition, room 6 and, possibly, room 5 (cf. fig. 3) are also accessible from this chain of linked rooms. These southern and central rooms, however, are not linked to the nortnernmost and east- ern series of chambers, rooms 1-4, 7, and 14 (more- over, these rooms are not all linked to each other 18 Mudbricks were the main building material at Tell Damishliyya and Tell Assouad, both dated to the later sev- enth to early sixth millennium B.C.; Akkermans (supra n. 14); Cauvin (supra n. 14). At Sabi Abyad mudbricks seem to have been first introduced in the transitional period, i.e., around 5200/5100 B.C.</page><page sequence="7">1995] THE BURNT VILLAGE AT LATE NEOLITHIC SABI ABYAD 11 either). Apparently, one could not simply enter build- ing IV through a central or main gate and subse- quently walk through the entire structure; in order to reach a particular room or wing of rooms one had to return and take another main entry. In some instances this even meant that one had to leave the building and walk not only around the building it- self but also around the closely attached, neighbor- ing structures, which, indeed, would be a most un- practical and wearying procedure. In this respect, one wonders whether the present passages should not be considered of secondary importance and whether the main access to the various rooms was not actually organized in a wholly different manner, i.e., from the roof of the building. We do know that the roof of some structures was used for various kinds of activities, some of a ritual nature (see below), but the most convincing evidence for roof entrances is found in the fact that some rooms did not have a doorway at floor level and, consequently, were not linked to any other room at all; as a necessity, these rooms must have been accessible from a higher level only."1 Moreover, when taking into account that building IV stood immediately next to buildings III and V, it appears that the rooms on the ground floor of building IV must have been very dark; an open- ing in the roof may have provided not only access but the necessary light and air as well. If in the case of building IV the roof indeed pro- vided the main access, the various doorways at floor level may have been of lesser importance, perhaps constructed in a somewhat random manner accord- ing to need. Many rooms seem to have had doorways of such restricted size (diameter ca. 50 cm) that one had to crawl through them on hands and knees. These "portholes"' earlier reported from sites like Bouqras, Umm Dabaghiyah, Beidha, Abu Hureyra, and Ganj Dareh,20 are all situated at a somewhat higher level in the wall and have a rounded, almost arched superstructure. No traces of wooden jambs have yet been found, which suggests that these door- ways were simply hewn out of the already existing walls. Portholes were also attested in building V and were most likely originally present in the other build- ings as well. On the other hand, it appears that building IV originally had at least two main entrances at floor level, both located in the south: one in room 9, the other in room 13. The entrance in room 13 was blocked when building V was enlarged by the con- struction of rooms 3-5. Moreover, some chambers definitely had normal doorways, usually ca. 50 cm wide, as did other structures of the Burnt Village. In one case (the doorway between rooms 2 and 3 in building II), a pivot stone was present, indicating that this passage was originally closed by a wooden door. Normal doorways at floor level also provided access to building I (rooms 1 and 2). Apparently, access to the level 6 houses was arranged in a variety of ways. Apart from some tholoi, all level 6 structures were heavily affected by an intense fire that penetrated the walls throughout and caused a considerable ac- cumulation of orange to brown, crumbly loam, wall fragments, dark ashes, and charred wood in the build- ings. The lowest 10 cm of these deposits, directly sit- uated on the floors, virtually always consisted of fine and powdery black ashes; most likely, these ashes represent the burnt residue of the roof cover (reed mats). The common occurrence of charred beams and hard-burnt loam fragments with impressions of reeds and circular wooden poles in the various houses reveals that the roofs were all made in the same way: wooden rafters were laid at regular inter- vals and covered with reed mats, in their turn covered by a thick mud layer. Building I Building I, oriented northeast/east by west/south- west, is at least 12.50 m long and 7.50 m wide, and thus far consists of nine rooms constructed around a large, central room or, perhaps, courtyard (area 3; fig. 3). The southernmost series of rooms (1-4) was heavily affected by fire and filled with ashes, but the other areas seem to have been left largely undisturbed and contained a ca. 30-60-cm accumulation of gray to brown loam (probably wall debris). Doorways, each marked by small buttresses, were only recognized in the case of the southern rooms 1 and 2; no passages were found in the northern- most areas, probably due largely to the rather poor state of wall preservation (some walls stood to a height of only 20 cm). Room 1 was accessible only from the open area to the south, whereas room 2 could be entered both from the south and from the north (figs. 2-3). 19 The same actually holds for some rooms in structures I, II, and V, although in the case of buildings I and II the general absence of doorways is undoubtedly partially due to the rather poor state of preservation of the various walls. 20 See, e.g., PA. Akkermans et al., "Bouqras Revisited: Preliminary Report on a Project in Eastern Syria," PPS 49 (1983) 335-72; P.E.L.

AKKERMANS AND MARC VERHOEVEN [AJA 99 A rounded, beehive-shaped oven, about 75-80 cm in diameter and built of pise, was found in the north- eastern corner of room 2. The interior is lined with a ca. 6-cm-thick layer of mud plaster. The oven wall rests on a low platform, measuring ca. 1.40 x 1.20 x 0.20 m; the hard-burnt interior base of the oven is sunk to a depth of about 35 cm into this platform. The discovery of an infant burial in this oven, unfortunately rather poorly preserved (the left arm, feet, and lower parts of the legs are missing), was surprising. The dead child was laid upon a ca. 10-cm- thick layer of brown loam; a similar deposit, in its turn followed by burnt debris, was found on top of the skeletal remains. The dead infant was oriented north/northeast by south/southwest and laid on its back, with the head toward the southwest, the legs straddled, and the right arm in a flexed position. A small bowl was found near the feet of the child, perhaps offered as a burial gift.21 An oven similar to the one in room 2 was un- covered in area 3, in the center or, perhaps, court of building I. The oven, ca. 1.90 m in diameter and preserved to a height of only 10 cm, has a clay wall 20-40 cm thick, lined on the interior by ca. 8 cm of mud plaster. A 25-cm opening or ventilation hole is present in the southeast. The oven rests upon a low platform measuring 1.80 x 1.60 x 0.20 m. In- tensive domestic use of the area around this oven is demonstrated by the presence of considerable quantities of artifacts of various kinds (ceramics, stone mortars and pestles, bone awls, clay sling mis- siles), apparently all in situ. Another in-situ find con- sists of three vessels, found together on the floor in the southeastern corner of room 8. A large but brittle, red-burnished and impressed bowl (see below, fig. 10: 15) was found lying upside down, covering a solidly red-burnished jar with a globular body and a flaring neck (fig. 10: 14). Next to these vessels stood a rather coarsely finished pot with a low neck (fig. 10: 16). In shape these vessels closely resemble some of the ceramics found in the topmost Early Halaf levels (3-1) at Sabi Abyad but the decoration is characteristic of the mid- to late sixth millennium B.C. and is no longer found in Halaf times. The stone construction found in the northern part of room 5 is rather curious and as yet unexplained. It consists of cobbles and gypsum boulders, carefully placed in line with the surrounding mud walls. The stones seem to constitute a kind of platform, ca. 3.50 m2 large and about 30 cm high. Building H Building II, like building I, is oriented northeast/ east by west/southwest. The structure is at present 11.50 m long and about 7.50 m wide, and consists of at least 13 small and square rooms, each virtually identical in size, measuring ca. 1.75 x 1.75 m, and arranged in three rows (figs. 2-3). Its very regular layout stands in sharp contrast to that of building I and may suggest that the features served different purposes.22 Domestic installations other than a low platform in room 2 are absent from building II but are found in the subsidiary structure III built along its southern facade. As in the neighboring features, the rooms of building II are all of very restricted size and one wonders whether they were truly used for living. Actually, the finds in these rooms sug- gest that storage and related activities were their main function. Storage seems to have been under- taken in several ways. The considerable quantities of charred grain found in building II, particularly in its westernmost rooms (11, 12, and 14; in addition, some grain was found in room 7), suggest that cereals were stored in bulk. In room 14 the grain lay almost knee-high and was surrounded and partly covered by a layer of ashy white fibrous material of vegetable origin (probably burnt chaff). Other products seem to have been stored in large ceramic vessels, placed in small groups in various rooms, or in containers made of more perishable materials, i.e., baskets and sacks. The abundant presence of perishable contain- ers is proved by marks on the reverse side of the nu- merous sealings found in buildings II and V. Baskets seem to have been used in massive numbers. The common occurrence of grinding slabs, mor- tars, and pestles on the floors of some rooms sug- gests that cereal or food processing took place in building II as well. The low and rectangular feature found in the northeast corner of room 2 may have served as a working platform. It was built of hard brown loam and measures about 1.60 x 1.25 x 0.20 m. The top surface is slightly concave with rounded edges. The finds in room 6 are most remarkable. In con- trast to the sparse artifactual remains other than ground stone tools and pottery in most other areas of building II, room 6 yielded hundreds of small ob- jects of all kinds, e.g., ceramics, stone bowls and axes, bone implements, labrets, and clay figurines of both women and animals. Most exciting, however, are the more than 150 clay sealings with stamp-seal impres- 21 It remains doubtful whether this is truly the case: the bowl was found on the oven floor, below the loam layer upon which the dead child had been laid. 22 On the other hand, the layout of building I can hardly be defined at present, due to its incomplete expo- sure and later additions and modifications. It is not ex- cluded that building I has a ground plan similar to that of the neighboring building II.</page><page sequence="9">1995] THE BURNT VILLAGE AT LATE NEOLITHIC SABI ABYAD 13 Fig. 5. Large, beehive-shaped oven S with its vaulted roof partly still intact sions and the small tokens, which point to a very early but well-developed system of recording and admin- istration (see below). Apparently, room 6 was not used for common domestic activities or storage in the usual sense but instead served as a kind of archive. A similar hoard of tokens and sealings was found in building V, situated somewhat lower on the mound. Unfortunately no evidence for doorways has been found in building II apart from the passage between rooms 2 and 3. A small pivot hole ca. 13 cm in di- ameter and 7 cm deep was hollowed out in a rounded loam boulder, suggesting that this doorway was once closed by a wooden door. In all other instances the walls (which, admittedly, are preserved to a limited height only) were uninterrupted, and apparently these rooms were accessible either through a pas- sage situated at a higher and now eroded level in the wall (i.e., portholes) or from the roof of the building. Finally, a well-preserved infant inhumation was found just along the northern wall and below the floor of room 10 (actually, the floor was renewed after the interment). The child was lying on its right side in a tightly flexed position in a shallow pit ca. 45 cm in diameter and 22 cm deep. The body was ori- ented east-west (atlas to sacrum), with the head fac- ing south. No burial gifts were found. Building III and the Ovens Immediately to the south of building II are a small rectangular structure (building III) and a series of ovens of various sizes and layout that had been con- structed within a walled enclosure (figs. 2-3). The various rooms ascribed to building III were undoubt- edly roofed but whether this is also the case for the oven area is unclear. Building III measures ca. 7.00 x 3.50 m and stands to a height of about 80 cm. It consists of three rooms, all accessible from the north. Most likely these rooms were related to the nearby ovens and served for sub- sidiary purposes, e.g., the storage of fuel and the prep- aration of food. The latter is indicated by the pres- ence of pestles and mortars in rooms 2 and 3. Other domestic activity is represented by some bone awls and spindle whorls in these areas. The ovens, concentrated in the area in front of rooms 1 and 2, were not conceived and raised at a single time but built in at least three stages. Appar- ently, when an oven went out of use, the feature was leveled and a new installation constructed. The larg- est oven (S), however, seems to have been used con- tinuously for a considerable period of time. This im- pressive, beehive-shaped feature stands to a height of almost 1.50 m, with its vaulted roof partly intact (fig. 5). The oven is oval in shape and has a maxi- mum diameter of 2.90 m. Its wall is ca. 35 cm wide and is constructed of layers of orange-brown clay, heavily tempered with straw. The interior is consid- erably sooted. Cross-sections revealed that the heat penetrated the wall as much as 4 cm, thereby grad- ually blackening the orange-brown clay. The oven was accessible through a tapering opening in the east (at its base ca. 70 cm wide) and contains several floors of hard-tamped, burnt loam, varying in thick- ness between 2 and 7 cm and all sloping toward the south. The various floors are separated from each other by layers of gray and black ashes. Upon the upper floor orange-red and gray-brown loam had ac- cumulated, most likely part of the collapsed super- structure. The lowest floor was laid against a ca. 10-cm- wide, protruding strip of clay, which ran along the</page><page sequence="10">14 PETER M.M.G. AKKERMANS AND MARC VERHOEVEN [AJA 99 Fig. 6. The well-preserved remains of houses IV and V low on the slope of Sabi Abyad (view from the north) inner facade and, possibly, below the oven wall. Per- haps this strip of clay and the earliest floor are part of an older oven that was incorporated in oven S at some point. Two other types of ovens were constructed im- mediately to the north and northeast of oven S. A horseshoe-shaped oven or hearthplace is ca. 1.75 m long and 1.35 m wide. Its wall is ca. 20 cm wide and made of orange-brown clay. Like oven S, this fea- ture had been used intensively: seven floor levels were recognized, each ca. 1 cm thick and made of hard- burnt clay. When this hearthplace went out of use, a circular tannur-like oven, ca. 75 cm in diameter, was built upon its remains. Another tannur, about 1 m in diameter, is located to the west. Other ovens, again of various shapes and sizes, were found elsewhere in front of building III or in the open area to the east of it. A small keyhole-shaped oven, measuring ca. 75 x 35 cm, is present in the north of room 3, built against the eastern wall. It is made of ca. 3-cm-wide coils of hard, orange-brown clay. Part of the oven (and of the associated eastern wall of room 3) was disturbed by a pit sunk from an upper level of occupation. Another oven or hearth-like construction, more or less square in lay- out and measuring 1.10 x 1.00 m, was found in the open area to the east of building III. It consists of a shallow pit, of which the edge seems to have been lined by mudbricks. The interior of the pit is paved with fragments of a large ceramic vessel. Most sherds had undergone secondary firing and were covered with fine charcoal and ashes. Building IV The remains of the east-west building IV, partially standing to a height of 1.40 m, are (with building V) among the best preserved of the Burnt Village (fig. 6). Building IV measures at least 11.00 x 7.00 m and consists of minimally 14 rooms. As in building II, these rooms are arranged in three rows (figs. 3-4). The building was severely burned, with the excep- tion of the northernmost series of rooms (1 to 4). Whereas most rooms were entirely filled with ashes and other burnt building debris, the latter areas had evidence of loam only. Some of the walls in these northernmost rooms are not straight but lean to the north and east, probably due to the pressure of the collapsed upper walls and roof covering. Most rooms seem to have had normal doorways but portholes were found as well. Some rooms do not have a passage at floor level at all and were ap- parently accessible from the roof. In terms of pas- sage, the construction of building V, immediately to the south of building IV, must have had a consid- erable impact: it blocked the main entrance in room 13 to building IV (and, perhaps, the one in room</page><page sequence="11">1995] THE BURNT VILLAGE AT LATE NEOLITHIC SABI ABYAD 15 9 as well) and passage thus must have shifted to an- other area. The function of building IV remains somewhat enigmatic. In terms of shape, size, and room parti- tioning the structure closely resembles the nearby building II, which seems to have served largely for storage and food processing. Similar activities may have been pursued in building IV. The absence of ovens, bins, or other domestic installations may point in this direction. Other evidence is provided by the finds in the small room 6 in the center of the build- ing, which yielded eight jar necks upside down on the floor along the eastern wall. Most likely they orig- inally served as potstands. The necks, most of which still had part of the shoulder of the original vessel for proper placement, are about 10 cm high except for one that has a height of 18 cm, and all have di- ameters of ca. 10 cm. Two are painted, and two others incised. Most finds in building IV stem from the large room 2 (measuring ca. 2.70 x 1.70 m) in the north wing of the structure. Pestles and grinding slabs were found in considerable numbers on the floor in this area, as were some ceramics, clay labrets, pierced discs made of sherds, and a flint core. As in building II, the heavy ground stone tools illustrate the processing of food or other raw materials and the manufacture of various kinds of artifacts. Building V Building V measures at least 10.50 x 8.00 m and consists thus far of 10 rooms of varying dimen- sions.23 The structure suffered severely from the fire sweeping over the village in the late sixth millen- nium and all rooms were filled in with ashes and other burnt building debris. The walls are generally preserved to a height of about 1.00 m but stand much lower in the heavily eroded westernmost area 1. Frag- ments of charred wooden poles ca. 10 cm in diam- eter and up to 1.50 m long (undoubtedly part of the roof cover) were found in various rooms as were burnt impressions of reeds. Remnants of the roof were most clearly recognized in rooms 2 and 3: these oblong chambers were originally covered by timbers oriented north-south, laid at regular intervals and covered by a thick layer of reeds oriented east-west. The reeds were subsequently covered with mud. Basically building V seems to consist of room 2 and rooms 7-10. The other parts (rooms 3-6) were added to the main structure at a somewhat later stage. The walls of this added part are not bonded with those of the original structure but abut them instead. Moreover, some rooms (3-5) were raised upon de- bris that had accumulated in the open area or court in front of both buildings IV and V, blocking the southern doorway of the former structure. The vari- ous rooms have either normal doorways (rooms 2-8) or portholes (room 10). Direct access to room 2 was blocked when the neighboring rooms 3-5 were con- structed; apparently, access to room 2 (and to the newly built room 3) then shifted to the roof. Room 9 in the center of building V yielded no passage at floor level either and must also have been accessible from the roof only. No domestic installations were found in building V except in room 5. Here a small tannur-like oven appeared, ca. 70 cm long and 50 cm wide. Its wall is about 1-2 cm wide and the base of the oven is plastered with sherds. The oven is somewhat pecu- liarly placed in what originally may have been a pas- sage from area 5 to either the court or another room situated further east. In addition to this oven, room 5 contains a large stone mortar partly sunk into the floor and solidly cramped by a stone lining. Pestles and grinding slabs were found in considerable quan- tities, as were large numbers of animal bones on the floor, including thejaws of both bovids and caprines. Grinding equipment was also encountered in other rooms but it was rare or completely absent in rooms 2, 3, and 9, i.e., the areas accessible from the roof only. The presence of large ceramic vessels in room 3 may indicate that at least some of these closed chambers were used for storage, in contrast to the easily accessible rooms around the court, which seem to have served mainly for the daily preparation of food. The most noteworthy finds came from rooms 6 and 7. Here, in addition to ceramics and various kinds of stone tools, hundreds of small objects of sun-dried clay were found, includingjar stoppers, loomweights, sling missiles, figurines, tokens, and sealings that usu- ally carried stamp-seal impressions. These finds closely resemble those in room 6 of building II. In room 7 of building V the clay objects were mainly found on or just above the floor but in the case of the nearby room 6 this seems to hold for part of the finds only; many objects appeared in the dark ashes and other room fill high above the floor. In this re- spect, it may well be that the various objects in room 6 had originally been placed on shelves or the like along the walls and had subsequently fallen. It is also possible that the objects fell from a much higher level, 23 More rooms will surely be found in the area to the west and probably also to the south of building V.</page><page sequence="12">16 PETER M.M.G. AKKERMANS AND MARC VERHOEVEN [AJA 99 Fig. 7. Selection of large clay objects from building V i.e., from the roof; a number of pestles and grinding slabs were found in the upper part of the room de- bris, ca. 70 cm above the floor and, most importantly, above charred timbers that must have been part of the roof. In addition to this possible domestic use, it seems that some sort of ritual activity took place on the roof of building V. Eleven large and rather curiously shaped clay objects (fig. 7) were found in the fill of the house,24 sometimes high above the floor and amid charred roof beams and impressions of reed mats; in view of their position, these heavy objects must originally have been on the roof and fallen when the building collapsed. Virtually all are oval in shape, with a flat base and a rounded, convex body. These objects vary in length between 29 and 62 cm and in width between 16 and 41 cm. Their height ranges between 10 and 28 cm. Most of them have one or two shallow holes along each of the long sides, whereas another hole is often found on top. In at least two cases this hole on top contains the horn of a wild sheep, the larger part of which is hidden from view (fig. 8). Another of these objects contains the lower leg bone of a bovid, again largely hidden in the clay. The precise meaning of these objects re- mains puzzling but should most likely be looked for in a ritual context. Possibly these objects represent animals in a very stylized manner. If so, the shal- low holes along the sides may originally have held wooden sticks or the like, representing the legs, or, alternatively, served as grips to allow transport. It is interesting to note that in the fill of room 7 and amid some of these clay "animals," the skeletal re- mains of two adults were found, with the bones com- pletely crushed and burnt. These persons, too, must have fallen from the roof.25 24 In addition, one was found in the upper fill of room 11 of building IV. 25 One may wonder whether these persons were simply trapped on the roof of the house and subsequently died in the fire or whether other variables must be taken into consideration. In none of the other houses were human skeletal remains uncovered that could be associated with the fire; apparently, most of the inhabitants of Sabi Abyad escaped from the disaster in time. When furthermore tak- ing into account that building V yielded not only these dead persons but the clay "animals" as well, it can be argued that both features should be associated and viewed in a ritual context. Although wholly speculative, it may be the case that both persons were already dead at the time of destruction but were deliberately laid on the roof for defleshment and awaiting final interment. Mellaart has sug- gested a largely similar custom of secondary burial for the sixth-millennium site of natal Hiiyiik in central Anatolia; see J. Mellaart, Qatal Hiiyiik, a Neolithic Town in Anatolia (London 1967) 204.</page><page sequence="13">1995] THE BURNT VILLAGE AT LATE NEOLITHIC SABI ABYAD 17 Fig. 8. Horn of a wild sheep placed in the center of one of the large clay objects from building V Circular Buildings VI-IX In addition to the rectangular structures, four cir- cular buildings, or tholoi, were found (figs. 3-4). The largest one is building VI, situated to the east of build- ing I. It has an interior diameter of about 6.75 m and is divided into a series of smaller compartments. Very small rectangular rooms (5-8) seem to have been added to the circular chamber at a somewhat later date. Another rectangular structure can be found immediately south of the tholos but was partly de- stroyed by a large pit sunk from a late second- millennium layer of occupation. The main entrance to tholos VI is in the northeast corner of compartment 2. This doorway has a low clay threshold and contains a stone door socket, in- dicating that the passage was originally closed by a wooden door. No other doorways were recognized, perhaps due to the fact that the walls are preserved to a very limited height, only about 20 cm. The presence of some pestles, spindle whorls, loomweights, and bone awls in the main compart- ments 1, 2, and 4 suggests that these areas served for common domestic activities such as food prep- aration or cloth manufacture. Other evidence point- ing in this direction includes a small, low bin made of clay slabs found in the northeast corner of com- partment 1 and a ca. 15-cm-deep basin found along the wall in area 4. The basin is rectangular in plan and measures about 45 x 30 cm. Its interior facades are coated with a ca. 1-1.5 cm layer of mud plaster, in its turn covered by a thin white coating. The other rooms (3-8) are each very restricted in size and can hardly have served purposes other than storage. The sole exception may have been room 8, added to the tholos at a somewhat later stage. This area appears to have been built upon the remains of a large but leveled oven; the hard-burnt oven floor, however, was incorporated and reused in the newly constructed room 8. In this respect, room 8 perhaps should be seen as a modification of the earlier oven. Two other circular structures (VII-VIII) were found in the open area to the southwest of tholos VI. Build- ing VII has an interior diameter of about 4.50 m and stands to a height of ca. 70 cm. Its wall, covered with a thick white plaster on the exterior facade, curves slightly inward already at floor level, thus sug- gesting a domed superstructure. The southeastern part of the tholos was disturbed by later building activities but, interestingly, in the southwest the tholos wall seems to bend to the south instead of completing its circular course: perhaps a rectangu- lar antechamber lies in the still unexcavated area to the south (square R14).26 Tholos VIII stands immediately to the north of building VII but is much smaller: it has an interior diameter of only ca. 2.50 m. The structure is pre- served to a height of ca. 80 cm and was accessible through a ca. 50-cm-wide doorway in the eastern facade. This small tholos seems to have been in use for a considerable period of time: at least five super- imposed floor levels of tamped loam were found, each separated from the other by a series of thin and compact gray-brown layers of loam. The lower floors all sharply incline toward the west, i.e., to the entrance of the building; the topmost surface, how- ever, had been leveled. Evidently, the construction of a new floor in the tholos must have been related to a heightening of the open area or courtyard around the structure. Considerable quantities of do- mestic debris, ultimately about 80 cm in depth, must have been deposited deliberately in this court, re- quiring a continuous modification of the area and the associated structures. Tholos VII apparently had only one floor and must have stood in a ramshackle state or even have been deeply buried below later debris when the small tholos VIII was still in use.27 The fourth tholos (IX) in the Burnt Village is lo- cated along the northern wall of building II. Only a part of it has been excavated so far but the build- ing is estimated to have had an interior diameter of 2.50 m. The tholos was accessible from the east through a narrow, ca. 50-cm-wide doorway. The ex- terior facade is covered by a mud plaster layer. The interior, on the other hand, reveals a twice-renewed, hard-burnt mud plaster layer ca. 4-8 cm thick on 26 A tholos with an antechamber was found earlier in square Q15 at Sabi Abyad and is ascribed to level 4; see Akkermans 54; Akkermans and Le Mieire 5-8. 27 Clearly, the heightening of the court did not only affect the tholoi. The entrances and floors of rooms 1 and 2 of the neighboring building I were raised as well.</page><page sequence="14">18 PETER M.M.G. AKKERMANS AND MARC VERHOEVEN [AJA 99 )2 10 9 lo cM Fig. 9.

The plaster seems to have carried a thin, whitish coating. Tholoi with a similar burnt interior are commonly found in upper levels 3-1, ascribed to the Early Halaf period.28 It is interesting to note that none of the circular buildings, with the exception of tholos VI, seems to have been directly affected by the fire that ruined the level 6 settlement, despite the fact that some of them stood very close to the burnt buildings. The reason for this apparent distinction should prob- ably be looked for in the roof cover of the various structures. The rectangular buildings appear to have 28 Akkermans 1987, Paleorient (supra n. 1) 26; P.M.M.G. Akkermans, "Tell Sabi Abyad: Stratigraphy and Architec- ture," in Akkermans ed.

Coarse ware and Gray-Black ware are chaff-tempered, and the other wares are exclusively mineral-tempered: 11) reddish-brown (in courtyard between buildings II and III); 12) buff, burnished (in courtyard southeast of building V); 13) brown, burnished (building II); 14) brownish, red slip and burnished (building I); 15) grayish with red slip, burnished and impressed (building I); 16) reddish-brown (building I); 17) buff with black matt paint (building IV); 18) buff with whitish wash and brown matt paint (building I); 19) orahge-brown (building I); 20) buff with black matt paint, burnished, repair holes (building II); 21) buff with dark reddish-brown paint, burnished (tholos VI, remainder probably hidden in section balk). had flattened roofs made of timber and reeds, i.e., highly inflammable materials. Although this is specu- lative, the same may have been true for the large, multiroomed tholos VI.29 The other circular build- ings, however, have clay walls that curve in at floor level: these buildings seem to have been beehive- shaped and carried a superstructure made entirely of pise.30 29 This building closely resembles a large, multiroomed tholos found in a Halafian level at Yarim Tepe III, which, according to its excavators, seems to have had a simple, flattened roof: R.M. Munchaev, N.Y. Merpert, and N.O. Bader, "Archeological Studies in the Sinjar Valley, 1980," Sumer 43 (1984) 33. A flat roof has also been suggested for the tholoi of Halafian Shams ed-Din on the Euphrates: H. Seeden, "Ethnoarchaeological Reconstruction of Halafian Occupational Units at Shams ed-Din Tannira," Berytus 30 (1982) 74-75 and fig. 79. 30 The large oven S found south of building II clearly demonstrates that the technique of dome construction was known to the inhabitants of the Burnt Village.</page><page sequence="16">20 PETER M.M.G. AKKERMANS AND MARC VERHOEVEN [AJA 99 POTTERY Thousands of sherds as well as considerable num- bers of complete or, at least, reconstructable vessels have been recovered from the Burnt Village. An early account of these ceramics and those of the associ- ated strata of occupation has been presented else- where, and until now little could be added to that account.31 In many respects-wares represented, technique of manufacture, and shapes - these ceram- ics closely resemble those of the levels preceding the Burnt Village. The bulk of the pottery (up to 85%) still consists of plant-tempered and often bur- nished Coarse ware (figs. 9-10: 1-13, 16, 19). Occa- sionally these Coarse ware ceramics carry a red slip or have incised or impressed patterns of crosshatch- ing, oblique lines, and herringbone. Other examples are decorated with bands of dark red paint, some- times in combination with incision, or, very rarely, have knobs in appliqu&amp;. The Coarse ware shows a restricted variety of shapes, mainly consisting of simple, plain-rim bowls with rounded or occasionally straight vessel walls, hole-mouth pots, and jars with flaring or straight necks. Some of these jars are of considerable size, i.e., up to 1.00 m in height. It is interesting to note that many of the bowls have a distinct oval shape. Flattened, oval-shaped discs, simply made of sun- dried clay, are often found in association with these vessels and may have served as lids. The oval shape is not restricted to pottery only but is also recog- nizable in vessels made of stone. Around 5100 B.C., with the beginning of the Halaf period, oval-shaped vessels seem to have gone out of use. In addition to Coarse ware, small quantities of lo- cally manufactured Gray-Black ware and imported Dark-Faced Burnished ware were found. The gray pottery (e.g., fig. 10: 15) has a very fine paste, is mainly mineral-tempered (occasionally small amounts of vegetable inclusions are found as well), and is pur- posefully blackened. Usually these ceramics are bur- nished overall but crosshatched pattern-burnishing occurs as well. In addition, they sometimes carry in- cised patterns of crosshatching or herringbone. Shapes are simple and consist mainly of small bowls and angle-necked jars. The Dark-Faced Burnished ware (e.g., fig. 10: 14) differs from the gray pottery in both technological and typological terms, and clay analyses have made it clear that these vessels are im- ported from western Syria or southeastern Turkey.32 In shape and finish, the ceramics closely resemble those found at sites like TellJudaidah, Mersin, Sakge G6zii, and, more recently, Tell Aray.33 The pottery has a reddish-brown to grayish or black paste and surface color, contains mineral inclusions of rather large size, and is carefully burnished (an unburnished variety occurs occasionally as well). Some vessels are incised or have broad bands of red paint. Shapes mainly consist of rather large angle-necked jars. Of special interest is the small sample of so-called Fine ware, comprising around 6% of the ceramic bulk. This pottery is absent from the lower levels of occupation at Sabi Abyad and seems to represent a true innovation in local ceramic production.34 The finely textured and mineral-tempered pottery con- sists of various kinds of bowls and small jars of the angle-neck type (fig. 10: 17-18, 20-21), which have a brown to orange or buff surface color and are often burnished. The majority of these ceramics (ca. 66%) are decorated, either painted or, less commonly, in- cised or painted and incised. The paint is matt, and reddish-brown to black in color. The emphasis of decoration is on the vessel's neck and upper body and mainly consists of horizontal bands enclosing geometric designs in narrow zones (crosshatching, chevrons, zigzags, herringbone, etc.). Naturalistic de- signs, showing horned animals, are found in very small numbers (e.g., fig. 10: 21). In general terms, the pottery found in the Burnt Village at Sabi Abyad has its best counterparts in western regions such as coastal Syria and south- eastern Turkey. The busily painted Fine ware, how- ever, shows close parallels with that of the Samarra and, perhaps, Hassuna cultures of northern Meso- potamia.35 At Sabi Abyad, this pottery antedates the appearance of genuine Early Halaf ceramics and is seen as a transitional kind of pottery, intermediate in context between the lower Neolithic strata of oc- cupation and the upper Early Halaf levels. In this respect, Sabi Abyad provides the first clear evidence for the origin of Halaf pottery and shows that the Syrian Jezirah formed part of the Halaf homelands. 31 See Akkermans, "Prehistoric Pottery" (supra n. 10) 77-213; Akkermans; Akkermans and Le Miere 8-10. 32 See M.

Consequently, the commonly assumed spread of the Halaf cultural tradition from one re- gion to another in the form of migration, trade, or "cultural diffusion"'37 in the early fifth millennium finds little or no further support; it seems more likely that the Halaf arose locally and more or less simul- taneously out of Neolithic cultures found over much of its later range.38 LITHIC INDUSTRY In 1991-1992, very rich samples of flint and ob- sidian artifacts from level 6 were recovered that are still under study, so the following report is only an interim evaluation. The flint material is in very bad condition due to burning, while this does not ap- pear to have affected the obsidian element. In cer- tain areas large numbers of flints are blackened, calcined, and fractured or shattered into tiny frag- ments and dust. For this reason precise counts of artifacts in level 6 as a whole are subjective. Counts for the tool types are also subjective given the fact that damage caused by heat as well as trampling in a village situation could account for many of the arti- facts classified as having "fine or semi-abrupt retouch." In the flint samples the debitage consists mainly of flakes, with blades being markedly fewer and al- most always broken into sections. The cores are worked down and often reshaped, suggesting that the tools were fashioned and repaired on the site. The flint tools are classified conventionally, using a list of types published earlier.39 It is already clear that the tool-kit consists of "domestic" types such as scrapers, borers or drills, burins, notches, and den- ticulates, as well as composites of the same; these together form almost half of the tools. In the scraper group the tabular scrapers, or "tile knives," are no- table for their extreme thinness (3 mm on average). Agricultural tools such as picks are scarce, and lustered sickle-blade elements are neither common nor well made. Weapons are virtually absent but a javelin fragment, expertly pressure-flaked on both faces, is worthy of note. The obsidian industry consists mainly of numer- ous irregularly retouched or unretouched small blades, most often deliberately broken into sections. In contrast, certain types are present that, as we now begin to recognize, are northern Fertile Crescent spe- cialities. Side-blow blade flakes (SBBF) and cores form almost a third of the obsidian tools. SBBFs ap- pear to characterize Pottery Neolithic assemblages in northeastern Syria and northern Iraq, e.g., at Kash- kashok (mainly on the surface), Bouqras, and Umm Dabaghiyah (upper levels). At Sabi Abyad, SBBFs be- gin before level 6 and continue to be plentiful in the upper transitional layers, levels 5 and 4. Another early type occurs, although very rarely: the corner- thinned blade (CTB), as defined by Nishiaki.40 Its presence in level 6 forms a link with the underlying earlier Neolithic phases at Sabi Abyad, e.g., level 11 of trench P15, where this tool type forms about 40% of the obsidian tools. CTBs were numerous at earlier NeolithicJezirah sites, such as Kashkashok, Assouad, and Abu Hureyra. The presence of these "special" obsidian types in level 6 may indicate that they were popular for a longer span here than in the east. Inter- pretations differ as to whether they are tools or waste, and if tools, what their function was. SEALINGS AND TOKENS Among the most exciting finds from the houses of the Burnt Village are the ca. 275 clay sealings with stamp-seal impressions and the small tokens that may have served as calculi. The earliest sealings in clay previously known stem from the final stage of the Halaf period, i.e., from the early fifth millennium B.C., and have been found at very few sites only.41 Arpachiyah produced 26 sealings in and around the TT6 Burnt House, whereas three examples were found in the trenches in area A and the Northeast Base at Tepe Gawra and another 40, in a very late Halaf context, at Khirbet Derak.42 In general the ori- gin of true sealings has been looked for in the'Ubaid 36 Campbell (supra n. 2); Campbell (supra n. 9). 7 See, e.g., Davidson (supra n. 8); Hijara (supra n. 8) 259; Mellaart (supra n. 3) 277; A.L.

Selection of clay sealings with stamp-seal impressions, all from room 6 in building II culture of northern Iraq43 but this now appears to be incorrect: these items were already extensively used in the later sixth millennium B.C. The sealings at Sabi Abyad (fig. 11) consist of lumps of clay originally placed on the fastening of various kinds of containers or covering their opening en- tirely. The reverse sides show that mainly ceramics and baskets were sealed but stone bowls, mats, and sacks originally carried sealings as well. The vast ma- jority of the sealings were subsequently provided with one or more stamp-seal impressions. In this manner they secured the containers against unauthorized opening, whereas at the same time they may have carried information on the contents, destination, or ownership of the containers. One of the sealings fitted a small oval bowl made of gabbro (fig. 12); both were found in the same house but in different rooms.44 The thick and roughly finished sealing, carrying several complete stamp-seal impressions of rather complex design, hid the larger part of the bowl from view. Its interior clearly shows the incised bands of the bowl in negative. It is not known what was originally stored in this vessel but when taking into account that the contents were kept or trans- ported in apparently very small quantities in a sealed and precious container, there can be little doubt that they were of high value. The sealings show a wide variety of designs. Until now, 26 different motifs have been recognized, most of which are geometric (zigzag lines, triangles, con- centric circles, diamonds, crosshatching, etc.), but naturalistic representations (animals and plants) are found as well. Some designs occur only once or twice, whereas others are found in considerable numbers. Very common are male goats or gazelles, depicted in a lively manner with long, curving horns and with great attention to detail (fig. 11: 1-2, 4, and 6). De- serving special attention are the repeatedly found 43 See, e.g., D.H. Caldwell, "The Glyptic of Gawra, Giyan and Susa and the Development of Long Distance Trade," Orientalia 45 (1976) 227-50; B.

Facial features are not rendered except for the long-drawn, sharply de- lineated eyes with pronounced eyebrows. It appears on the basis of the size, shape, and de- sign of the various impressions that at least 61 differ- ent stamp seals were used for sealing purposes. Re- markably enough, however, not a single stamp seal was found in the houses of the Burnt Village.45 Per- haps the actual seals were precious items carried by the owners, who had left the site at the time of ? , ., , , .. . .

Clay sealing with human representation from building II its destruction.46 It may also be the case that the seals were made of perishable materials such as bone or wood.47 In this respect it is interesting to note that in one case cowrie shells had been used for seal- ing purposes. Although we have little doubt that stamp seals were indeed known to the Sabi Abyad inhabitants and used by them, it is most unlikely that the sealings found so far were locally produced. The seals and sealings were not meaningless features but, on the contrary, represented a mode of communi- cation enabling the emission and reception of mes- sages (e.g., origin, destination, contents) in a stylized, symbolic manner. Evidently, the smaller the distance in space and time between emitter and recipient of the messages, the more redundant the stylistically transmitted information would be. Within small social units, such as the site of Sabi Abyad, infor- mation exchange proceeds more effectively and at lower cost through other modes of communication (e.g., simple verbal agreements). The sealing of goods, therefore, is mainly of importance if these goods are transferred to different or remote spheres.48 In the case of Sabi Abyad the actual sealing probably did not take place at the site itself but was carried out 45 Thus far, stamp seals have appeared only in some- what later levels of occupation at Sabi Abyad. Two examples were found in a level 4 context, whereas a third one stems from a pre-Halaf level in one of the trenches in the north- eastern area: Akkermans 85; Akkermans and Le Miere 10, 21. 46 Many stamp seals have perforated ridge handles or seem to have been used as pendants; see von Wickede (supra n. 41) for a detailed overview. Burials at third-millennium Shahr-i Sokhta showed that at that site seals were origi- nally worn around the wrist; see P. Ferioli, E. Fiandra, and S. Tusa, "Stamp Seals and the Functional Analysis of Their Sealings at Shahr-i Sokhta II-III (2700-2200 B.C.)," South Asian Archaeology 1975 (1979) 7-26. 47 A few seals made of bone, paste, and terracotta were found earlier at Tepe Gawra; see Tobler (supra n. 42) 178. 48 P.

The tokens (fig. 14) are all very small and have simple geometric shapes, e.g., balls, cylinders, discs, and cones. Most likely they acted as counting devices ex- pressing the quantities of objects exchanged or other- wise deployed.51 The sealings and tokens were found in three build- ings: the rectangular features II and V and the cir- cular structure VI. They were not mere refuse ran- domly distributed throughout these structures but seem to have been deliberately taken out of circu- lation and stored, together with numerous other small items, in specific rooms (room 6 in building II, rooms 6 and 7 in building V, and compartments 2, 3, and 4 in tholos VI). The abundant occurrence of sealings at Sabi Abyad and their careful storage in "archives" suggest that these objects were part of a widely accepted, standardized system of adminis- tration and recognition, involving well-developed concepts of ownership and the presence of bureau- cratic means to control it. Many of the sealings have impressions made by the same seal and, most likely, 4 An extensive program of clay analyses is planned to test this assumption.

Selection of unbaked clay human and animal figurines from building II (room 6: 2-3, 5-8, 11), building V (room 7: 1, 4, 9, 12-13), and tholos VI (compartment 2: 10) the same person or institution. It therefore seems that each sealing agency repeatedly sent goods marked with its seal to Sabi Abyad. In this instance, the sealings may have served as markers of origin or dispatch but, alternatively, it may be the case that these identical seal impressions should be seen as markers of address identifying the site receiving the sealed products52 or as indicators of contents.53 The small area excavated discourages any far- reaching conclusions but it may very well be that the present distribution of sealings is part of a more extensive, community-wide pattern, implying that access to the trade network was not restricted to a few individuals only but was open to the community at Sabi Abyad as a whole. In other words, receipt of the sealed goods or objects at Sabi Abyad seems not to have been centrally organized but, on the contrary, was in the hands of many persons. The wide variety of seals apparently in use also suggests that numer- ous people were involved in the sealing and the associated consignment of commodities.54 Conse- quently, it is unlikely that the Sabi Abyad sealings served in some kind of status or prestige contexts or were the product of elite relationships. HUMAN AND ANIMAL FIGURINES Dozens of very schematically rendered human figurines were found, together with some animal rep- resentations (fig. 15). With very few exceptions, these figurines all came from the "archive room" in build- ing II and from rooms 6-7 in building V. Apparently, they formed part of the more valued or intimate be- longings of the house owners but, curiously, in the case of the human figurines it is usually only the lower body that has been preserved. The upper part and the head seem often to have been intentionally 52 Cf. Charvait (supra n. 48) 58. 5 The last two possibilities imply that each sealing agency may have had many seals, each for different pur- poses (if, that is, one assumes that exchange took place on a considerable scale, involving numerous sites, which each produced or received various commodities, and, fur- thermore, that access to a specific product was not restricted to a specific sealing agency only). 54 But see n. 53.</page><page sequence="22">26 PETER M.M.G.

Selected basalt ground stone implements (1-5, 8-11) and two vessels of fine-grained limestone (6) and chlorite (7) broken off, perhaps for ritual purposes, and were either subsequently discarded or stored elsewhere. So far, only one head has been recovered, long-drawn and conical in shape with oblong eyes set obliquely (fig. 15: 12). Some figurines had a hole in the neck (fig. 15: 1, 4, 7), suggesting that the head was sepa- rately added and fitted onto the body by means of a dowel.55 The human figurines are all made of sun-dried clay and invariably depict women. Virtually all show a thin vertical incision near the base, indicating the vulva, and in some cases the breasts are clearly marked. Most figurines have a narrow waist, where- as the hips and belly are of a considerably exag- gerated size. The limbs are rarely indicated. In one case the right arm is rendered and seems to support the breasts (fig. 15: 10). Horizontally incised bands and other impressions perhaps served to indicate clothes. So far, the closest parallels for these figurines have been found at the Hassunan site of Yarim Tepe I in northern Iraq.56 In addition to the anthropomorphic representa- tions, crudely shaped animal figurines, all made of sun-dried clay, were found in small numbers (fig. 15: 14). All figurines were considerably damaged but the heads, legs, and tails are still clearly recognizable. Some of the animals seem to have had horns and perhaps represent bulls. OTHER SMALL FINDS Small objects other than figurines, sealings, and tokens were found in large quantities in the houses of the Burnt Village. Hundreds of stone objects of all kinds appeared, made of a wide variety of raw materials, some of which were locally available (e.g., limestone, gypsum, sandstone, quartzite),57 whereas 55 Earlier a somewhat similar but painted figurine with a removable or revolving head was found in one of the Early Halaf levels at Sabi Abyad: Akkermans 1987, Paleori- ent (supra n. 1) 33, pl.

Mulders, The Arid Soils of the Balikh Basin (Utrecht 1969); Akkermans 274.</page><page sequence="23">1995] THE BURNT VILLAGE AT LATE NEOLITHIC SABI ABYAD 27 :: 2h ?AM S 1C6 S~ ~-~- 0 CCM 4 411 85 &lt;O 10 cm0 1 I o 1" 12lo 1 Fig. 17. Selected stone (1-3), bone (4-7), and clay (8-12) objects: 1) reused basalt grinding slab, grooved and incised; 2-3) limestone and dolerite celts; 4-7) bone spatula, awls, and incised implement; 8-10) clay spindle whorls; 11-12) ceramic pierced discs. others must have come from regions far away, such as the Euphrates valley or the Turkish piedmont near Urfa (e.g., basalt, dolerite, granodiorite, serpentinite, chlorite, granite, and steatite). Apart from basalt, which was commonly used for the production of ground stone tools (such as flattened grinding slabs, pestles, and grinders of varying sizes and shapes, and rather thick-walled mortars), the non-indigenous materials were each found in minute quantities and seem to be largely restricted to "luxury items" like small, carefully finished bowls and personal adorn- ments (beads, pendants, and labrets). Carving or manufacturing debris was entirely lacking, thus sug- gesting that these items reached the site in finished form (perhaps as part of the exchange network) or that production was restricted to specific and as yet unexcavated parts of the site. Grinding implements, made of basalt and to a lesser extent limestone, granodiorite, flint, and sand- stone, are among the most commonly found items in the Burnt Village (fig. 16). The grinding slabs have an oval or rounded shape, a convex base, and a flat or slightly concave working surface. Pestles and handstones come in many different dimensions and shapes (fig. 16: 1-5). Most are conical but cylin- drical or spherical ones were found as well. Mortars appear in two varieties, one portable and consisting of simple bowls with thick, slightly incurving sides and flat bases (fig. 16: 9-11), and the other more ir- regularly shaped and sunk into the floor. These grind- ing tools often show very smoothed and polished surfaces resulting from intensive use. In addition to these worked items, a number of unworked but very smooth stone objects were found, which, accord- ing to their wear marks, seem to have served as grind- ing slabs or working platforms. At least one of these was used as a palette, as shown by the traces of red ocher and dark-blue pigment on its surface. The com- mon occurrence of ocher traces on pestles, mortars, and grinding slabs and the presence of small pieces of ocher on the floor in some rooms suggest that this kind of pigment was widely used at Sabi Abyad, perhaps for body embellishment or the decoration of ceramics and other artifacts.58 Shallow to deep carefully finished stone bowls were found in rather small quantities59 and were made of a wide variety of raw materials, such as limestone, alabaster, gypsum, dolerite, serpentinite, chlorite, and steatite. The natural banding of some of these ma- terials seems to have been sought for its decorative effects. One bowl carried an incised pattern, display- ing a horned animal (fig. 16: 7). The various vessels have flat or concave bases and flaring straight or rounded walls (occasionally slightly curving inward at the rim), with plain, flat, or beaded rims. In one case a small, horizontally pierced lug is present (fig. 16: 6). Some bowls have evidence of repair holes or of bitumen adhering to the interior surface. Thirteen small celts (fig. 17: 2-3) were recovered from the various buildings, most of them (8) made 58 Ocher may have had ritual connotations as well, as is suggested by its presence in a child burial ascribed to level 5 at Sabi Abyad. 59 In view of the specific nature and preservation of the Burnt Village, one would expect the stone bowls recovered from the various houses to be complete or, at least, wholly restorable but, curiously, all vessels except one were in a fragmentary state. Perhaps these fragments should be con- sidered as household waste or even as intrusive elements included in the clay used for wall construction. Post- depositional disturbance is another possibility.</page><page sequence="24">28 PETER M.M.G. AKKERMANS AND MARC VERHOEVEN [AJA 99 of fine-grained gray-black dolerite, the remainder of quartzite, serpentinite, and limestone. The celts are wedge-shaped and heavily polished, with the sharp cutting edge in all but two cases seriously damaged from domestic use. The two exceptions are very small (hardly 3 cm thick), carefully finished, and in perfect condition, perhaps suggesting that these objects served in luxury or ritual contexts. Some types of stone objects occurred only once or twice, such as a carefully finished gypsum mace- head or a palm-sized and reused grinding slab frag- ment of fine-grained basalt with a wide, shallow groove and finely incised linear and arrow-like pat- terns on both sides (fig. 17: 1). A somewhat similar grooved implement, but made of soft limestone and displaying a deeply incised zigzag pattern, came from level 5 at Sabi Abyad. Elsewhere, too, such grooved stones with or without decoration have been found, e.g., at sixth-millennium Tell Judaidah in the Amuq or, from a much earlier time, at eighth-millennium Q(ay6nii in Anatolia.60 Perhaps these objects served for the production of some kinds of stone tools or for the straightening of arrow shafts. Implements made of bone consist of simple awls and, to a lesser extent, spatulas and burins (fig. 17: 4-6). The awls were all made of caprid metapodia, and the other tools of the ribs or tibia of sheep, goat, or cattle. A small piece of worked bone from build- ing IV shows cut marks of varying length at small intervals and perhaps served as a rattle or counting device (tally; fig. 17: 7). Similar items were recovered from other levels at Sabi Abyad and are also reported from sites such as Yarim Tepe I and Yarim Tepe II in Iraq.61 Objects serving for personal adornment, such as beads, pendants, and labrets, were often found in isolation and in rather limited numbers; most of these items were probably worn on the body and left the site at the time of destruction together with their owners. The small beads, disc-like or cylindri- cal in shape, are all made of fine-grained stones, like serpentinite, obsidian, breccia, or, perhaps, tur- quoise, and varied in color from black to red-brown, green, and white. The shells of small land snails were occasionally used as pendants, as was a fragment of a freshwater mussel (Unio). The latter is more or less rectangular in shape with a rounded, protruding top, carrying two tiny perforations. Labrets, most likely serving as lip or ear ornaments,62 are made of both stone and sun-dried clay. Dolerite is the kind of stone most often used but other fine-grained materials like calcite, serpentinite, and chlorite were in use as well. Some of these labrets have a squat appearance with a flat, slightly protruding top and flattened base, whereas others are taller in shape with a somewhat protruding flat or convex head and pointed base. Other small finds include oval-shaped discs or lids, biconical sling missiles, and either conical or, more often, biconical spindle whorls, all made of sun-dried clay and found in considerable quantities (fig. 17: 8-10). Very common, too, are small perforated discs (3 or 4 cm in diameter) made of chipped sherds or occasionally stone (fig. 17: 11-12). A unique find is a small clay "whistle" fragment found in the upper fill of building V. This hollow and cylindrical object, with at least one small, circular hole, is somewhat comparable to the cigar-shaped item found at Has- sunan Yarim Tepe I and interpreted by its excavators as a whistle.63 A most interesting find are two small pieces of copper ore (malachite), which must have come from mountainous southeastern Anatolia. One of these fragments was found in the fill of room 3 of building III, the other in a debris layer west of this room. These finds may indicate that copper was processed at Sabi Abyad as early as 5200 B.C., albeit on a very modest scale. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS The Burnt Village is among the most important discoveries made so far at prehistoric Tell Sabi Abyad. Its contents and unique circumstances of preserva- tion allow not only a detailed insight into late sixth- millennium settlement layout and associated mate- rial culture but they also provide exciting new clues to the general development of later Neolithic soci- ety in a hitherto poorly known region of the Near 6o Braidwood and Braidwood (supra n. 32) 90, fig. 66.2; and M.K.

In this respect the research at Sabi Abyad con- tributes considerably to the current debate concern- ing the rise of the Halaf culture somewhere around 5200/5100 B.C., which has long been considered to be of crucial importance as an intermediate stage between early village economies and the formation of cities and states. As pointed out above, the Burnt Village is the earliest of the so-called transitional levels at Sabi Abyad, intermediate between the lower Neolithic phases of occupation and the topmost levels thought to represent the very beginnings of the Halaf era in the region. The Burnt Village, with its dense agglomeration of houses largely identical in layout and alignment, is the most outstanding ex- ample of local community organization known for this period, but it represents only one phase within a long and continuous sequence.64 The houses are each of considerable size and have many small rooms, which seem to have been used for various purposes. The size and composition of the groups inhabiting or using each of these build- ings can only be guessed at for the moment. The rather large amount of available space may have ex- ceeded the needs of small, nuclear family groups and should perhaps be taken as an indication that the houses gave shelter to extended households. Fur- thermore, the restrictions placed on circulation through the buildings and the partitioning of the structures into many small rooms may suggest that each of these extended families was divided into two or three domestic units, each occupying a particu- lar area for living or performing special activities. The striking regularity and careful planning underlying the construction of the Burnt Village seem to adhere closely to late seventh- and early sixth- millennium settlement organization found else- where in northeastern Syria, most notably at Tell Bouqras on the Euphrates, where the highly struc- tured buildings, conceived of and raised along cer- tain fixed principles, were seen as indicators of emerging social control.65 A direct relationship has often been emphasized between architectural design and complexity of society66 but others have argued that apparently sophisticated and regular patterns of building may easily have been a derivative of very simple structuring principles.67 If the architecture at Sabi Abyad can be taken as typical of the settlement as a whole, however, and if furthermore the highly uniform layout of the houses indeed reflects some sort of control, such con- trol must have served to emphasize traditional values and social coherence. The houses reflect little idio- syncratic variability but instead were constructed ac- cording to shared principles or traditions focusing on repetition and invariance. Such traditions are not random but serve to organize and bind together a society; at the same time they allow the immediate recognition of deviating social behavior. In this sense tradition is a device of social control, which, how- ever, in the hands of the elite may easily become an instrument of power: a tradition is always based upon past experiences that subsequently can be used to legitimize and naturalize the present status quo. Any unequal social relationship may thus be presented as part of the natural order; it attains the status of ever-existing and non-discussable.68 The uniform character of the houses of the Burnt Village thus may have been the mere facade of an imaginary social equality, protecting a much more complex and non- egalitarian society from evaluation. The very richness of the materials recovered from the Burnt Village at Sabi Abyad suggests that socio- economic diversity and complexity in the late sixth millennium B.C. considerably surpassed that of earlier Neolithic communities in the Balikh re- gion. The excavations at late seventh- to early sixth- 64 Earlier it was pointed out that there seems to have been a hiatus in occupation between the lowest level 11 and the subsequent level 10 at Sabi Abyad. From level 10 onward, however, settlement was continuous and uninterrupted. 65 Cf. PA. Akkermans, H. Fokkens, and H.T. Waterbolk, "Stratigraphy, Architecture and Layout of Bouqras," in J.

AKKERMANS AND MARC VERHOEVEN [AJA 99 millennium Damishliyya and Assouad have made clear that these sites were largely autonomous, self- supporting entities, with only limited socioeconomic ties outside the community.69 The Burnt Village, on the other hand, was part of extensive networks of long- and short-distance exchange, and its inhabitants maintained relationships with groups of people in distant areas, such as the coastal regions of the Levant, the piedmont of southeastern Turkey, and the plains of Mesopotamia. Moreover, the finds from the Burnt Village have made it clear that its inhab- itants were able to mobilize and exploit these exter- nal resources in a regular manner and to a consid- erable extent, i.e., beyond the level of incidental transactions. The hundreds of sealings found in the small area thus far excavated, probably representing only a minor part of the overall settlement at Sabi Abyad, suggest that foreign commodities came in very large numbers, either the result of reciprocal exchange or as tributes and gifts.70 Ethnographic evidence emphasizes the importance of gift-giving in patron-client relationships7' but the likelihood that gifts contributed significantly to the wealth of the Sabi Abyad population is doubtful: where would the gifts have come from, after all? Evidence for con- trol of territory other than the immediate surround- ings of the site is poorly documented; if the com- munity at Sabi Abyad was able to exercise some sort of political power allowing the extraction of tribute, such control can hardly have extended beyond the limits of the Balikh basin. Survey evidence from the region of concern suggests that only four or five sites existed around 5200 B.C. and any evidence for a hier- archical order or pattern of dependency among these sites is absent.72 If politically defined gifts, then, seem to have played a minor role only, it appears that it was mainly exchange networks that underlay the prosperity of the community at Sabi Abyad. A key innovation accompanying this prosperity is the use of seals and sealings, which served to mark property and thus allowed a certain degree of control over the exchange networks. It has been argued above that this control mechanism emerged much earlier than currently as- sumed, most likely around the middle of the sixth millennium B.C. or shortly afterward, in the centuries following the intermittent disruption of settlement in the first half of the millennium. Potentially, all groups at Sabi Abyad could participate equally in the exchange transactions. In our discussion above of the Sabi Abyad sealings, we suggested that many people must have been involved in both the consign- ment and subsequent receipt of the sealed goods, and that access to these commodities was not nec- essarily restricted to a specific segment of society only. On the other hand, it seems obvious that any elite group would pursue differentiated access to the exchange networks; exclusion of the commoners en- ables leaders to mobilize considerably more wealth and prestige to their economic and social advantage and transforms the networks in devices of social power.73 In the case of Sabi Abyad, however, solid evidence for this kind of power struggle, based on differences in access to exchange commodities and the associated rise of an increasingly hierarchical organization within the site, is absent. The lack of evidence for obvious institutions of power at the site suggests that social differentiation was of a more modest level. The exchange network must have involved some sort of reciprocity; received goods had to be coun- terbalanced by local items given in return. The local economy, then, must have surpassed mere subsistence needs and enabled the generation and extraction of a surplus. Given the virtual absence of natural resources other than fertile lands and extensive pas- ture areas, the origin and nature of this surplus most likely should be sought in the returns of agriculture and animal husbandry. Such returns have been dis- cussed elsewhere in detail for the Early Halaf settle- ment at Sabi Abyad.74 Agriculture alone, however, was hardly sufficient to fulfill even the basic subsis- tence needs of the local population, much less sup- port the production of surplus.75 Stockbreeding, 69 Akkermans 320. 70 Recently Charvait has commented on the possible re- lationship between the practices of sealing and gift-giving; see P.

If, on the other hand, irrigation or restricted</page><page sequence="27">1995] THE BURNT VILLAGE AT LATE NEOLITHIC SABI ABYAD 31 then, must have been of ultimate importance; only extensive animal husbandry, in combination with agriculture, could have provided the local economy the much-wanted surplus for exchange purposes. Even if it were not the basic subsistence products (cereals, meat, wools, hides, etc.) that were traded but the results of local craftsmanship instead (e.g., textiles or ceramics), a surplus from farming and animal husbandry surely provided the means to pro- duce these craft items.76 Long-distance exchange can hardly have been based upon staple goods, given the later Neolithic technology of transport. More likely it involved the circulation in small quantities of luxury goods and raw materials- exclusive ceram- ics, precious stones, metal ores, and various finished articles of perishable nature.77 The sealings make it clear that in many cases it was not (or not exclu- sively) the containers but their contents that were exchanged. Whereas some of these products entered daily life in the form of domestic utensils, others perhaps hint at attempts to gain prestige by conspic- uous consumption.7' It is not yet clear what caused the final destruc- tion of the level 6 community at Sabi Abyad. Was it merely a tragic accident or was it perhaps due to a deliberate act of violence imposed by outsiders? There is no evidence for a skirmish or massacre nor does it appear that the village was plundered and emptied of its riches. The inhabitants do not appear to have tried to recover possessions buried in the ruins, as one would expect in the case of an acci- dent. On the other hand, we have the impression that some categories of material, particularly lux- ury items such as personal adornments, seals, and finely painted pottery, are present in much smaller quantities than one would expect in the case of a fully preserved domestic context. Perhaps the Sabi Abyad inhabitants were able to remove part of the original inventory before destruction, on the whole leaving only the least valuable or least portable items behind. Subsequently, the remains of the Burnt Village seem to have been abandoned, and replaced later by a new settlement partly founded upon the still standing remains of the earlier one. Occupation then gradually lost its aggregative character, becom- ing more open and dispersed in nature, with one or two rectangular buildings on the top of the mound and surrounded by auxiliary structures on the slopes. For example, the large building ascribed to Early Halaf level 3, enforced by buttresses along its exterior facade and possibly with a second story,79 stood in an isolated, almost fortified manner and has little in common with the very regularly built, tripartite houses of the Burnt Village. The changes in house plan are associated with an increasing use of stone8s and, remarkably, mudbrick instead of pise for con- struction purposes. At Sabi Abyad mudbricks were first introduced in the transitional level 4, dated around 5100/5050 B.C., but, as pointed out above, their occurrence is not so much a genuine innova- tion as a reintroduction of a much older and already existing building practice in the region.8' In this respect it seems that the appearance of Halaf in the Balikh region induced a break in local building traditions. New materials were used for the construction of new types of houses that entirely re- placed the earlier ones and more properly fulfilled the apparently changing needs of society. On the other hand, it is clear that this break with the past was not fully sustained. The best evidence for archi- tectural continuity is presented by the tholoi. These structures, long considered to be one of the main characteristics of Halaf society, were not a Halafian "invention" but belong to a much older Neolithic tra- dition. Excavations at sites such as Tell Hassuna and Yarim Tepe I had already yielded tholoi in early sixth- intensified cultivation on naturally flooded land was prac- ticed, a considerable surplus may have been generated. At present, however, there is no evidence for irrigation or the like in the late sixth-millennium Balikh valley: Akker- mans 223-25. 76 A surplus from farming allows at least part of the community to spend time on activities other than hard labor in the fields. 77 A good example is the small sealed stone vessel found in building II (fig. 12) but ceramic containers, too, seem to have been rather small, judging from the impression of their rim diameters on the sealings. 78 Or, in the words of Robert Drennan, "trade or ex- change at long distance ... provided the plumes of the chiefly peacock, not its basic diet"; R.D. Drennan, "Pre- Hispanic Chiefdom Trajectories in Mesoamerica, Central America and Northern South America," in Earle (supra n. 73) 281. 79 See Akkermans 56ff; Akkermans and Le Miere 11-18. 80o Particularly gypsum blocks, which must have come from the Pleistocene terraces 5-10 km east of Sabi Abyad. 81 At present, it remains unknown whether the use of mudbricks was wholly abandoned in the Balikh region in the first half of the sixth millennium or whether its ab- sence is limited to Sabi Abyad. If the former, the Halafian people themselves may have seen the renewed use of mud- bricks as a truly innovative procedure.</page><page sequence="28">32 P.M.M.G. AKKERMANS AND M. VERHOEVEN, THE BURNT VILLAGE AT SABI ABYAD millennium Hassunan contexts.82 Sabi Abyad, with its level 6 tholoi, now wholly confirms this picture.83 In addition to the altering pattern of settlement and building tradition, profound changes took place in artifact assemblages, of which the foremost is the rapidly increasing importance of fine painted pot- tery.84 On the basis of the stratigraphic evidence and the available radiocarbon dates, it appears that this transition, which must have had a considerable im- pact upon the overall organization of society, took place fairly rapidly and was completed within a few generations, between ca. 5200 and 5100 B.C.
