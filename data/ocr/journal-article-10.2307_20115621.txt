<plain_text><page sequence="1">SCOTT A. KLEINER PROBLEM SOLVING AND DISCOVERY IN THE GROWTH OF DARWIN'S THEORIES OF EVOLUTION* 1. INTRODUCTION H. A. Simon has argued that the process of law discovery' can be described and theorized about and that we can give a normative account of relatively efficient ways of engaging in this process. He (i) claims that scientific discovery is a form of problem solving and (ii) suggests that a philosophical account of scientific discovery could be developed from the theory of the design of problem-solving pro cedures for artificial intelligence (Simon [22]). Simon defends his points by considering the process by which one might 'discover' the pattern behind the sequence of letters ABMCDMEFM_ He distinguishes between two tasks, (1) the discovery of the pattern by which the letters in any part of the sequence are written and (2) showing that the pattern holds as the sequence is indefinitely extended. But he tells us: Law discovery means only finding the pattern in the data that have been observed; whether the pattern will continue to hold for new data that are observed subsequently will be decided in the course of testing the law, not discovering it ([22] p. 331). Here Simon draws an important distinction between the problems of induction and discovery, problems that have been muddled together by early and naive inductivist philosophers. His and our concern is with the latter problem. As Simon acknowledges, this example is not science, although he also points out that Mendeleev's periodic table has a structure similar to the sequence of letters. However, he offers no 'microscopic study' of the history of Mendeleev's discovery in order to sustain his thesis that the process of scientific discovery is similar to or can be illuminated by problem-solving programs for artificial intelligence.

KLEINER The purpose of this paper is to test Simon's thesis by offering just such a microscopic study. I have chosen Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection as the case to be studied because clear stages in the growth of Darwin's ideas are readily accessible in his private notebooks. Stages in the development of Kepler's theory of Mars' motion are equally available and clear, but they have been extensively studied (e.g. Hanson [9]) and will not be discussed here. I shall begin with an exposition of certain basic conceptions of problems and search methods for solving problems as appear in recent literature on artificial intelligence. Then I shall consider several obvious stages in the development of Darwin's theory of evolution and whether Simon's thesis regarding creative research as typical problem-solving activity can be sustained as philosophically illumina ting. 2. PROBLEMS, SEARCH PROCEDURES AND HEURISTICS A 'well structured problem' (WSP) - i.e. a problem that is optimally specified for problem solving programs - as conceived in the literature on artificial intelligence has the following features (Simon [22], Nils son ([17]): 1. There is a well-defined problem space in which is repre sented the initial problem state, the goal state and other states that may be reached or considered while attempting a solution of the problem. The problem space is a representation of information relevant to and presupposed by the problem. This representation should include substantive information constututing the 'starting point' from which research should proceed - the initial problem state - as well as opera tors for generating further possibilities to be searched, and a specification of an optimal state to be reached-the goal state. 2. Attainable state changes - legal' moves in the development of the problem toward a solution-are represented as transitions from a given state, at first the initial state, to states directly attainable from them. These legal transitions are specified by a set of operators that transform one state to a number of successor states. These components of problems are exemplified in a puzzle we knew as children, the puzzle consisting of eight numbered tiles</page><page sequence="3">PROBLEM SOLVING AND DISCOVERY 121 arranged in a 3 x 3 array leaving one empty space that allows the movement of the tiles in two dimensions. An initial state of a problem for this puzzle would be the initial configuration of the tiles from which all subsequent moves are made. The goal state is a specified arrangement of tiles normally differing from the initial state, e.g., an arrangement in which the tiles are numbered in rows successively from left to right with the empty space in the center of the array. The operators that define moves permitted in the search for the goal state are those that in effect move a tile up, down, to the left or to the right in a two dimensional plane. 3. There is a definite criterion for testing any proposed solution and an effective procedure-i.e., a recursive and mechanizable procedure - for applying this criterion. That is, in addition to specifying the goal state as an optimal state in the problem space, there must be criteria and procedural rules for applying the criteria that guarantee recognition of the goal when it is achieved. 4. The basic processes postulated-i.e., the operators specified-in the problem require only practicable amounts of computation and all rel?vent information is available to these processes with only practi cable amounts of search. In his discussion of ill structured problems' (ISP's) Simon is clearly aware that not all problems readily assume the form of those associated with simple puzzles. Yet he claims that ISP's may still be accessible to currently available problem solving programs. He also claims that the boundary between WSP's and ISP's is vague, especi ally as a consequence of the vagueness of 'practicable amounts of computation and search. This vagueness appears to be a consequence of defining WSP's so that they are not restricted to problems for which there are effective solution procedures. As is well known, the latter kind of problem reduces to problems of recursive computation. Most of the more powerful axiomatic systems, e.g., quantification theory with enough strength to embrace elementary number theory, contain problems that are not effectively solvable. A fortiori, we can assume that many significant problems encountered in creative scientific research, excluding purely computational problems, are not effectively solvable. For these problems the line between WSP and ISP can only be arbitrarily drawn. Simon mentions further difficulties in specifying exactly what count</page><page sequence="4">122 SCOTT A. KLEINER as WSP's. These include determining what knowledge is to be in corporated into the problem space as relevant to the problem and its solution. Metalinguistic, analogical and metaphorical information are all useful and sometimes indispensible in the solution of certain problems. Furthermore information relevant to the problem may crop up somewhere in activities directed to the solution of the problem, and this information can change our perception of circumstances relevant to its solution. Thus some modification of the problem space may be required somewhere in the search for a problem's solution. For example, if the problem concerns action or a sequence of actions, as in a game of chess, the consequences of some of these actions could change the state of the world and this state would have to be known for subsequent action to be properly directed. A scientific investigator may learn from those who criticize his initial efforts, he may become aware of forgotten ideas that conflict with those he is presently considering, or, he may come upon new information or become sceptical about old presumed factual information. Accord ingly, the characterization of problems for research in the factual or practical sciences should avoid any final specification of the problem space or the relevant information held prior to searching for the problem's solution (Simon, [19], pp. 307f). Several further comments on the requirements for WSP's are in order if we are to consider programs for setting up and solving WSP's as models for research in the factual sciences: There is no effective procedure for identifying proposed solutions to many problems in the factual sciences. Even if we were all to agree upon criteria for, e.g., an explanation of phylogenic evolution or the elliptical orbits of planets, there is no effective way of showing that these theoretical accounts are unique or final. We cannot effectively decide that there is not some other theoretical account that will explain these phenomena equally well or better according to the criteria by which the goal state in the problem is specified. If a putative explanation is thus superseded or is confronted with a rival with equally good credentials, it no longer solves the problem demanding the explanation of some law or happening. Note that I am not here discussing the problem of induction, for I have not men tioned the truism that there is no effective method for deciding the truth of the theories in question. What I am claiming is that assuming that Darwinian or Newtonian research seeks explanations of certain</page><page sequence="5">PROBLEM SOLVING AND DISCOVERY 123 phenomena, and assuming agreement on what counts as an explana tion, our experience of the history of science has taught us that no explanation is demonstrably unique or final even under these assumptions. However, we can weaken the requirement for effective decision procedures to demanding only that good reasons be given that a proposed solution is unique in meeting goal state criteria. This step introduces an additional source of vagueness into our characterization of WSP's, but that many not diminish the utility of characterizing original scientific research as a form of problem solving. A second comment bears upon our characterizing a problem's goal state as an optimal state in the problem space. I have chosen 'optimal' to indicate that often a value judgment is implicit in the choice of goal states and thus also in the formulation of problems. In the case of games and puzzles such as can be carried out on the 3 x 3 numbered tile toy, the choice of goal states is, for the most part, conventional. However, the choice of goal states for problems demanding theoreti cal explanations, e.g., of phylogenic evolution or planetary orbits, raises fundamental metaphysical and methodological questions, as will be seen below in our discussion of theories of evolution. The procedures for seeking solutions to WSP's already given include (i) the application of the operators given in order to produce successor states from the initial state and (ii) a search covering these successor states to determine if any meet the criteria for the goal state. Note that the expansion procedures (i) are ill-defined if the initial state is ill-defined, even if there is a well-defined set of expansion operators. Hence the set of 'legitimate moves' in the search for a solution is not well-defined for one of Simon's ISP's. Also in search strategies for typical problems in the factual sciences, it is not clear that there are any definite moves to be made from one stage of the search-i.e., one problem-state - to the next. Because the input of information is so important as research proceeds in factual sciences, no such moves can be specified more than one step in advance. If the goal of a WSP is not reached in the first 'generation' of successor states, each of the latter are further expanded into a second generation of such states and the latter generation are again searched for the goal state. Two different expansion procedures may be fol lowed: The families of successor states may be expanded in the order in which they are generated-i.e., each member of each successive</page><page sequence="6">124 SCOTT A. KLEINER generation is expanded into the next generation. This is the breadth first procedure. Secondly, the most recently generated state may be expanded next until either a solution or some unsatisfactory state is reached. This is the depth first strategy (Nilson, [15], pp. 119-123). Since search procedures for the ISP's typical of factual or practical investigations should include the search for informational inputs e.g., new facts, refutations of putative facts, other criticisms - neither procedure of a priori expansion and search of possibilities are ap propriate for such problems. However, we shall see after examining Darwin's search for an explanation of phylogenic evolution that the creative researcher in factual sciences does have the option of pursu ing something analogous to either the depth-first or the breadth-first strategies. Both of the foregoing procedures are called blind search strategies. Both strategies are purely trial-and-error using no heuristic infor mation. However, for WSP's more efficient procedures of search can be specified. The 'efficiency' of these procedures is judged by nor mative standards that Simon claims exemplify principles of the 'logic of discovery'. Strategies using heuristic information include the fol lowing (as compiled from Simon [22] and Nils son [17]): (1) We can use information about promising lines of search to specify more informed expansion operators and thereby reduce the number of successor states to be searched. More specifically, we can compare the current state of the search with the goal state and record the differences between these states. Then we search our memory for operators associated with this difference and subsequently apply only that operator to generate the next states. This is a means-end heuristic similar to the process by which, e.g., a dog chases a rabbit or a missle guides itself to a target. In all of these cases there must be a clear perception of the goal state so that the differences from the present state can be usefully assessed. (2) The space to be searched can be reduced by using the depth first procedure and expanding first those states taken to be promising on the basis of information inherent in the states preceeding the expansion. Thus without being conscious of the end state and the differences between it and the present state one can follow the line of search that, e.g., shows a definite trend in maintaining or optimizing a desired characteristic in contrast to rival paths of search. Lakatos' progressive research programmes exemplify such a characteristic</page><page sequence="7">PROBLEM SOLVING AND DISCOVERY 125 (12), and the strategy of choosing the most progressive line of inquiry fits this heuristic model nicely. (3) A problem may be broken down into component problems. There may be routine or familiar procedures for taking certain steps along a line of search toward the solution of a component problem. Alternatively, the goal state may be found to be composed of sub goals the achievement of which are means to the end represented by the goal state. Simon also suggests that this heuristic is especially appropriate for ISP's that can be broken down into sub-problems with structures closer to the ideal WSP. (4) One might approach a difficult problem by omitting one or more details of the actual problem by abstracting what are provisionally believed to be essential features and then solving these simplified problems. These solutions then can be used as guides or plans for the original problem. This is the strategy used in efforts to construct successively better mathematical models of, e.g., segments of the economy or populations in an ecosystem, and may be called the strategy of progressive modeling. A distinctive characteristic of this heuristic is that the models are not viewed as adequate descriptions or explanations of their subject-matter - usually the shortcomings of the models are obvious or well-known - but only as means of exploring applied mathematical formalisms with the objective of ultimately developing a refined mathematical theory of the subject. (5) One might seek desiderata that fall short of those implicit in the goal state. That is, one could seek justification of provisional solu tions that, although not up to the ideal specified in the original, are 'good enough' for specified purposes or under present technological, social or other circumstances. This strategy could be combined with the preceding allowing one to settle for some 'model' known not to be quite perfect yet provisionally acceptable. (6) Also, in view of problems dealt with by the preceeding two heuristics, we might seek to revise the initial goal state and to justify alternative demands or objectives. Methodological demands can be revised or replaced. Metaphysical 'blueprints' (Maxwell, [15]) may come under criticism. Both are used in spelling out goal states in the search for explanatory theories. Problems in the factual sciences thus can be ill-structured because their goal-states are subject to revision as research proceeds.</page><page sequence="8">126 SCOTT A. KLEINER 3. THE DARWINIAN REVOLUTION AS A PROBLEM SHIFT' We shall confine our concern to Darwin's and Wallace's 'discovery' better described as their 'invention' - of an explanation of evolution, viz. the theory of evolution by natural selection. However, we shall see that their contributions to phylogenesis, the description of the path of evolution, although of secondary interest for us, must be considered as the basis of their formulation of the problem behind their search for an explanatory theory. In this section I shall describe the several problems brought together by Darwin and Wallace and certain logical and theoretical relations among these problems. In the sections that follow, I shall consider in temporal series the problems that evidently occupied Darwin and Wallace in their respective sear ches for the theory of natural selection and the influence that their occupation with these problems had on the direction and progress of their searches. The problem of explaining phylogenic evolution - the 'origin problem' - presupposes the solution of other problems, solutions that Buffon, Lamarck, Cuvier and Lyell, among others, contributed to during the period 1780-1835. Elementary principles of erotetic logic the logic of questions - tell us that without these solutions the origin problem could impose no obligation on investigators, even if it were to occur to them, which would be unlikely under those circumstances. (See [16]). The origin problem as Wallace states it is as follows: To discover how extinct species have from time to time been replaced by new ones down to the very latest geological period, is the most difficult, and at the same time the most interesting problem in the natural history of the earth. (Wallace, [23], p. 14) It should be evident that this problem obligates only those holding the beliefs (i) that some species have become extinct and (ii) that some species existing now did not exist during earlier periods of geological and biological history. Neither of these were widely believed in the eighteenth century, but they gained acceptance in the early nineteenth century largley as a consequence of George Cuvier's studies of fossil mammalian bones brought to Paris. For example, his 1796 paper 'On the species of living and fossil elephants' argued that mammoth and mastodon remains fall outside the range of variation of modern elephant bones. Barring the unlikely event of such large land mam mals residing undetected in remote regions, they were thus shown to be extinct. Cuvier's researches from 1805-1810 on fossils of various</page><page sequence="9">PROBLEM SOLVING AND DISCOVERY 127 ages found in quarries around Paris helped to persuade geologists that many modern species of quadruped have no remains in more ancient fossil bearing strata. Thus it was concluded that these species must have come into existence at some time within the earth's history. (See Lyell, [14], Bk III, Chaps. V, XI) On the other hand, Cuvier's contemporary Lamarck remained committed to the eighteenth century belief that few if any flora and fauna ever became extinct. The differences between present and ancient forms are explained by his theory of phylogenic evolution, according to which species continually alter the forms that tradition ally have defined them as species. Darwin's and Wallace's contributions can be viewed as having the effect of further elaborating the origin problem in two respects: (i) Their views regarding the path of phylogenic evolution rendered more explicit the phenomena for which the origin problem demanded explanation, (ii) They formulated and defended criteria for the solu tion of the origin problem against rival criteria coming from tradi tional biology and religion. Regarding the phenomena, Lamarck sought simply the explanation of apparent differences between present and ancient organic forms, whereas Darwin and Wallace sought the explanation of what they described as branching ancestral relations between living and extinct species where only some of the latter species are represented by present descendents. The deter mination of criteria for a solution is the choice of a goal-state for the origin problem. The choice of a goal state required that they defend metaphysical and methodological principles of a naturalistic biology against such rival principles as underlie the then popular 'natural theological' approach to biology. I shall return to the details of Darwin's and Wallace's naturalism shortly. Darwin and Wallace assembled and transformed several further problems that bore upon their progress toward and their defense of the theory of natural selection. Some of these are as follows: 1. The problem of explaining adaptation - Why are organisms' forms suited to their needs?-had long been of concern to biologists, philosophers and others. William Paley, in his well known and influential Natural Theology (1802), argued for what he took to be the best explanation in citing specific adaptations as evidence for the wisdom and power of God. Paley's natural theology offered an agent-teleological account of adaptation, the kind of explanation</page><page sequence="10">128 SCOTT A. KLEINER Darwin eventually repudiated for evolution and adaptation. Yet Darwin did borrow some of Paley's examples of adaptation in elaborating his own theory. Untimately, Darwin's theory of natural selection explained both adaptation and evolution. 2. Early in his 'Notebooks on Transmutation' Darwin deals with the question of why some species die out. Although this problem ultimately is answered by the theory of natural selection, it is distinct from the origin problem and it also is the subject of repeated comment by Darwin in his notebooks before his mention of Malthus' population theory. The latter point in Darwin's notebooks is com monly taken as marking his first thoughts on natural selection theory, but it appears that the problem of extinction was of more concern to him than the origin problem in the early part of the notebooks. Cuvier was the first to face this problem but was unable to resolve it. He could not explain the extinction of seemingly well-adapted animals without resorting to world-wide catastrophes, but he could only find geological evidence for localized catastrophes such as the incursion of water. Charles Lyell attempted to solve the problem without catastrophes, and we shall see that his attempts were borrowed by Wallace but not immediately embraced by Darwin. 3. The problem that led Darwin and Wallace to phylogenic evolution was that of explaining the geographical distribution of animals throughout the world. This problem was extensively dis cussed in Lyell's Principles of Geology (1830-33). With that work in hand on his Beagle voyage Darwin was well prepared to seek data pertaining to it. Lyell's influence on Wallace is as well documented, and had much the same effect as on Darwin. (See McKinney, [16], pp. 49f, 98-116, 148-158.) Lyell was concerned primarily with explaining the distribution of organisms on the main continental land masses by means of dispersal mechanisms and geographical barriers but without appealing to the seemingly ad hoc and geologically implausible land bridges of other attempts to deal with this problem. Darwin's own discovery of the peculiarities of island populations contributed local detail to the descriptions requiring explanation and provided grounds for challenging the immutability of species. Wallace further confirmed Darwin's discoveries for organisms in the Amazon and Maylay regions. This and the problem of extinction appears to be the problem to which Darwin devoted most of his search efforts prior to his response to Malthus' influence.</page><page sequence="11">PROBLEM SOLVING AND DISCOVERY 129 4. The affinities and differences between related species as well as the stability of species was accepted as brute fact by non-evolu tionary systematic biologists such as John Ray and Linnaeus in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and Cuvier and Lyell in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. However, both assump tions were viewed as problematic by Buffon, Lamarck, Darwin and Wallace, all of whom questioned the belief that varieties forever fall within the fixed limits separating species. 5. Most organisms possess certain apparently unused structural features, e.g., the 'dew claws' of dogs and the nipples of male mammals. Some of these were thought to be homologous1 with like but functional organs on related species, and in some cases degrees of development and utilization were thought to occur in several related species. During the year or so following Darwin's return from the Beagle voyage, he came to believe that the detailed factual information he collected regarding the geographical distribution of species could not be reconciled with Lyell's views that new species were produced at and migrated from 'centres of creation'. Since Darwin and Lyell already regarded this hypothesis, the 'multiple creation hypothesis', as having superseded any 'single creation' hypothesis, whereby all organisms now extant were created in one act, and Darwin discussed no further anthropomorphic hypotheses, we may infer that at this point in his thought he turned away from all such agent-teleological hypotheses. At this time he embraced as a goal state for the origin problem the formulation of an explanatory theory involving only 'natural' forces or happenings, viz., forces determined by universal laws that act upon processes here and now as well as during the earth's past history. This step resolves the conflict seen by both Darwin and Wallace between Lyell's account of geological processes and of biological history. It can be regarded as an extension of Lyell's metaphysical and methodological blueprint for geology to the history of living organisms. The naturalistic desiderata that Wallace and Darwin embrace for the solution to their origin problem specifies in broad outline, but not in detail, the goal state for this problem. Unlike certain other prob lems such as the discovery of the solution of a problem in the 3 x 3 tile game or of a proof for a theorem in an axiomatic system, the full specification of a goal state for problems seeking explanatory theories</page><page sequence="12">130 SCOTT A. KLEINER cannot be had in the advance formulation of the problem. Such full specification would constitute the formulation of the theory in ad vance, i.e., the problem could not be specified until its solution was given. Thus the goal state for such 'why-questions' can appropriately consist only of desiderata characterizing in the abstract and general manner of Lyell's uniformatarianism and actualism the kind of theory that would provide an acceptable explanation of the phenomena or processes in question. Specifically, both Darwin and Wallace claim to seek an explanation of the replacement of species by means of universal laws comparable to Newton's Law of Gravitation. Both repudiated motivated or arbi trary acts of a Supreme Being, particularly Lyell's agent-teleological account of the appearance and adaptation of species. Early in his 'Notebooks on Transmutation', Darwin expresses a commitment to the view that the same laws govern the appearance of plants and animals, including man. The yet undiscovered laws governing in heritance, variation, and even behavior are common to all kingdoms and all species. Many passages throughout the 'Notebooks on Transmutation' as well as the notebooks 'M' and 'N' devoted specifically to this topic (See Gruber, [8]) allude to the physiological and the psychological (behavioral and possibly mental) continuity between man and other animals. Wallace similarly upheld the biolo gical behavioral continuity between man and other primates. Both Darwin and Wallace may have gained insight into intraspecific varia tion from this ethnographic observation made during their respective travels (McKinney [16], 19, 83-89). Finally, Darwin was committed to the view that natural processes, in contrast to possible supernatural happenings, occur gradually in the sense that they are the ac cumulated effects of many small changes. This, too, is an extension to biology of a Lyellian regulative principle for geology. Because neither Darwin nor Wallace would entertain an agent teleological theory as a possible solution to the origin problem, they transformed the problem by changing their specification of its goal state. Yet there is significant continuity between Lyell's version and Darwin's and Wallace's version of the origin problem, and this continuity renders unwarranted any theses of radical meaning vari ance or discontinuous problem shifts between Lyellian and Darwinian biology. The factual presuppositions of the two versions of the origin problem are the same, and their respective expressions in the con</page><page sequence="13">PROBLEM SOLVING AND DISCOVERY 131 texts of the two research traditions cannot be said to differ radically in their meaning. Although the meaning of 'species' is shifted once variability is admitted from something reflecting essential charac teristics to something reflecting relations of descent and genetic exchange through breeding, there is little doubt that Darwin and Wallace maintain with Lyell, Cuvier, et al. a community of shared and meaning-relevant belief regarding species-identity. In particular there is no evidence to indicate that they differed on the anatomical variations within and between species that are used to identify the species of living organisms or of their remains. There is no evidence to indicate, e.g., that Darwin or Wallace had occasion to challenge any of Cuvier's conclusions about the distinct species of extinct animals whose remains he studied.2 Although Darwin and Wallace embrace methodological desiderata that differ from those of Lyell, it does not follow that the two research programs are 'methodologically incommensurable' either. Darwin and Wallace were able to offer both conceptual and empirical grounds3 for rejecting Lyell's multiple creation theory, and these arguments eventually persuaded Lyell to embrace both their phy logenic evolution and their theory of natural selection. These arguments thus rest upon common methodological values that under lie their initial differences. Wallace's 'Species Notebooks' (1854-8) contain the clearest arti culation of these arguments, but Darwin's 'Notebooks on Trans mutation' indicate that he was thinking independently along similar lines. Regarding the conceptual problems facing Lyell's theory, Wal lace tells us: It would be an extraordinary thing if while the modification of the surface took [place] by natural causes now in operation, and the extinction of species was the natural result of the same causes, yet the reproduction and introduction of new species required special acts of creation, or some process which does not present itself in the ordinary course of nature. (Quoted from Beddall, [1], p. 286) In addition to the internal incoherence of Lyell's theory, Darwin appeals to the relatively ad hoc character of agent-teleological theories when compared to the naturalistic account he seeks: How does it come wandering birds such [as] sandpipers not new at Galapagos. - Did the creative force know these species could arrive - did it only create those kinds not so likely to wander-did it create two species closely allied to Musfcicapa], but not</page><page sequence="14">132 SCOTT A. KLEINER coronata.-We know that domestic animals vary countries without any assignable reason. Astronomers might formerly have said that God ordered each planet to move in its particular destiny. In same manner, God orders each animal created with certain form in certain country, but how much more simple and sublime power let attraction act according to certain law, such by the fixed laws of generation, such will be their successors. Let the powers of transportal be such, and so will be the forms of one country to another. - Let geological changes go at such a rate, so will be the number and distribution of the species!! ([5], BlOOf)4 In response to Darwin's researches printed in the Journal of Researchers (1839, revised 2nd edition 1845) and to his own studies in the Amazon and the Maylay Archipelago, Wallace points to the empirical inadequacies of Lyell's theory: Lyell occupies much space in showing how the species which are common to different and distant countries might have been carried from one to the other by a variety of accidents. But this has never been felt to be a difficulty. The matter of wonder has always been that in distant countries of similar climate so many should be different. This he gets over by special creation of the species each in one spot as they are wanted. This is no doubt a very easy way of getting over it, but just as philosophical as to say that fossils of existing species are remains of real animals while those which are not like any species now existing are special creations and not fossil animals at all. (Quoted in Beddall, [1], pp. 284f) The same kind of argument occurred to Darwin: An American and African form of plant being found in tristan D'Acuna, may be said to deceive man, as likely as fossils in old rocks for same purpose. (B218) Wallace thus concludes that an attempt to dodge the empirical difficulties raises the conceptual problems involved in giving very different causal accounts of the genesis of very similar effects or remains. Wallace goes on to point out that special creations are further multiplied by the need to explain the differences observed by Darwin between organisms occupying the different islands of the Galapagos Archipelago. Further difficulties for Lyell are encountered in the need to explain why new creations are not in competition with orgainsms that are, by Lyell's own account, likely to migrate from continent to island or from island to island. This conceptual problem becomes more acute in the light of Wallace's belief that younger islands have species more like those of neighboring land masses than do older islands. It would appear that the organisms that stocked the younger islands by migration would have to suffer a special exter</page><page sequence="15">PROBLEM SOLVING AND DISCOVERY 133 mination before being replaced by new species by special creation (Beddall, [1], pp. 285f). From the above arguments it is clear that Darwin and Wallace appeal to epistemic desiderata that are widely accepted even today. These include the demands that theories cohere with unchallenged observational or experimental information and that ad hocness and the differences between causal accounts of similar happenings be minimized. Furthermore, we have pointed out that a highly significant feature of the Darwinian revolution is the assembly of a body of problems previously studied in relative isolation from one another. The turn away from anthropomorphic theories in biology can be regarded as a rationally defensible transformation of a problem that had a short history before Darwin's and Wallace's investigations. It also similarly transformed the other problems Darwin and Wallace assembled. There are rather clear semantic and methodological con tinuities between Darwin's and Wallace's program and those of their rivals and predecessors. Thus, although the thesis that problem-shifts often accompany major innovations such as the introduction of phylogenic evolution by natural selection, these problem-shifts do not entail the semantic and methodological incommensurability attributed to scientific revolutions by earlier writings of certain historicist philosophers (e.g., Kuhn, [11], Hanson, [9], and Feyerabend, [6]). 4. THE DEVELOPMENT OF DARWIN'S THEORY So far we have considered only the outcome of Darwin's and Wal lace's search, not the paths of their search. In this section, I shall consider specific details of Darwin's search. In the section to follow, these specific points will be contrasted with the path evident in Wallace's writings in order to determine whether common normative standards apply to both and to assess degrees of freedom allowed by these standards. Darwin recorded presumably main points of the development of his ideas on evolution and natural selection in 'Notebooks on trans mutation of species' dating from June 1837 to July 1839. In the following I shall consider what appear to be a series of shifts in attention to specific problems as well as the elaboration, trans formation or rendering more precise of problems already of concern to biologists. Also, there occurs the consideration, rejection and ac</page><page sequence="16">134 SCOTT A. KLEINER ceptance of several theories and the modification of certain key concepts in Darwin's thinking. I shall be looking for normative epistemic principles implicit in this movement of thought, as well as for peculiarities in the technical and epistemic circumstances under which Darwin worked, circumstances that might have constrained his decisions in specific ways and might also have justifiably done so. Notebook B, Darwin's first notebook on transmutation, opens with the claim that varieties produced at birth solve the problem of adaptation as he has come to see it, viz., how is adaptation to a changing physical world maintained? Variation at birth provides the changes needed to adapt a race to changing circumstances (B4). Darwin then goes on to treat the problem of how constancy in species can be maintained and what circumstances favor the production of new species, problems for which he has a ready answer: interbreeding maintains constancy and isolation favors and preserves variation (B5-8). At this point he perceives his difficulties not in explaining speciation but in explaining extinction: ... with this tendency to change (and to multiplication when isolated,) requires death of species to keep numbers equal (B21). In response to this latter problem Darwin initially offers his 'monad' theory, which is not a theory of the origin of the species but a theory of extinction. Monads are 'simple living forms' that appear by spon taneous generation from inanimate matter, evolve in response to environmental conditions along branching paths to families of related species (genera). Like individuals, monads have an inherently limited life span, and thus according to the theory eventually all of any genus will die out roughly at the same time (B18-20); Gruber, [8], Chap. 7) This consequence, although supported by some fossil evidence that whole fauna die out at once around the world (B63), is incompatible with the branching phylogenetic theory that Darwin worked out to explain his biogeographical data, as he soon recognizes (B35). Thus he modifies the theory to allow for monads' variable life spans and also to allow monads to produce progeny. Monads survive as in dividuals survive, namely, through their offspring (B64). But inevit ably only some can survive (B40f, 146ff), thus raising the problem of extinction all over again but in slightly extended form to include explaining survival as well. Darwin never explicitly rejects the monad theory, but very soon</page><page sequence="17">PROBLEM SOLVING AND DISCOVERY 135 after he revised it there appears a passage suggesting a rather different explanation of extinction: With respect to extinction we can easily see that variety of ostrich Petise may not be well adapted, and thus perish out, or on other hand Orpheus being favourable, many might be produced. This requires principle that the permanent varieties produced by confined breeding and changing circumstances are continued and produce according to the adaptation of such circumstances, and therefore that the death of a species is a consequence (contrary to what would appear from America) of non-adaptation of circumstances. (B37ft.) Also, somewhat later he says: Whether every animal produced in the course of ages ten thousand varieties (influenced itself perhaps by circumstances) and these alone preserved which are well adapted. (B90) These passages are among several containing ideas soon to be molded into the theory of natural selection, and it is here that Darwin shows evidence of beginning to think that adaptation to circumstances has something to do with a species' survival or failure. However, his thinking at this point about adaptation and survival is rather different from natural selection theory. In Notebook C he makes the mechanism in his second theory of extinction more explicit: The constitution being hereditary and fixed, certain physical changes at last become unfit, the animal cannot change and perishes. - Lyell has shown such Physical changes will be unequally rapid with respect to their effects. (53; see hint at B61) In sum, extinction takes place when adaptive variation cannot keep pace with the changes in circumstances. Darwin's abandoning the monad theory is accompanied by a res triction of the problem field in his search. By March 1838 he explicitly drops any attempt to explain the origin of life : ... it is useless to speculate not only about beginning of animal life generally, but even about great divisions. Our question is not how there came to be fish and quadrupeds, but how there came to be many genera of fish and c. and c. at present day. (C58) The origin problem is thus restricted to explaining relations between species within genera. This problem shift is a consequence of drop ping a theory in which spontaneous generation is constantly occurring and is the continual source of new life forms. This latter assumption does not cohere well with Darwin's branching phylogeny, wherein it is assumed that the vast variety of species descended from relatively</page><page sequence="18">136 SCOTT A. KLEINER few primordial forms by divergent paths produced by accumulated variation. Darwin's branching phylogeny would relegate origins of life from inanimate matter to relatively few events that are remote in time. This explanation is thus no longer essential to understanding the process by which species descend by reproduction from ancestral species. Implicit in Darwin's second theory of extinction is a rather different conception of variation and adaptation than appears in the theory of natural selection. Darwin not only initially assumed that variation is inherited and can carry an organism beyond the limits defining spe cies, but he also assumed that that kind of variation is necessarily progressively adaptive. All variation increased complexity and the increased complexity is always advantageous to the orgainsm in changing physical circumstances (B18). Adaptive variation is dis tinguished from the occurrence of heritable deformities or 'mon strosities' which Darwin and many of his predecessors such as Linneus and Edward Blyth assumed to be deleterious and usually eliminated by death or failure to breed. This conception of variation probably initially gained its plausibility from Darwin's overriding concern with his new form of the problem of adaptation: How is adaptation maintained in the face of continually changing geological circumstances? Although Darwin is always ready to acknowledge that species inevitably die out, he is never quite satisfied with this second theory of extinction. He notes dissatisfaction with the lack of a causal mechanism producing extinction from poor adaptation: Weakest part of theory death of species without apparent physical cause. (B135) Possibly another source of dissatisfaction is the empirical evidence that extinctions have nearly simultaneously occurred the world over: ... and whether extinction of great S. American quadrupeds part of some great system acting over whole world, the period of great quadrupeds declining as great reptiles must once have declined. (B53; see also B63) Such facts are especially disturbing to those, such as Darwin and Lyell, who are methodologically disposed against postulating world wide destructive geological catastrophes. Both Darwin's conception of inevitably adaptive and progressive variation and his theory of extinction founder upon evidence that</page><page sequence="19">PROBLEM SOLVING AND DISCOVERY 137 some species have varied little and possibly regressively, if at all, over long periods of time. Evidence for his awareness of the varying rates of variation appear from the middle of Notebook C onward: As we know from Ehrenberg there are fossil (see scientific Memoirs and L'Institut) that are Tertiary fossil Infusoria of same forms with recent and we have nothing to do with CREATION. (C146) That is, the infusoria are not, as he thought in his monad theory, the origin of all life and, seemingly contrary to the second theory they manage to survive long periods of geologic change without variation. By August of 1838 Darwin is again without a theory of extinction: 27th August [1838]: There must be some law that whatever organization an animal has, it tends to multiply and improve on it. - Articulate animals must articulate and vertibrate tendency to improve in intellect, -if generation is condensation of change, then animals must tend to improve. -Yet fish same as, or lower than in old days: for a very old variety will be harder to vary and therefore more apt to be extinguished. - ?? (D49) The evidence that some fish may even have regressed is plainly in conflict with the theory that survival through the ages is due to continuing progressive changes maintaining adaptive relationships to the environment. This last passage also culminates a series of passages that indicate Darwin's increasing awareness that the adaptation of organisms is never quite perfect and that adaptation must be thought of as a relation between organism and environment, not as a property of the organism. As early as Bill Darwin notes that variations are for tuitous, i.e., they are not directed by circumstances and thus there is no natural explanation of why they should be necessarily adaptive. Furthermore some variations are neutral: ... Pecularities of structure as six-fingered people are sometimes hereditary - yet these not adaptations - they are counteracted by nature by crossing with other varities. C83 In some circumstances, organisms are not at all well adapted: Wax of Ear, bitter perhaps to prevent insects lodging there. Now these exquisite adaptations can hardly be accounted for by my method of breeding, there must be some correlation, but whole mechanism is so beautiful. The correlations are not, however, perfect, else one animal would not cause misery to other, - else smell of man would be disagreeable to mosquitoes. (C174) Finally Darwin recognizes that the value of an adaptation is relative</page><page sequence="20">138 SCOTT A. KLEINER to circumstances: ... Albino however is monster, yet albino may so far be considered as an adaptation, as best attempt of nature colouring matter being absent. - Again dwarf plant on alpine district and dwarf plant from seed, one adaptation, other monsters. (C85) Thus the lack of any mechanism guaranteeing that variations are progressive and adaptive, evidence of either lack of adaptation to circumstances or maladaptation thereto, and the rejection of the traditional distinction between monster and variety in favor of a relative conception of adaptation5 all combine to undermine Darwin's initial belief that all variation (other than monstrous) is necessarily progressively adaptive. However, Darwin now can no longer explain the appropriateness of form to function in living organisms as the result of the accumulation of adaptive variations at a rate com mensurate with changes in circumstances. The problem of adaptation is again without a solution, for the preservation of those variations that give the organism an advantage in given circumstances and that increase complexity of structure and behavior is now without an explanation. The downfall of both Darwin's initial conception of variation and his second theory of extinction, which occur only months before he outlines his theory of natural selection for the first time, are prerequisites for his reformulating and considering a new problem of adaptation: How are the advantageous variations - whether progressive or not- selected over other variations and accumulated with the result that (albeit imperfect) adaptation is maintained to changing circumstances? Before shifting his conception of variation to that of fortuitous variations of indeterminate value, this question would not have been of concern to Darwin. His initial understanding of the problem of variation would not have directed him to the theory of natural selection. The initial absence of any problem in Darwin's thinking demanding some form of selection as a solution may explain the absence of any hint at the theory of natural selection in Darwin's notebooks before the Malthus passage written on September 28, 1838. Darwin did entertain separately at several points before this passage concepts that were to serve as components of the theory of natural selection, but they were molded into that theory only after he was led to embrace the above formulation of the problem of adaptation. Hence, although he had arrived at the conclusion that the mechanism of</page><page sequence="21">PROBLEM SOLVING AND DISCOVERY 139 evolution is speciation "... due to adaptation of hereditary structure" (B225) at a relatively early date (February 1838), natural selection played no role in this theory because it was not needed-there was nothing for it to explain-at that time. Adaptive variations simply occurred and their accumulation produced speciation via reproductive isolation. As late as late July 1838 Darwin was so far from natural selection that he even claimed the difference between varieties in domestic and wild animals is that selection is part of the process of producing the former but not the latter races: The varieties of the domesticated animals must be most complicated, because they are partly local and then the local ones are taken to fresh country and breed confined to certain best individuals. - scarcely any breed but what some individuals are picked out - in a really natural breed, not one is picked out, and few even of local varieties approaches to wild local variety. Our European varieties must be very unnatural. (D20f) The 'unnaturalness' of domestic varieties was thought to be supported by the then widely acknowledged fact that domestic varieties rapidly revert to wild forms when selection is stopped and interbreeding is allowed to proceed freely (See Wallace, [23]). The several components of natural selection that Darwin mentions early in the notebooks are (i) superfecundity in infusoria suggested in a paper by Ehrenberg, (ii) rates at which new territories are colonized observed on the Beagle voyage, and (iii) the competition between species and its effects on migration and colonization discussed by Lyell and DeCandolle. Darwin mentions superfecundity in infusoria about halfway through Notebook C (c. May or June 1838): When one reads Ehrenberg's paper on Infusoria on the enormous production - millions in a few days - one doubts that one animal can really produce so great an effect. - the spirit of life must be everywhere ambient and merely determined to such points by the vital laws. - to that all characters originally may must have had the character of analogical [viz., most subject to change (see C 130)]. (C143) It appears at this point that Darwin associates superfecundity with spontaneous generation and not reproduction, for the ambience of the 'spirit of life' is a return to questions dealt with under the monad theory but usually avoided after that theory was dropped. So under stood, superfecundity need have no application to organisms generated by sexual or a-sexual reproduction.</page><page sequence="22">140 SCOTT A. KLEINER However, early in Notebook B (July or August, 1837) Darwin does recognize that the effects of geometrical reproduction in macroscopic organisms and in the generation of new species are inevitable extinc tion of some of each. If we go very far back to look for the source of the Mammalian type of organization, it is extremely improbable that any of the successors of his relations shall now exist. - In same manner, if we take a man from any large family of 12 brothers and sisters in a state which does not increase, it will be chances against any one of them having progeny living ten thousand years hence; because at present day many are relatives so that by tracing back the fathers would be reduced to small percentage: -therefore the chances are excessively great against any two of the 12 having progeny after that distant period. (B40) Here Darwin simply assumes a constant population and constancy in the number of species over geological time. This equilibrium entails extinction of both individuals and species, and it is the extinction of species which is of such great concern to Darwin early on in the 'Notebooks'. What is lacking here is any consideration of the causes of stability within populations, although he does go on to consider possible causes for the stability of the number of species. Also lacking is any substantive causal link between the size of populations and the fate of species. Here Darwin is only exploiting an analogical relation between individuals and species in order to gain insight into the survival and demise of species from the presumably more familiar survival and demise of individuals. Perhaps also he would have been more concerned with the causes of stability of numbers in popu lations had he thought of superfecundity as inevitable and of such a magnitude as to have the same effects in macroscopic as in micro scopic organisms. Such considerations would raise the importance of causally explaining stable population, a problem that apparently did not concern Darwin at this point. The remaining two components of natural selection are brought up in this passage: Study the wars of organic being. -The fact of guavas having overrun Tahiti, thistle Pampas show how nicely things adapted. - The aberrant varieties will be formed in any kingdom of nature where scheme not filled up (most false to say no passages; nature is full of them ... (C73) The 'wars of organic being' as derived from Lyell and DeCandolle are episodes of competition between species. This competition allowed whole species to drive out others having fewer advantages, or allowed</page><page sequence="23">PROBLEM SOLVING AND DISCOVERY 141 them to multiply rapidly filling niches where there is no competition. In either case at most whole species are selected over rivals that are less able to cope with circumstances. However, this kind of selection is not to be confused with natural selection, where the competition takes place within the species, and it is subpopulations of a species that are selected for their advantageous variations over other such subpopulations. As long as Darwin thinks that certain variations are necessarily adaptive and others necessarily abortive, he does not need to explain the accumulation of the former. Whatever competition that might occur within species is thus not thought to have an effect on evolution as Darwin conceived it in his first theory. However, com petition between species with superfecunidy can explain migration, barriers to migration and the rapid colonization of newly accessible areas. Although Darwin had already acknowledged effects of super fecundity on populations and had hypothesized superfecundity in explaining rapid colonization, it apparently took Malthus' Essay on Population to bring on his recognition that superfecundity pervades throughout nature and that constant checks must be operating on the individuals of a population to prevent otherwise inevitable disastrous overpopulation. That is, relatively stable populations must be explained by environmental forces acting upon individuals. Malthus even suggests what some such forces are, viz., famine, poor nurture of young, war and disease, Malthus' contributions to Darwin's theory are mentioned in this passage from the end of Notebook D: Sept. 28th [1838] We ought to be far from wondering pi changes in numbers of species, from small changes in nature of locality. (I do not doubt every one till he thinks deeply has assumed that increase of animals exactly proportionate to the number that can live. -) Even the energetic language of Decandoelle does not convey the warring of the species as inference from Malthus. - (increase of brutes must be prevented solely by positive checks, excepting famine may stop desire. -) in nature production does not increase, whilst no check prevail, but the positive check of famine and consequently death, population in increase as geometrical ratio in FAR SHORTER time than 25 years - yet until the one sentence of Malthus no one clearly perceived the greater check amongst men. - (there is spring, like food used for other purposes as what for making brandy. -) Even a few years of plenty, makes population in men increase, and in ordinary crops causes a death) take Europe on the average every species must have same number killed year with year, by hawks, by colds, etc. -even one species of hawk decreasing in number must affect instantaneously all the rest. - (The final cause of all this wedging, must be to sort out proper structure, and adapt it to change. - to do that for form, which Malthus shows is the final effect (by means however of volition) of</page><page sequence="24">142 SCOTT A. KLEINER this populousness, or the energy of man) One may say there is a force like a hundred thousand wedges trying to force every kind of adapted structure into the gaps in the economy of nature, or rather forming gaps by thrusting out the weaker ones. (D134 135e) Darwin's belief that there is no qualitative difference between man and other animals renders it inevitable to him that Malthus' law should also be applied to non-human organisms. In the case of most animals there is an additional check on population that does not affect human populations significantly, viz., pr?dation. It should be clear from this passage that Darwin is aware of a complex of rudimentary ecological relations between species by which various populations hold one another in check. The malthusian population pressure causes the 'wedging' which in turn explains rapid colonization and adaptation. In the latter case, Darwin has only recently recognized that adaptation requires some kind of selection of those variations which are ad vantageous in the ambient circumstances. However, he only vaguely hints at the process of selection in this passage with his claim that the 'final cause', i.e., the outcome, of the wedging is adaptation to circumstances. In Notebook E he reverses his position on the differences between domestic and wild varieties Varieties are made in two days-local varieties when whole mass of species are subjected to same influence, and this would take place from changing country: but greyhound race-horse and poulter Pidgeon have not been thus produced, but by training and crossing and keeping pure - and so in plants effectually the offspring are picked and not allowed to cross. - Has nature any process analogous - if so she can produce great ends. -But how-even if by cross questioning - Here given my theory. -Excellent true theory. (El 18) Here Darwin affirms that if nature has a process analogous to selecting and maintaining pure strains in domestic organisms then differences comparable to those appearing in domestic breeds can be produced naturally. He seems confident that his theory, the theory of natural selection, will provide the means of maintaining selected races in nature, although there still is no detail as to how this process takes place. Darwin also claims that he can now solve the problem that upset his second theory of extinction, viz., that of explaining the varying rates of evolution and the occasional progress and regress that takes place in the various orders:</page><page sequence="25">PROBLEM SOLVING AND DISCOVERY 143 The enormous number of animals in the world depends upon their varied structure and complexity, -hence as the forms become complicated, they opened fresh means of adding to their complexity. - but yet there is no necessary tendency in simple animals to become complicated, although all perhaps will have done so from the new relations caused by the advancing of others. - It may be said, why should there not be at any time as many species tending to disdevelopment (some probably always have done so, as the simplest fish), my answer is because, if we begin with the simplest and suppose them to have changed, their very changes tend to give rise to others. - Why there has been a retrograde movement in Cephalopods and fish and reptiles? - supposing such to be the case, it provides the law of development in partial classes is far from true, -1 doubt not if the simplest aminals could be destroyed, the more highly organized would soon be disorganized to fill their places. (E95f) Here Darwin formulates the ecological principle that changes in the structure and habits of an organism themselves can change the circumstances in which that organism lives. Also since fortuitous variation is neutral with respect to progress (viz., increased com plexity in structure and behavior - intelligence) as well as adaptation, a species may come to occupy a vacant station (niche) by 'retrograde' evolution, i.e., by becoming less complex. Darwin here recognizes that geological changes need not affect all stations in the same way. The effect of such changes is tempered by organisms occupying that or neighboring stations. Thus the demands placed upon different orders by a given physical change can be expected to be different. The problems of extinction and evolution are not only refined in the course of Darwin's thoughts, but also both problems are solved by the same theory, as Darwin acknowledges in the following: If species change, we see external conditions have great effect on them, and therefore extermination becomes part of same law. ... When a species becomes rarer, as it progresses toward extermination some of the species must increase in number where there is the gap, for the new one to enter? (E43) That is, the connection between circumstances and numbers provided by Malthus' principles allows us to describe extinction as diminution of numbers of a species to zero and speciation as the increase in numbers of some recently reproductively isolated population. Mal thus' principle with the selection of adaptive variations explain both processes so described. Here is an instance of the 'consilation' of facts that Darwin regarded as an important methodological desidera tum; this achievement surely contributed to pursuading him of the 'excellence' and the 'truth' of his theory.</page><page sequence="26">144 SCOTT A. KLEINER Wallace's Path to Natural Selection Perhaps the most striking difference between the apparent paths of Wallace's and Darwin's research is that Wallace's path lacks some of the seeming digressions and false starts recorded in Darwin's 'Note books on Transmutation'. Such differences might be taken to indicate that Wallace's path to the theory of natural selection is more 'efficient' than Darwin's. Thus one might be tempted to conclude that Wallace rather than Darwin should have been chosen to exemplify optimal strategies for developing new explanatory theories. However, one must be cautious in drawing such conclusions. Differences in the efficiency of a search can mean several things. Greater efficiency could mean that less time or effort is devoted to the task at hand. However, Darwin's search is not obviously less efficient in this sense, for Darwin's notebooks on transmutation span the period 1837-9 (approximately two years) and Wallace's 1854-7 (ap proximately three years). It is also doubtful that there could be a significant measure of their effort that could be compared in the manner suggested by this sense of efficiency. A second interpretation of 'efficiency' might be a measure of the number of decisions that were warranted by relevant methodological standards. In this section, I shall contend that Darwin's search is also no less efficient than Wallace's in this sense. I shall then conclude with some remarks about degrees of freedom implicit in strategies that produce nearly the same theory. In 1848, Wallace undertook a journey to the Amazon basin for the purpose of observing and collecting flora and fauna with the problem of geographical distribution foremost in his mind. It is well known that he had by then read both Lyell's Principles of Geology and Darwin's Journal of Researches (1841). Hence, not only was he aware of Lyell's problem of explaining similarities of organisms in various regions, but also he had in mind the anomolies in island populations and the similarities between fossils and living species reported by Darwin (McKinney, ([16], Chap. 2, esp. pp. 20f). There is also evidence that in addition to these problems of distribution, Wallace was looking specifically for evidence bearing upon the origin of species, viz., the 'origin problem' of explaining naturalistically the appearance of new species (McKinney, [16]). In short, unlike Darwin, Wallace conducted his field work as an evolutionist seeking support</page><page sequence="27">PROBLEM SOLVING AND DISCOVERY 145 of the view that species change and evidence that might illuminate how such phylogenic evolution takes place. Wallace's concerns are evident in the following passage from a paper published in 1855 To discover how the extinct species have from time to time been replaced by new ones down to the very latest geological period, is the most difficult, and at the same time the most interesting problem in the natural history of the earth. (Wallace, [23], p. 14) In the same essay Wallace states a 'law': Every species has come into existence in both space and time with a pre-exiting closely allied species. ([23], p. 5) This law is a 'phenomenologicaF generalization from a list of pro positions summarizing observation on the geographical distribution of living organism and correlated distributions of fossils of similar organisms. Although I know of no explicit statement of a similar law in Darwin's writings, it is clear that Darwin had gathered much the same kind of information on his Beagle journey and that Wallace borrowed some of this. There is little room for doubt that Darwin was aware of the correlation expressed by Wallace's law when he began is 'Notebook on Transmutation'. Wallace's Law is also accompanied with the claim that phylo genetic succession is branching It is evidently possible that two or three distinct species may have had a common antitype, and that each of these may again have become the antitypes from which other closely allied species were created ([23], p. 6) Wallace even uses a metaphor that has all of the important features of Darwin's coral metaphor: ... we have only fragments of this vast system [of branches in the descent of species], the stem and main branches being represented by extinct species of which we have no knowledge, while a vast mass of limbs and boughs and minute twigs and scattered leaves in what we have to place in order, and determine the true position originally occupied with regard to the others [in forming a 'Natural System* of classification]. ([23], p. 8) In his 'Species Notebook' Wallace further refines his phylogeny to exclude the naive supposition that present day mammalia might have descended from present day reptiles and the like: ... all that the development theory requires is that some specimeus of the lower</page><page sequence="28">146 SCOTT A. KLEINER organized group should appear earlier than any of the group of higher organization. (Quoted in [14a], p. 41) We have seen the same claim in Darwin's 'Notebooks on Trans mutation'. Wallace's 'Species Notebook' contains notes on Edward Blyth's remarks on variation and sexual selection. These notes date from mid 1856 (McKinney [16], pp. 60f), and include the claims that simple variations from parental form appear frequently in offspring at birth and are propagated by inheritance. Breeds occur when these varia tions are accumulated and maintained by isolation, whether natural or artificial. 'True varieties' occur when these variations became per manent characters of a stock. Blyth, like Lyell, believed that such variations never crossed the 'species barrier'. However, later in his 'Species Notebook' Wallace attacks Lyell's view on this matter as being unsupported. Blyth's theses on variation and the production of permanent varieties reappear in Wallace's 1858 exposition of his theory of natural selection with the additional proposition that the accumulated variations could produce permanent 'varieties' that actually lie across the species barrier. Wallace's concept of species here is not Darwin's biospecies concept, but rather one defined in terms of 'permanent' inheritable differences (See [20], pp. 26ff). Wallace apparently found the biospecies concept useless and viciously circular Species are merely those strongly marked races or local forms which when in contact do not intermix, and when inhabiting distinct areas are generally believed to have a separate origin, and to be incapable of producing fertile hybrid offspring. But as the case of hybridity cannot be applied in one case out in ten thousand, and even if it could it would prove nothing, since it is founded on the very assumption of the question to be decided-and as the test of separate origin is in every case inapplicable-... We have no means whatever of distinguishing so-called "true species" from the several modes of variation here pointed out, and into which they often pass by insensible gradation. (Species Notebook, pp. 144-6; Quoted in McKinney [16], p. 69) Presumably the vicious circularity comes from the fact that we must already have distinguished species in order to determine what counts as a hybrid. Furthermore, Wallace claims that the biospecies concept cannot be appealed to to establish a permanent species barrier, thus repeating an argument used by Lyell. Wallace does not show a concern for Darwin's problem with the 'swamping effect', i.e., the dilution and loss of variants from crossing</page><page sequence="29">PROBLEM SOLVING AND DISCOVERY 147 back into the unvaried population. Accordingly we don't find in Wallace's writings Darwin's attempt to explain speciation by isola tion. Possibly Wallace concluded swamping could be ignored because by observation permanent varieties/species exist in nature. Thus he might have concluded backcrossing is in fact not significant in nature. Also, as he viewed the line between species as something other than a barrier preventing intermixing, he would not have felt the need to explain how such barriers are effective. Another consideration that subsequently supports Wallace's attitude is implicit in his approach to his theory of natural selection. Unlike Darwin, Wallace used the knowledge of domestic animals against the claim that species are permanent and not to support evolution, as did Darwin. In domestic animals, natural selection tends to favor reversion to original unvaried forms. This claim is supported by evidence for poor adaptation to natural conditions of highly selected animals or plants, e.g., poodle dogs or cultivated vegetables. Reversion to the original form thus can be expected to occur only where it is advantageous, but by hypothesis from the theory of natural selection, some variants in nature are advantageous. Therefore, they will not revert to the original. Like Darwin, Wallace borrowed ideas of superfecundity and struggle between species from Lyell. However, unlike Darwin, Wal lace saw no problem for the Lyellian account of extinction in the fossil record, which indicated that there had been worldwide calama tous extinctions of whole fauna. Wallace remarks that the French paleontologist F. J. Pictet's claim "Contemporaneous spec[ies] generally appear[e]d or disap[peare]d together" is "generally unim portant". Presumably he believed that such apparent fossil evidence could be discredited in the usual Lyellean way, viz., by pointing to the rarity of conditions conducive to the preservation of fossils. Lyell's theory of fossilization appeared ad hoc to many in the mid-19th century. For Wallace, as in Darwin's case, the fact of extinction for some and survival for other species gives rise to the problem of explaining survival. Wallace does not attempt to explain survival and extinction by the rate of accumulation of adaptive variations in changing cir cumstances. Wallace thus avoids what seems to be a costly detour taken by Darwin into a theory that is inconsistent with his (Darwin's) views of adaptation and refuted by evidence that not all characters are fully adaptive.</page><page sequence="30">148 SCOTT A. KLEINER However, Darwin's theory of evolution by adaptive variation is proposed to solve two problems taken more seriously by Darwin than Wallace in the initial stages of their respective searches. There are the problems of explaining apparent mass extinction and of explaining continued adaptation in the face of continual changes in Lyell's biogeographical world. We already know that Wallace was hardly concerned with the first of these problems. Wallace mentions adap tation only in conjunction with his first presentation of the theory of natural selection, viz., in his 1858 paper 'On the tendency of varieties to depart indefinitely from the original type'. There the problem's solution appears as a by-product of his efforts toward explaining the biogeographical anomalies and the replacement of extinct species. Before that time he may have found it expedient to ignore the problem in favor of other more tractable problems in biogeography, especially in the light of his decision to reject Lyell's agent-teleological account of the replacement of extinct species. The above outstanding differences between Wallace's and Darwin's searches can be accounted for by the following points: (i) Due to the debatable credibility of Lyell's theory of fos silization, whether or not mass extinction posed a problem was un determined between 1835 and 1860. Thus any factual considerations that are not conclusive permit a degree of freedom in the problems that demand attention. The fact that Wallace and not Darwin was developing his theory while in the field could also have affected differences in the factual information injected into their searches as they proceeded. Wallace did not have to rely on tenuous analogies with domestic species as did Darwin. Wallace could but Darwin couldn't direct his field work toward information he thought pertinent to the replacement problem. Wallace was thus in a better position to observe, e.g., 'permanent varieties' in nature than was Darwin. (ii) If several independent problems are approached at once, one has the option to temporarily shelve one in favor of seemingly more tractable problems. Thus Wallace could have excused attention to the problem of adaptation. Also, that natural selection solved this prob lem is at least as good a reason for accepting the theory when the problem didn't motivate the search for the theory as when it did motivate the search. Furthermore, given Darwin's and Wallace's attack on several fronts, neither person is as likely to suffer from falsely thinking he has solved one problem. The solution of one</page><page sequence="31">PROBLEM SOLVING AND DISCOVERY 149 problem may also solve another - as both extinction and replacement are explained by natural selection. On the other hand, the solution of one problem can be the source of grounds for rejecting a putative solution of the other - as Darwin's concern for survival and extinction helped to undermine his theory of evolution by accumulation of adaptive variations. One thus has an option to pursue problems for which he thinks he has no satisfactory solution in favor of others for which he thinks - even tentatively - that he has solved. Thus Wallace chose the replacement problem and Darwin the problem of mass extinction in the course of their search and neither choice appears to have put either person at a disadvantage. Accordingly, among the problems assembled in an investigation on several points, there is a degree of freedom is the choice of problems of primary concern or the sequencing of one's investigation of several problems depending in part upon the option to pursue seemingly tractable problems and in part upon the option to pursue the problem which, in the light of tentative hypotheses, appears to pose the greatest difficulty. (iii) We can also within the proposed framework for original research account for some differences between Darwin and Wallace in terms of differences in the initial states of their search and differences in the informational inputs that take place in the course of their search. Wallace differs from Darwin in carrying out his field work in the Amazon and West Indies with Darwin's Journal of Researches in hand. Furthermore, Wallace after 1845 has access to the work of Chambers, which was unavailable to Darwin in 1837-9. Had Chambers' work been available to Darwin, from Darwin's later response to the work, we would also expect differences in their dispositions to use Chambers' work due to differences in the weight they would attach to its evidence. These latter differences can be accounted for by differences in the sociological background of the two persons: Darwin as an established member of a scientific com munity would be more disposed to weigh heavily the negative criti cism directed at the Vestiges from that community than Wallace (Ruse [21], pp. 32-35). Wallace began life as a surveyor and then turned professional collector of specimens without the formal tutelege that Darwin enjoyed at Cambridge. Darwin could thus be expected to be far more cautious than Wallace in embracing the highly speculative ideas of Chambers that often came into conflict with scientifically credible beliefs.</page><page sequence="32">150 SCOTT A. KLEINER (iv) A final degree of freedom is provided by conceptual differences. Wallace thought that there were conceptual problems in the biospecies concept that were not apparent to Darwin. However, his claim that the concept in viciously circular is debatable. Yet there appears a definite connection between Wallace's rejection of that concept and his lack of concern for problems raised by Darwin's 'swamping effect'. 5. CONCLUSION: WHAT CAN WE INFER REGARDING THE 'LOGIC OF DISCOVERY' FROM DARWIN'S NOTEBOOKS? First of all, we should note that 'logic' is used misleadingly in speaking of the 'logic of science', which is said to include the logic of testing and acceptance and possibly the logic of discovery. However, strictly speaking 'logic' consists of principles of deductive and pos sibly inductive reasoning. Logic so construed is normative and used in assessing scientific reasoning, but those principles are not alone sufficient bases for the decisions that must be made in formal and factual scientific disciplines. Principles of deductive and inductive reasoning must be supplemented by epistemic desiderata for such decisions, e.g., coherence with presumed observational or experi mentally based fact, clarity and precision, internal consistency and coherence, explanatory power, and minimal ad hocness. Hence, in seeking a 'logic of discovery' we are not only looking for principles of valid inference, but are also seeking desiderata in terms of which the assessment of scientific theories or components thereof in their various stages of growth can be made and argued for. Secondly, we might be criticized for trying to draw normative methodological conclusions from putative factual descriptions of Darwin's thought. Since Darwin could have made mistaken judgments along the way to the theory of natural selection, the choices he made are not sufficient to support standards for assessing such choices. However, there is little disagreement among biologists today that the theory of evolution by natural selection and the research program directed toward its elaboration and extension are of great epistemic value. This theory is the most powerful of the strictly biological explanatory theories. Whatever means led to the invention of such a theory must have value as means to a valuable end, even though</page><page sequence="33">PROBLEM SOLVING AND DISCOVERY 151 perhaps the means actually pursued by the inventors of the theory might fall short of what in retrospect would appear to be the most efficient means. Also, even if Darwin's steps fall short of seeming ideal efficiency, we may still argue that epistemic or technological considerations - e.g., his state of knowledge or his ability to obtain observational or experimental information - restricted him to this path. Thus Darwin had to make numerous assumptions about inheritance that either he could not justify or that were prima facie paradoxical because his genetic theory did not give a precise account of variation, inheritance or hybridization. It is also possible that received standards for efficient creative scientific research are unproductive when applied to actual research problems, as the traditional inductivist methodology is frequently said to be sterile. Furthermore, we might also find that Darwin actually did appeal to normative standards that are widely received in the philosophical and scientific communities. In this case we need not appeal to Darwin's decisions to justify these norms. They might also not be used in the way or for the purposes that philosophers have taken for granted. Historical data can here be used to argue against received views regarding points of appropriate application of certain standards, e.g., one might argue that the demand for empirical confirmation be suspended while researchers develop the deductive or predictive power of a theory. Thus one can counter the mistaken view that all theories must be immediately subjected to empirical test by arguing from history that theories need 'breathing space' to grow (Lakatos, [12]). One can do this without defending or impugning normative epistemic standards on putative historical fact. One further possibility is that the normative standards of a logic of discovery are invented for research in simplified or mathematically well-defined domains-e.g., search strategies for WSP's. Then, assuming that all properly thought out problems in scientific research fit or should ultimately fit the standards of definition for these domains, it is concluded that those standards ultimately ought to guide all proper scientific research. However, this last assumption is questionable, and has been questioned severely by philosophers attacking the received views in the logical empiricist tradition of the structure of scientific theories and of the confirmation of scientific theories. There does not seem to be any conclusive reason why</page><page sequence="34">152 SCOTT A. KLEINER search strategies for simple mathematically well-defined domains concerning primarily the formal sciences (logic, mathematics) should also be strategies appropriate to the more complex and less well defined problems of many of the factual sciences. Simon's efforts to set up a useful characterization of ISP's for studying search strategies in the factual sciences indicate that he is aware of this problem. However, to the extent that even his ISP's do not reflect actual circumstances of scientific research, his thesis that scientific research should conform to the norms for efficient search for solutions to ISP's is similarly without foundation. We have pointed out that one of the most striking features of Darwin's and Wallace's contributions is their having brought together and related problems that were previously treated disparately. These include the problems of adaptation, extinction, distribution, and similarities of related organisms as well as the origin problem and certain problems in comparative anatomy. Simon does not mention a strategy of assembling and relating problems. Yet this procedure does have the sanction of a methodological desideratum explicitly recog nized by Darwin and which few if any philosophers or scientists would dispute. The credibility of a theory surely should increase as the number of independent facts that it explains increases. Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection is thus justly supported by its power of solving the explanatory problems raised by the putative and initially seemingly unrelated facts of adaptation, extinction, dis tribution, similarities and differences within a genus, vestigal organs, homologous structures, and the branching paths by which species descended from ancestral species. It would appear that in order to gain the kind of evidential support that provided the main grounds for the credibility of Darwin's theory, one should seek to relate pre viously unrelated anomolous facts. It is clear that Darwin did divide certain problems, but the effect of his division was to probe a problem more deeply or analytically rather than to produce sub-problems that could be solved in a routine way. Thus Darwin divides the problem of speciation: How (by what path) does speciation take place? How (by what mechanism) does specia tion take place? What is speciation? Darwin answers the first two of these separately in both the theory of adaptive variation and the theory of natural selection. His phylogeny is the same, but the mechanism is different in these two theories. Both theories also</page><page sequence="35">PROBLEM SOLVING AND DISCOVERY 153 contribute a definition of speciation, viz., reproductive isolation by structure and habit. Both theories also raise further problems: How is the stability of species maintained with the assumed heritable varia tion? How are vew variants maintained with the ever present pos sibility of hybridizing with the non-variants? This division of prob lems and generation of subsidiary problems is a process of analytic inquiry combined with a critical honesty which again exemplifies some of the received desiderata for scientific inquiry. These include the search for precision and specific detail and the willingness to acknowledge whatever further problems one's efforts give rise to. Although Darwin's solution to the first of these problems comes early in the notebooks without the false start appearing in his answer to the second, and his answer to the third survives the eventual destruction of his first theory, there is no evidence that he had an established routine for answering any of them. Only his first mechanism for evolution could be thought of as occurring to him in anything approaching a routine way; this mechanism may have seemed plausible to him upon remembering how coral reefs respond to changes in elevation by growing or receeding in order to maintain a constant relation with the water's surface. Thus he might initially have routinely supposed that adaptive variation maintains a degree of adaptation to changing physical circumstances. However, his early rejection of analogies between the production of domestic races and of wild races indicates that he used no such routine for arriving at the theory of natural selection. Also, the notable stages in Darwin's search are more felicitously viewed as the transformation of some of the assembled problems than as stages toward the solution of some one problem. Thus Darwin initially transforms the problem of adaptation from one of explaining the coordination between form and function by an agent-teleological process to a problem of causally explaining why structure is suited to function in a constantly changing environment without reference to anything comparable to a human agent. However, this problem is soon transformed again to one of explaining why some orders 'pro gress' by becoming structurally and behaviorally more complex while others either do not progress or regress in this sense. The former transformation of the problem, as we have pointed out, is a result of Darwin's mechanistic metaphysics and methodology, but the latter results from the input of new factual information from fossils of</page><page sequence="36">154 SCOTT A. KLEINER ancient animals from the different orders. As the supposed facts requiring explanation change with the addition of new information, the problem space within which Darwin is working is modified and so shifts the problem. To consider now the main problem of concern to Darwin and Wallace, the origin problem, not only is there lacking a decision procedure for determining whether the goal state is reached, but also, as we have argued above, the goal state for why-questions cannot be fully described in advance without actually answering the question. Although Darwin cannot and does not specify in advance the kind of explanatory mechanism he is seeking, he is able to say what kind of causal process he does not want, viz., the agent-teleological process of the creationist theories. His goal state can be described only in terms of a few desiderata, viz., a theory consisting of universal laws applicable to all organisms including humans and bringing together a wide variety of previously unconnected facts, and one in which the process of evolution is 'gradual' in the sense that it is in conformity with Lyellian uniformitarianism applied to living organisms. Specifically, all large evolutionary changes are to be explained in terms of persistant small incremental changes occurring over a long time, and the laws governing these changes are the same throughout geological time even though varying local conditions may produce happenings in the past that are not presently occurring or rather sudden and calamatous effects on local biota (See Lyell, [14], Book I). As his search proceeds Darwin does add some detail to the goal that he sets for himself. His first theory of evolution contributes to the above goal description the demand that the theory postulate the kind of mechanism that maintains a balance in nature, viz., a constant number of species, populations of approximately constant size, and a continual adjustment of form to retain adaptation to changing geolo gical conditions. In the theory of natural selection Darwin offers a different kind of balance from the continual adjustment of form; the balance there becomes one of maintaining an optimal relationship between numbers and the checks including limited food supply, pr?dation, etc., viz., what we might call 'Malthusian equilibrium'. Without a detailed specification of the goal state, progress toward a solution cannot be measured in terms of differences between the present and the goal states of the problem. Hence this kind of means-end heuristic cannot be applied in Darwin's search, and in</page><page sequence="37">PROBLEM SOLVING AND DISCOVERY 155 general it would not be applicable to any similar form of research, viz., searches for explanatory theories. On the other hand, there may be intrinsic characteristics of the various problem states that indicate which lines of search are pro gressive or most promising. Darwin's second theory of extinction is more satisfactory than the monad theory because the latter theory is not consistent with his phylogeny whereas the former theory is. Similarly, Darwin's theory of evolution by accumulation of adaptive variations falls short of his theory of natural selection because the latter theory, but not the former, can account for evidence of evolu tion occurring at different rates and sometimes being retrograde. In these cases progress can be measured in terms of increasing coherence with theory and with putative fact respectively. Note that in these cases progress is measured in terms of widely received scientific desiderata. Simon has mentioned that in practical situations the problem space - i.e., the knowledge relevant to the solution of the problem - is frequently ill-defined. Such ill-definition is a pervading feature of Darwin's search for a solution to the origin problem. The shift in his problem space is evident where he shifts from the view that there is no selection in nature comparable to the selection of domestic ani mals in controlled breeding to the view that Malthus' checks on population provide a selection of those variants with advantageous characteristics. Under the first position, none of the then extensive knowledge of animal and plant breeding, or any experiments that might be conducted therewith, have any bearing on the search for a solution for the origin problem. Once he adopted the second position, he had available the knowledge of the great anatomical and behavioral differences that can be produced by selective breeding as analogical grounds for believing that speciation can be produced in nature if selective breeding persists there. Unlike solving problems such as finding the proof of a theorem in algebra or logic, the search for a solution to a problem in the factual sciences can be re-directed by the introduction of new factual in formation at various stages of the search. In short, the latter kind of search methodologically should always be open to such redirection, and the researcher should include in his search opportunities for such re-direction. This point is simply a consequence of what should be uncontroversial, viz., that factual adequacy is among the desiderata</page><page sequence="38">156 SCOTT A. KLEINER for our theories in physics, biology, etc. It is abundantly clear in Darwin's work that factual adequacy was of primary concern in his search. He responded to Ehrenberg's paper on fossil infusoria and other fossil evidence regarding different rates of evolution by rejec ting his concept of necessarily progressive variation and the ac companying theories of evolution and extinction. Nevertheless his concessions to putative empirical evidence were often tempered by other non-empirical epistemic desiderata, e.g., he persisted in main taining lyellian gradualism in his phylogeny in the face of seeming fossil evidence of the appearance of highly organized life forms without closely related ancestors. Darwin is concerned with the difficulties presented by the fossil record in the 'Notebooks on transmutation', in the 'Essay of 1844', and in the Origin (1859). Here we find a progressive program for explaining away the apparent discontinuities of the fossil record. The 'Notebooks on Transmutation' indicate that Darwin did not persist in searching only the origin problem. Rather there appear to be at least three major lines of inquiry in these notes: (I) Throughout the 'Notebooks' there occur notes on biogeographic anomalies, e.g., similarities and differences between inhabitants of islands and neigh boring islands and continents and between the inhabitants of con tinents in the southern hemisphere (see Grimell, G [7]). His concern here is to explain distribution by means of possible routes of migra tion, land bridges and the movement of continents as well as by transmutation. (II) We have seen that he initially devoted much of his research to the problem of extinction, which troubled him even when he was relatively satisfied that he could explain the origin of new species as the resultant of accumulated adaptive variations. (Ill) We have also seen that the origin problem was not initially actively searched, but again became the object of concern in Notebook D. (Ill) might be thought of as a subproblem of (I) in that a mechanism of evolution, in addition to mechanisms of dispersal and geographic change, is one of several devices for explaining the geographic distribution of spe cies. Darwin's interest in (III) may have begun as a subproblem of (I), but by the end of the 'Notebooks on Transmutation' is is apparent that his primary concern is with the origin problem. Biogeography becomes a source of evidence for his theory of evolution and is thus relegated to an instrumental role from a subject of primary interest in</page><page sequence="39">PROBLEM SOLVING AND DISCOVERY 157 Darwin's thinking. We have also seen that Darwin's monad theory as an attempt to explain extinction and assumed but did not explain phylogenic evolution along branching paths. Likewise his theory of extinction by insufficient progressive adaptation assumed but did not explain putative progressive evolution. The inadequacies of his theory of progressive evolution were probably obscured by his concern with the problem of extinction rather than with the origin problem. As Darwin's interest shifts to the search for a mechanism by which some species produce several descendant species and others die out, his search still continues on several fronts. His pursuit of (I) gives rise to the thesis that variation at birth can accumulate to the point that the species threshold is crossed, and that the descent of species so produced takes a branching path. This geometrical production of species reenforces his concern with (II), the problem of explaining extinction. But his first theory of extinction is destroyed by a product of his search under (I), viz., the phylogenic hypothesis that the descent of species follows a tree-like path where only some branches terminate but others continue to propagate further branches. (I) also supports the first theory he offers in pursuit of (III), viz., evolution by accumulation of adaptive variations. As Darwin's program for (I) includes research into fossils associated with living forms in various geographical regions, his pursuit of (I) is also the source of the factual information that eventually leads him to reject his first theory of evolution. In thus choosing to conduct his search on three fronts, i.e., to search roughly contemporaneously three major problems rather than to persist in searching one until its solution is reached, Darwin adopts something analogous to a 'breadth first' rather than a 'depth first' strategy. His choice of strategy here has at least two advantages over the alternative: Results generated along one line of search are avail able for supporting or criticizing those generated along another line of search. Furthermore, if an impasse is reached along one line of search results generated along another line may show how to deal with that impasse. Darwin's replacement for the defunct monad theory of extinction is an extension of his first mechanism of evolution. The replacement of the monad theory also enabled him to degrade the importance of the problem of the origin of life. Furthermore, his interest in (III) enabled him to move from the (at that time) un</page><page sequence="40">158 SCOTT A. KLEINER productive speculations regarding the movement of continents to the more productive approach to (I) where local variations of species are explained by transmutation. Darwin also made use of what Simon calls 'satisficing' strategies, viz., advancing putative solutions which, although not quite good enough to fit the criteria for the goal state, are 'good enough' in some sense. This strategy is especially appropriate for the kind of problem Darwin is searching, viz., the search for an explanation where only certain epistemic desiderata and at most a substantive framework can be specified in advance for the goal state. The advance specification of the goal state may be altered by filling in more substantive detail in its specification as the search proceeds. Thus Darwin added the substantive desideratum that the theory to explain the origin of new species propose the kind of mechanism that can maintain a balance in nature. On the other hand, reducing the importance of explaining the origin of life or the giving of details phylogenetic descriptions of the origin of the eye (D21) and eliminating the problem of explaining the development of birds or mammals from fishes (C201) are all examples of the strategy of reducing the demands to be placed upon the sought after theory. As we have seen, the first of these was accomplished by rejecting a theory in which spontaneous generation is a pervasive event in nature. The third was achieved through Darwin's phy logenesis where he maintained that mammals, etc., did not descend from anything like modern fishes, but rather both shared a common ancestor. The second question, as well as the details of the descent of mammals, etc., were not justifiably eliminated. Problems like these were illuminated by the discovery of archeoptrix, a link between reptiles and birds, and of a series of fossil horses that enabled paleontologists to reconstruct a detailed description of the evolution of horses. Nevertheless, Darwin sidestepped these problems by directing his efforts more clearly toward a theory that would explain differences between species of one genus, e.g., the different finches of the Galapagos archipelago. Another problem thus sidestepped but not solved or reduced in importance was that of providing an adequate theory of inheritance. In this instance, Darwin eventually set aside the search for the causes of variation and true breeding - although he did at several points in the 'Notebooks on transmutation' and later entertained speculations on these matters. He had to resort to simply assuming that variation</page><page sequence="41">PROBLEM SOLVING AND DISCOVERY 159 did occur in nature that could be accumulated by inheritance to the point of speciation. Unlike the other problems that Darwin eliminated or sidestepped, the absence of a mechanism of inheritance in his theory remained a serious lacuna because inheritance is part of the mechanism by which evolution is supposed to occur. Darwin was aware of this weakness of his theory and directed his efforts, albeit unseccessfully, toward its remedy as in the theory of inheritance offered in his Animals and Plants Under Domestication (1863). Simon's 'satisficing' strategy thus can take several forms: Desi derata specified in the goal state of a problem can be altered so that the demands placed upon a solution are reduced. Furthermore, ques tions can be reduced in importance or eliminated. They may also be sidestepped by focusing on other questions. Finally, as in the case of the problem of inheritance, their import cannot be reduced and their relevance to a line of research may be such that they cannot be sidestepped. However, if an impasse on the question is reached, a search for its solution may be suspended while research continues on other questions into which a research program has been divided or from which a research program has been assembled. To sum up, several strategies appear to have guided Darwin through early stages in the development of his theory of evolution by natural selection. These strategies have normative import for two reasons: First they produced the most important theory in macros copic biology. Second, alternative strategies either would have been inappropriate to the epistemically valuable synthetic character of Darwin's efforts and his final theory, they would have been less conducive to the achievement of received epistemic desiderata, or they would have sidetracked Darwin onto problems that he could not have solved at the time. Darwin's synthesis of problems of adap tation, biogeography, speciation, extinction, embryology, comparative anatomy and biopsychology is a primary source of epistemic support for his theory, and an appropriate means to such synthesis is the effort to assemble a research program by combining a wide range of problems already in the field. His strategy of transforming these problems from the agent-teleological to a mechanistic framework is justified by the epistemic weakness of Lyell's and other creationist theories of adaptation and evolution. Darwin's 'breadth first' search of some of the assembled problems is superior to a 'depth first' search because the former strategy provides opportunities for criticism and</page><page sequence="42">160 SCOTT A. KLEINER redirection of effort not provided by the latter. Also, Darwin suc cessfully applied a strategy of focusing his efforts upon certain problems partly on grounds of the relative import attached to certain problems by the different theories he entertained, and partly on grounds of the practical strategy that one should pursue the problems for which his ability and circumstances best equip him to progress. Finally, the significant differences between Wallace's and Darwin's paths of search can be explained (i) by justifiable differences in their assessment of available factual information, (ii) by differences in factual information actually available at the times of the various decisions constituting their search, (iii) by justifiable options to 'shelve' certain problems and (iv) by justifiable conceptual differences. Accordingly, Darwin's strategy cannot be held to be less 'efficient' than Wallace's in any sense. Also, the similarities in their search strategies are of primary import in our attempts to exemplify a 'logic of discovery' by historical case studies. The differences fall within reasonable options left open by such a 'logic' University of Georgia NOTES * I am indebted to Professors David Hull and Frederick Ferr? for valuable comments on an earlier version of this paper. This work as also facilitated by a summer research grant from the Department of Philosophy and Religion, University of Geogria. 1 The meaning of the relation of homology depends upon the theory of the relations between similar species underlying comparative anatomy. 19th century archetypists such as Goethe, von Baer and Richard Owen would call homologous organs variations on some single feature of the archetypal structure of all quadrupeds. Evolutionists such as Darwin would restrict homologous structures to those that are believed to have evolved by successive modification from some canon ancestral form. Here is a good example of theory ladenness and meaning variance. The extent to which theory here biased what were taken to be observed homologies and how such observations could be taken in support of evolutionist or archetypalist theories is a topic worthy of study. 2 An analysis of the semantic ramifications of the concept of species would divert us from the theme of this essay. However, Michael Ruse's discussion of the species problem (18) contains points that can be used to justify my position that Darwin's and Wallace's problem shift maintained essential semantic continuity with their predeces sors. 3 Their conceptual arguments confirm L. Laudan's contention that conceptual prob lems are as significant as empirical problems in the defense of decisions in the history of science. Lee Laudan, (13)</page><page sequence="43">PROBLEM SOLVING AND DISCOVERY 161 4 Hereafter references to Darwin's 'Notebooks on Transmutation of Species' will be cited 'B' for the first, 'C for the second, etc., followed by the page cited. 5 Note that Darwin's second theory of extinction, which includes the assumption that all variation leading to speciation is necessarily adaptive, is actually incompatible with this conception of variation. For an initially well-adapted organism to fall behind geologic change and eventually perish for lack of adaptation, the value of adaptation must be relative to those geological circumstances. There is no clear evidence that Darwin ever recognized this tension within his second theory of extinction. BIBLIOGRAPHY 1. Beddall, B.
