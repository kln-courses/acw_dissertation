<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTICES OF NEW BOOKS. Der soziale Otitimismus. Von LUDWIG STEIN. Jena, H. Costenoble, 1905. -pp. Vii, 26i. In this volume the editor of the Archiv fuir Philosotihie adds another book to the series of three or four he has already published upon social phi- losophy or sociological philosophy. The two editions of the Sociale Frage im Lichte der Philosohie have already been noticed in this REVIEW (the last edition as recently as Vol. XIV, pp. 504-5), and also (in Vol. XIII) the book by Professor Stein to which this present treatise is most closely related, - Der Sinn des Daseins: Strezfzige eines OtitiMisten durch die Phi- losoih ie der Gegenwart. The most relevant thing to say about this book on social optimism is that it makes perhaps a good deal more of an attempt than the Soziale Frage (the defect of this work, in the writer's opinion) to consider the relations existing between sociology and the deeper questions of philosophy about the relation of knowledge to reality. It is still, however, merely the pragmatic or the ' mental shorthand' view of knowledge that evidently characterizes the Sinn des Daseins, the general serviceableness of ideas and ideals to hu- man thinking, that is here again put forward as Dr. Stein's philosophy. In other words, the lack of the book is still a rationally satisfactory theory of reality. For although Dr. Stein is certainly explicit enough in stating that the evolution of the race, the overcoming of all obstacles that thwart social evolution, is the outcome of cosmic evolution, there is still absent from his book a successful attempt to relate philosophy conceived as the science of ' valuation' to philosophy conceived as the complete theory of reality, as (also an interpretation of his own) the complete synthesis of the thought of an age. This complete synthesis, to be sure, he finds in the philosophy of energetics and its phenomenalism, -its view of ' bodies ' as the I dyna- mic systems' and of the Absolute as only ' relations,' and of ' matter' as a function of energy. But we are not shown how this energy-philosophy is related to the epistemological (Kantian) idealism implied in Fichte's prac- tical philosophy (the true parentage of energetics, according to Stein). Nor are we shown how Hume's biological philosophy (another ancestor) is to be retained as a real thing, if we are to reject, as we evidently must, the phe- nomenalism or the sensationalism of the Treatise of Human Nature. Apart from this defect there is, undoubtedly, in this little book a more complete attempt to present the case for optimism and the "laughing lions" of optimism, for the optimism proper to us men of to-day, as the "I laughing heirs " of all the ages (with power to take from or leave in the past exactly what suits us), than is to be met with in any book that one could 334</page><page sequence="2">NOTICES OF NEW BOOKS. 335 name off-hand in contemporary literature. It is the conviction of Professor Stein that we have had as yet no complete system of optimism, - Leibniz he mentions and promises to take up, but he is passed over probably on ac- count of his finding reality in the individual, - no complete presentation of the history of optimistic thought. He has here entered con amore upon this hitherto unattempted task, and the student will certainly find material for his information and his reflections that at least gives the book its right to exist. Its cheerful confidence and its triumphant acceptance of the doctrine that the ideal world is neither in Heaven nor in Nirvana, but here [there ?] in our future socalized planet, will no doubt be a tonic to the readers of the pathological literature (scepticism, pessimism, illusionism, and what not) of the close of the Nineteenth Century. But whether the philo- sophical student can be content with a theory of ideals as generous illusions on the part of the individual in so far as he is merely a sharer in the Be- wusstseyn fiberhauft upon which reality depends, is a question he must decide for himself after perusing the book. Its text is the following reflection from the economist Gustav Schmoller: "The time will come when all good, normally developed men, will know how to combine individual work and a legitimate effort at individuality and self-assertion with the most complete kind of social justice and the highest sense of the common weal. Let us hope that we will not be obliged to wait so long for this consummation as we have had to wait for the develop- ment of our present civilization from the savagery and animality of primi- tive men." The sabuect matter is not "I individual optimism " but " social optimism." This rests for Stein on the doctrine of energetics or energetic monism. The world, as Fichte saw, is the world of work, not of enjoy- ment. This is of course anthropomorphism, but the ' ideas' after all are not, with Plato and the Platonists of the Nineteenth Century (e. g. Cohen, Natorp, and others), pure thought-functions but instincts, instructive cogni- tions,- things that man has invented to comprehend and express the evolv- ing life that is to be seen everywhere. We are empiricists, says Stein, as to the origin of ideas and ideals, but rationalists as to their validity. (Valid of what ?' we ask. Of our experience, or of reality ? Or is our experience reality?) Nihil est in intellectu quod non antea fuit in instincts. What Descartes and others have regarded as intuitive, ought to be regarded as instinctive. Scepticism and its correlate, pessimism, are both the fruit of Individualism, and with the death of Individualism the day of both will be over. There is a very interesting chapter on Kant and Hume, in which the biological instincts which Hume really trusted are put forward as far more important than the pure ideas or I preexisting concepts " to which Kant attached supreme importance, - despite the naturalistic and evolutionistic character of his views on astronomy, physics, etc. As we have indicated, however, the doctrine of validity is not put upon an objective basis by this mere natural history of thought.</page><page sequence="3">336 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XV. The ultimate source of optimism is the Parsee light-religion as the ultimate source of pessimism is the Buddhistic Nirwana. Just as the pessimists have their phantasy directed in a backward direction, so have the optimists theirs in a forward one (vide Lessing and Nietzsche). But if Stein admits (as he does) that both the backward and the forward direction of thought are incidental to " I valuation, " is not even individual personality somehow more of a thing in itself persisting through the Heraclitean flux of things -than his enthusiastic optimism takes it to be. The book is worth reading on account of its freshness alone and its raising of the question of the epistemology and the ontology of the phi- losophy of energetics. Mention is made throughout of Mach, Ostwald, and their predecessors and their intellectual associates. W. CALDWELL. MCGILL UNIVERSITY.</page></plain_text>
