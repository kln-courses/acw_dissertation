<plain_text><page sequence="1">Macroscope Mirror, Mirror G. A. Bradshaw and Robert M. Sapolsky o i ack in 1974, an unusual report jl-# from Jane Goodall at the Gombe Stream Wildlife Research Centre in Tan zania caught the public eye. Chimpan zees had committed infanticide and were engaging in war. Not only were they acting in unanticipated ways, chimpan zees were acting like humans. GoodalTs discovery bridged the divide between Homo sapiens and other species. In and of itself, similarity between species is no surprise. Scientists have long experimented on animals in place of people; the resulting insights form the backbone of biomedicine and an thropology. We accept that human beings and nonhuman animals share a common ancestry. In biology and psychology, this relationship is the scientific rationale for a system of in ference^?the process and convention used to draw logical conclusions from observations?that allows humans to benefit from research with animal subjects. As such, it was not Goodall's discovery of species similarity per se that provoked such curiosity; it was the specific nature of the similarity. Naked Ape, Hairy Human The Gombe observations blurred the boundary between animal and hu man behavior, between nature and hu man nature. Previously, behaviorists thought that human and animal psy G.

Evidence that psychology, like biology, is conserved between human and nonhuman species augurs a shake-up for science and society chology intersected only in the realm of instinct. Homicide?as opposed to killing for access to territory or a mate?was deliberate, not instinctive. Infanticide and murder were consid ered exclusive to human beings and outside of nature. Goodall's findings challenged this received wisdom. Since then, what we know about our selves and other species has changed substantially. Many studies have docu mented in other species the same be haviors that enrich human lives. We now recognize that species other than humans engage in an array of behav iors that bring variety and depth to life: dolphins teach cultural customs to their young, octopi demonstrate diverse per sonalities, and rats show a sense of hu mor. Once at odds with the conventions of her discipline, Goodall's interpreta tions today are supported by decades of research in neurobiology. They are part of a broad conceptual framework that has coalesced around the idea that psychology, like biology, is conserved among animals. This idea isn't new. Charles Dar win placed human beings on the con tinuum of animal species nearly 150 years ago. Somehow that insight was lost. Nurture is being reconciled with nature, and boundaries that once sep arated academic disciplines are dis solving, all of which bring models of animal and human behavior to unity. Separation has given over to integra tion, and what seemed like a haphaz ard collection of observational anoma lies is now taking form as a coherent, human-inclusive, trans-species theory of mind and body. Same Difference In addition to and underlying these changes in theory, Goodall's data contradicted inferential conventions. Chimpanzee violence suggested that ethologists could infer the origins of chimp behavior from what they under stood about human violence?some thing hitherto dismissed as being con trary to scientific standards. Historically, science has admitted inference from animals to humans but not the reverse. As historians Lorraine Daston of the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science in Berlin and Gregg Mitman of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, recently noted, Ethologists who study animal be havior, including that of primates, with close phylogenetic links to humans, have long made it a principle not to infer humanlike mental states from humanlike be havior and until [recently] many scientists in the field frowned upon any discussion of animal mental states. Perhaps because scientists have been trained to shun such conclusions, ex amples of human-to-animal inference have been scarce in the scientific lit erature. This is one of the reasons that chimpanzee homicide, laughing mice and empathetic sheep are considered newsworthy: They represent deviations from normative models?or rather they used to. Now erstwhile behavioral iso lates make up the empirical bricks in www.americanscientist.org 2006 November-December 487</page><page sequence="2">Jane Goodall's observations in the 1960s provided early evidence?discounted by many sci entists at the time?that human and nonhuman animals shared many mental and emotional traits. In this recent photograph, Goodall duets with the orphaned chimpanzee Uruhara at the Sweetwaters Sanctuary in Kenya. the foundations of psychobiology, and the limits on what we can infer about humans and animals have changed. Human-to-animal and animal-to-hu man inferences are legitimately sym metric. A deeper understanding of brain biology has strengthened this sense of equity. Share and Share Alike The case for inferential symmetry rests on evolutionary conservation?the lev els of shared biology among animal spe cies. At the genomic level, for example, chimpanzees and humans share 96 per cent of their DNA?a figure that rises to 99 percent for genes that actually en code proteins. The genes that determine basic brain segments have changed little since vertebrates diverged from arthro pods more than 500 million years ago. Not surprisingly similar genes give rise to similar structures. Merging human and animal models of brain and behavior raises an interest ing point: Do homologous brain regions among vertebrates, or at least mammals, guarantee similar neural processes? This is a difficult question. If the brain were a computer, then it would be easier to pre dict that two computers with the same architecture and processor would show similar "physiology" However, match ing neural blueprints are no guarantee of consistent responses. Two species may both possess a stmcturally similar region of the brain, yet the size of that region relative to the rest of the brain may differ. For example, two parts of the brain, the basal forebrain and extended amygdala, mediate the same functions in many species. These include the recognition of potential mates and competitors, ritu als for courtship and mating, parental care (when it occurs), aggression, and territoriality True singularities?brain features specific to only one radiation or even species?are rare, but do exist. Certain cell types?Mauthner cells in the spi nal cords of some fish and amphibians and a type of frontocortical neuron in humans?can also be unique. Novel sensory systems, such as the ability to sense bioelectric fields in some sharks, or somatosensory specializations, such as echolocation in bats, are apparent ly specific to the niches occupied by those species. However, these changes in struc ture, function and behavior are neither random nor disconnectedly modular. Rather, they are linked by common an cestry. From an evolutionary perspec tive, there is no reason to favor one direction of inference over the other. Furthermore, the patterns of behav ior across many species are consistent enough to warrant a shared concep tual grammar that would allow scien tists to make a valid inference across species. But how does this change in theory translate to practice? In other words, if old conventions of inference have lost their monopoly, then how should scientists balance similarities with singularities? The answer comes from first principles. Four Square Science constantly winnows stronger hypotheses from weaker ones by test ing them against current knowledge. In making such judgments, a scientist can be right by failing to reject a hypothesis that is true or by rejecting one that is false. Conversely, there are two ways of being wrong: by dismissing a valid hypothesis (what statisticians term a "type I" error) or by embracing an in correct hypothesis (a "type II" error). With respect to inference, if humans share a trait, such as empathy, with some other animal, then the rejection of that possibility constitutes a type I error, or what primatologist Frans de Waal at Emory University refers to as anthropodenial. At the other end of the spectrum lies the type II error of an thropomorphism, the belief that humans share some trait with another animal when they actually do not. Evolutionary theory suggests that species with a recent common ancestor are more likely to have traits in com mon than are distantly related spe cies. Of course, common ancestry does not ensure identity, but as a reflexive stance, neither anthropomorphism nor anthropodenial makes sense. If mor phological, physiological and genetic traits merit bidirectional inference, then there is scant reason to exclude mental states. Continuing to do so encourages systematic (and unrecognized) type I errors, thereby adding to a canon of groundless theory. The obvious gain of a trans-species convention, in which the arrow of in ference is independent of species, is consistency in theory and in practice. This dividend pays off in statistical power and subtler perception. As a bo nus, such a convention would help sci entists from different disciplines, such as ethology and psychology, share the ories and speak a common language. But convergence to commonality calls for some additional sorting out. 488 American Scientist, Volume 94</page><page sequence="3">Spring Cleaning Reorganizing information that no lon ger conforms to past models is what sci ence philosopher Thomas Kuhn called a paradigm shift. This is exactly what has happened with the neuroethological re instatement of humans into the animal kingdom. Similar to other historic shifts in science, the implications are extraor dinary. A trans-species standardization of nomenclature and theory suggests many parallel adjustments in long-held scientific and ethical practices. By eras ing an implicit separation of human be ings from other species, scientists are pressed to address conceptual inconsis tencies and perhaps some uncomfort able conclusions. Chimpanzee homicide is a clear example?society treats the same be havior in human beings as criminal and pathological. Does this mean that we should view a killer chimp as the equivalent of a felon, or must we stretch the definition of "natural" behavior for primates (including us) to include such acts? Evolutionary biologists argue that chimpanzee infanticide might be an adaptive reproductive strategy. In con trast, students of human behavior? lawyers, anthropologists and psychia trists?regard it as abnormal. A model that accommodates both species raises questions of whether chimp violence is a disorder or an adaptive strategy, and of whether the same answer holds for human beings. In another, less theoretical, case, the paradox of using animal models for re search?that they are both categorically different from us and alike enough to study?begs resolution. The same simi larities that justify the use of animals in biom?dical research (an implicit anthro pomorphism) clash with the dissimilar ities that justify the ethics of vivisection (an implicit anthropodenial). Trouble in Mind Such conceptual turbulence might have remained hidden as part of the usual back-and-f orth of science if the topic did not evoke such visceral responses. Old prejudices are hard to relinquish, and humans have held themselves apart from other species for centuries, if not millennia. Oxford evolutionary biolo gist Richard Dawkins refers to this pos ture as "the tyranny of the discontinu ous mind." The same impetus gave rise to the medieval concept of the "great chain of being," in which humans sat above the animals but below the angels. Parasitologist Sean Nee at the Univer sity of Edinburgh attributes this self segregation to a deep-seated fear of sameness. Regardless of its origin, bi directional inference threatens the belief in human superiority and the self-image of those who adhere to it. Thirty years ago, Goodall's chimpan zees reflected back something that in duced powerful theoretical shifts; they may even be credited with introducing disruptive cultural change. The rapidity with which theory and data have moved since then to create a new, radically dif ferent framework portends equally sig nificant change to come. Readjusting to a convention of bidirectional inference helps restore a sense of epistemic coher ency in scientific theory and practice. And, as Kuhn reminds us, no matter what turmoil such change may engen der and how daunting it may appear, the ability to embrace paradigmatic change is one of the characteristics that make science so valuable.
