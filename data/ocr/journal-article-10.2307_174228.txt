Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1989. The three books reviewed in this essay have several features in common. All see war as an imminent threat to humankind's continued existence; all are concerned with the possible influence of genetic factors in aggression and war; all deal with the Seville Statement; and all draw on contemporary ethology and sociobiology for their argument and evidence. The three differ, however, in some key respects. They disagree pro- foundly in their willingness to accept the idea that biological factors signif- icantly shape human behavior generally, and aggression in particular. Two of the books focus on aggression and warfare, whereas the third centers on peacemaking. Two deal with Homo sapiens, while the third looks affection- ately at our primate relatives. One book is a collection of essays; the others are the "standard" authored (or co-authored) monographs. Two books seek to push further forward the frontiers of knowledge, the third is expressly satisfied to restate familiar ideas. The authors vary by discipline (both the social and the biological sciences are represented) and by approach, with one of the books being essentially ethological, a second heavily sociobiological, and the third, well, eclectic. JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION, Vol. 34 No. 3, September 1990 553-582 C 1990 Sage Publications, Inc. 553</page><page sequence="2">554 JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION My primary responsibility, of course, is to discuss the books themselves. But that assignment carries with it the obligation, as well as the opportunity, to comment on the 1986 Seville Statement, since one of the volumes under review springs directly from that document and it is an important topic of discussion in the others. My opinion of the Statement, I should warn the reader, will probably be somewhat less favorable than those of many readers. All of the books under review address a common problem, that is, the extent to which aggressive and warlike "proclivities" are rooted in our evolutionary past. Here, too, my views may differ substantially from those usually encountered in the mainstream "conflict resolution" literature. I think there is an unfortunate tendency for some of those working in this field to denigrate, if not actually deny, the influence of our genetic legacy and to overemphasize the importance of culture in accounting for the extent to which aggression, violence, and war loom so large in human history. As all the volumes concur, faulty diagnosis is not likely to eventuate in effective therapy. THE SEVILLE STATEMENT Signed by some twenty scientists, and subsequently endorsed by more than a dozen scientific and professional associations, the Seville Statement rejects the contention that "biological factors" play any meaningful role in the causation of war. The Statement consists of five propositions, each followed by a brief paragraph of justification and "proof." These five pro- positions are: 1. IT IS SCIENTIFICALLY INCORRECT to say that we have inherited a tendency to make war from our animal ancestors. 2. IT IS SCIENTIFICALLY INCORRECT to say that war or any other violent behavior is genetically programmed into our human nature. 3. IT IS SCIENTIFICALLY INCORRECT to say that in the course of human evolution there has been a selection for aggressive behavior more than for other kinds of behavior. 4. IT IS SCIENTIFICALLY INCORRECT to say that humans have a "violent brain." 5. IT IS SCIENTIFICALLY INCORRECT to say that war is caused by "instinct" or any single motivation. The tone and language of the Statement justifies-almost demands- three further comments. First, as Fox (1988) objected, several of the propo-</page><page sequence="3">Somit / HUMANS, CHIMPS, AND BONOBOS 555 sitions are little more than "shopworn denunciations of ideas that no one ever really held in the first place" (p. 4). Second, at least two of them are almost classic examples of what I would call "disingenuous draftsmanship." Note, in proposition 1, the phrase "animal ancestor." This nicely glosses over the possibility that our proto-hominid and hominid predecessors might have developed such tendencies in the approximately eight-million-plus years after our evolutionary line parted company from those leading to the gorilla and the chimpanzee. One can only admire, too, the use of the word "more" in proposition 3 which denies that our ancestors underwent "selection for aggressive behavior more than for other types of behavior." The accepted ethological view is that, as our species evolved, there was indeed selection for aggression, not that there was more selection for this trait than for dominance, intelligence, or sociability, to mention only some of the likely possibilities. Finally, in a remarkable display of intellectual as well as stylistic super- erogation, all propositions open with the dictum, appropriately capitalized, "IT IS SCIENTIFICALLY INCORRECT to say.. ." Pretentiousness aside, this is dead wrong. In almost every instance, the most sweeping statement that can accurately be made is "There is little (or no) evidence to justify the statement that . . ." To venture anything beyond such cautious language is simply SCIENTIFICALLY INCORRECT. AGGRESSION AND WAR The Seville Statement was quite brief, running barely three printed pages. Apparently apprehensive that still further "proof' was needed, Professors Groebel and Hinde, both signatories, decided to summarize "in non-technical terms, the main part of the evidence on which [the Statement] was based" (p. xii). More precisely, they have sought to dispel two beliefs which, though erroneous, are commonly held in our society. The first is that, because aggressive behavior is in some sense part of human nature, humans inevitably behave aggressively. The second is that international war is closely related to, and even a direct consequence of, the aggressiveness of individuals. (P. xi) Groebel and Hinde, who provide a preface, a chapter, a conclusion, and several "editorials," were joined in this enterprise by fifteen other contributors. Three of the essays provide a useful introduction to what might be called "Aggression as a Behavioral Phenomenon." In the book's opening piece,</page><page sequence="4">556 JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION Hinde and Groebel define aggression, note the various forms it may take, and distinguish among aggression, warfare, and violence. Seymore Feschbach's "The Bases and Development of Aggression" describes the various explana- tions offered to account for aggression: (1) ethological, (2) psychoanalytic, (3) the frustration-aggression hypothesis, (4) what he calls "biological theo- ries," and (5) learning theories which, he remarks, "do not reject. . . biolog- ical influences" (p. 86). The third item that I would place in this group is by J. Herbert (possibly for reasons of economy, we are sometimes given only initials, not full names) who provides a useful, brief summary of the physi- ological factors (hormones, sex differences, brain structure, and others) associated with aggression. Although almost every discussion inevitably touches on the issue, four essays directly address the book's basic concern-"-F'Is Aggression Innate and/or Inevitable?" There are several possibilities: (1) that aggression is neither innate nor inevitable; (2) that it may be innate but not necessarily inevitable; (3) that it is inevitable but not innate; and (4) that it is both innate and inevitable. Needless to say, neither of these last two heresies are espoused by any of the contributors. The "neither innate nor inevitable" position is defended by Jeffrey H. Goldstein who, I think it safe to say, believes that aggression is learned rather than biologically determined. His case is seriously undercut, though, by his insistence that "in many societies aggression is rare or absent," a no- tion which almost all authorities now regard as untenable. A similar "pro- learning" stance is taken by Leonard Berkowitz who, depending on the passage one reads, holds that aggression is either largely or often a response to situational (or"external") events. The view that aggression is innate but not inevitable is argued, respec- tively, by Patrick Bateson and Aubrey Manning. Bateson brings to bear a six-point checklist, wisely warning that a categorical answer to any of these items "is liable to trigger a major academic battle" (p. 38). Five of these items, he concedes, fit "with a 'biological' view of aggression" (p. 46). But the situation is saved by the sixth query, which asks "Is the frequency and form of human aggression unchanged by learning?" (p. 43). The answer he gives is no. So, even if innate, aggression is not inevitable; it can be changed by learning. Manning's reasoning is much the same. In the evolution of our species, he agrees, there was selection for a moderate level of aggressiveness. This evokes the critical question: "Can we then escape from our history?" He is cautiously optimistic, if a bit less so than Bateson:</page><page sequence="5">Somtit / HUMANS, CHIMPS, AND BONOBOS 557 All the evidence goes on to indicate that if we wish to reduce the undesirable manifestations of human aggressiveness, we have the means to do so by consistent and sustained changes to the social climate in which our young people grow up. This will not be an easy task, but it will not be a biological barrier that prevents us from succeeding. (P. 56) Another set of essays examines what the editors call "Communication and Group Processes." I agree with their choice of items but think the section could be more accurately entitled "The Social Sources of Aggression." To lead off, Jacob M. Rabbie reports on the manner in which group membership tends to influence cognitive, emotional, motivational, and normative orien- tations. I concur whole-heartedly with his conclusion that "this paper goes only a little way in describing how research in experimental social psychol- ogy can contribute to an understanding of the problems of war" (p. 154). In the chapter immediately following, Santiago Genoves declares that "one of the most deeply rooted prejudices that hinders peaceful relations among men is racism" (p. 156), an insight followed by a six-page survey and critique of racism. His most recent citation, I feel obliged to add, is dated 1967. Acknowledging that "aggression, like most human behavior, is influenced by a multiplicity of social factors" (p. 165), Kirsti Lagerspetz nonetheless places substantial blame on the media, especially television and film. Re- search has shown that "viewing violence has a causal effect on subsequent violence" (p. 170) and that "the present evidence is clearly strong enough to warrant limitations on the supply of violent programmes in the media" (p. 171). The last piece in this group, by Marshall H. Segall, contends that neither biological nor cultural factors alone provide an adequate explanation for aggression. Drawing on studies of criminal behavior, Professor Segall reminds us that behavioral patterns vary considerably from society to society and that "we cannot understand human aggression without viewing it from a cross-cultural perspective" (p. 183). The volume's fourth major subsection is composed of three essays which, from my perspective, deal with the question "How Can We Reduce Aggres- sion?" Three different, but not necessarily disjunctive, proposals are offered. Leonard Berkowitz who, as we have seen, believes that aggression is learned, discerns a possible solution in learning itself: People must be taught that aggression does not pay and is morally wrong, and that there are alternative ways of responding, other than aggression, when they are exposed to some unpleasant occurrence. The factors producing aggressive reactions can be eliminated, or at least lessened, with some hope of success. (P. 100)</page><page sequence="6">558 JOURNAL OF CONFLICTRESOLUTION Regrettably, he does not indicate just how this is to be accomplished. Pointing to data indicating that "empathy and aggression are inversely related in the elementary school-age child" (p. 108), Norma D. Feshbach advocates an "empathy training program." She offers, as a possible model, a small-scale experimental effort undertaken with seven- to eleven-year-old children. Professor Feshbach, it would seem, anticipates no great difficulty in extending empathy training to adults en masse. The third essay, by Arnold P. Goldstein, examines existing strategies for aggression reduction-control, catharsis, and cohabitation-and declares that "all three [are] destined to failure" (p. 112). He advocates, instead, what he calls "Aggression Replacement Training (ART)," a "recently developed and evaluated intervention approach designed for use with chronically ag- gressive juvenile delinquents" (p. 126). Apparently aware that ART may not be an immediately useful solution to human aggression as we now experience it, Professor Goldstein modestly says that "we offer it not as a model, but as a directional arrow" (p. 129). My initial reaction may have been wrong. After reading this section, I begin to suspect that Professors Groebel and Hinde do have a sense of humor. War, rather than aggression, is the central theme of the fifth and final set of essays, as I see the book. I lead off with the piece by Professor Felicity Ann Huntingford. Because other species do not conduct wars, she argues, the origins of human warfare "are not to be sought in our phylogenetic past" (p. 33). While she may be correct, the reasoning is not impeccable. Even if chimpanzees do not engage in some type of primitive intergroup combat (and there is evidence that they do), the ancestral lines leading, respectively, to chimpanzees and humans parted company millions of years ago. This would have left ample time for our hominid ancestors to have developed warlike proclivities on their own, whether or not these were shared with the other great apes. J. M. Winter's essay is aimed not at its ostensible subject, the "Causes of War," but at polemologists-those who seek to "define, dissect, compare and, wherever possible, measure the life history of human conflicts" (p. 195). Polemologists assume that there are underlying regularities which explain all or most wars. In Professor Winter's opinion, war is much too complicated to be treated in such a fashion. The "causes of war" cannot be "abstracted from the specific, very human and absolutely particular circumstances of the time" (p. 195). He rejects, accordingly, both the "biological analogy" and the "polymological fallacy . . . that 'war' is intrinsic to human society" (p. 200, emphasis in original). Reinforcing my belated appreciation of the editors' sense of humor, the very next piece is by J. David Singer, a leading exponent of the "polemology"</page><page sequence="7">Somit / HUMANS, CHIMPS, AND BONOBOS 559 to which Professor Winter takes such vehement exception. Acknowledging the "methodological, conceptual, theoretical and institutional difficulties of launching a new and politically questionable field" (p. 203), Singer is nonetheless sanguine that "rigorous and systematic research into the etiology of war" will eventually lead to what he calls "more adaptive national policies" (p. 202). Assessing what has been accomplished to date, Singer is confident that "we may yet be in time to put an end to one of the most destructive and dysfunctional activities known to human history" (p. 219). Four of the six sections into which the book is divided, I should add, are prefaced by "editorials" written by the co-editors. Ranging form two to six pages in length, these serve primarily to express their views on the broad issues to which that particular section is devoted and to provide a very brief summary of what they see as each contributor's major concern or theme. The editorials, as the term might warrant, accomplish the first purpose better than the second. The objective of Aggression and War, it will be recalled, was to provide "the main part of the evidence" on which the Seville Statement was based, and to refute the two "myths" at which the Statement was directed: that aggressive behavior "is in some sense part of human nature" and that "international war is closely related to, and even a direct consequence of the aggressiveness of individuals." Even if measured only by these criteria, the book is not altogether successful. Although they all agree that aggression is not necessarily inevitable, several of the contributors make clear their belief that aggression is part of our species' biological legacy. Still, since it is the second "myth" with which the editors (and the Statement) are mainly con- cerned, they have accomplished their task reasonably well. That granted, it is difficult not to be critical on a variety of scores. With seventeen participants, there is considerable repetition and overlap. Many of the essays are too brief (they average about ten pages) to do justice to the complex issues they address. Some of the chapters are at best tangential to the volume's central concern. Some of the proposals advanced for reducing aggressive behavior can only politely be described as utopian. The quality of writing rarely rises above the pedestrian and sometimes fails to achieve even that level. Style, substance, and subject strongly suggest that Groebel and Hinde either had little editorial control or, perhaps more likely, wisely chose not to exercise it. Those for whom the Seville Statement and its underlying issues are new will find Aggression and War instructive, if not always engrossing reading. Those familiar with these issues and this literature will encounter little of which they are not already aware. That may well have been the editors' intention.</page><page sequence="8">560 JOURNAL OFCONFLICTRESOLUT!ON GENETIC SEEDS OF WARFARE As the title of their book testifies, Professors Shaw and Wong, two social scientists, march to quite a different drummer. WhereasAggression and War minimizes, if not denies, the influence of biologically transmitted traits, Genetic Seeds of Warfare assigns it a significant, if not a central role, in explaining violence, aggression, and warfare. There is another important difference: Groebel and Hinde attempt only to summarize existing ideas and evidence; Shaw and Wong are far more ambitious in intellectual aspiration. Genetic Seeds of Warfare addresses much the same issues asAggression and War: Why does our species have such a dismaying propensity for war and why do we find it so difficult to abandon this propensity when it threatens the existence of the human race? (p. 2). After almost a decade of work, a point they make more than once, Professor Shaw and Wong have finally fashioned what they somewhat portentously term "our theory"-that is, "a radical approach that not only challenges contemporary theories of warfare but shows why existing peace initiatives are inept" (p. xi). On analysis, "our theory" consists of three assumptions and two rather sweeping claims. The assumptions are (1) that humans have a "propensity" (sometimes called "proclivity") for aggression and warfare; (2) that this propensity has biological (i.e., evolutionary) roots; and (3) that it evolved because we seek to maximize "inclusive fitness" as that term is understood in contemporary sociobiological theory. The claims are (1) that their radical approach casts new light on such diverse phenomena as African coups d'etat, contemporary warfare, nationalism, and patriotism; and (2) that it also leads to more realistic and promising practical measures in the attempt to restrain the warlike tendencies which threaten our species' existence. I will examine the assumptions and claims in turn, applying two touch- stones: (1) Have Shaw and Wong made a persuasive case? and (2) though admittedly of lesser importance, but not altogether trivial, is "our theory" as novel as they seem to believe? THE THREE ASSUMPTIONS Humans Have a Propensity for War Shaw and Wong inform us, in their opening chapter, that peace "comprises only 8% of the entire recorded history of mankind" (p.3). Over the last 5,600 years, there have been 14,500 wars, or 2.6 wars per year; only 10 of 185 generations have known uninterrupted peace; humankind has managed to</page><page sequence="9">Somit / HUMANS, CHIMPS, AND BONOBOS 561 achieve only 268 warless years out of the past thirty-four centuries. Since 1948 alone, there has been an "average of 12 acts of war occurring simulta- neously per year, with only 26 days of actual peace" (p. 3). The data used by Shaw and Wong have already been severely criticized elsewhere (Jongman and van der Dennen 1988); still, whatever the statistical issues, I am prepared to agree that we are definitely a warlike species. The same conclusion, though, has been voiced by other philosophers and histo- rians dating back to classical Greece. The Propensity for War Has Biological Roots If the historical record is not sufficiently persuasive, there is also consid- erable evidence that species ancestral to Homo sapiens were prone to vio- lence and that peaceful "primitive" societies are exceedingly rare. If further proof is needed, we need look only at the trillions of dollars currently being spent by civilized nations for ever more deadly weaponry. In short, wherever you find Homo sapiens, you find aggression and war. Shaw and Wong are probably correct in making this assumption. To be sure, there is no way to disprove the comforting belief that war, aggression, and other unpleasant behavioral manifestations are primarily the product of cultural conditioning. Nonetheless, social living among mammals almost invariably goes hand-in-hand with hierarchy, dominance, and aggressive behavior. Since humans are among the most social of species, it would be truly remarkable if evolution has made a special exemption in our case. However, the notion that aggression and warfare are part of our genetic legacy is hardly original. It was popularized by Konrad Lorenz almost a quarter-century ago, as the authors themselves note. While Lorenz's biology has long been discarded, his contention that humans are inherently aggressive long antedates the "soft-wired" version advanced by Shaw and Wong. Our Warlike Propensities Are the Result of an Attempt to Maximize "Inclusive Fitness" Employing the now familiar sociobiological concepts of inclusive fit- ness,1 kin selection, and altruism, the authors (chaps. 2 and 3) account for the 1. Eibl-Eibesfeldt (1989) stated: With inclusive fitness, the concept of fitness, previously measured by the number of surviving offspring of an individual [is] extended to not only an individual's own offspring but also to those of close genetic relatives who share a high percentage of the individuals share on the average of 50% of all their rare genes with their offspring and</page><page sequence="10">562 JOURNAL OFCONFLICTRESOLUTION development of in-group amity among the members of what they call "nucleus ethnic" (i.e., genetically related) groups. As these groups multi- plied, there was increasing competition among them for resources. This led to natural selection for "fear and hostility which would be directed increas- ingly toward strangers" (p. 59), that is, toward members of out-groups,2 sentiments which were gradually transformed into biologically transmit- ted xenophobic tendencies. Since balance-of-power considerations favored larger groups, the resulting expansion of group size (via either voluntary or coerced coalescence) set into motion a "second" process of selection, this time for the "capacity of individuals to identify their respective inclusive fitness with group security even though significant numbers of the groups may not be biologically related" (p. 60). The psychological mechanisms facilitating the development of in-group loyalty, of xenophobia, and the subsequent transfer of loyalty to the larger, nonkin-related group are then explicated (chaps. 4 and 5). The authors rely heavily on the concept of "epigenesis"-a biologically transmitted tendency, evolved over the history of a species, to learn, recognize, or behave in one fashion rather than another when faced with appropriate environmental stimuli. Epigenesis works to "bias" rather than directly control learning and behavior, thus avoiding the deterministic implications of instinct. These epigenetic biases "contributed directly to intolerance and hostility toward members of out-groups during humanity's past (nucleus ethnicity); in today's national and multi-ethnic states, they do so "indirectly and covertly" (p. 85). How, in a society where kin relationships have long evanesced, does the individual decide with what group to affiliate and "with what degree of intensity and commitment [to] serve that group in warfare?" (p. 109). For this purpose, according to Shaw and Wong, we evolved five "recognition markers": common phenotype (physical appearance), descent, language, homeland, and religion. Understandably, these markers work best in an "ethnically homogenous society" or what the authors call a "cultural ethnic group". In multiethnic societies, group cohesion may be threatened and "cultural incentives must be introduced to foster and protect inclusive fitness priorities" (p. 110). siblings, 25% with their grandchildren, nieces and nephews, etc. Thus, if one individual sacrifices itself to save two of its offspring or four of its grandchildren, cost and benefit would be in balance. (P. 92) 2. In arguing their case for "closed" groups among early humans, Shaw and Wong draw an analogy from chimpanzee behavior, relying primarily on Goodall (1986). But Goodall deals with Pan troglodyte, not with Pan paniscus whose behavior seems considerably closer to our own.</page><page sequence="11">Soinit / HUMANS, CHIMPS, AND BONOBOS 563 Epigenesis, the authors emphasize, "does not embody hard-wired psycho- logical processes that are genetically programmed and leave no role for accumulated social knowledge in human action" (p. 111). That is, we are biologically predisposed toward xenophobia; we do have a proclivity for warfare-but not hopelessly and irrevocably so. Shaw and Wong's theory of how in-group loyalty, xenophobia, and then "larger" societal loyalties evolved is cast in terms of Wilsonian sociobiology with inclusive fitness as the impelling biological mechanism. Needless to say, sociobiology has its critics. Since there is already a sizable literature on this topic,3 I will say only that while inclusive fitness may account for the behavior of some social insects, it strikes many biologists as decreasingly useful when we turn to mammals, to the higher primates, and to our own species. There is considerable evidence that, among the primates in particu- lar, animals pursue other goals-status, power, and recognition-than the assiduous replication of their genes.4 Furthermore, the move from the nucleus ethnic group to larger, nonkin-related societies took place, by evolution's clock, barely yesterday. This leaves so little time for the postulated "second- stage" selection that some scholars contend that "the shift in boundary conditions between In-group and Out-group is entirely a cultural solution to a biological and economic problem" (McGuiness 1987, 304). Finally, the idea that we can find the origins of war in the prehistoric competition for resources and power among small, genetically related groups and tribes is one already familiar to both social scientists and biologists. Similar views can be found, for example, in Reynolds (1987) and McGuiness (1987). The concept of "epigenesis" traces back, of course, to Waddington (1957) and was first utilized in political science, if I am correct, by Schubert (1981). THIE TWO CLAIMS New Light on Coups d'etat, Nationalism, and Patriotism The foregoing propositions, the authors announce, "set the stage for a radical reinterpretation of conflict and warfaring propensities in contempo- 3. Among the best known and detailed critiques are Sahlins (1976), Ruse (1979), and Kitcher (1985). The latter provides a useful bibliography. For comments bearing directly on sociobiology as explaining warlike behavior, see Reynolds (1987) and Li Puma (1987). 4. Thus, "[Bleing dominant appears to be its own reward-to be highly satisfying and to be sought, regardless of whether it is accompanied by advantage in food, sex, or grooming" (Savin-Williams 1987, 163).</page><page sequence="12">564 JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION rary society." More specifically, "they cast new light on coups d'etat in Africa . . . [and] provide new insights on nationalism and patriotism as mobilization devices in humanity's propensity for warfare" (p. 111). African Coups d'~iat. Between 1960 and 1982, military coups effected a change of power in some 55% of sub-Saharan African states; there were also 56 attempted coups and 102 reported coup plots. Over the next half-decade, the number of successful coups, plots, and reported plots rose from 210 to 230, "an average of almost 10 per year between 1960 and 1984" (p. 117). Why so many coups? Shaw and Wong have a ready explanation: tribal rivalries. Or, as they put it: Loyalty and identity of individuals in nucleus ethnic groups will almost inevitably be directed toward their own cultural ethnic group. The identifica- tion between one's nucleus ethnic group and cultural ethnic group will be strong, sometimes rendering the two indistinguishable in the individual's mind.... Given that the military is often the most modern and efficient sector in Africa, coups d'6tat tend to be a frequent means of seizing state apparatus, and mobilization for coups d'etat tends to be based on cultural ethnic group membership. (Pp. 127-28) I am quite prepared to accept that tribal loyalties are among the leading factors underlying the incessant coups with which Africa has been afflicted. But coups are not wars. Coups are speedy seizures of power carried out by a relatively small handful of military personnel. Wars, on the other hand, are conflicts between nations, conflicts often engaging a sizable percentage of the population, and all too often protracted over long periods of time. Studies of African coups, I submit, are not an appropriate test for a theory which purports to explain the persistence of warfare. Shaw and Wong are aware of this difficulty and attempt to address it: Though coups d'dtat in Africa may appear ostensibly different from warfare, it is reasonable to treat them as a special case of warfare. By definition, African coups d'etat are made possible by the legacy of the European state. Were this legacy not present, coups d'etat would likely be replaced by more direct intergroup warfare involving the same kinds of groups now struggling for reins of state power. Moreover, were coups d'6tat not a workable means of transfer- ring power in Africa, civil war along ethnic lines would undoubtedly be more prevalent. (P. 120) The reader will have to judge the plausibility of the reasoning that coups are a "special case of warfare' because they "are made possible by the legacy of the European state." I forbear to comment on the balance of the paragraph. Nationalism. Shaw and Wong next apply their ideas to nationalism and patriotism, concepts between which they draw a sharp distinction. The</page><page sequence="13">Sonit / HUMANS, CHIMPS, AND BONOBOS 565 essence of nationalism is that it rests on, and is derived from, a common ethnicity. As we learned earlier, humans identify initially with the nuclear ethnic group, then with the cultural ethnic group, and if and when nationalism achieves statehood, with the nation-state. It is via this "identification mech- anism that the nation becomes a psychological extension of one's nucleus ethnicity and, thus, the preferred larger group for inclusive fitness maximi- zation" (p. 140). To be sure, Shaw and Wong do not rely entirely on inclusive fitness: Mass communication, "common aspirations and shared visions," religion, and language all play a role in the process. In the final analysis, though, the controlling assumption is that "nationalism's powerful appeal lies in its inclusive fitness logic. It renders the nation a suprafamily for its members" (p. 142). Fundamental to the development of nationalism are the "recognition markers" (language, physical similarity, and so on) previously mentioned, as well as "common aspirations and shared visions." The process is accelerated, of course, by the spread of literacy and the development of mass media. Patriotism. Whereas nationalism is the sentiment which binds together those with a common cultural and ethnic background (i.e., the nation-state), patriotism is an ideology which seeks to encourage loyalty in those political entities made up of diverse ethnic populations. Like nationalism, patriotism "thus emerges as a vestige of humanity's propensity for warfare" (p. 162). But there is a critical difference "the inclusive fitness logic of nationalism is far more potent than that of patriotism." When the two clash, "patriotism is typically undermined" (p. 161). Japan, Israel, South Africa, and Iran are offered as examples of national states; the United States and the USSR are instances of multiethnic states where patriotism, rather than nationalism, serves as the key "mobilization" force. We have here three separate contentions: (1) that nationalism and patrio- tism arise under quite different historical circumstances and meet quite different political needs; (2) that, in the modern state, nationalism is much more powerful than patriotism; and (3) that both nationalism and patriotism stem from the inexorable working of "inclusive fitness logic." Accepting their definitions for purposes of discussion, I see no compelling reason to quarrel with the first two contentions. I will also agree that there may be a biological (i.e., genetic) component in nationalism and possibly (assuming there is a difference) in patriotism, At this point, though, I draw the line. I am thoroughly skeptical of their insistence that these two senti- ments derive primarily from "inclusive fitness logic" or "priorities." This skepticism rests on several grounds: First, if the maximization of inclusive</page><page sequence="14">566 JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION fitness is the "ultimate" objective, and these two behaviors (nationalism and patriotism) are explained in terms of inclusive fitness, then they should be able to demonstrate that the behaviors in question actually serve their presumed purpose. I do not think it unreasonable, consequently, to ask for evidence which suggests, let alone demonstrates, that "inclusive fitness logic" is actually operative in either or both of these instances, (or, as will already have occurred to the reader, in their explanation of African coups). As a once popular television commercial asked, "Where's the beef?"5 Second, it appears that diametrically opposed different behaviors can be interpreted as flowing from "inclusive fitness logic." Thus, in the discussion of multiethnic societies, both those who decide to fight in behalf of the state and those who choose not to are seen as maximizing their inclusive fitness. It is manifestly a theory of remarkable elasticity-and apparently impervious to falsification. I am uneasy, too, about the authors' tendency to talk of selection for inclusive fitness as operating at (or on) the group (i.e., ethnic minority) level. A concept originally advanced to account for individual behavior becomes, as the argument requires, a collective phenomenon. Perhaps this is only careless language, or they may actually regard this to be the case. Just as Shaw and Wong seem to shift from individual to group selection in explaining nationalism and patriotism, they also appear to place increasing emphasis on culture, socialization, and the deliberate manipulation of polit- ical symbols. Granted, there is no a priori reason why culture might not work to further inclusive fitness. Still, as "our theory" leans more and more heavily on learning and indoctrination, one begins to wonder whether socialization, rather than the incessantly clanking machinery of inclusive fitness, might not account for these same behaviors just as well.6 Toward a More Realistic Approach to War Alternative Explanations of Our Proclivity for War. Competing explana- tions of war are discussed in a twenty-page chapter, objectively titled "On Biases, Blinders, and Dead Ends," which examines (1) arms race models; (2) the contention that, at least in contemporary society, the military-industrial 5. Shaw and Wong do tell us, repeatedly, that their research is ongoing and that another volume is in preparation. Conceivably, they may have reserved the requisite documentation for the next book. Nonetheless, I think they owe the reader some explicit recognition, de minimus, that theirs is a theory that can be tested empirically. 6. As Eibl-Eibesfeldt (1989) put it, "Humans appear to have an innate tendency to form larger groups and establish group identity. Group communalities are created as groups develop symbols of identification and distinguish between in- and out-group members" (p. 296).</page><page sequence="15">Somit / HUMANS, CHIMPS, AND BONOBOS 567 complex is a major cause of war; (3) Marxist explanations; (4) the notion "that warfare is perpetuated by males" or the "male supremist complex"; and (5) game theory. The authors reject the first four and find reassuring support for their own ideas in the fifth. Along the way, they deliver themselves of judgments, such as (a) "humanity's propensity for warfare is equally preva- lent among women and men" (p. 179), and (b) that while they largely agree with the Seville Statement, "it comes out empty handed when advocating a way out of warfare" (p. 193). I can only admire the authors' commitment to female equality. Practically everyone who has studied this problem argues that, among mammals, the males are far more prone to aggressive behavior than females.7 (We will subsequently return to possible differences between the sexes in this and related forms of behavior.) Their initial endorsement of the Seville Statement is soon followed by the charge that the Statement "incorrectly and unscien- tifically advocates the primacy of a cultural interpretation of war" (p. 193). So it does. How, then, can the disciples of inclusive fitness maximization "largely agree"? The Theory Applied: Does Peace Have a Chance? A major purpose of this book was to "show why existing peace initiatives are inept." Declar- ing that "existing theory on the subject is moribund," the authors ask, "Can we possibly say anything of policy relevance that has not be said before?" (p. 196). The answer is a qualified yes, and their closing chapter is devoted to that task. First, though, they analyze the shortcomings of traditional efforts to cope with humankind's warlike proclivities. Previous attempts fall into two categories, "top-down policies" and "bottom-up approaches." Top- down policies rely on action by a centralized world authority such as the United Nations or, alternatively, for unilateral steps by a superpower. Neither will work because "ultimate causes are not addressed." Bottom-up ap- proaches, on the other hand, attempt to mobilize "everyday citizens." These fail because they "are often at odds with our most widely shared attachments and most treasured symbols, those associated with nationalism and patrio- tism" (p. 201). Not surprising, Shaw and Wong advocate a "new approach" which rec- ognizes that we have "evolved as successful inclusive fitness maximizers" 7. Two examples should suffice. "From man to mouse, with few exceptions, the male of the species is more aggressive than the female and the most frequent target of that hostility is a male conspecific.... Humans are no exception to this general zoological principle" (Moyer 1987, 2-3). And, "[Tlerritorial defense and rivalry fights in primates and many other mammals produce physically more powerful and aggressive male individuals. We also bear this heritage" (Eibl- Eibesfeldt 1989, 288).</page><page sequence="16">568 JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION and that "policy initiatives must utilize this evolutionary trait rather than oppose it." They then sketch "what a new approach would have to incorporate to defuse the ultimate causes of war" (p. 204). If "our theory" were to be adopted and applied, both variants of top-down approaches would be changed. Taking the centralized world authority ver- sion, the United Nations would have to deal with the notion of national interest. National interest could no longer be taken for granted as positive and legitimate. It would be necessary to differentiate between national interest with positive implications for peace and that with negative implica- tions (p. 204). For the superpower variant, our theory implies that superpowers would have to acknowledge that threats of nuclear annihilation emanate from both sides.... Were both sides con- vinced that threats of species annihilation originated equally from within and without, superpower negotiations could not help but be conducted in a quali- tatively altered environment. (Pp. 204-5) The bottom-up approach would also be changed: What needs highlighting is that once educational programs were to acknowl- edge humanity's propensity for warfare, superficial teachings or utopian schemes would be seen for what they are. Moreover, realistic initiatives would be required to truncate or redirect the continuum of humanity's propensity for warfare without taking on the impossible task of eradicating all of its elements. (P. 205) By stressing that we are "incorrigible inclusive fitness maximizers," it might then become possible to convince ourselves that humanity's current situation threatens inclusive fitness maximization. To do so would require the ability to "see" that nationalistic and patriotic sentiments, which have evolved to foster and protect inclusive fitness, now threaten inclusive fitness in a world of belligerent nuclear powers. (Pp. 205-6) The concluding paragraph is their peroration: In the final analysis, we can only hope for time to educate a new Homo sapiens.... Perhaps more important is to recognize that the cultural evolution of groups has yet to take the next step, one where the welfare of humanity becomes identified with the imperative of inclusive fitness. Only then might a clear perception of "what is" be harnessed to prepare mankind for a society of "what ought to be." (P. 209) How promising is this putative "new approach"? I would prefer to leave that judgment to the reader, who may perhaps share the authors' faith that inclusive fitness is truly the philosopher's stone for which peacemakers have</page><page sequence="17">Somit / HUMANS, CHIMPS, AND BONOBOS 569 so long sought. Nonetheless, a reviewer has some responsibilities which cannot be shirked completely. While the "new approach" ostensibly indicates what should be done, little is said as to how the desired transformations in public thinking are to be accomplished. (That, to be sure, may also be reserved for their next volume.) Furthermore, I do not find much that is either novel or particularly hopeful in the proposal that we tell the public about the dangers inherent in national- ism and patriotism, of the threat to our species posed by nuclear war, or that the seeds of warfare are part of our genetic makeup. Now for some remarks about the book taken as a whole. I heartily commend Shaw and Wong for their attempt to relate the frequency and persistence of warfare to our evolutionary past. Many have suggested such a relationship; they are among the first to offer an explanation which encompasses nationalism and patriotism as well. It is an explanation with which I agree, at least in broad principle. They are to be praised, too, for stressing that human behavior is the product of an active interplay between genetically programmed proclivities, on one hand, and environmental situa- tions and stimuli, on the other. Epigenesis avoids both hard-wired determin- ism and either-or (nature vs. nurture) dichotomies. At the same time, it forces on us the realization that our species may be "soft-wired" to favor certain behaviors and cultural options-and to be stubbornly resistant to others. In all these respects, I think they have taken a more realistic approach to the problems of aggression and war than is reflected, by and large, in Groebel and Hinde. And their reminder of the power of nationalism/ethnicity to compel human loyalties-and to threaten the viability of multiethnic states-could hardly be more timely. Nonetheless, having swallowed the camel, there are some sizable gnats at which I strain. Inclusive fitness may account for xenophobia and kin group warfare but I find it unpersuasive when stretched to explain nationalism, patriotism, and contemporary warfare.8 I doubt, for example, that very many of the millions of soldiers who died during the last two great wars were motivated to any significant degree by the desire, conscious or unconscious, to maximize their inclusive fitness. One more related reservation. At the outset, in dealing with early humans living in kin groups, Shaw and Wong treat the maximization of inclusive 8. "Sociobiologists . . . should be more alert to the fact that it is neither necessary nor correct to try to show that human beings always, or even most of the time, behave adaptively. It is sufficient to underscore the probable evolutionary origin of given classes of behavior, i.e., the persisting effects of forces that very probably hark back to our evolutionary past" (Carey and Lopreato 1989; 12).</page><page sequence="18">570 JOURNAL OFCONFLICTRESOLUTION fitness as an essentially unconscious and unpremeditated behavior. Later, though, they describe it as almost a deliberate, conscious pattern of choice. Thus, Rather, the identification mechanism operates to select a preferred group from the choices available. If the individual has no real choices, if membership is by "conquest and serve," the identification mechanism will also not be deter- ministic with respect to how strongly the individual will identify with the larger group.... Individuals today must make choices about belonging to groups larger than their own nucleus ethnic group for survival and reproduction. (P. 94) As with their seeming shift from individual to group selection, I do not know whether this is metaphoric language or their own view. On this and similar matters, I fear, Shaw and Wong were not served as well as they might have been by their publisher in the choice of readers, whom they thoughtfully name. All three are highly competent political scientists. Nonetheless, for a book which relies so heavily on still contentious evolutionary concepts, it would have been wise to have sought the opinion of a biologist or two, and certainly of someone not totally enamored of sociobiology. Turning from biology to political science, the treatment of war could be improved.9 The reader gets the sense, especially early on, that the authors view war as a spontaneous manifestation of mass sentiment. Little weight is given to the personal ambitions and animosities of those in high office, political rivalries, dynastic aspirations, or the capacity of the regime to compel, as well as persuade, military service. Not the many but the few make the ultimate decision to take up arms. PEACEMAKING AMONG PRIMATES Frans de Waal's previous book, Chimpanzee Politics (1982), described a bitter, sometimes murderous struggle for dominance among the adult chim- panzee males living in a colony housed at the Netherland's Arnhem Zoo. Although appalled by the violence he observed, de Waal was struck by the fervent, emotional "making up" which occurred after even the bloodiest clashes. At the primate level, he realized, "intricate societies are unthinkable without conflict resolution" (p. 26); peacemaking is a biologically indispens- able concomitant of aggression and violence; and it is peacemaking and aggression together which make social living possible. De Waal's subsequent 9. There are some curious bibliographic omissions. Among those which implicitly came to mind are Nettleship, Dalegivens, and Nettleship (1975) and McGuiness (1987), although the latter may have appeared after Genetic Seeds of Warfare went to press.</page><page sequence="19">Somit / HUMANS, CHIMPS, AND BONOBOS 571 search of major psychology texts yielded abundant references to violence and aggression but, with the exception of the purely clinical literature, no mention of peacemaking or "forgiveness" (p. 233).' Peacemaking Among Primates (henceforth simply Peacemaking) is intended to call attention to this important but neglected aspect of primate behavior. It does so in engross- ing fashion. Its title notwithstanding, Peacemaking, no less than the Genetic Seeds of Warfare and Aggression and War, is concerned with aggression and its consequences. In fact, the book's prologue is devoted to a discussion of war and, in particular, the Seville Statement. De Waal 's treatment of the Statement strikes me as curiously equivocal. Barely two sentences after endorsing the Statement "with substance as well as with spirit", he (correctly) complains that the Statement's authors "chose to downplay our evolutionary history" (p. 2). For de Waal, "The aggressive nature of humans is undeniable.... The question is not how to eliminate aggression from this world-a hopeless enterprise-but how to keep aggression under control" (pp. 4-5). That, in essence, is his response to the query provokingly posed in the opening sentence of the book's dustjacket, "Does biology condemn the human species to violence and war?" De Waal's circumspect answer rests on three premises. First, that if we wish to understand human aggression, we should study its manifestations in those species to which we are genetically most closely related (this was also the theme of de Waal's (1982) book, Chimpanzee Politics). Second, aggres- sion and peacemaking are indispensable components of the behavioral repertoire required by a social species such as the primates. Peacemaking and reconciliation are behaviors that have evolved to keep in-group aggression within "species tolerable" limits. Third, to the extent that it contributes to war, aggression now threatens the survival of our own species. We may be able to lessen that threat if we can manage a better grasp of the interplay between these seemingly polar modes of behavior. Peacemaking examines its eponymous subject as observed among five primate species: rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta), stump-tailed monkeys (Macaca arctoides), chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), bonobos, (actually, a sister chimpanzee species, Pan paniscus), and (very sketchily) Homo sapi- ens. For me, the book raises several intriguing questions: What does it tell us about peacemaking among primates generally? What does it have to say about peacemaking in our own species? What else of behavioral importance can we learn about ourselves? And, perhaps logically prior, what are the 10. I imagine that it did not occur to de Waal, a biologist, to examine the social science conflict resolution and peace studies literature. He would probably have found there some of the key terms, if not substantive content, for which he was looking.</page><page sequence="20">572 JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION hazards of generalizing from the behavior of one species to that of another, even where the two are genetically quite similar? First, a warning: As those who have read Chimpanzee Politics will surely recall, de Waal is unabashedly anthropomorphic. The animals he studies have names and distinct personalities; their activities provide ample material for several simian soap operas. De Waal's chimpanzees and, to a lesser degree, monkeys engage in practically every type of behavior known to humans. They have secret affairs, make deals, bully, console, scheme, cheat, are embarrassed, conceal their intentions, plan, form coalitions, deliberately deceive, play balance-of-power politics, grovel, commit murder, possibly attempt castration of their enemies, predict, tease, are self-conscious and, when it comes to the bonobos, live by the maxim, "make love, not war." To those who object to such an interpretation, de Waal has a simple rejoinder: "But they do." He may be right. In any event, this practice, an uninhibited writing style, and the photographs used to make his points give the book an impact occasionally lacking in the other volumes covered in this review. You may not agree with de Waal, but you will not be bored. Beneath the stories, the pictures, and the popular style, I should add, there is solid, scientific substance. As he goes to some pains to make clear, his anthropomorphic conclusions are based on endless hours of patient observa- tion, detailed research protocols, painstaking recording of events, and suffi- cient statistical analysis, I trust, to satisfy the most assiduous bean counters. Several reviewers (and I was among them) voiced methodological reserva- tions about Chimpanzee Politics because the animals were not free-ranging. The bonobos on whom he reports reside in the San Diego Zoo which, no matter how commodious, is inevitably more confining than their natural habitat. This is a limitation to which de Waal himself calls the reader's attention. We start with a seeming paradox: Aggression and its sibling, dominance, are behavioral patterns which evolved among social mammals to minimize the likelihood that intraspecies violence will become so severe that it eventu- ally endangers the survival of the species itself. The explanation of the paradox was, I believe, initially proposed by Konrad Lorenz. Aggressive behavior, rarely carried to the point of life-threatening violence, establishes a hierarchy of dominance and submission among those within the group. Dominants perpetuate their position largely by threats or by inflicting minor bites or blows; subordinates avoid or minimize injury by the submissive behavior characteristic of their species. The resulting social structure is thus maintained with only minor incidence of bodily harm to its members. The obvious exception arises when the position of one of the dominant animals</page><page sequence="21">Somit / HUMANS, CHIMPS, AND BONOBOS 573 is challenged. Even when this occurs, the outcome is rarely determined by physical combat alone. Quite often, displays and threats suffice; the previous dominant is displaced, or the challenger again submits, without fatalities-or even serious injuries-on either side. In short, aggression establishes a social rank-ordering which remains fairly stable without the necessity for continual intraspecific fighting. Recourse to real violence occurs primarily when the position of a dominant is challenged, and not always then. But the situation is also one of considerable tension. By threats and minor physical attacks, dominants constantly demand acknowledgement of their superior status; subordinates, in response to threats or actual assault, are continually compelled to perform the appropriate acts of submission. Fur- thermore, dominance is no sooner established by one individual (or coalition) then other individuals (or factions) "scheme" to undermine it, or so the dominants may suspect. This leads, in turn, to more aggressive behavior, more demands for submission, and so on. Primates are intelligent, they can look ahead, and they have long memo- ries. Life for dominants and subordinates alike (and surely for the latter) would be almost intolerably stressful in the absence of behaviors designed to facilitate "making up" after these recurrent agonistic incidents, behaviors which reassure all parties that the quarrel is resolved, if not altogether forgotten, and that amicable relations have been reestablished. Consequently, peacemaking and reconciliatory behavior evolved in conjunction with ag- gression. Peacemaking and reconciliation provide the social lubricant which makes it possible for aggression and dominance satisfactorily to serve their evolutionary objective and for the group to function without incessant bloodshed and violence. De Waal begins his survey of primate peacemaking with Pan troglodytes, the chimpanzees he studied for so many years at the Arnhem Zoo. By his count, about half of all chimpanzee quarrels, trivial or violent, eventuate in some form of observable reconciliation. Making up occurs rather quickly: "[A]round 40 percent of the time, opponents contact each other within half an hour of their aggressive encounter" (p. 42). Where the incident has been fairly minor, the initiative may be taken by either the dominant or the subordi- nate. Where the fighting has been more serious, the dominant will reject all overtures until the opponent makes the proper submissive displays. Some- times, when the dispute has been particularly nasty, a third chimpanzee may try to serve as mediator and, in effect, force a reconciliation on manifestly reluctant combatants. Such a role, de Waal relates, was played by a ranking female, Mama, who would wind up "sitting with one full-grown male in each arm" (p. 42). The importance of the making up process is well understood</page><page sequence="22">574 JOURNAL OF CONFLICTRESOLUTION by the other chimpanzees. Peacemaking between senior rival males is greeted with joy by the entire troop, with visible and vocal expressions of relief and an unmistakable relaxation of tension. Chimpanzees making up is disconcertingly human-like. As with us, "apes avoid eye contact during strained relations and seek it when ready to reconcile" (p. 114). Once eye contact has been established, either or both of the animals will move, albeit sometimes quite tentatively, to establish phys- ical contact. Kissing is another mode of making up which humans and chimpanzees share. According to de Waal, "[W]hen you see two chimpan- zees engaged in a protracted kiss, chances are that they confronted each other not long ago" (p. 43). Peacemaking concluded, the erstwhile antagonists then groom each other. Close physical contact, I must add, is an essential aspect of chimpanzee social life where grooming of fellow speciates, and being groomed, plays a major role in maintaining as well as reestablishing friendly relations. De Waal turns to peacemaking in two monkey species, rhesus and stump- tailed (members of the macaque family). Although rhesus monkeys are reputed to be "the nastiest, most intolerant primates alive,"' they, too, have evolved forms of peacemaking. In reality, de Waal remarks, they had no choice-"there is simply no other way for any animal that prefers group life to a solitary existence" (p. 6). Unlike humans and apes, rhesus monkeys maintain eye contact during antagonistic episodes but avoid it when "ready to reconcile." As a species, rhesus monkeys "are not very good at reconciliation, but they do have many subtle ways of letting one another know when a conflict is over" (p. 119). Foremost among these is an accidental (though clearly premeditated) phys- ical contact, or very close proximity, which conveys the message "Look, I'm not going to hurt you." Rhesus monkeys tend, in de Waal's opinion, to make implicit rather than explicit reconciliation, that is, a mutual tacit agreement to act as if nothing has happened. Reconciliation occurs much less often than among chimpanzees, though with sufficient frequency to warrant the conclu- sion that "rhesus monkeys are attracted to individuals with whom they had had an aggressive encounter. It is not just a matter of seeking calming contact with conspecifics; the former enemy is the preferred partner" (p. 119). If rhesus monkeys' peacemaking tactics "are often too subtle for humans to grasp their meaning," the opposite is true of their stump-tailed cousins:"2 11. Characteristically, de Waal hastily adds, "I share this opinion but have come to like these little rascals nonetheless" (p. 6). 12. After citing an unflattering description of the macaques, alleged to be among "the ugliest of all primates," de Waal counters that "anyone who knows stumptail monkeys better, though,</page><page sequence="23">Sonit / HUMANS, CHIMPS, AND BONOBOS 575 Of the primates treated in this book, stump-tailed monkeys make peace in the most predictable and conspicuous manner. I can guarantee the occurrence of a handful, perhaps even a dozen, unambiguous cases in a single afternoon. Stumptails reconcile at a high rate, within one or two minutes after a confron- tation, and often with a lot of noise; you simply cannot miss it! Stump-tailed monkeys' peacemaking behavior is similar to that of chim- panzees: presentation of the bottom, kissing, genital inspection, touching, and so on. It is also highly explicit: "Special grunts announce an upcoming reconciliation, whereas loud squeals attract attention to the event itself" (p. 161). No matter who initiates the process, conflict resolution is unmis- takably a "status ritual," with the subordinate presenting to the dominant some 94% of the time (p. 163). To this point, I have passed over much of de Waal's discussion of sexual behavior as largely tangential to peacemaking. Here, however, there is a welcome exception. Among this fortunate species, he writes, "Occasionally, however, we do notice an orgasm face during reconciliation. It is a revelation to know that nature has provided stumptails with a built-in incentive for making up with their enemies." This may or may not have played a part in his initial intuition, apparently corroborated by his subsequent research, that "stumptails provide a gold mine for peace research" (p. 155). The capstone of Peacemaking, I would say, is de Waal's discussion of a much rarer "sister" chimpanzee species, Pan paniscus, otherwise called "bonobo." Together with the chimpanzees, bonobos share with us about twenty million years of common evolution (the ancestral lines diverged about eight million years ago) and about 99% of our DNA. Slightly smaller than Pan troglodytes, the bonobos, in de Waal's eyes, are more graceful, attractive, and intelligent, and, most important, behaviorally closest to our hominid ancestors (p. 179).' If de Waal likes the rhesus monkey and is fond of the chimpanzee, he is plainly enamored of the bonobo. He properly cautions, though, that it is a species "still very much unknown to us" (p. 11). Bonobo social structure differs considerably from that of Pan troglodytes. Adult male bands or troops are less common, with the strongest attractions being among adult females and between the sexes. Male bonding, accord- ingly, is weaker, and female bonobos occupy a more central role. The key to bonobo society, from food sharing to avoiding conflict, seems to be the desire to "make love, not war." Bonobo females are almost constantly receptive. Sexual exchange, in all possible combinations, plays so important a social is smitten with their charming personalities" (p. 145). Like Will Rogers, I suspect, de Waal has yet to meet a primate he doesn't like. 13. Strum (1987) suggested that, at least in environmental terms, a similar case can be made for the baboon (pp. 7-8).</page><page sequence="24">576 JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION role that de Waal finds himself compelled to describe their "highly erotic life" (p. 180) in engrossing detail. The bonobos"'impassioned eroticism" (p. 199) serves both to limit aggressive behavior in male-male, male-female, and female-female clashes and to serve as a major peacemaking technique. In what may not have been entirely an unintentional pun, de Waal remarks that "the art of sexual reconciliation may well have reached its evolutionary climax in the bonobo" (p. 219). To be sure, the efficacy of sex as a peacemaking device may be influenced by what seems to be the "remarkable gentleness" of the species. Physical aggression, when it occurs, "rarely lasted for more than a second" and rarely involved more than a slap or a minor nip.'4 One other bonobo difference should also be mentioned: Unlike the chimpanzees, reconciliations tend to be initiated by the higher ranking animals. It is almost, says de Waal, as if they " regret having lost their temper" (p. 221). The book's concluding chapter deals with what de Waal terms the "Crown of Creation"(i.e., our own species). fhe has two purposes: first, "to stress the amazing lack of data on peacemaking in private human relationships" and, second, to "reflect on this aspect of ourselves in a new and potentially enlightening way-by juxtaposing animal and human behaviors" (p. 230). The first task takes little time: "Except for reports on preschool children and an occasional anthropological account" (p. 233), de Waal laments, there are simply no data on reconciliation behavior in humans. Turning to his second topic, de Waal calls attention to the similarity of peacemaking behaviors among the higher primates. These include third- party mediation; opportunism (the two opponents just happen to come into close proximity so that reconciliation can begin); deception (where both agree that what happened did not really occur); the strategy whereby two combatants reconcile their argument by jointly attacking a third party; and the apparent improvement of relations which occurs when peacemaking establishes or reestablishes a clear-cut dominant-subordinate ranking. The thrust of this discussion is that these common patterns suggest, though they assuredly do not establish, a common evolutionary origin and, consequently, a genetic basis for our own behaviors. This "juxtaposition" of animal and human behaviors, as I remarked much earlier, raises a number of intriguing issues. Undoubtedly, the most important of these has already crystallized in the minds of those unfamiliar with, and/or skeptical of, de Waal's ethological approach: Can studies of other species, 14. According to their keepers, "bonobos are simply too smart to fight." A dubious commen- tary, indeed, on the keepers' species.</page><page sequence="25">Somit / HUMANS, CHIMPS, AND BONOBOS 577 even those closely related to us, really cast any useful light on the behavior of our own? To this most reasonable question, I can here offer only a brief response. The dangers of drawing inferences about one species on the basis of data derived from another, no matter their degree of genetic affinity, are suffi- ciently well-known to require no lengthy restatement (see Peterson and Somit 1978). As de Waal emphasizes, "two species may act the same because they share a long genetic history, because they have learned similar solutions, for both reasons or neither" (p. 230). Two additional caveats should be added: (1) the same species may act quite differently in different environments; and (2) very small genetic variations may be associated with strikingly divergent behaviors, as in the case of the chimpanzees and the bonobos. Having said this, I do not think it unreasonable to suggest, with de Waal, that there may be a good deal about ourselves to be learned from the thoughtful observation of animals with whom we share 99% of our DNA. That issue out of the way, what can we say about primate peacemaking? Two generalizations seem warranted. The more important is that "reconcili- ation behavior must be seen as a shared heritage of the primate order." As de Waal observes, "the fact that monkeys, apes, and humans all engage in reconciliation behavior means that it is probably over thirty million years old, preceding the evolutionary divergence of these primates" (p. 270). Unless this characteristic has somehow been lost over the past few million years, our species possesses a positive biological basis on which to build its peacemak- ing efforts-as well as an inherent tendency toward aggression. The second generalization is that making up, as we see it in other primates, almost always involves an explicit recognition of differential status, even when the process is initiated by the dominant. In de Waal's judgment, "The best predictor of improvement of an adverse relationship is the emergence of an unequivocal victor" (p. 245). Does this apply, I wonder, to nations and states? That is, does the acceptance of an inferior status by the losing power(s) improve relations between previously rival nations? Perhaps our polemologists can provide some guidance. This brings us to the next question: What does Peacemaking tell us about reconciliation in our own species? Directly, in the sense of hard information, not very much. We share some behaviors; others seem unique to us. For instance, humans have a "peace gesture" not found among other primates, the use of gifts or presents as an aspect of making up. This behavior, together with food sharing, appears early among children and seems to develop quite spontaneously.</page><page sequence="26">578 JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION We also differ from other primates in the manner in which the two sexes reconcile. A study cited by de Waal found that peacemaking occurred in 50% of the fights between boys, in 40% of the fights between girls, but in only 12% of the fights involving a boy and a girl (p. 255). These findings, though, are based on preschoolers, and de Waal reminds us that "many aspects of human social life change dramatically in adolescence, especially of course the relations between the sexes" (p. 255). The female of the species may be less aggressive but also less willing to reconcile. As matters now stand, it is by no means self-evident that, as some have argued, the presence of more women in high political office would necessarily be conducive to kinder, gentler, and less warlike government. "We need," says de Waal, "systematic studies on relationships within convents, nurses' homes, women's colleges, and so on, to verify whether Woman the Dove is myth or reality" (p. 55). But biology is not the only operative factor. There are definite cultural influences in the readiness to reconcile personal differences. Conflict-reso- lution does not fare particularly well in the United States where "both the number of lawyers per capita and the murder rate are several times higher than in other industrialized nations" (pp. 262-63). In this respect, de Waal notes, we compare unfavorably with the Dutch. That the difference is essentially cultural becomes evident when we remember that present-day Afrikaners, hardly models of peacemaking behavior, were originally of Dutch descent. Indirectly, Peacemaking may suggest a good deal more. Here, though, we need to distinguish between personal peacemaking, on one hand, and peace- making between large-scale organized entities such as nations, on the other. With very few exceptions, de Waal's observations relate to intragroup (or intratroop) reconciliation. In this sphere, Peacemaking is quite encouraging. We probably share, with the other great apes, biologically transmitted tend- encies toward conflict resolution, a conclusion supported by the many similarities of primate peacemaking behavior. The case is further strength- ened by the necessity of such a safety mechanism in a species which can undoubtedly remember longer, look further ahead, and react in far more deadly fashion than its fellow primates. With Homo sapiens, "hostilities that have not been reconciled are stored in our memory as if packed in ice. The recollection stays fresh and cold, as we wait for an opportunity to get even" (p. 261). Lacking some innate inclination to make up, our species, more so than any other, would probably have already become extinct. Unfortunately, the kind of intragroup personal conflict with which de Waal deals is profoundly different, qualitatively and quantitatively, from conflicts involving large-scale societies and states. Peacemaking proclivities</page><page sequence="27">Somit / HUMANS, CHIMPS, AND BONOBOS 579 (which evolved eons ago to meet the needs of our ape-like predecessors and may have been refined over the next few hundred thousand years by our hunter-gatherer ancestors) no longer function as an adequate counterbalance to the social and political institutions which dominate our lives and seem perversely designed to exploit our aggressive, rather than our conciliatory, inclinations. How, then, can a genetic inclination which evolved as a means of keeping individual aggression within tolerable limits be brought to bear on the persistent problem of national aggression and warfare? While our politicians and diplomats might personally be more than willing to embrace the bonobo strategy, "make love, not war," I doubt that it affords a very promising method of resolving contemporary international rivalries and ethnic antagonisms. Aware of the difference between personal conflict and organized warfare, de Waal is nonetheless both hopeful and confident that the problem is not insuperable. Toward that end, he urges a program of expanded research so that our innate peacemaking proclivities, better understood and culturally reinforced, may somehow show us how to "plan a future without war" (p. 269). I share his hope and endorse his proposal; it seems to me no less promising a strategy than those advanced in the two other books. I cannot say, though, that I share his confidence. Whatever the similarity of ancestry and DNA, we have come a long, long way from the "gentle Bonobo." Now, for the last and by no means trivial question: What does Peacemak- ing tell us about other aspects of human behavior? Each reader, no doubt, will have a highly personal reaction. Of the ideas which occurred to me, I would like to comment on a small handful. It is almost impossible to read de Waal without getting a better apprecia- tion of the socially constructive, as well as the destructive, aspects of aggression. Aggression is more than a necessary evil; it is a precondition of human society as we know it: If certain species, such as humans, reach a high degree of social differentiation, role division, and cooperation, this occurs because the cohesive tendency is counteracted by internal conflict. Individuals delineate their social positions in competition with others. We cannot have it both ways: a world in which each individual attains his or her own identity, and a world without clashing individual interests. (P. 236) Peacemaking reminds us, further, of the urgent primate need for frequent, close physical contact with one's fellows. Depending on the species, as much as 20% of an animal's time is spent in grooming or being groomed; recon- ciliations, we have seen, invariably involve some type of touching, kissing, or fondling. We have belatedly recognized the importance of this for infants.</page><page sequence="28">580 JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION In "progressive" hospitals, newborn babies are placed, as quickly and as often as possible, into the comforting arms of their mothers or of some maternal surrogate. Otherwise, Western societies leave the fulfillment of this need to the individual; in fact, we make a virtue of privacy and personal distance. I wonder how much less neurotic, and possibly how much less aggressive, our urban civilization would be if there were greater awareness of a desire which may be deeply rooted in our primate nature.'5 Finally, there is the issue long-beloved of political philosophers: What was life actually like in the "state of nature"? In recent years, especially with the ethological emphasis on aggression, the sociobiological fixation on inclusive fitness, and the economists' rediscovery of "rational man," the Hobbesian view has predominated. From that perspective, life must indeed have been "brutish, nasty and short," a view reinforced by de Waal's bleak portrayal of politics in a chimpanzee colony and Jane Goodall's (1986) discovery of warfare between chimpanzee troops. Now, however, we have an even more closely related species, the bonobo, and presumably a drasti- cally different mode of existence. Much less aggression, much less violence; life is far more fun and games, not to mention sex. Who, then, more closely resembles the very early humans, Pan troglodytes or Pan paniscus? Or will it be, as we learn more about the bonobo, that the behavioral differences will diminish and the bonobos will become depressingly like their keepers? CONCLUSION The Genetic Seeds of War, proceeding from one direction, and Peacemak- ingAmong Primates, coming from another, argue that human aggression and war (and in the case of Peacemaking, reconciliation as well), must be understood in terms of our evolutionary history. The primary objective of Aggression and War, on the other hand, is to refute that thesis. On this issue, as I sought to make clear at the outset, I favor the "progenetic influence" school. My position, I should add, is much closer to de Waal, who ignores "inclusive fitness" altogether, than to Shaw and Wong, for whom that concept serves as an all-purpose explanation. While going through the conflict resolution and peace journals to see what de Waal might have missed, I was struck by the scarcity of items which even hinted that our biological makeup might somehow influence our social and political behavior. Ethology, with its emphasis on evolution and natural 15. After writing this passage, I was delighted to learn that essentially the same thesis had been argued by Montagu (1971) almost two decades earlier.</page><page sequence="29">Somit / HUMANS, CHIMPS, AND BONOBOS 581 selection in shaping behavior, has received as much or more attention than any other science in the past twenty years, including three well-publicized Nobel prizes. Nonetheless, those who currently contribute to the conflict resolution literature apparently abide by the admonition to "abandon all biology, ye who enter here." This reluctance to consider, let alone concede, a role to genetic factors in shaping our behavior characterizes, in fact, mainstream social and political science. As a long-time advocate of a more biologically oriented political science, and as one who has also written in what is termed the history of science, I am aware of the resistance encountered by new ideas in any discipline, not just the social sciences. In this instance, though, I am increasingly persuaded that there is something more involved than what Stigler (1988) described as "the tenacity with which people hold the ideas in which they have a propri- etary interest" (p. 211). It is with that thought that I would like to close this review. For the past quarter-century, at least, ethologists (and sociobiologists) have almost unanimously agreed that human aggression has a substantial biological component. Underlying and no doubt reinforcing the still wide- spread opposition to this notion, an opposition reflected in Aggression and War, may be the fear that once we grant a role to biological factors, it may be impossible to draw the line at aggression and war. If aggression is the product, in some degree, of our evolutionary past, so too are dominance and subordination, behaviors which are just as consistently manifested by all social primates.'6 If we also have a genetic bias toward domination and subordination, as the evolutionary argument holds, what are the implications of these tenden- cies for both the theory and the practice of democracy? This potential linkage of genetic proclivities raises issues far beyond the scope of an article concerned with aggression and war. Nonetheless, to concede a biological factor in aggression compels us to consider the likelihood of a similar tendency toward dominance-and submission-in other aspects of our po- litical life. An understandable distaste for the consequences of such a linkage may be an important element in the thinking of those unwilling to take even the first step in what could be a disquieting intellectual journey. 16. Shepher (1987) wrote: Modern human life is basically a study in dominance hierarchies: we spend most of our waking hours in hierarchies that range from corporate industry to government adminis- tration, from supermarkets to department stores, from the elementary school to the university. Even our clubs, associations, churches, and hospitals are hierarchically organized, all displaying a wide variety of dominance systems.
