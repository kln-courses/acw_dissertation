DEVELOPMENT OF A THREE-POINT seat belt system comprised of webbing with controllable dynamic per- formance characteristics is important as the most cost- effective means of providing occupant protection in automotive crashes. Analysis of data and various information obtained from both actual and simulated crashes is important in order to improve system technology. Analysis of our seat belt system characteristics was conducted using the spring dash-pot sys- tem as indicated in Fig. 1 . We established dynamic perform- ance targets for the webbing based on the data derived from our analysis and produced webbing to meet those targets. To compare the controlled performance of Takata webbing versus conventional webbing under both dynamic and static tests, dummy tests were first conducted. The test results showed that the new webbing was superior to conventional webbing in absorbing impact energy. Static tests indicated that there were many problems which could not be confirm- ed or evaluated. Dynamic tests, on the other hand, showed us that although some answers were available, there were still some uncertain areas which needed additional testing. DYNAMIC PERFORMANCE TEST OF WEBBING The evaluation of webbing performance can be divided into static and dynamic characteristics. There have been numer- ous discussions on both phenomena. As far as automotive safety seat belts are concerned, the use of static test phenom- ena may be standard practice but we doubt its real values. Because there has been no standardized testing method for evaluating dynamic conditions, we created our own test equipment, an impact test sled, as shown in Figs. 2, 3 and 4. Webbing pieces to be tested were placed on the impact sled. One end of the webbing was attached to the sled and a weight was attached to the opposite end of the webbing. The weight was free to move horizontally on the sled during impact. The ABSTRACT Seat belt systems can be considered as the most convenient and practical system for occupant protection in automotive crash situations. Takata Kojyo Co., Ltd. has been striving to design and create a seat belt system that would be both practical and effective in absorbing impact energy with no injury in high speed crashes. In our search for more effective seat belt systems, we have conducted various, comparison tests between conventional webbings and our newly developed webbing in regard to rheological property. 1 . In regard to the dynamic performance of the webbing, the quantity of absorbed impact energy and the rate of ab- sorbing energy were obtained and compared through tests at various impact speeds. 2. Dummy tests were conducted in our laboratories to compare the improved Takata energy -absorbing (EA) web- bing with conventional webbing. The results showed the conspicuous superiority of the Takata webbing over the con- ventional types. 3. Using our improved webbing, two live human volunteers were able to successfully complete tests at impact speeds of 30.3 and 30.4 mph without injury or pain. 4. In the future, to enhance safety, seat belts, as well as other restraint systems, should be evaluated with the use of dynamic tests with living human volunteer subjects rather than with anthropomorphic dummies. 2261</page><page sequence="2">2262 JUICHIRO TAKADA Xj x3 X2 k C r- I- i -Wr- j] - m '&lt;) C Y n n m MASS OF OCCUPANTS k SPRING CONSTANT c DASH POT DAMPING CONSTANT X j VEHICLE DISPLACEMENT x2 OCCUPANT POSTURE DISPLACEMENT Fig. 1 - Simple crash model 1 FIXED BARRIER 2 SLED 3 WEIGHT 4 ACCELEROMETER 5 TENSIOMETER 6 LEAD PIPE 7 WEBBING 8 HIGH SPEED CAMERA 9 WIRE ROPE 10 TARGET POINT Fig. 2 - Dynamic test configuration of webbing utilizing sled impact test equipment Fig. 3 - Sled for dynamic test of webbing Fig. 4 - Sled for dynamic test of webbing sled was accelerated and impacted against a barrier.

However, the rate of onset of load as applied by the impact sled was not constant. Oscillographic records of the impact sled tests, and the strain versus time curves were used to create the load versus strain curve. The results of the measurements are shown at Figs. 7 and 8. In Fig. 9, the area OAB represent energy absorbed by the webbing per unit length in the impact sled tests. The area under the curve designated by O A C is equivalent to the work done on webbing per unit length. The energy absorbed divided by the work can be describee as the energy absorp- tion ratio. ■s 0 B C ELONGATION Fig. 9 - Load versus elongation curve ( 25 kg WEIGHT I 35 kg □ 10 M.P.H. 260 - £ SLED O 20 M.P.H.

That webbing, therefore, was expected to provide the most favorable results in dummy as well as in the live human testing at Naval Air Development Center, Philadelphia. The Type F 121 Takata webbing was developed specifically for use as the shoulder belt in restraint belt systems. The system components are shown in Figs. 1 1 and 12. ANTHROPOMORPHIC DUMMY TESTS We conducted a series of dynamic dummy tests on our sled with three-point belt systems as shown in Figs. 13 and 14. One system included the newly developed webbing (F121) while the other used conventional webbing. The dummy used for the tests was the Alderson VIP 50A. The sled tests were run at 10, 20 and 30 mph.

The effectiveness of our new webbing was shown through our basic tests and also through dummy tests for advanced/ passive belt restraint systems run by Department of Trans- portation's National Highway and Traffic Safety Administra- tion at the Philadelphia Naval Base. The dummy used in Fig. 14 - Sled for dynamic test of seat belt assembly those tests was the Hybrid 2. The maximum test speed was approximately 30 mph. HUMAN VOLUNTEER TEST In order to determine the most effective energy absorbing belt system used in NHTSA's test program involving ad- vanced/passive belt restraint systems, a series of tests with live human volunteers were run. Five human volunteers using three-point seat belt systems developed by Takata Kojyo participated in a series of tests starting at 5 mph and ending at 30.4 mph. Test speeds were increased in increments of 2.5 mph. The final results show that the live human volunteers were able to successfully complete a simulated car crash test of slightly more than 30 mph at slightly over 21 G without injury or pain.
