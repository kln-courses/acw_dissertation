<plain_text><page sequence="1">Man on His Nature. By CHARLES SHERRINGTON. (The Gifford Lec- tures, Edinburgh, ~937-38.) New York, the Macmillan Company, x94x. PP. x, 4~4. This deeply learned but thoroughly fascinating work by the dean of British physiologists is a deftly drawn sketch of the mechanistic philosophy of the organism. Since the trend of science can be better judged by contrasting general positions taken a considerable interval' apart, Sir Charles, before developing the modern point of view, devotes the first two chapters to a vivid presentation of the point of view of the mid-Renaissance, choosing as a representative text Jean Fernel's De abditis rerurn causis. For Fernel, as for most of his contemporaries, the natural and the religious must fuse, must "meet and rejoice together". Nature was a principle seized by the mind a priori but confirmed inductively. It was the cause of the perceptible world. Life and mind were one, separable from the matter which they inhabit. Matter was an inert substratum separable from the "form" which gave it life. Form was a substance of celestial provenance, derived from the stars above the planets, and carried by the immaterial innate heat. All the workings of the body were "the acts of a spiritual incorporeal occupant of the material body". That occupant was the soul with three-fold aspect, vegetative, sentient, and reasoning, through whose activities the integration of the body was effected. For Fernel the study of Nature was the study of final causes, the reading of function from design. Functions were the purposes, purposes the causes of the body. "With Aristotle the causation was immanent. With Fernel it was extrinsic... a power outside the ,Universe which adapted means to its ends." But unlike Aristotle, he regarded the individual soul of man as immortal. For Aristotle, animal and man were of the same category of being, but even the</page><page sequence="2">228 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. LI. suspicion of an actual tie of kinship between animal and man was alien to Fernel's philosophy. Each form of life was for him "a creation unrooted in the past; a bolt out of the blue". Such in brief was the Christianized Aristotelianism of Fernel. How changed is the picture Sherrington paints of our outlook today! Matter is energy, a system of rushing units, equilibria of torrents of movement; form and matter inseparably one-one and the same motion. And life? Life is an energy-system which in its give and take with the energy system around it manages to continue itself for a period as a self-centered, balanced unity. "There is in living nothing fundamentally other than is going forward in all the various grades of energy systems . . . whether atom, molecule, colloidal complex or what not, whether virus, or cell, or plant or animal compounded of cells, each is a system of motion in commerce with its surround." There is no essential difference in the behavior of the living body and the atom, merely differences in scheme and degree of complexity. There appears to be no good reason for speaking of one as living, the other as non-living. The 'living' and 'lifeless' present no differences for which rearrangement of their parts will not account. Fernel's unitary and imperishable life-principle has become resolved into millions of local principles-polyphasic, chemico-physical, in- tegratively organized systems called cells; and his faculties of the psyche have correspondingly multiplied. That grand problem of embryology, the "mechanism of the shaping of the house of life", is no longer a vitalistic mystery. It is at last yielding itself up to science. Today this machinism is seen as an activity, the chemical response of an energy system. The chemistry is plain every-day chemistry, but the brew in preparation for it, "time has been stirring unceasingly throughout some millions of years", rejecting much, retaining little. All the forward-looking steps the embryo takes in preparation for future function, and all the finely balanced, integrative activities, all the beautifully adaptive mechanisms of the body, are evolved by purely physical and chemical processes. And what applies to the evolution of the individual applies equally well to phylogeny. It is mind that presents the real problem. Mind is not demonstrable as energy, nor energy as mind. Yet mind seems to have arisen progressively as motor integration has progressed. Man's mind has evolved by gradual changes of previous mind. Always mind is attached to a running energy-system, with a "ioo% correlation as regards 'place' and 'time' between finite mind and chemical action in the brain". Yet the gap between the study of the mind and brain is still wide; no one doubts a liaison between them, but the 'how' of it remains a riddle. Man's analysis of his sensible world has outstripped his analysis</page><page sequence="3">No. 2.] REVIEWS OF BOOKS 229 of his own mind. The two concepts, "space-time energy and sensible and insensible unextended mind" present biology with a dilemma-how to account for conjunction between two incommensurables. It must be treated pragmatically as if the two terms, mind and energy, were conjoined because to observation they act connectedly. And what of Lord Gifford's ideal in founding the lectures of which this book is an outgrowth-that the facts of Natural Theology be treated just as physics and chemistry in examining "the relation which man and the universe bear to Him, the First and Only Cause"? That presents a further difficulty. The natural sciences today resent the intrusion of anthropomorphism; they reject causes and refuse to answer Lord Gifford's question as to the First Cause. Science today finds a Nature where evil is often more plentiful than good, but in contrast with materialistic philosophies of the past, the materialism of today is "an inspiration for dealing with Nature". "Evolution is the dominant note in the message which today one hears from Nature"-evolution of the interaction between one living thing and another. Granting the scope of Natural Science to be the distinction of true from false, not right from evil, the man of science becomes but a fraction of a citizen. He must, to play his part, combine his evolved sense of values with his "scientific part man." Otherwise "scientific knowledge and ethical judgment become two idle wheels spinning without effect, whereas they have been evolved and survive each to give the other effect." Man's altruism must grow; "altruism which may strike the biologist as contrary to the broad trend and polity of life. That makes the more notable the fact that evolution never- theless has brought it [altruism] about. Nothing shows better than it that man is Nature's beginning to be self-conscious". "Altruistic sympathy as permeating peoples may be small as yet; but, as the periods of the planet reckon, civilization itself is young. Who shall foretell the possibilities of the future? If in the past the cohesion of families of cells in due course transformed the whole outlook of life upon the planet, shall not the psychical cohesion of individual lives carry that transformation further, with such conse- quences to the flowering of life as beggar our fancy to conceive?" Social life is man's opportunity as a field for his values. "To know that he is a life being evolved which carries with it 'values' can imbue his social system with a purpose." Man's mind is patched with two bents, a social and a predatory. Social man must attain the ascend- ancy to avoid catastrophy. Man must husband the 'values' in his keeping. Altruism is the cement of 'fellowship which cultivates an equal respect for values and equal rights in values. "Under evolution the motto of the planet has been 'more life'; under man's leadership it should be 'better life'."

This is the natural religion, if it may be called such, that Sir Charles envisions. H. B. ADELMANN CORNELL UNIVERSITY</page></plain_text>
