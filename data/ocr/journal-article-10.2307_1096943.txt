<plain_text><page sequence="1">Corporate Knowledge: Identification or Attribution? Ross Grantham* The ascription to a company of the action, knowledge and fault of an individual has until recently been on the basis either that the individual was identified as the company or was the company's agent. In its recent decision in Meridian Global Funds Management Asia Ltd v The Securities Commission,' the Privy Council has rejected the identification approach and suggested that the principles of agency are but one aspect of the true principle upon which a company is bound, that of attribution. The case arose out of an abortive attempt to gain control of Euro-National Corporation Ltd ('ENC'), using its assets to fund the acquisition. In a complicated *Senior Lecturer, University of Auckland. 1 [1995] 3 WLR 413, Lords Keith, Jauncey, Mustill, Lloyd and Hoffmann. The opinion was delivered by Lord Hoffmann. 732 C The Modem Law Review Limited 1996</page><page sequence="2">September 1996] Meridian Global Funds Management series of transactions, Meridian, through its chief investment manager, Koo, and its senior portfolio manager, Ng, acquired a beneficial interest in shares which held a controlling interest in ENC.2 The acquisition was to be funded by the purchase from ENC of shares in two Asian companies and the resale of those shares to ENC at a greater price. The buy-back phase was, however, frustrated by the refusal of ENC's independent directors to release the funds. The scheme was subsequently abandoned, with Meridian and its parent, National Mutual, bearing the loss. As a company listed on the New Zealand Stock Exchange, those acquiring an interest in ENC were subject to the requirement in section 20 of the New Zealand Securities Amendment Act 1988 that every substantial security holder, that is, one acquiring a relevant interest in five per cent or more of the shares in a public company, disclose this fact 'as soon as the person knows, or ought to know,' to the public company and the relevant stock exchange.3 Although it was tolerably clear that Meridian had acquired an interest within the meaning of the Act,4 it was not so clear that it knew of the acquisition. While Koo was one of Meridian's five directors, in respect of share trading he reported to the managing director and acted more in the nature of a senior executive, with Ng as his subordinate. The full extent of Koo and Ng's activities was not discovered by the board until some time later. The Securities Commission contended that for the purpose of establishing Meridian's knowledge, Koo and Ng were to be identified as the company. In the New Zealand Court of Appeal,5 this contention was upheld. Pursuant to the principle established in Tesco Supermarkets Ltd v Nattrass,6 whereby a company might be held to have the knowledge of one who was the 'directing mind and will' of the company, Meridian was bound by Koo's knowledge of the acquisition.7 Although Meridian's board was not aware of the acquisition, and although Koo did not occupy a position at the very top of the corporate hierarchy, he had full responsibility for buying and selling shares, a function he performed without direct supervision. In respect of such transactions, in the Court's view, Koo could therefore be said to be the company's directing mind and will. This finding was upheld by the Privy Council, but on conceptually distinct grounds. In their Lordships' opinion, delivered by Lord Hoffmann, the relevant principle was that of attribution. As the acts and knowledge of a company, being a persona ficta, are necessarily those of individuals,8 the issue was whether the knowledge of Koo and Ng could be attributed to Meridian. This was to be deter- mined by rules of attribution. The primary rules of attribution, in his Lordship's view, were to be found in the company's constitution, most typically in its articles of association. These rules, however, are supplemented by more general rules, rules that apply equally to individuals, such as agency and estoppel. However, there are cases where these rules may be inapplicable. The particular rule of law 2 The acquisition of the beneficial interest came about through Meridian's financing of the purchase by another party of a 49 per cent stake in ENC. 3 The comparable provisions in the Companies Act 1985 are to be found in Part VI; s 198 imposes an obligation on a person to disclose certain interests to the company in which the shares are held; s 198 differs, however, from the New Zealand provision in that the obligation is triggered by actual, not constructive, knowledge. Part VI of the Companies Act 1985 seeks to implement the European Directive on Major Shareholding (EC Directive 88/627), though the Directive adopts a constructive knowledge standard. This aspect was not implemented due to concern over compliance costs. 4 This point was dealt with shortly by the Court of Appeal and only the knowledge point was taken before the Privy Council. 5 [1994] 2 NZLR 291. 6 [1972] AC 153. 7 Though not Ng. He was felt to be too junior to be the directing mind and will of the company. 8 See also Lord Nolan's comments in Re Supply of Ready Mixed Concrete (No 2) [1995] 1 AC 456,474. C The Modern Law Review Limited 1996 733</page><page sequence="3">The Modern Law Review [Vol. 59 under consideration may, expressly or impliedly, rule out reliance on both the primary and the more general rules of attribution: 'For example, a rule may be stated in language primarily applicable to a natural person and require some act or state of mind on the part of that person "himself," as opposed to his servants or agents.'9 In such cases, Lord Hoffmann felt, if it is decided the substantive rule is nevertheless to apply to companies, the court must fashion a special rule of attribution to determine 'whose act (or knowledge or state of mind) was for this purpose intended to count as the act etc. of the company? One finds the answer to this question by applying the usual canons of interpretation, taking into account the language of the rule (if it is a statute) and its content and policy.' 1o In the New Zealand Court of Appeal, reliance had been placed on Tesco Supermarkets Ltd v Nattrass. This case has been generally understood as establishing the proposition that the acts and knowledge of a person who was the directing mind and will of the company could be treated as though they were the acts or knowledge of the company itself, that person being the company's alter ego.' In an interpretation foreshadowed in Re Supply of Ready Mixed Concrete (No 2),12 Lord Hoffmann felt that such cases were not to be understood as resting on an identification of the individual with the company. Rather, the individual's actions and knowledge are attributed to the company. Thus, in Lennard's Carrying Co Ltd v Asiatic Petroleum Co Ltd,'3 as the rule was to be applied to a company, the court was required to decide, having regard to the content and purpose of the rule, whose acts were to be attributed to the company. When, therefore, Viscount Haldane spoke of Mr Lennard as the directing mind, this was merely an anthropomorphically expressed answer to this question. Mr Lennard was responsible for monitoring the condition of the ship and, as section 502 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1894 was concerned with such matters, it was appropriate to attribute his actions to the company for that purpose. The immediate consequence of this approach is that the determination of those whose actions are to be attributed appears no longer to be solely the province of the company's internal hierarchy. It is the nature of the functions performed by the individual that seems crucial. This may entail the attribution to the company of actions of employees at a level lower than was previously the case. The directing mind and will formula suggested, by its very terms, that the person would usually occupy a senior position.14 The criterion for attribution, focusing upon those who had responsibility for the matter with which the rule is concerned, is not predicated upon the individual's ability to control or influence the overall conduct of the company, only the matter with which the rule is concerned. In particular, it now seems far more likely that the actions of branch managers, section heads and those such as Koo and Ng, with operational autonomy, will be attributed to the company. A significant feature of the opinion was the approach taken to the rules of agency, which formerly were the primary legal mechanism by which the company acted. Lord Hoffmann appeared to treat the entire question of which actions are to count as those of the company as one of attribution, with the rules of agency being 9 [1995] 3 WLR 413, 419. 10 ibid 419.

See also Lord Nolan's comments, at 474-475. 13 [1915] AC 705 (HL). 14 Thus, in the Court of Appeal, any identification of Ng with the company was ruled out because of his relatively lowly position. He was only in the third level of hierarchy: [1994] 2 NZLR 291, 302.

This point is reinforced by Lord Hoffmann's comment that, even where the substantive rule excludes attribu- tion by agency, the individual's actions might still be attributed by virtue of a special attribution rule. One important question arising from the apparent relega- tion of agency to an instance of a more general rule is whether the general principle may be relied upon to attribute to the company the actions or knowledge of an individual who had neither actual nor apparent authority to bind the company. In considering this issue, a distinction must be drawn between two circumstances in which a court might have recourse to special rules of attribution. The first is where the general rules of attribution are inappropriate. This may be because the defendant is to be liable only for his own acts and intent, as is often the case in criminal offences, or because the policy of the substantive rule indicates that the general rules do not exhaust the scope for attribution, as was the case in Re Supply of Ready Mixed Concrete (No 2).15 The second is where the general rules of attribution apply, but where they determine that attribution of action or knowledge is inappropriate because, for example, the act was beyond the agent's or employee's authority. While resort to special rules is appropriate in the first case, it is unlikely that Lord Hoffmann intended resort to a special rule of attribution in the latter case. First, his Lordship seems to envisage recourse to special rules only where the general rules of attribution 'will not provide an answer."6 This will occur, however, only where the general rules of attribution have been excluded or are inapplicable. Where the rules do apply, they will be 'sufficient to enable one to determine [the company's] rights and obligations.' 17 In such a case, therefore, even if the principles of agency indicate that the action was beyond the agent's authority, the scope of the company's liability has been conclusively determined. The rule of attribution, agency, has determined that the company ought not to be held responsible for the agent's action. As such, there is neither the need nor the scope to resort to special rules of attribution. Secondly, it seems that on the facts attribution was found to be appropriate because Koo had authority to acquire the shares.18 This is at least consistent with the view that the principles of agency, where they apply, are determinative of the company's liability. Thirdly, a contrary conclusion is also undesirable. A company would lose much of its ability to control the extent to which it may acquire liability for the torts of its employees and contracts made by its agents - a state of affairs that would seem to seriously impair the efforts in recent years to improve the utility of the corporate form as a vehicle for commerce.19 Furthermore, the statutory reforms of the law regarding the authority of directors to bind the company20 have in large measure been premised on the assumption that the articles of association and the principles of agency are the exclusive means by which the company might be bound. To acknowledge that those dealing with the company might routinely fall back on a more generic principle would seem both to make such reforms redundant and to undermine the balance, reflected in the legislation, between the protection of those dealing with the company from defects in the company's internal administration 15 An express limitation on the employees' authority did not prevent attribution: [1995] 1 AC 456, 465 per Lord Templeman, and 475 per Lord Nolan. 16 [1995] 3 WLR 413, 419. 17 ibid 419. 18 ibid 423.

In recent years, discussions of corporate personality have been marked by anthropomorphism22 (the tendency to conceive of the company as having a physical existence), formalism23 (the question whether the company is bound depending on adherence to formal procedures) and absoluteness24 (the recognition of the company as an entity for all purposes). Lord Hoffmann's vision seems markedly different. There is little sign of anthropo- morphism: there is 'no such thing as the company as such ... only the applicable rules' of attribution.25 The attribution of action or knowledge takes place, at least at the margins, on the basis of whether the policy of the substantive rule requires that action be attributed to the company, rather than exclusively through formal procedures. Lord Hoffmann also seems to conceive of the company's existence contextually rather than absolutely: whether one recognises the company (or, more to the point, an act as that of the company) depends on the substantive rules and, one would suggest, the purposes for which the law has recognised the corporate fiction. Although departing significantly from the approach taken in recent years, Lord Hoffmann's approach has a sound intellectual footing. Scholars have long recognised that the company as an entity does not exist in a vacuum. The recognition that the entity exists is merely a conclusion that for certain purposes, such as allowing collectivities to speak as one, the facilitation of business and the aggregation of capital,26 the law will apply rules 'to the conduct of individuals in a manner radically different from, though still analogous to, that in which such rules apply to individuals apart from such special conditions.'27 While such a conceptualisation cannot solve all the problems associated with corporate personality, it does offer the prospect of an approach to at least two of company law's perennial problems which are doctrinally coherent. First, it has long been recognised that the contextual nature of the entity may offer considerable assistance in determining the circumstances in which the court might 'disregard' the entity.28 If the entity exists only for certain purposes, then those purposes seem to provide a compelling justification both for recognising the entity and declining to recognise it. Thus, in Salomon v A Salomon &amp; Co Ltd,29 for example, despite the closely held nature of the company, for the court to have stressed anything other than the company's separate existence would have frustrated one of the central purposes of the entity, the facilitation of limited liability. In other contexts, the purpose to which the entity is being put makes recognition inappropriate. This may be so because it is an improper one, as in 21 See, for example, the comments of Kirby P in Bank of New Zealand v Fiberi Pty Ltd (1994) 12 ACLC 48 (CA, New South Wales). 22 See, for example, Trevor Ivory Ltd v Anderson [1992] 2 NZLR 517; noted by Wishart, 'Anthropomorphism Rampant: Rounding up Executive Directors' Liability' [1993] NZLJ 175. 23 Tunstall v Steigmann [1962] 2 QB 598; Wairau Energy Centre Ltd v First Fishing Co Ltd (1991) 5 NZCLC 67,379; noted by Grantham, 'Shareholder Agreements and Corporate Personality' (1992) 15 NZULR 206. 24 Adams v Cape Industries plc [1991] 1 All ER 929 (CA). 25 [1995] 3 WLR 413, 419. 26 See Radin, 'The Endless Problem of Corporate Personality' (1932) 32 Columbia L Rev 643. 27 Hart, 'Theory and Definition in Jurisprudence' (1954) 70 LQR 37, 53. 28 See Radin, op cit n26; Latty, 'The Corporate Entity as a Solvent of Legal Problems' (1936) 34 Michigan L Rev 597; Beck, 'The Two Sides of the Corporate Veil' in Farrar (ed), Contemporary Issues in Company Law (Auckland: Commerce Clearing House, 1987) p69. 29 [18971 AC 22. 736 0 The Modem Law Review Limited 1996</page><page sequence="6">September 1996] Meridian Global Funds Management Gildford Motor Co Ltd v Horne,30 or because a strict application would frustrate one or more of these purposes, as was perhaps the case in DHN Food Distributors Ltd v London Borough of Tower Hamlets.31 While there may be difficulties determining what an appropriate purpose is, or what is implied by the pursuit of that purpose, the focus on the nature and function of the entity certainly seems more satisfying than the rather opaque assertion that the entity is to be disregarded because it is a mere facade.32 Secondly, such an approach may also assist our understanding of when and how criminal liability might be imposed upon companies. Analytically, once it is accepted that the acts of the company are merely the acts of individuals attributed to it, and that the application of criminal and regulatory rules to companies is, if at all, by analogy, the central questions are thus identified: is the analogy appropriately made and, if so, how? Again, while the answers may be difficult and complex, it is, as Hart suggested,33 a far more illuminating approach than the reification that underlies the 'directing mind and will' metaphor. In practical terms also, the approach seems to have much to offer. As Wells has suggested, it seems more in tune with the realities of diffused organisational decision making, where application of the alter ego doctrine may lead to no one being liable.34 Finally, Meridian has important implications for the debate surrounding the final implementation of the EC Directive on major shareholdings.35 The Directive required disclosure on the basis of constructive knowledge but, due to concerns over the cost of compliance, the obligation in section 198 of the Companies Act 1985 was limited to where the shareholder had actual knowledge of the interest.36 The issue whether the United Kingdom must fully implement the Directive must now be seen in light of the attribution principle. The effect of the attribution principle is to extend considerably the circumstances in which the shareholder may be said to actually know of the interest.37 When coupled with constructive knowledge, it would seem that a company could be said to know not only where its agent or employee knows of the interest, as was the case in Meridian, but also where the agent or employee merely ought to have known. To extend the obligation of disclosure to such an extent may be both unduly onerous in terms of compliance costs and, more importantly, unnecessary. To an extent, the aim of extending knowledge in respect of companies to constructive knowledge is to deny the company the opportunity to rely on its ignorance of the actions of its agents and employees.38 The principle stated in Meridian., however, has already gone a long way to denying the company that opportunity. 30 [1933] Ch 935. The corporate entity was being used by the defendant to evade his obligations under a valid restraint of trade agreement. 31 [1976] 3 All ER 462. See Beck, op cit n 28. Briefly, the case concerned a claim by the company for compensation in respect of the compulsory purchase of its factory. The right to compensation depended upon the claimant having an interest in the land. The land was, however, owned by the plaintiff's subsidiary. The Court of Appeal upheld the right to compensation on the basis that the company and its subsidiary were a single economic entity. 32 Which is the approach taken in Adams v Cape Industries plc [1991] 1 All ER 929.
